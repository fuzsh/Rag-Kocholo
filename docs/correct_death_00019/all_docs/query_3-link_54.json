        "text": "Noah Griffin, founder and artistic director of the Cole Porter Society, brought the American composer and songwriter Cole Porter to life when he presented a program recently at the Commonwealth Club of California.\n\nThe program, “Cole Porter: The Music and the Man” held on Aug. 19, was part of a month-long Music Matters series presented by the Commonwealth Club featuring prominent speakers and artists from the Bay Area who speak on why music matters to them.\n\nNoah’s description of Cole Porter’s life was colorful and full of humor. He painted a picture of the man, privileged from birth, who wrote 300 songs while at Yale, including many student songs that are still played at the university today.\n\nIn the 1930s, Porter was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. Unlike many successful Broadway composers, he wrote the lyrics as well as the music for his songs.\n\nPorter realized that he was not destined to be a lawyer and, at the suggestion of the dean of the Harvard Law School, he switched to Harvard’s music faculty.\n\nNoah performed some of Porter’s most witty and legendary songs: Let’s Do It, Let’s Fall in Love, Don’t Fence Me In, and It’s Delovely from the musical “Anything Goes.” On two occasions, he invited the audience to sing along.\n\n“I first became a fan of Cole Porter many years ago at Castro Valley High School when I performed in two of his wonderful musical shows: ‘Anything Goes’ and ‘Kiss Me Kate,'” said Carol Henri, Commonwealth Club member. “His lyrics are clever and his music is delightful! I still know the words to all the songs and was singing along.”\n\nThroughout the month of August, the Commonwealth Club has presented outstanding artists, from jazz to symphony, hambone to choirs, instruments, film soundtracks, American composers and gospel music.\n\nCarol Fleming, director of the Music Matters series, stated, “If you love music, you must take steps to encourage more of it. We must teach our children that music making is part of human heritage, deserving of our attention and support.”\n\nMaestro Michael Morgan, music director of the Oakland Symphony, will lead a panel of composers discussing “Orchestra Music Grown Locally,” Tuesday, August 25, at 6 p.m. at 555 Post St. in San Francisco.\n\nFor tickets, call (415) 597-6702 or visit www.commonwealthclub.org.\n\nOakland Post\n\nThe Black Cultural Zone’s Pivotal Role in Rebuilding Oakland’s Black Community\n\nBy Tanya Dennis\n\nBetween 1990 and 2020, Oakland lost nearly half of its Black population due to economic and social forces. East Oakland, once a middle-class community, is now home to mostly Black families living in poverty.\n\nIn 2021, 314 Oakland residents died from COVID-19. More than 100 of them, or about 33.8%, were Black, a high rate of death as Blacks constitute only 22.8% of Oakland’s population.\n\nThis troubling fact did not go unnoticed by City and County agencies, and the public-at-large, ultimately leading to the development of several community organizations determined to combat what many deemed an existential threat to Oakland’s African American residents.\n\nEastside Arts Alliance had already proposed that a Black Cultural Zone be established in Deep East Oakland in 2010, but 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic galvanized the community.\n\nDemanding Black legacy preservation, the Black Cultural Zone (BCZ) called for East Oakland to be made an “unapologetically Black” business, commercial, economic development community.\n\nEstablished initially as a welcoming space for Black art and culture, BCZ emerged into a a community development collective, and acquired the Eastmont police substation in Eastmont Town Center from the City of Oakland in 2020.\n\nOnce there, BCZ immediately began combating the COVID-19 pandemic with drive-thru PPE distribution and food giveaways. BCZ’s Akoma Market program allowed businesses to sell their products and wares safely in a COVID-compliant space during the COVID-19 shutdown.\n\nCurrently, Akoma Market is operated twice a month at 73rd and Foothill Boulevard and Akoma vendors ‘pop up’ throughout the state at festivals and community-centered events like health fairs.\n\n“Before BCZ existed, East Oakland was a very depressing place to live,” said Ari Curry, BCZ’s chief experience officer and a resident of East Oakland. “There was a sense of hopelessness and not being seen. BCZ allows us to be seen by bringing in the best of our culture and positive change into some of our most depressed areas.”\n\nThe culture zone innovates, incubates, informs, and elevates the Black community and centers it in arts and culture, Curry went on.\n\n“With the mission to center ourselves unapologetically in arts, culture, and economics, BCZ allows us to design, resource, and build on collective power within our community for transformation,” Curry concluded.\n\nAs a part of Oakland Thrives, another community collective, BCZ began working to secure $100 million to develop a ‘40 by 40’ block area that runs from Seminary Avenue to the Oakland-San Leandro border and from MacArthur Boulevard to the Bay.\n\nThe project would come to be known as Rise East.\n\nCarolyn Johnson, CEO of BCZ says, “Our mission is to build a vibrant legacy where we thrive economically, anchored in Black art and commerce. The power to do this is being realized with the Rise East Project.\n\n“With collective power, we are pushing for good health and self-determination, which is true freedom,” Johnson says. “BCZ’s purpose is to innovate, to change something already established; to incubate, optimizing growth and development, and boost businesses’ economic growth with our programs; we inform as we serve as a trusted source of information for resources to help people; and most important, we elevate, promoting and boosting Black folks up higher with the services we deliver with excellence.\n\n“Rise East powers our work in economics, Black health, education, and power building. Rise East is the way to get people to focus on what BCZ has been doing. The funding for the 40 by 40 Rise East project is funding the Black Culture Zone,” Johnson said.\n\nOakland Post\n\nBy Post Staff\n\nAlameda County District Attorney Pamela Price is asking supporters of the justice reform agenda that led her to victory last November to come to a Town Hall on public safety at Montclair Presbyterian Church on July 27.\n\nPrice is facing a possible recall election just six months into her term by civic and business interests, some of whom will be at the in-person meeting from 6:00-9:00 p.m. at 5701 Thornhill Dr. in Oakland.\n\n“We know that opponents of criminal justice reform plan to attend this meeting and use it as a forum against the policies that Alameda County voters mandated DA Price to deliver. We cannot let them succeed,” her campaign team’s email appeal said.\n\n“That’s why I’m asking you to join us at the town hall,” the email continued. “We need to show up in force and make sure that our voices are heard.”\n\nPrice’s campaign is also seeking donations to fight the effort to have her recalled.\n\nHer history-making election as the first African American woman to hold the office had been a surprise to insiders who had expected that Terry Wiley, who served as assistant district attorney under outgoing D.A. Nancy O’Malley, would win.\n\nPrice campaigned as a progressive, making it clear to voters that she wanted to curb both pretrial detention and life-without-parole sentences among other things. She won, taking 53% of the vote.\n\nAlmost immediately, Price was challenged by some media outlets as well as business and civic groups who alleged, as she began to fulfill those campaign promises, that she was soft on crime.\n\nOn July 11, the recall committee called Save Alameda for Everyone (S.A.F.E.) filed paperwork with the county elections office to begin raising money for the next step toward Price’s ouster: gathering signatures of at least 10% of the electorate.\n\nS.A.F.E. has its work cut out for them, but Price needs to be prepared to fight them to keep her office.\n\nIn a separate sponsored letter to voters, Price supporters wrote:\n\n“We know that you supported DA Price because you believe in her vision for a more just and equitable Alameda County. We hope you share our belief that our criminal justice system has to be fair to everyone, regardless of their race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or socioeconomic status.\n\n“The Republican-endorsed effort is a blatant attempt to overturn the will of the voters and a waste of time and money. It is an attempt to silence the voices of those who want real justice. We cannot let these election deniers succeed.\n\n“Will you make a donation today to help us protect the win?\n\n“Please watch this video and share it with your friends and family. We need to stand up to the sore losers and protect the win. Together, we can continue to make Alameda County a more just, safe and equitable place for everyone.”\n\nFor more information, go to the website: pamelaprice4da.com\n\nor send an e-mail to info@pamelaprice4da.com\n\nOakland Post\n\nOEA calls unfair labor practices strike after 7 months of negotiations.\n\nBy Ken Epstein\n\nAfter negotiating late into the night and months of fruitless bargaining with the Oakland Unified School District, Oakland teachers went out on strike Thursday morning.\n\n“Our (50-member) bargaining team has been working for seven months working, making meaningful proposals that will strengthen our schools for our students,” said Oakland Education Association (OEA) Interim President Ismael “Ish” Armendariz, speaking at press conference Monday afternoon.\n\n“OUSD has repeatedly canceled bargaining sessions, has failed to offer meaningful proposals or counterproposals at a majority of the bargaining sessions and has repeatedly failed to discuss certain items,” Armendariz said.\n\n“The days (of bargaining) have been long, and after hours of waiting, the superintendent finally showed up on Sunday night at 11:00 p.m.to meet with our team (for the first time),” he said. “(But) the district continues to come to the table unprepared, and this is unacceptable.”\n\n“This is illegal, and OEA has filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge with the state Public Employment Relations Board (PERB). Under California law, OEA has a right to strike over unfair labor practices,” he said.\n\nOEA represents 3,000 teachers, counselors, psychologists, speech pathologists, early childhood educators, nurses, adult education instructors and substitute teachers, serving 35,000 Oakland public school students. Other labor groups representing school employees include SEIU 1021 and construction unions.\n\nIn a press statement released on Tuesday, OUSD said it has been trying to avert a strike.\n\n“The district will remain ready to meet with the teachers’ union at any time and looks forward to continuing our efforts to reach an agreement with OEA … We will continue to do everything possible to avoid a work stoppage.”\n\n“Our children’s education does not need to be interrupted by negotiations with our union, especially given the major offer the District made on Monday,” other district press statements said. “We are committed to continuing to work with our labor leaders to discuss their salaries and support services for our students without the need for a strike.”\n\nOUSD’s latest salary proposal, released this week, includes a 10% raise retroactive to Nov. 1, 2022, and a $5,000, one-time payment to all members.\n\nOEA’s recent salary proposal asked for a 10% retroactive raise to all members, a one-time $10,000 payment to members who return for the 2023-2024 school year, and increases from $7,500 to $10,000 to salaries, based on years of experience.\n\nIn addition to pay demands, OEA is making “common good” proposals that serve families and the community, including protecting and enhancing special education programs, putting the brakes on closing schools in flatland neighborhoods, shared school leadership, safety, and support for students.\n\nOakland Post"
