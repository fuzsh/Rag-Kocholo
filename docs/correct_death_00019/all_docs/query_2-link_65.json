        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nThe Cahuenga Pass connects the Los Angeles Basin to the San Fernando Valley and is the lowest pass through the mountains. It was the site of two major battles, the Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1831 (a fight between local settlers and the Mexican-appointed governor and his men, two deaths), and the Battle of Providencia or Second Battle of Cahuenga Pass in 1845 (between locals over whether to secede from Mexico. One horse and one mule killed). Both battles were on the San Fernando Valley side near present-day Studio City, and cannonballs are still occasionally found during excavations in the area. Along the route of the historic El Camino Real, the historic significance of the pass is also marked by a marker along Cahuenga Boulevard which names the area as Paseo de Cahuenga.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nSunset Boulevard was dedicated in 1888. Earlier called Bellevue Street--and with some small sections called Short, Bread and Marchessault streets (after Mayor Damien Marchessault)--it started on U.S. Sen. Cornelius Cole's hill in what is now Hollywood, which afforded a fine view of the sunset over the Pacific. By 1937, 11 streets in Hollywood were named after the Cole family.\n\nGower Avenue was dedicated in 1893. Named because it ran along the west side of the ranch belonging to George T. Gower. California's first films were made on the corner of Gower and Sunset Boulevard in 1911.^*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nHarvey Henderson Wilcox, the first subdivider of Hollywood, used as its name the suggestion made by his wife, Daeida. They had purchased 160 acres in 1886, which they subsequently subdivided and sold. (Prospect Avenue was the original name for Hollywood Blvd., and Weyse Avenue was the original name for Vine Street.)*\n\nThe name Hollywood was originally coined by H. J. Whitley, the \"Father of Hollywood\".Â Whitley arranged to buy the 500-acre E. C. Hurd ranch and disclosed to him his plans for the land. They agreed on a price and Hurd agreed to sell at a later date. Before Whitley got off the ground with Hollywood, plans for the new town had spread to General Harrison Gray Otis, Mr. Hurd's wife, Mrs. Daeida Wilcox, and numerous others through the mill of gossip and land speculation. (per Wikipedia)\n\nDaeida learned of the name Hollywood from her neighbor in Holly Canyon (now Lake Hollywood), Ivar Weid, a prominent investor and friend of Whitley's. She recommended the same name to her husband, H. H. Wilcox. On February 1, 1887, Harvey filed a deed and map of property he sold with the Los Angeles County Recorder's office. Harvey wanted to be the first to record it on a deed. The early real-estate boom busted that same year, yet Hollywood began its slow growth. (per Wikipedia)\n\nA 2ND version about the naming of Hollywood: Â “Regarding H.J. Whitley’s Â coining the name, Whitley's great-granddaughter Gaelyn Whitney Keith invented this story out of whole cloth. (She wrote a \"biography\" of Whitley that reads like a romance novel.) Loads of old newspapers very clearly place H.J. Whitley in North Dakota throughout 1886-1887. He later moved to Oklahoma and didn't come to L.A. until 1894 â seven years after the Wilcoxes named Hollywood. So the whole story of Whitley trying to buy 500 acres from E.C. Hurd in 1886, then the Wilcoxes stealing the \"Hollywood\" name before Whitley could close the deal, is bunk, blarney, B.S. It's shameful that Ms. Keith has spread this lie around the internet, just to sell her book.” *\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn the mid-1880s, H.J. Whitley arrived in Southern California. He was well known as a land developer and many tried to follow on his coattails. As president and major shareholder of the Los Angeles Pacific Boulevard and Development Company, he orchestrated the building of the Hollywood Hotel, the opening of the Ocean View Tract and construction of a Bank which were located on the corners of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland.\n\nBesides his land developments, Whitley was also the President of the National Loan & Trust Company, Guthrie, Oklahoma, Vice President of Home Savings Bank, President of First National Bank of Van Nuys, State Bank of Owensmouth and Bank of Lankershim; General Manager of the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, principal in the Bank of Hollywood, The Whitley Land Company and owner of the H.J. Whitley Company jewelry store.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Glen-Holly Hotel was constructed in 1895 on Ivar Avenue at Yucca Street and is the 2nd hotel to be built in Hollywood (after the Sackett Hotel, 1888).Â It was built by Joakim Berg, a noted artist of the 1890s in the region. At its opening it had 20 rooms and one bath. A horse carriage called a tallyho took guests from downtown LA to the hotel.\n\nThe original owner, Mr. Charles M. Pierce, also became the operator of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad's Balloon Route in 1904, the line opened in September 1901. The hotel was a stop on the line going from downtown Los Angeles to West Los Angeles and the beaches on the west side. The Balloon Route used the hotel as lunch stop.\n\nD. L. Allen later took over management of the Glen-Holly Tavern. He added billiard hall, bowling alley, and livery service.\n\nIt became a landmark of the area, though was later demolished. *^"
