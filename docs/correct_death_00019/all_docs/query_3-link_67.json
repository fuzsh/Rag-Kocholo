        "text": "Songwriters’ Guide is a new concert subscription that pays tribute to the top songwriters of history. These major names added musical colour to Broadway and Hollywood, and created the timeless classics of the Great American Songbook. This concert shines the spotlight on Cole Porter, creator of musicals such as Kiss Me, Kate, and hits like I Get a Kick Out of You, What Is This Thing Called Love? and Let's Misbehave. In the glow of jazz, we will be guided through his life with music, history and anecdotes.\n\nPeter Asplund – trumpet player, vocalist, composer – will lead, together with his trio Aspiration with Hans Andersson on bass and Johan Löfcrantz Ramsay on drums. Two guests participate in each portrait concert, and here we will meet singer Veronica Mortensen, acclaimed for her vocal elegance and charismatic stage presence, and pianist Claes Crona, one of Sweden’s most renowned jazz musicians.\n\nCole Porter was born in 1891 in the city of Peru, Indiana, and died in 1964 in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California. Thanks to a wealthy relative, he was able to study law and music at Harvard. After joining the French army during World War I, he spent the 1920s in Paris. In 1930 he moved back to the US, to New York, but he was always a Parisian at heart.\n\nSongwriters’ Guide is a new concert subscription that pays tribute to the top songwriters of history.
