        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Ashley Judd is still limping from a foot injury she suffered in February while starring in the Broadway revival of \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.\" But a sore foot isn't slowing her down.\n\nDuring an interview to promote her newest movie, \"De-Lovely,\" Judd is like an antsy cat. She jumps up repeatedly to take care of various tasks around her hotel suite, from closing a balcony door, to retrieving her PDA from a handbag, to herding her two cockapoos, Shug and Buttermilk, into a sitting area.\n\n\"Would you like a piece of cake?\" she offers, jumping up yet again and hobbling over to a dresser where an appetizing dessert sits.\n\n\"It's genuinely a delicious, old-fashioned-style chocolate cake,\" she cajoles. \"So often you get, like, a raspberry chocolate mousse, which is not what I consider to be a good piece of chocolate cake.\"\n\nDoesn't an actress have to resist those kinds of fattening indulgences?\n\n\"I eat so much that it's fairly disgusting,\" the 36-year-old Judd responds with a wave of her hand.\n\nActually, she's working with a personal trainer to get back into top shape. She'd gained a few pounds for her Broadway role then, after undergoing surgery to repair torn ligaments in her foot, spent two months sitting idle, unable to partake in her usual exercise regimen.\n\nBut now she is on the path to recovery and traveling to major cities around the country promoting \"De-Lovely,\" a highly stylized musical based on the life of 20th century composer Cole Porter (played by Kevin Kline) and his wife and muse, Linda (Judd).\n\nThe film spans nearly 40 years, jumping from Paris to Venice to New York to Hollywood, and includes more than 30 of Porter's 800 songs. Many of them are performed by top recording artists, including Natalie Cole, Alanis Morissette, Sheryl Crow, Robbie Williams, Elvis Costello and Diana Krall.\n\nThe musical, directed by veteran filmmaker Irwin Winkler, explores the posh couple's unusual relationship. Porter, who was gay, was promiscuous yet had an unshakeable love for his wife. And she in turn was completely dedicated to him.\n\n\"I always wanted to play somebody rich,\" says Judd, who has played a wide range of roles, including a young Marilyn Monroe, throughout her 11-year career. \"I mean, I own a home, a car, and have health insurance, but Linda was rich-rich,\" she adds, her eyes widening.\n\nIndeed, Cole and Linda Porter owned several houses and estates in Europe and the U.S. throughout their 38-year-marriage, which ended with her death from cancer in 1954.\n\nMostly, though, it was the couple's unconventional love story that attracted Judd to the part. \"Cole loved her authentically for who she was, and as important as sex is, it doesn't have to be the cornerstone of every enduring human relationship,\" she observes.\n\nJudd did as much research as she could on Linda Porter, a divorcee who married Porter even though she was aware of his homosexuality. She stayed with him despite his infidelity. Linda saw genius in Porter's music. She encouraged him and connected him with people who would buy his songs.\n\nWinkler, who previously directed Kline in \"Life as a House,\" considered other actresses for the role but says Judd most closely resembled his ideal of Linda Porter.\n\nJudd grew up in a musical family. Her mother, Naomi, and sister, Wynonna, performed as the country duo, the Judds, before illness forced Naomi to retire. But \"De-Lovely\" marks the first time in Ashley's professional career that she was called upon to sing.\n\n\"I wasn't smart enough to have apprehension about it, but I had a healthy enough ego to think that I could do it reasonably well, if not good,\" she says.\n\nJudd had little time to prepare for her two duets in the film -- \"In the Still of the Night,\" with Kline, and \"True Love,\" with Taylor Hamilton, who plays the daughter of a close family friend.\n\nShe was nervous on the day she arrived on the set in London to shoot her song with Kline. \"My knees where knocking,\" she recalls.\n\nKline insisted that the songs be sung live rather than prerecorded. Though caught off-guard, Judd gamely obliged. \"I am nothing if not supportive of the creative people in my life,\" she insists. \"He was the alpha male and he wanted to do it live. And, by golly, I wanted to do it live for him.\"\n\nDemonstrating her support for the film, Judd even agreed to sing again at \"De-Lovely's\" Cannes premiere. But don't expect Judd to quit her day job.\n\nThough born in Southern California, Judd was raised in Kentucky. She is proud of her Eastern Kentuckian heritage, which goes back eight generations.\n\nInstead of following her mother and sister into the music business, Judd decided to forge her own path. She graduated with honors from the University of Kentucky, majoring in French. She subsequently studied acting for several years. Judd first proved her acting abilities in her 1993 debut feature film, \"Ruby in Paradise.\" Other film roles include \"Smoke,\" \"Heat,\" \"Where the Heart Is,\" \"Frida,\" \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" and \"Double Jeopardy.\"\n\nA strong Southern woman herself, Judd often plays tough, intelligent women with a crack of vulnerability. She most recently was seen in the thriller \"Twisted,\" playing an alcoholic cop struggling with inner demons. Previously, she starred in \"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,\" playing a troubled Southern belle.\n\nShe has twice been paired with fellow Southerner Morgan Freeman -- in the 1997 suspense thriller \"Kiss the Girls\" and five years later in \"High Crimes.\" The two recently bumped into each other at the Indianapolis 500 -- both are racing enthusiasts -- and briefly discussed teaming up on another movie project. Judd spends a lot of her free time at the track ever since she met and married race car driver Dario Franchitti. (The two, who met on a blind date, married in December 2001. )\n\n\"I kept saying to this woman who set us up that all of my sports brain cells were devoted to Kentucky basketball and I didn't want to take on another sport, but she would come to work and say Dario won his race again this weekend,' \" she recalls. \"It was like, 'that's cool,' and she said he's one of the best at what he does, and I found that intriguing.\"\n\nJudd says she admires her husband as someone who has a relationship with his gift. She spends her summers traveling the racing circuit with him and he occasionally joins her on location for her movies. The couple does not have children yet, but Judd is not ruling it out. She says she leaves it in God's hands.\n\nMeanwhile, the brunette beauty is weighing what to do next. Whatever she does, it will have to wait until she finishes a trip to Cambodia and Thailand in July.\n\n\"There are a few scripts that I like -- three. The rest of it, ugh,\" she says with exasperation."
