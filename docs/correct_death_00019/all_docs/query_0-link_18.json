        "text": "Cole Porter was born into a wealthy family on June 9th 1891 in Peru, Indiana and died on October 16th 1964 in Santa Monica, California. Cole began his musical interests by taking violin lessons at the age of six, and piano lessons at the age of eight. Cole composed an operetta at the age of ten, and published his first composition, a waltz, at the age of eleven.\n\nCole composed almost three hundred songs while enrolled at Yale University in 1913. He later went on to study at Harvard Law School in 1914, and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in music 1915-1916. He made his first Broadway musical comedy See America First in 1916, but only went on to have 15 performances of it. Porter went to France in 1917 after the United States entered World War 1. Although Porter was openly homosexual, he went on to marry a divorcee, Linda Lee Thomas, in 1919, who spent the next 20 years together partying.\n\nCole Porter composed songs, both musical and with words for over 30 musicals for both theater and film, his best works setting the standards for both sophistication and wit in songs. Some of Cole's songs still hold some relevance in our time, his song \"Anything Goes\" Appearing in the 2008 game Fallout 3, the 2015 game Fallout 4, and the 2018 game Fallout 76. His song \"You're the Top\" appeared in the 2007 game BioShock."
