        "text": "Cole Porter (born June 9, 1891, Peru, Indiana, U.S.—died October 15, 1964, Santa Monica, California) was an American composer and lyricist who brought a worldly élan to the American musical and who embodied in his life the sophistication of his songs.\n\nPorter was the grandson of a millionaire speculator, and the moderately affluent circumstances of his life probably contributed to the poise and urbanity of his musical style. He began violin study at the age of six and piano at eight; he composed an operetta in the style of Gilbert and Sullivan at 10 and saw his first composition, a waltz, published a year later. As a student at Yale University (B.A., 1913), he composed about 300 songs, including “Eli,” “Bulldog,” and “Bingo Eli Yale,” and wrote college shows; later he studied at Harvard Law School (1914) and Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in music (1915–16). He made his Broadway debut with the musical comedy See America First (1916), which, however, closed after 15 performances.\n\nIn 1917, after the United States entered World War I, Porter went to France. (He was not, as later reported, in French military service.) He became an itinerant playboy in Europe and, though rather openly homosexual, married a wealthy older American divorcée, Linda Lee Thomas, on December 18, 1919. They spent the next two decades in lively partying and social traveling, sometimes together, sometimes apart.\n\nIn 1928 Porter composed several songs for the Broadway success Paris, and this led to a string of hit musical comedies, including Fifty Million Frenchmen (1929), Gay Divorcée (1932), Anything Goes (1934), Red, Hot and Blue (1934), Jubilee (1935), Dubarry Was a Lady (1939), Panama Hattie (1940), Kiss Me, Kate (1948, based on William Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew), Can-Can (1953), and Silk Stockings (1955). He concurrently worked on a number of motion pictures.\n\nOver the years, Porter wrote such glittering songs and lyrics as “Night and Day,” “I Get a Kick Out of You,” “Begin the Beguine,” “I’ve Got You Under My Skin,” “In the Still of the Night,” “Just One of Those Things,” “Love for Sale,” “My Heart Belongs to Daddy,” “Too Darn Hot,” “It’s Delovely,” “I Concentrate on You,” “Always True to You in My Fashion,” and “I Love Paris.” He was especially adept at the catalog song, his best-known efforts being “Let’s Do It” and “You’re the Top.”"
