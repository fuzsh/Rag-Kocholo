        "text": "On June 9th, 1891, 128 years ago today, composer Cole Porter was born in Peru, Indiana.\n\nHe wrote songs that became Broadway and movie mainstays ... songs rich in sophisticated and witty lyrics. Among them, \"Let's Do It\":\n\nBirds do it, bees do it\n\nEven educated fleas do it\n\nLet's do it, let's fall in love\n\n\"Anything Goes\"\n\nIn olden days, a glimpse of stocking\n\nWas looked on as something shocking.\n\nBut now, God knows,\n\nAnything goes.\n\n\"Night and Day\"\n\nNight and day, you are the one\n\nOnly you beneath the moon or under the sun\n\nWhether near to me or far\n\nIt's no matter, darling, where you are\n\nI think of you\n\nNight and day\n\n\"Just One of Those Things\"\n\nSo goodbye, dear, and Amen\n\nHere's hoping we'll meet now and then\n\nIt was great fun\n\nBut it was just one of those things\n\nAnd \"You're the Top\"\n\nYou're the Nile, You're the Tow'r of Pisa,\n\nYou're the smile on the Mona Lisa.\n\nI'm a worthless check, a total wreck, a flop,\n\nBut if, Baby, I'm the bottom,\n\nYou're the top!\n\nA gay man in an oppressive time, Porter took refuge in a years-long marriage of convenience with the wealthy (and tolerant) socialite Linda Lee Thomas.\n\nAnd a horse-riding accident led to years of operations and the eventual amputation of a leg.\n\nStill, nothing can take away from the Tonys Porter won in 1949 for the musical \"Kiss Me, Kate,\" the current revival of which just happens to be up for Tony honors tonight.\n\nCole Porter died in 1964 at the age of 73, but all these years later he still is, dare we say it, \"The Top.\"\n\nFor more info:\n\ncoleporter.org\n\n\"Kiss Me, Kate\" at Studio 54, New York City (through June 30) | Ticket information"
