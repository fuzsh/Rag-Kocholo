He is the son of Samuel Fenwick Porter and Kate Cole. He passed away in 1864. [1]\n\nCole Porter was an American songwriter famous for his witty lyrics and for imaginative melodies. He showed an early talent for music and had a song published when he was 11 years old. Several more of his songs were published while he was a student at Yale and Harvard universities... Porter's most popular songs include: Let's Do It Let's Fall in Love, You Do Something to Me, Night and Day, Anything Goes, I Get a Kick Out of You, You're the Top, Begin the Beguine, Just One of Those Things, I've Got You Under My Skin, In the Still of the Night, and I Love Paris.\n\nHe used the life of wealthy people as the theme for many of his musicals, many of which were turned into films. These shows include: Paris (1928), Fifty Million Frenchmen (1929), Gay Divorce (1932), Anything Goes (1934), Rosalie (1937), Mexican Hayride (1943), The Pirate (1947), Kiss Me Kate (19448), Can Can (1953), High Society (1955), Les Girls (1956), among others.\n\nAlthough Porter was often photographed in the arms of beautiful women and was married for 34 years to Linda (Lee) Thomas who conceived and miscarried, some believe that he was more homosexual than bisexual. The couple separated briefly in the early 1930s when, it is believed, Porter's sexual orientation became more and more open during their time living in Hollywood. In 1937, Porter injured his legs severely in a horseback-riding accident. He was confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life. After the injury, Linda was reunited with her husband.\n\nSources\n\nâ†‘ Entered by Bob Fields, Apr 19, 2012\n\nSee also:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter\n\nFind A Grave: Cole Albert Porter\n\nhttp://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=46403&id=I17284\n\nThis WikiTree profile is referenced from Wikidata: Item Q215120, en:Wikipedia"
