        "text": "If you know anything about music, or if you know anything about Indiana, you've heard of composer and songwriter Cole Porter.\n\nPorter has been dead more than 60 years, but his music lives on. The musical \"De-Lovely\" is based on Porter's life.\n\nHis most popular musical, \"Kiss Me, Kate,\" ran for 1,077 performances in New York and 400 in London. It won the first Tony Award for Best Musical. Porter won for best composer and lyricist.\n\nPorter was born June 9, 1891, in Peru to a wealthy family. When he was sent to Worcester Academy in Massachusetts in 1905, Porter took an upright piano with him.\n\nAt Yale University, Porter was a member of a number of musical groups, including the Whiffenpoofs, an a cappella group. In his senior year, he was elected president of the Yale Glee Club and was its principal soloist. He wrote 300 songs at Yale, including the football fight songs \"Bulldog\" and \"Bingo Eli Yale,\" also known as \"Bingo, That's the Lingo!\"\n\nIn 1917, when the United States entered World War I, Porter moved to Paris. he maintained a luxury apartment and held wild parties.\n\nIt was in 1928, at age 36, when Porter had his first hit Broadway musical, \"Paris.\" Among the songs were \"Let's Misbehave\" and \"Let's Do It.\"\n\n\"The New Yorkers,\" in 1930, featured the song, \"Love for Sale.\" \"Gay Divorce,\" Fred Astaire's last stage show, in 1932, featured the still-popular song, \"Night and Day.\" \"Anything Goes,\" in 1934, was another hit.\n\nThe soundtrack of \"Anything Goes\" has several songs that will get you singing, including \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" \"All Through the Night,\" \"You're the Top,\" \"Blow, Gabriel, Blow\" and, of course, \"Anything Goes.\"\n\nPorter wrote a number of other familiar songs for shows in the 1930s, including, \"Begin the Beguine,\" \"It's De-Lovely,\" \"In the Still of the Night,\" \"Don't Fence Me In,\" \"My Heart Belongs to Daddy,\" \"Do I Love You?\" and more.\n\nAlso occurring in the 1930s was the riding accident that changed his life. He was riding with Countess Edith di Zoppola and Duke Fulco di Verdura in Locust Valley, New York, when his horse fell on him, crushing his legs and leaving him crippled.\n\nIn 1948, Porter's hit musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" debuted.
