        "text": "On October 24, 1937, Cole Porter went out for a horseback ride at the Piping Rock Club, in Locust Valley, Long Island—one of those swank playgrounds whose names he liked to rhyme in song and which signalled his fully paid-up membership in the Elegentsia. In the woods, the skittish horse, which the forty-six-year-old Porter had been warned against riding, shied and fell on him, crushing both his legs. According to Porter—a story that William McBrien, the author of “Cole Porter: A Biography” (1998), finds “difficult to believe”—he passed the excruciating hours while he waited to be rescued composing the lyrics to an elusive verse of his song “At Long Last Love.”\n\nThe moment was pivotal in Porter’s life; so, too, was his recounting of it. The lyrics to “At Long Last Love” are, of course, exquisite—“Is it an earthquake or simply a shock? / Is it the good turtle soup or merely the mock? / Is it a cocktail, this feeling of joy? / Or is what I feel the real McCoy?”—but Porter’s talent for masquerade, for turning life’s griefs and glories into an impudent game, didn’t end there. In gruelling pain for decades after the accident, forced to walk with braces and canes, he nonetheless had the humor to give his lame legs names: the left he christened Josephine, the right Geraldine, “a hellion, a bitch, a psychopath.” Even at the end of his life, his apartment at the Waldorf Towers, in New York, was decorated with an embroidered pillow that advised, in French, “Don’t Explain—Don’t Complain.”\n\nPorter’s entire life was built around the act of decoying his depths. From the moment in 1905 when the elfin fourteen-year-old from a powerful lumber and mining family in Peru, Indiana—the pampered and only surviving one of three siblings—arrived at Worcester Academy, in Massachusetts, with his paintings and an upright piano for his dorm room, he cast himself as a kind of dandy. The dandy’s strategy is to combine daring with tact, flamboyance with distance. Instead of breaking the rules, Porter learned to play with them. “At boarding school I was always taught,” he wrote in “I’m in Love,” “not to reveal what I really thought, / Nor ever once let my eyes betray / The dreadful things I longed to say.” At Yale, where he had a sensational undergraduate career, his salmon-colored ties, his slick, center-parted hair, and his manicured nails broadcast his privilege and his rebellion. “Porter did not fit easily into the social mold of a Yale man,” his friend Gerald Murphy, who engineered Porter’s entry into the most raucous of Yale fraternities, ΔKE, said. Still, music made a place for him on campus, allowing him both to tease the mainstream and to join it. He composed “Bull Dog” and “Bingo Eli Yale,” football anthems that are still played today; he wrote his first musical, “Cora” (1911); he was a member of the Whiffenpoofs, Yale’s most prestigious singing group, and the president of the Glee Club. Behind a piano, delivering his mischievous lyrics in a high-pitched, metallic voice—“I sing unpleasantly,” he once said—Porter could confess and, at the same time, mask his feelings, keeping the world both engaged and at arm’s length.\n\nFor the best part of his adulthood, Porter organized life so that his effervescent music and his emollient lyrics preceded him into a room. Manners defined the man and his songs, imposing on both a meticulous and elegant symmetry. Slim and courtly, the five-foot-seven Porter had black doe eyes and a burnished baby face, whose smoothness he enhanced by shaving twice a day. “You might describe me as a cross between Eddie Cantor and the Duke of Windsor,” he said. His assault on American puritanism—what Gilbert Seldes called “the habits-ofrabbits school of songwriting”—rarely transgressed the bounds of propriety, deploying etiquette even as it mocked it. “If you’re swimming at Newport with some old leech,” he wrote, “And he wrestles you while you’re wet, / Don’t call him a son of a Bailey’s Beach, / It ain’t smart, / It ain’t chic, / It ain’t etiquette.”\n\nPropriety, however, bred boredom. Porter’s songs are passionate, playful, and immediately accessible; he, by contrast, was slow to kindle. “People who meet Cole Porter for the first time often find his personality baffling,” Margaret Case Harriman wrote in her 1940 Profile of him for this magazine. “He is by turns pensive, nervous, mercurial, and polite. When he is interested or amused, he talks with a rush of words which betrays him into a slight lisp. . . . At other times his air of boredom verges on the spectacular.” “Poor Young Millionaire,” written in the twenties, when Porter was living in gala style in Europe, spelled out his deep-seated ennui. (Because Porter had dropped out of Harvard Law School to dedicate himself to music, his tyrannical grandfather, J. O. Cole, disinherited him; his mother, however, gave him half of her own four-million-dollar bequest.) “I’m tired of betting, / Tired of sporting, / Tired of flirting, / Tired of courting, . . . / Tired of being / Tired, tired, tired.” Songwriting was Porter’s antidote to the entropy of self-indulgence. “He worked around the clock,” Moss Hart, who collaborated with Porter on “Jubilee” (1935), said. “He used work as a weapon to shield himself from a boredom whose threshold was extremely low. He could withdraw and disappear before one’s eyes with an almost sinister facility.”\n\nTo see Porter clearly—the full audacity of his lightness and brightness—one must view him against the dowdy gravity of the America into which he emerged, in 1932, a country lumbered by the Depression, Prohibition, and social upheaval. Although Porter had had three variable outings on Broadway in the twenties (“Greenwich Village Follies,” in 1924, “Paris,” in 1928, and “Wake Up and Dream,” in 1929), the thirties were the decade when he came into his own, with ten musicals for the stage and two for Hollywood. “You could follow a progression from Jerome Kern to Dick Rodgers to Gershwin,” the lyricist Alan Jay Lerner said. “But Cole seemed to spring like Jupiter from Minerva’s head—all made. What he did was so special and . . . unexplainable that he is really of them all, in a strange way, the most irreplaceable.”\n\nAt a time when prosperity was imperilled, Porter—with his valets, his sixteen dressing gowns, his Art Deco Paris house, with zebra rugs on marble floors, his Venetian palace, where he composed in a ballroom hung with Tiepolos—personified the myth of American abundance. Unlike the other Broadway music-makers, he didn’t aspire to be wealthy; he simply was, to use his term, “rich-rich.” He was also an unrepentant hedonist; his songs conveyed an exhilarating wonder at the world’s plenitude. In “You’re the Top,” for instance, he conjured up an eclectic picture of the American cornucopia: a Bendel bonnet, Mickey Mouse, Garbo’s salary, cellophane, a turkey dinner, the Derby winner, a Waldorf salad, the feet of Fred Astaire, an O’Neill drama, Whistler’s mama, and so on. This yoking together of high and low culture was part of Porter’s sumptuous impertinence—and a pop landscape new to the musical.\n\nPorter’s Broadway cohorts were mostly striving middle-class Jewish New Yorkers who took their inspiration from jazz and from the city’s momentum. Porter, in his attitudes and his influences, was essentially European. After the spectacular failure of his 1916 Broadway début, “See America First,” he lived abroad for nearly two decades. The memory of his travels in those years surfaces in the rhythms of his songs. “What Is This Thing Called Love?” and “Night and Day” grew out of strains of Moroccan music; he discovered the offbeat of “Begin the Beguine” while watching a native dance in the Dutch East Indies; the fast-paced wit of the popular songs performed in Paris boîtes worked its way into Porter’s “list songs”—a style that he originated and which was, according to its creator, “the tinpantithesis of poetry.”\n\nPorter’s songs evoked an adult existence—a world of pleasure, travel, wealth, and promiscuity. They goosed and seduced society; part of their frisson was their composer’s antic impulse to put it ever so gently to his high-society friends. In “I’m Dining with Elsa,” the flamboyant, beefy hostess Elsa Maxwell, who was at the center of Porter’s deluxe crowd, got this jolt: “I’ve got Bromo Seltzer / To take when dinner ends, / For I’m dining with Elsa / And her ninety-nine most intimate friends!” But the songs’ driving force was something else. Each of the great masters of the Broadway lyric had his source of special inspiration: Lorenz Hart had loneliness; E. Y. Harburg had Marxism; Oscar Hammerstein II had optimism; Ira Gershwin had his brother; Porter had sex. His songs glorified “the sweetness of sin,” and were dished up with what Kenneth Tynan called his “bedside wit.” Of the great lyricists, only Porter could have written, “I’d love to make a tour of you / The eyes, the arms, the mouth of you, / The east, west, north, and the south of you.” “Night and Day,” “Begin the Beguine,” “In the Still of the Night,” “So in Love,” and “I’ve Got You Under My Skin”—his most famous ballads—show off Porter’s sultry emotional power. He didn’t want just to invoke love; he wanted to taste it.\n\nIn the arena of relationships, Porter was bracingly laissez-faire. With songs such as “Let’s Misbehave” and “Please Don’t Make Me Be Good,” he counselled pragmatism of the heart, not idealism. He was, as Alan Jay Lerner quipped, “a homosexual who had never seen the closet”—“Anything Goes” was his motto, as well as his hit. In “Experiment,” he wrote, “Be curious, / Though interfering friends may frown. / Get furious / At each attempt to hold you down.” Porter was not above winking indirectly at his own appetite for a bit of rough. “Find me a primitive man / Built to a primitive plan,” he wrote in a song for the show “Fifty Million Frenchmen” (1929). “I don’t mean the kind that belongs to a club, / But the kind that has a club that belongs to him.” His lyrics are often full of distinctly phallic fun. In “Brush Up Your Shakespeare,” he joked, “When your baby is pleading for pleasure / Let her sample your ‘Measure for Measure.’ ” But like Casanova, whom he sang about in “Nymph Errant” (1933), Porter was also “a human stove”; when he was actually in love, the blasé postures of his wit abandoned him. In song, he was cool; in life, he burned. “The only thing I really want to do is climb to the top of the bell tower and announce to the piazza that I’m desperately in love,” he wrote to the dancer Boris Kochno, in 1925. “I love you so much that I think only of you—I see only you and I dream only of the moment when we’ll be reunited.”\n\nPorter’s homosexuality is the news at the center of Irwin Winkler’s latest film, “De-Lovely,” which stars Kevin Kline as Porter and Ashley Judd as Linda, his wife of thirty-five years, and which manages somehow to tell Porter’s story without any of the three stylistic ingredients that defined him: rhythm, elegance, and wit. Hollywood’s first stab at the subject, “Night and Day” (1946), with Cary Grant, made no reference to Porter’s sexuality. In “De-Lovely,” Porter’s preference is shown as a problematic and regrettable intrusion on his abiding romantic attachment to his wife. There is some truth to this approach, but not enough.\n\nTall, blond, with deep-blue eyes, Linda Lee Porter was a famous Southern beauty. At seventeen, she had married the newspaper mogul Edward R. Thomas, whose empire included the New York Morning Telegraph. Eleven unhappy years later, she divorced the sadistic Thomas—the first American ever to have killed anyone with an automobile—and the settlement made her a wealthy woman. When she married Porter, in 1919, he was twenty-eight and she was thirty-six. Linda gave her ambitious young companion access to all of Europe’s grandees. She was smart and supportive; he was a live wire who needed connections. Together, they formed an adoring partnership, a companionate marriage. But to the aesthete Bernard Berenson, a confidant of Linda’s, who saw the newlyweds on their honeymoon, Porter was “a little music man fifteen years younger.” (It’s a barometer of Porter’s boyishness that Berenson overstated the age difference by seven years.) She “has nearly worn herself out going at his rattling pace,” he added. “I saw their future in the blackest terms.”\n\n“De-Lovely” makes the opposite of Berenson’s mistake: it portrays Linda as significantly younger than Porter, a miscasting that completely skews Porter’s psychosexual reality. The film turns Linda into a romantic object when, in fact, she was a maternal one. Like Porter’s devoted mother, Linda believed in his talent. At first, according to Gerald Murphy, she “rather hoped he would devote himself to serious music.” She wrote to Arnold Bennett, Bernard Shaw, and John Galsworthy for librettos from which her husband might compose an opera, and she invited Igor Stravinsky to the Riviera to instruct her husband in harmony and composition. “She goaded me along,” Porter said. He invested Linda with a sort of parental authority, even going so far as to seek her approval of his lovers. “You made a friend today—it was Linda,” he wrote to Kochno. “I don’t know how to tell you how grateful I am—you did it. And that makes everything much easier.”\n\n“Marriage excuses no one the freak’s roll call,” the playwright Joe Orton wrote; Porter certainly proved this point. Although “De-Lovely” tries to depict Porter as bisexual, he was an avid member of the brotherhood. (Linda evidently had a miscarriage early in their relationship, but if it had occurred when the film positions it she’d have been in her fifties.) On their world junkets, “les Coleporteurs” travelled with a largely male entourage. At the Waldorf Towers, they lived in separate apartments; at their estate in Williamstown, Linda occupied the main house and Porter a small house nearby, which he dubbed “No Trespassing.” The marriage, as Brendan Gill delicately put it in “Cole,” was “not without intermittent warfare and cobbled-up truces.” The couple fought primarily over Porter’s increasingly reckless sexual escapades and his disregard of the “good form” of their heterosexual masquerade, which humiliated Linda and, inevitably, created a distance between them. “Porter had needs he could not satisfy with Linda, not only sexual needs but social ones as well,” William McBrien writes of Porter’s mature years. “He could not, for instance, discuss the beauty of young males. Nor could he lament to her about living without an intimate companion—a man with whom he might have shared a home.” Linda was the darlin’ to whom Porter was, as he memorably wrote, always true in his fashion.\n\nIn “De-Lovely,” the masterly Kevin Kline invests Porter with a whiff of emotional complexity that the script doesn’t earn. Porter’s songs, however, do earn it. Many of his melodies, written in haunting minor keys, express a palpable sadness that his public persona kept hidden. “The thrill when we meet / Is so bittersweet / That, darling, it’s getting me down,” he wrote in “Get Out of Town.” In “Down in the Depths,” he noted, “Why, even the janitor’s wife / Has a perfectly good love life / And here am I / Facing tomorrow / Alone with my sorrow.” Promiscuity and songwriting were Porter’s antidepressants, at once an expression of and a relief from his neediness—the “oh, such a hungry, yearning burning inside of me” that he wrote about in “Night and Day.”\n\nPorter seems never to have found the love that he eloquently invoked in song after song. In 1951, battered by pain, he had shock treatment for depression. In 1954, Linda died of emphysema. In 1958, after some thirty operations, his right leg was finally amputated. It was “a cruel decision to have to make and involves much sex vanity and many fears of being repellent,” Noël Coward wrote, after visiting Porter in the hospital. “Wouldn’t It Be Fun,” written for a 1958 TV production of “Aladdin,” was Porter’s last song, and it carries a bitter autobiographical aftertaste: “Wouldn’t it be fun not to be famous, / Wouldn’t it be fun not to be rich! / . . . Wouldn’t it be fun to be nearly anyone / Except me, mighty me!”\n\nPorter survived another six years, but, when his music—that lifelong attempt to forestall the immanence of emptiness—stopped, he stopped, too. “He was terribly uninterested,” Diana Vreeland wrote. “He just couldn’t get up the old interest to do anything . . . and then he stopped speaking.” Music was how Porter had negotiated life and created it around him. “Old songs are more than tunes,” the playwright Ben Hecht said. “They are little houses in which our hearts once lived.” In that sense, Porter was one of the great architects of the twentieth century. We still happily inhabit the pleasure palaces he built for us. He manufactured joy, that rarest of commodities, with which he excused everything, even himself. ♦"
