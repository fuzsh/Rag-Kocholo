        "text": "Four-time Grammy Award Winner Stanley Clarke has attained “living legend” status during his over 50-year career as a bass virtuoso. He is the first bassist in history who doubles on acoustic and electric bass with equal ferocity and the first jazz-fusion bassist ever to headline tours, selling out shows worldwide. A veteran of over 40 albums, he won the 2011 Best Contemporary Jazz Album Grammy Award for The Stanley Clarke Band. Clarke co-founded the seminal fusion group Return to Forever with Chick Corea and Lenny White. In 2012 Return to Forever won a Grammy Award and Latin Grammy for Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Forever.\n\nClarke’s creativity has been recognized and rewarded in every way imaginable: gold and platinum records, Grammy Awards, Emmy nominations, virtually every readers and critics poll in existence, and more. In 2022 Clarke was selected by the National Endowment for the Arts as one of its four new Jazz Master honorees. This is the highest honor that the United States bestows on jazz artists. He also was Rolling Stone’s very first Jazzman of the Year and bassist winner of Playboy’s Music Award for ten straight years. Clarke was honored with Bass Player Magazine’s Lifetime Achievement Award and is a member of Guitar Player Magazine’s “Gallery of Greats.” In 2004 he was featured in Los Angeles Magazine as one of the Top 50 Most Influential People. He was honored with the key to the city of Philadelphia and put his hands in cement as a 1999 inductee into Hollywood’s “Rock Walk” on Sunset Boulevard. In 2011 he was honored with the highly prestigious Miles Davis Award at the Montreal Jazz Festival for his entire body of work. Clarke has won Downbeat Magazine’s Reader’s and Critics Poll for Best Electric Bass Player for many years. In September 2016 he became a part of the permanent collection displayed at the Smithsonian’s new National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) in Washington DC.\n\nClarke is touring domestically and internationally in 2023 with Stanley Clarke N•4EVER. Members of the band include Jahari Stampley (Piano / Keys),Emilio Modeste (Sax), Jeremiah Collier (Drums), Colin Cook (Guitar), Stanley Clarke (Bass).\n\nUnable to tour most of 2020, Clarke’s Pandemic work has involved developing his web series, Stanley Clarke’s Bass Nation. The series premiered November 2020. The project is about the dynamics of the music industry, recording and performing, and includes Stanley’s conversations with noted musicians, gear reviews, play-throughs and performances.\n\nHis most recent album release is music he composed for the 2019 documentary, Halston. Stanley’s Halston soundtrack was release on Node Records\n\nIn 2018 Clarke’s band CD, The Message, was released on Mack Avenue Records.. Including compositions from his young band members, Beka Gochiashvili, Mike Mitchel and Cameron Graves, the album swells with an abundance of strength, soul and astounding musicianship.\n\nAn accomplished film and TV composer of well over 70 projects, his credits include Boyz N The Hood, the Tina Turner biopic What’s Love Got To Do With It, Romeo Must Die, The Transporter, Best Man Holiday and most recently the 2019 documentary film score Halston. In 2020 he scores the music for the Hulu show Woke. He has garnered three Emmy nominations and a BMI Award for his scoring. In 2014 Clarke was invited to become a member of the exclusive Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.\n\nBorn in Philadelphia, Clarke has been a constant force of nature in American music since the early 1970s with the success of the jazz-fusion group Return To Forever. That accomplishment gave way to a number of extremely successful solo albums for Clarke. Along the way, he has collaborated with Quincy Jones, Stan Getz, Art Blakey, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Keith Richards, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Chaka Khan, The Police, Herbie Hancock and many more, and has shared the stage with Bob Marley and Miles Davis.\n\nClarke believes in giving back to help young musicians hone their skills. He and his wife Sofia established The Stanley Clarke Foundation seventeen years ago as a charitable organization, which offers scholarships to talented young musicians.\n\nAnyone who’s followed Judith Hill’s story will recognize Letters from a Black Widow as one jaw-dropper of an album title. The tabloid-coined phrase “Black Widow” arose after the overdose deaths of her two star-making collaborators, Michael Jackson and Prince. It became a term of abuse that internet trolls hurled at the celebrated artist, driving conspiracy theories and shame campaigns – trauma that nearly ended a career that includes a Grammy for her role in the Oscar-winning documentary film “20 Feet from Stardom.”\n\n“For years the Black Widow was such a dark presence in my life that was too looming and intimidating to even talk about,” Hill says. But a year into the pandemic, she had time and space for a momentous reckoning. “Being forced to stop allowed me to reach a deeper place, to really marinate and figure out what’s at my core, what I really needed to talk about. I found I had the courage and strength to face all this – to be authentic to my core, to dive into the whole experience, and turn an ocean of darkness into expressive fire.”\n\nIf Hill’s previous album, Baby, I’m Hollywood, was the rowdy coming-of-age tale of a mixed-race child of bohemian California, Letters from a Black Widow is a formidable battle cry – an album-length soul/funk/gospel passion play that’s spectacularly written, arranged, and performed.\n\nOne signal moment in Hill’s writing process came during a visit with friends to a hot spring outside of Los Angeles, where a communal psychedelic experience wound up shunting her off into a more private and terrifying realm. “An entire mountain appeared before my eyes,” she recalls. “And I knew it represented all the trauma in my life that I hadn’t realized was still there.”\n\nI could feel the mountain/I close my eyes and it appears… Hill chose that vision as the album opener in “One of the Bad Ones” because she wanted the first chapter of Letters from a Black Widow to acknowledge that which she is most afraid of – her own maleficence. “We’re in a culture where we judge words and people on this binary of whether they’re good or bad, when everyone is more complicated than that. I wanted to explore that question, and communicate it with music that was orchestral and expansive, yet filled with pain and yearning.” In a sense, “One of the Bad Ones” plays like a précis for the entire album. Letters from a Black Widow is a theatrical, soul-funk song-cycle a la Inner Visions or What’s Goin’ On, which takes listeners on a journey from private pain to communal transcendence.\n\nHer antihero energy truly ignites on “Flame,” a song that evokes the raw vocal power of a young Aretha Franklin, stabbing every syllable of the declaration, Give me chaos and give me pain/but you can never kill my flame. Hill says this is the kind of power she could only access by moving through that mountain.\n\n“All the guilt, shame, and paranoia can get to be like a cancer growing in you,” she shares. “You feel like nobody will understand, nobody will really care, and this becomes your whole reality. Making songs about it means giving yourself permission to even speak. It’s a kindness to yourself to even pick up the paintbrush and draw it, and it can take on a momentum of its own.”\n\nHill drew on conversations with her opera/theater director and friend Alexander Gedeon, which inspired the theatrical experimentation that runs throughout Letters from a Black Widow. Emotions reach their fullest expression in the titular song “Black Widow,” where Hill confronts the malign figure that haunted her for years.\n\nThis album’s new stories of discovery, resistance, and redemption all share the same unshakable soul and funk foundation Hill has enjoyed for most of her life. Searing guitar solos are evermore impressive by the fact that the guitar is one more instrument the confoundingly talented musician recently “just sort of picked up,” during the songwriting process. “To me, the guitar is like a new character, the wailing, screeching core of me, a voice that just wants to be heard,” Hill explains.\n\nWhile creating Letters from a Black Widow, Hill said she often changed up her writing style. “Some songs are about getting the story right, the tone, and the voice, almost like I’m writing a scene in a movie. Others begin with music… I’m with my guitar or bass just finding a groove, looking for what I need to drive the song,” she says. All live in the imaginative, often surprising spaces Hill renders with prodigious composing and arranging skills. “I trained in composition and always strive to figure out how to bring that exploration into my world as a blues-soul person.”\n\nFunk-riddled songs like “My Whole Life Is in the Wrong Key” and “Downtown Boogie” marry playful metaphor to sonic complexity and an unstoppable low-end groove. “Funk music is associated with sexy party vibes but it can also be ironic,” Hill says. “Sometimes what makes it funky is the irony of it.” Irony shades into righteousness with “We Are the Power,” which recalls the neo-soul erudition of Meshell Ndegeocello – I see a river full of little green money flowing/It’s running, running out of all the penitentiaries. “It’s saying that, even if they cut the microphone cord, we still have power sources within us. I wanted the same sense of defiance and empowerment you hear in “Flame” to run through the album, because we’re much stronger than we actually realize we are.”\n\nWhile the album often takes buoyant and playful turns, all the songs are deeply anchored in Hill’s current reality, as a 39-year-old career artist grateful for the people who made her, and deftly aware of the bumpy path she’s chosen, and the force she’s becoming.\n\nGretchen Parlato\n\n2024 GRAMMY NOMINEE FOR BEST JAZZ VOCAL ALBUM FOR LEAN IN WITH LIONEL LOUEKEPROJECTS:\n\nSince the early 2000’s award winning vocalist and songwriter Gretchen Parlato has justly earned a reputation as one of the most inventing and mesmerizing vocalists of her generation. In 2021 she released FLOR, a project honoring her love and admiration of Brazilian music and her first studio recording in nearly a decade. “This project is a reflection of a time of putting myself aside and being completely present as a mom,” says Gretchen. “I’m finally able to find the balance between artistic creativity and nurturing motherhood. My purpose has both a higher and deeper meaning. There is a story to tell, now…of who I am in this role, and how that is reflected in the music.” The album has earned Gretchen her second Grammy Award nomination for Best Jazz Vocal Album.\n\nFeatured on over 85 albums, and four as a leader, Gretchen received her first Grammy Award nomination for Live in NYC (2013) and a coveted 4.5 star review from DownBeat Magazine with the DVD hitting No. 1 on the iTunes best music video list. The Lost and Found (2011) received more than 30 national and international awards, including the DownBeat Jazz Critics Poll No.1 Vocal Album of 2011 and iTunes Vocal Jazz Album of the Year. Her 2009 sophomore release, In a Dream, was JazzTimes Critics Poll Vocal Album of 2009 and hailed by Billboard as “the most alluring jazz vocal album of 2009.”\n\nGerald Clayton\n\nGerald Clayton searches for honest expression in every note he plays. With harmonic curiosity and critical awareness, he develops musical narratives that unfold as a result of both deliberate searching and chance uncovering. The four-time GRAMMY-nominated pianist/composer formally began his musical journey at the prestigious Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, where he received the 2002 Presidential Scholar of the Arts Award. Continuing his scholarly pursuits, he earned a Bachelor of Arts in Piano Performance at USC’s Thornton School of Music under the instruction of piano icon Billy Childs, after a year of intensive study with NEA Jazz Master Kenny Barron at The Manhattan School of Music. Clayton won second place in the 2006 Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz Piano Competition.\n\nExpansion has become part of Clayton’s artistic identity. His music is a celebration of the inherent differences in musical perspectives that promote true artistic synergy. Inclusive sensibilities have allowed him to perform and record with such distinctive artists as Diana Krall, Roy Hargrove, Dianne Reeves, Ambrose Akinmusire, Dayna Stephens, Kendrick Scott, John Scofield Ben Williams, Terell Stafford & Dick Oatts, Michael Rodriguez, Terri Lyne Carrington, Avishai Cohen, Peter Bernstein and the Clayton Brothers Quintet. Clayton also has enjoyed an extended association since early 2013, touring and recording with saxophone legend Charles Lloyd.\n\n2016 marks his second year as Musical Director of the Monterey Jazz Festival On Tour, a project that has featured his trio along with Ravi Coltrane, Nicholas Payton, Terence Blanchard and Raul Midón on guitar and vocals.Clayton’s discography as a leader reflects his evolution as an artist. His debut recording, Two Shade (ArtistShare), earned a 2010 GRAMMY nomination for Best Improvised Jazz Solo for his arrangement of Cole Porter’s “All of You.” “Battle Circle,” his composition featured on The Clayton Brothers’ recording The New Song and Dance (ArtistShare), received a GRAMMY nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Composition in 2011. He received 2012 and 2013 GRAMMY nominations for Best Jazz Instrumental Album for Bond: The Paris Sessions (Concord) and Life Forum (Concord), his second and third album releases.\n\nCapturing the truth in each moment’s conception of sound comes naturally to Clayton. The son of beloved bass player and composer John Clayton, he enjoyed a familial apprenticeship from an early age. Clayton honors the legacy of his father and all his musical ancestors through a commitment to artistic exploration, innovation, and reinvention.\n\nIn the 2016-17 year, Clayton turns his imaginative curiosity toward uncovering the essence of the Piedmont Blues experience and expression in early twentieth century Durham. A Duke University commission, Clayton’s evening-length composition will explore a mixed media performance that features some of the most resonating voices in contemporary music.\n\nAlan Hampton\n\nAlan Hampton is a bassist/composer/singer who’s toured, written, and recorded with several leading artists in a variety of genres. In 2023 he worked as Musical Director for Rufus Wainwright’s Folkocracy Tour which included a star studded performance at Los Angeles’s Disney Hall, featuring Chaka Khan, Van Dyke Parks, Susanna Hoffs, among others. He was recruited by Andrew Bird in 2011 and has since played on 7 of his albums, including Grammy Nominated “My Finest Work Yet” and “Hark,” featuring Hampton original “Glad.” Recently Hampton and Bird scored Chris Pine’s highly anticipated directorial debut Poolman, staring Danny DeVito, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Annette Bening.

The title track from ERIMAJ’s “Conflict of a Man,” was featured on HBO’s new series Insecure. “Still,” one of many collaborations between Hampton and Grammy nominated vocalist Gretchen Parlato, was performed on French television in Manu Katche’s One Shot Not.

In addition to writing and contributing dozens of songs for other artists, including “Places That the Mind Goes” recorded by 311 and “If It Was,” recorded by Iceland’s Silva & Steini, he has also released two albums under his own name: The Moving Sidewalk, and Origami For the Fire, which received critical acclaim from Ben Ratliff of the New York Times:\n\n“Alan Hampton is a songwriter who makes you reach for platitudes about ‘good music’ — how people don’t write adventurous or honest pop songs anymore, how it’s all archness and monotony now, how our harmony-starved ears have shrunk….He does that because he’s got loads of talent.”\n\nClarence Penn\n\n“Clarence is the kind of musician who leaves his judgments of music and musicians aside to provide the best support and complement. He really cares that everyone on stage sound as good as they can. That explains why the results are so great with the extraordinary musicians he brings into his projects. Fireworks!”—Dave Douglas\n\n“Clarence is a charismatic player, with great dynamic range and drama and musicality. He’s an intricate and heady drummer who thinks compositionally, but uses his gut and instincts towards the end result of making something exciting, that feels alive, and is full of energy and passion. He doesn’t have a limited conception of what the drummer is. Of course, he drives the band and pushes the time, but he also knows how to stop and allow things to happen—to be a colorist.”—Maria Schneider\n\n“I think Clarence is a natural leader. He listens like a producer. He has clarity and vision. He hears everything—the bass, the high voices, the middle. He understands harmony. He understands lyrics. He has the will to solve problems and figure them out. He doesn’t stay traditional, but makes the music free and colorful. He understands that music is play. I’d play with him every day if I could.”—Luciana Souza\n\nClarence Penn is one of the busiest jazz drummers in the world, a leader of multiple bands, a composer, a prolific producer, and an educator.\n\nSince 1991, when he arrived in New York City, Penn has placed his unique blend of mega-chops, keen intellect, and heady musicianship at the service of a staggering array of A-list artists—a chronological short-list includes Ellis and Wynton Marsalis, Betty Carter, Stanley Clarke, Steps Ahead, Makoto Ozone, Michael Brecker, Dave Douglas, Maria Schneider, Luciana Souza, Richard Galliano, and Fourplay. Penn’s impressive discography includes several hundred studio albums (including the Grammy-winning recordings 34th and Lex by Randy Brecker and Concert in the Garden and Sky Blue by Maria Schneider) representing a 360-spectrum of jazz expression, and he’s toured extensively throughout the United States, the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia. He’s composed music for films and commercials, and produced tracks for numerous singers in the pop and alternative arenas. He earned a “Ten Best of 1997” accolade from the New York Times for his first leader recording, Penn’s Landing.\n\nA graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University, where he was a protégé of Ellis Marsalis, Penn is active as an educator and drum clinician. From 2004 to 2012, he taught on the faculty of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music. He’s also served on faculty at the Stanford Jazz Workshop, the Saint Louis College of Music in Rome, Italy, and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Intensive Jazz Institute.\n\nPenn currently leads several ensembles. His most recent “rhythmically intoxicating” recording is 2014’s “Monk The Lost Files”arrangements of the music of Thelonious Monk. Released on the Origin record lable, an amazing quartet comprising saxophonist Chad Leftkowitz-Brown, Pianist Gerald Clayton/Donald Vega, and bassist Yasushi Nakamura performing the music of Thelonius Monk with today’s modern jazz sensibility. Near completion is a “world music” studio project of songs and instrumentals that melds background voices—including his own—with a world class band.\n\nWhether Penn is leading his own band or performing as a sideman, he brings to the table unfailing versatility and professionalism, an ability to find creative ways to interpret a global array of styles and idioms, and a stated intention “to play music that’s warm and organic for the people and for myself.”\n\nHis motto: “When people hear my name, I want them to think, ‘I don’t know what band he’s playing with tonight or what he’ll be doing, but it’s going to be good, it’s going to be musical.’”\n\nCameron Graves\n\nA member of the game-changing, genre-blurring Los Angeles collective, the West Coast Get Down, pianist CAMERON GRAVES is taking the modern jazz scene by storm. Graves’ style was described by his fellow West Coast Get Down member, Kamasi Washington, as an “almost unbelievable combination of modal jazz, romantic era European classical music, and mathematical death metal.” Graves’ debut record on Mack Avenue Records, Planetary Prince, which also serves as Graves’ pseudonym, comes from The Urantia Book,a spiritual tome that emerged from Chicago in the first half of the 20th century and that purports to reveal the truth of humanity through a combination of spiritual and cosmological ideas, including radical retellings of familiar stories from the Bible. This release marked a seismic shift in the jazz landscape and the game-changing arrival of the genre-blurring Los Angeles collective West Coast Get Down blending elements of Jazz, Classical, Rock and Hip-Hop. The core of the band on Planetary Prince is made up of fellow West Coast Get Down members, whose musical and personal relationships with Graves stretch back to their high school days: tenor saxophonist Kamasi Washington, trombonist Ryan Porter, bassist Stephen “Thundercat” Bruner, and drummer Ronald Bruner Jr. To their ranks are added trumpeter Philip Dizack and bassist Hadrien Feraud, both key members of the groundbreaking modern L.A. Jazz scene.\n\nConnie Han\n\nHailed by Downbeat Magazine \"The Jazz Warrior-Goddess\" with \"a skill and ferocity unmatched by all but the most accomplished of pianists,\" 27-year-old piano wizard and composer Connie Han interprets the jazz piano pantheon with her own fiery, contemporary style.\n\nNamed a Steinway Artist in 2019, the pianist exhibits her charismatic playing style in its full emotional range on Secrets of Inanna, Han’s third release on Mack Avenue Records — a dynamic musical portrait of the beguiling and mysterious Inanna, ancient Sumerian proto-goddess of Love, Beauty, and War.\n\nWith an interpretation that belies her age, Han’s expertise shines in the piano trio idiom. Paved by Chick Corea/Roy Haynes and McCoy Tyner/Elvin Jones, the timeless drum-piano tradition is explored in Han’s interplay with longtime collaborator/drummer Bill Wysaske. The two like minds and their combined chemistry has proven exceptionally fruitful in Han’s career, as Wysaske’s myriad contributions include concept development, production, composition, and arrangement on all three albums released by Mack Avenue Records.\n\nHan’s latest release Secrets of Inanna portrays the Sumerian mythos of the goddess’s solitary descent into the abyss of her soul: the underworld. As told in the Sumerian legend The Descent of Inanna, the heroine’s quest and prophetic evolution can only be completed with Inanna’s commitment to endure immeasurable suffering — a metamorphosis in which she kills her prior self and is ultimately reborn as the Queen of Heaven and Earth.\n\nHan believes in the power of myth to lead a grounded existence as an artist and human being. The wisdom imparted by epics such as The Descent of Inanna is as meaningful to Han’s work as her influences. Throughout Connie’s own journey, music continues to prove itself as meditative sanctuary and a constant truth of life. It is part of her vision to embolden and inspire audiences of all ages with storytelling through the jazz piano idiom.\n\nGustav Mahler once said, “Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the preservation of fire.” With each upcoming performance and recording date, Connie Han continues to fulfill this axiom with tenacity and identity — standing on the shoulders of giants who have so deeply impacted her artistry.\n\nJahari Stampley\n\nJahari Stampley is a Chicago-born pianist who began playing the piano at the age of 14.
