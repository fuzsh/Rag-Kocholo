        "text": "On this beautiful morning I woke up with a song in my head. One of the few times I seem to both listen and memorize the lyrics is when it comes old American classics. The songbooks from the early 30‚Äôs and 40‚Äôs. Cole Porter was such a talent. In 1956 Ella Fitzgerald releases the album ‚ÄúElla F. sings the Cole Porter songbook‚Äù, an album of who‚Äôs owners ought to be very proud! I was first unsure of if this marvellous guy was the composer behind both the music and lyrics to the song but recently found out he was, which is not that common.\n\nCole Porter (1891-1964):\n\nBorn in Peru, Indiana USA. By the 1930s he was one of the major songwriters for the Broadway musical stage. In 1937 Porter was serously injured in a horseback accident and was for the rest of his life in constant pain. Except from Everytime we say goodbye, he is the composer of the well-known little tunes ‚ÄúI get a kick out of you‚Äù, Night and Day and ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got you under my skin‚Äù and many,many more. After some years at Yale University and Harvard‚Äôs Scool of Law, he understood he was devoted to music and changes after some reconsidering to Harvard‚Äôs faculty of Music, something that was kept secret from his grandfather, James Omar Cole, ‚Äúthe richest man in Indiana‚Äù. During World War one Porter settles in Paris but his involvement within French war force is still unclear. Some have said that he, while in the Legion, had a specially constructed portable piano with him so that he could carry it on his back and entertain the troops in their bivouacs.\n\nPorter maintained a luxury apartment at Rue Monsieur close to Les Invalides in Paris and his parties were extravagant and scandalous with ‚Äúmuch gay and bisexual activity, Italian nobility, cross-dressing, international musicians, and a large surplus of recreational drugs.‚Äù[3] In 1918, he met Linda Lee Thomas, a rich girl whom he married the following year. Apparently, Linda was in no doubt about Porter‚Äôs homosexuality, but since it was mutually advantageous for them to marry it didn‚Äôt seem to matter. For Linda it offered continued social status and a partner who was the antithesis of her abusive first husband and for Porter it brought a respectable heterosexual front in an era when homosexuality was not publicly acknowledged. They were genuinely devoted and remained married from 1919 until Linda‚Äôs death in 1954. (Cute.)\n\nIn the 1940‚Äôs he made films with Fred Astaire, Rita Hayworth and Cary Grant starring and after some years of diminishing attention he had his greatest event of comeback in 1948 with the Broadway show ‚ÄúKiss me Kate‚Äú. The show was to be runned for 1,077 performances in New York and 400 in London. Porter got the Tony Award for this work, (the first Tony awarded in that category), and he won the price for best composer and lyricist. No wonder his phrases get stuck in your head like ticks on a dog..\n\nCole Porter dies of a kidney failure October 15, 1964 at the age of 73 in Santa Monica, California. He had by then gone through 34 operations and one leg amputation caused by his earlier injuries. Porter was never to write another song after the amputation and seem to have spent the remaining six years of his life in relative seclusion.\n\nEverytime we say goodbye\n\nI die a little\n\nEverytime we say goodbye\n\nI wonder why a little\n\nWhy the Gods above me Who must be in the know\n\nThink so little of me,\n\nThey allow you to go?\n\nVerse 2:\n\nWhen You‚Äôre near There‚Äôs such an air of Spring about it\n\nI can hear a lark somewhere, Begin to sing about it\n\nThere‚Äôs no lovesong finer\n\nBut how strange the change from major to minor\n\nEverytime we say goodbye\n\nAnother supersong from the 30‚Äôs ‚Äúhit-list‚Äù. Relax and listen lyrics lovers..\n\nThanks Mum and Dad for printing these tracks into memory at almost every family occasion.. üòâ"
