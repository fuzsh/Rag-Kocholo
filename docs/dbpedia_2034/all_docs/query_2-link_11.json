        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl heavily criticized his team's performance in Saturday's 1-1 Bundesliga draw at Wolfsburg.\n\nThe Black and Yellows are clinging onto a top four spot after a series of dropped points this term, having just missed out on last season's title with virtually the last kick.\n\n\"We played arrogantly and weren't consistent enough at times. We let things drift a bit,\" the former Dortmund captain told reporters.\n\n\"We didn't play a good game today. We didn't play well enough to deserve to win.\"\n\nThe game was held up several times due to fans throwing tennis balls onto the pitch in protest at plans for the league to have an external investor. Dortmund captain Emre Can admitted it had affected their concentration, but Kehl believes it was no excuse.\n\nIn contrast to the Bundesliga, Dortmund have been flying in the Champions League this season and travel to PSV Eindhoven for their last 16 first leg on Tuesday.\n\n\"Of course, the aim is to qualify directly for the Champions League again this year. And I believe we will achieve that in the end,\" Kehl said."
