        "text": "GERMANY ground out a 1-0 home win over Serbia & Montenegro on Wednesday evening.\n\nRudi Voller was without a number of his major stars due to injury, but he was still able to field a team capable of beating a side which contained the likes of Savo Milosevic and Predrag Mijatovic.\n\nSebastian Kehl grabbed the only goal of the game shortly after the hour mark.\n\nThe Borussia Dortmund man beat keeper Dragoslav Jevric with a long range effort.\n\nThe Germans had to work hard for the win, as the Serbo Montenegrins posed a number of questions, but Voller`s men have a resilient streak and stood firm."
