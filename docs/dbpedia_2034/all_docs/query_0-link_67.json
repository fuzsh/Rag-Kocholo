        "text": "Goalkeepers\n\nRoman Weidenfeller - Germany - Age 30 *\n\nMitchell Langerak - Australia - Age 22\n\nJohannes Focher - Germany - Age 21\n\nDefenders\n\nLukasz Piszczek - Poland - Age 26\n\nNevan Subotic - Serbia - Age 22 *\n\nMats Hummels - Germany - Age 22 *\n\nMarcel Schmelzer - Germany - Age 23\n\nMarc Hornschuh - Germany - Age 20\n\nFelipe Santana - Brazil - Age 25\n\nPatrick Owomoyela - Germany - Age 31\n\nChris Lowe - Germany - Age 22\n\nMidfielders\n\nSebastian Kehl - Germany - Age 31\n\nSven Bender - Germany - Age 22\n\nMario Gotze - Germany - Age 19 *\n\nShinji Kagawa - Japan - Age 22\n\nKevin Großkreutz - Germany - Age 22\n\nAntonio Da Silva - Brazil - Age 33\n\nFlorian Kringe - Germany - Age 28\n\nJakub Blaszczyhowski - Poland - Age 25\n\nMoritz Leitner - Germany - Age 18\n\nIvan Perisic - Croatia - Age 22\n\nIlkay Gundogan - Germany - Age 20\n\nDamian Le Tallec - France - Age 21\n\nForwards\n\nLucas Barrios - Paraguay - Age 26 *\n\nMohamed Zidan - Egypt - Age 29\n\nRobert Lewandowski - Poland - Age 22\n\n* - Players with an aster-ix beside them show that they are a key player to the club.\n\nGoalkeepers\n\n1 - Roman Weidenfeller - Without a doubt your number one keeper for the next few years to say the least, great shot stopper and also good in one on one situations. It seems like he has been at the club for years, which is correct, he arrived from Kaiserslautern in 2002, and since then he has been a key figure in the recent success of Borussia Dortmund. He also has good communication and Command of Area, which shows that he is domminant when coming out for crosses into the box. And with Roman in nets you can be reassured that he will do well and shouldn't make too many mistakes.\n\n20 - Mitchell Langerak - Good back-up keeper to Roman in goal, however when Roman retires you should look to bring through a new keeper, as none of your other keepers are good enough for first choice in my opinion. Langerak has great reflexes, however doesn't have the best concentration, so may make some mistakes from time to time. Also his Command of Area and Communication are below average for what I look for in a keeper.\n\n41 - Johannes Focher - Again another keeper that shouldn't become your first choice, although only 21 years old I would look to sell him on, Langerak is a good enough back up, and if you bring through a youth goalkeeper you can use him for your cup games if you wish, and hopefully develop him so that in the long run he can become no.1.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nFullbacks\n\n25 - Patrick Owomoyela - Injured at the start of the season for around 2 months, and at the age of 31 he is at the wrong end of the career. However he has been a Dortmund great over the years, and he adds vital experience to what is a young squad. With only 12 tackling, he isn't the best, and he has also lost pace over the years, and with recent injuries that he hasn't fully recovered from. He is a good crosser of the ball, but because he lacks pace if he pushes to far ahead then opposing wingers may exploit him, so it is probably best that you play him defensively.\n\n26 - Lukasz Piszczek - Great Right Back going forward, however again not the best defensively. He lacks key attributes at defending (Concentration, Tackling) however he has great stamina, so expect to see him runnin gup and down your flank overlapping your winger, and putting in a good cross in the end. In the 2010 season Dortmund fans were frustrated with him at times, but now that he is a regular, and not making as many mistakes to when he first joined the club, he is starting to get the backing of the fans.\n\n29 - Marcel Schmelzer - Your first choice Left Back, however he is injured for the start of the season. At the age of 23 he already has 4 caps for Germany, and with Phillip Lahm playing Left Back for Germany in recent years, it just shows what a pospect Marcel Schmelzer is. He has good defensive stats for his age, but also isn't afraid of pushing forward. Again another Full Back that has 19 stamina which is a great plus.\n\nChris Lowe - Understudy to Marcel Schmelzer and should remain that way unless you can really develop him. He was touted to be one of the next biggest talents, however he is now 22, which is still young, but with Marcel Schmelzer only a year older than him and also a lot better than him, he shouldn't be starting Left Back against any of the big teams, and with only 10 stamina, 9 tackling, you should probably look to bring in someone else at Left Back.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCentre Backs\n\n4 - Nevan Subotic - Signed from Mainz in 2007, Nevan has been a ever present Centre Back at the club since joining Dortmund, the amount of games he has played for the club you would have thought he was a veteran by now. Good at heading the ball (17) and also Marking and Tackling (16) however his Concentration isn't the best, which is the major downfall he has, and one of the few things you can fault him on. He should be your starting Centre Back with Hummels, and if you can get the Concentration up then that is a major bonus.\n\n15 - Mats Hummels - Bought in the same transfer window as Nevan, however didn't make as big of an impact when he came to the club. Hummels was a product of the Bayern Munich youth academy, and also has 7 caps for Germany. Nevan Subotic is the better header of the ball but Hummels is better mentally gifted. His decision making, concentration and also composure are all top notch, along with his tackling and marking. Dortmund is also his favoured club, and you should keep hold of him for as long as you can, future German and Dortmund captain.\n\n28 - Marc Hornschuh - A product of Dormund's own youth academy, and he doesn't look to be too much of a bad one. He is already starting to show signs of maturity, with good teamwork and concentration for his age. You should look to give him about 15 games in the first season, whether or not you play him in the cup games that is up to you.\n\n27 - Felipe Santana - Provides good back up to the team should Subotic or Hummels get injured, however in the long run I think that you should bring someone else in, but that is just my opinion as for some reason I am not the biggest fan of Santana. He is on relatively low wages of £20k a week though, so you should look to keep him in the first season, due to the strengthening of other areas where needed first.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nDefensive Midfielders\n\n5 - Sebastian Kehl - Club Captain, and a great leader for the club. Joined Dortmund in 2001 and has had a great 10 years at the club, and one of the all time greats, and still good even though he has just turned 31. Great Team Player, doesn't lack in any of the mental stats for a defensive midfielder. Also a tough tackler of the ball. His Natural Fitness is on the low side (8) so don't expect him to play week in week out, and also it may take him longer to recover from his injuries, but none the less, a great player.\n\n22 - Sven Bender - In the future this player is going to be even better than Kehl. Brought in from 1860 Munchen, his twin brother moved to Leverkusen. Very brave player and again another good tackler, doesn't like to do anything too adventurous, just likes to sit infront of the defence and break up opposing attacks. Has great stamina so yet again, works hard for the team. He is injured for the first six weeks, but if you can keep him fit after that, he will be vital to a good season ahead.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nCentre Midfielders\n\n21 - Ilkay Gundogan - £3.4million summer signing from Nurnberg, brought in to fill the gap left by Nuri Sahin. Opted to play for Germany rather than Turkey. Good passer of the ball and also has a great first touch. Could certainly do well for the club if you use him correctly.\n\n6 - Florian Kringe - Doesn't stand out in any way, shape or form, you should look to sell him at the first given opportunity, and also you can free up some wages as he is on £33k a week, which is far too much for the player that he is.\n\n8 - Antonio Da Silva - Again nothing more than a back up player, 33 years old, but he is on relatively low wages. Again I would look to sell him, he has made limited appearances for the club, and with the youth coming through the ranks, it is better off getting rid of him.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAttacking Midfields/Wingers\n\n14 - Ivan Perisic - Summer signing from Club Brugge, and also their top scorer, good addition to the squad. Can play AML/AMC and also upfront. He has good teqnique but also has good finishing and heading of the ball. Good off the ball movement, he makes himself space which opens up other areas of the pitch, and also makes it difficult for defenders to track him.\n\n19 - Kevin Großkreutz - One of the fans favourites, he never stops running and works hard for the team, might not be the best player or the fastest of players, but when he has possession of the ball expect something good to happen. He will often cut inside and either launch a cross field ball, or a through ball for the striker to latch on to. And when the team doesn't have possession then he will work hard as a team to get the ball back.\n\n16 - Jakub Blaszczyhowski - A series of injuries has seen him decline over the years, although he is still only 25. Doesn't possess the greatest of stats technically but he is a fast player, he can knock the ball past the opponent and whip in a cross, but other than that don't really expect much more from him. Although a lot of people will choose not to I would probably look to sell him on.\n\n23 - Shinji Kagawa - Possesses great agility and pace, can take a man on, but he is probably better known for the amount of assists that he can possibly get. A signing from Sakai FC in Japan for a nominal fee in today's economy of £300k, and could be one of the best buys ever. Since joining Dortmund he has been linked to clubs like Manchester United and Barcelona, however he came out stating that he would like to stay at Dortmund for the foreseeable future.\n\n11 - Mario Gotze - At the young age of 19 he has already been capped at International Level. He has been at Dortmund since 2006 and has developed through the ranks of the youth academy, and now he is playing in the First Team of his boyhood club, think Wilshere and Arsenal. Give the ball to Mario and he can pick a pass, or he can dribble past a player and finish. He also has that added bonus of playing on the left, right or centre. Give him the free roam ability and he will cause a lot of damage.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nStrikers\n\n18 - Lucas Barrios - A signing from Colo Colo in 2009, and Lucas has been the main striker since joining Dortmund, after getting 19 goals in his first season. He is out for 2-3 months to begin with at the start of the season. But if the defenders make a mistake then expect Lucas Barrios to bury any chances that he gets. A real goal poacher, and could easily get 30 goals in a season.\n\n9 - Robert Lewandowski - The great Pole that Dortmund signed from Lech Poznan, in recent FM games this player has been lethal, and is still a threat now. He may not have the finishing of Lucas Barrios but you can't deny his commitment to getting in the right places, and also chasing down lost causes. Also 10 goals at International level does say a lot.\n\n13 - Damien Le Tallec - Younger brother to ex-Liverpool player Anthony Le Tallec. Damien can play either on the right, or up front. He is a pretty average player, but is good back-up, and the fact that he can play on the right or up front is also an added bonus."
