        "text": "It has been a busy six weeks at Dortmund’s headquarters, located 500 meters from the Westfalenstadion. The club ended the Bundesliga season outside the top four for the first time in a decade and ended their best Champions League run in over a decade just two goals shy of silverware. Club legends Marco Reus and Mats Hummels left the club, the former to much more fanfare than the latter, and Edin Terzic resigned from his position as head coach in a surprising twist following Dortmund’s end-of-season meeting. Behind the scenes, however, remains the most important change Dortmund has witnessed in a decade—Hans-Joachim Watzke has been replaced as the club’s executive of sporting decisions.\n\nWatzke and the rest of the Dortmund board have handpicked not just one individual but a trio of leaders who will take over from Watzke when he steps away, after two decades in charge. Lars Ricken, Sebastian Kehl, and Sven Mislintat have been chosen to lead the club’s sporting decisions as Sporting CEO, Sporting Director, and Technical Director, respectively. These three men are less than two months into their new positions and have already overseen dramatic changes as they usher Borussia Dortmund into a new era. But the question is, who are the three men making up Dortmund’s new triumvirate?\n\nLars Ricken: The Unexpected Choice\n\nTo many, the appointment of Lars Ricken to the newly created role as Borussia Dortmund’s Sporting CEO was a surprise. The 47-year-old’s name rarely appeared in rumors alongside the likes of Sebastian Kehl, Sven Mislintat, Mathias Sammer, and Markus Krösche. To the decision-makers, however, the appointment of Ricken had been 33 years in the making.\n\nRicken began his time at Borussia Dortmund as a 14-year-old, joining BVB’s youth setup way back in 1990. Ricken hung up his boots professionally in 2007, having won three Bundesliga titles and one Champions League in his 13-year playing career, playing exclusively for Die Schwarzgelben. It was Dortmund Legend Michael Zorc who first elevated Ricken to a position of leadership. On the field, Zorc and Ricken played alongside one another in midfield, sharing similar stories despite being a generation apart. Both men were from Dortmund, spent their entire careers with their hometown club, and experienced significant success at Dortmund while receiving little international recognition. In 2008, Zorc, then just three years into his revolution at the club, entrusted Ricken with the club’s future generations and installed him as BVB’s Youth Coordinator.\n\nIt wasn’t a glamorous role, and Dortmund’s youth teams struggled to produce Bundesliga-quality players consistently. There were anomalies, including a brief stint in the 1990s that saw Dortmund’s youth teams dominate German football despite failing to produce meaningful Bundesliga players, but Dortmund’s youth setup was nowhere near the standard set by the likes of Barcelona’s La Masia or Manchester United’s academy. Ricken’s task was to change that. He was in charge of youth scouting, negotiating with parents and agents, recruiting the side’s many youth coaches, and overseeing the academy facilities. For many former players, oversight over youth academies is often a title handed out following loyal careers and rarely opens opportunities to truly excel. For Ricken, the Dortmund academy presented a wonderful opportunity to shape his boyhood club's present and future.\n\nResults were immediate, albeit forged on the back of Ricken’s predecessors rather than his own work. In the 2008/09 season, Borussia Dortmund’s U19s, the focal point of the club’s academy, were propelled by a young Mario Götze to runners-up in the league. That same season, Götze debuted for the senior team after being called up by Jürgen Klopp. He became the standard for success that Ricken would chase for the next 15 years – a player who joined Dortmund as a 9-year-old and became a vital contributor to the first team’s hunt for silverware. Götze, in addition to new coach Nuri Sahin and club legend Marcel Schmelzer, was among a select few who came through Dortmund’s youth system. Ricken had a clear goal—replicate the success of Mario Götze and turn Borussia Dortmund into a talent factory.\n\nAt the same time Michael Zorc and Jürgen Klopp experienced success with the first team, Ricken began to revolutionize the youth system. Ricken had a clear approach: expand the club’s academy infrastructure and develop an identity. Ricken believed that “you should be able to recognize a BVB player by how he plays soccer, even when he’s not wearing the black and yellow.” In 2011, the same year Klopp won his first title, Ricken helped coordinate the creation of international youth academies that identified young talent, with several camps having permanent homes across the United States and Asia. Ricken also oversaw the expansion of Dortmund’s youth training complex in Brackel and the gradual increase in full-time coaching staff for all youth teams from the U9s to the U23s. Emphasis was placed on the coaching staff as future Bundesliga coaches Hannes Wolf, David Wagner, Daniel Farke, and even Edin Terzic had spells coaching in BVB’s youth academy system under Lars Ricken.\n\nRicken’s evolution bore fruit in the 2015/16 season. After six seasons failing to finish higher than 4th, Borussia Dortmund’s U19s were crowned Champions of the Youth Bundesliga. The side exemplified Ricken’s ambition and planning. It was led by a local core, including Felix Passlack, Amos Pieper, and Jan-Niklas Beste alongside international talents such as Christian Pulisic and Jacob Bruun Larsen. Not only would these players win the U19 title, but many of them would all go on to play significant minutes in the senior team. The U19 team has only solidified itself as the jewel in Ricken’s crown since then. The U19 team have featured in the four-team playoff tournament in six of the last seven iterations since 2016, including four playoff berths as the best team in Western Germany. They have also won the playoff title four times and were runners up twice in that past eight years, including this past season.\n\nFor his work, Watzke promoted Ricken to Director of Youth Development in 2021 and the youth teams continued to succeed. More important, however, is the pipeline of youth talent to the first team Ricken first envisioned when he took over in 2008. The likes of Youssoufa Moukoko, Ansgar Knauff, Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, and Giovanni Reyna have all played significant minutes with the first team in recent years after starring for the youth teams.\n\nLars Ricken, working under Hans-Joachim Watzke’s oversight, was at the head of it all. Over sixteen years, Watzke and Dortmund’s leadership witnessed Ricken establish and implement a vision that fostered economic viability, on-field success, and overarching club identity. Ricken, touted as an astute mediator between competing ideas and an astute decisionmaker, has spearheaded Dortmund’s academy evolution from coaching and scouting to building new facilities and negotiating with other clubs.\n\nLars Ricken’s new role gives him oversight of not just Dortmund’s youth side but the entire sporting aspect of the club. He will be forced to call upon the skills he has developed over the past sixteen years as he seeks to guide Borussia Dortmund back into the upper pantheon of German soccer. The promotion to overseeing Dortmund’s entire sporting project will undoubtedly be a step up for Lars Ricken and he will find himself opposed by an increasingly competitive landscape and internal politics. The Dortmund native’s rise from youth player to Sporting CEO, however, has shown why club’s board believes he is the man to lead Borussia Dortmund.\n\nSebastian Kehl: Zorc’s Handpicked Successor\n\nFor Sebastian Kehl, Lars Ricken’s promotion to Sporting CEO represents a peculiar situation. Kehl seemed to be the obvious choice for the position. Michael Zorc may have picked Ricken to lead youth development, but Kehl was his hand-picked successor after the latter’s return to the club in 2018. Kehl’s initial role as head of the newly created Licensed Player Division may seem like corporate jargon, but it positioned him as Zorc’s right-hand man.\n\nSebastian Kehl worked closely with Zorc on squad planning, transfer negotiations, and even aspects of youth recruitment in his new role. He acted as liaison between the club and players of all stages as Dortmund’s leadership entrusted him with greater responsibility over the years. The board elevated Kehl to the role of Sporting Director when Michael Zorc retired in 2022. Why his promotion to Sporting Director in 2022 made sense can be read about here and, at that point at least, Kehl seemed as if he would be at the forefront of Dortmund’s sporting decisions for years to come. The promotion of Lars Ricken, however, alters that narrative. Sebastian Kehl was fast-tracked on his way to overseeing the club’s sporting ambitions but his own ambitions were suddenly derailed as the club’s form began to struggle.\n\nDespite failing to achieve his aspirations, the club’s new structure represents a pyrrhic victory for Kehl. Sebastian Kehl may have missed out on the job Michael Zorc groomed him to take but reports indicate that Dortmund’s new triumvirate, including Kehl as the Sporting Director, will have total control over squad planning. Kehl’s tenure as Sporting Director has been overshadowed by lasting disputes with Dortmund’s former Head Coach, Edin Terzic, on how the first team should look. While rumors of the business relationship between Kehl and Terzic varied, it was obvious that they both had different visions of how the club should operate.\n\nKehl found immediate success bringing in Nico Schlotterbeck, assisting with Julian Ryerson’s transfer, and luring star players like Karim Adeyemi and Sébastien Haller to Dortmund. Haller’s cancer diagnosis in 2023 saw the club opt for Terzic’s desired replacement, Anthony Modeste, and 16 months of disputes behind the scenes followed as the two argued over several key transfer. Terzic and Kehl debated transfers and proposed them to Hans-Joachim Watzke who had the final say. Both parties found success; Kehl championed Marcel Sabitzer and negotiated Ian Maatsen’s loan while Terzic (supposedly) nominated Füllkrug. Both men also struggled. Kehl’s chosen successor to Raphael Guerreiro, Ramy Bensebaini, has been a bust while Terzic vetoed the purchase of Édson Alvarez in favor of Felix Nmecha and a contract extension for Emre Can.\n\nWith Dortmund’s new sporting structure and the departure of Edin Terzic, the backroom staff is expected to have complete supremacy over the coach. New coach, Nuri Sahin, will ask for players or player profiles, but the final makeup of the squad and the choice of coach will fall on Lars Ricken, Sebastian Kehl, and Sven Mislintat.\n\nA door may have slammed shut for Sebastian Kehl, but he will now be able to influence Dortmund’s transfers in a way he was never able to before. His role in the triumvirate is clear as Sporting Director - he will continue to be the voice of the club in the dressing room and will be the one engaged in any negotiations. From now on, we will undoubtedly see a Borussia Dortmund squad featuring Kehl’s influence.\n\nSven Mislintat: The Divisive ‘Diamond Eye’\n\nThe last member of Dortmund’s new triumvirate is Sven Mislintat. Much like Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl, Mislintat is a known quantity for Borussia Dortmund. Nicknamed ‘Diamantenauge,’ or Diamond Eye, Mislintat served as Borussia Dortmund’s Chief Scout from 2006 to 2017 and is credited for unearthing several key players including Pierre Emerick Aubameyang, Ousmane Dembele, Jadon Sancho, and Robert Lewandowski. He was an asset for Borussia Dortmund through their back-to-back championship campaigns and garnered a reputation as one of the best scouts in Europe when he left for Arsenal in 2017. Unlike Lars Ricken and Sebastian Kehl, however, Mislintat is regarded as a divisive character in Borussia Dortmund’s recent history.\n\nBefore joining Borussia Dortmund in an official capacity, Mislintat worked as a consultant for Dortmund’s then-coach, Matthias Sammer, in the 2002 season when the club won their fifth Bundesliga title. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, Dortmund established a new and re-imagined scouting department in 2006 with Mislintat as their first employee. Mislintat’s work initially began as match and opposition analysis but soon expanded to scouting talent. He quickly rose to Head Scout as his team expanded and worked closely alongside Michael Zorc. It was in this position where Mislintat earned his nickname.\n\nDortmund’s approach of becoming a ‘talent factory’ that bought low and sold high was not the result of any individual genius but rather the product of economic hardships during the early 2000s. Dortmund’s ability to do this better than anyone in Europe, however, was the result of Dortmund’s effective scouting department under Sven Mislintat. During his tenure as Head Scout, Mislintat established a data-driven scouting approach that focused on unestablished talent. Hans Joachim Watzke drove Dortmund’s new austere approach to put Dortmund in a position where economic hardships were a problem of the past, but it was minds like Mislintat that enabled the club to position itself as European regulars.\n\nMislintat’s final years at Dortmund were when division began to creep in. As his reputation grew, Mislintat’s belief in his ability to find talent grew. In 2016, the scout got into a dispute with Thomas Tuchel, Dortmund’s head coach at the time, over the failed transfer of Oliver Torres from Atletico Madrid. Mislintat viewed Torres as the future of Dortmund’s midfield while Tuchel vetoed the transfer and pushed for a shock return of Mario Götze and Sebastian Rode from Bayern Munich. Tuchel banned Mislintat from the club’s training ground and the two men ceased speaking to one another. Thomas Tuchel lifted the DFB Pokal the following season with a team filled with many players that Mislintat advocated for including Aubameyang, Dembele, Kagawa, and Ginter. Neither Mario Götze nor Sebastian Rode made an appearance in the final. Tuchel departed the club weeks later but the club’s relationship with Mislintat was still damaged. When Arsenal came calling during the winter, Mislintat answered the call. Within two months he had signed Dortmund’s best player, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, to the London club.\n\nMislintat’s success since leaving Dortmund is mixed. His three years at Arsenal saw him fail to live up to his reputation as his signings floundered. A three-year stint as Sporting Director at VfB Stuttgart followed and was a resounding success. Under his stewardship, Stuttgart added the likes of Wataru Endo, Gregor Kobel, Sasa Kaladjdzic, Chris Fuhrich, and Serhou Guirassy. Mislintat’s last stop before returning home was Ajax and a five-month disaster that saw Mislintat fail to replace Marc Overmars as Ajax recorded their worst start to the season in history.\n\nNow, Mislintat has returned to Dortmund as Technical Director, a position initially created to retain Edin Terzic at the club following his stint as interim coach. The consensus is that Mislintat will work alongside Sebastian Kehl and Lars Ricken in an advisory role where the final say falls on Lars Ricken. It is difficult to predict what might come from Mislintat in his new role. Will we see the same success he brought to the club in his first stint, or will we see a man who has been unable to shake his failures at Ajax and Arsenal?\n\nThe Triumvirate\n\nBorussia Dortmund have established their new think tank with Lars Ricken, Sebastian Kehl, and Sven Mislintat as the key figures. The three have inherited one of the weakest squads in recent memory and will tasked with reestablishing Borussia Dortmund amongst Europe’s elite teams. They will not only have to overcome increasingly rich teams in both Germany and across football but they will have establish how to work with one another. Despite all three men working for the club for a number of years across the past two decades, none of them have ever worked alongside one another.\n\nWe do not know how the tenure of Dortmund’s new backroom staff will progress but we can look at their pasts to create a hazy picture of how they operate. Lars Ricken’s role as Youth Director and Mislintat’s emphasis on young players with high potential signals that Dortmund’s average age of 26.3 may begin to trend younger. We could also see Dortmund return to the ‘talent factory’ ethos that the club separated themselves from in the final years of Watze’s tenure. Sebastian Kehl’s track record, including the likes of Sebastian Haller, Ramy Bensebaini, and Marcel Sabitzer indicate his ‘win now’ perspective and a push for the club to sign Bundesliga-proven players who are in the prime years of their careers. If Ricken and Mislintat see Dortmund’s future in young ‘wonderkids’, Kehl will likely be the advocate for older players.\n\nOne thing is certainty evident - Borussia Dortmund have placed great emphasis on hiring and retaining induvial who know the club. Each member of Dortmund’s new leadership have previously worked for the club and the last two coaches, Nuri Sahin and Edin Terzic, both had significant ties with the club. The team has begun to place emphasis, both through their actions and statements to the press, of a ‘BVB DNA’ that they are chasing. Dortmund has found success with this in the past as Michael Zorc was regarded as one of the best Sporting Directors during his stint in charge and remains the longest tenured Dortmund employee in the club’s history. The absence of new ideas, however, may push Dortmund further away from the clubs they are competing against.\n\nDortmund’s new triarchy has been founded. Lars Ricken, Sebastian Kehl, and Sven Mislintat now lead Borussia Dortmund into a new era both on and off the field. The club’s future rests in these three men’s ability, wit, and their relationships with one another. Only time will tell if Dortmund’s triumvirate will lead Borussia Dortmund back into the upper pantheon of European football or further into mediocrity.\n\nYour Thoughts?\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Dortmund’s new decision-makers? Who would you have picked to lead Dortmund’s hierarchy? Are you excited or concerned for the future?"
