        "text": "Sebastian Kehl believes Borussia Dortmund have already proved it was a good decision to bring Jadon Sancho back to Signal Iduna Park, but the sporting director stopped short of saying the Manchester United star would make a permanent switch this summer.\n\nSancho was frozen out by United boss Erik ten Hag for the first half of the season, and made a loan switch to Dortmund in the January transfer window. After showing some rustiness at first, having not played since August, he has played his part as Edin Terzic's team have progressed to the latter stages of the Champions League.\n\nThe England international isn't the only loanee to impress under Terzic. Ian Maatsen has thrived after a January move from Chelsea, with debate continuing on the subject of potential permanent moves for both.\n\nThere will be a gap in Dortmund's squad at the end of the season, with long-serving star Marco Reus set to move on. Still, despite the loanees showing their quality, nothing has been agreed.\n\n\"We will see,\" Kehl told TNT Sports ahead of the second leg of the European semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. \"They are on loan, both of them, and at the end we need to make any decisions.\n\n\"Of course they are under contract with their clubs, that means we will at a specific moment get in touch and then we will see if it's possible or not. I know that the players feel pretty welcome in Dortmund, they feel at home, especially Jadon.\n\n\"I think it was a quite good decision to take them,\" Kehl continued. \"But again, this is something for the future, and let's keep our focus on today.\"\n\nShould Borussia Dortmund sign Jadon Sancho permanently? Have your say in the comments section\n\nKehl's comments come after United boss Ten Hag confirmed club representatives have visited Sancho in Germany. Dortmund sit fifth with two league games remaining, but their European run - as well as those of other German teams - means that will be enough to qualify them for next season's Champions League.\n\n\"We are visiting games,\" Ten Hag said. \"We visited, I would not say all of the games, but we have seen more games from Dortmund where Jadon was performing.\n\n\"We also had a visit with him, we had a talk with him during his stay there and we will keep going with this process, we will continually be in contact and communicate. We have four important games in the league and then the FA Cup final, so we will see in the summer what's going to happen.\"\n\nWhile Dortmund will play Champions League football next season, United's European qualification is far less certain. Champions League qualification is out of the question for Ten Hag's team, and their 4-0 loss at Crystal Palace on Monday leaves them outside the Europa League and Conference League spots with three league games - and an FA Cup final - to go.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!"
