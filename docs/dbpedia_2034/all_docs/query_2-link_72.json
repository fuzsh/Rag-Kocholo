        "text": "Erling Haaland has been described by Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastien Kehl as a 'burden' during his final months at the club.\n\nHaaland completed a £52million transfer to Manchester City this summer after a two-and-a-half-year spell at the Bundesliga outfit, where he netted an incredible 86 goals in 89 games.\n\nHaaland has gone on to replicate that form for Pep Guardiola’s side, scoring 12 times in seven games in all competitions this season, including two goals in Tuesday night’s 4-0 Champions League victory at Sevilla.\n\nDespite his goalscoring exploits at Signal Iduna Park, though, Kehl was critical of the impact his superstardom and speculation around his future had on the rest of the squad as his time at the club drew to close.\n\n“As much as we have always appreciated Erling and the success he has had with our shirt, in the end the matter had definitely become a burden, both in the dressing room and for the club,” Kehl told German outlet Sport Bild.\n\n“In general, for the whole environment, it was just him. The timing of the sale was right, both for us and for City. The fact that our first ten goals this season have been scored by ten different players proves it.”\n\nBorussia Dortmund have made an encouraging start to the season with new manager Edin Terzic's side sitting second in the table on goal difference, while they enjoyed an opening day 3-0 win against FC Copenhagen in the Champions League.\n\nKehl has been impressed with Dortmund’s start under their new boss Terzic - who replaced sacked Marco Rose in May - and believes Haaland’s departure has benefited the whole squad.\n\n“I would have liked to have been certain [about the Norwegian's departure] a little earlier, because that issue limited our preparation.\n\n“Without him, we have the possibility to trust the other players. The fact that our first ten competitive goals have been scored by ten different players shows that pretty well.”\n\nThe timing of Kehl comments could well come back to bite him, though.\n\nDortmund are scheduled to face Man City in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday, with the Germans set to visit the Etihad Stadium.\n\nAnd, in his current form, Haaland doesn't need any more ammunition for his hunger to find the net and continue his red-hot scoring streak."
