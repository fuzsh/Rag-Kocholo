        "text": "Borussia Dortmund captain Sebastian Kehl scored to lead his team to a 2-1 victory over Schalke in the 140th Ruhr derby and close in on a second successive Bundesliga title Saturday.\n\nDortmund set a new Bundesliga record of 25 games unbeaten as Kehl's 63rd-minute winner moved the defending champion eight points ahead of Bayern Munich, which was held to a 0-0 draw by Mainz in the late game.\n\nJefferson Farfan had given Schalke the lead in the ninth minute, but Lukasz Piszczek equalized from a narrow angle nine minutes later and Kehl scored from a corner.\n\n\"That was a lot of work for everyone involved with a lucky winner,\" said Dortmund coach Juergen Klopp, whose side beat Bayern 1-0 on Wednesday. \"We squeezed out everything we had left. We really had to dig deep.\"\n\nDortmund only needs one win from its three remaining games to become the first team — other than Bayern — to retain the title since it last did so 16 years ago.\n\nKaiserslautern is almost certainly relegated after losing 2-0 at home to Nuremberg, Bayer Leverkusen salvaged a dramatic 3-3 draw with visiting Hertha Berlin, Augsburg won 2-1 at Wolfsburg, and Hamburger SV also claimed an important victory in the fight against relegation with a 1-0 win over Hannover.\n\nBayern needed a win from its 800th Bundesliga game at home to maintain dwindling hopes of catching Dortmund but seemed more concerned with Tuesday's visit of Real Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League semifinal.\n\nBayern coach Jupp Heynckes congratulated Dortmund on a \"deserved German title\" before kickoff and fielded an unfamiliar lineup with regular starters Franck Ribery, Philipp Lahm, Luiz Gustavo, Toni Kroos and league topscorer Mario Gomez on the bench.\n\nAnatoliy Tymoshchuk came closest to scoring when he struck the post in the 43rd, and then Mainz goalkeeper Heinz Mueller denied Ivica Olic in a one on one before the break.\n\nRibery came on for the second half, with Gomez introduced after an hour, but neither was able to inspire the side to a win.\n\n\"Now we have to concentrate ourselves fully on the game against Madrid,\" said Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.\n\nTensions were high in Gelsenkirchen after one of the Schalke bus windows was smashed and pig's blood was found daubed on the Dortmund fans' entrance to the sold-out 61,673 capacity stadium.\n\nSchalke goalkeeper Lars Unnerstall denied Sven Bender right after the kickoff, but the home side took the lead when Dortmund failed to clear a corner.\n\nFarfan tried his luck from the right and his fierce effort took a deflection off Shinji Kagawa beyond his own goalkeeper.\n\nPiszczek equalized with a fantastic strike, Unnerstall getting his hand to the ball but unable to prevent it flying inside the left post.\n\nSchalke had the better chances for the remainder of an intense first half, with 10 corners to the visitors' two.\n\nBut Dortmund's resilience eventually shone through when Kehl, on as a halftime substitute, netted the winner from close range to end Schalke's unbeaten home record going back to October, when it lost 2-1 to Kaiserslautern.\n\n\"We matched the defending and new champions,\" Schalke coach Huub Stevens said. \"It's our own fault we weren't rewarded for it.\"\n\nAndre Schuerrle and Stefan Kiessling put Leverkusen 2-0 up against Hertha, before Pierre-Michel Lasogga pulled one back in the 62nd.\n\nAny hopes of a comeback seemed gone three minutes later, when Hertha captain Levan Kobiashvili was sent off for bringing down Eren Derdiyok in the penalty area.\n\nBut Thomas Kraft pushed Simon Rolfes' penalty attempt onto the post and Derdiyok fired the rebound wide with the goal at his mercy.\n\nThen Tunay Torun equalized in the 71st and scored again six minutes later to give Hertha an improbable lead.\n\nKiessling dashed the visitors' hopes of climbing above Cologne into the relegation playoff place when he scored his second with a fine header in the 84th.\n\n\"We showed great morale. We want to take that into the next game against Kaiserslautern,\" said Hertha coach Otto Rehhagel, whose side remains second last, seven points ahead of Kaiserslautern, which will be relegated Sunday if Cologne avoids defeat in Moenchengladbach.\n\nNuremberg strikers Daniel Didavi and Tomas Pekhart scored to give Kaiserslautern its sixth defeat in a row and leave it without a win in 21 games since that 2-1 victory in Schalke.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the fans,\" said Kaiserslautern coach Krasimir Balakov, who has overseen five defeats since taking over.\n\nSouth Korea winger Son Heung-Min's 12th-minute effort was enough for Hamburg, while Sebastian Langkamp scored a dramatic 88nd-minute winner for Augsburg as both sides earned some breathing space in their fight against the drop."
