        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have reiterated their desire to keep Jude Bellingham at the club this summer and revealed they are yet to receive contact from any teams regarding a potential transfer.\n\nBellingham, 19, is widely regarded as one of the best young players in the world right now and is enjoying a stellar season with the German outfit, having scored 10 goals in all competitions.\n\nAfter breaking through at Birmingham, the midfielder joined Dortmund for Â£25m in 2020 at the age of 17.\n\nHe has since gone on to excel in Germany while he also starred for England at the World Cup, leading to speculation over his future with several of Europe's top clubs interested in making a move for him.\n\nReal Madrid and Liverpool are reportedly the front-runners, while Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea, Newcastle and PSG have also been credited with an interest in the midfielder.\n\nIt is widely expected Bellingham - who has already racked up 22 caps for the Three Lions - will depart Signal Iduna Park this summer with a price tag of around Â£132m touted.\n\nHowever, Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has re-affirmed the club's desire to keep the Englishman and poured cold water on a potential move away.\n\n'Jude feels very comfortable at Borussia Dortmund, but we havenât had conversations yet and havenât received offers for him,' Kehl told German outlet Bild this week.\n\n'He still has two more years of contract and is a very important piece of this team. Thatâs why I naturally wish that he would play for BVB longer.'\n\nDortmund remain in the Champions League and have a 1-0 lead in their last-16 tie against Chelsea ahead of the second leg at Stamford Bridge next month.\n\nThey have won eight games in a row in all competitions and are also in a title challenge in the Bundesliga, with Edin Terzic's side level on points with Bayern Munich and Union Berlin at the top of the table.\n\nBellingham has been crucial to this run of form, and has even stepped in as captain at times during this season.\n\nKehl outlined the midfielder's importance to the team and insisted he would not let the player or club be distracted by transfer speculation.\n\nHe added: 'We need Jude to achieve our goals this season and weâre glad heâs focused so much on football and has no other issues on his mind at the moment.'"
