        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has refused to rule out the possibility of Giovanni Reyna leaving the club this month.\n\nGiovanni Reyna has recently been linked with a move away from Borussia Dortmund, and his decision to sign with super agent Jorge Mendes has only fueled the speculation.\n\nThe United States international, who is under contract until 2025, has recently been touted for a loan move to Real Sociedad.\n\nAsked about the situation of the 21-year-old, who has been limited to just 320 minutes of first-team football this season, Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl admitted that his future is up in the air.\n\n\"Gio has had a difficult time and hasn't played much. He has shown time and time again that he can be a difference maker. With him playing in the middle, he has competition at his position. I understand that there is some dissatisfaction. I can't say at the moment if he will stay,\" Kehl told Sky Germany on Sunday evening.\n\nTwo other Dortmund players with uncertain futures are Marco Reus and Mats Hummels. The veteran duo are out of contract in the summer, and Kehl doesn't know if they will stay on board.\n\n\"We haven't decided yet. We are aware of the qualities of both players and their importance to the club. But of course there will come a time when we say: We're moving on. Both players have every chance,\" the BVB boss said."
