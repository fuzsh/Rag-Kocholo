        "text": "Hiring a new agent and statements by Borussia Dortmund’s sporting director Sebastian Kehl imply that Gio Reyna is set to leave the club with which he became the youngest American Bundesliga debutant at age 17 in 2020.\n\nKehl indicated empathy with Reyna’s discontent but also added, “It doesn’t help to whine.”\n\nExamples of how frustrating it must be for Reyna to spend so much time on Borussia Dortmund’s bench includes the final game of the 2022-23 Bundesliga season.\n\nWith a home win over ninth-place Mainz late May, Borussia Dortmund would have ended Bayern Munich’s 10-year reign as Bundesliga champion and brought the “Meisterschale” to Dortmund for the first time since back-to-back 2011 and 2012 triumphs under Jurgen Klopp.\n\nWith Reyna on the bench, BVB went down 2-0 by halftime to Mainz. Reyna had scored six goals, four in the second half of the season, all off the bench. The four goals included a crucial equalizer against VfB Stuttgart in stoppage time and a strike two weeks earlier.\n\nReyna finally came off the bench against Mainz in the 63rd minute and assisted on both goals to earn BVB a 2-2 tie that fell short of preventing another Bayern celebration.\n\nDuring the 2022-23 season, Reyna scored seven goals and assisted twice in only 625 minutes of action, the highest goals/assists per 90 minutes (1.30) among players with 500-plus minutes in Europe’s big 5 leagues, behind only Erling Haaland (Manchester City, 1.43) and Neymar (Paris SG, 1.40).\n\nReyna returned to BVB for the 2023-24 after starring for the USA in its Concacaf Nations League championship win last June. He suffered an ankle injury in the final against Canada. But even after his return to fitness, BVB coach Edin Terzic didn’t deem Reyna worthy of increased playing time.\n\nKehl addressed Reyna’s situation on a Sky90 interview on Sunday, a day after Reyna came on as an 88th-minute sub in a 3-0 win at Darmstadt. He has seen 230 minutes of league action, with one start, so far this season and 20 minutes in BVB’s six Champions League group games.\n\n“Gio has had a difficult time and hasn’t played much,” Kehl said. “He’s had phases of injuries, but he has shown that he can be a difference-maker.”\n\nKehl referenced Reyna’s natural position being centrally instead of playing wide, as he usually does when Terzic fields him.\n\n“He has competitors in the center, with [Marco] Reus, with [Julian] Brandt,” Kehl said. “And he also has competition for the wide spots. So I can understand he’s somewhat unhappy at this time.\n\n“But it doesn’t help to whine. You have to give gas and prove yourself … “\n\nThe 21-year-old Reyna, who is under contract through the 2024-25 season, has reportedly changed agents, leaving Wasserman for Portuguese super agent Jorge Mendes, famous for having represented Cristiano Ronaldo for nearly two decades. Reyna, his father Claudio Reyna, and Mendes reportedly met with the club to discuss his future ahead of the team’s winter-break training camp in Marbella, Spain.\n\nMendes’ agency Gestifute has linked Reyna to Real Sociedad, Sevilla, Roma and Marseille.\n\nThat the club doesn’t consider Reyna a successor to Reus, the veteran central midfielder, was hinted at by its interest in FC Nuremberg’s 18-year-old playmaker Can Uzun, who is also reportedly being courted by Bayern Munich.\n\nBVB has brought back 23-year-old winger Jadon Sancho, on loan from Manchester United. While Dortmund finished atop its Champions League group, ahead of Paris Saint-German and AC Milan, Terzic preferred 24-year-old Dutchman Donyell Malin, 21-year-old German Karim Adeyemi, and 19-year-old Englishman Jamie Bynoe-Gittens in wide positions.\n\nIn all competitions since his club debut in 2020, Reyna has made 119 appearances for BVB, scoring 17 goals and assisting on 16. Since he made 23 starts in 2020-21, his starts fell to six in 2021-22, four in 2022-23 and one in 2023-24.\n\nKehl’s interview ended with the question of whether Reyna would remain with Dortmund for the rest of the season.\n\n“I can’t at this point say whether he’ll stay,” Kehl answered."
