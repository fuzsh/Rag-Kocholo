        "text": "Frank Augstein/Associated Press\n\nBorussia Dortmund advanced to the last four of the 2014-15 DFB-Pokal on Tuesday evening with a 3-2 win over Hoffenheim, joining Wolfsburg as the two sides confirmed to progress following the first half of the quarter-finals.\n\nPlayed in front of a capacity crowd at the Signal Iduna Park, the game was a real nail-biter that remained deadlocked at 2-2 after 90 minutes before BVB pulled ahead for good in the second period of extra time. Sebastian Kehl was the hero for the hosts, as the veteran netted a golazo from distance on the half-volley that put his side through.\n\nThe defeat will be very bitter for a Hoffenheim side that played their hearts out. In fairness, neither side deserved to lose. Kevin Volland and Roberto Firmino were outstanding for the village side, the former in particular proving to be a constant live wire in attack. His pace in dribbling up the wing was unstoppable at times, and his and Firmino's quickfire goals stunned the home crowd after Neven Subotic had netted the opener for Dortmund earlier in the first half.\n\nYet just as the game appeared to be on its way to a familiar narrative for Dortmund, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang headed home the equalizer on 57 minutes. It took 50 minutes more for the winner to come, but it finally did with Kehl's wonder-goal.\n\nThe result was a huge one for BVB, who now could be one win away from booking their place in the Europa League next season. The manner in which it came is also significant, with team leaders in Marco Reus and Mats Hummels watching from the stands and keeper Roman Weidenfeller benched. For once, the game wasn't a case of hoping for a bit of magic from Reus.\n\nInstead, manager Jurgen Klopp made a few notable swaps, using Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Subotic as his interior defenders ahead of relatively inexperienced goalkeeper Mitch Langerak. The right-footed Erik Durm, who'd often filled in for Marcel Schmelzer at left-back previously, started his first match of 2015 on the right of defense, where he and Jakub Blaszczykowski formed a solid partnership that conjured memories of the Pole operating with compatriot Lukasz Piszczek during BVB's heyday.\n\nIt was by no means a pretty win for Dortmund, who, despite showing some positive signs, also underlined just how much they remain outsiders for the Pokal. By the time that the rest of the last four are decided, Klopp's side may be the least convincing one left.\n\nDespite scoring himself, Subotic made a big mistake to allow Firmino's goal. And Volland's score came from a set piece on which he was left under no pressure whatsoever before volleying home. The fact that Dortmund so easily saw their advantage reversed was hardly a surprise; such self-destruction has been endemic in their campaign.\n\nThis isn't to take anything away from Hoffenheim, who executed their goals outstandingly well. Their stars are Firmino and Volland, and sure enough, it had to be them who scored in arguably the biggest match of the season for the village club.\n\nFirmino's and Volland's best efforts weren't enough to secure victory, but they (as well as many previous and more to come) have undoubtedly played well enough to gather interest from potential suitors in Germany and abroad. Firmino has already begun to assert himself in the Brazil national team, and Volland will have a chance to shine as Germany's captain at the under-21 European Championship this summer.\n\nThe prevailing narrative ultimately was Dortmund finding a new way to win as they showed a glimmer of the collectivism and fighting spirit that had brought them to the Champions League final in 2013. Rallying back after losing the lead, pinning Hoffenheim back at times and claiming victory from an unlikely sourceâ€”this is the kind of victory that they needed.\n\nThe fact that they managed it without many star players is equally important. It will embolden those who normally play a muted role and ease the burden from the shoulders of those usually expected to deliver.\n\nDortmund will predictably be tired heading into the weekend, and many times before this season, they struggled to build momentum after a good performance. It could well be that they again fail to follow up a big win with another positive result, but at least the faithful fans were treated to one vintage performance from their club that had a happy ending. It'd been a long time coming."
