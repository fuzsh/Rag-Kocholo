        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have completed the signing of Germany international Pascal Groß from Brighton & Hove Albion.\n\nGroß, 33, returns to the Bundesliga after seven seasons in the English Premier League. The former Hoffenheim, Karlsruher and Ingolstadt midfielder has signed a two-year deal through to 30 June 2026.\n\nUpon his signing, Groß said: “I’m delighted to be a Borussia Dortmund player. Signing for this club is a huge deal for me, as I’ve been a Dortmund fan since I was a kid.\n\n\"I’ll try to repay the club’s faith in me by playing my game, and I can’t wait to play alongside my new teammates in front of the BVB fans at the Signal Iduna Park and to work hard with everyone here to achieve our ambitious goals.”\n\nGroß made 228 English Premier League appearances during his time at Brighton, including 36 last season. He produced 30 goals and 45 assists, with his 10 provisions in last season his best return yet at senior level.\n\nThe midfielder ranks in the top 10 for all time appearances as a Seagull, and after playing a crucial role securing the club's first-ever European campaign for the 2023/24 season, he's widely considered as one of Brighton's greatest-ever players.\n\nThe eight-time Germany international, who was part of Julian Nagelsmann's UEFA Euro 2024 squad, previously made 70 Bundesliga appearances for Hoffenheim and Ingolstadt.\n\nBVB managing director Lars Ricken said: “Pascal has become a top performer at the highest level over the last few years. He will give us more solidity and flexibility, and with his experience he will be leader who has a very positive impact for us. And we’re especially pleased to sign him because he has been a Borussia Dortmund fan since he was very young.”\n\nSporting director Sebastian Kehl added: “We’re delighted to bring Pascal back to the Bundesliga. His composure on the ball, his outstanding passing and positional play and his versatility will add a new dimension to our team.\n\n\"But Pascal also has a keen eye for goal, posing a direct and indirect goal threat in many areas. We have no doubt that he will improve how we play and that he will be a real asset to us with his will to win and his personality.”"
