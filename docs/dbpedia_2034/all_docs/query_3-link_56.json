        "text": "The play unfolded with precision, like so many of Borussia Dortmund’s goals have this season. A nudge with the side of a foot sent the ball from the middle of the field down the right wing. A perfectly placed cross put it, on a single hop, into the path of Erling Haaland, as he approached the penalty area on a sprint. And then Haaland, a 19-year-old Norwegian striker who seems to be on the cusp of becoming world soccer’s next great scorer, redirected it into the corner of the net with a left-footed flick.\n\nHaaland raised a finger and wheeled off toward the corner flag. Two of his teammates chased after him. Goals are relatively uncommon in soccer — most games have fewer than three — and every one of them is an occasion for players to converge and celebrate.\n\n“The first instinct when you score,” says Gio Reyna, another Dortmund teammate, “is to give a hug to the player who gave you the pass.”\n\nBut if the goal was routine for Dortmund this season, the circumstances on that third Saturday in May decidedly were not. The looming threat of the coronavirus had shut down the Bundesliga, the top level of German soccer, for more than two months, and the season had just resumed under a strict protocol that forbade things like hugs. Haaland and his two teammates stood a few feet away from each other and performed a subdued dance.\n\nIt was the first goal in the Bundesliga since March 11, a few days before Germany began closing down the country. By the next weekend, games of all kinds had stopped, in America and across Europe. One of the many disruptions of this Covid-19 spring has been the disappearance of organized professional sports. (There have been exceptions: A couple of Asian baseball leagues began play in April, for example, and soccer games have been held, to near universal disapproval, in Belarus.) In several countries, seasons have been canceled entirely and champions crowned. Other leagues remain in suspended animation. The Premier League, in England, recently announced that its games would start being played again on June 17. The N.B.A. and N.H.L. have released provisional plans to resume in July, though details remain sketchy. Major League Baseball still hopes to work out a way to restart spring training if players and owners can stop squabbling over terms. The N.F.L. looks toward the fall with uncertainty. So far, among the world’s major sports leagues, only the Bundesliga has managed a successful return.\n\nThe game in Dortmund that Saturday afternoon was, with four others going on simultaneously across Germany, the first since the shutdown. The atmosphere felt surreal. Dortmund attracts more fans — 81,154 of them on average, this season — than any other club in Europe. But because large gatherings have been banned in Germany until October, only a few journalists and club executives were allowed in the stands. Players on the sidelines sat several feet apart and wore protective masks.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
