        "text": "Liverpool head coach Arne Slot insists he is keen to strengthen his squad following their two pre-season friendlies at Anfield on Sunday.\n\nThe Reds are the only Premier League side yet to make a signing in the transfer window so far, and have been linked with a move for Real Sociedad's Martin Zubimendi.\n\nSlot's reign as Jurgen Klopp's successor has proved to be a seamless transition, winning three of his five games in charge (two draws).\n\nThe latest of which came on his Anfield debut, securing a 4-1 win over Sevilla, followed by a goalless draw against Las Palmas in a behind-closed doors match.\n\nAnd while the Dutchman is confident signings will arrive on Merseyside, he was quick to acknowledge the strong Liverpool squad he has inherited.\n\n\"I think as a club like we are, we are always looking if we can strengthen the squad. But it’s not so easy to strengthen the squad if you see both games today,\" said Slot.\n\n\"I’ve said many times before that I’ve inherited a really strong team and if we can and if we think it’s possible, we will strengthen the squad. But only if we think we can and if it’s possible.\n\nBoth matches at Anfield saw several first-team players in action, with all of Liverpool's representatives at the Copa America and Euro 2024 all back with the squad.\n\nThe likes of Virgil Van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Darwin Nunez all featured on Sunday, but Slot said his players are not quite where he would like them to be in regards to their fitness.\n\n\"No, ideally we would have had them from the start, all of them,\" Slot started. \"Then, players like Virgil [van Dijk] and all the others that went off after 60, 70 minutes could have played the whole game. But I am pleased, if you look at the situation.\n\n\"These players had to go to a holiday, a lot of them came back really strong. And the ones I had from the start stayed fit for all the time.\n\n\"Yeah, pleased with the fitness level the team has, and also without injuries at the moment, and that is an important thing in pre-season.\"\n\nTammy Abraham is relishing his return to Serie A action with Roma, labelling the upcoming campaign as his season to shine under Daniele De Rossi.\n\nAbraham, who scored 27 goals in his debut season with the Italian side, spent much of last year on the sidelines after sustaining an ACL injury against Spezia in June.\n\nDespite his absence, the Giallorossi were among the top scorers in Italy's top flight, with only Inter (89), Milan (76) and Atalanta (72) scoring more than Roma's 65 league goals.\n\nAbraham has netted 37 goals in his 119 appearances since his move from Chelsea back in 2021, becoming the first English player in thirty years to score more than 10 goals in a Serie A season.\n\nThe Englishman is keen to hit the ground running when Roma start their league campaign against Cagliari next week.\n\n\"Since the first day here in Rome I have wanted to demonstrate my passion for football and my desire to help the club\", Abraham said.\n\n\"I am a smiling and always positive person. This is my first post-injury preparation, it is my season and I want to show that I am back.\n\n\"The rumours, obviously, are nice, it means you are doing well, but I am here with Roma and I am available to do my best.\"\n\nRio Ferdinand remains \"uncertain\" about Matthijs de Ligt ahead of his reported £42.9million switch from Bayern Munich to Manchester United.\n\nDe Ligt, who made 30 appearances in all competitions for Bayern last term, is set to reunite with Erik ten Hag at Old Trafford having played under the Dutchman at Ajax.\n\nUnited are after defensive reinforcements following the departures of Raphael Varane and Willy Kambwala, having just endured a campaign that saw them concede the most goals in a season in their Premier League history (58).\n\nHowever, Ferdinand, who made 312 appearances across a 12-year stint with the Red Devils, is unsure whether De Ligt's arrival will solve their issues.\n\n\"I watched him at Ajax and he was brilliant in that year when Erik ten Hag was the manager, and they got to the semi-final [of the Champions League],\" Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel.\n\n\"He was brilliant, commanding, everything you want in a defender.\n\n\"He's had a lot of injuries, hasn't started many games over the last two or three years and Man United are spending £45-50million on him.\n\n\"Is he going to come into Man United and make a difference? I think it's a big ask for him and all eyes are going to be on him.\n\n\"Big pressure, big opportunity for him, but there's a lot of uncertainty I think with this signing because of his previous seasons with two big clubs (Juventus and Bayern Munich) not going as well as we'd have anticipated.\"\n\nHe then added: \"I don't think he's the answer, but it's a great opportunity for him to go in there and go, 'You know what guys? I'm going to rectify my last couple of seasons.\n\n\"That's not the real me, and I'm going to show you.\""
