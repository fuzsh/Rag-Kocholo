        "text": "The Bundesliga club conducted a virtual interaction with Asian media outlets and everybody was keen on the winger's situation.\n\nBorussia Dortmund as a club have had a tremendous fan following all over the globe and the club also leaves no stone unturned to connect with their supporters. Present at a virtual press conference, board member and former captain Sebastian Kehl and midfielder Thomas Delaney talked to the Asian media and answered several questions.\n\nKehl has been the face of BVB for a long time now as he was the captain of the side and now he is associated at the managerial level. So it has been a long journey for the former German international as he spoke about the transition from professional football to management.\n\n\"First of all when I retired from professional football with Dortmund, I did a World tour for some months. It was really good to spend more time with my family. But I also used that time to work on my coaching license. I did multiple jobs, worked as a TV expert, studied management and was trying to figure out what's next. It was a good process for me but I was throughout involved with BVB, living in the same city and my heart was always with the club. Then Michael Zorc asked me to join the board two years ago and I decided to take that step.\"\n\n\"I am very happy to be here and I believe the club is very professional and has a lot of potential. It was an easy decision to make. There were some difficulties because the team was scoring goals, winning titles and I was not on the pitch anymore. After a long career these things are not easy to handle,\" the 40-year said reminiscing the changes in his life after swapping roles.\n\nNext up, when he was asked about the lingering rumours of Jadon Sancho leaving Dortmund this summer with Manchester United heavily interested in the player, Kehl completely rubbished the claims and said the English forward is happy at Signal Iduna Park. \"We have repeatedly mentioned that Jadon will stay and everybody is very happy including him. His contract runs till 2023 and it is a very relaxed situation for all of us. He is happy and you can see that on the training ground, he is having a lot of fun here.\"\n\nOne thing BVB are proud of are their massive fan following and the stadium atmosphere that is created by the fans. But in testing times of COVID-19, the Bundesliga along with all the other leagues across Europe had to play behind closed doors. According to Kehl, it has been a disaster for the team to not have fans.\n\n\"Playing without fans in that stadium is a disaster. It makes no good. But it was the only chance to play. We did not ask for more. We have to accept that politicians will make decisions and there are more important things than sport. Hopefully, we can bring in some fans in the near future and the great atmosphere will come back to Dortmund. We are losing around â‚¬4m every game as there no spectators.\"\n\n\"It is hard to plan for the future and all big clubs are losing money on that front. The financial losses are in every club and hopefully, we can come out of this situation very soon. We are still working on the plans. We cannot give a number right now. The decision will be made by the end of August or the start of September. It is a hard decision to make but hopefully when the number of infected people decreases, we can have fans in the stadium,\" Sebastian Kehl added.\n\nAmong the array of talents present at the Signal Iduna Park, a new starlet, Jude Bellingham has caught the eye of the millennial football fans. The young midfielder has followed the footsteps of compatriot Jadon Sancho, snubbing several top European clubs.\n\nHowever, Thomas Delaney was very impressed with the 17-year-old midfielder and feels that he has the potential to be a future star at Dortmund. \"Jude (Bellingham) has impressed everybody. He is a very good player. No discrimination of age and he will get his chances sooner or later. He has a big reach and we should see more of that young player in the near future,\" concluded the 28-year old Denmark international."
