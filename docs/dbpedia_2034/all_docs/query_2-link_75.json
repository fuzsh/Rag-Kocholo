        "text": "FIFA World Cup\n\nGermany 2006\n\nBits and Bobs\n\nBush not a football fan\n\nAfp, Berlin\n\nUS President George W. Bush admitted he was not a big fan of soccer, saying it was not played much in the United States when he was young, Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported Sunday.\n\nThe 32-nation, June 9 to July 9, World Cup finals are to take place in 12 German cities this summer with the United States, who reached the quarter-finals in the last soccer showcase in 2002, having qualified again this time.\n\n\"When I was young, I did not see a single soccer match. Where I came from, football wasn't played,\" Bush said. \"The sport simply did not exist. Therefore there is a whole generation of Americans who are not really football fans.\n\n\"However there is a new generation of Americans who have grown up with soccer. For them, the World Cup is of great interest and it's the most important sporting event in the world.\n\n\"And some of us, the old guys, are beginning to understand how important the World Cup is for the entire world.\"\n\nKehl injury not serious\n\nReuters, Frankfurt\n\nAn ankle injury to Germany midfielder Sebastian Kehl in Borussia Dortmund's match against Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday turned out to be less serious than first feared.\n\nGermany assistant coach Joachim Loew said on Sunday that Kehl had suffered only a strained ligament and not a tear, as first feared.\n\n\"That's the best news of the day that Sebastian Kehl was not hurt as badly as we first thought,\" Loew said. \"He is going to play a big role in our planning.\"\n\nKehl suffered the injury late in a 1-1 draw against Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga.\n\nThe 26-year-old made his comeback for Germany after a long absence in a 4-1 win over the United States in March.\n\nFergie urges seniors to shoulder burden\n\nAfp, London\n\nAlex Ferguson has called on a quartet of senior English players to step up to the plate in the World Cup.\n\nIn the likely absence of star striker Wayne Rooney for at least some part of the tournament, Ferguson urged Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Joe Cole and particularly David Beckham to step forward and take responsibility for England's World Cup bid.\n\nEven before Rooney broke his foot at Chelsea last weekend, the Manchester United boss was unhappy at the burden of expectation being placed on the young striker's shoulders to carry the fight for England in Germany this summer.\n\nFerguson, however, does not believe Rooney's absence means England are now a forlorn hope to win the competition.\n\n\"I said before there was too much being put on Wayne's shoulders,\" said Ferguson. \"Now the emphasis has to change.\n\n\"Step forward Steven Gerrard, step forward Frank Lampard, step forward Joe Cole, step forward David Beckham. These guys are all more experienced and older than Wayne Rooney.\n\n\"David in particular has played in World Cups and European Cup Finals. He is the captain.\n\n\"Now they all have an opportunity to make an impact.\n\n\"You can never say one player is going to decide everything, especially a young player because they lack consistency and can always have a bad game.\n\n\"Even without Wayne, England have a lot going for them. It is certainly not a hopeless cause.\"\n\nFerguson cites strength in depth in central defence, the massive improvement in Tottenham's Paul Robinson, whom he rates as \"the best goalkeeper England have had for quite a while\" and the likely fitness of Ashley Cole as major reasons to be optimistic.\n\nHowever, he does stop short of actually tipping England to win the tournament.\n\n\"It is not a forlorn hope but I always think the World Cup is about preparation and I believe English football is suited to England doing well in it,\" he said.\n\n\"I know the players will have a bigger rest than normal this year but it is difficult to think you could go through an English season and then peak in the summer.\"\n\nWhile Ferguson has pledged to do everything he can to get Rooney fit, even to the extent of having an oxygen chamber transported to United's Carrington training ground, he remains dubious about the 20-year-old's chances of recovering in time.\n\nEven if Rooney ultimately has to suffer the bitter disappointment of missing out, Ferguson is confident he will enjoy plenty of World Cups throughout a lengthy career.\n\n\"The important thing is that Wayne has a future,\" said Ferguson.\n\n\"At his age, he could still play in four World Cups.\n\n\"It would be a disappointment for him if he missed it but this is not his last chance.\n\n\"All he has to do now is listen to common sense. We can do no more than try our best for him. Hopefully, it will be good enough.\"\n\nLennon in dreamland\n\nReuters, London\n\nTottenham Hotspur's teenage sensation Aaron Lennon has found himself overwhelmed by speculation that he might be part of England's World Cup squad as he has hardly got used to playing in the Premier League.\n\nLennon, who turned 19 last month, has emerged as everybody's favourite dark horse for Sven-Goran Eriksson's party for Germany, despite never previously appearing in a full senior squad.\n\nThe winger's priceless attribute of searing pace, together with terrific ball control and the ability to provide a pinpoint cross, makes him the sort of player that Eriksson could just take a chance on.\n\nLennon, however, is struggling to take it all in. \"Everything's happened so quickly for me, it's unbelievable,\" he told journalists this week.\n\n\"What has happened to me is almost too fantastic to be true. The World Cup? I never imagined I might be part of it. I'd love to go, what footballer wouldn't? But everything has moved on so quickly for me that it's difficult to take in the possibility.\n\n\"I have just been trying to do my best for Spurs and only ever thought I would watch the World Cup on television.\"\n\nLennon joined Spurs from Leeds United last July having become the Premier League's youngest player when he made his Leeds debut against his current club in August 2003 at the age of 16 years 121 days.\n\nHe got an unexpectedly early opportunity at Spurs after Wayne Routledge cracked a bone in his foot at Portsmouth in the first game of the season and has been in and around the first team ever since.\n\n\"You quickly learn that you have to take opportunities when they arise,\" he said.\n\nWith Wayne Rooney likely to miss the World Cup and Michael Owen battling to get back to form after his broken toe, the door could yet open for Lennon.\n\n\"I remember as a kid watching Michael and that stunning solo goal against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. They (Owen and Rooney) were both 18, younger than me now, and they set the world alight.\n\n\"I'm not saying for one minute that I could ever make the same impact but obviously it would be a dream come true to go to Germany and then maybe come off the bench and help swing a result.\n\n\"My life is amazing. It's seems no time at all since I was kicking a ball around in the streets of Leeds with my brother.\""
