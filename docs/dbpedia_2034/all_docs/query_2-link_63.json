        "text": "Borussia Dortmund liked what they saw from Sebastian Kehl in the Champions League.\n\nDortmund lost 2-1 at home in the first leg of their quarter-final tie against Atletico Madrid, and things got heated on the touchline.\n\nIn the 58th minute, with the score 2-0, Atelti kept on playing while Emre Can was down injured.\n\nUniquely in German football, sporting directors often sit on the bench, and BVB’s Kehl was in earshot of Atleti manager Diego Simeone when this happened.\n\nSomething clearly provoked the Argentine, who turned to argue with Kehl and things got very heated as the director didn’t back down a millimetre.\n\nAccording to BILD, the strong-man showing from Kehl impacted the players and it was credited for their comeback.\n\nFor his part, head coach Edin Terzic told DAZN: “I didn’t notice the scene. But that’s part of the game.\n\n“You know that you not only need eleven players on the pitch, but also all the boys on the bench, all the coaches and the fact that things can get heated in the coaching zone is nothing new. That doesn’t surprise us.”\n\nMeanwhile, Sky pundit Michael Ballack was full of praise for Kehl, saying: “We know the behaviour of Atlético and especially of the coach. You can’t just let everything go their way.\n\n“If the referee does not intervene, it is certainly necessary to call him to order every now and then.”"
