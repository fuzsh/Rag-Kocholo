        "text": "VfL Wolfsburg are reportedly exploring the possibility of bringing in Sebastian Kehl from Borussia Dortmund as their new managing director for sport.\n\nIt was a big surprise when Borussia Dortmund announced Lars Ricken as their new managing director for sport last month, rather than promoting current sporting director Sebastian Kehl.\n\nAccording to Wolfsburger Allgemeine Zeitung, the decision caused \"great frustration\" for Kehl, who has publicly admitted that he was disappointed when he found out he wasn't being promoted.\n\n\"Of course you're disappointed at first. I think that's human nature,\" Kehl said.\n\nThe local paper goes on to suggest that Wolfsburg could take advantage of Kehl's frustration to lure him to the Volkswagen Arena.\n\nDie Wölfe are looking for a new managing director for sport after parting company with Marcel Schäfer, who is expected to take up a new role at RB Leipzig.\n\nAccording to the report, Wolfsburg have made Kehl their top target and are likely to intensify their efforts to land him after Borussia Dortmund's Champions League final against Real Madrid on 1 June."
