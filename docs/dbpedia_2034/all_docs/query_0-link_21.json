        "text": "On Saturday evening, Borussia Dortmund returned from the winter break in style with a 3-0 win away to Darmstadt. With Jadon Sancho inspiring Die Schwarzgelben to an important three points, BvB appear to be heading in the right direction as the Hinrunde draws to a close.\n\nHowever, it is not all rosy for everyone at Dortmund. With Mats Hummels missing from the matchday squad due to an infection, club captain Emre Can was instructed to fill in at centre-half.\n\nThis is despite Niklas Süle remaining on the bench, leaving many to question why the German international failed to make the starting XI. However, after speaking to Sky 90, Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl would state the reasons as to why:\n\n“Edin made the decision to place Emre in central defence and was thus reacting to the last few days. Edin wasn’t 100 percent satisfied, not even in the training camp.” Kehl would then also comment on Süle’s fitness issues: “He has been confronted with these issues again and again in the past. Of course, it’s stressful for him, but I also notice that he’s willing to work on it. He hasn’t had much playing time in the last few weeks and has brought with him a certain frustration and a certain disappointment from this time.”\n\nDespite this, Dortmund are not looking to offload the 28-year-old: “Niklas has incredible skills and still has big goals this year. He wants to go back to the national team and play in this European Championship. He wants to be an important part of Borussia Dortmund. We will support him there too.”\n\nHowever, Kehl would then honestly say, “We had hoped for more in the last few months. We signed him on a free transfer, which was a good deal for us. He was a national player and was at a very good age. Niklas can do more. He has to step on the gas now, and that’s what I expect from him in the next few months.”\n\nWith the European championships just around the corner, Süle will have to up his game quickly if he is to make the Germany squad. With his ability to also cover at right-back, he could be a crucial member of the Germany squad in the summer, with a positive end to the season."
