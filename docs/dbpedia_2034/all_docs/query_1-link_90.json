        "text": "Dortmund reached the UEFA Champions League final last season.\n\nWith the 2024–25 Bundesliga season fast approaching, Borussia Dortmund commenced their pre-season preparations in the summer in order to potentially win some silverware next campaign.\n\nAfter finishing fifth in the Bundesliga last season along with reaching the UEFA Champions League final, the Dortmund board and former head coach Edin Terzić decided to mutually part ways this summer despite a successful club campaign.\n\nFormer Turkish international Nuri Şahin was appointed as the new first-team manager on a three-year contract. In what is just his second managerial role of a young coaching career, Şahin will look to guide Dortmund to the top of German football.\n\nIn order to assist Nuri Şahin with a strong team core, the Dortmund hierarchy, spearheaded by their passionate Sporting Director Sebastian Kehl, have already completed some smart business this summer.\n\nThis includes the incredible double swoop of defender Waldemar Anton and striker Serhou Guirassy from league rivals VfB Stuttgart for a total transfer package of around €40 million. Both players were instrumental in Stuttgart enjoying a stellar campaign last season, as they finished second in the Bundesliga and qualified for the UEFA Champions League.\n\nAnton made a total of 37 appearances across all competitions, while also registering one goal and four assists in the process. He was also a part of Germany’s final squad for Euro 2024. On the other hand, Guirassy was Stuttgart’s top goal scorer, bagging an astounding 30 goals along with three assists in 30 appearances across all competitions.\n\nBorussia Dortmund also completed the bargain signing of experienced and versatile midfielder Pascal Groß from Brighton & Hove Albion. During his amazing seven-year stint at Brighton, Groß was undoubtedly one of the most well-rounded midfielders in the club’s rich history.\n\nOn the other hand, Borussia Dortmund have also offloaded several key players this summer in order to create much-needed space both in the squad and wage structure for potential transfer targets.\n\nThe biggest departure of the transfer window so far for the German club in terms of revenue generation has been the permanent sale of midfielder Olinho to Portuguese side Rio Ave for just over a million.\n\nClub legends such as Marco Reus and Mats Hummels left Dortmund as free agents on the expiration of their respective contracts at the end of the season.\n\nVersatile fullback Marius Wolf is also still available as a free agent on the market after the expiration of his Dortmund contract in the summer. However, right-back Mateu Morey joined Spanish outfit RCD Mallorca as a free agent.\n\nFollowing their stellar loan spells, both Ian Maatsen and Jadon Sancho returned to their respective parent clubs owing to the expiration of the deals at the end of the season.\n\nWith Borussia Dortmund far from done in terms of bolstering their overall squad, further potential incomings and outgoings are expected in the remainder of the summer transfer window.\n\nBorussia Dortmund New Signings:\n\nBorussia Dortmund Departures:"
