        "text": "Borussia Dortmund have won the chase to sign SC Freiburg's German international sweeper Sebastian Kehl.\n\nThe 21-year-old had also been courted by Bayern Munich, but Kehl has opted to join Dortmund instead.\n\nHe is expected to sign a four-year contract with the 1997 European champions.\n\nKehl did not say whether he would move immediately or after the current season ends in May.\n\nDortmund have to register the transfer with the league by 15 January for Kehl to join them for the second half of the current season.\n\nBut Bayern Munich warned they still had a claim on the player, arguing he had already pledged to join them.\n\n\"Kehl and Dortmund are going to have to get in touch with us,\" said Bayern Munich spokesman Markus Hoerwick.\n\n\"Kehl gave us a verbal promise and in the view of our lawyer that is valid.\"\n\nBundesliga domination\n\nDortmund president Gerd Niebaum said he was confident of prevailing in the battle with Bayern.\n\n\"The facts speak for us,\" said Niebaum, a lawyer himself.\n\n\"Kehl did not have a written contract with Bayern, and that's all that counts.\"\n\nA stylish attacking player regarded as one of Germany's top prospects, Kehl joined Freiburg in 2000 from second division Hanover 96 for just over £60,000.\n\nRecent media reports suggested Dortmund were ready to pay just over a £1m for the player.\n\n\"We want Sebastian as soon as possible,\" said Dortmund sport director Michael Zorc.\n\n\"Even if that means we would have to pay more than that.\"\n\nBayern and Dortmund have dominated the Bundesliga for the last decade, sharing seven league titles and winning two of the last five European Cups."
