        "text": "Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has played down the club’s chances of signing Jadon Sancho on a permanent basis from Manchester United in the summer.\n\nFrozen out of United’s first-team by head coach Erik ten Hag, Sancho secured a temporary return to Dortmund earlier this month and the 23-year-old claimed an assist in his first game back in Germany against Darmstadt 98 at the weekend.\n\nIt comes just two-and-a-half years after Sancho left Dortmund to seal a £73million switch to Old Trafford and the England international will be hoping to find his feet again in the Bundesliga – where he previously enjoyed tremendous success – over the next few months.\n\nSancho’s route back into United’s first-team appears to be blocked as long as Ten Hag remains in the hot seat, with their relationship seemingly beyond repair, and Europe’s elite will be keeping an eye on the situation ahead of the summer transfer window.\n\nDortmund have been mooted as possible long-term solution for Sancho and the attacker has made it clear he is delighted to be back in BVB colours once again, describing the club as ‘like a home’ upon his return.\n\nHowever, Kehl is anticipating strong competition for Sancho’s signature in the summer and feels Dortmund could be priced out of a potential deal for the Englishman.\n\nAsked to rate Dortmund’s chances of signing Sancho at the end of the campaign, Kehl told Sky90: ‘Realistically speaking, not that much.\n\n‘Manchester United paid over €85m for him two-and-a-half years ago and there was no way for us to secure a purchase option in a way that was economically viable.\n\nThe salary is one thing, the transfer package is another.\n\n‘If he develops in the way we hope, then other clubs will become active in the summer and then he will probably be a category of player that will be difficult for Borussia Dortmund to afford. But we’ll see what happens in the summer.’\n\nTen Hag and Sancho’s tumultuous relationship reached boiling point back in September when the England forward was dropped against Arsenal for apparently displaying a lack of professionalism and effort in training.\n\nSancho responded by accusing Ten Hag of making him a scapegoat for the side’s poor results and refused to apologise which appeared to be the final straw for United’s manager.\n\nDespite Sancho’s public fallout with Ten Hag, however, former United boss Ralf Rangnick has revealed the attacker’s behaviour was impeccable during their time together in Manchester.\n\n‘He had his best time in Dortmund and, when he was healthy, he always played for me. However, he wasn’t as carefree as in Dortmund,’ Rangnick told Sky Germany.\n\n‘But that was also due to the overall situation. When he was fit, he was set and did well under me.\n\n‘He no longer had a chance in Manchester. He now has to get back into a rhythm and really into shape in Dortmund. From his point of view, the change makes perfect sense.’\n\nAsked whether reports of a poor work ethic matched up with the player he knew at United, Rangnick added: ‘In the six months I had him, there wasn’t a single discipline problem.\n\n‘On the contrary. He is a calm and pleasant guy.’\n\nMORE : Graeme Souness questions Arsenal’s move for Kai Havertz and delivers verdict on Ivan Toney interest\n\nMORE : Benfica deny talks with Manchester United over Joao Neves transfer\n\nFor more stories like this, check our sport page.\n\nFollow Metro Sport for the latest news on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram."
