        "text": "Fullkrug, 31, has been allowed to leave Dortmund’s training camp to finalize the move, which would see him become the latest addition to Julen Lopetegui’s squad.\n\nKehl admitted that Dortmund had initially been reluctant to sell Fullkrug, but the player’s desire for a new challenge in the Premier League has changed their stance.\n\n‘The events of the last few days have been unfolding rapidly,’ Kehl told Sport1. ‘It was not our intention to bring the Niclas Fullkrug issue up again like this. But it has developed very quickly in the last two days.’\n\nFullkrug’s departure would leave Dortmund in a tricky situation, with summer signing Serhou Guirassy set to miss the start of the season through injury and Youssoufa Moukouko potentially leaving the club.\n\nBut for West Ham, the signing of Fullkrug would be a major coup. The Germany international has a proven track record, winning the Bundesliga’s Golden Boot in 2023 and scoring 13 goals in 21 appearances for his country.\n\nWith his experience and mentality, Fullkrug could be the perfect solution to West Ham’s striker woes. And with talks moving quickly, it seems likely that he will be wearing claret and blue soon.”\n\nNiclas Fullkrug: The Clinical Finisher West Ham United Want\n\nWest Ham United’s pursuit of Borussia Dortmund striker Niclas Fullkrug has been making headlines in recent days. The 31-year-old German forward has established himself as one of the most prolific goal-scorers in the Bundesliga, and his clinical finishing ability has caught the attention of Hammers manager Julen Lopetegui.\n\nFullkrug’s Rise to Prominence\n\nFullkrug’s journey to the top has been nothing short of remarkable. He began his career at Werder Bremen, working his way up through the ranks before making his professional debut in 2014. His impressive form earned him a move to Hannover 96 in 2016, where he continued to hone his skills and develop into a deadly finisher.\n\nGoal-Scoring Record\n\nFullkrug’s goal-scoring record speaks for itself. In 2023, he won the Bundesliga’s Golden Boot, netting an impressive 19 goals in 31 appearances for Werder Bremen. His ability to find the back of the net has been consistent throughout his career, making him a coveted asset for any team.\n\nWhat Fullkrug Brings to West Ham\n\nFullkrug’s signing would bring a new dimension to West Ham’s attack. His clinical finishing ability, combined with his experience and work rate, would make him an excellent addition to Lopetegui’s squad. He would provide a different option upfront, allowing the Hammers to vary their attacking approach and pose a greater threat to opposing teams.\n\nPersonal Qualities\n\nOff the pitch, Fullkrug is known for his humility and dedication. He is a player who leads by example, and his positive attitude would undoubtedly have a beneficial impact on the West Ham dressing room.\n\nAs the transfer saga unfolds, one thing is clear – Niclas Fullkrug would be an excellent signing for West Ham United. His goal-scoring prowess and personal qualities make him an attractive proposition for Lopetegui’s side."
