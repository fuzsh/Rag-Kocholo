        "text": "Borussia Dortmund director Sebastian Kehl has expressed criticism about defender Niklas Süle. The 49-time German international is no longer a regular at BVB, the opponent of PSV in the round of 16 of the Champions League.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nSüle's transition to Dortmund's dynamic and tactically demanding playstyle has been a key point of discussion.\n\nKnown for their fast-paced and aggressive football, Dortmund requires defenders who are not only physically robust but also tactically astute. Süle's adaptation to this style, coming from a different tactical environment at Bayern Munich, might be taking longer than expected. This adjustment period is critical for him to integrate successfully into Edin Terzic's system.\n\nCompetition for Places\n\nThe competition for starting spots in Dortmund's defense is intense. With players like Emre Can and Nico Schlotterbeck delivering consistent performances, Süle faces the challenge of proving his worth to earn a regular spot. This competition, while challenging, can also serve as motivation for Süle to elevate his game and regain his top form.\n\nImpact of Past Injuries\n\nSüle's history with injuries, especially during his tenure at Bayern Munich, might be contributing to his current physical state. Recurring injuries can have a lasting impact on a player's fitness and agility. Dortmund's medical and training staff are likely focused on managing his workload and ensuring that he regains full fitness without risking further injuries.\n\nRole in Future Plans\n\nDespite the current challenges, Süle's role in Dortmund's long-term plans remains significant. His experience, skill set, and potential make him an asset for the team's future endeavors, both domestically and in European competitions. His ability to bounce back will be crucial for Dortmund's defensive strategies moving forward.\n\nSupport and Expectations\n\nThe support from the club, as expressed by Sebastian Kehl, is a vital factor in Süle's recovery and return to form. However, this support comes with expectations. The club expects Süle to demonstrate commitment and progress, reflecting the investment they have made in him. How Süle responds to these expectations in the upcoming matches and training sessions will be key to his future at the club.\n\nIn conclusion, Niklas Süle's situation at Borussia Dortmund is a complex interplay of adapting to a new tactical environment, overcoming physical challenges, and meeting the high expectations of a top Bundesliga club. His journey in the upcoming months will be crucial in determining his role and impact at Dortmund."
