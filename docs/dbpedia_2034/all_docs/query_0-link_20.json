        "text": "World Cup runner-up, Champions League finalist, German Champion, DFB Cup winner, derby hero – it’s a long list of accolades and equally as long as his chronic injury record. Sebastian Kehl has often been written off during his career; however, each time he has come back fighting and managers and teammates can always depend on him.\n\nHe is now set to sign off on Saturday (20:00 CEST) in Berlin. He announced the decision to end his career following the 2014/15 season almost a year ago. His last match sees BVB face VfL Wolfsburg in the DFB Cup final at the Olympiastadion.\n\nKehl’s son is his toughest critic\n\nHis career has been full of some unforgettable memories and he’s shared many a special moment with his family out on the pitch. Back in 2012, his son Luis, his toughest critic, who said his father didn’t score often enough, showed him how it’s done when he coolly slotted the ball into the back of the net in front of 80,520 fans. Nevertheless, Sebastian Kehl had just been crowned German Champion for the third time with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nLong injury list\n\nWhy was this scene, long after the final whistle of the decisive battle between the two Borussias, not only so beautiful but also important? It was special because it drew attention to one of many people who have supported Sebastian Kehl unconditionally through the good times as well as the bad. \"It was also a fantastic moment for my family,\" remarked Dortmund‘s number 5.\n\nTina, his wife, daughter Leni and Luis don’t just know Sebastian Kehl as a winner, a football star, a derby hero. They’ve lived every moment and been there through all the injuries and set-backs. A nasty muscle injury sidelined him for the entire season before that triumph and meant that he missed out on the first Championship, and Bundesliga trophy presentation, of the Jürgen Klopp era, which is also set to end in Berlin.\n\nFarewell in final in Berlin: \"perfectly written script\"\n\nThis moment marks an important turning point in Kehl’s career. Since then the 35-year-old has gone on to record a number of successes in numerous competitions. BVB completed the first double in the club’s history two weeks after securing the Bundesliga title, beating FC Bayern München 5-2 in the DFB Cup final.\n\nSpeaking about the fact that the last game of his career is the final in Berlin, he remarked that \"it’s fantastic, the script is almost perfectly written.\" He hasn’t scored often during the course of his career but he’s found the back of the net when it truly mattered this season and his contributions have been crucial in BVB’s cup journey. Kehl grabbed the late winner in the quarter-final against 1899 Hoffenheim and stepped up to convert a penalty in the semi-final shootout against FC Bayern München. \"I could once again play a decisive role,\" remarked Kehl. \"I could hardly imagine a better ending.\"\n\nTearful goodbye\n\nFollowing the 3-2 victory over Werder Bremen, which secured the club a spot in the Europa League, Kehl’s farewell at Signal-Iduna-Park was fitting and many had tears in their eyes. \"The send-off from the fans today was incredible,\" commented Kehl to DFB.de. He saw it as recognition for \"a special career\" – one which still isn’t completely over.\n\nNow it’s time for one last hurrah in Berlin on Saturday. \"Winning the DFB Cup would obviously be the icing on the cake of my final season,\" said Kehl.\n\nSo what’s he planning to do next?\n\nWhat is certain is that Kehl’s last official journey with the club won’t be his last ever trip. \"I’d like to travel and learn about life in other corners of the world. America, Africa, Asia – I’d like to visit all of these.\" Before then he’ll travel to Berlin for what could be a perfect ending. One way or another, Luis should be very proud of his father.\n\nKehl featured in his first ever DFB Cup game for Hannover 96 against Tennis Borussia Berlin back in 1998. Wolfsburg’s current manager Dieter Hecking was on his side that day. He led his side to glory in the DFB Cup almost 14 years later, triumphing over FC Bayern in the final.\n\ncreated by mmc/kr\n\nWorld Cup runner-up, Champions League finalist, German Champion, DFB Cup winner, derby hero – it’s a long list of accolades and equally as long as his chronic injury record.
