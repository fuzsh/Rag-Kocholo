Oh my goodness,\" former Tottenham defender Michael Dawson said on Sky Sports.\n\n\"It's an absolute mistake. It's ridiculous. It's unbelievable. I'm not sure what Dortmund were doing. It's a disaster, it's an absolute disaster.\"\n\nEx-Socceroos captain Craig Foster was more measured on Stan Sport.\n\n\"On the edge of the box, it's the most difficult pass,\" Foster said.\n\n\"OK, he (Kobel) plays into him, he (Maatsen) can give it back to the keeper here, which is the safest, he could maybe go across to (Emre) Can.\n\n\"But what you can't do is play a square pass.\"\n\nSamuel Lino then put Atletico into a 2-0 lead at halftime but Sebastien Haller gave Dortmund some hope by scoring in the second term.\n\nThe second leg is in Germany on Wednesday (AEST)."
