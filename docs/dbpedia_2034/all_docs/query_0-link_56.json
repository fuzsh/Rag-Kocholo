        "text": "“A few weeks ago, I made a personal request to Michael Zorc to stay with us for an extra year. We at BVB are all happy and thankful that he has complied with our request. Michael is a true Borusse and, as such, he was prepared to continue overseeing sporting matters at a time that is challenging for us all, and during which it is difficult to plan and tough to predict developments. This continuity will do us good,” said chief executive officer Hans-Joachim Watzke.\n\nMichael Zorc, who is still BVB’s record appearance-maker in the Bundesliga, declared: “We’re facing a period that will present significant challenges. It goes without saying that, during such a phase, I will stand by my club and make my contribution as we strive to put Borussia Dortmund on the best-possible footing together.”\n\nFollowing the contract extension with Michael Zorc, Hans-Joachim Watzke announced his intention “to speak with Sebastian Kehl about extending our cooperation soon too”. Kehl, who captained BVB for many years, has been head of the licensed player division since 2018."
