        "text": "Joachim Low has issued an upbeat bulletin on the fitness of Sebastian Kehl.\n\nGermany's assistant coach Joachim Low has issued an upbeat bulletin on the fitness of Sebastian Kehl.\n\nThe Borussia Dortmund midfielder hurt his ankle during Saturday's 1-1 draw with Eintracht Frankfurt and there were fears he could miss the World Cup.\n\nDortmund expressed concerns that Kehl had torn ligaments in his ankle, but tests have shown it is only a strain.\n\nThe results have lifted morale within the Germany camp, with Low confirming Kehl will be a key figure for the hosts.\n\n\"That's the best news of the day that Sebastian Kehl was not hurt as badly as we first thought,\" said Low.\n\n\"He is going to play a big role in our planning.\"\n\nKehl recently returned to the Germany squad after a near two-year absence from the international setup.\n\nHis outing against the United States in March was his first appearance since Jurgen Klinsmann became coach and he is due to make his country's 23-man squad for the finals."
