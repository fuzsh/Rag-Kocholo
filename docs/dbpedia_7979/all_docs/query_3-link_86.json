        "text": "Coleridge directed his Aids to Reflection (1825, 1831) to young men preparing for Christian vocations, missionaries in particular, and planned, but did not write, a seventh supplementary essay, which may be reconstructed from Coleridge's œuvres, to correct what he thought was inadequate preparation. Missionaries are educators whose preparation must include scientific biblical criticism: Christianity evolves with culture generally. Anthropography is required in order to foster inter-cultural exchange, including insight into a tradition's metaphors. Missionaries engage in proselytism, insists Coleridge, in the strictly limited sense of conversion through the exemplary conduct of the missionary as a fully realized human being.\n\n1 Muirhead, John, Coleridge as Philosopher (The Muirhead Library of Philosophy; New York, NY: The Humanities Press, 1930) 16Google Scholar. I am obliged to the late Maurice S. Elliott for underscoring “Missionaries” (Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Aids to Reflection [AR] [ed. John Beer; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1993] 6); Robert L. Fisher, Indo-European linguist for reading drafts; Noël Ramsey, student of metaphorical theology for checking references; Jamie S. Scott, cultural historian, Steve Mason, historian of Roman Judaea, and Christopher H. Ford, musician and health information technology strategist, for conversation; and the reviewers and editors for their inspiring counsel.\n\n28 Here are characterizations of superstition: “the prostration of the Mind before an unanalyzed Anomaly” (SW&F 1:126); “assertion of appearances derived from sense” (CM 3:216 n. 441); “External objects naturally produce sensation; but here sensation, as it were, produces the object” (Table Talk [TT] [ed. Carl Woodring; 2 vols.; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press,1990] 1:55); “Are not the Images clearly the Products of Sensations explained by the Fancy as in ordinary Dreams?” (CN 4:4908); and, “Thus the assigning of the name character and being of the Soul to a phantom or shape visually abstracted from the Body, under the name of Ghost, Spirit or Apparition, is a Superstition” (SW&F 2:903–4).\n\n30 The Friend (F) (ed. Barbara Rooke; 2 vols.; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 1:47. Superstition is implied in Logic (ed. J. R. de J. Jackson; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981): “This is the happy delirium, the healthful fever, of the physical, moral, and intellectual being, Nature's kind and providential gift to childhood” (8); “healthy fancy” (CN 4:4766); “A lovely Child contemplates his form in the Mirror & believes it another” (CN 4:5280).\n\n32 AR, 36; on fancy and superstition: “When the Invisible is sought for by means of the Fancy to the World without, and the Awe <is> is transferred to imaginary Powers . . . or to sensible objects . . . the Man becomes a Phantast in the one case and superstitious in the other” (AR 104–105 n. 9 [italics in original]).\n\n33 F 1:279–280; “the language of a tender superstition is the voice of nature itself” (F 1:546), see Wystan Hugh Auden, from “Moon Landing”: “Irreverence / is a greater oaf than Superstition” (https://allpoetry.com/Moon-Landing); CL 5:94–95. The persecution of the Covenanters made them look for hope “by supernatural channels, and in interferences unsanctioned by Reason” (CN 4:5035): “unsanctioned by Reason” implies superstition; Covenanters are called “Fanatics” in CN 4:5039. On “stove-like Heat” (for Saint Teresa) vs. “idea” see CN 5:6121.\n\n35 CL 5:37 (italics in original); “indiscriminate Bibliolatry” (SW&F 2:1142; 1165). Negatively, superstition is “baleful” (CM 1:330); “remorseless” (CM 1:517); “debasing and demoralizing” (CM 5:135); diseased: “shaking Palsy” (CM 5:188); “A Disease” (SW&F 1:434). Coleridge fell into “Self-centering Superstitions” when he practiced “Sortes Biblicæ” (CN 4:5419 and n). An alimentary metaphor: the exorcisms of the Synoptic gospels (none in John) are superstitious explanations of demons causing disease: “No! there can but one rational solution of these & similar passages—that we have the fact at third or fourth hand, without with the modifications & excrementitious adherences acquired during it's passage thro’ the intestinal canal of vulgar Superstitions” (CN 5:5561).\n\n41 CN has no subject index—“superstition”: CN 1 [1794–1804] 243, 312, 1541,1637; CN 2 [1804–1808] 2045, 2048, 2060, 2355, 2561, 2830; CN 3 [1808–1819] 3473, 3505, 3808, 3824, 3830, 3847, 3868, 4015 (“The account given by Stavorinus of the Chinese Xylomancer at Batavia may serve for the model for all the Children of Superstition, from the African Fetisch-worshipper or Oboe-wichtch to the Purchaser of Dr Solomon's Balm of Gilead, or King George's State-Lottery Ticket”), 4210, 4308, 4378, 4491 (“Superstition the Giant Shadow of Humanity with its back to the setting Sun of true Religion”), 4497; CN 4 [1819–1826] 4766, 4788, 4806, 4858, 4931, 4984, 4985, 5057, 5058, 5076–5079, 5081, 5215, 5123, 5187, 5204, 5215, 5276, 5300, 5315, 5319, 5323, 5334, 5398, 5454; CN 5 [1827–1834] 5556, 5596, 5606, 5680, 5801, 5836, 5844, 5848, 5872, 5927, 5932, 6029, 6087, 6121, 6185, 6253, 6279, 6337, 6394, 6396, 6474, 6615, 6661, 6666, 6735, 6737, 6778, 6781.\n\n43 CM 1:304–305. Coleridge agrees with Carey on the need for conversion at home: “and the face of most Christian countries presents a dreadful scene of ignorance, hypocrisy, and profligacy” (William Carey, An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians, to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens . . ., 1792) 65–66, http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/enquiry/anenquiry.pdf).\n\n45 Coleridge, Samuel Taylor, Biographia Literaria (ed. Engell, James and Bate, W. Jackson; 2 vols.; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1983)Google Scholar 1:252 (italics in original) and n. 1; “& then reflecting, as it were, on his own reflections . . . would not the knowledge thus acquired & communicated be a most valuable assistance to every man, who felt it his wish & believed it his duty, to attempt the fulfillment of the heaven-descended Precept, Know thyself—?” (CN 4:4931).\n\n55 CL 5:300 (italics in original). Leifchild writes: “His known habits of correctness and refinement caused many authors to commit their manuscripts to him for revision” (Memoir 388). Coleridge requested Hughes: “if you should have at any time half an hour's leisure” to look for anything objectionable in content or style in Friend and Lay Sermons (CL 6:1049).\n\n62 CN 5:6139: “Is it not permitted to suppose, as a probable hypothesis, that in the earliest times there was a Society of enlightened Men, a Sacred Brotherhood/Sethians, Astronomonic Kings, ‘Sons of God’—whose Missionaries were ?” (italics in original). Rather than the British and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS), Coleridge wishes for “A British and Foreign Human Society of Science and Literature—whose Duty it would be to watch over, record, and make known Works and Discoveries, wherever published, and as soon as published—to maint form a center of Correspondence with for the Men of Genius & Science in all countries & . . .” (CN 5:6579)—a global “clerisy” engaged in dialogue.\n\n69 CN 5:5558; “could I affix . . . the asterisk of spuriousness to the last Ch., or the latter Half of the last Chapter of St Mark” (CN 4:5372); “The last twelve verses of Mark's Gospel by on internal & external evidence are by all the later School of Biblical Criticism asterisked as spurious” (CM 3:3); “The last 12 verses of Mark the translator gives up, and with good reason, as spurious” (CM 4:474).\n\n71 Mason, Steve and Robinson, Tom, Early Christian Reader (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson, 2004) 3Google Scholar; Coleridge: “The 3 first Gospels . . . and the Epistles have all the appearance of occasional Writings, presupposing a previous communication of the Scheme, and the constituent Articles of faith, that formed it's exposition.—But when we turn to ecclesiastical History, we find nothing to confirm this so natural presumption” (CN 5:5997).\n\n78 AR 35. See AR 311 for “the sudden conversions,” which Coleridge likens to “contagious Fever-boils.” Jane Austen: “We do not much like Mr Cooper's new Sermons;—they are fuller of Regeneration & Conversion than ever—with the addition of his zeal in the cause of the Bible Society” (Jane Austen's Letters, [ed. Deirdre Le Faye; 4th ed.; Oxford University Press, 2011] 336); “Your cousin Edmund moves slowly, detained, perchance, by parish duties. There may be some old woman at Thornton Lacey to be converted” (Mansfield Park [New York: Penguin Classics, 2011] 366).\n\n83 CN 4:5254. Kathleen Coburn notes: “The earliest (16th-century) use had to do with describing the human body. In Coleridge's sense the OED records the first occurrence in 1834, the study of ‘the geographical distribution of the races of mankind, and their local variations; ethnography.’” The OED has recently added, in response to this writer's submission, that Coleridge's use is now the earliest: “1825 S. T. Coleridge Notebks. (2002) IV. 5254 Anthropography: or a Description of the different Races, and Varieties of Men, the effects of Climate, and Civilization . . . .” http://www.oed.com.ezproxy.library.yorku.ca/view/Entry/8426?redirectedFrom=anthropography#eid. In CN 5:5489 Coleridge says that anthropology is one of three bases of religion: “N.B. In my System—. . . Antecedent Grounds and Conditions of Religion.”\n\n87 CN 5:6785 (italics in original). CN 4:5421 (mistaking metaphors for “a component part of the truth itself”). Coleridge objected to Joseph Hughes's writing that salvation involved the suffering of a righteous person (CM 2:1187). Coleridge uses “redemption” non-metaphorically: “The Unitarian and the Calvinist equally strive to evacuate the Spiritual Mystery of our Redemption” (CN 5:6595; 6546); redemption may be the mesothesis between the Idea of the Trinity and the Fact of the Incarnation (CN 5:6762). See Hedley, Douglas, Coleridge, Philosophy and Religion: “Aids to Reflection” and the Mirror of the Spirit (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000)CrossRefGoogle Scholar, Chapter 5 “The great instauration: reflection as the renewal of the soul,” 229–265, where Hedley discusses a parallel (CN 5:6785) to AR 237.\n\n88 CN 5:6653 (italics in original). Many individuals, independently, may hold “the same truths, yet expressed in the greatest variety of terms and symbols, according to the presence or absence of a learned education, to the different climates, different positive Religions”: a global perspective (CM 4:258 [italics in original]).\n\n92 Coleridge says that “the great redemptive Process” is “the history of life which begins in its detachment from Nature and is to end in its union with God” (CM 3:919). Note that “final restoration” ( ) occurs in Acts 3:21, but “Luke-Acts lacks, and actively discourages, the sense of Jesus’ imminent return” (Mason and Robinson 468). CN 5:5780: “the illumination of the Apostles . . . was gradual and progressive” as shown by their first holding a “mistaken Notion of our Lord's all but immediate Return personally.”\n\n94 Lectures 1818–1819: On the History of Philosophy (Lect 1818–1819) (ed. J. R. de J. Jackson; 2 vols.; Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2000) 1:131. Coleridge comments: “all Europe has been the Dupe of Dupes in this respect” for thinking that the Brahmanical texts are equivalent to the Old Testament in its “noble conceptions of God” (CM 3:659): dated ca. 1816 (657).\n\n103 Harries, Natalie Tai, “‘The One Life Within Us and Abroad’: Coleridge and Hinduism” in Coleridge, Romanticism and the Orient: Cultural Negotiations (ed. Vallins, David, Oishi, Kaz, and Perry, Seamus; London: Bloomsbury, 2013) 131–144Google Scholar, and Natale, Antonella Riem, The One Life: Coleridge and Hinduism (New Delhi: Rawat Publications, 2005)Google Scholar, “Coleridge's Rejection” 74–77, who conclude that Coleridge rejected Hinduism finally. The marginalia on Dubois may date to 1828 (CM 2:339).\n\n120 CM 2:37–38 (italics in original). On verbal inspiration see Anthony John Harding, Coleridge and the Inspired Word (rpt. 2003; McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Ideas; Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press, 1985) 82–94, especially the reference to Essays and Reviews: “The great mass of the public continued in virtual ignorance of the whole question until the publication in 1860 of Essays and Reviews, which created a storm in the English churches that might well have been avoided if Coleridge's approach had at least been discussed and propagated more widely” (90). Benjamin Jowett's “On the Interpretation of Scripture” is particularly germane.\n\n125 CN 5:6146, November 1829; in January 1824 it was “inconceivable” that rain was the “principal cause” (italics in original) of a five-mile depth of water (CN 4:5104); re-populating the earth could not have been invented, so it is historical, says Coleridge (CN 5:6619, June–August 1831).\n\n131 In 1831: “Slavery—i.e. the perversion of a Person into a Thing—is contrary to the Spirit of Christianity <(say I)>—& therefore it is the duty of Christians to labor (as far as it is in their power & lies within the sphere of their immediate duties) for its ultimate removal from the Christian World—/” (CM 6:29); an “Act of Parliament” would be a means “contrary” to that end, says Coleridge.\n\n132 CN 5:5521 (italics in the original). “When the Ideas rise up within me, as independent Growths of my Spirit, and I then turn to the Epistles of Paul & John and to the Gospel of the latter, . . . the<se> . . . seem a Looking-glass to me in which I recognize the [?indirectly] same truths of as reflected Images of my Ideas—and when I begin with meditative Reading of those divine Writings, then they become the Objective completing and guaranteeing the reality of the subjective Truths in myself” (CN 5:5624 August 1827): “guaranteeing . . . in myself” guards against superstition. See also CM 3:20: “contemplating the Synopsis of the whole faith in Christ in the Mirror of the Idea.”"
