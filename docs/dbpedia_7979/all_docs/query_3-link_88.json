        "text": "Readers who have read The Deathly Hallows Lectures know that I think a very helpful lens through which to look at Rowling’s work and especially the Hogwarts Saga finale is the logos epistemology of Samuel Taylor Coleridge. That is not a subject I want to revisit in depth here, but for the passersby who won’t read the relevant chapters in Lectures that make the connection between Coleridge’s understanding of God, man, and the world and Rowling’s artistry in Deathly Hallows, the short course is all the parallels between Rime of the Ancient Mariner and Harry Potter: a seven-part chiastic work, the eye symbolism and redemption via a transformed vision, the embedded story, the Christian content, and the genre melange and inversion.\n\nI’ve been reading about Coleridge, consequently, for my PhD thesis research and am enjoying very much Malcom Guite’s Mariner: A Voyage with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, a book I recommend to serious readers without reservation; it’s a joy to read and an edifying challenge. In it yesterday I stumbled on a reference to one of Coleridge’s better friends, John Cruickshank, whom Wordsworth claimed had a dream about “a skeleton ship with figures in it” which image STC lifted for Rime’s chilling scene of the dice game between Death and LIFE-IN-DEATH.\n\nI suggested in Harry Potter’s Bookshelf that Hermione’s cat was named as a hat tip to Dickens’ illustrator and noted satiric cartoonist George Cruikshank. As fun as that connection was, I much prefer the Coleridge possibility if only because there are so few hints of a Coleridge-Rowling connection explicitly made in the books. Oxford’s Beatrice Groves in Literary Allusion in Harry Potter found one in ‘Porlocks,’ a harmless magical creature referenced in Phoenix and Fantastic Beasts the textbook, which is pointer to the “person from Porlock” who interrupted STC’s frenetic composition of Kubla Khan (p xiv).\n\nWhat does Rowling say about the inspiration for Crookshanks? From ‘The Harry Potter Lexicon’ Crookshanks page:\n\nWhen I was working in London in the late 1980s I used to eat my lunch in a nearby square on sunny days and a large, fluffy ginger cat that looked as though it had run face-first into a wall used to prowl around the sunbathers there; I assume it lived in a nearby house. I didn’t ever get close enough to give myself an asthma attack, but I became distantly fond of this cat, which prowled among the humans around it looking disdainful and refusing to be stroked. When I decided to give Hermione an unusually intelligent cat I gave him the appearance of this haughty animal, with the slightly unfair addition of bandy legs.\n\nHence the ‘crook shanks’ joke. I’m guessing hopefully that it was also a pointer to one of Coleridge’s friends and inspirations for Rime. Hermione’s pet has remarkable vision, for one thing, an eye for the evil in deceptive appearances, and while this works for the satirical cartoonist, it also matches up with the meaning and moral of Mariner. Let me know what you think."
