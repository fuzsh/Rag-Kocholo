Routledge & Kegan Paul the publishers, and to Professor Kathleen Coburn the Editor, of Inquiring Spirit (1951) for allowing me a lengthy quotation from her Introduction to that valuable anthology of Coleridge’s prose; also to the same publishers, and to the author Professor David Bohm, for permission to quote from Causality and Chance in Modern Physics (1957). It is with the permission of the Clarendon Press that I have included in one of\n\nmy notes a passage from Professor Thomas McFarland’s Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (1969). 1 am further indebted to A. H. B. Coleridge Esq. and to Victoria College, Toronto, for kindly allowing\n\nme to transcribe and reproduce two hitherto unpublished MS notes in the possession of the College. Dr. Frances Yates, of the Warburg Institute, London, not only found time to reply at some length to two enquiries I addressed to her concerning Giordano Bruno, but has also been kind enough to allow me to quote a passage from one of her letters in a note to the Appendix. Courtesy and copyright apart, the debts of gratitude I owe are too plentiful for me to attempt their enumeration. There are for instance those labours of love, the careful editions we already possess of the greater part of Coleridge’s letters and his notebooks, and now also (since this book was begun) of the Friend as the first fruits of the\n\nCollected Coleridge. Something of what I have gained from others who have written on Coleridge must appear, I think, from the text and notes which follow, where I have endeavoured to supply full details of any book or article referred to. But it would be a mistake to infer that those referred to are the only, or even necessarily the most valuable, of all those I have had the benefit of reading. Selection from such a point of view would be quite impossible, nor would it then be accurate or justifiable to limit myself to those who have actually written about\n\nXii\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE THOUGHT\n\nColeridge. Indeed, if my own experience is any guide, the greatest helps of all towards divining what Coleridge thought are to be had from other thinkers, not a few of whom died before he was born.\n\nMoreover, acknowledgments based on their value to myself or my book could not be limited even to writers, let alone to writers about\n\nColeridge. Friends both old and new and the interest they have taken in my other books and in the progress of this one; acquaintances I have only conversed with; some of the students I have latterly had the privilege of teaching in the U.S.A.; I should soon be betrayed into a sincere, but perhaps rather priggish, acknowledgment to my fellow human beings in general for all, such as it is, that I am and know.\n\nAgoraphobia must not however prevent me from expressly mentioning Professor Craig W. Miller of the University of British Columbia, whose hospitality I once enjoyed there, with whom I have had the benefit of correspondence extending at intervals over a number of years, and to whose own work on Coleridge up to date I have taken occasion to refer. Professor Gian N. G. Orsini of the University of Wisconsin was so generous as to send me a copy of his Coleridge and German Idealism (1969), which reached me, to my regret, only after this book was already completed. For help in the arduous business of proofreading and indexing respectively, I thank my two friends John Griffiths and Walter Hooper, who most willingly bestowed on it not only their time and trouble but also the benefit of much previous\n\nexperience. There is one still more personal acknowledgment, which I should dearly like to express if I can safely do so without appearing to claim\n\nfor this interpretation of STC the cachet of the truly illustrious editor of his Philosophical Lectures and his Notebooks and general editor of the Collected Coleridge. Any such claim would be quite false, and it is with no such intention that I record the sense of inner support I have been deriving for some years now from a sort of warm west wind of benevolent interest blowing gently but steadily across the Atlantic and just occasionally freshening into an actual meeting in the neighbourhood of the British Museum; or that I identify the source from which it came as the lady to whom my book is dedicated.\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nIntroduction ol hemswas a period following his death in 1834, during which more attention was paid to Coleridge as a thinker than to Coleridge as a poet and critic. This was the time of which an observer who weighed his words as carefully as John Stuart Mill could write: “Bentham excepted, no Englishman of recent date has left his impress so deeply on the opinions and mental tendencies of those among us who attempt to enlighten their practice by philosophical meditation.” It was followed by a much longer period of almost exclusive interest in the poet and critic. In the last few decades, beginning perhaps with the publication in 1930 of J. M. Muirhead’s Coleridge as Philosopher, the pendulum has on the whole been swinging back again. Prose works long out of print are again becoming available; unpublished prose is being published. A full edition both of the Letters and the Notebooks is gradually coming from the press; the Collected Coleridge, under the general editorship of Kathleen Coburn, gave birth to the first two of its sixteen projected volumes while this book was being written; there has been a steadily\n\nincreasing flow of books and articles on what Coleridge thought about other things as well as literature and the drama. I do not know how many people will have read all these books and all these articles, which of course differ widely from each other. I certainly cannot claim to have done so. But I have read a good many, and if I were asked whether, in spite of their generous variety, and in addition to the high quality of the scholarship many of them display, there are any leading characteristics common to practically all of them, my answer would be: Yes, there are two—the predominance firstly of what I would call the biographical/comparative approach and secondly of the biographical/psychological approach; and I should hope that the terms I was using were reasonably self-explanatory. One good reason for this—though not, I think, the only one—is that the best known of\n\n4\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nColeridge’s prose works is his Biographia Literaria. It is indeed the only one, apart from the Lectures on Shakespeare, that is at all widely known; and it is the only one that has even remained in print uninterruptedly since it first appeared. It has much to say about the various philosophies with which he came into intellectual contact during his life; so much so that Biographia Philosophica would have been an equally, if not more, accurate title. From Coleridge himself, then, we first learn of his philosophy through his biography, and we first learn\n\nof its relation to other philosophies to the accompaniment of an historical, and sometimes anecdotal, account of his personal encounters with them. But whatever the reason, the comparative approach has its disadvantages. A student, for instance, who picks up a contemporary book on Coleridge, in order to find out what he thought about things, is likely to find himself involved in a complex and allusive web of comparative philosophy, which is certainly not, to begin with, what he needs. But that is not all. There are inherent disadvantages in the comparative approach not only for the readers of such a book, but for its writer also. It keeps him too much outside the intellectual content with which he is dealing. J. A. Appleyard, who has employed the biographical/comparative approach so instructively and so well in his Coleridge’s Philosophy of Literature, came to feel, in doing so, that a different approach altogether was also needed. For he wrote in his Introduction: What is wanting in the sizable bibliography of literature on Coleridge is a full-scale study of the development of his philosophy which will consider him on his own terms and not as a representative of something else, whether it be German idealism, English Platonism, pantheistic mysticism, semantic analysis, or depth psychology. The idea or organizing insight ought to be internal to his thought, so as to see what that thought is and not merely what it is like or unlike.\n\nWhen, in 1966, I first came upon these words, I had already begun assembling the material for the present volume. They at once struck me— indeed they rather leaped from the page—as a fair description of what I myself should actually be trying to do. And I venture to quote them as the best and shortest statement I can imagine of the general aim of the book, some such statement being perhaps required to justify its rather unusual form. It may serve for instance to explain why in Chapter 1 the reader is plunged so unceremoniously into philosophy, while the more\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nfamiliar territory of Coleridge on imagination is not reached until Chapter 6. Professor Appleyard, it is true, supposes a study of the “development” of Coleridge’s philosophy and in that respect I cannot claim to be even trying to meet his requirements. That he did develop it during his life is of course not in doubt and he said so himself in his Table Talk. Moreover the nature of this development and the extent to which it involved substantial changes are disputed questions which have received a good deal of attention. I have not made it my concern, nor stressed (though I have occasionally indicated) the dates of the quotations I have used. My own opinion is that the development was so consistent or, if it is preferred, “organic,” that later views are for the most part implicit in the earlier. They are at all events not contrary, so that what is explicitly stated in, say, 1830, may (to borrow a neat phrase from Professor J. R. de J. Jackson) be “relevant as a foreseen conclusion” to a passage from 1816 or earlier. This is in fact my opinion, but I do not assume that the reader will necessarily agree with it. If not, perhaps instead of laying down the book in disgust at this point, he will mentally substitute for the title it bears some such alternative title as: “What Coleridge Thought towards the End of his Life.” That there was a unity in this; that in his own mind his “system” was indeed a coherent system and not a hodge podge of “inspired fragments”; that he had a muddled life, but not a muddled mind-—all this\n\nis by now widely, though not universally, accepted: “. . . fragmentary, ‘atomic’ as Thelwall calls it, is just what Coleridge’s thought is not,” wrote Kathleen Coburn in her Introduction to the Philosophical Lectures, and other contemporaries could be quoted to the same effect. The fact remains of course that, although the reverse of fragmentary in his own mind, its elaboration is fragmentary on paper. The Letters, the Notebooks and the Marginalia are of inestimable value. But, if my own experience is any guide, they are not indispensable for an understanding of the system or philosophy itself. For it happens that my own study of Coleridge’s prose, conducted unsystematically and at intervals over a long period of years, was limited to the five published works, Biographia Literaria, the Friend, the Statesman’s Manual (with the Theory of Life scheduled to it), Aids to Reflection and Church and State, together with some part of the Treatise on Logic, which, though hitherto unpublished, is far from being a fragment. It was only much later that I began on the ‘fragments’; and it will be seen that I have made a fairly exten-\n\n6\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nsive use of them for the purpose of exposition. Here, if not indispensable, they are to say the least of it welcome. The condensed argument of, for instance, much of Chapter XII of the Biographia Literaria is made easiest to understand by seeing it expanded, exemplified, applied in one direction and another and, where Coleridge himself has done this,\n\nit is his voice we want to hear and not his exponent’s. For one thing he is likely to have done it better. Another issue that has been frequently, and sometimes hotly, debated in connection with Coleridge’s thought is the old charge of plagiarism, which began during his lifetime and was answered by Coleridge himself on more than one occasion. Here too, although it still forms the staple of many specialised articles, the general opinion has been moving against it. Since I have largely ignored the issue in what follows, I venture a few observations here. Verbal plagiarism, as a labour-saving breach of the law of copyright, is a matter of determinable fact, and\n\nthere is not much doubt that, as the law now stands, Schelling could have sued Coleridge in respect of one or two pages in the Biographia Literaria. Psychological plagiarism, or “borrowing,” on the other hand, depends on a number of imponderables such as the way a man reads, the way he thinks and, in the last resort, on your view of the nature of mind.\n\nColeridge himself in a letter of 1811 divided human heads into two types, the tanks and the springs. It is only the tanks who may be accurately said to borrow the thoughts, together or not with the words, of others. The spring adopts them. To quote Miss Coburn’s admirable Introduction once more, Coleridge “borrows only when his own thinking has reached almost the same point as his creditor’s.” He remarks in another letter that he “read for truth, and not to make a book,” and it is\n\nreally obvious that in saying so he was speaking the truth. He was not interested in “originality,” if the word is taken to mean novelty. For the principles advanced in his Essays on Method he claimed “no other\n\nmerit, than that of having drawn them from the purest sources of Philosophy, ancient and modern.” He would whole-heartedly have accepted James Russell Lowell’s definition in his essay on Thoreau: “Originality consists in the power of digesting and assimilating thoughts, so that they become part of our life and substance.” If, as I hope, the thought here attributed to Coleridge is in the main that which had become part of his life and substance, the issue of borrowing is irrelevant. And in this connection it is significant that, in order to preserve it as a reproach, he has to be accused, as he not infre-\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nquently is, of confused and inconsistent borrowings. Such accusations assume in advance that he was a tank and not a spring; for a spring must continue to give in the act of receiving. “Rarely,” and I again venture to quote Appleyard, “was he much concerned with the precise and actual meaning an idea had for another writer; almost always it was its interaction with his own thinking that mattered most to him.” The word interaction is important. The ground is cut from beneath a good deal of what has been written about Coleridge and Kant for instance by a simple observation of Professor McFarland’s in his Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition: “Kant provided Coleridge with instruments, not with a philosophical orientation.” That did not prevent him from revering Kant as “a very very great man.” There is a right as well as a wrong use of the comparative approach or method. The tragedy of the wrong one—which Carlyle once dis, paraged as “view-hunting”—and of its wide prevalence is that, without more, it actually hinders people from reading Coleridge in the only way he wanted to be read; which is a way more in accord with his own habit of reading—and “borrowing.” “What are my metaphysics?” he asks in the Friend—“merely the referring the mind to its own consciousness for truths indispensable to its own happiness.” He desired, as he says Plato desired, “to excite the germinal power that craves no knowledge but what it can take up into itself.” His object was not to indoctrinate; but neither was it to become one more appetising quarry for the viewhunter. It was to goad his readers into thinking for themselves. In the Friend and the Aids to Reflection “the aim of every sentence is to solicit, nay tease the reader to ask himself whether he actually does, or does not, understand distinctly.” Now this is exactly what a predominantly comparative, or biological/ comparative, approach prevents a reader from doing. Its learned debates have something in common with the waters of Lethe. To become immersed in them is to risk forgetting that one at least of the interesting questions about almost any thought is the question whether it is sound or unsound, valid or invalid, true or untrue. If I find it depressing when a distinguished literary critic complains that “Coleridge has little insight into the incompatibility of different trends of thought,” it is because this seems to me to betray a deplorable inability to distinguish between philosophy and talking about philosophy. Philosophy is, to my mind, not\n\nmuch concerned with “trends” of thought. It is concerned with thought. Is it seriously suggested that Coleridge was incapable of detecting the\n\n8\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE THOUGHT\n\nincompatibility of one thought with another? Or with proven fact? If so, let us first be shown the point or points at which this occurred. Time enough then to start investigating the confused borrowings, or the unconscious motivation, that seduced him to it.\n\nA fairly extended perusal of comment on Coleridge’s prose works reveals the existence of what I have come to call the “somehow” convention. According to the somehow convention, instead of burrowing into Coleridge’s thought to see what it looks like from inside, you stand beside it, equipped with three or four prefabricated frames or grids (for instance, subjective idealism, Neoplatonism, Christian Theology) and proceed to superimpose them one after another. You then read off from each grid in succession what it allows to appear and finally remark with surprise, or perhaps with a twinkle of amusement de haut en bas, that Coleridge “somehow” managed to keep them all going at the same time. This is apt to lead fairly quickly into the still more limiting superficialities of the biological/psychological approach, when “somehow” turns out to have meant his emotional needs or unconscious motivation\n\nor something of the sort. As an example of this, it is frequently affirmed in parenthesis, that Coleridge’s philosophy was really determined by his emotional need for the Christian faith. I say in parenthesis because, although it has for many years been constantly repeated, I have never seen it satisfactorily demonstrated. I myself have found virtually no evidence for it and I am now convinced that, from actual study of Coleridge’s philosophy, it is a conclusion impossible to reach without the help of a prescinding aversion from Christianity, or at the least from the Christian Church. Without that overriding persuasion it is not, even on its own personalist grounds, convincing. For after all what kind of a man was Coleridge? He was almost the discoverer of the unconscious mind and one who was constantly and penetratingly pondering his own. Moreover his cardinal sin was indolence, and his besetting weakness a pitiful dependence on the approbation of others and the affection of those around him. He was constitutionally dependent and he abhorred having to exert his will. But what kind of Christianity was it that he argued? Read the Theory of Life and, along with it, the Essay on Faith. It was a Christianity of energy, or, if it is preferred, of the energeia of the Pauline Epistles; a doctrine of the sovereign independence and initiative of the human spirit. Porphyrogeniti sumus, he proclaims: we are born in the purple; and his evolutionary theory of life culminates in the claim on behalf of man: “Henceforward, he is referred to himself,\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\ndelivered up to his own charge; and he who stands the most on himself, and stands the firmest, is the truest, because the most individual, Man.”\n\nIt is true that humility is also demanded of him. “The intensities must be at once opposite and equal. As the liberty, so must be the reverence for law. As the independence, so must be the service and submission to\n\nthe Supreme Will.” He is never to forget his coronation oath, but neither dare he abdicate and relax before Omnipotence operating ab extra. Life itself, when it has reached its apex in Man, is to say, with Racine’s\n\nEmperor Titus: Mais il ne s’agit plus de vivre, il faut regner.\n\nNow Coleridge had, if anything, Jess inclination for reigning in sovereign independence over either himself or others than Racine’s Titus. In the depths of his soul, if not in those ultimate depths of his spirit, which he conceived himself to share with mankind as a whole, he was all for\n\nlife with Berenice. He knew it, as he knew most things about himself. When he said in a letter that he had a “passion for Christianity,” he at once went on to admit, or bemoan, that it was “an intellectual passion”; and there is a more poignant admission to the same effect in the Notes on Leighton. A man who loathes getting up early and frequently fails to do so, may nevertheless be convinced that early-rising is the one indispensable virtue; and, if he is a writer, he may proclaim his conviction far and wide, meekly enduring the inevitable reproach of hypocrisy. But he is hardly likely to rig the evidence in order to become convinced in the first place. Would not the wishful-thinking recipe be not less, but a good deal more, available to us, if, instead of an intellectual\n\npassion for Christian energeia, Coleridge had succeeded in developing quite a different metaphysic—a “black” one for instance, to assure himself that because life has no meaning, it calls for no moral exertion? That, for what it may be worth, is my contribution to the corpus of\n\npersonalist interpretation. It is not important. Because, as far as Coleridge’s thought is concerned, the real objection to personalist exegesis\n\nis, not that it is liable to stop short at hasty conclusions and get stuck in them, but that it would be irrelevant even if it were profound. If a train of thought has been biassed and thus flawed by unconscious drives, it is the flaws that need pointing to first, not the drives. Are you telling me that the steering-column was out of order? I will join you in taking it to pieces after you have shown me the marks on the road, where the car\n\nIo\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nswerved because of it. Without some such prima facie evidence of aberration we should be wasting our time. And you have produced none. What is the relevance of Coleridge to our own\n\ntime, and what\n\nchance has the Collected Coleridge, as it progressively sees the light, of being read at all widely? The answer to the second question seems to me to depend on the ability and the willingness of the rising generation to distinguish between what is significant and what is merely trivial in their own immediate reaction to what is put before them. His style in general, the sometimes inordinate length of his sentences, for example, and his addiction to parenthesis, are decidedly repugnant to contemporary taste. Much will depend on whether the worship of contemporary taste simply because it is contemporary continues to prevail so strongly that it prevents people from accepting even the necessary discrepancies between his characteristic utterance and our own. Partly his style is expendable; he himself for instance commented on the way it had been influenced by his extensive reading in leisurely and prolix seventeenth century writers. Partly on the other hand, it is inextricable from the radical difference between the quality of his thought and that of nearly all his own contemporaries, let alone ours. Long sentences may sometimes be required to penetrate to the sap of a topic and flow with that into its exterior and delicate ramifications. Again it is arguable, and Coleridge himself argued, that only shallow thinking can dispense with parentheses in writing. But literary style is of course not the only impediment. There is an area that lies somewhere between style and personality, for which “attitude” is perhaps the only word. Here again there are elements in Coleridge’s that are distasteful to a good many of us. I will confine myself to the single example of his highly developed bump of reverence. It is difficult not to feel that he protests too much. With the assistance of his penchant for slipping easily into apostrophe, he too often obtrudes his reverence on us. He seems at such times to have forgotten that the twinbrother of reverence is reticence; and that is something we are not likely\n\nto forget today, as we watch them both disappearing hand in hand. Here again it is a question of ability to distinguish the expendable from the essential. The obtrusion is expendable, but the reverence itself is not; since reverence is not simply a virtue for which we may expect full marks in heaven, or a device for bolstering up the social establishment.\n\nIt is an organ of perception for a whole range of qualities that are as imperceptible without it as another whole range is imperceptible with-\n\nIntroduction\n\nII\n\nout an ear for music. And Coleridge’s aim, it must be remembered, was precisely to supplement the current metaphysic, and the current science, of quantities with a metaphysic and a science of qualities. ‘This brings me to the other question: that of his actual relevance to our time, whether it should be recognised or not. It is one on which it is better to leave the reader to make up his own mind than for me to argue it, Indeed the principal object of the book is to assist him in doing so. I have however occasionally commented in detail from that point of view, mainly in the Notes, And Chapter 11 considers at sore length the relevance of Coleridge’s thought to one particular aspect of modern life, a very important one, namely natural science and physics in particular. Beyond that—he was so seminal a thinker that his insights and apergus tend to “sprout in the brains” with a fertility that is positively dangerous. | have generally resisted the temptation to detect exciting links with up-to-date, and perhaps ephemeral, developments such as generative grammar, structuralism and so forth. At one point even Godel’s theo-\n\nrem (which I understand to be an undermining critique of all “closed systems” of thought) beckoned to me for mention in connection with Coleridge on the understanding, but I resolutely looked the other way. So too with another exciting link. | mean that vast and unwieldy body of speculation concerning the unconscious mind, betokening (as I feel) the shadowy appearance there during the last few decades—at the opposite pole from the physical world, where their appearance has been far from shadowy—of those “lost Dynameis,” those conflicting but productively conflicting forces, on which Coleridge’s entire system was based. I feel the Jungians, the Yin and Yang votaries and others will easily perceive the link for themselves. And I believe this will also be the case, only more so, with the small but growing number who have come to acknowledge the pre-erninence of Rudolf Steiner, to whom however I have expressly referred in a note to Chapter 11 and again in Chapter'r3, It will become apparent to anyone who has the patience to reach the end of this book that I find the relevance of Coleridge’s thought to our time where he himself located its relevance to his own.\n\nIt resides,\n\nabove all else, in his radical critique of one or two major presuppositions, upon which the immediate thinking, and as a result the whole cultural and social structure of this “epoch of the understanding and the senses” (including supposedly radical revolts against it) is so firmly—or is it now infirmly?—established. As long as this is ignored,\n\nI2\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nI doubt if he has much to say to us, whether as a philosopher or as a sociologist. It is partly for that reason, but partly also because my book is\n\nalready, if anything, too long for its main purpose, that I have touched on his political theory only very briefly in the latter part of the last chapter. I notice that David Calleo found it necessary to include an early chapter on “The Philosophical Underpinnings” in his excellent book on Coleridge and the Idea of the Modern State; and I feel sure that that chapter is the golden bridge on the crossing whereof by his readers the persuasiveness of the rest depends. If then I should have made it a little easier for any puzzled mind to cross that bridge, I may perhaps claim\n\nto have done something at least for Coleridge’s contribution to sociology. A final word is needed concerning the Appendix on “polar logic.” I have been suggesting that there is something to be said for the practice of ascertaining what Coleridge thought before beginning to discuss when, or why, or in what company he thought it. This means that, while we are still examining the what, it is better to withdraw our attention from the why and the when and the with whom; and that is the general principle I have sought to follow. In the book itself references to other philosophers are made either because Coleridge himself expressly referred to them, or because they seemed to help in elucidating Coleridge’s own meaning, or occasionally in order to remove a current misconception. But this restraint was not occasioned by lack of interest. On the contrary the relation of his philos-\n\nophy to others like and unlike it, and to historical trends of thought—in short, the comparative approach—is a matter that I have found of absorbing interest. Very much here, as I have already said, has been done by others; and I am deeply indebted to more than one of them: but a remark of Coleridge’s in the Biographia Literaria concerning his indebtedness to “the polar logic of Giordano Bruno” does not seem to have attracted the attention it deserved. I have therefore attempted to investigate its significance, confining my view-hunting and source-hunting to an Appendix, which I offer as my own small and very imperfect contribution to the study of Coleridge’s philosophy by the comparative method.\n\n25 [ >\n\nThoughts and Thinking O, THE 17th of March 1801 Coleridge’s eldest son, Hartley, then between four and five years old, was looking out of the study window at some mountains. Coleridge picked up a mirror. “I showed him,” he records in a notebook,\n\nthe whole magnificent Prospect in a Looking Glass, and held it up, so that the whole was like a Canopy or Ceiling over his head, and he struggled to express himself concerning the Difference between the Thing and the Image almost with convulsive Effort—I never before saw such an Abstract of Thinking as a pure act and energy, of Thinking as distinguished from Thoughts.\n\nIt is a good point at which to make our entry into Coleridge’s own thoughts, that is to say into the whole coherently conceived, though fragmentarily expounded, structure which he sometimes referred to as his “system,” at other times as the Dynamic Philosophy, and occasion-\n\nally as the Constructive Philosophy. Coleridge himself was twenty-eight at this time. Decades later Thomas Carlyle was to despise and describe the old man at Highgate still expatiating on the relation between “subject” and “object” (which, owing to a catarrhal affliction, he pronounced “sum-m-mject” and “om-m-mject”); and those few who have really endeavoured to master his philosophy are likely to have concluded that a grasp of this relation, as Coleridge saw it, is the pons asinorum of the whole endeavour. In fact, however, if the definitions of subject and object, and the true nature of the relation between them, are the pons asinorum, the concept, and perhaps the experience, of thinking as an act, or as an ‘act and energy,’ are the toll-gate in the middle of the bridge, the barrier that has to be opened before we can get across.\n\n14\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nMost of my readers will have observed a small-water-insect on the surface of rivulets, which throws a cinque-spotted shadow fringed with prismatic colours on the sunny bottom of the brook; and will have noticed, how the little animal wins its way up against the stream . . . This is no unapt emblem of the mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking.”\n\nWe must however distinguish between energy and effort. Both Hartley Coleridge and the water-insect give evidence a struggle. But this is not necessarily the case. In a 1803 Coleridge observes: “In all inevitable Truths, sides of a triangle are greater than the third, I feel my\n\nof something like notebook entry of e.g. that the two will active: I seem\n\nto will the Truth, as well as to perceive it. Think of this.” *\n\nColeridge did not always obey the commands he laid on himself in his notebooks, but in this instance he clearly did so. One could almost say that he hardly ever ceased thinking of it; or certainly that it was always at the back of his mind and of almost any doctrine he was propounding at the moment. There is evidence enough in his prose-writ-\n\nings throughout his life;* and, towards the end of it, in a work which was to have formed part of the “Magnum Opus” that he frequently referred to but never achieved, he advises the reader that the only way of\n\novercoming a certain difficulty (to which we shall refer again shortly) is: . . . by placing yourself in such situations or as it were positions of mind as would be likely to call up that act in our intellectual being and then to attend to it so far as its necessary transient and subtle nature will permit . . . When connecting 2 bright stars, the one directly above the other as the extremities of the same line I seemed to have a something between a sense and a sensation of length more perfect than any actual filling up of the interval by a succession of points in contact would have given me. I seemed to find myself acting as it were in the construction of that length undisturbed by any accompanying perception of breadth or inequality which must needs accompany all pictures of a line . . . in other words it was a self-conscious act snatched away as it were from the product of that act.*\n\nWe have here an act which is normally performed unconsciously, though the result or product of the act is part of “the spontaneous consciousness natural to all reflecting beings.” ° * See for instance Philosophical Lectures, p. 115 (“To comprehend the philosophy of Pythagoras, the mind itself must be conceived of as an act”); p. 333; and elsewhere.\n\nThoughts and Thinking\n\n15\n\nThis is perhaps easiest to grasp in the case of geometry: “I need not I am sure tell you that a line upon a slate is but a picture of that act of the imagination which the mathematician alone consults.” ® Mathematical lines, points and surfaces are “acts of the imagination that are one with the product of those acts.” * And this remains true of the figures constructed with them. A geometrician draws three meeting lines on a slate; but the ‘triangle’ which he then sees merely represents to him (and imperfectly) an ideal figure he has first had to produce by an act of thought or (it is practically the same thing) an act of imagina-\n\ntion. [the] spirit in man (that is, the will) shows its own state in and by its acts alone: even as in geometrical reasoning the mind knows its constructive faculty in the act of constructing, and contemplates the act in the product (that is, the mental figure or diagram) which is inseparable from the act and co-instantaneous.®\n\nBoth the act and the product of the act (“the mental figure or diagram”) are already there before the pencil has touched the slate. They are inseparable from one another or normally so, but that does not entail that they are indistinguishable. Indeed it is precisely as we do begin to distinguish them that we come at “the mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking.” Coleridge was perfectly clear about this distinction in his own mind. But he had the utmost difficulty in getting it across to his contemporaries—a generation, we should recall, which had not been familiarized by Freud and his followers with at least the notion of at least the possibility of there being such a thing as unconscious mental activity. In the following quotation we ought not to let ourselves be put off by Coleridge’s use of the word transcendental. What he designated as transcendental philosophy is what we should be more likely today to call epistemology. It was no wise mystical. It was reasoning about thinking. There is a philosophic (and inasmuch as it is actualized by an effort of freedom, an artificial) consciousness, which lies beneath or (as it were) behind the spontaneous consciousness natural to all reflecting beings. As the elder Romans distinguished their northern provinces into Cis-Alpine and Trans-Alpine, so may we divide all the objects of human knowledge into those on this side, and those on the other side of the spontaneous consciousness; citra et trans conscientiam communem.\n\nThe latter is ex-\n\n16\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nclusively the domain of pure philosophy, which is therefore properly entitled transcendental, in order to discriminate it at once, both from\n\nmere reflection and re-presentation, on from those flights of lawless speculation consciousness, because transgressing the tellectual faculties, are justly condemned\n\nthe one hand, and on the other which, abandoned by all distinct bounds and purposes of our inas transcendent.’\n\nBut, though it is not mysticism, to reason about thinking does entail our being led inward from the product of thinking to the act itself. And this does require a certain discipline. Here is the root-cause of the charge of ‘obscurity,’ which was levelled during his life, and has so often been levelled since his death, against both Coleridge himself and his philosophy. A system, the first principle of which it is to render the mind intuitive of the spiritual in man (i.e. of that which lies on the other side of our natural consciousness) must needs have a great obscurity for those, who have never disciplined and strengthened this ulterior consciousness.’\n\nIt will have been noticed that, in the passages cited, the expressions “act of thinking” and “act of imagination” are treated as equivalent. This will call for further consideration later; but meanwhile it may help\n\nto prevent the mistake we might otherwise make of assuming that by the act of thinking all he means is ‘attending,’ The difference between these two goes very deep and cannot really be grasped, as Coleridge apprehended it, without reference to his fundamental and well-known (though not often well-understood) distinction between Reason and Understanding. This, too, must await a later chap-\n\nter. Meanwhile it may be observed that the difference between attending and thinking is perhaps most readily experienced in situations where the object of attention is itself a train of thought, and one which is being presented by another mind. We listen, let us say, to a lecture which is full of thought and deeply interesting, and which holds our attention from start to finish. A day or two later someone who was not there asks us: “What was the lecture like?” “Very good indeed!” “What did he say?” Whereupon we find ourselves completely at a loss; we just cannot answer, though we can recall plenty of disconnected observations. So it is not our memory which is at fault. On another occasion, after the lecture is concluded, we summon up\n\nthe energy to ‘go through’ it in our own minds, reproducing for ourselves\n\nThoughts and Thinking\n\n17\n\nthe main and subsidiary threads of the discourse. And this time, if we are asked the same question, we can answer it pretty satisfactorily. Or it may be a chapter from a book. By thought I here mean the voluntary production in our own minds of those states of consciousness, to which, as to his fundamental facts, the\n\nWriter has referred us: while attention has for its object the order and connection of thoughts and images, each of which is in itself already and familiarly known.!”\n\nElsewhere he speaks of the effort of attention and the energy of thought.* Attention, in spite of the effort it requires, is intellectually passive. “On whatever subject the mind feels a lively interest, attention, though always an effort, becomes a delightful effort.” 4* But though the two motions of the mind must be carefully distinguished, they are also closely related—as is the case with understanding and reason. The lower is the only way to the higher and attention is “a habit or discipline without which the very word, thinking, must remain a thoughtless substitute for dreaming with our eyes open . . .”® Coleridge once wrote in his notebook: “4 Thought and Thoughts are quite different words from Thought—as a Fancy from Fancy, a Work from Work, a Life from Life, a Force and Forces from Force, a\n\nFeeling, a Writing, etc.”*® What he is pointing out is that, just as “a” work, which is a thing, is the finished product of ‘work,’ which is\n\nan act, so is “a” thought the product of the act of thought. When they are used in the singular and without the article before them, all these words are in effect participial, so that to use the term thinking (instead of thought) for the act makes the distinction clearer. Hitherto we have been concerned mainly with the act of thinking as he experienced and reflected on it. It remains to consider (observing his own verbal distinction) what Coleridge understood by ‘a thought’ or ‘thoughts.’ It will be recalled that the act of thinking is normally performed unconsciously. By contrast, thoughts can be defined as all the content of consciousness in so far as that is not sense or feeling. It covers memories,\n\nspeculations, fancies, theories, reverie and all else that goes on while we remain conscious. But not those alone. It is a truism today, though it was not in Coleridge’s, that a great part, if not the whole, of what for practical purposes we classify as ‘perception’ includes a thought-com-\n\nponent. The ‘koenaesthesis,’ as it is sometimes called, which constitutes\n\n18\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nour experience of a common world external to and independent of ourselves, is derived from that component. Nature itself, so far as it has\n\nform and quality, is a compound of thoughts and perceptions.”* The difficulty here, as in the case of the act of thinking and its product, is that in ordinary life we never consciously experience the one\n\nseparately from the other. We ‘perceive,’ as we say, an ‘object,’ but the object is already ‘nature’ in the above mentioned sense, that is to say, a construct owing, not to our senses but to our minds its total form, and thus its unity, and thus its presence as an object. A single percept, uncombined, unmodified and unadopted by any element of mental construction, is as much outside our normal experience as is pure thinking, uncombined with any element of representation borrowed from the senses. Yet this does not alter the fact that thinking and perceiving are two clearly distinguishable functions, the one active and the other passive. Indeed that is part of what the words mean. Whatever his views on the subject of free will and determinism, it remains true for everyman that\n\nthinking is self-originated in a way that perceiving is not. Thinking is, by contrast, something which (however unconsciously) he does; perceiving is, by contrast, something which he suffers. Put that way, the point may perhaps seem so obvious as to be scarcely worth making. But there was in Coleridge’s day a strong current of philosophical and scientific thought which was founded on the denial of precisely this distinction. There was for example the philosophy of Hume and there was the associationist psychology of David Hartley, which had played so great a part in Coleridge’s own intellectual development.\"* In our own day we are familiar enough with the behaviourist upholders of the same tradition. This refusal to distinguish between thinking and perceiving, and thus between the mind and the senses, was (so Coleridge divined) based on the fact, to which attention has\n\njust been drawn, that the two are in practice found to be inseparable. And it is for this reason that we so frequently find him turning aside from a particular topic he is pursuing to expose on general grounds the fallacy implicit in the assumption that we cannot ‘really’ distinguish components we cannot divide. The assumption is as strange as it is persistent. Water can be really separated into drops—but each drop is no less really composed of hydrogen and oxygen, in spite of the fact that we cannot, as long as it remains\n\nwater, separate the one from the other. Coleridge attributed the pre-\n\nThoughts and Thinking\n\n19\n\nvalence of this mental blind spot to what he sometimes referred to as “the despotism of the eye.” But we will pursue our present policy of letting him speak for himself: In order to obtain adequate notions of any truth, we must intellectually separate its distinguishable parts; and this is the technical process of philosophy. But having done so, we must then restore them in our conceptions to the unity in which they actually co-exist; and this is the result of philosophy.}® Again: It is a dull and obtuse mind, that must divide in order to distinguish; but it is a still worse, that distinguishes in order to divide.”\n\nThe second (“still worse”) type of mind is evidently not worse by being still more dull and obtuse, but rather the opposite; for it is the type of mind which possesses ‘keenness’ without subtlety: Few men of genius are keen; but almost every man of genius is subtle. If you ask me the difference between keenness and subtlety, I answer that it is the difference between a point and an edge. To split a hair is no proof of subtlety; for subtlety acts in distinguishing differences—in showing that two things apparently one are in fact two; whereas to split a hair is to cause division, and not to ascertain a difference.”1\n\nDistinct notions do not suppose different things. When I make a threefold distinction in human nature, I am fully aware that it is a distinction, not a division, and that in every act of mind the man unites the properties of sense, understanding and reason. Nevertheless it is of great practical importance, that these distinctions should be made and understood, the ignorance or perversion of them being alike injurious . . .?”\n\nNow let us hear him on the psychological source of this still very prevalent assumption that we cannot distinguish except where we can divide;2) or that, > if we do so, 2 the distinction is ‘unreal. Under that despotism of the eye (the emancipation from which Pythagoras by his numeral, and Plato by his musical symbols, and both by geometric discipline, aimed at, as the first propaideutikon of the mind) —under this strong sensuous influence, we are restless because invisible\n\nWHAT\n\n20\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nthings are not the objects of vision; and metaphysical systems, for the most part, become popular, not for their truth, but in proportion as they attribute to causes a susceptibility of being seen, if only our visual organs were sufficiently powerful.?8\n\n. . . Locke told us, in defining words, we ought to have distinct images or conceptions . . .?4 Now it is clear that the materialist excludes all facts that are not immediately the objects of his senses. By his very hypothesis he cannot have a theory, for he determines first of all rather to place effect for cause than to concede any one thing which his reason dictates if his senses do not at the same time give him a picture of it.?® Thus, as materialism has generally been taught, it is utterly unintelligible, and owes all its proselytes to the propensity so common among men, to mistake distinct images for clear conceptions; and vice versa, to\n\nreject as inconceivable whatever from its own nature is unimaginable. But as soon as it becomes intelligible, it ceases to be materialism.?®\n\n. . . this difficulty* . . . arises wholly out of That Slavery of the Mind to the Eye and the visual Imagination or Fancy under the influence of which the Reasoner must have a picture and mistakes surface for sub-\n\nstance.??\n\nThere is an interesting corollary to the above quotations, and particularly perhaps to the first two of them. Coleridge rarely let slip an opportunity of emphasising “the great advantages to be obtained from\n\nthe habit of tracing the proper meaning and history of words”; and we find him towards the end of his life vigorously recommending this discipline as a means towards liberating mind from sense. Perhaps, in a history-conscious age it is a likelier one than those formerly adopted by Pythagoras and Plato. In disciplining the mind one of the first rules should be, to lose no opportunity of tracing words to their origin; one good consequence of which will be, that he will be able to use the language of sight without being enslaved by its affections. He will at least save himself from the delusive notion, that what is not imageable is likewise not conceivable. * The reference is to Milton’s over the notion of creation out of ‘nothing,’ which led him to “assert the eternity of Matter to escape from it.”\n\nThoughts and Thinking\n\n21\n\nTo emancipate the mind from the despotism of the eye is the first step towards its emancipation from the influences and intrusions of the senses, sensations and passions generally. Thus most effectively is the power of abstraction to be called forth, strengthened and familiarized, and it is\n\nthis power of abstraction that chiefly distinguishes the human understanding from that of the higher animals—and in the different degrees in which this power is developed, the superiority of man over man largely\n\nconsists, Hence we are to account for the preference which the divine Plato gives to expressions taken from objects of the ear, as terms of Music and Harmony, and in part at least for the numerical symbols, in which Pythagoras clothed his philosophy.?8\n\nTinted glasses make the clearest blue sky look leaden and overcast. Coleridge will continue to be called ‘cloudy’ even by his admirers, because he will continue to be misinterpreted by readers who are not willing to grasp, and to remember once they have grasped, the elementary principles which consciously permeate almost every other sentence he constructs, and which it is hoped the foregoing quotations sufficiently illustrate. These are: first, that thinking is an act. Secondly, that it is\n\nnormally, though not necessarily and always, an unconscious act. Thirdly, that though we are not normally conscious of the act, we are normally conscious of the product of the act (which we call ‘thoughts’), and indeed it is this, which actually constitutes our self-consciousness as human beings. It must not be thought, because a number of the quotations selected instance occasions when the act itself did become conscious—‘“snatched away as it were from the product” *—that Coleridge rested the validity of his system on abnormal experience. He held that the peculiar relation between act and product is implicit in the very concept of thought or mind;”® and that this can be demonstrated by analysis. Indeed he spent a large part of his energies in seeking to demonstrate precisely this, by every means in his power and at every opportunity that offered itself. * See p. 14, above.\n\n252 b>\n\nNaturata and Naturans In nature nothing remains constant. Everything is in a perpetual state of transformation, motion and change. However, we discover that nothing simply surges up out of nothing without having antecedents that existed before. I believe nothing ever disappears without a trace, in the sense that it gives rise to absolutely nothing existing at later times. This general characteristic of the world can be expressed in terms of a principle which summarises an enormous domain of different kinds of experience and which has never yet been contradicted in any observation or experiment, scientific or otherwise; namely, everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things. This principle is not yet a statement of the existence of causality in nature. Indeed, it is even more fundamental than is causality, for it\n\nis at the foundation of the possibility of our understanding nature in a rational way.\n\nDavid Bohm: Causality and Chance in Modern Physics; Chapter 1, Introduction.\n\nale is a concept of nature which Coleridge would have approved and accepted. Nature was, for him “the term in which we comprehend all things that are representable in the forms of time and space, and subjected to the relations of cause and effect: and the cause of the existence of which, therefore, is to be sought for perpetually in something antecedent.” * Characteristically, he adds that the word itself expresses this in the strongest manner possible: “Natura, that which is about to be born, that which is always becoming.” * Natura is of course the Latin rendering of Greek physis and, as Bohm begins by pointing out, it is this fundamental principle—the nature of Nature as a whole—with which the science of Physics is concerned.\n\nNaturata and Naturans\n\n23\n\nBut at this point the Coleridgean analysis takes a further step which differentiates his concept of nature sharply from that of most, if not all, modern physicists. To investigate scientifically the nature of Nature is to investigate the nature of phenomena as such. It is to ask the question:\n\nWhat is a phenomenon? True, “everything comes from other things and gives rise to other things.” Of any particular phenomenon we can say, tracing the chain of cause and effect: “this comes from such and such\n\nanother phenomenon or group of phenomena.” But if it is really the origin of phenomena as such that we are seeking to investigate, there must come a point where this answer will no longer serve: “the solution of phenomena can never be derived from phenomena.” * Thus, the question: What is a particle? can never be answered in terms of “the relation of unproductive particles to each other.” * Yet this is precisely the solution which the physical science of Coleridge’s day was looking for. We are not at the moment concerned with the question whether the same is true of the physics of our own day, but it may be remarked that the concept of the ‘field,’ supplementing that of the particle if not replacing it altogether, has no doubt done something towards emancipating modern physics from “the despotism of the eye.” ® The essence of the natural process is that it is ‘productive,’ in the wide sense of evolving phenomena from other phenomena,\" and Coleridge held it to be a logical absurdity to suppose that this productive power is the same kind of thing as the phenomena themselves. What then can be said, what can be ascertained about productive nature, as distinguished in thought from already produced (that is, phenomenal) nature? The proper answer to this question was one of the main concerns of Coleridge’s life, and we may begin by quoting his opinion of what it is not: —Aristotle’s definitions of nature are all grounded on the petty and rather rhetorical than philosophical antithesis of nature to art—a conception inadequate to the demands evem of his philosophy. Hence in the progress of his reasoning, he confounds the natura naturata (that is, the sum total of the facts and phenomena of the senses) with an hypothetical natura naturans, a Goddess Nature, that has no better claim to a place in any sober system of natural philosophy than the Goddess Mulutudo;8\n\nIt is not of course the mere concept of a natura naturans—a nature linguistically denotable only by adding a verb to the noun, a nature\n\n24\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\n‘naturing’—that Coleridge is objecting to here. On the contrary, it is one that he frequently uses himself: —in speaking of the world without us as distinguished from ourselves, the aggregate of phenomena ponderable and imponderable, is called nature in the passive sense,—in the language of the old schools, natura naturata—while the sum or aggregate of the powers inferred as the sufficient causes of the forms (which by Aristotle and his followers were called the substantial forms) is nature in the active sense, or natura naturans.°\n\nWhat he criticises is, firstly, Aristotle’s failure to distinguish clearly between natura naturans and natura naturata and, secondly, his attempt to remedy the defect by the hypothesis of a Goddess. We may speak of natura naturans and natura naturata; or we may say that, in addition to the phenomena, there are the so-called ‘laws’ of nature, without which it is impossible to understand the phenomena. The laws themselves are not phenomenal and we only become aware of them in their effects. But we have, all the same, to distinguish them\n\nfrom the phenomena themselves. They are not the less real because they are not things. Thus, the distinction between natura naturans and natura naturata\n\nreveals itself as resembling in quality that distinction between the act of thought and its product, which was discussed in the previous chapter— natura naturata being “the productive power suspended and, as it were,\n\nquenched in the product.” 7° It was the refusal of science to realise, or even consider, this principle that provoked Coleridge into such extreme pronouncements as we find, for instance, in the Statesman’s Manual, where he casually remarks that “we have not yet attained to a science of nature.” He held that a true system must be grounded neither in a thing nor an abstraction.2 And it is the inexorable presupposition in the minds of his readers, that whatever is not a thing must be an abstraction, which, more than perhaps\n\nanything else, has prevented his own system from being understood. In particular it has prevented them from even grasping, at the outset, what such a term as natura naturans signifies. For, once the author has made it clear that what he is talking about is not a thing, it is mentally docketed by 99.9 per cent of them as an abstraction. In fact, however,\n\nColeridge’s natura naturans is no more of an abstraction than, for instance, gravitation.\n\nNaturata and Naturans\n\n25\n\nNatura naturans is supersensuous, but not supernatural. It has nothing to do with those ‘occult qualities,’ whose final expulsion (or intended expulsion) from the domain of science was one of the major achieve-\n\nments of the scientific revolution. Coleridge emphasised this on more than one occasion.’* We shall see that, so far from reintroducing occult qualities, he considered his concept of spirit, as the antithesis or correlative to ‘nature,’ to be the only possible means of eliminating those occult qualities which in fact remain surreptitiously present in the vocabulary of science. There were not a few of them still left in Coleridge’s time, and there are still some today. Comte complained long ago that the admission of so-called ‘forces’ into that vocabulary (the “force of gravity” for instance) was a relic of primitive animism. An ‘occult quality’ is anything that is deemed to possess an exclusively objective existence, in spite of being imperceptible. This was the case with the hypothetical ‘ether’ to which so much speculative attention was directed during the earlier part of the time between Newton’s day and our own. But it is equally true of any other ‘plenum,’ or hypothetical space-filler, conceived in the phenomenal mode, in order to solve the old problem of action at a distance—a problem indeed (he held), if not an absurdity, to all men who presuppose ‘nature’ to mean the naturata alone, in artificial abstraction from the\n\ntotality which must include also the naturans. We will conclude this chapter with an extract from Coleridge’s notes\n\nwritten on his copy of the De Divisione Naturae of John Scotus Erigena: Such men, and their name is /egion—consequently demand a Matter as a Datum. As soon as this gross prejudice is cured by the appropriate discipline and the Mind is familiarised to the contemplation of Matter as a product in time, the resulting Phenomenon of the equilibrium of the two antagonist Forces, Attraction and Repulsion, that the Negative and\n\nthis the Positive Pole . . . the idea of Creation alone remains.'*\n\nIn the chapter that follows we shall find that we cannot direct our attention on these “two antagonist Forces” and enquire what Coleridge meant by them, without finding ourselves in territory with which the\n\naverage student of Coleridge’s prose is already familiar.\n\n25 2 be\n\nTwo Forces of One Power Ave from his poetry, the best-known work of Coleridge is the ‘Literary Life, or Biographia Literaria. It is really the only prose writing that is at all widely read today. Moreover, within the Biographia Literaria itself it is to one particular chapter that attention is mainly given. The critique of Wordsworth’s poetry which fills four chapters in the second part of the book is, it is true, highly valued by all who are at all deeply concerned with English literature and its history; but it is the famous, truncated Chapter XIII, at the end of Part I, which comes to\n\nmind first and foremost, when the Biographia Literaria is mentioned. This chapter has been praised, criticised, confuted, confirmed, argued from, argued against, expounded, blessed and cursed over and over again and almost without intermission since the day it was published . . or rather part of this chapter. Chapter XIII consists of three parts. First there are three pages of philosophical exposition following, without any appreciable break, on the long philosophical disquisition which constitutes Chapter XII. Then there is a row of asterisks, followed by a letter, printed in italics, which\n\nthe author says he had just received from a friend, whose practical judgment he has “ample reason to estimate and revere” and who had seen the part of the book already written. The letter begins: “You ask my opinion concerning your Chapter on The Imagination, both as to the impression it made on myself, and as to those which I think it will make on the Public . . .” It goes on to advise that the chapter, “which cannot, when it is printed, amount to so little as an hundred pages,” would be quite out of place in a literary biography, and recommends the author to reserve it for “your great book on the Constructive Philosophy, which you have promised and announced.” Even then it will be too revolutionary to be readily received. For both its opinions and its\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\nay)\n\nmethod of argument are “directly the reverse of all I had ever been accustomed to consider as truth . . .” The chapter then concludes with three short paragraphs stating, says Coleridge, “the main result of the Chapter which I have reserved for that future publication.” This ‘letter’ we now know! to have been composed by Coleridge himself. It is on the third part of the chapter, the three final paragraphs already referred to, that attention has been mainly concentrated. They contain (1) Coleridge’s distinction between the ‘primary’ and the ‘secondary’ Imagination, (2) his frequently quoted definition of the primary Imagination “as the living power and prime agent of all human perception, and as a repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I am,” (3) his dictum that the secondary Imagination “is essentially vztal, even as all objects (as objects) are essentially fixed and dead,” and (4) though this had already been adumbrated in Chapter IV, the famous distinction between Imagination and Fancy. So much for the content of the three paragraphs. Let us now tabulate what else we know about them. We know, firstly, that they form part of a chapter entitled “On the Imagination, or Esemplastic Power”; secondly, that Coleridge began writing this chapter with the thought that it might run to as many as a hundred pages; thirdly, that the three paragraphs* were substituted for what would have been at most a brief terminal summary of the conclusions (“the main result”) to be drawn from the contents of those hundred or so pages; fourthly, that Coleridge had in contemplation a great book on the Constructive Philosophy, which was likely to contain opinions and a method of argument not merely different from, but “directly the reverse” of all that his contem-\n\nporaries were accustomed to think. The great book on the Constructive Philosophy never appeared, though it was often mentioned.” It was certainly never finished; but equally certainly it was more than merely begun, and there are two substantial MS volumes in the British Museum, which were undoubt-\n\nedly intended to be the first part of itt Moreover it is apparent from other published works such as the Aids to Reflection, the Friend, the Philosophical Lectures, and the Theory of Life, and it has been becom* In effect there are only two, since the first merely describes the other two. + The Treatise on Logtc.\n\n28\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE THOUGHT\n\ning more and more apparent during the last few decades from MSS, letters, marginalia, notebook entries etc., that thesubstance of his projected Magnum Opus was fully available to Coleridge’s mind before he died, in the shape of a coherent and closely knit psychology, philosophy and cosmology.\n\nHow far it was already so available at the time when Chapter XIII was written and how far he continued to develop it afterwards is a matter which need not concern us. Apart from all this, there is Chapter XII of the Biographia Literaria itself, which, though it is difficult reading, is perfectly intelligible, and from which, even if taken by itself, the skeleton of the constructive, or\n\ndynamic, philosophy, and in particular the precise significance of the term primary imagination, can be constructed by a little serious application.\n\nDiscouraging perhaps; but one would have thought that anyone who felt at all deeply concerned with Coleridge’s views on imagination and who felt entitled to spread himself on the topic (Walter Pater for instance) would, if he could not bring himself to study Chapter XII, at least have taken the trouble to ponder the opening paragraphs of Chapter XIII as well as the three aphoristic paragraphs with which it closes. Yet, with a few honourable exceptions, these opening paragraphs have been completely ignored.\n\nLet us then see how Chapter XIII does begin—omitting the quotations from Milton, Leibnitz and Synesius which are placed at the head of it: Descartes, speaking as a naturalist, and in imitation of Archimedes, said, give me matter and motion and I will construct you the universe. We must of course understand him to have meant: I will render the construction of the universe intelligible. In the same sense the transcendental philosopher* says: grant me a nature having two contrary forces, the one of which tends to expand infinitely, while the other strives to apprehend or find itself in this infinity, and I will cause the world of intelligences with the whole system of their representations to rise up before you. Every other science presupposes intelligence as already existing and complete: the philosopher contemplates it in its growth, and as it were represents its history to the mind from its birth to its maturity? *See Chapter I, p. 15, above,\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\n29\n\nA cosmology, a philosophy, a psychology, which allows to imagination a ‘primary’ as well as a secondary role, must begin by recognizing two forces. These two forces will be its ultimate, unquestioned grounds in precisely the same way as matter and motion were the unquestioned\n\ngrounds of most of the philosophy and all the science of Coleridge’s contemporaries. They would appear therefore to be of some slight importance. Nevertheless the majority of those who up to now have sympathetically interpreted Coleridge to us, including some who have honestly sought to interpret him in depth—and have read very widely in him for that purpose*—have simply ignored them. To us, on the contrary, it has long been evident that neither his ‘system’ as a whole, nor\n\nhis theory of imagination, which is an integral part of it, can be authentically apprehended without first coming to terms with those two forces;\n\nand it is with the idea of coming to terms with them at the outset that we have taken the unusual course of dealing, as far as in us lies, with Coleridge’s concept of nature before coming on to his concept of mind (understanding and reason), of man, of imagination and other things. To proceed in this order may have some disadvantages, but it will have two important merits. Firstly, everyman’s personal experience of\n\nnature does precede in time his experience of the working of his own mind, and we have all learned much about the former before we begin to reflect on the latter. Secondly the positivist or materialist (many would say simply ‘the scientific’) world-view itself adopts this order. It begins by postulating a physical process (whether in terms of “matter and motion” or of energy or of some other physical substratum makes no difference here), it shows how this process produced the human brain (of which the mind is a function) and then proceeds, on the basis of a brain so conceived, to propound whatever it has to propound about the mind. All this, though rarely stated and perhaps not often consciously formulated, is operative as presupposition today whenever the mind, whether conscious or unconscious, whether in its creative or its\n\nanalytical aspect, is debated or reflected on.” It is the tacit assumption of every received system of psychology, whether neural, Freudian, philosophical, theological or aesthetic. A certain concept of nature is in fact implicit in every concept of mind; and Coleridge’s own concept of nature—“directly the reverse” of all that most of us “have ever been accustomed to consider as truth”—is implicit in all his reflections and all his utterances on the subject of the mind and its operations, Most of the\n\n30\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\ncriticisms to which these have been subjected, whether fretfully or thoughtfully, are found on analysis to be based on the substitution of the wrong set of presuppositions for the right ones. His conclusions are rejected for failing to accord with premises on which they are not based. In particular they have suffered from the circumstance that a nonCartesian psychology will not fit into a Cartesian cosmos. Critics who prefer to bestow their attention on more immediate matters, while they take for granted as revealed truth the prevailing metaphysical climate of their age, are sometimes heard to grumble because Coleridge’s theory of imagination is for some reason “still around.” They are to be commended for their sincerity. There really is no room for Coleridge in their world. Something at least, then, will have been achieved by the method adopted here if it should be appreciated in future that Coleridge’s doctrine of, for instance, imagination cannot be refuted, or even intelligently attacked, without first meeting and disposing of Coleridge’s premises.\n\nAs before, we shall proceed by selecting and commenting on a few quotations, drawn from his published and unpublished writings, on the subject of these two ‘forces’ which, for Coleridge, took the place of the exclusively physical base presumed by the educated opinion of his day, and of our own, to lie at the foundation of the world. And we will look\n\nfirst of all at those early paragraphs of Chapter XIII of the Biographia Literaria from which we quoted above. They are, then, “contrary”\n\nforces (p. 28); but on the other hand they are “real” and not mere logical opposites. It is not Hegel but Kant, whom he cites to the effect that: Opposites . . . are of two kinds, either logical, that is such as are abso-\n\nlutely incompatible; or real, without being contradictory . . . a body, at one and the same time in motion and not in motion, is nothing, or, at most, air articulated into nonsense. But a motory force of a body in one\n\ndirection, and an equal force of the same body in an opposite direction is not incompatible, and the result, namely, rest, is real and representable.®\n\nAre they physical forces, then? Certainly not, though they do (as will be seen later) give rise to physical forces. The instance of a body at rest, because two physical forces are acting on it from opposite directions, was an illustration only, offered as some help to the imagination. But our two forces are “prior to all direction”; they “counteract each\n\nother by their essential nature”; they are “the primary forces from which\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\na1\n\nthe conditions of all possible directions are derivative”; they are “both alike infinite, both alike indestructible.” To which we may add (from the Essay on the Principles of Genial Criticism):they are “two conflicting principles of the Free Lire and the Conrininc Form.” ? They thus fulfil his own stipulation that a true system must be grounded neither in a thing nor an abstraction ;* and, because they are not abstractions but realities, it is possible for us to “contemplate” them intuitively. Every power® in nature and in spirit must evolve an opposite as the sole means and condition of its manifestation: and all opposition is a tendency to re-union. This is the universal law of polarity or essential dualism, first promulgated by Heraclitus, 2000 years afterwards re-published and made the foundation both of logic, of physics, and of meta-physics\n\nby Giordano Bruno.®\n\nNow follows one of the passages in which Coleridge attempts to express the relation between the two forces in abstract philosophical language, and where his adoption of ‘Hegelian’ (more properly Fichtean) terminology has perhaps hindered rather than helped effective grasp of his meaning by most of his readers: The principle may be thus expressed. The identity of thests and antithesis is the substance of all being; their opposition the condition of all existence or being manifested; and every thing or phaenomenon is the exponent of a synthesis as long as the opposite energies are retained in that synthesis?\n\nAfter which he continues with another attempt, this time taken from chemistry, to illustrate concretely and pictorially, the nature of “polar opposition” : Thus water is neither oxygen nor hydrogen, nor yet is it a commixture\n\nof both; but the synthesis or indifference of the two: and as long as the copula endures, by which it becomes, or rather which alone is water, it is\n\nnot less a simple body than either of the imaginary elements, improperly called its ingredients or components. It is the object of the mechanical atomistic philosophy?® to confound synthesis with synartesis, or rather with mere juxta-position of corpuscles separated by invisible interspaces. * Chapter 2, p. 24, above,\n\n32\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nI find it difficult to determine, whether this theory contradicts the reason or the senses most: for it is alike inconceivable and unimaginable.\"\n\n“Every power in nature and in spirit . . .” As has already been emphasised, we are beginning with Coleridge’s concept of nature; moreover in this chapter we confine ourselves largely to his concept of inorganic nature, the bearing of the two forces on biological evolution being left for subsequent treatment. This again has some disadvantages, since their interpenetration within the processes, alike of organic growth and of phylogenetic evolution makes a readier appeal to the imagination, which is helped there by the rich variety of familiar and picturable forms wherethrough they manifest themselves. Nevertheless it is believed that on the whole the disadvantages are outweighed by other considerations. In any case the question would quickly be raised, which is now raised at the very outset, by the words “in nature and in spirit”;\n\nand that is of course the question of the ‘ontological status’ of the two forces. To ask some such question as: are they real or are they purely conceptual? would be to accept in advance a categorical disjunction which Coleridge spent much of his life in denying and (as he believed) disproving. A less loaded question would be to enquire if they are of such a nature that any use can be made of them by experimental science. But that is a question to which no answer can be attempted until we have\n\nheard a great deal more than we have yet done of what Coleridge had to say about them. We will begin by hearing what they are not. They are not phenomenal; another way of putting it would be to say that, unless we are prepared to accept, at least for the sake of argument, the distinction, already discussed, between natura naturata and natura naturans, and to accept it as a distinction between two forms of reality, we had better not trouble ourselves further with them. For it is only in natura naturans that we\n\nshall ever find them. But let us hear Coleridge himself on the subject: All our inquiries respecting Nature (that is, the objects of the senses, or whatever is seen, heard, smelt, touched, tasted or weighed) may be gen-\n\neralized into two questions: First, what are the Powers that must be assumed in order for the Thing to be that which it is: or what are the primary constituent Powers of Nature, into some rnodification or combination of which all other Natural Powers are to be resolved?\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\n33\n\nSecond Question. What are the Forms in which these Powers appear or manifest themselves to our senses—or What are The primary Things, into some combination of which all other things are to be resolved, as into their first Elements? Answer to the First Question. In answer to the First Question I say,\n\nthat all the primary Powers of Nature may be reduced to Two, each of which produces two others, and a third as the union of both.1?\n\nIn the second place they are not hypotheses invented to “account for” phenomena. Coleridge himself carefully distinguished between accounting for a thing and “explaining” it in his Theory of Life, but it will be better to deal with this when we come on to the relation, in his system,\n\nbetween a ‘law of nature’ and an ‘idea’ Meanwhile any sceptic may quite properly treat them as hypotheses and therefore decline considering them further if he finds the notion of them incompatible with fact observed or verified.\n\nBut that is of course quite different from rejecting them simply because they are not to be found among the phenomena observed, or the hypotheses invented, in trim with post-Cartesian scientific method. When for instance Sir Herbert Read remarks that: “The Natur-geist [natura naturans| is not a phenomenon recognized by natural science,” one can only reply, patiently and with all due courtesy: “But of course it isn’t!” How could that which is by definition not a phenomenon be recognized as a phenomenon by anyone? And how could it be recognized even as a hypothesis by a natural science, which up to the present has proceeded on the assumption that “the final solution of phenomena” can “itself be a phenomenon”; for which “nature” is, not only theoretically but also methodically, presumed to be exclusively natura naturata? ** The two forces, then, are not parts of phenomenal nature; they are not body, nor in any conventional sense the “causes” of what is bodily. They are not material in the sense that, for instance, the forces of electricity and magnetism are material. These ‘constituent powers,’ as Coleridge calls them in the passage previously quoted, are acts or energies\n\nthat are “suspended and, as it were, quenched in the product.” * They are the ‘inside’ of anything to which we can apply the noun matter or the adjective material.* * Chapter 2, p. 24, above.\n\n34\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nIt is peculiar to the Philosophy, of which I have given this slight sketch as far as its introductory Science is concerned, to consider matter as a Product—coagulum spiritus—the pause, by interpenetration, of opposite ehergiesisrai\n\nAnd here the word pause is important. It will be recalled that in Chapter XIII of the Biographia Literaria the two forces are characterised as “both alike infinite and indestructible.” It follows that, when they are “quenched” in their product, they do not simply cease to exist. They are merely “suspended.” (In the illustration, hydrogen and oxygen are water “so long as the copula endures”—but they are also still potentially hydrogen and oxygen.) Consequently the ‘constituent powers,’ which have given rise to a body, may then ‘reappear’ in it as its function: a Power, acting in and by its Product or Representative to a predetermined purpose is a Function . . .16\n\nThe first product of its energy is the thing itself: zpsa se posuit et 1am facta est ens positum. Still, however, its productive energy is not exhausted in this product, but overflows, or is effluent, as the specific forces,\n\nproperties, faculties, of the product. It reappears, in short, as the function of the body.?7\n\nAnd this will be particularly important for biology, where The vital functions are consequents of the Vis Vitae, Principium Vitale, and presuppose the Organs, as the Functionaries.18\n\nBefore however we can proceed to the organic level, there is still some more to be said on the general subject of the two forces and the relation between them at the inorganic level. One way of putting it, as has perhaps appeared, would be to say that, in order to think with Coleridge, we have to supplement the familiar contrast between ‘potential’ and ‘kinetic’ energy with some such contrast as that between ‘energy as free power’ and ‘energy as structure. }® It is however a peculiarity of the two forces that we cannot even imagine them without at the same time imagining the special relation between them. This is the relation for which Coleridge normally used the word polarity, and which was for him such a common and indispensable tool of thought that in his notebooks, marginal annotations and some of his\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\n35\n\nletters to friends he habitually employed the symbol, to avoid the tedium of writing out in full some such phrase as “is polarically related to” or “is the polar opposite of”; as others, writing in a hurry, will often put “=” for “is equivalent to” or “is the same as.” We come, then, to the question: what is this “polarity”? And perhaps, to begin with, a few observations on the word itself may be of some assistance. Originally it derived its meaning from terrestrial mag-\n\nnetism, being found in the seventeenth century (according to the Oxford Dictionary) both in the particular sense of “the quality or property possessed by a lodestone or magnetised bar of iron turning so as to point with their two extremities to the two (magnetic) poles of the earth” and then in the general sense of a quality or property analogous to that of magnetism. The dictionary subdivides the general sense into two branches (a) and (4), of which (a) is defined as “the having of an axis with reference to which certain physical properties are determined; the\n\ndisposition of a body or an elementary molecule to place its mathematical axis in a particular direction.” It is in this sense that the word is used in, for instance, crystallography. Subdivision (6) is still more generalized: “The quality of exhibiting contrasted properties or powers in opposite or contrasted directions; the possession of two points called poles having contrary qualities or tendencies”; and here the earliest supporting quotation is dated 1818 and taken from Coleridge himself: “Contemplating in all Electrical phenomena the operation of a Law which reigns through all Nature, viz. the law of polarity, or the mani-\n\nfestation of one power by opposite forces.” 7° We shall return in a moment to the reference to “Electrical phenomena.” Meanwhile the precise wording should be carefully noted. Polarity is, according to Coleridge, a “law”; it is a law which reigns through all Nature; the duality of the “opposite forces” is the manifestation of a prior unity; and that unity is a “power.” It is not, that is to\n\nsay, any abstract “principle of unity” or of identity—a point which it is hardly possible to over-emphasise, since that is precisely what it is commonly presumed to be by the few who go so far as to interest themselves at all in these fundamentals of Coleridge’s thought. Moreover, most of the much that has been written, in the last few decades, concerning the “reconciliation of opposites” in literature, and often with express reference to Coleridge as its putative father, betrays a lamentable failure to understand what “opposites” and their “reconciliation” actually signified in Coleridge’s vocabulary. There is a world of difference between\n\n36\n\nWHAT COLERIDGE THOUGHT\n\nColeridge’s polarity and those “gorgeous ballets of dialectical opposition,” 21 to which we have been treated not only by literary critics theorising about poetry, but also by psychologists, and more lately by theologians seeking to ‘reconcile’ the sacred and the profane.* Polarity is dynamic, not abstract. It is not “a mere balance or com-\n\npromise,” but “a living and generative interpenetration.” 7? Where logical opposites are contradictory, polar opposites are generative of each other—and together generative of new product. Polar opposites exist by\n\nvirtue of each other as well as at the expense of each other; “each is that which it is called, relatively, by predominance of the one character or quality, not by the absolute exclusion of the other.” * Moreover each quality or character is present zn the other. We can and must distinguish, but there is no possibility of dividing them.”* But when one has said all this, how much has one succeeded in con-\n\nveying? How much use are definitions of the undefinable? The point is,\n\nhas the imagination grasped it? For nothing else can do so.?° At this point the reader must be called on, not to think about imagination, but to use it. Indeed we shall see that the apprehension of polarity is itself the basic act of imagination.\n\nFor that reason a single vivid picture of the law of polarity at work in nature may well prove more effective than a dozen definitions or statements of principle; and it happens that the 1933 Supplement to the Oxford Dictionary gives us just such a picture, when it hazards as an additional definition of polarity: “The tendency observed in some animals of a severed head-piece to develop a tail or of a severed tail-piece to develop a head; a similar tendency in parts of plants.” To think of directionally opposed mechanical forces, giving rise by their equilibrium to a state of rest, is very well; and at least it shakes us out of any obsession with merely logical contradictories. But to think only of that will in the end prove more of a hindrance than a help. We\n\ndo better to envisage something like two nations at total war, each with a network of spies and a resistance movement, distributed throughout the whole of the other’s territory—and each with a secret underground passage opening into the citadel in the heart of the enemy’s metropolis. * Though I am not aware that he ever did, STC might very well have invented the words contrafaction and contrafactories, to set against contradiction and contradictories.\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\n37\n\nColeridge remained all his life deeply interested in the progress and the problems of natural science.”® His Notebooks, in particular, are replete with observations on chemistry, biology, metallurgy and other sciences.\n\nHe was an intimate friend of Sir Humphry Davy. His foremost concern was with electricity and magnetism, then still in their infancy, and particularly the no-mans-land between electricity and chemistry—so much so that, among the many misunderstandings which he suffered from his friends as well as from his enemies, was the belief that he held electricity\n\nto be “the foundation of life.” 7 This is of course a complete misconception. Coleridge’s two indestructible “forces” are located in natura naturans, and are pre-phenome-\n\nnal. The positive and negative forces or energies of electricity, though they are not directly perceptible (as neither, for that matter, are mechanical forces), are nevertheless present in the phenomenal world. The way he himself put it was to say that, though they are not embodied, they\n\nare “material.” °8 But though the material, and precisely quantifiable, positive and negative energies which we meet with in electricity are not the two forces spoken of at the beginning of Chapter XIII of the Biographia Literaria, they are, like the rest of the material world, effects, or products,\n\nof those forces and they happen, in their relation to each other, to provide a particularly telling illustration both of the two forces themselves and of the peculiar relation (polarity) which subsists between them. To this they come, so to speak, so near that one could almost say: Here we have natura naturata masquerading as natura naturans.\n\nIt is to this circumstance that we must look for an explanation of Coleridge’s abiding interest in all he could learn about electricity and magnetism. The poles of the magnet, positive and negative electricity— these were not in themselves the “two antagonist Forces” that all creation entails. But they were forcing men’s attention to themselves; and in so doing they were compelling them to begin thinking about nature in\n\na different way, a way which might end in their again finding the forces themselves—in the only realm where they can be found—a realm to which the understanding alone has no access, but which is communicable, between one mind and another, only by an understanding laced with imagination.”® The very histories of the two sciences and the contrast between them seemed to him to rub this in. Thus, we find him\n\nwriting in the Friend:\n\n38\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nBut in experimental philosophy, it may be said how much do we not owe to accident? Doubtless: but let it not be forgotten, that if the discoveries so made stop there; if they do not excite some master Inga; if they do not lead to some Law (in whatever dress of theory or hypotheses the fashions and prejudices of the time may disguise or disfigure it):—the discoveries may remain for ages limited in their uses, insecure and unproductive. How many centuries, we might have said millennia, have passed, since the first accidental discovery of the attraction and repulsion of light bodies by rubbed amber etc. Compare the interval with the progress made within less than a century after the discovery of the phaenomena that led immediately to a Tueory of electricity. That here as in many other instances, the theory was supported by insecure hypotheses; that by one theorist two heterogeneous fluids are assumed, the vitreous and the resinous; by another, a plus and minus of the same fluid; that a third considers it a mere modification of light; while a fourth composes the electrical aura of oxygen, hydrogen, and caloric; this does but place the truth we have been evolving in a stronger and clearer light. For abstract from all these suppositions, or rather imaginations, that which is common to, and involved in them all; and we shall have neither notional fluid or fluids, nor chemical compounds, nor elementary matter,—but the idea of two-opposite-forces, tending to rest by equilibrium. These are the sole factors of the calculus, alike in all the theories. These give the Jaw, and in it the method, both of arranging the phaenomena and of substantiating appearances into facts of science; with a success proportionate to the clearness or confusedness of the insight into the law. For this reason, we anticipate the greatest improvements in the method, the nearest approaches to a system of electricity, from these philosophers, who have presented the law most purely, and the correlative idea as an idea: those, namely, who, since the year 1798, in the true spirit of experimental dynamics, rejecting the imagination of any material substrate, simple or compound, contemplate in the phaenomena of electricity the operation of a law which reigns through all nature, the law of Porarrry, of the manifestation of one power by opposite forces; who trace in these appearances, as the most obvious and striking of its innumerable forms, the agency of the positive and negative poles of a power essential to all material construction; the second, namely, of the three primary principles, for which the beautiful and most appropriate symbols are given by the mind in the three ideal dimensions of space. The time is, perhaps, nigh at hand, when the same comparison between the results of two unequal periods, the interval between the knowledge of a fact, and that from the discovery of the law,—will be applicable to the sister science of magnetism. But how great the contrast between\n\nTwo Forces of One Power\n\n39\n\nmagnetism and electricity at the present moment! From remotest antiquity, the attraction of iron by the magnet was known and noticed; but, century after century, it remained the undisturbed property of poets and orators. The fact of the magnet and the fable of the phoenix stood on the same scale of utility. In the thirteenth century, or perhaps earlier, the polarity of the magnet, and its communicability to iron, were discovered; and soon suggested a purpose so grand and important, that it may well be deemed the proudest trophy ever raised by accident in the service of mankind—the invention of the compass. But it led to no idea, to no law, and consequently to no Method: though a variety of phaenomena, as startling as they are mysterious, have forced on us a presentiment of its intimate connection with all the great agencies of nature; of a revelation, in ciphers, the key to which is still wanting. I can recall no event of human history that impresses the imagination more deeply than the moment when Columbus, on an unknown ocean, first perceived one of these startling facts, the change of the magnetic needle. In what shall we seek the cause of this contrast between the rapid progress of electricity and the stationary condition of magnetism? As many theories, as many hypotheses, have been advanced in the latter science as in the former. But the theories and fictions of the electricians contained an idea, and all the same idea, which has necessarily led to MetHop; implicit indeed, and only regulative hitherto, but which requires little more than the dismission of the imagery®® to become constitutive like the ideas of the geometrician. On the contrary, the assumptions of the magnetists (as for instance, the hypothesis that the planet itself is one vast magnet, or that an immense magnet is concealed within it, or that of a concentric globe within the earth, revolving on its own\n\nindependent axis) are but repetitions of the same fact or phaenomenon looked at through a magnifying glass; the reiteration of the problem, not its solution. The naturalist, who cannot or will not see, that one fact is often worth a thousand, as including them all in itself, and that it first makes all the other facts, who has not the head to comprehend, the soul to reverence, a central experiment or observation (what the Greeks would perhaps have called a protophaenomenon),—will never receive an auspi-\n\ncious answer from the oracle of nature.31\n\nWe have already emphasised the fact that the difficulty in expounding Coleridge’s concept of nature lies, not in its being incoherent or fragmented, but rather in its total integration; so that every part of it tends to involve every other. Thus, the foregoing quotation virtually plunges us into the issue of the relation between ‘law’ and ‘idea,’ and of both of these to ‘method,’ which it is our plan to reach only later. This\n\n40\n\nWHAT\n\nCOLERIDGE\n\nTHOUGHT\n\nmuch however should perhaps be said here: that the bearing, on precisely this issue,* of the discoveries that were being made in the domain of electricity was another (and yet, in a way, it is the same) reason for the special concern Coleridge felt with them. The understanding can apprehend only phenomena (that is, natura naturata) and the causal chain that links them together. If it ‘goes behind’ them, it can go only to other phenomena, hitherto unapprehended but forming part of the chain. Accordingly there must be ultimate phenomena, behind which the understanding cannot go. The understanding has played its part when it has delivered them to the imagination to contemplate (and here again we find ourselves pushed ahead into the issue of the relation between understanding, imagination and ‘Reason’). These are the protophaenomena—‘“central phenomena,” or Goethe’s Urphdénomene—and they are by no means confined to electricity and magnetism. They demand, though they rarely receive, our attention in every growing plant. But the positive and negative ‘charges’ with which electrical research in Coleridge’s time, and now also atomic and nuclear research, are at last\n\nconfronted, are conspicuous examples of them. To look beyond that stage for still other ‘supporting’ phenomena is (so Coleridge held) to wander off into the realm of fancy. At this point it is no longer for the understanding to continue exploring and analysing what the senses deliver to it, but for the mind to recognise the presence in itself of the naked ‘idea’ and, as it were, to exclaim: “Oh, it was you, was it!” * See Chapter 10 (conclusion).\n\n25 4 be\n\nLife ibeHs Studies in Words' C.
