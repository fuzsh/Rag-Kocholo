        "text": "The written monument of Coleridge's critical work is contained in 24 chapters of Biographia Literaria (1815-17). In this critical disquisition, Coleridge concerns himself not only with the practice of criticism, but also, with its theory. In his practical approach to criticism, we get the glimpse of Coleridge the poet; whereas in theoretical discussion, Coleridge the philosopher came to the centre stage.  In Chapter XIV of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge's view on nature and function of poetry is discussed in philosophical terms. The poet within Coleridge discusses the difference between poetry and prose, and the immediate function of poetry, whereas the philosopher discusses the difference between poetry and poem. He was the first English writer to insist that every work of art is, by its very nature, an organic whole. At the first step, he rules out the assumption, which, from Horace onwards, had wrought such havoc in criticism, that the object of poetry is to instruct; or, as a less extreme form of the heresy had asserted, to make men morally better.\n\nColeridge has exercised an enormous influence on modern critics. Including T.E. Hulme with whom modern criticism is said to originate, that one has little hesitation in giving assent to Hyman's significant remark that \"the Biographia Literaria\" published in 1817 is almost Bible of modern criticism.\" Saintsbury regards Coleridge as the greatest English critic and one of the three great critics in the history of literary criticism. In his stupendous work on the history of criticism he remarks that the Biographia Literaria \"is among the few works which constitute the very Bible of criticism.\" He considers the great literary critics and excluding one after the other from the category of the greatest critics he pronounces: \"So, then, there abide these three, Aristotle, Longinus and Coleridge,\" Although he hesitates to call Coleridge greater than Aristotle and Longinus, he nonetheless asserts that the former's \"range is necessarily wider.\" He admits the great importance of Coleridge in the modern age; hence he aptly remarks, \"For all, I believe, of these later days certainly for all whose mother tongue is English Coleridge is the critical author to be turned over by day and by night.\" This paper intends to establish Coleridge as a semiotic critic.\n\nIn his philosophical writings, Coleridge increasingly developed his thinking about imagination, a symbolizing precursor to contemplation, to a theory of contemplation itself, which for him occurs in its purest form as a manifestation of ‘Reason’. Coleridge is a particularly challenging figure because he was a thinker in process, and something of an omnimath, a Renaissance man of the Romantic era. The dynamic quality of his thinking, the ‘dark fluxion’ pursued but ultimately ‘unfixable by thought’, and his extensive range of interests make essential an approach that is philosophical yet also multi-disciplinary. This is the first collection of essays to be written mainly by philosophers and intellectual historians on Coleridge’s mature philosophy. With a foreword by Baroness Mary Warnock, and original essays on Coleridge and Contemplation by prominent philosophers such as Sir Roger Scruton, David E. Cooper, Michael McGhee, and Andy Hamilton, this volume provides a stimulating collection of insights and explorations into what Britain’s foremost philosopher-poet had to say about the contemplation that he considered to be the highest of the human mental powers. The essays by philosophers are supported by new developments in philosophically minded criticism from Coleridge scholars in English departments, including Jim Mays, Kathleen Wheeler, and James Engell. They approach Coleridge as an energetic yet contemplative thinker concerned with the intuition of ideas and the processes of cultivation in self and society. Other essays, from intellectual historians and theologians, clarify the historical background, and ‘religious musings’, of Coleridge’s thought regarding contemplation."
