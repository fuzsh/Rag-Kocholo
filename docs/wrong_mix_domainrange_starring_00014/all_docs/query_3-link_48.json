        "text": "Action legend Arnold Schwarzenegger has teased audiences with supporting appearances in The Expendables and Terminator sequels. However, he is also following Sly’s lead into the world of episodic series with FUBAR, which is slated to hit Netflix next month. Now Deadline reports that the man who always promises to be back is now back in a starring role in an action film to be helmed by the director of the upcoming Expendables 4.\n\nSchwarzenegger is set to star in Breakout, an action thriller from financier and sales firm, Anton, and they will be launching ahead of the Cannes market. The new Schwarzenegger vehicle will be directed by Scott Waugh. According to Deadline, this movie will feature Arnie as “Terry Reynolds. When his stepson, Daniel, is framed and sentenced to 25 years in a foreign country, Reynolds makes a daring jailbreak to save him and must overcome an overzealous prison warden in a race against time to avoid capture and flee the country.”\n\nThis film will follow a four-year hiatus that Arnold had taken after Terminator: Dark Fate failed to make bank at the box office, even with the benefit of having James Cameron attached and Linda Hamilton also returning to the iconic role of Sarah Connor. Breakout is due to start production in Eastern Europe later this year. The writer of the current original Apple series, The Last Frontier, Richard D’Ovidio is attached as screenwriter with a story developed by him and Nicole D’Ovidio. Richard D’Obidio is also known for the action thriller, The Call, which starred Halle Berry.\n\nAnton will be financing the film with Off The Pier Productions. Anton is in charge of the world sales, while UTA Independent Film Group will be co-representing the domestic rights. Sebastien Raybaud and John Zois from Anton, Jeff Elliott and Chad Moore from Off The Pier Productions are on board as producers. The director, Scott Waugh, is known for such films as Act of Valor and the Need for Speed film adaptation of the video game of the same name. His upcoming Expendables 4 features Sly’s last outing in the series and promotes Jason Statham to the lead role."
