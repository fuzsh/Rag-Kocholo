        "text": "1. Arnold Schwarzenegger 'done' with 'Terminator' as he trashes recent sequels\n\nHasta la vista, baby. Arnold Schwarzenegger told The Hollywood Reporter he is \"done\" with the \"Terminator\" franchise, even though the series itself is \"not done.\" On his way out the door, he trashed the most recent two installments, which he starred in. \"Five ['Genisys'] and six ['Dark Fate'] didn't close the deal as far as I'm concerned,\" Schwarzenegger admitted. \"We knew that ahead of time because they were just not well written.\" The series' most recent film, \"Dark Fate,\" was a box office bomb in 2019. So Schwarzenegger said he \"got the message loud and clear that the world wants to move on with a different theme when it comes to 'The Terminator.'\" He also revealed a planned sequel to \"Twins\" called \"Triplets\" has been canceled because director Ivan Reitman's son, Jason Reitman, \"f--ked it up\" and stopped the project after his father died. So whether it's \"Terminator\" or it's \"Twins,\" he won't be back.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter\n\n2. Nick Cannon mixed up his Mother's Day cards\n\nNick Cannon just made the mother of all Mother's Day goofs. On his show \"The Daily Cannon,\" the \"Masked Singer\" host explained he decided to give the women he shares children with handwritten messages for Mother's Day this year. The only problem? There are so many of them that Cannon admitted he got the cards mixed up, leading \"one baby mama\" to get \"the card about how I feel about the other baby mama.\" As of press time, Cannon has 12 children with six women: Mariah Carey, Brittany Bell, Bre Tiesi, LaNisha Cole, Alyssa Scott, and Abby De La Rosa, and De La Rosa was in the room with Cannon when he made the card confession. His takeaway was that he should have simply bought \"generic\" cards, as then this \"wouldn't have happened,\" though going even further back, the situation could also have been prevented by using contraception.\n\nThe Daily Cannon\n\n3. Cannes juror Brie Larson dodges question about whether she'll watch Johnny Depp's new movie\n\nWhen Johnny Depp's comeback movie screens, will Brie Larson be in the room? The Oscar-winning actress is a juror at this year's Cannes Film Festival, where \"Jeanne du Barry,\" a film starring Depp, is premiering. So in a jury press conference on Tuesday, Larson was asked whether she plans to see it. But things got somewhat tense as she expressed confusion over the question. \"You're asking me that?\" the \"Captain Marvel\" star said. \"I'm sorry, I don't understand the correlation or why me specifically.\" The journalist responded that they're asking Larson because she has worked with Time's Up, and there has been controversy over Depp's movie playing at Cannes given Amber Heard's domestic abuse allegations against him. Larson, though, declined to say whether she'll watch Depp's film. \"You'll see, I guess, if I see it,\" she said. \"And I don't know how I'll feel about it if I do.\"\n\nVariety\n\n4. Justin Long appears to reveal he and Kate Bosworth are married\n\nThis just in! On a recent episode of his \"Life is Short\" podcast, Justin Long appeared to confirm that he and Kate Bosworth are already married. When Bulgaria came up during the episode, Long noted he \"was there while I was really falling in love with my now-wife\" and she came to visit him on set. \"I loved having her there, and we just had the most magical time,\" he said. The \"now-wife\" mention is the first we're hearing that Bosworth is apparently no longer Long's fianc√©e. While it's possible he was just getting an early start on being a wife guy, People notes Long and Bosworth could also be seen wearing what seemed to be wedding bands in a photo she shared on Sunday. The two actors started dating sometime after she split from her husband Michael Polish in 2021. Long and Bosworth just announced their engagement in April, but apparently, they didn't want it to be a long one.\n\nE! News People\n\n5. John Cena is in 'Barbie' because he 'randomly ran into' Margot Robbie\n\nIt's a small Barbie world. John Cena plays a merman in Greta Gerwig's \"Barbie\" movie, and he told the \"Today\" show it's all because he \"randomly ran into\" star Margot Robbie. They worked together on \"The Suicide Squad,\" and \"Barbie\" was filming across the street from Cena's movie \"Fast X.\" So when Cena bumped into Robbie, he asked if there was a place for him in \"Barbie,\" offering to do \"whatever you guys need.\" Luckily for him, Robbie is also a producer on the movie. \"They asked me if I wanted to be a merman, and I said, 'Yeah, sure,'\" Cena explained, noting his involvement was a \"happy accident.\" He also teased that Gerwig has a \"very interesting take\" on the material, though you'll just have to take his word for it that he's in the movie considering you can't see him."
