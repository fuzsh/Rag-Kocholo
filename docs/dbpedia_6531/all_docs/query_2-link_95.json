        "text": "During the era of the 1500s, there may have been many queens that ruled many other countries, but one specific queen with stunning looks caught many people, especially men's, attention. She is sometimes called the Virgin Queen but is known as Queen Elizabeth l. She was known because of her father who is King Henry VIII and her sister Queen Mary who controlled England and Ireland, which lead the ruling of England to be passed over to Queen Elizabeth from then she was declared queen in the year 1558 at the age of 25. The only exacerbate of being Queen of England was they were at war with France. Once she became queen, the Act of Supremacy became law at the church of England and at that time the Act of Uniformity was also passed, which was the\n\nElizabeth I was Queen of England and Ireland from 17th November 1558 until her death in 1603. She was also known as The Virgin Queen or Good Queen Bess, the childless Elizabeth was the fifth and last monarch of the Tudor dynasty. Elizabeth’s forces defeated the Spanish Armada and saved England from invasion. She\n\nShe was one of the most famous and liked monarch. Mainly throughout those fifty years Elizabeth maintained the stability of England through wars and political turmoil. Queen Elizabeth grew up as a typical royal child receiving education and strived in art and music. Elizabeth was able to inherit and control a male dominating word and she did it well. Ruling with genuine love for her people she was able to provide the stability a nation needs to strive.\n\nShe gives an elite description of her life from childhood to her death. Elizabeth Tudor was the daughter of King Henry VIII. She became queen after the death of her sister Mary who had been a queen but died childless in 1559. Susan explains the significant changes in England made by Elizabeth after taking over the throne while upholding society values. She was known to be a Queen, who consulted before making major decisions. Queen Elizabeth also lived her life without getting married despite the vast number of suitors who came to seek her hand in marriage. She later died in 1604 thereby ending the Tudor dynasty (Dobson,\n\nQueen Elizabeth I was a major political influence from her time and still influences our world today. Elizabeth I was born on September 7th, 1533 in Greenwich, England. She was the daughter of King Henry VIII, the half-sister of King Edward VI and Queen Mary I (Ellis 1). Elizabeth did not only rule the country she had accomplished many other tasks among her lifetime. She wrote her own poems (Women Writers Of Great Britain & Europe 1), she never relied on translators since she had mastered languages like Greek, Latin, French, and Italian when she was a student (Ellis 1). Queen Elizabeth’s greatest accomplishment was being an extraordinary ruler of England. Another massive accomplishment of hers was reestablishing England back to Protestantism. Queen Elizabeth I deserves to be in the History Hall of Fame because she was a successful, popular Queen of England, who reestablished Protestantism to England.\n\nFirst, Queen Elizabeth’s reign was successful because she was well educated. According to the Folger Shakespeare Library website, she received instruction that only men received during the 1500s. She studied mathematics, history, and several different languages. She played music, danced, rode horses and hunted. (Folger.edu) She supported the country’s culture. For example, she loved to attend plays written by William Shakespeare. She saw “The Merry Wives of Windsor” and “Love’s Labor’s Lost.” (Folger.edu) As a queen, she was also able to communicate well with diplomatic ambassadors from other countries because she spoke so many languages. Because of the education she received, the kingdom thrived.\n\nQueen Elizabeth came to be known as one of the greatest rulers of the English empire. Under the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, a more efficient government was created. The church was unified, the English empire was expanded, and language, literature, and theater flourished to a greatness that would be impossible for almost any other period of English history, or any other European empire, for that matter, to match. Although there was a great rise in literature,it was theater that catapulted to greatness during Elizabeth's reign. Out of Elizabeth's era came Elizabethan theater. Elizabethan theater has such a variety of topics, that would make it virtually impossible to talk about in ten pages.\n\nWhen people mention about the word Monarchy, an image of a dignified, untouchable personality appears in their minds, for Kings and Queens have been living in massive castles and separating themselves from the rest of the population. Nevertheless, the case of a secluded sovereign did not apply to Queen Elizabeth I, who redefined the royal precedent quite uniquely. Unlike her predecessors who had lived lavishly and far from civilians, Elizabeth I employed her loving nature and rhetoric skills to capture the hearts of her subjects, making her being revered in history of England. Furthermore, due to her wide vision, persistence, and dexterity, she became a successful monarch despite people underestimating her during her period. Elizabeth\n\nThe Elizabethan Era was from 1533 (the birth of Queen Elizabeth 1) till 1603 (her death). Queen Elizabeth was the one who was responsible for what happened to the country during this era. For Queen Elizabeth, being part of the Elizabethan Royalty was a tough and challenging task. She played an important role within the religious conflicts for power between England and it's neighboring countries, had the constant pressure to produce a successor, and had to endure sexual discrimination for being a woman on the throne of England without a male counterpart.\n\nThe Elizabethan Era is known for the intricate outfits that men and women wore to court and elite social functions. The wealthy wore furs and jewels, and the cloth of their garments featured extravagant embroidery. The poor and even the middle classes dressed less extravagant and instead more simply. Elizabethan theatres such as the globe theatre were popular amongst the rich and the poor the poor were called groundlings or penny knaves and would pay a penny to stand in front of\n\nElizabeth I, “queen of England and Ireland, was the most famous of English Monarchs and one of the most successful women rulers in history.” (Row, 243). “She was not only concerned with politics, diplomacy, and the religious struggle against the Counter-Reformation, but was also interested in voyages, finances, literature, and the arts.” (Row 243). On September 7, 1533, Queen Elizabeth was born at Greenwich Palace. She was born to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn. Elizabeth was very fluent\n\nQueen Elizabeth I once said, ‘“ To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that see it than it is pleasant to them to bear it”’ (Elizabeth I). Queen Elizabeth I took her time on the throne in serious matter. During her time as Queen, she thoughtfully chose the right decisions to benefit her people, made sure that she was involved in her community, and handled all the responsibilities that came with being Queen. Elizabeth I was Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 until her death. Although it seems that Queen Elizabeth I was a successful and caring person during her lifetime, she displays characteristics that resemble Lady Macbeth in Macbeth written by William Shakespeare."
