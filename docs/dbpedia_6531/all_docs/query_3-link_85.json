        "text": "My high school history teacher once told me that apperently there was a tradition (superstition?) among the various Royal Families of the United Kingdom that the British Empire would last \"from queen Elizabeth to queen Elizabeth\", and consequently, royal offspring with any realistic chances of succeeding onto the throne would not be named Elizabeth, so as not to trigger the end of the empire. Is there any evidence of such a tradition?\n\nThis seems to fit what has actually happened; it is fair to say that the British Empire lasted from queen Elizabeth I to queen Elizabeth II. Queen Elizabeth II, at birth, was very unlikely to ever become the monarch; she would be very far in the line had king Edward not abdicated. Looking at the family tree of the British Royal Family (wikipedia), there are a few Elizabeths in it, but in each case, a younger sibling - except of course Elizabeth II.\n\nBut then, I cannot find any reference to such a tradition (it's hard to google, but that was my best shot), and it sounds a bit too good to be true. Is there any evidence of such a tradition, or perhaps that it is made up folklore?"
