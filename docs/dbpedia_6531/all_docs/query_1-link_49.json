        "text": "Elizabeth II's first of 25 official visits to Northern Ireland was as a princess in 1945. She travelled with her parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth as part of a 'Victory Tour' of the UK following the Second World War. Aged 19, it was her first time on a plane.\n\nThe following year she was joined by Prince Philip on her first solo trip to officially launch HMS Eagle, Britain's largest aircraft carrier from the Harland & Wolff shipyard. She also visited counties Tyrone, Armagh, Fermanagh and Down.\n\nIn 1949 she travelled over with her now husband. The couple were conferred the freedom of Belfast at City Hall and were received by Northern Ireland Prime Minister Sir Basil Brooke and the Belfast Lord Mayor Sir William Neill MP. No nationalist councillors were present.\n\nThe visit brought a quarter of a million well-wishers onto the streets. The Belfast Telegraph reported at the time: âAgainst the background of the setting up of the Irish Republic, their welcome is showing that Ulster is unchanged.â\n\n1950s\n\nCoronation visit\n\nElizabeth II was just 27 years old when she officially became head of state following the death of her father George VI in February 1952. She was crowned in a religious ceremony at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953.\n\nThe occasion was a morale boost for a nation starved of pageantry following the Second World War and was celebrated with street parties across the United Kingdom.\n\nâA colourful pageantry so rich in history that no other land on Earth could show to the worldâ\n\nThe Belfast Telegraphâs headline writers were in raptures\n\nThe three-hour service took place in front of a congregation of more than 8,000 people. The coronation of a new monarch was also brought into peopleâs homes for the first time, as TV cameras were permitted to capture the historic event - an estimated 27 million people in Britain watched the event live on black and white TV sets.\n\nVibrant scenes were captured in towns and villages in Northern Ireland where parades were held to celebrate Elizabethâs accession to the throne.\n\nWatch: Coronation Year â Scenes in Strabane and Londonderry (1953) Â© James Houston Courtesy of Northern Ireland Screenâs Digital Film Archive\n\nNot everyone in Northern Ireland was putting the flags out, however. The Belfast Telegraph reported how, in Cookstown, the local council had to convene in the early hours of the morning to discuss threats that âsomething seriousâ would happen if royal decorations werenât removed from a street in the town.\n\nThe very next month the new monarch was in Northern Ireland on a coronation visit with the Duke of Edinburgh. She spent three days in the province, taking in a scenic rail tour and stopping off to greet crowds. The Governor of Northern Ireland declared a public holiday to allow as many people as possible to see Her Majesty and a detailed programme of her itinerary was published. She would, the same year, commence her longest ever Commonwealth tour.\n\nHer second visit as Queen was in 1954 to launch the liner Southern Cross at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast.\n\nIn the mid-50s, an IRA campaign along the border gave a hint of more trouble ahead in the next decades, which would make the monarchâs trips come with many more security considerations.\n\n1961\n\nSeven years on and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh returned with their children Prince Charles and Princess Anne on the royal yacht Britannia. They stepped ashore to visit Carrickfergus and Bangor.\n\nWatch: Royal Visits to Northern Ireland 1958 and 1961 Â© National Museums NI and Tourism NI: Courtesy of Northern Ireland Screenâs Digital Film Archive\n\n1966\n\nThe Queenâs visit in 1966 proved to be a highly charged one. The atmosphere that would lead to the civil rights marches and the clashes that followed was building. A Sunday Times article published a day before her visit questioned whether Her Majesty should be going to Ulster at all.\n\nBut the Queen did travel to open a new bridge named in her honour followed by a civic lunch in Belfast City Hall.\n\nThe hint of anti-royalist sentiment became apparent when a concrete block was thrown at the royal limousine as it made its way to the Queen's next engagement, denting the bonnet as it travelled along Great Victoria Street in Belfast.\n\nA 17-year-old nationalist boy from west Belfast was later arrested and sentenced to four years in jail for the incident. When the Queen and Duke arrived at Hillsborough for a garden party they inspected the damage. \"It's a strong car,\" the Queen remarked, noting the slightly dented bonnet.\n\nIt would be 11 years until the Queen returned as part of her Silver Jubilee tour of the UK in 1977. The Troubles were raging and the IRA threatened âa visit to rememberâ, detonating firebombs in shops and business premises in Lisburn. Some 32,000 soldiers and police were deployed to counter the security threat.\n\nShortly before the Queenâs arrival an IRA bomb was discovered in the grounds of the new University of Ulster at Coleraine. Despite a request from the government to abandon the visit, the Queen would not be deterred from fulfilling her engagements and resorted to taking a helicopter for the first time to avoid security risks of travelling by road. Prince Andrew accompanied his parents on the Britannia, which was moored off Cultra.\n\nThe two-day trip coincided with the sixth anniversary of internment and the eighth anniversary of a 1969 Apprentice Boys march that led to widespread violence and the deploying of soldiers on the streets. On the eve of the royalsâ arrival, a 16-year-old Catholic boy was shot dead by the Army and a British soldier was killed in retaliation by the IRA.\n\nJohn Hume, then deputy leader of the SDLP, accused royal advisers of folly in organising such a visit on \"the most emotive days possible\". Republicans would go on to hold protests in Belfast.\n\nFourteen years passed before security chiefs deemed it safe enough for the Queen to return to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe decade ended in tragedy for the royal family, as the Queenâs cousin Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA in August 1979. A bomb went off on his fishing boat while he was holidaying at Classiebawn Castle, Mullaghmore, Co Sligo - killing him and three others.\n\n2011\n\nThe Queen made an historic state visit to the Republic of Ireland in 2011, which was seen around the world as a triumph for Anglo-Irish relations. It was the first time a British monarch had set foot on Irish soil in 100 years.\n\nShe made significant gestures that went above expectation, including visiting Croke Park where 14 civilians were killed by British soldiers in 1920, beginning her speech at the state banquet with words in Irish and laying a wreath at the Garden of Remembrance in Dublin in memory of republicans who died for Irish independence.\n\nAt the banquet, the Queen spoke of the \"knot of history\" that had been loosened in Northern Ireland through the peace process. On Anglo-Irish history, she stressed the importance of \"being able to bow to the past but not be bound by it\", adding that she viewed the two nations as \"firm friends and equal partners\".\n\n2012\n\nThe following year, in June 2012, Queen Elizabeth visited Northern Ireland to mark her Diamond Jubilee - in another hugely significant trip marked with much pageantry.\n\nOn the last day of her visit, one of Northern Ireland's greatest acts of reconciliation took place at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast when the monarch shook hands with deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness, a one-time IRA commander, firstly in private and then for the cameras.\n\nMr McGuinness reflected on meeting the Queen the following year, saying he was âconscious that she was a victim alsoâ. âShe is a human being and one who had been bereaved at the hands of the IRA yet still was clearly a supporter of the peace process,â he said.\n\nMr McGuinness is said to have commented favourably on her 2011 visit to Dublin and Sinn Fein said the meeting was a âpowerful signal that peace-making required leadershipâ\n\nThe Queen and Prince Philip later attended a Diamond Jubilee party with 20,000 people at Stormont, where they greeted crowds in an open-topped vehicle, demonstrating how tensions had eased during the peace process. Not everyone welcomed her visit, however, as some republicans made their feelings loud and clear with the message âÃriu is our Queenâ on Belfastâs Black Mountain.\n\n2014\n\nTwo years after her successful Diamond Jubilee trip, the Queen returned to mark the centenary of the beginning of the First World War, laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in Coleraine. In a lighter programme of events she visited the set of hit TV show Game of Thrones at Titanic Studios in Belfast and met the experts from the BBC series the Antiques Roadshow, who were filming at Hillsborough Castle.. A .young boy makes headlines by managing to take a selfie with the Queen during her stop at St Georgeâs Market.\n\nShe also visited Belfastâs Crumlin Road Gaol accompanied by the First and deputy First Ministers Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness. During the Troubles, both had been detained at the jail, which has since been transformed into a visitor attraction. The monarchâs tour with Mr Robinson and Mr McGuinness was another symbolic reminder of how far Northern Ireland had come.\n\n2016\n\nDuring the Queen's 90th year she made another visit to Northern Ireland with Prince Philip which would turn out to be their last. The royal couple recreated the scenic rail journey made during her coronation year. They visited the north coast, stopping at Bushmills to unveil a statue to Robert Quigg, who won a Victoria Cross in the First World War, and officially opened Bellarena Railway Station. They also visited World Heritage site the Giants Causeway.\n\nLater that year, a portrait of the Queen by Northern Irish artist Colin Davidson was unveiled in London by the monarch. The event was attended by Northern Ireland First and Deputy First Ministers, Arlene Foster and Mr McGuinness.\n\n2021\n\nHer husband of 73 years, Prince Philip died aged 99 in April 2021. Ongoing restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic meant that the Queen was forced to sit in the pew alone in St Georgeâs Chapel during his funeral while the nation mourned with her from afar.\n\nThe monarch paid tribute to her husband in her Christmas Speech that year - her last - remarking how the time of year can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. âThis year especially I understand why,â she said.\n\nShe observed that âlife, of course, consists of final partings as well as first meetingsâ.\n\nEarlier, the Queen was forced to cancel a planned two-day trip to Northern Ireland to attend an event in Armagh marking Northern Irelandâs centenary, on medical advice. It would have been her 26th visit to Northern Ireland.\n\nThe 95-year-old was said to be in good spirits but disappointed. She still kept a busy diary of events and dealt with her daily red boxes of official papers, embracing the lockdown routine of the video call.\n\n2022\n\nThe Queen became Britain's longest reigning monarch when she celebrated her Platinum Jubilee marking 70 years on the throne.\n\nNorthern Ireland celebrated with a four-day bank holiday in June. Thousands made the most of the occasion with street parties and beacons.\n\nâI have been humbled and deeply touched that so many people have taken to the streets to celebrate my Platinum Jubilee. My heart has been with you all\n\nThank you message from The Queen"
