        "text": "Queen Elizabeth I’s right to the throne wasn’t always guaranteed. Her father, King Henry VIII, had Parliament annul his marriage to Elizabeth’s mother—his second wife, Anne Boleyn—thus making Elizabeth an illegitimate child and removing her from the line of succession (although a later parliamentary act would return her to it). After Henry’s death in 1547, two of Elizabeth’s half-siblings would sit on the throne: first the young Edward VI, who reigned for six years, and then Mary I (“Bloody Mary”), who reigned for five years. Suspicious that her half-sister would try to seize power, Mary placed Elizabeth under what amounted to constant surveillance, even jailing her in the Tower of London for a short period of time. Elizabeth skillfully avoided doing anything that Mary might have used as grounds for her execution and, upon Mary’s death in 1558, went on to become one of England’s most illustrious monarchs."
