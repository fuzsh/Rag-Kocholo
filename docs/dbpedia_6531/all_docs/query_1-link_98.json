        "text": "Civil Procedure Rules\n\nProblems accessing court forms?\n\nSearch\n\nEnter your civil procedure rules search.\n\nCivil Procedure (Amendment No. 3) Rules 2024 and the 171st PD Update\n\nThe Statutory Instrument (SI) is published via the legislation website (together with the explanatory memorandum which provides fuller detail of the changes). The rules online will be updated in due course.\n\nThe Civil Procedure (Amendment No.3) Rules 2024 will enter into force, on 1st October 2024 and contains amendments in respect of the following:\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution – a suite of amendments to the CPR’s Overriding Objective in Part 1 and to other parts, to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution.\n\nReferences to Judges in the CPR – various amendments are made concerning the definition of “judge”. This properly reflects the status, as judges, or Masters and District Judges and provides consistency of language by removing some unnecessary and unhelpful distinctions between different levels of judges within the rules and PD’s.\n\nExtending Fixed Recoverable Costs (FRC) – amendments are made following the Ministry of Justice’s (MoJ) consultation on FRC issues in July 2023, on the issue of fixing legal costs. The changes will fix the costs of assessment in FRC cases both before and after proceedings have started. This will ensure that the FRC regime operates more effectively. In consequence of the new “Fixed Costs Determination” procedure, a new costs form, “Precedent U”, is introduced and will be available online in the usual way. Various other minor changes are also being made to ensure that the extended FRC regime works as intended and with clarity.\n\nTime Limit to appeal from the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court – updates Part 52 (on Appeals) following changes in practice in order to provide an express deadline for seeking permission from the Court of Appeal to appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nRetained EU Law (REUL) – a new Part 68 is introduced which outlines three new procedures to facilitate the effective operation of sections 6A – 6C of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA) as inserted by section 6 of the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (“REUL Act”). These will provide for the process:\n\n(i) By which the County Court of High Court (which continue to be bound by assimilated case law) may refer points of law which arise from that case to a higher court, to decide whether to depart from it.\n\n(ii) For a Law Officer to refer to the Court of Appeal to consider departure from assimilated case law and\n\n(iii) To be followed in the Court of Appeal where it is considering arguments about whether it should depart from assimilated case law.\n\nREUL Act commencement regulations received Ministerial approval on 28 May 2024 to bring section 6 of the REUL Act into force on 1 October 2024.\n\nLegal Advisor delegation – amendments to Part 73 remove a legacy limitation that it is only the Designated Civil Judge for Greater Manchester that can consent to court legal advisors being authorised to carry out specified delegated functions.\n\nSerious Crime Prevention Orders (SCPO) – the changes to Part 77 will enable centralisation of the process for applications for SCPO to the Royal Courts of Justice (RCJ). The RCJ is considered to have the relevant expertise in this specialist area of work. However, cases can still be heard by High Court Judges in the Regions/Wales as appropriate.\n\nContempt Warning – updates the provision in Part 81 which requires a committal application to give information to a respondent about their rights, including the right to remain silent. The amendment adds an express warning of the risk that the court may draw adverse inferences from that silence, if the right is exercised. This amendment follows caselaw and aligns with the position in criminal proceedings.\n\nWrits and Warrants of Possession – changes are made to Part 83 to clarify the operational procedure concerning notices of eviction. The reforms make the “further notice of eviction” a defined term and, in consequence, a suite of five prescribed forms have been updated. The forms are N54 Notice of Eviction; N54A Further Notice of Eviction; PF92A Application for a writ of possession [and of control] in the High Court; MO92B Order for permission to issue a writ of possession in the High Court; MO92C order for permission to issue a writ of possession in the High Court under Section 33D. The amended forms will be available online in the usual way.\n\nTidying Up – various amendments are to correct inaccurate or out of date cross references.\n\nThe 171st Practice Direction (PD) Update comes into force on 1st October 2024, save for the amendments to the Practice Direction – Application for a Warrant Under the Competition Act 1998, which come into force on the date when Parts 1 and 2 and Chapter 2 of Part 5 of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 have all come into effect.\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Courts Minister have signed the Practice Direction Update, which contains a suite of amendments in support of the Civil Procedure (Amendment No.3) Rules 2024 (above) as well as providing for the following:\n\nE-Working Pilot (PD51O) – Updating the PD in consequence of the changes regarding references to Judges (above) and extends the operation of the pilot e-working scheme by one year (to 1 November 2025).\n\nDigital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act 2024 (DMCCA) – The DMCCA makes three sets of changes to the PD on Applications for a Warrant under the Competitions Act 1988 .\n\nTidying Up – various minor amendments in consequence of the above reforms and/or to correct inaccurate or out of date references.\n\n171st PD Making document (PDF)\n\nThe 170th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 170th Practice Direction Update, which comes into force at 11am on 18th July 2024.\n\nThe 170th PD Update amends both PD 51R (Online Civil Money Claims Pilot) and PD 51ZB (The Damages Claims Pilot) to:\n\nextend each pilot scheme by one year, to 1st October 2025, to allow for further testing and development.\n\nallow for the national rollout of the “case progression” and “application” features to all related claims at the remaining county courts in England and Wales where both parties are legally represented (save for the County Court at Birmingham, where these features will be deployed at a later date); ;\n\nconsequential amendments, two clarificatory amendments and other modest tidying up.\n\n170th PD making document (PDF)\n\nCivil Procedure (Amendment) Rules No.2 of 2024 and 168th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Statutory Instrument (SI) is published via the legislation website and the online rules will be updated in due course.\n\nThe Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2024 will enter into force on the date on which the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (concluded on 2nd July 2019 at The Hague) enters into force in respect of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe SI contains Rule amendments in respect of:\n\nRegistration Model:sets out a registration requirement in the 1982 Act, under which parties seeking recognition and enforcement of a foreign judgment in the UK under Hague 2019 will first need to apply to register their judgment in the relevant UK court.\n\nRoute of Challenge:as the route of challenge, it is provided for a right for either party to apply to set aside a registration decision made under Hague 2019, and for consistency, the route of challenge for Hague 2005 registration decisions has also been amended from an appeal route to a ‘set aside’ route. Technical amendments are also made to the Hague 2005 provisions in line with the registration provisions.\n\nIntra-UK Recognition and Enforcement: excludes judgments registered under both Hague 2019 and Hague 2005 from the intra-UK recognition and enforcement provisions in the 1982 Act sections 18 and 19.\n\nOther policy implications: maintains existing policy in respect of obligations under multilateral private law instruments.\n\nThe 168th Practice Direction (PD) Update comes into force, variously on 31st May and on the same date as the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2024.\n\nThis update provides for:\n\nPD 51ZC – The Small Paper Determination Pilot: the pilot is extended to 1st December 2024.\n\nPD 74A – Enforcement of Judgements in Different Jurisdictions: Various amendments to make provision for the registration of foreign judgments for the purposes of recognition and enforcement under the Hague 2019 Convention.\n\n168th PD making document (PDF)\n\n169th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 169th Practice Direction Update. The 169th Update contains amendments to Practice Direction 51R (Online Civil Money Claims) and comes into force on 18 May 2024.\n\nThis PD Update contains amendments in relation to Notices of Change.\n\nPreviously, the provisions in PD 51R limited the use of digital notices of change to cases where all parties are legally represented, which means that if a litigant in person decides to appoint a legal representative, the court cannot be notified digitally; the notice has to be filed on paper instead, and then the claim has to be transferred out of the pilot.\n\nThis update widens the provisions to allow cases that are initially legal representative versus litigant in person, to provide for a digital notice of change to be filed where the litigant in person appoints a legal representative.\n\nPD Making Document (PDF)\n\n167th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 167th Practice Direction Update. The 167th Update introduces a Pilot Practice Direction 51ZF – Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021: Provision during piloted commencement. The PD provides for the civil court procedure to be used during the piloted commencement of the new Domestic Abuse Protection Order.\n\nThis practice direction adopts the same paragraph numbering as Practice Direction 36ZG of the Family Procedure Rules 2010 (the Family Practice Direction) where possible and, where relevant, corresponds with the Family Practice Direction, because pilots will operate in both jurisdictions. If a paragraph of the Family Practice Direction is not applicable, the corresponding paragraph in this practice direction is blank.\n\nPD51ZF is to be inserted after Practice Direction 51ZE, having come into force on 9 May 2024, in readiness of commencement. The PD will not be in active use until Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 has been commenced for piloting purposes. Courts in the piloting sites are aware of the preparations for the pilot launch. This information will be updated once a commencement date for piloting of Part 3 of the Domestic Abuse Act 2021 has been confirmed.\n\nPD Making document (PDF)\n\n166th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 166th Practice Direction Update.

This reference has been amended in the 165th PD Update to disapply rule 2.8(2) and further examples have been included by which trial advocacy fees are to be calculated where a claim is vacated or settled before the date listed for trial.\n\nCross-referencing in PD 28: As a consequence of amendments to rule 28.2 and rule 31.5 which are coming into force on 6th April 2024 in the Civil Procedure (Amendment) Rules 2024 , a minor change is required to PD 28 at paragraph 3.9.\n\nPD Making document (PDF)\n\nAnnual Open Meeting of the Civil Procedure Rule Committee\n\nAre you interested in observing the rule making process?\n\nThe Civil Procedure Rule Committee is hosting the annual Open Meeting of the Committee on 10th May 2024.

The amendments to Part 17 (Amendments to Statements of Case) includes a revised rule 17.1(1) to align with the judgment in Rawet v Daimler AG et al [2022] EWHC 235 (QB) Consequential amendments, in particular to cross-references of numbers of rules, in, or practice directions under, those Parts are also made.\n\nDiscontinuance of claims, causes of action and proceedings (Part 38) – an amendment is made to the definition of “statement of case” to substitute “counter claim or other additional claim” for “Part 20 Claims”, because the latter term is no longer used. ,\n\nQualified One-Way Costs Shifting (Part 44) – changes are made, following a public consultation, to the QOCS regime in personal injury cases in Part 44 of the CPR. This issue arises from the Supreme Court case of Ho v Adelekun in 2021 and involves the scope of set-off.

The 2022 Act reverses the decision in R (Cart) v Upper Tribunal [2011] UKSC 28, [2012] AC 663 and substitutes an entirely new test for the very limited circumstances in which judicial review (JR) will now be permitted where the Upper Tribunal has refused permission to appeal.\n\nAdmiralty Claims (Part 61) – a suite of amendments, to (i) provide that personal injury claims which do not require the expertise of the Admiralty Court may be issued in the County Court and (ii) to update the rules in line with modern practice and with the intention to ensure early disclosure, improved particularisation of statements of case and thus enhancing the ability of the court and the parties to identify the issues in a collision action at an early stage, and to manage the case appropriately. CPR Form ADM3 (Collision Statement of Case) has also been updated in consequence. The revised form will be published on GOV.UK in the usual way, in line with the April 2023 in-force date.\n\nTidying Up – several amendments are made namely (i) in consequence of the change of Sovereign (ii) Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016 to reflect changes in terminology; (iii) Amendments arising from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments – to correct errors identified by the JCSI in its Fourteenth Report of Session 2022-23; (vi) Apportionment in fatal accident claims – a correction of an accidental lacuna arising from a reordering provision in 2006/7. This is corrected by making CPR 41.3A its own “Section 1A” within Part 41, and giving it an appropriate title of, “Apportionment in Fatality Claims”; (v) Amendments in consequence of simplification reforms (to Part 16) made in the last SI (the Civil Procedure Amendment (No. 2) Rules 2022 (insert link); and (vi) Other minor amendments to address lacunae, including to rule 12.3(3) regarding the circumstances when a claimant cannot obtain a default judgment, to clarify the time at which any of the conditions are to be fulfilled.\n\nThe 153rd Practice Direction Update – (coming into force, variously, on 31st January 2023 and 6th April 2023)\n\nService by email – the amendments to PD6A are intended to address the effect of the decision in R (Tax Returned Ltd) v Commissioners for HMRC [2022] EWHC 2515 (Admin) – where it was held that a party who provides more than one email address for service, cannot be served electronically.\n\nSimplification Work – amendments made to the substantive rules mean certain PDs are dispensed with as being unnecessary in their current form, albeit that some provisions are retained in the mainstream rules. However, other PDs are retained in a revised format, thus: PD17 is retained, but with substituted para 1.4; PD19A is revoked (with preserved provisions moved into Part 19) and PD19C moved to become PD19A. PD19B is retained in a reformed state. PD21 is revoked with preserved provisions moved into the substantive rules, though more succinctly expressed.\n\nAppeals process in consequence of the Voter Identification Regulations 2022 – amendments to PD52D to facilitate an appeals process in consequence of the Elections Act 2022.\n\nExtend Pilot – PD51O, the current pilot for e-working, is extended for a further year (to April 2024).\n\nRevocation – the following PDs are revoked (i) PD55C (in relation to Covid 19 arrangements for possession hearings) which is no longer required because its provisions have already ceased to have effect; and (ii) PD51Y (in relation to Covid 19 video/remote hearings) which had expired except for the first sentence of paragraph 3, but is now revoked in its entirety on the basis that the remaining sentence no longer performs a useful function.\n\nOther Technical Changes and Tidying Up: (i) PD3A to make the provisions at paragraphs 2.1 and 3.4 of PD3A gender neutral; (ii) PD3F to update the address for the Attorney General’s Office, following relocation; and (iii) PD57 to amend a signpost to reflect up to date legislative references.\n\nNew CPR Forms: Derivative Claims: in consequence of the amendments to Part 19, two new CPR prescribed forms have been created which replicate the forms of notice annexed to the legacy PD19C. The new forms will be published on Gov.uk, in the usual way, in line with the April 2023 in-force date. It is anticipated that the new forms will be N535 “Notice in relation to derivative claim – for claims involving a company” and N536 “Notice in relation to derivative claim – for claims involving a body corporate that is not a company or trade union”.\n\n153rd PD making document (PDF)\n\nCPR Part 22 and PD 22 (Statements of Truth) and Part 23, PD 23A and PD 23B (general rules about applications for court orders) consultation\n\nThe Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) is seeking your views.\n\nAs part of its project to try to simplify the rules; this being a statutory duty under s.2(7) of the Civil Procedure Act 1997, the Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) is seeking your views on proposed amendments to Part 22 and Part 23 of the CPR\n\nIf you wish to comment on the proposed changes, you should submit your comments by 24 February 2023 to: CPRCRollingConsultations@justice.gov.uk.\n\nPlease do not copy your responses to other email addresses and please state “Part 22 and Part 23” within the subject heading of your email.\n\nRead more on this, including how to submit your comments on GOV.UK\n\nNews: Implementation of the extended fixed recoverable costs (FRC) regime\n\nOn 18 November 2022 Lord Bellamy KC, civil justice minister, announced at the Civil Justice Council National Forum that implementation of the extended fixed recoverable costs (FRC) regime would take place in October 2023. Meanwhile, work on finalising the new rules which will implement the FRC extension continues, including at the Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) meeting on 2nd December 2022. The drafting work is not complete and will be subject to ministerial approval in the new year. The proposals follow the recommendations of Sir Rupert Jackson in his 2017 report, and the subsequent Ministry of Justice consultation, on which the way forward was set out in September 2021. FRC will be introduced for most civil cases up to £100,000 in value, with some exceptions as previously set out. Rather than expanding the value covered by the existing Fast Track to cover “intermediate cases”, the plan is to introduce a new Intermediate Track, as recommended in the Jackson report, along with provisions for four complexity bands in each of the Fast Track and the Intermediate Track, again as recommended in the Jackson report. Full details of the proposed rules will be made available when they are ready, in good time for implementation in October 2023. This will include the detail of the FRC figures, as uprated for inflation since the Jackson report.

PD 51S is limited in scope to claims that would otherwise be brought only at the County Court Money Claims Centre (CCMCC) for claims where the claimant is represented; it was run on an invitation only basis. The Pilot under PD 51S has now reached a natural conclusion because of the introduction (on 28 May 2021) of the Damages Claims Pilot (PD 51ZB), which has much greater capability than the County Court Online service.\n\n141st PD Making Document (PDF)\n\nNews: Practice Direction 51S – The County Court Online Pilot\n\nThe Civil Procedure Rule Committee has approved the (141st) PD Update to repeal PD51S (The County Court Online Pilot), pending approval by the Master of the Rolls and Ministerial concurrence.

These changes remove PD10 and remove other text, to consolidate in the substantive Rules. This follows a six-week public consultation which closed 12 November.\n\nDefault Judgment – Part 12, which also reflects work on brevity and simplification of the Rules, the changes remove the supplementing PD12 to incorporate procedure into the substantive Rules. This was subject to the same public consultation referred to above.\n\nSmall Claims Track limit – Part 26 is amended to increase the small claims track limit in non-road traffic PI claims from £1,000 to £1,500.

Changes to Planning Court (Part 54) proceedings, arise from the simplification work to consolidate the planning PD provisions; a new PD ‘lifts and shifts’ provisions previously provided for in various PDs, into one focused area. The Rule change reflects a new PD number.\n\n140th Practice Direction Update (coming into force variously from 1st February 2022 in respect of PD51O Electronic Working Pilot Scheme; 14th February 2022 in respect of PD75 Traffic Enforcement and 6th April 2022 in respect of all other amendments)\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Justice have signed the PD Update.

Simons [2020] EWCA Civ 1182 to ensure consistency of practice and adherence of safeguards. A new example form of Order, which can be modified in individual cases is annexed to PD25A.

The amendments include carrying forward into the OCMC PD, the effect of some provisions that previously applied from PD7E, MCOL.\n\nto allow claimants who have applied for Help with Fees (HwF) to start the process of bringing their claim using OCMC.\n\n138th PD Making document (PDF)\n\nCivil Procedure Rules 137th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 137th Practice Direction Update to amend Practice Direction (PD) 51O – Electronic Working Pilot Scheme, PD 51U – Disclosure Pilot for the Business and Property Courts and PD 55C – Coronavirus: Temporary Provisions in Relation to Possession Proceedings.\n\nThe amendments are effective immediately, having entered into force on the 12th November 2021.\n\nThe amendments will provide for the following:\n\nPD 51O – Electronic Working Pilot Scheme: Changes the date for E-Filing in the Court of Appeal from 22 November 2021 to 10 January 2022 and the mandatory date for the use of E-Filing by a party who is legally represented from 17 January 2022 to 14 February 2022. The earlier dates were initially included in the 133rd PD Update, but it has not proved possible for the project to deliver in the original timescale, so the revised dates have been established.\n\nPD 51U – Disclosure Pilot for the Business and Property Courts: This pilot was modified in response to user feedback and some amendments were introduced, pursuant to the previous Update (136th PD Update). A further amendment is now required, to correct an oversight by amending wording which was intended to be omitted from the 136th PD Update.\n\nPD 55C – Coronavirus: Temporary Provisions in Relation to Possession Proceedings: The current PD is due to expire on the 30 November 2021.These amendments provide for PD55C to continue in two respects.

Second, the requirements that claimants must provide notices about their knowledge of the effect of the pandemic on the defendant and (where relevant) as to their compliance with the Pre-Action Protocol continue until 30June 2022.\n\n137th PD Making document (PDF)\n\nSeptember 2021: Temporary Insolvency Practice Direction | Courts and Tribunals Judiciary\n\nPre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents (“The RTA Small Claims Protocol”)\n\nThe Master of the Rolls as Head of Civil Justice has approved amendments to the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents (“The RTA Small Claims Protocol”).\n\nThe PAP Update provides amendments to the procedure on the Official Injury Claim portal:\n\n*A change to the definition of compensator to apply the definition to an organisation or business which is handling claims itself;\n\n*Changes to the procedure for going to court in cases involving RTA Insurers or Article 75 Insurers where neither party provides an address for the defendant, so that such cases drop out of the portal; and\n\n*Changes to the process for cases where the compensator accepts fault but initially disputes that the accident caused the claimant’s injury, then later accepts causation – in such circumstances the compensator will be treated as admitting liability.\n\nThe Protocol was first published in the Schedule to the PAP Update, approved by the Master of the Rolls on 18th February 2021.

The approach to the exclusion of narrative documents has been softened to prevent greater expense being incurred on the exclusion of documents than is incurred on leaving them in. These changes have resulted from a review of the way the pilot operates leading to amendments to paragraphs 7 to 10 of PD51U and the DRD and guidance notes.\n\nDisclosure Guidance – paragraph 11 of PD51U has been redrafted to remove the emphasis on the need for a hearing. Further, a new paragraph 6A explains that ‘court control’ over disclosure can be provided by guidance or by the court resolving differences in the traditional way by a party bringing forward an issue for determination by way of an application.\n\n136th PD Making document (PDF)\n\nCivil Procedure Rules 135th Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice have signed the 135th Practice Direction Update to amend the Online Civil Money Claims Pilot, to be governed by PD 51R which is currently in operation until 30th November 2023.\n\nThe PD is effective from 11am on 1 November 2021.\n\nThe amendments have 3 main purposes:\n\nTwo relate to admissions, namely, to clarify the time for payment of a judgment on admission and to clarify the terms on which a judgment on admission is to be made.\n\nTo introduce changes to enable a default judgment to be made in Online Civil Money Claims service (the pilot) in certain circumstances. At present, while a claimant may request default judgment using the OCMC system, if a request is received by the court, PD 51R requires the claim to be sent out of OCMC to the County Court Business Centre (CCBC) for the request to be processed.\n\n135th PD Making document (PDF)\n\nCPR Part 10 (Acknowledgment of Service) and Part 12 (Default Judgment) consultation\n\nThe Civil Procedure Rule Committee (CPRC) is seeking your views.\n\nThe CPRC has commenced a new project to try to simplify the rules; this being a statutory duty under s.2(7) of the Civil Procedure Act 1997.

In doing so, the CPRC has resolved to commence a rolling programme of consultation whereby drafting proposals are published for comment before changes are introduced. It is important to note that proposed changes to the CPR will be focused on drafting amendments and not substantive changes. Some proposals may relocateor dispense with provisions altogether.

At this stage, it may only be used by legal representatives, and then by invitation only.\n\nThe pilot scheme will cover claims for damages brought by a single claimant against a single defendant, where the claimant is represented by a solicitor who is registered with the service. The pilot will enable users to issue proceedings, upload particulars of claim, acknowledge receipt of the claim and claim details, file a defence (and extension of time for defence), reply and provide initial case management and hearing information. Thereafter, the claim will be transferred out of the DCP and will be managed as if it has been issued under the existing provisions of CPR Part 7.\n\nThe pilot will initially operate for three years, from 28th May 2021 to 30th April 2024.\n\nPD51ZB will be supported by published guidance, a technical specification for the DCP, and a set of “mock” screens which demonstrate how the system works. This allows for a slightly shorter and simpler PD than would otherwise have been necessary.\n\nCivil Procedure Rules – PAP Update (coming in force on 12th May 2021)\n\nPAP Update: PRE-ACTION PROTOCOL FOR PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS BELOW THE SMALL CLAIMS LIMIT IN ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS\n\nThe Master of the Rolls as Head of Civil Justice has approved amendments to the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents (“the Protocol”).\n\nPAP Update (PDF)\n\nThe Protocol was first published in the Schedule to the PAP Update, approved by the Master of the Rolls on 18th February 2021 (see below). The amendments come into force on 12th May 2021.\n\nCivil Procedure (Amendment No.3) Rules 2021 & the 131st Practice Direction Update\n\nThe Statutory Instrument is being published via the Legislation website. The on-line rules/web site will also be updated accordiingly.\n\nCivil Procedure (Amendment No.3) Rules 2021 (enter into force no later than 31 May 2021). The SI contains rule amendments in respect of.\n\nAmendment to rule 6 of the Civil Procedure (Amendment No. 2) Rules 2021 which amends rule 27.2, to correct a drafting error and some further grammatical amendments. (Coming into force on the 21st day after the day on which the Rules are laid before Parliament.)\n\nSubstitutes cross-references to “Practice Direction 27A” for cross-references to “Practice Direction 27” in CPR Part 27, in anticipation of the new PD27B ‘Claims Under the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents – Court Procedure’. (Coming into force on 31May 2021.)\n\nThe 131st Practice Direction Update(coming into force variously from today, 05 May 2021 and 31May 2021)\n\nThe Master of the Rolls and the Courts Minister have signed the PD Update.\n\n131st PD Making document (PDF)\n\nThe 131st PD Update providesamendments in two respects:\n\nStandard Directions to form an appendix to PD27B ‘Claims Under the Pre-Action Protocol for Personal Injury Claims Below the Small Claims Limit in Road Traffic Accidents – Court Procedure’ (in substitution of Appendix B to PD27B in the Schedule to the 129th PD Update).\n\nA suite of Practice Directions supplementing CPR Part 54 (Judicial Review) which have been revised in consequence of developments in caselaw and practice. CPR Part 54 is supplemented by four PDs (54A, 54C, 54D and 54E (PD 54B having previously been revoked)). The amendments provide for the addition of a new Practice Direction 54B to make provision in relation to urgent cases, and the revocation of PD 54C (which is now obsolete), with consequential renumbering of Practice Directions 54D and 54E as 54C and 54D, together with some modernisation and “tidying up” of drafting in what become 54C and 54D. The main changes lie in a recasting of PD54A, prompted by concerns expressed by the Court of Appeal in a number of cases (most recently, R(Dolan and others) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care [2020] EWCA Civ 1605, in particular "
