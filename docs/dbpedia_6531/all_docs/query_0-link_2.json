        "text": "Elizabeth I\n\nqueen of England\n\nBynames:\n\nthe Virgin Queen and Good Queen Bess\n\nBorn:\n\nSeptember 7, 1533, Greenwich, near London, England\n\nDied:\n\nMarch 24, 1603, Richmond, Surrey (aged 69)\n\nTop Questions\n\nHow did Elizabeth I come to be queen of England?\n\nQueen Elizabeth I’s right to the throne wasn’t always guaranteed. Her father, King Henry VIII, had Parliament annul his marriage to Elizabeth’s mother—his second wife, Anne Boleyn—thus making Elizabeth an illegitimate child and removing her from the line of succession (although a later parliamentary act would return her to it). After Henry’s death in 1547, two of Elizabeth’s half-siblings would sit on the throne: first the young Edward VI, who reigned for six years, and then Mary I (“Bloody Mary”), who reigned for five years. Suspicious that her half-sister would try to seize power, Mary placed Elizabeth under what amounted to constant surveillance, even jailing her in the Tower of London for a short period of time. Elizabeth skillfully avoided doing anything that Mary might have used as grounds for her execution and, upon Mary’s death in 1558, went on to become one of England’s most illustrious monarchs.\n\nRead more below: Position under Edward VI and Mary\n\nMary IRead more about Bloody Mary.\n\nWhat were the biggest issues facing England during Queen Elizabeth I’s reign?\n\nQueen Elizabeth I inherited several issues from the reign of her predecessor, Queen Mary I, including an unpopular war with France and the religious divisions that Mary’s campaign against Protestantism had left behind.\n\nThe threat posed by the former subsided with the 1562 outbreak of the War of Religion in France, and Elizabeth responded to the latter by returning England to Protestantism and having Parliament formalize certain aspects of the Church of England’s doctrine.\n\nAn issue that troubled her reign for its entirety was her lack of a husband and heir, a situation which she and others realized could potentially ignite a successional crisis upon her death. Still, she never married, perhaps because she preferred to keep power to herself.\n\nOne of her biggest trials—at least in the foreign policy realm—came when Spain tried to invade England in 1588. The ensuing naval battle would go down as one of the most famous ones ever and ended with England’s defeat of the Spanish Armada, which had until then been supposed invincible.\n\nSpanish Armada: Opening of the naval conflictRead more about the defeat of the Spanish Armada.\n\nWhat was Queen Elizabeth I’s relationship to religion in England?\n\nUpon assuming the throne, Queen Elizabeth I restored England to Protestantism. This broke with the policy of her predecessor and half-sister, Queen Mary I, a Catholic monarch who ruthlessly tried to eliminate Protestantism from English society. Elizabeth undertook her own campaign to suppress Catholicism in England, although hers was more moderate and less bloody than the one enacted by Mary. In fact, Elizabeth’s religious moderateness earned her the ire of some of the more radical Protestants, who were convinced that her reforms were inadequate for cleansing English society of what they saw as the vestiges of Catholicism. In reality, Elizabeth wasn’t interested in catering to either Protestantism or Catholicism, the zeal of both having the potential to disrupt the kind of law and order she was trying to establish. Her religious policies, such as the Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity, went a lot further to consolidate the power of the church under her and to regularize the practice of the faith.\n\nWhat was Queen Elizabeth I’s personal life like?\n\nQueen Elizabeth I was the daughter of King Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. When Elizabeth was three years old, Henry had Anne beheaded and their marriage declared invalid, thus rendering Elizabeth an illegitimate child and removing her from the line of succession (to which Parliament would later restore her). Two of Elizabeth’s half-siblings sat on the throne after Henry’s death in 1547: Edward VI, who acceded at the age of nine and died six years later; and Mary I, who operated under the belief that Elizabeth was trying to seize power from her for the entirety of her own five-year reign. When Elizabeth was crowned monarch in 1558, her lack of a husband and heir became one of the defining issues for the remainder of her rule. As the end of her life approached, she forestalled the successional crisis that might otherwise have arisen by designating King James VI of Scotland as the next in line to the throne. The rule of the Tudor dynasty ended with the death of Elizabeth.\n\nRead more below: Childhood\n\nHouse of TudorRead more about the house of Tudor.\n\nWas Elizabeth I a popular queen?\n\nFor the most part, Elizabeth I was a popular queen, both during and after her lifetime. This is evident from the affectionate monikers she earned, her often (although not always) cordial relationship with Parliament, and the celebratory representations made of her in the art of her contemporaries—the character Gloriana in Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene being best known of these. The admiration Elizabeth I garnered had a lot to do with her skills as a rhetorician and an image-maker, which she used to style herself as a magnificent female authority figure devoted to the well-being of England and its subjects above all else. She wasn’t popular with everyone, however. Catholics weren’t happy that she restored England to Protestantism, while some Protestants felt she didn’t go far enough in purging Catholic elements from the Church of England’s doctrine. Her public image also suffered in the last decade of her reign, when England was pressed by issues including scant harvests, unemployment, and economic inflation.\n\nRead more below: Elizabeth I\n\nThe Faerie QueeneRead more about Edmund Spenser’s The Faerie Queene.\n\nElizabeth I (born September 7, 1533, Greenwich, near London, England—died March 24, 1603, Richmond, Surrey) was the queen of England (1558–1603) during a period, often called the Elizabethan Age, when England asserted itself vigorously as a major European power in politics, commerce, and the arts.\n\nAlthough her small kingdom was threatened by grave internal divisions, Elizabeth’s blend of shrewdness, courage, and majestic self-display inspired ardent expressions of loyalty and helped unify the nation against foreign enemies. The adulation bestowed upon her both in her lifetime and in the ensuing centuries was not altogether a spontaneous effusion. It was the result of a carefully crafted, brilliantly executed campaign in which the queen fashioned herself as the glittering symbol of the nation’s destiny. This political symbolism, common to monarchies, had more substance than usual, for the queen was by no means a mere figurehead. While she did not wield the absolute power of which Renaissance rulers dreamed, she tenaciously upheld her authority to make critical decisions and to set the central policies of both state and church. The latter half of the 16th century in England is justly called the Elizabethan Age: rarely has the collective life of a whole era been given so distinctively personal a stamp.\n\nChildhood\n\nElizabeth’s early years were not auspicious. She was born at Greenwich Palace, the daughter of the Tudor king Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Henry had defied the pope and broken England from the authority of the Roman Catholic Church in order to dissolve his marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, who had borne him a daughter, Mary. Since the king ardently hoped that Anne Boleyn would give birth to a male heir, regarded as key to stable dynastic succession, the birth of a second daughter was a bitter disappointment that dangerously weakened the new queen’s position. Before Elizabeth reached her third birthday, her father had her mother beheaded on charges of adultery and treason. Moreover, at Henry’s instigation, an act of Parliament declared his marriage with Anne Boleyn invalid from the beginning, thus making their daughter Elizabeth illegitimate, as Roman Catholics had all along claimed her to be. (Apparently, the king was undeterred by the logical inconsistency of simultaneously invalidating the marriage and accusing his wife of adultery.) The emotional impact of these events on the little girl, who had been brought up from infancy in a separate household at Hatfield, is not known; presumably, no one thought it worth recording. What was noted was her precocious seriousness; at six years old, it was admiringly observed, she had as much gravity as if she had been 40.\n\nWhen in 1537 Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, gave birth to a son, Edward, Elizabeth receded still further into relative obscurity, but she was not neglected. Despite his capacity for monstrous cruelty, Henry VIII treated all his children with what contemporaries regarded as affection; Elizabeth was present at ceremonial occasions and was declared third in line to the throne. She spent much of the time with her half brother Edward and, from her 10th year onward, profited from the loving attention of her stepmother, Catherine Parr, the king’s sixth and last wife. Under a series of distinguished tutors, of whom the best known is the Cambridge humanist Roger Ascham, Elizabeth received the rigorous education normally reserved for male heirs, consisting of a course of studies centring on classical languages, history, rhetoric, and moral philosophy. “Her mind has no womanly weakness,” Ascham wrote with the unselfconscious sexism of the age, “her perseverance is equal to that of a man, and her memory long keeps what it quickly picks up.” In addition to Greek and Latin, she became fluent in French and Italian, attainments of which she was proud and which were in later years to serve her well in the conduct of diplomacy. Thus steeped in the secular learning of the Renaissance, the quick-witted and intellectually serious princess also studied theology, imbibing the tenets of English Protestantism in its formative period. Her association with the Reformation is critically important, for it shaped the future course of the nation, but it does not appear to have been a personal passion: observers noted the young princess’s fascination more with languages than with religious dogma.\n\nPosition under Edward VI and Mary\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFit for a King (or Queen): the British Royalty Quiz\n\nWith her father’s death in 1547 and the accession to the throne of her frail 10-year-old brother Edward, Elizabeth’s life took a perilous turn. Her guardian, the dowager queen Catherine Parr, almost immediately married Thomas Seymour, the lord high admiral. Handsome, ambitious, and discontented, Seymour began to scheme against his powerful older brother, Edward Seymour, protector of the realm during Edward VI’s minority. In January 1549, shortly after the death of Catherine Parr, Thomas Seymour was arrested for treason and accused of plotting to marry Elizabeth in order to rule the kingdom. Repeated interrogations of Elizabeth and her servants led to the charge that even when his wife was alive Seymour had on several occasions behaved in a flirtatious and overly familiar manner toward the young princess. Under humiliating close questioning and in some danger, Elizabeth was extraordinarily circumspect and poised. When she was told that Seymour had been beheaded, she betrayed no emotion.\n\nThe need for circumspection, self-control, and political acumen became even greater after the death of the Protestant Edward in 1553 and the accession of Elizabeth’s older half sister Mary, a religious zealot set on returning England, by force if necessary, to the Roman Catholic faith. This attempt, along with her unpopular marriage to the ardently Catholic king Philip II of Spain, aroused bitter Protestant opposition. In a charged atmosphere of treasonous rebellion and inquisitorial repression, Elizabeth’s life was in grave danger. For though, as her sister demanded, she conformed outwardly to official Catholic observance, she inevitably became the focus and the obvious beneficiary of plots to overthrow the government and restore Protestantism. Arrested and sent to the Tower of London after Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebellion in January 1554, Elizabeth narrowly escaped her mother’s fate. Two months later, after extensive interrogation and spying had revealed no conclusive evidence of treason on her part, she was released from the Tower and placed in close custody for a year at Woodstock. The difficulty of her situation eased somewhat, though she was never far from suspicious scrutiny. Throughout the unhappy years of Mary’s childless reign, with its burning of Protestants and its military disasters, Elizabeth had continually to protest her innocence, affirm her unwavering loyalty, and proclaim her pious abhorrence of heresy. It was a sustained lesson in survival through self-discipline and the tactful manipulation of appearances.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

There is with Elizabeth a continual gap between a dazzling surface and an interior that she kept carefully concealed. Observers were repeatedly tantalized with what they thought was a glimpse of the interior, only to find that they had been shown another facet of the surface. Everything in Elizabeth’s early life taught her to pay careful attention to how she represented herself and how she was represented by others. She learned her lesson well."
