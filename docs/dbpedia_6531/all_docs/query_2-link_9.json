        "text": "A land of contrasts\n\nFor Elizabeth, Ireland was very much 'an unwelcome inheritance'. The island witnessed the last private battle between Tudor magnates (the earls of Desmond and Ormond at Affane, Co. Waterford, 1565), and was also the destination of the largest army to leave England during the reign (17,300 men, 1599). Yet the conquest of Gaelic Ireland was long unintended, even though it constituted the Tudor regime's most ambitious undertaking (entailing the thorough Anglicisation of government and society) and the only significant addition to Tudor territory.\n\nIreland in 1558 was divided politically and culturally into English and Gaelic parts. The predominantly Gaelic west and north had a scanty, shifting population, with scattered, largely impermanent settlements, and a predominantly pastoral economy. A common legal system, social and cultural institutions also stretched across the North Channel into the Scottish highlands and islands, imparting some measure of unity. Yet Gaelic politics were intensely local, with the numerous rival clans and chieftaincies. This was, according to English officials, 'a land of war', inhabited by a rude and savage people ('the wild Irish') living in bogs and mountains.\n\n...the conquest of Gaelic Ireland was long unintended, even though it constituted the Tudor regime's most ambitious undertaking...\n\nThe smaller, more 'civil', 'Englishry' (the English Pale around Dublin and the south) contained numerous English-style towns and villages and prided itself on its Englishness and loyalty. Yet Gaelic practices and speech were spreading among those of English descent (the future Old English) and the costs of defending the queen's subjects there had lately escalated alarmingly. The troops were paid in 'harp groats' (heavily debased English-style coins, distinguishable by harps on the reverse), but administrative costs still exceeded income by Â£25,000 - 10 per cent of Elizabeth's total revenues. Reflecting the militarisation of society, moreover, English landowners still lived in defended towerhouses (outside the towns and the inner Pale), their tenants (and many Gaelic clansmen) in wattle and daub cabins.\n\nOptions for reform\n\nElizabeth's first governor, the earl of Sussex, remarked candidly that he had often wished Ireland 'to be sunk in the sea'. Withdrawal was unthinkable, however, both for reasons of prestige, and because of the danger that France, or later Spain, might establish control. Nor was there any glory or profit in conquering a wilderness: conquest, while feasible, would require a substantial army to drive the Irish out of their homes in woods and bogs, and an enormous effort subsequently to hold the country with garrisons and colonies.\n\n...conquest, while feasible, would require a substantial army to drive the Irish out of their homes in woods and bogs...\n\nFaced with these unacceptable alternatives, Elizabeth's father, King Henry VIII, had sought an economical middle way to bring the island under English rule. Declaring himself king of Ireland (1541), Henry had tried to cajole the Gaelic chiefs 'by sober ways, politic drifts and amiable persuasions' to accept English rule, offering them secure titles to their land and a role in government in return for their abandonment of Gaelic law,language and customs in favour of English ways. This strategy for transforming Gaelic warlords into English landlords ('surrender and regrant') remained a central plank of Tudor reform throughout Elizabeth's reign. Yet progress was slow, despite initial optimism when O'Brien and O'Neill had visited court to receive their new titles as earls of Thomond and Tyrone (1542-3).\n\nUnder Edward VI and Mary, English financial and military subventions were stepped up in a bid to force the pace, but increased coercion proved counterproductive, and the growing levels of violence alienated the local Englishry. In particular, an experiment with limited colonisation in Leix-Offaly proved disastrously expensive, requiring large garrisons to repel the expropriated O'Mores and O'Connors after the shiring of their lordships as Queen's and King's Counties (1557).\n\nElizabeth's policy\n\nElizabeth's basic instinct - particularly following peace and the withdrawal of French troops from Scotland (1559-60) - was to delay, so saving expenses. Only in the face of a grave emergency - a major rebellion or, later, the growing threat of Spanish intervention - would she authorise vigorous measures to protect English interests. Such a policy (if it can be so described) pleased no-one.\n\nThe border chieftaincies remained restive, fearing expropriation by English captains intruded to control them; New English officials and captains sought to establish themselves as landed gentry and grew frustrated at Elizabeth's mild dealings with the Irishry; Old English landowners were alienated by the burden of maintaining an enlarged English army and the abrasive conduct of army captains; and the queen's ministers in England were perplexed both at the costs of governing a remote borderland and at the ineffectiveness in Ireland of traditional Tudor methods of consolidating crown control over outlying parts. Since the 1530s, Wales and the English north had been reformed by extending the reach of English law and local government (abolishing feudal franchises and reducing 'overmighty subjects') so as to promote 'good rule' and 'English civility'. Yet in Ireland the military frontier frustrated similar attempts to enlarge the English Pale.\n\n...political considerations generally took priority over religious conformity...\n\nThe Reformation crisis also fuelled the government's fears about rebellion in Ireland. All three borderlands were 'backward in religion', but the queen feared that a crackdown on Catholic dissent as urged by her bishops and ministers might unite religious and political dissidents, driving Catholic loyalists into the arms of Gaelic rebels like Shane O'Neill (1559-67) who was intriguing with Scotland and France. Elizabeth personally expressed a desire to learn Gaelic, and demanded a Gaelic translation of the New Testament from her bishops - in line with the Protestant insistence on the use of the vernacular in church services - but others feared that Gaelic services would undermine the government's programme to make Ireland English. Thus, political considerations generally took priority over religious conformity: Gaelic translations of the Bible and Book of Common Prayer only appeared after Elizabeth's death. Nonetheless, the new Protestant ingredient in English identity (God's 'elect nation') also undermined acceptance as Englishmen of Ireland's Catholic Old English.\n\nNew initiatives\n\nElizabethan policy towards Ireland was predominantly reactive, but there were also some new initiatives to extend English rule. Perhaps the most successful was the establishment in Connaught and Munster in 1569-70 of regional councils (or presidencies), along the lines of those in Wales and the English north. Initially, their intrusion antagonised local magnates, particularly in Munster where the earl of Desmond's cousin, James Fitzmaurice, tried to whip up Catholic opposition and appealed unsuccessfully for Spanish support. Later, however, the councils became self-financing through the device of composition.\n\nComposition involved, in Gaelic parts, the commutation of the chief's right to take up supplies for his household and quarter his kerne and galloglass on his subjects for defence. This practice, known as coign and livery, had also spread to outlying English parts. Its English equivalent, purveyance for the army and governor's household, was also commuted, so reducing the queen's overall charges but generating fierce resentment in the Pale where it was seen as a new, unconstitutional, system of military taxation, levied without the subject's consent.\n\n...the theory and practice of English government in Elizabethan Ireland diverged alarmingly.\n\nEven more disruptive were the experiments at colonisation, notably in east Ulster (in 1572-3), and the Munster plantation from 1584 which smacked of ethnic cleansing. Originally, Gaelic chiefs like MacMurrough Kavanagh had tolerated small colonies of Englishmen on ex-monastic land to guard harbours and fords and civilise the natives. Yet, as with the army, the government had the greatest difficulty in controlling would-be conquistadores. English captains and colonists like Humphrey Gilbert and Walter Raleigh were less interested in teaching the natives the benefits of English civility than in making their fortunes by goading them into hopeless rebellion and then grabbing their land. Accordingly, the theory and practice of English government in Elizabethan Ireland diverged alarmingly. The queen and council in England aimed gradually to strengthen Tudor rule by making English law and local government more widely available and treating Gaelic chiefs and Old English lords as good subjects. English captains on the ground, often with Dublin's collusion, preferred a military solution, keeping the country under martial law to crush opposition and extend English rule by force.\n\nResponses to conquest\n\nThe result was a gradual escalation of violence and atrocities, particularly from 1579 when originally distinct strands of dissent - religious and political, Gaelic and Old English - began to coalesce. The Desmond rebellion in Munster (1579-83), for instance, coincided with an Old English Catholic rising in the Pale led by Viscount Baltinglass, supported by Gaelic chiefs, notably Feagh MacHugh O'Byrne; a further Pale conspiracy; and two minor landings of Italian and Spanish troops. The risings were brutally suppressed, with massive military reinforcements from England, and Munster was left a wasteland.\n\nThe Ulster confederacy led by Hugh O'Neill, earl of Tyrone, during the Nine Years War (1594-1603) was even more serious. His faith-and-fatherland nationalism attracted little overt Old English support, but Tyrone assembled a modern army capable of matching Elizabeth's army in the field. Following the English defeat at the Yellow Ford (1598), revolt spread to Connaught and Munster, and a Spanish landing of 4,000 troops at Kinsale (1601) left the issue very much in doubt. With Elizabeth facing bankruptcy, 'harp groats' reappeared to pay the army, in which 19 per cent of England's available manpower was eventually committed. The War eventually cost Elizabeth c.Â£2 million.\n\nThe risings were brutally suppressed, with massive military reinforcements from England...\n\nElizabeth thus paid a heavy price for her parsimonious and irresolute approach to Irish affairs and her inability to exercise effective control over her ministers there. Ireland was pacified, though partly destroyed, and the manner of the conquest united Gaelic and Old English in new forms of Irish Catholic nationalism (v. both the Protestant New English and Scottish Gaeldom). Paradoxically, English rule now enjoyed less indigenous support than in 1558 and depended heavily on financial and military support from England.\n\nFind out more\n\nBooks\n\nIreland in the Age of the Tudors by Prof Steven Ellis, Addison Wesley Longman Ltd (London, 1998)\n\nElizabeth's Irish Wars by C.
