        "text": "This week, members of The Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee will begin UK-wide visits to get experts’ views on how the life and legacy of the late Monarch should be commemorated.\n\nThe Committee, announced by the Deputy Prime Minister and established last year, is responsible for recommending proposals for a permanent memorial and legacy programme to remember Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe day-long visits, covering Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will take place in March. During these visits Committee members will meet with senior figures from Welsh, Northern Irish and Scottish public life including devolved government officials, charity representatives, art and design experts and young people. They will also visit memorial sites in each nation to learn more about the history of memorials and their cultural significance.\n\nDuring Her life, Queen Elizabeth II visited Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland regularly and was involved with numerous charities and military regiments across the UK. Because of this, the Committee is working to ensure that Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish perspectives are incorporated into this UK-wide project.\n\nOver the next two years the Committee is considering Her Late Majesty’s life of public service throughout her long reign. In doing this they will also engage with the public to ensure ideas and suggestions from across the whole of society are captured.\n\nThe plans will be unveiled to coincide with what would have been Queen Elizabeth’s hundredth birthday year in 2026.\n\nThe UK Government will support the successful proposals, and will work closely with the Committee as proposals develop."
