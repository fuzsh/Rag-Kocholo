        "text": "Elizabeth I was Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 to 1603. She was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nOn 7 September 1533, Queen Anne gave birth to Henry's second daughter, Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth I) at Greenwich Castle. This wasn't an occasion of big celebrations and her arrival was a muted affair and was overshadowed by the king and queen wanting a son. Before the arrival of the princess, Anne had ordered a letter announcing the birth to be written in advance, in which she thanked God for sending her 'good speed, in the deliverance and bringing forth of a prince’. On 26 August, Anne was taken to her bed chamber where she would give birth and she took formal leave from all male servants and the king himself. Anne went into labour on 7 September and at three in the afternoon the baby was born. It was a girl. After everything the king and the country had to endure this was seen as a major disaster for the Royal family. The king and queen tried to hide their disappointment but this didn't work as the Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys reported, \"the King’s mistress was delivered of a daughter, to the great regret both of him and the lady\".\n\nThe new princess was christened as Elizabeth after Henry's mother, Elizabeth of York, on 10 September 1533. The ceremony was very lavish but all of his plans for the celebrations of a son were cancelled.\n\nWhen she was just two years old, her mother was beheaded by the orders of her father for treason and adultery. She received excellent tutoring and excelled at languages and music, much like her sister, Mary. When her father died in 1547, she was taken into the care of her step-mother, Katherine Parr. Tensions with Parr over Parr's new husband, Thomas Seymour, led Elizabeth to return to the royal estate at Hatfield, away from the court. Her relationship with Seymour later came under scrutiny, and Seymour was tried for conspiring to wed Elizabeth in a bid to gain power. Found guilty, Seymour was executed.\n\nBoth Elizabeth and Mary were declared illegitimate following both of their mothers not giving Henry a son. They were stripped of their princess titles and were known as Lady Elizabeth and Lady Mary.\n\nAccession[]\n\nWhen her sister, Mary, had died Elizabeth was the only rightful person to succeed the throne as Mary had no children and there were no more surviving siblings. There were problems with Elizabeth at first though as she was born to Henry and Anne whilst Henry's first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was still living and this made Elizabeth illegitimate according to Catholic law, which Mary had just restored in England.\n\nMary I died on 17 November 1558 and Elizabeth immediately became queen. Parliament was assembled by eight o'clock and the Commons joined the Lords to agree that the Lady Elizabeth must be proclaimed Mary's successor immediately. The Lady Elizabeth's closest adviser, Sir William Cecil, just fortunately happened to have a copy of the correct wording on him and the new queen was duly proclaimed. One of her first actions was to make Cecil her principal minister.\n\nOn 23 November, she moved from Hatfield to London, which was buzzing with excitement. Splendidly dressed in purple velvet, she rode in procession on the 28th through crowded streets from the Charterhouse to the Tower of London. She had once been a prisoner there, but now children recited speeches to her at points along the route and there was much joyful music and firing off of guns. Elizabeth moved to Whitehall Palace on the 23rd and back to the Tower by water on January 12th in a display which an Italian onlooker compared favourably to the annual occasion in Venice when the city wed the sea. The climax of showmanship came with her procession from the Tower to Westminster on the 14th, escorted by a thousand riders on horseback through occasional snow flurries. Magnificently robed in cloth of gold, she was carried slowly along in an open litter, so that the cheering crowds could see her. Two mules in gold brocade bore the litter and in the procession marched the gentlemen pensioners in crimson damask carrying gilt battle-axes and an army of footmen in crimson jerkins adorned with a white and a red rose and the letters E.R. The streets themselves were lined with wooden rails draped in tapestries and silks and the City companies turned out in their liveries to applaud the new queen on her way. At intervals along the route through the City there were pageants and music, and recitations by children. Thousands of people had waited patiently for hours behind the barriers to see the show and banners saluted Elizabeth from windows along the way. The procession took the entire afternoon as she stopped the litter frequently for people in the crowd who wanted to speak to her or give her nosegays. She was crowned in Westminster Abbey the next day and when she was formally presented to her people there was such a huge shout and noise of trumpets, fifes, drums and ringing of bells that an observer said it was as if the world had come to an end. The ceremony was followed by the customary feast in Westminster Hall, where the monarch, in full majesty with her sceptre and orb smiled rapturously on all beholders. Elizabeth had already begun to make herself the sun around which her country revolved. Even the grumpy Spanish envoy admitted that she 'gives her orders and has her way as absolutely as her father did'. It was under her that England would emerge as a world power.\n\nAlteration of Religion[]\n\nThe first business of the reign was the alteration of religion. During the reign of Edward VI, Stephen Gardiner had protested against religious change. Both Edward and Mary's reigns vindicated his warning and Elizabeth's reign turned into a political principle. In the case of Elizabeth, there was no doubt about the direction of change. She wanted Protestantism back in England and to virtually undo what her sister had done. It was the circumstances of her own birth that determined her stance on religion, not necessarily on what her mother believed in. As the papacy hadn't recognised Henry's divorce as valid it was on the authority of the Bible alone, of the Bible as opposed to the Catholic Church, that Elizabeth based her very right to the throne, and in a sense her very right to life.\n\nYet Elizabeth was one of the first generation to grow up out of communion with the Church of Rome, and therefore lacked that sympathy with the 'old religion', which still characterised the majority of her subjects. Firstly, there were problems in English law regarding the rights of inheritance to children born out of wedlock, problems which couldn't necessarily be resolved by papal dispensation. From the Catholic point of view, Elizabeth could never be more than a legitimised bastard. But from a Protestant view, her birth could be reckoned legitimate before God.\n\nThe alteration of religion was transacted in Parliament in 1559.\n\nPossible Marriage[]\n\nFrom the moment she ascended the throne, questions were asked about when Elizabeth would get married. She received many offers but never accepted any and therefore had no children. The reasons for this aren't fully known. She did however, consider some suitors up until she was fifty years old. One of these was Francis, Duke of Anjou. While risking possible loss of power like her sister, who played into the hands of King Philip II of Spain, marriage offered the chance of an heir. However, the choice of a husband might also provoke political instability or even insurrection.\n\nThere was also interest in Robert Dudley, who Elizabeth had reportedly been in love with for a while. His wife was ill and Elizabeth wanted to marry him if his wife was to die. His wife did die in September 1560, from falling down stairs. Many people said that Robert had killed his wife in order to marry the queen. Elizabeth seriously considered marrying Dudley for some time. However, William Cecil, Nicholas Throckmorton, and some conservative peers made their disapproval unmistakably clear. There were even rumours that the nobility would rise if the marriage took place.\n\nScotland and Mary, Queen of Scots[]\n\nReligious concerns dominated politics of Elizabeth's reign from start to finish. Elizabeth's regime was keen as those of Edward and Henry before it to encourage the Reformation cause in Scotland to close England's back door to potential enemies. With Elizabeth's cousin, Mary, Queen of Scots, married to Dauphin Francis, the prospect that the French may invade through Scotland was a very real one.\n\nElizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there. She feared that the French planned to invade England and put her Catholic cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. Mary was considered by many to be the heir to the English crown, being the granddaughter of Henry VIII's elder sister, Margaret. Mary boasted being \"the nearest kinswoman she hath\". Elizabeth was persuaded to send a force into Scotland to aid the Protestant rebels, and though the campaign was inept, the resulting Treaty of Edinburgh of July 1560 removed the French threat in the north. When Mary returned to Scotland in 1561 to take up the reins of power, the country had an established Protestant church and was run by a council of Protestant nobles supported by Elizabeth. Mary refused to ratify the treaty.\n\nIn 1563 Elizabeth proposed her own suitor, Robert Dudley, as a husband for Mary, without asking either of the two people concerned. Both proved unenthusiastic, and in 1565 Mary married Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, who carried his own claim to the English throne. The marriage was the first of a series of errors of judgement by Mary that handed the victory to the Scottish Protestants and to Elizabeth. Darnley quickly became unpopular and was murdered in February 1567 by conspirators almost certainly led by James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. Shortly afterwards, on 15 May 1567, Mary married Bothwell, arousing suspicions that she had been party to the murder of her husband.\n\nThese events led rapidly to Mary's defeat and imprisonment in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords forced her to abdicate in favour of her son James VI, who had been born in June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's first instinct was to restore her fellow monarch but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.\n\nThe Catholic Problem[]\n\nThe northern earls had rallied their troops under a Catholic banner that was traditionally housed at the shrine in Durham Cathedral, the banner in which the men of the north were accustomed to march against the Scots. This reminded Elizabeth of the political risks inherent in religious division. Their public line though was to maintain that religion was just a pretence to conceal the rebels' real objective. The lesson was hammered home by the decision of Pope Pius V to excommunicate and depose Elizabeth as a heretic and a tyrant. The papal bull announcing this sentence appeared in February 1570, just as the last of the revolts were stopped. Henceforth it was possible to argue that no good Catholic could be a loyal subject to the queen. The process began almost immediately in the 1571 Parliament, where calls for the execution of Mary Stuart and Norfolk were accompanied by frenzied proposals for dealing with papists. A bill to levy heavy fines on Catholics who refused to take communion in their parish church failed only because Elizabeth herself exercised the royal veto.\n\nWar with Spain[]\n\nIt was only towards the end of the 1570s that the cold war between England and Spain started to heat up. In 1580, the direct line of succession to the throne of Portugal expired and on a shortlist of potential heirs, Philip II had the best claim. There was, however, a Portuguese claim but he was a bastard. Overwhelming force secured the throne for Philip, and thus brought under his control the vast financial resources of Portugal's trade and overseas empire. Philip's agents plotted in Rome, France and England with Elizabeth's disaffected Catholic subjects. Vast strategic schemes were devised for the invasion of Scotland and then England, with a view to substituting Mary, Queen of Scots for Elizabeth. At home in England, plans to assassinate Elizabeth were unmasked with a regularity that was at times suspicious.\n\nElizabeth gave her ever more open support to the war at sea being waged by privateers such as Francis Drake, who was knighted by Elizabeth on board the Golden Hind. With English aid to the Portuguese pretender, Don Antonio, and Spanish aid to the rebels in Ireland, the countries drifted towards a war that was now seen as inevitable. There was no formal declaration of war but when Drake sailed for the West Indies in autumn 1585, he did so under the commission of Elizabeth, which made his expedition an act of war.\n\nUnder a treaty signed in August at Nonsuch Palace, the Earl of Leicester led a force of several thousands to assist Philip's enemies in the Netherlands. This represented an important shift in the queen's policy. Since the expedition to Le Havre in 1562-63, Elizabeth had held out against invitations to send troops into foreign theatres. As queen, she had little to gain from war but kings and nobles would gain glory in conquest. Elizabeth had a clear sense of the cost of going to war and a sense that such benefits as there may be would mostly redound somewhere. She hesitated a long time before finally agreeing to go to war and also hesitated long to have Earl of Leicester to lead the expedition.\n\nThe Earl of Leicester saw this as a chance to get himself in the history books. Elizabeth was aware of this, and also the danger of entrusting too many troops to one of her subjects. She therefore kept a close eye on the on-goings in the Netherlands. Leicester slowed down Farnese's advance but he eventually succumbed, accepting the invitation by the Dutch to become their Governor-General in January 1586. Elizabeth was livid and after some characteristic changes of mind, she compelled him to resign the title.\n\nExecution of Mary Queen of Scots[]\n\nThe concern of the 1580s was the 'enemy within', the Roman Catholics and above all, Mary Queen of Scots, who might so easily become a focus for their discontent. The fear of Catholic plots peaked in one of the most extraordinary episode of the reign, the making of the 'Bond Association' in 1584, an episode that revealed both the deep devotion of the people to their queen and their increasing preparedness to act together without her lead. Inspired by the assassination of William of Orange on 10 July 1584, the Bond Association was a contract or agreement of a group of people to pursue common objectives. The objectives were the protection of the queen's life and, in the event of her suspicious or sudden death, vengeance against the perpetrators would take place.\n\nThe subtext of bond was the importance of keeping Mary Queen of Scots off the throne at all costs to defend the Protestant establishment. The bond, drafted in October by the Privy Council, rapidly succeeded in attracting signatures of the most gentry, civic patriarchs of England and vast numbers of enthusiastic men of the lower sorts. It became a nationwide expression of loyalty to the queen. Although under pressure, it was also signed by some Catholic gentlemen. The Bond of Association was the index of not only a Protestant country, but of a country that would do almost anything to stop a Catholic from taking the throne. The tone of the document was mitigated in Parliament, which met over the winter of 1584-85. Elizabeth was far from happy with the rough justice proposed from the original bond in the form of a commission of enquiry to precede any vengeance.\n\nPressure for the execution of Mary Queen of Scots, which had been building up since 1570, became irresistible in the context of all-out war with Catholic Spain, especially now Philip II was cultivating links with Mary's French relatives, the very Catholic Guise dynasty. Mary 'sealed her own fate' when she became involved in the Babington plot to secure her liberation and Elizabeth's assassination. Francis Walsingham, who controlled Mary's communication with the outside world, allowed her to believe that she had a secure link to a group of young Catholic adventurers led by, Anthony Babington. Once the plot was exposed, Mary was tried in a special court of English nobles. Elizabeth knew how posterity would view any decision to execute Mary, and brought a meeting in Parliament in October 1586 either to consider alternatives or to spread the burden of guilt. Parliament added to the pressure which the Privy Council was exerting and Elizabeth was compelled to sign the death warrant of Mary. Even then she hesitated to execute it and it was her Privy Council that finally despatched it.\n\nMary Queen of Scots was beheaded on 8 February 1587. Even Elizabeth's closest adviser, William Cecil, was in disgrace but most of her wrath fell on her unfortunate Secretary, William Davidson, whose career was destroyed by his role in this ordeal.\n\nThe Spanish Armada[]\n\nEngland's intervention in the Netherlands achieved one thing. It provoked Philip II into direct action against England. His decision to launch an assault against England was a fateful one and preparations for the big expedition occupied most of the year of 1587. But the Armada set sail in summer 1588 and it made its way to its rendezvous off Calais. Here the deficiencies of Philip's strategy became apparent, as Farnese's invasion barges couldn't get out to join Medina Sidonia's deep-water fleet without exposing themselves to the guns of the smaller English and Dutch vessels. The fleet was stampeded by English fireships, and then scattered by the winds. Attempting to return home by going around the British Isles, about half of Spanish ships were sunk or wrecked by storms or enemy fire. Thousands of men were lost as well as dozens of ships. The English victory was total.\n\nMuch of Elizabeth's reputation was built from her displays of courage in 1588, when the landing of Spanish troops seemed imminent. Her appearance at Tilbury, where she made her famous address to the troops, was an inspiring moment for her people. Although Elizabeth's army was large, it was fortunate to not have been put to the test much.\n\nThe defeat of the Armada was the highest point of Elizabeth's reign and England had seen off the most powerful invasion launched against it since the Norman Conquest. Victory was celebrated through music, art and literature and Elizabeth appeared as the saviour of her people.\n\nThe Irish Conflict[]\n\nThere is no indication that Elizabeth herself knew about what was going on in Ireland but the 'Irish Problem' was apparent to her advisors from the very beginning. This problem was, as the 'Device for Alteration of Religion' pointed out, that:\n\n\"Ireland also will be very difficultly stayed in their obedience, by reason of the clergy that is so addicted to Rome.\"\n\nSince the 1530s, traditional Irish Catholicism had been driven into a potent alliance with incipient Irish nationalities. Elizabeth realised that royal authority was under threat. No Tudor was slow to detect treason.\n\nElizabeth's sole concern with Ireland was to introduce Protestant Reformation there as she did with England. But the Reformation that was carried through the Dublin Parliament early in 1560 by the Earl of Sussex was being sown on untilled ground, and found it hard to put down roots. Much of Ireland was out of control by England. Ireland was a perpetual drain on England's resources. Elizabeth was not prepared to put in money that might have sufficed to introduce the English model of government to which English policy aspired. The overriding priority was to prevent Ireland from becoming a threat to England. At times, especially in the 1590s, even this modest objective required funding on a big scale.\n\nPhilip II looked to foment unrest in Elizabeth's backyard. It was a small force of Spanish and Italian mercenaries which sparked off the rebellion of the Fitzgeralds of Munster in 1579. The rebellion was largely defeated withing a year, but the English troops ravaged the province for years before capturing and killing the head of the Fitzgeralds in 1583. When, in the 1590s, weak government by successive Lord Deputies fuelled the ambition of the Earl of Tyrone and he launched a rebellion, Philip II was once more ready to assist. The English government was cornered into seeking the reduction of the military of the entire island. The reluctant conquest was achieved early in 1603. Elizabeth's problems with Ireland were at an end.\n\nDeath[]"
