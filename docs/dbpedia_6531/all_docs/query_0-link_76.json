        "text": "During the era of the 1500s, there may have been many queens that ruled many other countries, but one specific queen with stunning looks caught many people, especially men's, attention. She is sometimes called the Virgin Queen but is known as Queen Elizabeth l. She was known because of her father who is King Henry VIII and her sister Queen Mary who controlled England and Ireland, which lead the ruling of England to be passed over to Queen Elizabeth from then she was declared queen in the year 1558 at the age of 25. The only exacerbate of being Queen of England was they were at war with France. Once she became queen, the Act of Supremacy became law at the church of England and at that time the Act of Uniformity was also passed, which was the\n\nElizabeth I, was the queen of England 1558-1613, while she may have brought great success and stability to the government she was questioned in her ability to lead due to her gender. Gender became a critical part of her reign and was brought into question by numerous religious figures. Although most thought a woman was unfit to be a ruler, this did not stop Elizabeth from responding to the criticism with determination to making wise and selfless decisions that proved what a strong leader she was. This determination and leadership fueled the country with success.\n\nDuring the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I experienced a lot of oppression during her reign in England. Many religious figures opposed the idea of a female ruling a country, saying that it is against God’s will. Other citizens of the country, specifically personal associates of Elizabeth, however, stood behind the queen and admired her bravery, confidence and love for England. Elizabeth responded to the gender ideas in an authoritative way, She had to live with female stereotypes, and used it to her advantage when possible but she asserted that the stereotypes did not completely apply to her and that she was perfectly capable of ruling England.\n\nElizabeth I is now known as one of the greatest monarchs England ever had, but she faced many disagreements and challenges against her ability to properly control England during her reign because she was a woman. Those religious oppositions against her gender influenced her rule greatly, eventually leading to her regal and authoritative responses. The regal responses reassured the people of her ability to control England, while the authoritative responses reestablished the fact that she was to be the only supreme ruler in England and no one should be allowed to cross her or doubt her power.\n\nShe once said in a speech to English troops, “I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England, too.” Because Elizabeth knew what the common opinion of women was in the 16th and 17th centuries, she had to show that she was powerful, wise and as truly fit as any man to be the ruler of England. (Doc\n\nCatherine Bush is an author and by extension, a novelist who has an outstanding record of publishing books with interesting stories and real life experiences summarized in novelty. In 1985, she published a book that reviewed and brought back the reality the past life of England's Queen, Elizabrth1.In this book, Bush gets deeper in the life of England Monarchy Lady. She explores her inner life and personality. She goes overboard to narrate the Queen's relationship with her family, her subjects, and her state duties. Queen Elizabeth is one lucky woman who rose to Queenship at\n\nQueen Elizabeth I was a major political influence from her time and still influences our world today. Elizabeth I was born on September 7th, 1533 in Greenwich, England. She was the daughter of King Henry VIII, the half-sister of King Edward VI and Queen Mary I (Ellis 1). Elizabeth did not only rule the country she had accomplished many other tasks among her lifetime. She wrote her own poems (Women Writers Of Great Britain & Europe 1), she never relied on translators since she had mastered languages like Greek, Latin, French, and Italian when she was a student (Ellis 1). Queen Elizabeth’s greatest accomplishment was being an extraordinary ruler of England. Another massive accomplishment of hers was reestablishing England back to Protestantism. Queen Elizabeth I deserves to be in the History Hall of Fame because she was a successful, popular Queen of England, who reestablished Protestantism to England.\n\nHistorians have dedicated more biographies to Elizabeth I than any other of the Tudor monarchs. Elizabeth was the only daughter of Henry VIII and his second wife, Anne Boleyn. Books relating to aspects of Queen Elizabeth I 's life currently run into the hundreds. The time that a certain biography was written is an important factor to bear in mind when reading about this historical figure. Despite that historical facts are unchanging, the historian 's perspectives and interpretations, as well as their styles of reconstructing history often, change with time. This paper analyzes the interpretation of the events that surrounded the confinement of Elizabeth I in the Tower of London by her predecessor Mary I over religious differences.\n\nEven though she wasn’t able to adjust to everyone's needs, she had demonstrated a strong compassion towards their point of view. During a massive preparation for an attack, the queen delivered one of the most heartfelt speeches. \"I am come amongst you ... resolved in the midst and heat of battle, to live and die amongst you all.... I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king and of a King of England too.\".\n\nShe is the last Tudor monarch, and the only virgin queen in her bloodline. Elizabeth I of England was born on September 7, 1533 at Greenwich palace to Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII. After her sister, Mary I, died on November 17, 1558, Elizabeth came back from her arrest to claim the throne. She is known for being a cunning and shrewd survivalist. Since birth, her life has been about surviving all the odds against her. As she fights her way to the top, the economy, the country’s culture, science and technology, government, and communication will change all around her.\n\nThe success of Elizabeth’s reign was not dependent on her virginity but rather the manner in which the Virgin Queen utilised the available mechanisms to achieve immense advantages for her nation While Elizabeth certainly used her virginity and purity as a mechanism in empowering her reign, she may have had numerous reasons to avoid marriage, rather then an intentional political manoeuver. This apparent self-sacrificing nature demonstrates Elizabeth’s over-compensation for being a woman. Rather than be regarded as a feeble Monarch due to her gender, maintaining her status as the Virgin Queen ensured possession of one of the most powerful political mechanisms in England’s history. Far too much emphasis is placed on her virginity and failure to\n\nElizabeth was a different kind of Queen: quick-witted, clever and able to use feminine wiles to get her own way. Elizabeth could be as ruthless and calculating as any king before her but at the same time she was vain, sentimental and easily\n\nQueen Elizabeth I held the throne of England from the time of her sister Mary’s death in 1558 until her own death in 1603. As the second female ruler of England, she faced a patriarchal society ingrained with the notion that a woman’s (specifically a Queen’s) job was to serve her husband and produce heirs. As Queen, Elizabeth deserved the same respect afforded to her male predecessors, but social constrictions of the period forced her to face unjust oppression that would have been grounds for treason if faced by her father (or any other male monarch). Elizabeth faced a number of challenges as a female ruler, such as regularly being ignored by trusted advisors such as William Cecil (Lord Burghley), Robert Dudley (Earl of Leicester), Francis Walsingham, and Robert Devereux (Earl of Essex) of whom each was intent on his own agenda, and who believed they could bend Elizabeth to their wills. As a result of these challenges, Elizabeth had to fight for respect from enemies and friends alike.\n\nEvery nation has a particular figure who rules the country. Throughout the world, there have been a tremendous number of presidents, kings, and queens. They leave their own achievements either in the political or diplomatic area, which future generations, such as historians and the public, evaluate to determine whether the accomplishments are effective. Among all the British kings and queens, Queen Elizabeth I is regarded as the most influential queen, since she brought about a great change in her nation. Elizabeth paved the way for Britain becoming the British Empire through her resolutions of the conflicts of religion and military forces, spreading the trend of slavery and the use of English, which allowed the British Empire enjoy its governance in the world for decades."
