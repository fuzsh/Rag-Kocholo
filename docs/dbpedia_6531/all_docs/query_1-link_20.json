        "text": "When Queen Elizabeth died in September 2022, her eldest son and heir, the former Prince Charles, automatically became King Charles, and the line of succession shifted. In light of the news of the King's cancer diagnosis, many may be wondering about the current order of succession. While most people know that Charles's eldest son Prince William has taken up the mantle of first in line to the throne (as well as Prince of Wales), there are plenty of royal relatives whose positions aren't as well known.\n\nWondering where Princess Charlotte falls in the line of succession? What about Princess Anne? And how did the Sussexes' children impact the order? If you're curious to learn more about the hierarchy within the royal family, read on for the full line of succession from Prince William to George Windsor, the Earl of St Andrews."
