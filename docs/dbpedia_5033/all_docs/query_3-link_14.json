        "text": "1516 (circa)\n\nDante col sito et forma dell'Inferno\n\nPublished in Venice by Alessandro Paganini\n\n292 p. (3 illus. on 5 p. of plates) ; 11 cm. (sm. 8o)\n\nProfessor Giamatti note: Very rare illustrated edition, the first printed in the smallest pocket size & a typo-graphical marvel. The date is not present in the book but may be easily deduced: it belongs to the period before Paganini's move to Toscolano. In the dedication by Paganini to Giulio de' Medici the latter is styled Deacon of Santa Maria in Donico, which places it before Giulio's appointment to San Clemente in June 1517. More important, the edition of Petrarch's \"De remediis\" (dated 10 November 1515) is mentioned in the same preface as having just been completed; therefore this Dante may be dated early in 1516. The last three leaves contain a double-page & 3 full-page wood-cuts, all appearing here for the first time. The double-page cut is signed by the well known Venetian wood engraver I.A. (Giovan Andrea?). Copy from the collection of Baron Horace de Landau.\n\n1520\n\nOpere del divino poeta Danthe con suoi comenti\n\nCommentary by Christoforo Landino; edited by Pietro da Figino\n\nPublished in Venetia by Miser Bernadino stagnino da Trino de Monferra\n\n[12], 440 numb. leaves (1 plate ; 97 illus. in text) ; 22 cm. (8o)\n\nDated in colophon: xxviii. marzo. \"Recorrecti et con ogne diligentia novamente in littera cursiva impresse.\" In colophon: \"... & ha posto molte cose in diversi luoghi che ha truovato mancare si in lo texto come nella giosa etiam noviter per altri excellenti huomini.\"\n\nProfessor Giamatti note: Reprint of the reprint of 1512, except that the woodcut of Adam and Eve is repeated on the first pg. of the Inferno\n\nThe left-hand border has only 1 figure instead of the 2 in the 1512 ed.; the vignette on the t.p. is smaller and different; the ground has been removed, the monk faces right and there are 3 bishop's mitres. Plate: Inf. I.\n\n1520 (circa)\n\nDante col sito, et forma dell' inferno.\n\nPublished in Venice by Alessandro Paganino.\n\n[244] leaves., 4 leaves of plates (1 fold.) ; 11 cm.\n\nThis is Paganino's pirated reprint of the 2nd Aldine edition of 1515. It was completed sometime between 1515 and 1525. Plates: cut-away view of the levels of hell; schematic diagram of the grouping of the sins, each represented as a circle; schematic diagram of the loves from the Purgatorio, each represented as a circle.\n\nPurchase. Acquired after Professor Giamatti's death.\n\n1529\n\nComedia di Danthe Alighieri poeta divino\n\nCommentary by Christoforo Landino\n\nPublished in Venetia by Iacob del Burgofr‹co\n\n[12], ccxcv numb. leaves (1 plate : port.) ; 30 cm. (fol.)\n\nDated in colophon: xxiii di genaro. \"Novame[n]te impressa : e con somma dilige[n]tia revista & emẽdata : & di nuovissime postille adornata\". *The illustrations to the first canto of each cantica and the vignettes of each canto are the same as those of the March ed. of 1491. The t.p. verso has a full-page woodcut portrait of Dante; this is the first ed. to have a good representation of him.* The title is enclosed in an illustrated border, containing on the left portraits of Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Lucretius and Terence; on the right Dante, Petrarch, Pietro Aretino, Boccaccio and Unico Aretino; at the bottom the nine muses. The border also surrounds the illustration to the first canto of the Inferno except that here, instead of the moderns on the right, there are Cicero, Sallust, Livy, Valerius and Pliny.
