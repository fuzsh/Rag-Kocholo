He hasn’t got shit all over him.” It’s hard not to think of Holy Grail when watching Aleksei German’s farewell statement.

With Fellini and Antonioni reinventing themselves and Italian cinema from their neo-realist roots, the Gothic horrors of Bava and co. at their peak and enfants terribles like Pasolini and Bertolucci making a name for themselves, there were always going to be directors who fells through the cracks. One such director is surely Antonio Pietrangeli, a director sadly taken from us far too soon and perhaps best known for his 1960 Golden Lion nominee Adua e le Compagne, a decent film in its own right, but a precursor for things to come that few outside Italy would get chance to see. In a landscape of Italian film we think we know so well, it’s a film to make us adjust our preconceptions. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nby Allan Fish\n\n(France 1971 355m) not on DVD\n\nAka.

We have been there before; Edgar Reitz’s Heimat began the same way with a German soldier, but there the returnee was demobbed, the war was over and the series would become a chronicle of life for the next 60 years. La Maison des Bois takes place during and the immediate aftermath of World War I, but the difference is that Pialat, as one may expect from a director who had not long ago made L’Enfance Nue (whose young star Michel Terrazon reappears here),tells it from the point of view of a child. Not the French Heimat then, but more of a World War I variation of so many French stories of childhood or lost innocence over the course of a summer, only the summer here is rather several seasons reduced to one figurative one.

Goya’s ‘The Third of May 1808’. The title may not be familiar, but the painting will be. Is there a more potent depiction of the oppression of the working class than Goya’s masterpiece? It depicts the brave but failed resistance of Spanish rebels to Napoleon during the peninsular war. A group of peasants are placed against a wall while a firing squad prepares to give out improvised ‘justice’. Among the huddled few awaiting their fatal bullets, a man in a white shirt pleads with arms outstretched. It’s become an icon of resistance to tyranny everywhere. It’s also the painting that comes to mind whenever I think of Alessandro Blasetti’s 1860. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nby Allan Fish\n\n(Iceland 2002 86m) not on DVD\n\nAka. Last Stop\n\nTerminus\n\np Gerd Haag d/w Olafur Sveinsson ph Halldór Gunnarsson ed Olaf de Fleur Johannesson m Sigur Rós\n\nChildhood memories are always somewhat hazy with me, but one thing I remember is regular trips to Lancaster on the bus and, while the journey itself is depressing enough, taking over an hour to wind its way through all the places it can when a car would do the journey in twenty minutes, what lay at the end was more depressing; Lancaster bus station. I loved Lancaster itself; its old railway station, the castle then and now half converted into a prison, the little priory next door with its tiny café, the long since gone shops where I would pick up VHS tapes; Our Price and Andy’s Records. Against all that was a bus station on an island that felt marooned, a triangular shape with over-hanging flat roof, dilapidated offices which no-one seemed to occupy and foul-smelling toilets. The Sally Army probably never bothered to go there on their Christmas soup runs. After seeing Olafur Sveinsson’s truly heart-rending documentary, one can be sure such terminuses exist through the known world.

It was voted one of the ten greatest Indian films ever made by critics in 2007 and its viewpoint, that of a child’s view of adult hypocrisy and injustice, it a familiar one in the west. The reason for its neglect isn’t entirely clear, but language may have had something to do with it. While very much in the tradition of great Hindi humanist cinema, it isn’t actually a Hindi film. Kasaravalli’s film, and Kasaravalli himself, speak another language; Kannada. The only DVD of the film as yet released advertises the fact in typically intrusive Indian style in the form of a bright logo running through the top right of the screen and a Kannada text logo below it. Some sources have it running over half an hour longer than the running time of the DVD and quoted above; even now it seems elusive.

He’s come to be seen as much as personification of the zeitgeist as a director, indeed often setting the tempo for what would become the daily zeitgeist. One would think then that his work was easily accessible, preserved on DVD and now Blu Ray in the way that the work of, say, Hitchcock, Scorsese or Bergman is. Yet this is only partly true; the canonical Godard has always existed, but it generally covers his work up to 1967-68; the experimental films that followed in the subsequent decades have always been somewhat harder to track down. There are still a few I have been unable to see, and until recently one of them was France/Tour/Detour/Deux/Enfants. It only became so when an old Channel 4 TV recording surfaced.

Not a great film, but by a director with one in him, and Macario is that film. It’s not an easy film, however, in that it is in essence that most problematic of tales, a parable. It focuses around the Mexican ritual of Day of the Dead, that bizarre hybrid of Pagan and misdirected Christianity where the rich have their own place in the dead world and the poor theirs, totally belying the words of that pesky Christ; what’s he got to do with it, after all? Yet it’s a tale that could have been told by Christ at Cana just as easily as unfold as it does in colonial Mexico. (more…)\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nby Allan Fish\n\n(USSR 1968 72m) not on DVD\n\nAka.

And I use that term in a way not forgetting the original 27th and final book of the New Testament. Watching The Plea one feels that John the Evangelist was here, even Christ himself.\n\nThey weren’t the only ones, however. Nearly forty years earlier the great Russian director Mikhail Kalatozov came here, at 26, to make his first great film, the dramatized documentary on life in the Caucasian mountains, Salt for Svanetia. His film had depicted ancient stone towers, structures like sentinels from a distant past and how transport had finally connected Svanetia to the modern world. In The Plea, we’re back in time, but it’s not entirely certain how far. We’re told that the film is based on the poems of Vazha Pshavela, and as such we presume we’re around the turn of the 20th century. Yet in Pshavela’s work there’s a sense of something far more remote, as if he was merely a scribe taking down oral traditions going back centuries, after listening to storytellers in tents and caravans for countless hours.

Mer dare\n\na + b + c + ab = 0\n\nd/w/ed Artavazd Peleshian\n\nWhatever happened to montage, as many film students have asked? It became a noun is the simple answer, adapted outside of its meaning by Hollywood, no longer anything to do with the old film theory equations; where Pudovkin believed montage meant that one shot followed by another gave a combined meaning (a+b=ab), Eisenstein argued that instead the first two shots gave a third meaning (a+b=c). It all became literally academic, for these schools of montage gradually evaporated with the coming of sound.\n\nIt would be a director, appropriately from the old Soviet Union, who would sound the death knell for old school montage. Artavazd Peleshian is an elusive figure in every sense, who made just nine films in a 28 year career, with a care taken over each to rival Andrei Tarkovsky. The difference being all Peleshian’s films run to less running time combined than Andrei Rublev alone. Peleshian became known – where he is known, for in the west he’s still neglected – for inventing ‘distance montage’, an appropriately detaching methodology where montage was used to reduce meaning to nothing, where each individual shot meant nothing; the finished film was the meaning.
