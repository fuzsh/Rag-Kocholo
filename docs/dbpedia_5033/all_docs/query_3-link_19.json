        "text": "The story is the harried attempt of a Sicilian partisan, as part of the risorgimento, to reach Garibaldi's headquarters in Northern Italy, and to petition the revered revolutionary to rescue part of his besieged land. Along the way, the peasant hero encounters many colorful Italians, differing in class and age, and holding political opinions of every type. There is a key train scene, and the film ends on the battlefield, Italian unification a success, despite brutal losses.\n\nIn the huge steel factories in Terni (Umbria, Italy), two friends (Mario and Pietro) fight for the love of the same girl (Gina). Pietro dies because of a work accident at the factory. The other workers think Mario is responsible for the death of his friend. Mario, who is innocent, is forced to quit, but his love for Gina and his dedication to his job help him out of his crisis.\n\nNando Moriconi is a young Italian living in Rome. He is fond for everything coming from the United States. He tries to speak American-English, to wear clothes he thinks Americans wear, to walk like John Wayne, and to eat cornflakes with ketchup - His life is a parody of the real American way of life that he could not get. Nando's not-so-secret dream is to visit the USA, so he climbs up to the Coliseum and threats to commit suicide if the American Embassy does not give him the visa. But at this point Nando is very well known as a 'crazy-for-USA' boy and the troubles he provoked will not help him.\n\nAldo Piscitello, a minor government clerk, is forced in 1934 to join the Fascist party. When the war comes, he finds himself able only to talk ineffectually in secret against Mussolini, even as his own son Giovanni is sent into battle. By the end of the war, Aldo has found the courage to stand up for his beliefs, but by then it is too late.\n\nRosario Scimoni is twenty years old and lives in Catania at the beginning of this century. He loves two things in life: women and money and he is the secretary of the mayor who is his uncle, and the lover of the mayor's wife, but, unfortunately, he isn't paid for neither of his two jobs. When Rosario falls in love with Paola, partner af a socialist, he becames socialist and let the man of Paola go to jail to have her, but he has no success. When Mussolini and his fascists take the power, Rosario found himself fascist and he marries a women ugly but rich. He becames a gerarca (high fascist authority). When during World War II Sicily is invaded by the allied troops he camouflages himself as communist and at the end of the war he goes to Rome after losing all the money he had. In Rome Rosario changes again his skin and becames a Chistian Democrat after the Christian Democrat's victory in the elections of 1948. Trying to speculate on the land near Rome he ends in prison for five years and in 1953 Rosario closes his career dressed as a German selling faked German gadgets in the streets of Rome."
