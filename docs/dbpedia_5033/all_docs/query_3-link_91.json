She had been trapped under a building and her heart started beating badly and then I lost her too. There were four of us small children, the eldest was eleven, my elder brother. And he had to make lots of sacriﬁces because there was a regime that didn’t pay any welfare, so there we were in this borgata [new housing district], because they sent all poor people to these borgate, workers from the city center, because they had demolished all the poor people’s houses to make wide roads, things like that, and they exiled everyone to these conglomerations. Then gradually as we started growing up our culture was that of reading a lot of books that we passed around among us. The same book may have been read by as many as ten or ﬁfteen people to save money. Because there was no television. Then . . . we started working . . . and we had a little bit of money to go and have fun on Saturday or Sunday, so we went dancing. We came back . . . on foot from a long way away because we had no money left so we didn’t even take the tram. Then it was bad at work, because of the bosses . . . . The workers were not protected by a union, but then the workers started to win victories, things that raised our standard of living a bit, and we began buying a newspaper and doing cultural activities, sport.\n\nThe story continues for an hour of recording, forty pages of transcription. It is one of 117 life narratives that we collected from different people in various parts of Italy to ﬁnd out about their cultural consumption from the late 1930s to the early 1950s. During the ﬁrst stage of each interview, we began with a short explanation of our research. Then we asked all the interviewees to tell us about their life generally in these years. Some of them, like Fulvio M., pro-\n\nviii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nduced a narrative that ﬂowed almost imperceptibly into stories about cultural consumption and recreation. Others said less about these things, but their life stories gave us an outline that helped us, in a second stage of the interview, to intervene with more focused questions from a list we had prepared. People told us their memories of ﬁlmgoing—how often they went to the cinema, what they saw, where they sat, which actors they remembered. They recalled when and where they ﬁrst heard a radio and what they listened to. Those who read books or magazines talked about what they read and how they read: on their own, silently, or with someone reading out loud. Women told us where they got their ideas about fashion, when they ﬁrst wore new styles or put on makeup, and how their families reacted. Men and women both talked about how people behaved in dance halls. The stories we collected were very varied. Some interviewees gave detailed accounts of their consumption of a whole range of cultural products. Others were more reticent or they submerged their accounts of these things within the stories that they preferred to tell: of being evacuated during the war, deaths of parents or children, political activism, work or hardship. The oral history interviews were part of a research project called “Cultural Industries, Governments, and the Public in Italy, 1938–1954,” from which this book ultimately derives, and which has also yielded several interim publications. The project also involved interviews with individuals who had worked in publishing or the record business and visits to archives in Italy and the United States. The history of this project goes back a long way. The original research was funded in 1991–94 by a grant from the United Kingdom’s Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) to the University of Cambridge, where David Forgacs was then based. Stephen Gundle (then at University College, Oxford) was an equal partner in the project, and Dr. Marcella Filippa (University of Turin) coordinated the oral history interviews. After the end of the project’s grant period, we analyzed the interviews closely and did further research to ﬁll in gaps. The original project’s aims were to examine the relations between cultural production, consumption, and political power during the period from the late 1930s through the early 1950s; to collect a substantial body of new information about mass culture and Italian society in those years; and to use oral history to elicit evidence about cultural consumption. We deliberately chose a period that cut across the change of regime from Fascism to the Republic in order to test a hypothesis about continuity. It is generally agreed that the events of 1940–48—World War II, occupation and resistance, liberation, and the Constituent Assembly—split our period into two separate eras in political terms. Yet we wondered whether the operations of cultural ﬁrms—the types of prod-\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nix\n\nucts they sold, their approach to markets, their relations with governments— as well as popular cultural consumption might not be shown to have had substantial continuities over the whole period. We also wanted to understand the extent of continuity in the state and in the voluntary associations in civil society, including parish organizations and political parties, in their relations with mass culture. Our intention was not to adhere rigidly to the continuity hypothesis but to use it as a frame for inquiry and to remain open to evidence that might contradict or falsify it. We chose a start date in the late 1930s (we later moved it back to 1936 to encompass the creation of the Ministry of Popular Culture in 1937) because this was a time when the Fascist regime began to intervene in culture in a more directive way. It was also when modern cultural forms—glossy magazines, talking pictures, mass radio broadcasts—were starting to develop. We decided to set an end point in 1954, not only because this took us well into the Republic and the Cold War (it was when Alcide De Gasperi, political leader of the postwar period, died) but also because it was the year when a regular television service started and after which a new phase of mass culture, and of the Italian media system, began. The start and end dates, in other words, were signiﬁcant both politically and in the history of mass culture. One of the things that drew us to this research was dissatisfaction with existing work on the subject. Most of it described the period and its culture with concepts and paradigms that seemed to us inaccurate or simplistic and, when put together, did not ﬁt to make a coherent picture. On the one hand Fascism was presented as a “mass society,” with popular culture harnessed to the “organization of consent”; on the other hand, Italy in the 1930s and 40s was described as having “artisanal” culture industries, and Italian society in the 1950s was seen as living under a benighted clerico-conservative regime that retarded its cultural modernization. Many of these descriptions of mass culture and Italian society were made by historians whose main interests were in other areas, such as the political system or the economy, and who looked only casually and incidentally at culture. Those who did specialize in cultural history tended to focus largely on high culture and on intellectuals and to deal summarily with popular and mass culture—that is, with the cultural forms with which the majority of the population came into contact. We believed not only that these descriptions were reductive but that they were often based on careless generalizations and a lack of good evidence. What, after all, was actually known about “mass culture” at the level of individual cultural ﬁrms? What was known about the operations of different parts of the state in relation to mass culture: not just regarding censorship and propaganda but also in giving support to cultural industries, helping them export, protecting them from foreign competition? Above all, what was known\n\nx\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nabout consumers, popular taste, and everyday patterns of consumption? Had anyone actually asked people what music they listened to, what ﬁlms they saw, and what had stuck in their memory? We set out to address these questions and set up a project that would help us answer them. This project, as we said, goes back a long way. Fulvio M.’s life story was recorded on October 29, 1991, and the book was sent to the publisher in 2006. Fifteen years from the start of a project to publication of its ﬁndings is a long time, even by the standards of academic research. There are several reasons why it has taken so long. The main ones are that the project generated a very large amount of material, particularly in the form of interviews (over 200 hours of recordings, nearly 4,000 pages of transcripts), which required much time and patience to process; that the two authors had demanding university jobs and personal lives; and that we sometimes allowed other, shorter-term research commitments to jump ahead of this one. Both of us are used to working fairly quickly, and the longevity of this project has been a source of frustration for us as well as of humor and ironic, reciprocal banter. Clearly, there have been negative effects. A quarter of our interviewees were already over seventy-ﬁve years old when we recorded them, and many have since died. We greatly regret that we cannot show them how we have used their testimonies and thank them again directly for their help. Hearing these recordings or rereading the transcripts now has a particular poignancy for us. It at once evokes the memory of the live interview and resonates uncannily, like hearing the voice of a dead person left on an answering machine. And yet by leaving the interviews sealed up and publishing them only now, we found that we had unwittingly preserved their freshness. We hope that the passages we have quoted from the interviews will convey something of this quality to the reader and give them a sense of the living speaker. At the same time, the gap between initial research and publication has had a number of positive effects. Our judgments of the period, of the material we collected, and of our own earlier assumptions and methods have changed and matured over the years. We have beneﬁted from reading work published by others, as well as from rereading, criticizing, and rethinking our own earlier drafts. In all these respects, the book we offer here has beneﬁted from its long gestation. The book is divided, after the introduction, into three parts. Part 1, “Cultural Consumption and Everyday Life,” draws extensively on our oral history project, as well as on other sources, and attempts to tell the story of mass culture in the period “from below.” Part 2, “Cultural Industries and Markets,” draws, by contrast, mainly on the research we carried out on cultural ﬁrms, using archival and published sources, and it shows how the main cultural industries operated in relation both to markets and political forces over the period as a whole. Part 3, “Politics and Mass Culture,” looks at the world of mass\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nxi\n\nculture from the point of view of the state and of forces in civil society, and in the latter case (chapter 8) incorporates again some of the oral testimonies. The three parts represent three different perspectives on the same reality: the increasing diffusion of mass culture in a society in transition to economic, political, and bureaucratic modernity. The writing of the book has been very much a shared task. We designed the overall structure together and each of us read and commented at every stage on the other’s drafts and revisions. Chapters 2, 6, 7, and the conclusion were written by both authors. However, the introduction and chapters 1 and 3 were primarily the work of David Forgacs and chapters 4, 5, and 8 were written mainly by Stephen Gundle. Most of the material in the book is previously unpublished, with the exception of the section on Disney and Mondadori in chapter 3, which originally appeared in a longer version as part of David Forgacs, “Uomini e topi: la connessione Disney-Mondadori nella ricostruzione,” in Hollywood in Europa. Industria, politica, pubblico del cinema 1945–1960, ed. David W. Ellwood and Gian Piero Brunetta (Florence: Ponte alle Grazie, 1991), 172–85; and parts of chapter 5, which have appeared in Stephen Gundle, “Film Stars and Society in Fascist Italy,” in Re-viewing Fascism: Italian Cinema 1922– 43, ed. Piero Garofalo and Jacqueline Reich (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002), 315–39. Some of the general ﬁndings of Parts 2 and 3 of the book were summarized in David Forgacs, “Industria culturale, politica e pubblico in Italia, 1936–1954,” in Polis: Ricerche e Studi su Società e Politica in Italia 14, no. 2 (August 2000): 213–34; and his “How Exceptional Were Culture-State Relations in Twentieth-Century Italy?” in Culture, Censorship and the State in Twentieth-Century Italy, ed. Guido Bonsaver and Robert S. C. Gordon (Oxford: Legenda, 2005). Other publications by David Forgacs arising from the original research project are “Americanization: The Italian Case, 1938–1954,” in Americanization and the Transformation of World Cultures, ed. P. H. Melling and D. J. Roper (London: Edward Mellen, 1996), 81–96; “Postwar Italian Culture: Renewal or Legacy of the Past?” in Reconstructing the Past: Representations of the Fascist Era in Post-War European Culture, ed. Graham Bartram, Maurice Slawinski, and David Steel (Keele, UK: Keele University Press, 1996), 49–63; and “The Mass Media and the Question of a National Community in Italy,” in The Politics of Italian National Identity, ed. Gino Bedani and Bruce Haddock (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2000), 142–62. Some of the data in the tables were previously collected and elaborated by David Forgacs in his essay and statistical survey “Spettacolo: teatro e cinema,” in Guida all’Italia contemporanea, 1861–1997, Vol. 4, Comportamenti sociali e cultura, ed. Massimo Firpo, Pier Giorgio Zunino, and Nicola Tranfaglia (Milan: Garzanti, 1998), 203–94. Other publications by Stephen Gundle arising in part from the original project are “Feminine Beauty, National Identity and Political\n\nxii\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nConﬂict in Postwar Italy, 1945–54,” Contemporary European History 8, no. 3 (1999): 359–78; “L’età d’oro dello star system,” in Storia del cinema mondiale 2, tome 1, Gli Stati Uniti, ed.

Patrick McCarthy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), 183–96; “Visions of Prosperity: Consumerism and Popular Culture in Italy from the 1920s to the 1950s,” in Three Postwar Eras in Comparison: Western Europe 1918–1945– 1989, ed. Carl Levy and Mark Roseman (London: Palgrave, 2001), 151–72; also in an Italian version: “Immagini della prosperità,” in Il Pci nell’Italia repubblicana, ed. Roberto Gualtieri (Rome: Carocci, 2002), 253–84. We are grateful to the institutions that helped fund and support the research: the ESRC for the major grant that supported the ﬁeldwork and the other initial work in Italy and the United States, the University of Cambridge for giving a further two terms’ leave to David Forgacs, and University College, Oxford, for providing funding for Stephen Gundle to visit the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas in 1993. Stephen Gundle also wishes to express his gratitude to the British Academy for a small personal research award on “Cinema and Society in Italy, 1930–1960,” which allowed him to undertake supplementary library and archival work in Italy between 1997 and 2000. In a project as long and complex as this one we have accumulated many debts of thanks to individuals. First of all, we want to recognize the fundamental contribution of Marcella Filippa, who not only coordinated the oral history interviews and helped us devise the questionnaire but also conducted thirty-nine of the interviews herself, organized the work of transcription, and produced the ﬁrst analysis of the ﬁndings. Marcella’s professionalism, experience in oral history, and constructive suggestions and criticisms were invaluable assets at this stage of the research. Her presentation of the oral history project is included in the appendices at the end of this book. Marcella also carried out the initial research on the radio, music, and record industries and her thoughtful reﬂections on the oral testimonies inﬂuenced some of our observations in the introduction and in chapters 1 and 2. We are also very grateful to Paola Pallavicini, who carried out with great commitment and skill a further ﬁfty-three interviews, including all the ones in Calabria, Sardinia, and Trentino and some of those in Piedmont and Valle d’Aosta. We want to thank all those who gave us advice and critical feedback on the oral history project, or who acted as mediators to put us in touch with people to interview: Anna Anfossi, Manlio Brigaglia, Rosalba Dondeynaz, Mirella Grenzi, Paolo Jedlowski, Diego Leoni, Lucio Levrini, Albina Malerba, Luisa Mulas, Peppino Ortoleva, Giangiacomo Ortu, Luisa Passerini, Lidia Piccioni, Katia\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nxiii\n\nPizzi, Armando Pomatto, Alessandro Portelli, Renate Siebert, Fausto Viccaro, Gianni Vizio, Camillo Zadra, Katia Zumpano, and Antonella Zuncheddu. Lidia Sinchetto and Giuseppina Pertusio did the invaluable work of transcribing the interviews. The following helped us with access to archival material: Gianluigi Mariani, Franco Caldara, and Daniele Sironi at the Fondazione Arnoldo e Alberto Mondadori (Milan); Luisa Gandolﬁ at the historical archive of Bompiani (Milan); Angela Pecchio at the Archivio Einaudi (Turin); Vito Laterza and Tonina Sollecito at the Archivio Storico Laterza (Bari); Gabriella Di Cagno for the commercial records of Vallecchi (Calenzano); Gloria Manghetti and Margherita Ghilardi at the Archivio Contemporaneo Gabinetto Vieusseux (Florence); Marina Giannetto at the Archivio Centrale dello Stato (Rome); Maria Liberatrice Vicentini at the Archivio Storico Diplomatico of the Ministero degli Affari Esteri (Rome); Charles Bell at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas (Austin); Ned Comstock at the Cinema and Television Library of the University of Southern California (Los Angeles); and Kristine Krueger at the National Film Information Service at the American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Los Angeles). Gian Piero Brunetta, Barbara Corsi, David Ellwood, Alberto Farassino, Paul Ginsborg, Franco Minganti, Paul Swann, and Albertina Vittoria all offered helpful advice during the operational phase of this project. Denis Mack Smith kindly loaned Stephen Gundle many books from his personal library relating to the themes of the project. For help in locating photographic illustrations we should like to thank Lucio Levrini, Roberto Palmas, and Father Antonio Toso. We are grateful to Mauro Bianchi at the SIAE and to Gian Luca Corradi at the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence for their help in supplying data for some of the tables. Various individuals, some of whom, sadly, like those in our oral history project, are no longer alive, kindly gave us valuable interviews at the start of the project on their personal recollections of working for or in collaboration with various cultural ﬁrms in our period: Orlando Bernardi (Mondadori), Valentino Bompiani (Mondadori and Bompiani), Piero Bigongiari, Maria Luigia Guaita, Mario Luzi, Geno Pampaloni (Vallecchi), Giulio Bollati and Roberto Cerati (Einaudi), Roberto Bonchio (Editori Riuniti), Franco Crepax (VCM), and Alessandro Ferraù (Cinespettacolo). Stefano Guidi and Gilberto Tinacci Mannelli helped arrange the interviews on the history of Vallecchi. Franco Fortini, who died in 1994, and Giulio Einaudi, who died in 1999, were both invaluable mediators for the interviews at Einaudi. In the preparation of the book for publication we are grateful to the two anonymous readers for Indiana University Press who reviewed the manuscript\n\nxiv\n\nPreface and Acknowledgments\n\nand offered support and constructive suggestions for revision; to our editors at the Press, Michael Lundell and Jane Behnken; to our copy editor, Karen Kodner; and to Eleanor Chiari for her help with revision and checking of bibliographical references. David Forgacs would like to thank Rachele Tardi for her valuable help in the last stages of preparation of the text for publication.

It has two main aims. The ﬁrst is to show that this period, often seen both by historians and in popular representations as a sort of primitive forerunner of the era of mass culture that would erupt in the 1960s, was in fact itself a decisive stage in the slow gestation of that era. The second aim is to describe the relationships in this period between mass culture, political power, and collective behavior and to propose a different account of them from those that have prevailed up to now. The most common way of expressing these relationships has been functionalist or instrumental. Mass culture and the media have been seen primarily as tools to shape public opinion and\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\npromote consent, ﬁrst in the Fascist regime, then under the Christian Democrat governments of the Cold War, while mass leisure has been seen as serving in the long run to integrate people into a more consumerist way of life. This view has had a strong grip on both popular and elite attitudes to the media in Italy, not only because of the well-known involvement of successive governments, parties, and individual politicians in the press and broadcasting but also because of an established tradition of media studies that has given prominence to such political interferences. The recent intertwining of political power, media ownership, and control in the election campaigns and governments led by Silvio Berlusconi in 1994 and 2001–2006 has led some commentators to interpret this as simply the latest and most extreme phase of a process rooted way back in the past. There is also a widely shared view, sometimes stated overtly, sometimes just implied, that with the development of mass culture and high levels of consumption, as living standards rose and class antagonisms were attenuated, people became more complacent and passive. In contrast with these views, we show in this book that mass culture had other social functions and effects than those of political integration from above or the encouragement of apathy and passivity. In particular, mass culture set in motion two processes that worked in opposing directions during the period under analysis. First, certain media and media products—radio programs, recorded music, cinema newsreels, magazine photographs—helped make Italian society more visible and audible to its own members. This process was accompanied by a wider public perception of national politics and an increased participation in national occasions such as sporting events or song festivals. Second, the media and mass culture put in circulation words, sounds, and images from other societies and these fueled private aspirations and desires, changed perceptions of what were deemed acceptable sexual behavior and gender roles, and drove a wedge between generations, helping to create new social demarcations. In other words, mass culture functioned “disintegratively” as well as “integratively.” This limited its efﬁcacy as an instrument of political consensus-formation and also meant that its social function was not always conservative. As we argue, this has signiﬁcant implications for our understanding both of this period of Italian history and of the way modern mass culture interacts with political power more generally. For one thing it means that a view that has recently enjoyed a resurgence among some historians should be treated with caution: according to this view, the Fascist regime effectively shaped the mentality of the Italian people, or at the very least bound them into a transient emotional complicity, by creating a “lay religion” or, in its mass rallies, a “rite of communion.”1 Even in its most interventionist and repressive phase (exam-\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nined in chapter 7 on the state), which lasted from the setting up of the Ministry of Popular Culture in 1937 to Mussolini’s expulsion from ofﬁce in July 1943, Fascist cultural policy always operated in an arena where other powerful forces were in play. These included, in the ﬁrst place, the cultural industries— book and magazine publishing, ﬁlm production and distribution, radio, the music business—and the commercial groups involved in them; and, in the second place, consumers themselves, who exercised their choices of cultural goods and activities increasingly through the market. Sometimes the interests of these groups converged with those of the Fascist elites, at other times they conﬂicted. The result was a complex web of negotiations, concessions, and compromises, as well as various, often tacit, forms of opposition, noncompliance, and resistance. The same applies to the postwar years, when the Christian Democrats, after their decisive electoral victory of April 1948, controlled all government posts and, from the early 1950s, began to extend their capillary inﬂuence in society. Here too the attempts by a political elite to impose a clear moral and political direction on cultural activities such as the cinema and the periodical press had to accommodate and eventually succumb to the power of the cultural industries and the rapidly evolving tastes of consumers, not to mention the political pragmatism of some of the Christian Democrat leaders themselves. As for people’s attitudes to mass cultural products and collective rituals in this period, one should be wary of generalizing about them without ﬁrst examining the available evidence. This evidence is by no means easy to collect and, once collected, to interpret. In particular one needs to avoid the methodological fallacy, particularly common in work on totalitarian and authoritarian states, of reading off the assumed effects of a ritual from the intentions of its organizers. We discuss this fallacy and the arguments against it in chapter 7. What applies to governments and the state applies also to forces in civil society. The period covered by this book was one in which strong collective movements sought to direct the activities of large numbers of people outside the home and the workplace. The three most signiﬁcant of these, in size and range of operations, were the mass-membership organizations of the Fascist Party, those of the Catholic movement, and, from the end of the war, those of the Italian Communist Party. The Catholic and Communist organizations both had their high points in terms of numbers of members in the 1950s. Yet, as we show in chapter 8, the forms of collective cultural activity, known in Italian as associazionismo, promoted by all these movements operated in a situation where the market was coming increasingly to deliver cultural goods and recreational services. The social movements too therefore had to organize themselves in relation to commercial mass culture and, in some cases, to compromise or modify their goals accordingly. The same general point may\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nbe made, therefore, about the Fascist regime, the postwar governments of the Christian Democrats, and the organized social and political movements, namely that their attempts to manage cultural life, to give it a national shape, a moral dimension, or a collective ethos, did have an impact, and this impact was sometimes signiﬁcant, but it could also be cushioned or even counteracted by the workings of mass culture itself. An Italian popular culture did develop, as we demonstrate, but by and large it was the product not of autarkic protectionism, pastoral nurturing, or grassroots political activism but of a series of ﬂows and exchanges of cultural goods between regions of Italy and between Italy and other countries. It follows from this that certain conventional periodizations need to be reassessed. In the ﬁrst place, the division that political historians of Italy normally make of the twentieth century into three distinct phases, marked by the prevailing type of state—Liberal up to 1922, Fascist to 1943 and (after the transitional period of the war years), Republic from 1946—does not really work for cultural history, and certainly not for the history of mass and popular culture. This is not only because there were signiﬁcant continuities in the ownership, structure, and personnel of key cultural industries (see chapters 3–6) and in the forms of state regulation (chapter 7), from censorship to the broadcasting monopoly and the government subsidy of theater and cinema, but also because patterns of consumer behavior carried over from one political phase to the next (chapter 1). We do not seek to minimize the important differences that did exist between these phases, and we give them due weight in the discussion. In particular we stress that the political events that bisect our period—the collapse and defeat of Fascism, World War II, and the Resistance—brought some decisive cultural changes and, in particular, led to greater pluralism in the forms of commercial mass culture. However, we argue that, on balance, the continuities were more signiﬁcant than the changes. In the second place, as we stated at the beginning, we want to modify the commonly held view that the economic miracle (1958–1963) was a unique “great transformation” that served to divide an old, “traditional” or peasant society of low consumption from a “modern” society of mass consumption. When one examines consumption patterns more closely this view can be seen to distort the facts in two opposing directions. On the one hand it exaggerates the extent of the changes that took place in the miracle period itself, generalizing to society as a whole levels and patterns of consumption that before the 1970s were limited to particular social groups and regions; on the other, it represents Italian rural society up to the late 1950s as too uniformly “backward” and static and underestimates the extent to which cultural modernization had already begun to affect people outside the main cities. In the light of these objections, the period from 1936 to 1954 needs to be seen afresh as part\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nof a longer wave of cultural modernization. We develop this point in more detail in chapter 1. Mobility and Sense of Place One way in which cultural impacts may be expressed is in terms of a changing geography of consumption. This involves movements both of cultural products to consumers and of consumers from one place to another, where they encounter new cultural products and associated forms of behavior. The way the movement of products affects consumption is fairly easy to demonstrate, and cinema may be used as an example for which readily available statistics allow a rough map to be drawn. The cinema was the most popular site of mass entertainment throughout our period. We know, according to the data collected by the Società Italiana Autori e Editori (SIAE), that sales of cinema tickets accounted in 1936 for 65 percent of total expenditure in Italy on paid entertainments. The proportion rose in the war years to a range of 74 to 76 percent and remained at around 70 percent in the early 1950s (Table 0.1). The SIAE’s ﬁgures also give us a geographical proﬁle of the audience. In 1951, 76 percent of tickets were sold in the North and Center and 24 percent in the mainland South and Islands (Sicily and Sardinia).2 Up to the late 1940s around twothirds of spectators were in cities and larger provincial towns and only a third were in small towns or villages, whereas after the war these proportions began to change (see Table 1.2, chapter 1). From the end of the 1950s to the early 1980s, as television took off in the cities, there were more ﬁlm spectators outside main towns than in them. From other sources we know that foreign ﬁlms made up the majority of those screened throughout our period (see Table 4.1, chapter 4). Most of the ﬁlms released in Italy up till 1939, when the Monopoly Law (discussed in chapters 5 and 7) came into force, and again after 1945, when it was rescinded, were American, and in between these dates, although many more Italian ﬁlms were made and released, French and British ﬁlms, as well as German, Austrian, and Hungarian ﬁlms were partially substituted for the absent American imports (Table 4.2, chapter 4). Put together, these sets of data allow us to plot, somewhat crudely, the ﬂow of imported ﬁlms into Italy and the size of the audience in different areas; and they serve as a baseline, but no more than that, for a subsequent analysis of the reactions of critics and audiences. As for the movement of people, the way this involves changes in cultural consumption is less obvious and requires a more detailed explanation. Movement, in cultural terms, involves both increased mobility in physical space and, to use Joshua Meyrowitz’s expression, changes in one’s imagined “sense of place,” that is, one’s perception of where one is located socially in relation\n\n76.00 74.26 71.93 80.73 66.34 60.31 74.40 40.81 22.83 34.12 49.15 55.27 72.45 82.15 106.13 101.18 109.45 115.72 114.60\n\n13.50 12.10 11.34 12.69 11.45 9.96 10.31 9.79 14.89 12.84 10.10 8.53 7.79 7.26 7.85 7.23 7.20 6.91 6.33\n\n% 363.41 396.85 411.81 401.29 390.47 449.87 544.97 318.19 106.89 192.78 350.10 450.99 625.56 783.21 927.87 976.42 1,070.59 1,186.07 1,285.41\n\nAmount\n\n% 64.56 64.66 64.61 63.08 67.41 74.27 75.48 76.37 69.72 72.55 71.92 69.62 67.26 69.25 68.62 69.74 70.38 70.82 71.06\n\nCinema\n\n21.60 23.44 25.72 27.60 24.02 18.39 23.07 12.00 3.99 11.87 32.86 48.66 69.00 78.87 86.30 86.49 84.33 92.49 96.69\n\nAmount 3.84 3.82 4.03 4.34 4.15 3.04 3.20 2.88 2.60 4.47 6.75 7.51 7.42 6.97 6.38 6.18 5.54 5.52 5.34\n\n%\n\nSpectator Sports\n\n57.56 70.75 73.55 65.58 37.02 13.72 18.13 9.95 12.29 19.28 35.67 62.47 84.23 96.49 120.16 116.20 124.81 133.49 142.99\n\nAmount\n\n% 10.22 11.53 11.54 10.31 6.39 2.26 2.51 2.39 8.02 7.25 7.33 9.64 9.06 8.53 8.89 8.30 8.21 7.97 7.91\n\nVarious*\n\n44.34 48.43 54.39 60.93 61.41 63.44 61.39 35.71 7.31 7.67 19.02 30.42 78.80 90.38 111.82 119.71 131.87 146.94 169.21\n\nAmount\n\n% 7.88 7.89 8.53 9.58 10.60 10.47 8.50 8.57 4.77 2.89 3.91 4.70 8.47 7.99 8.27 8.55 8.67 8.78 9.36\n\nRadio†\n\n562.91 613.73 637.40 636.13 579.26 605.73 721.96 416.66 153.31 265.72 486.80 647.81 930.04 1,131.10 1,352.28 1,400.00 1,521.05 1,674.71 1,808.90\n\nTotal\n\n* Includes dance halls, fairs, amusement parks, circuses, exhibitions, and open-air events. † Radio license fees.

The great ﬂows of migration out of poor rural areas of Italy, which began in the 1880s, both to other parts of the country and abroad, brought some striking new forms of cultural exchange. The “Americans” in Luigi Capuana’s Gli americani di Ràbbato (1912), a book written for children, were emigrants and returnees from the United States who settled back in their Sicilian community of origin with their accumulated savings, gold teeth, and tales ﬁrst of fabulous prosperity and then also of hostility and maltreatment, for instance in labor gangs. Emigration and return had changed irrevocably their perceptions of themselves and others around them. Although migration abroad was slowed down considerably during the Fascist period, internal migrations continued and even increased, despite the existence of penal sanctions against those who changed their place of residence without permission.4 There were also ﬂows of skilled labor, particularly of public employees and the professions, toward major centers of tertiary employment like Rome. For many of those who did not move permanently, there was an enhanced possibility of temporary movements to and from home because of the development of public and private transport, and an opening up to other parts of society through such “virtual windows” as the magazine photograph, the radio, and the cinema screen, which, taken together, produced a great increase in what John B. Thompson has called “mediated visibility.”5 All these movements, both physical and virtual, brought increased cultural exchange between different parts of Italy and with other countries beyond its borders and a partial erosion of cultural differences between regions and between localities. The single most signiﬁcant index of this internal cultural exchange over the long term was the decline in the use of dialects and the development of varieties of spoken Italian as a language of everyday use. Similarly, the absorption of loan words into Italian, mainly from English and French, provided a record of cultural ﬂows from outside Italy’s borders. These exchanges, and the changes in a perceived sense of place that they helped bring about, were to be highly signiﬁcant. They served, for many people, particularly working-class people and peasants whose physical mobility was often limited, to redeﬁne their sense of community by breaking down boundaries and enlarging their purviews in both a physical and a mental sense. The traditional boundaries of the local community were, for city dwellers, those between districts (quartieri) and, for the inhabitants of smaller towns and villages, the edges of the town or village: the latter were sometimes physically marked out by perimeter walls or by being located on a hilltop. For many\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\npeople these boundaries functioned as real physical barriers, particularly in the prewar years, not only because poverty effectively limited their movement beyond them but also because to step outside them was to go into territory where they were not known and might not be accepted. The war itself both hardened and relaxed these boundaries: freedom to move was restricted in cities by curfews and, after September 1943, by military occupations and tighter policing; on the other hand, as a result of bombings and the severe economic crisis there were movements of people both out of cities as evacuees and into them in search of work. As a result, the war features in many urban life stories as a watershed between a less mobile and a more mobile world. Arnaldo B., born in 1928, was one of the 117 people we interviewed in researching the ﬁrst part of this book in order to help reconstruct a picture of cultural consumption in Italy in the period 1936–1954. He grew up in San Lorenzo, a district of about three square kilometers just outside the ancient city walls of Rome, which had ﬁrst been developed and settled in the late 1870s, and which is conventionally described as physically enclosed on three of its four sides: the Labican walls (part of the old Roman walls built under the Emperor Aurelian); the railway line and rail yard (scalo merci) of Roma Termini (the main link between San Lorenzo and the Esquilino district on the other side of the railway lines was and is the tunnel under them known as the arco di Santa Bibiana); and the Cimitero del Verano.6 The northwest boundary was more indeterminate, but for inhabitants of the district it either coincided with the Via Tiburtina or extended no more than a few blocks beyond it. In her book on San Lorenzo in the Fascist period, historian Lidia Piccioni claims that its quadrilateral shape “on the one hand physically isolates the district from the rest of the city, making it a veritable village [paese] within Rome, and on the other deﬁnes the environment in which the residents will conduct their economic activity.”7 Most of the inhabitants were locally employed: Arnaldo B. eventually took over his father’s trade as a barber; many other people worked in the goods yard or in the artisan trades, such as stonecutting or carving, linked to the cemetery. One of the centers of social life in the quartiere was a few yards from Arnaldo’s home: the Cinema Palazzo in Piazza dei Sanniti, a third-run (terza visione) movie theater with avanspettacolo (a live stage show between screenings), which had opened in 1929. Beyond the Santa Bibiana tunnel were other cinemas and theaters: the Ambra Jovinelli, the Politeama Margherita, and the Brancaccio, but Arnaldo never went to these. As a boy he and his friends played a game in the street where they marked imaginary cities on the ground with chalk and pretended to race from one to the other, “like they do in the Giro d’Italia [bicycle race].” However, “if we went beyond the Santa Bibiana tunnel it was an adventure because it seemed to be a different city from the one we were used to in San Lorenzo”\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\n(19: 2–3).8 “I once tried to cross beyond the Santa Bibiana tunnel, I got as far as Piazza Vittorio [about a kilometer away]; when I got there I had to stop a Fascist patrol and get them to bring me home because I had got lost” (19: 17). He did not go to the city center, about three kilometers away, until after the war. I only saw Rome afterwards. It was an adventure; it was impossible to go there because who would bring you home again? . . . I once got on the number 10 [tram], which went down Via Tiburtina. I took this tram, I did the whole route because they told me this tram did a round trip and came back to the same place. I got on, paid the fare and did the whole route: Piazza Indipendenza, I saw the station, which seemed like a big adventure, as if I was dreaming America. . . . I did this trip and when I couldn’t tell where the tram was going and couldn’t remember where I had got on. I started to get worried and said to myself, “Now who’s going to take me home?” (19: 17–18)\n\nThe testimony of Clorinda is equally striking. Born in 1923 in Providence, Rhode Island—her father was an emigrant worker and an antifascist—she returned from America with her family when she was six, got married in 1942, and settled in San Lorenzo. In the Allied bombing of July 19, 1943 her house was destroyed and her husband was killed. She remained with a newborn baby. She described her life then and subsequently as being bounded within the quartiere: “Even today when I go to the city center I ask the bus driver. ‘I have to go to San Silvestro: can you tell me when I need to get off ?’ You can just imagine what it was like then” (66: 6). The ﬁrst time she went to the center was after the war: I went to the center to Via Veneto and it made me so angry to go there, I’m telling you the truth, because I saw all those bars, with all those tables outside, with all these people without a care in the world smoking, drinking, and all that, and there I was wearing clogs because I didn’t have anything, no house, nothing, and like I said I was walking there, I was still very young, nineteen or just over, and I saw all these carefree people at the bar, whereas we had a load of worries inside us. (66: 7)\n\nThese descriptions may have become somewhat exaggerated in memory and in the retelling, and the perceived boundaries may consequently be overdramatized. We know, for instance, that San Lorenzo during the Fascist period took in new residents from outside—white-collar workers on ﬁxed incomes and migrant workers from the South—so the community was modiﬁed by contact with others.9 Even so, the way people represent these boundaries in their retrospective accounts shows how large they loom in their subjectivity as symbolic markers of the difference between “then” and “now.” It is the difference that recurs most frequently in all the life stories we collected: it emerges,\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nunbidden, again and again when people recount their lives in terms of cultural activities involving “going out” (uscire) and “having fun” (divertirsi). One of the principal ways in which many people represent the temporal difference between then and now is in terms of this difference in spatial mobility and movement: then there was a world that was much less physically mobile; now space is more permeable; people are more mobile. This difference, moreover, repeatedly becomes correlated with others: between, on the one hand, a world where, particularly for girls and young women, one was much more under the surveillance of one’s parents, where certain places were out of bounds, where certain activities, like dancing, were only permitted if one was chaperoned; and, on the other hand, a world where there is a lot of freedom (frequently expressed in old people’s testimonies as “too much freedom”), more familiarity, more conﬂict between generations, less respect for old people. Other sources present a similar picture. Vasco Pratolini’s novel, Il Quartiere, written in 1943 and ﬁrst published in 1945, is set in the Santa Croce district of Florence, where the author was born and grew up in a working-class family. The novel follows a group of neighborhood friends through their adolescence from 1932 to 1936 and is particularly attentive both to the symbolic meanings of place and to the way the characters’ perceptions of place change over time. It starts by mapping out the limits of the district, which coincide with boundaries of class. The district extends east from the edge of the historic city center to Via Aretina, “the ﬁrst middle-class houses and the villas,” where the suburbs begin; south to the Arno; and north toward Piazza San Marco and the University: “But over here it was already a place for the rich people . . . deserted by the common people.” The inhabitants of Santa Croce have a clear sense of their separateness not only from the center of Florence and the bourgeois districts and suburbs but also from the other working-class areas: The city was on the other side of our republic, for us it was both like an archaeological site and an Eldorado: in order to take part in it we had to have a shave and wear our best clothes. We were divided from the other working-class districts by an imprecise but vivid sense of rivalry and emulation; as soon as we got together we split up again, ﬁghting, by the Arno in the summer, football games on Sundays, the stage of the Giro d’Italia.10\n\nToward the end of the book, however, the young people’s mobility beyond the district increases (some of them are called up to ﬁght in the Abyssinian War; others move away) and some of the old boundaries and landmarks are broken up by a demolition and rebuilding program (risanamento). If boundaries within cities became more permeable after World War II, the same is true for boundaries in rural areas, though the timing and the rate\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nof change differed from place to place, depending on such variables as when public roads were asphalted, when a bus service began, how much contact there was with neighboring towns. In all cases, the “isolation” of a village was never absolute; it varied according to the amount of contact that the village, and different individuals within it, had with a wider world. The village of Burcei in Sardinia, for example, is on a hilltop 680 meters above sea level and thirty-eight kilometers from the coastal city and regional capital, Cagliari. Before mass motorization in the 1960s there were various ways in which one could get from Burcei to Cagliari and back: on foot, by bicycle (44: 25), on horseback (43: 16), by oxcart (carro buoi), by pony trap (carretto col cavallino), or by bus (corriera), which cost 10 lire, the equivalent of a day’s agricultural wages. For some villagers Cagliari was, and still is, “another world.” Desiderio P., born in 1926, described his ﬁrst visit to Cagliari by bus: I must have been about seven or eight, I had never been on a bus before, so for me this . . . was wonderful. I hoped the bus would never stop so that I could see the view, see all these things. I almost didn’t get off, I didn’t want to get off, arrive, it was like discovering another world. Perhaps for me it was like when the astronauts arrived on the moon. (42: 8)\n\nDespite this perceived distance, there were various forms of contact and exchange both between Burcei and Cagliari and with nearby villages, such as Quartu. The teachers in the village school came from the city, rented houses, and resided in Burcei for nine months of the year; they are remembered as having introduced the villagers to Italian dances (balli all’italiana) where previously they had known only the Sardinian ones. During the war, evacuees (sfollati) from Cagliari became temporary residents and they too brought “city ways.” In the 1960s, ﬁnally, major changes were effected by emigration. As Igino Q. put it: We were still closed in this circle; then the villagers started to leave in the 1960s when there was the building boom in Milan, in northern Italy, and there was a total evacuation again. . . . In the 60s I got married and eventually I decided to leave too. I had a brother who lived in Italy [in continente, that is, on the Italian mainland] and who is still there and he was always saying to me: “Come here where it’s different.” Then, after the 60s, in the 70s there was the building boom in Cagliari, the tourist boom, and people left, but then they came back again. (43: 13)\n\nAs with the inhabitants of San Lorenzo in Rome and Santa Croce in Florence, we can establish a correlation from many of these testimonies between on the one hand increased mobility and exchanges with the world outside and on the other cultural changes within the community itself. As in\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nother villages, the possibilities and patterns of movement inside Burcei were strongly sex-differentiated. On Sundays, for instance, girls would stand in the doorways of their houses; when they walked “out” it was to go to the morning and evening services in the church; boys and men could move around from door to door to court the girls (44: 5). For dances, girls and women dressed in traditional costume: a pleated and brocaded skirt, blouse, and shawl. It was not permitted for them to ask boys directly to dance: this had to be done through a brother or a male cousin (44: 6). Adelia Q. (born 1924) remembers the cultural differences in the small town of Rossano, in the province of Cosenza in Calabria, when she moved there from Naples as a child with her mother, her elder sister, and her two brothers in the 1930s. Her father, who had been born in Trento in the North , had taken a job as an accountant in Rossano with the Meridionale electric company and after a year he had persuaded his wife, who was reluctant to move, to join him there with the children. At ﬁrst we really suffered from the mentality there, because although Naples may be a southern city it is still a city. This was a small village, in those days it had less than 20,000 inhabitants, so you had all the prejudices of Calabria: “You don’t do this, you don’t say that, you can’t go out with open shoes because you look like a dancing girl, you can’t go to the bar because it’s shameful.” Nowadays it seems absurd because Calabria has developed, but in those days it was like that, so we had a very hard time, me in particular since I was always a very free spirit and because I worked hard at school. I was someone who liked schoolwork, because in a village where there was nothing it was the only entertainment, the only occupation. (57: 2–3)\n\nAll these rules began to be modiﬁed after the war, in Rossano, Burcei, and elsewhere: girls could go out in a passeggiata (the walk, formerly restricted to men, in public spaces); they could go to bars; they could initiate conversation with boys rather than wait to be addressed. A research project based on 400 interviews carried out by three sociologists in 1957 in the Sicilian town of Ragusa found the older generation repeatedly reporting and evaluating similar changes and in some cases linking them in part to the inﬂuence of mass culture: Moralistic expressions are commonly used in judging the present situation: the inhabitants often remark that Ragusa has become, as far as free time is concerned, an immoral and corrupt town: “people have more vices,” “young people have more vices,” “there is immorality and corruption,” “there is more freedom and corruption in the way young people enjoy themselves.” By contrast, “customs were more rigid in the past,” “women and young people did not have so much freedom.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nAccording to a priest, however, one notices a greater “openness,” rather than “corruption,” particularly in young people. At the same time, he considers school to be a negative inﬂuence, because of the “mixing of the sexes it permits,” as well as the free time activities of cinema and reading. However, the Church can do little, he said, to “heal” the situation, since it is unable to draw young people to its organizations with attractive free time sporting and cultural activities. A housewife admitted that there had been a change in customs among students: “now they address each other as ‘tu’ [that is, in the intimate form] and stop and talk if they meet.”11\n\nOne of the main vehicles for the enhancement of individual mobility in our period was the bicycle, which saw its apotheosis, both as a form of mass transport and as the object of the most popular summer spectator sport, in the late 1940s and early 1950s. When it was ﬁrst introduced in Italy in the late nineteenth century, the bicycle had been a bourgeois status symbol. The ﬁrst Italian manufacturer, Bianchi, was founded in Milan in 1885. In 1897 the Touring Club Ciclistico Italiano (founded, also in Milan, in 1894) campaigned successfully for a reduction of the tax on bicycles brought in by a government that had dismissed them as toys for the rich.12 A contemporary journalist, Paolo Mantegazza, described the bicycle as the “triumph of human thought over material inertia. Two wheels that hardly touch the ground and can seem like wings . . . a miracle of balance, simplicity, lightness. A maximum of power and a minimum of friction, a prodigy of speed and elegance.”13 The club dropped the term “Ciclistico” in 1900 to become the Touring Club Italiano, perhaps because the bicycle was coming to be outstripped as a symbol of modernity by the automobile, famously celebrated by Marinetti in the founding text of Futurism in 1909.14 It was at the turn of the century, too, that the bicycle began to be taken up by the Catholic and socialist movements, both of which founded cycling clubs that hired out bicycles to their working-class members. Thus the bicycle developed, through a social trickle-down process, into a mass means of transportation.15 The car, on the other hand, remained restricted to the rich until the 1950s. The seventh edition of Panzini’s Dizionario moderno, published in 1942, recorded “macchina” as a standard antonomasia for bicycle; it was not till the 1960s that the term became widely used for the automobile. By 1947 there were 3.5 million bicycles on the roads, compared to 184,000 cars.16 A new bicycle cost upward of 20,000 lire, though there was also a vast secondhand market, whereas the cheapest car, the Fiat Topolino 500B, launched in 1948, when the average wage was 139,000 lire, cost 650,000.17 Bruno Roghi, cycling correspondent of the Gazzetta dello Sport, described the bicycle in 1946 as “the inseparable com-\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nFigure 1. A group of friends gather to organize a Sunday bicycle outing in the village of Canolo, near Correggio (Reggio Emilia), early 1950s. Photo by permission of Egeo Ferretti.\n\npanion of the peasant, the worker, the professional, the clerk, the student, the housewife and our rosy-cheeked girls . . . the ambassador of Italian labour, in the streets, regions, cities, small towns, mountains and valleys.”18 The bicycle was never quite as ubiquitous as this suggests. In poor rural areas, bicycles were still a relative rarity until the economic miracle and were then rapidly superseded by mopeds (motorini), scooters, and small cars. In Burcei, Michele Z., born in 1922, married in 1952, was one of the few inhabitants to own a bicycle in the early 1950s. It was useful for his work as an itinerant laborer but also fashionable and a local status symbol: I took my wife around by bicycle. We were pretty much unique as a couple with a bicycle, because there weren’t any others. We were in Burcei before and at that time I even made some money with the bicycle. How? By teaching friends to balance on the bicycle because they didn’t know how. (45: 15)\n\nIn the cities, however, bicycles had become affordable and commonplace long before. The cohort of male interviewees in Maurizio Gribaudi’s research into working-class communities in Turin recollected that in 1924, when they were\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nﬁfteen and sixteen, they all had bicycles. They would meet during their lunch hour, play a scratch game of football in Piazza Marmolada, then, when the siren went off at ten minutes to two o’clock, they would rush off on their bicycles to their different places of work.19 Among the most potent sets of images relating to the bicycle during our period is the sequence in the 1948 ﬁlm Ladri di biciclette (The Bicycle Thief ), directed by Vittorio De Sica, where Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) and his son Bruno (Enzo Staiola), helped by Ricci’s Communist friend, scour the market in Piazza Vittorio in Rome looking for Ricci’s stolen bicycle, which they suspect may have been broken up or repainted. Row upon row of bicycles are on sale, as well as endless spare parts—frames, handlebars, sprockets, chains, brake levers and cables, bells—but none of them is the right one. Bicycles are everywhere but Ricci cannot have any of them. This image of lack in the midst of plenty is repeated at the end of the ﬁlm outside the Stadio Flaminio where a football match is taking place between Roma and Modena. Again there is a mass of bicycles, both those belonging to the spectators inside the stadium and those of the racing cyclists who ﬂash past Ricci as he sits with his face in his hands on the pavement, and again he is not allowed to have. Various meanings are condensed together into the bicycle as the object of Ricci’s quest and desire: utility (a necessary tool of the trade for his job as a billposter), recreation and pleasure (he gives his wife a ride home from the pawnbroker’s on the crossbar), and sporting prowess; it is also, and fundamentally, the index of a minimum of well-being, a sign that one has paid employment, and a guarantee of food on the table: the Riccis have pawned their sheets to pay for the bicycle. During cycling’s peak as a spectator sport—the Giro d’Italia was ﬁrst run in 1909 and was held annually thereafter apart from the war years (the Tour de France had started in 1903)—it seems likely that its popularity was connected to its appearance of democratic accessibility and the simplicity of its technology. Unlike motor racing, a sport associated with technical complexity, money, and glamour, cycling depended almost exclusively on physical ﬁtness, stamina, and gritty determination. The majority of riders were of workingclass or peasant origin.20 Anyone, potentially, could join in. This was the main running gag of Totò al Giro d’Italia (Mario Mattoli, 1949), in which the Neapolitan comic actor Totò (Antonio De Curtis), playing an ordinary citizen, barges onto the starting line alongside Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi. As the sports journalist Franco Cordelli put it: For us cycling fans there is nobody greater than a racer, whether a champion or a supporting rider. Cyclists are all simple, all God’s creatures, even the cleverest of\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nthem. We [journalists] may joke or digress; sometimes we get annoyed because “nothing is happening” and there’s no contest and we wax nostalgic over the past. But let’s not ever forget the profoundly humble nature of the cyclist.21\n\nCycling has remained popular as a spectator sport in Italy, as in other European countries, in a way that it has never been in Britain or North America, and the mass media have continued to be the essential vehicles and windows for this popularity. However, the social meaning of cycling has shifted since the 1950s as the bicycle has declined from the primary means of utilitarian transport for working-class Italians into a secondary means, used mainly for leisure, or, from the early 1980s, used by middle-class commuters as a green alternative to an overly motorized society. This decline may be correlated with the rise of the motor scooter, ﬁrst introduced in 1946; the “popular car,” the Fiat 600 and 500, introduced respectively in 1955 and 1957; and the motorino (moped), which was developed in the same period. These developments in transport also correlated with the generalized rise in living standards that accompanied them. By the late 1960s the mass use of the bicycle had become associated with the past and with a lower standard of living. The period covered in this book is one in which the bicycle could still possess great material and symbolic value for a working-class family but in which it was also starting to be eclipsed by mechanized means of personal transport associated with higher standards of living and with modernity. Community, Modernization, Identity The various forms of ﬂow and mobility we have described all have to do with the redeﬁning of place and therefore of the communities that are associated with particular places. Developments such as the repeated exposure to media images, ﬁlms, fashion items, or radio broadcasts; the physical movement back and forth across boundaries; and the increased use of means of transport, from the train to the bicycle and the scooter, are linked because they all allow for modiﬁcations in people’s sense of place, and hence their perceptions of community. In the period we are examining the increases in physical mobility and in “mediated visibility” changed people’s sense of community in important ways and these changes were part of the wider process of modernization. We seek to demonstrate that a stronger sense of a national community, what one might call a popular Italian national identity, did develop in our period. This was partly a result of internal political forces and events— Fascist nationalism, wars, occupation, the Resistance, conﬂicts between different groups in the Republic over the deﬁnition of the nation—and partly an effect of the media creating a sense of national belonging. At the same time, we\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nmaintain that this sense of national community developed through processes of repeated comparison and conﬂict with others within and beyond Italy’s borders; that is, it was the product of continual cultural exchange, defensive reaction, and mediation, and the mass media played an important part in this process. We argue, then, that the media and mass culture functioned over the long term in Italy in different ways in relation to the consolidation of national identity. On the one hand they assisted the process of national aggregation; on the other, they brought about a turning toward other cultures. In fact, we identify three distinct processes, each of which may be related to the notions of community and place, and in turn to the concept of modernization. First, the mass media, by creating national markets and networks— including national readerships for illustrated magazines, a nationwide radio network with a synchronized program schedule, and a national distribution circuit for cinema newsreels and recorded music—and by circulating images of national events as well of Italy’s different regions and localities, helped create at a mass level, in the course of the twentieth century, “Italian society” as a felt place community, whereas in the nineteenth century that community had remained largely circumscribed to political and cultural elites. The media were not the only agents in this process. Others included the Italian language, which gradually became adopted at a mass level in the course of the century; national sporting events; ﬂows of internal migration; conscription and military service; and the state education system, with its national curriculum and the development of national statistics.22 However, the media and mass culture played a central role and in some cases interacted with these other agents. As Tullio De Mauro argued in 1963, radio and sound ﬁlm, and more recently television, had been major channels in bringing about the recognition and use of Italian at a mass level. Film and television in particular had contributed to the development of what De Mauro and other linguists called “italiano popolare,” that is, the varieties of colloquial spoken Italian for informal everyday use that were gradually supplanting the use of dialects in different parts of the country.23 Second, and at the same time, the media put in circulation products and images from other countries, opening windows onto a wider world. This was partly because the national media themselves carried these images, in the form of foreign news reports and features, and partly because the cultural products to which people were exposed in Italy were never only national but were also imported. Foreign ﬁlms, music, comic strips, and popular ﬁction, as we discuss in chapters 3 through 6, brought other cultures into Italy and often exerted a strong fascination. In this way, the media and mass culture drew Italian citizens inexorably into international circuits of images, consumer goods, and lifestyles. The efforts of cultural protectionists to stem the ﬂow of prod-\n\n18\n\nIntroduction\n\nucts from outside Italy’s borders were, with a few partial and temporary exceptions, which we discuss, frustrated because the appeal of the imported products was so strong and because the protectionists in most cases lacked the means to back up their efforts with effective coercion. Third, the media created not only standardized national markets but also particular markets for different subterritories—regions and localities, and in some cases also emigrant communities abroad—and for different social subgroups: men and women, older and younger generations, children, middleand working-class people, political and religious subcultures. In this way they both reinforced and redeﬁned the internal fragmentation and stratiﬁcations of Italian society. On the face of it these three tendencies might appear to be in conﬂict with one another because they push in different directions: respectively toward national aggregation, internationalization, and the formation of subnational communities. However, it is probably more accurate to see all three as interrelated and interdependent. Just as the sense of a national community was continually fashioned and reﬁned by comparison with other communities outside the nation-state, so it was deﬁned and redeﬁned by interaction with the various subnational communities within the nation—regions, localities, social subgroups—and the latter deﬁned themselves against the nationstate and various supranational communities. The latter process may be illustrated with the example of locality. Local cultures are often thought of as forms of “primary community,” or what Ferdinand Tönnies caled Gemeinschaft, which gradually get absorbed and eroded by incorporation into the national society. However, locality may more accurately be represented as a form of community that is itself produced and reproduced by the consolidation of the nation-state and later by the enhanced role of the “regions,” those supralocal administrative units that came into being after uniﬁcation and whose political role was strengthened after World War II, and of a supranational political entity, the European Union. People, of course, lived in small-scale, territorially circumscribed communities—towns and villages—long before the age of nation-states, regions, and a federal Europe, but the very notion of these communities as “local,” and the particular modern meanings that came to be attached to locality (small, traditional, close-knit, and so on), in contradistinction to other kinds of community, only emerged when those communities came to be seen as peripheries to a center, subordinate units of a superordinate polity, and their long-term survival as distinct communities was felt to be threatened. The anthropologist Paola Filippucci, in a study of the town of Bassano in the Veneto, has stressed that it was the elites there who invented the idea of locality in the late nineteenth century when they sought legitimation from the nascent nation-state. The\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nsame elites, in this and other contexts, also imagined and constructed locality and local identity culturally, for instance, through forms of institutionalized remembering, such as the museum, local monument, war memorial, or commemorative plaque, or by promoting civic rituals such as the carnival, the local village festival (sagra), and the patron saint’s day (festa del santo patrono).24 Each of the three processes we have described here may be linked to a wider one, that of modernization, which is, we argue, closely bound up with the rise of mass communications. In invoking the concept of modernization we are not referring to the controversial work of W. W. Rostow and his followers, which represented modernization as a set of “stages of growth” from “traditional” to “modern” society, in which the ﬁfth and ﬁnal stage was that of mass consumption.25 Rostow (who later became a policy adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and a staunch supporter of sustained military engagement in Vietnam) identiﬁed these “stages” with the American model and presented the latter as desirable for all societies in order to draw them into a virtuous path of capitalist growth and away from communism. His thesis triggered extensive criticism from dependency theorists and historians and is now widely discredited.26 Likewise, the concept of “traditional society” used by Rostow has been challenged by both social and economic historians. As Gareth Stedman Jones put it: “The historian should refrain from calling the history he does not know ‘traditional society.’ This bad habit, it seems to me, has been one of the many unfortunate spin-offs from sociological theories of modernization.”27 The term “modernization,” as we use it here, is intended, rather, as a much more general and value-neutral designation of some aspects of the development of European societies since the late ﬁfteenth century. The core elements of the modernization thesis in this form are drawn from the work of Marx and Weber. It is normally seen as consisting of three interrelated developments. In the economy, it means the transition from feudalism to capitalism, the rise of the wage contract, industrialization, and the growth of market economies. In politics, it means the transition from absolutist states to nationstates, accompanied by national armies and police forces that acquire a monopoly on the legitimate use of force (Weber’s Gewalt, sometimes translated as “violence”) in their own territories and normally, though not necessarily, by liberal-parliamentary forms of democracy. In administration it means the growth of modern centralized bureaucracies and the managerial rationalization of private ﬁrms. Neither Marx nor Weber nor later theorists of modernization gave much emphasis to culture or communications media; at most they tended to see the core politico-economic processes as having cultural spinoffs, such as the formation of national education systems or national media markets. How-\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\never, other scholars have argued that the media and cultural processes are intrinsic to modernization and indeed that the latter is unthinkable without them. Jürgen Habermas, in his inﬂuential account, ﬁrst published in German in 1962, of the rise and fall of the bourgeois public sphere in Europe, gave particular prominence to the early periodical press as an arena of critical debate emerging in the interstices between the state and civil society. He argued that the rise of merchant capitalism and changing forms of political power from the sixteenth century had produced not only the modern separation between the state (a realm juridically distinct from the Church and royal courts) and civil society (a sphere of private relations separate from public authority) but also a new type of public arena intermediate between them and independent from both, which functioned as a sphere of rational criticism, deliberation and debate. In Habermas’s account, this new bourgeois public sphere consisted of critical journals, such as Defoe’s Review and Swift’s Examiner in England, and places of sociability such as clubs and coffeehouses, and it had an important role as a critical voice independent of parliament that obliged the latter to become more transparent and responsive to criticism.28 In other words, Habermas saw the nascent communications media of modern society as central to the modernization of political institutions and to the formation of a modern notion of independent public opinion. Benedict Anderson, writing some twenty years later, linked the development of the nation-state to what he called the rise of “print-capitalism” and the formation of national language communities, with the vernaculars being ﬁxed in print and becoming ofﬁcial state languages.29 He argued that the expansion of print, and the development of the newspaper, was bound up with the consolidation of nations as “horizontal-secular, transverse-time” communities, as opposed to the “vertical,” hierarchical, script-based communities that rested upon notions of divine right and in which a modern separation between cosmology and history, sacred time and secular human time, had not yet been instituted. Both these accounts argue that cultural processes, and the development of the media, were closely enmeshed with other aspects of modernization. Just as, for Habermas, the periodical press was central to the development of modern bourgeois society and to the ethos of rational critical debate that enabled a mature parliamentary state system to come into being, so, for Anderson, the promotion in print of a national vernacular language and a periodical and newspaper press were essential in forging the modern sense of an imagined national community. The arguments of both Habermas and Anderson have been partially adopted, but also criticized, by John B. Thompson, for whom the cultural sphere and the media are central to the modernization process. Thompson dissents from Habermas’s emphasis on the eighteenthcentury bourgeois public sphere at the expense of the subsequent formation\n\nIntroduction\n\n21\n\nof a sphere of radical working-class culture in the labor movement, which in its turn opposed the bourgeois sphere, and also from his pessimistic account of the decline of the bourgeois public sphere in the face of the rise of the modern mass media. Habermas, inﬂuenced by the negative and totalizing view of the Frankfurt school theorists Adorno and Horkheimer, saw the growth of commercial mass media and advertising since the late nineteenth century as stiﬂing critical debate and reestablishing the power of the state by endowing the political sphere with the unchallengeable aura and prestige it had previously enjoyed in the feudal era.30 Thompson argues, by contrast, that the development of communication media has created new forms of interaction, new kinds of visibility and new networks of information diffusion in the modern world, all of which have altered the symbolic character of social life so profoundly that any comparison between mediated politics today and the theatrical practices of feudal courts is superﬁcial at best.31\n\nAs for Anderson, although Thompson ﬁnds his link between the formation of national communities and the development of new systems of communication in a common language persuasive, he notes that he is vague when it comes to explaining how this connection actually worked. It remains “loose and tentative.”32 Above all, Anderson does not examine the ways in which media products were used by individuals, the changing forms of action and interaction made possible by new media of communication and the ways in which the development of communication media gradually altered the nature of tradition and individuals’ relation to it.33\n\nWe would extract from these various accounts the following propositions. First, the formation of the nation-state was part of a wider process of modernization and this, in turn, was bound up with the development of communications media. The media, as they developed, increasingly shaped for the citizens of each country a sense of their national belonging. Second, the media tended to retain a role separate both from that of the state and from that of the characteristic elements of civil society—economic relations, the family, and private or semipublic associations like the school. Third, the media created new forms of social interaction and enabled individuals to take a distance from traditional attitudes and beliefs. In all these ways the media played an important role in the reshaping of national identity and of citizens’ sense of their place in a wider world. Italy has often been described as having a “weak” national identity combined with strong traditions of “localism” and “familism.” This is variously attributed to the early development of the peninsula as a collection of separate city-states, the relatively late formation of an Italian nation-state (uniﬁca-\n\n22\n\nIntroduction\n\ntion in 1859–1861, and then the subsequent additions and subtractions of territories up to 1954), the persistence of low literacy levels and relatively limited geographical mobility well into the twentieth century, and the simultaneous persistence of family ties, evidenced for example by the strong role played by family ﬁrms in the national economy. The cultural anthropologist Carlo Tullio-Altan argued in the 1980s that Italy’s “socio-cultural backwardness” derived from the traditions of proto-capitalist individualism and familism, which, he claimed, with an eye to Weber, survived through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries because of the lack of a Protestant Reformation that elsewhere had effected the change in mentality by which individualism and collective responsibility were conjoined. However these judgments have been widely challenged. It has been argued that Italy does not really constitute so exceptional a case, that in all modern nations there are tensions between local, regional, and national interests, that despite Italy’s relatively late formation as a nation-state (though no later than that of Germany or Japan or many other non-European nations) it succeeded quite rapidly in creating national symbols and a sense of national cohesion, that local and family traditions managed to integrate their interests fairly successfully with the national state and economy, that Italy experienced, with Fascism, a strong movement toward national self-assertion, that the Resistance against German occupation and Fascism demonstrated the powerful cohesion that could be created in defense of the nation, and that Italy emerged after World War II with a state that had a strong degree of mass legitimation, demonstrated, among other things, by the high turnouts in successive general elections and referendums as well as by various mass demonstrations in defense of the Republic, for instance in 1960 over the Tambroni affair (when the Christian Democrats proposed to form a government with the support of the neofascist party, the Movimento Sociale Italiano) and 1978 over the murder of Aldo Moro (president of the Christian Democrat party and former prime minister) by the Red Brigades. On balance, we do not ﬁnd the thesis of a pathologically weak national identity convincing. There was intense concern with nationhood not just in the Fascist regime but equally in the postwar state that succeeded it. The nation was the central term in the transition from Fascism to the Republic: during the civil war of 1943–1945 the antifascist parties and the last-ditch defenders of Fascism both laid claim to the patria and sought to be the legitimate advocates of the deepest interests of the nation, drawing upon Risorgimento names and traditions. If it is true, as Silvio Lanaro has suggested, that at the end of the war there was also a widespread “conviction that the name and very idea of Italy had been irreparably sabotaged by Fascism” and that this tended to produce an emphasis both in public speeches and policy on a rejection of Italy’s imme-\n\nIntroduction\n\n23\n\ndiate imperialist past and a turning outward to membership of a larger transnational community,34 it is also true that the nation remained the key counter in political and cultural debate. It was the nation whose interests were articulated and fought over in the campaign for the 1948 election, the ﬁrst election to parliament under the new Constitution of the Republic. It was the nation whose culture political leaders and cultural activists ofﬁcially sought to remake, whether by giving a new democratic identity to the institutions and media inherited from Fascism, or by creating new organs or by promoting the idea of an enlarged, people’s nation, as the Communist Party did, adapting Gramsci’s slogan of the “national-popular.” The autonomist and regionalist programs of various parties were accommodated and neutralized by a new, centralized national political system that made limited concessions to administrative devolution. Postwar Italy, under the premierships of De Gasperi, sought a new role in a federal peacetime Europe, but it did so as a nation whose identity would henceforth be linked to collective European interests. The main claims we have made in this introduction, and shall substantiate and elaborate further in the course of this book, are that commercial mass culture and the spread of forms of cultural consumption associated with it—a spread that was assisted by greater physical mobility between places and a greater permeability of formerly bounded places—played a very important role in Italy’s modernization but that this role was not a simple one, nor did it have a univocal relationship to the formation of national identity. On the one hand, by creating national cultural markets, symbols, and identiﬁcations (such as through sport or music), mass culture helped people construct a sense of national belonging. On the other hand, mass culture opened out the experience of consumers to international ﬂows and circuits of communication and to comparisons with communities abroad and worked against a narrow and limited sense of national identity. One of the reasons why this was possible was that the cultural industries and consumer tastes were not subjugated to effective political controls. The regulatory policies of successive regimes were, on balance, failures. Voluntary associations that sought to direct people’s leisure sometimes pushed against the tendency toward a modernized familial and individualist consumption and sometimes worked with it.\n\nPart 1.\n\nCultural Consumption and Everyday Life\n\n1 Patterns of Consumption\n\nThe prevailing historical view of cultural consumption in Italy from the mid1930s to the mid-1950s is that it was still to a large extent “traditional” and that the modiﬁcation of most people’s daily repertoires by mass culture would not begin until later. According to this view, the 1960s was the era of the “great transformation,” a term used by Silvio Lanaro in 1993 as the title of part of his history of postwar Italy starting with the economic miracle years 1958–1963.1 We do not dispute that the period dating from the end of the 1950s was a time of particularly rapid change, but this retrospective account misrepresents the way the changes actually took place. The impression of a “great transformation” compressed into a decade or so is, we maintain, largely illusory, the result of looking at the end product and creating a kind of average out of many different individual and collective cultural repertories, which contained many contradictory processes. In reality, the changes were often slow and took sev-\n\n28\n\nCultural Consumption and Everyday Life\n\neral generations to work through. Above all, one needs to distinguish occasional contact with mass culture from regular exposure to it and habitual use. Much of the evidence we have seen suggests that many people had some experience of mass cultural products long before the communities they lived in were habitually and permanently exposed to them, even when they had little money and time to permit regular access to them. Among our own interviewees it was very difﬁcult to ﬁnd anyone who was not in some way in contact with, and aware of the existence of, modern mass culture in the period we were investigating, no matter how “remote” an area they lived in, how poor they were, and how much of their waking time was taken up by productive labor. Yet very often these people had little or no leisure or recreational time, or at any rate they had no consciousness that parts of their time belonged to these categories. There are some exceptions to this rule, limit cases of people who had negligible or minimal contact with mass culture or indeed with any form of recreation. However, these are rare enough to suggest that their circumstances were unusual. Editta L., born in Turin in 1913, was a Jewish woman who worked ﬁrst as a teacher in a nursery school and then later as a head teacher. She told a life story that was so full of privations and personal sufferings—her mother’s chronic illness, her father’s and brother’s suicides, forced changes of residence, racial persecution—that she was unable, or did not allow herself, to recall any enjoyments or moments of distraction or relaxation. When we asked her about these she did then mention the occasional visit to the theater, and some excursions to the mountains, but she had not volunteered these recollections. Editta L.’s testimony shows, in this way, the important role played by subjectivity in accepting or rejecting a narrative agenda centered on recreation and leisure. In her case she resisted this agenda. This was not the life story she wanted to tell. She wanted to recount it as a sequence of hard experiences. Another, different kind of limit case was that of interviewees whose working lives did not leave time for anything except rest and sleep between work. Natalia, born in 1922, whom we interviewed in Turin, said that her husband used to work a twelve-hour shift at the Pirelli factory six days a week and an eight-hour shift (6 a.m. to 2 p.m.) on Sundays (4: 34, 41). However, for most people we interviewed there were moments of rest or respite: Sundays or Saturday evenings at least. In order to build up a picture of the particular forms and types of cultural consumption in our period, we shall start this chapter with a brief survey of two of the regions in which we carried out our interviews, situated at different extremes of the peninsula: Calabria in the South and Piedmont in the NorthWest. Then, in the remainder of the chapter, we shall broaden out to other regions and examine, in turn, different types of cultural consumption: reading,\n\nPatterns of Consumption\n\n29\n\ncinemagoing, listening to the radio, and listening and dancing to live and recorded music. Calabria and Piedmont The life stories we collected in Celico show the sporadic way that mass culture and communications permeated an upland rural community in Calabria in the 1930s and 1940s. Celico, whose population at that time was about 2,500, had a social structure that one of the interviewees, Arturo M., born in 1917, described as between ﬁfteen to twenty families of “americani” (returned emigrants) at the top, the service class (impiegati) in the middle, and the various categories of workers at the bottom. The latter were all badly off (“stavano tutti male”) but there was a hierarchy within this category ranging from the artisans—cobbler, tailor, cooper—down to the poor peasants (74: 18, 28). There was no cinema in Celico until 1955; when it did open, as one resident recalled, “nobody went and it shut down, it went bust.” There was, however, the Cinema Scrivano in nearby Spezzano. “They put up the ﬁrst cinema in Spezzano in 1938 or 1939. But very few women went” (71/72: 16). “Since there was only one cinema you went to see what they showed. And I was lucky because when I was young I worked and scraped together some money. Not everyone could go to the cinema because they couldn’t afford it” (71/72: 26). Rita L., born in 1916, used to walk the four kilometers from Celico to Spezzano to go to the cinema and she remembered how the ﬁlms were publicized in 1949–1951: “They shouted through loudspeakers: ‘Tomorrow at the Cinema Scrivano Domani è troppo tardi’ [Tomorrow Is Too Late (Léonide Moguy, 1950)]; ‘At the Cinema Scrivano I ﬁgli di nessuno [Nobody’s Children (Raffaello Matarazzo, 1951], Catene [Chains (Raffaello Matarazzo, 1949)].’ Lovely ﬁlms those were” (76/77: 11). Carmela F. (born 1917) remembers going to see Core ’ngrato (The Ungrateful Heart) (Guido Brignone, 1951) at the cinema in Spezzano (71: 5) but apart from this she does not seem to have gone at all (72: 10– 11). She and various other people interviewed in that area also remember the mobile cinema that came on the local saints’ days and showed religious ﬁlms (70: 15). Gustavo V., born in 1910, said these ﬁlms were shown “on the festivals of San Michele or San Nicola who are the protectors of the village . . . usually they were religious ﬁlms, like the Via Crucis [Romolo Bacchini, 1919], you know, religious stuff, very moral stuff ” (75: 17). He also recalled that already in the early 1930s “Celico . . . was a holiday village, people came from Bologna, from Milan,” even though it was “not comparable to what it is today” (75: 14). Like Burcei in Sardinia (see the introduction), Celico was thus not completely “cut off.” It was permeated by the ﬂows of emigration and return, by movements to other regions and back (for instance, Gustavo V. went to Rome\n\n30\n\nCultural Consumption and Everyday Life\n\nas a student; other people were conscripted or volunteered in the wars); trips within the region (Celico-Sila, Celico-Cosenza, and so on); as well as by ﬂows of information, sounds, and images from outside (radio, cinema). There were also excursions to the surrounding area. Gustavo V. remembers that in Celico there was “a man who hired bicycles, so we went out on a bicycle” (75: 14). As for the penetration of political events, the testimonies also register the presence of Fascist associationism (see below, chapter 8), for instance, in Casole, where Rita De L. remembers going in the late 1920s with her sister dressed in the black skirt and white shirt of the Piccole Italiane while her brothers wore the yellow and pink handkerchief of the Balilla tied round their hats (76/77: 14). On the other hand, World War II seems to have impinged only in 1943– 1944 with the Allied advance northward from Sicily and the retreat of the Germans across Calabria. Maria I., born in 1932, is a good example of someone in Celico with a “traditional” cultural repertoire who was only marginally affected by modern mass culture. Until she got married in 1955, at age twenty-three, she lived in a peasant family of four, with her parents and sister. The family worked eight months a year, from March to November, on the Sila plateau, with the father’s four brothers and their wives. They kept sheep and goats there and grew potatoes. They went back and forward by oxcart; her father also sometimes went on horseback to Camigliatello, about eight kilometers from where they were in Sila. Maria made ricotta, her mother also made and sold hard cheese, and every two weeks they spent one day together baking ﬁfty kilos of bread. During the winters they were back in Celico, where they had a house with electric lighting and running water (the latter had arrived in Celico in 1922), and an inside lavatory, whereas in Sila they used petrol lamps and Maria’s father made a lavatory over a running stream. During the winters in Celico work was a little less hard. Maria did sewing and embroidery work, put out by the nuns, on trousseaux (corredi). After she was married she and her husband opened a veal butcher’s shop in Celico (he killed the calves, she sold the meat and handled the accounts), but this closed because business was poor. The preparation of girls for marriage continued to be central at least to her planning of the family’s future. Maria described how, without telling her husband, she put aside money from the shop from her own earnings to pay for her two daughters’ trousseaux when they were still little, because the women who made them were getting old and she thought they might not live till the daughters reached marriageable age.
