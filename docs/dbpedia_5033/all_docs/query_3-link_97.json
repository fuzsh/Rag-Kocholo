        "text": "Some forty years ago Natalie Zemon Davis published an article in Past & Present that opened up a new approach to the religious wars that tore France apart during the second half of the sixteenth century. Infl uenced by socio-cultural approaches and perspectives, as well as her own personal experience, 'The Rites of Violence' provided a fresh interpretation of the causes, enactment and perception of confessional violence during this confl ict. Professor Davis demonstrated that, faced with the threat of heresy or the assurance of the Reformed faith, rival confessional communities sought to establish their hegemony over each other and that violence was encouraged by religious leaders and vigorously pursued by their adherents. This infl uential essay has helped to shape our understanding of religious violence not only in the late sixteenth century but also in other periods. This volume provides a new assessment of religious violence by leading historians of early modern France. Building upon a generation of research, they explore new questions and dimensions of the religious strife of the late sixteenth century. Contributors consider not only the circumstances in which religious confl ict and violence developed, but also why it did not emerge in other places. They assess diff erent aspects of the internecine confl ict in France, including their judicial and sexual dimensions. Further themes include the emergence of religious coexistence as a real alternative to religious violence: confl ict resolution and appeasement; the diff usion of communal tensions; and initiatives for social reconstruction. Providing an important reappraisal of violence and religious confl ict in early modern France, this volume also suggests new avenues of research and points of comparison for those interested in these issues in other contexts, cultures, and arenas.\n\nJewish, Christian, and Muslim legal traditions have all attempted todefine and prohibit blasphemy: insult or verbal attack a gainst their religion, against its rites and symbols, against God and his human representatives. Such laws could be internal (prohibiting blasphemy by members of the faith group) or external (prohibiting insult by those outside the faith). This article will first briefly trace the former, looking at how Jewish, Christian, and Muslim legal traditions from Antiquity and the Middle Ages define and prohibit blasphemy. The second part of the article will then focus on the second issue, looking at how Christian and Muslim legal traditions attempted to prohibit insults to the faith by adherents of other religions. We shall look, for example, at various Christian laws dealing with what was perceived as Jewish mockery of Christian ritual and sacred objects: from mock crucifixions allegedly practiced by Jews as part of Purim celebrations in the fifth-century Roman Empire to Jews who supposedly derided the Eucharist during thirteenth-century Corpus Christi processions. We shall in parallel examine prohibitions in Muslim legal texts (including the so-called Pact of ‘Umar) of dhimmīs insulting the Prophet Muhammad or the Qur’an. This comparison will show that, while blasphemy was illegal and could be harshly sanctioned and there were lines that religious minorities must not cross, these lines were often not clearly delimited, and became the object of conflict and negotiation.\n\nThe phrase “religious violence” often brings to mind dramatic events: the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, riots in India between Muslims and Hindus, or, farther back in history, the Crusades and the Thirty Years War. But as anthropologist Jack David Eller shows in this illuminating, in-depth study, violence in connection with religion is a very broad-based phenomenon encompassing all cultures and including a wide variety of activities and complex motives. Eller presents a wealth of case material, demonstrating the many manifestations of religious violence—not just war and terrorism, which are the focus of so many discussions of religiously motivated violence—but also more prevalent forms. He devotes separate chapters to: ■sacrifice (both animal and human); ■self-mortification (including self-injury, asceticism, and martyrdom); ■religious persecution (from anti-Semitic pogroms to witchhunts); ■ethno-religious conflict (including such hotspots as Sri Lanka, Northern Ireland, and the former Yugoslavia); ■religious wars (from the ancient Hebrews’ wars and the Christian Crusades to Islamic jihad and Hindu righteous wars); ■and religious homicide and abuse (spousal abuse, genital mutilation, and “dowry death,” among other manifestations). In the final chapter, “Religion and Nonviolence,” Eller examines nonviolent and low-conflict societies and considers various methods of managing conflict. Taking a scrupulously objective approach, Eller neither accuses nor exonerates religion in regard to violence. Rather, he presents the evidence revealing which kinds of religious ideas and practices contribute to certain kinds of violence and why. In so doing, he goes a long way toward helping us understand the nature of violence generally, its complicated connections with religion, and how society in the future might avoid being blindsided by the worst aspects of human nature."
