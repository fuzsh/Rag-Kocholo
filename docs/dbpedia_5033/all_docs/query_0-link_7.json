        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosco_Giachetti\n\nFosco Giachetti (28 March 1900, in Sesto Fiorentino â€“ 22 December 1974, in Rome) was an Italian actor.\n\nFosco Giachetti was the protagonist of Lo squadrone bianco (1936), directed by Augusto Genina. He became the leading man in Fascist propaganda films such as Tredici uomini e un cannone (1936), Sentinelle di bronzo (1937), Scipione l'Africano, Edgar Neville's Italian Carmen fra i rossi (1939), L'assedio dell'Alcazar (1940) and Bengasi (1942). In 1942, he also co-starred in Goffredo Alessandrini's two part Noi Vivi and Addio Kira!.\n\nUn colpo di pistola (1942) by Renato Castellani and Fari nella nebbia (1942) by Gianni Franciolini were not as successful as his earlier films.\n\nAfter the war, he returned to the stage. He worked in Spain with Edgar Neville in Nada and in Carne de horca. He had a supporting role in 1959 Dino Risi's successful comedy Il mattatore. In 1964, he appeared in an adaptation of A. J. Cronin's novel, The Citadel.\n\nIn 2003, the Galleria Fosco Giachetti in Sesto Fiorentino was opened in his honor."
