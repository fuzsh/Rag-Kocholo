        "text": "The most interactive comedy show in the world!\n\n“Hilarious and Fascinating” – Time out New York\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT OUR MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM\n\nHYPROV (pronounced hip-rawv) is coming to after 100 cities toured, a 70-show run Off-Broadway in New York City and a six month residency in Las Vegas!! HYPROV is “hilarious and fascinating” (says Time Out New York) and is “catnip for those who relish spontaneity and informality,” (The Wall Street Journal). The New Yorker says, “say yes to HYPROV,”!\n\nThe 90-minute live show combines hypnosis and improv – two art forms that have mystified and entertained fans, skeptics and everyone in between worldwide – for a totally unique comedy experience that The Times of London declared “a celebration of the human imagination.”Your evening begins with World Renowned Hypnotist, Asad Mecci welcoming 20 volunteers* on stage to be hypnotized. The most receptive to hypnosis then join Colin Mochrie (Whose Line is it, Anyway?) to improvise the rest of the show, while hypnotized. In the hands of two experts, and solely crafted from the volunteers’ uninhibited, unconscious minds and audience suggestions, each show is an entirely original and completely unforgettable theatrical experience.\n\nWhether in the audience or on stage performing, get ready to have the time of your life!!\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nHypnosis: An expert hypnotist welcomes 20 volunteers onto the stage. These “Hyprovisors” undergo hypnosis, a process that takes about 20 minutes.\n\nImprov Comedy: The most receptive Hyprovisors then join a world-class improviser. Together, they create an instant improv troupe and perform the rest of the show—all while fully under hypnosis! The results are hilarious and unexpected, ranging from singing opera to juggling chainsaws2.\n\nAudience Participation: HYPROV is the only show where an audience member becomes the star. Whether it’s your friends or even yourself, you’ll witness hypnotized individuals performing random acts of hilarity, guided by Asad Mecci and the improviser.\n\nCOLIN MOCHRIE\n\nColin is an alumnus of Toronto’s famous Second City comedy troupe and is widely considered to be one of the leading improvisers in the world.\n\nHe is most-recognized around the world as a star of the ubiquitous comedy Whose Line Is It, Anyway? After nine years as a regular on the British improvisation series Whose Line is it Anyway?, he became a regular on the American version hosted by Drew Carey, which ran for six years on ABC and three years on ABC Family. In 2011, the entire cast was reunited in Vegas for Drew Carey’s Improv-aganza, a new series which aired for one season on GSN. A new hit version of Whose Line Is It Anyway? followed in 2013, featuring Colin, Wayne, Ryan, and new host Aisha Tyler, and is currently in its fifth season on the CW Network.\n\nA native of Scotland but lifelong resident of Canada, Colin has toured extensively worldwide for the past fifteen years alongside Whose Line castmate Brad Sherwood, performing a live improv show. Colin and Brad: Two Man Group has the distinction of being one of the longest-running comedy tours in history. Most recently, Colin appeared at the 2016 and 2017 Edinburgh Fringe Festivals with a show he co-created, HYPROV. A huge festival hit, the show provocatively hypnotizes volunteers from the audience and then improvises with them, while they are under hypnosis.\n\nIn 2007, Colin and Brad made international headlines and newscasts when they were joined on stage in Washington by the controversial Karl Rove for a rap song during the White House Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner.\n\nAppearing regularly in film and television, he was notably a cast member of CBC’s classic news spoof This Hour Has 22 Minutes for two seasons. With his wife, Debra McGrath, he produced, wrote and starred in the CBC series, Getting Along Famously.\n\nColin has garnered awards including a Writers Guild of Canada award (writing, 22 Minutes), three Canadian Comedy Awards (writing – 22 Minutes, “Pretty Funny Male” – Whose Line and Canadian Comedy Person of the Year 2013) as well as a Gemini Award (Best Ensemble, 22 Minutes). In 2010, Colin received the ACTRA Toronto Award of Excellence. Perhaps his greatest award to date was for Best Hollywood Appearance at the 2010 B-Movie Awards (Jane White is Sick and Twisted).\n\nHis first book of fiction, Not Quite the Classics, in which he uses the first and last lines of familiar classics as a launching and landing point and re-imagines everything in between, was released by Viking, a publishing arm of Penguin Canada, in October 2013. The ebook version is currently available in the US at www.diversionbooks.com\n\nor www.amazon.com\n\nASAD MECCI\n\nAsad has delivered jaw-dropping performances that have captivated audiences worldwide. He has performed in front of over 1.5 million people live and millions more through mass media. You might have seen Mecci on Entertainment Tonight, MTV, Maxim Online, HGTV, YTV, talk television or read about in the New York Times, Huffington post and in Maxim Magazine. Away from the television cameras and radio waves, Mecci has amazed crowds at Canada’s Wonderland, Skydome, GE Theater, and The Just for Laughs comedy festivals. Even within the confines of major companies like Remax, IBM and Rogers, Mecci has been invited to entertain and motivate employees and management. When he is not performing on stage, Mecci uses hypnosis to help people lose weight, reduce stress, and achieve peak performance.\n\n*Participation is completely voluntary\n\nWARNING: Comedy shows may contain mature content.\n\nLawrence Gowan is a multi-talented musician and performer known for his electrifying live shows and soaring vocals.

He began his career as the frontman for the Matthew Good Band, one of the most successful Canadian alternative rock bands during the 1990s and early 2000s. Rock radio staples such as “Hello Timebomb,” “Everything Is Automatic,” “Indestructible,” “Apparitions,” and “Load Me Up” made the group a household name, selling out shows throughout Canada over seven years and four full-length album releases. Along the way, the group picked up Juno Awards for Best Group (2000) and Best Rock Album for Beautiful Midnight that same year.\n\nAfter disbanding in 2002, Good started writing and recording his first solo record, 2003’s Avalanche, which marked a creative departure from his earlier work but had no trouble finding an audience. Hailed as a masterful work of emotional and intellectual depth, the album struck a chord with critics and audiences alike and set Good’s solo career on a rapid, upward trajectory.\n\nAvalanche clocked in at just under 70 minutes long, making it clear he had plenty to say, and audiences were ready to listen. With long, complex melodies to get lost in and in-your-face protest rock, his solo work would prove to be the cure to the short and vapid pop songs of the early 2000s, almost prophesying the darker times to come.\n\nWith his award-winning 2009 record Vancouver, Good countered the corporate patriotism of the 2010 Vancouver Olympics by shining a light on those in the margins of the major Canadian city, seemingly swept under the rug to make way for parades and celebrations. Indeed, Good’s music has often given a voice to the under-represented.\n\nTo date, Good’s body of work includes thirteen full-length studio albums, four EPs, two compilation LPs, and one live album. He has been nominated for 21 Juno Awards throughout his career, with solo wins for Rock Album of the Year for Vancouver and Video of the Year for 2003’s “Weapon”. He has also garnered eight Top 10 radio singles in Canada as a solo artist, including “Weapon,” “In A World Called Catastrophe,” “Alert Status Red,” “Born Losers” and “Last Parade.” New music from Matthew Good is slated for release in mid-2024.\n\nHe has never been one to shy away from pushing musical boundaries. Through his music, Good’s defiant spirit anchors a vulnerable, unapologetic outlook on life while offering glimpses of hope and reminding us there is beauty in the world. Never one to bite his tongue, his hyper-awareness of the world around him, including political, socio-economic, and mental health issues, has earned him accolades for his thoughtful and deliberate approach.\n\nAs the world, politically and culturally, continues to spiral into seemingly darker and darker places, Good has been there in lockstep, to hold up a mirror to society’s adoration of violence, the hypocrisy of those in power, and the injustices everywhere that permeate his music.\n\nA RETROSPECTIVE CELEBRATION OF ONE OF CANADA’S MOST ICONIC BANDS\n\nIf you were a music fan in the 80s, you would have had to have been living on another planet in order to have missed the launch on MuchMusic of Canada’s very own GLASS TIGER. People all around the world joined in the frenzy that was; “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone),” “Someday,” “My Town,” and “Diamond Sun” to name but a few. Join Glass Tiger with special guest MuchMusic VJ, Erica Ehm, for this “one-of-a-kind” retrospective of the music that travelled the globe. Together they will take you on a journey of the home we call….THIS ISLAND EARTH.\n\nGLASS TIGER TOUR SPONSOR: EVERYDAY PEOPLE FINANCIAL\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nAnd so it continues…the story of one of Canada’s most enduring and iconic bands, Glass Tiger, roars on.\n\nOriginally known as Tokyo, the band formed in Newmarket, Ontario in 1981 and spent several years cutting their teeth in the bar scene of the day. With rapidly growing\n\npopularity, it didn’t take long for all the major record labels to come courting, culminating in their signing of a world-wide recording deal with Capitol Records in 1985.\n\nChanging their name to Glass Tiger, their debut album, The Thin Red Line quickly became an unstoppable force, rocketing up the charts to become the fastest selling\n\ndebut in Canadian history, spawning no less than five hit singles. Leading the charge, was the now-and-forever iconic, “Don’t Forget Me (When I’m Gone)”, a song that is etched into the very fabric of popular music’s history. The iconic song along with another hit single, “Someday”, both reached Top 10 on the Billboard Charts in the U.S and contributed to The Thin Red Line going quadruple platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.\n\nGrammy nominated and 5x award winners of both The Junos and Canadian Classic, the band has sold 5 million albums worldwide, and shared stages and recording performances with some of the world’s leading acts including; Rod Stewart, Tina Turner, Bryan Adams, Journey, Julian Lennon, and Cheap Trick (to name a few).\n\nIn 2019 Glass Tiger released 33. Produced by Glass Tiger founding member Sam Reid and UK, singer, songwriter, Andrew Cole, 33 is an unapologetically raw, mature,\n\neclectic, statement that states simply: “This is who we are today and this is how we see the world around us.”\n\nFrom the rough and tumble, rebellious, “This is London”, a throwback to their “bar days” when you simply picked up a guitar, started a band, and made raucous loud music, to the ethereal nature of pop with tracks such as, “This is Your Life” and “Keepers of Time”, this EP is, without a doubt, what Glass Tiger fans have been anxiously awaiting for over two decades.\n\nOctober 30, 2020 – Glass Tiger released their first Christmas/Holiday offering in 34 years titled, Songs for A Winter’s Night. The album is a collection of songs written by Glass Tiger along with a cover of Gordon Lightfoot’s “A Song for A Winter’s Night.” Songs for A Winter’s Night sees the band joined by such timeless artists as Natalie MacMaster, Isabel Bayrakdarian, and the Steve Sidwell Orchestra. Legendary singer/ songwriter Gordon Lightfoot makes an appearance to voice a very special poem written by lead singer Alan Frew, “Ode For A Winter’s Night.” Songs for a Winter’s Night is heralded by the lead single “Happy Holidays” featuring the inimitable Roch Voisine.\n\nGlass Tiger continues to tour and play for enthusiastic audiences from coast-to-coast. In September of 2023, Glass Tiger was inducted into Canada’s prestigious Walk of\n\nFame at a star-studded ceremony at Toronto’s Iconic Massey Hall.\n\nglasstiger.ca\n\nAN INTIMATE SOLO CONCERT WITH ONE OF CANADA’S PREMIER COUNTRY MUSIC STARS\n\nMembers check your inbox for instructions on how to purchase advance discount tickets or call 705-789-4975\n\nABOUT THE ARTIST\n\nGeorge Canyon rose to becoming one of Canada’s hottest Country Music stars in the early 2000’s and has won countless accolades and awards, including Juno Awards, CCMA Awards, and ECMA Awards to name a few.

If that were the case, you could try looking under, rock, pop, folk, world or even classical.\n\nHis own self-described musical A.D.D. has kept his music fresh for decades. Maybe it has something to do with being born next to a candy factory, or his ambidextrous brain, but his thoughtful lyrics & charming performances have earned a devoted fan base, multiple nominations for Junos, The Polaris Prize, CBC’s “Heart Of Gold”, and most recently winning the CFMA’s “Producer of the year” and “Oliver Schroder Pushing the Boundaries” Awards.\n\nBut Danny considers his career highlights to be the unique real life moments like performing for Jane Goodall’s 85th birthday party, touring with Stuart Mclean and working with charities close to his heart.\n\nIn 2015, his adventurous spirit took him to the country of Belize where he tracked down one of his favourite Belizean bands; The Garifuna Collective (a unique Afro-Amerindian cultural group) and convinced them to create an album together. That album (“Black Birds Are Dancing Over Me”) was called “One of the finest musical works of our time” by Billboard’s Larry Leblanc, landed Danny’s 3rd Juno nomination (World Music Album Of The Year), and a sold out summer tour of North America with The Garifuna Collective.\n\nWhile in Belize, Danny also founded the DM Ocean Academy Fund that helps raise scholarships for a small non-profit community high school. To date, Danny & his fans have raised over $125,000.00 for the school.\n\nIn 2016, Danny returned to Canada to record “Matadora,” his most deeply humanist album to date. This ten-song collection explores the environmentalist, pacifist, romanticist, archivist, and space enthusiast in Danny.\n\nThen it was off to the Canadian high Arctic where Danny recorded “Khlebnikov” (possibly the most northern album ever recorded/above 80°) aboard the legendary Soviet-era Russian ice-breaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov during an 18-day arctic expedition curated by Astronaut Col. Chris Hadfield. Once home, Danny’s recordings were arranged for brass & strings by film composer Rob Carli. The result is a suite of atmospheric and haunting songs about the Arctic, our planet, and our place in it.\n\nWhen he’s not performing he’s fighting for musicians’ rights, the environment, making short films, producing, running his studio or filming his comedy/sci-fi/music show “Dan’s Space Van”\n\nABOUT THE VENUE\n\nThe concert takes place in Greenhouse #4 at Sandhill Nursery.

In recent years, the acclaimed, award-winning singer-songwriter has seen his profile grow with his breakthrough album, Without People.\n\nTouring behind (2020’s) Without People saw Woods play to his largest audiences to date. That included a stint opening for New Jersey-based retro rockers Gaslight Anthem on their recent reunion tour.\n\nThroughout his distinguished career, Donovan Woods has built a devoted following who cling to the acclaimed songwriter’s every word. Never one to mince words, Woods is one of music’s most vulnerable storytellers and on his forthcoming studio album, Donovan takes that a step further. Honest and unflinching, on Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now, his upcoming seventh studio album, Woods takes a long look inside and isn’t necessarily thrilled with what he sees. For an artist who isn’t afraid to bear his soul, this is as emotionally gritty as he has ever been.\n\nLong known as a masterful storyteller, Woods is at his absolute best on Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now. Across the album’s 12 sparse, intimate songs, Woods finds himself reflecting on the ups and downs he has been through since 2020. His writing allowed him to open up and address the complexities of life that he has been going through.\n\nThe album, he notes, serves as “a funeral to the life he was living.”\n\nSonically, Woods decided to take a different approach.\n\n“We had our boundaries and made things sound beautiful within them,” he says. “And what’s left is scrappier than Without People, but I feel like moments of creation are much more accessible on this record.”\n\nMany of the songs that comprise Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now focus on the intricacies of friendships and relationships, and looking at the little moments in life. Co-produced with longtime collaborator James Bunton over much of 2023, the album’s delicate nature is reflected in its lyrics.\n\nThe psychology of people’s actions always fascinated Woods and informs much of Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now. Focusing on happy, party feelings doesn’t appeal to him.\n\nOnce he gets down these darker paths (“It was a warts and all album in a way that I never had done before”), which he admits can be uncomfortable, the songs flow and are universal.\n\nIn particular, on the heart-wrenching “Rosemary”. Co-written with Connor Seidel, “Rosemary” contemplates what happens in the aftermath of a heated argument. “Have you ever had a fight by text message? And it’s long, and existential,” he says. “Someone did something wrong and maybe that’s it.” Continuing, he explains that “Rosemary” is about “finally admitting all your faults, showing your actual self and asking, can you still love me? And really wanting an answer either way.”\n\nNot everything is doom and gloom.\n\nOn “When Our Friends Come Over,” Woods sings lovingly about a couple who rediscover their affection for one another. Featuring Madi Diaz on vocals, the song highlights how two partners are able to appreciate each other in the presence of others. Even though they’re going through a rocky patch, Woods shows how even the tiniest of gestures are the true signs of love.\n\nThroughout an album of heart wrenching songs, none hit harder than “Back for the Funeral.” Taking place in a small town, a group of friends who haven’t seen each other in years return to memorialize a schoolmate after they overdosed on pills.\n\n“There’s so much writing done about being back in your hometown and what it does to you,” Woods explains. “But there’s the idea that you only go there with bad news—which can be true—and what it does to your feelings about your hometown.”\n\nHowever, the song poignantly shows that even though someone may return to their hometown for unfortunate reasons, reconnecting with old friends is a positive byproduct of the circumstance.\n\nAs Woods continues to work on himself, Things Were Never Good If They’re Not Good Now is the portrait of a songwriter at his creative best. Addressing the truths and pains of life is never easy, and here, he does so in a way that’s brutally honest. After all, that’s what great songwriters do."
