        "text": "Lyncs, the stage name for Pennsylvanian turned New Yorker Jacqeluine Hynes, is an indie-pop singer, songwriter and producer. Today (July 16) marks the release of her new song “Obvious.” The song, written by Lyncs and Keith Varon over Zoom, was inspired by a romantic relationship Lyncs had that was never officially a relationship."
