        "text": "Image: Julian Burgeño\n\nAmerican four piece indie-alt-pop band The Aces - made up of lead vocalist and guitarist Cristal Ramirez, drummer Alisa Ramirez, guitarist Katie Henderson and bassist McKenna Petty - today release their new single ‘Always Get This Way’ which will be featured on their just announced third studio album I’ve Loved You For So Long.\n\nCo-written by the band with producer Keith Varon, the song is an upbeat track which combines classic pop sounds with guitar, including a 1980s style statement electric guitar solo. The sonic brightness of the song is in contrast to the lyrics which focus on struggling with mental health. ‘I’m trying really hard to not fall apart…I know this is not ideal for you / But if you could be kind while I lose my mind / Try to’ lead singer Cristal sings.\n\n“I was in the worst mental state of my life when we wrote ‘Always Get This Way’,” Cristal says. “Filled with anxiety, and having panic attacks almost every night, it took everything in me to make the 45-minute drive to the studio that day. I was just there to make something. I was just there to feel better. Alisa, as she always has been, was a strong voice encouraging me to explore how I was feeling through a song. At first I was hesitant and embarrassed, but pretty soon ‘Always Get This Way’ was unraveling quickly through the speakers.\n\n“This song is about shame, panic, and struggle. It’s about the fact that we hold no space for those struggling mentally in our society, and just kinda wish they’d get over it and quit being an inconvenience. It was the song that felt like it granted us permission to make what would become our upcoming album. It’s one of the most vulnerable songs I’ve ever written.”\n\nThe Aces third studio album I’ve Loved You For So Long will be released on June 2.\n\nFirst creating music in 2012, over the last ten years have become an important voice for gender equality and the LGBTQI+ community in the alternative pop scene. Crossing between gritty indie music and carefree pop, they create music that is intelligent, involving and always connect with your soul. I’ve Loved You For So Long is going to be another gem in their incredible portfolio of music.\n\n'Always Get This Way' is out now via Red Bull Records. You can download on iTunes and stream on Apple Music and Spotify.\n\nTo keep up with all things The Aces you can follow them on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter."
