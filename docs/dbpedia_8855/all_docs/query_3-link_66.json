        "text": "Tickets to My Downfall is the fifth studio album by American musician Machine Gun Kelly. It was released on September 25, 2020, by Bad Boy Records and Interscope Records. The album marks the departure from his established rap sound and became a more guitar-driven pop-punk album. It was his first collaborative project with drummer and producer Travis Barker, and features guest appearances from Halsey, Trippie Redd, Blackbear, and Iann Dior, as well as Bert McCracken and Yungblud on the deluxe edition.\n\nTickets to My Downfall was preceded by the release of the singles: \"Bloody Valentine\", \"Concert for Aliens\" and \"My Ex's Best Friend\". The album was a commercial success, debuting atop the US Billboard 200, his first to do so. It was well-received by critics, and went on to be his first album to be certified platinum by the RIAA."
