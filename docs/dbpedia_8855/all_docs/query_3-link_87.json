        "text": "Singer/songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, Jacqueline Hynes, aka Lyncs, has quickly become a favorite. Her indie-rock vocals and unique blend of dreamy choruses make an excellent combination. Her songwriting amplifies her strengths in sharing life experiences by making them into relatable and catchy tunes that will stick in your head for days.\n\nThe singer has been sharing her story in hopes of finding what connects us all since 2018 when she first released her EP 'The Safety'. That lead her to tour nearby her hometown of Lancaster, PA, and then to opening for acts like Young The Giant, New Vices, and August & Alden. Lyncs hasn't stopped ever since, and her music has been featured on American Songwriter, Vents Magazine, and countless playlists, including Spotify's New Music Friday.\n\nShe is now a fellow NYC resident and has performed in many of our favorite spots around the city, like Pianos, The Bitter End, and Rockwood Music Hall. We learned that she's also played at the very well-known Carnegie Hall, where shortly after, her love for songwriting took over. And thankfully, she decided to follow that passion because otherwise, we wouldn't have her wonderful music to fangirl over. Speaking of which, she is set to release a new song every month of 2021 with help from Keith Varon (The Aces, Nightly) and Rob Ernst (LAUV, Salem Ilese, Shallou)."
