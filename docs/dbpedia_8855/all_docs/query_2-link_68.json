        "text": "SUR AKA Zack Arnett, LA Based, Northern California-bred Artist / producer/songwriter is one of those rare, creatives whose genre-bending style allows him the freedom to jump into the studio with a diverse range of artists, songwriters and producers across alternative, pop, hip-hop, rhythmic, electronic, rock, and beyond. Signed to Interscope under the artist name SUR, Zack quickly gained momentum and became part of the Pulse Music Group family where he's been housed since. Arnett has had the opportunity to write and produce alongside a wide-ranging list of creatives that has kept his genre-hoping skills at their sharpest working with Jeff Gitty, Aria, Mike Stroud (Ratatat) Natasha Bedingfield, Billy Porter, Sam James, Coleman Hell, Nico Vega, Jafaris, Willa, Phem, Dave Basset, Taylor Hill, Indigo Sparke, Keith Varon, Mobley, Jenny Lee Lindberg (Warpaint), Vlad Holiday, Oliver, Alex Tirheimer, Le Fawnhawk, SameSame, Nicky Davey, Goodbye Noah, Evan Coffman, Jakey and many others. He continues to write and produce for his artist project, SUR as well as create work for various TV, gaming, sports and film properties. Zack has a penchant for writing soulfully infused, anthemic, melodies with hook-laden, choruses, clever lyrics and a dash of hip-hop spirit that truly captures a mood."
