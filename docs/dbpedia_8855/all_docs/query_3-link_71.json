        "text": "Navigating life with his heart on his sleeve, charismatic pop-rocker Chad Tepper is never afraid to be vulnerable. In celebration of his recent engagement, today he shares a new music video for his song “Outta My League,” produced and co-written by Keith Varon (MGK, jxdn, chloe moriondo). Written about his new fiancé, the alt-rock track is accompanied by a lyric video featuring self-shot footage of himself and his future wife basking in love’s glow on a desert road trip.\n\nTepper channels feelings of bliss infused with emotionally charged lyrics full of self-deprecating coping mechanisms to mask his insecurities. He explains, “The song is about when you meet someone and start dating them, but they are obviously way better than you are. They've got the whole package - looks, brains, etc., and you don't understand why they even like you.” Check out the video below!\n\n\"Outta My League”\n\nWATCH | LISTEN\n\nChad continues, “I think that when you find \"the one\" you should feel this way. You should feel like they are amazing and out of your league. People ask, \"How did you know they were the one?\"...well this is how I knew.”"
