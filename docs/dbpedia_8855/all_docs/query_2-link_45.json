        "text": "The Strumbellas are set to hit the road in support of the album with the kick-off of their North American Part Time Believer Tour on February 9 in Vancouver, BC. Making stops in Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, Philadelphia, New York, Nashville, Austin, Los Angeles, Portland, Denver, Chicago, and more, the Part Time Believer Tour promises an experience filled with memorable moments fans won’t soon forget – tickets are on sale now.\n\nSince forming in 2008 and releasing their debut album, 2012’s My Father and the Hunter, the two-time JUNO award-winning alternative group have steadily shared follow-ups brimming with folk-tinged gusto, from 2013’s We Still Move on Dance Floors to 2016’s Platinum-certified Hope, which includes the 5x Platinum-certified single “Spirits” and Gold-certified single “We Don’t Know”, to 2019’s Rattlesnake, featuring Gold-certified single “Salvation”. Part Time Believer is a collection that signals The Strumbellas’ grand return and rebirth.\n\nWhen live touring came to a standstill, The Strumbellas put every last bit of energy into perfecting this album, spending days behind the scenes composing and writing songs. Out of their sessions came nearly 50 tracks, which the band — now with Jimmy Chauveau on board as lead vocalist — whittled down to the 12 found on Part Time Believer. Shepherding the recording process along was producer Ben Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Kaiser Chiefs, Walk the Moon), with additional tracks produced by Keith Varon (Machine Gun Kelly, Lindsey Stirling), Stevie Aiello (Thirty Seconds To Mars), and Dave Schiffman (RHCP, The Killers, Adele). Packed with poignant lyrics surrounded by bombastic, folk-driven melodies, Part Time Believer continues The Strumbellas’ long-standing tradition of mood-meshing.\n\nThe Strumbellas 15-year career includes hundreds of millions of streams and millions of monthly listeners across DSPs, Gold Records in the US, France, Belgium and Italy, #1 Billboard Alternative Airplay charting, iHeart Awards and performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and Late Night with Seth Meyers. Now, with the release of Part Time Believer, 2024 is poised to be another successful year. Stay tuned for more from The Strumbellas soon."
