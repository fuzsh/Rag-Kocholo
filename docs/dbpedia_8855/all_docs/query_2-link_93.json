        "text": "“Waiting For The Laughter” by iskwē | ᐃᐢᑫᐧᐤ\n\nOver the last few months we’ve been getting steady releases from iskwē | ᐃᐢᑫᐧᐤ, but now we finally have news of a full album! nīna is due out on April 12th, and is said to be “profoundly autobiographical”.\n\nThe latest single, “Waiting For The Laughter”, was co-written with akaMatisse of Keys N Krates, and is dense & sweeping, yet melancholic, with iskwē explaining: “Each time the mirror faces, I find brand new lines and deeper creases. The art of aging never changes; we all get older every day. Somehow women are told we age out faster, life spinning out so quickly, it can be hard to live up to all the beauty standards that keep changing along the way. I find it dizzying to think of the times I’ve loathed my body, how I pluck, colour, and cover the natural body I was born with. Will I stop? Probably not. Do I try to push myself as far as I can in order to love the body and being I was born with? Every day. I’m constantly searching for the laughter in it all. Laughter is medicine after all. Waiting for the laughter to drive the hurt away.”\n\nIf what we’ve heard so far is any indication, nīna is one of my most anticipated albums of the year so far, and I can’t wait to hear it!\n\nKirk\n\n“Alone In America” by Hotel Mira\n\nAhead of their “I Am Not Myself Canadian Tour”, Hotel Mira has dropped a brand new video for “Alone In America”.\n\nThe earworm of a song is from their recently-released album, I Am Not Myself, and the new video follows the band’s exploits in Las Vegas, playing into “the glitz and sleaze of the distilled over-the-top grotesque idea of America.”\n\nTheir tour kicks off later this week, and includes a stop at the legendary Commodore Ballroom here in Vancouver, joined by Fake Shark!\n\nKirk\n\n“Holster” by The Strumbellas\n\nIt’s just under a month until the new album, Part Time Believer, from The Strumbellas drops (Feb 9) and we have another new single from the record.\n\nThe band says the new album will be about either being depressed or optimistic, and the latest single “Holster” fits that bill.\n\nDave Ritter says that the track bounces between “feeling like a failure and feeling like a hero. I hear the cry of someone who always almost overcomes their demons–who stumbles at the crucial moment every time–but comes roaring back, still believing that maybe this time they’ll come out on top.”\n\nThe band is heading out on a Canadian tour in February starting in Vancouver on the release day for the record, at the Commodore with Michael Bernard Fitzgerald opening.\n\nChristine\n\n“St. Paul’s” by Kandle\n\nWith her new album coming out next spring, Kandle has released her second single, “St. Paul’s”.\n\nThe song is a dark and hynotic tune, with Kandle explaining: “I feel that the importance of making “dark” music lies in its relatability. Throughout my life I’ve connected with the words and melodies of artists like Nick Cave, Courtney Love, Nine Inch Nails, Leonard Cohen, Nirvana, PJ Harvey and Billie Holiday. These songs mirrored my own experiences of pain, misery and loneliness, and through that connection I was granted temporary comfort and self-acceptance, even if it only lasted the length of a song. I believe that much of the therapeutic and cathartic benefit of music is diminished when it’s over-explained. Rather it should be encouraged to project one’s own meaning onto a song and create one’s own connection. When lyrics resonate with you, it’s as if they can articulate every feeling you just can’t seem to find the words for. It is for that reason that I would rather say very little about this song.”\n\nYou can check out the equally haunting video below!\n\nKirk\n\n“Running Out Of Time” by The Strumbellas\n\nThe Strumbellas recently shared “Running out of Time”, the latest track from their forthcoming album Part Time Believer, which is due February 9, 2024.\n\nOf the song, Dave Ritter, who performs piano, organ, percussion, and vocals says: “Berry Gordy Jr. used to say, ‘Don’t bore us - get to the chorus.’ This song joins a long lineage of songs from She Loves You and Nowhere To Run to Bad Blood and Hotline Bling that start with the chorus. It’s not something we pre-determined. …But while we were making the song it felt right not to beat around the bush. I guess we didn’t want to waste any more time.\n\nIf you listen closely, maybe with headphones, you can hear one of our favourite parts of this song. Somehow producer Keith Varon and mixer Ben Allen were able to gather the background vocals together into a fuzzy choir of robot angels, especially in the final chorus. The harmonies dance and sparkle around the lead vocal in a way that makes us smile every time we hear it.”\n\nThe band has also announced a whole slew of tour dates, which happens to kick off here in Vancouver at the Commodore on February 9th (the release date!) with Michael Bernard Fitgerald!\n\nChristine\n\n“I Will Remember You” by Metric\n\nOf all the things I was not expecting from Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, near the top of that list was Metric covering Sarah McLachlan’s “I Will Remember You”\n\nScott Pilgrim and Metric have a long history together; the character of Envy Adams is partially based on Emily Haines in the original graphic novels, and her fictional band The Clash at Demonhead uses their song “Black Sheep” in the film, Scott Pilgrim vs The World. Now that connection continues in the new Netflix anime, with the inclusion of this cover (no spoilers as to why, where, and when it happens, though).\n\nAnd just an aside, as a long-time fan of Scott Pilgrim, I really enjoyed the show!\n\nKirk\n\n“Making the Most of It” by Major Love\n\nWhen Colleen Brown and Scenic Route To Alaska get together, they make Major Love.\n\nThe band is the collaboration of Brown with Trevor Mann, Shea Connor, and Murray Wood, and last week they shared their latest single, “Making the Most of It”.\n\nThe new song is a high energy earworm, that was written out of pandemic-times, reflecting on “the dissolution of a once vibrant existence, turned mundane; and the pressure to become a ‘productivity drone’ in place of a social life on the outside.”\n\nHave a listen blow and good luck not getting the chorus stuck in your head!\n\nKirk\n\nThe Strumbellas just keep getting bigger and more grandiose, and their new single just solidifies that fact.\n\n“Salvation” is a surprisingly cheery turn from the band, lyrically, and lead singer/guitarist Simon Ward says the band’s “whole dream has been to make cool, small-town music with just a fun, poppy feeling. Every record we do, we get closer to that. Salvation is exactly what we wanted to do, what we were hoping to get out of this song and record: fun, poppy songs that are sad and weird.”\n\nIt’s exactly the kind of pick-me-up you need on a Sunday like this."
