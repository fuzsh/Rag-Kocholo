        "text": "On Sept. 25,, American rapper, singer, songwriter, and actor Machine Gun Kelly released his album titled “Tickets To My Downfall”.\n\nThis album is Machine Gun Kelly’s (Richard Colson Baker’s) fifth studio album.\n\nHis label is Bad Boy/Interscope Records and the album is produced by Keith Varon, Machine Gun Kelly himself, Nick Mira and Travis Baker.\n\nWarning: this album and its songs include explicit language and parental advisory is recommended.\n\nBefore “Tickets To My Downfall” made its debut, Machine Gun Kelly was known more as a rapper from the United States.\n\nHis previous albums fall under the Hip-Hop/Rap category. “Tickets To My Downfall” is an Alternative/Punk music album. With this album, he has departed from his established rap sound to a more guitar-driven pop punk approach.\n\nThe album includes 23 songs, which are mostly all fast-paced punk rock songs.\n\nThis album will broaden his fan base and propel his music career forward and reaches people who enjoy listening to punk rock, which his previous albums did not.\n\nThe songs in the album are well written and are very relatable for fans. One of his songs, titled “Bloody Valentine,” actually won him a VMA award for best alternative song.\n\nI give this album a 4.9 of 5 star rating. My only criticism is that the album contains two songs that are interludes, and I personally do not enjoy interludes. I praise Machine Gun Kelly, Travis Baker, and everyone else involved in the making of “Tickets To My Downfall.”"
