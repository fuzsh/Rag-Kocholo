        "text": "Today, multi-platinum, internationally renowned band The Strumbellas share “Running out of Time”, the latest track from their forthcoming album Part Time Believer, due February 9, 2024 via Glassnote Records. “Running out of Time” follows previous singles “My Home is You” and “Hold Me”, and gives fans a glimpse at the highly-anticipated new album, which drops the same day The Strumbellas kick off their North American Part Time Believer Tour.\n\nOn “Running out of Time,” Dave Ritter, who handles piano, organ, percussion, and vocals shares, “Berry Gordy Jr. used to say, ‘Don’t bore us - get to the chorus.’ This song joins a long lineage of songs from She Loves You and Nowhere To Run to Bad Blood and Hotline Bling that start with the chorus. It’s not something we pre-determined. We didn’t say to ourselves ‘let’s write a song that opens with the chorus!’ But while we were making the song it felt right not to beat around the bush. I guess we didn’t want to waste any more time.\n\nIf you listen closely, maybe with headphones, you can hear one of our favourite parts of this song. Somehow producer Keith Varon and mixer Ben Allen were able to gather the background vocals together into a fuzzy choir of robot angels, especially in the final chorus. The harmonies dance and sparkle around the lead vocal in a way that makes us smile every time we hear it.”\n\nSince forming in 2008 and releasing their debut album, 2012’s My Father and the Hunter, the two-time JUNO award-winning alternative group have steadily shared follow-ups brimming with folk-tinged gusto, from 2013's We Still Move on Dance Floors to 2016's Hope to 2019's Rattlesnake. Part Time Believer is a collection that signals The Strumbellas’ grand return and rebirth.\n\nWhen live touring came to a standstill, The Strumbellas put every last bit of energy into perfecting this album, spending days behind the scenes composing and writing songs. Out of their sessions came nearly 50 tracks, which the band — now with Jimmy Chauveau on board as lead vocalist — whittled down to the 12 found on Part Time Believer. Shepherding the recording process along was producer Ben Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Kaiser Chiefs, Walk the Moon), with additional tracks produced by Keith Varon (Machine Gun Kelly, Lindsey Stirling), Stevie Aiello (Thirty Seconds To Mars), and Dave Schiffman (RHCP, The Killers, Adele).\n\nPacked with poignant lyrics surrounded by bombastic, folk-driven melodies, Part Time Believer continues The Strumbellas’ long-standing tradition of mood-meshing. The anthemic opener “Hold Me” is one of the rare Strumbellas love songs, though, in true fashion, it’s tinged with melancholy. “It’s a lot about feeling sad,” Ritter expands. “It’s love and depression, love and dark times and what it means to be loved and need love at your lowest, and what people can mean to each other when they're down.”\n\nThe Strumbellas 15-year career includes hundreds of millions of streams and millions of monthly listeners across DSPs, Gold Records in the US, France, Belgium and Italy, #1 Billboard Alternative Airplay charting, iHeart Awards and performances on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and Late Night with Seth Meyers. Now, with the release of Part Time Believer, 2024 is poised to be another successful year.
