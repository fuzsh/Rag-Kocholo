        "text": "Ever since forming in 2008 and releasing their debut album, 2012’s My Father and the Hunter, two-time JUNO award-winning alternative group The Strumbellas have steadily released follow-ups containing every ounce of stomping, hand-clapping, alt-country gusto, from 2013’s We Still Move on Dance Floors to 2016’s Hope to 2019’s Rattlesnake. They’ll soon round the corner with a brand-new fifth studio album, Part Time Believer, a collection that signals The Strumbellas’ grand return and rebirth.\n\nNow with Jimmy Chauveau on board as lead vocalist, The Strumbellas spent the last four years writing, recording, and whittling 50 songs down to 12. Honed by producers Ben Allen (Gnarls Barkley, Kaiser Chiefs), Keith Varon (Machine Gun Kelly), Stevie Aiello (30 Seconds To Mars), and Dave Schiffman (RHCP, The Killers), Part Time Believer continues The Strumbellas’ long-standing tradition of blending anthemic, brightly coloured compositions with yearning, contemplative lyrics.\n\n“I think people often feel like things are escaping them, or they’re trying to grab on to something — happiness, gratitude, professional or personal goals — and for some reason, they just can’t get there,” says David Ritter, who handles piano, organ, percussion, and vocals. “Even if they get the thing they want, it doesn’t feel the way they thought it would. A lot of these songs are about trying to, like, figure out why we’re all feeling this way, and how we can find more peace in our lives.”\n\nVancouver-based Soul-American artist Frazey Ford released her critically acclaimed album U Kin B The Sun via the Arts & Crafts label on February 7, 2020. Ford is a founding member of the seminal folk band The Be Good Tanyas.\n\nShe has previously released two critically acclaimed solo albums, including her 2014 album “Indian Ocean” which made the Polaris Prize long list and was nominated for a Juno in 2015 in the best roots album category. This album was recorded with Al Green’s band, the High Rhythm Section, the iconic architects of the Memphis Soul Sound. It was named one of the top releases of 2014, an acclaimed country soul gem inviting comparisons to Cat Power’s “The Greatest”. The video for Frazey’s song “Done” from this album has captured over 2.5 million views on YouTube and still counting.\n\nHer latest album has garnered incredible international reviews. At turns ecstatic and heavy-hearted, glorious shambolic, and deeply purifying, U Kin Be The Sun has been praised as “her best yet” (The Times) for its “dramatic and rather dazzling” (Uncut) blend of Ford’s memorizing vocals and percussion-soaked grooves. Performing live, Frazey Ford is a captivating presence supported by the intoxicating lilt of her band.\n\nSocial activism and a feverish dance party make a tantalizing combination and 2022 JUNO winner for Contemporary Indigenous Artist of the Year, Dan “DJ Shub” General is the grand marshal we nominate to lead this jubilant parade. Shub is a true original: a title-holding battle DJ/producer, a joyful collaborator and a non-stop creator who skillfully weaves craft, message and heritage. Since exiting A Tribe Called Red, Shub has continued adding jewels to his “Godfather of PowWowStep” crown. War Club is Shub’s latest celebration of Indigenous power: a special filmed on Six Nations of the Grand River Reserve in Ontario that features Shub’s trademark finger-smoking scratch-a-thons, an all ages cast of traditional dancers, and plenty of bustles shaking to outstanding musical collaborations with Phoenix Pagliacci, Boogát and Fawn Wood that tells the tale of a young girl searching for her brother with the help of an enchanted war club. Shub’s uncompromising pride in Aboriginal heritage and talent is the driving force behind his art. Join the parade – Shub’s made sure there’s enough hip hop, Indigenous culture, power, protest and humanity for all of us.\n\nAnishinaabe MC/Singer/Songwriter Leonard Sumner’s storytelling flows directly from the shores of Little Saskatchewan First Nation, located in the heart of the Interlake of Manitoba. Sumner’s self-determined sound is evidence of his ability to simultaneously occupy landscapes of multiple musical genres including; Hip-Hop, Spoken Word, Country, and Rhythm and Blues.\n\nWith every vibration of the strings on his guitar, Leonard rattles the dust off truths that have been buried for far too long. On stage he poetically sings awake the consciousness of audiences who may have been unaware of their slumber. In this era of unsettling history and healing wounds of the past, Sumner’s music is an expression of medicine that walks the line between fortitude and fragility.\n\nIt’s said the cells in your body replace themselves every decade or so. After 11 albums, two EPs and 20 years as a singer-songwriter, Leeroy Stagger has been wondering if maybe the soul works the same way. Ten years sober, with two kids, a home in Victoria and a world-class recording studio to go with it, he’s far removed from the hard-living twenty-something who started on this musical path. As far as Stagger can see, they aren’t even the same person.\n\nCalgary based artist, Sonia Deleo, works in a half pitch of musical grandiosity and sensitive poetics. Fusing folk, soul, pop and rock, her masterful vocals remain at the core of her work and lift it into an enormous collection worth far more than the sum of its parts. Her big energy makes itself known in her incoming single Remind Me That I’m Crazy (May 2024). She hits Toronto in June to showcase at Canadian Music Week, followed by some northern Alberta dates with her band The New Dads in early July. Sonia can’t wait to land back on the JFMF stage!\n\nSOUR is an up-and-coming alternative-pop band from Edmonton, AB. With originals inspired by Lake Street Dive, Stevie Wonder, and Lawrence, SOUR infuses your ears with a bittersweet combination of soul-pop, R&B and jazz. Influenced by the heartbreaks, romances, and life experiences of the band, SOUR brings a new tang to an old sound. Aided by their catchy melodies, powerful horns, and bitter lyrics, SOUR’s high-energy stage presence will keep you on the dance floor all night! Not only will they leave you questioning genre, but most importantly, what that weird taste in your mouth is.\n\nFounded in 2022, The Honey Cowboy is a band of 5 creators all based out of Grimshaw Alberta. The foundation for the band was laid down over the last decade as Brendan Dickson performed solo as The Honey Cowboy, developing a modest following and a long list of quirky original songs. Since its inception the band has taken these old songs to new levels, with each member contributing their own musical touch to each song. Using this formula the band has now brought into this world a whole pile of exhilarating new material. From this deepening well of original songs the band has been delivering unforgettable performances near and far to an ever expanding fanbase. Leaving it all on the stage every show you can count on The Honey Cowboy to sweeten your life, or at least take a bit of the sting out of it.\n\nWestmore AKA ‘The Long Haired Hippie Freak’ is a 21 year old singer/songwriter & self taught multi-instrumentalist from Central Alberta.\n\nGrowing up in church & surrounded by a musical family, from a young age he always had a passion for music.\n\nHe’s a Folk & Blues musician, though his influences spread far and wide. His music is raw & relatable — while trying to capture what is in his heart. So that he can share it with the world, trying to shine a light in the darkest of places.\n\nAfter his debut of his EP Untitled #1, he has been winning the hearts of countless folks around Edmonton.\n\nJaclyn, of Girls Club DJs is one of the leading female DJs in Alberta. With over 14 years’ experience playing major events all over Edmonton, Calgary, Jasper, Banff and Canmore.

This female Canadian electronic artist whose journey is as much about creation as it is about exploration and storytelling. From DJing to producing, Lucy’s creative path is an ever-evolving adventure.\n\nHailing from a background in classical music, Lucy’s fascination with sound began early, nurtured by her training as a composer and pianist. But it was her foray into DJing at the age of 18 that set her on a trajectory of sonic exploration. Initially a means to finance her college education, DJing soon became her passion.\n\nDrawing from her diverse influences and fueled by a relentless spirit of curiosity, Lucy delved into electronic music production, teaching herself the craft through online resources at her local library. From there, she expanded her creative horizons, venturing into game design and embarking on DJ tours across Canada and North America."
