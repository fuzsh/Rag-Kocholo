Hobby Lobby, America’s largest and most complete arts-and-crafts retailer, will be opening its first store in New York City, and Katz & Associates’ Brian Katz and Daniel DePasquale helped secure the location along with Graeme Keith of The Keith Corp. The new 42,768 square foot store will be located in the former Babies“R” Us space at The Crossing on the Staten Island Mall Ring Road. Alex Varon of Brookfield Properties represented the landlord in-house in the transaction. Hobby Lobby is slated to open in Staten Island in Q1 2023.

“Katz & Associates has worked with Hobby Lobby since 2013, helping with their expansion throughout Florida and Pennsylvania, so it’s really exciting to help this top-notch retailer enter the New York City market with a new store on Staten Island,” said Brian Katz, CEO, Katz & Associates. “We are actively seeking locations in all of the other boroughs and expect to have more exciting news soon.”

Hobby Lobby has more than 900 stores across the nation. Each store offers over 70,000 crafting and home decor products including floral, fabric, needle art, custom framing, baskets, home accents, wearable art, arts and crafts, jewelry making, scrapbooking, and paper crafting supplies.
