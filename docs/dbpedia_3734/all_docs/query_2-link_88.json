Connect with students and faculty who share your passions and drive to investigate the challenges that face society today. Live in one of the world's most intellectually dynamic cities, New York City.\n\nExplore more\n\nProgressive since our founding, The New School for Social Research has upheld The New School's legendary tradition of challenging orthodoxy.\n\nOn May 16, 2024, NSSR honored our fall 2023 and spring and summer 2024 master's, PhD, and Graduate Certificate graduates at our annual Recognition Ceremony. All NSSR graduates present, as well as the Outstanding MA Graduate Award and Dissertation Award recipients, were recognized and called up by name. Congratulations, all!\n\nDe Haan, an Anthropology PhD student, is writing his dissertation on activism among members of the Black communities in Suriname, Curaçao, and the Netherlands, who are arguing for reparations for slavery and colonialism. The fellowship’s stipend will support de Haan’s travel to the three countries and compensate the community members he interviews and works with.\n\nThe prestigious grant will help support Pisano, a professor of politics, as she writes her next book, which tells the story of a single street in Eastern Europe under fascism, state socialism, and neoliberal democracy. This small space raises big questions about political and economic change and the way people negotiate the question of who belongs."
