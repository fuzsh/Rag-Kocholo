        "text": "RIYADH: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received a written message from the President of Guinea Mamadi Doumbouya on Tuesday, Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nThe message addressed relations between Saudi Arabia and Guinea and ways to enhance coordination and consultation in various fields.\n\nThe letter was received by Saudi Deputy Foreign Minister Waleed Al-Khuraiji during a meeting with Guinea’s Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Ismael Nabe in Riyadh.\n\nDuring the meeting, the officials discussed relations between their countries and regional and international developments.\n\nRIYADH: The Cabinet on Tuesday reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s support for efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nIt stressed the need to move forward to end Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land, achieve peace, and give the Palestinians their legitimate rights, Saudi Press Agency reported.\n\nThe Cabinet also praised the efforts and contributions of the Arab Parliament at international forums, and affirmed the Kingdom’s keenness on consolidating cooperation with Arab countries in a way that contributes to consolidating security and stability and provides conditions for development and sustainable growth.\n\nThe Cabinet also discussed the meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Speaker of the Arab Parliament Adel bin Abdulrahman Al-Asoumi in Jeddah last week during which Al-Asoumi presented Prince Mohammed with the Leader’s Medal.\n\nThe medal was awarded in appreciation of Prince Mohammed’s “pioneering positions in defending Arab issues and strengthening joint Arab action.”\n\nThe Cabinet also reviewed the Kingdom’s efforts to enhance its global efforts in the field of sustainability and environmental conservation.\n\nThese efforts include working to develop and expand royal reserves according to strategic targets that focus on protecting wildlife and supporting afforestation and ecotourism.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia condemned on Tuesday repeated Israeli incursions at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem, the foreign ministry said.\n\nThe condemnation came after Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir led hundreds of Israelis into the compound on Tuesday and performed prayers marking a Jewish holiday.\n\nIn a statement, the ministry stressed the importance of respecting religious sanctities, and renewed the Kingdom’s warning against the continuation of these violations of international law and the historical status of Jerusalem.\n\nIt also warned against provoking millions of Muslims around the world, and renewed its call for the international community to assume its responsibility toward stopping ongoing Israeli violations of international law and relevant international legitimacy resolutions in Gaza.\n\nBen Gvir has often defied the Israeli government’s longstanding ban on Jewish prayer at the mosque compound.\n\nThe compound is Islam’s third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity but it is also Judaism’s holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.\n\nWhile Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.\n\nRIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Architecture and Design Commission recognized multiple projects as part of the King Salman Charter for Architecture and Urbanism Award in a ceremony this week.\n\nThe award helps to promote the King Salman Urban Charter Initiative.\n\nProjects that adopted the charter’s methodology and embodied its values were selected, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe CEO of the commission, Dr. Sumayah Al-Solaiman, expressed her gratitude and appreciation to King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their unremitting support for the architecture and design sector, which integrates with the aspirations of the leadership to build a promising future.\n\nShe also recognized Prince Badr bin Abdullah, Saudi culture minister and chairman of the commission’s board of directors, for his ongoing support and relentless efforts to promote Saudi culture both locally and globally.\n\nAl-Solaiman announced that the event would be held biennially going forward.\n\nDr. Adrian Lahoud, the dean of the school of architecture at the Royal College of Art in London, also spoke at the event.\n\nAn accompanying exhibition was inaugurated that showcased the crucial role played by King Salman during his tenure as governor of the Riyadh region.\n\nThe exhibition highlighted the King’s vision, which is deeply rooted in historical understanding and pride in the Kingdom’s identity and its geographical and social qualities. This has led to diverse solutions and architectural creativity inspired by Saudi culture, SPA’s report noted.\n\nIt also explained the six values of the charter, along with displays of shortlisted and winning projects. It concluded with an interactive virtual experience of the charter’s book.\n\nThe award’s final shortlist included diverse projects from various regions of the Kingdom.\n\nThe judging panel selected nine projects for recognition, distributed across the award’s three categories as follows:\n\nIn the “Built Projects” category, the five projects recognized were King Abdulaziz Center for World Culture, or Ithra, in Dhahran; Banyan Tree Resort in AlUla; Dar Al-Rahmaniah Building in Al-Ghat; KAFD Grand Mosque in Riyadh; and the Innovation Tower at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology in Riyadh.\n\nKAFD DMC CEO Gautam Sashittal said: “Saudi Arabia’s architectural landscape is evolving, and KAFD is proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. From the very beginning, our vision has been to create a benchmark for architectural excellence.”\n\nWinners of the “Unbuilt Projects” category were the Sports Track project in Riyadh and the Mihrab project, which serves all regions of the Kingdom by establishing prayer areas along travel routes.\n\nThe CEO of the Sports Boulevard Foundation said that the award “reflects the magnitude of the project’s achievement through its design and application of local identity and Salmani architecture in all its elements.”\n\nIn the category for university student projects, the winners were Abdulaziz Al-Talib from King Saud University who proposed a design for the King Salman Global Academy for Arabic Language, and Sadeem Al-Jibreen from the University of Sheffield in the UK, who proposed a design for the Contemporary Neighborhood project."
