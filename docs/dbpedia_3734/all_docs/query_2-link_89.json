With abbreviations, be guided by pronunciation: eg an LSE student\n\nA*\n\n(A-level and GCSE) not A-star\n\nA&E\n\naccident and emergency; in the US, it’s ER (emergency room)\n\nabattoir\n\nAbbas, Mahmoud\n\npresident of the Palestinian Authority\n\nabbeys\n\ntake initial cap, eg Westminster Abbey\n\nAbbottabad\n\ncity in Pakistan where Osama bin Laden lived and died\n\nabbreviations and acronyms\n\nDo not use full points in abbreviations, or spaces between initials, including those in proper names: IMF, mph, eg, 4am, M&S, No 10, AN Wilson, WH Smith, etc.\n\nUse all capitals if an abbreviation is pronounced as the individual letters (an initialism): BBC, CEO, US, VAT, etc; if it is an acronym (pronounced as a word) spell out with initial capital, eg Nasa, Nato, Unicef, unless it can be considered to have entered the language as an everyday word, such as awol, laser and, more recently, asbo, pin number and sim card. Note that pdf and plc are lowercase.\n\nIf an abbreviation or acronym is to be used more than once in a piece, put it in brackets at first mention: so Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), seasonal affective disorder (Sad); alternatively, use the abbreviation with a brief description, eg the conservation charity the RSPB. Remember that our international online readership will not necessarily be aware of even well-known UK abbreviations. If an organisation is mentioned only once, it is not necessary to give its abbreviation or acronym.\n\nCap up single letters in such expressions as C-list, F-word, “the word assassin contains four Ss”, etc\n\nAbd el-Fattah, Alaa\n\nBritish-Egyptian democracy activist jailed in Egypt\n\nabdicate\n\nrenounce high office\n\nabnegate\n\nrenounce privileges, deny oneself\n\nabrogate\n\nrepeal, abolish\n\narrogate\n\ntake or claim (something) for oneself without justification\n\nabjure\n\nrenounce\n\nadjure\n\nurge\n\nAboriginal Australians\n\nshould be identified by their country or language groups at first mention if known, eg a Wiradjuri-Yorta Yorta man, a Noongar-Badimaya woman – or take your cue from how they identify themselves. The term “Aborigine” is outdated and offensive; Aboriginal should only be used as an adjective. Indigenous Australians is an umbrella term that covers both Aboriginal people from the Australian mainland and Torres Strait Islanders\n\nabortion\n\nUse pro-choice, not pro-abortion; and use anti-abortion, not pro-life. Anti-choice can be used when talking about opposition to all reproductive rights, including abortion, birth control, family planning etc.\n\nIn reference to US legislation, six-week abortion ban is preferable to foetal heartbeat bill, unless quoting someone talking about the “heartbeat bill”\n\nabscess\n\nabsorb\n\nbut absorption\n\nAbu Akleh, Shireen\n\na journalist for Al Jazeera who was shot and killed in the West Bank\n\nabuse\n\nsee individual entries on child sexual abuse, domestic abuse/family abuse and sexual abuse\n\nabysmal\n\nabyss\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nor Oscars\n\nindividual awards are lowercase, eg best actor award, Oscar for best picture\n\nAfter first mention, abbreviate the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to the Academy\n\na cappella\n\nItalian for “in the style of the church”, ie unaccompanied singing\n\nAcas\n\nthe Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, at first mention; thereafter just Acas\n\naccents\n\nUse on French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Irish Gaelic words (but not anglicised French words such as cafe, apart from exposé, lamé, résumé, roué). People’s names, in whatever language, should also be given appropriate accents where known. Thus: “Arsène Wenger was on holiday in Bogotá with Rafa Benítez”\n\nAccenture\n\nformerly Andersen Consulting; the new name was devised by an employee from “accent on the future”\n\naccess\n\nhas been known as contact since the 1989 Children Act\n\naccession council\n\nat which a new king or queen is formally proclaimed\n\naccident\n\nTake care in using this term in relation to traffic incidents; crash or collision may be better if the full circumstances are not known\n\naccommodate, accommodation\n\naccordion\n\nnot accordian\n\nachilles heel, achilles tendon\n\nacknowledgment\n\nnot acknowledgement\n\nacres\n\nUse hectares, with acres in brackets, rounded up or down, eg the field measured 25 hectares (62 acres).\n\nYou multiply hectares by 2.47 to convert to acres, or acres by 0.4 to convert to hectares\n\nacronyms\n\nSee Abbreviations and acronyms\n\nact\n\nuppercase when using the full name, eg Criminal Justice Act 1998, Official Secrets Act; but lowercase on second reference, eg “the act”, and when speaking in more general terms, eg “we need a radical freedom of information act”; bills remain lowercase until passed into law\n\nAction on Hearing Loss\n\nformerly known as the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID)\n\nactor\n\nUse for both male and female actors; do not use actress except when in the name of an award, eg Oscar for best actress. The Guardian’s view is that actress comes into the same category as authoress, comedienne, manageress, “lady doctor”, “male nurse” and similar obsolete terms that date from a time when professions were largely the preserve of one sex (usually men). As Whoopi Goldberg put it in an interview with the paper: “An actress can only play a woman. I’m an actor – I can play anything.”\n\nThere is normally no need to differentiate between the sexes – and if there is, the words male and female are perfectly adequate: Lady Gaga won a Brit in 2010 for best international female artist, not artiste, chanteuse, or songstress.\n\nAs always, use common sense: a piece about the late film director Carlo Ponti was edited to say that in his early career he was “already a man with a good eye for pretty actors ...” As the readers’ editor pointed out in the subsequent clarification: “This was one of those occasions when the word ‘actresses’ might have been used”\n\nAD, BC\n\nAD goes before the date (AD64), BC goes after (300BC); both go after the century, eg second century AD, fourth century BC\n\nadaptation\n\nnot adaption\n\nadapter\n\nsomeone who adapts; adaptor plug\n\nadblocker, adblocking\n\naddendum\n\nplural addendums\n\nLatinate -um neuter endings that are a part of the language (eg stadium) take an -s plural. Exceptions: bacteria, which retain the Latin plural and take a plural verb, as do media, but note that spiritualists are mediums\n\naddresses\n\nlike this: 90 York Way, London N1 9GU\n\nAdidas\n\ninitial cap, although adidas is lc in the company logo\n\nadministration\n\nthe Obama administration, etc\n\nadmissible, inadmissible\n\nnot -able\n\nadmit\n\nTake care – as a reader put it when we referred to Tory MPs who “admitted” being gay: “Admit in modern English is almost exclusively used when conceding or confessing something negative and/or of which one is or should be ashamed. Please be more careful. Language can offend.” Quite.\n\nThe former Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee urged reporters not to “hide their biases and emotions behind subtly pejorative words” such as admit\n\nad nauseam\n\nnot ad nauseum\n\nadoption\n\nMention that children are adopted only when relevant to the story: a reader points out that “explicitly calling attention to adoptions in this way suggests that adoption is not as good, and not as real a relationship, as having a child normally”. So say biological father, biological family rather than “real father”, “real family”, etc\n\nAdrenalin\n\nTM; a brand of adrenaline\n\nadrenaline\n\nhormone that increases heart rate and blood pressure, extracted from animals or synthesised for medical uses\n\nadvance bookings\n\nrather than “advanced bookings”. Or you could just say “bookings”\n\nAdvent calendar\n\nadverse\n\nunfavourable; averse reluctant\n\n“He was averse to crossing the Irish Sea in such adverse conditions”\n\nadviser\n\nnot advisor\n\nAdvisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba)\n\nadvocate\n\nmember of the Scottish bar (not a barrister)\n\naeroplane\n\nin UK; airplane in US; plane works well anywhere\n\naffect/effect\n\nexhortations in the style guide had no effect (noun) on the number of mistakes; the level of mistakes was not affected (verb) by exhortations in the style guide; we hope to effect (verb) a change in this\n\naffidavit\n\na written declaration made on oath, so “sworn affidavit” is tautologous\n\naffinity\n\nwith or between, not to or for\n\nAfghans\n\nthe people of Afghanistan\n\nafghani\n\nthe currency of Afghanistan\n\naficionado\n\nplural aficionados\n\nAfrica\n\nis a continent made up of more than 50 countries. When writing about people from those countries be sure to locate them precisely in their town, city, country etc. Avoid simply saying they are African or from Africa\n\nAfrican American\n\nAfrican-Caribbean\n\nnot Afro-Caribbean\n\nAfrikaans\n\nlanguage\n\nAfrikaner\n\nperson\n\nAfrikander\n\ncattle breed\n\nafro\n\nhairstyle\n\nAfrobeat or Afrobeats?\n\nthese are distinct music genres which often get mixed up. The first was pioneered by Fela Kuti in the 1960s and is a mix of west African musical styles, such as fuji music and highlife, with American funk and jazz; the second is an umbrella term for 21st-century west African pop music, combining Ghanaian and Nigerian pop music with western rap influences.\n\nafterlife, aftermath\n\nageing\n\nages\n\nKamala Harris, 56 (not “aged 56”); Freddie Bawden Marsh, nine.\n\na 62-year-old man; a 62-year-old; 62 years old.\n\nthe woman was in her 20s (but twentysomething, thirtysomething, etc)\n\nBe clear when referring to age groups, such as the over-80s or under-16s, as sometimes these groupings don’t include the people who are actually 80 or 16; if the group does include them, a formulation such as 80 or over, or 16 and above can be clearer for readers. In headlines it is OK to use the shorter description when necessary\n\nagenda\n\nplural in origin, but singular in use: “agendum” is simply not on anyone’s agenda\n\nAge UK\n\ncharity formed by the merger of Age Concern and Help the Aged in 2009\n\naggravate\n\nUsing this word to mean annoy, rather than make worse, really aggravates some people. Good. Both meanings have been around for more than 400 years, and there is no good reason why both should not be acceptable now.\n\nShe only wanted to threaten him and aggravate him ...\n\nWilkie Collins, The Woman in White (1860)\n\nAggregateIQ\n\naggro\n\nabbreviation of aggravation, and spelt thus despite the once popular terrace chant “A, G, A-G-R, A-G-R-O: agro!”\n\nAGM\n\na-ha\n\nband from Norway; A-ha!

Unesco guidelines state: “This term implies that there are varying stages of Aids ... People have Aids only when they present with an Aids-defining illness”\n\nairbase, aircraft, aircrew, airdrop, airfield, airlift, airmail, airshow, airspace, airstrike, airstrip, airtime\n\nair fare, air force, air raid\n\naircraft carrier\n\naircraft designations\n\nusually with hyphens after initials, eg B-52, MiG-23\n\nAir Force One\n\nUS president’s jet\n\nair hostess\n\ncabin attendant or flight attendant, please\n\nairports\n\nHeathrow, Gatwick, Stansted (normally no need to say airport); Liverpool John Lennon airport, Schiphol airport, etc\n\nair vice-marshal\n\nAKA\n\nalso known as\n\nakimbo\n\nSee arms akimbo\n\nal-\n\n(note lc and hyphen) before an Arabic name means “the” so try to avoid writing “the al- ...” where possible\n\nSee Arabic names\n\nal-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade\n\nal-Aqsa mosque\n\nnot the Aqsa mosque, or the al-Aqsa mosque. Not to be confused in pictures with the nearby Dome of the Rock. The mosque’s dome is silver-grey, whereas the Dome of the Rock, an Islamic shrine, has a large golden dome. Both buildings are located in occupied East Jerusalem, at the holy site known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, and to Jews as the Temple Mount, also sometimes referred to as al-Aqsa mosque compound\n\nAlastair or Alistair?\n\nAlastair Campbell (spin doctor)\n\nAlastair Cook (cricketer)\n\nAlastair Hetherington (late Guardian editor)\n\nAlastair Stewart (broadcaster)\n\nAlistair Cooke (late BBC and Guardian journalist)\n\nAlistair Darling (politician)\n\nAlistair MacLean (late novelist)\n\nAlistair McGowan (impressionist)\n\nAleister Crowley (late satanist)\n\nalbinism\n\nAvoid referring to people with albinism as albinos, instead say “a man with albinism” or “Jane Doe, who has albinism”\n\nAlbright, Madeleine\n\nformer US secretary of state\n\nAlcott, Louisa May\n\n(1832-88) American author of Little Women\n\nA-levels\n\nAl Fayed, Mohamed\n\nformer owner of Harrods and Fulham FC (Fayed after first mention; Mr Fayed if honorific is needed); the son who died in Paris in 1997 was Dodi Fayed\n\nAlfonsín, Raúl\n\n(1927-2009) president of Argentina from 1983-89\n\nalfresco\n\nalgae\n\nplural of alga\n\nal-Hawl\n\nnot al-Hol for the camp in northern Syria\n\nal-Houthi, Abdulmalik\n\nleader of the Houthi movement in Yemen. Call him Houthi at second mention\n\nAli, Muhammad\n\nwas Cassius Clay until 1964\n\nalibi\n\nbeing somewhere else; not synonymous with excuse\n\nalice band\n\nas worn by Alice in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) and more recently David Beckham\n\nAlice books\n\nAlice’s Adventures in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll (Charles Lutwidge Dodgson), was published in 1865; its sequel, which followed six years later, is called Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There.\n\nNote that they are not called “Alice in Wonderland” and “Alice Through the Looking-Glass”\n\nA-list\n\netc, but to refer to “C-list celebrities” and its variations has become tedious. An edition of G2 referred to “D-list celebrities” and, less than hilariously, in a separate piece about the same reality TV show, “Z-list celebrities”\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nalkyl nitrite\n\nnot nitrate; commonly known as poppers\n\nAllah\n\nArabic for “the God”. Both words refer to the same concept: there is no major difference between God in the Old Testament and Allah in Islam. Therefore it makes sense to talk about “God” in an Islamic context and to use “Allah” in quotations or for literary effect\n\nAllahu Akbar\n\n“God is greatest”\n\nAllawi, Ayad\n\nIraqi politician\n\nAllende, Isabel\n\nChilean author; her father was a cousin of Salvador Allende\n\nAllende, Salvador\n\nChilean president, overthrown and killed in 1973\n\nallies\n\nsecond world war allies, the allied invasion, etc\n\nall mouth and trousers\n\nnot “all mouth and no trousers”\n\nall right\n\nhas traditionally been regarded as right, and alright as not all right (although the 1965 Who song, much loved by generations of headline writers and still widely quoted today, was The Kids are Alright).\n\nKingsley Amis in The King’s English said alright was “gross, crass, coarse and to be avoided” but admitted this was “a rule without a reason”.\n\nNote, however, the difference between “she got the answers all right” and “she got the answers, alright!”\n\nAll Souls College\n\nOxford, no apostrophe\n\nall together\n\nas one united body: “We are all in it together”\n\naltogether\n\ncompletely, totally: “That’s an altogether different matter”\n\n“alt-right”\n\nuse once and in quotes at first mention; use far right at any subsequent mentions. Note: far right (noun) and far-right (adjective). More specific descriptions can be used where relevant when mentioning individuals associated with the movement, but such descriptions should be evidence-based.\n\nal-Maliki, Nouri\n\n(not Nuri) became prime minister of Iraq in 2006\n\nAlmo\n\narm’s-length management organisation\n\nAlmodóvar, Pedro\n\nSpanish film-maker\n\nalpha male\n\nal-Qaida\n\nit means “the base”\n\nal-Quds\n\nforce of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps; not Quds, Qods\n\nal-Sadr, Moqtada\n\ncreator of the Mahdi army, or as the magazine Red Pepper described it: “Moqtada al-Sadr’s not-so-barmy army”\n\nalsatian\n\ndog\n\nAlsatian\n\nperson from Alsace\n\nal-Shabaab\n\nIslamist insurgency group in Somalia; it means “the youth”. Singular, not plural\n\nalso\n\noften redundant\n\nalter ego\n\nnot “altar ego”, as we have been known to spell it\n\nalternative\n\nnormally a choice between two courses of action; if there are more than two, option or choice may be preferred; beware the trend to use “alternate” instead of alternative: in a piece about French politics we wrote “in this juddering alternate reality …”\n\nalumna (female), alumnus (male)\n\nplural alumni, or alumnae for all-female institutions; in the UK graduate is preferable\n\nal-Zaidi, Muntazer\n\nIraqi journalist who served a jail sentence for throwing his shoes at the then US president, George Bush\n\nAlzheimer’s disease\n\nAmazon\n\nnormally no need for com or co.uk\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nAmazon Prime Video\n\nfor the TV package, although these days it prefers to call itself simply Prime Video\n\nambassador\n\nlc, eg the British ambassador to Washington; “ambassador, you are spoiling us” has become a headline cliche\n\nambience\n\nnot ambiance\n\nambiguity\n\na common problem in headlines when the subject is omitted from the past tense of a verb, as in this example from the paper:\n\nWestworld extras allegedly asked to participate in ‘graphic sexual situations’\n\nDid they allegedly ask, or were they allegedly asked? A simple “were” before “asked” would have fixed this. Similarly:\n\nLabour warned of financial crash (did someone warn Labour of an impending crash, or did Labour warn someone else?)\n\nTories paid millions to avoid tax\n\nHere not only does the reader have to ask whether the Tories paid millions or were paid millions, but also whether they paid millions of pounds or millions of people, and whether the Tories’ aim was to avoid tax or to enable the millions to avoid tax. This is very poor editing\n\nambulance services\n\nThese are NHS trusts, so lc for everything that is generic, eg London ambulance service, East of England ambulance service, South East Coast ambulance service\n\namendments\n\nto the US constitution like this: fifth amendment, 18th amendment, etc\n\nAmerica, Americans\n\nthe country is generally the United States or US, although its citizens are Americans; we should remember that America includes all of North, Central and South America\n\n“America first”\n\nA phrase denounced by the Anti-Defamation League for its links to 1940s Nazi sympathisers\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union\n\nnot American Civil Rights Union\n\nAmerican English\n\nFollow US spellings for proper nouns, eg Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Defense, Labor Day, One World Trade Center, Ann Arbor, Pearl Harbor, World Health Organization\n\nAmerican universities\n\nTake care: “University of X” is not the same as “X University”; most states have two large public universities, eg University of Kentucky and Kentucky State University, University of Illinois and Illinois State University, etc.\n\nDo not call Johns Hopkins University “John Hopkins” or Stanford University “Stamford”\n\nAmerica’s Cup\n\nsailing trophy named after the schooner America, its first winner\n\nAmhrán na bhFiann\n\nIrish national anthem\n\nAmicus\n\ntrade union formed by a merger between the AEEU and MSF, now part of Unite after a further merger with the TGWU\n\namid\n\nnot amidst.\n\n“James warned, however, that the second half of the year was likely to prove more challenging overall amid a weak consumer backdrop.”\n\nThings fall against a backdrop, not amid one. If something is amid the backdrop, it’s part of it, and thus completely unremarkable. Some cliches make the news sound tired; this one makes the news sound as if it’s not news at all\n\namok\n\nnot amuck\n\namong\n\nnot amongst\n\namong or between?\n\nWhatever you may have been told, between is not limited to two parties. It is appropriate when the relationship is essentially reciprocal: fighting between the many peoples of Yugoslavia, treaties between European countries, etc; among belongs to distributive relationships: shared among, etc\n\namount or number?\n\namount refers to a quantity, number to something that can be counted, eg an enormous amount of energy was exerted by a small number of people\n\nampersand\n\nUse in company names when the company does: Johnson & Johnson, Marks & Spencer, P&O, etc, but use “and” in the names of government departments and agencies: Department of Work and Pensions, Advanced Research and Invention Agency etc\n\nanaesthetic\n\nanalysis\n\nplural analyses\n\nanarchism\n\na political philosophy that advocates stateless societies, holding the state to be undesirable, unnecessary and harmful.\n\nThe term “anarchist” is bandied about carelessly, often used by politicians and the media to denigrate opponents of the status quo, and should be used with care; “self-styled anarchist” should be avoided altogether\n\nancestors\n\nprecede descendants; we frequently manage to get them the wrong way round\n\nand/or\n\nThis is horrible. Make your mind up and say either “and” or “or” – whichever is more appropriate. The same applies to the phrase “if and when”\n\nAndalucía\n\nAnderson shelter\n\nnot Andersen\n\n… And You Will Know Us By The Trail Of Dead\n\nAngkor Wat\n\nAngkor Wat is only one of the 100 or so temples of Angkor, albeit the best known (“wat” means temple)\n\nAnglesey\n\nAlways also include its Welsh name, Ynys Môn, possibly in brackets at first mention. Anglesey is the name of the island; Isle of Anglesey is the name of its county, which also includes nearby Holy Island, and Ynys Môn is the name of the UK parliament and Senedd constituency that covers the same area. Ynys Môn is the Welsh name for both the island and the county\n\nanglicise, anglophile, anglophone\n\nanimals\n\npronoun “it” unless gender established\n\nAnimal breeds are usually lowercase, eg gloucestershire old spot, friesian, belted galloway, shetland pony, but note English longhorn, Welsh cob, British saddleback\n\nannex\n\nverb; annexe noun; I am going to annex the annexe for the afternoon\n\nanniversaries\n\nfirst anniversary, 10th anniversary etc; not one-year anniversary, 10-year anniversary. There is no such thing as a six-month anniversary\n\nanorexic\n\nis not a superlative of thin. Anorexia is an illness. Like schizophrenia, it should not be used as a cheap and lazy metaphor. Anyone who thinks of using a phrase such as “positively anorexic” should think again\n\nAnsaphone\n\nTM; use answering machine or answerphone\n\nantenatal\n\nantenna\n\n(insect) plural antennae; (radio) plural antennas\n\nanti-ballistic missile treaty\n\nantichrist\n\nanticipate\n\nPurists say this should not be used to mean expect, but expressions like “they did not anticipate any trouble” are now normal usage\n\nanticlimax\n\nantidepressants\n\nantidisestablishmentarianism\n\nposition adopted by those opposed to the disestablishment of the Church of England.\n\nNot a good headline word\n\nantihero\n\nantimalarial\n\nantipodean, antipodes\n\nterms Australians themselves rarely use; avoid\n\nantisemitic, antisemitism\n\nno hyphen: it does not mean “anti-Semitic”\n\nantislavery\n\nantisocial\n\nanti-vaxxer\n\na person who is opposed to vaccinations\n\nanti-war\n\nany more\n\nPlease do not say “anymore” any more\n\nap Iorwerth, Rhun\n\nleader of Plaid Cymru. Lowercase a, whether you include his first name or not. So: “Speaking in Cardiff, ap Iorwerth said …”\n\napex\n\nplural apexes\n\napostrofly\n\n“an insect that lands at random on the printed page, depositing an apostrophe wherever it lands” according to the Guardian’s former readers’ editor\n\napostrophes\n\nused to indicate a missing letter or letters (can’t, we’d) or a possessive (David’s book).\n\nDon’t let anyone tell you that apostrophes don’t matter and we would be better off without them. Consider these four phrases, each of which means something different:\n\nmy sister’s friend’s books (refers to one sister and her friend).\n\nmy sister’s friends’ books (one sister with lots of friends).\n\nmy sisters’ friend’s books (more than one sister, and their friend).\n\nmy sisters’ friends’ books (more than one sister, and their friends).\n\nThe possessive in words and names ending in S normally takes an apostrophe followed by a second S (Jones’s, James’s), but be guided by pronunciation and use the plural apostrophe where it helps: Mephistopheles’, Waters’, Hedges’ rather than Mephistopheles’s, Waters’s, Hedges’s.\n\nPlural nouns that do not end in S take an apostrophe and S in the possessive: children’s games, old folk’s home, people’s republic, etc.\n\nPhrases such as butcher’s knife, collector’s item, cow’s milk, goat’s cheese, pig’s blood, hangman’s noose, writer’s cramp, etc are treated as singular.\n\nUse apostrophes in phrases such as two days’ time, 12 years’ imprisonment and six weeks’ holiday, where the time period (two days) modifies a noun (time), but not in nine months pregnant or three weeks old, where the time period is adverbial (modifying an adjective such as pregnant or old) – if in doubt, test with a singular such as one day’s time, one month pregnant.\n\nProper names that contain an apostrophe stay the same in the possessive: McDonald’s burgers may be delicious but Sainsbury’s are just as good.\n\nSome shops use an apostrophe, wrongly, to indicate a plural (“pea’s”), but will generally omit the apostrophe when one is actually required (“new seasons asparagus”), a phenomenon sometimes referred to as the greengrocer’s (or grocer’s) apostrophe. Try to avoid this\n\napp\n\nan application for, typically, a mobile phone\n\nappal\n\nbut as the former Prince of Wales might have said, it really is appalling\n\napparatchik\n\nappeal\n\nIn British English you appeal against a decision, verdict, etc, you do not “appeal the verdict”. After we reported on 9 June 2010 that a convicted murderer “successfully appealed the sentence”, a despairing reader wrote: “This usage seems to be occurring more and more, sometimes even in headlines. Do Guardian journalists not read the style guide?” Not all of them, evidently\n\nappendix\n\nplural appendices\n\nApple\n\nno longer Apple Computer\n\napples\n\nlc: cox’s orange pippin, golden delicious, granny smith, etc\n\nappraise\n\nto evaluate\n\napprise\n\nto inform\n\nApril Fools’ Day\n\nalso known, less commonly nowadays, as All Fools’ Day; an individual prank, or the victim of one, is an April fool, so you might say “one of the greatest April fools was the Guardian’s San Serriffe issue of 1977 – it made April fools of all who were taken in”\n\napropos\n\nUsed most commonly to mean “with regard to”, it does not need a preposition, so “apropos your question ... “ But note the idiomatic “apropos of nothing ...” which means something like “changing the subject” or “incidentally”.\n\nUsed to mean “pertinent” or “relevant to”, now rather rare, you might say “the thought was apropos to this” or, even more quaintly, “the point was apropos”.\n\nThe French idiom “à propos de bottes” (“with regard to boots”), meaning without rhyme or reason, was used by, among others, George Orwell\n\naquarium\n\nplural aquariums\n\nArab\n\nBoth a noun and an adjective, and the preferred adjective when referring to Arab things in general, eg Arab history, Arab traditions. Arabic usually refers to the language and literature: “the Arabic press” means newspapers written in Arabic, while “the Arab press” would include newspapers produced by Arabs in other languages.\n\nThere is no simple definition of an Arab. At an international level, the 22 members of the Arab League can safely be described as Arab countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. At a human level, there are substantial groups within those countries – the Berbers of north Africa and the Kurds, for example – who do not regard themselves as Arabs.\n\nArabic names\n\nThough Arabic has only three vowels – a, i and u – it has several consonants that have no equivalent in the Roman alphabet. For instance, there are two kinds of s, d and t. There are also two glottal sounds. This means there are dozens of ways of writing the former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s name in English, and a reasonable argument can be made for adopting almost any of them. With no standard approach to transliteration agreed by the western media, we must try to balance consistency, comprehensibility and familiarity – which often puts a strain on all three.\n\nTypically, Arabs have at least three names. In some cases the first or second name may be the one that is most used, and this does not imply familiarity (Arabs often address foreigners politely as “Mr John” or “Dr David”). Often Arabs also have familiar names that have no connection with the names on their identity cards: a man might become known after the birth of his first son as “Abu Ahmad”, and a woman as “Umm Ahmad”, the father or mother of Ahmad (eg the Palestinian leader Ahmed Qureia is commonly known as Abu Ala).\n\nWhere a particular spelling has become widely accepted through usage we should retain it. Where an individual with links to the west has clearly adopted a particular spelling of his or her own name, we should respect that. For breaking news and stories using names for which we have no established style, we take the lead given by Reuters wire copy.\n\nNote also that names in some parts of the Arab world have become gallicised, while others have become anglicised, eg the leading Egyptian film director Youssef Chahine uses a French spelling instead of the English transliteration, Shaheen.\n\nSome guidelines (for use particularly where there is no established transliteration)\n\nal-\n\nMeans “the”. In names it is not capitalised, eg Ahmad al-Saqqaf, and can be dropped after the first mention (Mr Saqqaf). For placenames we drop it altogether. Sometimes it appears as as- or ash- or ad- or ul-: these should be ignored and can be safely rewritten as al-. But some Arabs, including Syrians and Egyptians, prefer to use el- in place of al-. Exceptions: by convention, Allah (al-Lah, literally “the God”) is written as one word and capitalised; and in Saudi royal names, Al Saud is correct (in this case, “al” is actually “aal” and does not mean “the”).\n\nabdul, abu and bin\n\nThese are not self-contained names, but are connected to the name that follows: abdul means “slave of … “ and so cannot correctly be used on its own. There are standard combinations, “slave of the merciful one”, “slave of the generous one”, etc, which all indicate that the person is a servant of God. In transliteration, “abd” (slave) is lowercase, eg Ahmad abd al-Rahman al-Saqqaf, except when used at the start of a name; abu (father of) and bin (son of) are similar. When they appear in the middle of a name they should be lower case and are used in combination with the following part of the name: Faisal abu Ahmad al-Saqqaf, Faisal bin Ahmad al-Saqqaf. Despite the above, some people are actually known as “Abdul”. This is more common among non-Arab Muslims. And some Arabs run “abd” or “abu” into the following word, eg the writer Abdelrahman Munif.\n\nMuhammad\n\nOur style for the prophet’s name and for most Muhammads living in Arab countries, though where someone’s preferred spelling is known we respect it, eg Mohamed Al Fayed, Mohamed ElBaradei\n\nMuhandis/Mohandes, Qadi\n\nBe wary of names where the first word is Muhandis or Qadi: these are honorary titles, meaning engineer and judge respectively\n\nEuropean surnames of Arabic origin\n\nThe guidelines above do not apply in examples such as the French labour minister, Myriam El Khomri. She is French born and only has one surname, which appears on her birth certificate and passport, written in the Latin alphabet; there is no other spelling. So she should be referred to as Myriam El Khomri at first mention and El Khomri thereafter.\n\nSimilarly, the two 2016 Brussels airport suicide bombers, Ibrahim and Khalid El Bakraoui, were Belgian born. The Belgian legal system and prosecutors refer to them by the surname El Bakraoui, and we should too\n\nArab spring\n\nAran Island\n\nis off Co Donegal and the Aran Islands off Co Galway in western Ireland; the Isle of Arran is the largest island in the Firth of Clyde in Scotland. Aran sweaters, whether Irish or Scottish, come with an initial cap A\n\narcane\n\nesoteric; archaic antiquated\n\narchbishops\n\nIt is not normally necessary to use their formal title, which for both Anglicans and Catholics is Most Rev: so Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, at first mention, thereafter Welby or the archbishop (except in leading articles, where he is Mr Welby); Vincent Nichols, the archbishop of Westminster, on first mention, subsequently Nichols or the archbishop\n\narchdeacon\n\nthe Ven Paul Olive, archdeacon of Farringdon, at first mention; thereafter Olive, or the archdeacon\n\narchery\n\narrows are shot, rather than fired; and if they hit the centre of the target, it is a gold rather than a bullseye\n\narchetype or stereotype?\n\nAn archetype is a perfect or typical specimen, an original model or pattern, or prototype.\n\nA stereotype is based on simplistic generalisations about a particular group. So the matriarch in a typical Woody Allen film might be described as a stereotypical, not archetypal, Jewish mother\n\narchipelago\n\nplural archipelagos\n\narchitect or designer?\n\nThe title of architect is protected under UK law and should only be used to describe someone who is registered as such. If someone works on building design but is not registered as an architect they are most likely to be called a designer, eg Thomas Heatherwick\n\narch-rival\n\nan arch rival would mean something different\n\narctic fox\n\nbut Arctic Monkeys\n\nArdoyne\n\n(Belfast), not “the Ardoyne”\n\narea of outstanding natural beauty (AONB)\n\nArgentina, Argentinian\n\narguably\n\nunarguably one of the most overused words in the language\n\nargyle sweater\n\nArmageddon\n\narmed forces, armed services\n\nthe army, the British army, the navy, but Royal Navy, Royal Air Force or RAF\n\narmed forces ranks\n\nUse as abbreviated below on first mention, then just surname, eg Col Tommy Smith, thereafter Smith.\n\nArmy: Gen, Lt Gen, Maj Gen, Brig, Col, Lt Col, Maj, Capt, Lt, 2Lt, OCdt, WOI, WOII, SSgt, CSgt, Sgt, CoH, L/CoH, Cpl, Bdr, L/Cpl, L/Bdr, Pte\n\nNavy: Adm, V-Adm, R Adm, Capt, Cmdr, Lt Cmdr, Lt, SLt, Mid, OCdt, WOI, WOII, CPO, PO, LH, AB, Mne\n\nRAF: Gp Capt, Wg Cmdr, Sqn Ldr, Flt Lt, Fg Off, Plt Off, MAcr, WO, Ft Sgt, Ch Tech, Sgt, Cpl, Jr Tech, L/Cpl, SAC, LAC, AC\n\nDo not abbreviate: Field Marshal, Admiral of the Fleet, Commodore, Marshal of the RAF, Air Chief Marshal, Air Marshal, Air Vice-Marshal, Air Commodore\n\nArmistice Day\n\nbut the armistice\n\narms akimbo\n\nhands on hips, elbows out; it is surprising how often the phrase “legs akimbo” turns up in the paper, “suggesting that such a posture exists, but lacks a word to define it”, as David McKie wrote.\n\nThe radical theatre group in the BBC TV comedy series The League of Gentlemen was called Legz Akimbo\n\narmy regiments\n\nfor a detailed guide to the organisation of the British army see here\n\naround\n\nabout or approximately are better, eg “about £1m” or “approximately 2,000 people”\n\naround or round?\n\nWe were driving around aimlessly all weekend; it nearly drove me round the bend\n\narranged marriages\n\nare a traditional and perfectly acceptable form of wedlock across southern Asia and within the Asian community in Britain; they should not be confused with forced marriages, which are arranged without the consent of one or both partners, and have been widely criticised\n\narse\n\nBritish English; ass American English\n\narsing about\n\nrather than arseing\n\nart movements\n\nare generally lowercase, eg art deco, art nouveau, cubism, dadaism, expressionism, gothic, impressionism, pop art, surrealism, etc, but note Bauhaus, Modern (in the sense of Modern British, to distinguish it from “modern art”, pre-Raphaelite, Romantic (to differentiate between a romantic painting and a Romantic painting)\n\nartefact\n\nartificial intelligence\n\nAI on second mention and in headlines.

The median is described as “the value below which 50% of employees fall”, ie it is the wage earned by the middle person when everyone’s wages are lined up from smallest to largest. (For even numbers there are two middle people, but you calculate the mean average of their two wages.)\n\nThe median is often a more useful guide than the mean, which can be distorted by figures at one extreme or the other\n\nawaken\n\nSay “I woke up”, “I was woken up” and so on because the forms starting with A are either considered wrong (“I was awoken”) or sound wrong (“I was awakened”).
