        "text": "What is Kafala (Sponsorship) system:\n\n(i) Saudi Arabia follows a sponsorship (Kafala) system for regulating employment of expatriate workers. Any expatriate worker entering the Kingdom requires sponsorship of a sponsor (known as Kafeel), who may be a Saudi citizen or a company, and shall remain under the sponsor’s responsibility during the term of the employment contract.\n\n(ii) No expatriate worker can leave the country, without the consent of the sponsor.\n\nWho may be employed in Saudi Arabia?\n\n(i) Any person aged between 18 and 60 years, physically fit and possessing professional and academic qualifications required by the Kingdom (provided there is a shortage of citizens holding such qualifications), or belonging to those category of workers needed by the Kingdom, may be employed in Saudi Arabia.

Nurses may be recruited by the Saudi Ministries of Health and Defence& Aviation for the Government/Military Hospitals through Indian RAs designated for this purpose. Other Hospitals in the Kingdom intending to recruit Indian nurses need to register themselves on e-Migrate portal and utilise the services of the above 6 State-run agencies only.\n\nv). Female Domestic Service Workers may be recruited only through the eMigrate portal in accordance with the provisions of the India-Saudi Arabia Bilateral Agreement on DSW Recruitment of 2014viz.(i) recruitment only through recognised RAs in both countries (ii) DSW to have completed 30 years of age, (iii) minimum wage of SR 1500/- per month, (iv) a prescribed standard employment contract is to be signed by the DSW, Saudi Employer, as well as the RAs in both countries which after its attestation by the Indian Mission after submission of a bank guarantee for US$2,500 by the sponsor, needs to be uploaded on e-Migrate portal for processing emigration clearance.\n\nCaution: It is strongly recommended that any female DSW being recruited to Saudi Arabia must insist that the RA follows the prescribed procedure of the India-Saudi bilateral agreement on DSW recruitment. In case of doubt, please contact Indian Embassy/Consulate for advice.\n\nWhat is eMigrate portal?\n\n(i) TheeMigrate portal is the electronic platform of the Government of India for automation of the emigration processes, in which all key stakeholders in the emigration lifecycle such as the Indian Missions, PGE, PoE, FEs, RAs, Emigrants and Insurance Agencies, etc. are electronically linked on a common platform.\n\n(ii) The portal allows the prospective emigrants to access the services offered by PGE including emigrant registration, emigration clearance, etc.; the RAs/FEs to apply for registration/accreditation and to raise recruitment related applications online which the internal users like Indian Missions, PoE, PGE, etc. are able to process electronically, and also provides for integration with Passport System for validation of Emigrant's passport details, online payment of application processing fee, validation of Pravasi Bharatiya Bima Yojna (PBBY) policy details, etc.\n\n(iii) All recruitment of ECR category workers including nurses and DSWs to ECR countries are to be done ONLY through the eMigrate portal.\n\nWhat is MADAD portal?\n\n(i) MADAD (MEA in Aid of Diaspora in Distress) is the consular grievance monitoring system of the Government of India.\n\n(ii) All grievances relating to labour problems such as contract violation, harassment, salary dues, repatriation; as well as transportation of mortal remains, death compensation, imprisonment abroad; tracing the missing persons abroad, etc. must be registered on the portal, giving full details including contact number of the worker, name and contact of the sponsor, as well as copies of passport, visa and employment contract.\n\n(iii) The Embassy/Consulate follows up the grievances with Saudi employers, RAs, Government authorities, labour courts, etc. for resolving the same.\n\n(iv) The status of the progress of processing of the grievances could be monitored online.\n\nHow to obtain Emigration Clearance?\n\n(i) A worker holding ECR passport, on receipt of employment offer in Saudi Arabia, is required to obtain Emigration Clearance (EC).\n\n(ii) If the recruitment is through an RA holding valid demand letter/or an accredited Project Exporter(PE)/ a Foreign Employer (FE) with a valid permit, the respective RA/PE/FE, as the case may be, shall obtain the Emigrant Clearance for the worker through the eMigrate portal.\n\n(iii) If the FE is directly recruiting the worker without the intervention of RA, the worker may apply for EC online on the eMigrate portal and the application shall be processed by the jurisdiction Protector of Emigrants (PoE) office, and the emigrant will be provided EC electronically.\n\nWhat are the important points while dealing with RA?\n\n(i) Recruiting Agentis a person/company registered with the PGE, for conducting recruitment of Indian citizens for employment abroad.\n\n(ii) One must deal ONLY with a registered Recruiting Agent (RA). Details of all Registered RAs as well as Un-Registered RAs (whose services should not be used) are available on the e-migrate website. See the original Registration Certificate issued by the PGE. Contact the office of PGE /PoEhttps://emigrate.gov.in) for clarification regarding the status of RA. Also insist upon the RA to show the Demand Letter and Power of Attorney from the FE.\n\n(iii) Exercise caution against RA misleading you about the type of job, working conditions, allowances, etc. and verify the same from a known contact. In case of doubt, seek advice fromIndian Embassy/Consulate.\n\n(iv) Be vigilant against overcharging by RA. No amount other than a service charge not exceeding 45 days’ wages, subject to a maximum Rs.20,000/- needs to be paid to RA, since as per the Saudi Labour Law, all expenses towards recruitment including visa fee, air ticket, etc. are to be borne by the employer. Make payments to the RA ONLY by DD/Cheque and obtain receipt.\n\n(v) Complaints of overcharging, cheating, etc. against RA may be addressed to eMigrate portal and PGE (email: pge[at]mea.gov.in).\n\nWho is a Foreign Employer (FE)/Sponsor/Kafeel?\n\n(i) The Foreign Employer, known as sponsor or kafeel, under whose sponsorship a worker is recruited to Saudi Arabia, could be a Saudi national or a company. Verify the credentials of the employer from a known contact, or Indian Embassy/Consulate in Saudi Arabia. Also consult the eMigrate portal to ensure that FE does not figure in the ‘Foreign employers on the Prior Approval Category (PAC)’ List, which is a watch list of FEs who are barred from recruiting from India for violation of the provisions of Emigration Act.\n\nIs there a minimum wage fixed for expatriates Saudi Arabia?\n\n(i) There is no minimum wages fixed for expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia. The Government of India has recommended Minimum Referral Wages for various categories of jobs in Saudi Arabia which may be consulted (https://emigrate.gov.in) for guidance while negotiating the Employment Contract.\n\nWhat is the importance of Employment Contract?\n\n(i) It is mandatory for all expatriate workers to have a written Employment Contract signed by the employee and the employer whereby the former undertakes to work for the latter for a wage, with a specific duration, usually two years. If no duration is specified, the duration of work permit will be deemed as the duration of the contract.\n\n(ii) It will be signed by both parties prior to applying for emigration clearance/visa.\n\n(iii) As per the Saudi labour law, the language of contract shall be Arabic, and if the contract is made in any foreign language beside Arabic, in case of dispute, the Arabic text shall prevail. It is therefore necessary to insist that Employment Contract is prepared in Arabic and English and to verify that the contents of both versions are same.\n\n(iv) The worker must understand the contents of the Employment Contract, which details the terms of the employment including entitlements and obligations of both the worker and the employer,\n\n(v) The following are the salient features of an employment contract: (1)Name of the employer, (2) place of work, (3) Job Title/Profession, (4) Duration of contract (5) Probation period, (6) Basic monthly salary, (7)Working hours, weekly rest overtime; (8) Accommodation, (9) Transportation (10) Food or food allowance, (11) Medical expenses, (12) Cost of iqama, exit/re-entry visa, exit visa etc. (13) Vacation – leave period, leave pay and cost of airfare, (15) Termination (17) End of Service Benefits, (18) Renewal of validity of contract period, (19) transportation of mortal remains in case of death (20) Mode of settlement of disputes, etc.\n\n(vi) Before signing the contract, one must carefully go through it and in case of doubt, seek clarification from the prospective employer/RA.\n\n(vii). Seek the assistance of someone knowledgeable, other than the RA, to explain the contents of Employment Contract if it is in a language not known to you.\n\nHow to get a copy of the Employment Contract before departure for Saudi Arabia?\n\n(i)As per the instructions of the Government of India, RAs must provide a copy of employment contract to the worker before his/her departure.\n\nWhat is the importance of medical test prior to processing visa?\n\n(i) A worker is required to undergo a medical test in India prior to processing visa in order to ensure that he is medically fit. After arrival in the Kingdom another medical test will be taken and during which if found unfit, the worker will be sent back to India at his cost. The mandatory medical insurance provided by the employer is very basic and does not cover treatment of serious ailments. Since it is not possible to return to India before completion of the term of contract on any grounds, including health, it is very important that one should not proceed to Saudi Arabia unless he is medically fit and free from serious ailments.\n\nVisa – Important Points\n\nWhat are the different kinds of visas in the Kingdom and how they are different from Employment Visa?\n\nWhat are the different kinds of visas in the Kingdom and how they are different from Employment Visa?\n\n(i) Employment visa- تأشيرة عمل (tashirato amal) visa - All expatriate workers must have valid Employment visa to legally work in Saudi Arabia.\n\n(ii)Please note that ‘Free Visas’ do not exist in Saudi Arabia.\n\n(iii) Family Visit visaعائلية تأشيرة زيارة (tashirato ziyarat eayila), meant for the family members of the eligible expatriates workers to visit them, and employment is prohibited on this visa.\n\n(iv) Family visa - تأشيرة زيارة (tashirato siyarat) - meant for the family members of the eligible expatriates workers to accompany (stay with) them – employment is prohibited on this visa.\n\n(v) Haj Visa تأشيرة حج(tashirato Haj)/ and Umrah visa تأشيرة عمرة(tashirato Umrah) are issued for the purpose of holy pilgrimage.\n\n(vi) Business visa - تأشيرة تجارية(tashirato tijarih) – meant for investors/business visitors.\n\n(vii) Of the above visas, except on regular Employment visa, the holders are banned from working. Those caught working on such visas are detained, fined and deported with ban on future entry into the Kingdom\n\n(viii) Business Work visa: تأشيرة تجارية للعمل (Tashirato Tijariah Lilamal) which allow companies to bring in skilled and highly specialized categories of workers for specific work of a short duration (2 months) and the holders are required to leave the Kingdom before expiry of the visa. Since this is not a regular employment visa, an emigrant worker should not accept it.\n\nWhat is the importance of verification of genuineness of visa?\n\n(i) Since a worker must work only with his sponsor and in the same profession printed on the visa, and working in a different profession or away from the sponsor is illegal, it is important to confirm that type of visa, profession and name of the Sponsor on the visa sticker tally with those in the employment contract, with the help of an Arabic knowing person/agency, other than RA/without relying on what RA claims. A sample of Saudi Employment Visa sticker and English translation of general categories of profession are shown below for reference.\n\n(ii)In order to guard against cheating by unscrupulous RAs, it is therefore important to verify before travelling to Saudi Arabia that the visa issued is a genuine employment visa. For this purpose, please contact Indian Embassy/Consulate with a copy of the visa page and contact details of sponsor/RA, for assistance.\n\n(iii).

It is important for anyone travelling to Saudi Arabia to familiarize with local rules and regulations, working and living conditions and labour laws. One may visit the websites of the Indian Embassy/Consulate and the Saudi Ministry of Labour for this purpose.\n\nDo I need to sign another Employment contract after I arrive in Saudi Arabia?\n\n(i)Neither the employee nor the employer may change the conditions of the contract without the consent of each other. As employment contracts are generally in writing, any changes must also be by written agreement.\n\n(ii) If the worker, after arrival in the Kingdom signs another employment in Arabic language, this will be treated as the valid employment contract, and the contract signed in India will cease to be valid.\n\n(iii) A worker should not agree to sign such a contract if the terms of the contract vary to his disadvantage, from the original contract signed in India. He may report it to the Ministry of Labour Toll Free Helpline Number 19911/and seek assistance from Indian Embassy/Consulate.\n\nDo I have the right to keep my passport and other documents or should I hand them over to my Employer?\n\n(i) A worker has the right to keep his passport and other documents at all times. As it is illegal for the sponsor to take custody of employees’ passports, one should not hand them over to the sponsor even for safekeeping.\n\n(ii) Any complaints in this regard may be reported to the Ministry of Labour (Toll Free Helpline Number 19911)\n\nIt must, however, be noted that even with passport in your custody, you need an exit visa for leaving the Kingdom for which the consent of the employer/sponsor is a must.\n\nWhat is Iqama:\n\n(i) Iqama (or Muqeem card) is the Residence Permit which is the proof an emigrant’s legal status in the country. It is the valid form of identification for all purposes, and without which one cannot operate banks account, ATMs, remit money, obtain mobile SIM connection/recharge, travel abroad, etc.\n\n(ii) The employer must provide Iqama within 90 day of arrival of the worker after he successfully undergoes medical test and the employer arranging a health insurance.

If not, necessary corrections need to be got done through sponsor from Jawazat office.\n\n(iv) Iqama must be carried at all times and shown to police or other authorities if demanded.\n\n(v) It is the employer’s responsibility to the cost of issue and renewal of Iqama, as well as any fines relating to its non-issuance/non-renewal.\n\nHow do I register myself with the Embassy/Consulate of India?\n\n(i) Registration with the Embassy/Consulate is very important as the Indian authorities will then know how to contact you in case of emergency.\n\n(ii) Registration can be done by sending SMS/Whatsapp or email giving your name, passport number, mobile number, visa number, location, sponsor’s name, address and contact number to the Indian Embassy, Riyadh: mobile No. (+966-544205063 /Email: sscw[at]indianembassy.org.sa) /or Consulate, Jeddah: Mobile No.+966-55612230/E-mail: iwrc[at]cgijeddah.com., or online by visiting the website of the Embassy/Consulate.\n\n(iii) Any subsequent changes to the contact details, as and when they occur may be communicated to the Embassy/Consulate.\n\n22.

They will be at the mercy of their employers and in case they face labour problems and wanting to go back to India, in the absence any grievance redressal mechanism, they could get stranded in the Kingdom indefinitely.\n\n(iv) It is, therefore, strongly recommended that all female DSW being recruited to Saudi Arabia travel to the Kingdom ONLY after completing the procedure prescribed under the DSW Agreement. In case of doubt, please contact the Indian Embassy/Consulate for advice.\n\nDriving\n\n23. What is the advisory for Indian drivers?\n\n(1.) Information on Driving Vehicles in the Kingdom\n\n(i).
