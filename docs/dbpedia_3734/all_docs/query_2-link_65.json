        "text": "Read about presumptive conditions.\n\n“Airborne hazard” refers to any sort of contaminant or potentially toxic substance that we are exposed to through the air we breathe. While on active duty, military service members may have been exposed to a variety of airborne hazards including:\n\nThe smoke and fumes from open burn pits\n\nSand, dust, and particulate matter\n\nGeneral air pollution common in certain countries\n\nFuel, aircraft exhaust, and other mechanical fumes\n\nSmoke from oil well fires\n\n×\n\nVA understands that many Veterans are especially concerned about exposure to the smoke and fumes generated by open burn pits.\n\nIn Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas of the Southwest Asia theater of military operations, open-air combustion of trash and other waste in burn pits was a common practice. The Department of Defense has now closed out most burn pits and is planning to close the remainder.\n\nDepending on a variety of factors, you may experience health effects related to this exposure. Factors that may indicate you have a greater or lesser risk of short or long-term health effects include:\n\nTypes of waste burned\n\nProximity, amount of time, and frequency of exposure\n\nWind direction and other weather-related factors\n\nPresence of other airborne or environmental hazards in the area\n\nResearchers, including experts at VA, are actively studying airborne hazards like burn pits and other military environmental exposures. Ongoing research will help us better understand potential long-term health effects and provide you with better care and services.\n\nMany health conditions related to these hazards are temporary and should disappear after the exposure ends. Other longer-term health issues may be caused by a combination of hazardous exposures, injuries, or illnesses you may have experienced during your military service including blast or noise injuries.\n\nPresumptive Conditions for Airborne Hazards and Burn Pit Exposures\n\nThe following are presumptive conditions:\n\nBrain cancer\n\nGastrointestinal cancer of any type\n\nGlioblastoma\n\nHead cancer of any type\n\nKidney cancer\n\nLymphatic cancer of any type\n\nLymphoma of any type\n\nMelanoma\n\nNeck cancer\n\nPancreatic cancer\n\nReproductive cancer of any type\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the larynx\n\nSquamous cell carcinoma of the trachea\n\nAdenocarcinoma of the trachea\n\nSalivary gland-type tumors of the trachea\n\nAdenosquamous carcinoma of the lung\n\nLarge cell carcinoma of the lung\n\nSalivary gland-type tumors of the lung\n\nSarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung\n\nTypical and atypical carcinoid of the lung\n\nRespiratory (breathing-related) cancer of any type\n\nAsthma that was diagnosed after service\n\nChronic bronchitis\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\nChronic rhinitis\n\nChronic sinusitis\n\nConstrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis\n\nEmphysema\n\nGranulomatous disease\n\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD)\n\nPleuritis\n\nPulmonary fibrosis\n\nSarcoidosis\n\nRead about burn pit and other toxic exposures that are now presumptions related to the PACT Act.\n\nRead about eligiblity for free VA health care as a post-9/11 combat Veteran.\n\nOpen Burn Pits – What Was Burned\n\nWaste products commonly disposed of in open burn pits include:\n\nChemicals, paint, medical and human waste\n\nMetal and aluminum cans\n\nMunitions and unexploded ordnance\n\nPetroleum and lubricant products\n\nPlastics, rubber, wood, and food waste\n\nExposure to smoke created by burning these materials may cause irritation and burning of eyes or throat, coughing, breathing difficulties, skin itching or rashes. Many of these conditions are temporary and resolve on their own when the exposure ends. However, if you were closer to burn pit smoke or were exposed for longer periods of time, you may be at greater risk for longer-term health conditions.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nPlease refer to the resources below for additional information:\n\nSand, Dust, and Particulate Exposure\n\nWar Related Illness and Injury Study Center (WRIISC) Training for Health Care Providers\n\nMilitary Exposures Newsletter\n\nOil Well Fires during Gulf War\n\nTo learn more about other types of military exposures, visit the military exposures homepage."
