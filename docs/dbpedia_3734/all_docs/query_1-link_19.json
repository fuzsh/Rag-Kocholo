We have gone to great lengths, overcome great obstacles — and, too often, made great sacrifices — to ensure that the news was reported quickly, accurately and factually, in a balanced and unbiased way. We are transparent about our news values and principles, which guide all AP journalists.\n\nSince 1846, we have been breaking news and covering the world’s biggest stories, always committed to the highest standards of accurate, unbiased journalism. We were founded as an independent news cooperative, whose members are U.S. newspapers and broadcasters, steadfast in our mission to inform the world. To this day, AP remains independent, beholden only to the facts. From delivering the news via pony express in 1846 to working with artificial intelligence today, we are always innovating to provide fast and factual news and information.\n\nRead about our achievements over the last year in our 2023 Annual Report. Our chair and CEO provide a look into our business position and breakdown key figures about our reach, output and finances."
