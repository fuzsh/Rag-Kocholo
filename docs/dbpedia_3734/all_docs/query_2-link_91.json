        "text": "Current vacancies - Note\n\nPlease note that INTERPOL is in the process of changing its e-recruitment platform from ‘Talentlink’ to ‘Recruitment Hub’. During this transition period, both platforms will be run concurrently until all the positions published in Talentlink have been fully recruited.\n\nTo search current vacancies, please visit both platforms.\n\nApplications must be made via the platform where the post is published.\n\nRecruitment Hub (new platform)\n\nTalentlink\n\nPlease note that previous applications saved in Talentlink under your candidate account will NOT be transferred to the new platform. Therefore, we encourage you to download them and save them outside of the platform. You will need to fully complete an application in the Recruitment Hub the first time you apply for a post published on this new platform.\n\nApplications\n\nHow do I apply for a post?\n\nAll applications must be made via our online platforms; either TalentLink or Recruitment Hub. Please find the links above.\n\nSpontaneous applications and applications sent by mail or email will not be considered.\n\nHow do interviews work?\n\nMost interviews are conducted with a panel of staff members and a Staff Committee representative via video conference technology. It is not necessary for you to travel for the interview.\n\nHow do I know the status of my application?\n\nIt can take a few months for the shortlisted candidates to be contacted for testing/interviews. If you have not received a response within 6 months of submitting your application then unfortunately you have not been successful.\n\nCan I apply for more than one vacancy?\n\nYes, carefully check the vacancy notice to ensure you meet the minimum requirements of the post.\n\nDo I need security clearance to work at INTERPOL?\n\nYes, as part of the recruitment procedure all future staff must provide a Criminal Record Certificate (see below, Documents).\n\nWhat documents do I need to provide?\n\nAll selected candidates will need to provide the following documents:\n\nScanned copies of all diplomas, degrees and certificates listed in the application;\n\nProof of employment for all of the positions previously held and listed in the application (salary slip, contract, recommendation letter);\n\nA Criminal Record Certificate issued in the past three months, that includes spent and unspent sentences (if any) from the countries in which you have resided for more than one year in the past five years and that of your country of origin;\n\nThe name and contact details of two professional references (outside of INTERPOL). These people must have worked with you directly, if possible in a hierarchical position, and cannot be family members.\n\nSome other questions…\n\nDo you only hire police officers?\n\nNo, INTERPOL staff come from a variety of backgrounds and it is not compulsory to have law enforcement experience. The minimum requirements for each post are stated in the vacancy notice.\n\nDo I need to speak French for positions in Lyon?\n\nNo, INTERPOL has four official languages: English, French, Spanish and Arabic. For the majority of positions good working knowledge of English is required and it will be stated in the vacancy notice if other languages are required.\n\nI was informed that I have been rostered for a position, what does this mean?\n\nRosters may be created for certain posts that the Organization fills on a regular basis and are valid for a period of 3 years. Once your name is on a roster, before a post is published, the Hiring Manager may choose to select a candidate from the roster. In this case, there is no need for another written assessment or formal interview."
