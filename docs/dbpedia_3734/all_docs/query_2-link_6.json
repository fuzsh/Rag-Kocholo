        "text": "Saudi Arabia's tightly-controlled media offer unwavering support for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and King Salman, routinely ignoring negative reporting about the kingdom.\n\nKey media owners are said to have handed over significant assets to the state during MBS's so-called anti-corruption initiative in 2017, leaving the ownership status of major outlets unclear.\n\nAlthough outlets are adopting a more \"modern\" approach, and more women are involved in the media on and off screen, media freedom organisations continue to note a decline in freedoms.\n\nMoves are under way to turn the kingdom into a global media hub, with the relocation of key outlets from abroad and a diversification into digital platforms.\n\nThere were 35 million internet users by July 2022, comprising 98% of the population (Worldinternetstats.com). Saudis are huge consumers of social media, and the country is said to be the world's biggest per capita user of YouTube.\n\nReligious figures are among the most followed social media personalities, despite having been sidelined by MBS in his attempt to curb the influence of hardline Salafi clerics and those affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nSocial media manipulation is rife as campaigns to defend the kingdom and rebuff criticism routinely involve influencers, inauthentic behaviour and disinformation."
