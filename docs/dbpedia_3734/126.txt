During the meeting, the officials discussed relations between their countries and regional and international developments.

RIYADH: The Cabinet on Tuesday reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s support for efforts aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.

It stressed the need to move forward to end Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land, achieve peace, and give the Palestinians their legitimate rights, Saudi Press Agency reported.

The Cabinet also praised the efforts and contributions of the Arab Parliament at international forums, and affirmed the Kingdom’s keenness on consolidating cooperation with Arab countries in a way that contributes to consolidating security and stability and provides conditions for development and sustainable growth.

The Cabinet also discussed the meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the Speaker of the Arab Parliament Adel bin Abdulrahman Al-Asoumi in Jeddah last week during which Al-Asoumi presented Prince Mohammed with the Leader’s Medal.

The medal was awarded in appreciation of Prince Mohammed’s “pioneering positions in defending Arab issues and strengthening joint Arab action.”

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia condemned on Tuesday repeated Israeli incursions at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in annexed east Jerusalem, the foreign ministry said.

The condemnation came after Israeli far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir led hundreds of Israelis into the compound on Tuesday and performed prayers marking a Jewish holiday.

In a statement, the ministry stressed the importance of respecting religious sanctities, and renewed the Kingdom’s warning against the continuation of these violations of international law and the historical status of Jerusalem.

It also warned against provoking millions of Muslims around the world, and renewed its call for the international community to assume its responsibility toward stopping ongoing Israeli violations of international law and relevant international legitimacy resolutions in Gaza.

Ben Gvir has often defied the Israeli government’s longstanding ban on Jewish prayer at the mosque compound.

The compound is Islam’s third holiest site and a symbol of Palestinian national identity but it is also Judaism’s holiest place, revered as the site of the ancient temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.

While Jews and other non-Muslims are allowed to visit the mosque compound in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem during specified hours, they are not permitted to pray or display religious symbols.

The award helps to promote the King Salman Urban Charter Initiative.

Projects that adopted the charter’s methodology and embodied its values were selected, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Tuesday.

Al-Solaiman announced that the event would be held biennially going forward.

Dr. Adrian Lahoud, the dean of the school of architecture at the Royal College of Art in London, also spoke at the event.

An accompanying exhibition was inaugurated that showcased the crucial role played by King Salman during his tenure as governor of the Riyadh region.

The exhibition highlighted the King’s vision, which is deeply rooted in historical understanding and pride in the Kingdom’s identity and its geographical and social qualities. This has led to diverse solutions and architectural creativity inspired by Saudi culture, SPA’s report noted.

It also explained the six values of the charter, along with displays of shortlisted and winning projects. It concluded with an interactive virtual experience of the charter’s book.

The award’s final shortlist included diverse projects from various regions of the Kingdom.
