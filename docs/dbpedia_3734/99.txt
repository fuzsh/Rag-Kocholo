This repo contains a set of 31,030 Arabic newspaper articles alongwith metadata, extracted from various online Saudi newspapers.

The folder dataset contains a set of ZIP files, where each file has the format YYYY-MM-DD.zip and contains one JSON file with a corresponding name YYYY-MM-DD.json. The JSON files are stored in UTF-8 encoding.

Each JSON file contains an array of articles (the format of each article is explained in the next section), and its file name reflects the date on which the contained articles were extracted.

The JSON object for each article contains the following fields (some fileds can have empty values in case the crawler failed to extract them):

source: A string identifief of the newspaper from which the article was extracted. It can have one of the following values:

String Identifier Newspaper aawsat Al-Sharq Al-Awsat aleqtisadiya Al-Eqtisadiya aljazirah Al-Jazirah almadina Al-Madina alriyadh Al-Riyadh alwatan Al-Watan alweeam Al-Weeam alyaum Al-Yaum arreyadi Arreyadi arreyadiyah Arreyadi okaz Okaz sabq Sabq was Saudi Press Agency 3alyoum Ain Alyoum

url: The full URL from which the article was extracted.

date_extracted: The timestamp of the date on which the article was extracted. It has the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss. Notice that this field does not necessarily represent the date on which the article was authored (or made available online), however for articles stamped with a date of extraction after August 1, 2015, this field most probably represents the date of authoring.

title: The title of the article. Can be empty.

author: The author of the article. Can be empty.
