Ebenezer United Free Church

Ebenezer Church is a member of the United Free Church of Scotland. The congregation is over 100 years old, but our present building was opened in 1984. According to a former minister, we have the most comfortable seats of any church in the country!

Our minister from 2010 to June 2015 was Rev. Andrew MacMillan. He and his wife May are now enjoying retirement.

Sunday services: 11.00am and 6.30pm. Children welcome.

Alongside other Leith churches and Christian traditions, the ministry of Ebenezer is aimed at helping local people find renewed faith in Christ and enabling them to express it in worship, prayer and daily life. Our Sunday morning service lasts about an hour and we also run a Sunday school, with an excellent creche for children aged up to 3. The service itself is fairly traditional, but, we hope, very welcoming and thought-provoking. All Age Worship services are held monthly. There is an Sunday evening service which is more informal and gives people the chance to meet in a smaller, but equally welcoming group. The building is fully wheelchair-accessible.
