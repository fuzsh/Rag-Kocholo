        "text": "Readers may remember that human remains were recovered last year during excavation of South Leith Parish Church.\n\nToday, Trams to Newhaven have released facial reconstructions of how one of those excavatees might have looked in life during the late Middle Ages (below), and how she might look now if she were alive today (foot of page).\n\nThe same underlying skull appears throughout.\n\nIn Issue 312 we reproduced an article from 25 November 1896 which looked forward to the imminent opening of Broughton Primary School.\n\nTwo days later, additional journalism in the Edinburgh Evening News looked back at the inaugural event, and in so doing revealed some familiar fractures over how limited public resources are allocated across the capital.\n\n*****\n\nAn eye-catching, thought-provoking, and well-executed piece of street-art has appeared at the Tesco end of the Rodney Street tunnel. For the full effect, see the foot of this page.\n\nThe work, by Mark Tremaine Agbi ‘Okata’, was commissioned by Sustrans UK to mark Black History Month. It is one of eight pieces across the country’s National Cycle Network, created to highlight Scotland’s role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. It’s an admirable initiative, which we applaud.\n\nHave you ever wondered about these paviours?\n\nThey skirt the northern and western sides of the inner footway outside Drummond Place Garden, and many examples have a peculiar blue-ish hue. The words read:\n\nTEES SCORIA BRICK CO.\n\nPATENT\n\nOne Joseph Wharton of Darlington patented a machine for making bricks, tiles, &c. from molten blast furnace slag (scoria) in 1877. They had the advantage of being tough, waterproof, and resistant to chemicals.\n\nThe pulley wheel shown in the photo here has emerged from recent tramwork excavations on Leith Walk.\n\nArchaeologists will determine its significance, but to Spurtle observers it looks like evidence of the former cable-drawn Edinburgh tram system.\n\nFrom 1899, it ran as far north as Pilrig Street, whereupon passengers would transfer to the more efficient electrically powered trams operated by Leith Town Council.\n\nThe following correspondence appeared in the pages of the Edinburgh Evening Courant in 1852 and 1856.\n\nSome details may have changed in the years since, but the general problem and particular tone are unmistakably familiar to students of New Town waste disposal.\n\nRELIGIOUS WORK IN EDINBURGH.\n\nThe number of social agencies in connection with the Church is increasing so rapidly in our midst that many good men are beginning to wonder when time will be found for carrying on the more serious business of the Chruch, viz., the evangelisation of the masses. Time and again we have directed attention to the formation of men’s clubs in different parts of the City."
