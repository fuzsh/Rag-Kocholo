        "text": "Named for the late Elizabeth Wardlaw, this award recognises those who have gone above and beyond in service to the community independently, or with Leith Festival.\n\nElizabeth Wardlaw was an active member of the Leith community, serving as minister of Hermitage United Free Church in addition to becoming a Leith Councillor. She served in that capacity for over 20 years. Reverend Wardlaw was dedicated to the Leith community and her constituents, instigating many initiatives and helping countless people and families over the years.\n\nThe Crocus Award was proposed in 2007 following the death of Mrs Wardlaw in recognition of her service, and to celebrate others who contribute to our community. The name and design of the award recognises a project instigated by Elizabeth who initially organised children from Leith and St Mary’s (Leith) Primary Schools to plant crocuses to brighten up the links in Spring way back in the 1980’s. The Crocuses spread, and the beauty of them in spring brings much pleasure to many. They are a fitting memorial to Reverend Wardlaw.\n\nThe creation of the award was a joint effort with input from the then minister of South Leith Parish Church, Rev Ian Gilmour, Leith Rotary (who donated the trophy) and Leith Festival. The award is presented each year during Leith Festival.\n\nIn recognition of her dedication to Leith. Rita worked as a teacher at Leith Primary for many years, before joining the supply list instead of retiring! Finally giving up teaching at age 70. Rita also served on the board of Leith Festival for over 20 years, as well as contributing to many other causes and organisations over the years.\n\nAs she chose to step down from the board in 2023, we felt it would be an appropriate time to recognise the contribution she has made both to the Festival and the wider community."
