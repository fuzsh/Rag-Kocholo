        "text": "Our Church Halls provide a venue for our church family and the community of Leith for those activities which benefit from a different kind of space.\n\nThe Halls are located a short distance away from our church building at 6 Henderson Street. Our buildings are on one level, we have disabled access facilities and baby changing facilities. Parking is available but is restricted to 1½ hours due to the demands of local retail outlets.\n\nThe Halls are where many of our groups meet such as the BB’s, Guides, and the Women’s Group (for more information on ‘our groups’ click on the menu at the top of this page).\n\nTo help finance our wider work, and in order to make our excellent facilities available to the community of Leith, we rent out space to outside bookings.\n\nContact e-mail: slpcbookings@gmail.com"
