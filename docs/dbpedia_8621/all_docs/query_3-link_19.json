        "meta_description": "By eminent architect Thomas Hamilton, 1848, incorporating some late 15th century remains. Rectangular-plan aisled decorated Gothic church with square-plan 4-stage NW tower. Cream sandstone, stugged ashlar with polished dressings. \n\t\n\tInterior: 5-bay nave with substantial octagonal stone piers to arcade; panelled aisle roofs with pierced braces springing from carved mask corbels; notable carved hammerbeam roof springing from carved mask corbels stops (modelled on St Isaac’s, Leningrad); raked E and W galleries with blind tracery balustrades, 1887 Brindley and Foster organ in W gallery. Vaulted E vestibule with foliate capitals to columns. Furnishings: elaborate marble and sandstone pulpit with prophet figures in columned niches by Sydney Mitchell & Wilson, 1893-4; galleries and W screen dated 1909, framework of cusped tracery to organ pipes; extensive stained glass scheme (Ballantine studio 1889-93), Christ preaching to W window, Last Supper to E window.\n\t\n\tSouth Leith Parish Church was originally a chapel, dedicated to St Mary built c. 1438, attached to the Collegiate Church of Restalrig. Originally of cruciform plan, it had been reduced to its nave by 1559. It was made into a parish church in 1609. Between 1650 and 1657, it was used as a magazine by Cromwellian troops.  The church was apparently used to lodge Scots prisoners during Hertford's campaign of 1547-8 and the choir appears to have been destroyed during the siege of 1559-60.  Despite the damage sustained, St Mary's continued as a place of worship for South Leith residents. In 1572 the General Assembly met within its walls.  The fabric was entirely renewed in 1848, but the west piers of the original crossing are still to be seen in the vestibules at the east end of the building.",
