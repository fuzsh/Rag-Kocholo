        "text": "Mention the name The Boys' Brigade (or simply the BB) to Boys, men and families in Leith and immediately many great memories and tales will come flooding back. Especially when you mention the football team, summer camp, Lethem Park, Bible class, and drill. They will recall their captain and officers' names and the names of their group of fellow members. Many groups of men today aged into their 50s, 60s and older recall their days together as teenagers at camp and also taking part in all sorts of sport competitions as well as drill, swimming, PT, first aid, cross country and many more.\n\nThe BB was formed in 1883 in Glasgow with The BB starting in Leith in 1892 with a company of Boys being formed in North Leith Parish Church in Madeira Street and it grew from there so that by the 1950s and 60s there were more than 20 separate companies in Leith. Younger aged sections had also started so that the Junior Section (previously called the Life Boys) and Anchor Boys catered for primary aged Boys. It was common for Boys to be a BB member from age 6 to 18 hence the very strong bonds formed with their leaders and their cohort of Boys having grown up together taking part in team competitions and activities and had so many camp holidays together.\n\nBoys and men will well remember the discipline and the Christian faith elements as the 2 main principles. Indeed the simple discipline of ensuring attendance at Sunday morning bible class meaning you were able to be considered for the following week's football team at Lethem Park will still be burned into some ex members' memories.\n\nAs will cleaning their uniform especially in the 'old days' when there were many more parts of the uniform needing cleaned compared to today's straightforward sweat tops and polo shirts. How many mothers helped clean their son's uniform back in time to ensure they received good marks with their weekly inspection on parade night.\n\nAs the more modern times came around from the mid 1970s with the growing number of activities and agencies all dedicated to serving young people the attractions of The BB gradually began to decrease. The Leith BB joined with the Edinburgh BB and the East Lothian BB in 1998 to form the one larger group of BB across the city and East Lothian.\n\nToday in Leith there are 4 units of BB operating in Boswall Parkway (19th Leith), Newhaven (20th Leith), Duke Street (14th Leith) and Henderson Street (10th Leith). Our values are faith, caring, inspiring and trust. We believe BB members will receive a quality experience from trained and trusted volunteer leaders.\n\nClick below for further information and enquiries about spaces for Boys."
