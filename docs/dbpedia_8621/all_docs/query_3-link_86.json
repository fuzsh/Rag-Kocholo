        "text": "From the Lord goodness,\n\nfrom myself nothing. Till death\n\nI will chart his praise.\n\nAll creation dwells\n\nin a leaf, bird, bloom or word\n\nin my Maker's book.\n\nGerda Stevenson\n\nEsther Inglis arrived in Leith aged three in 1574. Leith was also where she died on 30 August 1624. Her parents were French protestant refugees, who in November 1574 opened a French school, supported by Edinburgh town council. Born in Dieppe, Esther was a creator of beautiful, often miniature manuscripts. She was also a painter, a writer, a skilled embroiderer and the mother of at least seven children. Devoutly religious, she lived most of her life in Edinburgh and Leith. This unique concert in the splendid setting of South Leith Parish Church celebrates Esther and her astonishing handiwork in music and images.\n\nThe centrepiece will be the world-première of Sheena Phillips’ brand-new Nine Haiku for Esther Inglis, which sets poems by acclaimed Scottish poet Gerda Stevenson, first published in her collection Quines: Poems in tribute to women of Scotland.\n\nAs part of the concert, stunning images of Esther’s manuscripts will be screened. In addition to the Nine Haiku, vocal music of Esther’s time will be sung, including magnificent choral laments by Robert Ramsey for the death in 1612 of one of Esther’s patrons, Prince Henry Frederick Stuart, the eighteen-year old ‘Prince of Great Britain’.\n\nThere will also be metrical psalms in Scots and French (these are for audience participation: tunes and texts will be provided!), and polyphonic settings of French poetic texts of which Esther Inglis repeatedly made exquisite manuscript copies: Claude Le Jeune’s settings of Antoine de Chandieu’s Octonaires sur la vanité et inconstance du monde, and Paschal de L’Estocart’s of the Quatrains du sieur de Pybrac.\n\nThe eight voices of the Sacred Arts Festival Chorus will be directed by Calum Robertson. Nine Haiku for Esther Inglis will be performed by Sally Carr (soprano), Juliette Philogene (piano) and Calum Robertson (clarinet and bass clarinet).\n\nEntry is free, but donations to help cover costs are welcome.\n\nSouth Leith Parish Church is in the Kirkgate, Leith, Edinburgh, EH6 6AZ.\n\nLink to map: https://nslpc.co.uk/about/\n\nOn 20 June 1620, Esther Inglis sat down to write a letter to King James. This is the only known letter from her that survives, and it gives a distinct sense of her straight-talking that we find in some of her manuscripts to the king as well as Princes Henry and Charles. The importance of the letter required her to use a large full sheet of paper – which was expensive – on which she writes her message in careful Roman script. The message barely takes up the top half of the sheet, but she signs it at the bottom right corner.\n\nAddressing the king in large capitals at the top: ‘MOST MIGHTIE MONARCHE’, she gets right down to business. ‘Darre I presume vpon th’honnor and credit that I haue had at diuers tymes to speake your Royal Majesté and hath euer found your Highnes fauour’, indicating an extraordinary familiarity with the king, which indeed goes back to early days in Edinburgh. She is writing on behalf of her ‘only sonne who hauing past his course two yeares ago would glaidlie follow Theologie if it shall please God’. Samuel had taken his MA degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1618 but desired more study, so Esther is asking the king to write a letter on his behalf ‘to sum fellowship either in Cambridge or Oxefoord as occasion shall fall out’.\n\nShe has reminded King James that Samuel gave him a little book of his own poems when the king visited Edinburgh in 1617, and now she asks that he write a fellowship recommendation – rather like asking your favourite professor for a letter to go with your applications. Being fully aware of how the court operates, Esther spells out exactly what she wants done. When Samuel notifies one of the noblemen close to the king that he has a possible fellowship pending, let the nobleman tell the king’s secretary right away so that a letter can be expeditiously produced.\n\nShe ends, ‘For the which I may haue my tossed mynd releeued of the great cair I haue perpetuallie for this said youth. And wee all of vs will neuer cease to beseech God to preserue and prolong your Majesties lyfe with many happie & prosperous yeeres to Reigne ouer vs’. Esther reveals herself here as the caring mother, worried about the future for this her only remaining son who is so talented, and she assures the king that the whole family will be praying for him.\n\nWhat an extraordinary letter from a middle-class woman to her ruler, not grovelling but honest and straightforward, harkening back to the openness of the Stewart court as it was in Scotland before 1603. Both she and Bartilmo had worked for the king in the 1590s, Samuel had met him twice in 1617, and Esther is here relying on this familiarity. In the end, after seven months, the king appointed Bartilmo to the living at Spexhall in Suffolk, but in fact it’s very unlikely that he ever went there. Samuel took that living within ten months, so his father’s appointment may have been a placeholder until Samuel finished his studies. He was to remain there for the rest of his life with his own family, dying at the ripe age of 84 in 1681. How proud his mother would have been.\n\nSometime in the spring of 1599, Bartilmo Kello, Esther’s husband, travelled from Edinburgh down to London carrying messages for Queen Elizabeth I from James VI along with several manuscripts made by Esther. One of these was for the queen herself: a lovely book of Psalms in French, written out in a large variety of scripts, and decorated with bands of leafy and figurative designs in black and white, as well as Esther’s self-portrait.\n\nBodleian, Christ Church Coll. Oxford MS 180, p.1\n\nThe binding of this little book displays a crowned Tudor rose embroidered front and back on red velvet, within a floral border picked out with seed pearls. The rose motif is repeated again in ink line on the title page and at the end of the volume, while an elaborately-framed royal coat-of-arms is drawn on the verso of the title page. It is a stunning volume, which, according to a letter from Bartilmo, the Queen really liked.\n\nBodleian, Christ Church Coll. MS 180 front cover\n\nBodleian, Christ Church Coll. MS 180, p.154\n\nEsther dated her dedication as ‘De Lislebourg [Edinburgh] en Escosse, ce XXVII de Mars, 1599’. It’s an odd date, but represents the fact that she had to have this manuscript along with several others ready to go with Bartilmo. She signs the dedication in French as the queen’s ‘very humble, very affectionate, and very obedient servant forever’.\n\nAfter finishing his duties in London, which included bringing manuscripts for Anthony Bacon and the Earl of Essex, for whom he was working, Bartilmo had to sit around and wait to be paid. This delay went on for so long that he wrote a letter to the queen, politely but firmly reminding her that she had approved of the manuscript but that he would like to get home. Finally he made it back to Edinburgh in August, from where he wrote to Anthony Bacon about the terrible nine-hour storm they sailed into while going up the east coast of Scotland.\n\nBartilmo’s letter to Anthony Bacon, BL Add MS 4125, f.357\n\nThe Queen’s little volume now belongs to Christ Church College Oxford and is kept in the Bodleian Library, but it is also fully digitized here. Enjoy!\n\nEsther Inglis and Bartilmo Kello were married in 1596 and had at least eight children, possibly nine. Unlike many women of the period, Esther seems to have timed her pregnancies about every two years, which undoubtedly made it easier for her to work. Some of her whimsical moths, birds, caterpillars, and snails suggest she was aware of how her art could appeal to children as well.\n\nHoughton Library MS Typ 212, 1606.\n\nEsther’s ‘Very Hungry Caterpillar’! Houghton Library MS Tap 212, 1606.\n\nHere is a list of the children of Esther and Bartilmo, with their baptismal dates.*\n\n13 March 1597, Edinburgh: twins Samuel and Agnes; Agnes evidently died soon after as she disappears from the records; Samuel lived until 1680 as minister at Spexhall in Suffolk.\n\n13 May 1599, Edinburgh: Jeane – she may have died young also as we don’t hear about her in the records.\n\n1 March 1601, Edinburgh: Josephe – died at age thirteen, 30 September 1614, Willingale Spain.\n\n[no record ca. 1602], Edinburgh: Hester – marries James Crighton of Lochbank in 1618; they have six children.\n\n8 March 1605, London: Isaake – died at age nine, 13 July 1614, Willingale Spain.\n\n6 November 1608, Willingale-Spain: Elizabeth – appears in Edinburgh Registers of Sasines from 1620.\n\n[7 April 1610, Willingale Spain: Margaret – father recorded as John Kello, but no other Kellos are found in that parish, so this may be a mistake by the registrar]\n\n12 May 1612, Willingale Spain: Marie – marries Patrick Ainslie, merchant burgess of Edinburgh, December 1632 – he mistreats her.\n\n*I am immensely grateful to Jamie Reid Baxter for trolling through many records to find these children.\n\nIt was a brilliant match – seventeen-year-old Susan de Vere married Philip Herbert, soon to be Earl of Montgomery, on 27 December 1604. The young couple had contracted to each other in secret, but King James himself took up their cause and gave away the bride during the lavish court festivities that included a masque (now lost) Juno and Hymenaeus. Lady Susan was one of the daughters of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, but she had been raised in the household of William Cecil, Lord Burghley, with all the advantages and wealth. She had recently joined the court of Queen Anna, and maintained a close relationship with both princes Henry and Charles.\n\nEsther must have heard of this marriage, perhaps through her friend David Murray in Prince Henry’s household, and she presented a manuscript to Lady Susan on 20 February 1605. Alas, if only she had been better prepared. The gift was not one of the glorious coloured manuscripts full of flowers and insects, or even one of the amazingly decorated black-and-white manuscripts, but her plain calligraphic copy book, probably dating from 1586.\n\nHarvard, Houghton Library, MS Top 428.1 Seq 5\n\nWriting about this now, makes me feel a little embarrassed for Esther. Having moved to London in mid-1604, then copied out David Hume’s treatise on British union, she apparently had not had time to create something special. And that was a shame, since Susan Herbert loved the arts, danced in many of the Queen’s masques, and became a noted patron to a number of writers. What she thought of Esther’s little book, we’ll never know.\n\nHarvard, Houghton Library, MS Top 428.1 Seq 3 – Dedication\n\nPerhaps at least she appreciated the dedication in which Esther writes: ‘. . . albeit I be a stranger and no way knowen to your L[adyship], yitt haue I tane the boldnes to present you with thir few flovris that I have collected of Dame FLORAS blossomes Trusting your L will accept heirof als kindlie as from my heart I haue done it, and in humilitie offers the same to your L. and the rather becaus it is the work of a woman of one, desyrous to serue and honour your L, in any thinge it shall please your L, to command’.\n\nLady Susan had a superior education in the Cecil household, which likely included a writing master. If she looked through Esther’s book with its forty different calligraphic hands, she might have been reminded of her own studies, though she would not have reached Esther’s professional proficiency.\n\nHarvard, Houghton Library, MS Top 428.1 Seq 49\n\nHarvard, Houghton Library, MS Top 428.1 Seq 71\n\nAt the end of the dedication, Esther hopes her little work will be agreeable to Lady Susan, and shows her knowledge of the recent wedding when she says, ‘I pray God blis and preserue your L, and your noble husband in long life, good health and prosperitie. At London this xx of Februar 1605’.\n\nLater in 1605, Esther began producing a string of beautiful, coloured manuscripts, for Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester; Lucy, Countess of Bedford; and Elizabeth, Lady Erskine, among many others. If she had had such a one available, who knows whether she would have gained a genuine patroness in Susan de Vere Herbert, soon to be Countess of Montgomery.\n\nOn 26 January 1607, Esther Inglis presented a copy of Gwalther’s Latin verse summary of the Gospel of Matthew “To the Right Honorable and Most Noble Lord, William Earle of Morton, Lord of Dalkeyth, &C.” At the age of twenty-four, William Douglas had succeeded to his grandfather’s title and become 7th Earl of Morton in November 1606. Two years earlier he had married Lady Anne Keith, daughter of George Keith, fourth earl Marischal (ODNB).\n\nWilliam Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, from a painting at Dalmahoy\n\nDavid Murray, Esther’s “ear” at court, must have told her that Morton was arriving in London where she was residing in 1606. Esther writes, “sen I hard of yr cumming to this cantrie, I haue bene exercised in perfyting this litle book dedicated to yr Lo:” She had never met him, but he was obviously an up-and-coming young man from a very distinguished family (Mary Queen of Scots had been kept at his grandfather’s castle Lochleven). Esther writes: “My Lord, that one vnknown to your Lo: hes emboldned hir selfe to present you with a few grapes of hir collection, I hope your Lo: shal not altogether mislyk therof.”\n\nEsther also hopes that she won’t “be estemed impudent in transending the limites of scham fastnes (wherwith our sexe is commonlie adorned) in offring this small work of my pen and pensill . . . Beseeching you accept of it and the rather becaus it is a womans work.” This bowing and scraping of course is merely an expected stance, used by both sexes at the time; Esther knows full well the beauty and value of her work.\n\nEsther Inglis, Argumenta singulorum capitum Evangelii Matthaei Apostoli, 26 January 1607. NLS MS Acc. 11821. Image from Perdita\n\nThe 7th Earl went on to become a member of the Scottish Privy Council, and in 1630, Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. We don’t know what he thought of the manuscript; perhaps he passed it on to his wife, Anne. It is certainly beautiful, decorated with Esther’s signature style of a flower-strewn, gold title-page frame, and fine drawings of flowers on each page of text. In the early eighteenth century, the manuscript passed into the hands of a young woman, Grizel Nimmo (1688-1730). She noted her ownership several times on the verso of folio 30: “This Book at present doth belong unto me Grisall Nimmo” and “I Grizell Nimmo aught ys Book 1712/ Grishilda Nimmo.” Much information on Grizzell’s family and subsequent owners is filed with the manuscript in the National Library of Scotland.\n\nEsther Inglis, Argumenta singulorum capitum Evangelii Matthaei Apostoli, 26 January 1607. NLS MS Acc. 11821, fol. 30v. Image from Perdita\n\nLes Quatrains Du S. De Pybrac Dediez A Tresnoble et Treshonorable Seigneur, Monseigneur de Hayes . . . 1607. Newberry Library Wing MS miniature ZW645.K292 (Photo by G Ziegler)\n\nEsther Inglis gave this beautiful manuscript as a New Year’s gift in 1607 to someone she addressed as M. de Hayes. With no first name to go on, the bibliographers A.H. Scott-Elliot and Elspeth Yeo suggested years ago that he might be Sir Thomas Hayes, who had received a knighthood from King James in 1603 and was to be Lord Mayor of London from 1614-15 (SE/Y no. 31). Somehow, this didn’t exactly make sense in various ways. First of all, Esther and her family were not living in London when Thomas Hayes was Lord Mayor; they had long before moved on to Willingale Spain in Essex. Secondly, the other manuscripts she gifted at this time were for prominent members of the court: Ludowic Stewart, Duke of Lennox; Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury; Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury.\n\nLooking through the other courtiers, however, I found James Hay (or Hayes) c.1580-1636, a Scot from Fife, who in 1603 became a member of Queen Anna’s bedchamber and was made Lord Hay in 1604. King James liked the man and continued to shower land and honors on him, finally making him a baron in 1606. Part of this beneficence was in the interest of promoting a marriage between Lord Hay and Honora Denny, also a member of the queen’s court, whose father had severe objections to the union.\n\nIn the end, Sir Edward Denny came round, and the couple were married at a festive occasion on 3 January 1607. Their wedding was celebrated with a masque specially written by Thomas Campion, known familiarly as “Hayes Masque” and printed soon after it was performed.\n\nThis delightful detail of gilded snail and flower is found on fol. 32.\n\nNewberry Library Wing MS miniature ZW645.K292 (Photo by G Ziegler)\n\nA New Years Guift for the Right Honorable And Virtuous . . . The Lady Erskine of Dirltoun. Newberry Library, Wing MS. miniature ZW 645.K29\n\nEsther and her family had arrived in London in mid-1604, following the Stewart court. While there, she began experimenting with new materials, working for the first time in full colour and even trying what it was like to paint on vellum. During 1605, in preparation for the following New Year, she made three manuscripts in this medium, which had been widely used in the medieval period, but was now mostly found in special legal and royal documents. The recipients were all connected to the court of James VI/I: Robert Sidney, Earl of Leicester (and younger brother of the lamented Sir Philip Sidney); Lucy Harington Russell, Countess of Bedford (and noted patron of the arts), and Elizabeth Norris, wife of Thomas Erskine, Lord Dirletoun. Elizabeth, whose manuscript is seen above, was one of the wealthy English widows who married a Scottish courtier, matches that were promoted by King James.\n\nA New Yeers Guift For The Right Honorable And Virtuous . . .

All three use texts from the Book of Proverbs. If you compare the title pages, you’ll see that she copies the same patterns of flowers, fruits and moths, and she repeats designs on interior pages as well. All three manuscripts also contain the crossed calligrapher’s pens with the motto Nil Penna Sed Usus (“not the pen itself, but the skill in using it”) which she adapted from a handwriting manual by Jacobus Hondius.\n\nNewberry Library Wing MS ZW 645.K29 (Photo, GZ)"
