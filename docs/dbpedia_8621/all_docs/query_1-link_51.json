        "text": "Rosslyn Chapel was founded in 1446 by Sir William St Clair. The beauty of its setting, in rural Midlothian, the mysterious symbolism of its ornate stonework and its role in the Da Vinci Code have inspired, attracted and intrigued writers, artists and visitors ever since.\n\nJust seven miles from Edinburgh city centre and open daily. Each day is split into 90-minute timeslots, allowing us to manage the capacity on site.\n\nTo guarantee your visit, please book in advance through this website.\n\nAn absolute must see when visiting Edinburgh\n\nTripAdvisor review\n\nSituated just 7 miles south of Edinburgh city centre and close to the Scottish Borders, Rosslyn Chapel is open throughout the year. There are lots of things to see and do - whatever the weather this summer. Remember that admission is free for children in a family group. We look forward to welcoming you soon!"
