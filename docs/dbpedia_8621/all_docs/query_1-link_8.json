(Leith is the historic port for Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland). You can see the location on this map.\n\nIn this beautiful building we worship and praise God. We pray for ourselves, the community, and the world. We sing psalms, old and new hymns, and contemporary songs. We regularly sharing in the sacraments of Communion and Baptism. We celebrate our festivals of Harvest, Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. We remember the past, we enjoy the present and we look to the future with hope."
