        "text": "Minutes of the Community Councils Together on Trams/Trams Team meeting on Thursday 8 September 2022 at 5:15pm, at Trams project compound (165 Leith Walk)\n\nActions and decisions are red italic. ‘TT’ means ‘Trams Team’. Names are mostly abbreviated to initials. Continue reading →\n\nadapted from an email from Trams to Newhaven. For more information, please see their latest Project Newsletter.\n\nPlease note that construction work on the Trams to Newhaven project will pause for Christmas and New Year from 5.00pm on 20 December 2019 until 7.00am on Monday 6 January 2020.\n\nAll open excavations on Constitution Street have been backfilled with sand to protect the ground conditions. Footways have been reinstated where possible and the majority of traffic management on Leith Walk will be removed, with barriers remaining around street lighting columns and build-outs.\n\nDuring the festive period, we will secure all construction site entry and exit gates using a coded padlock. All emergency services have been given the code should they need to gain access and the site will be inspected twice a day.\n\nThe scaffolding at the South Leith Parish Church wall will remain in place over the festive period and will be inspected regularly.\n\nOur contact centre opening hours over the period are:\n\nSaturday 21st December 2019 – Monday 23rd December 2019 8:00am to 8:00pm\n\nTuesday 24th December 2019 & Tuesday 31st December 2019 8:00am to 6:00pm\n\nFriday 27th December 2019 – Monday 30th December 2019 8:00am to 8:00pm\n\nFriday 3rd January 2020 – Sunday 5th January 2020 8:00am to 8:00pm\n\nHow to contact the project\n\nTelephone: 0131 322 1122\n\nEmail: Newhaven.tram@edinburgh.gov.uk\n\nLive chat: www.tramstonewhaven.co.uk\n\nThe contact centre will be closed on the following days although calls will be auto-forwarded to the on-call team:\n\nWednesday 25th December 2019\n\nThursday 26th December 2019\n\nWednesday 1st January 2020\n\nThursday 2nd January 2020\n\nThe operating times for the Mitchell St logistics hub over the period are:\n\n21st, 22nd, 23rd = 8.00am – 6.00pm\n\n24th December = 8.00am – 3.00pm\n\n25th and 26th December = CLOSED\n\n27th, 28th = 8.00am – 6.00pm\n\n29th = Sunday closure\n\n30th December = 8.00am – 6.00pm\n\n31st December = 8.00am – 3.00pm\n\n1st, 2nd January = CLOSED\n\n3rd January = 8.00am – 6.00pm\n\n4th January = 8.00am – 3.00pm\n\n5th January – Sunday closure\n\nTraffic management maintenance crews will be operational 24/7 over the Christmas period.\n\nIf you have any further questions please do not hesitate to get in contact.\n\n(adapted form an email from ‘Trams to Newhaven’)\n\nLeith Walk Planters\n\nIn order to facilitate construction of Trams to Newhaven project, the 14 planters that are currently situated on Leith Walk will be moved to the Leith Links / Duke Street / Lochend Road / Easter Road junction. This will be a permanent move in order to accommodate dedicated cycling lanes post construction. The planters will be moved as part of the enabling works commencing on Monday 18 November 2019.\n\nWe are aware that some businesses / residents have been looking after the planters and where this is known we have made contact to explain. An example of this is the Kadampa Meditation Centre who we visited to explain what is happening and to thank them for the work they have done. We will be attaching posters to the planters this week to highlight the planters being moved.\n\nTrimming of trees at South Leith Parish Church Wall\n\nIn order to begin works on the South Leith Parish Church wall later in December 2019, TD Tree and Land Services Limited, a specialist in tree maintenance, will trim back overhanging branches in order to gain access to the wall. The works will take place over two days (Monday 18 and Tuesday 19 November) and will not damage the trees in any way.\n\nWherever possible all work will be carried out from the ground. If required, trees will be climbed by trained personnel and will only take place once an assessment has been made that is safe to do so.\n\nAn eco-check for bats and nesting birds was undertaken recently which identified the trees had not been used by either species.\n\nWe will be highlighting both of above on the project website and in the electronic newsletter this week."
