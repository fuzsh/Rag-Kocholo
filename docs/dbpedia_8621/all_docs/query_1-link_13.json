        "text": "It was founded in 1483. and was formerly known as St Mary's.\n\nOS maps from 1876 & 1893 show \"seats for 1200\".\n\nIn 1973, the congregation was merged with Leith Kirkgate.\n\nDunlop, in \"The Kirks of Edinburgh\" (Edinburgh, 1988, Scottish Record Society) provides an extensive history of the church and parish. The church website also summarises the history.\n\nOPRs (Old Parish Registers) exist from the last few years of the 16th Century, although it is from around 100 years later (1692), that regular records are available.\n\nDetails of the registers, gaps, etc, can be found on the NRS website.."
