About South Leith Parish Church

Church of Scotland Parish Church

In this beautiful building we worship and praise God. We pray for ourselves, the community, and the world. We sing psalms, old and new hymns, and contemporary songs. We regularly sharing in the sacraments of Communion and Baptism. We celebrate our festivals of Harvest, Christmas, Easter and Pentecost. We remember the past, we enjoy the present and we look to the future with hope.

Any home reflects the lives of its inhabitants, past and present and that is very true of our historic building where war memorials, coats of arms and magnificent stained glass windows are found next to a library, a refurbished gathering space and a prayer area. We like to have our special building open and used as much as possible and it is possible to arrange tours, weddings and concerts. We have disabled access facilities and parking available.
