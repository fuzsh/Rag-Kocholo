Every family needs a home, somewhere to get together, to share meals, to rest and find the resources we all need to have a full and active life. For the family of South Leith Parish Church home is our church building and our halls.

Our Church building is in the Kirkgate, in the heart of Leith, just through the Kirkgate shopping centre at the foot of Leith Walk.

At South Leith Parish Church we are a diverse group of people - young and old, creative and caring, practical and purposeful, employed and unemployed, traditional and contemporary, single, divorced, with partners, married, Scottish, Polish, English, African, Irish.

Together we live out our faith, making space for variety in what we do, how we worship and in the ways we serve and care for the community.

At South Leith we hold that love is the heart of the Christian belief. Love for others, for God and for the creation. We usually say the Apostles Creed at our services which is an ancient, traditional statement of faith.

Transport to our buildings

Buses from the city centre to Leith include 7, 10, 12, 14, 16, 22, 25 and 49. The church is then a short walk from the bottom of Leith Walk through the Newkirkgate Shopping Centre.
