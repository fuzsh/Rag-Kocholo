        "text": "Different\n\nThe different is that which is being deferred with another kind of temporality. If performatives are actions that make a difference in the world, it is the different that is being differed as something. The difference is not based on resemblances with the past. Interval\n\nThere is an immediate interval in all gestures of thought. There is an interval between gestures and response, but the interval in the gesture of thought need not refer ‘in the wake of’ something. The interval of thought has some similarity to a syncopation, where it signifies both-and, instead of the either-or of rational thought. The gesture of thought is not an indexing gesture for something, or for intentional manifestation. Labour & Action\n\nThat which each person, both experts and manual labourers, sell. The whole package is her labour force. Her capacities are her property, which she dominates and sells, but the work result, such as the event of performance, is not her property. Artistic research is founded upon these epistemic instances of progress, positionality, point of view, reflection and withdrawal. The conditions of unity, compatibility and composition are to be fulfilled in the event of research and action, which requires some extent of organization. Product\n\nWhen practice, production, reception and reproduction are blurred into an event, then the amount of extortion, force and violence that is being necessarily used in the production is blurred as well. A mode of organization is necessary for any production. All production needs to be iterative and reproducible, and must also meet the standards for value and exchange. Performance thinking\n\nThere are no standard conceptions of what this properly is. Performance thinking is the force-(of)-thought a priori for theoretical, practical or aesthetical determination. Decision\n\nLaruelle claims that decision is the invariant structure of philosophy. A decision performs its own transcendental reality. It is what links performance with artistic practice as a potential, philosophical decision Reflection\n\nThe decisional nature of thinking changes when we move from the reflection of thought to the diffraction of thought. If we regard reflection of mirroring and resemblance, then diffraction is not the same as refraction or displacement. It maps where difference appears. Accident\n\nThe decisional apparatuses of dramaturgy, composition, editing and improvisation are axioms that administer the accident. All modes of practice need settings in advent for controlling the accidents. Primitive accumulation\n\nThe long history of capitalism, since the early city-states of Venice and Firenze, consists not so much of innovations but variations on the territorial and financial modes of organisation utilised in each hegemonic struggle for primitive accumulation. The economy and violence are the ways for capitalism to use expropriation and primitive accumulation to produce both subjectivities as free moving labour. It is renewed in every present moment. The logic of the capital is to stay on the move and remain in a state of continuous becoming. For both the immaterial labour and the physical exploitation of the worker, the axiom is defined by Silvia Federici (2014, 141): “[t]he body had to die so that labour-power could live.” Primitive accumulation is always connected with production-reproduction, and this connection continues in the contemporary context of immaterial labour.\n\nAudience\n\nWhen Erika Fischer-Lichte argues that there no longer exists a separation between the work of art, the creator and the recipient, but only an event, then it concatenates with the dissolution between immateriality and physical labour. The political effects of such conflations are immense, and fit well with the new labour formations.\n\nImage of thought\n\nPerformance-as-philosophy has a set of functions that define the connections with corresponding thoughts, extensions, concepts and objects. The essence of performance-as-thinking is based on the universal principle that we know what it is to think. The world is appropriately human and sufficient, and philosophizable. Thus, performance thinking is not actualized in sufficiently reasonable terms. Performance thinking is a posture of performance and not an image of thought. Particle and wave\n\nThe double-slit experiment was performed initially by Thomas Young in 1801 in the context of Newtonian mechanics, but it has become one of the critical experiments illustrating the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, which do not follow Newtonian physics. Light can display characteristics of both waves and particles at the same time, where photons seem to have appeared at two separate positions simultaneously. In 1924 L.V.P.R. de Broglie proposed that matter has characteristics of both a particle and a wave. In his research he determined that a ray of light was not only a wave but that the diffraction effects of the light were the result of the more conspicuous forms of matter. Still, there cannot be one experiment to test both the particle and the wave at once. This duality introduces the quantum particle, which does not fit the classical system of physics. This also signifies that the same double-slit experiment done with electrons and separately with macroscopic elements will give totally different results."
