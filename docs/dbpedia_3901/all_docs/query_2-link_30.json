        "text": "There has been much recent discussion concerning the so-called problem of “correlationism.” According to the correlationist, thought and being are necessarily co-related. On this view being cannot be thought of without positing it in relation to some form of subjective apprehension. This presupposition on the part of various contemporary philosophies has come under a considerable amount of criticism. Two of the most prominent critics of correlationism include Quentin Meillassoux and Ray Brassier. For both, the problem of correlationism stands in the way of a proper realism which is motivated in part by the epistemic priority of the empirical sciences. Meillassoux’s critique of correlationism is a critique of the kind of transcendental philosophies represented by Kant and Husserl. This construal of correlationism leads him to reject transcendental philosophy through his notion of ancestrality. Brassier, concerned with pushing the project of the Enlightenment to its nihilistic conclusion, also seeks to circumvent correlationism. However, unlike Meillassoux he resituates the role of the transcendental through a non-correlational account of extinction rather than dispense with transcendental philosophy en masse. For Brassier, the reality of extinction necessitates the move from a transcendental idealism to a transcendental realism, a move which is reinforced through his encounter with the work of Francois Laruelle.\n\nContinental philosophy has recently been shaken by the so called “speculative realism” movement. What is actually at stake in this philosophical tendency is a “speculative turn”, trying to access the real as the condition of both our conditioned knowledge and the existence of subject-independent objects. Accordingly, speculative realism tries to provide a non-idealist solution to the typically post-Kantian problem of the genesis of the transcendental. In the first part of this paper I will show how Quentin Meillassoux, Ray Brassier, Iain Hamilton Grant – three of the participants of the workshop that gave “Speculative Realism” its name on April 2007 at Goldsmith University of London – propose to overcome the circle of correlation, specifically in the form created by Fichte, so as to access the in-itself as a reality which is completely independent of thought, while being able to ground the possibility of its existence. In the second part I will compare their different strategies and consider some issues that, in my opinion, are problematical as non-correlationist solutions. Finally, in the last part, I will propose a rough account of the direction that I mean to take towards solving the problem of the genesis of the transcendental.\n\nIn this paper, we will be concerned with Sellars’ and Meillassoux’s views on the Kantian notion of the ‘transcendental’. Both Sellars and Meillassoux attempt, in their own distinctive ways, to disentangle the sound insights of Kantian transcendentalism from what they both take to be its fundamental error, namely the thesis of the in principle inaccessibility of the ‘in-itself’. However, they disagree over the substantive issue of what precisely must be preserved or discarded from Kantian transcendentalism. It will be suggested that, from a Sellarsian point of view, both Meillassoux and his adversaries, strong correlationists, conceive of the transcendental as a sui generis mode of existence which cannot be reduced to merely ‘ontic’ empirical existence. And this is the reason why Meillassoux himself does not succeed in fully overcoming all forms of correlationism. Moreover, it will be argued that Sellars’ take on Kantian transcendentalism fares better than Meillassoux’s in that 1) Sellars is in a position to hold that the transcendental is conceptually irreducible to the empirical while at the same time insisting that his theory can (in principle) account for the empirical conditions of the emergence of the ‘transcendental correlation’ itself. Ιt will be also suggested that the Sellarsian candidate for the ‘in-itself’, namely the world of ‘absolute processes’, can be understood as the outcome of a transcendental investigation of the conditions under which alone our thought can have empirical content or objective purport. Finally, I will attempt to show that while Sellars’ view of the ‘non-correlational’ ‘in-itself’ is strikingly similar to Meillassoux’s own view in that they both reject the ontological/explanatory import of the principle of sufficient reason and take it that worldly processes are ultimately contingent and not characterized by any causal necessity (causal laws), from a more penetrating point of view, their views on these issues are in fact radically different: Meillassoux accepts the legitimacy of the question which lies at the heart of the formulation of the principle of sufficient reason (‘why are things as they are and not otherwise?’) and argues that this principle can be refuted by reason alone. By contrast, Sellars would not accept that the above question has any ontological import, and hence he would, in effect, reject both the principle of sufficient reason (understood in the above ontological/explanatory terms) and the Meillassouxian ‘principle of unreason’. Yet, I take it that Sellars would simultaneously argue that the principle of sufficient reason, this time understood as having normative, epistemological import, is not only legitimate, but actually indispensable for the self-correcting function of empirical inquiry in general."
