He writes on Marxism, philosophy, and psychoanalysis and has taught philosophy at George Washington University, the Washington, DC jail and Marymount University. Tutt is a podcaster with Repeater and Zer0 Books. His first book, Psychoanalysis and the Politics of the Family (2022) is published with the Palgrave Lacan Series and has been hailed by philosopher Isabel Millar as “essential reading.”\n\nPraise for How to Read Like a Parasite: Why the Left Got High on Nietzsche\n\n“A compelling picture of the ways that Nietzscheanism hijacks the left.”\n\n— Jan Rehmann, author of Deconstructing Postmodernist Nietzscheanism: Deleuze and Foucault\n\n\"Beautifully written and bursting with spirit, How to Read Like a Parasite is destined to be vital reading.\"\n\n— Matthew McManus, author of Nietzsche and the Politics of Reaction\n\n\"Written with clarity and force, sensitive to historical context and covering an extensive array of the Nietzsche literature, this book animates a new standard in reading Nietzsche.”\n\n— Don Dombowsky, author of Nietzsche and Napoleon: The Dionysian Conspiracy\n\n\"Exemplary... Tutt’s evaluation of the consequences of Nietzschean politics is more lucid than Left Nietzscheans might wish.\"\n\n— Ray Brassier, author of Nihil Unbound: Enlightenment and Extinction \"Today, in our age of quick new Right or new Left dismissals, such a stance is needed more than ever.\"\n\n— Slavoj Žižek\n\n\"The conclusion of How to Read Like a Parasite is that a ruthless, even “parasitical” critique of Nietzsche, who cannot be ignored but must be constantly confronted head on, is the key to overcoming the destruction of reason in our time.\"\n\n— John Bellamy Foster, author of The Dialectics of Ecology\n\n\"Tutt’s book sets a new standard for understanding how to read Nietzsche from the political left.\"\n\n— Carl Sachs, author of Nietzsche Between Scientism and Irrationalism"
