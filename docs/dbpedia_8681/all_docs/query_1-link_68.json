        "text": "A symbolic dish of Italian cuisine, with the typical ingredients of the Bel Paese: spaghetti, tomato and basil. Spaghetti with tomato sauce is an institution, a simple but far from trivial recipe. It is subject to infinite variations to find the perfect balance of flavors, the right creaminess and sweetness, starting from the choice of the type of tomato. This classic first course is a real test for those who love to prepare it at home, but also for star chefs who jealously guard the secrets of their perfect versions! Here we are at the stove with you to suggest our recipe of this timeless classic: peeled tomatoes cooking slowly over low heat and the scent of fresh basil leaves are the key ingredients to successful results! You may remember the famous scene from the movie \"Miseria e Nobilt√†\", when Felice Sciosciammocca and the other members of the family swoop down on the serving plate and start grabbing spaghetti with tomato sauce with their hands... well, we are sure that with our version you will be tempted to do the same! Enjoy your meal!\n\nYou might also like:\n\nPasta alla sorrentina\n\nPasta alla pizzaiola\n\nPasta del maresciallo\n\nTo make spaghetti with tomato sauce, start by preparing the sauce. Pour the extra virgin olive oil in a pan with the peeled and halved garlic clove 1, so you can remove the core and make the scent more delicate. Cook for 2 minutes over high heat, add the peeled tomatoes 2 and salt 3.\n\nCover with a lid and cook for at least 1 hour over very low heat: the sauce should simmer gently 4. Mix it from time to time. After this time, remove the garlic 5 and pass the tomatoes through a sieve 6 to obtain a smooth and homogeneous puree.\n\nPour the sauce 7 back into the pan, turn the heat to very low and add the basil leaves 8. After a few minutes, turn off the sauce and keep it warm. All you have to do now is cook the pasta in plenty of boiling salted water 9.\n\nDrain the spaghetti al dente directly into the sauce 10 and stir for a few moments over high heat to mix everything together 11. Your spaghetti with tomato sauce is ready, all you have to do is serve it, garnished with fresh basil to taste 12!"
