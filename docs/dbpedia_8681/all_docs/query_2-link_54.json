        "text": "THROWBACK THIRTY\n\nOriginal Review by Jonathan Broxton\n\nThe iconic canine film star Lassie, a heroic and intelligent collie dog, was created by British author Eric Knight in a short story published in The Saturday Evening Post in 1938, which was later expanded into a novel entitled Lassie Come Home in 1940, followed then by a film adaptation of the same name in 1943. The stories were all pretty much the same – Lassie’s teenage owner Joe gets into some kind of trouble, Lassie helps him overcome the difficult situation, while showcasing his loyalty, courage, and the bond between humans and animals – but the formula was immensely popular, and resulted in several sequels, and a long-running television series which aired from 1954 to 1973.

We need more oomph.” If you think I’m joking, recall that Bernard Herrmann once said of Hitchcock that the great auteur would happily have had all his movies underscored with Ketèlbey’s In a Monastery Garden if he could.\n\nWhen confronted with a blank sheet of paper instead of a screen or a screenplay, our affable film composer might understandably feel a little bereft, like a director without a camera or an actor without a script. But there’s an even bigger problem. Any resulting concert-hall work risks falling between two off-puttingly large stools: first, the expectations of film music fans who have gotten used to bite-sized soundtrack cues and are generally not interested in longer-form works lacking any visual associations; and second, the sniffy attitude of the classical music community towards such journeymen (and women) getting ideas above their station – recall the notorious New York Times review of Korngold’s Violin Concerto in 1947: “more Korn than Gold”. Attitudes have changed since then, but not entirely.

Sidney Franklin was assigned production with a budget of $2.5 million, John Collier and George Froeschel were hired to write the three screenplays, and two directors were hired; Vincente Minnelli for “Mademoiselle” and Gottfried Reinhardt for “The Jealous Lover” and “Equilibrium”. The cast of “The Jealous Lover” included James Mason as Charles Coudray, Moira Shearer as Paula Woodward, and Agnes Moorehead as Lydia. The cast of “Mademoiselle” featured; Leslie Caron as Mademoiselle, Ricky Nelson as Thomas Clayton Campbell Jr., Ethel Barrymore as Mrs. Hazel Pennicott, and Farley Granger as Thomas the young man. The cast of “Equilibrium” included; Kirk Douglas as Pierre Narval, Pier Angeli as Nina Burkhardt.

Clear and Present Danger is the second film to feature Harrison Ford in the lead role as Ryan; in this film, Ryan is appointed Acting Deputy Director of Intelligence for the CIA, and is asked by the President of the United States to help secure funds from congress in order to legally fight drug cartels, after one of the Presidents’ best friends is apparently murdered on the orders of drug lord Ernesto Escobedo. However, it soon becomes apparent the funds are actually being used to conduct an illegal covert war in Colombia, which leads to the deaths of several American soldiers, and that Ryan is being set up to be the ‘fall guy’ should the truth ever be revealed. With the help of a fellow CIA Operative Ryan travels to Colombia with the aim of ending the illegal war, exposing the perpetrators, and bringing home the soldiers left behind.

Smith and Joseph Kosinski, we now have one to enjoy. Twisters, as it is somewhat unimaginatively named, is technically a sequel, but is actually more of a remake or reimagining of the same basic story. It stars Daisy Edgar-Jones as storm chaser and budding meteorologist Kate Carter who, along with her friends, is using an updated variation of the tech used by Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt in the original film to try to understand and reduce the intensity of tornadoes in Oklahoma. However, after an experiment turns deadly, Kate gives up storm chasing, and five years later she is working at a weather forecasting office in New York. Things change for Kate when she is coaxed back to the tornado front lines by her old friend Javi (Anthony Ramos), who is now working for a large well-funded company and is using military-grade technology to study tornadoes; even more interestingly, while out on the road with Javi, she encounters the self-proclaimed ‘tornado wrangler’ Tyler Owens (Glen Powell) and his ragtag crew. Tyler is brash and arrogant and is apparently only interested in increasing his number of YouTube followers, but there is more to him and his team than meets the eye… Read more…\n\nGREATEST SCORES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nOriginal Review by Craig Lysy\n\nAuthor Daphne du Maurier’s efforts to sell film rights for her 1951 novel My Cousin Rachel for $100,000 and 5% of the international box office was rejected by all of the major Hollywood studios except 20th Century Fox, whose counter offer of $80,000 was accepted. Nunnally Johnson was assigned production with a budget of $1.2 million, wrote the screenplay, and George Cukor was tasked with directing. Controversy arose when both Cukor and du Maurier both objected to the script, with bot departing the project when their revisions were rejected. Casting was also problematic with Cukor’s choice of either Greta Garbo or Vivien Leigh playing Rachel Sangalletti Ashley, fell through with his departure. Olivia de Havilland was instead brought in and joined by Richard Burton in his Hollywood debut as Philip Ashley, along with Audrey Dalton as Louise Kendall.

He had intended to produce the film with his son playing the titular role. However, he needed to secure financial backing and so pitched his vision to Samuel Goldwyn, who decided to move the film into production. Goldwyn envisioned Gary Cooper to star in the production, the project was derailed when Paramount Pictures initiated a $5 million lawsuit against Goldwyn for allegedly trying to lure its star away. This effectively killed the project; never the less, Goldwyn was undaunted and in 1937 purchased an original story on Marco Polo from N.A. Pogson. Goldwyn and George Haight would manage production with a massive $2 million budget, with Archie Mayo tasked with directing. Goldwyn was insistent on Gary Cooper playing the titular role, which in hindsight was an error as Cooper felt he was miscast, and critics greed saying Cooper’s persona was a poor fit for the swashbuckling adventure. Joining Cooper would be Sigrid Gurie as Princess Kukachin, Basil Rathbone as Ahmed, and George Barbier as Kublai Khan.

Written by Anna Sewell and published in 1877, it tells the life story of the eponymous horse, beginning with his early days in the loving home of Farmer Grey, and then on through a series of subsequent owners, including the kind and gentle Squire Gordon of Birtwick Hall, and the cruel and neglectful Mr. York of Earlshall Park. After suffering a severe injury while working as a cab horse in London, he is rescued by Joe Green, a former employee of Squire Gordon, who eventually provides him with a peaceful and comfortable retirement. The novel is narrated in the first person by Black Beauty himself, providing a unique perspective on the life and experiences of a horse in Victorian England, and who juxtaposes his own life with those of others around him, some of whom suffer much worse fates. Most importantly Sewell addresses the then-unfashionable topic of animal welfare, and its success and popularity played a crucial role in shaping public attitudes towards animals and contributed to the development of modern animal rights movements.

The story follows a young boy named Michael; after his father loses his job, Michael’s parents decide to sell up and sail around the world on their yacht, the Peggy Sue, bringing Michael and his dog Stella Artois along on the adventure. However, during a storm, Michael and Stella Artois are washed overboard and end up on a small, seemingly deserted island. Michael soon discovers the island is inhabited by Kensuke, an elderly Japanese man who has been living there since World War II. Initially, Kensuke is hostile and forbids Michael from signaling for help. Over time, however, they form a close bond, and Kensuke teaches Michael survival skills and shares his story of being separated from his family during the war, while they await a rescue. Aaron MacGregor, Sally Hawkins, Cillian Murphy, Ken Watanabe, and Raffey Cassidy lead the voice cast, and the film is directed by Neil Boyle and Kirk Hendry from a screenplay by Frank Cottrell-Boyce. Read more…\n\nGREATEST SCORES OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\n\nOriginal Review by Craig Lysy\n\nScreenwriter Hideo Oguni was approached by director Akira Kurosawa for his next project, which was to be inspired by Leo Tolstoy’s acclaimed novella “The Death of Ivan Ilyich,” about a man diagnosed with terminal disease who seeks solace for the short time he has left to live. This resulting film, Ikiru, inaugurated a renowned collaboration between screenwriter Oguni and Kurosawa, which would go on to encompass many of the finest films in Japanese cinema, including Seven Samurai (1954), Throne of Blood (1957), The Hidden Fortress (1958), Sanjuro (1962), High and Low (1963), Dodes’ka-den (1970), and Ran (1985). Toho Company agreed to finance the project and assigned production to Sōjirō Motoki. Kurosawa would direct, and the final screenplay was credited to Oguni, Kurosawa, and Shinobu Hashimoto. A fine cast was assembled, which included Takashi Shimura as Kanji Watanabe, Shinichi Himori as Kimura, and Haruo Tanaka as Sakai.

Following hot on the heels of The Firm and The Pelican Brief, both of which were released in 1994, comes The Client, directed by Joel Schumacher. The story follows an eleven-year-old boy named Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) who, along with his younger brother Ricky, witnesses the suicide of a lawyer named Jerome Clifford. Before dying, Clifford reveals to Mark that he knows the whereabouts of the body of a recently murdered U.S. Senator, which could implicate a powerful mob figure, Barry “The Blade” Muldano (Anthony LaPaglia). As Mark becomes the target of both the mafia, who want to silence him, and the authorities, who want his testimony, he seeks the help of a feisty lawyer named Reggie Love (Susan Sarandon). Despite being initially reluctant to get involved, Reggie decides to take Mark’s case and protect him from all threats – one of whom is the ruthless U.S. Attorney Roy “Reverend Roy” Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones), who wants to exploit the case to further his own political ambitions. Read more…\n\nOriginal Review by Jonathan Broxton\n\nSeize Them! is a British comedy directed by Curtis Vowell, written by Andy Riley, starring Bridgerton’s Nicola Coughlan and Sex Education’s Aimee Lou Wood, with a supporting cast of popular British TV comedy actors including Jessica Hynes and Nick Frost from Spaced, Lolly Adefope from Ghosts, and standup star James Acaster. The film is set in the Middle Ages and sees Wood playing the spoiled and entitled Queen Dagan, whose rule is overthrown in a popular revolution led by Humble Joan (Coughlan). Suddenly finding herself a fugitive in the land she once ruled, Dagan joins forces with her newly-unemployed but still loyal lady-in-waiting Shulmay (Adefope), and a peasant named Bobik (Frost) whose personal hygiene standards are somewhat lacking, and together the unlikely trio embarks on a voyage to win back her throne. The humor is silly and goofy and sometimes quite bawdy, and comes across as a sort of cross between Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Horrible Histories, but some of the reviews I have read have praised it for having its heart in the right place, and for being a rare female-centric take on the ‘medieval comedy’ trope. Read more…\n\nTHROWBACK THIRTY\n\nOriginal Review by Jonathan Broxton\n\nOne of the best and most enjoyable action-comedies of the 1990s was True Lies. A remake of the 1991 French film ‘La Totale’ by Claude Zidi, it was written and directed by James Cameron in what was his first theatrical movie since Terminator 2: Judgment Day in 1991. The movie stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Harry Tasker, a seemingly ordinary computer salesman who is actually a secret agent working for a covert U.S. government organization called Omega Sector. His wife Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis) is unaware of his true occupation, but feels bored and unfulfilled in their marriage, longing for some excitement in her life. Harry’s double life starts to unravel when he begins to suspect that Helen might be having an affair with a used car salesman named Simon (Bill Paxton), who pretends to be a secret agent to seduce women. Harry’s jealousy leads him to use Omega Sector resources to investigate Helen, eventually pulling her into his world of espionage and action. The situation becomes even more complicated when a group of terrorists called the Crimson Jihad, led by the ruthless Salim Abu Aziz (Art Malik), threatens national security with a stolen nuclear warhead.

Since then Costner has been involved with numerous western or western-adjacent movies, either starring in them, directing them, or both, ranging from his Oscar-winning masterpiece Dances With Wolves in 1990 to more recent efforts like Wyatt Earp, The Postman, Open Range, the TV mini-series Hatfields & McCoys, and the now long-running contemporary western TV drama Yellowstone. His latest effort, Horizon: An American Saga, may be his most ambitious effort yet. It’s a sprawling tale that follows the stories of multiple fictional characters in pre- and post-Civil War America, detailing multiple aspects of the exploration of the American West. Costner began writing Horizon as early as 1988 – before he even started on Dances With Wolves – and it is planned to be a four-film 12-hour epic that covers almost the entire history of the United States in that period.
