Usually the \"main story\" is quite unnecessary and just a gimmick to tell a few camp fire stories. This film is no different but at least Dead of‚Ä¶\n\nRECOMMENDED BY Jacob\n\nAnthology movies have been a thing for a while now. A series of often intricated stories that form one narrative, sometimes loose, sometimes tight, where either one director and writer or a series of them gets to showcase their skills in a short amount of time.\n\nOne of the (if not the) early example of this comes all the way from Ealing Studios where we follow an architect by the name of Walter Craig, who makes his way up to a country home in Kent where he's come to talk with its owner in regards to some renovations. Everything seems normal but things will turn weirder and weirder as he encounters a series of guests at the‚Ä¶\n\n\"Trying to remember a dream is like.. being out at night during a thunderstorm. There‚Äôs a flash of lightening and for one brief moment, everything stands out vivid and starkly.\"\n\nThe point at which our memories intersect with our dreams is a fascinating one that garners reflection, yet can also induce fear ‚Äî as illustrated in Dead of Night. Dreams are essentially constructed from our memories ‚Äî not in terms of the events we dream up, but in terms of the faces and locations which paint our dreams. Likewise, yet perhaps more abstractly, after we awake, our dreams become memories themselves, of our other, nighttime reality. The basic question that is often expressed in this type of discussion is something‚Ä¶\n\nüéÉ Hooptober ‚ùå: Ten Times the Terror (6/31)\n\nCriteria: Decade 2/8 (1940‚Äôs)\n\nAn interesting film that attempts the ask the questions: ‚Äúwhen do you know you‚Äôre in a nightmare?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhat can dreams tell us about the strange borders between death and life?‚Äù An early example of existential nightmarish horror, Dead of Night boasts a screenplay that is clearly ahead of it‚Äôs time in this regard, written by Angus MacPhail, known for his collaborations with Hitchcock. But the script might be a bit too ambitious for it‚Äôs own good and an execution on film that is not without it‚Äôs problems‚Ä¶\n\nSome parts of the movie I found to be a bit dull unfortunately. There are interesting ideas here but I think‚Ä¶"
