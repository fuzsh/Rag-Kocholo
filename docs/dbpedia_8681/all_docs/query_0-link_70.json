        "text": "Biography\n\nFranco-Swiss director, born in Geneva in 1990. He grew up in a family of actors and discovered cinema at a very young age, for which he was curious, open to all genres: from independent cinema to big American Blockbusters. He was destined for a long time as an actor and undertook acting training, in parallel with his piano studies at the Geneva Conservatory. He has acted in different plays and films since his childhood. At 18, he went behind the camera and made a 26-minute short film. This experience was a revelation, he interrupted his studies at the Theater Conservatory to go and study directing and acting direction in Belgium, at the Institut des arts de diffusion (IAD), from which he graduated with a Master in Cinema Fiction in 2015. His graduation short film, “Du bout des fingers”, has traveled to more than twenty countries and won numerous international awards, including the Prix de la Bobine at the 2016 Chalon tout Court Festival."
