        "text": "Whenever I’m looking for a chicken dinner that will make jaws drop, I always turn to this go-to recipe: That's right, Delish developed the ORIGINAL \"Marry Me\" chicken that's gone viral on . The recipe has become such an Internet staple that covered the phenomenon (and their version became their most popular recipe of 2023, seven years after I created the OG). Chicken breasts are seared until golden brown before being baked in a simple (but extremely satisfying) cream sauce that results in a chicken that's packed with flavor in every bite. Whether I’m making this for a special someone on Valentine's Day or simply as an extra-special weeknight dinner, be prepared—this chicken just might inspire a confession of love at first bite.\n\nWhat People Are Saying:\n\n\"Delish! Made this for my man ... Followed easy instructions and turned out great!.. Unfortunately, the end result of marrying me didn't happen ... but at least the meal was good. 😳😁\" - PurpleFish\n\n\"I will be cooking this for the second time tonight! One of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten! The sauce is awesome!\" - Gatorman\n\nHow \"Marry Me\" Chicken Got Its Name\n\nMany of you have probably heard of Ina Garten's \"Engagement Roast Chicken\" before, but this, if I may say, is so much tastier. When I created this dish in 2016, I was trying to develop recipes that would fire people up to get in the kitchen. I had produced one of Delish's first truly viral recipes, Tuscan Chicken Pasta (my baby, if we’re being honest), and was hungry for a skillet version that had similar ingredients but was even saucier. With that in mind, I developed a \"Sicilian Chicken Skillet\", but wasn't sold on the name...until a stroke of genius hit on video shoot day. After we spooned the sauce over the chicken for the last shot, our videographer Chelsea grabbed a fork to try the final result. Once she took a bite, she blurted out, \"I'd marry you for that chicken!\" and the now-famous name was born. This is a chicken dinner so good, you just might get a proposal by the last bite.\n\nHow To Make Marry Me Chicken\n\nIngredients\n\n• Chicken: This is one my favorite ways to use up boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which can be notoriously bland and boring, yet are ideal to cook up on a busy weeknight. Still, this sauce is so good, you can pair it with pretty much any protein. Serve with chicken thighs, pork, even pasta.\n\n• Garlic: I always lean toward the camp of the more garlic, the better, but in my opinion, two large-ish cloves finely chopped or grated provided a great base but didn’t overpower the sauce. Feel free to add more to taste depending on the size of your cloves.\n\n• Thyme: The peppery, woodsy bite of fresh thyme is why I went with this particular herb, but you can sub in more basil if you don’t have any on hand.\n\n• Crushed red pepper flakes: Any dish with cream should have a little bit of heat, but if you’re extremely spice-averse (or serving this to anyone who is), you don’t have to include it (but I highly suggest even a pinch if possible).\n\n• Chicken broth: If you’re making a vegetarian dish—like serving the sauce over pasta—any vegan or vegetable store-bought or homemade stock won’t take anything away from the final result. Just make sure it’s low-sodium, as I always want to be able to control the seasonings as much as I can.\n\n• Sun-dried tomatoes: This is the secret weapon to this recipe, as it gives such a complex, sweet and tangy addition to the sauce without having to use speciality ingredients you have to hunt down at the store. Plus, you can make it all year-round with sun-dried tomatoes, as using fresh tomatoes, depending on the season, will affect the quality of the dish.\n\n• Heavy cream: Yes, including cream was inevitable to get the desired consistency for the sauce. I found in testing that only 1/2 cup is all you need, so you won't feel overstuffed at the end of the meal.\n\n• Parmesan: This also helps bring out depth to the sauce and melts right into it. I go for the block or wedge and grate myself, which I’d always encourage a home cook to do if they have the time. It truly makes such a difference in the end.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n\nThere’s a reason I call for searing the chicken before letting it finish in the oven. You get a beautiful golden brown crust, and it helps keep the chicken super-moist and flavorful. Plus, the base of the sauce is any chicken fat that has rendered out during this initial sear. It may seem like an unnecessary extra step, but trust me, it makes a huge difference.\n\nOn to the sauce: Using whatever schmaltz is left in the pan, a combination of garlic, fresh thyme, and a touch of red pepper flakes for just a hint of heat get a quick toast; this brings out the aromatics’ fragrance and color. Stir in the heavy cream, broth, sun-dried tomatoes, and Parmesan, then let the sauce reduce a bit to meld and thicken. It's as easy as that!\n\nFinally, return the seared chicken to the skillet and let it roast in the oven until the chicken cooks totally through.\n\nThis sounds—and tastes—fancy, but is a totally doable cooking trick for chicken breasts that anyone can master.\n\nNote: The full list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe above.\n\nWhat To Serve With Marry Me Chicken\n\n• Melting Potatoes: Another way to soak up all that sauce in carb-form.\n\n• Parmesan Roasted Green Beans: A perfect solution to use up any extra Parmesan, plus a bright green side will complete the meal.\n\n• Cacio E Pepe Brussels Sprouts: This also includes a mix of pecorino and Parmesan, and who can say no to more cheese?\n\n• Garlic & Feta Mashed Potatoes: For an extra-indulgent dish, spoon the chicken and sauce on top of the potatoes.\n\n• Garlic Bread: Keep the sides simple by toasting some garlic bread and serving alongside.\n\nStorage"
