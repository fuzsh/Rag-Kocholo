        "text": "Director: Raúl Ruiz\n\nThis film might have one of the most ironic titles on the 1001 Movies list because I will never be able to regain the 163 minutes I spent watching this pretentious twaddle. Director Ruiz might have an eye for inventive visuals, but they are completely laid to waste in this boring, confusing epic biopic that does little to shed light on who Proust was as a person, except that he was perhaps just as pretentious.\n\nThe film might have some great actors of the era, including Catherine Deneuve, Emmanuelle Béart and John Malkovich, but they do nothing to save this movie. Ruiz tells the ‘story’ (if there even is one) through flashbacks and dreams in a very random, impossible-to-follow way. And, even worse, I couldn’t even look away from the film to focus on something else, as I tend to do when a film isn’t capturing my interest, as I had to read the English subtitles. It was all I could do not to keep pausing the film to give myself a breather, as I wanted the film over and done with as soon as possible. This is truly one of the worst films on the list.\n\n0/10"
