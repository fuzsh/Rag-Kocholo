        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Lionsgate is further expanding its John Wick universe with John Wick: Under The High Table, an action series executive produced by the billion-dollar film franchise’s star, Keanu Reeves, and director, Chad Stahelski, Deadline has learned. Stahelski is also is set to direct the pilot episode.\n\nWritten by The Old Man co-creator Robert Levine, the story in John Wick: The High Table picks up directly after the end of John Wick: Chapter 4. John Wick has left the world of the High Table in a tenuous position and a collection of new characters will look to make a name for themselves while some of the franchise stalwart characters remain committed to the old-world order.\n\nThe description of John Wick: The High Table, which promises to “combine new and old and thrust the Wick universe into a new age,” indicates a mix of newly created and existing characters, an approach Lionsgate previously used in the John Wick prequel limited series The Continental: From the World of John Wick, one of Peacock’s biggest original launches of 2023.\n\nStahelski, who in January signed a deal with Lionsgate to oversee creative on the John Wick franchise across film and TV and other media, is executive producing John Wick: The High Table through his company 87Eleven Entertainment. Levine, who serves as showrunner, also executive produces alongside Reeves as well as Thunder Road’s Erica Lee and Basil Iwanyk who are producers on the movies.\n\nCurrently, Reeves is attached as an executive producer with no acting component. He is said to be very hands-on with the project, which is being shopped in what is shaping up to become a competitive situation.\n\nIn John Wick 4, John and fellow assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) earn their freedom from the High Table and Winston (Ian McShane) gets reinstatement of Hotel Manager of the rebuilt New York Continental after John (Reeves) kills High Table’s the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård) but is left gravely injured. The ending is left ambiguous, with John presumed — but not confirmed — dead, with a post-credits scene teasing a confrontation between Caine and Akira (Rina Sawayama). She attacks him with a knife after Caine earlier in the movie killed her father, Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada) while sparing her.\n\nThe additional scene could be a teaser for a John Wick spinoff movie about Yen’s Caine assassin character, which is in the works at Lionsgate. The studio also has upcoming spinoff film Ballerina starring Ana de Armas, which takes place between the third and fourth John Wick movie.\n\nThere is a fifth John Wick film in development too, and John Wick: The High Table will not interfere with plans for a potential new feature installment, sources said. Lionsgate declined comment.\n\nLevine is co-creator/executive producer of FX’s The Old Man and also co-created and executive produced Starz’s pirate drama Black Sails. He is repped by WME and TFC Management. Stahelski is represented by WME and attorney Tara Kole."
