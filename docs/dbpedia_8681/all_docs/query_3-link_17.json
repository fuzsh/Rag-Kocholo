        "text": "Block teaching designed around you\n\nYou deserve a positive teaching and learning experience, where you feel part of a supportive and nurturing community. That’s why most students will enjoy an innovative approach to learning using block teaching, where you will study one module at a time. You’ll benefit from regular assessments - rather than lots of exams at the end of the year - and a simple timetable that allows you to engage with your subject and enjoy other aspects of university life such as sports, societies, meeting friends and discovering your new city. By studying with the same peers and tutor for each block, you’ll build friendships and a sense of belonging.\n\nRead more about block teaching\n\nMature students\n\nWe welcome applications from mature students with non-standard qualifications and recognise all other equivalent and international qualifications.\n\nEnglish language\n\nIf English is not your first language an IELTS score of 6.0 overall with 5.5 in each band (or equivalent) when you start the course is essential. English language tuition, delivered by our British Council-accredited Centre for English Language Learning, is available both before and throughout the course if you need it.\n\nUCAS tariff information\n\nStudents applying for courses starting in September will be made offers based on the latest UCAS Tariff.\n\nContextual offer\n\nTo make sure you get fair and equal access to higher education, when looking at your application, we consider more than just your grades. So if you are eligible, you may receive a contextual offer. Find our more about contextual offers.\n\nFacilities and features\n\nTeaching takes place in lecture and seminar rooms equipped with high-definition projection screens. Practical workshops are taught using the latest technology in our media labs equipped with Apple Mac Pro and iMac computers running on the latest operating software and with access to Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\nStudents can also use computer labs equipped with both Macs and PCs, plus there are fully equipped workspaces across the university for group and collaborative work.\n\nStudents on creative media modules have full access to a range of facilities including editing suites, TV studios, digital and analogue radio studios, dark rooms, multi-camera blue and green screen studios, video production labs designed for high-definition video extraction, high-definition editing, CGI, and DVD creation and mastering.\n\nLibrary and learning zones\n\nOn campus, the main Kimberlin Library offers a space where you can work, study and access a vast range of print materials, with computer stations, laptops, plasma screens and assistive technology also available.\n\nAs well as providing a physical space in which to work, we offer online tools to support your studies, and our extensive online collection of resources accessible from our Library website, e-books, specialised databases and electronic journals and films which can be remotely accessed from anywhere you choose.\n\nWe will support you to confidently use a huge range of learning technologies, including the Virtual Learning Environment, Collaborate Ultra, DMU Replay, MS Teams, Turnitin and more. Alongside this, you can access LinkedIn Learning and learn how to use Microsoft 365, and study support software such as mind mapping and note-taking through our new Digital Student Skills Hub.\n\nThe library staff offer additional support to students, including help with academic writing, research strategies, literature searching, reference management and assistive technology. There is also a ‘Just Ask’ service for help and advice, live LibChat, online workshops, tutorials and drop-ins available from our Learning Services, and weekly library live chat sessions that give you the chance to ask the library teams for help.\n\nMore flexible ways to learn\n\nWe offer an equitable and inclusive approach to learning and teaching for all our students. Known as the Universal Design for Learning (UDL), our teaching approach has been recognised as sector leading. UDL means we offer a wide variety of support, facilities and technology to all students, including those with disabilities and specific learning differences.\n\nJust one of the ways we do this is by using ‘DMU Replay’ – a technology providing all students with anytime access to audio and/or visual material of lectures. This means students can revise taught material in a way that suits them best, whether it's replaying a recording of a class or adapting written material shared in class using specialist software.\n\nPlacements\n\nWork placements are offered as part of this course through DMU Careers Team, and can boost your skills and experience while studying, as well as improving your chances of gaining a graduate level job.\n\nWe have links with organisations both in the UK and internationally, and the placements team will help you find a placement to suit your interests and aspirations.\n\nMedia and Communication students at DMU have taken part in work experience placements at a number of local and national companies, including DMU, HBO and Tempur Sealy International.\n\nYou can also gain valuable, industry-relevant experience by taking part in the Demon Media group, featuring The Demon magazine, Demon FM radio station, Demon TV and The Demon website. The Media and Communication Society, Film Society and Media Discourse Group also give the opportunity to add to your knowledge and experience."
