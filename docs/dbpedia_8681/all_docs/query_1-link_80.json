        "text": "Once Upon a Studio is a 2023 live-action/animated short film special produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios. The short features Mickey Mouse assembling a large gallery of legendary Disney characters for a centennial group photo.\n\nCreated to commemorate the 100th anniversary of The Walt Disney Company, Once Upon a Studio combines live-action footage with both traditional and CGI animation. The film has been described as a \"love letter\" to the company's flagship animation studio, as well as \"a thank you to anyone in the audience that's ever connected with a film over the last hundred years\". Several key animators and voice talents returned to the studio to recreate their respective characters accurately.\n\nCharacters appear from all 62 feature films at the time of the film's release, numerous short films, and even some live-action Disney films featuring animation produced by the studio, such as The Reluctant Dragon (1941), Mary Poppins (1964), Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), and Pete's Dragon (1977), with the following exceptions being Song of the South (1946), So Dear to My Heart (1948), Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988), and Enchanted (2007).\n\nThe film was dedicated to Burny Mattinson, WDAS' longest-serving employee, who appeared in the short and passed away eight months prior to its release.\n\nThe film premiered on June 11, 2023 at the Annecy Film Festival and had its TV debut on ABC on October 15, 2023 to critical acclaim.\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nIn Once Upon a Studio, an all-star ensemble of beloved characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios assembles to take a group photo in honor of The Walt Disney Company's 100th anniversary—making for a joyful, entertaining, and emotional reunion. Featuring 543 characters from more than 85 feature-length and short films, Once Upon a Studio welcomes heroes and villains, princes and princesses, sidekicks and sorcerers—in all-new hand-drawn and CG animation—to celebrate 10 decades of storytelling, artistry, and technological achievements.\n\nPlot[]\n\nTaking place in Burbank, California on October 16, 2023, when Walt Disney Animation Studios turned 100 years old, its employees are leaving the Roy E. Disney Animation Building as their usual work day is done and Burny Mattinson imagines about the walls of the studio coming alive after an intern, (Renika Williams), talks with him about the great history it made throughout the century.\n\nInside the studio, after the doors close, all is quiet when suddenly, Mickey Mouse, as seen in a production cel picture for Mickey's Birthday Party, comes to life, and calls Tinker Bell. Mickey questions if all of the employees have left, in which Tink replies yes with a nod. Excited, Mickey, along with his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, jump out of the picture, and Minnie gathers many characters from the studio's filmography with her signature \"Yoo-Hoo!\" signal, whether traditionally or computer animated. Tiana, Pinocchio, Judy Hopps, Nick Wilde, and Louis are the first to respond to the signal. Mickey calls to Bambi, Flower, and Thumper while the latter calls to Orville, Bernard, and Bianca. Minnie, alongside Rhino, Mittens, and Bolt, enlists Peter Pan to gather everyone from upstairs and he complies and flies off with Wendy, John, and Michael Darling.\n\nDuring that, several gags of the characters interacting with one another happen all over the studio;\n\nSisu runs happily down the hall, followed by Jim Hawkins riding on his Alponian Solar Cruiser, Maui changes into his hawk form and flies into the hall while reminding Aladdin and Abu to meet in the lobby, and the former says he'll see them there while sliding down the railing with them ending up with the rock trolls, Vanellope von Schweetz and Dodger ride on the former's candy kart, Elliott takes Cody on a fun ride, Wayne and Lanny slide down on their ropes, and the Ocean drops Moana into the hall along with Flounder, who needed water.\n\nMoana searches for water for Flounder. She approaches Merlin (who was at the Snuggly Duckling coffee area with his sugar bowl, the Mad Hatter, the March Hare, Lucille Krunklehorn, Mrs. Potts, Chip, and Cogsworth, who tells the others that they have no time for tea), and with his help, he casts a spell using the magic words, \"Chapeaulius Bowlius\" to summon water in the Mad Hatter's hat for Flounder to swim in, much to the former's pleasure, who then tells a passing Penguin Waiter with a plate of spaghetti and meatballs that \"There's a carp in [his] cap.\"\n\nAfter seeing an angry Stromboli trying to get a snack from the studio's vending machine, Elsa freezes Hans in his frame after Anna asks her if she thinks that all of the villains will be showing up (most likely because she would be worried about seeing Hans again after he tried to kill them in their film).\n\nDonald Duck steps into an elevator with Carl, Terk, Humphrey the Bear, Ranger J. Audubon Woodlore, and Mother Gothel, when Flash calls from across the hall to hold the elevator as he slowly takes his time walking to them, much to Donald's annoyance.\n\nOlaf draws on an animator's office desk humming \"Friend Like Me\" while using a book copy of Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life to boost his height while the Robin Williams Lost Boy, Timon, and Pumbaa pass by, with the former telling him to shake a leg (in which Olaf replies that the leg won't make a difference because it's all in the wrist) when the Genie bursts out of the drawing, sending Olaf to pieces and he uses his magic to put him back together.\n\nWhile Prince John, Thomas O'Malley, Chicken Little, Milo Thatch, Happy, the Headless Horseman, and Gaston, who sings about himself while doing so, are freshening up in the men's room for the picture, the Cheshire Cat appears in front of his face laughing. Then Minnie opens the door while covering her eyes and tells them to move it.\n\nWhile Christopher Robin, Kanga, and Eeyore try to free Winnie the Pooh from his picture, Antonio Madrigal speaks with Cinderella's bird friends, Meeko, Cri-kee, Pascal, and Pua about meeting in the lobby while stopping Joanna the Goanna from eating Jaq and Gus before getting spooked by an angry barking Pluto.\n\nWhile MacBadger, Ratty, Mole, Ryder, Honeymaren, Sven, and Kristoff walk by, Kristoff warns some Dalmatian puppies, who are watching \"Night on Bald Mountain\" on a TV, that they'll have nightmares when Chernabog pops out of the TV, scaring the puppies and they run away and, in the process, run over Scrooge McDuck, who had just came out from his picture, causing him to drop his money bags, which Robin Hood and Little John grab.\n\nAt this point, Flash finally makes it into the elevator, much to the exasperation of the others, especially Donald who he thanked for holding the elevator. Baymax then squeezes into the elevator after he makes it, resulting in an increase of Donald's frustration enough to be thrown into a quacking fit when the fully-occupied elevator closes its doors.\n\nWhile Ursula is being followed and annoyed by a lovestruck Splat, Cinderella and Prince Charming follow down the stairs, where the prince is the one to drop his shoe, much to their humor. Max picks up the shoe and runs off with it. Charming calls for Eric while Cinderella cheers for Max.\n\nMickey was amused by this when he sees Kaa leading Clarabelle Cow with his hypnosis. He desperately tells him to stop, but Rapunzel says she has it covered, hitting Kaa with her frying pan offscreen to save her.\n\nWhile all of this is happening, Mickey looks up at a portrait of the late company founder, Walt Disney and takes his hat off to pay respects and fondly remember his legacy. Minnie reminds Mickey that everyone is in the lobby as Mickey speaks to the portrait saying that he has to go and thanks him declaring, \"On with the show.\", foreshadowing The Walt Disney Company's bright future ahead.\n\nMickey flies down the lobby stairs amongst some of the other characters to the entrance on Dumbo while Toby Turtle, Bowler Hat Guy, and DOR-15 avoid them. After Raya tells Mickey that the coast is clear, everyone goes outside to take the group photo. During the outside gathering, Wreck-It Ralph bumps in front of the door, but is okay, while Scar comes out feeling annoyed by those he refers to as \"idiots\" around him while Mr. Toad flies around the area on the Magic Carpet. Meanwhile, Ichabod Crane ducks from a ladder being held by Goofy. After Jock and Trusty walk by, Flora turns the building's hat structure pink while Merryweather quickly changes it back to blue. Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, (in black and white), is the last to arrive for the photo as he positions himself next to Pacha and Kuzco, (in llama form), in which Mickey allows Oswald to do so. Oswald tips his ears to say thank you to Mickey, but Kuzco warns him to keep a distance.\n\nEverything is all set as Rafiki hands Goofy an old fashioned camera. However, things backfire as Goofy tries to find the timer button for the camera, he accidentally falls off the ladder, breaking it, shortly after Iago timed it with a three second countdown. Stitch chews on a part of the camera, but Lilo drags him away. Grumpy expresses a sarcastic comment saying \"Well, that was fun.\" and Eeyore states that they might try again next century. Hiro, Go-Go, Honey Lemon, Wasabi, and Fred along with Friar Tuck, the Big Bad Wolf, Professor Ludwig Von Drake, Arthur Pendragon, and King Leonidas, among many of the others, leave in disappointment as the group photo is cancelled and ruined. Mickey tries to assure everyone that everything will be fine, but soon loses hope.\n\nJust then, as everyone begins heading back inside, Alan-a-Dale plays \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" on his lute, joined in by Scat Cat on his trumpet, Mirabel Madrigal on her accordion, and Hathi Jr. using his trunk as a trumpet as everyone, including Taffyta Muttonfudge and Johnny Appleseed, returns to listen. Then the singing starts with Belle and the Beast's duet as Lewis and Wilbur Robinson, the Queen of Hearts, Penny, Pecos Bill, and Widowmaker listen, much to Hades' annoyance. Quasimodo, Pocahontas, Ariel, Scuttle, Baloo, and Mowgli also join in singing along. As the background chorus sings, the other characters help undo Goofy's mistake with the magic brooms sweeping up his camera in a pile, Fix-It Felix Jr. fixing it with his magic hammer, Hercules putting the ladder back in position with his super strength, and the Fairy Godmother using her magic wand to lift Goofy up over the ladder while he places the camera on top of it, and sets the timer. As the trio of Snow White, Mulan, and Asha, Winnie the Pooh, Jiminy Cricket, and the rest of the cast sing the last verse of the song and smile for the photo, Tinker Bell then uses her wand to cut from the scene to where the group photo on the wall is taken (most likely in the studio's lobby), and the film ends with the tagline, \"To all who have imagined with us, laughed with us, and dreamed with us, Thank You.\"\n\nAt the end of the credits, a dedication to Mattinson appears that reads \"For our pal Burny and his 70 years of legendary storytelling at Disney Animation.\"\n\nCast[]\n\nMain article: List of characters in Once Upon a Studio\n\nLive-action[]\n\nBurny Mattinson as himself\n\nRenika Williams as herself playing a Disney intern\n\nAnimated[]\n\nBecause nearly 3-9 decades had passed since the debuts of their original Disney animated franchises, a new cast of voice actors are used for almost all the Disney cartoon characters created from the 1920s-1980s in this short, with none of the returning cast members from Walt Disney's lifetime reprising their roles (excluding archival recordings of their voice work) due to them being retired or deceased at the time this short was made.

Examples:\n\nWhen Mickey speaks to a portrait of Walt Disney, the music playing in the background is Walt Disney's favorite song: \"Feed the Birds\" from Mary Poppins. Richard M. Sherman used to play the song on his piano for Walt when he often visited his old office.\n\nWhen Peter Pan, Wendy, John, and Michael fly upstairs after Minnie tells Peter to gather the entire gang, the music playing in the background is \"You Can Fly!\" from Peter Pan.\n\nWhen Cinderella and Prince Charming show up at the same lobby where the portrait of Walt Disney is, the music playing in the background is \"So This Is Love\" from Cinderella.\n\nWhen the Genie comes to life from Olaf's drawing, the music playing in the background is \"Friend Like Me\" from Aladdin.\n\nThe music playing over the ending credits sequence is \"Steamboat Bill\", the song commonly associated with \"Steamboat Willie\", the cartoon which Mickey made his official debut in 1928.\n\nThe short utilizes entirely new animation for both its hand drawn and CG animated characters, rather than using reused footage, as confirmed by Eric Goldberg.\n\nSimilarly, despite the short utilizing numerous music cues from various Disney animated films, its entire music soundtrack is newly-scored from scratch by Dave Metzger, rather than reusing archival music scores from the animated films they originated from.\n\nAccording to Josh Gad, Genie's dialogue was sourced from previously unused audio recordings by the late Robin Williams.[6]\n\nDirectors Trent Correy and Dan Abraham make cameo appearances among the artists leaving work for the day holding the door open for Burny Mattinson.[7]\n\nThis marks the very first time Chris Diamantopoulos voices Mickey Mouse outside of the Paul Rudish Mickey Mouse shorts and its derivative works.\n\nThis is one of the most prominent short films to feature Chris Diamantopoulos as the voice of Mickey Mouse.\n\nThis is the first Walt Disney Animation Studios production in which Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Mickey Mouse have interacted.\n\nThe two previously crossed paths in ancillary works, namely the Epic Mickey series and the Mickey Mouse short \"Canned\".\n\nSeveral characters are voiced by two actors: these being archival recordings from their respective films, and new dialogue recorded by present day soundalikes. Examples include Donald Duck (Clarence Nash and Tony Anselmo), Winnie the Pooh (Sterling Holloway and Jim Cummings), Peter Pan (Bobby Driscoll and Lee Slobotkin), and Thumper (Peter Behn and Ian R'Mante).\n\nWhile the Cave of Wonders is not among the characters in the short, a maquette of him appears in the office that the Genie first appears in.\n\nWhen Hans is frozen in his frame by Elsa, he takes the same pose as Han Solo after he is trapped in carbonite in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nThis is also a literal direct reference to the term, \"freeze frame\".\n\nThe dalmatians watch the seventh and final segment of Fantasia: Night on Bald Mountain.\n\nPrince Charming loses his shoe, as a reference to Cinderella when the main character loses her glass slipper.\n\nThis short marks the first time Jeremy Irons voiced Scar since the 1994 version of The Lion King, because in every other appearance, that film's version of the character was often voiced by various other voice actors.\n\nBob Joles is the first known voice actor outside of the late David Ogden Stiers to have played Cogsworth from the 1991 version of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nWhen Mr. Toad flies around on the Magic Carpet, he says \"I'll show you the world\" (which is originally archive sound from his debut film The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad) which of course is a reference to the song \"A Whole New World\", from Aladdin, in which the title character sings the first lyric to Jasmine, \"I can show you the world.\"\n\nNathan Lane reprises the role of Timon for the first time since The Lion King 1½ in 2004.\n\nPiotr Michael is the second voice actor to play Iago following the passing of Gilbert Gottfried in 2022. The first performer was Barrett Leddy, who voiced Iago for Disney+'s LEGO Disney Princess: The Castle Quest.\n\nThis was the first time Tom Hulce reprised the role of Quasimodo since The Hunchback of Notre Dame II in 2002.\n\nAlan Tudyk voicing the Mad Hatter is a reference to his role as King Candy in Wreck-It Ralph. The character's voice and physical characteristics were directly modeled after and inspired by the late comedian, Ed Wynn, who originally voiced the Hatter in 1951's Alice in Wonderland.\n\nLilo's older sister, Nani is seen in two different shirts. The first was a white beige short-sleeved belly shirt with red short sleeves when getting ready for the 100 year Disney Group Picture & the other was a pinkish beige short-sleeved belly shirt with a heart. Her pinkish beige short-sleeved belly shirt was seen reddish Pink when Fairy Godmother helped Goofy set up the camera. But at the end in a group photo, her short-sleeved belly shirt with a heart was seen in normal pinkish beige just like in the franchise.\n\nLudwig Von Drake, Lanny, and Wayne are the only characters in the short to have originated from the medium of television, as opposed to a theatrical project, having debuted in The Wonderful World of Disney and Prep & Landing respectively. Although Von Drake did appear in A Symposium on Popular Songs (which was released alongside In Search of the Castaways), while Prep & Landing: Operation: Secret Santa was featured on the \"Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection\" on Blu-ray.\n\nSimilarly, Huey, Dewey, and Louie and Scrooge McDuck are the only characters featured in this short to have first appeared in comics prior to their respective animated debuts.\n\nWhen Scuttle tries to sing along with the others, he ends up being silenced by Baloo by holding his beak shut, which is a reference to a scene in The Little Mermaid when the same thing happens during \"Kiss the Girl\" when he is silenced by the flamingos.\n\nThe scene where Flounder immediately shows up together with Moana after the ocean drops him in her hands is a reference to Flounder's brief cameo in amongst the tapa cloth fishes during Maui's musical number \"You're Welcome\" from Moana.\n\nCo-incidentally, both The Little Mermaid and Moana are directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, and both films' stories revolve around the ocean.\n\nMerida is the only official Disney Princess who doesn't appear in this short, due to the fact that she was produced by Pixar, and not Walt Disney Animation Studios.\n\nHowever, she did appear alongside other Disney princesses with Vanellope von Schweetz in Ralph Breaks the Internet, an animated film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios.\n\nAll of the characters from the Mickey Mouse universe appear in their designs from specific cartoons.\n\nMickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Clarabelle Cow, Horace Horsecollar, and Clara Cluck appear in their designs from Mickey's Birthday Party.\n\nDaisy Duck appears in her design from Mr. Duck Steps Out.\n\nPluto appears in his 1940s design with the red collar.\n\nPete appears in his design from Officer Duck.\n\nScrooge McDuck appears in his design from Mickey's Christmas Carol.\n\nJosé Carioca and Panchito Pistoles appear in their designs from The Three Caballeros.\n\nFigaro appears in his design from his debut film Pinocchio.\n\nChip and Dale, Humphrey the Bear, and J. Audubon Woodlore appear in their designs from the 1950s.\n\nSpike the Bee appears in his design from Inferior Decorator onwards.\n\nHuey, Dewey and Louie appear in their outfits from DuckTales and their physical appearances from the 1950s onwards.\n\nLudwig Von Drake appears as he did in his debut cartoon \"An Adventure in Color\".\n\nThis is the first time Jim Cummings has voiced the Disney version of Baloo, having previously voiced the character in the 1990 Golden Films version of The Jungle Book.\n\nThis is the first time Gopher has appeared in animation since Winnie the Pooh: A Very Merry Pooh Year in 2002.\n\nAsha is the only character from Wish to appear in the short, most likely because it was due to be released in theaters later in 2023.\n\nWhen the Dalmatian Puppies are shown watching Night on Bald Mountain, the following books can be seen on the TV stand's shelves from left to right:\n\nPaper Dreams: The Art and Artists of Disney Storyboards\n\nOswald the Lucky Rabbit: The Search for the Lost Disney Cartoons\n\nEncyclopedia of Walt Disney's Animated Characters: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules (1998 Edition)\n\nA Wish Your Heart Makes: From the Grimm Brothers' Aschenputtel to Disney's Cinderella\n\nWalt Disney Animation The Archive Series: Animation\n\nTinker Bell: An Evolution\n\nWalt Disney Animation The Archive Series: Story\n\nThe Art of The Hunchback of Notre Dame (seen twice on the shelves)\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs: The Art and Creation of Walt Disney's Classic Animated Film\n\nFantasia 2000: Visions Of Hope\n\nThe Art of Hercules: The Chaos of Creation\n\nThe Art of The Lion King\n\nHippo in a Tutu: Dancing in Disney Animation\n\nBrother Bear: A Transformation Tale\n\nA Pig Named Perrier\n\nOnce Upon a Time: Walt Disney: The Sources of Inspiration for the Disney Studios\n\nWalt Disney's The Art of Animation\n\nWalt Disney's The Life of Donald Duck\n\nDisney Lost and Found: Exploring the Hidden Artwork from Never-Produced Animation\n\nAladdin: The Making of An Animated Film\n\nThe Art of Frozen\n\nThe Art of Moana\n\nThe Art of Encanto\n\nThe Art of Wreck-It Ralph\n\nWinnie The Pooh: A Celebration of the Silly Old Bear\n\nThe Art of Zootopia\n\nThe Art of The Princess and the Frog (briefly seen when Cody and Elliott pass by)\n\nThe Alchemy of Animation: Making An Animated Film in the Modern Age\n\nThe Art of Meet The Robinsons (seen twice on its shelf)\n\nThe Nine Old Men: Lessons, Techniques, and Inspiration from Disney's Great Animators\n\nThe Art of the Disney Princess\n\nThe short was originally meant to be theatrically released with Wish, but that plan was ultimately cancelled following its public broadcast on ABC, its worldwide streaming on Disney+, and the fact it was instead theatrically screened with the Disney100 theatrical re-release of Moana, leaving Wish to be theatrically screened by itself. However, the short film was theatrically released alongside with the aforementioned Wish in Japan on December 15 in a special Japanese-dubbed version, due to Japanese dubbing for the short being complete,[8] and was included as a bonus feature on the movie's Blu-ray release.\n\nAccording to Eric Goldberg, this might be the first time we ever see Goofy do his signature holler on screen.\n\nThere were some scenes cut but were storyboarded for the short, including the following: [9][10][11][12][13][14] [15]\n\nTimon and Pumbaa conversing with Snow White about her age, before Snow White pulls a frame out allowing the Lemmings, who are eating pawpsicles, to walk out.\n\nMushu ringing the gong to wake everyone up, only to encounter Scar.\n\nThe Sheriff of Nottingham shaking Huey, Dewey, and Louie out their frame.\n\nCogsworth also waking everyone up, with a Dalmatian puppy jumping out of a frame to lick him, before the other Dalmatian Puppies jump out and pile on top of Cogsworth.\n\nBambi & Thumper waking Anna & Elsa up (who would have been statues, rather than from a framed image). Sleepy (who is sleeping in Kristoff's sled, beside Anna & Elsa) wakes up and asks what's going on, with Jaq and Gus appearing, with the latter saying \"Happy Birthday!\" and the former correcting him.\n\nCaptain Hook being chased downstairs by Tuk Tuk in homage to a classic scene from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThe order in which Genie & Olaf appear would have been switched, with Genie summoning Olaf from a computer screen.\n\nHaving been woken up by Mulan, Pinocchio, Figaro & Cleo try to climb out of their frame, with Rapunzel offering her hair as a line to them.\n\nAladdin taking a bite of an apple from the canteen, tossing it behind him, resulting in it getting caught by the Evil Queen in her witch form. Abu would have taken the other apples, King Louie taking the bananas, while Clawhauser would have taken a cereal dispenser.\n\nFlora, Fauna, and Merryweather enchanting the security guard to sleep through the photo shoot. Stitch would later be seen drawing on the security guard's head.\n\nSnow White & Pocahontas socializing, complimenting one another for how they haven't aged a day.\n\nCinderella, Anna & Elsa would have sung the lyric \"Like a bolt out of the blue\", instead of Snow White, Mulan & Asha.\n\nRutt and Tuke getting lost in the studio, with Luisa Madrigal picking them up to take them where they need to be.\n\nYzma giving a wink to Hercules, which makes him squirm.\n\nThis may be a homage to the Latin American Spanish dub of The Emperor's New Groove, where Yzma says \"I was dreaming about Ricky (Martin)\", who also happens to be the original Latin American Spanish voice of adult Hercules.\n\nGenie was also supposed to take selfies with many of the characters, with one shot showing him getting a pic together with Pinocchio, Cheshire Cat, Tramp, Little John, Gurgi, Tarzan, and Rapunzel. This was cut, as it was felt that characters taking selfies would make the focal photograph of the short feel less special.\n\nBefore Cinderella, and Prince Charming appeared walking down the hallways, Bagheera, Bongo the Bear, Jim Hawkins, Jasmine, Lady, and Tramp were originally going to appear in place of Ursula and Splat.\n\nAfter Goofy's botched attempt, Flynn Rider was supposed to ask whose idea it was to have Goofy take the photo, only for Rapunzel to cut him off by elbowing him. Eeyore would then suggest trying the photo again next year, instead of postponing it for a full century.\n\nA scene which was to take place in the lady's restroom would've had Slue-Foot Sue, Daisy Duck, Madame Medusa, Georgette, and Ariel getting ready for the group photo was to appear after the men's restroom.\n\nA scene which Ariel was originally going to have a non-vocal cameo, where she would be seen in the ladies' room, combing her hair with her \"dinglehopper\", but the directors didn't want Jodi Benson's voice to go to waste, so Ariel's role was expanded to have her sing during When You Wish Upon a Star.\n\nAccording to a post of an initial storyboard for the ending photo shot, Roger Rabbit, the Far From the Tree raccoons, and Yo Yo Flamingo were planned to appear but were seemingly removed at some point in production. The raccoons were cut because of difficulty in adding the CG characters onto the hand drawn moving trees from Flowers and Trees whilst they were down to the wire. The flamingo was also left behind (despite making a cameo in the credits of Wish).[16]\n\nThe storyboard version of the short was shown in the D23 Expo for 2024, and even including the deleted scenes.\n\nSome characters were originally going to appear in the short, such as Willie the Giant,[17] but he ultimately didn't appear, most likely due to his size.\n\nAurora and Jasmine are the only two Disney Princesses to have no speaking or singing lines in the short, aside from the final verse of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", However Salonga didin't sing as Jasmine but goes to Mulan.\n\nThis was the final project to involve any music from Richard M. Sherman before his death in 2024.\n\nIf one does not count The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh characters as also representing Winne the Pooh (film), this would be the only Disney Animated Canon film to not be represented, as Christopher Robin uses his classic design rather than his unique design from that film and the sole character to debut in it, The Backson, does not appear (despite making a cameo in the credits of Strange World).\n\nDespite legal issues, the Tarzan characters are still in the short.\n\nArchive audio re-usage[]\n\nActive audio voice footage from various Walt Disney Animation Studios productions were used in this short to voice certain characters. Among of them include:\n\nDonald Duck short series (Donald's grumbling)\n\nGoofy short series (Goofy's signature holler)\n\nPinocchio (Stromboli's cussing, Jiminy Cricket singing the penultimate line of \"When You Wish Upon A Star\")\n\nBambi (Thumper:(laughs) \"Wake up! Wake up!\", Flower:(laughs))\n\nThe Wind in the Willows from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (J Thaddeus Toad: \"Tally-ho! Whee! I'll show you the world! (laughs)\")\n\nCinderella (Jaq: \"Zuk, zuk!\", Gus' chuckle)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (Cheshire Cat's laughing)\n\nPeter Pan (Peter Pan: \"C'mon everybody, here we go!!!\", some of Peter's rooster crows)\n\nLady and the Tramp (Trusty: \"I don't recollect if I ever mentioned Old Reliable before. He'd say uh-\")\n\nSleeping Beauty (Flora: \"Make it pink!\", Merryweather: \"(groans) Make it blue!\")\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (Winnie the Pooh: \"Ooh! ooh, help, and bother\")\n\nThe Jungle Book (Kaa singing \"Trust in Me\", Kaa: Ooh!)\n\nPete's Dragon (Eliott's muttering)\n\nThe Rescuers (some of Bernard's screams)\n\nMickey's Christmas Carol (Scrooge McDuck: \"Whoa!\")\n\nOliver & Company (Dodger's howling)\n\nThe Little Mermaid (Ursula: \"Oh, no no no no no\", some of Max's barks)\n\nThe Rescuers Down Under (Cody: \"Whoa! Higher!\", some of Joanna's growls)\n\nAladdin (Genie: \"Oy! I' haven't seen a fall like that since Rome! Oh, Much better\", some of Abu's monkey chirps)\n\nThe audio used for Genie in this short originates from an unused recording of Robin Williams as said character for the 1992 film, which was intended to be used in one scene in the film but ended up being unused.\n\nThe Lion King (Rafiki: (chuckles) It is time\")\n\nThe Emperor's New Groove (Kuzco: \"No touchy!\")\n\nLilo & Stitch (some of Stitch's growling)\n\nTreasure Planet (Jim Hawkins: \"Whoo-hoo!\")\n\nMeet the Robinsons (some of Bowler Hat Guy's grunts)\n\nBolt (Rhino: \"Awesome!\")\n\nThe Princess and the Frog (some of Louis' trumpeting)\n\nWreck-It-Ralph (Vanellope von Schweetz: \"Whoo-hoo!\")\n\nRaya and the Last Dragon (Sisu's gasps and laughs)\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOnce Upon a Studio on Wikipedia\n\nSee also[]"
