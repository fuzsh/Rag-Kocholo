        "text": "Ready in around 30 minutes, this penne alla vodka is one of my go-to pasta dinners when I’m looking for an easy-to-make recipe that more than delivers on flavor and comfort. Making homemade pasta sauce does require a bit more effort than opening a jar, but trust me—with this vodka sauce, it makes all the difference. After trying and testing this recipe again and again to perfect the bright, creamy sauce that coats every noodle, I’ve finally cracked the code to the best-ever vodka sauce.\n\nWant to know my secret for the perfect vodka sauce? A LOT of tomato paste. Tomato paste has a more concentrated flavor than canned tomatoes, and texture-wise it makes for a smoother, more velvety sauce. If you’re all about a saucy pasta (and with this one, how couldn’t you be?), I recommend doubling the sauce.\n\nHow To Make Penne Alla Vodka\n\nIngredients\n\nButter: I always find butter, rather than oil, to be the best match for dairy-based sauces like this one.\n\nTomato Paste: After exhaustive testing, I concluded that canned tomatoes just can’t rival the concentrated depth and fruitiness of tomato paste. Plus, they make for a smoother sauce.\n\nRed Pepper Flakes: I included just enough to add a touch of warmth to the sauce.\n\nVodka: No gimmick, the vodka contributes heat and acidity that cut through the richness of the sauce and bring out the fruitiness of the tomato paste.\n\nPasta: As you can see from the pictures, you don’t need to use penne. Feel free to add in your favorite pasta—just make sure it’s one that catches plenty of sauce. I prefer the fatter rigatoni tubes because the middles catch more sauce.\n\nCream: Heavy cream is essential for giving the sauce its velvety consistency.\n\nParmesan: It seasons, it thickens, and it brings boatloads of nutty, savory umami flavor.\n\nStep-By-Step Instructions\n\nReady to build some flavor? Let’s go! Start by gently cooking the shallot and garlic in butter, stirring often with a wooden spoon (better for scraping the pan later on), until softened and translucent but not browned. Use a large skillet or an enameled Dutch oven for this; I would avoid uncoated cast-iron, as it may react with the sauce, introducing off-flavors.\n\nIn go the tomato paste and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until the paste coats the alliums and is starting to darken. Now stir in the vodka, scraping up any browned bits, and remove the pot from the heat; we’ll get back to it in a minute!\n\nTime to boil some pasta. Use a large pot and be sure to salt the water generously. When the pasta is al dente (meaning it’s still just a wee bit firm at the core), scoop out 2 cups of the pasta water and then drain the pasta.\n\nOkay, back to the sauce. Bring the sauce to a simmer over medium heat and stir in 1/4 c. pasta water and the cream.\n\nSprinkle half of the Parmesan over and stir until melted and combined.\n\nNow turn off the heat and stir in the drained pasta and remaining Parmesan. If the pasta is looking a little dry, stir in more pasta water, a tablespoon at a time. Taste and season with salt if needed.\n\nDivide the pasta among bowls and serve topped with still more Parmesan and basil leaves.\n\nFull list of ingredients and directions can be found in the recipe below.\n\nRecipe Tips\n\nCan you omit the vodka? While vodka is not absolutely necessary, this sauce wouldn’t really be the same without it (hence, the name). If you’d really prefer it without, you can omit, but it enhances all of the bright, sharp flavors in your creamy sauce, and is what makes vodka sauce, vodka sauce.\n\nCan kids eat penne alla vodka? It’s best to avoid serving penne alla vodka to kids. To reap the full flavor benefits of the vodka, it’s important to retain some alcohol in the sauce. That’s why I only add the vodka toward the end of cooking. If serving young’uns, you’re best off omitting the vodka altogether.\n\nVariations & Additions\n\nPancetta, bacon, or prosciutto. Starting with a cold skillet, cook 6 oz. chopped pancetta, bacon, or prosciutto over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the pork is crisp. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.\n\nRotisserie chicken. Separate the breast meat from the chicken, remove the skin, and use your hands or a fork to shred the meat into bite-sized pieces. Toss into the pasta and sauce, just before topping with Parmesan and basil.\n\nSautéed veggies. Broccoli, mushrooms, and zucchini are all great options for adding an extra serving of veggies to this dish. Toss 1 cup of sautéed, seasoned vegetables into the finished pasta and season to taste with salt.\n\nStorage\n\nIf you end up not using all of your sauce, store it in the fridge for 4 to 5 days, then reheat and add to freshly boiled pasta (or whatever you please)."
