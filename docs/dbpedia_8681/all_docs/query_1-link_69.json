        "text": "Unknown\n\nI’m extremely disappointed with the facilities and services at your hotel, which do not live up to the standards of a luxury establishment. The spa was particularly underwhelming—the showers lacked hot water, and the steam room was out of order. Before booking, we specifically called to confirm that the spa was fully functional, only to arrive and find a very limited offering—no jacuzzi, pool, or any area to relax. The spa consisted of only a small dry sauna, with no cold plunge or proper cooling-off area. Additionally, our room had such dirty windows that the beautiful San Francisco view was cloudy. This is far below what we expected.\n\nMe\n\nExperience was good. We were there the same time the vice president was staying at the hotel. There weren’t very many meals served at the hotel that were gluten friendly. But I bet if the vice president had a gluten allergy they would have lot more options.\n\nBrett\n\nFantastic stay!\n\nAnne is the best hotel manager ever! She helped our group with everything we needed. Was very patient with us and always had a super positive attitude. I hope we get to work together in the future!!\n\nMarc O.\n\nGreat stay Wonderful hotel with a great team.\n\nDespite a large police and secret service detail at the hotel on our arrival due to the security needed for Kamala Harris, the staff made it as convenient as possible to check in. We stayed in the old building and loved its comfortable room with wonderful views over the city. We had a great stay and a special thank you to Habib at the front desk for going above and beyond to make our stay memorable.\n\nCristienne D.\n\nSafe\n\nI stayed there because my flight was delayed and I know is the safes area of the city. Staff was very helpful and charming. On the day I left I noticed there aren't any staff to help with suit cases. The room had no robe or sleepers. The carpets could use a good shampoo clean and the windows need a better cleaning, so as to be actually clean-clean. I would advice to have a printed menu because the tablet was not comfortable to order. Also, if you can't afford to print and send up unstained paper menus, laminate them so they can be wiped."
