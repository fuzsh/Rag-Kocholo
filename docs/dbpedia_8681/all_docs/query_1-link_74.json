These may include scale and perspective drawing, character and environment design and 3D software.\n\nUnit 2: Designing and staging\n\nYou’ll learn skills and techniques for communicating ideas through storyboarding, environment design, visual language and staging. Alongside this you’ll look at character design, including traditional and digital layout techniques for cinematic pre-visualisation concept art, anatomical studies. You’ll also have introductory software workshops.\n\nUnit 3: Exploring ideas\n\nYou’ll be introduced to techniques and design concepts involved in extending and re-creating environments for cinematic effects using 3D software. You’ll begin to understand the use of lighting and camera techniques to combine live action and synthetic screen elements.\n\nUnit 4: Who are you? Establishing practice\n\nThis unit is the first group project within the course and will introduce you to the full production cycle for creating a short, animated film. Bringing together many of the disciplines introduced so far, the unit aims to provide an understanding of the complete cinematic production pipeline. It will look at the different elements required for creating an animated film from start to finish. These include idea generation, concept art, cinematography and staging, environment and character design, 3D modelling and texturing, animation and postproduction.\n\nYear 2\n\nUnit 5: Collaborative and collective practices\n\nYou’ll be introduced to different ways in which collaborative working can help you to focus and enhance your own creative strengths. You’ll have the chance to work with fellow students and creative communities.\n\nUnit 6: Conceptualising ideas\n\nIn this unit you’ll look at designing and asset creation for a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. The unit will aim to introduce you to a real-time development environment and add a new dimension to the 3D and staging skills learned in previous units. This will allow you to familiarise yourself with the unique aspects of VR, including the sense of presence, depth perception and the potential for interactivity. The unit explores design techniques for a 360-degree environment and pays attention to scale, depth and details to make users feel present in the virtual world.\n\nUnit 7: Who in the world?\n\nThis unit deepens your understanding of concept art and character design.
