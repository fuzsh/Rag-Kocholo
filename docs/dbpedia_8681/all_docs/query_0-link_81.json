        "text": "Professor of Latin\n\n⮚ UCL profile\n\nemail: m.wyke@ucl.ac.uk external telephone: 020 7679 7491 (internal: 27491) consultation hours in spring term 2024: drop in Thursdays 13:00-13:45 or email to arrange an appointment on another day (either face to face or online via Teams or zoom).\n\nResearch\n\nInterests: Latin literature (especially Roman love poetry); ancient gender and sexuality; classical antiquity on film; classical reception studies (esp. classics and popular culture); ancient and modern civilisations.\n\nResearch supervision: I welcome phd students with interests in any of the above areas. Topics I have supervised include Sulpicia and her Reception; Greek myth & history on film; the divinity of Augustus in Roman poetry; translations of Ovid's Ars Amatoria in early modern England; Roman emotions and Ben-Hur in literature, on stage and on screen; Thermopylae in Hollywood cinema; the concept of the mirror in Graeco-Roman culture; the modern reception of the myth of Scylla; the reception of Julius Caesar from Tiberius to Trajan. I regularly co-supervise with colleagues in other departments, such as Archaeology, Anthropology, English and Film Studies. I also welcome visiting research students, and topics of visiting students I have supervised include Latin love poetry; Roman drama; Caesar's de bello Gallico; Roman warfare on film and television; the Ides of March in contemporary culture.\n\nTeaching\n\nAt undergraduate level, I teach Roman love poetry (which situates the poetic language of love in its specifically Roman historical context, and relates it to Roman attitudes to gender, sexuality, morality and politics) and Latin Poetry and its Translations (currently based on translations of Horace's Odes and covering English versions from the 1600s to the 21st century). I also teach an MA module on Ancient Rome on Film (from early experiments through to the modern blockbuster, we explore what distinguishes cinematic histories of Rome from other historical forms and why they matter). I also direct the core course for our MA degree in The Reception of the Classical World that considers the importance of Reception Studies for Classics, and investigates case studies of reception from within antiquity to the twenty-first century (from literature to political and intellectual thought, visual arts to museum exhibitions, theatre to film and television).\n\nResearch projects on screen media\n\n(1) The AHRC-funded collaborative project Museum of Dreams (2023-26) seeks to establish a better understanding of both the modern reception of classical antiquity and the transnational history of silent cinema. It investigates how, thanks to cinema, classical antiquity was rendered a powerfully immersive democratic dreamworld while, thanks to classical antiquity, cinema laid claim to the status of an educative art - a 'museum of dreams'. The project will produce a systematic analysis of the 70+ silent film prints in the British National Film Archive (BFI) that engage with ancient Greece and Rome and, thereby, situate the UK firmly within the global network that produced, exhibited, and consumed the classical antiquity films of the early twentieth century. It will create an online resource that will include direct access to many digitised versions of these films and develop an important future use for them beyond academia and the archive, in cinemas, schools, heritage sites, and museums. Museum of Dreams (further information).\n\n(2) Ancient Rome on Film makes a vital contribution to the field of popular receptions of classical culture. It explores how and why film constructs a richly imagined, immersive Roman world and investigates how millions worldwide have experienced that past world. I am currently completing a monograph on Ancient Rome in Silent Cinema for the University of Michigan Press. See further this short summary of related impact activity.\n\n(3) Audio-Visual Romans, supported by the UCL Cities partnership Programme and in collaboration with Monika Woźniak of Sapienza (University of Rome), explores the imaginative power of modern audio/visual media to shape our perception of the past. For consumers across the globe, it is often in A/V media that they find their most personal and seemingly authentic experience of ancient Rome. The project’s first conference in 2018 was dedicated to Nero, the second conference in 2021 was dedicated to Julius Caesar. The conference in May 2022 concerned Audio-Visual Roman Women, and the conference of May 2023 continued the theme Audio-Visual Romans: Women Speak Up! The papers from those last two conferences are currently being prepared for an edited volume Ancient Roman Women in Screen Media and will be published by Bloomsbury.\n\nPublications and Talks\n\nco-author with Monika Wozniak of Quo vadis.
