This stunning museum is located near the Expo site of Paris Le Bourget airport. This site is the host for the Paris Airshow once every two years as well. The museum offers some great expositions of the French aviation industry with examples of experimental aircraft and even some spacecraft. Highlights are te Boeing 747-200, the Concorde and it's prototype and Ariane rocket.

The museum offers some great views over the apron and runway as well so some rare business jets can be photographed from here. All in all a great day out for the aviation enthusiast!
