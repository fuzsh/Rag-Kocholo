The AIR LEGEND airshow is a now unmissable event that takes place every year, during the second weekend of Septembre, at the Melun-Villaroche aerodrome, 40 km south-east of Paris.

This exceptional show presents flight displays of legendary aircraft, which are rarely or have never been seen in France.
