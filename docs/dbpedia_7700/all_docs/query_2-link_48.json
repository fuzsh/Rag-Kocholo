        "text": "Since 1943, the U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) Band has fostered the tradition of performing live music for official military functions and community outreach events, throughout the continents of Europe and Africa. The USAFE Band traces back its origins to Greenwood Army Airfield, Mississippi, where it was activated on February 1st, 1943, as the 386th Army Air Forces Band.\n\nStarting as an organization of just five members, the band quickly grew to forty-five strong. The young unit's primary mission was to develop a spectacular stage show, to entertain U.S. troops and boost their morale. In addition to performing traditional military ceremonial and parade music, members formed a dance band which performed for evening events on Post, playing the popular swing music of the era, as composed by the Army Air Corps' own Major Glenn Miller, among others."
