        "text": "French Airport Tax\n\nFrench Airport Tax (Tarif de sûreté et de sécurité et Tarif de péréquation aéroportuaire de la Taxe sur le transport aérien de passagers) is charged on the carriage of passengers, from an aerodrome situated on French territory (Metropolitan France, French overseas departments and collectivities), on board commercially operated flights.\n\nWhat is French Airport Tax?\n\nAirport Tax applies to passengers departing on board commercial aircraft from an aerodrome situated on French territory (Metropolitan France, French overseas departments and collectivities). Airports with traffic below a yearly average of 5000 units (1 unit equals 1 passenger or 100 kg of freight) are outside of the scope of the scheme.

It does not apply to non-commercial operators as these are exempt. Several other flight and passenger exemptions apply, most notably, the exemption of flights following a tech stop or a forced landing due to bad weather or mechanical failure. Flight crew and children below the age of two are also exempt.\n\nObligations under the Airport Tax?\n\nTax liability arises when boarding the aircraft. Regulated aircraft operators must:"
