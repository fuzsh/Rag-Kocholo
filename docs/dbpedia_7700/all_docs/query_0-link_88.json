        "text": "Introducion\n\nI was invited to a friend's graduation at MIT in Boston, and decided to extend a bit more my holidays, to finally visit the one and only New York!\n\nFlying blue Miles earned with this flight: 150\n\n(before the program changed to a revenue-based model)\n\nAt london heathrow airport\n\nI arrived at the airport and first went to the Air France/ KLM counters to drop my luggage off.\n\nAll the skyteam airlines depart from Terminal 4, not the best looking terminal at heathrow (mind you, Terminal 1 was still open at the time) however rather functinonal.\n\nThe security lanes are quite short and you very quickly end up in the duty free boutiques and coffee area. I had time to grab a coffee, and, I guess like most of us, enjoyed the view on the runway in use for take off that day, from the Terminal 4.\n\nThe skyteam airline short - haul flights usually depart from the north (right side) of the Terminal 4 building, between gates 19 to 25, and my flight was no exception.\n\nAircraft: Airbus A320-214\n\nRegistration: F-HEPB\n\nEngines: CFM56\n\nAge: 5 Years (in 2015)\n\nLayout: C32 Y126\n\nObservation: Leased for Air France\n\nThe AvGEEK BIT\n\nAir France operates 7 daily flights on this route to the Terminal 4 of London Heathrow. Even though this aircraft was fairly new, it was equiped with the old recaro seats, which weren't that confortable.\n\nAt the time the airline was starting to retrofit its aircraft with the new Best & Beyound option, which now currently equipes this particular unit.\n\nAir France operates 43 A320s, of which 26 like this one are assigned to the European destinations, 2 in the french oversea territories in the west indies, and the rest for homeland cities.\n\non board the a320\n\nThe service was a bit rushed, however compliant with the airline's standards: coffee, tea or alcoholic beverages were offered, with a snack.\n\nThere was no entertainment on board, except the usual detailed Air France magasine - which i guess was enough for a 45 min long flight.\n\nApproaching CDG, the crew advised us the departure gates for the next connection flights, as usual, but still appreciated!\n\nMy seat was 14F, just above the wing; interetinsgly there was no row 13 per Air France Cabin plan at the time. The seats were still the old Recaro seats, whereas nowadays Air France has retrofitted its narrow body fleet with smart and beyound seats.\n\nThere is another picture i found from another flight around the same time, I wanted to ask you since I noticed some cabins have a red colouring, some others dont"
