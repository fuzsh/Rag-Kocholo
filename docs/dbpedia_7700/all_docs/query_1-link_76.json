All of these combine to make OCEM the best choice on the market.\n\nThe CCRs requested by ADP are the company’s best-selling DIAM 4200, suitable for 2.5 kVA to 20 kVA.\n\nThe DIAM4200 series CCRs are based on a VeryHF AC Chopper, an optimized static devices controlled by insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) bridges. It is unprecedented by design for single and double phase architectures.\n\nThey are designed to maintain a constant, pre-displayed and adjustable output current independent of load or power supply fluctuations. The devices are specially designed for visual aids supplies, particularly LED lights.\n\nOCEM is confident this project represents the start of a new long-term collaboration with ADP and Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport. The company is proud to work with an airport that serves nearly 66 million passengers annually, and is inspired to continue to push the boundaries of technological discovery.\n\nOCEM Airfield Technology\n\nLighting the future\n\nABOUT OCEM"
