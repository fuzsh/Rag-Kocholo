        "text": "Groupe ADP, Volocopter, the French Civil Aviation Authority (DGAC) and the region of Paris have confirmed that electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) air taxi services are set to commence in time for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games.\n\nWith this launch, Paris will be the first European city, and perhaps the first city worldwide, to offer passenger eVTOL services. These services will be available to the general public in addition to the public transportation systems in Paris.\n\nThis announcement was made at the International Paris Air Show following one and a half years of testing at the Pontoise testbed.\n\nEdward Arkwright, Groupe ADP Deputy CEO, said:\n\nThe 2023 Paris Air Show at Le Bourget, the cradle of aviation pioneers, will be the turning point in the take-off of new electric air mobility: the transition from dream to reality. All the indicators are green for a successful summer 2024. The challenges ahead are huge, but they are a great source of pride for all those involved in the project, with whom we share the conviction that carbon-free air travel also brings new services.\n\nThe companies have also released details of the first routes that will be served by Volocopter’s eVTOLs:\n\nParis-Charles de Gaulle Airport <> Paris-Le Bourget Airport\n\nAusterlitz Barge Vertiport <> Paris Heliport\n\nParis Heliport <> Airfield of Saint-Cyr-l’École (Versailles)\n\nVertiport construction at these sites will commence this summer in time for the planned commercial launch in 2024.\n\nEach vertiport will feature passenger terminals alongside 1 to 3 take-off and landing spots.\n\nVolocopter is currently the only eVTOL company on track to achieve certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2024.\n\nIf granted, this certification will enable it to fly its VoloCity aircraft at heights below 500 meters. This aircraft has capacity for one pilot and one passenger.\n\nDirk Hoke, CEO of Volocopter, said:\n\nWe are counting down the days to making electric air taxis a reality. Together with our French partners, we will take command in decarbonising aviation, slowly but surely.\n\nBeyond taxiing passengers, Volocopter is also collaborating with air rescue operator, ADAC Luftrettung to deploy eVTOLs in emergency medical services.\n\nTags"
