        "text": "Flak Report:\n\nTarget - Villacoublay, France\n\n1. Route followed. - Landfall at St. Valery, Yvetot to Duclair to Elbeuf to Evreux. Left turn over St. Andre, [unreadable] to target. Right turn over Arpajon, Ablis. Right turn to Breux-Damville-Bernay out over Trouville.\n\n2. Visibility at Target. - Condensation trails spasmodic â in and out. Visibility â fair â 3 to 5/10 clouds at target and IP [Initial Point of Bomb Run]. 8/10 clouds from coast to IP.\n\n3. No. of A/C over Target: 22\n\n4. General Axis of attack. - 140Â°\n\n5. How long did formation fly straight and level before bombing? - 30\n\n6. Turn after bombing. - Turn to right - 180Â° heading.\n\n7. Position of Group in relation to other Groups: 351st GP lead - 91st low â composite high.\n\n8. What evasive action was taken? - Moderate turning.\n\n9. A short description of Flak enroute. - First encounter at Rouen â meager and to left but good altitude. Several bursts at Elbeuf and Evreux, both meager â good for deflection but low. Several bursts, low and trailing at St. Andre. All of these used following type. At target, flak was moderate and very good for deflection and only slightly low. It is believed a concentrated barrage was met just at target â changing to following immediately afterward. On run out, 3 bursts were seen far to south of course near Chartres and only other encounter was at Trouville where batteries at La Havre tried few long range bursts with poor results.\n\n10. Any other comments, phenomena, etc. - At Elbeuf only one black burst seen, this was 3 times normal size of burst."
