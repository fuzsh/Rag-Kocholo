The main gateway into the City of Light is named after the former President of France, Charles de Gaulle (1890–1970), one of nation’s most influential politicians in its history.\n\n(LFPG, CDG) Charles de Gaulle handled nearly 66 million passengers in 2015, while registering nearly half a million aircraft movements, making it the 8th busiest airport in the world, and the 2nd busiest in Europe behind (EGLL, LHR) London Heathrow. In terms of air cargo, the 2nd busiest cargo airport in Europe (Frankfurt Airport tops the list)\n\nIt’s the main hub for Air France, and the European hub for Delta Air Lines, providing four massive runways to handle any size aircraft, and lots of them. Although (CDG) Charles De Gaulle accepts business jet traffic, it’s main functions is commercial traffic, creating some limitations.\n\nFirst, slots are required for private jets to arrive at Charles De Gaulle (learn more about private jets and airport slots). Additionally, any plane carrying less than 25 passengers must receive prior permission to land, and it can take up to 24 hours to process a request; corporate jets requesting to land may be denied permission if the passengers do not have connections to commercial flights.\n\nFinally, stage three and stage two aircraft have limited to departure times between 5 a.m. and 11:59 a.m. local time, and 6:01 a.m. and 11:14 p.m, respectively.\n\nThat said, business jet passengers connecting to a commercial airline can still use Charles de Gaulle, but aircraft are only permitted to stay on the ground for a limited time, and must depart once commercial aviation customers have departed.\n\nParis–Orly Airport\n\n(LFPO, ORY) Paris–Orly Airport\n\nAlias: Villeneuve-Orly Airport\n\nFrench: Aéroport de Paris-Orly\n\nFBO:\n\nRunway: 11,975 feet (3,650 m)\n\nWebsite: http://www.airport-orly.com/\n\nCharter a private flight to Paris Orly Airport (IATA: ORY, ICAO: LFPO), an international airport located 8 miles south of the city in both Orly and Villeneuve-le-Roi.

Orly remains the busiest airport in France for domestic traffics, and the 2nd busiest overall, handling nearly 30 million passengers in 2015.\n\nLike Charles de Gaulle, there are similar restrictions in place for private aviation at Orly, and business jets can only access the airport for diplomatic reasons or with travelers connecting to a commercial flight. Slots are also required at Orly, and land permits/prior permission must be obtained for international flights and flights carrying 25 or more passengers. Orly operates between 6 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. local time.\n\nParis–Le Bourget Airport\n\n(LFPB, LBG) Paris–Le Bourget Airport\n\nFrench: Aéroport de Paris-Le Bourget\n\nFBO Service: Advanced Air Support | Dassault Falcon Service | Jetex | Signature LBG (Terminals 1 and 3) | Sky Valet | Universal Aviation France\n\nRunway Length: 9,813 feet (2,991 m)\n\nWebsite: http://www.parisaeroport.fr/\n\nRent a private jet to/from Paris–Le Bourget Airport (IATA: LBG, ICAO: LFPB), the busiest executive airport in Europe since 2007.

From its beautiful city plan, exquisite architecture and world famous museums and monuments, to sidewalk cafés, luxurious boulevards and elegant dining, Paris charms private jet travelers from around the world.\n\nFrom Nostradamus to Albert Camus, Napoleon to Charles de Gaulle, and Voltaire to Rene Descartes, the city has been home to some of the most brilliant minds in art, science and military; the aura of romance and mystery surrounding Paris has made it the setting for many novels and movies.\n\nParis was originally founded on a small island located in the middle of the Seine River. The city rapidly expanded along both river banks, and by the 12th century, it was the western world’s largest city, a major trade center, and home to one of the first academic institutions in Europe, the University of Paris.\n\nToday, it’s one of the world’s most beautiful and romantic cities, home to a rich history and a modern hub for culture, art, fashion, food and design. It’s also one of Europe’s main culinary centers, and only Tokyo has more Michelin restaurants.\n\nThe “City of Light” (la Ville Lumière) is also known as the “Capital of Fashion”, and is one of the fashion leaders of the Western world alongside New York, London, and Milan. Some of the world’s finest, most luxurious fashion designers and cosmetic companies are based in Paris, including Chanel, Dior, Yves Saint-Laurent, Guerlain, Lancôme, L’Oréal, Clarins, and more. Book your private jet to Paris with Air Charter Advisors, and read more about everything the city offers luxury private jet travelers below.\n\nClimate\n\nParis is located in Western Europe, and features a maritime climate with cool winters and warm summers – the Atlantic Ocean helps to moderate extremes temperatures in much of western Europe, including France.\n\nEven in January, the city’s coldest month, temperatures average 43°F (6°C), and are almost always above the freezing point. Snow is uncommon, although it may fall a few times a year. Most of the precipitation comes from light showers that occur year-round.\n\nSpring and fall are normally cool and wet, while Summers are sublime, with warm and pleasant temperatures averaging 77°F (25°C) during mid-summer months. With amazing weather and many of the city’s most popular events take place during the summer, May through August is the best time for private jet travelers to visit Paris.\n\nEconomy\n\nParis is home to more than 12 million residents in its metropolitan area and one of the top economies in the world.\n\nThe central business district of the City of Paris is home the lion’s share of economic activity, while La Défense and it’s two extensions, Neuilly-sur-Seine and Levallois-Perret, are important financial districts. Boulogne-Billancourt, Issy-les-Moulineaux and southern parts of the 15th arrondissement are the center for Parisian media and information technology.\n\nThe top 10 companies in France listed on the 2015 Fortune Global 500 have headquarters in the city; six in the central business district; four in the Hauts-de-Seine Department; three in La Défense and one in Boulogne-Billancourt. No wonder it’s a haven for business jets.\n\nParis, with a 2014 GDP of $865 billion (€650 billion), is the leading region for economic activity in France, and in light of the Brexit vote, its GDP has it competing with London for the leader of Europe.\n\nEvents\n\nAs a world leader in finance, geopolitics, culture, art, athletics, fashion, food and design, there’s always something happening in Paris.\n\nThings slow down in February and August during holiday season, when it’s hard to find Parisians since what seems like half of the city half of vacations in the the Alps or Western France. The busiest tourist season last from the fall after or “back to school” week (la rentrée scolaire) until the Noël shows at Parisian theaters, cinemas and concert halls for the Christmas holiday.\n\nThe events calendar starts off with Maison & Object, a furniture and interior decorating trade fair held in in January. The Chinese New Year (le nouvel an chinois) is celebrated in February just as it is in other cities with a large Chinese population; there are parades in the 3rd, 4th and 20th arrondissements, but especially in the Chinatown section of in the 13th arrondissement south of Place d’Italie.\n\nIn February, you can also check out the Salon international de l’Agriculture (International farming fair/festival) where you can taste the best products the region has to offer, including wine, cheeses, delicatessen, honey and spices.\n\nFor Valentine’s Day, there’s no place in the world more romantic than this. One of the spots worth visiting on a romantic private jet getaway is the Square des Abbesses in Montmarte-La Chapelle to check out the ‘I love you’ wall (le mur des je t’aime).\n\nThe first of two Fashion weeks takes place in March, when Spring Fashion Week provides designers with a platform for women’s ready to wear collections (prêt-à-porter) for the following winter. Fashion Week returns again in October, showing off collections for the following summer.\n\nAthletic events heat up in May, when the Ligue 1 season draws to a close and PSG competes in the Champions League. Over two weeks beginning on the last Sunday of May, the world’s top clay court players in Men’s & Women’s tennis are decided at the French Open.\n\nThe summer solstice (June) is celebrated during the Fête de la Musique, with free, city-wide concerts by amateur musicians until 1am (sometimes later), and the Gay Pride parade, one of the largest and most inclusive in the world, takes place on June 26th.\n\nLa Fête Nationale, the French national holiday referred to as Bastille Day, takes place on July 14th and celebrates the storming of the infamous Bastille during the French Revolution.\n\nDuring Bastille Day, the French Capital hosts a variety of spectacular events, the most well-known event being the Bastille Parade, held along the Champs-Élysées. The parade features the French army, including tanks and an aerial acrobatics show by the Patrouille de France, a group of highly-skilled pilots similar to the British Red Arrows and the Blue Angels.\n\nThe Tour de France takes place in July and is the world’s premier cycling event; although the route varies annually, it always finishes on the last Sunday of July under the Arc de Triomphe.\n\nLe Beaujolais Nouveau, the most popular vin de primeur, is released on the third Thursday of November (Beaujolais Nouveau Day), marking the beginning of the Christmas season. Christmas lights are lit in a ceremony on the Champs-Élysées, attending by thousands of visitors and dignitaries, including the president of France.\n\nLandmarks and Museums\n\nIconic landmarks and world-renowned museums such as the Arc de Triomphe, Notre-Dame, the Louvre Museum and the world’s most visited tourist site, the Eiffel Tower, make Paris one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.\n\nOne of the great pleasures you can experience during your visit to the City of Light is walking the streets of Paris – it’s entirely possible to cross the entire city in just a few hours if you can somehow keep yourself away from stopping at a café or a boutique shop.\n\nThe city of Paris is split into 20 arrondissements, each with its own character and appeal. The right bank of the Seine developed into the city’s commercial center, and the left bank is where you’ll find the University, as well as all things artsy and intellectual.\n\nLandmarks\n\nThe city’s center makes up the first eight arrondissements, and is where most of the historical and cultural landmarks can be found. One of the most easily recognizable structures in the world, the Eiffel Tower is the world’s most visited tourist attraction and has inspired more than 30 replicas world-wide. Breathtaking views of Paris can be had from atop its 1,063 foot tall observation deck.\n\nThe most beautiful avenue in Paris is the world-famous Champs-Élysées, located in the 8th arrondissement. Known for its theaters, cafés and luxury and boutique shops, it’s also the location of the annual military parade to celebrate Bastille Day, and the Arc de Triomphe can be found standing at the west end of the Champs-Élysées.\n\nVersailles Palace, also know as “Château de Versailles”, was commissioned by the Sun King, Louis the XIV, to escape the political turmoil of the capital city. The Palace is located in nearby Versailles, and served as the official royal residence for the Kings of France from 1682 to 1790, when they were forced to return due to the French Revolution.\n\nMuseums\n\nParis is the home to the most famous art museums in the world – there’s the Louvre, the world’s most visited museum where you’ll find Da Vinci’s Mona Lisa; the Musée d’Orsay (pictured below), celebrated for its French Impressionist collection and featuring works by Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh and others; and the Musée National d’Art Moderne, a modern and contemporary art gallery.\n\nOne of the most convenient ways to experience all the sights Paris has to offer is with a Museum Pass, a pre-paid entry card allowing you to visit more than 70 museums and monuments, including the Palace of Versailles. Passes are available for 2, 4, and 6 consecutive days. The Museum Pass allows you to skip queues, a huge advantage if you’re flying private during peak tourist season.\n\nAll national museums and monuments are free every first Sunday of the month, and many public museums and monuments are free for EU citizens or long term residents. However, be aware that several museums, restaurants, and other locations close during August for the traditional Parisian vacation month.\n\nEiffel Tower\n\nChamp de Mars, 5 Avenue Anatole France, 75007\n\n+33 (89) 270-1239\n\nhttp://www.toureiffel.paris/\n\nChateau de Versailles\n\nPlace d’Armes, 78000 Versailles, France\n\n+33 (13) 0 83 78 00\n\nhttp://en.chateauversailles.fr/homepage\n\nNotre Dame Cathedral\n\n6 Parvis Notre-Dame, Place Jean-Paul II, 75004, France\n\n+33 (14) 234-5610\n\nhttp://www.notredamedeparis.fr/-English-\n\nThe Louvre\n\nMusée du Louvre, 75058, France\n\n+33 (14) 020-5317\n\nhttp://www.louvre.fr/en\n\nArc de Triomphe\n\nPlace Charles de Gaulle, 75008, France\n\n+33 1 55 37 73 77\n\nhttp://www.arcdetriompheparis.com/\n\nMusee d’Orsay\n\n1 Rue de la Légion d’Honneur, 75007, France\n\n+33 1 40 49 48 14\n\nhttp://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html?cHash=1030a57d48\n\nLuxembourg Gardens\n\n6th arrondissement, 75006, France\n\n+33 (14) 234-2362\n\nhttp://www.senat.fr/visite/jardin/index.html\n\nPalais Garnier (National Opera)\n\n8 Rue Scribe, 75009\n\n+33 (17) 125-2423\n\nhttps://www.operadeparis.fr/en/\n\nSainte-Chapelle\n\n8 Boulevard du Palais, 75001\n\n+33 (15) 340-6080\n\nhttp://sainte-chapelle.monuments-nationaux.fr/\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\n82 Boulevard de Clichy\n\n+33 1 53 09 82 82\n\nhttp://www.moulinrouge.fr/\n\nLuxury Hotels\n\nParis, the glamorous capital of Franceknown throughout the world as “The City of Lights”, is one of the most visited cities every year, and a popular request for private charter flights.\n\nHome to the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, the Louvre and many other famous landmarks and museums, the city is also home to an excess of five-star luxury hotels.
