        "text": "Despite terrible injuries, including a twice broken jaw and dislocated knee, Charles Nungesser achieved ten victories in the battle of Verdun.\n\nNungesser's death remains a mystery. On 8 May 1927, he and François Coli left LeBourget Field near Paris on an historic nonstop flight to New York in a biplane called l'Oiseau Blanc (the White Bird). They were never seen again. Following an exhaustive investigation, the French government published a report in 1984 which concluded that Nungesser probably reached North America.\n\nFrance Loses Hope for Atlantic Airmen\n\nThe Chronicle-Telegram - Wednesday, May 11, 1927\n\n\"Skull fracture, brain concussion, internal injuries (multiple), five fractures of the upper jaw, two fractures of lower jaw, piece of anti-aircraft shrapnel imbedded in right arm, dislocation of knees (left and right), re-dislocation of left knee, bullet wound in mouth, bullet wound in ear, atrophy of tendons in left leg, atrophy of muscles in calf, dislocated clavicle, dislocated wrist, dislocated right ankle, loss of teeth, contusions too numerous to mention.\" Injuries sustained by Charles Nungesser during World War I \"Brigadier of the 2nd Light Cavalry Regiment; on 3 September 1914, with his officer having been wounded during the course of a reconnaissance, he at first sheltered him, then with the assistance of several foot soldiers, after having replaced the officer who was disabled, he secured an auto and brought back the papers by crossing an area under fire by the enemy.\" Médaille Militaire citation \"Pilot detached at his own request to an Escadrille in the rear, has never ceased since his arrival to seek any occasion to fly; flying up to four hours, thirty minutes each day in spite of the inclement weather. During the course of his last combat he gave proof of the highest moral qualities by approaching to within 10 meters the enemy machine he was pursuing firing in response up to the last moment. He succeeded in downing his adversary which caught fire and exploded in front of the French trenches.\" Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur citation, 4 December 1915"
