        "text": "Is CDG Airport the Main Airport in Paris?\n\nParis Charles de Gaulle Airport or Roissy Airport, as it is often called after its location (Roissy), is the main airport in Paris. Thus, it also goes simply by the name of Paris Airport, pointing out loud and clear that it is the major airfield serving the Paris area. Charles de Gaulle Airport opened its doors in 1974, receiving its name as a tribute to the famous French statesman, and replacing the old airport, known as Paris North Airport (AÃ©roport de Paris Nord). Today, it lies approximately 25km/15.5 miles north of Paris city center.\n\nVerily, CDG Airport is the busiest airport in France, but it also occupies the third position among European airports and the ninth among the airports globally. After a massive fall in passenger numbers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it seems to be back on track. As a matter of fact, in 2022, it welcomed almost 57.5 million passengers, becoming the number one European airport in terms of passenger flow. Moreover, it is also an important cargo aviation hub.\n\nBesides CDG Airport, two other airports are also located in proximity to Paris. Orly Airport is to be found 17km/10.5 miles from Paris, on its south side and serves mostly low-cost and domestic flights, whereas Paris Beauvais Airport is situated 100km/62 miles away from Paris downtown, handling budget airlines and private jets."
