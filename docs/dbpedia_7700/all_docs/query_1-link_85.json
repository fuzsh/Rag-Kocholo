        "text": "LE BOURGET, France — Airbus and Boeing won pledges for big purchases of their lucrative long-haul wide-body jets at the Paris Air Show on Monday, raising hopes that demand is recovering following the worldwide recession.\n\nThe global aviation event at Le Bourget airfield north of Paris is once again playing host to the rivalry between U.S.-based Boeing and France-based Airbus.\n\nAhead of the aerospace industry showcase, Airbus heavily promoted the A350 — its first all-new plane in eight years. The A350 seats up to 440 and is Airbus’ best chance to catch up with Boeing’s 787 and 777, which carry up to 300 and 365 passengers, respectively, in the race to sell planes used on long-haul flights.\n\nAirbus hoped that the A350’s short test flight last week would bring in potential customers at the show.\n\nBoeing’s Dreamliner, by contrast, made a few passes above the airfield at Le Bourget, its silence providing a stark contrast to Monday’s other showstopper: the Russian fighter Su-35, which flew for the first time outside its home country.\n\nAs the order race got under way, Boeing said GECAS, the aircraft leasing arm of General Electric, has made a promise to buy 10 of its 787 jets. GECAS is ordering the new version of the 787, the 787-10X.\n\nQatar Airways also put in orders for Boeing’s other long-haul aircraft, the Boeing 777.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbus announced a potential order Monday for its superjumbo 800-passenger A380 jets."
