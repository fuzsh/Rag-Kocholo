        "text": "see also: Organization of the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force\n\nWhen the United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917, the Air Service of the United States Army existed only as a branch of the Signal Corps, and was known by the name of Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps. It consisted of 1,120 personnel, of which 65 were officers. The Army was not ready for the deployment of aviation forces to Europe, and it became necessary to prepare after President Woodrow Wilson's declaration of war.[1]\n\nOverview\n\n[edit]\n\nAs part of the buildup of US forces, aviation units were formed into aero squadrons primarily at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas, with additional units being formed at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California.[1] Once formed, and prior to their deployment to Europe, Camp Taliaferro, north of Fort Worth, Texas, and several airfields near Toronto, Ontario, Canada were used by the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to perform flight training for the new aero squadrons. Camp Hancock, near Augusta, Georgia, was used for training service squadrons of aircraft mechanics as well as flight training.[2]\n\nWhen ordered to deploy, units departed though Garden City, New York, which was the primary port of embarkment. Units there were loaded onto transport ships for the trans-Atlantic crossing. Upon arrival in Europe, Liverpool, England, and Brest, France, were the primary ports of disembarkation, although other ports were also used. Some aero squadrons arriving in England received additional training from the Royal Flying Corps, and later the Royal Air Force (RAF) once it was established, and were then attached to British squadrons, deploying with them to France. Others received further training and were sent to Winchester, Hampshire, where they awaited their cross-channel transfer to France, using the port of Southampton.[1]\n\nAfter deployment to France, Air Service Replacement Concentration Barracks in St. Maixent was the primary reception center for new aero squadrons assigned to the American Expeditionary Force (AEF). There, units were classified as pursuit, bombardment or as observation units. Once processed, units were sent to one of several Air Instructional Centers (AIC) where they received additional training, then/or to the First Corps Observation Group School on Amanty Aerodrome or to the First Pursuit Organization and Training Center on Villeneuve-les-Vertus Aerodrome.[1]\n\nAfter assignment, the Air Service's deployed units operated from grass aerodromes, at first using airfields already built by the French \"Aéronautique Militaire\", then from new aerodromes purposely built for the American forces. The exact location of many of these aerodromes is no longer certain as many archives have since disappeared, and as the facilities were only temporary, most of the traces have long vanished through ploughing.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the Armistice came into effect in November 1918, the wartime Air Service was demobilized. This process was completed within a year and the National Defense Act of 1920 then established the United States Army Air Service on a permanent basis, with several new units being formed. Later, some of the temporary wartime units were consolidated to retain the lineage and honors of their wartime service with the AEF.[citation needed]\n\nStations\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow is a list of the barracks and aerodromes used by the American Expeditionary Force that were sent to France during World War I.[3] Most of the headquarters and command services used barracks or requisitioned properties not linked with flying grounds, yet some where installed on airfields as in Souilly, Saizerais or in Toul, where the \"Gengoult\" barracks had been built by the French \"Aeronautique Militaire\" on the northern edge of the Croix de Metz airfields (misspelt for \"Gengault\").[citation needed]\n\nAmerican sector\n\n[edit]\n\nCommand and control\n\n[edit]\n\nHeadquarters, Air Service, AEF, Chaumont, Champagne-Ardenne[1]\n\nFirst Army Air Service[1]\n\nOrganized at: La Ferté-sous-Jouarre, Île-de-France, 10 August 1918\n\nMoved to: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 25 August 1918\n\nMoved to: Souilly, Lorraine, 21 September – 11 November 1918\n\nSecond Army Air Service[1]\n\nOrganized at: Toul, Lorraine, 12 October – 11 November 1918\n\nThird Army Air Service\n\nOrganized at: Ligny-en-Barrois, Lorraine, 14 November 1918\n\nMoved to: Longuyon, Lorraine, 22 November 1918\n\nMoved to Germany.\n\nCombat aerodromes\n\n[edit]\n\nSupport aerodromes and depots\n\n[edit]\n\nTraining schools\n\n[edit]\n\nAviation Instruction Centers\n\n* The 5th Aviation Instruction Center at Bron (now Lyon–Bron Airport) was located at the French Air Service Mechanics School. The first Americans were sent to the school in mid-September, 1917. The school was overcrowded and was lacking in proper quarters and mess facilities for the Americans. Also, a lack of English-speaking instructors led to the decision to withdraw the Americans from the school. Students were sent to the 3d AIC at Issodun, with the last departing on 4 December 1917.[9]\n\n** The I Corps Aeronautical School was a temporary school, located at the French Air Service machine-gun training school at Gondrecourt-le-Château. About 225 men were sent to the school during March and April, 1918.[9]\n\nBritish sector\n\n[edit]\n\n[2] [10] [11]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
