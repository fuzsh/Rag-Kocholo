        "text": "48°40'38\"N 002°21'57\"E\n\nPort-Aviation's history began in 1908, when powered flight, one of the largest dreams of mankind, had become a reality. The airfield was designed and built to overcome the various disadvantages imposed on the plain of Issy les Moulineaux and at the field of Vincennes which had been used to fly until then. These lands were in fact military manoeuvre areas that needed to be rent or borrowed at certain conditions and at certain times. This posed countless problems for the pioneers of aviation for the realization of a flight.\n\nThe airstrip itself included a signals mast, which could be considered an ancestor of the control tower, placed centrally on a circular grass airfield 3 kilometer in diameter. It was protected from the wind by the slopes of the banks of the Seine near of Viry Chatillon, Savigny and Juvisy.This protection against the wind was absolutely necessary to enable aircraft of the time to rise to 2 or 3 meters from the ground. Clearly this set up was designed to allow the organization of spectacular aeronautical meetings for many years. At the time, the technical progress of flight was not envisioned as something that would happen fast.\n\nOn 23 May 1909, the inauguration of what was now called \"Port Aviation\" took place. Around 6PM Mr. Delagrange flew in front of an excited crowd who had spent 4 hours in waiting, and he is raised in triumph after his flight is accomplished. On July 4, 1909, an air festival is organized for the benefit of charities. It brings together 10,000 people. Blériot took the opportunity to test his fuel endurance, flying the aircraft with which he planned to cross the English channel a few days later.\n\nIn October more than 100,000 Parisian spectators gather at the airfield on one single day. These \"fan's\" of the still fledgling aviation mainly arrive by rail, as Port Aviation was then served by the station of Juvisy sur Orge, located less than one kilometre from the main entrance.\n\nonly a few cows are grazing. The facilities built by Guillaume Tronchet are without use.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of the Great War gives them a second life.\n\n-as a first step, a detachment of 40 soldiers is stationed here to guard the railway tracks to Juvisy station.\n\n-in a second step and as early as the spring of 1915, a detachment of the British Flying Corps is based herewith a dozen machines.\n\nIn less than 3 months, they installed all the necessary infrastructure: hangars, buildings, internal roads, technical facilities, water supply, electricity, phone, etc. This new airfield development at Orly meant that Port Aviation became obsolete, regardless of its role in the history of aviation."
