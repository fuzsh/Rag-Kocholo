        "text": "Civil Aviation Tax (CAT), Solidarity Tax (TS), Noise Tax (TNSA) - Calculation\n\nIn France, different types of taxes are applied to business aviation flights.\n\nLearn more\n\n1. Civil Aviation Tax (CAT) - \"Tarif de l'aviation civile\" (TAC)\n\nThe Civil Aviation Tax is calculated based on the number of passengers and their final destination.\n\nThe tax amounts to €5,05 for each passenger departing to\n\nMetropolitan France\n\nFrench overseas departments (DOC): Guadeloupe, Guyana, Martinique, Mayotte, La Réunion\n\nOverseas communities (COM): Saint-Barthélemy and Saint-Martin\n\nOther member states of the European Union\n\nAny state located less than 1,000km from France (Andorra, Monaco, United Kingdom, San Marino, Switzerland)\n\nThe tax amounts to €9,09 for each passenger to all other states.\n\nLearn more\n\n2. Solidarity Tax (TS) - \"Tarif de solidarité\"\n\nThe Solidarity Tax is calculated based on the number of passengers and their final destination.\n\nOur interpretation is, that for business aviation - usually not having distinct classes - the \"Other classes\" categorization applies.\n\nIf you want to calculate with the \"First\" or \"Business\" class or equivalent name, pls check the checkbox \"Distinct Classes\" in the Aircraft record. The higher tarif will then be applied to all passengers.\n\nLearn more\n\n3. Airport Security Tax (TA) - \"Tarif de sûreté et de sécurité et tarif de péréquation aéroportuaire\"\n\nThe Airport Security Tax (TA) is one of the passenger taxes designed to contribute to airport security measures and ensure the safety of passengers. The primary goal of the Airport Security Tax is to fund security-related activities at airports. It is imposed on passengers who embark on flights departing from specific groups of airports in France.\n\nTax Rates:\n\nSecurity aerodrome rate\n\nClass 1 Airport: Passengers departing from Class 1 airports, such as Paris airports, are charged €11.80 per passenger, with a connecting passenger rate of €4.3.\n\nClass 2 Airports: Passengers departing from Class 2 airports, like Lyon-Saint-Exupéry and Nice-Côte d'Azur, have varying rates ranging from €3.5 to €9.5 per passenger, with connecting passenger rates.\n\nClass 3 Airports: Passengers departing from Class 3 airports, such as Agen-La Garenne and Ajaccio-Napoleon Bonaparte, are charged €17.20 per passenger, with connecting passenger rates ranging from €0.73 to €4.82.\n\nAirport Equalization Rate: Additionally, an airport equalization rate is added to the tax for each airport, which amounts to €1 per passenger or 119 CFP Franc (CFP).\n\nThe amount of the tax specific to each of these aerodromes and groups of aerodromes can be found here\n\nThe reduction rate applicable to the safety and security rate for connecting passengers: 72%\n\nFinal Calculation\n\nThe final Airport Security Tax is calculated based on the number of passengers, transit passengers, and the security aerodrome rate. The formula is as follows:\n\nAirport Security Tax (TA) = [(Number of passengers - Number of transit passengers) x (Security aerodrome rate)] + [(Number of transit passengers) x (Security aerodrome rate * 0.35)] + [(Number of passengers) x (Airport equalization rate)]\n\nLearn more\n\n4. Noise Tax (TNSA) - \"Taxe sur les nuisances sonores aériennes\"\n\nThe noise tax is applied on all flights taking off from French airports (both passenger and positioning flights). It is based on\n\nthe aircraft MTOW in tonnes\n\nthe modulation coefficient based on\n\nactual time of departure (LT)\n\nacoustic group of the aircraft\n\nthe aerodrome rate\n\nActual Time of Departure\n\nThis is the local time of take-off (actual, not scheduled) in the periods:\n\nDaytime: From 06:00 to 17:59\n\nEvening time: From 18:00 to 21:59\n\nNight time: From 22:00 to 05:59\n\nAcoustic Group of the Aircraft\n\nTo determine the acoustic group of your aircraft, see here. Most modern aircraft should be in category 5.\n\nModulation Coefficient\n\nThe aircraft MTOW in tonnes is modulated by applying a coefficient that takes into account the actual time of departure and the acoustic group of the aircraft according to the following table:\n\nAerodrome Rate\n\nThe aerodrome rate is determined by the following table:\n\nComputation\n\nThe tax is calculated with the following formula:\n\nTax due = Decimal logarithm (log) of the MTOW in tonnes (rounded to the nearest tonne) x modulation coefficient x aerodrome rate.\n\nExample:\n\nGlobal 7500 with MTOW = 52,096kg\n\nTaking off from Paris Le-Bourget at 06:30 = Daytime\n\nAircraft acoustic group = 5\n\n=> Modulation coefficient = 0.25\n\n=> Aerodrome rate = €71.90\n\n=> Tax due = log(52) x 0.25 x €71.90 = 1.71 x 0.25 x €71.90 = €30.74\n\nAircraft with an MTOW < 2000kg and aircraft operated for civil protection missions, fire fighting, state aircraft, military, customs, or police service are exempt.\n\nLearn more"
