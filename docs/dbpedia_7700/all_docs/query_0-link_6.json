        "text": "SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nFrom AIP FRANCE 11 AUG 2022\n\nRWY 11, 22 and 29 TODA reduced due obstacles in the TKOF funnel.\n\nFavour the use of RWY 04/22 due to the presence of obstacles in te clearances of RWY 11/29.\n\nPreferred QFU 037°, due environmental reasons.\n\nLanding prohibited on RWY 11.\n\nIt was not possible to enter all the runway limitations when entering the runway data so check AIP FRANCE.\n\nCharles de Gaulle Airport\n\nParis Charles de Gaulle Airport is the principal airport serving the French capital, Paris, and the largest international airport in France.
