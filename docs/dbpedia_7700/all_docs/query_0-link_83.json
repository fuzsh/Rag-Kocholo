        "text": "Urban mobility is all set and ready for take-off in Paris Region!\n\nThe international call for interest launched by RATP Group, Groupe ADP and Choose Paris Region last October to scout companies set to the Urban Air Mobility industry branch in Paris Region was a real success. The call generated 150 applications from 25 different countries.\n\nWinning companies will begin testing their solutions at the Pontoise Airfield as of June 2021 making transport in Paris Region both cleaner and more sustainable. Find out the names of the 30 selected companies who will build the future of Urban Air Mobility in the region.\n\nTo meet the challenges posed by this new form of mobility in terms of use cases, public acceptance, technologies and industrialization, the call for expressions of interest was structured around the following five categories:\n\nVehicle development: for manufacturers and equipment suppliers (batteries, avionics, etc.);\n\nUrban infrastructure: for energy companies or vertiport designers;\n\nOperations: for suppliers of intermodal solutions, maintenance, or digital platforms;\n\nAirspace integration: for suppliers of unmanned traffic management (UTM) or communication/ navigation systems;\n\nAcceptability: for laboratories or research institutes dealing with social and environmental issues.\n\nOne of the key selection criteria defined beforehand was the maturity of the solution.\n\nWorking groups and start of experiments at summer 2021\n\nThus, from June 2021, in close cooperation with the French civil aviation authority (DGA) and with the support of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and Eurocontrol, tests will be carried out in a real aeronautical environment at Pontoise, with respect to parking, takeoff and landing operations, as well as operations around the vehicle, whether for maintenance or electrical recharging.\n\nThe selected candidates join Volocopter, manufacturer of the electric vertical take-off vehicle (eVTOL), which will be the first industrial player to test its VoloCity vehicle from June 2021.\n\nThe players will now be able to share their expertise, identify synergies and deploy experimentations in the coming months at the Pontoise-Cormeilles-en-Vexin airfield.\n\nThe success of this call for expressions of interest has brought together leading industrial players in the field of air mobility, such as Airbus, as well as international start-ups and major academic and research institutions, including the University of Berkeley and the French Civil Aviation School.\n\nIn addition, the prospect of the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games is an exceptional opportunity to mobilize a sector to prepare a demonstrator for this horizon, and to make the Paris Region a reference in the global market for urban air mobility.\n\nOn this occasion, Edward Arkwright, Deputy CEO of Groupe ADP said: \"the success of this call for international interest shows that there is strong support for the structuring of an air mobility industry in the Paris Region. Alongside all these industrial, academic and research players, and thanks to the setup of a test area at our Pontoise airfield, the first of its kind in Europe, we will now be able to boost its development. The test area integration within the airfield has been the result of collaborative work with French civil aviation authority teams. Today, Groupe ADP wants to explore and make possible all the futures of aviation, both carbon-free and innovative\".\n\nCatherine Guillouard, Chairwoman and CEO of RATP Group stated that \"after the inauguration of a test area on September 30th, the urban air mobility sector has just entered into a new phase with this call for expressions of interest, which has proved to be a real success. As a partner to cities, RATP Group is pleased to contribute to the development of this new form of mobility, which complements our historical modes of transport, and to this integration of technology in the urban landscape in view of the 2024 Olympic Games\".\n\nAnd Franck Margain, President of Choose Paris Region to add: \"the success of the call for expressions of interest conducted alongside ADP Group and RATP Group demonstrates the international attractiveness of the Paris region as well as the importance of our region for the development of tomorrow's mobility. Through the collaboration of public and private players, and by inviting innovative companies from around the world to join us and complete our value chain, we are building a unique ecosystem to develop the urban air mobility sector, reinforce the attractiveness of the Paris region and to support responsible industries and employment.\"\n\nThe winners chosen by the jury for the five categories are:\n\nFor Vehicle development:\n\nAirbus (France): aircraft manufacturer;\n\nAscendance Flight Technologies (France): Hybrid-electric VTOL aircraft manufacturer;\n\nEhang (China): passenger electric VTOL manufacturer;\n\nH3 Dynamics (Singapore): manufacturer and ultralight hydrogen electric systems developer;\n\nPipistrel (Slovenia): electric aircraft and logistics VTOL manufacturer;\n\nSafran Electronics & Defense (France): manufacturer of the Patroller VTOL and optronics, avionics, electronics systems and critical software provider for civil and military applications;\n\nVolocopter (Germany): manufacturer of the VoloCity electric VTOL;\n\nVertical Aerospace (United Kingdom): manufacturer of the VA-1X eVTOL;\n\nZipline (USA): logistics drone operator and manufacturer.\n\nFor Operations:\n\nAir France (France): expected contribution in several areas, especially in aircraft maintenance and repair;\n\nCAE (Canada): aviation training and simulation solutions provider;\n\nDassault Falcon Services (France): subsidiary of Dassault Aviation specialized in maintenance operations and other services for business aviation;\n\nESTACA (France): engineering school specialized in mobility and aeronautical techniques, including aircraft maintenance;\n\nHelifirst (France): airline specialized in business aviation with helicopters;\n\nHelipass (France): on-demand helicopter flight reservation platform.\n\nFor Urban Infrastructure:\n\nGreen Motion (Switzerland): charging systems designer and provider for electric vehicles;\n\nIDEMIA I&S (France): specialist in digital security, biometrics and identification-authentication solutions;\n\nLeosphere (France): Lidar equipment provider allowing remote sensing and precise weather forecasts;\n\nSkyports (United Kingdom): vertiport designer & operator and logistics VTOL operator.\n\nFor Airspace integration:\n\nCergy University and ESSEC (France): university and school consortium, gathering 25 000 students, including the first junior company in Europe;\n\nENAC (France): engineering school specialized in civil aviation;\n\nInternest (France): positioning systems allowing autonomous landing in complex environments;\n\nM3 Systems (Belgium): high performance on-board geo-tracking applications developer;\n\nThales SIX (France): on-board anti-collision systems developer.\n\nFor Public Acceptance:"
