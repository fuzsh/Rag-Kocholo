        "text": "The Heliport Paris aerodrome is located in the 15th arrondissement of the capital, south of the Sèvres gate and the ring road, at the edge of Issy-les-Moulineaux.\n\nUntil the beginning of the 20th century, it was first of all a vast field of maneuvers belonging to the town of Issy-les-Moulineaux intended for the soldiers who had had to abandon the Champ-de-Mars where was built the Eiffel Tower in 1889.\n\nSince 1905, the site is popular with aviation pioneers. Louis Blériot, Henri Farman or Alberto Santos-Dumont make their first flights that sometimes only last a few minutes. After the first war, aeronautical exhibitions are organized there, and tests of helicopters are carried out, while on the administrative level, the perimeter is attached to the city of Paris.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second World War, the area of ​​the aerodrome was gradually reduced by new construction and especially the development of the ring road. In 1956, the site officially became a heliport and its management was entrusted to the company Aéroports de Paris.\n\nFrom now on, the land area of ​​the heliport is only 7.5 hectares. It includes a 350 m by 50 m track, a parking area, a control tower and hangars. Traffic is primarily dedicated to civil security and military flights, but private companies also provide connections for business flights or tourist flights.\n\nAt a time threatened, the existence of the heliport was finally preserved, for questions of health logistics, but also because of its major historical role during the beginnings of aviation...\n\nInformation on +33 1 70 36 39 50."
