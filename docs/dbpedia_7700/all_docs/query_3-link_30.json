Chavenay sets an example for its good practices, particularly its respect for local residents.\n\nLearn more about Chavenay's airfield.\n\nLA FERTE ALAIS\n\nLocated in the Essonne department, La Ferté Alais is an airfield with Avgas 100 LL and Jet A1. Approved in 1947, this airfield is well known for having hosted numerous film shoots. It is home to the remarkable Salis Flying Museum, with 50 vintage aircraft retracing the history of aviation from the pioneers (1908) to the 1960s.\n\nEmblematic models include the Blériot XI, the Spad XIII and the Boeing B-17. In addition, five Morane-Saulnier aircraft listed as historic monuments are also on display. The airfield is internationally renowned as a sanctuary for vintage aviation. Every year on the Whitsun weekend, the airfield hosts a famous airshow: \"Le temps des hélices\".\n\nLearn more about La Ferté Alais' airfield.\n\nSAINT CYR L'ECOLE\n\nThe Saint-Cyr airfield in the Yvelines, just 4 km from Versailles, offers self-service Avgas 100LL. It's the ideal place to come to Paris by light aircraft, thanks in particular to its excellent rail links, which provide access to central Paris in less than 30 minutes.CParis Air Services, a partner of TotalEnergies Aviation, also provides a range of services for visiting aircraft, including refuelling and handling.\n\nThe airfield is home to more than 1,250 pilots in a dozen flying clubs, including the Amicale de Voltige Aérienne, also a TotalEnergies Aviation partner, and Paris Flight Academy, a professional flying school.\n\nLast but not least, the St Cyr l'école site offers pilots and their passengers a magnificent flight over the Château de Versailles.\n\nLearn more about Saint Cyr l'école's airfield."
