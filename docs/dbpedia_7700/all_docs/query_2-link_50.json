        "text": "Toussus-le-Noble, France, January 28, 2019 – Daher today announced the opening of a new TBM customer support base serving the Île-de-France geographic region surrounding Paris, and which is strategically situated in a technology cluster zone that has earned the designation as “Europe’s Silicon Valley”.\n\nLocated at the popular Toussus-le-Noble aerodrome in the southwest of Paris, this operation includes a workshop and offices in Hangar 111/112, positioned near the airport’s main entrance.\n\nAs a subsidiary of the primary TBM Service Center at Daher’s Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrenees Airport facility, this latest customer support base is Part 145 approved by the European EASA and U.S. FAA airworthiness authorities – enabling work to be performed on TBM aircraft registered both in Europe and the United States.\n\nIt will provide maintenance service, including scheduled inspections for TBM aircraft covered by Daher’s maintenance contracts. The station ensures handling and customer care during opening hours of the airport, weekends and holidays included, with a two-hour prior notice.\n\n“With more than a dozen civilian TBMs based in the Paris region – plus the French Ministry of Defense’s TBM fleet at the nearby Villacoublay Air Base – it was essential to offer our customers local maintenance services,” commented Nicolas Chabbert, Senior Vice President of the Daher Airplane Business Unit. “Additionally, Toussus-le-Noble’s close proximity to corporate research sites, company administrative centers, and technology businesses makes it ideal in serving the needs of TBM owners and operators.”\n\nNicolas Chabbert also noted the Toussus-le-Noble customer support base benefits from the direct support of Daher’s TBM experts in engines, airframes, avionics and systems at its Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrenees Airport facility.\n\nHugo Delpi, manager of the TBM Service Center at Tarbes-Lourdes-Pyrenees Airport, also will also be responsible for the new Toussus-le-Noble operation. The team at Toussus-le-Noble can be reached by telephone at: +33 (0) 1 39 20 92 41, and via Daher’s TBM CARE contacts."
