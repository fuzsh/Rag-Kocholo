        "text": "The area around Toulouse-Blagnac Airport has final assembly lines for the full range of Airbus commercial jetliners (A320, A330, A350 and A380 Families) as well as facilities for passenger cabin outfitting and painting of completed aircraft.\n\nTheAirbus Training Centre in Toulouse features full-flight simulators for all the company’s jetliner types, providing training for customer airlines’ flight crews, maintenance staff and cabin attendants, as well as performance and operational staff.\n\nToulouse-Blagnac also houses operations dedicated to Airbus commercial aircraft engineering, structural design and testing, systems organisation, flight and ground testing, system integration testing, propulsion and more.\n\nAlso situated in the industrial zones around Toulouse-Blagnac Airport is the Henri Ziegler Delivery Centre, where customers receive their aircraft for fly-away; Airbus’ Saint-Eloi factory, which manufactures pylons that integrate jet engines on the wings of all Airbus aircraft families; the home for Airbus’ Beluga transport aircraft fleet; and Lycée Airbus, a professional company school that trains more than 300 young people each year for work in the aeronautical industry.\n\nSaint-Nazaire, on the Atlantic coast of France, encompasses two production sites situated on 75 hectares. Its 3,060-strong workforce specialises in assembling, equipping and testing the forward sections of A320 Family aircraft, as well as the forward and centre sections of the A330 and flagship A380 jetliners. Sub-assemblies come from French, European and worldwide partners, making the Saint-Nazaire site a true international logistical platform. After being assembled, the fuselage elements are equipped with major systems before being tested and transported by Airbus’ Beluga cargo aircraft – or by sea in the case of the larger A380 components – to various company final assembly line locations in Europe.\n\nAirbus’ Defence and Space division develops innovative and efficient solutions to meet the needs of our customers in the Defence, Space and Security sectors. Space exploration, weather and climate studies, deforestation monitoring and secure communications anytime anywhere are some examples of Airbus’ activities which demonstrate our commitment to be a force for good. We are protecting the world with high-end technologies integrated in our satellites, multi-intelligence systems, combat aircraft or multi-role aircraft (transport, refuelling, search and rescue, surveillance and reconnaissance), and their autonomous versions: drones.\n\nIn France, with 23 different sites, close to our customers, Airbus Defence and Space has a workforce of 6,000 employees. With subcontractors, about 9,000 people work hand in hand, fully-focused on supporting our customers, while living Airbus’ values every day: customer focus, integrity, respect, creativity, reliability and teamwork. Committed to contributing to a more connected and safer world, we are working every day with passion to deliver sustainable solutions. Within a flexible environment, our teams rely on our shared expertise and experience to contribute to the future of Defence, Space and Security in France, and to foster an autonomous sovereign Europe.\n\nThe two main sites of Airbus Defence and Space are located in Elancourt, a southwest suburb of Paris, and in Toulouse.\n\nIn Elancourt, our focus is on:\n\nSecured radio communication (PMR) for Police, Gendarmerie and Rescue services\n\nSecure satellite communications for defence forces,\n\nIntelligence systems (image intelligence, electromagnetic intelligence, open source) and massive intelligence\n\nMaritime Traffic Surveillance Systems\n\nDrone systems\n\nSpace equipment production\n\nCyber security together with Airbus’ specialist subsidiaries, Airbus Protect and Stormshield.\n\nFuture defence solutions like the Multi-Domain Combat Cloud and the Future Combat Air System (FCAS) are also developed in Elancourt as part of an international collaboration.\n\nRecognised as a trusted partner in France, Airbus is the French Defence Ministry’s largest industrial supplier. In Toulouse, the flight testing for the A400M military transport and other military aircraft is undertaken in cooperation with Airbus’ flight test facilities in Spain.\n\nIn the southeast of Toulouse, this is where the heart of Airbus’ French space activities are developed. Airbus is currently the only company simultaneously involved in access-to-space (via its share in Ariane Group), in satellites and orbital system manufacturing, in secure telecommunication services (teleport) as well as in providing a large range of value-added imagery and services.\n\nWithin its Toulouse-based sites, the complete stages of design, development, integration, assembly and test of satellite systems are performed. These satellite systems offer capabilities for Earth Observation, Meteorology, Space Sciences and Telecommunication.\n\nContinuing Airbus’ history of developing Earth-imaging satellites in Toulouse, the city is also home to geo-information with the distribution of both raw data and sophisticated geo-information services to sectors including security and defence, agriculture and energy extraction. More than 20 million km2 of Earth observation imagery are produced every day, serving more than 2,000 customers in 167 countries.\n\nAt the leading edge of innovation, Airbus is the first company to introduce electric propulsion for large satellites and to offer operational laser communication between satellites. Airbus, in partnership with OneWeb, has initiated low orbit communication satellite constellations to deliver high-speed internet around the world. With OneSat, Airbus is pioneering the development of flexible geostationary satellites. This new type of satellite will be a game changer for the industry by allowing our customers to deliver capacity where and when it is needed most.\n\nWe have designed and manufactured a self-funded system of very high resolution Earth observation satellites, named Pléiades Neo, which deliver the best quality imagery on the market via an innovative cloud solution, OneAtlas: a new way to access and exploit imagery and geoinformation.\n\nServing the largest space agencies, Airbus is helping address the major concerns of humankind today in the scientific domains of:\n\nInterplanetary exploration\n\nAstronomy\n\nPlanetology\n\nFundamental physics\n\nCombining more than 200 years of in-orbit experience with more than 20 ongoing missions, Airbus is designing and building, for example, the Earth Return Orbiter which will return the first ever rock samples from Mars, the next generation weather satellites MetOp Second Generation, the second pair of Copernicus Sentinel-2 climate monitoring satellites, and JUICE, the first European mission to analyse the icy moons of Jupiter.\n\nFrom the beginning of Europe’s Ariane programme, the site of Les Mureaux near Paris has produced the centre core stages for this highly successful commercial launch vehicle, with activities moved from the heavy-lift Ariane 5 to the next generation Ariane 6. A new integration facility assembles core stages for the new generation Ariane 6, using lean production methods and a horizontal workflow that succeeds the current vertical build process. The production prime contractor for Ariane launchers is ArianeGroup – a joint venture of Airbus and Safran.\n\nFind here more information in French, for the Airbus Space activity in France"
