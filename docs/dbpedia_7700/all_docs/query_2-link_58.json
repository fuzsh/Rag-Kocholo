        "text": "TIM ROBINSON FRAeS, STEPHEN BRIDGEWATER and CHARLOTTE BAILEY report on some of the most exciting news and highlights of the fourth and final trade day at the Paris Air Show 2023 and provide a summary.\n\nPouring rain did little to dampen spirits of visitors at the show on the fourth day – and gave an opportunity to check out the halls indoors. Let's take a look at the highlights.\n\nSpecial NOTAM podcast edition - Paris 2023 analysis\n\nListen to our thoughts and analysis on the podcast below.\n\nCould hydrogen-powered BYA-I be the answer to bizjet stigma?\n\nCan Beyond Aero turn bizaviation green? (Beyond Aero)\n\nAmong the start-up companies exhibiting at Paris for the first time in 2023 is Toulouse-based Beyond Aero. The company unveiled plans for its hydrogen-electric BYA-I aircraft that it says will carry four passengers on trips of just over 900 miles at speeds of 310kts while emitting nothing but water vapour.\n\nFormed three years ago, Beyond Aero has already built and tested an 85-kW subscale technology demonstrator of its hydrogen fuel cell-based powertrain and is now working on a 1MW class propulsion system that will include a pair of electric-powered ducted fans on the rear of the fuselage. Initially, the BYA-I will run on gaseous hydrogen loaded in tanks installed below the cabin but the company already plans to switch to liquid hydrogen at a later date.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to AEROSPACE on the Thursday of Paris Air Show , company founder and CEO Eloa Guillotin explained that “the future of aviation will be electric. I have studied the market and I have no doubt about this. However, I think it's going to start with small business jets because EASA’s CS-23 are really the only accessible certification process where you can try to innovate without too much problem.”\n\nThe attractive design of the BYA-I features a patented half-moon-shaped air inlet in the rear of the fuselage that will cool the powertrain. The fuel tanks are housed in a fairing under the fuselage to avoid compromising space in the cabin, which can seat up to eight passengers.\n\n“We are trying to buy everything from traditional aerospace suppliers – we are the integrator,” continued Guillotin, who also confirmed that the company had so far raised around $10m in investment and has letters of intent covering 72 of the new aircraft, valued at $580m. She declined to identify the customers, but did suggest that some ‘might’ include existing business aircraft operators looking to decarbonise their fleets.\n\nGE says open- rotor RISE will cut fuel burn by 20%\n\nProps are back. (Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)\n\nGE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines’ CFM Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) programme has been advancing rapidly over the last few years and the companies announced at Paris that the prototype engines have now performed some 400 ground tests and are achieving at least 20% lower fuel consumption and CO2 emissions compared with the most efficient engines available today.\n\nThe open-rotor RISE engine will ultimately fly aboard an Airbus technology demonstrator and while cabin noise (and noise on the ground) has been a concern with some previous propfan designs, the CFM team told AEROSPACE that as well as meeting all noise emission requirements research conducted by Airbus proves RISE is actually quieter than contemporary jet engines.\n\nRAeS President Kerissa Khan visits show\n\nONERA shows off ultra-green airliner concept\n\nGULLYVER on the ONERA stand. (Tim Robinson/RAeS)\n\nOver at the ONERA stand, the French national aerospace centre was showcasing some of its latest research projects, including the Espadon (Swordfish) Mach 5-10 hypersonic concept, wind-tunnel testing of tailless fighter and GULLYVER – a hydrogen-powered, high-aspect braced -wing future airliner, equipped with open-rotor engines. With H2 tanks in the rear of the aircraft, interestingly the short/medium range 200-seat airliner uses a ovoid twin-aisle fuselage in 2-4-2 cabin configuration to avoid becoming too long. While carbon use is cut to zero by using hydrogen, ONERA say that GULLYVER would also cut energy consumption by 15% on top of that.\n\nM346 gets 20mm gun pod\n\nThe M346 has extra 20mm punch. (Leonardo)\n\nOn the fourth day of the 2023 Paris Air Show, Leonardo and Nexter jointly launched a development programme aimed to introduce a new 20mm gun pod on the M346 Fighter Attack (FA).\n\nAfter a successful feasibility study, which has demonstrated the capability of adding a Link & Case Recovery (LCR) system to the M-346 FA, the companies have decided to pursue a joint development effort by integrating a new cannon pod to the aircraft.\n\nA 20mm cannon offers advantages compared to the existing 12.7mm/.50 calibre in terms of range, precision and final effects. The 20M621 weapon solution, easy to integrate, operate and maintain, is a NATO calibre ITAR free solution designed for an air application.\n\nAqualines shows off wing-in-ground effect vehicle\n\nWhile a focus of the show has been on ‘green technology,’ the A/14 craft claims to offer the ‘blue mobility revolution’ (Charlotte Bailey/RAeS)\n\nPromising to usher in ”a new generation of ultra-fast low carbon marine transportation,” the Aqualines ‘flying boat’ could be just the form of transportation visitors to today’s show require, given the torrential rain unleashed this morning upon Le Bourget.\n\nThe current iteration of the French startup has been in existence for around a year and hopes to bring its latest 14-seat A/14 concept to market as soon as 2027-28. Although its ‘wings’ and twin-boom tail are reminiscent of an aircraft, the ekranoplan craft will remain in ground effect as it speeds just above the surface of the water; achieving up to 300km/hr. Its aerodynamically-efficient fuselage has undergone wind tunnel testing in the UK’s Enstone facility (supported by engineers from Alpine F1) and the quest for maritime certification is ongoing.\n\nThe scalable concept could one day transport up to 250 passengers and while an undisputed theme of this year’s show is ‘going green’, Aqualines claim to be proponents of the “blue mobility revolution”.\n\nCould cost effective firefighting UAV be UK answer to increasing wildfires?\n\nAs we approach the end of a warm and humid week at the Paris Air Show many are casting their minds back to last year’s Farnborough, when temperatures peaked at record levels and parts of the UK were enduring almost unheard of wildfires.\n\nMuch was said at the time about the UK’s lack of aerial firefighting – see https://www.aerosociety.com/news/a-burning-issue-does-the-uk-need-aerial-firefighting-aircraft/ - but the excessive cost of acquiring a fleet for the limited occasions they would be needed would make such a purchase unlikely.\n\nHowever, Nelson Ngouenet of US start-up Avian Dynamics thinks his company may have just the solution in the shape of the Fyrbyrd UAV. “There isn't as much government funding that goes towards fighting wildfires in the US, neither is there much technological advancement” he told AEROSPACE. “So we looked at it as an opportunity to take technologies from different areas and innovate on them to be able to bring them into the sector.”\n\nHis FyrByrd UAV is currently in the prototyping phase but will be an amphibious fixed wing aircraft with a wingspan of 10-15m and a range in the region of 1,000 miles. It will be operated by ground based pilot operating from forward deployed locations close to lakes and rivers in the region of any fires.\n\n“Fire spotting companies are already working on AI algorithms to locate hot spots, and we ultimately aim to implement those in our product”, continued Ngouenet. The company is currently building a 1/5 scale prototype and that should be flying by the end of the summer and aims to have “a full scale aircraft flying within three to five years.”\n\nInitial prototypes will be powered by conventional engines but Ngouenet confirmed that hydrogen and hybrid propulsion powerplants were being explored for future incarnations once battery density allows. “It is important to bring renewable technology to an arena that has been dominated by traditional methods for many years and we are aiming to be the one of the first to do so. One of the things that few people realise is that on a yearly basis wildfires contribute as much co2 as many leading nations. In fact, in 2022, the amount of co2 that was emitted by wildfires globally was almost twice that of the entire emissions of Germany! So the problem almost has a snowball effect, with CO2 emissions from fires increasing global warming and making other fires more likely.”\n\nAvian Dynamics ultimately aims to operate FyByrd drones itself as well as sell them to private companies and local, regional and national firefighting organisations around the world. Questioned about the issue of operating FyrByrd in controlled airspace Ngouenet explained that “US firefighters are already using drones with beyond visual line of sight capabilities, so we believe there's a path forward for us to be able to do the same types of missions in airspace.”\n\nAlthough Ngouenet would not be drawn on pricing, he did indicate that it would be cost effective for nations to acquire for use on rare occasions. Could this be the answer the UK is looking for?\n\neVTOLs - the public perception challenge\n\nEveryone wants to take an air taxi - but how many would like a vertiport next door? (Charlotte Bailey)\n\nWith hopes to commercialise and scale Urban Air Mobility flying high at this year’s show, a panellist of industry professionals came together to discuss the social acceptance challenges affecting this emerging element of the aerospace industry.\n\nKaterina Wagner, Head of Business Development at AutoFlight, likened scepticism to the public’s fear of riding the first steam locomotive (at a giddying speed of 15ph); an innovation we take for granted today. In order to build trust, she believes people must be able to experience the aircraft at events such as this one; adding that although Autoflight’s Prosperity craft is conducting daily flight tests at the company’s Chinese facility, putting its purpose in the public eye is key.\n\nThe Managing Director of Deloitte believes public scepticism falls into three main areas: the potential for noise pollution, the location of the infrastructure, and whether it adds to or replaces existing congestion. He added that the “key element to positive public perception” was the “big value proposition” of saving time on journeys, noting that safety concerns are less of an issue as the mandatory certification process guarantees safety by the time the craft commence commercial operations.\n\nAndreas Perotti, EHang’s CEO Europe, echoed the point that safety concerns were less of a stumbling block towards public acceptance; noting the industry’s “zero tolerance” towards risk. Instead, he elaborated on EHang’s desire to “democratize air travel,” noting that the innovation in urban air mobility wasn’t in transporting people from A to B but rather the price point for the consumer. Drawing parallels between publicly funded railways, Perotti also suggested that public funding for “democratised use cases” was crucial in engaging with a market that “doesn’t exist yet”.\n\nA Lufthansa representative disagreed, believing public funding would likely alienate the majority of those unable to take immediate advantage of what he believes to (initially, at least) be a high premium sector product. AutoFlight’s Wagner also suggested an early-use scenario likely to build positive public perception are medical applications, where an urban air mobility vehicle could be used to transport light medical goods or doctors to remote areas.\n\nConcluding, however, that a collaborative approach across the sector was key to “opening doors and minds,” Wagner concluded that in the quest to elevate awareness, perhaps a celebrity flight would be a great way to start.\n\nElectric aviation getting it Wright\n\nWright Electric has tested its motor at 1mW. (Wright Electric)\n\nSpeaking on the fourth day of the show Jeff Engler – founder and CEO of Wright Electric – confirmed that his company had successfully tested its aerospace electric motor-generator at 1MW (1,300hp). “We’ve also signed a Space Act Agreement with NASA to conduct altitude testing of the unit in the NASA Electric Aircraft Testbed (NEAT) to a simulated height of 40,000ft,” he proudly told AEROSPACE.\n\nThe propulsion system can be used as a motor or generator, enabling it to be configured as a turbogenerator or APU for high altitude power in commercial or defence related applications. “Achieving 1MW, specifically 1MW of shaft power, is an important step in reaching Wright’s goal of making all single-aisle flights under 800 miles zero emissions. Commercial aircraft need megawatt-sized propulsion systems for a full passenger load take off and we are able to mount two of our systems in a single nacelle to harness double the power output.”\n\nAirbus and AURA AERO partner to decarbonise pilot training\n\nFrench military pilots are set to be trained on electric aircraft. (Airbus)\n\nAirbus Flight Academy Europe, which supplies training services for the French Armed Forces pilots and civilian cadets, has signed an MoU with AURA AERO to collaborate on the development of the latter’s Integral E fully-electric, two-seater trainer aircraft.\n\nThe joint approach aims to decarbonisation pilot training by introducing electric-powered aircraft for commercial and military pilot tuition. Integral E is ideal for early flight training and when operating from an airfield equipped with superchargers, the aircraft can be charged in 20 to 30 minutes, granting them an hour of flight endurance.\n\nESA to satellite operators: “take your garbage home”\n\nKeep outer space tidy. (Tim Robinson/RAeS)\n\nOver at the ESA/CNES space pavilion, an audience heard from a panel of experts including space industry chiefs, a reserve astronaut and ESA Director-General Josef Aschbacher on the threat of space debris. Likening space to national nature park, Aschbacher said that satellite operators “need to take their garbage home”.\n\nMeanwhile, Jean-Marc Nasr EVP Airbus Defence & Space, provided a glimpse into the threats to space operators in LEO, saying that below 2,000km orbit, “every 8mins there is a 'red alert'” about a potential collision. It “keeps me awake at night\" he admitted.\n\nTo address this, later in the year, ESA will launch its Zero Debris Charter – an initiative to encourage responsible companies to promise to deorbit their satellites at the end of life and cut down on space junk. Over 25 satellite companies have already signed up, and this includes non-European ones such as Planet. In a Q&A session later, Aschbacher said that regulation will still be needed and that levers already exist to penalise or reward anyone buying space data or services from irresponsible or responsible satellite companies respectively. Much like a ‘kite mark’ for quality of consumer appliances, could a ESA Zero Debris Charter badge help shift behaviour among global satellite operators and those who use their products, to prevent LEO becoming too polluted to use?\n\nLeonardo’s HERA programme breaks cover\n\nLeonardo's HERA. (Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)\n\nTucked away on the corner of a stand within one of the Paris Air Show exhibition halls was a model of Leonardo’s proposed Hydrogen-powered Hybrid Electric Regional Aircraft (HERA).\n\nDeveloped to meet the needs of the EU’s Clean Aviation programme, the 40-50 seat HERA is planned to have two conventional engines and eight distributed electric propellers. It will have a battery mass of 3,000kg and a projected entry into service of 2035.\n\nHydrogen fuel cell Piper Cherokee to begin taxi tests\n\nSeen here in its Californian hangar, Hydroplane’s modified PA-28 Piper Cherokee will start taxi trials next month using a hydrogen fuel cell electric powerplant. Its first flight using the new propulsion system is slated for next summer. (Hydroplane)\n\nIt might not quite be rocket science, but Los-Angeles based Hydroplane – founded by former NASA engineer Dr. Anita Sengupta – is forging forward with plans to develop a modular hydrogen fuel cell electric powerplant.\n\nWith a range of applications including the general aviation, helicopter and urban air mobility markets, the 200kW powerplant is being initially developed to fit single-engined light aircraft with the potential to scale the technology to the regional range once it has been brought to market.\n\nElaborating on the shortfalls of applying automotive-centric research to the aviation use scenario, Dr. Sengupta stressed the necessity of designing the system with flight profiles in mind. To that extent, Hydroplane has secured its second US Air Force Agility Prime contract which, in partnership with the University of Houston, will help make the project a reality.\n\nMoving beyond ground tests, the 200kw / 170hp powerplant will now be tested in a Piper PA-28 Cherokee: the airframe of choice not just for its relatively low acquisition cost but also its traditional materials (the composite structure of the initially-proposed Cirrus SR-20 presenting further challenges to modify). However, the intention is to give aircraft owners a drop-in solution (covered by a supplementary type certificate) able to mate to the primary structure of the existing airframe. Sengupta is confident of achieving at least the same time between engine overhauls as conventional powerplants, and also hopes to present a refurbishable system later down the line.\n\nWith a “year of overcoming direct challenges” ahead, taxi trials are expected to commence next month before the first flight next summer. Gaseous hydrogen will be used initially (including for the first flight) but wing-stored liquid hydrogen, offering greater volume, is the intended fuel of choice. Hydroplane also hopes to develop its own battery (essential for start-up) and a lean-assist pilot function.\n\nThree for the price of one\n\nCar or eVTOL? (Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)\n\nPortugal’s FLY.PT is promoting its proposed PPS1 modular drone at Paris this year. The innovative autonomous vehicle is designed to change from land vehicle configuration to a multicopter air vehicle mode. A common cabin can be attached to the eVTOL quadcopter, the road mobility ‘skate’ or both and both the eVTOL and skate can operate autonomously to find their own charge while the other is in use elsewhere.\n\nNothing new under the sun?\n\nThe generator uses electrolysis to generate hydrogen gas (Tim Robinson/RAeS)\n\nWhile the aviation industry is grappling with the challenges of a decarbonisation and using hydrogen as an aviation fuel, a visit to the fantastic Musee d’Air & Space co-located on the Le Bourget Airport and featuring an absolutely stunning collection, showed that there a look into the history of aeronautics may reveal that there is nothing new under the sun. One of the exhibits is a mobile hydrogen generator from 1886 and designed to be used to allow the French Army to inflate its observation balloons.\n\nFrom two wheels to two wings\n\nThe TurboLab H2R engine. (Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)\n\nAlthough best known as a manufacturer of high performance motorcycle racing engines, French company Akira is exhibiting a pair or aviation powerplants on its stand at Paris.\n\nThe first is a 250kW (300hp) hybrid turboprop that it will be testing for France’s aeronautical environmental research organisation CORAC and manufacturer TurboLab. An adaption of the existing DGEN 380 mini turbofan, combined with a customised EMRAX 348 electric motor and purpose-built gearbox the powerplant is due to begin testing by the end of the year.\n\nAkira was also showcasing the H2R hydrogen combustion engine that it has been tasked with integrating into the VoltAero hydrogen flying demonstrator.\n\nClean Aviation recognises sustainable aviation trailblazers\n\nGreen winners. (Clean Aviation)\n\nDuring a special presentation at Paris, the EU’s Clean Aviation Joint Undertaking programme the five winners of the inaugural High Five Awards, recognising individuals who have demonstrated commitment, innovative thinking and leadership in their pursuit of a greener and more sustainable aviation sector. In total, close to 100 applications were received, from 19 countries, from a wide range of profiles active in the aeronautics sector.\n\nThe winners are Amelia Gilchrist, Mechanical Engineering student at Durham University, UK (currently on a placement year at Rolls Royce Derby), Jean-Christophe Lambert, Co-founder & CEO at Ascendance Flight Technologies, France, Tine Tomažič, Director of Engineering & Programmes at Pipistrel Aircraft, Slovenia, Christiane Voigt, Head of Department Cloud Physics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the German Aerospace Centre and Henri Werij, Dean Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Delft University of Technology, the Netherlands.\n\nThe winners will serve as High Five Ambassadors for one year to help raise awareness about Clean Aviation, promote its values and objectives, and highlight the critical importance of reducing aviation’s impact on the environment.\n\nAirbus teams-up with LanzaJet to boost SAF production\n\nAirbus and SAF technology company LanzaJet announced that they have entered into an MoU to address the needs of the aviation sector through the production of SAF.\n\nDuring a press conference on the fourth day of the Paris Air Show the pair agreed to collaborate to advance building SAF facilities which will use LanzaJet’s proven, and proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. This agreement also aims to accelerate the certification and adoption of 100% drop-in SAF.\n\nAir Cahana places 250 engine order with ZeroAvia\n\nZeroAvia engines are winning orders. (ZeroAvia)\n\nA new industry entrant with aspirations to be “a turning point in aviation” has selected hydrogen-electric engines from ZeroAvia.\n\nThe deal, signed at the Paris Air Show, will provide 250 hydrogen-electric ZA2000 engines to Flyshare Inc., which will be operating under the name of Air Cahana and pioneering disruptive sustainable regional air service in California and the US West Coast. The Los Angeles-based airline is the first carrier launched solely with a mission to decarbonise aviation and will initially deliver sustainable flight using SAF before adopting zero emission propulsion technology as the technology enters the market. The company is targeting operations of turboprops using ZeroAvia’s zero-emission propulsion systems, in order to play its part in delivering a third golden era of aviation powered by clean flight.\n\nPratt & Whitney GTF commitments surpass 800 in 2023\n\nP&W GTF. (P&W)\n\nSpeaking at Paris, Pratt & Whitney has announced more than 800 GTF engine orders and commitments, including spare engines, have been placed since the beginning of 2023. Airlines and lessors who have announced orders include Azorra, Carlyle Aviation Partners, Binter, Croatia Airlines, LATAM Airlines, Qantas Airways, United Airlines and Volaris.\n\nThe announcement came as part of a media conference discussing the an MoU signed by China Aircraft Leasing Group Holdings (CALC) to select GTF engines to power an additional ten firm Airbus A320neo aircraft, with options for up to 50 aircraft, bringing their total to 40 firm GTF-powered aircraft.\n\nOrder round-up\n\nOrders from Indian airlines gave the show a massive boost (Tim Robinson/RAeS)\n\nBy the end of the fourth day, the total deals for commercial airliners were 1,306 orders and commitments, worth some $77.6bn at list prices, a significant rise from the 871 reported from Farnborough in 2022 and indicative of a stabilizing of the market post-Covid.\n\nThe break-down of airliner orders and commitments is as follows:\n\nAirbus – 846\n\nBoeing – 359\n\nDe Havilland Canada – 49\n\nEmbraer – 28\n\nATR - 24\n\nAirbus walked away with a total of 846 orders and commitments, including the record-breaking 470 aircraft ordered by Indian carrier IndiGo; coming out top of the order books with a 58% share. Overall, the A320neo was by far the most popular platform for the manufacturer. Meanwhile, rivals Boeing – who boasted a 25% share – clocked in at 359 orders and commitments, including 297 for the 737 MAX. De Havilland Canada boasted 49 aircraft orders, with Embraer following with 28 and ATR finishing with 24.\n\nSummary\n\n(Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)\n\nWith significant orders for airliners, increased interest in military capabilities due to the war in Ukraine, visible progress on sustainable technology and the historic milestone of the first eVTOL to fly at an air international air show first established in 1909 – this year’s Paris Air Show proved that the global aviation industry had finally turned a corner and the Covid pandemic was behind it. Although last year’s Farnborough 2022 was the first after the end of lockdown, last minute fears of a ‘Third Wave’ of the pandemic made for a more muted show – with UK political chaos also making for uncertainty.\n\nThis year, the Le Bourget is much more positive, with the fast-recovering Indian travel market giving a boost to both Airbus and Boeing with orders from IndiGo and Air India. The show also saw new Saudi carrier Riyadhi Air touch down in style to make its mark, two years ahead of the start of planned flights in 2025. As the biggest full-service airline to launch since Etihad some 20 years ago, expect orders and announcements from this airline in future shows.\n\nYet the show was also subtly about reassurances to existing customers, desperately awaiting airliners to ride the post-pandemic air travel wave, that the big OEMs are indeed on the case and fully committed to solving existing supply chain issues. The 1,300 orders also fell short of some predictions of 2,000 or more before the show.\n\nMeanwhile, the introduction of a dedicated Paris Air Mobility zone and the first flight of an eVTOL at a major international aerospace trade show gave a glimpse of the future of flight. The dizzying array of new electric, hybrid-electric or hydrogen-powered projects this week were also an indication of the levels of innovation that the sustainability challenge has unleashed. Many of these are targeting the ‘regional air mobility’ market beyond urban air mobility, where green, low-carbon point-to-point travel could utilise existing under-utilised small airports.\n\nOn the military side of the show, the ongoing war in Ukraine has focused military planners on high-intensity state on state warfare, with counter-drone and counter-hypersonics emerging as major trends at the show. There was also talk among some of the chalets of ramping up production rates of key weapon systems and munitions that Ukraine was consuming at a prodigious rate. The show also saw Belgium join the Franco-German-Spanish FCAS future fighter project as an observer.\n\nSpace was also on the agenda during the week - both as a way of monitoring the progress of sustainability on Earth and the environment, exploring the Cosmos, but also as an 'environment' in itself. Apollo 16 lunar module pilot, Brigadier General Charlie Duke, made a welcome return to the show to announce France's first recipients of the Astronaut Al Worden Endeavour Scholarship; a programme scheduled to deliver a week-long, hands-on astronaut training camp at Alabama. Elsewhere, the last generation of Collins spacesuit and the ten-year-lifespan Venturi rover – fully-functional and travelling to the moon in 2026 – were on display to further inspire the next generation of space explorers.\n\nWith all manner of air and space vehicles on display, and companies that covered a staggering range of sub-sectors from almost every corner of the world, this week was also a showcase for the varied careers, professions and jobs that exist this dynamic global industry. Yet as many of the engineering roles become software engineering positions, the aerospace, aviation and space industry also finds itself in a more competitive landscape and will need to up its game to attract the best talent.\n\nFinally, and working its way into almost every press briefing, chalet and exhibit was the overarching theme of sustainability – a goal to decarbonise that is uniting this varied and complex global industry around one shared aim – making the world smaller and bringing people together through sustainable air travel. The smiles and laughter this week around the chalets, halls and static lines as the show returned after four long years, made it clear there is really no substitute for face-to-face contact.\n\nDownload your copy of June AEROSPACE\n\nSample a taste of RAeS Membership with a free PDF download of the June 2023 issue of AEROSPACE magazine here.\n\nAnd finally\n\nDespite thunderstorms, blazing sun and aching feet, the AEROSPACE team rose to the occasion.
