        "text": "Volocopter’s volocity to fly during paris 2024 olympic games\n\nThe Journal officiel de la République française, or France’s official gazette, has published the ordinance regarding the authorization of flying taxis and their flights during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. Aéroports de Paris (ADP) Group spearheads the project as well as the operation of the heliport located on the territory of the city of Paris, in Quai d’Austerlitz on the Seine River, 13th arrondissement.\n\nThe pad is called the Vertiport de Paris-Austerlitz, established for public air traffic and reserved only for the use of VTOLs. But not all flying helicopter companies can fly their vehicles. Only the German aircraft manufacturer Volocopter can operate their flying taxis during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. The ordinance states that ‘only the use of the heliport by VTOLs of the Volocity type from the manufacturer Volocopter is authorized.’\n\nall images © Volocopter GmbH\n\nAre flying taxis welcome in paris?\n\nThe ordinance published in the Journal officiel de la République française adds that the heliport can function until December 31st, 2024, at the latest. In a report by The National, Paris City Hall says they would take legal action against Volocity, with the reason that its 18-rotor helicopters would create noise pollution, generate greenhouse emissions, and increase energy consumption. A France24 report states that Volocopter is seeking certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for their flying taxis and that local councils in Paris are against the use of aircraft in the city.\n\nPatrice Vergriete, Minister Delegate for Transport of France, tells La Parisien Newspaper that the government will analyze the impact of the test flights during the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and do a cost-benefit analysis. The flights of the 18-rotor VTOL resembling a helicopter may test the viability of making them part of the city’s transportation system. An updated report on Paris’ website about the flying taxis states that Volocopter has been undergoing tests at Pontoise Airfield. A goal is to transport one or two passengers between Roissy-Charles de Gaulle, Le Bourget, and Paris within minutes.\n\nVolocopter’s 2X aircraft at Pontoise airfield in France\n\nVolocopter to take Volocity to NEOM after paris\n\nVolocopter’s Volocity can only carry out flights between 8 am and 5 pm, and there should only be two flights per hour. On the other hand, the flying taxis can have up to 900 flights during the duration of the ordinance. And past the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, the aircraft would operate at altitudes ranging from 120 to 300 meters, and along with the vertiport at Quai d’Austerlitz, landing points may also include Issy-Les-Moulineaux and Saint-Cyr-l’École.\n\nBack in September 2023, the French Environmental Authority (Autorité environnementale), an independent body with an advisory role, already expressed their reservations about the use of the new mode of transport. The group believes that the flying taxis would be too noisy to fly over Paris and would consume too much electricity, especially as it can only carry one passenger (in addition to the pilot). Volocopter already conducted both crewed and remotely piloted test flights in France back in 2022. After the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, Volocopter plans to take Volocity to Rome, Osaka, and NEOM, Saudi Arabia’s ‘giga-city.’\n\nVolocopter’s Colocity is set to fly during Paris 2024 Olympic Games\n\nVolocopter’s 2X airfract at Pontoise airfield in France with crew\n\nVolocopter’s 2X aircraft flying over Singapore"
