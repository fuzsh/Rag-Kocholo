        "text": "For the first time since 2019, the Paris Air Show will be held in June 2023. Taking place every two years, the Paris Air Show is a must-attend event for many in the aviation industry. The event was canceled in 2021 because of the COVID pandemic.\n\nThis year the air show and exhibition runs June 19-25 at Le Bourget (LFPB). As this will be a busy event, in terms of both airport congestion and hotel availability, it’s recommended to begin trip planning as soon as schedule is known.\n\nThe following is an overview of what you need to know:\n\nAbout the Paris Air Show\n\nPrimary airport\n\nLFPB is the preferred general aviation (GA) airport for this event, as this is where the air show and static display take place. LFPB is a 24-hour airport of entry (AOE) with full services, fixed-base operators (FBOs) and credit available.\n\nParking availability\n\nWhile GA parking seldom runs out at LFPB , it may during the Air Show period. With regard to GA parking, there may be issues with availability, depending upon the number of aircraft needing to be accommodated. The airport authority may allocate additional parking to FBOs, but it’s at their discretion. Parking availability will depend on space available on FBO ramps and whether or not the airport authority allocates additional space. If overnight parking is not available only drop and goes will be permitted.\n\nParking restrictions\n\nThe large aircraft parking area at LFPB will be taken over by the static display and we do not expect overnight wide-body parking availability, for anything larger than an Airbus ACJ or Boeing BBJ, to be available from June 14 to at least June 28. Note that the max wingspan for parking will be 52 meters over this period, except if part of the Air Show.\n\nFrom 22nd till 26th June our ramp will not be able to accommodate aircraft with more than 32-meter wingspan (Global 7000 max).\n\nOperational Restrictions at LFPB During Air Show\n\nDuring the Air Show period, there will be airport and runway closures from time to time, for demo flight purposes. During these periods no aircraft, other than those participating in the flying display, will be permitted to operate.\n\nAll times below in UTC\n\nJune 14, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 07:30-1530\n\nJune 15, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 07:30-1530\n\nJune 16, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 07:30-1530\n\nJune 17, 2023: *Potentially closed from 11:30-14:30\n\nJune 18, 2023: *Potentially closed from 11:30-14:30\n\nJune 19, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 20, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 21, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 22, 2023: Closed from 11:30-14:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 23, 2023: Closed from 10:30-15:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 24, 2023: Closed from 10:30-15:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nJune 25, 2023: Closed from 10:30-15:30 and PPR required from 06:00-17:30\n\nAlternate airports\n\nIf you’re not able to secure overnight parking at LFPB , or if your aircraft has a wingspan of more than 52 meters, alternate parking will need to be considered.\n\nPontoise (LFPT) is located just 20 miles from LFPB .\n\nCharles de Gaulle (LFPG), six miles away, can also be considered.\n\nBoth provide full service GA support, however, LFPT has just a 5,541-foot runway. LFPT is normally not an AOE and airport hours are usually 0800-2200 local with overtime available upon request. However, during the Paris Air Show period, airport operating hours may be extended at LFPT and the airfield may temporarily be designated an AOE.\n\nIn the case of LFPG, this is a commercial airport and scheduled commercial flights take priority. Airport slots are needed for LFPG, with -5/+10 minutes deviation, and should be requested as soon as the schedule is known.\n\nOther alternates include:\n\nAlbert – Picardie Airport (LFAQ)\n\nChâlons Vatry Airport (LFOK)\n\nDeauville – Normandie Airport (LFRG).\n\nCheck Feasibility-IQ for more information on these and any other airports you may be interested in researching or visiting.\n\nAccreditation requirements\n\nAccreditation can only be obtained online via a website: https://siaeaeronef.mybadgeonline.com/aeronef. Processing time depends on the number of requests and the personnel doing the processing. The deadline for accreditation is seven days prior date of Operations and any requests received after the deadline may be delayed or rejected.\n\nAccreditation must be requested for each pilot, co-pilot and aircraft. The connection between pilots and aircraft (check of qualifications by the applicable Civil Aviation authorities) must be included in the ad hoc form.\n\nPrefectoral accreditation is required from 14 to 25 June included. Each accreditation remains valid throughout the SIAE air show.\n\nThe accreditation numbers must be mentioned in box 18 of the flight plan.\n\nThe documents which are required to make the request are :\n\nFor the aircraft : Airworthiness + Airworthiness Review Certficate\n\nFor the crew members: passport + Valid pilot licence\n\nSAFA checks\n\nSafety assessment of foreign aircraft (SAFA) checks are conducted at random throughout the European Union (EU), including at LFPB . Best practice, to avoid potential fines, delays and other issues, is to ensure you have all documentation on the SAFA checklist available and organized for inspection.\n\nHotels and local transport\n\nPreferred hotels in Paris and the immediate surrounding areas are expected to sell out during the Paris Air Show period. For short notice or last minute operations you may need to consider crew accommodations options much further out.\n\nLocal pre-paid (car with driver) transport options should be arranged as soon as schedule is known. You’ll need to ensure that the vehicle receives a sticker to allow it to enter public areas of the airport at LFPB. Your ground handler can assist in obtaining these stickers.\n\nAdditional arrival considerations\n\nDuring the period of the Paris Air Show, vehicles with the exception of public taxis, will need to have special stickers in order to access the public side of the airport. Note that private transportation providers will not be able to access the airport without these stickers. Transportation options like Uber will not be given access to the public area of the airport for this event. Additional airport security measures will be evident during the Air Show period with military police stationed throughout the airfield. Additional checks will be done, even for parked GA aircraft, to ensure integrity of security at LFPB .\n\nBe mindful of reporting requirement for currency or currency equivalents of more than 10,000 Euros per family, as well as for importation of any goods greater than 430 Euros in value. Should you exceed this limits, a “Declaration of Valuables” needs to be completed on arrival and/or departure to avoid potential fines and/or delays.\n\nConclusion"
