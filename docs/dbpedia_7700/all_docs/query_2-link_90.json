The City of Paris lies 270km to the north.\n\nInÂ 1936, Marcel Dassault created his firstÂ aircraft manufacturing plant at this site, later the location of ChÃ¢teauroux-DÃ©ols Air Base.\n\nIn March of 2007,Â the French state transferred management responsibility to the Regional Council of the Centre, which decided to develop the airport's industrial activities, both in the field of air freight traffic and aircraft maintenance.\n\nThe ChÃ¢teauroux Airport Today\n\nThe airport is assigned ICAO code LFLX, and IATA code CHR.\n\nThe control tower at the ChÃ¢teauroux Airport in France\n\nIt features asphalt runway 03/21 3,500m (11,483ft) in length and 45m in width, capable of receiving the largest aircraft flying today, including the Boeing 747, Airbus A380 and Antonov An-124. It offers a CAT 1 ILS (Category 1 Instrument Landing System).\n\nChÃ¢teauroux-Centre Airport is used by both passenger and cargo planes. It also serves as a pilot training site for both commercial and military planes. Users of the facility includeÂ Airbus,Â Air France,Â British Airways,Â EasyJet,Â KLM, theÂ French Air Force,Â Lufthansa and other airlines and air forces.\n\nThe airport has a large aeronautical maintenance area utilized by a number of companies. Dale Aviation Ltd specializes in the line maintenance of commercial Airbus and Boeing commercial aircraft. This company also stores aircraft with operational support, and offers dismantling and recycling of aircraft at the end of the life.\n\nThe airport grounds are entirely enclosed by a perimeter security fence that meets ICAO standards, and controlled access gates.\n\nIt is located two hours by road from Paris, and is situated just outside the town of ChÃ¢teauroux. The airport is a multi-modal site served by the A20, A10 and A71. It also features a dedicated rail link that connects the airport with the French railways (SNCF) Paris - Toulouse line.\n\nFor more information, visit the website of the the ChÃ¢teauroux Airport or phone +33 2 54 60 53 53\n\nAviation maintenance and storage facilities at the ChÃ¢teauroux-Centre Airport\n\nAirliner Storage at ChÃ¢teauroux During the COVID-19 Outbreak\n\nAs anyone that flies, has ties to the aviation industry, or watches TV knows, the worldwide outbreak of the Corona Virus had a major negative impact on airlines and their fleets, worldwide.\n\nHundreds of airliners were placed in storage around the world.\n\nChÃ¢teauroux-Centre Airport stored a number of airliners during the COVID-19 pandemic, including eleven (11) British Airways A380s.
