        "text": "The 194th General Hospital arrived in England on 9 November 1944, in France on 26 December 1944, moved to Belgium on 1 October 1945 (probably for redeployment), and then returned to the United States for inactivation.\n\nYou found the picture of it in Paris from the History of Medicine Division of the NLM; it was likely set up in more than one location. And would have operated between 1,00 and 2,000 beds, depending on when in the war it was. Looks like they were in a fixed facility in Paris, but they could also set up a general hospital under canvas if they had to.\n\nYou can read more about how the evacuation system worked here (note that there were some differences for the Army Air Force, but they all ended up in the same General Hospitals)\n\nWW2 Military Hospitals | WW2 US Medical Research Centre (med-dept.com)\n\nAs for what the address can tell you, the C/O Postmaster, NY tells you that it's the same as what most of us would call \"APO, New York.\"\n\nThe provide location information for the military postal service to distribute the mail without compromising unit locations.\n\nI did a Google search, and found this list of APOs used in World War II in, of all places, the National Archives' digital holdings:\n\nNumerical listing of APO's, January 1942 - November 1947 : United States. Adjutant-General's Office : Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming : Internet Archive\n\nAs an aside, the distribution of mail was so fouled up at the beginning of the deployment of troops to Europe, and the backlog so bad, that one of the two people that Fort Lee has been renamed for, Army Lieutenant Colonel Charity Adams, was the commander of the WAC battalion that fixed the mail distribution problem in the European Theater.\n\nThe True Story of Netflix's 'Six Triple Eight' | History | Smithsonian Magazine\n\nmarissabchampion\n\nThank you for posting your question on History Hub!\n\nWe suggest that you request a copy of your grandfather's Official Military Personnel File (OMPF). OMPFs and individual medical reports for individuals who served with the U.S. Army Air Forces who were separated from the service after October 1912 and before 1960 are in the custody of NARA's National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis. In many cases where personnel records were destroyed in the 1973 fire, proof of service can be provided from other records such as morning reports, payrolls, and military orders, and a certificate of military service will be issued. Please complete a GSA Standard Form 180 and mail it to NARA's National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel Records), 1 Archives Drive, St. Louis, MO 63138-1002. Veterans and next of kin of deceased veterans also may use eVetRecs to request records. See eVetRecs Help for instructions. If there is any information requested by the form that you do not know, you may omit it or provide estimates (such as for dates), but the more information you provide, the easier it will be to locate the correct file if it survived the fire. For more information see Official Military Personnel Files (OMPF), Archival Records Requests.\n\nWe searched the National Archives Catalog and located the series Name Index to the Series Missing Air Crew Reports (MACRs), 1942â€“1947. You may want to review this alphabetical index to determine if there are records related to your grandfather's plane crash. If you are able to find an index card for your grandfather with a report number listed on the card the report number can then be used to search the series Missing Air Crew Reports (MACRs), 1942 - 1947.\n\nIf your grandfather's plane crash was the result of an accident and not from combat you may want to request the accident report.\n\nWorld War II Army Air Forces and Air Force accident reports up to 1955 are in the custody of the Air Force Historical Research Agency (AFHRA), 600 Chennault Circle, Building 1405, Maxwell Air Force Base, AL 36112-6424.\n\nWe invite you to continue the conversation with community members on History Hub, but should you have follow up questions for the staff at Archives II, please email us at archives2reference@nara.gov so that we can assist you further.\n\nWe hope this assists you with your research!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\n\n[RR2RR 23-54034-SZ]"
