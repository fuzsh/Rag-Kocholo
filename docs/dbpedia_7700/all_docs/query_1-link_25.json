It quickly created an airfield to protect the entrenched camp in Paris from German air attacks. The requisition of agricultural land was immediately followed by the installation of seven wooden and canvas hangars, and barracks for workshops and administrative offices. In 1915, the effectiveness of the squadrons against the night-time attacks by Zeppelins remained disappointing, and the squadrons were sent to the front in rotation by a third. The Le Bourget site was nonetheless experiencing a densification of its infrastructure, mainly in the territory of the commune of Dugny, where the air reserve continued to develop, reaching up to 500 aircrafts.\n\nAfter First World War, the air reserve continued its activities on Le Bourget site. In the aftermath of the conflict, civil aviation benefited from installation and equipment at Le Bourget airport which quickly made it the benchmark Parisian airport. The first regular lines served London, Brussels and Amsterdam then, gradually, all of Europe. Le Bourget became a place to stroll where you came to admire these machines that would soon connect the four corners of the world. It was a place of departure or arrival of large air raids. On May 8, 1927, l'Oiseau Blanc airplane took off from Le Bourget. Its pilots, Charles Nungesser and Fran√ßois Coli, hoped to reach New York nonstop; unfortunately the plane inexplicably disappeared. It was finally Charles Lindbergh who made the first aerial crossing of the North Atlantic between New York and Paris, on May 21, 1927. A huge crowd came to applaud the aviator, winner of the North Atlantic, posing on his Spirit of Saint Louis airplane. A huge crowd also welcomed Edouard Daladier on September 29, 1938, after the signing of the Munich agreements.\n\nIn 1935, the architect Georges Labro won the competition for the construction of a new terminal for the international exhibition in Paris in 1937. The winning project was a building with sober architecture, 233 meters long, integrating the set of functions for the reception of passengers and the management of the airport. Not completely completed to welcome the first visitors to the world fair in June, the terminal was officially opened on November 12, 1937. In 1939, Le Bourget Airport, with 21,000 aircraft movements and 138,000 passengers, was the second airport in Europe after that of Berlin-Tempelhof.\n\nDuring Second World War, the Germans took possession of the airport and enlarged it considerably while occupying the city. On August 16, 1943, American and British forces bombed the runways, but the air base remained occupied until the Liberation. This bombing of August 16, 1943, called operation Starkey, intended to destroy the airport, shaved the town of Dugny to 98% and the north of the city of Le Bourget.\n\nAt the Liberation, Le Bourget Airport was rehabilitated by the Americans and the British. From May 1945, 42,000 prisoners of war and deportees were repatriated and then passed through Le Bourget. After the war, airport traffic increased rapidly and, in 1952, Paris acquired a new airport, that of Orly. In the 1960s, the saturation of the latter led to a return of activities at Le Bourget but in 1974, Roissy-en-France airport was opened to traffic. Le Bourget airport was gradually abandoned."
