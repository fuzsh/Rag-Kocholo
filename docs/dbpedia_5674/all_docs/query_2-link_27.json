Any information you can provide about your family members, past or present, would be very welcome. Please forward to henry@mordaunt.me.uk.\n\nThis page was last amended on July, 2022.\n\nPreamble:\n\nThe main source for the information below are the transcribed US censuses from 1850 available on a number of genealogical websites. The Mordaunts of England and Ireland were a pretty static lot and so it is possible to refer to the London Mordaunts, the Lancashire Mordaunts or the Wexford Mordaunts etc. It is not quite so simple in the USA. Like their fellow new compatriots they spread out rapidly across the vast continent moving hundreds if not thousands of miles between censuses. Also, across such a vast continent, no census could be complete and many clearly slipped through the census net.\n\nWhere possible, I have tried to trace families back to the identifiable original settlers/immigrants, then list the others by whereever and wheenever they first happen to appear in any record.\n\nPre-census Records\n\nMordaunts of recorded English origin\n\nMordaunts of recorded Irish origin\n\nMordaunts who entered from Canada\n\nMordaunts born in the US of uncertain origin\n\nMordaunts recorded from Europe and elsewhere\n\nCivil War references\n\nMordaunt Pseudonyms\n\nInternet sources\n\nPre-census Records\n\nWilliam Mordaunt, of Scovestown, Pembrokeshire in Wales, that bit of Wales that used to be called \"Little England beyond the sea,\" is mentioned in a 1682 Pennsylvania archive of lands granted by William Penn to purchasers from England, Ireland and Scotland. The website of \"The Great Valley House,\" Valley Forge, says that William Penn deeded to William Mordaunt a tract of 607 acres on October 24th 1681. William was a younger brother of one of the baronets in England. He, on his death, bequeathed it to his heir Thomas Mordaunt. Thomas and his brother, Osmond sold, the land in 1711.\n\nCapt Benjamin Mordantt, circa 1700 in New Hampshire\n\nCathy Hawk, living in Tennessee, kindly contact me with the following information\n\nNot long ago, using online records and books I found that my family contains Mordaunt blood, as well, dating back to the 18th century. Capt Benjamin Mordantt (as spelled in one book) of the Channel Islands (saidjersey or Guernsey ) who had no male issue, settled in an ancient and historic island-town called New Castle (New Hampshire). Well documented is the marriage of one of his daughters, Margaret, probably born between 1705 and 1715 (based on the age of her husband) to Capt. Benjamin Randall, son of the Rev. Benjamin Randall who started a whole new religious sect (Called Free Baptist). Google searches will bring it up. Benjamin and Margaret Mordantt had 9 children. My ancestors came from the marriage between Mary Mordantt and another guy in New Castle, called Meshach Bell. Two of their sons participated in the Revolutionary War, and one of them, Fredrick M. Bell (the initial being for, you guessed it, Mordantt), who actually died while in battle. He is fairly well documented, as well. I am currently working on finding records for Capt. Benjamin Mordantt (whose name appears in various spellings: Mordant, Mordaunt, Morden, Mordan) and how it was that his branch of the Mordaunts ended up in the Channel Islands.\n\nRobbie Meadows-O'Brien confirms:\n\n\"Bell, Frederick Mordaunt (N.H.). 1st Lieutenant 2d New Hampshire, 23d May to -- December, 1775; Captain 8th Continental Infantry, 1st January, 1776; Captain 2d New Hampshire, 8th November, 1776; wounded at Stillwater, 19th September, 1776, and died from his wound 9th October, 1777.\"\n\nElizabeth Mordant was sentenced to transportation to the American colonies in 1723 for stealing 10 pence, (about 7 cents?). She was tried for the theft of 7 guineas ($13?) but if she had been found guilty she would have faced hanging and so the jury was merciful and only found her guilty of stealing a sum under 1 shilling (8 cents?), which meant she received what was considered at the time as a lenient sentence.\n\nHowever, a list of sentences carried out between 1720 and 2nd October 1734 records an Elizabeth Mordant receiving the death penalty for stealing more than 1 shilling, (5p in modern currency), but regretably no account of the trial. Was that just coincidence? Was it the same poor Elizabeth?\n\nWilliam Mordant married Ann Watts at St. Barnabus church, Queen Anne Parish, Prince Georges, Maryland, on December 22, 1715. A Harvey family genealogy website, which seems to have disappeared from the Internet, did refer to a circa 1741 Will of a William Mordaunt in Maryland, but it made no reference of surviving sons to whom to leave any estate .\n\nMordaunts of recorded English Origin\n\nGeorge Mordaunt is recorded as marrying Jenet Latham on 19th May 1756 in the church of St. Peter and St. Paul in the parish of Ormskirk, Lancashire, England. \"Jenet\" seems to have been a family name among the Lathams around that time. The Lancashire parish records then show a number of Mordaunts born very soon after this wedding. It is possible they were brothers and sisters, George and Jenet's children. It is also possible they were cousins. Either way, they were clearly the \"next generation\" from George and Jenet. They in turn were followed by the \"third\" generation, born in the 1780s and 1790s, and then a \"fourth,\" born in the 1810s and 1820s\".\n\nVery much the third generation but I have found no hint as to whose son he may have been was:\n\nWilliam Mordaunt named in his son's marriage record as a gardener\n\nRobert Mordaunt. In the English 1841 census, a Robert Mordaunt was a trainee blacksmith in the village of Bickerstaffe, Lancashire. With him was a James Mordaunt but it is unclear if this was a brother or, perhaps, a cousin. Whatever the relationship, James afterwards led a solid, secure life as a blacksmith while Robert appears to have been more wild. After the 1841 census, he seems to disappear from the census records but his marriage to Martha Tasker was recorded at St. Nicholas's, Liverpool, on 13th June, 1847, and then St Michael's church, Aughton, records Robert Mordaunt, a blacksmith, and his wife Martha at the baptism of their daughter, Elizabeth, on 13 August 1848. Martha Mordant, (sic), (abt 1829 - ?) does appears in the 1851 census, listed as married but with no mention of her husband. She was born in Bickerstaffe but living in Kirkdale, West Derby district.\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (about 1845 - 1904?). He appears to have married Emma in 1871 and lived in Everton. In the 1901 census he was working as a dock labourer. They had three lodgers in their house.\n\nElizabeth (Eliza) Mordaunt (1848 - ?), baptised on 13th August 1848. The record of the birth of an Elizabeth Mordaunt in Aughton in 1848 gives her mother's maiden name as Tasker. She appears to have married in 1872.\n\nMartha too disappears from the records after the 1861 census by which time she had had another daughter, Phoeby (sic) Mordaunt (b.1857 - ?), and was working as a laundress..\n\nA Robert Mordaunt was found not guilty of burglary at Liverpool Assizes on 11th August 1852. There were simply not that many Robert Mordaunts about at this time, so the suspicion has to be that these are all one and the same Robert. Did he, after this, abandon his young bride and children in England and start a new family in Canada?\n\nRobert Mordaunt (abt 1827 - 31st August 1908), a blacksmith, appears in Ontario in the 1861 Canadian census and then in subsequent censuses living with an entirely different family, which started about 1857, in Marysborough North (now North Marysburgh?), Prince Edward. His new wife, Elisa/Eliza/Lizabeth Murphy (abt. 1827 - ?), was from Ireland. Robert and Elisa/Eliza/Lizabeth were both alive for the 1901 Canadian census. By the 1911 census, Robert had died and Eliza was an 83 year-old widow living with her son Robert and daughter Ella.\n\nDavid Murphy Mordaunt (August 4th 1854 - March 6th 1932) married Caroline Amelia Van Egmond (abt.1857 - 1924) in Egmondsville on 6th September 1877. They crossed into the United States and were listed in the 1880 census, to be followed later by at least two of his brothers. They were in various Cleveland, Ohio, wards in the 1900/1910/1920 and 1930 censuses. David was variously described as a horseshoer and blacksmith and is listed in 1890 and 1900 Cleveland, Ohio, city directories in partnership with a S. R. Gilmore at 440 Woodland Avenue and 1724 Cedar Avenue. He and Caroline were members of the Congregationalist Church. Clearly successful, he owned a $12,000 home by the 1930 census, by which time he was widower, living with Anna Van Egmond, his sister-in-law, who had lived with him and his wife Caroline for over 50 years, since before the 1880 census. No children were ever listed for him.\n\nThomas Mordaunt (1857 - 1932) crossed to the US in 1884 according to his entry in the US 1900 census when he was recorded as lodging in Cleveland, Ward 1, Ohio, with his son Robert, working as a teamster. He was a widower. In a 1900 Cleveland, Ohio, city directory he was described as a labourer, resident at 69 Cross. Birth records for his son Robert and another, unnamed, son born in 1887, show that his wife Hannah (? - before 1900) was also from Canada. A marriage record for the locality shows a Thomas Mordaunt married an Anna Cooper in Cuyahoga, Ihio, on March 1, 1883, just to add to confusion about names and dates. In the 1910 census he was working as a porter to a private family in Akron. He seems to have returned to Canada. His address was given as Picton, Prince Edward, on the death certificates of his sister Ellen in 1935 and his brother William in 1936\n\nRobert Thomas Mordaunt (April 17 1885 - September 18, 1949) was born in Ohio. He married Goldie B. Fay, a farmer's daughter (May 21st 1890 - December 12th 1972) from Ohio on March 22nd 1906. His WWI draft registration card was dated September 1918 so I doubt if he made it to the Western Front. In the 1920 census he was a deputy sheriff for the county, but by the 1930 census he had settled to be an automobile salesman. (Additional detail from a Fay family website). Goldie appears in the 1950 census, a widow who had worked 72 hours the previous week as a housekeeper.\n\nDelbert Fay Mordaunt (1907 - 1995) was born in Ohio. At the 1930 census he had just married Mildred (April 8th 1906 - January 1979) and was in Cleveland working as an automobile salesman, like his father. In the 1940 census he was a \"service man\" for an alluminating company, whatever that was. I cannot read what company he worked for in the 1950 census.\n\nJames Allan Mordaunt (b. July 14, 1940) who married 1. Patricia E. ? but the marriage was disolved in July 1988 in Cuyahoga County. He married in 2. Camille L. Sansone on 25th May 1991. I am very grateful to James for contacting my Guestbook on 12th April 2010 with additional information about his family\n\nJeffrey James Mordaunt (b. January 31 1971) who married Amy Leibee in Cuyahoga County on 21st October 1994.\n\nTravis Mordaunt (b. 2002)\n\nAndrew Mordaunt (b. 2003)\n\nStanley Mordaunt (1912 - 1986) was born in Ohio. By the 1940 census he had married Sylvia (abt. 1911 - ?). He was working as a salvage man for an electrical appliance company and she was a telegraph operator. By the 1950 census they had a son\n\nThomas Edward Mordaunt (b. 1945/46). A Thomas E. Mordaunt married Diane L. Hinds in Cuyahoga County on September 15, 2007. Was it he or a son?\n\nRobert Thomas Mordaunt (1917 - 1996) was born in Ohio. He married Ethel Dommer, (born abt. 1920). They were listed in the 1950 census, living in Cleveland Cuyahoga county. He apparently repaired transformers for an illuminating company, if I have read it correctly.\n\nRobert Thomas Mordaunt III (October 1 1941 - 1993). He married 1. Karen A. Kovsca in 1962 but they were divorced in Medina County in 1978.\n\nKimberly Kay Mordaunt was born in Cuyahoga County. She married Howard Cerovac in 1997 but they divorced. She married Richard Anthony Mancho II in Clark County in 2002. She has worked for NASA for over thirty years. I am very grateful to Kimberly who wrote to me via the guest Book with additional information about her family.\n\nRobert Thomas Mordaunt IV was born in Cuyahoga County.\n\nRobert Thomas III then married 2. Nannie but they were divorced in Cuyahoga County in 1992.\n\nRichard Allan Mordaunt (November 8th 1945 - October 23rd - 1981) married Jean Schlegel (b. March 9th 1946).\n\nRichard Allan Mordaunt(b. 1968) who married Regina Diehl\n\nRyan Mordaunt (b. June 22nd, 1995)\n\nCole Mordaunt (b. April 1st, 1998)\n\nScott Allan Mordaunt (b. September 17th, 1970) who married Tricia Tomasovic in Medina County on September 19, 1998\n\nElla Mordaunt (b. August 7th 2003)\n\nLogan Mordaunt (b. March 15th 2009)\n\nAfter Richard's death, Jean married John Tysiak in 1987. I am very grateful to Jean Mordaunt-Tysiak for information about her family.\n\nEliza Maud Mordaunt (10th June 1886 - 29th January 1963). She married Conrad Schmehl (? - 1960) in Cuyahoga County on December 3rd 1902.\n\nEllen Mordaunt (abt. 1859 - ?)\n\nIsibella (sic) Mordaunt (abt. 1864 - ?)\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (abt. 1866 - ?) a blacksmith, had crossed to the US by 1890 when he is listed in a Cleveland city directory working as a blacksmith at 1781 Cedar Avenue. By the time of the 1900 census he was in Cleveland Ward 16, Ohio with his Ohio born wife, Catherine (abt. 1879 - ?). They had maried in about 1895 and owned their own home. A Will Mordaunt is named as the father of an unnamed daughter to Kittie York in the Cleveland, Ohio, birth records, presumably this was daughter Hazel. The family appear again in the 1910 census but, except for their son Lester, I cannot identify them in later records. There is an entry from a marriage record of the locality in the LDS IGI list of a William Mordaunt marrying Effie Lieber on September 24, 1890, in Cuyuhoga, Ohio. I wonder if it was an earlier marriage.\n\nPearl Mordaunt (abt. 1897- ?) was born in Ohio. She married ? Stram.\n\nHazel Mordaunt (abt. 1901- ?) was born in Ohio. She married ? Atkinson\n\nLester Mordaunt (1904 - 1967) was born in Ohio. In the 1930 census he was an inmate at the Cleveland State Hospital, in the 1940 census at the Hawthornden State Hospital for the Insane in Sagamore Hills Village, Summit County. His death was recorded in Cleveland.\n\nHoward Mordaunt (abt. 1909 - 1970.) was born in Ohio. He appears in the 1950 census with a wife, Rose and a one year old step-son, Frederick Clark. His job was described as a supervisor for a soap company. His final residence was Miami.\n\nMaybelle Mordaunt (? - July 27th 1964) married Robert Zimmerman.\n\nRobert Mordaunt (November 12th 1870 - February 14th 1923) was still in Prince Edward. Ontario, for the 1901 Canadian census with his wife, Bertha Love (October 26th 1880 - March 2nd 1910). However, he was listed in a 1890 Cleveland, Ohio, city directory working as a teamster with his brother Thomas at \"80 Hill\" and also in a 1900 city directory working as a blacksmith with his brother William at 1, Jackson. In the 1911 Canadian census Robert is listed as a widower and head of a household consisting of his son, David or Gerald, his widowed mother and sister Ella. They were the only Mordaunts listed in the entire Canadian 1911 census. The record of his death in www.pilot.familysearch.com lists his wife as Ethel.\n\nDavid/Gerald? Mordaunt (February 19th 1901- ?). In the 1901 census transcript he was David. In then 1911 transcript he was Gerald.\n\nOther Mordaunts from Ohio that I have not yet identified but which must be part of this wider family:\n\nKimberly K. Mordaunt who married Howard E. Cerovac on September 8, 1984 in Cuyahoga County\n\nKaren A. Mordaunt who married Nichola J. Kozak on July 19, 1995 in Cuyahoga County\n\nAnd a divorce\n\nEdward Mordaunt who divorced his wife Sarah E. in Defiance County, perhaps far enough away to have no connection with this family.\n\nFrederick Mordaunt (abt 1813 - 1875) is difficult to follow. First appearing in the English 1851 census, his birthplace was given as Lambeth; in the 1861 census it is given as Midlands, not known. He married Margaret (given as Mary A. in the 1851 census), born in Dublin. They clearly moved around, as their children were born in different towns, but by 1851 they were living in Bethnal Green, east London, where he was described as a silk weaver.\n\nJohn Mordaunt (abt. 1842 - 1911?) was born in Manchester. His father was a silk weaver by trade and in the 1851 Engish census the 9 year-old John too is described as a silk weaver. The family moved to Islington, London, were he met and married Louisa Ann Anderson (abt 1842 - before 1910?), born in Islington, at St. Thomas's, Bethnal Green, London, on May 19, 1866. They moved about, the birth of one son given as Jersey in the Channel islands. By the 1871 English census they were back in Islington where he was working as a wood turner. Clearly restless, they emigrated to the USA travelling steerage aboard the SS Republic, passengers 302 - 308, curiously the manifest records him as a farmer, and passed through Castle Garden on April 19th 1875 . By the 1900 census they had finally settled in Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was working as a gardener. Neither John nor Louisa are mentioned in a census 1900. The death of a John Henry Mordaunt, age not givenn, was recorded in Leavenworth on March 9, 1911, buried at Mt. Muncie Cemetery.\n\nFrederick G Mordaunt (April 1868 - ?) was recorded as born in Jersey, the Channel Islands. My guess is that he is the Fred Mordaunt, recorded as born in New Jersey (I doubt if the census taker would have understood a Jersey in the Channel Islands), a telegraph operator in Viento, Wasco County, Oregon, in the 1900 census married to Oregon born Alice (July 1876 - ?).\n\nPearl Mordaunt (April 1994 - ?) who was born in Oregon\n\nLouisa Mordaunt (1868 - ?) was born in Islington, London.\n\nAlice Mordaunt (1870 - ?) was born in Islington, London.\n\nNeither of the above two sisters are listed with the family in any census after their arrival in the US and may well have married. One of them had a son\n\nRobt Judge (abt. 1891 - ?) who was listed with his grandparents, John and Louise in the 1900 federal census, aged 9 years, and a 1905 Kansas census\n\nSophia Mordaunt (1872 - ?) was born in Islington, London. She married Frank U. Henry in about 1898, according to the 1910 census. Her death was recorded in Leavenworth December 14, 1958.\n\nMargaret Mordaunt (1874 - 1952) was born in Islington, London. She slipped through the 1910 census but reappears in the 1920 census when she was unmarried, working as a bookkeeper for a building company, living in a boarding house. She married Frank B. Henderson (abt. 1878 - ?), a dentist born in Maine of Scottish parents, in about 1922, when she was 42 years-old. Her death was recorded in Leavenworth, June 1952.\n\nHenry C. Mordaunt (3 Jul 1877 - ?) was born in Missouri. In the 1910 census he is the only family member recorded in Leavenworth, where he was working as a freight officer with the rail road and owned his own house. In 1908 he had married Maud(e) Leahy (abt. 1877 - 1960), a widow. He was drafted for World War 1 in September 1918 and so would not have seen any action. He was recorded as living in St. Joseph Ward 8, Buchanan, Missouri, just over the state border from Leavenworth. They were there for the 1920 census (page 1 and page 2), the 1930 census and the 1940 census when, aged 62 tears, he was still working for the railroad as a local freight agent.\n\nJohn H. Mordaunt (abt. 1908 - abt. 1913)\n\nMargarett A. Mordaunt (abt. 1913 - ?) was born in Buchanan, Missouri\n\nRichard Horace Mordaunt (1914 - 1990) was born in Buchanan, Missouri. He attended the Central High School, St. Joseph, Missouri. He married Trella(?) Mae Coplin in 1939 and they were recorded in Dallas in the 1940 census. He practiced medicine in Iowa after serving in the US Navy in World War II (enlisted July 7, 1941). (With thanks to his daughter Cindy for filling in additional information). They appear in the 1950 census.\n\nRichard Horace Mordaunt (1941 - 2007). He married Linda Liechty. The Iowa City Press Citizen published a funeral announcement of an infant son, Garrett Andrew Mordaunt in July 1968. The same paper announced the birth of a daughter on Saturday, September 2, 1972.\n\nGarrett Andrew Mordaunt (1968 - 1968)\n\na daughter Mordaunt (b. September 2, 1972)\n\nMargaret Jeanne Mordaunt (b. 1942).\n\nCynthia (Cindy) Mordaunt (b. 1950). She married ? Rosborough\n\nErnest H. Mordaunt (1880 - before 1923) was born in Missouri. About 1905 he married Carrie A. Gaw (? - 1963) and in the 1910 census and 1920 census was living in Seattle with his parents-in-laws. His World War 1 draft registration card was dated September 1918 so, like his brother Henry, it seems very unlikely he would have seen any fighting. However, in a 1923 Seattle directory, Carrie was described as a widow. She and her son Ernest were listed in the 1930 census and 1930 census.\n\nErnest J. Mordaunt (1909 - 1983) was born in Washington state. The 1910 census described him as adopted. With thanks to the McElmurry family tree for the information about his subsequent life, he married Dorothy Ruth McElmurry (b. 1918 - ?) on August 28th 1940 and lived in the rural Des Moines, Washington, area. His name is unreadable in the 1950 census, and is transcribed as Jeffret?!? He was a clerk to an aircraft factory. Could that have been Boeing? They were living in Seattle.\n\nMonte Richard Mordaunt (1947 - 2009). In 1965 he married Lynn Marie Caskey\n\nKane Martin Mordaunt (b. 1996) who is a U. of Washington graduate and a chemical engineer in research and development with Boeing in Seattle. He married Michelle Andrina Finnigan (b.1967), a physiotherapist, in 1989.\n\nTheodore Patrick Mordaunt (b. 1998) I am grateful to Theodore for writing to me in June 2021 giving me his and his brother's details\n\nAugustus Martin Mordaunt (b. 2000)\n\nRebbekkah (Bekky) Lynn Mordaunt (b. 1967), who has a business degree from the U. of Idaho. She married Mike Berndt, a high school English teacher and coach, in 1986.\n\nAmanda Lorraine Berndt (b. 1990)\n\nNicholas Berndt (b. 1992)\n\nMonte and Lynn divorced in 1984. He married 2nd. Li Wong and 3rd., in November 1991, Josephine Ollitness. He died in Onaway/Potlatch, Idaho\n\nCarol Annette Mordaunt (b. 1953) has a master's degree in counselling. In 1982 she married attorney Stanley Leonard Moerbeek (b. 1951)\n\nSarah Carol Moerbeek (b.1985)\n\nNoah Adrian Moerbeek (b. 1987\n\nThere are three Mordaunt family groups born in England who arrived in the mid to late 1850s, all recorded in Council Bluffs, Pottawattamie, Iowa, in the 1870 census. They missed the English 1841 and 1851 censuses and none of them are readily identifiable in any later US census and seem to disappear off the face of the earth. There are sufficient similarities between them to suggest they were brothers/cousins\n\nJames Mordaunt (abt 1820 - ?) and his wife Elisabeth Mordaunt (abt 1824 - ?) were living in Council Bluffs Ward 4 in the 1870 census. He was working as a carpenter.\n\nMary Mordaunt (abt 1852 - ?) born in England\n\nLizzie Mordaunt (abt 1854 - ?) born in England\n\nA. Mordaunt (abt 1822 - ?) and his wife, Victoria (abt. 1824 - ?) were both born in England and living in Ward 1 in the 1870 census. He was described as a gardener, but he still had personal assets of $600.\n\nAlbert Mordaunt (abt 1852 - ?) born in England was working as a laborer in 1870.\n\nEdward Mordaunt (abt 1854- ?) born in England\n\nCarrie Mordaunt (abt 1856- ?) born in Utah\n\nElisabeth Mordaunt (abt 1860 - ?) born in Utah\n\nCharles Mordaunt (abt 1863 - ?) born in Utah\n\nAugustus Mordaunt (abt 1864 - ?) born in Utah\n\nJames Mordaunt (abt 1828 - ?) and his wife Alice Mordaunt (abt. 1831 - ?) were also living in Ward 4 in the 1870 census. He was working as a plasterer.\n\nCharles Mordaunt (abt 1858 - ?) born in England\n\nArthur Mordaunt (abt 1861- ?) born in Utah\n\nAlbert Mordaunt (abt 1862- ?) born in Utah\n\nJane Mordaunt (abt 1864- ?) born in Utah\n\nJames Mordaunt (abt. 1833 - ?) and his wife Jane (June?) ( abt. 1836 - ?), both born in England, were living in Philadelphia, PA, at the time of the in the 1880 census. He was a bricklayer, unemployed for two months. I cannot find them in any later record.\n\nWilliam F. Mordaunt (abt. 1845 - before 1910?), born in England, was working as a gilder and living in West Springfield, Hampden, MA, at the 1880 census. His wife Mary I. Fitzgerald (abt. 1851 - ?) was from Vermont of Irish parents. They seem to have married in Springfield in 1873. Mary was described as living in New York at her daughter Mabel's wedding in 1910.\n\nGeraldine Ida Mordaunt (August 1, 1874 - ?) was born in Springfield, Hampden, Massachusets. She married Philip McGovern in Manhattan on February 20, 1897\n\nSusie M. Mordaunt (1875 - ?) was born in Massachusetts\n\nEdward Rutherford Mordaunt (1877 - August 13th 1925) was born in Massachusetts. He is listed in the 1910 census in Queens and the 1920 census in Brooklyn Assembly District 7, married to Harriet E. (Edith H. in the 1920 census) (1878 - ?) from New York and working as a pharmacist. His World War 1 draft registration card on www.ancestry.com is half missing. His death was recorded in Kings\n\nEdward Rutherford Mordaunt Jnr. (abt 1908 - ?) was born in New York. In the 1930 census he was living with his widowed mother in a rented home in Brooklyn, working as a bank clerk.\n\nDorothy E. L. Mordaunt (abt. 1910 - ?) was born in New York. In the 1930 census 1930 she was living at home with her widowed mother in a rented home in Brooklyn, working as a telephone operator\n\nMabel Blanche Mordaunt (September 14, 1886 - ? was born in Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts. She is, presumably the Mabel Mordaunt, an actress, daughter of Mary, who married actor William B. Norris (born Norris Block) (?- 1929) on June 1, 1910, at St. James Episcopal Church in Chicago, Illinois, reported in the NY Times on 2 June 1910. They had a son, William Junior.\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (abt 1845 - 10/5/1918) and his wife, Louisa were temporary residents in the US. He was working as a cigar maker in Cincinatti Ward 16, Hamilton, OH, at the time of the 1860 census. They originated in Guernsey in the Channel Islands and had one daughter born in the USA in 1861 before packing their bags and returning to Guernsey before the birth of their next (surviving?) child in 1868\n\nEmily L. A. Mordaunt (b. 1861)\n\nFrank Mordaunt (abt. 1847 - ?) from England, was recorded in the 1880 census in Saint Louis, Missouri, working as a clerk for the rail road. He appears to be recorded twice in the census at different addresses.\n\nFrancis Lionel Mordaunt (May 8, 1845 - October 5, 1918) can be traced to Somerset, part of the extended family of the baronet Mordaunts. He was the great great grandson of Sir Charles Mordaunt, the 6th Bart. He was an officer in 23rd Royal Welch Fusiliers before emigrating to the US on 14 March 1876 on the SS Denmark. He met and married Sara Elliott Marshall (abt. 1867 - ?), of Natchez, Mississippi in Pelham, New York on December 14, 1889. They evaded the 1900 census but were found in the 1910 census in Ontario, Wayne, NY where he was a manager with a ?? mine. He died May 10, 1918. His wife Sara was listed in the 1930 census living with or visiting her sister Elizabeth Marshall in Sea Girt, NJ.\n\nElizabeth Morris Mordaunt (February 5, 1891 - ?) married D Drayton Burrill in 1918. They had two children neither of whom had further children.\n\nMildred Cumberlege Mordaunt (October 31, 1893 - ?) married David Ogden Rogers of Hyde Park, NY in 1916. He died of malaria contracted from service in Cuba under Theo. Roosevelt in 1916. They had two children, Francis Lional Mordaunt Rogers and Nathalie Penddleton Rogers, who married Joseph James Spurr III.\n\nI am grateful to Mildred's grandson, Jay (Joseph James) Spurr IV, of Alexandria, VA. for contacting me about his family. More details of his family can seen in my Guest Book, 2010-06-03.\n\nMildred later married Arthur Spencer Kittle, a stock broker from New York.\n\nEdward Albert Mordaunt (abt. 1850 - ?), born in Ormskirk, Lancashire, (see The Mordaunt Family in Lancashire page) moved at some unknown time to New York, where he met and married Scottish Canadian Jesse Henniston. He was described in the church record of his son James' christening as working as a grocer.\n\nEdward Albert Baldwin Mordaunt (26th August 1872 - ?) was born in New York. I don't know quite how his parents managed it but he was christened in St Peter's Church in Liverpool on 4th July, 1875. where they are described as living, perhaps just staying, in Everton. He was recorded as working as a publisher in the 1900 US census.\n\nUnnamed Child (b. 23 September, 1873) in Manhattan in a birth record I found earlier but cannot now trace.\n\nAccording to his wife in a later newspaper report, James, snr, died in 1874, but this does not tie in with the record of their son's christening. Jesse, as a widow, was later to have a daughter to whom she gave the surname Mordaunt.\n\nEthel Mordaunt (November 1882 - ?) was born in New York. She was at school in the 1900 census.\n\nThe family are listed in the 1900 census (where his birth year is given as 1873) as owning their own house in Manhattan but it seems that Jesse and Edward jnr. later moved to the UK. Edward jnr is listed in the UK 1911 census living in Willesden, London\n\nI am grateful to my correspondant, Simon Radcliffe, who wrote to me in June 2022 with a lot of information about this family which is listed on the Mordaunt Family in Lancashire webpage.\n\nMargaret Mordaunt (abt. 1852 - ?), born in Massachusetts of English parents, was working as a hotel maid at the 5th Avenue Hotel in Manhattan in the 1910 census.\n\nLeonard Mordaunt (1860 - 1941) was a Methodist evangelical minister from England who appeared first in the 1920 census in Los Angeles, CA. He had married Genieva (and a great variey of alternative transcripts) (1887 - 1976). Appearing again in the 1930 census and in a number of California voter registration lists, which suggest a change of church affiliation. They do not appear to have had any children. He appears for the last time in the 1940 census. Genieva was listed alone in the 1950 census. There is no record of Leonard in any UK database.\n\nNot for the first time I am grateful to my correspondent and fellow family researcher, Anthony Hoskins, whose careful research and analysis of DNA matches possibly identifies him as Logan Todd, daughter of Agnes Sophia Gertrude Todd née Mordaunt, daughter of Ewer Mordaunt and granddaughter of John Stiles Mordaunt, whose family dominates much of the Mordaunts of London page of this website.\n\nIt will be simpler for me to copy the extract from Anthony's email (dated February, 2021) to me:\n\nI have been assembling a large body of data on a remarkable petty criminal, conman - later converting to ardent Christianity and becoming a Methodist minister - named Leonard Mordaunt, born (he claimed) in 1860 in England, to unnamed parents. He led a wild life in the US from his stated arrival of 1876. After a three-year stint in a Colorado prison (highway robbery), he came to San Francisco in about 1901. By 1910, he was in Los Angeles, where he remained until his death on 4 December 1941. He ended up a revered figure, a reformed criminal, and evangelist to California prisons, ordained Methodist minister. He is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery, in Glendale (near Los Angeles). I will be visiting his grave probably in a few days. I will send you a lot of information on him in due course. I find absolutely no record anywhere of a \"Leonard Mordaunt\" born, or even in, the UK, anywhere around 1860. He was imprisoned from about 1899-1901/2 in Colorado under an assumed name, \"Harry Hastings\", I am certain, \"Leonard Mordaunt\" is also an alias, but it's one he stuck with from 1902 till his death in 1941.\n\nFor now, I am supposing that Leonard Mordaunt (assumed the name by 1902) might be my great grandfather, Logan Godfrey Todd (born Southwark, 1853) , son of Agnes (Mordaunt) Todd (1828-1897). DNA makes it clear that Logan Todd had to be the father of my grandfather, Glenn Hoskins (1891, Iowa-1962, Illinois), but Logan Todd drops of the face of the earth - record-wise - with his escape from US Army military prison in 1875. I think it certain that he immediately assumed an alias (or two, or more). Significantly, in 1920 and 1930 censuses, Leonard Mordaunt stated his year of immigration was 1876? - not, I think, coincidentally the very year following the disappearance of Logan Todd in 1875. And, as you might guess, there is absolutely no record of a person by the name of Leonard Mordaunt arriving in the US. I think his final alias, \"Leonard Mordaunt\", was assumed just before he changed his ways and \"went straight\" - it was the name he stuck to for the rest of his life, and which was likely chosen largely because it was his mother's maiden name - and sounded nothing like his real name, Todd.\n\nJohn E. Mordaunt (abt. 1868 - ?), born in England, had arrived in the US in 1890 and married, around 1893, Illinois girl, Gladys (abt 1872 - before 1920?). In the 1910 census he was a lace curtain manufacturer living in Rutherford, New Jersey. By the 1920 census and was living in Camden Ward 2, Atlantic, New Jersey, with a new wife Minnie (abt. 1883 - ?), from New York. He is described as a lace mill manager. I have not traced him with any certainty in the UK records. A John W. Mordaunt was born about 1870 in Poplar, London, who then disappears from the English census, but this is perhaps too speculative.\n\nBeatrice Mordaunt (December 4 1898 - ?) was born in New York\n\nJohn Walter Mordaunt (January 8th 1899 - 1975) was born in New Jersey. His WW I draft record was dated September 1918 so he would not have seen any action. He was described as a clerk. In the 1920 census, as Jack W Mordaunt, he was boarding in Queens District 3, New York, working as a wholesale and retail salesman. He then appears in the 1930 census, as John W P Mordaunt, married to Dorothy (abt 1902 - ?) from New York, working as a commercial salesman, and living in Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. A John Mordaunt, born in New Jersey in about 1902, is listed in the 1950 census, a proprietor of a bakery goods company, this time married to Bertha, the manager of a cafe. A John W. Mordaunt, born abt. 1902 married Helen J. Chung or Sugai (abt. 1921 - ?) in Santa Barbara in January 1972. His death appears to be recorded in Redondo Beach, Los Angeles.\n\nJohn W. P. Mordaunt (abt 1925 - ?) was born in West Virginia. At the 1940 census he was a pupil at a children's home in Yonkers, New York.\n\nCharles Mordaunt (abt 1907 - ?) was born in Illinois. A Charles Mordaunt born in 1907 died in Vernon, NJ, in 1975.\n\nDavid Mordaunt (abt. 1864 - ?), born in England, arrived in the US apparently in 1879. I have found no mention of him in English records. In about 1901 he married Jane (abt. 1867 - ?) from Rhode Island and at the 1910 census was a real estate salesman in Portland Ward 3, Oregon. They had had one child who had died. I have found no other mention of them.\n\nMaggie Mordaunt (abt. 1871 - ?), born in New York of English parents, was working as a cleaner at the Savoy Hotel in Manhattan in the 1900 census.\n\nLena Mordaunt (September 1874 - ?) from New York state of English parents was lodging in Portland Ward 3, Oregon, without employment, at the 1900 census.\n\nFredrich W. Mordaunt (abt. 1886 - ?), born in England was in Manhattan, working as a newspaper editor with his wife Helen (abt. 1888 - ?) according to the 1930 census.\n\nElinor Mordaunt (1872 - 1942) was the nom de plume of Evelyn May Clowes. An account of her life is given in Australian Dictionary of Biography. After an unhappy marriage she changed her name, and that of her son, Godfrey, by deed poll in 1915, to that of her nom de plume.\n\nI am very grateful to her great-grandson, Christopher Mordaunt, who kindly wrote to me in October 2013 about his family and tidied up some loose ends on the \"Mordaunt family in Africa\" webpage.\n\nAs already mentioned, Elinor had a son\n\nGodfrey Weston Mordaunt (March 9, 1903 - ?), born in Melbourne. He married Joan Mary Frith. At some time, he went to Kenya and was a maize and coffee grower, according to correspondence between\" \"Evelyn\" and \"Bob Barnes\" on the genealogy.com website. The correspondence gives his wife as Ann, which seems most probably an error. Joan was later to marry the plane builder Geoffrey De Haviland, in Kenya in 1951.\n\nPhillip Mordaunt (August 30, 1932 - April 18, 1997). His birth was registered in Nairobi. His marriage to Iris Mary Trevethan (? - 2013) was registered in Ampthill, Bedfordshire, UK. They emigrated to the USA in 1966 where Phillip worked as an engineer at Sikorsky Aircraft in Connecticut.\n\nChristopher Mordaunt (b. May 29, 1963) He was born in Bedfordshire, UK. He is now living in Pennsylvania.\n\nPatricia Ann Mordaunt (b. June 14 1964). She was born in Bedfordshire, UK. She is now living in Massachusetts.\n\nAnn Mordaunt. I am not sure which child was the elder. She married ? Darrell and lives in Bath, UK.\n\nMordaunts of recorded Irish Origin\n\nUnknown Mordaunt who emigrated to the US before the birth of his sons recorded in the US census, making him, perhaps, the earliest Irish Mordaunt immigrant in the US. His unknown wife was also Irish.\n\nGeorge Mordaunt (abt. 1845 - ?) was born in New Jersey and living in Philadelphia, PA. He was described in the 1880 censusas a puddler(?) and was living with brother:\n\nJohn Mordaunt (abt. 1847 - ?), an upholsterer also born in New Jersey, and his Irish born wife, Catherine (abt. 1850 - ?). Recorded as his children in the 1880 census, Page 1 and Page 2 were:\n\nJohn Mordaunt (August 1877 - ?), born in New Jersey. In the 1900 census he is recorded as a proof reader, living with an aunt, Margaret McCarthy, in Philadelphia. In the 1910 census he was described as a newspaper reporter living with a cousin, Michael Bigley in Philadelphia ward 28. His birthplace was given as Pennsylvania. In the 1920 census he was back to being a proof reader for a newspaper, now boarding in Atlantic City but again recorded as born in Pennsylvania. He was not married. I cannot trace him in the 1930 census.\n\nCatherine Mordaunt (abt. 1880 - ?), born in Pennsylvania\n\nI wonder if this George and his brother John Mordaunt from New Jersey were the Civil War soldiers from New Jersey listed below.\n\nPeter Mordaunt (abt. 1805 - ?) crossed to the USA from Liverpool on the Boadecia arriving in New York August 15th, 1849, accompanied by three younger family members, presumably his children. It suggests that he made a return trip at some point or that his wife travelled separately with more of their childreen.\n\nMary Mordaunt (abt. 1827 - ). She was to marry Edward Duley in Trenton, New Jersey, on September 7, 1851\n\nCatherine Mordaunt (abt. 1831 - )\n\nMichael Mordaunt (abt. 1836 - ). Despite a small disparity in dates, I think there is a strong possibility that he is the Michael Mordaunt immediately below.\n\nI think it is a strong probability that he was the Peter Mordaunt who, according the the 1829 Tithe Applotment list, was farming 21 acres of land at Ballynahillen in County Wexford. Peter was a very unusual name in the Mordaunt family in Ireland.\n\nWhen the rest of his family joined him I have not discovered but it was presumably he and his wife Margret/Margarite who were named as the parents of three children married in the Trenton, NJ, area. He was is listed in an 1869 Bordentown, Burlington, NJ, city directory. By the 1870 census he was a widower, living with him was his widowed daughter Ellen and her two children. The 1870 census states he was born in Pennsylvania, which seems to go against other evidence, and describes him as a retired gentlemen, if I have read it correctly, with real estate valued at $8,000. He clearly made a success of emigrating.\n\nEllen/Helen Mordaunt (abt. 1834 - ) who married Patrick Purcell in Trenton, New Jersey, on October 15, 1853, but by the 1870 census was a widow with two children living with her father. That census also states she was born in New Jersey\n\nPeter Mordaunt (abt. 1840 - ) who married Catherine Travers (1846 - ?) in Trenton, New Jersey, on November 30, 1865. They appear in the 1870 census and the 1880 census when both are described as born in Ireland. He was working as a hod carrier.\n\nJohn E. Mordaunt (abt. 1867 - ?) was born in New Jersey. He appears to be listed in the 1900 census boarding on his own in New Bedford Ward 2, Bristol, Massachusetts. By the 1910 census he had returned to New Jersey, Trenton Ward 14, married to Ada Carmody (abt. 1876 - ?) on 12th February 1906 and working as a construction contractor. In 1920 he was working as a bricklayer in a pottery. In the 1930 census they were in Hamilton, Mercer. According to the 1940 census he was still working as a bricklayer, aged 73 years. Children mentioned in records were:\n\nEdward Mordaunt (abt. 1907/08 - January 12, 1908) was born in New Jersey.\n\nHelen Mordaunt (abt. 1908 - ?) was born in New Jersey. In the 1930 census she was still living at home, working as a telephone operator.\n\nJohn Mordaunt (1911 - 1989) was born in New Jersey. He was still at home for the 1940 census. I cannot read what his employment was. He died in Trenton, NJ.\n\nCatherine (Kate) M. Mordaunt (abt. 1879 - ?) was born in New Jersey. In the 1900 census she is working as a servant in New Bedford Ward 5, Bristol, Massachusets.\n\nMichael Mordaunt (abt. 1833 - May 31st 1897?) born in Ireland, was living in Kings, Brooklyn, with his New York born wife Katherine Ann McCann (abt. 1842 - ?) and working in insurance, according to the 1880 census. The death of a Michael Mordaunt, aged 64 years and therefore born abt. 1833, on May 31st 1897 was recorded in Kings\n\nCharlotte Mordaunt (abt. 1864 - ?) was born in New York. In the 1920 census and 1930 census, with variable years of birth, she is recorded with an unmarried cousin, Mary Hewitt from Canada, in Brooklyn District 7. She was working as a time keeper at a shipyard in 1920 but having no emploment in 1930.\n\nJames Edward Mordaunt (December 3, 1866 - ?) was born in Brooklyn, Kings, New York. He was baptised February 17, 1867\n\nJohn Mordaunt (January 30 1869 - February 10th 1944?) was born in New York. He was baptised on January 30, 1869, the record in Brooklyn Catholic Church, misspelt Mourdant. With a year of birth given of 1872, he is listed in the 1920 census boarding with his brother Edward in Brooklyn District 1. John was working as a machinist. In the 1930 census he was a watchman in a factory, described as a widower, married for 26 years. His year of birth had been restored to 1869. In the 1940 census he and his brother Edward were still lodging together. The death of a John Mordaunt, aged 75 years and therefore born abt. 1869, on May 31st 1897 was recorded in Kings\n\nEdward Mordaunt (October 1, 1875 - August 13th 1943?) was born in New York. He was baptised on June 28, 1871. The transcription reproduced on www.ancestry.com gives his birthdate at October 1, without a year, but it seems unlikely his parents waited nine months to baptise him. With a year of birth given of 1875, he is listed in the 1920 census boarding with his brother John in Brooklyn District 1. Edward was working as a labourer. In the 1930 census he was a rubber worker in a factory, described as unmarried. His year of birth had been restored to 1871. In the 1940 census he and his brother John were still lodging together. The death of an Edward Mordaunt, aged 73 years and therefore born abt. 1870, on November 27th 1943 recorded in Kings\n\nJoseph Mordaunt (January 18, 1873 - ?) was baptised on February 7, 1873. He does not seem to have survived until the 1880 censsus\n\nMary L. Mordaunt (November 4, 1875 - ?) was born in New York and baptised 14th February, 1876. A Charlotte Mordaunt, presumably her sister, or maybe an otherwise unrecorded aunt, was a godparent\n\nMary Mordaunt (abt 1825 - ?), born in Ireland, was living in New York Ward 21, District 5 working as a dress maker in the 1860 census. She was staying with a Margaret Cushing and her children. Could she have been a sister? Was she a sister of John, just below, living in the same ward and district?\n\nJohn Mordaunt (abt 1828 - ?), born in Ireland, was working as a mason living in New York Ward 21, District 5 in the 1860 census,his age given as 30 years, with his wife Cathrine (sic) (abt. 1835 - ?), also born in Ireland, her age given as 25 years. A Jn. Mordaunt arrived in New York aboard the Emerald on May 25th, 1852, aged 25 years, having boarded the ship in Wexford. Probably not the same one as his daughter was born in Massachusetts in 1850\n\nMargaret A. Mordaunt (abt 1850 - ?) was born in Massachusetts.\n\nCatherine E. Mordaunt (abt 1857 - ?) was born in New York\n\nI am grateful to my correspondant, Margaret Campion, who kindly contacted me in May 2022 with a lot of general information requiring more research and some additional information on John Mordaunt and his wife, Cathrine. She informed ne they are listed in the 1875 New York census, both aged 30 years(!) and then again in a 1892 census where they are both aged 51 years(!) and John is recorded as a merchant.\n\nGeorge Mordaunt (abt. 1830 - ?), born in Ireland, was living in New York Ward 7, District 5 in the 1860 census, with his wife Ann (abt. 1835 - ?) also born in Ireland. He is described as a liquor store owner with personal assets of $1,000. They all reappear in the 1870 census, having moved to Brooklyn Ward 10, Kings, where he is described as a bar keeper.\n\nJames Mordaunt (abt 1852 - ?) was born in Ireland. In 1870 he was an apprentice plasterer.\n\nEmma Mordaunt (abt 1854 - ?) was born in New York. In 870 she was an apprentice dressmaker.\n\nCharles Mordaunt (abt. 1830 - 1892?), born in Ireland, was living in New York Ward 7, District 8 in the 1870 census with his wife Jane (abt. 1832 - ?) also born in Ireland. He was described as a clerk. They do not appear in any later census. The death of a Charles Mordaunt was recorded in Manhattan on October 1st, 1892, aged given as 58 years. If they are the same person he is the best candidate I have found so far to be my own great grandfather's missing brother.\n\nPatrick Mordaunt (abt. 1830 - ?) and his wife Ann (abt. 1834 - ?), both from Ireland, were living in Oswego, NY, at the 1880 census. He was working in a (illegible) factory. They perhaps reached Oswego via Canada. The death of an Anne Mordaunt, aged 63 yrs and therefore born abt. 1835, widow of Partick Mordaunt, was registered in Rhode Island, January 5, 1899.\n\nEdward Mordaunt (abt. 1861 - ?). In the 1880 census he was living at home and working as a clerk in a store. Assuming it is the same person, his year of birth is given as 1867 in the 1900 census, by which time he had been married to Mary Culkin (abt 1867 - January 15, 1961) from about 1891 but they had no children. He was then in Syracuse working as a typesetter. In the 1910 census his year of birth had advanced to 1872 and that of Mary to 1875. In the 1920 census his year of birth had advanced a further 10 years to 1883, although unchivalrously, Mary's was still 1875! Her death announcement gave her year of birth as abt. 1864. They did not appear in the 1930 census and do not seem to have had any children. I presume Mary must be the Mary Mordaunt listed in the 1950 census, living with a brother, Walter Culkin. Her age this time given as 69 years, born about 1881!\n\nMary Ann Mordaunt (abt. 1863 - ?) was born in New York state\n\nEllen Mordaunt (abt. 1866 - ?) was born in New York state\n\nJames P. Mordaunt (abt. 1868 - before 1910?) was born in New York state. In the 1900 census he had married Elizabeth (abt. 1878 - 1963), also born in New York state, in about 1896 and he was still living in Oswego, Ward 5, described as a wiper(?) in a railroad engine house. James must have died before 1910 because the in the 1910 census, 'Lizzie,' described as Canadian Irish, was working as a servant to a family. She had been married 14 years and had had four children. Her son Joseph Elliott, as 'Elliott' appears in the 1910 census at the St. Francis Home for Orphans, Oswego. I have not found any mention of the other children at this time. Where were they, I wonder. She later married a ? Rowlands. As Elizabeth Mordaunt Rowlands, her death was recorded in The Post Standard newspaper of Syracuse, which states she had two grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.\n\nAnna T. Mordaunt (August 1897 - ?) was born in New York state. She married Herbert Wright (? - 1952).\n\nHelen E. Mordaunt (June 1899 - March 21 1968) was born in New York state. She married Stewart Butler (? - 1955).\n\nJoseph Elliot Mordaunt (1900 - 1976) appears in the 1910 census, at the St. Francis Home for Orphans, Oswego. He does not appear again until the 1930 census. He seems to have married Esther (abt 1904 - ?) in about 1926 and in the 1930 census was working as a salesman in a wholesale house. At the 1940 census he was working as a laborer in a paper works. His WWI draft card gives his birth month as April, his death record gives it as as September; did he exagerate his age in order to go to war? His wife Esther was a keen singer, joining in local choirs and was active in the Order of the Eastern Star. There were recorded in the 1950 census still in Oswego and with Joseph still a labourer in a paper factory.\n\nDorothy Irene Mordaunt (abt. 1927 - ?). She graduated from Albany State Teachers' College and taught English at Oswego High School. She was still at home for the 1950 census. She married Dr. Samuel A Fichera at St Mary's Catholic Church on 29th August 1953.\n\nJames T. Mordaunt (abt 1928 - ?). He was recorded in the 1940 census, although because of the enumerator's mistake appears on a different page from his parents and sister! He was still at home for the 1950 census. He married Dorothy Raby in July 1951\n\nTimothy J. Mordaunt (b. 1952 - 2022) married Gail Patricia Lambert in First Presbyterian Church, Marcellus, on August 7, 1974\n\nJohn C. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1955)\n\nJean F. Mordaunt (b. ?). She married James W. Memper\n\nRosemarie Mordaunt (b. ?)\n\nDaniel J. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1964)\n\nThomas R. Mordaunt (b. February 10, 1966)\n\nJames Mordaunt (1903 - 1980) is possibly the James S. F. Mordant (sic) listed in the 1930 census in Syracuse, working as a baker and married to Laura L. (abt 1903 - ?) and the James Mordaunt listed in the Social Security Death List as living/dying in Oswego.\n\nJohn P. Mordaunt (abt. 1915 - 5th May 1936). The only record I have found for him is the newspaper announcement of his death. The announcement gave his age as 21 years which means he was born after the 1910 census when his mother was a living-in servant with a private family, her children were scattered and James P. Mordaunt was nowhere to be seen.\n\nJohn Mordaunt (abt. 1817 - ?) is listed in a transcriptions of an 1851/52 Canadian census, having arrived around 1846, born in Ireland and living in Sheffield, Addington County, Canada West (now Ontario?). His wife was Ann (abt. 1812 - ?), a few years his senior and also from Ireland\n\nKatherine Mordaunt (1841 - ?) was born in Ireland. In the 1901 Canadian census, a Catherine Mordaunt, unmarried, born 1841, was lodging with the Paul family in Newburg (Village), Addington, Ontario. She was not listed in the 1911 census.\n\nJames Mordaunt (October 12th, 1843 - 1st December 1920, with thanks to his great great grandaughter, Theresa, see below) was born in Ireland. He had moved on to Spalding, Menominee, MI, with his English born second wife, Hannah, by the time of the 1880 census via Canada and Illinois. He was described as a laborer and on that work raised a large family. I am grateful to his great great grandson, William Mordaunt, for filling in many gaps with family information from John's son Charles and from railway records at the Minnesota History Center. John had married 1. Mary Catherine Kenny (abt.1842/3/4 - ?) who was also Irish, or perhaps Canadian of Irish descent, in about 1862. He married 2. Hannah Brown (abt. 1846 - before 1898) in about 1874 according to the Latter Day Saints IGI, not authenticated by any source. None of these sources make it clear when Mary died and who was the mother of which child.\n\nth\n\nJohn Mordaunt (1864 - 1945) was born in Canada according to the 1880 census, but in Illinois according to the 1900 census (Page 1 and page 2). As the California death records give his younger brother's mother as Mary Kenny, so she must have been his too. In the 1880 census, he too was a laborer. In October 1887 he married Anne Miller (May 1869 - 1949), born in Wisconsin. In the 1900 census and still in the 1930 census, he was working as a railroad conductor. I have not found him in the 1920 census. He and his wife, recorded as Anna, were listed in the 1940 census in St. Paul. Minnesota.\n\nRoy Joseph Mordaunt (January 1888 - August 31, 1954) was born in Wisconsin. He qualified as a lawyer and in the 1920 census was in practise in St Paul Ward 5, Minnesota. He was a founder member of the Association of Insurance Attorneys which, curiously, evolved into the Association of Defense Trial Attorneys (see pages 2 & 3 of this link). He married Ethel W. (abt. 1893 - ?) from Minnesota in 1916. He and his family also appears in the 1930 census (Page 1 and page 2). In the 1940 census, all the children were recorded at home apparently unemployed. In the 1950 census, all but the youngest had left home. His death was recorded in Hennepin.\n\nJohn H. Mordaunt (November 17th 1917 - October 1971) born in Minnesota. I presume he was the John H Mordaunt listed in the 1950 census, following hs father as a lawyer, with a wife, Dorothy R, and two children, living in Minneapolis.\n\nAnother John H. Mordaunt (b.abt. 1949)\n\nWilliam . Mordaunt (b. 1950)\n\nKatherine Mordaunt (abt 1919 - ?) born in Minnesota.\n\nRoy Joseph Mordaunt (March 23rd 1921 - April 8th 1989) born in Minnesota. Military records show he was a T/Sergeant in WWII and is buried in Ft. Snelling National Cemetery, MN. He married Sally N. but they were divorced in 1979. He then married Elizabeth (Beth) Krocness (abt. 1934 - December 19, 2008) in 1981.\n\nRobert William Mordaunt (December 29th 1923 - March 8th 1990) born in Minnesota. Military records show he was an Army captain in WWII. By the 1950 census he had maried Rosemary (born abt. 1925). He was working for an oil company in Portland, Oregon and she was described as a tax expert. He is buried in the Riverside National Cemetry in California.\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (January 20th 1930 - January 4th 1995) born in Minnesota. He died in La Quinta, Riverside, California.\n\nWalter J. Mordaunt (August 1893 - ?) was born in St Paul, Minnesota. He does not seem to have done as well as his elder brother. In the 1920 census he was working worked as a brakeman on the railroad and in the 1930 census was renting a house at $45 a month while his brother owned a $10,000 house! Walter married Esther (August 4th 1893 - December 1967). They were recorded again in the 1940 census and the 1950 census.\n\nunnamed Mordaunt (1915 - 1915), born in St Paul. Recorded in a FamilySearch transcription, the father is mistranscribed at Wm. J. Mordaunt\n\nJane Marie Mordaunt (1916 - ?) was recorded in the 1940 census as a patient in the Harriet Walker Hospital, Minneapolis. She was working as a cook in a private household.\n\nAlice Gail(Gale) Mordaunt (abt 1925 - ?)\n\nMildred Mae Mordaunt (May 9th 1897 - ?), born in St Paul, Minnesota (Massachusetts according to the 1910 census).\n\nJames Mordaunt (1866 - 1947) was born in Canada according to the 1880 census, but in Illinois according to the 1900 census. The California Death Index transcribed on www.ancestry.com states he was the son of John's first wife, Mary Kenny. In 1900 he was living in Sioux City, Iowa, with his New York state wife, Mary E. Lavalle (1871 - 1948). Staying with them was his younger brother, Charles. By the 1910 census, the family had moved to Ogden, Utah, and were still there for the 1920 census. In the 1930 census, when he was working for the railroad as a freight conductor, he and Mary had with them an otherwise, by me, unidentified 12 year-old granddaughter, Elinor. By the 1940 census he and his Mary had retired to Los Angeles where his death was recorded. His obituary notice in the Ogden Standard Examiner states he died of \"ailments incident to his age.\" He had retired as a railroad conductor with the Union pacific at 70/71 years of age. He outlived all his siblings except his brother Harry and sister Mary, survived by seven grandchildren and 3 great grandchildren.\n\nVernon James Mordaunt (abt. 1896 - ?) was born in Wisconsin. He married Josephine Whittaker Rollins (November 28th 1899 - September 5th 1969) on October 4th, 1921, and in the 1930 census was a brakeman on the railroad. He owned his home valued at $3,300 in Ogden, Weber, Utah. In 1945, Josephine divorced him, citing cruelty. However, it seems she was back with him, or he had married a second Josephine, by the 1950 census.\n\nVernon Rollins Mordaunt (December 1922 - February 16, 2002). He enlisted in the Coast Guard on September 27, 1941. He married Doreen Moore. Among any other children he had four daughters, not necessarily listed here in the right order. At some time or other the family seem to have become Mormons, as the daughters all seem to have married in Mormon Temples. I suspect this would have greatly upset their staunchly Catholic grandparents. In the 1950 census Veron does not seem to have employment and Doreen was working as a nurse.\n\nCheryl Mordaunt (b. abt. 1949) whose marriage to Gary Gilgen was announced in the Ogden Standard Advertisier in 1969.\n\nBrian David Mordaunt (b. 1950). He married Pamela Tooker.\n\nCama Christine Mordaunt (b. abt. 1967) who married John William Thomas\n\nCade V. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1973)\n\nChandra D. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1976)\n\nBryan Mordaunt\n\nKathryn Mordaunt (b. 1952). She married Robert D. Jones at the end of November 1973\n\nLeanne Mordaunt (b. abt. 1956) married David Earl Socwell in May 1975 at the Logan LDS Temple.\n\nLynette Mordaunt (b. abt. 1958) served as bridesmaid/maid of honour at all her sister's weddings\n\nPatricia Mordaunt (abt. 1925 - ?). She married a Mr. L. R. Rothey\n\nJoyce Mordaunt (1926 - ?). She married Grant H. Way.\n\nJerrold Lavell Mordaunt (July 3, 1931 - August 19, 1984) was born in Ogden, Weber, Utah. By a strange coincidence, a story was syndicated through several US newspapers in 1934/1935 with a character, Sir Jerrold Mordaunt. The Ogden Standard Advertiser reported in 1949 his arrest for reckless driving, aged 18 year - $50 fine or 25 days in jail! He clearly did not learn his lesson. In 1959, now aged 28 and a student at Stanford, the San Mateo Times records a 2 a.m., 20 minute, 100 mph chase through two counties pursued by 10 police cars, which ended in his being arrested at gun-point. In fairness - he was the passenger. Notwithstanding, he obtained a Ph.d. in Spanish language and literature from Stanford University and was a member of the faculty of the University of Victoria, British Columbia. He married Barbara Westinghouse of Sydney, British Columbia, on May 25, 1968. His death was recorded in View Royal, British Columbia, Canada.\n\nKlea Faustine Mordaunt (b. July 30th 1934)\n\nIrene Mordaunt (abt. 1898 - ?) was born in Wisconsin. I have found no mention of her after the 1910 census, when she was 12 years-old. I speculate that, perhaps, she was the mother of her parent's granddaughter mentioned in the 1930 census. Incidently, the brother and sister, Vernon and Irene, were named before the famous dancing Castles had even met!\n\nEdward Mordaunt (1867 - ?) was born in Illinois. He does not appear on any census and presumably died as a baby.\n\nWilliam Mordaunt (1869 - 1938 was born in Chigaco IL. He is probably the William Mordant (sic) lodging in Shoshone, Idaho County, in the 1910 census. There appears to be no census record of his having been married not to have married in or after 1910 and returns to the census records apparently comfortable enough in 1930 in his $1,600 home in Township 68, St Louis, MN.\n\nMary Ellen Mordaunt (1872 - 1873?)\n\nMichael Joseph Mordaunt (1873 - 1947) was born in Chicago, IL, according to the censuses. He was a veteran of the Spanish American War, 1898 in 26 Company, 34th Regiment of Michigan. In the 1900 census he was described as a day laborer, boarding with his brothers Henry and Thomas (although Thomas was still at school) in Bessemer, Gogebic. He married Amelia DeGrave (abt. 1880 - 1923). He was recorded as an odd-job labourer in the 1910 census, living two doors down from his grandfather, James, in Ironwood, Gogebic. He was drafted for WWI. Both are buried in Riverside Cemetary, Ironwood, MI. In a Gogebic range City Directory of 1928 he was listed as 'Mike' and was a 'timber framer' at 326 Houk Street\n\nLaura B. Mordaunt (abt. 1906 - ?) who married Harold Garvey in 1930. In the Gogebic range City Directory of 1928 she was described as a bookkeeper working at home\n\nMelvin J. Mordaunt (May 14, 1909 - March 12th 1998). In the Gogebic range City Directory of 1928 he was still a student. He appears in the 1950 census, listed as a \"roomer\" which I take to mean the same as a border or lodger, working as a plumber in Gogebic. He did not wander far - he died in Ironwood, Gogebic, Michigan\n\nGeorge Thomas Mordaunt (October 15, 1875 - October 18, 1934) was born in Michigan. He married Grace McKeen in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, on August 19, 1902, but she never appeared with him afterwards in any census. In the 1910 census census a Grace Mordaunt, presumably a widow or divorcee, who had remarried a Norwegian club house steward, ? Johnson, was listed in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, with two daughters.\n\nHelen Mordaunt (abt.1904 - ?) had been born in Wisconsin.\n\nAlice Mordaunt (abt.1906 - ?) had been born in Wisconsin\n\nIn the 1910 census George's age was given as 31 years, giving a birthdate of abt. 1879. He was described as single, working as a brakeman on the railroad, rooming in Minneapolis with a Sandy Mordaunt (abt. 1882 - ?), three years his junior. This suggests his brother Henry but, as they seem so vague on ages, it could equally be Thomas. His address was the Claranson Hotel, Duluth, on his World War 1 draft registration card when his brother Henry was given as his \"nearest relative.\" In the 1920 census he was a boarder in St. Paul, Minnesota. However, by the 1930 census he was living with his German born wife, Kathrine L (abt. 1877 - ?), still in St Paul. Hos widow Kathrine was listed in the 1940 census living with a daughter, presumably of a previous marriage, and a son-in-law.\n\nHenry (Harry) Peter Mordaunt (February 28, 1877 - May 23, 1953) was born in Spalding, Michigan. He was recorded in the 1900 census, working as a day laborer, boarding with his brothers Michael and Thomas in Bessemer, Gogebic. He is possibly the Sandy Mordaunt lodging with his brother George in Minneapolis in the 1910 census, although he is described as single when by then he was married. Like his brother George he seems to have had initial marriage problems; a 1909 Minneapolis, Minnesota, directory lists a Julia Mordaunt, widow of Harry P. Mordaunt, living at 517 10th Avenue S. Perhaps calling yourself a widow was the equivalent of a speedy divorce. Whatever, Henry married Michigan born Jennie Desormey (1879 - 1961) in Austin, Mower, Minnesota, in 1910, and I presume she is the J. H. Mordaunt, married one month, lodging alone elsewhere in Minneapolis in the 1910 census. He was drafted for World War 1 from Austin, Mower. They were listed together in the 1920 census and the 1930 census. I seem to have missed them in the 1940 census but they were together in Mankato, Blue Earth, Minnesota, in the 1950 census. Jennie's death was recorded in Los Angeles.\n\nLloyd Desormey Mordaunt (May 5, 1911 - January 13, 2003) was born in Minnesota. In the 1930 census he was living at his parent's home with a wife, Lenora (abt 1920 - ?). What happened to Lenora I do not know but in the 1940 census he was in Los Angeles, described as single and working as a file clerk. In the 1950 census he was Los Angeles living with his son, David, working as an accountant for a wholesale milk firm.. He later married Oma Lucille Boyd Brittain (1911 - 1996), in Las Vegas on May 15, 1950. They died in Saint George, Washington, Utah\n\nI am grateful to my correspondent Theresa Mordaunt, from Washington State, who kindly wrote to me about her own research and provided more information about her family. She told me that Lloyd had one son\n\nDavid Duane Mordaunt (abt. 1931 - ?). Born in Minnesota. He was living with his father in the 1950 census working as an apprentice \"pressman.\" He was to have at least one daughter\n\nTheresa Mordaunt, my correspondent\n\nLeonard Joseph Mordaunt (March 16, 1913 - February 2, 1995) was born in Minnesota. He married Harriet Desales Dunlap in Austin, Mower, Minnnesota, on September 7, 1935. He died in San Marcos, San Diego, California.\n\nSusan Marie Mordaunt (1937 - ?) was born in Charlotte, Meckleberg County, NC.\n\nLynne Josette Mordaunt (May 21 1941 - ?) was born in Minnesota\n\nThomas Michael Mordaunt (August 29 1942 - ?) was born in Minnesota. He married Jean Claire (abt 1942 - ?)\n\nMichelle L. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1965)\n\nGregory M. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1967)\n\nDenise M. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1972).\n\nKristina Mary Mordaunt (April 11 1952 - ?) was born in Texas\n\nMary E. Mordaunt (abt. 1878 - ?) was born in Michigan. In the 1900 census she appears boarding in Duluth Ward 6, Saint Louis, Minnesota, working as a dry goods saleslady. She married Leo MacDonald\n\nCharles Franklin Mordaunt (10 March 1879 - January 19th 1947) was born in Ironwood, Michigan. In the 1900 census he is with his brother James in Sioux City, Iowa. He was drafted for World War 1 in September 1917. He does not seem to have married and died in Kankakee County, Illinois. I have not found him in any census after 1900 but he may be the Charles Mordaunt listed in Chicago in the 1940 census, although the age given is five years out. If it is not he I have no idea who it might be.\n\nFrank Mordaunt (August 20th 1882 - ?). Not recorded on any census, he presumably died young.\n\nThomas James Mordaunt (12th October 1884 - ?). He was recorded in the 1900 census boarding with his brothers Michael and Henry in Bessemer, Gogebic, although he was still at school. Perhaps they moved out of the family home when his father remarried and his young step-family moved into the house. I have not found any mention of him in later census unless he was the Sandy Mordaunt rooming with his brother George in Minneapolis in the 1910 census, which is the less likely option. He was described as a storageman working for a storage company in his World War 1 draft registration card. I have not identified him in later censuses.\n\nHaving born perhaps ten children in twenty years, Hannah died, probably from exhaustion, and on 24th May 1898, John married Johanna Balduc (abt. 1867 - before 1930?), a widow? née Sullivan from Michigan of Irish parents. They were recorded in Gogebic in the 1900 census with four of her children from her previous marriage. In the 1910 census they were living in Ironwood Ward 6, Gogebic, MI, with her three youngest children, listed under the name Mordaunt. Johanna was recorded as a widow in the 1920 census, living with one of her daughters. She was not recorded in the 1930 census.\n\nMichael Mordaunt (1845 - ?) was born in Ireland\n\nAnn Mordaunt (1847 - ?) was born in Canada West. I think she was very probably the Anna Mordaunt of Canadian Irish Origin who married William Navin in upper New York State by 1880 according to her great great granddaughter, Laura Dean Miller, who kindly made contact with me. They had at least two children\n\nEdna J. Navin (b. abt. 1878) who was to marry an O'Connor\n\nHenry Navin (b. abt. 1870).\n\nLaura has not been able to find anything more about Anna.\n\nPeter Mordaunt (1849 - July 4, 1902) was born in Canada West. I think he was very probably the \"inmate\" in Rochester State Hospital, Ward 2, Minnesota, in the 1900 US census, and was then buried in Rochester State Hospital cemetery.\n\nJames Mordaunt (abt. 1844 - ?), born in New York State of Irish Parents, appears in the 1910 census in Cascades, Oregon.\n\nPatrick Mordaunt and his wife Cathrine are named in a familySearch transcription of Masssachusetts Deaths and Burials as the parents of\n\nCatherine F Mordaunt (1866 - June 8th 1897) who was born in Ireland, married a Daniel Ring and died in Boston.\n\nGeorge Mordaunt (dates unknown) is reported in the www.celticcousins.net webpage on the Chronology of Scott County, Iowa: \" March 6, 1877, George Mordaunt arrested for forgery on several parties in Davenport.\" www.celticcousins.net is a website intended to foster an interest in research of those Irish born persons who went to Iowa. I do not know if this is one of the Georges already listed on this page or whether it is a new one.\n\nMargaret Mordaunt (abt. 1879 - ?), a widow born in Ireland, was working as a maid for a family Boston in the 1940 census.\n\nCharles Mordaunt (24th May 1883 - 1935?) was drafted into the army for WWI in Manhattan where he was a barkeeper. Born in County Wexford, Ireland, he was my great uncle. He does not appear on any census. He was possibly the Charles Mordaunt whose death was listed in the Bronx on June 9th 1935, aged given as 51 years.\n\nMordaunts who entered from Canada\n\nHomer Mordaunt (abt. 1874 - ?) had crossed the border from Canada into North Dakota in 1897. He had presumably already previously met and married local girl, Mary (abt. 1878 - ?), and they were living with their own farm in in Pembina according to the 1900 census. I cannot trace them after 1900.\n\nGeorge Mordaunt (abt. 1896 - ?) had been born in North Dakota.\n\nJohn Mordaunt and his wife Sary/Sarah Ewer (daughter of Roger Ewer and Sarah Stiles?), part of the Mordaunts of the Hill branch of the family described in greater detail on the Tudors and Stuarts webpage, married at Saint Olave, Southwark, London, on October 18, 1719, were recorded in 1720 as the parents at the christening of a son at St. Bartholomew Exchange:\n\nJohn Stiles Mordaunt (1719/20 - 1781). His prolific family may be followed on the pages of The Mordaunts in London page\n\nGeorge Mordaunt (abt 1753 - 13th January 1834) was the third of his surviving children.\n\nWilliam Henry Mordaunt (abt 1806 - 45) was his twelth child out of fourteen, or maybe even sixteen.\n\nAlfred Edwin Mordaunt (17th April 1840 - before 1881), the fourth child of six, was born in St Pancras, London and christened 15th May 1840. Mentioned in the 1841 Scottish census, he was not mentioned with the family in the 1851 English census. He tried a career at sea and obtained his certificate as a second mate in 1862. Perhaps that is what took him west, to Canada, while others of his family were going south, to Africa. In Canada he married Sarah McAuley (abt. 1851 - 29th December 1882) on 2nd July 1869 at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Victoria. He seems to have died before the 1881 Canadian census by which time Sarah was apparently a widow and is described as born in British Columbia of Scottish extraction and a Reformed Episcopal church member listed at Johnson Street Ward, Victoria. She was listed in a British Columbia directory in 1882 as a dressmaker but died the same year leaving her young family, one hopes, in the care of her parents.\n\nAda Mordaunt (abt. 1871 - ?)\n\nHenry G. Mordaunt (29th November, 1872 - ?), also known as Harry, moved down from British Columbia to the US. He married Utah born Alice August Cripps on September 14, 1898, in Tooele, Utah. In the 1900 census he was described as a gold miner, living in Cherry Creek, White Pines, Nevada. They divorced and Alice married a William Blackwell about 1902 and by the 1910 census she and her daughter Violet were in Duckwater, Nevada.\n\nViolet M. Mordaunt (August 1899 - ?) was born in Nevada.\n\nAfter his divorce, Henry married Margaret Curtain (? - 1910) and they had a son\n\nWalter George Mordaunt (b. 1908 - ?) was born in Washington State according to the 1920 census I am very grateful to James Rosenval who wrote to me in June 2020, correcting my errors and providing additional information. He informed me that, on his mother's death, Walter was placed in the long-term care of Ingeborg Melin Peterson, (1865 - 1947) born in Sweden. For the sake of propriety, Ingerborg changed her surname to Mordaunt and cared for Walter well into his adulthood. In the 1920 US census Ingeborg and Walter were living in Salt Lake City with Ingeborg's daughter from her first marriage, Lillie, married to a John Van Dorn. My correspondent, James, is the husband of Lillie's grandaughter. He said that Walter has always been known in the family as \"Uncle Walter.\" Walter appears in the 1950 census married to Lucy (born abt. 1919) and they had two children\n\nGloria E. Mordaunt (born abt. 1944) was born in Wisconsin\n\nPhilipe G. Mordaunt (born abt. 1949) was born in Wisconsin\n\nI am not at all sure of Henry´s fate. His 1918 WWI draft registration card states that he was from Euclid, Ohio. His son Walter, in Salt Lake City, is named as his next of kin.\n\nPercy Mordaunt (abt. 1875 - ?)\n\nEllen Mordaunt (abt. 1877 - ?)\n\nCurtis Mordaunt (January 1871 - ?) born in Wisconsin, as was his wife Bessie (September 1870 - ?), was recorded in the 1900 census living in New London, Waupaca, Wisconsin, working as a real estate salesman. Both their parents were described as Canadian. I have found no further reference to the family.\n\nMargretta Mordaunt (abt. 1897 - ?) was born in Wisconsin.\n\nRobert G. Mordaunt (abt. 1900 - ?) was born in Wisconsin.\n\nPhyllis Mordaunt (August 1878 - ?), born in British Columbia of English parents, was lodging in Manhattan in the 1900 census. She had arrived in the US about 1896 and was described as a married, with one child not accompanying her, working as an actress.\n\nEdward F Mordaunt (September 20, 1857 - October5, 1918) was, according to the entry in the 1910 census, of French Canadian extraction with a mother from Ohio! He was recorded with his wife Flora, (abt. 1867 - ?) from Indiana, as having no employment, living in Denver, Ward 11, Colorado. They disappear from the records census again after 1910 but he was listed in a 1913 Denver, Colorado, city directory at 3291 Quitman(?). He was buried in Wheat Ridge, Jefferson County.\n\nMordaunts born in the US of uncertain origin\n\nHiram Mordaunt (abt. 1825 - ?), born in Maine, was a seaman recorded for one time only, in Hancock, ME, in the 1850 census. Clearly his parents arrived in the colonies earlier than 1825. I have not found further reference to him. Where did the name Hiram come from? There was a Hiram Mordaunt in Staffordshire in England who died in 1800. Families, then even more so than now, liked to perpetuate \"family\" names in their children. Perhaps this Hiram from Maine came from the Staffordshire family.\n\nCharles M. Mordaunt (abt. 1828 - ?), born in Massachusetts, was a cordwainer living in Lynn, Essex, MA, in the 1850 census. Clearly his parents arrived in the colonies earlier than 1828. I have not found further reference to him.\n\nEarly information on the following family on the Internet (www.onegreatfamily.com IGI list) comes from submissions by individual members of the Church of Latter Day Saints and as a result it is unsubstantiated, contradictory and unreliable. I think that, in their enthusiasm to impart information, they do not check their facts.\n\nBelle Mordaunt, who so far I have not otherwise been able to identify, was, according to Grant Keller, the mother of\n\nCharles Edward Lowe Mordaunt (1835 - 1906) who was born in Maryland, Baltimore according to his son Carlos Eduardo's passport application. He apparently qualified as a physician. According to his great great grandson Grant Keller who kindly made contact with me, he left the United States for Central America after the American Civil War and started a new life as Carlos Eduardo Lowe de Mordaunt. As such, in 1859 he married Maria Josefa Marroquin in Qzltngo, Guatemala, wherever that is and however it is pronounced, according to LDS Church informants. Some LDS Church informants give her name as Maria De Los Reyes Marroquin and others as Maria Francisca Marroquin. One LDS Church informant even states they married in San José, Santa Clara, California in 1865 or 1866.\n\nHe seems to have set up or acquired a coffee plantation and export business. The family split between the plantation in Chiapas, Mexico, and the import business in California and there was clearly regular movement between the two by ship. By 1894 he was resident in San José where the 1894 California voter register gives a complete physical description; 5ft 9 ins tall, light complexion, gray eyes, gray hair.\n\nA Josepha(?) Mordaunt (abt. 1852 - ?) is listed in the 1900 US census in San José, California. It gives her age as 43 years, that she had been married 26 years and had had eight children, seven of whom were still alive. This is confusing as various sources list in total eight children who seem to have survived beyond the 1900 US census. Her father had been French. Charles/Carlos was absent from the 1900 US census but is listed in a ship passenger list in 1904, his age given as 90 years! By a 1909 voyage Josepha, now Josephine, was a widow. In the 1910 US census she apparently aged fourteen years since the last census ten years before and was now of a Spanish father. She and her youngest daughter Josephine were lodging together. They took another trip in 1913 with her son Robert Leon and in 1916.\n\nCarlos Eduardo Mordaunt (September 27, 1874 - 27 December 1943) was born in San Felipe, Guatemala. The 1896 California voter register gives a complete physical description; 5ft 5.5 ins tall, dark complexion, brown eyes, black hair. He had been naturalised as a US citizen in 1882. He is recorded in the 1910 US census with Californian wife of 10 years, Ethelyn L. Brown (abt.1875 - ?) and was living in Palo Alto, Santa Clara. The family clearly kept close links with their Mexican/Guatemalan kin; In May 1904, Carlos was listed as a passenger between Panama and California and, in December 1904, Ethelyn was recorded with her son Melrose and sister-in-law, Belle Mordaunt, returning from Tapachula to San Jose. Carlos again was listed as a passenger in 1906, this time with his brother, Robert. Further voyages were recorded in 1909 and 1919. In Mexico, Carlos was a planter, in California he was the proprietor of a tea and coffee store. At some time they moved to San Francisco. He applied to renew(?) his passport in 1920. They were recorded in the 1920 US census and the 1930 US census. The California voter registration lists suggest that Ethelyn died before 1936 and that Carlos later married a teacher Mary. He was described in the voter list of 1942 as an exporter.\n\nMelrose Mordaunt (January 20, 1901 - January 13, 1990) is recorded as born in California. At home and not working at the 1920 census, in the 1930 census he was listed both at home and living in Burbank, LA with his uncle/aunt Edward and Vivienne Lowe, working as a machinist in an \"oil engine\" factory. He married Jessie Colbourn (1908 - ?) in Yuma, Arizona, on October 21, 1935, and they had had their first child by the 1940 US census. They were listed in the California voter register in 1942 at different addresses but were back together in 1946. In the 1950 census all the family were together, including Jessie's mother. He was working as a mechanic. His grandson Geoffrey Mordaunt from Seattle said \"Hi\" in my Guest Book on September 24th 2009, before it shut down.\n\nMel Edward Mordaunt (b. June 27, 1937) was born in Los Angeles. He married Mary E. Lombardi in 1960. I am not sure what happened in the middle, but he was divorced from Virginia L. in 1979.\n\nLynne Mordaunt (b. April 9, 1940) was born in Los Angeles. She married Said M. Nissar in 1967.\n\nRaymond Mordaunt (b. May 15, 1948) was born in Los Angeles. He married Susan R. Pendley in 1969 and they divorced in 1977.\n\nClyfton Mordaunt (March 23, 1905 - October 14, 1975) is recorded as born in California. A 1922 San Franciso city directory describes him as a clerk working for Wm Fisher & Co, and living with his parents at 1038 Balboa. In the 1930 US census he was still doing clerical work in an office. He was recorded in the 1940 census. aged 35, single, living in San Francisco in a large lodging house, working as a court reporter for a law firm. In the 1950 census he was employed as a court transcriber.\n\nRuth Mordaunt (May 10, 1910 - 1986) is recorded as born in California. In the 1930 US census she was described as a designer at a public school. Later she possibly married a ? Gill.\n\nFederico Guillermo Mordaunt (abt. 1875 - ?). According to an LDS Church informant, he was born in San José, Santa Clara, California - unlikely. A Frederico Mordant (sic) was recorded in the 1930 Mexico Census, unmarried, wroking in agriculture, American citizen, born in San Francisco, English speaking, a protestant in a census page of Catholics, age given as 55 years, (therefore born abt. 1875), living/working in La Estrella, Huehuetán, Chiapas\n\nMaria Josefa Mordaunt (abt. 1879 - ?). An LDS Church informant on www.familysearch.com has a Maria Mordaunt marrying Eduardo Quiñónez in about 1890 in Qzltngo, Guatemala, and then lists six little Quiñónez Mordaunts.\n\nRoberto Leon Mordaunt (abt. 1880 - ?). He is recorded on several sailings between southern Mexico and California with his mother or brother. In voyages in 1906 and 1925 he was described as a dentist. In a voyage in 1913 he was described as a coffee planter. I presume the Isabel Mordaunt accompanying him in 1925 was his sister Belle.\n\nLouis G Mordaunt (1882 - January 6, 1924) is recorded as born in Mexico. In the 1900 US census he was living with the family in San José. His death from smallpox in the Eureka Coffee Plantation, District of Tapachula, Mexico was reported, because he was a US citizen, by the US Consul in Salinacruz. His known relatives were given as his sister 'Josephine' and his brother 'Carlos E.' An LDS Church informant submitted a Luis Jorgé Mordaunt born in San José, Santa Clara, California, in 1874.\n\nBelle (Isabel?) Mordaunt ( 1884 - ?) is recorded as born in Mexico. In the 1900 US census she was living with the family in San José. In the 1910 US census she is listed as living alone, still in San José, taking in two lodgers. In the 1920 US census she was in San Francisco, staying with an uncle, Albert Lowe. She is listed on several voyages between Chiapas and California with other members of her family and I presume she was the Isabel Mordaunt, unmarried lady, sailing with Robert Leon on a voyage in 1925, when she was described as a milliner.\n\nGrant Albert Mordaunt ( 1885 - ?) is recorded as born in Chiapas. He and his family are recorded in the 1930 Mexican census. He had married an American, Gertrude M. Plummer (November 7, 1885 - December 13, 1973), and was described as a farmer, first language, English. While his brother Frederico, above, had been described as a protestant, Grant and his family were listed as Catholics. According to his grandson, Grant, he owned a coffee plantation. Gertrude is listed with her children on a voyage between Santa Cruz and San Francisco in 1921. I am grateful to Grant senior's granddaughter Jackie for information about his family, who lived in Unión Juárez, Chiapas, Mexico, and also to his grandson, Grant, for still further information.\n\nGrant Albert Mordaunt jr (October 31, 1909 - ?). His is the one land border crossing, between Mexico and Laredo, Texas, recorded on www.ancestry.com, on October 13, 1945, visiting an aunt. The copy on the website is so bad I have not bothered to copy it. He is listed in the 1950 census, living alone as a boarder, working as a clerk in Bexar, San Antonio, Texas.\n\nAnita Mordaunt (March 5, 1911 - ?). Living at 21 500 South Westmoreland Avenue, LA, she married Ernest C. Goldsworthy in 1937/38. She was one of only two relatives named in the newspaper announcement of the death of her aunt Josephine.\n\nEduardo Jose (Edward) Mordaunt (May 24, 1917 - 1980)\n\nJackie Mordaunt (b. 1976)\n\nOliver Mordaunt (? - ?) I have found no record of him and, presumably, he died young.\n\nYvonne Jose Mordaunt (December 19, 1920 - July 27, 2003?) was born in Tapachula, Chiapas, Mexico. She married Theodore Elgin Keller. She died in Castro Valley, Alameda, California. (with thanks to Kohut family tree on www.ancestry.com)\n\nGrant Elgin Keller (b. 1948) was born in Los Angeles.\n\nJeannine Keller (b. 1950) was born in Los Angeles.\n\nDonald Edward Keller (b. 1952) was born in Los Angeles.\n\nJosephine P. Mordaunt (1887 - 1944) is recorded as born in Mexico. In the 1900 US census she was living with the family in San José. In the 1910 US census she and her mother were lodging together. She did not marry. The traditional task of the youngest daughter - looking after the aging mother - seems to have fallen to her. Her last recorded voyage on www.ancestry.com, between Champerico, Guatemala, and California, possibly with a Quiñónez niece and nephew, was in 1929. The newspaper announcement of her death listed as relatives her niece, Anita Goldsworthy, and a cousin, Mabel Carper.\n\nAdelia Mordaunt (abt 1841 - ?) born in Texas, was living in Hamilton, White Pine, Nevada, at the time of the 1870 census.\n\nKittie Mordaunt (abt 1868 - ?) who was born in California. The transcript in www.ancestry.com lists Kettie as \"black\" but this has been miscopied from the original document.\n\nJames Mordant (abt 1841 - ?) and his wife Margaret were the parents of\n\nMargaret Mordaunt (? - ?) who married Michael McCarthy on January 1, 1857, in Trenton, New Jersey.\n\nEmory Mordaunt (abt. 1848 - ?), born in Maine, was a 12 year old farm laborer for Temperance and Joseph Knowles in Manchester, Kennebec, ME, according to the 1860 census. All the listed workers on this farm were children, the youngest 6 years old! Clearly his parents arrived in the colonies earlier than 1848. I have not found further reference to him after the 1850 census.\n\nStewart Mordaunt (abt. 1852 - ?), born in Kentucky, was recorded in the 1880 census prospecting in Silver Cliff, Custer, CO.\n\nAlfred Mordaunt (June 1860 - ?) from New York State was a \"roomer\" in a hotel in Port Townsend Ward 2, Jefferson, Washington. He is recorded in the 1900 census as born in New York of a Pennsylvania father and Massachusets mother, married for 12 years and working as a gold miner.\n\nFrederick Stewart Mordaunt (abt. 1861/3 - before 1930) appears in the 1910 census, described as born in Georgia (the only Mordaunt listed anywhere as being so) of a New York father and a German mother, working as a publisher living in Chicago, Ward 6. By the 1920 census he was born in Missippi of French parents working as a stock broker in North Tarrytown, Westchester, New York. He seems to have married a wife, Maria, and in 1889 they had a son Theodore B. Mordaunt (1889 - 1889), born in Indianapolis, died in Boston. An unnamed Mordaunt(1890) and a Frederick S. Mordaunt (1899) were buried in Indianapolis, presumably also their children. Later records name his wife as Lillian (b. 1880 or 1886 - ?), born in Chicago, Il., of French parents.\n\nI am very grateful to Christina Nalen, Frederick's great granddaughter, for contacting me with additional information she had found out about her family. She explained that she had found that her great grandmother was named Lilian Marie Morency.\n\nBy the 1930 census, Lillian was a widow, back in Chicago, working as a barber. Living with Lillian in 1930, as well as her one son, was her mother Zelia Swanson, aged 62 years. In the 1940 census she was living with her son Theodore and his wife.\n\nTheodore Morency Mordaunt (1914 - 1987) was born in Chicago. By the 1940 census, aged 26 years, he had married Dorothea Brode (abt. 1914 - 1990) and was an office manager in a refactory (wharever that was) in Chicago. They appeared in the 1950 census, page 1 and page 2,with his mother and now with three sons. Both died in Fort Wales, Fl.\n\nunnamed Mordaunt. (b. and d. August 3, 1939) is recorded in a FamilySearch transcription.\n\nTheodore M. Mordaunt Jr.(b. abt. 1942). He signed the visitor's book of the parish church in Turvey, Bedfordshire, UK, ancestral home of the Mordaunts, in early October 2012.\n\nWilliam S. Mordaunt (b. abt. 1943).\n\nRichard L. Mordaunt (b. abt, 1947).\n\nA Theodore M. Mordaunt (how many of them could there have been?) married Jean M. Shea in California in 1941.\n\nTheodore Mordaunt (abt. 1875 - 1942) appears in the 1920 census with a wife, Madge Mordaunt (abt 1876 - ?). Both were from Illinois and lodging in Seattle. He was working as an engineer and she was a hotel housekeeper. In the 1940 census he was lodging alone in Pasadena, California, described as married but with no occupation recorded. I have not found him in a later census but the death of a Theodore Mordaunt was recorded in California in 1942. I presume she is the Madge Mordaunt in the 1950 census living in Pasadena.\n\nEdwin Mordaunt (abt 1869 - ?), born in Maryland, father from Maryland and mother from Georgia, appears in the 1920 census census in Manhatton with his own home working as an actor. He was married to Grace (abt. 1880 - ?) from Massachusetts. He had previously married a fellow actress, Virginia Stuart (abt. 1869 - January 22 1901), in 1898. Was he the Edwin Mordant who appeared in the classic movie \"The Bride of Frankenstein\"? He is recorded with the spelling Mordant in New York the 1930 census, working as a hotel manager, and in California in the 1940 census, when he and Grace were listed as actors. Grace, now 70 years old, was listed alone in the 1950 census, in Los Angeles. I suspect his name may be a stage name. Most other Mordaunt actors'/actress's names are.\n\n(Photo from University of Washington Library Digital Collection)\n\nGuy L. Mordaunt (abt 1871 - ?), born in Wisconsin, was rooming in Redding, Shasta, California at the 1910 census, described as living on his own income. He described his father as from Tennessee and his mother from Wisconsin. Another Mordaunt family that escaped the census recorders over many years! Another Guy Mordaunt (possibly the same?), appeared in the 1930 census (neither are in the 1920 census). Now he was born in Iowa in 1868, still unmarried, father from Illinois, mother still from Wisconsin. He was unemployed and a boarder in San Dimas, Los Angeles.\n\nWalter \"Hal\" Mordaunt (ant. 1872 - ?) gets his first mention in the 1910 census. He was recorded as born in California, in San Diego according to his first wife. He was living in Jacksonville Ward 4, Duval, Florida, with his wife Ethel Wynne Weatherly, born in Florida. His grandson Tom Mordaunt, webmaster of www.mordaunt.com, fills in the gaps. He was an actor in a number of different companies, including that of George M Cohan. His marriage to Ethel produced at least two children. \"Wendy\", Ethel's great granddaughter by a second marriage reports on the www.mordaunt.com website that they married on 15 April, 1906 in Houston,TX, when they were both touring with the Sydney Pollock Theatre Group and divorced in 1913 for unknown reasons. An interesting interview with Ethel, then Sherman, recorded in 1978, is published on this pdf link. His second appearence in a census seems to take place in the 1950 census, his age given as 81 years, living in Albany with a new wife, Margarite, from Canada, 27 years his junior.\n\nHal Mordaunt Jnr (2 April 1907 - 2000), living with his mother who had remarried in Florida in the 1930 census, is described by Tom Mordaunt as a prominent artist, known for his Floridascape paintings. In the 1930 census he was working as a bookkeeper for a produce company. He married Margerie Davis (abt. 1915 - ?) from New Jersey and in the 1940 census was in Coral Gables, Florida, having risen to office manager for a wholesale produce company (the same one?). They appear again in the 1950 census. They had at least three children. He died in South Florida. \"Wendy\" mentions a great aunt Myrtice Mordaunt whom I assume was his (later?) wife.\n\nunnamed Mordaunt (1934 - 1934). A Hal Mordaunt, listed on a FamilySearch transcription, with Margie Davis, had an unnamed child who was born and died on September 16th, 1934, in Miami.\n\nMarjorie Mordaunt (abt. 1937). In the 1940 census her name seems to be spelt differently from her mother's.\n\nDiane Mordaunt (later Reeves)\n\nBy the 1920 census Hal (snr) had left Ethel and Hal jnr and was married to Margaret Ryan from Nova Scotia. They were living in Flint Ward 2, Genesee, Michigan. The family settled in Buffalo, NY, in 1926, and were recorded there in the 1930 census. Hal had given up acting and was now working in real estate.\n\nMargaret M. (Peggy) Mordaunt (1918 - ?), born in Ohio\n\nWalter James Mordaunt (1919 - ?), born in Michigan. He is listed as James in the 1920 census and as Walter J. in 1930. In the 1950 census, the only Walter J that matches was decribed as born in New York and living in Albany. He had married a wife, Verna, and ws a reporter for a daily newspaper.\n\nLawrence P. Mordaunt (b. 1922) was born in Terra Haute, Indiana, while his parents performed Shakespeare on the road. Laurance married Mary Frances O'Rourke in 1946. They were in New York at the 1950 census with their first child. He does not seem to have been employed at the time. They had 13 children in total of which Tom is the third.\n\nMichael Mordaunt (b. 1947, now living in Miami, Florida. He made it on to the 1950 census\n\nJames Mordaunt (b. 1950), now in Phoenix, Arizona. Known as Jimbo and married to Carie.\n\nThomas Mordaunt (b. 1951), now in Marietta, GA\n\nNicholas Mordaunt\n\nPeter Mordaunt (b. 1952), now in Williamsville, NY\n\nMargaret Mordaunt (b. 1954), still in Buffalo, NY\n\nJohn Mordaunt (b. 1956), deceased\n\nMary Mordaunt (b. 1958), (now Mitchel) in Honeoye, NY\n\nDaniel Mordaunt (b. 1959), also in Williamsville, NY\n\nPaul Mordaunt (b. 1960), now in Amherst, NY\n\nEileen Mordaunt (b. 1961), deceased\n\nTimothy Mordaunt (b. 1962), also still in Buffalo\n\nPatrica Mordaunt (b. 1965), (now Patricia Frank) in Kenmore, NY\n\nLaura Mordaunt (b. 1967), (now Boronski) in Longs, SC\n\nMary Mordaunt , husband not known, is mentioned in an entry in the www.mordaunt.com website by a member of the Block family. She was living in New York in 1910 at the time of her daughter's wedding\n\nMabel Mordaunt, like her mother does not seem to appear in any census. According to the Block family record she was an actress who married William B. Norris on 1 June 1910 at St. James Episcopal Church in Chicago, Illinois, reported in the NY Times on 2 June 1910.\n\nGeorge Mordaunt married Sarah Wincester in Mississipi, Missouri on July 1, 1873\n\nJack Mordaunt (February 1876 - ?), born in Nebraska of Iowa parents, was a \"roomer\" in Lincoln Ward 3, Lancaster, at the 1900 census, working as a clerk.\n\nJ Elmer Mordaunt (abt. 1883 - ?) was, according to the 1910 census, born in Massachusetts of parents from Massachusetts.

I have not found him in any earlier or later record.\n\nEmily Matilda Mordaunt (? - ?) married in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1886 according to the marriage records of the Massachusetts State Archives\n\nHelen Mordaunt (abt. 1869 - ?) a widow and boarding house keeper from New York appeared with her children in Omaha Ward 3, Nebraska, for the 1910 census. Her parents were French but I have found no indication who her husband was. Another family that appears just once and then disappears from the record.\n\nAmy Mordaunt (abt.1889 - ?) had been born in New York.\n\nGeorge M. Mordaunt (abt.1891 - ?) had been born in New York. In 1910 he was working as a checker in a railroad baggage room.\n\nHenrietta Mordaunt (abt.1894 - ?) had been born in Nebraska.\n\nHazel Mordaunt (abt.1898 - ?) had been born in Nebraska.\n\nJohn E. Mordaunt of Portland, Maine, married Elizabeth (Lizzie) Burgess, according to his great x 2 granddaughter, Sharon McNamara, who kindly made contact with me through the site guestbook. His wife Lizzie was listed in a 1911 Portland directory living with one son:\n\nWilliam Howard Mordaunt. He was to marry Veronica (Vera) Murphy (abt 1881 - before 1930?) who had been born on Prince Edward Island, Canada, and arrived in the US in 1905/08. In a 1915 Portland city directory and on his son Thomas Joseph's birth record he is described as a machinist and living at 7 Marion Street. The 1920 census recorded Vera as married, living in Portland, Maine, but William was not listed. According to Sharon, he had abandoned the family when the youngest child was two years old. In the 1920 census Vera was described as a general labourer; if that was so, it must have been a struggle to raise her family - an heroic lady. In 1917, 1919 and 1921 city directories she was described as a widow. A William H. Mordaunt was listed in the 1922 Connecticut City Directory, and again in 1923, as an attendant the Norwich State Hospital for the Insane.\n\nMuriel E. Mordaunt (1908 - 2006) was born in Boston, Massachusetts. By the 1930 census she was head of the family, working as a stenographer for a newspaper. She was to marry Harry Clifton Trent and, amongst other family, Sharon McNamara is her granddaughter\n\nErnest Leo Mordaunt (May 20, 1910 - before 1920) whose birth was recorded in Cumberland County, Maine. He was not listed in the 1920 census.\n\nWilliam L. Mordaunt (abt. 1911 - June 7th 1972) was born in Maine. In the 1930 census he was working in the mail office of a newspaper. He married Celestia Leonard (abt. 1917 - ?) from Maine in West Harbour, on September 29th 1935 according to the marriage records of Maine State Archives. They were recorded in Chelsea, MA, in the 1940 census when he was described as a laborer in the sewers. That is probably why his next job, in the 1950 census, was in a soap factory. By now they had added four more children and had moved to Saugus, Essex, MA.\n\nWilliam L. Mordaunt jnr. (abt. 1937 - ?) who was born in Massachusetts\n\nDavid C. Mordaunt (abt. 1939 - ?) who was born in Masssachusetts.\n\nInez C. Mordaunt (abt. 1944 - ?) who was born in Massachusetts\n\nRichard L.

He too was born in Masssachusetts.\n\nJames L. Mordaunt (abt. 1950 - ?) who was also born in Masssachusetts.\n\nCharles C. Mordaunt (abt. 1912 - before 1930) was born in Massachusetts. Sharon believes he drowned in his early teens\n\nJessie G. Mordaunt (abt. 1913 - April 4th 1980) was born in Maine. She married Edgar J. Acker in Portland on July 7th 1931 and then Howard W. Berry on May 18th 1951 according to the marriage records of Maine State Archives.\n\nThomas Joseph Mordaunt (July 18th 1915 - before 1920) whose birth was recorded in Cumberland County, Maine.

There is no indication who her husband had been. The census said she had had a child but there is no mention of him/her. She died, aged 27 years in Dallas in February 1916.\n\nEdward James Mordaunt (1891 - 1972) appears from nowhere in the 1920 census, although he does appear before then in the WW I draft records. His father was described as from New York and his mother as Iris"
