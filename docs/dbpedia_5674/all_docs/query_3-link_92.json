        "text": "Kim\n\nMordaunt\n\nbegan his career as an actor and then moved into directing and shooting\n\ndocumentaries which he credits for having helped him as a fiction filmmaker. A firm believer that real life is more extraordinary than anything you could dream up, Mordaunt believes his acting experience\n\ngave him an insight into the detail of people’s incredible stories and\n\nhow to paint them with truth and respect. The half Anglo and half Indian Mauritian filmmaker is married to Sylvia Wilczynski who worked alongside him as a producer for “The Rocket,” which will premiere at Tribeca.\n\nWhat it’s about: “The Rocket” is a determined and resourceful boy’s quest to prove he is\n\nnot cursed with bad luck – his epic journey through war ravaged Laos to\n\nthe dangerous but lucrative Rocket Festival.\n\nWhat else audiences should know: “The Rocket” has come from a 10 year long relationship with Laos and its\n\npeople. Producer Sylvia Wilczynski and I made a documentary called\n\n“Bomb Harvest” in Laos which very much seeded the idea for “The Rocket”,\n\nand on this film we also met Lao Pauline Phayvanh Phoumindr, who became\n\nan associate producer on “The Rocket”.\n\nHis biggest challenges: “After making “Bomb Harvest” about an Australian bomb disposal\n\nspecialist working in Laos , we and the Lao community in Laos,\n\nAustralia and around the world really wanted our next film to be\n\ncentered around a Lao protagonist in Laos, in Lao language. This was a\n\nhuge challenge to finance – to have people have faith in a foreign\n\nlanguage story set in Laos with kids, animals, action, explosives, a\n\nlot of travel and filming restrictions, without any international stars\n\nby a first time feature producer and writer and director.”\n\nWhat he hopes Tribeca audiences will walk away with: “A view into a mostly unseen and disappearing world that hums with\n\nmeaning in a global context – to have an inkling of the personal impact\n\non people of outside forces such as war and economic development. That human beings are capable of both terrible and wonderful things and\n\nthat hope can come from the most unexpected and amazing places.”\n\nFilms that inspired him: “Films that inspire me are: The Motorcycle Diaries, Central Station, The\n\nIntouchables, Babel, The Piano, Beasts of the Southern Wild, Betty Blue,\n\nThe Deer Hunter, Don’t Look Now, Fargo, Gallipoli, How to Train Your\n\nDragon, Shrek, Slumdog Millionaire, The Birds, One Flew Over the\n\nCuckoo’s Nest. And all of David Attenborough’s work.”\n\nOn his background: “I’m an eternal student of film making from reading screenplays and\n\nwatching and analyzing films, but also just generally trying to work out\n\nwhat makes people tick. I have a film-making degree from University of\n\nTechnology Sydney and a diploma in acting from LAMDA, the London Academy of\n\nMusic and Dramatic art. My mentors to date have been my art teacher\n\nat school, Kerry Woods, my father, Richard, who is a documentary filmmaker and step-mother ,Diana, who is a painter. As well as working collaborations with\n\npeople like writer and director Howard Jackson who I worked with as an actor\n\nand film-maker.”\n\nIndiewire invited Tribeca Film Festival directors to tell us about their films, including what inspired them, the challenges they faced and what they’re doing next. We’ll be publishing their responses leading up to the 2013 festival."
