        "text": "I don't have a scanner so I'll have to type it out\n\nMordaunt-Short was established in London 1967 for the design and manufacture of high quality loudspeaker systems. Early in 1970 we removed to the Hampshire market town of Petersfield and in 1975, following further growth in the demand for our products, to a tastefully converted mill on the River Rother in pastoral West Sussex countryside bordering the town. By no means unfittingly for the premises of a company dedicated to the greater enjoyment of music, Durford Mill dates from 1756, the year of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\nAmid the wealth of accomplishment of audio technology world-wide, the design of quality loudspeakers remains uniquely a sphere of British eminence. In this tradition, our products have become ever more highly regarded not only for their specifications but for the uncompromising craftsmanship of their manufacture and for their surpassing 'musicality' in performance. Now, following the development of our outstanding bass- and mid-frequency transducer, the DSB208, we have pleasure in introducing a new generation of loudspeaker systems, the Mordaunt-Short CARNIVAL, FESTIVAL and PAGEANT, SERIES 2.\n\nMordaunt-Short Ltd. is a progressive, closely-knit, private company, devoted alike to the traditional standards of commercial practice, to the advancement of audio technology and to the greater pleasure of the truly discerning. Whether you be primarily a music-lover, high fidelity enthusiast or home-maker, these superlative products have much to offer you.\n\nThe CARNIVAL SERIES 2 is a compact high-fidelity loudspeaker system offering outstanding sound reproduction from within the smallest economic compass.\n\nEmploying the DSB208 bass- and mid-frequency transducer and a wide dispersion cone tweeter, both of which confer sensitivity and high power rating, the CARNIVAL SERIES 2 achieves a remarkable bass response together with a low distortion and exceptionally smooth upper frequencies.\n\nThe CARNIVAL SERIES 2 is therefore ideal for use in multi-channel installations, in systems for which space is limited or in conjunction with amplifier or music-centers of modest output.\n\nSpecification.\n\nSystem Design: Compact, infinite baffle enclosure, for use shelf mounted, horizontally or vertically.\n\nCabinet: 15mm high-density board construction. Sides wood-veneered with internal balancing veneers; rear spray-finished neutral fleck.\n\nGrille: Acoustically transparent, deep brown woven fabric on 9mm board frame with nylon stud fastenings.\n\nCabinet Finish: Selected teak or walnut veneer.\n\nTransducers: Bass/mid frequency: DSB208. High-frequency: 68mm paper cone unit having damped surround and 12.5mm voice coil.\n\nDividing Network: High grade ferrite core inductors and low loss, close tolerance capacitors on printed circuit board.\n\nElectrical Connections: Terminal moulding incorporating both standard DIN socket and spring-loaded push button connectors for stripped wire ends. Plugs and leads supplied.\n\nDimensions: 400mm High x 240mm Wide x 145mm Deep.\n\nWeight: Single speaker unpacked : 5.2kg. Per pair packed : 12.1kg.\n\nPerformance Data.\n\nNominal Frequency Range: 45-20,000 Hz.\n\nSpecific Frequency Response: 85-17,000 Hz +/- 3dB.\n\nImpedance: 8 Ohms nominal, for use with amplifiers of 4-8 ohms output impedance.\n\nSensitivity: 6.9V r.m.s (6 watts) to produce 96dB at 1 metre in anechoic conditions using pink noise.\n\nMaximum Sound Pressure Level: 108dB typical listening in-room.\n\nContinuous Programme Rating: 18V r.m.s (40 watts) contoured random noise, including transients up to 50v peak to peak.\n\nAmplifier Power Compatibility: 10-80 watts per channel. Amplifiers of higher power may be used with care.\n\nDistortion: Substantially less than 1% total harmonic distortion within frequency range 150-20,000 Hz at 6.9V r.m.s input.\n\nFundamental System Resonance: 98 Hz.\n\nDividing Frequency: 3,500 Hz.\n\nFilter Characteristics: Low-pass: 12dB/octave. High-pass:12dB octave.\n\nComprising the DSB208 bass- and mid-frequency transducer and a dome tweeter whose upper response extends smoothly beyond audibility, the FESTIVAL SERIES 2 is a sensitive, versatile, high-performance system of exceptional 'musicality'.\n\nWith its extended bass response, high power handling and low distortion, the FESTIVAL SERIES 2 is therefore as eminently suitable for use in sophisticated high power installations as in smaller or more limited systems.\n\nSpecification:\n\nSystem Design: Compact, infinite baffle enclosure. For use shelf mounted horizontally or vertically.\n\nCabinet: 15mm high-density board construction. sides wood-veneered with internal balancing veneers, rear spray-finished neutral fleck.\n\nGrille: Acoustically transparent, deep brown woven fabric on 9mm board frame with nylon stud fastenings.\n\nCabinet Finish: Selected teak or walnut veneer.\n\nTransducers: Bass/mid frequency: DSB208. High-frequency: 19mm wide-dispersion synthetic dome.\n\nDividing Network: High grade, ferrite core inductors and low loss, close tolerance capacitors on printed circuit board.\n\nElectrical Connections: Terminal moulding incorporating both standard DIN socket and spring loaded push button connectors for stripped wire ends. Plugs and leads supplied.\n\nDimensions: 455mm high x 280mm wide x 185mm deep.\n\nWeight: Single speaker unpacked: 6.4Kg. Per pair, packed: 14.9Kg.\n\nPerformance Data.\n\nNominal Frequency Range: 35-20,000 Hz.\n\nSpecific Frequency Response: 75-20,000 Hz +/- 3dB.\n\nImpedance: 8 Ohms nominal. For use with amplifiers of 4-8 Ohms output impedance.\n\nSensitivity: 6.7V r.m.s (5.6 watts) to produce 96dB at 1 metre in anechoic conditions using pink noise.\n\nMaximum Sound Pressure Level: 109dB in typical listening-room.\n\nContinuous Programme Rating: 19V r.m.s (45 watts) contoured random noise, including transients up to 53V peak to peak.\n\nAmplifier Power Compatibility: 10-90 watts per channel. Amplifiers of higher power may be used with care.\n\nDistortion: Substantially less than 1% total harmonic distortion within frequency range of 150-25,000 Hz at 6.7V r.m.s input (nominal 96dB sound pressure level.)\n\nFundamental System Resonance: 75Hz.\n\nDividing Frequency: 3,500Hz.\n\nFilter Characteristics: Low pass: 12dB/octave. High pass: 18dB/octave.\n\nThe Mordaunt-Short PAGEANT SERIES 2 offers musical reproduction of the highest quality, a response of the utmost smoothness over the entire audible spectrum and a clarity of detail previously associated only with professional equipment.\n\nIncorporating the DSB208 bass- and mid-frequency transducer, a carefully matched synthetic dome tweeter of exceptional dispersion characteristics and independent controls for adjustment of the acoustics balance in adverse listening conditions, the PAGEANT SERIES 2 is thus a full frequency high performance system to be used to advantage with compatible equipment of virtually any power rating.\n\nSpecification.\n\nSystem Design: Resistively loaded reflex enclosure with mid and upper frequency controls for compensation of acoustic balance in adverse listening conditions. For use horizontally or vertically not less than 300mm from floor.\n\nCabinet: 15mm high-density board construction with internal bracing, sides wood veneered with internal balancing veneers; rear spray finished neutral fleck.\n\nGrille: Acoustically transparent, deep brown woven fabric on 9mm board frame with nylon stud fastenings.\n\nCabinet Finish: Selected teak or walnut veneer.\n\nTransducers: Bass/mid-frequency: DSB208.
