        "text": "Campaigners against antisemitism have condemned Tory leadership hopeful Penny Mordaunt’s meeting with the controversial Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) as “perplexing”.\n\nThe government broke off ties with the national Muslim body in 2009 after its deputy general secretary, Dr Daud Abdullah, signed a declaration calling for Muslims to take part in jihad against Israel.\n\nWhile sporadic contact between the MCB and government officials has taken place since, an official boycott of the group remains in place.\n\nIn February, Ms Mordaunt tweeted that she had met with MCB Secretary General Zara Mohammed to “wish her every success and hear more about her plans”. She added: “Look forward to working with her and her team.”\n\nMs Mohammed was elected last year as the first woman to lead the MCB. At the time, she said: “It was lovely meeting you @PennyMordaunt thank you for your encouragement and words of wisdom, look forward to challenging inequality and empowering more women.”\n\nThe Campaign Against Antisemitism told the Daily Mail: “It is perplexing that a minister chose to meet with the Muslim Council of Britain at a time when her own Government was blacklisting the organisation due to ongoing concerns.\n\n“It certainly raises questions for Penny Mordaunt, and the Jewish community will be interested in her answers.”\n\nLord Mann, the government’s antisemitism advisor, added: “Ministers are always well advised to ask advice before they stumble into these problems. Ministers who don’t ask for advice take unnecessary risks.”\n\nThe Istanbul declaration signed by Dr Abdullah said the \"Islamic Nation\" should \"carry on with the jihad and resistance against the occupier until the liberation of all Palestine\".\n\nIt further demanded that Muslims seek to ensure \"money, clothing, food, medicine, weapons and other essentials\" are able to enter Gaza so Palestinians \"are able to live and perform the jihad in the way of Allah Almighty\".\n\nThe document also warned: \"The closure of the crossings, or the prevention of the entry of weapons through them, should be regarded as high treason in the Islamic Nation, and clear support for the Zionist enemy.\"\n\nAt the time, then Communities Secretary Hazel Blears demanded that Dr Abdullah resign, and said the declaration \"calls for violence against troops and Jewish communities\".\n\nDr Abdullah denied the claim, saying: “I do not advocate attacks on any religious community. Both I and the MCB have done everything possible to de-escalate the crisis.”\n\nThe Muslim Council of Britain and Penny Mordaunt MP have been contacted for comment."
