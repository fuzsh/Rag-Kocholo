        "text": "Mordaunts in Clerkenwell\n\nThese Mordaunts overlap the Tudor and Stuart era and are therefore included on both pages\n\nA Sir John Mordaunt (abt 1637 - 1723) of Islington made his Will in 1723, leaving his property in neighbouring Clerkenwell between his wife Elizabeth and one named son. He was buried in the parish church at Islington, described as \"Sir John Mordaunt, late of Tangier, Knight Banneret.\" He could possibly be the John Mordaunt of Oakley, above, who married Elizabeth Gurnay,he could be John Mordaunt, grandson of George Mordaunt, younger brother of L'Estrange, the first baronet, or he could be from some other quite separate branch of the family\n\nJohn Mordaunt.\n\nA daughter Mordaunt is mentioned in Sir John's will\n\nSome doubts have to be expressed. Knights banneret were created only in the field of battle by the King or a general. According to the website of the Imperial Society of Knights Batchelor, the last knight banneret was created in 1642, when this Sir John would have been about five years old. England had nothing to do with Tangier until it was occupied by an Army garrison from 1661, when it was received from Portugal as part of Catherine of Braganza's dowry on her wedding to Charles II. It was evacuated in 1684. (Henry Mordaunt, 2nd Earl of Peterborough was sent as its first Governor and Charles Mordaunt, later 3rd Earl, also served there briefly as a sort of gentleman adventurer). So, how and when was \"Sir John\" made a knight banneret? The evidence can be interpreted as suggesting he may have been a bit of a fraud.\n\nJohn Mordaunt (? - 1736) of the parish of St Ann, Westminster was clearly comfortably off. His wife, remembered in his Will, was Jane. Despite his main property and financial assets, clearly that dearest to his heart was his share in the playhouse in Drury Lane, which he made sure to preserve for his grandson's use. Only one child is mentioned in his Will, a daughter.\n\nDiana Mordaunt who married a John Furbar. I am grateful to Rosemary Gardiner, conducting her own research, who contacted me through my Guest Book with the information that he was to rise to the rank of Major General in the army. They had, by the time of her father's Will in 1736, one son\n\nMordaunt Furbar\n\nShe is, presumably, the Diana Mordaunt, daughter of John and Jane Mordaunt, who was christened at St. James, Clerkenwell, on 23rd February, 1709, in which case she had a sister\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt who was christened at St. James, Clerkenwell, on 30th August, 1710. She would have had to have died by the date of her father's Will written in 1736.\n\nJohn Mordaunt married Elizabeth Flood at St James, Clerkenwell, on 1st July, 1715. This is the same church and around the same time as the family above but whether there was any connection with this family I do not know.\n\nThese bits of information could be forced together as follows:\n\nSir John Mordaunt (abt 1637 - 1723) of Islington, whose first wife is not known, had one surviving son\n\nJohn Mordaunt whose wife was Jane. They had children:\n\nDiana Mordaunt who was christened at St. James, Clerkenwell, on 23rd February, 1709, and who married John Furbar(?) and they had, by the time of her father's Will in 1736, one son\n\nMordaunt Furbar\n\nElizabeth Mordaunt who was christened at St. James, Clerkenwell, on 30th August, 1710. She would have had to have died by the date of her grandfather's Will written in 1723.\n\nSir John, a widower, married Elizabeth Flood at St James, Clerkenwell, on 1st July, 1715.\n\nConversely, this tree could equally be completely wrong! In any case, I have not been able to fit Mary Mordaunt into the picture at all."
