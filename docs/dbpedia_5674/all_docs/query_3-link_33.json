        "text": "“Politics is about momentum; I’m afraid I didn’t have it this time,” conceded Jeremy Hunt, after his first-round defeat in the Tory leadership race. Momentum, however, is very much with a woman whom only 11% of Brits could identify in a photo. But she now has a shot at becoming the next prime minister.\n\nPenny Mordaunt, the trade minister, came in second to Rishi Sunak in Tuesday night’s secret ballot among Conservative lawmakers and did so again on Wednesday, picking up more votes than any other leadership candidate as the business end of the race gets underway. While that has boosted her chances of becoming the next Conservative leader — and UK prime minister — it has also put a giant target on her back."
