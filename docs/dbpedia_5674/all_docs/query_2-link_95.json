        "text": "Frederick Wentworth Mordaunt Hall, who in 1924 became the first regularly assigned film critic of The New York Times, died Monday in St. Luke's Hospital. He was 94 years old and had been living in the Lynwood Nursing Home.\n\nMr. Hall, whose byline was Mordaunt Hall but who was called Freddie by his ,friends, worked on The New York Press from 1909 to 1914, when he joined James Gordon Bennett's New York Herald.\n\nIn World War I, Mr. Hall was commissioned a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and did intelligence work, also writing articles after visiting the trenches in France and riding in a balloon over the North Sea and in a submarine beneath it.\n\nFor The Times, Mr. Hall's style was chatty, irreverent and not particularly analytical. In one of his early articles, his attitude toward the mass audience was made clear when he wrote that the late director Cecil B. De Mille's “spectacular efforts are not without success in the box offices of provincial )icture theaters.” He added that it was “problematical” whether “his strange tales from the Hollywood hills amuse or interest enlightened Broadway audiences.”\n\nHe acknowledged that the enlightened did show enthusiasm for DeMille's “The Ten Commandments.” But he could irk film magnates. A piqued Harry Warner, Mr. Hall once recounted, had told him: “You like Ernst Lubitsch's pictures, but they don't make money. You pan pictures that pay.”\n\nMr. Hall continued as film critic through the advent of sound, retiring after 10 years in the post. His final reviews —such as those of Grace Moore in “One Night of Love” and Claude Rains in “Crime Without Passion”—were much like his early ones—a clear indication of his likes and dislikes and a detailed recounting of the story of the film. The interest of other critics in analyzing cinematographic techniques was not for him.\n\nConcerning “Crime Without Passion,” he said that Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur had used “both camera and microphone effects” to full advantage — without suggesting what the effects were.\n\nAfter retiring from The Times, Mr. Hall joined the Bell Syndicate as a copy editor.\n\nFor many years he was an usher at the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.\n\nMr. Hall was a senior member of the Silurians, a society of New York news veterans. Many of its members remember him as a raconteur, who was entertaining rather than boastful. He was also a member of the Overseas Press Club."
