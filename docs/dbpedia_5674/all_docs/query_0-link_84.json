        "text": "Comparison of Mordaunt Short Aviano/Mezzo and Polk Rti\n\nThought I'll post my query on this thread as its related to a speaker that I am considering, and I guess, opening a new thread would be considered \"bad manners\".\n\nI have a Denon 2310 AVR and have Bose AM10 speakers connected to the same. Now this gives me good sound for movies, but I was thinking of getting a couple of dedicated speakers to use as the \"B\" front speakers (as the Denon would recognize them) and use them for all 2 channel sources and use my regular 5.1 for by surround needs.\n\nMy room size is not large (about 11x14, with the width being 14feet, so listening position is about 10' from the speakers along with shorter dimension).\n\nI would like to hear your feedback on what would be a better bet for me from below:\n\n1. MS Aviano 6 vs MS Mezzo 2 (one if a floorstander and the other a Bookshelf). They are priced similarly (around 35-37K?). The dealer was telling me that the Mezzo 2 will be a lot better than the Aviano 6 as its in a different league altogether, did not have a long enough listening session so far to judge for myself.\n\n2. How about if I move up to the Mezzo 6 (around 70K?) Is this an overkill for my room size? I will have to stretch my budget quite a bit, but then can do that if it is a big step up from the others.\n\n3. And then again, views on Polk Rti A7 which I have not auditioned so far, but will soon, and I hear good reviews of.\n\nPoints to consider:\n\na) The new fronts will only be used for 2 channel music, a variety of music - from Rock, Jazz, western classical to Ghazals, Hindustani classical to Bollywood/Desi Rock.\n\nb) I will not use a sub woofer with my stereo setup, the sub(or bass module) that I have already will only be used when I chose a mode as DD or DTS or whatever while watching a movie, in which case, the new speakers will cut off and my old Bose cubes will fill in for the fronts. So with bookshelves (Mezzo 2), bass will be limited as I understand.\n\nc) At this point, I am not getting a dedicated 2 channel amp (I did listen to the CA 650A with Mezzo 2 and 6 at the Gurgaon store and really liked it!). So my Denon 2310 has to match with my new speakers.\n\nI do understand that music tastes and speaker choices are personal and what sounds good to me may not be the same for every ear around, but would really appreciate your inputs."
