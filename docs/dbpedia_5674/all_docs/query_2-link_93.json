        "text": "Right-wing Tory MPs are using Penny Mordaunt as a “stalking horse” to oust Rishi Sunak, allies of the Prime Minister have claimed.\n\nTory loyalists claimed an apparent move by a group of Right-wing Conservatives to support Ms Mordaunt was a ploy to bolster support among centrist MPs for a leadership contest in which they could enter their own candidate.\n\nIn a sign of the growing rifts within the Conservative Party, multiple allies of Mr Sunak also suggested that Ms Mordaunt, the Leader of the Commons, lacked a clear set of political beliefs and was seen as an “empty vessel” even by genuine supporters.\n\nThe extraordinary infighting came after many of Mr Sunak’s MPs were spooked last week when the Budget failed to cause an immediate bounce in the polls. The Conservatives are 20 points behind Labour, prompting fears of an historic wipeout.\n\nThe Prime Minister also faced fury over his handling of the defection of Lee Anderson, the former Tory deputy chairman, to Reform UK, and a racism row involving the biggest Conservative donor.\n\nFears about the party’s prospects at the next election have spread to senior ministers and aides, with one government source stating: “It’s all last days of Rome stuff.”\n\nMr Sunak will attempt to calm nerves when he addresses the 1922 committee on Wednesday evening as part of a “pedal to the floor” approach before Easter.\n\nGovernment aides expect official figures that morning to show a further fall in inflation – a fact the Prime Minister would use to insist that the economy was improving and voters would notice the shift, along with the positive effects of the Conservatives’ tax cuts, before long.\n\nSeparately, The Telegraph has revealed that the Conservatives are preparing to revive Mr Sunak’s leadership pledge to overhaul New Labour’s equality laws to protect single-sex spaces and women’s sports, in a move ministers believe would create a clear dividing line with Labour on the issue.\n\nSenior Government figures are considering a manifesto commitment to amend the Equality Act, which the Prime Minister previously said had become a “trojan horse” for “woke nonsense”.\n\nHowever, the issue is also a source of tension within the Conservative Party. During the 2022 leadership contest, Ms Mordaunt came under fire for previously stating that “trans men are men, trans women are women”.\n\nOn Friday, The Telegraph reported that some MPs from the Right of the Tory party had let it be known that they were prepared to rally around Ms Mordaunt to prevent catastrophic losses at the polls.\n\nA meeting was understood to have taken place between leading figures on the Tory Right and prominent supporters of Ms Mordaunt from when she ran for the party leadership.\n\nOne Tory source claimed: “Penny is now a much more credible candidate with people on the Right. She is supported in the polls and surveys, and she is the one with the most personal motivation because, for her, the change is possibly key to her remaining as an MP.”\n\nMs Mordaunt has a 15,780 majority in Portsmouth North compared with the 27,000 majority won by Kemi Badenoch, who is viewed as a rival.\n\nAn ally of Mr Sunak said: “There’s a small cabal coming up with ways to act, and this is their latest idea so that more people in the party go ‘oh, alright then’. I think all the MPs know that we need to remain united and take the fight to Labour.”\n\nA second ally said of Ms Mordaunt: “She had a following in MP circles [during the last contest], but more broadly in the party she never really appealed to the Right. I think it is probably either one or two people trying to get it going to distract from what others are doing, or it’s a ‘get her in and see what happens’.”\n\nA third loyalist said of the “stalking horse” claim: “I’ve no doubt that is what they are trying to do. It’s ridiculous. Why do some people think everyone would magically accept her?”\n\nAnother of the Tory loyalists claimed Ms Mordaunt was seen as “an empty vessel”, alleging of her supporters: “They think she’ll be the face of it and ‘I’ll be the real power behind the throne’. But they’ll find out it doesn’t work like that. She will make her own decisions.”\n\nA Right-wing Tory source backing Ms Mordaunt described the “stalking horse” claims as “rubbish”, but David Davis, the former Brexit secretary who supported Ms Mordaunt’s candidacy in the summer 2022 leadership contest, said: “I think all this Mordaunt stuff is put up by her enemies, not her friends.”\n\nIn 1989, a “stalking horse” challenge by Sir Anthony Meyer led to the leadership election of 1990 that brought about Margaret Thatcher’s downfall. Since then, the rules have changed so that such a candidate cannot simply trigger a contest themselves with a handful of backers.\n\nIn this case, it is being claimed that some MPs on the Right of the party are pledging support for Ms Mordaunt so that she effectively becomes a “stalking horse” candidate behind whom MPs across the party felt they could unite, on the basis that many centrist MPs may not wish to back potential candidates such as Mrs Badenoch and Suella Braverman.\n\nOne MP on the Right of the party said he believed “Penny could turn things around a bit”, adding: “I’m not saying she could win the election for us, but she’s certainly better at communication than Rishi.\n\n“There has been a huge change of sentiment in the parliamentary party this week. You can feel it. People look shell-shocked. I think it is more likely than not that he’ll be required to go before the next election.”\n\nAn ally of Ms Mordaunt said she was “doing what she is paid to do, as Leader of the House, and she is really good at it”. She was not among those potential leadership contenders who were “on manoeuvres”, the ally said.\n\n“They are trying to get somebody else to do their work for them, seeing as they are incapable of doing it themselves,” the ally added. “It’s destructive, but it’s a sign of weakness, not strength, on the Right.\n\n“[The party] will have another fit of nerves like this after the May elections. You never see the rebels in the tea room these days, and the reason is they know the reception they’ll get.”\n\nThe latest Tory infighting follows reports in January that a group of parliamentarians and former Tory aides were plotting to unseat Mr Sunak.\n\nOne parliamentarian said “the vehicle they were going to do it through was to sink the Rwanda Bill and make Rishi resign on the back of that”. This week, Mr Sunak will seek to use his Commons majority to ditch dozens of amendments to the legislation from the Lords, in a move he hopes may help cement his authority.\n\nOne minister criticised Mr Sunak and his aides for failing to calm Tory nerves earlier by ruling out a May election before Thursday, when the Prime Minister finally said no poll would be held on May 2.\n\n“The little things don’t matter, but people get grumpy when you add it all up”, said the minister of Number 10’s missteps, adding: “The real problem is the party had unrealistic expectations about the Budget.\n\n“You don’t expect a Budget to move your poll rating. The only way of getting through this is to calm down. He [the Prime Minister] is the only show in town.”"
