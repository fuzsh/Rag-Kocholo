        "text": "Britain has its first female Defence Secretary after Gavin Williamson was sensationally sacked in a leak inquiry.\n\nPenny Mordaunt is a 44-year-old Royal Navy reservist who's only been an MP since 2010 - but has a rich slew of headlines to her name.\n\nFrom bellyflopping on national TV to slashing billions off benefits and \"lying\" about Brexit , she's often been famous - and only sometimes for the right reasons.\n\nSo who is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nThe daughter of a paratrooper and special needs teacher, who has a twin brother, the Portsmouth North MP went to her local comprehensive.\n\nShe worked in a factory and as a magician's assistant to save up for Reading University, which she was the first member of her family to go to.\n\nThe PR supremo was director of communications for the National Lottery, head of campaigns for Diabetes UK, head of foreign press for George W Bush’s 2000 and 2004 election campaigns and chief of staff for former MP David Willetts.\n\nShe was also ‘head of youth’ under John Major and William Hague’s head of broadcasting.\n\nShe became an MP in 2010 and shot up through the ranks. She became a minister in 2014 and International Development Secretary in 2017.\n\nMs Mordaunt said she gained an interest in politics after working in hospitals and orphanages in Romania, for the year before and during university.\n\nShe is an ardent Brexiteer who backed Leaver Andrea Leadsom for the Tory leadership and refused to back Theresa May's deal in December, prompting rumours she'd quit the Cabinet.\n\nShe also reportedly voiced security concerns about Chinese phone giant Huawei being given a role in building the UK's 5G network.\n\nYet now she's promoted, and remains minister for women and equalities alongside her new job, after showing loyalty to her boss personally.\n\nAnd she's positioned herself carefully as a possible candidate for the Tory leadership when Theresa May finally decides to go.\n\nIt's not all bad though. She's pushed to reform anti-abortion laws and helped clean up the sex abuse scandal in the aid sector.\n\nHere are 8 more things you need to know about the new MOD boss - some of them good, and some of them not so much.\n\n1. She bellyflopped on national TV with Tom Daley\n\nMs Mordaunt infamously appeared on the ITV show Splash! - including a magnificent bellyflop into the televised pool.\n\nThe MP defended her decision to take part in the TV contest alongside Boyzone singer Keith Duffy , model Danielle Lloyd and The Saturdays singer Una Foden, and insisted that she did not want to be famous.\n\n\"There have been suggestions that I shouldn't be appearing in a swimsuit. I don't know whether people had visions that I'd be jumping off the boards with strategically placed rosettes,\" she said.\n\nOf her £10,000 appearance fee, £7,000 went towards the renovation of her local lido.\n\nThe rest was given to four Armed Services charities.\n\n2. She 'lied' about Brexit on the BBC's top politics show\n\nThe Vote Leave rep was accused of \"plain and simple lying\" and slammed by David Cameron over claims she made in the 2016 EU referendum campaign.\n\nBrexiteer Ms Mordaunt spoke out after Vote Leave produced divisive posters that declared: \"Turkey (population 76million) is joining the EU\".\n\nIn fact, the UK had a veto on Turkey joining and then-PM David Cameron said he didn't think it would happen \"for decades\" due to security fears.\n\nMs Mordaunt was told by the BBC's Andrew Marr that the British government had a veto on Turkey joining the EU.\n\nShe replied: \"No, it doesn’t. We are not going to be able to have a say.\"\n\nDavid Cameron hit back moments later: \"Let me be clear, Britain and every other country in the European Union has a veto on another country joining.\n\n\"That is a fact, and the fact that the Leave campaign are getting things as straightforward as this wrong should call in to question their whole judgment in making the bigger argument about leaving the EU.\"\n\n3. She oversaw a £3.7bn attack on disability benefit that was eventually defeated in court\n\nAs Disabilities Minister in 2017, Ms Mordaunt oversaw possibly one of the most expensive and cruel benefits foul-ups in recent history.\n\nThe DWP rewrote the law, without consulting its own Social Security Advisory Committee, to ensure 220,000 people did not get higher disability benefits.\n\nMs Mordaunt's officials took the move to avoid complying with two tribunal rulings - and avoid spending £3.7bn.\n\nThose tribunals had said the benefit Personal Independence Payment (PIP) should be more generous for people who suffer distress when travelling alone.\n\nBut the DWP was later overruled by the High Court, which ruled the DWP must follow what the two tribunals said and make PIP more generous.\n\nTory ministers later launched an astonishing review of 1.6MILLION people's disability benefits to make the change, at eye-watering cost to the public.\n\n4. She told a load of c**k jokes in Parliament for a bet...\n\nMs Mordaunt caused controversy in 2014 when she admitted she had peppered a parliamentary speech with double entendres for a dare.\n\nShe said “c**k” five times and “lay” or “laid” six times as well as mentioning the names of many of her Navy pals.\n\nAngry MPs accused her of wasting Parliamentary time.\n\n5... And mentioned testicles in a humble address to the Queen\n\nYes, really. She said in the Commons debate in 2014: \"Training must be tailored to enable us to be our best.\n\n\"I have benefited from some excellent training by the Royal Navy, but on one occasion I felt that it was not as bespoke as it might have been.\n\n\"Fascinating though it was, I felt that the lecture and practical demonstration on how to care for the penis and testicles in the field failed to appreciate that some of us attending had been issued with the incorrect kit.\"\n\n6. She pushed for reforms to Northern Ireland abortion law - but failed\n\nAs minister for women and equalities, Ms Mordaunt has been calling for reforms to Northern Ireland's hardline anti-abortion laws.\n\nAfter Ireland voted to relax its ban, Ms Mordaunt said the result signalled an \"historic and great day for Ireland\" and a \"hopeful one for Northern Ireland\".\n\nShe added: \"That hope must be met.\"\n\nBut her attempts to change the law, as with other Tory ministers, were unsuccessful. It would have involved direct rule from Westminster over the region, something the government is understandably reluctant to do.\n\n7. She was the first minister to use sign language in Parliament\n\nLast July, Penny Mordaunt became the first ever government minister to use British Sign Language in Parliament.\n\nThe Tory International Development Secretary announced a global disability conference to take place in London later that month.\n\nShe said: “On the 24th of July, we will hold a global disability conference here in London, organised by the UK Government, by the Kenya Government and by the International Disability Alliance.\n\n\"For too long in the world’s poorest countries, disabled people have not been able to reach their full potential because of stigma or not enough practical support.\"\n\nMPs from across the house applauded as she completed her statement.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow responded by saying - and signing - \"That is good news.\"\n\n8. And she helped clean up the aid workers sex abuse scandal\n\nPenny Mordaunt was International Development Secretary when the aid sector was engulfed by claims of sexual abuse in disaster-hit countries.\n\nShe pledged £5 million of government funding to help vulnerable children across the globe.\n\nAnd she was confronted by a protester as she addressed a conference on sex abuse in the aid sector.\n\nAlexia Pepper de Caires - a former whistleblower at Save the Children - walked onto the platform where Ms Mordaunt was speaking to complain that those leading the fight against abuse were being ignored.\n\nThe International Development Secretary, who calmly listened to her, said she had been unaware of the concerns she raised.\n\nShe offered to give up her second speaking slot at the end of the conference so she and her colleagues could address it.\n\nIn another speech she said: \"No organisation is too big or our work with them too complex for me to hesitate to remove funding from them if we cannot trust them to put the beneficiaries of aid first.\""
