        "text": "David was the outstanding Wellington cricketer of his generation: prominent amongst his peers as a schoolboy, he was unquestionably the best all-rounder Wellington College produced until the emergence of the Curran brothers.\n\nHe made his first class debut in 1958 for Sussex, scoring 96 in the second innings, when he was caught trying to hit his fourth six to reach his century. He played 19 first class matches for Sussex from 1958-60, all as an amateur. He returned to Wellington to teach in 1963, and played over 40 times for Berkshire from 1964 to 1974, winning the Man of the Match award in the 1st Round of the Gillette Cup in 1965 for his 60, including 4 sixes of the bowling of Bill Alley.\n\nA right handed, hard hitting batsman, medium fast right arm bowler, and brilliant fielder, he was the spearhead of Old Wellingtonian Cricketer Cup teams through the 60s 70s and 80s and one of the competition’s truly outstanding players. He was also a noted expeditioner, leading three Royal Geographical Schools Expeditions to the Arctic and, in 1983, a Royal Geographic Society expedition through Nepal to the base of Annapurna.\n\nDavid taught at Wellington as a member of the Maths Dept between 1963 and 1986 and was Tutor of the Bd, Master i/c Cricket and President of Common Room amongst the host of positions he took on and was, not least, an inspiration to all who knew him."
