        "text": "We are delighted to announce the immediate availability of CAPSULaser in Australia & New Zealand through our business partners Device Technologies\n\nDevice Technologies has introduced CAPSULaser Selective Laser Capsulotomy (SLC) to enable cataract surgeons to perform highly accurate and consistent capsulotomies in less than one third of a second, ensuring precise size, circularity and position.\n\nIn addition, the resultant capsulotomy provides greater elasticity and strength compared to a manual capsulotomy (1).\n\n“A significant advantage of the CAPSULaser system is its seamless integration into the existing cataract workflow and its low procedure cost,” Device Technologies business development manager Mr Mark Altman said.\n\n“The system connects directly to the operating room microscope thus eliminating the need to move the patient or requiring additional theatre space, allowing surgeons to perform laser assisted cataract procedures in an efficient and cost-effective manner.”\n\nCAPSULaser provides 100% free floating 360° capsulotomies due to its ability to deliver laser energy in a continuous manner, this eliminates the issue of irregular or “postage stamp capsulotomies” that can occur with other laser-assisted cataract systems reliant on pulsed laser energy.\n\nFor further information and to book an evaluation, please contact customers@device.com.au\n\nReferences:\n\nDaya et al. Parameters affecting anterior capsulotomy tear strength and distension. Journal of Cataract & Refractive Surgery: March 2019 – Volume 45 – Issue 3 – p 355-360.\n\nPresented in part at the ASCRS•ASOA Annual Meeting, Washington, DC, USA, April 2018\n\nAuthors: Pavel Stodulka MD, PhD, FEBOS-CR1, Richard Packard MD, FRCS, FRCOphth2, David Mordaunt PhD3\n\n1. Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic\n\n2. Arnott Eye Associates, London, United Kingdom\n\n3. EXCEL-LENS, Inc., Los Gatos, California, USA\n\nPurpose\n\nTo compare the efficacy and safety of anterior capsulotomy creation with a new selective laser device (CAPSULaser) with those of manual capsulotomies.\n\nSetting\n\nGEMINI Eye Clinic, Zlin, Czech Republic.\n\nDesign\n\nProspective case series.\n\nMethods\n\nPatients were placed in cohorts based on age and cataract grade and randomly allocated to have laser capsulotomy or manual continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). The anterior capsule was stained with microfiltered trypan blue 0.4%. The anterior capsulotomy was created with the laser device focused on the anterior capsule through a custom patient interface lens. Intraoperative video analysis with the use of an intraocular ruler and postoperative examinations were used to assess safety and efficacy (accuracy of capsulotomy size, circularity, centration).\n\nResults\n\nNo intraoperative complications occurred in the laser group or the manual group. All capsulotomies in the laser group were free-floating with no tags or tears. The mean capsulotomy diameter was 5.03 mm overall (range 4.8 to 5.2 mm, laser group; 4.4 to 5.8 mm, manual group). In the laser group, all the capsulotomies were within 0.1 mm ± 0.1 (SD) of the target. The circularity accuracy was greater than 99.0% ± 1.0%; the mean centration of the capsulotomy in relation to the intraocular lens (IOL) was 0.1 ± 0.1 mm. All parameters were statistically significant (P < .01). The IOL–capsulotomy overlap was 360 degrees in all laser cases.\n\nConclusions\n\nSelective laser capsulotomy using a new proprietary trypan blue formulation was safe and effective in cataract surgery. The sizing, circularity, and centration of the laser capsulotomy were more accurate than those of the manual CCC, resulting in consistent 360-degree IOL coverage.\n\nAuthors: Sheraz M.

Mordaunt, PhD\n\nPurpose To compare the anterior capsulotomy edge tear strength created by manual continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC), femtosecond laser-assisted capsulotomy (FLACS), and selective laser capsulotomy (SLC).\n\nSetting Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore and Excel-Lens, Livermore, California, USA.\n\nDesign Three armed study in paired human eyes.\n\nMethods Capsulotomies were performed in 60 cadaver eyes of 30 donors using CCC, Victus Femtosecond Laser, (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, New York, USA) or CAPSULaser, (Excel-Lens, Los Gatos, California, USA). Three pairwise study groups each involved 10 pairs of eyes. Study group 1: SLC eyes compared with fellow eyes with CCC. Study group 2: CCC eyes compared with fellow eyes with FLACS. Study group 3: FLACS eyes compared with fellow eyes with SLC.\n\nA shoe-tree method was used to apply load to the capsulotomy edge, and Instron tensile stress instrument measured distension and threshold load applied to initiate capsule fracture. Relative fracture strengths and distension of CCC, FLACS and SLC were determined. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of capsule edges were reviewed\n\nResults Anterior capsulotomies behave as non-linear elastic (elastomeric) systems when exposed to an external load. The pairwise study demonstrated that the SLC fracture strength was superior to that of CCC by a factor of 1.46-fold with SLC 277±38 mN versus CCC with 190±37 mN. Furthermore, CCC fracture strength was superior to that of FLACS by a factor of 1.28-fold with CCC 186 + 37 mN versus FLACS 145 ± 35 mN (p < 0.001). This was determined by statistical analysis utilising the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test and in accordance with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials guidelines. The capsule edge of SLC on SEM demonstrated a rolled over edge anteriorly and an alteration of collagen.\n\nConclusions The strength of the capsulotomy edge for SLC was significantly stronger than that of CCC which and both were significantly stronger than FLACS. The relative strengths can be explained by SEM of each type of capsulotomy.\n\nAuthors: Sheraz M.

Mordaunt, PhD\n\nPurpose\n\nTo study the effects of anterior capsulotomy diameter and discontinuity on tear threshold load and distension for the technique of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC).\n\nSetting\n\nSingapore National Eye Centre, Singapore, and CapsuLaser Inc., Livermore, California, USA.\n\nDesign\n\nTwo separate randomized pairwise cadaver eye preclinical studies.\n\nMethods\n\nCapsulotomies were performed in 40 cadaver eyes of 20 donors using CCC. The pairwise comparisons were divided into 2 study groups: Study A: Continuous versus discontinuous capsulotomies; Study B: Capsulotomy diameter of 5.0 mm and smaller versus diameters of 5.2 mm and larger. A shoe-tree method was used to apply load to the capsulotomy rim, and the Instron tensile stress instrument measured threshold load and distension to initiate a capsular tear. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were performed to assess statistical superiority.\n\nResults\n\nIn Study Group A, all pairs demonstrated that continuous capsulotomies were better than discontinuous capsulotomies for both the anterior tear threshold load and distension (P < .01). In Study Group B, 80% of the pairs demonstrated that diameters of 5.2 mm and larger were better than those of 5.0 mm and smaller diameter (P < .05).\n\nConclusions\n\nAnterior capsulotomies behave as nonlinear elastic (elastomeric) systems when exposed to an external load and distension. This study demonstrated that continuous circular capsulotomies were more resistant to anterior tears than discontinuous capsulotomies. A point of irregularity or a defect in a capsulotomy rim has a high probability of being the tear initiation point. Furthermore, larger diameter capsulotomies were more resistant to anterior tears than smaller capsulotomies.\n\nLos Gatos, CA – EXCEL-LENS, Inc. announced the CE mark approval of CAPSULaser,\n\na selective laser that creates a capsulotomy during cataract surgery in just over a second. The laser energy is delivered in a continuous manner rather than a pulsed beam which can create tissue bridges.\n\nIn clinical studies CAPSULaser has demonstrated superior consistency compared to manual in creating a capsulotomy that is 100% free-floating and providing 100% 360° IOL coverage.\n\nCAPSULaser offers the surgeon laser precision to pre-select the intended capsulotomy size from 4.5mm to 6.0mm in 0.1mm increments and to utilize the integrated patient fixation beam to center the capsulotomy on the visual axis.\n\nCAPSULaser creates an elastic capsulotomy rim resistant to tearing with a rolled over edge (double thickness), a smooth amorphous collagen rim and a continuous 360° tag free profile. CAPSULaser is a small ergonomic device providing seamless integration into the cataract work flow with no requirement to move the patient as the capsulotomy takes place at the pre-existing OR microscope. CAPSULaser provides a cost and time effective solution to create the ideal capsulotomy with affordable acquisition and running costs, a short and straight forward learning curve and offering a non-invasive procedure with improved visualization throughout the surgery.\n\nEXCEL-LENS, Inc. Chairman & CEO David Mordaunt reported; “I first conceived the idea for CAPSULaser back in 2007. The plan was to create a laser capsulotomy device that would provide both improved patient outcomes and surgeon benefits through its accuracy and simplicity. The journey from conception until today, where we now have approval to directly market in the second largest economic area in the world, has been an exciting journey. I am delighted to be able to announce the CE Marking of CAPSULaser so close to the 36th Congress of ESCRS in Vienna and look forward to meeting with many of the surgeons that have expressed such deep interest in this innovative technology”\n\nBurkhard Dick, Professor of Ophthalmology and Chairman of The University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, stated “CAPSULaser has the great potential to completely replace manual capsulorhexis, the most crucial step in modern cataract surgery.“\n\nSheraz Daya, Chairman and Medical Director of Centre for Sight, East Grinstead, UK added “CAPSULaser I believe will be a very welcome addition to the armamentarium of cataract surgery. With its ease and rapidity of use along with increased capsular edge strength, the device will make cataract surgery faster, reproducible and safer. I can see the device potentially on every operating microscope in the future.”\n\nMr Richard Packard, Arnott Eye Associates, London, UK said; “I was delighted to hear the news that the selective laser device for capsulotomy, CAPSULaser, had received CE mark. This device that has been shown to provide better centred, more accurately sized and circular anterior capsulotomies should help to improve outcomes for cataract and refractive lens exchange surgery. We already know that symmetrical IOL optic coverage reduces posterior capsular opacification. A new generation of IOLs utilising the anterior capsule for fixation may enhance our refractive prediction as well as improving centration of the IOL on the visual axis so important in premium lens implantation.”\n\nDr Pavel Stodulka, Chief Executive Officer of the Gemini Eye Clinic, Czech Republic was the lead surgeon for the CAPSULaser CE study and was the first to use it clinically. He stated “CAPSULaser is a one of the greatest innovations in cataract surgery in the last 10 years. The surgical step performed by CAPSULaser takes only a second and adds precision and safety to cataract surgery.“\n\nComparison of elasticity and fracture strength of manual, femtosecond laser, and selective laser capsulotomies (SLC)\n\nSession Date/Time: Sunday 23/09/2018 | 16:30-18:00\n\nPaper Time: 16:42\n\nVenue: Room A4\n\nMr Sheraz Daya will present results from a 60 cadaver eye study.\n\nResults:\n\nCapsulotomies were performed in 60 cadaver eyes of 30 donors comparing CCC, Victus Femtosecond Laser, (Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) or CAPSULaser, (Excel-Lens, Los Gatos, CA). The pairwise study demonstrates that the SLC fracture strength is superior to that of CCC by a factor of 1.5-fold with SLC 280 + 30 mN vs. CCC with 180 + 35 mN. Furthermore, CCC fracture strength was superior to that of FLACS by a factor of 1.4-fold with CCC 190 + 35 mN vs. FLACS 140 + 20 mN (P < 0.001 as determined by statistical analysis utilizing the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test and in accordance with the CONSORT guidelines). The SLC capsule edge on SEM demonstrated a rolled over edge anteriorly and alteration of collagen.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe strength of the capsulotomy edge for SLC was significantly stronger than that of CCC which in turn was greater than FLACS. The relative strengths can be explained by review of SEM of each type of capsulotomy.\n\nClinical investigation of a new laser device to assess its efficacy and safety for the creation of anterior capsulotomies in cataract patients\n\nSession Date/Time: Sunday 23/09/2018 | 16:30-18:00\n\nPaper Time: 16:48\n\nVenue: Room A4\n\nMr Richard Packard will present results from a 125 patient study.\n\nResults:\n\nFor the 63 eyes in the selective laser capsulotomy group, all treated eyes had 100% free-floating capsulotomies. The mean diameter,, circularity and centration precision of the resultant capsulotomies for the laser group were determined to be superior to the manual group with a statistical p-value < 0.05. In the laser group 86% within 0.1mm of 5.0mm. For the manual group, 44% within 0.1mm (p-value ≤0.0001). There were no capsulotomy or cataract surgery related serious adverse events.\n\nConclusions:\n\nA specially formulated trypan blue was safe and efficacious for staining the anterior capsule and for use with this new continuous laser. The laser was safe and efficacious when used with an intraocular dye for the creation of anterior capsulotomies during cataract surgery with greater sizing and circularity accuracy than can be achieved manually.\n\nBreaking News – EXCEL-LENS receives CE Mark for CAPSULVisc 2% Sodium Hyaluronate, CAPSULVisc 3% Sodium Hyaluronate & CAPSULGel Optical Coupling Gel.\n\nCAPSULVisc 2% sodium hyaluronate has been formulated to provide the ideal cohesive OVD for modern cataract surgery as well as the perfect partner for use with the CAPSULaser system (awaiting CE mark approval)\n\nCAPSULVisc 3% sodium hyaluronate provides enhanced endothelial protection through its dispersive structure and is also formulated for use with the CAPSULaser system (awaiting CE mark approval)\n\nClearly Better…\n\n· Deep Anterior Chamber through exceptional cohesivity\n\n· Outstanding optical clarity for use with CAPSULaser\n\nOptimized Molecular Structure\n\n· Stays in place when you need it – protects the endothelium during phaco\n\n· Ease of removal during I/A\n\nQuality & Peace of Mind\n\n· Non-immunogenic or pyrogenic\n\n· Double sterilized\n\n· Latex free\n\nConvenience\n\n· No need for refrigeration\n\n· Large 1.1 ml syringe format for all stages of the cataract procedure\n\n· Ease of injection – high pseudoplasticity\n\nCAPSULGel 2% Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) is formulated as a coupling gel to act as an optical zone between the cornea and the patient interface lens used with the CAPSULaser system (awaiting CE mark approval)\n\nClarity\n\n· Highly purified & exceptionally transparent HPMC\n\nProtection\n\n· Coats and protects the corneal epithelium during all phases of cataract surgery\n\nQuality & Peace of Mind\n\n· Non-immunogenic or pyrogenic\n\n· Double sterilized\n\n· Latex free\n\nConvenience\n\n· No need for refrigeration\n\n· Large 1.1 ml syringe format for all stages of the cataract procedure"
