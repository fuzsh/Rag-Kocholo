        "text": "During the summer's leadership contest, Penny Mordaunt has emerged as one of the favourites to become the next PM.\n\nFollowing Boris Johnson's resignation, the race to take over as Conservative Party leader saw several MPs battle it out with a few familiar faces in the mix. Some thought Deputy PM Dominic Raab will be the next Prime Minister, but it was likes of Rishi Sunak and Penny Mordaunt who made noise. Though the public were also curious on whether Liz Truss voted leave or remain on Brexit.\n\nAs one of the lesser known candidates, Penny Mordaunt's success has left many asking questions about her, from where she lives and who she's married to, to did Penny Mordaunt vote leave or remain?\n\nDid Penny Mordaunt support Brexit?\n\nPenny Mordaunt supports Brexit and voted leave in the 2016 EU referendum. In fact, she was one of the leading faces of the Leave campaign, and has repeatedly shown herself to be an ardent Brexiteer.\n\nDavid Davis, former Brexit Secretary, spoke about Penny Mordaunt on Talk TV, saying \"On the day we had the huge showdown at Chequers – the one that led to my resignation – she was the best performer. When 20-odd cabinet ministers were supporting Theresa May, she stepped in and bravely defended the Brexit cause – and did in my view the best arguments of the day.\"\n\nWhat has Penny Mordaunt said about Brexit?\n\nAt the World Affairs Council of Atlanta in December last year, Penny Mordaunt described Brexit as a “massive opportunity to anyone who believes in democracy”.\n\nJust like her competitor in the leadership race, Rishi Sunak - who many are also curious to know how he voted on Brexit, as well as his net worth - she has continued to publicly support the UK's withdrawal from the EU, voting against delaying Brexit as well as rejecting the possibility of a second referendum.\n\nHowever, during the lead-up to the EU referendum in 2016, Mordaunt got herself into hot water when speaking to Andrew Marr. The Vote Leave campaign had been using the possibility of Turkey joining the EU as a reason to support Brexit, and Mordaunt claimed that Britain would not be able to stop it. Her comment forced then Prime Minister David Cameron to step in and clarify that the UK would in fact be able to use its veto.\n\nHer views will further be scrutinised when the TV leadership debates take place, which will be crucial to gaining support from the Conservative Party membership in the vote before the next Prime Minister will be announced.\n\nPenny Mordaunt: Background Q&As\n\nWhere is Penny Mordaunt from?\n\nPenny Mordaunt was born in Torquay, Devon, on 4 March 1973, making her 49 years old. She grew up in Portsmouth with her twin brother James, and younger brother, Edward.\n\nShe still lives in the area, and has been the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North since 2010.\n\nWho are Penny Mordaunt's parents?\n\nMordaunt's father served in the parachute regiment and her mother was a special needs teacher at schools in Purbrook.\n\nHer father, John Mordaunt, was born in Hilsea barracks and later in life trained as a teacher, before becoming a youth worker for Hampshire Council. Her mother died of breast cancer when Mordaunt was just fifteen years old.\n\nIs Penny Mordaunt married?\n\nPenny Mordaunt is not currently married, though she has been in the past. While she was a mature student at Reading University, Mordaunt met Paul Murray and the pair were married in 1999. However, they divorced a year later.\n\nSince then, she has been in a relationship with classical singer Ian Lyon, though the pair split in 2016.\n\nWhere did Penny Mordaunt go to school?\n\nPenny Mordaunt went to Oaklands Comprehensive School and sixth form, in Hampshire. She later became the first member of her family to go to university, studying Philosophy at Reading, where she became President of the Students' Union.\n\nPenny Mordaunt: Net worth\n\nLADBible reported that Penny Mordaunt's net worth is around £3.3m. As an MP, Penny Mordaunt receives a salary of £84,144, and as a Minister of State she receives an additional salary of £31,680."
