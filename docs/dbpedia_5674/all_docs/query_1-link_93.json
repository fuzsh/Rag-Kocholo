        "text": "Members of the public in the constituency of Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt are split over whether the Prime Minister’s decision to come home early from the D-Day commemorations in France could affect her chances of being re-elected.\n\nRishi Sunak has apologised and said that “on reflection” he should have stayed in Normandy for a major international ceremony attended by world leaders.\n\nInstead, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron represented the UK Government, while Mr Sunak’s rival for the keys to No 10, Sir Keir Starmer, was also there rubbing shoulders with world leaders.\n\nMs Mordaunt, a Navy reservist, has been left with the job of representing the Conservative Party against deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner, Mr Farage and others in a BBC debate on Friday evening.\n\nShe is one of the prominent figures including Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, Justice Secretary Alex Chalk and former minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg who are projected to lose their seats at the next election.\n\nSpeaking at Ocean Retail Park in Mordaunt’s Portsmouth North constituency, Brian Allen, 83, a retired Post Office engineer from Portsmouth, said of Mr Sunak’s actions: “I think it is very rude to the veterans and also to the other dignitaries who were there.”\n\nHe said it was a “bit too late” for the Prime Minister to apologise.\n\nOn how it might affect Ms Mordaunt, he added: “I don’t think it will affect her at all really. I think she will probably be the Prime Minister when he goes on.”\n\nAaron Wood, 34, a video editor from Portsmouth, said of Mr Sunak’s early return: “It seems a bit off, it feels like his campaign is in a bit of trouble from the off, seems like he’s not in a particularly good position and I think he has not reset himself up enough strongly on such an important date.\n\n“I think they (the veterans) would have every right to feel put out by it.”\n\nOn Ms Mordaunt’s chances, he added: “I think everything Rishi Sunak does affects Penny Mordaunt’s campaign.”\n\nHe added that he would not be voting for her.\n\nDavid Jordan, 72, a retired academic registrar from Portsmouth, said: “He said it was a mistake, I think it was an insult.”\n\nOn Ms Mordaunt’s campaign, he added: “It’s not going to help it, I don’t think, difficult to know, I think she has a pretty strong local following so I think she might hold on to her seat but he’s not helped her.”\n\nHis wife, Colleen Jordan, 69, a psychotherapist, said: “I was shocked, I only heard it this morning, to say it was a mistake, he has enough people around him to not make mistakes.\n\n“I’m so fed up with apologies, they just count for nothing.”\n\nOn Ms Mordaunt, she added: “She’s strong in her own right, she’s a strong character, I’m not a Conservative but she’s done Portsmouth quite proud, I think she’s been a solid MP and I don’t think there’s much love lost between them.”\n\nIan Drew, 59, a full-time Royal Navy reservist from Portsmouth, said: “I think his diary is very very full, under a lot of pressure with the election, he did go there and represent us.\n\n“We don’t know the full details of why he left early so I think until we establish that then we can judge.”\n\nOn Ms Mordaunt’s campaign, he added: “I have my battles with Penny Mordaunt as I lived next to her for a little while.\n\n“I am a staunch Conservative myself but she is one lady I’m not particularly keen on and don’t really trust.\n\n“It might affect the Conservative Party as a whole but I think people have to make their own judgements and conclusions on stuff like that.”\n\nMaggie Ennis, 77, who worked for the HMRC before retiring, said: “He apparently had a good excuse as he had a press conference, I have just listened to it on the news.\n\n“I am not worried either way, David Cameron stood in for him. It’s awkward, he’s very busy at the moment, to me it doesn’t make any difference.”\n\nOn whether it would affect Ms Mordaunt’s campaign, she added: “Well I hope not because she’s brilliant, I hope it hasn’t affected her.”\n\nAnd about Ms Mordaunt appearing in the television debate, Ms Ennis said: “She’s quite eloquent so she’ll cope.”"
