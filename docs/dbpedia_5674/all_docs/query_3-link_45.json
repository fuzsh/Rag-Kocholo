        "text": "The Conservatives have lost a string of senior “big beast” MPs with the party on course to lose power in a historic wipeout.\n\nEight Cabinet ministers have now lost their seats in the general election, beating the previous record of seven Cabinet ministerial defeats in 1997\n\nTory party members in constituencies elsewhere in the country were nervously waiting for votes to be called, with some in the most hotly contested seats going to recount.\n\nThese are the big beast Tories who have lost their seats.\n\nLiz Truss, the shortest serving prime minister in the history of the UK, lost her seat by a narrow margin to Labour’s Terry Jeremy.\n\nThe former foreign secretary, who was late to appear on stage at her count, won 11,217 votes to Labour’s 11,847.\n\nMs Truss was forced to resign her premiership after just 44 days in 2022 in the wake of her disastrous mini-budget, which was blamed for sending interest rates spiralling.\n\nShe is first former Prime Minister to lose her seat since Sir Alec Douglas-Home in 1966.\n\nPrior to becoming prime minister, Ms Truss held several Cabinet roles, including foreign secretary, environment secretary, justice secretary and international trade secretary.\n\nOnce popular with the grassroots, she defeated Rishi Sunak in the first leadership contest of 2022, taking the reins from Boris Johnson.\n\nBut her tenure in Downing Street was brief, with the party turning on her after she spooked the markets by announcing billions of pounds of unfunded tax cuts.\n\nThe ex-prime minister could be seen hugging allies at the declaration for her South West Norfolk seat, but left without making a speech.\n\nGrant Shapps, the former Defence Secretary, was ousted by Labour in Welwyn Hatfield, a constituency he has represented since 2005. Labour won the seat with 19,877 votes. Mr Shapps came second with just over 16,000 votes.\n\nMr Shapps is a veteran of successive Tory governments, having served in six Cabinet roles under four different prime ministers over the past 14 years.\n\nHe was previously transport secretary under Boris Johnson, Tory chairman under David Cameron and home secretary during Ms Truss’ tenure.\n\nConsidered one of the Government’s best communicators, he had also been touted internally as one of the future successors to Mr Sunak as party leader.\n\nMr Shapps first won his Hertfordshire seat in 2005 and achieved a high point majority of 17,500 in 2010, though it declined to 11,000 at the 2019 election.\n\nWelwyn Hatfield is one of a number of commuter belt seats where families moving out of London post-pandemic has contributed to a surge in Labour support.\n\nPenny Mordaunt had been heavily tipped as a future Tory leadership contender, but ended up losing her seat by fewer than 1,000 votes.\n\nThe Commons Leader, a centrist, received 13,715 votes in the Portsmouth North seat, losing to Labour with 14,495 votes.\n\nShe had represented the Conservatives in two recent TV debates and was seen as one of their best public performers.\n\nShe shot to prominence last year after playing a starring ceremonial role at the Coronation which included wielding a giant sword.\n\nA former Navy reservist who comes from a military family, she had represented Portsmouth North since 2010 and won a 15,800 majority at the 2019 election.\n\nJohnny Mercer was defeated by Labour challenger, former Royal marine Fred Thomas.\n\nThe veterans minister, a former Army captain, had served three tours in Afghanistan before he entered politics in 2015, when he won the marginal seat.\n\nHe had an eventful re-election campaign, which included accusing his Labour rival of lying about his military record, something Mr Thomas strongly denied.\n\nAlex Chalk fell victim to a Liberal Democrat surge, losing his seat in Cheltenham after almost ten years.\n\nMax Wilkinson, the Lib Dem candidate, beat the former Justice Secretary with 25,076 votes. Mr Chalk came second with 17,866 votes.\n\nMr Chalk had been the MP for the constituency since 2015. The former barrister had also served as solicitor general and prisons minister.\n\nThe Education Secretary lost by a considerable majority to the Liberal Democrats in Chichester. She won just 13,368 votes to the Lib Dems’ 25,540.\n\nThe seat had been Conservative for 100 years, with Ms Keegan serving as the MP for the constituency since 2017.\n\nThe Education Secretary had assumed her Cabinet role under Rishi Sunak, but had previously served in other more junior government positions.\n\nA Liberal Democrat source said: “School’s out for summer for Gillian Keegan.”\n\nSir Jacob Rees-Mogg lost his seat to Labour challenger Dan Norris by more than 5,000 votes.\n\nOne of the Conservatives’ most recognisable figures, his defeat was described as a “Portillo moment” by Andy Burnham.\n\nHe served as business secretary under Ms Truss and Brexit opportunities minister under Mr Johnson. A traditional low-tax Conservative, he was a key figure in the Vote Leave campaign for Brexit.\n\nThe North East Somerset seat, which he won with a 14,700 majority in 2019, was abolished as part of the boundary review and replaced with a new constituency, including Hanham, a suburb of Bristol, which is believed to have boosted the Labour share of votes.\n\nThe Culture Secretary lost to the Liberal Democrats’ Charlotte Cane in Ely and East Cambridgeshire.\n\nThe Sunak loyalist previously served as minister in the Transport and Justice departments, financial secretary to the Treasury and solicitor general.\n\nBefore being elected as the MP for South East Cambridgeshire in 2015, she worked as a barrister in commercial law.\n\nMichelle Donelan, the Science Secretary, lost out to the Liberal Democrats in Melksham and Devizes, a new seat for 2024.\n\nA former comms manager for the wrestling production company WWE, she famously served as education secretary for less than 48 hours in the dying days of Boris Johnson’s government.\n\nHaving joined the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology at its inception in 2023, she played a big part in Rishi Sunak’s flagship AI summit last autumn, which was hailed by the Government as a big success.\n\nBut she faced calls to resign earlier this year after taxpayers picked up a £15,000 bill for damages to an academic she had accused of expressing sympathy for Hamas.\n\nMark Harper, the Transport Secretary, was defeated by Labour in the Forest of Dean.\n\nA close ally of Mr Sunak, he supported the Prime Minister for the Tory leadership and has served in his Cabinet ever since he took over from Ms Truss.\n\nPrior to becoming an MP, he was a chartered accountant. He has previously served as David Cameron’s chief whip, as well as immigration minister and minister for disabled people.\n\nSeasoned Tory minister Dame Therese Coffey was defeated by Labour in Suffolk Coastal.\n\nA close ally of Ms Truss, she served as deputy prime minister to the former premier, as well as health secretary.\n\nShe was kept on by Mr Sunak as his environment secretary before retiring to the backbenches in November last year, after more than nine years as a minister.\n\nSir Robert Buckland, the former justice secretary, was the first Tory to lose his seat on Thursday night, to Labour’s Heidi Alexander. As a bellwether seat, it was a sign of good news to come for Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nThe former lawyer returned to the Cabinet in July 2022 as Welsh secretary in Boris Johnson’s caretaker government, having held the justice brief from 2019 to 2021. Prior to that, he served as prisons minister and solicitor general.\n\nChief whip Simon Hart managed just third place in the newly created Caerfyrddin constituency, with Plaid Cymru’s Ann Davies taking the top spot.\n\nHe came to Parliament in 2010 with a background in rural affairs as chief executive of the Countryside Alliance and a former master of the South Pembrokeshire Hunt.\n\nA former Welsh secretary, he quit the post in 2022 as pressure mounted on then prime minister Boris Johnson to resign.\n\nSir Simon Clarke, the former Cabinet minister, lost Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland to Labour candidate Luke Myer by a wafer-thin margin of just 214 votes.\n\nA former solicitor, he served as levelling up secretary under Ms Truss and as Mr Sunak’s No 2 at the Treasury.\n\nSir Simon hit the headlines earlier this year when he became the most senior Tory to break ranks and call for Mr Sunak to resign, warning of an electoral “massacre” if the Prime Minister insisted on staying in place.\n\nWriting for The Telegraph, he said that while Mr Sunak had many admirable qualities, he did not “get what Britain needs and he is not listening to what the British people want”.\n\nDamian Green, another former Cabinet minister, lost out to Labour in Ashford after more than two decades in Parliament.\n\nA former journalist, he was made Theresa May’s de facto deputy in 2017, but was forced to resign after a Cabinet Office investigation found he had misled the public and MPs over what he knew about pornography found on an office computer.\n\nMore recently, he has headed up the centrist “One Nation” Tory caucus.\n\nThis file will be kept updated with the latest information as results are announced."
