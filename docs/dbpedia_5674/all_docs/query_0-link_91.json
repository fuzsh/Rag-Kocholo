        "text": "“Confidence without competence is a dangerous combination,” Penny Mordaunt said in June, as Boris Johnson’s days as prime minister were nearing an end. In the wake of the disastrous Liz Truss premiership, that proved more prescient than she could know. Now the Tories are getting a second look the potential leader they passed over this summer.\n\nOn Friday, Mordaunt became the first Tory to declare her candidacy saying she would offer “a fresh start, a united party and leadership in the national interest.” This time around, her role could be pivotal to the outcome of the race."
