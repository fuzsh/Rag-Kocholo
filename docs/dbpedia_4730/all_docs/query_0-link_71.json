See also Australasian Record 75, Nov. 8, 1971, p.14.\n\nParkin died in Auckland, NZ, and is buried in the Waikumete Cemetery there. \"On 15th September news was received from New Zealand of the death, in his 88th year, of Parkin Christian. Having suffered indifferent health for the past few years Parkin departed (Pitcairn) for New Zealand for medical reasons in May 1970, accompanied by his granddaughter Marona and her husband Pervis and two children. During his lifetime Parkin was an active member of the community. When only 17 he was sailing as a crew member on French trading ships plying between Tahiti and neighboring islands. He also sailed aboard two locally owned sailing ships which traded between Pitcairn and Mangareva some 300 miles away in the French Gambier group early in the century. In 1933, Parkin discovered the rudder of H.M.S. Bounty in Bounty Bay, which was later recovered and after remaining on Pitcairn was finally sent to the museum in Suva, Fiji, for safe keeping, where it still remains. He served a term of office as Island Magistrate from 1956-1957. Parkin and his wife Rosa (dec'd) had three children, Marjorie (Deceased), one child died in infancy, and he is survived by Richard (now living in Australia) and many grandchildren - to all of whom we offer our condolences. Prayers were offered for the deceased in the Church on the Sabbath following his death.\"\n\nFrom Roy Clark's diary: Parkin Christian, Man of the Sea:\n\n\"The sea is in his blood, and its call has made of him a natural seaman with an uncanny intuition for predicting weather conditions and navigating among these islands. There is a confidence in Parkin's judgment greater than in the chart or compass, whatever the distance from land. Many the time have I seen him defy the written laws of navigation, and those who command our longboats have learned, sometimes through bitter experience, to heed his advice - even though it disagrees with chart and compass. Quite and unassuming, he tells of sea experiences of the past as he lounges with seeming indifference in the stern of the boat; but his eyes miss nothing of his surroundings. He sees the set of the sail and jib, the coloring of the sky, the shifting of the wind, the clouds above and out on the horizon, the pitch of the boat as it makes five or six knots in a good, steady wind or a barely perceptible headway in a light breeze. There have been a few times when the course for Oneo or Henderson was given by the captains of the boats as they left Bounty Bay, and steadily kept until the mileage for the island has been run; and yet land was not sighted and the boats have had to give up their search for it and return to Pitcairn. But this has not been so when Parkin was amongst the crew making the trip. I recall one of the many times I have sailed with Parkin to Oeno Island as proof of his intuitive judgment at sea. Someone of the crew calls out to the coxswain, 'How we heading', Charles?' The coxswain looks intently at his compass box and calls back, 'Northwest by north, and headin' right for land.' Parkin lifts his body from its reclining position and looks seaward - first to windward and then to lee of the boat. He scans the sea in all directions for a minute or two - looks up at the sails, and then again to the sea astern of the longboat. His decision has been made. He speaks, 'Wal now, I don't care what yawli tul (all of you say), and I ain't going by that no-use compass either; and believe me if you like, for land is homusa out ahead (not nearly). Yawli look where I'm pointin'. I'll bet land's there,' and he points a little to windward - his arm strong and steady, his eyes ablaze with certainty. Then he again settles down to his former position in the stern of the boat to doze off to sleep or continue his story telling. Two or three hours pass by, then the man on the lookout calls 'Land ahead!' The course has been changed according to the pointing of Parkin's finger. He rises unconcernedly from his uncomfortable resting place and sees the distant land. With pleased satisfaction he remarks, 'There, I told you so. If we only follow that good for nothing compass we would be dead as a hatchet.' (For some reason, on Pitcairn, a hatchet is considered a more likely comparison than a doornail.)\"\n\nChristian, Peggy, Lareau, thePeerage.com\n\nPeggy Christian was born on Pitcairn Island in 1815.

In addition to making cabinets and small, trick boxes, he also made many of the boxes in which Pitcairn oranges were crated and put aboard ships for sale in New Zealand, or other countries. Although he was a craftsman of considerable skill, Loeffler was not a popular man on Pitcairn. A correspondent in Tahiti asked Pitcairner Lincoln Clark, “How are you good people taking up with that man Loeffler? If you can get along with him it shows your goodness and kindness of heart, for if ever there was a mean, contemptible fellow, Loeffler is that man.” Clark responded, “Loeffler came here and [has] never done one good turn for any of the people. He growled at his food. He growled at his lodgings. He scoffed at our religion, never came to church, and died as he lived, a heathen. But he was a good cabinet maker. He instituted [instructed?] in the making of boxes. Some of the [Pitcairn] men said I could make ‘em same as Loeffler, but that was a story. We hollowed ours [boards] out of a sawed off block. He made his out of sawed strips. He had these small carpenter’s wood clamps. We had none, so did the best we could with the tools we had.

She was Fletcher Christian's consort. We do not know when Mauatua was born, but she claimed to remember Cook's first arrival in Tahiti (1769), so she must have been at least twenty-three or twenty-four when the Bounty arrived in 1788. There is no evidence that Christian had a serious attachment to her before the mutiny (in fact, it is unlikely), but she did follow him both to Tubuai and later to Pitcairn. When the loyalists and half of the mutineers had gone ashore on Tahiti on September 22, 1789, Christian left the island the same night. The reason was that Mauatua had found out about a plot among the Tahitians to overpower the nine mutineers and take over the ship (the plot may even have been incited by one or more loyalists, although Morrison does not mention anything about it). If she had not learned about the scheme, or had not told Christian, the Bounty story could have had a very different ending and Pitcairn might not be inhabited today. Mauatua bore Christian two sons, Thursday October and Charles, before he was murdered on Massacre Day, September 20, 1793, and one daughter, Mary Anne, born after his death. When Christian died, Mauatua became Edward Young's consort (actually she shared him with Toofaiti) and bore him three children: Edward, Polly, and Dorothea. Mauatua survived the disastrous attempt to migrate to Tahiti in 1831, but saw her first-born child, Thursday October, succumb to the diseases then rampant there to which the Pitcairners had no immunity. She herself died on Pitcairn ten years later (September 19, 1841) of an epidemic brought by a visiting ship. Of the original settlers on the Island, she was survived only by Teraura.
