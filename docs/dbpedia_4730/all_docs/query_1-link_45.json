        "text": "“Her lower register has become ever-richer toned, yet fluid, while higher up her silken soprano remains undiminished . . . Fleming is utterly ravishing in Ravel’s Shéhérazade, and her performance of Messiaen’s Poémes pour Mi is sensational . . . Here is a singer with the sumptuousness, character and burnished luminosity this score demands. Her control at the end of ‘L’épouse’ is effortless, yet there is no holding back, with fire and steel where needed . . . Fleming is simply intoxicating.”\n\nBBC Music Magazine, May 2012 (CD review: “Poèmes”)\n\nOne of the most beloved and celebrated musical ambassadors of our time, soprano Renée Fleming captivates audiences with her sumptuous voice, consummate artistry, and compelling stage presence as she continues to grace the world’s leading opera stages and concert halls, now extending her reach to include other musical forms and media. She has appeared with all the major orchestras of Europe and North America and collaborated with such renowned conductors as Daniel Barenboim, Christoph Eschenbach, Valery Gergiev, Bernard Haitink, James Levine, the late Sir Charles Mackerras, Zubin Mehta, Seiji Ozawa, Sir Antonio Pappano, André Previn, Christian Thielemann, Michael Tilson Thomas and the late Sir Georg Solti.\n\nRenée Fleming was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in Rochester, New York. Her parents were both teachers of singing, and music formed part of her upbringing. She went on to study at the Juilliard School, holds degrees from the State University of New York at Potsdam and the Eastman School of Music, and was a Fulbright Scholar for study in Germany. Early awards include the 1988 Metropolitan Opera National Auditions, the Richard Tucker Award, and the George London Prize. The soprano’s breakthrough came in 1988 when she made her debut as the Countess in Mozart’s Le nozze de Figaro. Further signature roles include Desdemona in Verdi’s Otello, Violetta in Verdi’s La traviata, the title roles in Dvořák’s Rusalka, Massenet’s Manon and Thaïs and Richard Strauss’s Arabella, Countess Madeleine in Capriccio and the Marschallin in Der Rosen­kavalier.\n\nRenée Fleming is also a champion of new music and performed in the world premiere of John Corigliano’s The Ghosts of Versailles at the Metropolitan Opera, sang in the first performances of Floyd’s Susannah at the Met and the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and created the role of Blanche in the world premiere of André Previn’s A Streetcar Named Desire with the San Francisco Opera. She also gave the world premiere of the song cycle Le Temps l’horloge, written for her by Henri Dutilleux, with Seiji Ozawa at the Saito Kinen Festival in Japan in 2007.\n\nIn 2009 Fleming performed Messiaen’s Poèmes pour Mi at the New York Philharmonic’s Opening Night Gala welcoming new Music Director Alan Gilbert. On New Year’s Eve of 2010 she was Hanna Glawari with the Dresden Staatskapelle under Christian Thielemann at the Semperoper. Some highlights of 2011: Rossini’s Armida, Strauss’s Capriccio and Handel’s Rodelinda at the Met, Verdi’s Otello in Paris, and Donizetti’s Lucrezia Borgia in San Francisco. 2012 brought a new role to her repertoire, Strauss’s Ariadne, which she sang with the Dresden Staatskapelle under Thielemann at the Baden-Baden Festival, as well as Verdi’s Desdemona at the Met, and Strauss’s Arabella in Paris.
