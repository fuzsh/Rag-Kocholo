        "text": "MEET US\n\nExecutive Director\n\nRobert Kwalick\n\nRobert’s connection to Bantam Cinema over the past ten years looks like this-\n\n1) Friday or Saturday night with no rehearsals, shows or work obligations?\n\n2) Is it earlier than 7pm?\n\n3) What’s playing at the Bantam Cinema?\n\nA long time lover of independent, art house and foreign films, not afraid to admit his love for all things David Lynch, Robert has many fond memories of exploring small independent movie theatres in cities he’s visited, seeing films he would not have otherwise heard about (Ruby in Paradise and Come Early Morning, both starring Ashley Judd, Mike Leigh’s Life is Sweet and Gas Food Lodging for instance).\n\nHe has seen the classics of silent, experimental, foreign and art house cinema, primarily, until now, for his own education and enrichment, but has always thought running an independent movie theatre would be a terrific adventure. He used the pandemic to catch up on his film-viewing, seeing over 200 titles including works by Truffaut, Godard, Renois, Breton, Bergman, Kurosawa, and Fellini, everything Spike Lee has directed, and films from Japan, China, and Korea.\n\nA former Arts Department Chair at Forman School and board member for the Goshen Players, Robert holds a BA in Communications, an MFA in Acting, and a Graduate Certificate in Arts Administration. He volunteered with several local arts and social service nonprofits to enhance his skillset and parlay his many years of running independent school theater programs into working with a nonprofit arts organization, and is an avid participant in and supporter of the local performing and fine arts scene.\n\nRobert has a cousin who is an IATSE prop maker and set dresser for movies and television, another that is a First Assistant Cameraman in California, and another that is an aspiring cinematographer in France. A seasoned performing artist and director, Robert was able to check “being in a movie” off of his bucket list when he appeared as an extra in the locally-filmed Brilliant Mistakes by Paul Brighton. He next appeared for three consecutive years in the “Forman Makes a Movie” projects, spearheaded by local independent filmmaker Sean Kelly. They include The Imperfect Score, Puzzlehead, and There’s Something Wrong with Katie.\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nEthan J Antonucci\n\nEthan J. Antonucci was born in Torrington, Connecticut, six weeks after the release of the original Star Wars movie and raised across the street from the world-famous Bantam Cinema.\n\nEthan is currently the Executive Vice President of BLB, Inc., David Benioff & Dan Weiss’ production company, with an overall deal at Netflix. He started working with the creators of Game of Thrones on the fifth season. He spent several years in the writers’ room and is a credited writer on season eight.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1999 to work in the entertainment industry and now has two decades of Hollywood experience under his belt. Starting in The Gersh Agency mailroom he learned the business and became one of the youngest literary agents to ever work at the company.\n\nAfter the birth of his son, Ethan switched gears and went to work for one of the largest entertainment law firms in the business. He parlayed these experiences into his job working with Benioff & Weiss.\n\nAll of his education was completed in the Nutmeg State and includes a double degree in Journalism and Communications from the University of Connecticut. His 1999 senior year was highlighted by his Sports Editorship at the UConn Daily Campus, which enabled him to bounce around the country and cover the school’s first men’s basketball NCAA Championship. You don’t even have to ask; Ethan will tell you all about it within minutes of meeting him.\n\nEthan is the Co-Vice President of the Board of Directors, a member of the Internal Affairs Committee and Co-Chair of the Programming Task Force for the Bantam Cinema & Arts Center. He lives with his wife Aimee and son Cortland in West Hollywood, California.\n\nHeadshot Photo Credit: Joel Berti\n\nJudy Auchincloss\n\nJudy Auchincloss began her real estate career in Litchfield County in1991. She has consistently been one of the top producing brokers in the area. By listening carefully, finding mutually agreeable solutions, and satisfying her clients' needs she has realized many successes.\n\nWhen representing sellers Judy is realistic and aggressive, and for buyers she is understanding and persuasive. She uses these skills as she brokers residential and commercial deals that span the real estate spectrum from the modest to the grandiose. As one of her customer’s, former president of one of New York’s leading cultural organizations, said of her, “ for what can often be a stressful business, she is warm, relaxed, funny, and will see to it that you will be well taken care of.”\n\nJudy has also used her considerable persuasive skills to benefit local organizations and has been part of the Washington community since 1983. As a former trustee of Rumsey Hall School where she served on the board for 18 years, she was a founder of the annual auction in 1985, which became enormously successful and has raised many millions of dollars since then. As a recent past board member for over a decade of ASAP, the After School Arts Program, her talent for fund raising events was also a success. She is also a long time member of the Washington Club.\n\nJudy lives in New Preston with her faithful Fox Red Lab Bogey and relishes her family time and most especially her six year old grandson Dakota. While devoted and passionate about her career she still finds time for reading, movies, travel and skiing.\n\nKennedy Cogan\n\nLori Fineman\n\nLori Fineman is an independent theatrical producer with numerous projects in development for regional theaters and Broadway. From 2007-2019, Lori was the Executive Director of Transport Group, a non-profit off-Broadway theater company in New York City.

She serves on the board of directors for Transport Group, the National Alliance of Musical Theatre (NAMT), and on the advisory board to the Jewish Community Project (JCP) Downtown.

Cleve, a native, only developed a deep appreciation of them, however, after spending many years in other places (boarding school: Avon Old Farms; college: Williams; travel: Europe; and business: 15 years in Asia). After returning home in mid-life, he has spent more than 40 years in real estate and volunteered for several dozen positions in professional, non-profit, and government organizations.\n\nInvolvement in Bantam Cinema’s rejuvenation brings Cleve full circle. Seeing films there as a child had a major influence on his life and more than 70 years of wonderful experiences at the theater inspired him to help make the same opportunities available to all those who might get as much reward from one of Litchfield’s irreplaceable treasures as he has. Cleve serves a co-Vice-President, member of the External Affairs and Governance Committees.\n\nBurke Gibney\n\nMark Halloran\n\nNadine Kim\n\nNadine Kim was born and raised in southern California but now considers herself an honorary Northeasterner and Brooklynite, having lived on the East Coast for the past two decades.

She has 20 years of financial services experience spanning the buy side, equity research and consulting.\n\nShe is an active supporter of several Brooklyn community organizations which are near and dear to her heart, including serving as a Governor of the Heights Casino, and a Board Member of the Kings County Tennis League, whose mission is to support children in Brooklyn’s underserved communities through tennis and education, and is a former member of the Advisory Board of Grace Church School. As a daughter of an artist, art has always been an important and ever-present component of her life, and she is excited to have an opportunity to help further BCAC’s unique mission. She received a BA in International Studies from Johns Hopkins University and an MBA from Columbia Business School.\n\nShe lives in Brooklyn Heights with her husband Mikael and two children Henrik (9) and Daphne (8), and having explored Litchfield for the last ten years as a guest, is pleased to now have a permanent base in Litchfield from which to explore this incredible community.\n\nJamie Marcoux\n\nJamie Marcoux (Nivolo) has lived in Litchfield County her whole life. She attended Litchfield Public Schools and graduated from UCONN with a Communications Degree in 2000. She works at Klemm Real Estate as both their office manager and as a real estate agent – she has been with the firm since 1999.
