        "text": "Amber Heard marked her 38th birthday with a celebratory toast, sharing a rare glimpse into her festivities on Instagram.\n\nThe 'Aquaman' actor posted a photo of herself enjoying a glass of Champagne in an elegant wine cellar, captioning the image with \"Champagne kind of birthday\" along with pink heart emojis.\n\nIn the picture, Heard looked chic in a shimmering gold turtleneck sweater, accessorized with delicate gold rings, a gold Apple Watch, and stylish stud earrings. Her makeup was understated yet glamorous, complemented by clear nail polish for the occasion.\n\nThe details of Heard's birthday celebration remain undisclosed, leaving it unclear who she shared the special day with.\n\nHeard's recent Instagram post contrasts with her previous activity, as she last shared a photo in January featuring her daughter, Oonagh Paige. The touching throwback snapshot depicted Heard bottle-feeding Oonagh, born in April 2021, on the set of 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom'.\n\nWhat has life been like for Heard since the trial?\n\nIn July 2021, Page Six revealed that Heard had welcomed Oonagh via surrogate after discovering she couldn't conceive naturally. Heard expressed immense love for her daughter, honoring her late mother by giving Oonagh the middle name Paige.\n\nThe birth of Oonagh came nearly a year after Heard's high-profile defamation trial against her ex-husband, Johnny Depp, which she lost in June 2022. Depp had sued Heard for $50 million in 2019, alleging defamation following a 2018 Washington Post op-ed about abuse.\n\nDespite Heard's $100-million countersuit, she was ordered to pay Depp $10 million in compensatory damages plus $350,000 in punitive damages.\n\nFollowing the trial, Heard has maintained a low profile, selling her California home and relocating to Spain with her daughter. Reports suggested she had stepped away from Hollywood, although Heard refuted this claim.\n\n\"I keep moving forward. That's life,\" during a local interview in May 2023."
