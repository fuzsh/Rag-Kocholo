        "text": "It is now a quarter of a century since we last heard from Grantleigh Manor. That was the day that the indomitable Audrey fforbes-Hamilton, the dispossessed Lady of the Manor, finally got round to marrying Richard Devere, her usurper and supermarket tycoon of Czechoslovakian stock.\n\nAs you may or may not remember, at the time of their marriage their positions had suddenly reversed when a timely inheritance restored Audrey to the Manor at the very moment when Richard’s business fortunes had hit rock bottom.\n\nEver since they have been man and wife there has been a total news blackout on the goings–on at Grantleigh Manor, whereas before the intimate details of their stormy courtship had been played out with such discretion and secrecy that only 25 million television viewers knew the first thing about it.\n\nDid Richard manage to keep his bride in the manner to which she was born? Who wears the trousers? Did Richard ever recover his fortunes and continue his high-rolling lifestyle or has he settled for the more humdrum existence of a gentleman farmer?\n\nHave the Deveres prospered or merely survived? Does Audrey continue to dominate the neighbourhood as of old and hold out against all things modern? Marjory, The Rector, where are they now? What happened to Brabinger and old Mrs Polouvicka? And is there anyone new in their lives?\n\nFrom this vantage point, she keeps a close and disapproving eye on the estate's new owner, the nouveau-riche Richard DeVere, a wholesale foods magnate of Czech descendent.\n\nA vehicle for Keith following her success in The Good Life, there was certainly a hint of Margo Leadbetter about Audrey. However, she was an altogether more complicated character.\n\nAt times, she could appear a bully, keeping mousy friend Marjory on a tight rein. She was self-confident to the point of arrogance, and insistent her family's way of doing things was maintained.\n\n\"We don't spend our Sundays driving to the nearest lay-by for a barbecue,\" she rails at Richard. \"There are 1001 jobs I've noticed that need doing, and someone's got to give the instructions!\"\n\nHowever, despite her bombastic nature, a lot of the show's jokes are at Audrey's expense. She's essentially a tragic character, constantly tormented by what's she's lost, and she's not without her warmer side - an aspect of her personality that grows over the show's three series, as she's ultimately won over by the interloper.\n\nThe last episode of the final series sees things satisfyingly resolved, with Audrey marrying Richard and being reinstated as the lady of the manor."
