        "text": "Daphne Jane Behan, 49, of Petoskey, died October 13, 2021 at her home, surrounded by her loving family, after a long battle with cancer.\n\nDaphne was born on February 25, 1972, the daughter of Harold and Jane (Wolford) Frenger. She was raised in Bremen, Indiana, and graduated high school in 1990.\n\nShe moved to Petoskey in 2005 and started working at Timber Tech as a graphic designer.\n\nOn December 12, 2012, she married Steve Behan. Together, they enjoyed hunting, fishing, and camping. She loved driving off-road in her Jeep or side-by-side. It was uncommon to see her without a smile. She was upbeat, positive and spunky. Her outgoing and happy nature was contagious. She will be deeply missed.\n\nShe is survived by her husband, Steve Behan; her son, Jordan (Ashley) Enders of Petersburg, MI; step-children, Steven (Danielle) Behan of South Lyon, MI and Taylor (Brandon Carson) Behan of Petoskey; grandchildren, Aviana and Liliana Enders and Kendall Behan; mother, Jane (Dave) Whiteman; father, Harold (Janie) Frenger; brothers, Adam (Mary) and Anthony; sister, Laurie (Alex); and many cousins, nieces, nephews, aunts and uncles.\n\nThere will be a visitation at Stone Funeral Home on Tuesday, October 19, 2021 from 6:00 â€“ 8:00 p.m. A private family memorial service will take place at a later date.\n\nFriends and family wishing to make a charitable donation, in memory of Daphne, are encouraged to consider the American Cancer Society.\n\nArrangements are in the care of Stone Funeral Home, Inc."
