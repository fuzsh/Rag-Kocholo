I guess I am just looking for suggestions....something that sounds nice with my daughter's name, Daphne. If its a girl, she will be named Ivy, but a boy....????\n\nWe're not really into super popular names, although I do like Luke or Lucas or Evan.\n\nAnyway, if you've got a nice boy's name, let me hear it! Thanks!"
