        "text": "Daphne & Jessica were exactly who we needed to photograph our wedding! We wanted to have some nice posed photos, but to spend most of the time on candids, and she found a way to make sure we were able to get the shots we wanted! She is also very good at keeping everyone calm and organized, while still being kind and friendly.\n\nOn top of all of that, the photos are spectacular! Her editing style is exactly what we were looking for, with a light and ethereal feel, and there is a ton of variety. It was really hard choosing our favorites! 10/10 experience all around!\n\nA long time friend got married and her pictures were phenomenal.. I had to ask and that's how I found Daphne. Luckily for me she was available for my wedding the following year (September 2019). My now husband and I have zero experience with posing, are extremely awkward in \"romantic atmospheres\", and typically babble while uncomfortable, which she found out during our engagement shoot. This was not an issue for Daphne. She is easy to talk to, easy to work with, provides/takes suggestions, and encourages the goofiness of real life. That's what drew me to her in the first place. She doesn't do the cheesy wedding photos that everyone has. Her pictures are real and show the true beauty of the moment. Her pictures are soft, warm, romantic, and whimsical. It's the perfect style. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't change one thing, especially not my photographer. I have her to thank for showing us the true us and capturing the beauty of our day.\n\n“As a photographer myself, I’m pretty picky about who was going to take my family’s portrait. It’s something I had been trying to figure out for almost a year. In my head, I knew the style of editing and the sort of shots I’d want but figured I’d have to hire somebody from out of state to get this specific look. Then one day, I was tagged in a post in a local group for somebody looking for a photographer. Looking at the names of the other photographers tagged, I recognized all but one. I had never heard of “Daphne Laput” so I figured she was a brand new amateur at best. When I landed on her page my jaw dropped. Not only was she good, she was worlds better than me. I stalked her and found that she’s been featured by a major lifestyle photography publication. When I reached out to her, I fully expected her to be so outside of my budget. I could have cried when I found out she wasn’t! The months leading up to our session we chatted and planned together. She’s so easy to talk to and accessible. The day of my session my kids were wild. Daphne took it in stride. She was professional but warm. She gave just the right amount of direction, making sure we looked our best while staying true to ourselves. Her turn around time was great and she posted lots of sneak peeks. My friends and family LOVE our photos! And of course I’m obsessed. I’m already planning our next session! Thank you Daphne!”"
