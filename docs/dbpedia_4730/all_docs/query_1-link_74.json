        "text": "Name Origin Meaning\n\nBeatrice Latin “She who brings happiness” Beatrice is only in the 800s but don’t expect it to stay there long. I’ve heard this name thrown around a lot here recently on the forums and I expect Beatrice will be making a comeback. It needs to. It has a classic feel with literary, via Shakespeare and Dante, and royal namesakes. Bea is a nice nickname and Trixie is just cute. Although, if you want Trixie, that’s easier to pull of with the Beatrix spelling (a la Beatrix Potter.) Variations Include: Bea, Beah, Beat, Beata, Beatie, Beatris, Beatriss, Bee, Bice, Trix, Trixi, Trixie, Trixy\n\nCalera Spanish “Limestone” Calera has a pretty feminine sound with the possibility of a masculine nickname, Cal, which is something I’ve seen mother looking for recently. Personally, if I were to choose a nickname for it, I would choose Cali.\n\nChelsea English “Chalk Landing Place” Chelsea is a little dated as it was it’s most popular in the early nineties. People still use it, though, as it’s still in the 200s. The best thing about it, in my opinion, is the variations in the name itself and it’s nicknames. I’d use Lea. Variations Include: Chelce, Chelcee, Chelcey, Chelci, Chelcie, Chelcy, Chelese, Chelesia, Chelli, Chellie, Chellise, Chellsie, Chelsa, Chelsae, Chelsah, Chelsay, Chelse, Chelseah, Chelsee, Chelsei, Chelseigh, Chelsey, Chelsi, Chelsia, Chelsie, Chelssey, Chelssie, Chelssy, Chelsy, Chelsye, Cheslea, Cheslee, Chesley, Cheslie, Chessea, Chessie\n\nClio Greek Mythology “fame/glory” Clio is the name of the ancient Greek mythological muse of history, one that is rich with modern charm and would make an intriguing choice. I also like the spelling Cleo.\n\nCordova Spanish? “From Cordoba” This is the only meaning/origin I can find for this one, so if any one has anything more definitive, feel free to chime in. I like this because it is an alternative to Cordelia, in my opinion. I don’t like Cordelia because of her sad story, but this name sounds very similar. I see a lot of people wanted to use Cordelia for the Cordie nickname (which is weird, in my opinion) and this name offers that too. Personally, I would use Dove as a nickname for this.\n\nDaphne Greek “laurel tree” In Greek mythology, Daphne was a nymph that Apollo feel in love with. He chased her until she couldn’t take it anymore and begged the gods to help her. She was changed into a laurel tree, and Apollo, in love with her, proclaimed her tree the most beautiful and made it his sacred tree. Kings wore the laurel branches. Daphne is still hovering in the 400s, but I’ve heard it thrown around a lot. It’s a very pretty name.\n\nDora Greek “gift” In Greek mythology, Dora is a short form of Pandora, the woman who was given the gift of a jar filled with the earth’s bad things. Dora could come back along with Flora and Cora, but I prefer it to be a nickname for Dorothy, Theodora, or Pandora.\n\nElberta English “highborn, shining” This is a little old lady to me. If you want an older sounding, mature name but with a cute nickname, this could possibly work. It does have the popular nickname Ellie. Variations Include: Elbertha, Elberthe, Elberthina, Elberthine, Elbertina, Elbertine\n\nEva Hebrew “life” Eva is very simple and classic, but getting very popular (along with Eve and Ava). I think Eva is a pretty name, but I prefer a longer form with this as a nickname. Example, Genevieve nn Eva or Evita nn Eva. Variations Include: Eba, Ebba, Eeva, Evah, Evalea, Evalee, Eve, Evelin, Evelina, Evelyn, Evita, Evlyn, Éva\n\nFlorence Latin “Flourishing, prosperous” This is another one I’ve seen thrown around a lot. I actually like Florence despite its older feel. Maybe it’s Florence and the Machine that’s given it such a boost here recently, I don’t know, but with the cute nickname Flora or Ren, I like it. Variations Include: Flo, Florance, Florella, Florentina, Florentine, Florentyna, Florian, Florice, Florie, Florina, Florinda, Florine, Floris, Florrance, Florrie, Florry, Florynce, Floss, Flossey, Flossie, Flossy\n\nGeraldine German/French “ruler with the spear” I actually think Geraldine is ready for a comeback. I have a cousin Gerald, so why not Geraldine? It has a pretty sound with a masculine nickname, Gerry. Variations Include: Deena, Dina, Dyna, Geraldeen, Geraldene, Geraldyna, Geraldyne, Geralyn, Geralynne, Gerdene, Gerdine, Geri, Gerianna, Gerianne, Gerilynn, Gerri, Gerrie, Gerrilee, Gerrilyn, Gerroldine, Gerry, Jeraldeen, Jeraldene, Jeraldine, Jeralee, Jere, Jeri, Jerilene, Jerrie, Jerrileen, Jerroldeen, Jerry\n\nHelena Greek “bright, shining one” Helena has a soft spot in me. It has some Shakespeare cred, he used it in All’s Well that Ends Well and Midsummer’s night Dream, Helena was historically the mother of Constantine the Great, and Helena Bonham Carter is a great actress. The only real issue with this name is that people tend to pronounce it differently. I like HELL – en-uh and other people like hell-AY-nuh and still others like hell-EEN-uh.\n\nKimberly Old English “Cyneburg’s Field” Kimberly was at it’s most popular in the seventies and eighties, but I like it actually. Mostly, I like it for the nickname Kimber. Variations Include: Cymberly, Cymbre, Kim, Kimba, Kimbely, Kimber, Kimbereley, Kimberely, Kimberlee, Kimberleigh, Kimberley, Kimberli, Kimberlie, Kimberlin, Kimberlyn, Kimbery, Kimblyn, Kimbria, Kimbrie, Kimbry, Kimmie, Kimmy, Kym, Kymberleigh, Kymberley, Kymberly, Kymbra, Kymbrely\n\nLanett Welsh Variant “Idol/Nymph or Linett, a small songbird” This is a variant of the Welsh names Eluned, Lana, Lanetta, Lanette, Linette, and Lynette. I’ve always thought Lanette/Lynette was a pretty name. With this spelling, you get the nicknames Laney, Lane, or Nettie.\n\nMargaret Greek “Pearl” Margaret is a classic name with a history of use for Queens and Saints. I love the nickname Maggie and that definitely spices up this older sounding name. Variations Include: Madge, Mag, Maggi, Maggie, Maggy, Mago, Maiga, Maisie, Maisy, Mamie, Marcheta, Marchieta, Maretha, Maretta, Margalo, Margaretha, Margarethe, Margarett, Margaretta, Margarette, Margarit, Margarite, Marge, Margeretta, Margerette, Margerie, Margery, Marget, Margetta, Margette, Margey, Marghanita, Margharita, Margherita, Marghretta, Margiad, Margies, Margize, Margred, Margreth, Margrett, Margrid, Marguita, Margy, Marjery, Marjey, Marji, Marjie, Marjorie, Markie, Markita, Meg, Meggi, Meggy, Metta, Meyta, Peg, Peggi, Peggie, Peggy\n\nRosa Latinate Variation “Rose” Rosa is one of the simplest variations on Rose. It is a classic Spanish/Italian name and popular in Britain in the upperclass right now. I find it pretty and simple, but not my favorite Rose variation. It does have the great namesake Rosa Parks though.\n\nSylvania Latin “Of the forest” This is a feminine form of the Latin god Sylvanus, the god of the Forests. This think this is just gorgeous! Sylvia and Sylvie as ok, but with Sylvania, you can have either as a nickname and still have a longer, beautiful, sophisticated form.\n\nTriana Latin “third” This is a very pretty name too. Tiana seems to be gaining in popularity because of the new Disney movie “The Princess and the Frog” so why can’t Triana? I think it has a lovely sound and Tria is a very cute nickname.\n\nVestavia ????? I couldn’t actually find anything for this, so if anyone knows where this word comes from, please comment. As far as using it as a name, I think it has an interesting sound and could definitely work! Vesper would be a cute nickname for it. It sounds a lot like Octavia, so that gives it some credit in my book.\n\nVina Spanish “Vineyard” Vienna is a popular modern choice, but I think I prefer Vina by itself. Short and sweet with a pretty sound related to Mina. if you wanted a longer form, I would suggest Vinette or Vinita. Variations Include: Veena, Veina, Vena, Vinetta, Vinette, Vinia, Vinica, Vinita, Vinya, Vyna, Vynetta, Vynette"
