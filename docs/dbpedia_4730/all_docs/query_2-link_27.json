        "text": "Fans and stars from the world of entertainment are paying tribute to actor Peter Bowles, who has died at the age of 85 following a battle with cancer.\n\nThe actor, who starred in TV series including The Avengers and The Saint, is fondly remembered for his role as Richard DeVere in the popular 1970s comedy To The Manor Born.\n\nTo The Manor Born proved hugely popular with audiences and received rave ratings, becoming one of the most watched TV series of the decade.\n\nThe much-loved BBC sitcom follows the trials and tribulations of Audrey fforbes-Hamilton - an upper-class woman who, upon the death of her husband, has to move out of her beloved manor house to the estate's old lodge.\n\nHer beloved manor is then bought by Richard DeVere - a quirky millionaire supermarket owner originally from Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe feuding pair endure a love-hate relationship throughout the series as they bicker over the manor and the way in which it should be run - before eventually tying the knot in the final episode.\n\nAlong with Peter Bowles, the legendary sitcom featured talented stars including Penelope Keith, Daphne Heard and Michael Bilton.\n\nTo pay tribute to Peter Bowles, Daily Star takes a look at what the stars of To The Manor Born got up to when the sitcom ended, and where they are now.\n\nPenelope Keith\n\nFollowing on from her stint in BBC’s The Good Life, Penelope bagged the lead of Audrey fforbes-Hamilton in To The Manor Born.\n\nHer portrayal of the snobby upper-class character catapulted her to international fame, as the much-loved sitcom attracted over 20 million viewers worldwide.\n\nWhen the series came to an end in 1981, Penelope continued on her TV reign, bagging the lead role in six other sitcoms including Sweet Sixteen, Moving, Executive Stress, No Job for a Lady, Law and Disorder and Next of Kin.\n\nShe also nabbed the starring role in a TV adaptation of Agatha Christie's play Spider's Web, and she won her second BAFTA award as Best Actress in 1978 for her stellar appearance in The Norman Conquests.\n\nNow, the 81-year-old still dabbles in acting work, and in 2018 she took to the stage to play Mrs St Maugham in the Chichester Festival Theatre production of Enid Bagnold's The Chalk Garden.\n\nPenelope lives a happy life with her husband Rodney Timpson, who she married in 1978.\n\nThe pair, who live in Surrey, adopted two children, in their early years of marriage.\n\nPeter Bowles\n\nPeter Bowles, 84, is most well-known for his role as Richard DeVere which made him a household name across the UK.\n\nHe also reached comedy success in other shows including Only When I Laugh, The Bounder and Executive Stress.\n\nSpeaking about his success in sitcoms to The Mirror and the affect it had on his career, he said: \"If you have a great popular TV success, particularly in comedy, people don’t think you can act on stage.\n\n\"People thought I was just a sitcom actor and the BBC told me I’d never work in drama again. I didn’t realise there were two worlds. It was new to me. I found it very odd and frustrating.\"\n\nPeter famously turned down the role of Jerry in The Good Life – a role which could have benefitted him greatly, but the actor previously told that he wanted to move away from comedy acting and concentrate on more serious roles.\n\nAfter he took a break from TV acting, Peter dipped his toe into the world of film.\n\nThe English star has featured in many films including Live Now, Pay Later, The Informers, Three Hats for Lisa, and Eyewitness.\n\nPeter won ITV Personality of the Year in 1983, and the same year, he was also rewarded with the Male Comedy Star Award.\n\nHe then went onto win the Golden Gate Award in 1993, and most recently in 2016, he made an epic return to the small screen when he played the recurring role of the Duke of Wellington in the award-winning ITV series Victoria which received critical acclaim.\n\nSadly Peter died on March 17, 2022 at the age of 85 years old following a battle with cancer, with a statement announcing the beloved stars death, saying: \"The actor Peter Bowles has sadly passed away at the age of 85 from cancer.\n\n\"Starting his career at the Old Vic Theatre in 1956, he starred in 45 theatrical productions ending at the age of 81 in The Exorcist at the Phoenix Theatre.\n\n\"He worked consistently on stage and screen, becoming a household name on TV as the archetypal English gent in To The Manor Born, Only When I Laugh, The Bounder and Lytton’s Diary, which he devised himself.\n\n\"He leaves his wife of over 60 years, Sue, and their three children Guy, Adam and Sasha.\"\n\nAngela Thorne\n\nAngela Thorne played Marjory Frobisher in BBC’s To The Manor Born.\n\nThe 82-year-old actress played one of the sitcom’s most favourite characters – Audrey's best friend who was easygoing, sentimental and a bit of a nut.\n\nIn 2010, Angela appeared in an episode of the BBC’s Who Do You Think You Are?
