        "text": "It just makes me feel uncomfortable.\n\nPerhaps it brings me back to my cocktail waitressing days. I would flirt ruthlessly for those tips. In an English accent. In LA. Even though I was born there. Why?\n\nIn 1997, I had already been living in London as an American actress/singer/dancer for 5 years, working steadily in theatre, film, and TV. Suddenly, due to a producer's tiff in New York, our UK actor’s union and the US actors union got all huffy with each other and went on strike.\n\nUK actors in the states were not allowed to work there, and us Yanks in London were shit outta luck. After 6 months of this, I was almost £20,000 in debt (around $30,000) and my boyfriend was threatening to kill himself if I left him. I woke one morning to find him with a knife on his chest sleeping in the bathtub. Kill away I thought (just the kind of girl I am)…and immediately booked my flight back to LA and snuck out of the flat.\n\n30 years old and I had to move back home with my tail between my legs. I’d had 8 years of an incredibly glamorous, artistic, international life. Hand-to-mouth living, yes. I was sure the gigs would never end. But end they did. Here I was back on my home turf. No money, no car, no US credit…and now living with my mother."
