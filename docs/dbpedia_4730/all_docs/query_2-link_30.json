        "text": "Du Maurier was born into a family steeped in the arts. They were relatively wealthy and du Maurier was introduced to a number of prominent actors through the connections of her father. The Loving Spirit is set in Cornwall, like much of du Maurier’s work. She wrote the novel in the family’s holiday home, which is also where she met Major Frederick Browning, whom she married. On her marriage, du Maurier became Lady Browning; however, she continued to write under her maiden name.\n\nDu Maurier had three children with her husband. They remained married until his death in 1965. Rebecca is one of du Maurier’s most successful and well-known novels. Between publication and 1965, it sold almost three million copies. It has never been out of print. The novel has inspired a number of adaptations for TV, film and stage, including the 1940 film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and a 2020 version by Netflix. Susan Hill, who wrote The Woman in Black, wrote a sequel to Rebecca in 1993: Mrs de Winter. Widely regarded as the inspiration for Manderley from Rebecca, Menabilly was du Maurier’s home between 1943 and 1969. She had come across the property a number of years earlier. When she moved in it was in a neglected state. She restored the house before it returned to the original owners who still own it today.\n\nSee Menabilly here.\n\nDu Maurier was awarded a Dame Commander of the British Empire and became Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning. She chose not to refer to herself using the title and it is reported that she didn’t tell anyone, including her children, that she had received the honour. They discovered the fact in the newspaper."
