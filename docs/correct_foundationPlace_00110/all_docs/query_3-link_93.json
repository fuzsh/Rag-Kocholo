        "text": "In 1960, company founder Leonard Parker Pool is featured on the cover of Business Week.\n\nIn 1961, Air Products begins manufacturing chemicals through a joint venture to convert refinery by-products into oxo-alcohols for use in producing plasticizers.\n\nIn 1962, the company acquires the Houdry Process Company and its subsidiary, the Catalytic Construction Company.\n\nAir Products stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange for the first time in 1962 as its sales pass $100 million.\n\nIn the mid-60s, the company widens its global presence with subsidiaries in Belgium, West Germany, and South Africa.\n\nThe company's position in chemicals expands with the 1969 acquisition of Escambia Chemical Corporation, a U.S. company in Pensacola, Florida.\n\nAir Products develops a process for the recovery of helium from natural gas, along with the process to liquefy natural gas using a heat exchanger.\n\nIn China, Air Products lands its two largest ASU orders ever, the first with Shaanxi Future Energy Chemical Co., Ltd., (12,000 TPD of oxygen) and the second with Shanxi Lu’An Mining (Group) Co., Ltd., (10,000 TPD of oxygen). The ASUs are driven by large-scale coal gasification and petroleum projects throughout China.\n\nAir Products acquires DuPont’s interest in DuPont Air Products NanoMaterials LLC, the two companies’ 50-50 joint venture serving the global semiconductor and wafer polishing industries.\n\nIn 2012, Air Products acquires a controlling stake in INDURA, the largest independent industrial gas company in South America at the time. The acquisition brings new sales and gives the company a significant presence in a fourth region of the world.\n\nAir Products acquires EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. in 2013, adding liquid CO₂ to its North American offerings through EPCO’s 12 CO₂ purification and liquefaction plants.\n\nIn 2014, Air Products Board of Directors approves appointment of new Chairman, President and CEO Seifi Ghasemi , who develops a strategic Five-Point Plan to guide the company's future success.\n\nIn 2015, Air Products is awarded a contract by Saudi Aramco under a joint venture of Air Products and ACWA Holding to build, own and operate the world's largest industrial gas complex to supply Saudi Aramco refinery being built in Jazan, Saudi Arabia.\n\nAir Products celebrates the the company's 75th anniversary in 2015, attributing much of its success to the know-how and innovative spirit of its employees and the willingness to seize opportunities for growth.\n\nExecuting on its strategic Five-Point Plan, Air Products completes the separation of its Electronics Materials Division through the spin-off of Versum Materials, Inc. in 2016.\n\nAir Products setzt erneut seinen strategischen Fünf-Punkte-Plan um und wird 2017 durch den Verkauf seiner Performance Materials Division an den deutschen Spezialchemiehersteller Evonik Industries AG zu einem reinen Industriegasunternehmen.\n\nCEO Seifi Ghasemi implements the next phase of the company's strategic Five-Point Plan for success. Elevating diversity and inclusion into the company's goal, the evolved Plan continues to serve as Air Products' roadmap for driving safety, inclusion, profitability and sustainability into future growth.\n\nAir Products establishes a state-of-the-art technology center at Dhahran Techno Valley Science Park in Saudi Arabia; an advanced research and development center at Zhangjiang Hi-Tech Park in Shanghai, China; and a world-class engineering center at Pune in Maharashtra, India.\n\nAs part of its sale-of-gas business model, Air Products builds, owns and operates a world-scale industrial gas complex in Kochi, India, for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL). The new facility, which houses a technologically advanced HyCO plant, enables BPCL to dramatically increase refining capacity for producing cleaner fuels. Also in India, Air Products' joint venture, INOX Air Products Pvt Ltd., celebrates 20 successful years of doing business in the fast-growing region. Pictured: Air Products' industrial gas complex supplies hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and steam to the BPCL Kochi Refinery.\n\nWith world energy demands, the environment, and emerging markets always on its radar, Air Products begins engineering, building, owning and operating the world's largest industrial gas projects. Through gasification, the company supplies syngas that enables customers and countries to convert plentiful, lower value materials into higher value products.\n\nAir Products demonstrates its culture and character as the company stands in solidarity in the world's collective fight against COVID-19.
