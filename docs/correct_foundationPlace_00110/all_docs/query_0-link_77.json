It features supervised rifle and handgun ranges and automated sporting clays, 5-stand, skeet, and American and Olympic trap fields. The project was supported through funding from the Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program. Additional support and funding were provided by Palm Beach County, the National Rifle Association, and the Fish & Wildlife Foundation of Florida. This facility was created to offer target shooting enthusiasts a place to gain skills and knowledge for safe, responsible firearms handling and target shooting. Wheelchair accessibility and accommodations are provided at this facility."
