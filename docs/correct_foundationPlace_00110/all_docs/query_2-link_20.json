        "text": "City in Riverside County\n\n\"Palm Springs\" redirects here. For other uses, see Palm Springs (disambiguation).\n\nCity in California, United States\n\nPalm Springs (Cahuilla: Séc-he)[5][6] is a desert resort city in Riverside County, California, United States, within the Colorado Desert's Coachella Valley. The city covers approximately 94 square miles (240 km2), making it the largest city in Riverside County by land area. With multiple plots in checkerboard pattern, more than 10% of the city is part of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians reservation land and is the administrative capital of the most populated reservation in California.\n\nThe population of Palm Springs was 44,575 as of the 2020 census, but because Palm Springs is a retirement location and a winter snowbird destination, the city's population triples between November and March.[7]\n\nThe city is noted for its mid-century modern architecture, design elements, arts and cultural scene, and recreational activities.[8]\n\nThe first humans to settle in the area were the Cahuilla people, who arrived 2,000 years ago.[9][10][11] Cahuilla Indians lived here in isolation from other cultures for hundreds of years prior to European contact.[12] They spoke Ivilyuat, which is a Uto-Aztecan language.[13]\n\nNumerous prominent and powerful Cahuilla leaders were from the area, including Cahuilla Lion (Chief Juan Antonio).[14] Palm Canyon was occupied during the winter months, but they often moved to cooler Chino Canyon during the summer months.[15]\n\nThe Cahuilla Indians had several permanent settlements in the canyons of Palm Springs due to the abundance of water and shade. Various hot springs were used during wintertime. The Cahuilla hunted rabbit, mountain goat, and quail while trapping fish in nearby lakes and rivers. While men were responsible for hunting, women were responsible for collecting berries, acorns, and seeds. They also made tortillas from mesquite seeds.[9] While the Cahuillas often spent the summers in Indian Canyons, the current site of the former Spa Resort Casino, in downtown, was often used during winter due to its natural hot springs.[10]\n\nNative American petroglyphs can be seen in Tahquitz, Chino, and Indian Canyons. The Cahuilla's irrigation ditches, dams, and house pits can also be seen here.[16] Ancient petroglyphs, pictographs and mortar holes can be seen in Andreas Canyon. The mortar holes were used to grind acorns into meal.[17][18]\n\nThe Agua Caliente (\"Hot Water\") Reservation was established in 1876 and consists of 31,128 acres (12,597 ha). Six thousand seven hundred acres (2,700 ha) are located by Downtown Palm Springs.[19] The Native American land is on long lease land and next to one of California's high-end communities, making the tribe one of the wealthiest in California.[20]\n\nThe first name for Palm Springs was given by the native Cahuilla: \"Se-Khi\" (boiling water).[21][22] When the Agua Caliente Reservation was established by the United States government in 1876, the reservation land was composed of alternating sections (640 acres or 260 ha) of land laid out across the desert in a checkerboard pattern. The alternating non-reservation sections were granted to the Southern Pacific Railroad as an incentive to bring rail lines through the Sonoran Desert.\n\nA number of streets and areas in Palm Springs are named for Native American notables, including Andreas, Arenas, Amado, Belardo, Lugo, Patencio, Saturnino, and Chino. All of these are common Cahuilla surnames.[10]\n\nPresently the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians is composed of several smaller bands who live in the modern-day Coachella Valley and San Gorgonio Pass. The Agua Caliente Reservation occupies 32,000 acres (13,000 ha), of which 6,700 acres (2,700 ha) lie within the city limits, making the Agua Caliente natives the city's largest landowners. (Tribal enrollment as of 2010 was 410 people.[23])\n\nAs of 1821 Mexico was independent of Spain, and in March 1823, the Mexican Monarchy ended. That same year (in December) Mexican diarist José María Estudillo and Brevet Captain José Romero were sent to find a route from Sonora to Alta California; on their expedition, they first recorded the existence of \"Agua Caliente\" at Palm Springs, California.[24][25]: 30 With the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo after the Mexican-American War, the region became part of the United States in 1848.\n\nOne possible origin of palm in the place name comes from early Spanish explorers who referred to the area as La Palma de la Mano de Dios or \"The Palm of God's hand\".[26] The earliest use of the name \"Palm Springs\" is from United States Topographical Engineers who used the term in 1853 maps.[27] According to William Bright, when the word \"palm\" appears in Californian place names, it usually refers to the native California fan palm, Washingtonia filifera, which is abundant in the Palm Springs area.[28] Other early names were \"Palmetto Spring\" and \"Big Palm Springs\".[29]\n\nThe first European resident in Palm Springs itself was Jack Summers, who ran the stagecoach station on the Bradshaw Trail in 1862.[30]: 44, 149 Fourteen years later (1876), the Southern Pacific railroad was laid 6 miles (9.5 km) to the north, isolating the station.[30]: 17 In 1880, local Indian Pedro Chino was selling parcels near the springs to William Van Slyke and Mathew Bryne in a series of questionable transactions; they in turn brought in W. R. Porter to help market their property through the \"Palm City Land and Water Company\".[25]: 275 By 1885, when San Francisco attorney (later known as \"Judge\") John Guthrie McCallum began buying property in Palm Springs, the name was already in wide acceptance. The area was named \"Palm Valley\" when McCallum incorporated the \"Palm Valley Land and Water Company\" with partners O.C. Miller, H.C. Campbell, and James Adams, M.D.[25]: 280 [31][32]\n\nMcCallum, who had brought his ill son to the dry climate for health, brought in irrigation advocate Dr. Oliver Wozencroft and engineer J. P. Lippincott to help construct a canal from the Whitewater River to fruit orchards on his property.[25]: 276–279 He also asked Dr. Welwood Murray to establish a hotel across the street from his residence. Murray did so in 1886 (he later became a famous horticulturalist).[25]: 280 The crops and irrigation systems suffered flooding in 1893 from record rainfall, and then an 11-year drought (1894–1905) caused further damage.[24]: 40\n\nThe city became a fashionable resort in the 1900s[33] when health tourists arrived with conditions that required dry heat. Because of the heat, however, the population dropped markedly in the summer months.[34] In 1906 naturalist and travel writer George Wharton James's two volume The Wonders of the Colorado Desert described Palm Springs as having \"great charms and attractiveness\"[35]: 278–281 and included an account of his stay at Murray's hotel.[36] As James also described, Palm Springs was more comfortable in its microclimate because the area was covered in the shadow of Mount San Jacinto to the west[31] and in the winter the mountains block cold winds from the San Gorgonio Pass.[37] Early illustrious visitors included John Muir and his daughters, U.S. Vice President Charles Fairbanks, and Fanny Stevenson, widow of Robert Louis Stevenson. Murray's hotel was closed in 1909 and torn down in 1954.[24]: 45\n\nNellie N. Coffman and her physician husband Harry established The Desert Inn as a hotel and sanitarium in 1909.[38][39] It was expanded as a modern hotel in 1927 and continued on until 1967.[24]: Ch. 13 [40][41] Coffman herself was a \"driving force\" in the city's tourism industry until her death in 1950.[42]\n\nJames's Wonders of the Colorado Desert (above) was followed in 1920 by J. Smeaton Chase's Our Araby: Palm Springs and the Garden of the Sun, which also promoted the area.[43] In 1924 Pearl McCallum (daughter of Judge McCallum) returned to Palm Springs and built the Oasis Hotel with her husband Austin G. McManus; the Modern/Art Deco resort was designed by Lloyd Wright and featured a 40-foot (12 m) tower.[24]: 68–69 [44]\n\nThe next major hotel was the El Mirador, a large and luxurious resort that attracted the biggest movie stars; opening in 1927, its prominent feature was a 68-foot-tall (21 m) Renaissance style tower.[24]: Ch. 23 [45] Silent film star Fritzi Ridgeway's 100-room Hotel del Tahquitz was built in 1929, next to the \"Fool's Folly\" mansion built by Chicago heiress Lois Kellogg.[46] Golfing was available at the O'Donnell 9 hole course (1926) and the El Mirador (1929) course (see Golf below). Hollywood movie stars were attracted by the hot dry, sunny weather and seclusion—they built homes and estates in the Warm Sands, The Mesa, and Historic Tennis Club neighborhoods (see Neighborhoods below). About 20,000 visitors came to the area in 1922.[47]\n\nPalm Springs became popular with movie stars in the 1930s[48] and estate building expanded into the Movie Colony neighborhoods, Tahquitz River Estates, and Las Palmas neighborhoods. Actors Charles Farrell and Ralph Bellamy opened the Racquet Club in 1934[24]: Ch. 25 [49][50] and Pearl McCallum opened the Tennis Club in 1937.[44] Nightclubs were set up as well, with Al Wertheimer opening The Dunes outside of Palm Springs in 1934[24]: 254 and the Chi Chi nightclub opening in 1936.[51][52]: 206–207 Besides the gambling available at the Dunes Club, other casinos included The 139 Club and The Cove Club outside of the city.[53][54]\n\nBullock's, a large upscale department store on Broadway in Los Angeles, opened a Spanish Colonial-style \"resort store\" within the Desert Inn complex in 1930. When Bullock's opened a full department store at 151 Palm Canyon Drive in 1947, J. W. Robinson's, another large L.A. store, took the former Bullock's location and opened its own resort store there.[55]\n\nSouthern California's first self-contained shopping center was in Palm Springs, La Plaza (originally Palm Springs Plaza), and on-street, open air center anchored by a small Desmond's department store, in 1936. The three-level parking garage for 141 cars was an innovation and the largest in Riverside County at that time.[56] In the mid-twentieth century across the street on Palm Canyon Drive were department stores like Bullock's/Bullocks Wilshire (No. 151, 1947–1990), J. W. Robinson's (No. 333, 1958–1987),[57][58][59] and Saks Fifth Avenue (opened October 16, 1959, at No. 490),[60] forming a large shopping district. In 1967 the Desert Fashion Plaza mall was built, I. Magnin opened there (closed 1992)[61] and Saks closed its previous location and moved into a new larger store in the mall. Joseph Magnin Co. opened a 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) department store in the mall in 1969,[62] meaning that together with a Sears at 611 Palm Canyon Dr., for two decades, downtown boasted seven department stores, plus the Palm Springs Mall 1.5 miles (2.5 km) to the east operating from 1959 to 2005.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley were important in the war effort. The original airfield near Palm Springs became a staging area for the Air Corps Ferrying Command's 21st Ferrying Group in November 1941 and a new airfield was built 1⁄2 mile (0.8 km) from the old site. The new airfield,[63]: 43 designated Palm Springs Army Airfield,[64] was completed in early 1942. Personnel from the Air Transport Command 560th Army Air Forces Base Unit stayed at the La Paz Guest Ranch and training was conducted at the airfield by the 72nd and 73rd Ferrying Squadrons. Later training was provided by the IV Fighter Command 459th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron.\n\nEight months before Pearl Harbor Day, the El Mirador Hotel was fully booked and adding new facilities.[65] After the war started, the U.S. government bought the hotel from owner Warren Phinney for $750,000,[66] just over $13,000,000 if including inflation in 2020, and converted it into the Torney General Hospital,[67] with Italian prisoners of war serving as kitchen help and orderlies in 1944 and 1945.[68] Through the war it was staffed with 1,500 personnel and treated some 19,000 patients.[50]: 55\n\nGeneral Patton's Desert Training Center encompassed the entire region, with its headquarters in Camp Young at the Chiriaco Summit and an equipment depot maintained by the 66th Ordnance in present-day Palm Desert.[63]: 40\n\nArchitectural modernists flourished with commissions from the stars, using the city to explore architectural innovations, new artistic venues, and an exotic back-to-the-land experiences. Inventive architects designed unique vacation houses, such as steel houses with prefabricated panels and folding roofs, a glass-and-steel house in a boulder-strewn landscape, and a carousel house that turned to avoid the sun's glare.[69]\n\nIn 1946, Richard Neutra designed the Kaufmann Desert House. A modernist classic, this mostly glass residence incorporated the latest technological advances in building materials, using natural lighting and floating planes and flowing space for proportion and detail.[70] In recent years an energetic preservation program has protected and enhanced many classic buildings.\n\nCulver (2010) argues that Palm Springs architecture became the model for mass-produced suburban housing, especially in the Southwest. This \"Desert Modern\" style was a high-end architectural style featuring open-design plans, wall-to-wall carpeting, air-conditioning, swimming pools, and very large windows. As Culver concludes, \"While environmentalists might condemn desert modern, the masses would not. Here, it seemed, were houses that fully merged inside and outside, providing spaces for that essential component of Californian—and indeed middle-class American—life: leisure. While not everyone could have a Neutra masterpiece, many families could adopt aspects of Palm Springs modern.\"[71]\n\nHollywood values permeated the resort as it combined celebrity, health, new wealth, and sex. As Culver (2010) explains: \"The bohemian sexual and marital mores already apparent in Hollywood intersected with the resort atmosphere of Palm Springs, and this new, more open sexuality would gradually appear elsewhere in national tourist culture.\"[71] During this period, the city government, stimulated by real estate developers, systematically removed and excluded poor people and Indians.[72][73]\n\nPalm Springs was pictured by the French photographer Robert Doisneau in November 1960 as part of an assignment for Fortune[74] on the construction of golf courses in this particularly dry and hot area of the Colorado desert. Doisneau submitted around 300 slides following his ten-day stay depicting the lifestyle of wealthy retirees and Hollywood stars in the 1960s. At the time, Palm Springs counted just 19 courses, which had grown to 125 by 2010.[75]\n\nFurther information: Golden Checkerboard\n\nSection 14 is a square mile of land owned by the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians within close walking distance of downtown. Former residents in this area, mostly black people and other people of color, lived in land leased in short terms by individual Indigenous owners. Commercial development did not occur due to the 10 year limit on the leases.[76] After changes in the Indian Leasing Act in 1959, long term leases were permitted. Mayor Frank Bogert and other city officials advocated to the conservators that managed the tribe's leases to end the short term leases and enter into long term leases to largely white property owners for redevelopment. City funds were used to clear the land for redevelopment, including burning \"shacks and makeshift homes... [which had] rented for $20 to $40 a month.\"[77] In 2021 the California Attorney General's office later called the displacement a \"city-engineered holocaust\", depriving dozens of Black and Latino people of generational wealth.[78]\n\nAfter existing non-Indian residents were evicted in the 1960s, the tribe built the Spa Hotel and Casino downtown and the city built the Palm Springs Convention Center; also, the tribe leased land for developers to build hotels and condos.[79]\n\nThe Palm Springs Human Relations Commission cited this history, as well as a conflict of interest while Bogert acted as conservator for tribal land which was being demolished by the city, and racist comments regarding the \"poor Blacks\" who lived in Section 14, as justification for removing a statue of Bogert on horseback placed in 1990 in front of the Palm Springs City Hall.[80] The City Council of Palm Springs ordered its removal in 2021 and formally apologized for the eviction of the Section 14 residents.[81] After legal objections to its removal from Bogert's supporters and family members were rejected by the courts, the statue was relocated on July 13, 2022.[82] Section 14 residents are still seeking financial reparations for the evictions.[83]\n\nSimilar to the pre-war era, Palm Springs remained popular with the rich and famous of Hollywood, as well as retirees and Canadian tourists.[84] Between 1947 and 1965, the Alexander Construction Company built some 2,200 houses in Palm Springs effectively doubling its housing capacity.\n\nAs the 1970s drew to a close, increasing numbers of retirees moved to the Coachella Valley. As a result, Palm Springs began to evolve from a virtual ghost town in the summer to a year-round community. Businesses and hotels that used to close for the months of July and August instead remained open all summer. As commerce grew, so too did the number of families with children.\n\nThe recession of 1973–1975 affected Palm Springs as many of the wealthy residents had to cut back on their spending.[85] Later in the 1970s numerous Chicago mobsters invested $50 million in the Palm Springs area, buying houses, land, and businesses.[86] While Palm Springs faced competition from the desert cities to the east in the later 1980s,[87] it has continued to prosper into the 21st century.[88]\n\nPalm Springs (as well as surrounding areas) became a desired destination as the COVID-19 pandemic began; the city saw an increase of residents from larger cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, with new residents seeking less dense areas from which to work remotely.[89]\n\nSince the early 1950s[90] the city had been a popular spring break resort. Glamorized as a destination in the 1963 movie Palm Springs Weekend,[91] the number of visitors grew and at times the gatherings had problems. In 1969 an estimated 15,000 people had gathered for a concert at the Palm Springs Angel Stadium and 300 were arrested for drunkenness or disturbing the peace.[92] In the 1980s, 10,000 or more college students would visit the city and form crowds and parties—and another rampage occurred in 1986[93] when Palm Springs Police in riot gear had to put down the rowdy crowd.[94] In 1990, due to complaints by residents, mayor Sonny Bono and the city council closed the city's Palm Canyon Drive to spring breakers and the downtown businesses, normally filled with tourists, lost money.[95]\n\nTourism is a major factor in the city's economy with 1.6 million visitors in 2011.[47] The city has over 130 hotels and resorts, numerous bed and breakfasts, and over 100 restaurants and dining spots.[96] Events such as the Coachella and Stagecoach Festivals in nearby Indio attract younger people, making greater Palm Springs a more attractive area to retire.[97]\n\nFollowing the 2008 recession, Palm Springs revitalized its Downtown, \"the Village\". Rebuilding started with the demolition of the Bank of America building in January 2012, with the Desert Fashion Plaza scheduled for demolition in 2013.[98]\n\nIn 2020, Christy Holstege became the mayor of Palm Springs, which made her the first openly bisexual mayor in the United States, as well as the first female mayor of Palm Springs.[99][100] The following year, Lisa Middleton became mayor, making her the first openly transgender mayor in California history.[101]\n\nThe movement behind mid-century modern architecture (1950s/60s era) in Palm Springs is backed by architecture enthusiasts, designers, and local historians to preserve many of Palm Springs' buildings and homes of famous celebrities, businessmen, and politicians. Stores sell furniture and gifts that feature a mid-century modern theme. The city holds a Modernism Week celebration every February, along with several related smaller events during the year.[102]\n\nPalm Springs is located in the Sonoran Desert. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 95.0 square miles (246 km2), of which 94.1 square miles (244 km2) is land and 0.9 square miles (2.3 km2) (1%) is water. Located in the Coachella Valley desert region, Palm Springs is sheltered by the San Bernardino Mountains to the north, the Santa Rosa Mountains to the south, by the San Jacinto Mountains to the west and by the Little San Bernardino Mountains to the east.\n\nPalm Springs has a hot desert climate (BWh in Köppen-Geiger classification), with over 300 days of sunshine and 4.93 inches (125.2 mm) of rainfall annually.[103] The wettest “rain year” on record was from July 1926 to June 1927 with 17.68 inches or 449.1 millimetres — of which 10.22 inches or 259.6 millimetres fell during three days in mid-February — and the driest from July 2001 to June 2002 with 0.40 inches or 10.2 millimetres.\n\nThe winter months are warm, with a majority of days reaching 70 °F or 21.1 °C and in January and February afternoons often see temperatures of 80 °F or 26.7 °C and on occasion reach over 90 °F or 32.2 °C, while, on average, there are 17 mornings annually dipping to or below 40 °F or 4.4 °C;[103] freezing temperatures occur in less than half of years. The lowest temperature recorded is 19 °F or −7.2 °C, on January 22, 1937.[104]\n\nSummers are extremely hot, with daytime temperatures consistently surpassing 110 °F or 43.3 °C while overnight temperatures often remain above 80 °F or 26.7 °C. The mean annual temperature is 75.6 °F (24.2 °C). There are on average 176.6 afternoons with a high reaching 90 °F or 32.2 °C, and 100 °F or 37.8 °C can be seen on 114.8 afternoons.[103] The highest temperature on record in Palm Springs is 124 °F or 51.1 °C on July 5, 2024.[105][106] The climate of Palm Springs is suitable for some palm trees, although tropical types that need more water and humidity do not grow as well. [107]\n\nThe locale features a variety of native Low Desert flora and fauna. A notable tree occurring in the wild and under cultivation is the California Fan Palm, Washingtonia filifera.[110]\n\nThe fauna of Palm Springs is mostly species adapted to desert, temperature extremes and to lack of moisture. It is located within the Nearctic faunistic realm in a region containing an assemblage of species similar to Northern Africa.[111] Native fauna includes pronghorns, desert bighorn sheep, desert tortoise, kit fox, desert iguanas, horned lizards, chuckwalla, bobcats, mountain lions and Gila monsters. Other animals include ground squirrels, rock squirrels, porcupines, skunks, cactus mice, kangaroo rats, pocket gophers and raccoons.[112] Desert birds here include the iconic roadrunner, which can run at speeds exceeding 15 mph (24 km/h). Other avifauna includes the ladder-backed woodpecker, flycatchers, elf owls, great horned owls, sparrow hawks and a variety of raptors.[113]\n\nThe Sonoran Desert has more species of rattlesnakes (11) than anywhere else in the world.[114] The most common species is the extremely venomous Mojave green, which is considered the world's most dangerous rattlesnake. The largest rattle snake species here is the western diamondback rattlesnake, while other species include the black-tailed rattlesnake, tiger rattler and sidewinder rattler.[115] Palm Springs is home to tarantulas and various scorpion species, including the vinegaroon.[116]\n\nAlthough black bears are not common in the Coachella Valley, bears have been observed in Palm Springs and other parts of California.[117]\n\nToday, jaguars roam the northern Mexican dry-lands; however, they were previously common throughout the Coachella Valley. The last documented jaguar sighting in Palm Springs was in 1860.[118]\n\nThe City of Palm Springs has developed a program to identify distinctive neighborhoods in the community.[119] Of the 45 neighborhoods,[119] 7 have historical and cultural significance.[120]\n\nThe Movie Colony is just east of Palm Canyon Drive.[121] The Movie Colony East neighborhood extends further east from the Ruth Hardy Park.[122] These areas started growing in the 1930s as Hollywood movie stars built their smaller getaways from their Los Angeles area estates. Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Estée Lauder, Carmen Miranda and Bing Crosby built homes in these neighborhoods.\n\nIn the 1960s, Robert Fey built 70 homes designed by Donald Wexler and Ric Harrison in the El Rancho Vista Estates.[123] Noted residents included Jack LaLanne and comic Andy Dick.\n\nHistoric homes in the Warm Sands area date from the 1920s and many were built from adobe.[124] It also includes small resorts and the Ramon Mobile Home Park. Noted residents have included screenwriter Walter Koch, artist Paul A. Grimm, activist Cleve Jones and actor Wesley Eure.[citation needed]\n\nThe Mesa started off as a gated community developed in the 1920s near the Indian Canyons.[125] Noted residents have included King Gillette, Zane Grey, Clark Gable, Carole Lombard, Suzanne Somers, Herman Wouk, Henry Fernandez, Barry Manilow and Trina Turk. Distinctive homes include Donald Wexler's \"butterfly houses\" and the \"Streamline Moderne Ship of the Desert\".[126]\n\nSome of the homes in this neighborhood date from the 1930s. The area was owned by Pearl McCallum McManus, and she started building homes in the neighborhood after World War II ended. Dr. William Scholl (Dr. Scholl's foot products) owned a 10-acre (4.0 ha) estate here. Today the neighborhood is the largest neighborhood organization with 600 homes and businesses within its boundaries.[127]\n\nDuring World War II, the original Sunmor Estates area was the western portion of the Palm Springs Army Airfield.[128] Homes here were developed by Robert Higgins and the Alexander Construction Company. Actor and former mayor Frank Bogert bought his home for $16,000 and lived there for more than 50 years.[citation needed]\n\nImpoverished artist Carl Eytel first set up his cabin on what would become the Tennis Club in 1937. Another artist in the neighborhood, who built his Moroccan-style \"Dar Marrac\" estate in 1924, was Gordon Coutts.[129] Other estates include Samuel Untermyer's Mediterranean style villa (now the Willows Historic Palm Springs Inn),[130] the Casa Cody Inn, built by Harriet and Harold William Cody (cousin of Buffalo Bill Cody)[131][132] and the Ingleside Inn,[133] built in the 1920s by the Humphrey Birge family. The neighborhood now has about 400 homes, condos, apartments, inns and restaurants.[134]\n\nTo the west of Palm Canyon Drive are the Vista Las Palmas,[135] Old Las Palmas, and Little Tuscany neighborhoods.[136] These areas also feature distinctive homes, celebrity estates, and Albert Frey's private residential complex Villa Hermosa.[citation needed]\n\nHistoric Racquet Club Estates, located north of Vista Chino, is home to over five hundred mid-century modern homes from the Alexander Construction Company. \"Meiselman\" homes, and the famed Donald Wexler steel homes (having Class One historic designation) are also prominent in the area.[137] Racquet Club Estates was Palm Springs' first middle income neighborhood and became popular with Hollywood's elite in the 1950s and 60's.[52]: 41\n\nDeepwell Estates, the eastern portion of the square mile (2.6 km2) defined by South/East Palm Canyon, Mesquite, and Sunrise, contains around 370 homes, including notable homes architecturally and of celebrity figures. Among the celebrities who lived in the neighborhood are Jerry Lewis, Loretta Young, Liberace, and William Holden.[138][139]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 19403,434—19507,660123.1%196013,46875.8%197020,93655.4%198032,35954.6%199040,18124.2%200042,8076.5%201044,5524.1%202044,5750.1%\n\nThe 2010 United States Census[141] reported that Palm Springs had a population of 44,552.

O'Donnell)[203] and the El Mirador Hotel course, both of which opened in the 1920s.[24]: 120 After the Cochran-Odlum (Indio) and Shadow Mountain pitch and putt courses were built after World II, the first 18-hole golf course in the area was the Thunderbird Country Club, established 1951 in Rancho Mirage.[204][205] Thunderbird was designed by golf course architects Lawrence Hughes and Johnny Dawson[206] and in 1955 it hosted the 11th Ryder Cup championship.\n\nIn the 1970s the area had over 40 courses and in 2001 the 100th course was opened.[24]: 121 The area is also home to the PGA Tour's Humana Challenge in partnership with the Clinton Foundation (formerly the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic), the LPGA's ANA Inspiration and the Canadian Tour's Desert Dunes Classic.[207]\n\nThe Palm Springs AYSO Region 80 plays in Section 1H of the American Youth Soccer Organization.[208][209]\n\nBoomers! is a family entertainment center in Cathedral City.[213]\n\nA city skatepark was designed after the noted Nude Bowl.[214]\n\nCNL Financial Group operates the Wet'n'Wild Palm Springs water park in the summer. (Formerly operated as Knott's Soak City by Cedar Fair Entertainment Company.)\n\nIn 1931 the Desert Riders was established.[215] Starting off as a social organization for the cream of Palm Springs society, the group sponsors horseback riding and trail building for equestrians, hikers, and bicyclists.[216] The Desert Riders were also significant in providing combination chuckwagon meals and rides through nearby canyons to hotel guests as Palm Springs developed its tourist industry.[217]\n\nBusiness owners in the village first established a Palm Springs Board of Trade in 1918, followed by a chamber of commerce; the city itself was established by election in 1938[218][219] and converted to a charter city, with a charter adopted by the voters in 1994.[220]\n\nPresently the city has a council-manager type government, with a five-person city council that hires a city manager and city attorney. The mayor is directly elected and serves a four-year term. The other four council members also serve four-year terms, with staggered elections. The city is considered a full-service city, in that it staffs and manages its own police and fire departments including parks and recreation programs, public library,[221] sewer system and wastewater treatment plant, international airport, and planning and building services.\n\nThe city government is a member of the Southern California Association of Governments.[222]\n\nChristy Holstege, who took office as mayor in December 2020, was the first female and the first openly bisexual mayor in the city's history, and the first openly bisexual mayor in American history.[99][100] Lisa Middleton, the first transgender mayor in California history, took office in 2021.[223]\n\nPalm Springs' longest-tenured mayor was Frank Bogert (1958–66 and 1982–88). He was credited with leading the city as it evolved from a small resort town into a larger community.[224] Bogert's actions as mayor have proved controversial in recent years, as allegations that Bogert removed hundreds of citizens of color from a city neighborhood led to the removal of a statue on city property that honored him.[225]\n\nFormer entertainer Sonny Bono had the most recognizable name; Bono served from 1988 to 1992 and was eventually elected to the U.S. Congress.[226]\n\nPalm Springs is in Supervisorial District 4 of Riverside County represented by Democrat V. Manuel Perez[227]\n\nIn the California State Legislature, Palm Springs is in the 32nd Senate District, represented by Republican Kelly Seyarto, and in the 47th Assembly District, represented by Republican Greg Wallis.[228]\n\nIn the United States House of Representatives, Palm Springs is in California's 41st congressional district, represented by Republican Ken Calvert.[229]\n\nPalm Springs is the seat of government and the administrative capital for the tribal council of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians.[230] The tribal government governs over parts of the city where reservation jurisdictions overlap.[231]\n\nPublic education in Palm Springs is under the jurisdiction of the Palm Springs Unified School District, an independent district with five board members.[232] The Palm Springs High School[233] is the oldest school in the district, built in 1938. Originally it was a K–12 school in the 1920s and had the College of the Desert campus from 1958 to 1964.

The Palm Springs DMA is unique among TV markets as it is entirely located within only a small portion of Riverside County. Also, while many cities launched local television stations during the 1950s, Palm Springs did not have a local TV station until October 1968, when stations KPLM-TV (now KESQ) and KMIR-TV debuted. Prior to that time, Palm Springs was served by TV stations from the Los Angeles market, which were carried on the local cable system that began operations in the 1950s and which predated the emergence of local broadcast stations by more than a decade.\n\nTV stations serving the Palm Springs and Coachella Valley area include:\n\nKDFX-CD Fox Channel 33 (Channel 11 on cable)\n\nKESQ-TV ABC, Channel 42 (Channel 3 on cable)\n\nKMIR-TV NBC, Channel 36 (Channel 13 on cable)\n\nKPSP-CD CBS, Channel 38 (Channel 2 on cable)\n\nThe CW, MyNetworkTV, PBS, and other networks are covered by low power TV stations in the market.\n\nAdditionally, Palm Springs and the surrounding area are served by AM and FM radio stations including the following:\n\nThe Desert Sun is the local daily newspaper serving Palm Springs and the Coachella Valley region.
