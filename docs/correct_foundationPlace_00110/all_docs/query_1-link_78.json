You belong here!\n\nOur first Residence Hall on the Daytona Beach Campus has been a resounding success since opening in Fall 2022. It is home to 256 students, has been at full capacity since its first day of operation, and applications exceed bed space by more than 300%!\n\nStudents who live on campus are more engaged with instructors, make more use of academic support services, participate in more on-campus activities, connect socially with peers, and build lifelong friendships that help them navigate financial and personal challenges that help them succeed far better in college and in life.\n\nTo meet this demand, we are embarking on the most ambitious private fundraising endeavor in the College’s history. And we need your help! We’ve set an ambitious goal to raise $15 million to build a second student Residence Hall on the Daytona Beach Campus and open it in Fall 2025."
