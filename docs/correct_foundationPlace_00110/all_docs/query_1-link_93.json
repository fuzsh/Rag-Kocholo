        "text": "IT STARTS WITH A DREAM\n\nBacardi is founded on February 4 by Don Facundo Bacardí Massó in Santiago de Cuba, when he buys a small distillery and revolutionizes the rum-making process to create a smooth, light-bodied spirit – what the world now knows as BACARDÍ® rum.\n\nFacundo’s wife, Doña Amalia notices a colony of fruit bats hanging in the rafters of the distillery and recognizes their importance to the Spanish and Cuban Taíno indigenous people as symbols of good health, family unity, and good fortune. She suggests adopting the bat as the symbol of BACARDÍ rum and soon locals began to ask for “el ron del murcielago” – the rum of the bat.\n\nFacundo Bacardí Moreau (son of Don Facundo) plants a coconut palm at the front of the new distillery. Affectionately known as El Coco, the palm became a symbol to the Bacardí family and company. Withstanding a distillery fire, five earthquakes, and countless hurricanes, El Coco symbolized strength and resilience of the Bacardi company. Eventually, a local prophecy grows around the palm tree:\n\nThe Bacardi company will survive in Cuba so long as the coconut palm lives…”\n\nBANNED BUT NOT BEATEN\n\nProhibition goes into effect in the United States, banning the manufacturing and sale of alcohol, and the Bacardi bottling facility in New York shuts down.\n\nThe company turns adversity into success with a campaign promoting Cuba as a tropical escape from the “dry” United States. Americans flock to the island to enjoy BACARDÍ rum, triggering growth for the company as cocktail culture booms around the world.\n\nSTRENGTH AND RESILIENCE\n\nAll Bacardi operations and assets in Cuba are illegally confiscated without compensation by revolutionary government forces on October 14, 1960, just shy of the company’s 100th anniversary. This same year, the prophecy of El Coco becomes a reality when, 98 years since it was first planted by the family outside the Bacardi distillery in 1862, the beloved palm withers and dies.\n\nThe Bacardí family remains strong, though many are forced to flee the island in exile. Having cleverly moved the company’s trademarks and yeast strain out of Cuba already, they continue operations in the United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Spain and The Bahamas.\n\nA NEW LIFE\n\nBacardi International Limited moves from the Bahamas to a new home in Bermuda. This strategic move creates a bridge between Europe, where Bacardi sees growth potential, and the U.S. where they are already well established. It turns out to be a brilliant call and sparks a time of spectacular success.\n\nSeven years later, Bacardi International Limited unveils a new office in Bermuda inspired by an original design by renowned architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. These designs were intended for a headquarters in Santiago de Cuba that were never realized as the family and business was forced into exile from the island in 1960."
