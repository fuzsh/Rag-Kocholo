        "text": "Our corporate philanthropy programs\n\nTarget Circle community giving\n\nMaking an impact is at the heart of Target Circle. That's why, as a member of Target Circle, guests not only save with offers and receive personalized deals, but they can vote to impact the communities we’re all a part of.\n\nLearn more and nominate an organization\n\nDisaster and crisis response\n\nWe’re committed to the communities we serve, so in times of crisis or humanitarian need, we make sure our team members and nonprofit partners have what they need to help communities. Our global supply chain can move quickly to support our stores and guests. And all year round, we provide relief organizations with local donations and funding.\n\nSince 2001, we have partnered with Feeding America in their fight to end hunger in the U.S. We donate millions of pounds of food each year, providing millions of meals to families in need. In 2024, Target pledged $10 million over five years to longtime partner Second Harvest Heartland’s “Make Hunger History” initiative to cut hunger in Minnesota in half by 2030, a reflection of our commitment to our home state and meeting the needs of our communities.\n\nLearn more\n\nHoliday giving\n\nIn 2023, more than 2,000 Target stores and 19 supply chain facilities participated in the Great Giftogether, providing comfort and joy to families in their communities. In partnership with local nonprofits, team members shopped for, wrapped and delivered gifts that helped to spread cheer to more than 4,000 families in need during the holiday season.\n\nLocal neighborhood support\n\nCommunity Engagement Funds: Our Community Engagement Funds (CEF) allow our stores and distribution center leaders across the country to support local programs and organizations that bring joy to families and address critical needs in their communities. CEF grants are made by invitation only.\n\nLocal Store Giving: Our local stores care about the communities they serve. If your organization is a non-profit 501(c)3, accredited school or government agency, you may go to our store to request a Target GiftCard donation.\n\nNote: To be considered, please fill out this form completely and bring into your local Target store. You will need to provide a Government Affirmation letter or other IRS-provided letter for verification of your nonprofit organization or public agency (i.e., public school, public library) status. GiftCard donations are available February through December, as funding permits. An average donation is $25-50 with the maximum donation of $500 per year, per agency. Target does not donate merchandise. Stores typically take up to 30 days to review and respond with an approval or decline.\n\nOur hometown\n\nWe demonstrate our commitment to supporting our hometown communities of Minneapolis and St. Paul through our strong legacy of volunteer engagement, corporate giving and local store giving. Each year, we donate millions in cash grants and in-kind product donations in the Twin Cities, including corporate giving grants to support local nonprofit organizations. Our commitment to supporting organizations in the Twin Cities is unwavering, and we will continue to address our community’s needs now and in the future. (Investments through this program are made by invitation only.)"
