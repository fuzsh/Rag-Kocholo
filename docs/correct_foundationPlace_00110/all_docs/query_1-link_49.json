But climate change is now slowly transforming this once-thriving biodiversity hotspot, making life challenging for wildlife and the shepherds who have farmed here for centuries.\n\nPantry staples don’t get a lot of love. But for Sarela Herrada, they’re at the heart of a mission to support farming communities and make healthier, ethically-sourced foods more widely available.\n\nThe government of Indonesia announced this week a deal to redirect more than US$ 35 million it owes to the United States into the conservation of coral reefs.\n\nNearly a third of fishing lines are lost or discarded at sea. This so-called “ghost gear” — along with nets and traps — is deadly for marine animals. One man is on a mission to clean it up, net by net."
