        "text": "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION\n\nIn the Matter of\n\nPALM, INC., a corporation.\n\nFILE NO. 002-3332\n\nAGREEMENT CONTAINING CONSENT ORDER\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has conducted an investigation of certain acts and practices of Palm, Inc., a corporation (\"proposed respondent\"). Proposed respondent, having been represented by counsel, is willing to enter into an agreement containing a consent order resolving the allegations contained in the attached draft complaint. Therefore,\n\nIT IS HEREBY AGREED by and between Palm, Inc., by its duly authorized officer, and counsel for the Federal Trade Commission that:\n\n1. Proposed respondent Palm, Inc. is a Delaware corporation with its principal office or place of business at 5470 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California 95054.\n\n2. Proposed respondent admits all the jurisdictional facts set forth in the draft complaint.\n\n3. Proposed respondent waives:\n\na. Any further procedural steps;\n\nb. The requirement that the Commission's decision contain a statement of findings of fact and conclusions of law; and\n\nc. All rights to seek judicial review or otherwise to challenge or contest the validity of the order entered pursuant to this agreement.\n\n4. This agreement shall not become part of the public record of the proceeding unless and until it is accepted by the Commission. If this agreement is accepted by the Commission, it, together with the draft complaint, will be placed on the public record for a period of thirty (30) days and information about it publicly released. The Commission thereafter may either withdraw its acceptance of this agreement and so notify proposed respondent, in which event it will take such action as it may consider appropriate, or issue and serve its complaint (in such form as the circumstances may require) and decision in disposition of the proceeding.\n\n5. This agreement is for settlement purposes only and does not constitute an admission by proposed respondent that the law has been violated as alleged in the draft complaint, or that the facts as alleged in the draft complaint, other than the jurisdictional facts, are true.\n\n6. This agreement contemplates that, if it is accepted by the Commission, and if such acceptance is not subsequently withdrawn by the Commission pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.34 of the Commission's Rules, the Commission may, without further notice to proposed respondent, (1) issue its complaint corresponding in form and substance with the attached draft complaint and its decision containing the following order in disposition of the proceeding, and (2) make information about it public. When so entered, the order shall have the same force and effect and may be altered, modified, or set aside in the same manner and within the same time provided by statute for other orders. The order shall become final upon service. Delivery of the complaint and the decision and order to proposed respondent's address as stated in this agreement by any means specified in Section 4.4(a) of the Commission's Rules shall constitute service. Proposed respondent waives any right it may have to any other manner of service. The complaint may be used in construing the terms of the order, and no agreement, understanding, representation, or interpretation not contained in the order or the agreement may be used to vary or contradict the terms of the order.\n\n7. Proposed respondent has read the draft complaint and consent order. It understands that it may be liable for civil penalties in the amount provided by law and other appropriate relief for each violation of the order after it becomes final.\n\nORDER\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nFor purposes of this Order, the following definitions shall apply:\n\n1. Unless otherwise specified, \"respondent\" shall mean Palm, Inc., a corporation, its successors and assigns and its officers, agents, representatives, and employees.\n\n2. \"Clearly and conspicuously\" shall mean as follows:\n\nA. In an advertisement communicated through an electronic medium (such as television, video, radio, and interactive media such as the Internet, online services and software), the disclosure shall be presented simultaneously in both the audio and visual portions of the advertisement if the claim triggering the disclosure is presented by both audio and visual means. In any claim presented solely through visual or audio means, the disclosure may be made through the same means in which the claim is presented. Any audio disclosure shall be delivered in a volume and cadence sufficient for an ordinary consumer to hear and comprehend it. Any visual disclosure shall be of a size and shade, with a degree of contrast to the background against which it appears, and shall appear on the screen for a duration and in a location, sufficiently noticeable for an ordinary consumer to read and comprehend it.\n\nB. In a print advertisement, promotional material, or instructional manual, the disclosure shall be in a type size and location sufficiently noticeable for an ordinary consumer to read and comprehend it, in print that contrasts with the background against which it appears.\n\nC. On a product label, the disclosure shall be in a type size and location sufficiently noticeable for an ordinary consumer to read and comprehend it, in print that contrasts with the background against which it appears.\n\nThe disclosure shall be in understandable language and syntax. Nothing contrary to, inconsistent with, or in mitigation of the disclosure shall be used in any advertisement or on any label.\n\n3. In the case of advertisements disseminated by means of an interactive electronic medium such as software, the Internet or online services, a disclosure made through the use of a hyperlink shall not be deemed \"clear and conspicuous\" unless the hyperlink itself is clear and conspicuous, is clearly identified as a hyperlink, is labeled to convey the nature and relevance of the information it leads to, is on the same webpage, online service page, or other electronic page and proximate to the triggering representation, and takes the consumer directly to the disclosure on the click-through electronic page or other display window or panel.\n\n4. \"General-purpose ISP service\" shall mean the category of services that allow consumers to access the Internet from personal computers or that is generally understood by consumers to be necessary for wireless access to the Internet. It shall not include a specific Internet access service, if respondent's product requires use of that specific service to access the Internet.\n\n5. \"Commerce\" shall mean as defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. ï¿½ 44.\n\nI.\n\nIT IS ORDERED that respondent, directly or through any corporation, subsidiary, division, or other device, in connection with the manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any personal digital assistant or handheld Internet or email access device, in or affecting commerce, shall not misrepresent, in any manner, expressly or by implication:\n\nA. that the product is able to perform any common business function that it cannot perform without additional products or services that consumers must purchase; or\n\nB. that wireless Internet or email service coverage for such product is available everywhere or almost everywhere in the United States.\n\nII.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent, directly or through any corporation, subsidiary, division, or other device, in connection with the manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any personal digital assistant or handheld Internet or email access device that requires the use of an additional device in order to wirelessly access the Internet or email accounts, in or affecting commerce, shall not misrepresent, in any manner, expressly or by implication any performance characteristic of such product relating to accessing the Internet or email accounts.\n\nIII.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent, directly or through any corporation, subsidiary, division, or other device, in connection with the manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, offering for sale, sale, or distribution of any personal digital assistant or handheld Internet or email access device, in or affecting commerce, shall not make any representation, in any manner, expressly or by implication, about the ability of any such product to perform any function that requires the purchase of additional products or services unless respondent discloses, clearly and conspicuously:\n\nA. when such function involves accessing the Internet or email accounts, any other products (such as a modem, mobile telephone, or adapter) or Internet or email access services, other than general-purpose ISP service, that consumers must purchase in order to access the Internet or email accounts using such product; or\n\nB. when such function does not involve accessing the Internet or email accounts, that additional products must be purchased in order to perform such function using such product.\n\nIV.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the provisions of this Order shall not apply to any label or labeling printed prior to 30 days after the date respondent executed the consent agreement and shipped by respondent to distributors or retailers prior to 120 days after the date of service of this Order.\n\nVI.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent Palm, Inc., and its successors and assigns shall, for five (5) years after the last date of dissemination of any representation covered by this order, maintain and upon request make available to the Federal Trade Commission for inspection and copying:\n\nA. All advertisements and promotional materials containing the representation;\n\nB. All materials that were relied upon in disseminating the representation; and\n\nC. All tests, reports, studies, surveys, demonstrations, or other evidence in their possession or control that contradict, qualify, or call into question the representation, or the basis relied upon for the representation, including complaints and other communications with consumers or with governmental or consumer protection organizations.\n\nVII.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent Palm, Inc., and its successors and assigns shall, for a period of five (5) years, deliver a copy of this order to all principals, officers, directors, and managers, and to all employees, agents, and representatives having responsibilities with respect to the subject matter of this order, and shall secure from each such person a signed and dated statement acknowledging receipt of the order. Respondent shall deliver this order to current personnel within thirty (30) days after the date of service of this order, and to future personnel within thirty (30) days after the person assumes such position or responsibilities.\n\nVIII.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent Palm, Inc. and its successors and assigns shall notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the corporation that may affect compliance obligations arising under this order, including, but not limited to, a dissolution, assignment, sale, merger, or other action that would result in the emergence of a successor corporation; the creation or dissolution of a subsidiary, parent, or affiliate that engages in any acts or practices subject to this order; the proposed filing of a bankruptcy petition; or a change in the corporate name or address. Provided, however, that, with respect to any proposed change in the corporation about which respondent learns less than thirty (30) days prior to the date such action is to take place, respondent shall notify the Commission as soon as is practicable after obtaining such knowledge. All notices required by this Part shall be sent by certified mail to the Associate Director, Division of Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20580.\n\nIX.\n\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that respondent Palm, Inc. and its successors and assigns shall, within sixty (60) days after service of this order, and at such other times as the Federal Trade Commission may require, file with the Commission a report, in writing, setting forth in detail the manner and form in which they have complied with this order.\n\nX.\n\nThis order will terminate twenty (20) years from the date of its issuance, or twenty (20) years from the most recent date that the United States or the Federal Trade Commission files a complaint (with or without an accompanying consent decree) in federal court alleging any violation of the order, whichever comes later; provided, however, that the filing of such a complaint will not affect the duration of:\n\nA. Any Part in this order that terminates in less than twenty (20) years;\n\nB. This order's application to any respondent that is not named as a defendant in such complaint; and\n\nC. This order if such complaint is filed after the order has terminated pursuant to this Part.\n\nProvided, further, that if such complaint is dismissed or a federal court rules that the respondent did not violate any provision of the order, and the dismissal or ruling is either not appealed or upheld on appeal, then the order will terminate according to this Part as though the complaint had never been filed, except that the order will not terminate between the date such complaint is filed and the later of the deadline for appealing such dismissal or ruling and the date such dismissal or ruling is upheld on appeal.\n\nSigned this ________________ day of ______________________.\n\nPalm, Inc.\n\nBy:\n\nSTEVE YU\n\nAn officer of the corporation\n\nKEVIN J.
