The event ended with a screening of AFB’s documentary, Possibilities, which included a surprise introduction from past award recipient Stevie Wonder.\n\nStrategic Plan\n\nAFB is excited to announce the release of its new strategic plan, which was adopted by the AFB Board of Trustees this past November. The plan maps out our course for the next five years, following the input we received from staff, trustees, and our valued stakeholders.\n\nAccessWorld®\n\nAccessWorld® is a reliable source of information at the intersection of disability and technology. Our quarterly publications provide honest commentary, expert insights, and trending discussions that are especially relevant to those who are blind or visually impaired.\n\nResearch & Initiatives\n\nBarriers to Digital Inclusion Survey\n\nIn 2023, there is a website or app for just about any task, and these digital platforms offer convenience, cost savings, and efficiency. Yet, digital platforms have not been designed for everyone. Researchers at AFB conducted the Barriers to Digital Inclusion Survey (BDIS) to learn about the prevalence and impacts of digital inclusion barriers faced by individuals who are blind, have low vision, or are deafblind.\n\nAFB Introduces Toolkit for HR Professionals and Hiring Managers\n\nIn response to AFB’s study last year on the challenges job seekers who are blind or have low vision face toward closing the opportunity gap, our Public Policy & Research Institute has prepared a helpful toolkit for HR professionals and hiring managers.\n\nStay Up-to-Date\n\nWe are committed to conducting high-quality research related to blindness and low vision and sharing our findings broadly. If you would like to receive information about research opportunities, reports, webinars, and other ways we are sharing our research, please sign up!"
