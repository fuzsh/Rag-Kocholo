        "text": "At Adopt-A-Family, our mission is to strengthen families with children in their efforts to achieve stability and self-sufficiency by providing access to all-encompassing services. Since 1983, Adopt-A-Family has grown into the largest service provider for homeless families in Palm Beach County - providing access to services for more than 2,000 families with children per year.\n\nRead more\n\nKnawza is a hard-working single mother who has provided a safe and stable home for her two children. However, her summer school teaching position was disrupted, leaving her with no income during the summer months. She exhausted her savings to keep the family afloat, but fell behind on rent and was threatened with eviction and faced homelessness.\n\nKnawza also gave birth prematurely to a son named Terrance, who was born with an inverted heart. The infant spent the first few months of his life in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, forcing Knawza to miss work as she tended to Terrance and her two other children.\n\nAdopt-A-Family's Housing Stabilization Program provided Knawzaa with financial assistance in order to bring them current on rent and utilities and stop the eviction proceedings. She is happy to report that baby Terrance was recently released from the hospital and is now home with the family!\n\nKnawza's family is one of the thousands helped by Adopt-A-Family in a given year.\n\nSupport Us"
