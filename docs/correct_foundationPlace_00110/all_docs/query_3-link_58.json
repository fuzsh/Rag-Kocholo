        "text": "Tourism is among Palm Beach County’s major industries. It generates an annual economic impact of approximately $10 billion in the local economy, produces $78 million in bed-tax revenue, lodging sales of approximately $1.3 billion, and supports more than 85,000 jobs. Discover Palm Beach County Inc. dba Discover The Palm Beaches (DTPB) serves as Palm Beach County’s travel planning resource for domestic and international visitors. As the official destination marketing organization charged with promoting Palm Beach County as a leisure travel and meetings destination, Discover The Palm Beaches plans and executes initiatives in a broad range of areas including sales, marketing, research, visitor services, and industry relations. The goal is to deliver the right message through the right medium to the right audience at the right time in order to increase visitation and economic impact in Palm Beach County. Discover The Palm Beaches is a private non-profit corporation that is funded primarily by the collection of a “bed tax” paid by lodging guests for short-term stays in Palm Beach County.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Palm Beach County Tourist Development Council (TDC) was established by the Palm Beach County Board of County Commissioners in 1981. In 1982, Palm Beach County enacted its first tourist tax and created a Tourist Development Plan for spending the revenues generated by the tax. The tourist tax, commonly known as the “bed tax,” is levied on lodging room nights in the County for a term of six months or less.\n\nDiscover Palm Beach County, the original name of what is now known as Discover The Palm Beaches, was formed in 1983 as a nonprofit entity. One of the original marketing and advertising statements created in this time was Palm Beach County, Florida The Best of Everything. DTPB continues to operate today under a contract with Palm Beach County to provide tourism marketing services under the County’s Tourist Development Plan and receives funding from a portion of the “bed tax” collected in the County. DTPB’s Board of Directors provides supervision over DTPB affairs.\n\nDiscover The Palm Beaches is only one of the non-profit tourism organizations acting under contract to the County. The Tourist Development Council whose responsibility is contract oversight of the agencies funded by the “bed tax,” also acts as a liaison between the agencies and the Board of County Commissioners. The other agencies under the umbrella of the TDC are the Cultural Council of Palm Beach County, the Palm Beach County Film & Television Commission, and the Palm Beach County Sports Commission.\n\nMission\n\nGrow The Tourism Economy\n\nStrategic Pillars\n\nRevenue Optimization\n\nOrganization & Destination Development\n\nCollaboration\n\nAdvocacy\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, Accessibility & Sustainability\n\nBrand Promise\n\nThe Palm Beaches are America’s First Resort Destination.
