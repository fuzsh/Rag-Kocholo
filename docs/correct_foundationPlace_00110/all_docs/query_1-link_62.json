        "text": "The abuse hotline receives 4 million calls a year – in Florida alone, where there are 21,000 children currently in foster care. Better Families prevents the need of foster care by addressing the root cause of child neglect and abuse. Parents enter this program voluntarily. Better Together host families offer temporary homes to their children, while mentors and job coaches guide parents as they work to get back on their feet.\n\nOut of the children served through hosting and mentoring, 98% of them haven’t required any state intervention. The Better Families program is keeping families together – and children out of foster care – by providing them with a temporary loving home and helping their parents work to build a better life."
