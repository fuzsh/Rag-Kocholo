        "text": "How Palm Oil Produced with Child Labor and Forced Labor Ends Up in Household Products\n\nPalm oil is an ingredient in countless products we consume, from personal care products to cooking oils. Palm oil comes from palm fruit, or the fruit of the oil palm tree, much of which is harvested in Indonesia and Malaysia under exploitative labor conditions. How does this little-known ingredient end up in so many of the goods we use at home?\n\nPhoto Credit:© migin/iStock A palm oil worker.\n\nAfter being harvested under exploitative conditions, palm fruit begins its long journey through a complex global supply chain.\n\nDense fresh fruit bunches are transported to nearby mills by the truckload, where individual palm fruits are sterilized and stripped from the bunch.\n\nThe palm fruit is then processed into two main palm oil products: crude palm oil—extracted from the flesh of the palm fruit—and crude palm kernel oil—extracted from the kernels, or seeds, at the center of the palm fruit. At this stage, crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil may be exported to other countries or transported to a local refinery for further processing.\n\nPhoto Credit:© slpu9945/iStock Palm oil, a well-balanced healthy edible oil, is now an important energy source for humans. Palm oil comes from the fruit itself (reddish orange). Today it is widely acknowledged as a versatile and nutritious vegetable oil, trans fat free with a rich content of vitamins and antioxidants. January 29, 2016.\n\nAt the refinery stage, crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil can be processed into different products. The oils can be refined, bleached, and deodorized into refined palm oil and refined palm kernel oil, and further processed to create additional ingredients, such as oleochemicals, palm olein, palm stearin, sodium lauryl sulfate or sodium laureth sulfate, and palmitic acid. These are used in common consumer products like cooking oils, confectionary and pastry fillings, margarine, infant formula, cosmetics, soaps, detergents, animal feed, and biofuels.\n\nPhoto Credit:© KYTan/Shutterstock\n\nPalm oil fruits (reddish orange) shown with everyday products that contain palm oil."
