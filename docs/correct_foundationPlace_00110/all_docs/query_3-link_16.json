        "text": "Palm will drop its long-in-the-tooth mobile operating system, Palm OS, in favor of the company's new Web OS, which will debut with its upcoming Pre phone.\n\nPalm will focus on Web OS and Windows Mobile for all future devices, company CEO Ed Colligan told investors Wednesday.\n\nThe Palm operating system has had a checkered past. The operating system was first developed under the Palm Computing umbrella in the mind-1990s. But when Palm Computing became a subsidiary of 3Com after an acquisition, Palm started to license the Palm OS through a subsidiary then called Palm Source. In 2005, Palm Source was acquired by Access and a year later Palm gained perpetual rights to the OS.\n\nOver the years, Palm OS became stale, while Palm repeatedly tried -- and failed -- to release a second-generation OS that would enable multitasking, support richer multimedia applications and yet preserve compatibility with the tens of thousands of Palm applications already out there. Meanwhile, Palm's phone increasingly came to rely on Microsoft's Windows Mobile. Now with Web OS, Palm hopes to revive some of its magic.\n\n\"We created a new platform from the ground up,\" Colligan said during the launch of the Pre at the Consumer Electronics Show last month. \"It is going to redefine the center of your access point to the Internet.\"\n\nWebOS will include features such as Palm Synergy that brings different information from calendars, contacts and instant messaging applications into a single screen. That means if the same contact is listed in\n\nOutlook, Google and Facebook accounts, it links them together into one listing, making it easy for users to chat or email with a single click.\n\nWeb OS is also easy to develop applications for, says Palm and will come with global search that searches not just the data on the phone but also the internet from a single point.\n\nThe Pre is expected to launched on Sprint's network exclusively in the first half of the year. Sprint's hold on the Pre could last longer than a few months. Palm is counting on the success of the Pre to draw in other carriers and hopes to consider other U.S. carriers for the phone in 2010, said Colligan.\n\nAlso see:\n\nPalm Unveils The Pre\n\nSix Reasons Why the Palm Pre is Special"
