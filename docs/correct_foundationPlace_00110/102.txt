USA Palm was founded in 2014 by Logan Tighe, a 16-year-old high school student who was inspired by the joy and memories he experienced on family vacations. Logan's passion for art, design, and style are reflected in each and every one of our unique clothing items. We believe that clothing is a form of expression and strive to create functional, high-quality pieces that embody the essence of the palm life - from the peaks to the palms.

As a family-owned company, we take pride in our attention to detail and focus on customer satisfaction. Our designs are carefully crafted to balance style and functionality, with a keen eye for detail, print, color, and customer demand. Our goal is to create clothing that not only looks good but performs well in everyday life, whether you're exploring the great outdoors or simply enjoying a day at the beach.

We're passionate about sustainability and take pride in our use of high-quality materials that are gentle on the environment. We're committed to reducing our carbon footprint and minimizing waste wherever possible.

Thank you for choosing USA Palm for all of your adventure-ready clothing needs. We're thrilled to be a part of your journey!
