        "text": "Welcome\n\nWelcome to Celebrating Einstein! The WVU Physics and Astronomy Department and the School of Theatre and Dance invite you to enjoy and learn from this multimedia extravaganza that is designed to communicate the beauty and significance of Einstein’s theory of General Relativity. Through danced lectures and orchestra performances, artwork and demonstrations, lectures and planetarium shows, and even a Space Race Fun Run, we hope you feel inspired.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, everything is FREE!\n\nProducers\n\nKathryn Williamson is a Teaching Assistant Professor in the WVU Physics and Astronomy Department and a member of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology. She attended the original Celebrating Einstein event as a graduate student at Montana State University in 2013 and was awed and inspired. When she came to WVU in 2016, she began to organize how to bring Celebrating Einstein to Morgantown and West Virginia. She is very excited to be able to engage people of all ages and all backgrounds and interests in Einstein's theories and the recent discovery of gravitational waves!\n\nKathryn also manages the WVU Planetarium and started the West Virginia Science Public Outreach Team (SPOT), which trains college students to give science-themed presentations to students throughout the Mountain State. Her current area of research focuses on how youth in out-of-school-time science clubs, such as the Pulsar Search Collaboratory and Skynet Junior Scholars, learn to see themselves as scientists and choose to pursue careers in science. She also worked as the Public Education Specialist at the Green Bank Observatory prior to coming to WVU.\n\nJessica Morgan Bishop is an Associate Professor of Stage Movement in the School of Theatre & Dance where she teaches in the BFA and MFA Acting Studios. She also serves as a Fight Director and Movement Coach for WVU productions and the Coordinator and Faculty Advisor of the Community Children's Theatre. Jessica has trained with the Society of American Fight Directors, Anne Bogart / SITI Company, and Marcel Marceau. Her work in the classroom focuses on Suzuki, Viewpoints, Composition and Experimental Theatre, Laban Effort Qualities, Mask Work, Period Movement, and Unarmed Combat. As an actor she has performed professionally throughout the region for Unseam'd Shakespeare Company, IF Theatre Collective, Weathervane Playhouse, Mountain State Repertory, and Greenbrier Valley Theatre, as well as for the ETA Hoffmann Theatre in Bamberg, Germany. Most recently, she appeared in the staged readings of Not Someone Like Me at WVU, directed by Chris Sarandon, Miss Zelda: Reflections of a Southern Belle in both Morgantown and New York City, and in A Christmas Carol with West Virginia Public Theatre. Jessica has a special interest in creating original movement based theatrical work both in the classroom and for the stage, and is very excited to be a part of bringing Celebrating Einstein to life as Director/Producer of the Danced Lecture.\n\nSean McWilliams is an Assistant Professor in the WVU Physics and Astronomy Department. He is a member of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology, and played a significant role in the LIGO discovery of gravitational waves. He is a gravitational wave astronomer, numerical and analytical relativist, and data analyst. His research focuses mainly on understanding the dynamics of compact binaries, which are systems composed of any combination of black holes, neutron stars, and white dwarfs. Through numerical simulations and analytical modeling, he studies the behavior of these highly dense objects, which stretch Einstein’s theory of general relativity to its limit. He was also a theatre performer in his younger days, and wrote and will perform in the series of Danced Lectures.\n\nStephanie McWilliams is a Clinical Instructor in the WVU Psychology Department. She received her Master’s Degree in Clinical Psychology at Columbia University in New York and a post-Masters specialization in Sport and Exercise Psychology from California University of Pennsylvania. Stephanie is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in Kinesiology with a specialization in Youth Mentorship from West Virginia University. Stephanie has danced from a very young age, and continues to choreograph and perform with her families’ studio in Northeastern Pennsylvania. She attended Bucknell University for her undergraduate education and was a member of the Bucknell Dance Company, along with receiving a minor in dance. Stephanie is the choreographer the WVU Celebrating Einstein danced lecture.\n\nMaura McLaughlin is a Professor of Astronomy in the WVU Physics & Astronomy Department. She is the Director of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology, and her research interests involve studying neutron stars and their environments through radio, X-ray and gamma-ray observations. Neutron stars are amazing physical laboratories for general relativity, studies of the interstellar medium, high-energy particle and plasma physics, and studies of stellar evolution. A significant research aim, as chair of the NANOGrav collaboration, is to use neutron stars to detect gravitational waves through timing an array of ultra-precise millisecond pulsars. She is the Principal Investigator of the International Pulsar Timing Array for gravitational wave detection. She also helps high school students discover pulsars through the Pulsar Search Collaboratory, which is featured in the \"little green men\" film. Maura is also an oboe player in the Morgantown Community Orchestra, which is performing \"A Shout Across Time.\"\n\nZachariah Etienne is a Professor in the WVU Math Department and a member of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology. His research centers on modeling some of the most extreme events in the Universe on supercomputers, including gravitational wave and gamma-ray bursts. Zachariah is also part of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration and his work within the collaboration has deepened our understanding of the black holes involved in the first detections of gravitational waves.\n\nDuncan Lorimer is a Professor in the WVU Physics & Astronomy Department and a member of the Center for Gravitational Waves and Cosmology. His research is on compact objects (black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs) which he studies using radio pulsars: rapidly spinning, highly magnetized neutron stars. He discovered Fast Radio Bursts in 2015, which has led to a new classification of radio signals. He also helps high school students discover pulsars through the Pulsar Search Collaboratory, which is featured in the \"little green men\" film. Duncan is also a musician and will play a song he wrote called \"Gravitation\" during the \"A Shout Across Time\" intermission.\n\nMaureen Mansfield Kaddar is a part-time lecturer in dance for the WVU School of Theatre and Dance. She received her MFA from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and is a member of the National Dance Educator's Association (NDEO), International Association for Dance Medicine and Science (IADMS), and the American College Dance Association (ACDA). As a professional dancer, she performed with Paul Taylor Dance Company. She choreographs for WVU dance and theatre productions and works as a guest artist with other regional and national dance schools and companies. Passionate about the power of building learning connections through movement, Maureen enjoyed teaching Arts Integration in the public schools of Morgantown through a WV state grant. She has choreographed the abstract dance, “Epic”, which follows the danced lecture.\n\nDancers\n\nAndra Ward Jr. is thrilled to be Celebrating Einstein at WVU. He is as a second year MFA Acting Student here at WVU, where you may have seen him in Pericles,Race, Arabian Nights, and The Beaux' Stratagem. Some of his favorite roles include, Thomas Donahue (These Shining Lives), William King (Brokology) and Trekkie Monster (Avenue Q) as well as roles in Traveling Thomas and, Complete Female Stage Beauty. He strives to continue to learn and grow with talented artists and is grateful for all things achieved thus far. He would like to thank Rae Charles and family for all of their continued support through the years.\n\nBethany McPherson is a sophomore at WVU, studying Sport and Exercise Psychology with a minor in Dance. She is the founder and president of the WVU Circus Arts club, and she is in the process of starting a circus and aerial arts program for youth in the Morgantown community.
