        "text": "Susan Abigail Tomalin was born on 4th. of October 1946 in Jackson Heights, NY and grew up in Edison, New Jersey. She was the oldest of 9 children (5 girls and 4 boys). Her father Philip Leslie Tomalin, a former bigband-singer, worked as television and advertising executive, and her mother was Lenora Marie Tomalin.\n\nSusan grew up in an Catholic and very conservative family. She went to an Roman Catholic elementary school run by nuns and later, in high school, she was arrested for her involvement in Vietnam and Civil Rights protests.\n\nSusan attended Catholic University in Washington, DC, where she studied drama, English, philosophy and military strategy and earned her degree in drama. During her studies, Susan lived with her grandparents and worked as a secretary for the drama department and as a model.\n\nSusan had no aspirations to be an actress until she met the graduate drama student Chris Sarandon. They both maried in September 1967. After graduating in 1968, Susan took some modelling-jobs and her husband found work at the regional theatres around Washington. Then, one day in 1970 changed her whole life, when she accompanied her husband on a reading for an agent in New York City. The agent signed both of them for the film \"Joe\" of the Director John Avildsen!\n\nIn 1975, after many bad roles, Susan appeared in the low- budget musical \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" which she was urged to film by her friend and actor of the main character Tim Curry. Its also the first role where Susan has to sing! The film flopped at the box-offices but became cult-status.\n\nIn 1978 she played the part of Hattie, the mother of a prostitute in the film \"Pretty Baby\" by Louis Malle and she also was casted for Louis Malle´s next film \"Atlantic City\" amd earned an Academy Award Nomination. Susan fell in love with Louis Malle and divorced Chris Sarandon in 1979.\n\nAfter her breakup with Louis Malle she dated Sean Penn and became involved with the italian director Franco Amurri, who is the father of her first child, Eva Marie Livia Amurri.\n\nIn 1988 she played Annie Savoy in \"Bull Durham\" co-starring Tim Robbins. She became romantically involved with the 12 years younger man during the filming. They both live together until now and have two children: Jack Henry and Miles.\n\nIn 1991 she played alongside Geena Davis in \"Thelma and Louise\" and won an Oscar Nomination. The following year, she was nominated again for playing in \"Lorenzo´s Oil\" beside Nick Nolte.\n\nIn 1995 she finally got the golden statue for Best Actress in \"Dead Man Walking\", an autobiographical film directed by Tim Robbins. The co-star was her former lover Sean Penn and even her daughter Eva played a small role.\n\nSusan Sarandon currently lives in New York City together with Tim Robbins. She is one of Hollywoods most visible activists for many political , cultural and health groups."
