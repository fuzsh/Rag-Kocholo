        "text": "FAIRFIELD, Conn.—Oscar-nominated actor Chris Sarandon will host the next segment of his podcast series Cooking By Heart at Sacred Heart University Community Theatre in Fairfield on May 23 at 7 p.m. as part of the Theatre’s Thought Leader series. This live episode, sponsored by WSHU, will feature celebrated chef, restauranteur and best-selling author Alice Waters.\n\nWaters, known for her world-renowned restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley, California and pioneering the farm-to-table movement, expressed excitement about the podcast. “I look forward to joining my friend Chris on stage to talk about the past and future of food and, of course, hopefulness,” said Waters. She will be signing copies of her latest book, We Are What We Eat, in the theatre after the podcast.\n\nGrowing up helping his restauranteur father and a Greek-cook mother, Sarandon developed a deep passion for cooking and storytelling. “I'm interested in the stories behind the food we all grew up with, the characters and situations that have played such important roles in our lives, the memories that are evoked when we eat something now that takes us back, the smells, the tastes and the people who were there,” he said. “I hope our listeners will enjoy these stories, the guests and their memories—and all the great recipes!”\n\nPast episodes recorded at SHU Community Theatre include interviews with Jacques Pepin, Lidia Bastianich and Susan Sarandon.\n\nTickets for the live episode with Sarandon and Waters are available at www.shucommunitytheatre.org.\n\nAbout Sacred Heart University\n\nAs the second-largest independent Catholic university in New England, and one of the fastest-growing private doctoral institutions in the U.S., Sacred Heart University is a national leader in shaping higher education for the 21st century. SHU offers nearly 90 undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and certificate programs on its Fairfield, Conn., campus. Sacred Heart also has a campus in Dingle, Ireland, and offers online programs. More than 10,000 students attend the University’s nine colleges and schools: Arts & Sciences; Communication, Media & the Arts; Social Work; Computer Science & Engineering; Health Professions; the Isabelle Farrington College of Education & Human Development; the Jack Welch College of Business & Technology; the Dr. Susan L. Davis, R.N., & Richard J. Henley College of Nursing; and St. Vincent’s College. Sacred Heart stands out from other Catholic institutions as it was established and led by laity. The contemporary Catholic university is rooted in the rich Catholic intellectual tradition and the liberal arts, and at the same time cultivates students to be forward thinkers who enact change—in their own lives, professions and in their communities. The Princeton Review includes SHU in its Best 389 Colleges: 2024 Edition, and Best Business Schools: 2023 Edition. Sacred Heart is home to the award-winning, NPR-affiliate station, WSHU Public Radio, a Division I athletics program and an impressive performing arts program that includes choir, band, dance and theatre. www.sacredheart.edu"
