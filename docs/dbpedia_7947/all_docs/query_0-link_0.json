        "text": "In a black box theater at the base of the West Virginia University Creative Arts Center, a New York theater actor sat across from a handful of students this fall, giving measured and helpful advice.\n\nThey took a three-day journey together. The students bonded with the material in âNot Someone Like Meâ about real-life accounts of sexual assaults and discovered more about their approaches to acting. Across from them was Chris Sarandonâyou probably know him as the baddie prince who tried to marry Buttercup in âThe Princess Brideââ who saw student actors at work at the same university where he learned the craft. He graduated from WVU with a bachelor of fine arts in 1964.\n\nâThis is the place that formed me, and yet it was the beginning of a profound metamorphosis in a way in that I was ready to go out into the world. And thatâs what this place did,â Sarandon said.\n\nOver the years, WVU arts students have learned from a variety of proven artists who have risen in the top of their fields. Performers from âDancing with the Starsâ and âSo You Think You Can Danceâ worked with dance students prior to an area performance. Emmy Award-winning, âStar Trekâ composer Jay Chattaway taught and spoke to students about how he approaches composing.\n\nSee Sarandon talk about the power of theater in this video.\n\n-WVU-\n\ndm/rt/10//14\n\nCONTACT: University Relations/News\n\n304-293-6997\n\nFollow @WVUToday on Twitter."
