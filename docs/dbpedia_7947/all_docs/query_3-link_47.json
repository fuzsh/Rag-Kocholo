        "text": "Remember that hitcher you picked up in 1974 — late 20s; pretty with short, wavy, red hair; looking for a lift to the University of Texas? That might have been Susan Sarandon. She was in town at the time filming “The Great Waldo Pepper” with Robert Redford and Bo Svenson.\n\n“I learned to throw pots in Austin,” she says. “I would get up in the morning, and if the sky was clear and it was beautiful as it seems to always be, then I would hitchhike — because I was crazy — to the university, where I was taking a potting class.”\n\nThe actor is back in town, but you’re much less likely to find her thumbing for a ride. Sarandon is here to accept the Extraordinary Contribution to Filmmaking (Acting) Award on Saturday at the Austin Film Festival’s annual luncheon.\n\nSarandon’s Internet Movie Database page is remarkable, revealing only three years since her debut in 1970’s “Joe” that she has not appeared onscreen. How has she managed to forge such a long and steady career in such a notoriously fickle industry?\n\n“I have no idea,” she says. “I mean, I’ve done everything wrong.”\n\nHard work probably had something to do with it. The only years Sarandon took off were those in which she gave birth to her three children, and each time she was convinced it would be the end of her career.\n\n“I think maybe being a character actor helps with your longevity as opposed to an ingenue and a leading lady. I always saw myself as a character actor,” she says.\n\nSarandon studied theater at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. “I knew I wanted to get out of New Jersey and attend college,” she says. But, “it wasn’t Juilliard, and as an undergraduate you didn’t do anything, really.”\n\nShe married graduate student Chris Sarandon and read with him when he went on auditions in New York City.\n\n“John Avildsen was trying to cast his first film, which was ‘Joe,’ and they hadn’t been able to find anybody, and I went up for it,” she recalls. “They said ‘do an improvisation’ — and they explained what that was — and I did it. They said ‘OK, give us a minute,’ and then they said ‘All right, let’s do this.’ It was the first non-pornographic film that company ever made.”\n\nSarandon portrayed the drug-abusing daughter of Dennis Patrick, appearing with Peter Boyle in the first film for which she ever auditioned.\n\nShe has performed in many milestone films since then: “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” “Atlantic City,” “Bull Durham,” and “Thelma and Louise” come effortlessly to mind. In the current climate of big-budget blockbusters, the actor is pragmatic.\n\n“I think most of the films I made probably wouldn’t be made today or wouldn’t be made the way they were. ‘Thelma and Louise‘ was pretty unbelievable because the producer gave a lot of power to (director) Ridley (Scott). I don’t think that happens very much anymore on a big-budget film,” she says.\n\nSarandon told the director that she wanted to play Louise and asked him if both characters would die at the end of the movie.\n\n“He said, ‘I’m not sure about (Thelma), but I can tell you that you will. We’ll see about whether you push her out of the car.’ I think by the time we shot the ending, we had earned the right to go over together,” she says.\n\nSarandon is thankful that the film avoided today’s committee decisions and politics.\n\n“I think when you’re in that system that you’re trying so hard to keep your job that rarely will you find individuals who really go on the line to champion something. It’s much easier and safer to say no or to be careful, and that’s not a very fertile ground for anything special to find a foothold.”\n\nOne special project Sarandon is anxious to share with AFF audiences is “Romance and Cigarettes,” John Turturro’s 2005 fantasy-comedy-musical in which she stars as Kitty Kane, the wife of James Gandolfini’s adulterous Nick Murder. The film is unusual, with characters breaking into musical numbers, singing along with the original artists’ recordings of such numbers as “Prisoner of Love,” “Delilah” and “Piece of My Heart.” The actress chose the film for a retrospective screening on Friday afternoon.\n\n“So often, when I have a retrospective, it’s just a really nice opportunity for people to see something which I think is so unusual,” says Sarandon, who claims to deliver the film’s most boring performance. “Kate Winslet is unbelievable in it, and you get to see Steve Buscemi and Chris Walken and all these people — Mary Louise Parker, Mandy Moore, Bobby Cannavale — in this very sweet but very original film.”\n\nShe especially treasures memories of working with Gandolfini, who died four months ago.\n\n“It’s a shame (he) is not with us any longer, but he was very brave during the filming of that because, you’ll see — he was not in his comfort zone, doing what he had to do,” she says.\n\n“I think it’s a treat for people who have an open mind, and I think that Austin is that kind of place.”"
