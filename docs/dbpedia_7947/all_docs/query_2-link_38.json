        "text": "Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n\n– Casablanca, Michael Curitz\n\nMission\n\nA community-based 501(c)3 non-profit organization, Sag Harbor Cinema Arts Center is dedicated to presenting the past, present and future of the movies and to preserving and educating about films, filmmaking, and the film-going experience in its three state-of-the-art theaters and in the surrounding community. The Cinema engages its audiences and the community year-round through dialogue, discovery, and appreciation of the moving image – from blockbusters to student shorts and everything in between. Revitalized and reimagined through unprecedented community efforts to rebuild the iconic Main Street structure after a fire nearly destroyed it in 2016, SHC continues a tradition of entertainment, education, and enrichment in the heart of Sag Harbor Village.\n\nA Brief History of the Cinema\n\nFor over a century, a theater in Sag Harbor has been a landmark in the lively and culturally diverse Main Street district of Sag Harbor, New York, long a haven for writers, artists, and independent thinkers.\n\nDesigned by renowned architect John Eberson—one of the great designers of atmospheric theaters—and beckoning moviegoers since the 1930s with its classic art deco neon sign, the original Sag Harbor Cinema stands as a symbol of the progression of 20th-century culture. It began as a vaudeville and burlesque theater in the 1890s, then became a silent movie house that evolved to show talkies, and after its purchase in 1978 became one of the few single-screen arthouse cinemas left in the country, thanks to the stewardship of Gerald Mallow, its owner and programmer for 38 years.\n\nIn July 2016, the Sag Harbor Partnership had begun negotiating with Mr. Mallow to purchase the theater and preserve it as a non-profit “art-house” Cinema. But on December 16, 2016, the cinema was partially destroyed by a massive fire that ripped through Sag Harbor’s Main Street, damaging several adjacent buildings. Firefighters from 19 companies courageously stopped the blaze, icicles hanging from their helmets, after hours in extreme conditions.\n\nThe theater’s façade and lobby had to be demolished, but its auditorium remained standing and its iconic sign was salvaged from the rubble and repaired, gratis, by community volunteers Chris Denon of North Fork Moving and Storage and sculptor and ironworker John Battle. The fire in December altered negotiations, and the purchase of the Cinema was not finalized until April 2017.\n\nAfter extensive consultation with successful art-house Cinemas like the Jacob Burns Film Center, the stewards of this volunteer effort by the Sag Harbor Partnership settled on a multiple screen cinema, reconstructed with the help of NK Architects and ConRac Construction Co. with three separate theaters, each with its own character, and with salvaged and replicated historic details to acknowledge its storied history. The original two-story building was also built up to three stories to maximize its potential and help ensure its sustainability.\n\nBecause of the Covid pandemic and a nearly six month construction delay, what was projected as the theater’s reopening in April 2020 had to be postponed. The Cinema finally received its Certificate of Occupancy in fall 2020, and had its official opening in June of 2021.\n\nWho We Are\n\nStaff\n\nGenevieve Villaflor, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\nThroughout her career, Genevieve Villaflor has been involved with film festivals, non-profit organizations, and specialty publicity firms, working in programming, PR, fundraising, special events, and artist support.
