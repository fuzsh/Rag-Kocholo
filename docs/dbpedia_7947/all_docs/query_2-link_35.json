It was during one of his lowest points he began to pray to God and surrender his life to Him. It was at this moment his Spiritual Awakening began. Things started to happen that did not make sense. He started to hear, see and feel things that were “not of this world.” Teachers showed up out of nowhere, making it seem as if he was on a divinely guided path which contained some sort of predestined plan. Anthony was told he was a psychic medium, and so began his development with Spirit.\n\nAnthony bridges the gap between the living and the deceased. He can hear, feel and see souls on the other side to bring you the closure you may need from your loved ones.\n\nYou can find Anthony on the road doing live events throughout the country or at home in NJ doing private readings and mentoring students.

With all due respect to the late James Brown.\n\nHofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' \"Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson\", Showtime's \"White Boyz in the Hood\", VH1's \"Countdown\", Sundance's \"On the Road in America\", and ABC's \"Barbara Walter's Special\", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of \"Laughs\" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally.\n\nOne of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan.\n\nAfter hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album (\"Cure For the Cable Guy\") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album (\"Dark Side of the Room\") was the first ever pay-what-you-want\" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts.\n\nHofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook (still the world record), 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores.\n\nWhile Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Our Balcony section for main room shows is NOT wheelchair accessible.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons."
