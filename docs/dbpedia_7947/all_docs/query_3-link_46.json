        "text": "The Baltimore Comic-Con returns for its 24th year at the Inner Harbor’s Baltimore Convention Center on September 8-10, 2023. In honor of the 30th anniversary of The Nightmare Before Christmas, the Baltimore Comic-Con is pleased to announce the addition of media guests Chris Sarandon and Ken Page. Get your tickets online now!\n\nChris Sarandon is an actor and voice actor who is known best for playing Prince Humperdinck in the movie The Princess Bride, the vampire Jerry Dandridge in Fright Night, and Detective Mike Norris in the first entry of the Child’s Play series, and for providing the voice of Jack Skellington in The Nightmare Before Christmas. Sarandon was born and raised in Beckley, West Virginia. He earned a degree in performing arts at West Virginia University. In 1968, Sarandon relocated to New York City, where he obtained his first television role as Dr. Tom Halverson for the series The Guiding Light before obtaining the role of Al Pacino’s wife in Dog Day Afternoon (1975), a performance which earned him nominations for Best New Male Star of the Year at the Golden Globes and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sarandon reprised his role as Jack Skellington in Disney Infinity, Disney Infinity 3.0, Disney Infinity Marvel Super Heroes, and Kingdom Hearts II video games. He has also made appearances in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, ER, The Wild Thornberrys, Felicity, Judging Amy, Charmed, Law & Order, Psych, The Good Wife, and on the Netflix hit original series Orange is the New Black.\n\nKen Page is an American actor and cabaret singer. Page is best known as the voices of King Gator in All Dogs Go to Heaven and Oogie Boogie in The Nightmare Before Christmas franchise. He also created the role of Ken in the original Broadway production of Ain’t Misbehavin’, and played the role of Old Deuteronomy in both the original Broadway and filmed stage productions of Cats as well as Max Washington in Dreamgirls.\n\n“This is thrilling,” said Marc Nathan, show promoter for the Baltimore Comic-Con. “The Nightmare Before Christmas, in which both of these actors performed starring roles, is such an iconic movie, as are their respective characters. In addition, they’ve both acted in major hits and are exceptionally talented. We are so excited to have them to our 2023 show, and fans won’t want to miss them this year!”"
