        "text": "Christopher McDonald '77\n\nDescribed by the New York Times as one of the hardest working and most prolific actors in Hollywood, Christopher McDonald '77 discovered a passion for acting while attending Hobart College. McDonald appeared in several productions at the Colleges before going on to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the world-renowned Stella Adler Acting Conservatory in New York.\n\nSince then, McDonald has performed in nearly 100 films and countless television and theater productions. Currently, McDonald is known to television audiences as Tommy Jefferson in NBC's \"Harry's Law,\" starring alongside Academy Award winning actress Kathy Bates. He also has a role on HBO's acclaimed mini-series \"Boardwalk Empire\" where he plays U.S. Attorney General Harry Daugherty. On the silver screen, he has starred in such films as \"Requiem for a Dream,\" \"Thelma and Louise,\" \"The Perfect Storm,\" \"Quiz Show\" and \"Happy Gilmore,\" working with such acclaimed actors as Ellen Burstyn, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Ralph Fiennes and Susan Sarandon.\n\nOne of seven children, McDonald came to Hobart intending to study science, but that all changed when he joined Little Theatre. Discovering a passion for acting, he switched his major to theatre after appearing in several productions. His passion for acting was further cemented when he was exposed to West End Theatre in London while studying abroad during his senior year.\n\nFollowing graduation, he went on to study at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, and the world-renowned Stella Adler Acting Conservatory in New York. He reprised his role as Billy Flynn in the 10th Anniversary of Broadway's \"Chicago,\" sharing the stage with Broadway legends Joel Grey and Chita Rivera, and is the recipient of the Drama-Logue Best Actor Award.\n\nFrom there, McDonald started small, getting cast in \"Grease 2\" and appearing on NBC's \"Cheers\" in the early 1980s. In 1991, McDonald landed his first big role as Darryl in \"Thelma and Louise\" with Golden Globe-winning actor Brad Pitt and Academy Award-winning actress Susan Sarandon.\n\nIn 1996, after turning the movie down twice, McDonald took the role of Shooter McGavin in \"Happy Gilmore\" with Adam Sandler.\n\nWhile at Hobart, McDonald played football and was a goalie on the varsity soccer team. He was song master of the Kappa Alpha Society and received his degree in English, cum laude. McDonald has returned to campus numerous times to present lectures, network with students, participate in Reunion and, in 2008, to co-emcee William Smith College's Centennial Gala with his friend and former teacher, Mara O'Laughlin '66. He recently pledged $1 million to the Performing Arts Center, the final capital project of Campaign for the Colleges."
