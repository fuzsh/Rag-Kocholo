Price holds the role of Associate Professor of Africana Studies and Political Science at Rutgers University, as well as an Endowed Professor of Political Science at Prairie View A&M University. She serves as the principal investigator for the African American Studies Initiative funded by the Mellon Foundation. Dr. Price is a distinguished author known for her groundbreaking work.\n\nHer book, The Race Whisperer: Barack Obama and the Political Uses of Race, offers a profound exploration of the complex dynamics of race in the age of Obama, making significant contributions to the study of race and politics, public opinion, and political campaigns. In addition, her work Dreaming Blackness: Black Nationalism and African American Public Opinion presents a multi-faceted perspective on African American political views, shedding new light on race specific ideological beliefs and their influence within the African American community. Her research underscores the enduring significance of Black Nationalism, a perspective that deserves attention from scholars and policymakers alike.\n\nSpring 2023\n\nRichard Benjamin is a cultural anthropologist who researches contemporary U.S. politics and culture, specializing in democracy, social relations, space and place, demographics and race.

The book tackles, also, critical questions of migration, diaspora, racialization, and nation-making. Talk to Me will be published by Pantheon Books, Penguin Random House. Benjamin’s current research agenda also focuses on the nexus of technology, money, and society—specifically fin-tech, wherein technology and digital finance increasingly dominate the economy, and high finance is increasingly digitized. Benjamin’s next research project investigates the socio-cultural dimensions of quants, flash-trading, crypto assets, hedge funds, extreme wealth, risk, and what he calls “heterosexual melancholy.”\n\nFall 2022\n\nSusana M.

The book project conceptualizes a Black and Indigenous “analytics of the flesh” to think and feel with Black and Indigenous feminist and queer poetics, critique, dreams, ecologies, and praxis as sites of rupture that expose existing decolonial and abolitionist presents and futures.\n\nSpring 2021\n\nSylvia Chan-Malik is a scholar of American studies, critical race and ethnic studies, women’s and gender studies, and religious studies.
