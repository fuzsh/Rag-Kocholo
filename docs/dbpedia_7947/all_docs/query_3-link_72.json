        "text": "Growing Up in a Big Family\n\nSusan Sarandon was born in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, in 1946. It was probably a very loud household, considering she is the eldest of nine children! She has four brothers and four sisters, who were all brought up Roman Catholic, just like her.\n\nHer parents believed in hard work and dedication, which was probably the spark that ignited Sarandon’s passion for human rights and social justice. Sarandon and her siblings all attended Catholic schools, and she was often involved in school plays and productions, taking the lead role. Sarandon and her sisters were also great swimmers and won several competitions.\n\nFighting for Her Beliefs\n\nAs we said, Sarandon’s passion for human rights and social justice started early on — at least at a much younger age than most people we know. The early 60s came along, and they brought along the US involvement in the Vietnam War, which struck a chord with young Susan.\n\nWhen she was just a high school student in New Jersey, she attended several protests and rallies against the Vietnam War, being a fierce believer in civil rights. In fact, Sarandon attended so many of these events that she was arrested several times for unlawful behavior. However, these early events would be the base for a long and passionate life in activism.\n\nIndependent From a Young Age\n\nIn 1964, Sarandon graduated from high school and enrolled in the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. She obtained her B.A. in drama in 1968, all the while supporting herself with odd jobs, even after finishing her degree. We all know how hard it is to support yourself financially while being in college.\n\nOf course, tuition back then wasn't as steep as it is today, but that doesn't belittle Sarandon's achievements. Sarandon worked in several jobs to pay for her education and lifestyle, such as cleaning houses, cutting hair, operating switchboards, and others. From a young age, Sarandon believed in being economically independent and working hard for oneself.\n\nA Necessary Marriage\n\nBack when she was Susan Tomalin, a 17-year-old freshman at Catholic University, she met Chris Sarandon, a graduate student. This man played a very important role in her life. He was Susan’s first boyfriend, first intimate experience, and first everything.\n\nSeeing as they were in a Catholic college, they had to get married or face getting kicked out. They tied the knot in 1967, and Susan recalls that they would decide at the end of each year if they wanted to stay together and renew their vows. Finally, in 1979, they decided to separate, but she kept his surname.\n\nHer First Acting Gig\n\nIt turns out that Susan’s first and only husband, Chris Sarandon, was also an aspiring actor. This must be one of the reasons why the two were such a good match. There is nothing like a shared passion to bring people together and bond them.\n\nAnd so, shortly after graduation, in 1969, she and Chris attended an audition for a dark, grimy N.Y. film called “Joe.” Chris didn’t get the part, but Susan was offered the role of Melissa Compton, a young woman with substance abuse problems whose father eventually killed her boyfriend and dealer. This role launched her acting career.\n\nSarandon’s Broadway Debut\n\nWhile most of us know Susan from the screen, she wasn't limited to it and looked for opportunities to get parts and jobs in stage productions as well. Shortly after starring in “Joe,” Sarandon made her Broadway debut in 1972.\n\nShe was cast to play the role of Tricia Nixon, Richard Nixon’s daughter, in the play “An Evening With Richard Nixon,” based on a famous Gore Vidal book. Apart from playing Tricia, Sarandon embodied other roles as well. The play not only cemented her as a serious theater actress but was also the beginning of a lifelong friendship with Gore Vidal.\n\nThe Soap Opera Years\n\nMost of us are used to thinking about acting as an unstable career, moving from one project to another, never knowing when the next paycheck is coming. Soap opera stars, however, change that perception. After showing the world what she was capable of, Sarandon was cast in two major soap operas from 1970 to 1972.\n\nThese were “A World Apart,” where she played the role of Patrice Kahlman, and “Search for Tomorrow,” where she played the murderous Sarah Fairbanks. It’s strange to imagine a Hollywood icon like Susan Sarandon in a soap opera, but that’s actually how a lot of movie stars got their start in show business.\n\nHer First Big Role\n\nIn 1975, Susan Sarandon was cast in what would be a pivotal role in her career, that of Janet Weiss in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” The musical comedy horror film became a cult classic and is considered by many to be one of the greatest musicals of all time.\n\nShe was perfect for the role of a young, wide-eyed new bride witnessing a world of curiosities for the first time. Sarandon’s stellar performance led her to get cast in another film that same year. Sarandon acted alongside Robert Redford in the American drama “The Great Waldo Pepper” as female lead Mary Beth.\n\nA French Romance\n\nIn 1978, a young Susan Sarandon was cast to star in French director Louis Malle’s historical drama film, “Pretty Baby.” Alongside a young Brooke Shields (who was only 12 years old at the time, mind you) and actor Keith Carradine, Sarandon played a prostitute in New Orleans’ 1917 red light district.\n\nDuring the film's production, Sarandon and director Malle start a romance that lasts for quite a while. Malle was 14 years older than her and completely smitten by Sarandon. They went on to work on a second film some years later, which earned the actress her first Oscar nomination.\n\nSarandon’s First Academy Award Nomination\n\nIn 1981, Sarandon was cast in another one of Louis Malle’s films. This time, it was “Atlantic City.” The film was a romantic crime drama that was a critical and commercial success, being nominated for five Academy Awards.\n\nSarandon played the lead female role of Sally, a disenfranchised waitress who’s just trying to make ends meet. Her portrayal was so incredible that it earned Sarandon her first Oscar nomination for Best Actress in the 1982 Academy Awards Ceremony. This was only the beginning of a long line of accolades, awards, and nominations that will decorate this star's career in the future.\n\nHer Most Controversial Film\n\nLabeled as an erotic horror film, 1983’s “The Hunger” was quite controversial, to say the least. Though, to be fair, any movie featuring David Bowie is bound to raise some kind of controversy. Starring David Bowie, Susan Sarandon, and Catherine Deneuve, the film is a modern vampire story with some adult scenes that are considered very racy.\n\nOne of the most notable and controversial aspects of Susan Sarandon’s acting career is when she and Catherine Deneuve appear in a particularly intimate love scene. Many considered this to be the only scene worth watching out of the entire film.\n\nHer Romance With David Bowie\n\nFew people know about the relationship between Susan Sarandon and David Bowie. The two became very close after filming “The Hunger,” and Susan said in interviews years later that it was a serious romance that came to an end because the rockstar wanted to have a family.\n\nDue to her health issues with endometriosis, Susan said she believed she “wasn’t meant to have kids.” Bowie eventually fell in love and married Iman, the gorgeous Somali supermodel, and the two had a daughter. Sarandon and Bowie both lived in New York City for decades and remained friends right up until Bowie’s death.\n\nAn Amazing Surprise\n\nIn 1984, Susan Sarandon met her next partner in Italy. His name was Franco Amurri. The special man was a film director back then, and the two fell in love almost instantly. Sarandon later joked that while they were dating, Amurri still lived with his parents.\n\nThey became inseparable, and the biggest surprise came when Sarandon got pregnant at age 39. Up until that point, Sarandon didn't think she could conceive at all. In fact, her doctors had told her this was not possible due to a severe condition of endometriosis. Alas, she and Amurri welcomed daughter Eva in 1985.\n\nThe Witch of Eastwick\n\nWith her history in productions such as \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Hunger,\" it seems that Sarandon has a soft spot for dark comedy films. She kept venturing into that scene, and her next acting gig was playing one of the witches in the mysterious dark fantasy “The Witches of Eastwick.”\n\nThe film, directed by George Miller, starred Cher, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jack Nicholson. The 1987 film was a commercial and critical success, and Sarandon went on to land what was probably one of the most important roles of her career. Certainly, the one that made her a household name.\n\nHer Claim to Fame\n\nIn 1988, Susan Sarandon was cast to play the lead female role in “Bull Durham,” considered by many as one of the greatest sports movies of all time. Alongside Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins, Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a baseball fan and spiritual seeker who causes romantic drama.\n\nThe film was a commercial hit, grossing more than $50 million on a budget of $9 million. It was also beloved by critics and audiences, many praising Sarandon’s role above any other. The actress has said that she flew roundtrip across the globe just to audition for the part. Clearly, the right decision!\n\nFalling in Love With a Co-Star\n\nOne thing that is pretty common in the entertainment industry is for on-screen romances to seep into real life. Susan is no exception. Another great thing that came out of Sarandon’s performance in “Bull Durham,” apart from the critical praise and accolades, was a real-life love story.\n\nDuring the shooting, Sarandon fell for co-star Tim Robbins, who played Ebby Calvin “Nuke” LaLoosh, a rookie pitcher. At the time, Sarandon was dating Franco Amurri, from whom she separated in 1988. Shortly after, Sarandon and Robbins began dating and stayed together for 21 years, until 2009. During that time, they had two sons, Miles and Jack Robbins.\n\nThe Great 1990s\n\nThe 90s ushered in a great decade for Susan Sarandon, becoming the decade where she starred in some of Hollywood’s biggest films. In the late 80s, she was obviously still acting, but not in major blockbusters. From 1988 to 1990, she starred in lesser-known films, such as “White Palace,” “The January Man,” “Sweet Hearts Dance,” and “A Dry White Season.”\n\nBut it wasn’t until 1991 that she got to play one of her most memorable roles on screen. Sarandon was cast in one of the most seminal movies of her career — the adventure drama “Thelma & Louise,” which became an instant cult classic.\n\nPlaying Louise\n\nThe 1991 film “Thelma & Louise” is a brilliant film about two girlfriends who embark on the trip of their lives. Directed by Ridley Scott, the character of Louise Sawyer was written by screenwriter Callie Khouri with Susan Sarandon in mind from the start.\n\nLouise is an independent, strong woman who works as a waitress and wants to get away from her routine life for a while. She and her friend Thelma, played by Geena Davis, face all kinds of dangers on their adventure, ultimately fleeing all the way to Mexico. Sarandon earned a Best Actress nomination for her role.\n\nA Strange Hitchhiker\n\nNo, Susan Sarandon doesn't need a ride to the airport – this is her dressed in a super-oversized leather overcoat during the premiere party for “Fellow Traveler” in New York City. It makes sense if she's dressed like that. In 1990, when this picture was taken, it was still a year out from “Thelma & Louise,” but Sarandon had already been making waves in “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.”\n\nShe was nominated for an Oscar in 1990, but it certainly wasn't for “Fellow Traveler.” It also kind of looks like she's curling her right hand into a fist below her waist so she can punch us.\n\nSarandon’s Next Oscar Nomination\n\nLouise's role was most definitely not the last one to get the talented Susan an Academy Award nomination. The actress was climbing her way to stardom when she got cast in another George Miller drama, “Lorenzo’s Oil,” in 1992. Based on the true story of the Odone family’s struggle to save their son from a rare disease, the film was a big critical success.\n\nSarandon plays Michaela Odone, the mother of Lorenzo, a child with ALD disease. Alongside Nick Nolte, who plays her husband, the actress delivers a tear-jerking performance that earned her yet another Best Actress Academy Award nomination.\n\nBanned from the Oscars\n\nIt has always been well-known that Susan Sarandon is a passionate fighter for the things and causes that she believes in, and in 1993, she got punished for it. She and her partner, Tim Robbins, were presenting at the Academy Awards and, unexpectedly, decided to speak up about a political issue that they felt strongly about.\n\nIn this case, they used the chance to protest the U.S. government’s creation of an internment camp for 250 HIV-positive Haitian refugees. The Academy was so outraged that they banned the stars from attending any future events. However, the ban was lifted soon after.\n\nA Very Big Paycheck\n\nThe next time Susan Sarandon attended the Academy Awards was not long after that explosive event with Robbins. This time, it was for a nomination for Best Actress for her role in 1994’s “The Client.” The film was a huge commercial and critical success. Sarandon held her own by portraying the character of Regina “Reggie” Love, a lawyer and recovering alcoholic.\n\nThanks to its whopping success, Sarandon got a hefty $5 million paycheck for her role in “The Client.” At the time, it was an incredible amount of money, which gave Sarandon the title of one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.\n\nLittle Women\n\nWhile she does have a knack for dark and quirky projects, Sarandon has quite a diverse background, covering multiple genres. Heartfelt dramas are obviously included. The 1994 film “Little Women,” based on the beloved novel by Louisa May Alcott, is one movie audiences aren’t likely to ever forget.\n\nIt was a critical and commercial success, featuring some of Hollywood’s best actresses, including Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and the fabulous Susan Sarandon. Sarandon played Mrs. March, the matriarch of the March girls, and she performed beautifully, making us feel every emotion possible during those two hours in the theater.\n\nSarandon’s First Oscar\n\nAfter several nominations, Sarandon finally took home the Oscar for Best Actress in 1996 for her performance in the 1995 film, “Dead Man Walking.” The film, directed by her then-partner Tim Robbins, features Sean Penn and Sarandon in a gripping crime drama.\n\nSarandon plays Sister Helen Prejean, a nun who constantly visits a convicted prisoner in the hopes of serving as a spiritual adviser. The film was a critical and commercial success, with jaw-dropping performances by Sarandon and Penn alike. Funnily enough, when the real nun Helen Prejean heard that Sarandon would be playing her in a film, she shouted, “Thank God! It’s Louise!”.\n\nA Short Stint in Animation\n\nAfter her triumph in “Dead Man Walking,” Susan Sarandon went on to do her first voice-over gig in an animation film. Sarandon did the voice of the beloved spider character in “James and the Giant Peach.” It was the first time she had ever dabbled in dubbing.\n\nEven though it didn’t fare well at the box office, the film, produced by Tim Burton, was loved by critics and audiences. It also gave Sarandon a new project to add to her ever-successful acting career. Sarandon then went back to regular film and starred in “Twilight,” a crime drama alongside Paul Newman and Gene Hackman.\n\nThe ‘Stepmom’ Gossip\n\nChris Columbus, the esteemed director of the classics \"Home Alone\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" wanted Sarandon to be one of his stars, and so she was cast to play the nasty ex-wife of Ed Harris, who begins dating young and beautiful Julia Roberts.\n\nThe film was a tear-jerking drama that was generally well-received, but the juicy gossip came after. It turns out there were rumors about Sarandon and Roberts hating each other and fighting on set. It turns out that this was a P.R. stunt created by a staff member. “We actually loved working with each other and became great friends,” said Sarandon.\n\nA Project Close to Her Heart\n\nIn another film directed by her then-partner Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon starred in the artsy political drama, “Cradle Will Rock.” It is not exactly one of the most famous projects that Sarandon has participated in, but it is part of her professional record nonetheless. The film is a strong rendition of 1930’s politics, culture, and the controversial art scene in the U.S.\n\nSarandon starred alongside other film greats, like Joan Cusack, Bill Murray, Hank Azaria, Vanessa Redgrave, Jack Black, and others. Even though it was a commercial flop, audiences and critics gave it a big thumbs up. It might be worth a try on your next movie night.\n\nSarandon Becomes a Goodwill Ambassador\n\nEven if you didn't know about it before reading this article, by now, you probably know how involved Sarandon is in causes close to her heart. In 1999, Susan Sarandon was named UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador thanks to her years of support for humanitarian causes. She is a frequent donor to progressive organizations, social justice groups, and female causes across the globe.\n\nSarandon has actively worked in third-world countries to promote social, economic, and environmental justice. Most notably, she’s financially helped war victims in El Salvador and Nicaragua, she’s been a fervent supporter of women’s reproductive rights, been a supporter of AIDS activism, and actively worked with homeless populations and the mentally ill.\n\nPlaying Natalie Portman’s Mom\n\nIn 1999, Susan Sarandon was offered the part of Adele August in the beloved comedy-drama, “Anywhere But Here .” Adele is the overbearing mother of teenager Ann, played by Natalie Portman. Feeling asphyxiated by small-town life, Adele decides to take Ann to California so she can become an actress, but what ensues is a life-changing adventure.\n\nEven though Portman's acting career was just getting started, Sarandon had her eyes on the young talent and wanted to collaborate. In fact, it turns out that Sarandon told movie producers she wouldn’t take the role if they didn’t cast Natalie Portman as her daughter.\n\nA Major Victory for Susan\n\nSusan Sarandon has been a passionate activist and fighter for her beliefs since she was young. Even when it got her arrested or banned from the Academy Awards, that much we know. But here is another tidbit you may not have known about this side of Susan.\n\nIn 2000, her passion for human rights led to a major victory, not only for her but for many others as well. Sarandon launched a campaign against T.V. show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who had openly expressed her racist and homophobic views for years. Thanks to a year of strong protests and campaigning, the network finally took the show off the air for good.\n\nTime for Television\n\nThe multi-faceted Hollywood actress decided to try out T.V. and appeared in a number of guest roles in famous shows. She was on “Malcolm in the Middle,” “Chapelle’s Show,” “30 Rock”, “Mike & Molly,” “Mad T.V.,” and “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nShe even made a cameo on “Friends,” where she played one of Joey's costars from \"Days of Our Lives\" — a little nod to her start as a soap actress. Perhaps. Sarandon also continued doing voice-over acting, voicing characters in the “Rugrats” movie and the animated film, “Cats & Dogs.” Later, in 2002, Sarandon went back to the big screen.\n\nThe Famous Kiss With Matt LeBlanc\n\nEveryone remembers Susan Sarandon’s 2001 guest role in the hit series “Friends.” In the episode titled “The One with Joey’s New Brain,” audiences were delighted to see Sarandon appear on screen as the reputed soap opera star Cecilia Monroe. The thing is, Monroe was about to get kicked off the show, and Joey was meant to replace her.\n\nJoey, played by Matt LeBlanc, falls for Cecilia and ends up giving her a very passionate kiss. In fact, during the episode, there is more than just a kiss happening between them. Apparently, Matt was very nervous about that kiss, especially since Sarandon’s partner, Tim Robbins, was sitting in the audience.\n\nThe Mother Role\n\nThe year 2002 saw Susan Sarandon play two very different but strong mother roles. She was cast as the independent but distant Mimi, mother of Igby, in “Igby Goes Down.” She also played Jojo Floss, the heartbroken mother in “Moonlight Mile,” alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Dustin Hoffman.\n\nBut let’s not forget her role in the fun comedy “The Banger Sisters,” where she plays an ex-rock musician turned conservative alongside band member and friend Goldie Hawn. Basically, it doesn't matter what kind of mother you have; there is a good chance that Susan Sarandon has had her rendition of her at some point.\n\nShall We Dance?\n\nAfter a few movies and some T.V. show appearances, Sarandon starred in her next big role as Beverly Clark, the wife of Richard Gere in “Shall We Dance?”. The film was a commercial success, making more than double its budget at the box office. Sarandon says it’s a role close to her heart since it portrays real life in so many ways.\n\nIn the film, Sarandon suspects her husband is having an affair, but really, he’s just taken up dancing lessons with Paulina, played by Jennifer Lopez. The sole purpose of those dance classes? To be able to dance with his beloved wife. And no, it absolutely can't get any cuter.\n\nBreaking the Routine\n\nSarandon says playing Beverly Clark in “Shall We Dance?” is one of her favorite roles ever. Why? Well, because, aside from working with co-star and friend Richard Gere (who is probably the dream partner for many actresses out there), the movie perfectly illustrates what happens in so many marriages and so many long-term relationships.\n\n“People need to break from the routine and are afraid to be honest with their partners,” said Sarandon in an interview, and further states that, ultimately, communication and trying new things is the way to move forward. Just like Richar Gere's character did in the movie.\n\nAge Is Just a Number\n\nSusan Sarandon proved that women could be attractive at any age, something that is especially commendable in the movie industry, when she starred in the 2004 movie, “Alfie.” Sarandon plays the role of Liz, an older but very attractive woman who seduces a young Jude Law.\n\nNot only is the actress fantastic in her role, but she clearly proves that age is just a number. Sarandon said of the role in later interviews, “If you see yourself as curious and involved and open-ended, as opposed to shriveling up when you hit fifty or sixty or whatever, I think that it kind of fulfills itself really.”\n\nA Step Towards Indie Films\n\nIn 2005, Sarandon had major roles in two indie films that, even though not a commercial or critical success, garnered much love and a following from millions of fans. Sarandon played concerned mother Hollie Baylor in her comedy-drama “Elizabethtown” alongside Orlando Bloom and Kristen Dunst.\n\nLater that year, she performed in John Turturro’s film, “Romance & Cigarettes,” in a completely different role. She played Kitty Kane, a disgruntled 1980s New York wife who learns her husband is having an affair. At this point, it seems that there is no Hollywood stone that she has left unturned, but there is more to come.\n\nWorking With Ralph Fiennes\n\nFor years, Sarandon had wanted to work with brilliant actor Ralph Fiennes, and in 2006, she finally got her wish. They starred in the drama “Bernard and Doris,” based on the true story of Tobacco billionaire heiress Doris Duke and her relationship with her butler Bernard, to whom she left her entire fortune.\n\nSarandon delivers a stellar performance playing the sassy, loud-mouthed Doris, and her contrast with the restrained, quiet Bernard is a perfect combination. This movie, with the stellar talents on display, is recommended for anyone who is looking for something romantic and intelligent to watch on a quiet night.\n\nA Role in the Olympics\n\nWhile Susan used to be a competitive swimmer as a child, it didn't translate to any competitive sport as an adult. However, In 2006, Sarandon was honored to be one of the eight women selected to hold the Olympic flag at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Italy. Her activism and humanitarian attitude turned her into a role model for the U.S.\n\nAlong with Sarandon, the other women holding the flag were former Olympic medalists and famous Italian actress Sophia Loren. The opening ceremony was beautiful, and Sarandon had said in later interviews that it was an experience she would never forget.\n\nSarandon, the Evil Queen\n\n“Enchanted” was a hugely successful musical fantasy film released in 2007 and backed by Walt Disney Pictures. Apart from a stellar cast, it presents a spin on the traditional fairy tale stories that Disney has depicted for so long.\n\nSarandon was cast to play the corrupt, evil Queen Narissa alongside Amy Adams (in her breakthrough role as Princess Giselle), Patrick Dempsey, and James Marsden (who played Prince Edward, Sarandon's son). The film was a great critical success and surpassed its producers’ expectations when it came to the box office. “Enchanted” grossed over $340 million on a budget of $80 million.\n\nWorking With Her Daughter\n\nIt is quite common for some children to follow in their parents' professional footsteps, and boy, howdy, did Susan's eldest daughter know who to follow. Turns out the apple really doesn’t fall far from the tree, as Sarandon’s daughter Eva is also a great actress. In 2008, Susan and her daughter got to work together in the comedy-drama “Middle of Nowhere.”\n\nThe film is about a very irresponsible mother, Rhonda Berry, who prioritizes her younger daughter’s modeling career over her eldest daughter’s college studies. The eldest daughter is played by Sarandon’s daughter Eva, and the onscreen chemistry is simply undeniable.\n\nA Different Kind of Movie\n\nAfter starring in drama, horror, comedy, crime, mystery, and fantasy films, Sarandon decided it was time for something she had not done yet. Apparently, there was still such a thing, and that is how she found herself in a supernatural fiction thriller. In 2008, she was cast to play Grandma Lynn in Peter Jackson’s film, The “Lovely Bones,” based on an Alice Sebold novel.\n\nAlongside Rachel Weisz, Mark Wahlberg, and Saoirse Ronan, Sarandon plays the grandmother of a recently murdered child (Ronan) who watches over her family from heaven. The movie was a commercial success and was well-received by critics and audiences alike.\n\nA Painful Separation\n\n2009 was a landmark year for Susan Sarandon, especially because it was the year when she and her partner of 23 years, Tim Robbins, decided to separate. They had become one of Hollywood’s most beloved and famous couples, actively deciding not to get married to “never take each other for granted,” as Sarandon said.\n\nHowever, after two sons, fighting side by side for countless causes and a wonderful two decades, the couple decided to go their separate ways. Luckily, the decision to call it quits was made on good terms, and the two remain very close friends to this day.\n\nLife Goes On\n\nNot lingering over the ended relationship, Susan Sarandon went straight back to work after her separation, starring in three major movies in 2010. Firstly, she starred as Janet Good in the movie “You Don’t Know Jack,” which is about famous euthanasia advocate Jack Kevorkian, played by Al Pacino.\n\nThen she played Fanny Crill in the crime thriller “Peacock,” alongside Cillian Murphy, who you probably know from productions like the successful T.V. show \"Peaky Blinders\" or the much-talked-about movie \"Oppenheimer\". Lastly, she joined Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, and Josh Brolin in Oliver Stone’s “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” Sarandon plays Jake Moore’s (LaBeouf) mother.\n\nBack to T.V.\n\nNot one to chain herself to one genre or one medium, Susan wasn't specifically set on solely booking jobs on the big screen. It looks like she goes wherever her heart points to, no matter the role or prestige. Sarandon made a big return to television in 2011 and 2012, with appearances in “Saturday Night Live,” “30 Rock”, and “The Big C.”\n\nIn the hilarious “30 Rock”, Sarandon plays Lynn Onkamn, an old flame of Frank Rossitano (played by Judah Friedlander). In the famous Showtime drama “The Big C,” Sarandon plays motivational speaker Joy Kleinman for six episodes alongside the show’s star, Laura Linney.\n\nAn Adventurous Road Trip and a New Love\n\nIn 2010, Susan Sarandon made a road trip through Chile and met Jonathan Bricklin, a film producer and the son of famous businessman Malcolm Bricklin. Sarandon and Bricklin started dating shortly after meeting but kept their relationship under wraps due to their big age gap. Sarandon was 31 years older than Bricklin, but if they didn't seem to mind about it, who are we to judge?\n\nThe couple paid no mind to the press calling Jonathan the actress’s “Boy-toy” and went on to have a loving relationship for six years. Honestly, with the way Sarandon sticks up for what she believes in, we wonder if they maybe could have gone even longer than that.\n\nSarandon Loves Ping-Pong\n\nWith her past as a competitive swimmer and the fact that she actually held the Olympic flag alongside Sophia Loren, we are not surprised to learn that Sarandon is a big sports fan. As it turns out, Sarandon is a big fan of ping-pong and is actually incredibly good at it!\n\nIn fact, she and her then-boyfriend Jonathan Bricklin opened a table tennis club called SPiN, as well as a bar in New York. SPiN became so popular through the years that it eventually turned into a huge company franchise with clubs all over the world. The bars offer Olympic-style ping-pong tables and full-service restaurants with extensive menus.\n\nBack to the Silver Screen\n\nSarandon continued to star in big Hollywood productions throughout the 2010s, including the movies “Arbitrage” with Richard Gere, “Tammy,” with Melissa McCarthy, “Cloud Atlas,” “The Meddler,” “Mothers and Daughters,” “A Bad Moms Christmas,” and countless others.\n\nMost notably, in 2017, Sarandon played famous actress Bette Davis in the F.X. anthology series, “Feud.” Playing opposite Jessica Lange, who was cast as Joan Crawford, Sarandon embodied Davis's fierce spirit flawlessly. In fact, the actress later said that Bette Davis herself had reached out to her back in the 80s and told her she wanted Sarandon to portray her in a film biopic.\n\nA Jack of All Trades\n\nOn top of her phenomenal acting skills in film and television, Susan Sarandon has also done extensive work as a narrator and presenter. Throughout her career, she has helped narrate over 25 documentary films that mostly deal with political and social justice topics — exactly the stuff she believes in.\n\nSarandon has also been the presenter for many episodes of the PBS T.V. series “Independent Lens.” In the early 2000s, she also hosted “Mythos,” a documentary that features lectures by famous mythology professor Joseph Campbell. Most recently, Sarandon joined the Social Impact Advisory Board of the San Diego International Film Festival.\n\nVoice Overs and a Country Music Dynasty\n\nStarting in 2017, Sarandon got heavily into T.V., becoming a regular on the popular series “Ray Donovan.” She also had some fun with voice-overs, doing the voices of Aunt Agatha in the anime T.V. series “Neo Yokio” and no less than three characters in one episode of “Robot Chicken.”\n\nOne of the most recent roles she had on T.V. is that of Dottie Roman in the country music dynasty drama “Monarch,” which is worth watching simply to see Sarandon with a southern accent. She has also become the voice of Dr. Wong in the hit animation series “Rick and Morty.”\n\nNot Afraid of the Future\n\nSusan Sarandon is truly a woman to be admired, not only for her infinite acting talents but also for her personality and attitude. She stands up for what she believes in, is not afraid to speak out, and is not afraid of aging despite the industry she is involved in.\n\nShe’s unapologetic about who she is – “My sexuality is up for grabs. I’m open to anything,” said Sarandon in a recent interview. It seems she’s come to terms with what matters in life and has said that she’s actually looking forward to reaching old age, as “she feels 25 in her heart”, Sarandon jokes.\n\nBeing Upfront\n\nIf Susan Sarandon has something to say, she will go out there and say it without taking into account what other people may think. She is known for her activism and outspokenness on various political and social issues and has decorated more than one headline in recent years.\n\nShe is known for being a dedicated advocate for progressive causes, which include, amongst others, LGBTQ+ rights, global warming, and, most important, women's rights. Sarandon is a Goodwill Ambassador, and she is a recognized supporter of the Robin Hood Foundation, whose main purpose is to solve poverty in New York, an issue the city suffers from tremendously.\n\nEva Amurri\n\nWe must say that we appreciate the mother-daughter relationship, and the lifestyle blogger and actress Eva Amurri has always been close to her mother. Amurri, a career woman and a mom of three, has always credited her mother for teaching her to have confidence and independence from a young age. \"I think the biggest lesson from my mom was just the permission to want a lot for yourself, career-wise, as a woman,” said Amurri in a 2023 interview with PEOPLE magazine.\n\nThe “Thelma & Louise” star has been by Eva’s side through every major life event, particularly when it came to helping her with her kids. “I’ll be there when she melts down and be someone to take the baby in the middle of the night,” said Sarandon after Eva gave birth to her first child. Now that’s a good mom!\n\nFollowing Her Mother's Footsteps\n\nEva is for sure following her mother's footsteps. Besides being a very talented actress in her own right, she also took advantage of her position and tried to influence and change this world in any way she could. She founded the lifestyle blog \"Happily Eva After,\" where she shares insights on motherhood, wellness, fashion, and more.\n\nShe is an advocate for maternal health and wellness and believes that the ones around us, those we spend most of our time with, are the ones we learn from the most. You don't always need heavy textbooks or sophisticated teachers. Your family, friends, and children tend to teach you so much more than anyone else.\n\nNo Such Thing as Too Old\n\nSusan Sarandon let everyone know that 70 was the new 20 when she wore multiple eye-catching looks on the red carpet in 2016. At the SAG awards that year, Sarandon wore a chic white suit but swapped out a top for a black bra.\n\nIt was a controversial outfit, sparking a Twitter debate between the actress and Piers Morgan, but nothing compared to what Sarandon wore throughout the year. Sarandon has starred in many movies and showed off her talent and the varied characters she has played over the years. She is a huge name in a huge industry, and neither of them seems to be going anywhere.\n\nAre You Sigourney Weaver?\n\nKaty Perry and Zooey Deschanel. Jessica Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard. Javier Bardem and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The entertainment industry has lots of celebrity doppelgangers and fans frequently mistake Susan Sarandon for another Hollywood veteran, Sigourney Weaver — and vice versa. Sarandon joked that she had stopped correcting people and had decided to take credit for some of Weavers' work, such as the popular sci-fi franchise \"Alien\" (1986).\n\nWeaver had similar plans and has often signed autographs as Sarandon — great minds and all that! The two actresses have particularly similar hair and face shape. Beyond that, we honestly don’t see it, even if fans routinely confuse one for the other.\n\nNever Looked Younger\n\nSusan Sarandon is older than you may think. “People” magazine asked her how in the heck she looked so great, and she shared some of her tips. Pick up a pen and a notepad, folks: she said, don’t smoke, laugh a lot, exercise normally, eat well, and stay out of the sun if you want to age gracefully.\n\nThen she divulged this, “Having an amazing makeup hair team, that’s really the secret.” Boxing is a newer fitness sport for her. She also said that living in New York is good because she walks or rides her bike everywhere around the city.\n\nThe Time She Snapped Back\n\nSusan Sarandon was not really having it when the George W. Bush and Ellen DeGeneres chill-out happened. The A-lister had been around long enough to remember Iraq I and II, so she went to Twitter to make her opinions known to anyone on the platform.\n\nCaptioning an image of Ellen touting a supportive fan’s tweet, Sarandon argued that the talk show host missed the point completely. “DeGeneres framed the issue as simply a matter of her hanging out with someone with different opinions, not a man repeatedly accused of being a war criminal.” Sarandon may be an actress but she sure as heck doesn't shy away from politics.\n\nWorks Hard for Her Money\n\nSusan Sarandon works hard for her money, and when you look at what she is worth today, you realize that hard work pays off. As of 2022, Susan Sarandon's net worth was estimated at around $60 million. Now, we know this is not the hundred thousand of millions of other big names in the industry, but $60 million can take you a long way.\n\nSarandon's long career has borne fruit. Besides the loose money in the bank, she is a proud owner of several estates. She is grateful and gives back to society by being involved in various entrepreneurial and philanthropic endeavors.\n\nInside Susan Sarandon's NYC Home\n\nRecently, Sarandon listed her Chelsea Apartment. And the price? No less than $7.9 million. The beautiful property stretches over 6,000 square feet, and it was a loft covered with an enormous living space. This property had everything you could wish for, from a private elevator and a stunning corner library to a wood-burning fireplace and an iconic view of the New York skyline, which are priceless.\n\nThe Empire State Building can be seen from the master bedrooms, which lead to a private balcony. Sarandon had said that parting from beautiful things is a hard thing to do, but we must never forget that these things are just things."
