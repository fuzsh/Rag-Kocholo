        "text": "Friday, November 17 was my first day of playing Christmas music since Lori and I moved to 949 HOM from Q97.9. I knew this day was coming when we made the move, but I didn't realize just how many people were anticipating it.\n\nFor the past 20 years, 94.9 HOM has had a tradition of playing all Christmas music as the holiday approaches. There are two camps of people when it comes to the flip. Those who say it's too early and those who say you can't play it soon enough. There's never really any middle ground. What I can say however is the people who want us to make the flip, will let us know daily.\n\nSince the day after Halloween, our inboxes have been jam-packed with messages asking us when we were going to start Christmas music. We didn't even know the date until a few weeks ago.\n\nBut at 7:10 Friday morning, \"Karma Chameleon\" by Boy George slowly faded out to a radio dial tuning to clips of Christmas songs and scenes from Christmas movies while a crowd counted down from 10. That's when we kicked the Christmas music off with \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" by Mariah Carey.\n\nJust how anxious were people for Christmas music on HOM?\n\nCourtney Poland who goes by \"soupermommy\" on Tik Tok began checking her radio on November 1, every day to see if we had flipped the switch. She was met with a lot of disappointment over the 9 days she posted to TikTok, out of the 17 that she waited for the flip.\n\nBut finally, her wait paid off."
