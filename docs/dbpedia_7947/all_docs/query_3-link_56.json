        "text": "(1946-)\n\nWho Is Susan Sarandon?\n\nSusan Sarandon is an American film actress who began acting after college. In 1975, she landed a role in the cult classic film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. She won an Academy Award for her performance in Dead Man Walking (1995) and received Oscar nominations for her roles in Atlantic City (1980), Thelma and Louise (1991), Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and The Client (1994). Her other notable films include The Witches of Eastwick (1987) and Bull Durham (1988).\n\nEarly Life and Career\n\nSarandon was born on October 4, 1946, in New York City. She graduated from the Catholic University of America in 1968 with a B.A. in drama and not long after graduating she made her film debut in Joe (1970). After a few other film roles, Sarandon landed a part in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), a campy musical that developed a cult following in subsequent years.\n\nMovies and Career Highlights\n\nSarandon earned her first Academy Award nomination for Atlantic City (1980) starring opposite screen legend Burt Lancaster. However, her career really picked up steam later that decade with appearances in The Witches of Eastwick (1987) and Bull Durham (1988). In The Witches of Eastwick, she played one of three women seduced by the devil (Jack Nicholson) and developed special powers. This lighthearted battle of good vs. evil showed Sarandonâ€™s comedic talents. In Bull Durham, she played Annie Savoy, a smart and sexy baseball groupie who becomes involved with hotshot pitcher Ebby Calvin \"Nuke\" LaLoosh, played by Tim Robbins. Robbins would later become her partner in real life.\n\nSarandon delivered one of her most memorable performances in Thelma and Louise (1991), co-starring with Geena Davis as two friends on a road trip turned wrong. Her portrayal of the tough, protective and somewhat broken Louise brought her another Academy Award nomination. Sarandon was also nominated for Lorenzo's Oil (1992) and The Client (1994). She played a nun in the gritty and powerful drama Dead Man Walking (1995), winning her first Academy Award for her performance.\n\nLater Roles\n\nIn 2009, Sarandon returned to Broadway in a critically acclaimed production of Eugene Ionesco's Exit the King, playing Queen Marguerite to Geoffrey Rush's King Berenger. On the big screen, Sarandon took on a supporting role in The Lovely Bones (2009), a film adaptation of the best-selling novel by Alice Sebold, in addition to roles in various films and TV series, including The Big C (2012), Arbitrage (2012), Cloud Atlas (2012), Tammy (2014) and The Meddler (2015).\n\nIn 2017, Sarandon played screen legend Bette Davis, co-starring with Jessica Lange as Joan Crawford, in the TV series Feud. The television show, developed by Ryan Murphy, focused on the legendary bitter rivalry between the two Hollywood icons. Both actresses were praised for their work on the show, with Sarandon earning Emmy and Golden Globe nominations.\n\nActivism\n\nUnafraid to make her stance known on many issues, Sarandon and Robbins spoke about the plight of Haitian HIV-positive refugees during the 1993 Academy Awards ceremony when they appeared as presenters. In 1999, she became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and she has been active in supporting various political and human rights causes. In 2006, Sarandon was one of the celebrities that joined antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan in a fast against the war in Iraq. She also received the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award in 2006.\n\nIn 2016, Sarandon was an outspoken supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, before casting her vote for Jill Stein of the Green Party. The following year, in an interview with The Guardian, the actress recalled the personal attacks she received for not supporting Hillary Clinton, and doubled down on her assertions that the former secretary of state was \"very, very dangerous.\"\n\nPersonal Life and Children\n\nSarandon was married to actor Chris Sarandon from 1967 to 1979. She has three children: a daughter Eva from a relationship with filmmaker Franco Amurri and two sons, Jack and Miles, with Tim Robbins. She and Robbins split in the summer of 2009, after being together for 23 years.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Susan Sarandon\n\nBirth Year: 1946\n\nBirth date: October 4, 1946\n\nBirth State: New York\n\nBirth City: New York City\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Susan Sarandon is an Academy Award-winning American film actress known for roles in films like 'Bull Durham,' 'Thelma and Louise' and 'Dead Man Walking.'\n\nIndustries\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nMusical\n\nTelevision\n\nDocumentary\n\nDrama\n\nAstrological Sign: Libra\n\nSchools\n\nCatholic University of America\n\nEdison High School\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION\n\nArticle Title: Susan Sarandon Biography\n\nAuthor: Biography.com Editors\n\nWebsite Name: The Biography.com website\n\nUrl: https://www.biography.com/actors/susan-sarandon\n\nAccess Date:\n\nPublisher: A&E; Television Networks\n\nLast Updated: March 30, 2021\n\nOriginal Published Date: April 2, 2014\n\nQUOTES"
