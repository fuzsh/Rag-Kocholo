        "text": "Jerome Alan West (May 28, 1938 â€“ June 12, 2024) was an American basketball executive and former player. He played professionally for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His nicknames included \"the Logo\", in reference to his silhouette being the basis for the NBA logo; \"Mr. Clutch\", for his ability to make a big play in a key situation; \"Mr. Outside\", in reference to his perimeter play with the Los Angeles Lakers and \"Zeke from Cabin Creek\" for the creek near his birthplace of Chelyan, West Virginia. He earned the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player honor despite the loss in the championship. He then embarked on a 14-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers and was the co-captain of the 1960 U.S. Olympic gold medal team, a squad that was inducted as a unit into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. In 2024, he was inducted to the Hall of Fame as a contributor to the sport as an executive and consultant\n\nPatrick Christian White (born February 25, 1986) is an American football offensive assistant for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL), and former West Virginia University quarterback. He was drafted by the Miami Dolphins in the second round (44th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. White was also a baseball outfielder. He was drafted in the fourth round of the 2004 MLB Draft by the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, and in later rounds by the Cincinnati Reds in 2008 and New York Yankees in 2009, but never played for those organizations except in instructional leagues.\n\nDon Knotts, born as Jesse Donald Knotts on July 21, 1924, in Morgantown, West Virginia, emerged as a celebrated figure in the world of entertainment. With humble beginnings as the youngest of four sons in a struggling family, Knotts' rise to fame is a testament to his perseverance and talent. A World War II veteran, he served in the U.S. Army before pursuing his passion for acting, starting his career in the late 1940s with minor roles in radio and television. However, it was his role as the comical yet lovable Barney Fife on The Andy Griffith Show that catapulted him to stardom, earning him five Emmy Awards. Knotts' prowess in comedy extended beyond television, solidifying his reputation in the film industry as well. His memorable performances in movies such as The Incredible Mr. Limpet, The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, and The Shakiest Gun in the West showcased his impeccable comedic timing and skill. Despite often being typecast as a nervous character, Knotts demonstrated versatility in his career, transitioning into dramatic roles in later years. He notably appeared in the critically acclaimed series Matlock, once again sharing the screen with Andy Griffith, and lending his voice to the animated series Scooby-Doo, as the quirky landlord, Mr. Furley. Don Knotts' impact on the entertainment industry extends well beyond his life span, as his comedic genius continues to inspire aspiring artists. He passed away on February 24, 2006, leaving behind a legacy of laughter and fond memories. From the small town in West Virginia to the glitz and glamour of Hollywood, Knotts' journey serves as an inspiration for many. His innate ability to make audiences laugh, paired with his humility and commitment to his craft, made him not just a well-respected actor, but a beloved figure in American popular culture."
