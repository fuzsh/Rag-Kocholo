        "text": "On Saturday, supporters chanted and sang as opposition leader Maria Corina Machado arrived at the rally in Caracas\n\nArticle content\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Thousands of people rallied in the streets of Venezuela’s capital Saturday, waving the national flag and singing the national anthem in support of an opposition candidate they believe won the presidential election by a landslide.\n\nAuthorities have declared President Nicolas Maduro the winner of last Sunday’s election but have yet to produce voting tallies to prove he won. Maduro also urged his backers to attend “the mother of all marches” Saturday in Caracas.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS\n\nEnjoy the latest local, national and international news.\n\nExclusive articles by Conrad Black, Barbara Kay and others.

Ecstatic, they crushed around her as she climbed onto a raised platform on a truck to address the crowd.\n\nMachado, who has been barred by Maduro’s government from running for office for 15 years, had been in hiding since Tuesday, saying her life and freedom are at risk. Masked assailants ransacked the opposition’s headquarters on Friday, taking documents and vandalizing the space.\n\nOn Saturday, she held aloft a Venezuelan flag and promised that the regime that has forced millions of Venezuelans to leave was finally coming to an end.\n\n“We have overcome all the barriers! We have knocked them all down,” Machado said. “Never has the regime been so weak.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGonzalez, who remains in hiding, was not seen at the event, and when the rally ended, Machado was given a non-descript shirt and whisked away on the back of a motorcycle.\n\nCarmen Elena Garcia, a 57-year-old street vendor was at the rally even though she feared a government crackdown.\n\n“They have to respect me and they have to respect all the Venezuelans who voted against this government,” Garcia said. “We will not accept them stealing our votes. They have to respect our votes.”\n\nOn Friday, Maduro alleged during a news conference that members of the opposition were planning an attack in a Caracas neighborhood on Saturday. He said he had ordered the armed forces to guard the neighborhood.\n\nWhile a column of pro-government motorcycle riders, who have served as militia for Maduro in the past, rode near the opposition rally, there were no confrontations. There was only a light police presence.\n\nThe Organization of American States on Saturday called for “reconciliation and justice” in Venezuela, saying “let all Venezuelans who express themselves in the streets find only an echo of peace, a peace that reflects the spirit of democracy.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nMachado and Gonzalez, a 74-year-old former diplomat, said tally sheets they obtained from voting machines in polling centers nationwide show Maduro lost his bid for a third six-year term by a landslide.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis Friday of vote tally sheets released by the opposition coalition indicates that Gonzalez won significantly more votes in the election than the government has claimed, casting serious doubt on the official declaration that Maduro won.\n\nLate Friday, Venezuela’s high court, the Supreme Justice Tribunal, ordered the Maduro-controlled National Electoral Council to hand over the precinct vote count sheets in three days. There have been calls from multiple governments, including Maduro’s close regional allies, for Venezuela’s electoral authorities to release the precinct-level tallies, as it has after previous elections.\n\nThe AP processed almost 24,000 images of tally sheets, representing the results from 79 per cent of voting machines. Each sheet encoded vote counts in QR codes, which the AP programmatically decoded and analyzed, resulting in tabulations of 10.26 million votes.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAccording to the calculations, the Gonzalez received 6.89 million votes, nearly half a million more than the government says Maduro won. The tabulations also show Maduro received 3.13 million votes from the tally sheets released.\n\nBy comparison, the National Electoral Council said Friday that based on 96.87 per cent of tally sheets, Maduro had won 6.4 million votes and Gonzalez had 5.3 million. National Electoral Council President Elvis Amoroso attributed the delay in filing complete results to attacks on the “technological infrastructure.”\n\nThe tally sheets, known in Spanish as “actas,” are lengthy printouts that resemble shopping receipts. They have long been considered the ultimate proof of election results in Venezuela.\n\nThe AP could not independently verify the authenticity of the 24,532 tally sheets provided by the opposition. The AP successfully extracted data from 96 per cent of the provided vote tallies, with the remaining 4 per cent of images too poor to parse.\n\nThe Biden administration has thrown its support firmly behind the opposition. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement Thursday citing “overwhelming evidence that Gonzalez was the victor and discrediting the National Electoral Council’s official results.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGonzalez posted a message on X thanking the U.S. “for recognizing the will of the Venezuelan people.”\n\nMaduro said Friday that the U.S. should stay out of Venezuela’s politics.\n\nVenezuela sits atop the world’s largest proven crude reserves and once boasted Latin America’s most advanced economy, but it entered into a free fall marked by 130,000 per cent hyperinflation and widespread shortages after Maduro took the helm in 2013. More than 7.7 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2014, the largest exodu in Latin America’s recent history.\n\nU.S. oil sanctions have only deepened the misery, and the Biden administration — which had been easing those restrictions — is now likely to ramp them up again unless Maduro agrees to some sort of transition.\n\nThere has been a flurry of diplomatic efforts by Brazil, Colombia and Mexico to convince Maduro to allow an impartial audit of the vote. On Thursday, the governments of the three countries issued a joint statement calling on Venezuela’s electoral authorities “to move forward expeditiously and publicly release” detailed voting data.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOn Friday, Maduro and his campaign manager, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, attempted to discredit the tally sheets posted online by the opposition, arguing that they were missing signatures from the electoral council representative as well as poll workers and party representatives.\n\nThey didn’t acknowledge that soldiers, civilian militia, police and loyalists of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela, blocked some opposition representatives from entering the polls, witnessing the vote, and signing and obtaining copies of tally sheets.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
