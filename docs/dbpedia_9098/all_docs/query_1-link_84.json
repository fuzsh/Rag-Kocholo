It also changes the names of some provinces, in the same way that GEC Update 13 did. In another modification dated 2014-12-18, it fleshes out the identification of provinces with regions by attributing Distrito Nacional to Ozama region.\n\n\"Geopolitical Entities, Names, and Codes, Edition 2\" (GENC), a U.S. standard that's supposed to correspond to ISO 3166-2, was issued on 2014-03-31. It gives codes for the regions, and they differ from the GEC codes.\n\nUpdate 15 to Geopolitical Entities and Codes (GEC, the successor to FIPS 10-4), is dated 2014-03-31. GEC now considers the regions, rather than the provinces, as primary subdivisions.\n\nUpdate 13 to GEC is dated 2013-09-30. It changes three province names. Bahoruco is going back to Baoruco; the accent is removed from El Seíbo; and the name change of Salcedo to Hermanas Mirabal is shown.\n\nFIPS PUB 10-4 Change Notice 13 was issued on 2008-02-04. The Dominican Republic is affected only by a change of spelling from Baoruco to Bahoruco.\n\nThe new provinces of San Jose de Ocoa and Santo Domingo were incorporated into the FIPS standard by FIPS Publication Change Notice No. 10, affecting FIPS PUB 10-4, issued on 2006-03-23. They were incorporated into the ISO standard by the issuance of the second edition of ISO 3166-2, dated 2007-12-15.\n\nWith respect to telephone dialing, the Dominican Republic is in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP), which means that its international dialing code is 1, followed by the area code. The Dominican Republic originally was in area code 809, but in 2005 it was overlaid with area code 829, and in 2010 further overlaid with 849.\n\nUpdate I-1 to ISO 3166-2 was published on 2000-06-21. All of the provinces were originally assigned two-letter codes by the ISO secretariat. Those have been replaced by two-digit codes taken from source [1]. This eliminates an error in ISO 3166-2, where the code EP was used for two provinces. Also, the update changed the spelling of one of the provinces' names from El Seibo to El Seybo. Nonetheless, the spelling \"El Seibo\" is still predominant.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameDOMINICAN REPUBLIC ISO codeDO GEC codeDR LanguageSpanish (es) Time zone-4 CapitalSanto Domingo\n\nThe Dominican Republic shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. The boundary between these two countries has remained fairly stable throughout the 20th century. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about their system of government. The Dominican Republic was dominated by Rafael Trujillo from 1930 to 1961. He and his family attempted to impose their names on several geographical features.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Den Dominikanske Republik\n\nDutch: Dominicaanse Republiek\n\nFinnish: Dominikaaninen tasavalta\n\nFrench: République f dominicaine\n\nGerman: Dominikanische Republik f\n\nIcelandic: Dóminíska lýðveldið\n\nItalian: Repubblica f Dominicana\n\nNorwegian: Den dominikanske republikk (Bokmål), Den dominikanske republikken (Nynorsk)\n\nPortuguese: República f Dominicana\n\nRussian: Доминиканская Республика\n\nSpanish: República f Dominicana\n\nSwedish: Dominikanska republiken\n\nTurkish: Dominik Cumhuriyeti\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nfrom Santo Domingo, the capital, which was named by Columbus in 1496 in honor of his father's patron saint.\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nThe Dominican Republic is divided into 31 provinces and one district.\n\nProvinceHASCISOGECPcRgPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)Capital AzuaDO.AZ02DR017105214,3112,6881,038Azua (de Compostela) BahorucoDO.BR03DR02820697,3131,244480Neiba BarahonaDO.BH04DR038106187,1051,647636(Santa Cruz de) Barahona DajabónDO.DA05DR04630463,9551,004388Dajabón Distrito NacionalDO.NC01DR341010965,0409135Santo Domingo (de Guzmán) DuarteDO.DU06DR063103289,5741,640633San Francisco de Macorís Elías PiñaDO.EP07DR11730763,0291,397539Comendador El SeiboDO.SE08DR28240887,6801,775685(Santa Cruz de) El Seibo EspaillatDO.ES09DR085601231,938825319Moca Hato MayorDO.HM30DR29250985,0171,324511Hato Mayor (del Rey) Hermanas MirabalDO.SC19DR19340392,193430166Salcedo IndependenciaDO.IN10DR09830652,5891,754677Jimaní La AltagraciaDO.AL11DR102308273,2103,0011,159(Salvaleón de) Higüey La RomanaDO.RO12DR122208245,433656253La Romana La VegaDO.VE13DR304102394,2052,274878(Concepción de) La Vega María Trinidad SánchezDO.MT14DR143303140,9251,212468(Trinidad Sánchez) Nagua Monseñor NouelDO.MN28DR314202165,224992383Bonao Monte CristiDO.MC15DR156204109,6071,886728(San Fernando de) Monte Cristi Monte PlataDO.MP29DR329209185,9562,6131,009Monte Plata PedernalesDO.PN16DR16840631,5872,018779Pedernales PeraviaDO.PV17DR359405184,344785303Baní Puerto PlataDO.PP18DR185701321,597819316(San Felipe de) Puerto Plata SamanáDO.SM20DR203203101,494845326(Santa Bárbara de) Samaná Sánchez RamírezDO.SZ24DR214302151,3921,191460Cotuí San CristóbalDO.CR21DR339105569,9301,240479San Cristóbal San José de OcoaDO.JO31DR36930559,544853329San José de Ocoa San JuanDO.JU22DR237207232,3333,3601,297San Juan (de la Maguana) San Pedro de MacorísDO.PM23DR242109290,4581,255484San Pedro de Macorís SantiagoDO.ST25DR255101963,4222,8091,084Santiago (de los Caballeros) Santiago RodríguezDO.SR26DR26640457,4761,152445(San Ignacio de) Sabaneta Santo DomingoDO.SD32DR37107102,374,3701,302503Santo Domingo Este ValverdeDO.VA27DR276104163,030809312Mao 32 divisions9,445,28146,88818,104\n\nProvince: except for Distrito Nacional, which is a district.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes (based on the original ISO 3166-2 codes).\n\nISO: codes from ISO 3166-2, same as ONE province codes.\n\nGEC: codes from GEC.\n\nPc: Beginning of range of postal codes (see below).\n\nRg: ONE region code (see below).\n\nPopulation: 2010-12-01 census.\n\nCapital: When part of the name of a capital is in parentheses, that means that the capital has a short,\n\ninformal name, and a formal name including the parenthetical part. The shorter form is commonly used.\n\nPostal codes:\n\nIn 2005, the Dominican Republic switched from four-digit to five-digit postal codes. In Distrito Nacional (10000-10699) and Santo Domingo (10700-11999), hundreds of codes have been assigned; in the rest of the provinces, the last three digits are always 000. The first digit determines a region, as defined by the Instituto Postal Dominicano. For details, see the table below.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Municipalities of the Dominican Republic page.\n\nThe provinces are subdivided into municipios (municipalities). There were 61 of them in 1935, rising to 97 in 1993, and 161 in 2002, but falling to 155 in 2007. The municipalities are further subdivided into 380 distritos (districts), which are classified as either distritos cabeceras or distritos municipales. The Oficina Nacional de Estadística (ONE) has created a hierarchical system of codes in the format \"nn nn nn nn nn nnn nn\", where each \"n\" is a digit. The first two digits represent the region, the first four represent the province, the first six represent a municipality, the first eight a municipal district, the first ten a sección, the first thirteen a barrio or paraje, and the full set a sub-barrio. Trailing digits are all 0's for the higher-level divisions. See source [10] for details.\n\nThe 2010 census report divides the country into ten regions. The postal regions are a bit different. In the table below, the Postal column gives the names of the postal regions and the first digit of the corresponding postal codes. The correspondence isn't exact, however. Azua is in Valdesia census region but has a postal code for El Valle, and Monte Plata is in Higuamo census region but has a postal code for Valdesia.\n\nThe regions have apparently changed over the years. The 2002 census report has regions that match the postal regions more exactly. It calls them regiones de desarrollo (development regions). The names are the same as those of the postal regions, except that it uses \"Nordeste\" instead of \"Norte\". Source [6] has a still earlier version of the system, dated 1990. In it, the Cibaos are partitioned differently, Higuamo is split between Valdesia and Yuma, and Ozama is included in Valdesia.\n\nRegion ONE ISO GEC MRPostalPopulationCapital Cibao Nordeste0333DR38N3 Norte624,186San Francisco de Macorís Cibao Noroeste0434DR39N6 Noroeste394,068Mao Cibao Norte 0135DR40N5 Norcentral1,516,957Santiago Cibao Sur 0236DR41N4 Cibao Central710,821La Vega El Valle 0737DR42O7 El Valle295,362San Juan de la Maguana Enriquillo 0638DR43O8 Enriquillo368,594Barahona Higuamo 0939DR44E2 Este561,431San Pedro de Macorís Ozama 1040DR45E1 Distrito Nacional3,339,410Santo Domingo Este Valdesia 0541DR46O9 Valdesia1,028,129San Cristóbal Yuma 0842DR47E2 Este606,323La Romana\n\nONE: Region code from Oficina Nacional de Estadística.\n\nISO: codes from ISO 3166-2.\n\nGEC: Geopolitical Entities and Codes.\n\nMR: Macroregion code (Norte, surOeste, surEste).\n\nPostal: Postal region.\n\nPopulation: 2010-12-01 census.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nIndependencia contains most of Lago Enriquilla, including all of Isla Cabritos.\n\nLa Altagracia includes Isla Saona.\n\nLa Romana includes Isla Catalina.\n\nPedernales includes Isla Beata and Cayo los Frailes.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Dominican Republic lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions.
