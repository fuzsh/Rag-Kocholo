        "text": "Discover the interesting city of Cotuí, the mining capital of Sánchez Ramírez region, in the Dominican Republic\n\nCotuí\n\n© Marvin del Cid\n\nLocated at the foot of the impressive Yamasá mountain range, the city of Cotuí takes its name from the ancient Cotuy or Cotoy, the Taíno name for the region that surrounds the village, currently known as Pueblo Viejo, in the vicinities of Maimón.\n\nTourism in Cotuí\n\n© Marvin del Cid\n\nThis town has less than 80,000 inhabitants and was founded in 1505 by Rodrigo Mejía de Trujillo, during Nicolás de Ovando’s administration. The Hieronymite Fathers transformed the city into a mining centre in the second decade of the 16th century and renamed it as La Mejorada de Cotuí, also known as Los Mineros. In 1533, Cotuí got the category of “villa” and was renamed as La Mejorada Villa de Coutí. After the strong earthquake that took place in 1562, the city was moved to its current location, to the north of the Yamasá mountain range. This place has lots of interesting places to visit: the Immaculate Conception church, the Hatillo dam, the Taíno caves and Sierra Prieta.\n\nThe Immaculate Conception church is one of these interesting tourist attractions due to its architectural beauty and because it is the oldest building of Cotuí, besides, it is a place that had a great importance in the town’s developing. The Presa Hatillo dam, located in Hatillo town, is an impressive construction finished in 1984 that helps the local fishermen to gain their incomes. The Guácaras Táino caves are some astonishing caverns located in the province of Sánchez Ramírez. Even though there exist several caverns in the Dominican Republic, just a few have the archaeological and historic importance these “guácaras” have. Sierra Prieta is an incredible elevation that rises up above 300 metres high and that is visited by thousands of tourists attracted by the incredible landscapes and its ancient wall full of petroglyphs that date from the pre-Hispanic era.\n\nCarte Interactive:"
