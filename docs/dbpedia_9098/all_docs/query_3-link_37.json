        "text": "The National Meteorological Office (ONAMET) reported that due to a trough located over Haiti and a frontal system that continues almost stationary over the eastern portion of Cuba, scattered clouds to medium cloudiness and occasional showers are expected during the daytime hours over provinces such as Samaná, María Trinidad Sánchez, Sánchez Ramírez, San Cristóbal, Peravia, and Barahona.\n\nONAMET indicated that in the afternoon hours, there will be other cloud increases stimulated by the evening warming that will cause heavy downpours in isolated points, thundershowers, and possible wind gusts, especially in towns in the southwest, Central Cordillera and the border area, such as Barahona, Bahoruco, Independencia, Elías Piña, Azua, San Juan, San José de Ocoa, among other places. These precipitations are expected to decrease at the beginning of the night, giving way to a sky with scattered clouds and isolated showers towards coastal areas in the Atlantic.\n\nTomorrow, Monday, the trough will strengthen and increase the moisture content in our air mass, so we will continue under quite favorable conditions for precipitation to continue over our nation. Therefore, cloud increases will occur from the morning hours, accompanied by scattered showers and thundershowers to locations in La Altagracia, Hato Mayor, El Seibo, San Pedro de Macoris, Monte Plata, Samana, Maria Trinidad Sanchez, among other areas.\n\nDuring the afternoon, these precipitations will intensify and become more frequent, also spreading to other towns in Sanchez Ramirez, Duarte, La Vega, Monseñor Nouel, San Cristobal, San Jose de Ocoa, Santiago, Espaillat, Puerto Plata, Santiago Rodriguez, Valverde, Dajabon, Elias Piña and Independencia.\n\nThe report stated, “These precipitations will decrease at the beginning of the night, but without disappearing completely, we will continue to observe some showers and isolated thundershowers in the Central Cordillera, Cibao Valley, and the northeast of the country.”"
