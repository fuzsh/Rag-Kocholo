        "text": "Wilson’s emergence as a leading tobacco market town drew hundreds of African-American migrants in the decades after the 1890s. Many left family behind in their home counties, perhaps never to be seen again. Others maintained ties the best way they could.\n\nSarah Henderson Jacobs Silver and her husband Jesse A. Jacobs Jr. left Dudley, in southern Wayne County, North Carolina, around 1905. They came to Wilson presumably for better opportunities off the farm. Each remained firmly linked, however, to parents and children and siblings back in Wayne County as well as those who had joined the Great Migration north. This post is the eleventh in a series of excerpts and adaptations of interviews with my grandmother Hattie Henderson Ricks (1910-2001), Jesse and Sarah’s adopted daughter (and Sarah’s great-niece), revealing the ways her Wilson family stayed connected to their far-flung kin. (Or didn’t.)\n\nMinnie Lee Simmons Budd was Sarah Henderson Jacobs’ niece, the daughter of her sister Ann Elizabeth Henderson Simmons. Minnie, a dressmaker, and her husband Jesse M. Budd married in 1904 and migrated to Philadelphia around 1905. They returned to Wayne County for several years, then settled permanently in Philadelphia in the 1920s. Both their sons died young, and Minnie asked to adopt my grandmother, but Mama Sarah would not split her and sister Mamie Henderson Holt. (Minnie later reared several of her brother Daniel Simmons’ children after their mother died.) In the late 1950s, my grandmother migrated to Philadelphia, and she and Cousin Minnie were regular visitors until Minnie’s death in 1960.\n\n——\n\n“Cousin Minnie she had a piano – that’s a piano there, and when you come in her front door on the right hand side, that room where it set, that was her living room. This was their house in Mount Olive. And when I went down there to stay with her two weeks, and she was practicing and playing the piano, she wanted to learn how to play the piano. Well, I guess she had already learnt. But the house was nice, nobody but her and Uncle Jesse. She wanted to adopt me. I used to go down there and stay with her and Cousin Jesse. And Cousin Cousin Annie Cox and Uncle Hardy Cox was living at that time, and I used to go down there. I stayed with her when Cousin Jesse, her husband, come up to bring tobacco to sell. They used to bring it to Wilson, and I went with them back on the car. They had a truck one time, and then they had the car. And they’d just come up and visit. Mama was living then.”\n\nInterview of Hattie H. Ricks by Lisa Y. Henderson adapted and edited for clarity. Copyright 1994, 1996. All rights reserved. Photo in collection of Lisa Y.

Sons Roscoe Gaston and Dewey Gaston — barbers like their father, grandfather, and brothers — were lifelong Wilson County residents. So was John Gaston, the only son who followed a different trade. As early as 1916, daughter Nina Gaston Latham Vick was in Washington, D.C., where she was eventually joined by her siblings Ada Pearl Gaston, Augustus Gaston, and Boisey Gaston. Georgia Gaston Pittman settled in Enfield, North Carolina. Son Mancie Gaston moved to the West Coast around 1930, landing in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Reno, Nevada, before settling in Seattle, Washington.
