        "text": "The Lieutenant Governor (Manx: Fo-chiannoort) is the representative on the Isle of Man of the Lord of Mann (currently Queen Elizabeth II). He/she has the power to grant Royal Assent and is styled His Excellency. In recent times the Governor has either been a retired diplomat or senior military officer. No Manx-born person has ever been appointed Lieutenant Governor, although Manx-born First Deemsters (ex officio Deputy Governors) have taken on the role during the transition of power between Governors, and during periods when the Lieutenant Governor is off-Island.\n\nThe official residence of the Governor is Government House, Governor's Road, Onchan.\n\nPreviously the Lieutenant Governor wielded all judicial, fiscal and executive power and circa 1900 had more power over his realms than any other Commonwealth leader. However, he lost his role as Head of the Judiciary in 1921,[1] as Head of Government in 1961,[2] as President of the Legislative Council in 1980 and finally as President of Tynwald in 1990.[1] Today the role of Lieutenant Governor is essentially ceremonial, although certain powers under Isle of Man legislation do still fall to the Governor or Governor-in-Council (a decision on the advice, and with the approval of, the Council of Ministers).\n\nContents\n\n1 Proposed change to title\n\n2 Appointment\n\n3 List of Lieutenant Governors\n\n4 References\n\n5 See also\n\nProposed change to title\n\nIn October 2005 Tynwald sought to change the title of the Lieutenant Governor to Crown Commissioner.[3] This proposal was sent to the British Department of Constitutional Affairs for submission to the Lord of Mann Elizabeth II for approval. However, in April 2006, after much public disapproval, Tynwald rejected their own proposal and withdrew their request for Royal Assent. Thus the Lieutenant Governor will remain as currently titled.\n\nAppointment\n\nLieutenant Governors have been appointed by the Crown on the advice of a UK Government-led panel until 2010. In July 2010 the Government of the Isle of Man announced[4] that the next Lieutenant Governor would be appointed on advice of an entirely local panel, comprising the Chief Minister, President of Tynwald and the First Deemster. The new procedure was used for the first time a few months later to choose Sir Paul Haddack's successor.\n\nOn 16 November 2010 the Isle of Man Government announced the appointment[5] by the Crown of former UK diplomat Adam Wood as the next Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man. His term is scheduled to start on 4 April 2011. He was officially sworn into office on 7 April 2011 at Castle Rushen in Castletown.[6]\n\nList of Lieutenant Governors\n\nLieutenant Governors have been as follows:[7]\n\nHenry Hope (1773–1775)\n\nRichard Dawson (1775–1790)\n\nAlexander Shaw (1790–1804)\n\nLord Henry Murray (1804–1805)\n\nCornelius Smelt (1805–1832)\n\nMajor General The Honourable John Ready (1832–1845)\n\nThe Honourable Charles Hope (1845–1860)\n\nMark Hildesley Quayle (1860) acting\n\nFrancis Pigott Stainsby Conant (1860–1863)\n\nMark Hildesley Quayle (1863) acting\n\nSir Henry Brougham Loch, Baron Loch GCB, GCMG (1863–1882)\n\nSir Spencer Walpole KCB (1882–1893)\n\nSir Joseph West Ridgeway GCB, GCMG, KCSI (1893–1895)\n\nJohn Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker (1895–1902)\n\nGeorge Fitzroy Henry Somerset, 3rd Baron Raglan, GBE, CB (1902–1918)\n\nMajor-General Sir William Fry, KCVO, CB (1918–1925)\n\nSir Claude Hill, KCSI, CIE (1925–1932)\n\nSir Montagu Sherard Dawes Butler, KCSI, CB, CIE, CVO, CBE (1932–1937)\n\nVice Admiral William Spencer Leveson-Gower, 4th Earl Granville, KG, GCVO, CB, DSO (1937–1945)\n\nAir Vice Marshal Sir Geoffrey Rhodes Bromet, KBE, CB, DSO (1945–1952)\n\nSir Ambrose Dundas Flux Dundas, KCIE, CSI (1952–1959)\n\nSir Ronald Herbert Garvey, KCMG, KCVO, MBE (1959–1966)\n\nSir Peter Hyla Gawne Stallard, KCMG, CVO, MBE (1966–1974)\n\nSir John Warburton Paul, GCMG, OBE, MC (1974–1980)\n\nRear Admiral Sir Nigel Cecil, KBE, CB (1980–1985)\n\nMajor General Sir Laurence New, Kt, CB, CBE (1985–1990)\n\nAir Marshal Sir Laurence Jones, KCB, AFC (1990–1995)\n\nSir Timothy Daunt, KCMG (1995–2000)\n\nAir Marshal Ian David Macfadyen, CB, OBE (2000–2005)\n\nDeemster Michael Kerruish QC (2005) acting\n\nVice Admiral Sir Paul Kenneth Haddacks, KCB (2005–2011)\n\nAdam Wood (2011–present)\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n\nGovernors of the Isle of Man\n\nKing of Mann\n\nLord of Mann"
