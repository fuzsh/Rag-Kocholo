        "text": "high school\n\nElm City high school burns down.\n\nWilson Daily Times, 5 March 1940.\n\nElm City’s African-American school building burned to the ground in March 1940, likely as a result of sparks igniting wooden shingles.\n\nCommunity calls for a Normal and Industrial School.\n\nWilmington Morning Star, 30 October 1886.\n\nWilson County’s calls for a high school for African-American children went unanswered for nearly 40 more years.\n\nHistory award winner!\n\nOver the weekend, I picked up from Levolyre Farmer Pitt a box of newspaper clippings that her mother Savannah Powell Farmer had saved in the 1970s and ’80s, and —\n\nWilson Daily Times, 23 February 1982.\n\nLook at that young historian!\n\nAs a friend remarked, “The village love is priceless!” Much more to come from that treasure trove!\n\nAnother Darden High School.\n\nWilson’s African-American high school was renamed for Charles H. Darden in 1938. Thirteen years later, Opelika, Alabama’s new high school for Black students was named for Darden’s first-born son, Dr. John W. Darden.\n\nBoth Darden High Schools graduated their last classes in 1970. Their buildings, however, remain in use. The newer section of Wilson’s Darden houses part of Samuel H. Vick Elementary. Opelika’s Darden is now home to Lee County Head Start Darden Center.\n\nArchitectural drawing posted at “First Black Doctor in Opelika, AL,” Valle Vision News blog, 22 February 2018.\n\nThe Colored High School on display.\n\nThis photograph of Wilson Colored High School, later known as Darden High, was displayed in Philadelphia’s Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition of 1926. It was one of several dozen featured in an exhibit staged by the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, Division of Negro Education. The caption: Cost of Building $65,000.00 — Total Value Colored School Property $96,250.00 — Total Population of the City 14,000 — Total Colored Population of City 6,650.\n\nFrom Sesquicentennial International Exposition Photographs, Division of Negro Education, Department of Public Instruction, North Carolina State Archives.\n\nThe remains of Williamson High School.\n\nThe six-room Williamson High School, the third high school for African-American children in Wilson County, opened in 1941 near Lucama in Springhill township. Long-closed, its roof and cinderblock exterior remain intact, but its interior is a moldering shambles.\n\nPhotos by Lisa Y. Henderson, September 2017.\n\nClass of ’28.\n\nIn 1928, Wilson Colored High School was led by principal William H.A. Howard and teachers F. Meredith (math), J.E. Amos (home economics), J.F. Anderson (science), C.F. Hunt (English), and B.M. Davis (history and French).\n\nJennie Moring Parker Kerbo, prophet (1909-2006, daughter of Charles and Maggie Hedgepeth Parker)\n\nHerman Bess, valedictorian (possibly, son of William and Ada Best)\n\nAda Elizabeth Harris Reid Sharpe, treasurer (1908-2010, daughter of Leander and Lucy Brooks Harris)\n\nEsther Lue Purdie, president (1907-??, daughter of Street P. and Lenora Bethea Purdie)\n\nWalter Jefferson Giles, vice president (1909-2001, son of George W. and Lucettie Sutton Giles)\n\nVivian Elizabeth Peacock Smith, secretary (1909-1999, daughter of Levi H. and Hannah Pyatt Peacock)\n\nOdelle Whitehead Barnes, salutatorian (1912-2011, daughter of J. Henry and Victoria Ennis Whitehead)\n\nMattie Smith, poet\n\nHenderson Jesse Cooke, orator (1910-1971, son of Jerry and Clara Godette Cooke)\n\nCatherine W. Whitehead Bynum, giftarian (1910-1999, daughter of J. Henry and Victoria Ennis Whitehead)\n\nMaggie M. Ricks, alphabet (1909-??, probably, daughter of Ed and Nannie Gaston Ricks)\n\nBeatrice Taylor Barnes, pianist (1912-1995, daughter of Russell B. and Viola Gaither Taylor)\n\nMary Street, historian\n\nCora Miller Washington Artis, class soloist (1909-??, daughter of George W. and Cora Miller Washington)\n\nRuby Speight, critic\n\nIsaac Artis\n\nSarah Virginia Thomas Bryant (1909-1992, daughter of Charles and Sarah Best Thomas)\n\nPearl Foreman\n\nCora Bell Exum Lane, class will (1908-1984, daughter of Frank and Mamie Johnson Exum)\n\nClara Battle (1908-??, daughter of Joseph and Gertrude Battle)\n\nMartha Bedford Savage Lucas (1907-1965, daughter of Frank and Serena Woodard Savage)\n\nNaomi Scott Edwards (1910-??, daughter of Charles and Susie Ann Jones Edwards)\n\nAs was their principal, the Colored High School’s teachers seem to have been short-term Wilson residents:\n\nF. Meredith — in the 1928 Wilson city directory, duplicate entries (though the names differ slightly): Wm. J.F. Meredith, school teacher, 624 East Green; James Meredith, school teacher, Wilson High School, 624 East Green. In the 1930 census of Wilson, Wilson County: Edwin W. Fisher, 56, district manager insurance company; wife Daisey V., 52; daughter Susie A., 21; and lodgers James F. Anderson, 26, Indiana-born school teacher, and William Meredith, 25, Tennessee-born school teacher.\n\nJ.E. Amos — in the 1928 Wilson city directory, Jane E. Amos, teacher, Wilson High School, 111 Pender. In the 1930 city directory, Jane E. Amos, teacher, Wilson High School, 919 Atlantic. However, in the 1930 census of Wilson, Wilson County: at 919 East Nash, brickmason James Russell, 42; wife Julia, 42; and daughter Annie, 7, plus lodger James E. Amos, 41, South Carolina-born school teacher. This is surely Jane E. Amos.\n\nJ.T. Anderson — see James F. Anderson at F. Meredith, above.\n\nB.M. Davis — in the 1928 Wilson City directory, Bessie M. Davis, teacher, Wilson High School, 908 East Nash. In the 1930 census of Wilson, Wilson County: at 913 East Green Street, teachers Ruth A. Brown, 23, of Nevada; Annie Wilson, 25, of North Carolina; Lucile Wynn, 22, of Virginia; and Bessie Davis, 28, of Washington, D.C.\n\nC.F. Hunt — in the 1928 Wilson City directory, Cornelia F. Hunt, teacher, Wilson High School, 1009 East Nash. In the 1930 city directory, Cornelia F. Hunt, teacher, Wilson High School, 910 East Green. This is likely the Cornelia Frances Hunt born in 1907 in Granville County, North Carolina.\n\nPhotograph courtesy of Darden Alumni Center, Wilson.\n\nClass of ’37.\n\nThis photograph of Wilson Colored High School’s Class of 1937 also hangs in the hallway of the Darden Alumni Center.\n\nA label listing the students’ names has been augmented where possible with birth and death dates and parents’ names, below.\n\nCharles Darden James (1914-1994, Randall R. and Elizabeth Darden James)\n\nHoward Monroe Fitts Jr. (1921, Howard M. and Elizabeth Plummer Fitts)\n\nDoris Louise Crooms Caldwell Robinson (1920-1992, Lloyd and Maggie Jones Crooms)\n\nHerman Oliver Marshall (1918-2005, John and Annie Marshall)\n\nDelores Robbins Coleman (1920-2003, James D. and Louise Davis Robbins)\n\nAlice McCoy (1915-1983, Russell and Ometa Smith McCoy)\n\nLucy Dawson Artice Moss (1922-1989, Jesse A. and Sophia Dawson Artice)\n\nHennie Ennis Campbell (1920-2012, Samuel and Maggie Taylor Ennis)\n\nHattie E.

Darden High School. Camillus L. Darden, after donating books to stock the school library, won the right to rename Wilson Colored High School after his father.\n\nA label listing the students’ names has been augmented where possible with birth and death dates and parents’ names, below.\n\nFirst row: Kester Congress Mitchell (1919-??, Kester R. and Martha Taylor Miller); William Aaron Best (1921-??, Aaron and Estell Best); Clarence Herman Best (1918-1994, Clarence and Best); Milton Jasper King (1920-??); Walter M.

A label listing the students’ and teachers’ names has been augmented where possible with birth and death dates and parents’ names, below. Many eastern North Carolina counties did not provide secondary education for African-American children in the 1930s. As a result, families who wanted schooling beyond the elementary grades chose to send their children to Wilson to board with local families and attend high school.
