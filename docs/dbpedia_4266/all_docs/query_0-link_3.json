Sure, let us sing that song — The clan goes marching on! When danger threatened country or a battle to be won. Or righteous causes need defenders or work to be done, Brave Butlers were right there, and never did a Butler run. The clan goes marching on!

(A) INTRODUCTION SHE Butler Family is among the forty-nine “best families” selected by the American Historical-Genealogical Society for whom the Society has published family histories during the past few years. The Butler Family has been prominent in the British Empire and in the United States, its members having played important roles in war and in peace. Family pride is a commendable trait and should be cultivated. All-Butlers have just cause to be proud of their family history and traditions. In reference No. 3, No. 10 and No. 14 we find the following regarding the origin and meaning of the name Butler : The forms of entry of the name of Butler are endless. The name was both official and occupational. In the first case, it was derived from the office of Chief Butler of Ireland, an honor which was conferred upon Theobald — sur¬ name Le Botiler or Butler — by Henry II in 1177, and which remained heredi¬ tary in his descendants for .many generations. As to the second derivation, we find in the York Pageant of 1415 the “Botillers,” the “Cap-makers,” and “Pouchmakers” all walking together in pro¬ cession. They were all obviously engaged in the leather manufacture. The idea of a bottle, as understood by our forefathers five hundred years ago, was that of a leathern case to hold liquids or solids. Thus we see the “Botiller” was often identical with the pouch-maker. A few of the old forms of the name are “Butelere,” “Buteller,” “Botyler\" and “Bottler.” Mention is made in the Roll of Battell Abbev, 1066, of “Bote- lere.” The data in this volume is gathered from reliable sources. We have selected what we consider the most important material. Many of the daughters, and sons for whom no issue was shown, have been omitted from the pedigrees. A missing symbol indicates that a name has been omitted. Those desiring further information are advised to consult the volumes mentioned in the list of Refer¬ ences. The compiler hopes that, in producing this volume, he is bringing to the Butler Family information which will be of interest and value to them, and that he is rendering an important service to the public. He and his associates will be glad to give their co-operation to members of the family who are interested in having a complete genealogy of the family published. Unless otherwise plainly shown, the persons in this volume whose names are accompanied by three figures are children of the immediately preceding persons bearing immediately preceding numbers. All persons in each group bearing the same letter as a part of their numbers are directly related. The generations of the descendants of those bearing numbers of three figures are represented as follows. However, some of our material is published as copied from various records without rearrangement according to this system. 5 ' ■ J ' ;• ■ j_ - esnrrjK -T 91 : s<iioo oj -:nB riot':, ;*ioint ; it: iuiL’tlrfo r. iaun t- ••• 1 a-,..

Coats of Arms were originally used for purposes of identification and recognition on the field of battle as well as in civil life. It is claimed by some writers that Coats of Arms, in a crude form, were used by Noah’s sons after the flood. There are records of other Coats of Arms, in one crude form or another, at different periods of ancient history. Jrleraldry, however, as we know it today, did not become of much importance until soon after the invasion of England by William the Conqueror, A. D. 1066. Heraldry became of general interest at about the time of the Crusades. The Butler Coat of Arms shown in the front of this volume is the Arms of the Butlers, Earls and Dukes of Ormonde (created. 1177) and hereditary Chief Butlers of Ireland, the illustrious and ancient family from whom nearly all other Butlers are descended. Coats of Arms very similar to it are used by several branches of the Butler family. And numerous other branches have Coats of Arms resembling it. This is the most widely used of all Butler Coats of Arms and has been in existence for manv centuries. It is described in BURKE'S GENERAL ARMORY, BURKE’S LANDED GENTRY. BURKE’S PEERAGE AND BARONETAGE and other public works on heraldry, in many cases accom¬ panied by illustrations and pedigrees. It has been used for generations by many American branches of the Butler family. HERALDIC LANGUAGE ENGLISH DESCRIPTION Arms .

The golden cups in the second quarter are symbolic of the office of the Chief Butler of Ireland, whose duty was to hand to the king the first cup of wine at banquets of state. The saltier or St. Andrew’s cross in the fourth quarter stands for courage ar.d is the reward of those who have scaled the walls of towns. Sir Bernard Burke, of Heralds College, London, said: “Heraldry is prized by all who can show honorable ancestry or wish to found honorable families.” Besides its family significance this Coat of Arms makes an excellent mural decoration and inspires the admiration and comment of all who see it. It is quite appropriate that members of the Butler family who have a pride in their ancestry should display the family Coat of Arms, in proper colors.

Their original name was Walter, from Walter one of their ancestors; and Theobald Walter came to Ireland with Henry the Second in 1172 and had the office of Chief Butler of Ireland conferred on him, the duty attached to which was to attend at the coronation of the Kings of England and present them with the first cup of wine. From the office of \"Butlership of Ire¬ land” they took the name of Butler. In the reign of Edward the Third, Tipperary was formed in to the “County Palatine of Ormond,” under the Butlers, who thus became so powerful that different branchers of them furnished many of the most distinguished families in Ireland. The Palatine possessed such real privileges that he ruled his palatinate almost as a King. The Butlers were Earls. Marquises and Dukes of Ormond, and also had the following titles in Tipperary : Earls of Carrick, Earls of Glen- gall, Viscounts of Thurles, of Skerrin and Barons of Cahir. In the reign of Henry VIII they gained possession of a great part of Carlow. The County of Kilkenney became possessed mostly by the Butlers, Earls and Dukes of Ormond. They were called Earls of Orrory and Gowyan, Viscounts of Galway and various other titles derived from their extensive estates. Their war cry was “Butler Aboo!” The word “aboo” is the old Celtic for “victory.” According to the “Norman People,” a London publication of 1874, the Ormond family, through the Irish Chief Butler, is traceable to a Walter, who came with the Conqueror and in 1086 was owner of estates in Laland. Lanca¬ shire. This Walter came from Glanville, near Caen. His arms were a chief indented. The two leading Anglo-Irish families in Ireland have long been the Fitz¬ geralds and the Butlers. From being comrades in arms of the invading \"Strong- bow,” they became by degrees rival Barons, and fierce contestants for the Vice Sovereignty of their adopted country. In the Wars of the Roses, the Butlers sided with the White Rose of Lancaster, and the Fitzgeralds with the Red Rose of York, factions gathered round the two great houses, and the bitter feud brought forth death and blood¬ shed from as early as 1250 down to the Williamite wars. The Butlers, whose chief had obtained the dignity of Earl of Ormond, succeeded in crushing the power of the elder branch of the Fitzgeralds. Butler of Ormonde The history of the illustrious house of Butler of Ormonde is. in point of fact, the history of Ireland from the time of the Anglo-Norman invasion. At the head of the great nobility of that country have ever stood the Butlers and the Geraldines, rivals in power and equals in renown. For ages their story fills the pages of the Irish annals, from the advent of Theobald Fitz-Walter in the reign of Henry II, down to the death of James, 2nd Duke of Ormonde, at Avignon, in 1745.
