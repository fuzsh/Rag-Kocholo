        "text": "I’ve spoken of the database I am developing of likely burials in Vick, Odd Fellows, and Rountree Cemeteries. My spreadsheet draws upon death certificates, obituaries, and other sources — most distressingly imprecise. The term “Rountree Cemetery” on these documents may refer to Vick, Odd Fellows, or Rountree. Some documents broadly refer only to burial in Wilson. However, in the absence of official burial records for any of the cemeteries, we make do.\n\nThis series honors the men, women, and children who never had grave markers, or whose stones have been lost or stolen or destroyed. Graves believed to be in Vick Cemetery, which the City of Wilson stripped of remaining markers in 1996, will be identified with a Vick Cemetery logo.\n\nIn the 1900 census of Ingrams, Johnston County: widower farmer Archie Artis, 78; daughters Bathanie, 32, and Alice E., 22; and granddaughters Victoria, 13, Effie, 10, and Pollie, 1.\n\nIn the 1908 Hill’s Wilson, N.C., city directory: Artis Alice (c) cook h Vance nr Pender\n\nIn the 1910 census of Wilson, Wilson County: Joe Evans, 26; wife Effie, 17; daughter Never E., 3; sister Victory E., 22, widow; [her?] children William, 7, Maggie, 6, and Harvey, 3; mother-in-law Bettie Artice, 37; aunt Alice, 35; and her daughter Polly, 10.\n\nOn 3 Dec 1914, Solomon Ward applied for a marriage license for Jesse Henderson of Wilson, age 21, son [great-nephew] of Jesse Jacobs and Sarah Jacobs, both dead, and Pauline Artis of Wilson, age 18, daughter of Alice Artis. On the same day, Fred M. Davis, Baptist minister, performed the ceremony at his residence before Mary Barnes, Annie Hines, and Willie Cromartie, all of Wilson. [Jesse and Sarah Henderson Jacobs, who were very much alive, reared Jesse, who was the son of Sarah’s sister.]\n\nIn the 1916 Hill’s Wilson, N.C., city directory: Artis Alice (c) dom h 219 1/2 Pender\n\nIn the 1920 census of Wilson, Wilson County: at 217 Pender Street, Jesse Henderson with wife Pauline, daughter Bessie, and mother-in-law Alice Artis. Jesse worked as a truck driver for a woodyard. Alice Artis was a cook for a private family.\n\nIn the 1930 census of Wilson, Wilson County: at 318 Pender Street, Jack Henderson, truck driver, 38; wife Pauline, 31, and children Bessie, 12, Alic, 10, Joice, 8, Mildred, 6, and Archy, 4, listed in the household of mother-in-law Alic Artis, 49, private cook, paying $18/month rent.\n\nIn the 1940 census of Wilson, Wilson County: at 309 Pender Street, Alice Artis, 56; daughter Pauline Henderson, 39, household servant; granddaughters Bessie L., 23, hotel elevator girl, Alice, 20, household servant, Joyce, 18, household servant, Mildred, 16, and Doris, 10; and grandson Robert [Bobby], 4.\n\nI have not found Alice Artis’ death certificate. Her grandchildren, however, report that she was buried in Vick Cemetery.\n\nWhen Elizabeth Hinnant made out her will on 10 April 1854, she left to Alvin H. Atkinson “one negroe boy named Joe,” the sole person she enslaved.\n\nAt the time she dictated her will, Hinnant lived in Johnston County, but by her death Wilson County had been formed. Loverd Atkinson filed in Wilson County court the inventory of Hinnant’s property shown below. First on the list, ahead of a sorrel mare, a bay horse, and three head of cattle, was Joe.\n\nAtkinson hired Joe out to unnamed persons for 18 days, and then until the following January.\n\n——\n\nOn 31 August 1866, Joseph Hinnant and Roda Godwin registered their six-year marriage with a Wilson County justice of the peace.\n\nIn the 1870 census of Springhill township, Wilson County: Joseph Hinniard, 30; wife Rodah, 27; and children Vandier, 8, Zadok, 6, Roxy, 4, and James, 1.\n\nIn the 1880 census of Springhill township, Wilson County: farmer Joseph Hinnant, 45; wife Rhoda, 43; and children Vandorne, 18, Dock, 16, Rocksey, 14, James T., 12, Toby, 10, Josiah, 8, Leviser, 6, John E., 4, and Martha, 1.\n\nIn the 1900 census of Springhill township, Wilson County: James T. Hinnant, 31; mother Rhoda, 59; father Joseph, 70; and sisters Lovisa, 25, Martha, 21, and Mary, 18.\n\nThis past weekend, Johnston County Heritage Center and Johnston County Heritage Commission put on a fantastic series of events focused on preserving the county’s African-American history and culture. Beth Nevarez, founder and principal of Beth Nevarez Historical Consulting, took notes for those of us who couldn’t be there:\n\n“This past weekend I sponsored & attended @johnstoncountyheritage’s event: Reclaiming the Black Past: An Artifactual Journey. The event highlighted the importance of preserving spaces/places, artifacts and songs & stories that relate to African American history.\n\nFriday evening we had a campfire conversation at the Boyette Slave House led by Joseph McGill of the @slavedwellingproject. Our gathering of about 25 discussed everything from those who lived in the Boyette Slave House & family history to issues of book bans and curriculums in schools today. We reflected on the importance of bringing awareness to the built environment that stands as a primary source of slavery’s past, as well as the importance of learning about that past in the present. Many thanks to Joseph McGill for leading this conversation & to the Stancil family who owns the property the Boyette Slave House sits on for hosting us.\n\n“Saturday’s program included hearing more from Joe McGill on how he started the Slave Dwelling Project and the many ways in which it has evolved over the years. He spoke of the myths he works against including that slavery was only a southern institution.\n\n“Then we heard from @philip_j_merrill of @nanny_jack_and_co about the importance and power of physical artifacts to preserve and share Black history. He brought along a number of interesting artifacts and spoke about ‘peeling back the onion layers’ of meaning and the many different ways artifacts, even some you wouldn’t expect, can be used to talk about Black history.\n\n“We also heard both songs and history from @maryd.w who sang spirituals throughout her powerful presentation about the historical context of these songs and how they were used by enslaved people and later in the civil rights movement with coded messages hidden in their lyrics. These songs were passed down orally rather than in writing and contained messages of freedom and resistance.\n\n“We concluded the day with a visit to the Sanders-Smith cemetery where descendants spoke the names of their ancestors buried there.”\n\nWRAL News covered the gathering at Sanders-Smith Cemetery:\n\n“Why is a cemetery hidden [in] a wooded stretch of land running alongside the highway – and directly adjacent to a modern day parking lot for the Johnston County Agricultural Center?\n\n“According to [Todd] Johnson[, Executive Director for Johnston County Heritage Center], the land was all once part of the Sanders plantation.\n\n“‘Ashley Sanders owned this land, which was roughly a 1,500 acre plantation,’ said Johnson. ‘His father was one of the largest landowners, who owned probably around 10,000 acres total. He left plots of land to his children.'”\n\n…\n\n“After the families enslaved here were emancipated after the Civil War, one of the men that had been enslaved on the property bought 25 acres of the plantation — including the cemetery.\n\n“‘His name was Adam Sanders,’ said Johnson.\n\n“By purchasing the cemetery land, Adam Sanders helped preserve the burial ground for future generations of his family – and help protect those who were already interred there.\n\n“‘His parents were likely buried here,’ said Johnson.”\n\nMany descendants of those enslaved by Ashley Sanders and family later migrated into Wilson County, such as Rodger Creech Jr., who attended Saturday’s observance at the cemetery. Future posts in Black Wide-Awake will attempt to make some of these connections.\n\nKudos to Johnston County for recognizing the importance of African-American history outside of Black History Month, for bringing Joseph McGill’s groundbreaking work to eastern North Carolina, and for recognizing Sanders-Smith Cemetery as an historic sacred space.\n\nI recently shared news of an exciting September event — Joseph McGill’s visit to Boyette slave dwelling, sponsored by Johnston County Museum of History.\n\nBeth Nevarez let me know that Todd Johnson, Executive Director of Johnston County Heritage Center, has researched a connection between the Boyette slave cabin and Alfred Boyette, whom we met here and here. Johnson is seeking descendants of men and women, like Alfred Boyette, who might have inhabited the small, plank-clad house.\n\nGeorge Boyette owned the farm on which the Boyette dwelling was built and the enslaved people who lived there. In 1844, Boyette drafted a will that include a bequest to his son James Boyette of “one negro boy named Alford.”\n\nOther enslaved people named in the will were Silvy, Carolina, and James Henderson, who were bequeathed to George’s son Larkin G. Boyette, and Maryan, who was designated for daughter Martha Brotten [Broughton]. William and Hardy Hinnant were witnesses to Boyette’s signature.\n\nBoyette’s estate entered probate in 1852. A property inventory lists nine enslaved people — Sylva, 37; Caroline, 16; James, 14; Alfred, 12; Maryan, 9; Annylise, 7; Wm. Hardy, 4; Emsly, 3; and Jol, 10 months. Sylvia is likely the mother of the children.\n\nJames Boyette lived in present-day Old Fields township, Wilson County. The 1860 slave schedule lists him with eight enslaved people — a 28 year-old woman; an 8 year-old girl; a 19 year-old man [likely Alfred]; and five boys, aged 12, 9, 7, 4, and 2.\n\nOn 20 January 1867, Alfred Boyette and Liza Barnes were married in Wilson County.\n\nIn the 1870 census of Wilson, Wilson County: Alfred Boyette, 26, farm laborer; wife Eliza, 29; and Julius Freeman, 21, carpenter. [Freeman, of course, was the father of O.N. and Julius Freeman Jr., among other. We know he was born in Johnston County, but have no concrete information about his life before 1870, or his relationship, if any, to Alfred or Eliza.]\n\nIn the 1880 census of Wilson, Wilson County: on Spring Street, Alfred Boyette, 40, working on street; wife Eliza, 45; daughter Sylvia, 9; and boarder Albert Barnes, 22, working at ice house. [Sylvia was apparently named for her father’s mother.]\n\nOn 18 November 1897, Alfred Boyette, 55, son of Hady [Hardy] Hinnant, married Mrs. Mary Armstrong, 37, daughter of Raford Dew, at the home of Raford Dew in Wilson township. Missionary Baptist minister M. Strickland performed the ceremony in the presence of Bush Dew, Moses Dew and Henry Melton. [Was Alfred Boyette’s father the white Hardy Hinnant that witnessed George Boyette’s will, or an enslaved man named Hardy, who is listed among people enslaved by Johnston County farmer James Hinnent, or someone else with that name?]\n\nIn the 1900 census of “genater” [janitor] Alfred Boyett, 59; wife Mary, 32; and children Alfred, 1, Etna, 9, and Willie, 13.\n\nIn the 1910 census of Wilson, Wilson County: Alfred Boyette, 75, laborer for court; wife Mary, 40; and children Millian, 21, and Willie, 18, both factory laborers, Edna, 11, and Gincy, 9.\n\nJincy McBride died 3 November 1925 in Wilson. Per her death certificate, she was born 6 September 1901 in Wilson to Alford Boyett and Mary Dew; was married to Harrison McBride; and worked as a tobacco factory day laborer. Informant was Mary Dew, 304 Walnut Street.\n\nAmie Lee, who died 18 December 1928 in Raleigh, Wake County, North Carolina, was possibly Alfred Boyette’s sister. Per her death certificate, she was 91 years old; was born to Hardy Hinton [Hinnant?] and an unknown mother; was the widow of Henderson Lee [a United States Colored Troops veteran]; and lived at 1296 East Edenton. [In the 1880 census of Wilders township, Johnston County, Amy Lee, 30, is the head of a household that includes Hardy, 15, Octavia, 12, Elizabeth, 3, and Aaron, 1.]\n\nJames Boyette Sr. died 4 March 1960 at his home at 504 Stantonsburg Street, Wilson. Per his death certificate, he was born 18 February 1899 in Wilson County to Alfred B0yette and Mary Magdalene Dew; and worked as a laborer. Informant was James Boyette Jr.\n\n——\n\nAre you an Alfred Boyette descendant?
