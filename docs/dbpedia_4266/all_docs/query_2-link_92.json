        "text": "March 11, 1938 – September 15, 2022\n\nFleta Aline Warr Hill, 84, of Friendswood, Texas, passed away peacefully, September 15, 2022, at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Fleta was born on March 11, 1938, in St. Augustine County, Texas, to Ora Spurlock Chance and Robert (Bob) Warr. She and her mom moved to Friendswood in June of 1951. She graduated from Friendswood High School in 1957. At that time there were only 48 students in the high school and 126 in the district. Fleta participated in the All-State Choir, FHS choir, band, basketball, cheerleading, one-act play, class officer and Rainbow Girls. After high school Fleta first worked at Prudential Insurance Company before marrying her high school sweetheart and love of her life, Arden C. Hill, Jr., on May 2, 1958. Fleta also worked for the U.S. Post Office and loved her job as she was able to meet many new residents when they first moved to Friendswood. She retired from the Post Office in 1973, before joining Arden in the office at Hill Sand Company.\n\nArden and Fleta were always partners in business and began running their first gas station, a Texaco, in 1962. They later opened the Phillips 66 in 1963, while operating Hill Trucking Company. In 1969, Hill Sand Company was founded and became a thriving business for the family. Later in 1980, they bought and ran Bar H Ranch in Alto, Texas, which Fleta loved and continued to visit until she fell ill. Arden and Fleta were involved in Friendswood community and school activities including following the football team in a bus named The Sandman that they converted for fun and hospitality. She was involved in the early spirit of Friendswood watching it grow from 300 citizens to thousands.\n\nFleta was active in various clubs and organizations. She was a member of the Quaker Church from the time she moved to Friendswood until her death. She served as a Vacation Bible School helper with the Friendswood Friends Church for many years as well as singing in the church choir because of her love of music. She volunteered with the Frank J. Brown Heritage Museum and served as the president for two years. As part of her tenure, she welcomed Ron Stone to Friendswood for a segment of The Eyes of Texas. One of her true joys in life was the friendships she made and shared with her FIG sisters. The Friendship Investment Group, founded in January 1982, was started by a group of women who supported each other through life’s ups and downs, joys and sorrows, while investing in the stock market. They often traveled off their earnings and made memories galore. They were her true sisters that she never had and lifelong friends. She never met a stranger and became a woman of many words.\n\nFleta and Arden raised a daughter and son in the town they loved. She truly enjoyed time spent with her family especially her three grandchildren and one great grandchild. Known as MeMe, she never missed a game, dance recital, or musical. In addition, she shared her beloved ranch with them as they grew up. She particularly loved lunch dates with her great grandson at the Charleston Tea Room.\n\nFleta was preceded in death by Arden, her husband of 31 years; her half-brothers, Claude Chance, Larry Chance, Maxi Chance, Lonnie Chance, and her parents Ora and Bob Warr. She leaves behind her daughter Anita Hill Griffon and husband Robert; her son Arden C. Hill, III, (Trey) and wife Jamie; and her 3 grandchildren: Robert Joshua Griffon and wife Britney, Abigail Arden Griffon, and Arden C. Hill, IV, and her great grandson Robert Jacob Griffon.\n\nFriends are cordially invited to the visitation with the family on Monday, September 19, 2022 from 5:00 P.M. – 7:00 P.M. at Jeter Memorial Funeral Home, 311 N. Friendswood Dr., Friendswood, Texas 77546 (281) 992-7200.\n\nThe funeral service will be held on Tuesday, September 20, 2022 at 3:00 P.M. at Friendswood Friends Church, 502 S. Friendswood Dr., Friendswood, Texas 77546 with Rev. David Bridges officiating. Interment will follow at Friends Cemetery in Friendswood, Texas.\n\nThe family suggests that memorial gifts may be made to Friendswood Friends Church, 502 S. Friendswood Dr., Friendswood, Texas 77546."
