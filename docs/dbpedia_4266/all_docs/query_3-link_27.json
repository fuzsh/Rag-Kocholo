He gives\n\ncredit to his fellow ECU team-\n\nmates and said that the 4 x\n\n100 relay team finished fourth in\n\nthe Nationals and has the talent\n\nand speed to capture the NCAA\n\n4 X 100 relay title.\n\nLee now has his sights are\n\nset on preparing for the Olym-\n\npic trials July 16-23, 1988 in In-\n\ndianapolis and hopefully running\n\nfor the gold in Seoul.\n\nValeria Cloud\n\n43\n\n15 16 17 18 19 20 21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\noo eee eT ee erm SE ENE eK eres TE\n\nMatthew Hall Moore, An-\n\nthony ~~Tyge� Pistorio and Mi-\n\nchael Hart, all students at ECU,\n\nwere arrested at the party on\n\nBiltmore Street between Fifth\n\nand Fourth streets. Hart was\n\ncharged with being drunk and\n\ndisruptive while both Moore and\n\nPistorio were charged with\n\ndrinking in public and resisting\n\narrest. Moore also was charged\n\nwith assault on a police officer.\n\nStudents at the party said\n\npolice used unnecessary vio-\n\nlence in the arrests of Moore\n\nand Pistorio. Two days after the\n\nmelee, Moore had cuts across\n\nhis face and on the side of his\n\nnose from where his face had\n\nbeen forced down onto his\n\nporch. A blood stain on the\n\nporch had yet to be cleaned.\n\n46\n\nGreg Christeson said he\n\nsaw eight officers making one\n\narrest and that they smashed\n\nMoore's face onto his porch.\n\nHe said the officers were un-\n\nprovoked.\n\nThe people were all on\n\ntheir property, he said. ~~No\n\none was on the street. People\n\nwere staying on their property.�\n\nBut Sgt. A. S. Fordham, the\n\nshift officer in charge at the\n\nscene, said his office had re-\n\nceived complaints earlier about\n\nthe noise and about students\n\nstanding in the street. He said\n\nthere were students in the\n\nstreet when officers arrived at\n\nthe scene, and that officers\n\ncould not find a block party per-\n\nmit anywhere. It was later\n\nlearned that the permit had\n\n11 12 13 14 15 16\n\n17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25\n\nbeen denied because the party\n\nwas not sponsored by an au-\n\nthorized organization.\n\nGreenville Police Capt. Nel-\n\nson Staton, interim assistant\n\nchief of police, arrived on the\n\nscene at 5:45 p.m. He said he\n\nimmediately made several pleas\n\nfor students to break up the\n\nparty. Some students, he said,\n\ndid leave. Others started swear-\n\ning at the police.\n\nStaton said that in his opin-\n\nion, officers only used the force\n\nnecessary to make the arrests.\n\nFordham later responded to\n\nabuse charges by saying,\n\nWhenever you've got that size\n\nof a crowd, and you have to\n\nmake an arrest, you're going to\n\nget that kind of allegation. |\n\ndont think there was any ex-\n\ncess force used. | think there\n\nwas just enough force to make\n\nthe arrests and clear them out\n\nof there.�\n\nAfter the party, students\n\npassed around a petition asking\n\neveryone to sign as witnesses\n\nto the alleged excessive force.\n\nFour days later, city and\n\nuniversity officials met to dis-\n\ncuss how to prevent incidents\n\nlike the one on Biltmore Street\n\nfrom happening again.

In addition, shirts were\n\ndesigned for the football team that read ~Count Me In.�\n\nal\n\nWle)amele)ger-la)\n\n88\n\na on!\n\nee SRA na Di a\n\na ~ A\n\nTare.\n\nprep neay\n\n= ie\n\ns\n\nNa\n\ncm\n\noeeseeav ere me ere emes FR ee aR EEA ETE SE NA SA hn\n\n© Stele RA Orne SS: - ~ \"\" = sear - - - - - A es Te RT Re Re eS Se Lee\n\nEven with the new outlook and a ton of\n\nconfidence, the Pirates faced one of the\n\nnations most challenging schedules.\n\nBut the Pirates were ready to give it their\n\nall. So whatever the turnout of the ~87\n\nfootball season, another chapter would\n\nsurely be added to Pirate Football his-\n\ntory.\n\nN. C. STATE\n\nOpening the season at Carter-Fin-\n\nley Stadium, the Pirates defeated the\n\nWolfpack 32-14 in front of the largest\n\ncrowd ever to witness a football game\n\nin the state. The ECU-N. C. State game\n\nhas traditionally become the hottest tick-\n\nets in North Carolina in the 1980s.\n\nEast Carolina enjoyed their opening\n\nsuccess as East Carolina quarterback\n\nTravis Hunter led the Pirate offense.\n\nE.C.U.s offense also had four runners\n\na ee Be ee\n\naE z mS i ? ag ee Z\n\n% sg | join 7H\n\nbad ~ a\n\n2 ee tage : : pra ri\n\ntis pipe die\n\noe\n\n;\n\nwith more than 50 yards rushing. Full-\n\nback Anthony Simpson led all rushers\n\nwith 67 yards on 18 carries. Tailback\n\nJarrod Moody added 57 yards and two\n\ntouchdowns, while third-team fullback\n\nGeorge Franklin also added 57 yards.\n\nHunter, who ran the Pirate offense effec-\n\ntively throughout the rainy evening, fin-\n\nished with 53 yards rushing. Not only did\n\nthe Pirates play an outstanding game,\n\nbut the Pirates gained more yards (295)\n\nthan in any game during the 1986 sea-\n\nson, while the defense allowed fewer\n\nyardage (247) than in any game from the\n\nprevious year.\n\nFLORIDA STATE\n\nFollowing a 32-14 win to the N.C.\n\nState Wolfpack, the Pirates returned\n\nhome to take on the second-highest\n\nranked team to ever play in Greenville,\n\nThomas Walters\n\nFlorida State Seminoles. Coach Baker\n\nwas aware of FSUs explosive offense,\n\nbecause of his assistant coaching job at\n\nFSU in 1984. Unfortunately, East Caroli-\n\nna fell to the eight-ranked Florida State\n\nby a score of 44-3.\n\nOur execution against Florida\n\nState was very poor, and the results\n\nshowed on the scoreboard and the stat\n\nsheet. They (FSU) are a powerful foot-\n\nball team, with a fine as offense as we\n\nwill face, and a very hard-hitting de-\n\nfense. But we added to their strengths\n\nby giving up the football far too many\n\ntimes -Coach Baker.\n\nILLINOIS\n\nThe contest between East Carolina\n\nand the University of Illinois was the first\n\nmeeting between two teams, as well it\n\nmarked the first time the Pirates faced\n\nAmmer OB AKER guy ariag etre VENTE\n\na team from the Big Ten. But for the sec-\n\nond-straight week the East Carolina\n\nFootball team fell victim, this time it was\n\nto Illinois, 20-10.\n\nThe day was not a total disappoint-\n\nment though, ECU punter Craig Losito\n\nhad one of his better games. The junior\n\nfrom Jacksonville, N.C., punted five\n\ntimes for a 44.6 - yard average against\n\nIllinois. Losito punted a 67 yard punt\n\nfrom his own endzone, a personal re-\n\ncord. In addition, senior linebacker Vin-\n\nson Smith enjoyed one of his finest\n\ngames with nine unassisted tackles and\n\none assist, along with a fumble recovery.\n\nGEORGIA SOUTHERN\n\nEven with record of 1-2 after the\n\nloss at Illinois (20-10), the Pirates were\n\nready to move onward. And move on-\n\nward they did, right over Georgia South-\n\nern with a 16-13 win.\n\nTrailing 10-0 after the first quarter,\n\nthe Pirates took their 16-13 lead with\n\n2:38 still remaining. Georgia Southern\n\nhad a chance to tie the game with 6 sec-\n\nonds remaining, but Eagle quarterback\n\nKen Burnette fumbled the snap and the\n\nPirates held on to even their record at 2-\n\n2.\n\nPirate fullback Anthony Simpson\n\nhad his second straight 100-yard rush-\n\ning effort against Georgia Southern.\n\nSimpson rushed 21 times for 112 yards\n\nand two touchdowns to lead ECU. Ju-\n\nnior tailback Reggie McKinney had a\n\nsuccessful afternoon with 52 yards\n\nrushing and 126 yards in kickoff returns.\n\nSophomore wide receiver Walter Wil-\n\nson also caught two key passes for 32\n\nyards on the afternoon.\n\nCoach Baker now stood looking at\n\nthe rest of the season and how they\n\nwould achieve their one goal. ~~Our goal\n\nfrom day one this year has been to have\n\na winning season, and now our backs\n\nare to the wall, Baker said. ~~We have\n\nTemple here next Saturday and then we\n\ngo to Southern Mississippi. We have to\n\npick ourselves up and achieve our goal.\n\nTEMPLE\n\nWith only one game to play after\n\nTemple, the dream of obtaining a win-\n\nning season was alive and well. The East\n\nCarolina Pirates still stood a great\n\nchance of ending with a winning season\n\nafter a victory over Temple, by a score\n\nSTEREO oem CER RENE EL TOE EEE fener Saar ec Tauern neem\n\nF2\n\nA+ ce a: St ee . bi\n\nSe ee ae\n\nDefensively, senior safety Ellis Dil-\n\nlahunt had his third interception of the\n\nseason, while also collecting seven\n\ntackles. Senior linebacker Vinson Smith\n\nled all Pirates with nine tackles and a\n\nfumble recovery.\n\nWEST VIRGINIA\n\nWith a 2-2 record after the game\n\nagainst Georgia Southern, hopes of a\n\nwinning season were still in grasp. Un-\n\nfortunately, the 40-0 loss to West Virgin-\n\nia put those dreams on hold. It was the\n\nPirates worst defeat in six seasons.\n\nLast years home opener against\n\nWest Virginia was a much more thrilling\n\ngame. What looked like a second win of\n\nthe season, turned into a six second dis-\n\nappointment. The final score against\n\nWest Virginia was 24-21.\n\nUnfortunately the game played this\n\nseason was plagued by mistakes by the\n\nPirates that left no hopes of winning.\n\nNow the only thing the Pirates could do\n\nwas to put this loss behind and prepare\n\nfor the game against Cincinnati.\n\nCINCINNATI\n\nEast Carolinas 56-28 win over Cin-\n\ncinnati not only brought back ECUs\n\npride, but the hope of a winning season\n\nwas alive again. The Pirates now stood\n\nwith a 3-3 record.\n\nThe win against Cincinnati put Pi-\n\nrate history in the making, thanks to\n\nsome outstanding athletes. The day was\n\nhighlighted by the performance of\n\nReggie McKinney. The Mt. Olive native\n\ngained 212 yards on 20 carries to notch\n\nthe second-highest single game rushing\n\nmark in ECU history. To add to the excit-\n\ning day, 41-3 victory over the Pirates.\n\nNeedless to say the day wasnt a total\n\nloss, at least to Ron Jones. He enjoyed\n\none of the finest receiving days by a Pi-\n\nrate in 16 seasons when he caught sev-\n\n11 12 13 14 15 16 17\n\nen passes against Miami.\n\nECU senior linebacker, Vinson\n\nSmith to draw attention to himself, with\n\nten tackles against the Hurricanes, in-\n\ncluding two behind the line of scrim-\n\nmage. Smith also covered two fumbles\n\nand intercepted two passes.\n\n18 19 20 21 22 23 24\n\n25\n\nae FD\n\nas\n\n%\n\ncm\n\neRe ON me eee GEE Ed OO EE EEE seme we ra eterna\n\nA ae nn P\n\nA nem anne me ee cp mera ER\n\nae eee)\n\nETH\n\n94\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nreseyes Jey\n\n17\n\n18\n\nof 31-26. This now tied up the season 5-\n\n33\n\nPirate wide receiver Walter Wilson\n\nenjoyed an outstanding game against\n\nTemple. The sophomore from Baltimore\n\nMD., caught four passes for 108 yards.\n\nSophomore quarterback for the Pirates\n\nrushed for an even 500 yards against\n\nCincinnati to record the third highest\n\nrushing day in school history. It was the\n\nsecond time during the game series be-\n\ntween ECU and Cincinnati that the Pi-\n\nrates have had two different backs score\n\ntwo touchdowns each in a game, Willie\n\nLewis and Anthony Simpson.\n\nECUs backup quarterback, Charlie\n\nLibretto seemed to be at his best against\n\nCincinnati. The sophomore led ECU\n\nquickly downfield, completing three-of-\n\nfour passes for 62 yards to set up Chuck\n\nBerleths 29-yard field goal. Junior full-\n\nback Tim James also scored his first\n\ntouchdown in the Cincinnati game.\n\nVIRGINIA TECH\n\nOctober the 17th stood as a remind-\n\ner to the Pirates of what they were capa-\n\nble of doing. East Carolinas 32-23 win\n\nover Virginia Tech, was the Pirates first\n\nwin outside the state of North Carolina\n\nsince the last game of the 1983 season.\n\nPirate quarterback Travis Hunter\n\nset a school record for single-game total\n\noffense against Virginia Tech as he ac-\n\ncounted for 313 yards. The sophomore\n\nfrom Winter Garden, Fla., passed for 228\n\nyards and rushed for 85 yards and three\n\ntouchdowns to lead the Pirates to vic-\n\ntory.\n\nOne of the biggest plays in seasons,\n\ncame with the win over Virginia Tech.\n\nECU faced a second and long situation\n\nfrom its own 26-yard-line when Travis\n\nHunter connected with fullback Tim\n\nJames on a screen pass that turned into\n\na 74-yard touchdown.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nHopes of the winning season were\n\nstill reachable after a 34-12 loss at South\n\nCarolina. East Carolinas record was\n\nnow 4-4.\n\nThe play of the day came from\n\nsophomore cornerback Junior Robin-\n\nson. Late in the second half, USC quar-\n\nterback Todd Ellis attemped a 25-yard\n\npass that was picked off by Robinson.\n\nThe High Point, NC, scampered down\n\n19 20 21 22 23 24\n\n25\n\nind-\n\nipa-\n\nwin\n\nfirst\n\nlina\n\nson.\n\nnter\n\notal\n\nlore\n\n228\n\nree\n\nviC-\n\nns,\n\nach.\n\ntion\n\navis\n\nTim\n\ninto\n\njere\n\nyuth\n\nvas\n\nrom\n\nbin-\n\nuar-\n\nard\n\nson.\n\nywn\n\ncm\n\nCA EN ee eee REE -mmNte\n\nOS ec\n\na 76-yard touchdown return.

Would this be the Pirates year\n\nfor a winning season or would it be an-\n\nOther year of defeat. The hopes of a win-\n\nning season depended all on the out-\n\ncome of this game against Southern\n\nMississippi. The Pirates knew the goal\n\nWas attainable. Last year when playing\n\nSouthern Mississippi the Pirates only\n\nloss by a score of 23-21.\n\nIt looked as if ECUs dream would\n\ncome true after a Libretto sparked a 80-\n\nyard scoring drive. Passes consisting of\n\n26 and 15 yards to Tony Smith and a 17-\n\nyard toss to Jarrod Moody carried the\n\nball closer to a touchdown. Then with\n\n1:30 remaining in the game, Libretto\n\npassed Smith a touchdown.\n\nTim James two point conversion\n\nrun was stopped short, leaving the\n\nscoreboard reading 38-34. The promis-\n\ning situation of a winning season, soon\n\nfaded when Southern Mississippi man-\n\naged to recover an ECU kick and retain\n\nontrol of the ball till time ran out. Much\n\nto everyones disappointment, Southern\n\nMississippi left the Pirates just ONE\n\nSHORT.\n\nTEAM ROSTER\n\nJARROD MOODY\n\nERNEST TYNES\n\nJACKIE ARMSTRONG\n\nROBERT MARTIN\n\nTRAVIS HUNTER\n\nBRAD WALSH\n\nDON GAYLOR\n\nRON JONES\n\n10 CHARLIE LIBRETTO\n\n11.

Coach Mike Steele is\n\nEast Carolinas seventeenth\n\nhead basketball coach. Steele\n\nwas previously head coach of\n\nnationally ranked De Paul Uni-\n\nversity.\n\nWhile at De Paul, Steele\n\nturned a troubled basketball\n\nprogram, which had a 5-20 rec-\n\nord one year before Steele took\n\nover, to a program that had the\n\nhighest amount of wins in De\n\nPauls history. Steele took De\n\nPaul all the way to the NCAA fi-\n\nnals, all within six years.\n\nHis hopes are to turn the\n\nPirates into a team that is as\n\ncompetitive as possible. Hav-\n\ning good competition in each\n\ngame, creates a ~team that the\n\nstudents and the community\n\ncan be proud of.\n\nSteele says that ~~when a\n\nteam plays with enthusiasm, the\n\nfans become more interested\n\nand enthusiastic, with support\n\nfor the home team. He says\n\nwith that, ~~the wins will come in\n\ntime.� For example,� he says,\n\na mere 50 people would show\n\nup when he started coaching\n\nat De Paul, ~~then at the end of\n\nsix years, the games were sold\n\nout!�\n\nWith ~Enthusiasm, he\n\nhopes that ~~the students will\n\nlook forward to the event.�\n\nOnce this is accomplished, he\n\nhopes this will start a tradition.\n\nFor four years Steele\n\nplayed varsity basketball for\n\nPurdue University. He started\n\nhis Junior year, and he served\n\nas team captain his final sea-\n\nson\n\nThrough his knowledge and\n\nexperience in the game, he\n\nfeels that, ~~the best thing about\n\nbeing a coach is | can appreci-\n\nate what the players are going\n\nthrough.�\n\n.\n\nAlthough Steele feels that ~\n\nathletics are a good learning | &\n\ndevice where people learn how\n\nto obey rules and regulations, 7*\n\nand learn a sense of responsi-\n\nbility, he also feels that ~~too\n\nmuch time is focused on athlet-\n\nics. Steele feels people need\n\nto be involved in other activities\n\nas well. Steele places ~~lots of\n\nemphasis on a degree, but he\n\nlikes to ~~get them to participate\n\nin other activities. For example,\n\nSteele was recently a chairper-\n\nson for the Special Olympics,\n\nand most of his players got in-\n\nvolved by helping out with the\n\nevents and athletes. j\n\nIn his ~free time off the i\n\ncourt, he likes to spend time 7 |\n\nwith his family. He has a won- if\n\nderful, supportive wife who is\n\ninvolved with athletics also, and\n\ntwo sons, Drew who is two, and\n\nDerek who is 5. | ¥\n\nCoach Steele likes to play f\n\ngolf, raquetball, and of course ~&\n\nbasketball.
