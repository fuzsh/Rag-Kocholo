        "text": "Lawrence Coulter Hill, widely known as Larry, passed away on July 1, 2024, at the age of 86 in Forsyth, Montana. Born on June 30, 1938, in Casa Grande, Arizona, Larry grew up to be an exceptional storyteller with a friendly and outgoing personality, treating everyone he met as a friend.\n\nHis journey began in Phoenix, where he attended Whittier Grade School followed by North High. After graduating high school, he joined a local car club, showing his prized 1939 Chevy four-door sedan.\n\nHe worked as a draftsman at Arizona Public Service for 13 years and served as a volunteer for the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Posse. He was an active member of the Phoenix Rod and Gun Club, achieving notable recognition by qualifying for the State Civilian Pistol Team. In 1961, his team competed at Camp Perry, Ohio, and placed 7th in class. Larry’s shooting skills were admirable, often being a top competitor in shooting competitions.\n\nHe later moved to Helena, Montana, where he briefly worked at a smelter before joining the Mountain Bell Telephone Company in Livingston. After two years of installing equipment in phone offices, Larry relocated to Forsyth, taking a position as a telephone man. He dedicated 21 years to the company before retiring. Post-retirement, Larry enjoyed life on his farm, indulging in his passions for recreational shooting, reloading, hunting, and blacksmithing; along with simpler pleasures like reading, watching westerns on the tv, and eating ice cream.\n\nLarry’s legacy is cherished by his wife, Pam Hill; his siblings, Jill Wierick and Don Hill; his children, Troy Hill (Terri) and Lori Paris (Tom), and Clay Hill (Julie); along with his grandchildren, Mallorie, Taylor, Tatum, Riley, and Coulter; and four great-grandchildren. He was preceded in death by his father, Larry Hill Sr., his mother, Marjorie Hill(VanZile), sisters Anita Verzi and Loretta Delong, and his daughter Lissa Palmer.\n\nLarry will be remembered not just for his achievements and hobbies, but for the warmth and generosity he extended to all who knew him. His stories and friendship will be dearly missed."
