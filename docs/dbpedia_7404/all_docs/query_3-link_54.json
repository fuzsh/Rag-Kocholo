We also test new and existing ventilation devices to determine their effectiveness in treating patients.\n\nSome of our best research tools include our fully-integrated electronic medical records, electronic documentation and data management systems, which allow us to consistently track our outcomes and conduct valuable research measurements. Such research allows Cleveland Clinic respiratory therapists to stay current in their field and be up-to-date on the latest pulmonary techniques.\n\nFor Medical Professionals\n\nRespiratory Therapy Opportunities\n\nWe invite you to join our team and experience the continued growth and advancement of the respiratory therapy profession in our world class institution.
