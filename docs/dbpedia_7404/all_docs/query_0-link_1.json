        "text": "Would you like to join an AARC committee? Incoming President Dana Evans is building committees of AARC Members that will support the mission of the AARC over the next two years. Use the online volunteer form linked below to indicate which committees you are interested in and share how your experience will benefit AARC. Submit your interest by September 6 for consideration. Committee announcements will be made in December 2024. https://lnkd.in/gwHkGzr6\n\nWe need your help now to get your members of Congress to cosponsor the SOAR Act! Join us and our partner organizations on Tuesday, August 27 to take action by calling your Senators and Representative to request that they support the SOAR Act! You‚Äôll receive some background information about the SOAR Act, as well as the tools to successfully speak with your elected officials. During this event, we will all make our calls to secure more support of the SOAR Act. Even if you have already contacted your legislators about the SOAR Act, we need your participation again with this timely request. We need your voice to continue this movement for better access to supplemental oxygen! Congress is back in session in September, and we need as many new cosponsors as possible to make sure that the legislation moves forward. Register now! https://lnkd.in/gc2KzsHi\n\nExplores Pathway 5 | Electrical Impedance Tomography: Research and Clinical Applications is now available! Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that visualizes the distribution of electrical conductivity within the body. In the context of the lung, EIT is utilized to measure the impedance changes that occur from air and blood volume variations during breathing. As an emerging monitoring technique in the United States, and among the seemingly endless array of physiological parameters that the respiratory therapist must navigate, this presentation will approach the application of lung-EIT pragmatically as a research and clinical tool. Explore the pathway: https://lnkd.in/ghGyh5DS\n\nüëè Kudos to Drs. Amy Hajari Case, Srihari Veeraraghavan, and Paul Boyce for taking a stand in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution! They‚Äôre urging local officials to support the Supplemental Oxygen Access Reform Act (SOAR). Did you know that half of supplemental oxygen users struggle to get their prescribed oxygen supply? The SOAR Act, introduced in Congress earlier this year, is set to change that by ensuring better access to oxygen for all patients with advanced lung disease. #SOARAct https://bit.ly/3WUBB1r"
