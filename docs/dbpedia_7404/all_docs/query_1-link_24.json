        "text": "Metroplex Hospital has earned Quality Respiratory Care Recognition (QRCR) under a national program aimed at helping patients and families make informed decisions about the quality of the respiratory care services available in hospitals.\n\nAbout 700 hospitals, or approximately 15 percent of hospitals in the United States, have applied for and received this award.\n\nThe QRCR program was started by the American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) in 2003 to help consumers identify those facilities using qualified respiratory therapists to provide respiratory care. Hospitals earning the QRCR designation ensure patient safety by agreeing to adhere to a strict set of criteria governing their respiratory care services. To qualify for the recognition, Metroplex provided documentation to the AARC proving they met the criteria to be considered a QRCR facility.\n\n“We are honored to receive the Quality Respiratory Care Recognition from the AARC,” said Amanda Richter, director of Respiratory Therapy at Metroplex. “We hope it confirms our commitment to providing the highest level of healthcare to our community.”\n\nThe AARC’s QRCR program grew out of growing concerns among health care leaders and the general public regarding the safety and quality of health care services provided to patients. Hospitals that meet the QRCR requirements provide a level of respiratory care consistent with national standards and guidelines, and should be commended for their commitment to quality care. A list of QRCR hospitals is maintained at the association’s website for consumers www.YourLungHealth.org.\n\nRespiratory therapists are specially trained health care professionals who work under physician’s orders to provide a wide range of breathing treatments and other services to people with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer, AIDS, and other lung or lung-related conditions. They also care for premature infants and are key members of lifesaving response teams charged with handling medical emergencies.\n\nThe AARC is a membership organization representing more than 50,000 health professionals involved in respiratory care nationwide."
