        "text": "As the only accredited credentialing body for respiratory care, the NBRC is proud to say that excellence defines us—just as it does for credentialed practitioners, educators, and other organizations and providers throughout the growing field of respiratory care. Through our membership with the Institute for Credentialing Excellence (I.C.E.) and close compliance with the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), we ensure the highest standards when preparing and conducting our credentialing examinations.\n\nAll seven NBRC examinations are accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) and reviewed every five years as part of the accreditation renewal process. Working with NCCA means we demonstrate unconditional compliance with stringent testing and measurement standards. Such recognition signifies our ongoing efforts to protect the integrity and excellence of respiratory patient care through high quality examination programs for respiratory therapists and pulmonary function technologists. As part of the accreditation renewal process, the NCCA reviews our credentialing programs every five years.\n\nIn addition, PSI – the professional testing agency contracted by the NBRC to assist in the administration of respiratory care credentialing examinations – is also a sustaining member of I.C.E.\n\nAn important part of our mission at the NBRC involves working collaboratively with other national organizations that share the universal goal of protecting and enhancing patient lives through excellence in respiratory care. We are proud to say our sponsors—who together appoint 18 members of our Board of Trustees—include these highly esteemed organizations:\n\nThe American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC)\n\nThe American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST)\n\nThe American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)\n\nThe American Thoracic Society (ATS)\n\nWe are equally proud of our long-standing and collaborative relationships with these related organizations:\n\nThe American Respiratory Care Foundation (ARCF)\n\nThe Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC)\n\nLambda Beta Society, also known as the National Honor Society for the Profession of Respiratory Care\n\nTogether with these organizations and the respiratory care professionals we come together to serve, EXCELLENCE defines us.\n\nWe understand it takes hard work and dedication to earn the NBRC badge of honor. To ensure the highest professional and ethical standards for credentialing—while also making examinations easily accessible for eligible candidates—we are proud to partner with PSI as our testing agency.\n\nPSI Services LLC, a private corporation headquartered in Glendale, California, has over 300 assessment centers across the United States. As a leader in the testing industry, PSI provides secure, reliable, and highly credible testing services, including development, administration, scoring and analysis.\n\nWith access to PSI’s nationwide network of secure testing locations, you can be sure there is an assessment center near you. Exams are easy to schedule, and because long-distance travel is usually not required, costs are minimal. We want candidates focused on demonstrating strengths, not traveling for testing, and our long-standing partnership with PSI makes that possible."
