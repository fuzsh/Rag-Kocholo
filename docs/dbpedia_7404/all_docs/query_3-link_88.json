        "text": "RECRUITMENT FRAUD ALERT\n\nIt has come to our attention that certain individuals and organizations are fraudulently contacting some of our candidates and making false employment offers at UCLA Health. They are also requesting personal information or money to allegedly progress the application or pay for work permits.\n\nTHESE COMMUNICATIONS ARE FRAUDULENT.\n\nThey do not originate from UCLA Health or any organizations or institutions associated with us.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:\n\nNeither UCLA Health (nor any organization that recruits on our behalf) will ever ask for any money or payments from applicants, at any point in the recruitment process.\n\nAll individuals who receive an employment offer from UCLA Health (directly or indirectly) will always be required to go through a formal recruitment process, which will always involve a virtual or in-person meeting with a UCLA Health employee or representative.\n\nPlease do not respond to such emails or to any unsolicited business propositions or offers from people with whom you are unfamiliar. Do not disclose your personal or financial details to anyone you do not know. If you ever receive such communications, contact your local police and provide them with all information you may have from the senders (email addresses, phone/fax details, etc.)."
