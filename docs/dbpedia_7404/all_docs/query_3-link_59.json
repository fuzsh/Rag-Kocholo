        "text": "Respiratory Therapists, also known as Respiratory Care Practitioners, provide treatment, evaluation, monitoring and management of patients with breathing disorders or cardiovascular problems. Respiratory therapists administer oxygen, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, manage mechanical ventilators, administer medications, monitor cardiopulmonary systems and measure lung function. Respiratory therapists treat all types of patients: premature infants whose lungs are not fully developed, elderly patients with chronic asthma or emphysema, as well as emergency care for heart attack, stroke, drowning or shock. Respiratory therapists work closely with physicians, nurses and other health care professionals to provide direct care to children and adults. (Source: American Association for Respiratory Care, Careers, What Is An RT?.)\n\nWork settings include acute care hospitals, newborn intensive care, emergency departments, air and ground transport, rehabilitation centers, long-term acute care facilities, and home health agencies.\n\nOur goal in SLCC’s Respiratory Therapy program is to prepare graduates with demonstrated competence in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains of Respiratory Care practice as performed by registered respiratory therapists (RRT’s).\n\nAt the successful conclusion of this program, students will be able to:\n\nDemonstrate basic cardiopulmonary knowledge in respiratory care.\n\nDemonstrate advanced knowledge and clinical skills in the practice of respiratory care.\n\nDemonstrate critical thinking skills in respiratory care.\n\nQualify to take the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) Therapist Multiple-Choice (TMC) exam.\n\nPass the National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) Therapist Multiple-Choice Self-Assessment Examination (TMC-SAE) and NBRC Clinical Simulation Self-Assessment Examination (CSE-SAE) exams to achieve graduation.\n\nOur Healing Arts Lab provides opportunities to practice patient care safely, using proper equipment without fear of real life consequences. This unique, state-of-the-art center specializes in interactive learning through the use of life-like scenarios, computerized mannequins, and hands-on, practical learning to simulate hospital, clinical, and long-term care settings.\n\nESSential functions for career and program success\n\nFor more information on monthly information sessions, please click here.\n\nFor quick review of program view the One Sheet.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe Salt Lake Community College Respiratory Therapy program holds provisional accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC; #200630).\n\nCommission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care\n\n1248 Harwood Road\n\nBedford, TX 76021\n\nPhone: 817-283-2835\n\nFax: 817-354-8519\n\nTo prepare graduates with demonstrated competence in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills) and affective (behavior) learning domains of respiratory care practices as performed by registered respiratory therapists (RRTs). Upon completion of the Respiratory Therapy program, you should have the skills and knowledge needed for board exams; TMC (Therapist Multiple Choice) exam (entry level), WRRT and/or CSE exam(s) (Registered Respiratory Therapist).

CoARC has completed the verification of the Outcomes data from the Annual Report of Current Status (RCS). This data is self-reported by respiratory care programs to CoARC and reflects the aggregate data for the three-year time period being reported.\n\nhttps://coarc.com/students/programmatic-outcomes-data/\n\nProgram Contacts"
