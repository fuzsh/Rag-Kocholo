        "text": "If you served at either of these locations between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, you may be eligible for disability and health care benefits:\n\nMarine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, or\n\nMarine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, North Carolina\n\nKeep reading on this page to learn more about these benefits and benefits for family members.\n\nAm I eligible for VA disability compensation?\n\nYou may be eligible for disability compensation payments on a presumptive basis if you meet all of these requirements. These requirements apply to Veterans, Reservists, and National Guard members.\n\nBoth of these descriptions must be true:\n\nYou served at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, and\n\nYou didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge when you separated from the military\n\nAnd you must have a diagnosis of 1 or more of these presumptive conditions:\n\nAdult leukemia\n\nAplastic anemia and other myelodysplastic syndromes\n\nBladder cancer\n\nKidney cancer\n\nLiver cancer\n\nMultiple myeloma\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\n\nParkinson’s disease\n\nEvidence shows a link between these conditions and exposure to chemicals found in the drinking water at Camp Lejeune and MCAS New River during this time.\n\nWhat does it mean to have a presumptive condition?\n\nTo get a VA disability rating, your disability must connect to your military service. For many health conditions, you need to prove that your service caused your condition.\n\nBut for some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these presumptive conditions.\n\nPresumptive conditions are established by law or regulation.\n\nIf you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption.\n\nHow do I file a claim for disability compensation?\n\nYou can file a new claim online now. You can also file by mail, in person, or with the help of a trained professional.\n\nFile for disability compensation online now\n\nLearn more about how to file a disability compensation claim\n\nNote: When you file, be sure to state that you’re applying for 1 or more of the presumptive conditions for Camp Lejeune.\n\nYou’ll need to provide this evidence (supporting documents) with your claim:\n\nYour military records that show you served at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, and\n\nMedical records that show you have 1 or more of the 8 Camp Lejeune presumptive conditions\n\nCan I also get health care benefits?\n\nYes. If you meet the service requirements for Camp Lejeune, you may be eligible to enroll in VA health care. If you have any of the 15 covered health conditions listed here, you won’t have to pay a copay for care for that condition.\n\nLearn how to apply for VA health care\n\nHere are the 15 covered conditions related to Camp Lejeune:\n\nBladder cancer\n\nBreast cancer\n\nEsophageal cancer\n\nFemale infertility\n\nHepatic steatosis\n\nKidney cancer\n\nLeukemia\n\nLung cancer\n\nMiscarriage\n\nMultiple myeloma\n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes\n\nNeurobehavioral effects\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\n\nRenal toxicity\n\nScleroderma\n\nNote: If you also get VA health care for other conditions that aren’t on this list, you may need to pay a copay for that care.\n\nBenefits for families who lived at Camp Lejeune\n\nWe may pay for or reimburse health care costs related to certain conditions if you meet all of these requirements.\n\nAll of these descriptions must be true:\n\nYou must be or have been a family member (meaning the birth or adopted child, married spouse, or otherwise a legal dependent) of a Veteran who served at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, and\n\nYou must have lived (or have been in utero while your mother lived) at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, and\n\nYou must apply for and be approved for benefits under current law\n\nNote: “In utero” means that your mother was pregnant with you at the time.\n\nWe may pay for or reimburse for care related to these conditions:\n\nBladder cancer\n\nBreast cancer\n\nEsophageal cancer\n\nFemale infertility\n\nHepatic steatosis\n\nKidney cancer\n\nLeukemia\n\nLung cancer\n\nMiscarriage\n\nMultiple myeloma\n\nMyelodysplastic syndromes\n\nNeurobehavioral effects\n\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma\n\nRenal toxicity\n\nScleroderma\n\nYou’ll need to fill out a Camp Lejeune Family Member Program Application (VA Form 10-10068) and send it to us by mail or fax.\n\nDownload VA Form 10-10068 (PDF)\n\nBy mail\n\nMail your completed form to:\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs\n\nFinancial Services Center\n\nPO Box 149200\n\nAustin, TX 78714-9200\n\nBy fax\n\nFax your form to .\n\nIf you need help with your application, call us at 866-372-1144 (TTY: 711). We’re here 8:30 a.m. to 4:55 p.m. ET.\n\nYou must provide all of this evidence:\n\nA document (like a marriage license, birth certificate, or adoption papers) that proves your relationship to the Veteran who served on active duty for at least 30 days at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, and\n\nA document (like utility bills, base housing records, military orders, or tax forms) that proves you lived at Camp Lejeune or MCAS New River, North Carolina, for at least 30 days between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, and\n\nMedical records that show you have 1 of the 15 covered health conditions. The records must include the date of your diagnosis and the date you got treated for this illness.\n\nYou may also want to provide a report from your health care provider. We don’t require this form, but it can help us determine your eligibility for benefits. Ask your provider to fill out a Camp Lejeune Family Member Program Treating Physician Report (VA Form 10-10068b).\n\nDownload VA Form 10-10068b (PDF)\n\nFor each claim, you’ll need to fill out a Camp Lejeune Family Member Program Claim Form (VA Form 10-10068a).\n\nDownload VA Form 10-10068a (PDF)\n\nYou must provide an itemized billing statement from your health care provider with your claim. If you have other health insurance, you must provide a document called an Explanation of Benefits from your other health insurance.\n\nHow the PACT Act affects Camp Lejeune claims and related benefits\n\nSection 804 of the Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act addresses people who lived at Camp Lejeune. This law is also called the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022.\n\nThis law allows Veterans, survivors, and families to file for appropriate relief for harm caused by exposure to the contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.\n\nYou (or your legal representative) can file for relief under this authority if either of these descriptions is true:\n\nYou lived, worked, or were otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, or\n\nYour mother lived, worked, or was otherwise exposed at Camp Lejeune for at least 30 days total between August 1, 1953, and December 31, 1987, while pregnant with you\n\nNote: The PACT Act doesn’t affect VA benefits related to Camp Lejeune. The law does expand VA health care and benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits and other toxic substances.\n\nLearn more about the PACT Act and your VA benefits\n\nYou (or your legal representative) can start by filing an administrative claim with the Department of the Navy.\n\nYou can follow the Navy’s process to seek an award of relief for your claim. You may also be able to choose the Department of the Navy’s new elective option to get a faster settlement decision directly from the Navy. Or if the Navy denies your claim or you wait longer than 6 months for a decision, you can file a lawsuit in the Eastern District of North Carolina.\n\nLearn how to file for Camp Lejeune relief on the Navy's website\n\nNo. Filing for relief under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022 won’t affect your eligibility for VA disability or health care benefits.\n\nIf the court awards you relief under this law (or if a court awarded relief in the past), this won’t affect the amount of your VA disability payments or your eligibility for VA health care. A settlement through the Department of the Navy’s elective option process also won’t affect your VA benefits or health care in any way.\n\nYes, in some cases. Your benefits may affect your award if both of these descriptions are true:\n\nA court awards you relief as a result of a lawsuit filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, and\n\nYou already get VA benefits or health care related to exposure to water at Camp Lejeune\n\nThe court must reduce (or “offset”) the award by the amount of any related disability award, payment, or benefit we provided to you or your legal representative from a lawsuit. If you choose the elective option claim process, this offset doesn’t apply to you.\n\nVA benefits that aren’t related to exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune won’t affect your award from a lawsuit.\n\nYou can contact the Department of Justice by phone or email:\n\nCall 202-353-4426 (TTY: 711), or\n\nSend an email to camplejeune.pactact@usdoj.gov\n\nNo. You don’t need to hire a lawyer or file a lawsuit to get VA benefits. This includes VA benefits related to Camp Lejeune.\n\nIf you need help filing a claim for VA benefits, you may want to work with a Veterans Service Officer (VSO).\n\nLearn how to get help filing your VA claim\n\nWhat to know about commercials about Camp Lejeune\n\nYou may see or hear commercials for lawyers or law firms who claim they can help you get Camp Lejeune benefits. We don’t have any connection to these commercials or the lawyers or law firms involved.\n\nWe do create public service announcements about VA benefits. We’ll never try to sell you a product or ask you to pay for help getting VA benefits.\n\nIf a law firm or other company says you can’t get VA benefits without their help, this is incorrect. To report suspected fraud, contact us in either of these ways:\n\nCall us at 800-488-8244 (TTY: 711)\n\nEmail us at vaoighotline@va.gov"
