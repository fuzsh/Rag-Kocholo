They care for patients with chronic respiratory disease, such as asthma or emphysema, as well as patients who suffer from heart attacks, sleep apnea, shock or other problems that may affect breathing.\n\nWhat characteristics and skills do I need to work in this field?\n\nSuccess requires individuals to enjoy working with people and be able to think quickly and make decisions in stressful situations. Therefore, being detail oriented and having strong problem-solving skills are important. These professionals should be self-motivated and have good communications skills. It’s also important to be compassionate and sensitive when dealing with patients and their families.\n\nWhere can I work?\n\nRespiratory therapists work with patients (newborn to geriatric) who have acute and chronic lung conditions. As a respiratory therapist you will be able to work in the intensive care unit, in the emergency department, in doctor’s offices, in patients' homes, and even on the flight team.\n\nWhat does Trident Technical College offer?\n\nTrident Technical College’s Respiratory Care program prepares students for employment as advanced-level respiratory care practitioners. The program is accredited, and graduates are eligible to take national certificate and registry exams.\n\nAccreditation\n\nRespiratory care practitioners help in the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of patients with heart, lung or renal problems. The patients may be adults, children, infants or newborns.\n\nThe Respiratory Care program at Trident Technical College is an accredited two-year associate degree program. Graduates from this program are registry-eligible.\n\nThe Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC) accredits respiratory therapy education programs in the United States. To achieve this end, it utilizes an ‘outcomes based’ process. Programmatic outcomes are performance indicators that reflect the extent to which the educational goals of the program are achieved and by which program effectiveness is documented.\n\nThe following sites are not affiliated with TTC but provide helpful information about the respiratory care field:"
