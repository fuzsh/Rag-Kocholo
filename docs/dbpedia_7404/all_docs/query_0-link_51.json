        "text": "Looking for a career with strong future prospects? Think you might be a fit for a career in health care?\n\nIf so, consider respiratory therapy. Just as America's aging population is fueling a strong present and future demand for registered nurses (RNs), the same demographics are forecast to keep the demand for respiratory therapists (RTs) strong. It turns out that certain cardiopulmonary ailments including emphysema and heart disease are more common in older people.\n\nWhat's more, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, better known as COPD, has been on the rise in recent years. Already the fourth leading cause of death in the United States, \"COPD is on its way to becoming the nation's third leading cause of death,\" according to Bill Dubbs, director of education and management services for the American Association of Respiratory Care (AARC) headquartered in Irving, Texas.\n\nAdding to these sources of future demand are the retirements of many baby boomer respiratory therapists (RTs) currently in the workforce expected to retire in the next 10-15 years. Those leaving the field will need to be replaced by other RTs entering the field in the next decade.\n\nThat's one reason AARC has stepped up its outreach to high school students and career changers in hopes of attracting them to respiratory care by highlighting the field's opportunities and rewards ---both tangible and intangible.\n\nAsked about the intangible rewards of the profession, AARC President Karen Stewart focused on the ability RTs have to make a difference in their patients' lives. Noting that \"the patients are all ages,\" Stewart noted how proud RTs are of their profession when \"they see a patient who was having difficulty breathing get better and walk out of the door.\"\n\nTim Myers, immediate past president of AARC, also considers RTs' ability to know they've made a difference for patients rewarding. He also views the diverse career options within respiratory therapy as an intangible reward. \"RTs can provide generalized care for a diverse group of patients,\" he said, \"or they can choose to work in various specialties including adult acute care, the care of newborns and children, diagnostics, pulmonary rehab, education or long term care.\"\n\nRT s also have the flexibility of working in different health care venues. According to Dubbs, although the vast majority of RTs in the United States are employed by hospitals, a growing number are also working in doctors' offices and outpatient clinics.\n\nBeyond the intangibles, respiratory therapy offers some very tangible rewards, which include rising salaries. Prior to the onset of what's been dubbed \"The Great Recession,\" AARC's 2005 Human Resources survey indicated a 38% average increase in RT salaries during the 2000-2005 time period. AARC's 2009 Human Resources survey revealed higher average salaries from 2006 to 2008 as well.\n\nAlthough Dubbs said the economic contraction of the last three years has slowed the pace of RT hiring and higher earning potential as U.S. hospitals have tightened their belts, he expects RT hiring to pick up when the economy is fully recovered. Dubbs also believes implementation of the Affordable (Health) Care Act passed in 2010 will fuel the need for --- and hiring of --- more RTs.\n\n\"The millions of additional Americans having access to care as a result of the legislation will inevitably boost the demand for various health care services including those provided by respiratory therapists (RTs),\" he said.\n\nIf you're wondering what's entailed in preparing for a career in respiratory care, AARC's Website indicates someone can enter the field by obtaining a two-year associate degree or four-year baccalaureate degree in respiratory care, then passing a national RT exam. For a list of schools in the U.S. offering accredited RT programs, log on to AARC's Website: www.aarc.org.\n\nBeyond the formal education required, Dubbs said a desire to acquire new knowledge and skills is among the traits needed to be a successful RT. Naturally, one needs to be comfortable having direct patient contact, too."
