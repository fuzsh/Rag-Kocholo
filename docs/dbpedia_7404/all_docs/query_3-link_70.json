Their patients range from premature infants with undeveloped lungs to older adults whose lungs are diseased.\n\nDuties\n\nRespiratory therapists typically do the following:\n\nInterview and examine patients with breathing or cardiopulmonary disorders\n\nConsult with physicians about patients’ conditions and developing treatment plans\n\nPerform diagnostic tests\n\nTreat patients using a variety of methods\n\nMonitor and record patients’ progress\n\nTeach patients how to take medications and use equipment\n\nRespiratory therapists work closely with registered nurses, physicians and surgeons, and medical assistants. They use various tests to evaluate patients. For example, respiratory therapists administer pulmonary function tests to assess lung capacity by having patients breathe into an instrument that measures the volume and flow of oxygen when they inhale and exhale. Therapists also may take blood samples and use a blood gas analyzer to test oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.\n\nRespiratory therapists also perform treatment to clear airways for improved breathing. For example, therapists may do chest physiotherapy to remove mucus from the lungs by tapping the patient’s chest and encouraging him or her to cough.\n\nRespiratory therapists in emergency settings may connect patients who cannot breathe on their own to ventilators that deliver oxygen to the lungs. They set up and monitor the equipment to ensure that the patient is receiving the correct amount of oxygen at the correct rate.\n\nRespiratory therapists who work in home care teach patients and their families to use ventilators and other life-support systems. During these visits, they may inspect and clean equipment, check the home for environmental hazards, and ensure that patients know how to use their medications. Therapists also make emergency home visits when necessary.\n\nIn some medical facilities, respiratory therapists are involved in related areas, such as diagnosing breathing problems for people with sleep apnea and counseling people on how to stop smoking.\n\nWork Environment About this section\n\nRespiratory therapists held about 133,900 jobs in 2023. The largest employers of respiratory therapists were as follows:\n\nHospitals; state, local, and private 82% Nursing care facilities (skilled nursing facilities) 4 Offices of physicians 2\n\nRespiratory therapists work in various areas of a hospital, including emergency rooms, critical care units, and neonatal intensive care units.\n\nRespiratory therapists may stand for long periods and may need to lift or turn patients.\n\nInjuries and Illnesses\n\nLike other healthcare workers, respiratory therapists may be exposed to patients who have infectious diseases. They also may experience strains or sprains when lifting or turning patients. Because of this, they must take precautions to minimize their risk of illness or injury.\n\nWork Schedules\n\nMost respiratory therapists work full time. Because they may work in medical facilities that are always open, such as hospitals, they may have shifts that include nights, weekends, or holidays.\n\nHow to Become a Respiratory Therapist About this section\n\nRespiratory therapists typically need an associate’s degree in respiratory therapy. Some employers prefer to hire candidates who have a bachelor’s degree. Respiratory therapists must be licensed in all states except Alaska; requirements vary by state.\n\nEducation\n\nRespiratory therapists typically need at least an associate’s degree in respiratory therapy from a program approved by the American Medical Association, such as those accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (CoARC). Employers may prefer that applicants have a bachelor’s degree.\n\nSome programs require applicants to fulfill prerequisites. High school students interested in applying to respiratory therapy programs should take courses in biology, algebra, chemistry, and physics.\n\nIn addition to respiratory therapy programs offered by colleges and vocational–technical institutes, a CoARC-accredited program in the Armed Forces leads to an associate’s degree.\n\nRespiratory therapy programs typically include courses in human anatomy and physiology, and therapeutic and diagnostic procedures and tests. These programs also have clinical components that allow students to gain supervised, practical experience in treating patients.\n\nLicenses, Certifications, and Registrations\n\nRespiratory therapists are required to be licensed in all states except Alaska, where national certification is recommended. Licensure requirements vary but usually include passing a state or professional certification exam. For specific requirements, contact a state’s health board.\n\nThe National Board for Respiratory Care (NBRC) is the main certifying body for respiratory therapists. The Board offers two levels of certification: Certified Respiratory Therapist (CRT) and Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT). Candidates typically sit for the CRT exam. After successful completion, CRTs may take an additional exam to earn RRT certification. Some employers require that candidates earn RRT certification before being hired or within a specified amount of time on the job.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nCompassion. Respiratory therapists should be able to provide emotional support to patients undergoing treatment. They must be sympathetic to a patient’s needs.\n\nDetail oriented. Respiratory therapists must stay focused to ensure that a patient receives appropriate treatments and medications. They must be meticulous about monitoring patients and recording information related to their care.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Respiratory therapists interact and build relationships with patients. They often work as part of a team and must be able to take direction from others, such as a supervising physician.\n\nPatience. Respiratory therapists may work for long periods with patients who need special attention.\n\nProblem-solving skills. Respiratory therapists must evaluate patients’ symptoms, consult with other healthcare professionals, and recommend and administer the appropriate treatments.\n\nPay About this section\n\nRespiratory Therapists\n\nMedian annual wages, May 2023\n\nHealthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners\n\n$98,760\n\nRespiratory therapists\n\n$77,960\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$48,060\n\nThe median annual wage for respiratory therapists was $77,960 in May 2023. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $59,180, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $104,480.\n\nIn May 2023, the median annual wages for respiratory therapists in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:\n\nHospitals; state, local, and private $78,300 Offices of physicians 77,580 Nursing care facilities (skilled nursing facilities) 73,390\n\nMost respiratory therapists work full time. Because they may work in medical facilities that are always open, such as hospitals, they may have shifts that include nights, weekends, or holidays.\n\nJob Outlook About this section\n\nRespiratory Therapists\n\nPercent change in employment, projected 2023-33\n\nRespiratory therapists\n\n13%\n\nHealthcare diagnosing or treating practitioners\n\n9%\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n4%\n\nEmployment of respiratory therapists is projected to grow 13 percent from 2023 to 2033, much faster than the average for all occupations.\n\nAbout 8,200 openings for respiratory therapists are projected each year, on average, over the decade. Many of those openings are expected to result from the need to replace workers who transfer to different occupations or exit the labor force, such as to retire.\n\nEmployment\n\nGrowth in the older adult population will lead to an increased prevalence of respiratory conditions such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and other disorders that restrict lung function. This, in turn, will lead to increased demand for respiratory therapy services and treatments, mostly in hospitals.\n\nIn addition, a growing emphasis on reducing readmissions to hospitals and on providing patient care in outpatient facilities may result in more demand for respiratory therapists in health clinics and in doctors’ offices.\n\nOther respiratory conditions that affect people of all ages, such as problems due to smoking and air pollution or those arising from emergencies, will continue to create demand for respiratory therapists.\n\nEmployment projections data for respiratory therapists, 2023-33 Occupational Title SOC Code Employment, 2023 Projected Employment, 2033 Change, 2023-33 Employment by Industry Percent Numeric\n\nRespiratory therapists\n\n29-1126 133,900 151,400 13 17,500 Get data\n\nState & Area Data About this section\n\nOccupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS)\n\nThe Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) program produces employment and wage estimates annually for over 800 occupations.
