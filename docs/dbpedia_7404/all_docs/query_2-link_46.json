        "text": "Respiratory Therapy is the allied health profession that cares for patients with deficiencies and abnormalities of the cardiopulmonary system. The Respiratory Therapist sees a diverse group of patients, ranging from newborns to the elderly. Disease states or conditions often requiring respiratory care include asthma, emphysema, COPD, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, infant and adult respiratory distress syndrome, and conditions brought on by shock, trauma, and post-operative surgical complications.\n\nServices that are provided by Respiratory:\n\nManagement - Care for acute, trauma, neonate and skilled patients\n\nPulmonary Function Testing - Aids in the diagnosis and evaluation of lung problems, assess the effect of medication and measures the progress in disease treatment.\n\nArterial Blood Gas Testing - Blood test performed using blood from an artery. This test is used to check how well your lungs are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide from the blood.\n\nSleep Studies\n\nEEGs\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nAmerican Lung Association\n\nCOPD Advocate\n\nEmphysema Foundation for Our Right to Survive (EFFORTS)\n\nLiving with COPD\n\nPulmonary Rehabilitation works with groups of men and women, all who are suffering from some form of chronic lung disease. The Rehab team will work not only with each individual person but also as a group. Their goal is to increase your knowledge of your disease and improve your lung capacity to its fullest potential.\n\nPulmonary Rehab combines exercise training, behavioral and educational programs. This design is to help patients control symptoms and improve day-to-day activities. We have a team approach - patients work with their doctor, nurses, respiratory staff, physical and occupational therapist, pharmacist, dietitians, and social workers.\n\nPulmonary Rehabilitation has been used primarily for patients with COPD. However, patients with the following conditions will also benefit from this program:\n\nAsthma\n\nInterstitial disease\n\nPulmonary fibrosis\n\nCystic fibrosis\n\nBronchiectasis\n\nThoracic cage abnormalities\n\nNeuromuscular disorders\n\nLung transplant\n\nEmphysema\n\nWhether you have a chronic respiratory system disease or are experiencing disabling symptoms, such as shortness of breath, cough, and/or mucus production, pulmonary rehabilitation can help. Our Pulmonary Rehab program is individually tailored and designed to optimize physical and social wellbeing and can help patients:\n\nBecome physically stronger\n\nQuit smoking\n\nLearn about their lungs\n\nIncrease exercise tolerance\n\nDecrease shortness of breath\n\nCope with feelings of fear or apprehension\n\nExercise for life\n\nImprove breathing techniques\n\nUnderstand the medication they take\n\nBe better able to perform activities of daily living\n\nTo get started with Pulmonary Rehab you will need to talk to your doctor.\n\nSleep, a vital component to good health, makes up approximately one third of our lives.\n\nA good night of sleep is essential to the restoration of our mind and body each and every day. More than 70 million Americans suffer from one or more sleep disorders, some of which can be fatal. Astonishingly, it is estimated that 95% of these cases go undiagnosed and untreated. For these victims the night is a source of anguish, not rest. Untreated sleep disorders can have serious consequences. There are more than 80 sleep/wake disorders resulting in daytime sleepiness due to an inability to either fall asleep or maintain restful sleep. These disorders result in a significant number of health problems, traffic accidents, industrial accidents, heart failures and deaths.\n\nProper diagnosis is the essential first step in the successful treatment of sleep disorders. A polysomnogram (PSG), or sleep study, is the most accurate and objective method for evaluating sleep and establishing a diagnosis. A sleep study is a non-invasive recording of sleep patterns that monitors activities of the heart, brain, muscle movement, airflow, and oxygen levels in the blood.\n\nIf you can relate to any of the symptoms below you should schedule an appointment with your primary care physician to discuss your options and see if a sleep study is what you need.\n\nIf a sleep study is ordered, you can have your study done here in Seward at Memorial Health Care Systems. Our sleep lab rooms are private, cool, dark and quiet. They are stocked with comforts you would have at home and are complete with private bathrooms and furnished with a Sleep Number bed to facilitate a peaceful and restful night's sleep during your sleep study.\n\nSleep disorders may include:\n\nSleep Apnea\n\nInsomnia\n\nNarcolepsy\n\nRestless Leg Syndrome\n\nParasomnias\n\nCircadian Rhythm Disruption"
