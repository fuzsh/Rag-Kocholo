        "text": "The American Association of Respiratory Care (AARC) has designated Dell Seton Medical Center at The University of Texas at Austin as an Apex facility. Dell Seton is the first hospital within Ascension to receive this prestigious designation.\n\n“We are beyond thrilled with this recognition,” Jessica Bartek, RRT, BSRC, Clinical Manager of Respiratory Care at Dell Seton, said. “We are so proud of the entire respiratory care team here at Dell Seton.”\n\nThe Apex Recognition Program recognizes the important contributions of respiratory therapists (RT) and highlights best practices in respiratory care that are aligned with evidence-based medicine. In order to receive the Apex designation, Dell Seton had to meet all 14 Standards of Excellence in Respiratory Care, which include formal education requirements for Respiratory Care Practitioners (RCPs), an evidence-based RT-driven protocol program, initial and ongoing competency requirements, process improvement and policy oversight requirements, professional development opportunities, and quality improvement initiatives that are led by RCPs."
