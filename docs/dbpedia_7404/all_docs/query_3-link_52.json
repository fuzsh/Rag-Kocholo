They collaborate with a team of experts including pulmonologists and cardiologists, surgeons, physical and occupational therapists, and specialists from a variety of other fields. They provide vital information and input that enables the team to provide the best care. Respiratory therapists support a variety of departments, using their skills in their unique specialty within a broad spectrum of practice areas.\n\nA Meaningful Career\n\nBreath is life. When people have trouble breathing, it’s hard to do almost anything else. Respiratory therapists play a critical part in helping patients improve their health and wellness by increasing their lung function and helping them to breathe easier.\n\nA deep focus on patient- and family-centered care is integral to the way we practice. We treat our patients with respect and commitment, involving their families in their care conversations. It can be extremely rewarding to improve the quality of life of your patients.\n\n“We operate the ventilators you’ve been hearing so much about. We make an impact on someone else’s life, one breath at a time. Our team is like a family, committed to each other and to helping our patients.”\n\n—Maria D.\n\nRespiratory Therapy Roles and Opportunities\n\nRespiratory therapists can play many roles in a patient’s care:\n\nDiagnostics. Respiratory therapists administer pulmonary function tests to determine how easily air moves in and out of the lungs and how much oxygen moves from the lung to the blood. We also perform blood tests to measure oxygen, carbon dioxide and pH levels to help diagnose respiratory conditions.\n\nTherapeutics. Respiratory therapists provide medication, perform therapeutic procedures and use sophisticated equipment to monitor and treat patients.\n\nEducation. A respiratory therapist’s job includes educating patients and their families about their conditions or diseases. They explain what the specific conditions are and preventive and cautionary actions to take to improve a patient’s health, or to prevent certain conditions from worsening. For example, a respiratory therapist could teach disease management techniques to patients with chronic diseases like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nGain Experience in a Variety of Practice Areas\n\nRespiratory therapists don’t just work in pulmonary or cardiopulmonary areas. They support patients in a variety of areas of the hospital including:\n\nEmergency Department\n\nCritical Care\n\nMaternity\n\nNeonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)\n\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU)\n\nBurn Unit\n\nUse State-of-the-Art Technology and Learn the Latest Techniques\n\nWith the resources of the largest academic health system in New Jersey, respiratory therapists at RWJBarnabas Health facilities have access to the most sophisticated tools in their profession.

It can be an interesting path if you choose to take it.”\n\n—Rob S.\n\nResearch\n\nAn important benefit of working in a large academic health care system is the opportunity to participate in research that advances the science of respiratory therapy and pulmonary care.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Respiratory Therapy in New Jersey\n\nWhat is respiratory therapy?\n\nRespiration, or breathing, is a core function of the human body. When breathing becomes irregular – too slow or too fast – the way the body processes energy is disrupted. Organs like the heart and the lung stop working the way they are supposed to. That can have serious and even fatal consequences.\n\nA respiratory therapist administers tests to help establish a diagnosis, monitors patients’ breathing, operates ventilation machines and provides therapies to improve air flow. They also educate patients and their families on the conditions and how to manage their diseases.\n\nWhat skills do I need to be a respiratory therapist?\n\nRespiratory therapists should be detail-oriented, focused and able to communicate well with all levels of medical staff, doctors, patients and their families. An affinity for science is important. Curiosity, creativity, and the ability to think on your feet are also characteristics of many respiratory therapists.\n\nWhat kind of training is involved to become a respiratory therapist in New Jersey?\n\nTo become a respiratory therapist, you must have a high school diploma and basic prerequisites in the science fields. You’ll need a degree from 2-year or 4-year program and you’ll need to take the Boards administered by the National Board for Respiratory Care to become a registered respiratory therapist and obtain a license practice in the state of New Jersey.\n\nWhat schools in New Jersey offer a degree in respiratory therapy?\n\nThere are four respiratory care training programs in New Jersey. They are:\n\nBergen Community College\n\nBrookdale Community College\n\nCounty College of Morris\n\nUnion College\n\nResources for Students/Career Changers\n\nAmerican Association for Respiratory Care\n\nAmerican College of Medical Careers\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics/Occupational Outlook Handbook\n\nExplore Health Careers\n\nNational Board of Respiratory Care\n\nIf you are thinking of moving from out of state, visit the New Jersey Board of Respiratory Care."
