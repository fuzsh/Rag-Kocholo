        "text": "Background: Research is critical for the advancement of respiratory care. Fellows of the American Association for Respiratory Care (FAARCs) are nominated based on their significant contributions to the respiratory care profession. Research output is potentially an important component of qualification for FAARC. The purpose of this study is to report the academic output of respiratory therapist (RT) FAARCs.\n\nMethods: We identified FAARCs from the AARC web site. Research output was assessed by searching the Scopus and PubMed databases. We collected total research documents, citations, h-index, co-authors, and document type. We compared those with only the FAARC designation with RTs who are fellows in both the Society of Critical Care Medicine (FCCMs) and FAARC.\n\nResults: We identified a total of 371 RT FAARCs, 4 RT FCCMs, and 10 with both designations. FAARCs were 70% male, 22% had a doctorate, 37% had a master's, 13% had a bachelor's, and 29% did not have a degree reported. There were no differences in sex or highest degree between FAARCs and FCCMs. FAARCs had a total of 3,724 publications and 110,207 citations while those with both designations had 1,304 publications and 43,181 citations. In Scopus, 46% of FAARCs had no publications, and 27% had ≥ 10 publications; of those with both credentials, 10% had no publications, and 70% had ≥ 10 publications. FAARCs inducted in 1998 and 1999 had significantly (P < .001) more publications than other eras. Compared to those with both credentials, FAARCs had fewer median publications (1 vs 50), lower h-index (1 vs 18), and fewer citations (1 vs 1,486), P < .001 for all. Total publications in PubMed were lower, and differences in publications were similar."
