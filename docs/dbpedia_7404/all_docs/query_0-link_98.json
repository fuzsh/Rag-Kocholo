        "text": "Denise Chreene\n\nRegistered Respiratory Therapist and Certified Risk Manager\n\nIn 2003, I was approached by one of the members of the board for Kidd’s Kids. He asked me if I would consider joining the medical team…and so began my journey. I never imagined how my life would change. I knew it would be a challenge for me emotionally and physically, however it was a calling that was greater than any of my personal challenges. Just to see the smiles on the kids, siblings and parents’ faces is something I look forward to every year. I am always amazed at how fast life-long bonds are made between the families. When you see a kid in a wheelchair or without arms or legs it is only human nature to look or feel empathy for them and their parents. However, when you get to see them play with each other by racing their wheelchairs down Main Street in Magic Kingdom you realize that they are not kids in wheelchairs…they are just kids having fun with their friends. Our week is filled with chicken fingers and French fries, hugs, a lot of laughter and a few tears. For five very short days we have the honor of entering the lives of families and take them to a place where they can all be kids.\n\nZane Krempin\n\nDallas Firefighter/Paramedic\n\nThis is Zane! He is a Dallas Firefighter/Paramedic, and has been serving on the medical staff with Kidd’s Kids since 2013. He loves how the trip allows the kids and their families to have some true excitement and fun, along with making memories, without stressing about what might go wrong or who will be able to assist them with their child’s needs.\n\nWe asked him about one of his favorite memories and this is what he shared: “About three years ago I tried to help an incredible young man named Memphis board the plane in Dallas. As I went to pick him up he said, ‘Mr. Zane I don’t need your help, I got this.’ He climbed down out of his wheelchair and proceeded up the stairs to board the plane on his own. Memphis is a quadruple amputee and one of the toughest kids I have ever met. His physical limitations do not limit his ability to fully live. To this day I am completely humbled by his grit and courage.”\n\nKerry Baker\n\nRespiratory Therapist\n\nHi everyone!! My name is Kerry Baker and I’m a Respiratory Therapist at Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth. I have been so blessed to be a part of the medical staff for Kidd’s Kids since 2006. I absolutely LOVE spending time with all of the families and helping each and every family have the most magical trip ever!! It’s absolutely priceless watching a child’s face light up when they see their favorite Disney character for the first time. I’m so grateful to be a part of an amazing organization that allows these kids and their families to have a completely stress free vacation for a week.\n\nTonya Sosebee\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nI’ve been a nurse for 27 years with 20 years of pediatric nursing experience. I’m currently in hospital administration. I’ve been blessed to be part of this organization since 1998, missing a couple of trips during that time. I LOVE being able to support the Kidd’s Kids and their families during such an amazing trip that allows the Kidd’s Kids and their families to “just breathe” and enjoy family time without worrying about “what if…”. Volunteering with Kidd’s Kids reminds me of why I became a nurse and fulfills me. The trip allows me to channel my inner self and have fun! Disney World is truly one of my “happy places.” My favorite park is Magic Kingdom for many reasons….Cinderella’s Castle, fabulous parades, caramel apples from The Confectionary, fireworks, and my favorite ride, Splash Mountain!\n\nLisa Jones\n\nMusic Therapist and Grief Counselor\n\nLisa Jones, MA, GC-C, MT-BC, has been a board-certified music therapist and certified grief counselor at Children’s Health for the past 22 years. Lisa’s first Kidd’s Kids trip was in 2009, and she has cherished the beautiful memories and relationships she has created with the medical staff and wonderful kids and parents she has met while attending the trips. Lisa is honored to volunteer for Kidd’s Kids and draws so much joy from seeing the smiling faces and pure joy displayed by the Kidd’s Kids and their family members as they experience the Disney Magic.\n\nCinda McDonald\n\nChild Life Specialist\n\nMy name is Cinda McDonald and I am a palliative care child life specialist with Baylor Scott & White Health. I’ve been a volunteer with the Kidd’s Kids medical staff since 2002. I volunteer with Kidd’s Kids because I believe it their mission of giving children who endure serious health challenges and their families, the opportunity to suspend their reality and truly become a part of the magic of Disney. I cherish the memories from every trip. Being with the families and watching their faces as they experience the sights and sounds of the most magical place on earth is priceless. I’m so lucky to be a part of the trip and love being a part of this amazing organization.\n\nDr. Dan Guzman\n\nPediatric ER Physician\n\nMy name is Daniel Guzman aka Dr. Dan and I have been a part of Kidd’s Kids since 2006. I am a pediatric emergency medicine physician and have worked at Cook Children’s Medical Center in Fort Worth for the last 17 years. Working in the emergency department can be very challenging and I often see kids and their families in the most challenging of times. What I love about Kidd’s Kids is being able to provide families with an adventure like no other and in a way that only Kidd’s Kids can do! Every year I thrive on providing families with some degree of serenity and confidence that every medical need will be taken care making those moments – PRICELESS! Every trip is filled with amazing one of kind memories that is truly difficult to describe. Each year is special and I wouldn’t change anything about the last 15 years and I look forward to meeting more amazing families!\n\nDr. Jay Pond\n\nOrthopedic Surgeon\n\nI began serving on the selection committee around 2003, and I also served on the Kidd’s Kids board of directors for about eight years. I stay involved with Kidd’s Kids to be able to continue to help these kids and give at least a few the opportunity of a lifetime, and to be able to honor the legacy and memory of my friend, Dave ‘Kidd’ Kraddick. Each year I look forward to the sendoff and meeting all the families!\n\nEvan Sosebee\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nMy name is Evan Sosebee, I am a registered nurse in Dallas, Texas. I currently work in a Neuroscience/Neuro-Trauma ICU in Dallas. In 2017 I began volunteering for the Kidd’s Kids trips, and I look forward to them all year long! There is nothing like the excitement on these kiddos faces from the first day all the way until the home bound plane lands. I am thankful for the opportunity to get to love on these kids and give them a trip that they might not normally get to experience. My favorite part of the trip is always the firework show and dessert party! Another great part of this trip is that my mom (Tonya Sosebee) is also on the medical staff with me. The medical staff on this trip is the best of the best and I am very blessed to be part of the team.\n\nNatalie Carpenter\n\nRegistered Nurse\n\nI am a Registered Nurse and currently work as the Director of Emergency Services for Cook Children’s Medical Center. I have been involved with Kidd’s Kids since 2018, and it is such a blessing to be able to provide medical care for children. The Kidd’s Kids trip allows children and their families to have some true excitement and fun along with making life-long memories without the worrying or stress about what might go wrong and who will be able to assist them with their child’s needs. My favorite part of the trip is seeing the smiles and look of excitement on the kids’ faces during the fireworks show!\n\nMichelle Dozier\n\nNurse Manager\n\nI am a nurse manager at Cook Children’s Medical Center, and I have been involved with Kidd’s Kids since 2008. I love it when you finally see the parents relax and have fun. It’s amazing when you see the kids (and the parents) challenge themselves to get on a ride they didn’t think they could do. When they realize that we wouldn’t let them go on something that would hurt them but would be fun – when they get off those rides and you hear the laughter and see the smiles – that’s the best. One year, I rode the Tower of Terror 8 times in a row. Each time we rode it, our group kept getting bigger and bigger. The last time, it was me, a dad, and all kids and we filled up a car. So fun!\n\nDenise Chreene\n\nRegistered Respiratory Therapist and Certified Risk Manager\n\nIn 2003, I was approached by one of the members of the board for Kidd’s Kids.
