There is also some type of mandatory regulation in all 48 continental states.\n\nAfter the graduate passes the TMC exam at the high level, they become eligible to take the Clinical Simulation Exam.\n\nTo become a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) two computerized tests must be taken and passed. The first is the 140-question TMC exam, and the second is the 20-problem clinical simulation exam.\n\nThe NBRC also has a certification (Certified Pulmonary Function Technician – CPFT) and a registry (Registered Pulmonary Function Technologist – RPFT) for pulmonary function testing. There is also a test to become a Neonatal/Pediatric Respiratory Care Specialist (NPS), a Sleep Disorders Specialist (SDS), and one for the Adult Critical Care Specialist (ACCS)."
