Within this field, you are tasked with important responsibilities, such as providing and managing therapeutic and life support services, administration of gasses and aerosol therapy, and cardiopulmonary assessment and monitoring.\n\nOur Respiratory Care program is a two-year curriculum that includes one semester (15 credit hours) of prerequisite courses and four semesters (51 credit hours) of didactic, laboratory, and clinical classes that prepare the student for a career as a Respiratory Therapist.
