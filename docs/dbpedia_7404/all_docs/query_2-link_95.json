        "text": "Basic Life Support (BLS) from the American Red Cross is designed for healthcare providers and public safety professionals and meets a variety of certification and licensing requirements.\n\nOur BLS curriculum includes all standard scientific learning objectives necessary in professional resuscitation courses, but also allows students to develop their critical thinking, teamwork, and clinical decision-making skills, and work on reflection and debriefing, which serves to strengthen their overall learning and work experience. In addition, our courses are modular and flexible, and offer medical directors, educators and Red Cross training partners the ability to tailor courses to their local protocols, and their students' specific needs.\n\nWays to Train\n\nIn-Person Classes: Designed for those who learn best in a traditional classroom setting, class participants attend lecture and skills sessions with other students in a designated physical location.\n\nBlended Learning: Created for those who need additional flexibility, our blended learning courses combine online presentations of \"lecture\" materials, with interactive scenarios that help improve clinical decision-making skills, and in-person skills sessions. Coursework is self-paced, can be personalized with our adaptive learning pre-assessments, and modular, so you can train on your schedule.\n\nNote: The American Red Cross Basic Life Support (BLS) course is designed to train healthcare professionals including nurses, physicians, EMS professionals, CNAs, and other healthcare and public safety personnel to respond to breathing and cardiac emergencies in adults, children and infants.
