Graduates have the skills to perform diagnostic activities such as obtaining and interpreting physiologic specimens, initiating and managing life-support equipment, and initiating devices that treat sleep disorders. Respiratory Therapists administer basic and advanced therapeutics which include the administration of pharmacologic agents, the application and monitoring of medical gases, the insertion and management of artificial airways, and cardiopulmonary rehabilitation. Respiratory Therapists conduct patient/family education that promotes knowledge of disease processes, respiratory therapeutics, and self-care, as well as public education activities that focus on the promotion of cardiopulmonary health.\n\nProgram Goal\n\nTo prepare graduates with demonstrated competence in the cognitive (knowledge), psychomotor (skills), and affective (behavior) learning domains of respiratory care practice as performed by registered respiratory care practitioners.\n\nAccreditation Status\n\nThe Texas Southern University, baccalaureate degree-granting program, located on the main campus at 3100 Cleburne Street, Houston, Texas 77004 is accredited through 2025 by the Commission on Accreditation for Respiratory Care (www.coarc.com). CoARC accredits respiratory therapy education programs in the United States. To achieve this end, it utilizes an outcomes-based process. Programmatic outcomes are performance indicators that reflect the extent to which the educational goals of the program are achieved and by which program effectiveness is documented. The Program number is 200208.\n\nThe Program’s outcomes can be found on CoARC’s outcomes webpage here: https://coarc.com/students/programmatic-outcomes-data/\n\nAdmission Requirements\n\nThe minimum grade point average (GPA) for Respiratory Therapy applicants is 2.65.

Students will be responsible for the associated fees for the aforementioned background checks and screenings. Students should understand that program faculty cannot guarantee clinical rotation privileges for any student who is admitted to the RT program and has a subsequent Background Check and/or Drug Screen that is incongruent with the standards of the program’s clinical affiliates.\n\nVaccination Policy\n\nProfessional RT students are required to have the following vaccinations and/or lab tests upon admission and before the first day of class:\n\nMeasles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR)\n\nTetanus and Diphtheria (Tdap) Vaccination\n\nVaricella (Chicken Pox) History\n\nHepatitis B Vaccination\n\nTuberculosis Skin Tests (PPD)\n\nFlu Shot\n\nCOVID-19\n\nAdvanced Standing\n\nAdvanced Standing in the Respiratory Therapy Program is for Respiratory Therapy professionals that have already completed professional RT education in an accredited RT program.

The first of these exams, the Therapist Multiple Choice Examination (TMC), is a written test that students take at the end of their junior year, spring semester. After passing all junior-level courses, students must demonstrate competence by passing this examination minimally at the certification level in order to qualify for HSRT 454: Critical Care & Internship. Students who pass the TMC at the higher level, the registry level, on the first attempt will not be required to repeat this examination. Students who do not pass minimally at the certification level on their first attempt will not be allowed to enter internship and must enroll in the review course, HSRT 420 Comprehensive Review in Respiratory Therapy. Students must pass HSRT 420 in order to be eligible to re-take the TMC exam. Comprehensive/Exit exams are given in May, August, and December.\n\nAfter students complete the didactic and clinical components of HSRT 454 Internship, they must re-take the TMC exam and pass it at the registry level if they have not done so already. Students who do not take and pass this exam at the registry level must enroll in the review course, HSRT 420 Comprehensive Review. Once a student has passed the TMC at the registry level the student must attempt the Clinical Simulation Exam (CSE). The CSE consists of clinical problems that are meant to simulate real clinical practice in Respiratory Care. Current passing scores for the comprehensive exams are as follows:"
