        "text": "The program is designed to provide the working Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) or equivalent credential, who holds a bachelor's degree in any field, the opportunity to complete a Master of Science in Respiratory Care through an online program. The American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) 2005 Human Resources Study reported there was an increase in the number of respiratory therapists with higher degrees.\n\nEarning a Master of Science in Respiratory Care may open doors to opportunities to assume positions to teach respiratory therapy in an academic or higher education setting, management, or leadership position within a healthcare organization, or in a research area to provide improvements in cardiopulmonary techniques. The degree completion program will provide the opportunity to develop the knowledge, leadership skills, and interpersonal skills that will enable them to improve the health care system."
