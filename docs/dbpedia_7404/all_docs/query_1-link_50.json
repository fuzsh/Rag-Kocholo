        "text": "Senate Bill 202 transferred four occupational regulatory programs from the Department of State Health Services (DSHS) to the Texas Medical Board (TMB). Medical Physicists, Medical Radiologic Technologists, Perfusionists, and Respiratory Care Practitioners are now regulated by the TMB and each occupation’s respective board/advisory committee.\n\nOnline JP Exam & Study Guide\n\nPlease know all Respiratory Care Practitioner, Medical Radiologic Technologist, Limited Medical Radiologic Technologist, and Non-Certified Radiologic Technician applicants who apply after August 31, 2019, will also now be required to successfully pass the Jurisprudence (JP) exam.\n\nThe JP exam is available for applicants with active, pending applications to take online through their My TMB account. Visit the online JP Exam page for more information: http://www.tmb.state.tx.us/page/licensing-jp-exam\n\nIf you need to verify your existing active permit, you can do so on our website HERE.\n\nIf you have an active permit, or if you have a permit that has been expired for less than one year, you do not need to apply for a new one.\n\nPlease note – this does not apply to temp permits – to move from a temp permit to a full, you will need to submit a new application.\n\nYou can find information regarding the Registration/Renewal process HERE.\n\nBefore You Apply\n\nPlease note that Texas has a two-step application process – pre-licensure and licensure.\n\nPre-Licensure (Screening)\n\nDuring pre-licensure, the applicant’s documents are collected based on the standard requirements for certification and how the applicant has responded to the application questions. Please note documents are not reviewed for content during the pre-licensure stage and additional information may be required once an application has been moved to licensure.\n\nIt is the applicant’s responsibility to follow all instructions carefully and submit the required information. Failure to submit documentation correctly during the pre-licensure stage may result in the applicant having to resubmit documents in the correct format once their file reaches licensure.\n\nLicensure\n\nOnly after the initial documents have been received will your application be forwarded to the licensure step for processing. During licensure, a licensure analyst will review and verify all the information contained in the application and the supporting documentation. Additional information may be required based on the review of your application and documentation.\n\nIndividual application processing time will vary based on the complexity of the application. The processing time clock begins when the applicant has submitted all initial documents and has moved to the licensure stage. Factors that increase the processing time are answering “yes” to any of the Professionalism questions on the application and failing to follow instructions when submitting documentation. However, failing to answer application questions truthfully may be considered falsification of your application, will increase the processing time of your application, and could result in punitive action by the Board.\n\nPrior to applying please review the RCP Documentation Checklist & Eligibility Requirements for an overview of the required documentation and potential eligibility issues.\n\nLicense Application Messaging and Status (LAMAS)\n\nAfter submitting their application online, RCP applicants will be contacted via e-mail regarding supplemental documentation requirements and how to log into the LAMAS system which is accessed through MyTMB.\n\nThe LAMAS system allows applicants the ability to submit required documents and review the status of their application in real-time. LAMAS is also mobile-compatible so applicants can capture and submit document images from their smart devices.\n\nMany of the required documents can be submitted via LAMAS with the exception of items that are required to be submitted by a third-party like DPS/FBI fingerprint results, transcripts, etc. LAMAS will display updates as third-party documents are received. Third parties can send information to the Board using the US Postal Service, a private overnight delivery service, or fax if indicated in the instructions.\n\nApply Online – Respiratory Care Practitioners\n\nOnce an applicant has submitted the application online, they will be contacted by e-mail regarding supplemental documentation requirements. It is imperative applicants provide a valid e-mail address on the application in order to receive timely notifications from the TMB. Applicants who do not provide a valid e-mail address will be contacted by letter through the US Postal Service.\n\nDepending on the answers, some of the questions on the application will require applicants to download a supplemental form and submit it. Additional documentation will also be required from third parties. Most third party information must be submitted directly to the TMB. Please read all instructions carefully. Applicants must also take and pass the Jurisprudence Exam and submit their fingerprints for state and national criminal history background checks.\n\nCommunication with the Board\n\nDue to the high volume of applications being processed by the agency, staff members are unable to meet personally with applicants about their file. Questions or concerns regarding applications should be submitted in writing.\n\nRCP applicants in the pre-licensure stage should submit all questions by email to TMBscreening@tmb.state.tx.us. Inquiries send to this e-mail address are typically responded to within 3 business days.\n\nIf an application has advanced to the licensure stage the applicant should send inquiries directly to the licensure analyst via their individual e-mail. Once an application has been assigned to an analyst please allow up to 15 business days for them to complete the initial documentation review. An applicant will be contacted by e-mail regarding once the initial review has been completed."
