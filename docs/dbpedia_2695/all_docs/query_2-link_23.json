        "text": "You may have seen many Blue Plaques where you live, or out and about on your travels. Wikipedia explains what they are:\n\nA blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place in the United Kingdom and elsewhere to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person, event, or former building on the site, serving as a historical marker. The term is used in the United Kingdom in two different senses. It may be used narrowly and specifically to refer to the \"official\" scheme administered by English Heritage, and currently restricted to sites within Greater London; or it may be used less formally to encompass a number of similar schemes administered by organisations throughout the UK.\n\nThere are many in my home town, and in towns close by, that I will be showing you and telling you more about in future videos. Please do make sure you have subscribed to my YouTube Channel. The plaques are a really good way to quickly learn about a person who lived in the building or about the building itself.\n\nThe official Blue Plaque scheme was launched in London in 1866 to mark the homes and workplaces of famous people. The official scheme is for London, however, many towns have copied the scheme and placed Blue Plaques on interesting buildings so that a passerby can learn more and appreciate the history.\n\nDo you have any favourite Blue Plaques? Please leave a comment and let me know.\n\nRoland"
