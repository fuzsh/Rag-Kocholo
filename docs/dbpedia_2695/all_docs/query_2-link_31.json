        "text": "Young and Famous\n\nDickens moved to number 48 from Furnival Chambers, Holborn, in March 1837, paying the substantial sum of £80 a year in rent. His newfound wealth – having previously lived in down-at-heel Somers Town as a child – was owing to the sensational success of his first novel, The Pickwick Papers, the first instalment of which had appeared a year earlier in March 1836. The serial was published as a companion to comic sketches, drawn at first by Robert Seymour and then by Hablot Knight Browne, who was to illustrate Dickens’ works for the next 23 years.\n\nWhile living at Doughty Street, Dickens completed The Pickwick Papers (1837-38), wrote two new works – Oliver Twist (1837–38) and Nicholas Nickleby (1838–39) – and made a start on Barnaby Rudge (1841). He also forged friendships with several important figures in the arts, including the actor William Charles Macready and Thomas Carlyle, and secured election to both the Garrick and Athenaeum clubs.\n\nCarlyle’s impression of Dickens from this time was that he was ‘a quiet, shrewd-looking, little fellow, who seems to guess pretty well what he is and what others are’.\n\nTwo births and a death\n\nDickens lived at the house with his wife Catherine (1816–79) and her younger sister, Mary Hogarth (1820–37). However the same year they moved in Mary died suddenly at the age of 17 in Dickens’s arms. Dickens was so traumatised by her death he was unable to write – the only hiatus in his long and prolific writing career.\n\nTwo daughters – Mary (1838–96) and Kate (1839–1929) – were born to Charles and Catherine Dickens in Doughty Street, and the favourable sales of Nickleby enabled him to move his growing family in December 1839 to a larger house – 1 Devonshire Terrace, Marylebone High Street. The property was controversially demolished in 1958, along with its London City Council plaque."
