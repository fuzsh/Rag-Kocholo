        "text": "New plaques in 2024\n\nMore plaques will be unveiled to individual women in 2024 than in any previous year of the London blue plaques scheme’s history, which dates back over 150 years.\n\nRecipients recognised in 2024 include: Christina Broom, believed to have been Britain’s first female press photographer; Diana Beck, celebrated as the UK’s first female neurosurgeon; jazz singer, Adelaide Hall, one of the first black women to secure a long-term contract at the BBC; and Irene Barclay, the first woman to qualify as a chartered surveyor.\n\nRead about Irene Barclay\n\nPlaques for women\n\nOnly 15 per cent of London’s blue plaques celebrate women. We don't think that’s good enough. Since 2016, when we first launched our ‘plaques for women’ campaign, more than half of the people awarded plaques have been women, but only a third of the public nominations were for women. Nominations are the life blood of the London blue plaques scheme. If you know of a woman who deserves a blue plaque and meets the selection criteria, nominate her now.\n\nPropose a woman for a blue plaque\n\nLiving with disability\n\nWe commemorate people from all walks of life, some of whom lived with disability. For some, their disability was a difficulty to be navigated, often in a hostile environment. For others, it changed the course of their lives, and was in some cases central to the achievement for which they're celebrated.\n\nWe explore stories of people with both visible and hidden impairments, and consider the impact disability had on their lives.\n\nRead the article"
