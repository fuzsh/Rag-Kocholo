        "text": "At the same time a blue plaque was unveiled to mark the childhood home of football legend Laurie Cunningham it was revealed that in London, just 4% of the plaques honour black or Asian luminaries. But in such an ethnically diverse city, why are there so few?\n\nAccording to the Office of National Statistics, London has above-average ethnic minority populations for the UK. These include African (7%), Indian (6.6%), and Caribbean (4.2%).\n\nBut there is not a proportional number of plaques and English Heritage has decided to take action.\n\nGus Casely-Hayford, a curator and cultural historian with Ghanaian roots, has been appointed the leader of a working group to try to redress the balance.\n\nIt will not award plaques itself, but will look for Asian and black candidates to put before the selection panel, which grants only 12 plaques a year.\n\nDr Casely-Hayford says London is an \"ethnic melting pot\".\n\n\"We are linked through language, culture, political alliance and economic partnership to every part of the world,\" he says. \"And peoples from places that we have touched, have found their way here, to not just make London their home, but to make London and this country what it is.\n\n\"We want to celebrate that rich, complex, sometimes difficult history, through the lives of those that truly made it.\"\n\nAlthough the blue plaque scheme was set up in 1866, it was not until 1954 that the first to honour a notable figure of minority ethnic origin was installed - to Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nOther black and Asian people who have English Heritage plaques include Jamaican Crimea War nurse Mary Seacole, Chinese writer Lao She, external, Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore, and American guitarist and song-writer Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons for such a small proportion of plaques being for blacks and Asians, English Heritage says.\n\nFor example, it initially appears Cesar Picton has been overlooked. A former servant, he became a coal merchant in Kingston-upon-Thames in the 18th Century and was wealthy enough by the time he died to bequeath two acres of land and a house - with a wharf and shops attached.\n\nBut although he does not have an English Heritage blue plaque, he does have a plaque from Thames Ditton and West Green Residents' Association and one from the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames.\n\nOlaudah Equiano - a slave who went on to become a radical reformer and best-selling author, as well as the first black person to explore the Arctic - has a green plaque awarded by the City of Westminster and a memorial in St Margaret's Church at Westminster Abbey.\n\nDadabhai Naoroji, the first Asian MP, has a green plaque on Finsbury Old Town Hall in Islington and a second one erected by a local society.\n\nThis means none qualify for an English Heritage blue plaque on the same building.\n\nAnother reason why there are fewer black and Asian people honoured with blue plaques is the schemes' strict rule that people must have been dead for 20 years before being considered.\n\nMany members of London's black and Asian communities arrived in the country after World War Two. Consequently many of the likely contenders for a blue plaque have either not been dead for long enough or are still alive.\n\nThis category would include Jayaben Desai, the prominent leader of the Asian women strikers in the Grunwick dispute in London in 1976. She died in 2010.\n\nSimilarly, Val McCalla, the Jamaican-born founder of The Voice, a national newspaper for the UK's black community, died in 2002. From humble beginnings in an East End flat, his newspaper grew into a major business and turned Mr McCalla into a millionaire. But he will not qualify for a blue plaque until 2022.\n\nHowever, English Heritage is standing firm on this policy.\n\nBut now, says Anna Eavis from English Heritage, the criteria has evolved.\n\n\"[Since the scheme was established] our idea of which figures from the past are significant has changed,\" she says.\n\n\"While Laurie Cunningham was an incredibly gifted footballer who paved the way for many other black playersâ¦â50 years ago he would never have found his way on to a plaque.\"\n\nAnother issue is the fact that the plaques are as much about the buildings as about the people themselves.\n\nA plaque is only erected if there is a surviving building closely associated with the person in question. Many black and Asian people faced racism and institutional barriers, and often lived outside of the official records, which makes it difficult to definitively link them to a specific building.\n\nHistorically, black and Asian people often lived in poorer areas which have since been redeveloped or demolished.\n\nIgnatius Sancho, an abolition campaigner, composer, actor, and writer - who was the first known black Briton to vote in a British election - falls foul of this.\n\nHe has a plaque erected by the Nubian Jak Community Trust at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the City of Westminster, which says he \"lived and had a grocery shop near this site\" and another on the remaining wall of Montague House on the south-west boundary of Greenwich Park, which commemorated the bicentenary of the abolition of the Slave Trade Act.\n\nThat would not be enough for an English Heritage blue plaque as there is no specific building he lived or worked in.\n\nBut English Heritage says it is determined to redress the balance.\n\nDr Casely-Hayford says he is asking the British public to help \"in uncovering the stories of those unacknowledged heroes who helped make our great city what it is\".\n\nYet, given the stringent criteria, those stories will need a significant amount of uncovering before the number of English Heritage blue plaques even comes close to representing the ethnic makeup of England's \"melting pot\" of a capital city."
