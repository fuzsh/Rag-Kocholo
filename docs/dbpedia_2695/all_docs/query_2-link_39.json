        "text": "About me\n\nIntroduction\n\nYou may be aware of the castle in your town or the lake down the road or the old works in your city centre - but do you know how the past shapes the identity of where you live today?\n\nDo you realise that by taking a walk in a National Park, or going to a fete, or even eating a pork pie you are also engaging with history?\n\nFor the first time, we reveal how these ‘assets’ and activities both separately and together improve life for the people living there and which places are making the best use of this local heritage.\n\nLocal communities and cultural leaders may express heart-felt enthusiasm for a region’s history and identity but may not always see the potential that this heritage has in developing an area economically, culturally or socially.\n\nRather than follow a generic formula, we believe that heritage can provide the USP in shaping a place. Local and civic leaders need to look deeper and wider in using heritage to strengthen the local identity that our research proves is linked to well-being.\n\nThe Heritage Index, launched by the RSA in collaboration with the Heritage Lottery Fund, ranks for the first time which areas are making best use of their heritage assets through activities such as volunteering, the number of people visiting museums and the number of nights people spend on holiday in a local area.\n\nThe Heritage Index is designed to stimulate debate about what is valued from the past and how that influences the identity of current residents in a place. It brings together over 100 indicators and these include:\n\nListed buildings, historic battlefields and conservation areas\n\nLand designated for protection of wildlife such as nature reserves\n\nParks, National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty\n\nLocal food and drink products which have received special protected status from the European Commission, such as Melton Mowbray pork pies and Kentish Ale\n\nBlue Plaques on buildings which mark a famous or important individual associated with the building (The Blue Plaque scheme was first proposed in 1863 by William Ewart MP and by 1866 the RSA had founded what we would recognise as the Blue Plaques scheme today.)\n\nHeritage Open Days\n\nNumber of young people who are active in heritage, e.g. with archaeological clubs, at wildlife reserves, in school participation outside of the classroom\n\nHeritage is about people and activities,\n\nnot just physical assets\n\nOften we associate heritage with historic structures which have stood the test of time: castles and palaces, museums and country houses, the legacy of industrial Britain. But where history comes alive is where people are part of their local history.\n\nIn the Heritage Index we’ve reflected this by looking at both the fixed assets such as the buildings, the nature reserves and so on but also the activities that people are doing. Bringing these two together reveals new insights about which areas in England, Scotland and Wales are making best use of their heritage.\n\nIn England it’s probably predictable that the City of London, the London borough of Kensington & Chelsea and the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge all appear among the top six districts on the Assets Index. But, when heritage activity is included the top performers then include Scarborough, Cumbria’s Lake District and Norwich.\n\nKey insights from the Heritage Index…\n\nIn England: 1. City of London. 2. Kensington & Chelsea. 3. Scarborough. 4. Cambridge. 5. Hastings. 6. Oxford.\n\nThe well understood assets of world-class museums, University archives, Royal Parks and dense collections of historic buildings put the City of London, Kensington & Chelsea, Oxford and Cambridge amongst the highest rankings – along with high levels of participation in local heritage by local residents and tourists.\n\nScarborough’s natural heritage helps move it up the\n\nrankings: local residents’ keen interest in nature and wildlife volunteering, the care of Blue Flag beaches and protected sites for nature, its location on the edge of the North York Moors National Park - all of which attract high numbers of visitors.\n\nHastings is particularly strong in social history and industrial heritage, as well as parks and green space. The town has some of the country’s largest number of Heritage Open Days and Blue Plaques.\n\nPortsmouth (12th), Southend (18th) and Blackpool (28th) score among the top 10% of England’s 325 local authorities on the Heritage Index, despite having areas of high deprivation.\n\nMany other coastal areas score particularly highly: including Dorset’s Jurassic Coast, Torbay in Devon, and the Cumbria coast.\n\nIn Scotland: 1. Dundee. 2. Orkney Islands. 3. Edinburgh. 4. Eiliean Siar (Outer Hebrides – Western Isles) 5. Glasgow. 6. Stirling.\n\nIn Dundee, volunteering and events are high and there has been heavy investment in the city’s heritage by the local authority.\n\nThe Orkney Islands are home to a globally-recognised World Heritage Site which includes Skara Brae, a well-preserved Neolithic village older than Stonehenge or Egypt’s Pyramids.\n\nIn Wales: 1. Gwynedd. 2. Isle of Anglesey, 3. Ceridigion. 4. Pembrokeshire, 5. Torfaen. 6. Denbighshire.\n\nUnlike England and Scotland, the top spot in Wales is taken by a rural area. Gwynedd is home to Snowdonia National Park and is a hugely popular area for tourism. But this is also the local authority with the second largest number of listed buildings in Wales, and more museums and archives than any other except Powys.\n\nAbout me\n\nLiverpool is our city of heritage, as well as city of culture\n\nOutside of London, Liverpool is amongst the top large cities in England - and at 59th in the top 20% overall. Liverpool ranks particularly highly for museums and objects and for cultures and memories. The city has 23 businesses in the culture sector which have their own long history, having existed for over 75 years. This includes football clubs, music venues, cinemas and theatres. Liverpool also has significant natural heritage assets including the Mersey estuary.\n\nLiverpool is closely followed by Bristol. Bristol – 72nd overall – has strong levels of activity around its historic built environment as well as extensive coverage through conservation areas. The city is surrounded by a Green Belt with many landscape assets, and in heritage activity has pioneered innovations such as mapping all of its public sculptures as part of the Know Your Place initiative.\n\nLeeds and Birmingham, however, score in the bottom 30% of English local authorities in the Heritage Index, despite Leeds having more listed buildings than any city outside London, and Birmingham having more Blue Plaques. Leeds scores in the top half of the heritage activities table but much lower on heritage assets. This could be because the councils are the two most populous in the country and cover a large amount of suburban development which is considered to have low heritage value.\n\nCardiff comes 9th among 22 council areas in Wales with Swansea coming 8th. Cardiff has particular strengths in parks and open space, while Swansea has strengths in industrial heritage and the natural heritage of Swansea Bay.\n\nDundee comes 1st among Scotland’s 32 council areas whilst Edinburgh at 3rd pips Glasgow (5th). Dundee was a Victorian centre of industry with extensive shipbuilding and in 1911 had over 40% of the workforce in jute production at more than 100 mills. Recently it has seen high levels of investment in advance of the arrival of the Victoria and Albert Museum on the waterfront.\n\nAbout me\n\nThe coast: from seaside holidays to seaside heritage\n\nOver the last 50 years many seaside towns and coastal communities have struggled, perhaps due to the decline of domestic tourism along with the challenges of serving an ageing resident population.\n\nSome coastal areas, however, have seen the potential in their\n\nheritage to help adapt to these pressures. Successes include Cornwall, North Devon, Scarborough and the Lincolnshire coast, where heritage assets have been capitalised upon to generate high levels of activity.\n\nIn Cornwall, a strong sense of pride and identity has underpinned efforts to help mainstays of the local diet: oysters, sardines, pasties and clotted cream have achieved European Union protected status.\n\nOn the Lincolnshire coast, the Mablethorpe Marathon was initiated in 2006 in an effort to extend the end of the tourist season and build a distinct identity for the town.\n\nScarborough has pioneered the use of data analysis since the 1990s, allowing the town to understand trends in the economic impact generated by tourism. In Whitby (part of the Scarborough district) heritage events extend beyond the summer tourist season, building on the asset of the Gothic Abbey to host a horror film festival, for example.\n\nThe Heritage Index suggests future growth areas for heritage\n\nactivity, as well as tourism, could include Hastings and West Somerset. The Index points to significant opportunities to\n\ncapitalise upon different forms of local heritage, in particular landscape and natural heritage attractions - including wildlife reserves in north Kent (Gravesend, Medway and Isle of Sheppey) and south Essex (Southend and neighbouring Rochford and Castle Point).\n\nIn Southend, as well as its unique pier the town is part of the story of the Thames ecological renaissance: it has natural assets as important as those present in National Parks yet low levels of participation. It is also part of the Thames Gateway – one of the fastest developing parts of the country with new housing and a\n\ngrowing population. So there is potential for growth.\n\nTo capitalise on the opportunity for Southend, councils and\n\ncommunities should work together across district boundaries and promote and support access to heritage – including targeting new residents and visitors arriving through the growing airport at Southend.\n\nAbout me\n\nThe UK government has recently started surveying the population to understand how levels of well-being vary between places. We compared this data to scores from our Heritage Index. We found that in areas which scored highly on the Heritage Index, residents also tended to report higher levels of well-being.\n\nMost interestingly, it is heritage activities rather than heritage assets which make the difference. This holds true in Scotland, Wales and England.\n\nSeveral factors might explain this link. Having extensive and accessible heritage activities available locally allow people more opportunities to have experiences which drive satisfaction with life.\n\nAlternatively, it could also be relevant that people with high well-being are more pro-active in choosing to (or being more able to) live in districts with high levels of local amenities including heritage. Also, people with high levels of well-being are more commonly active participants and volunteers in their community.\n\nTaken together, this finding suggests that heritage assets alone do not contribute to well-being, but higher levels of heritage activity could be a driver of well-being. This is promising for the heritage sector since activities are more open to influence than assets.\n\nAbout me\n\nThe Index suggests that many of the UK’s heritage assets remain untapped by local authorities and could play a much greater role in helping their area thrive.\n\nThere are a number of ‘opportunity areas’ - where levels of heritage activity could be higher given the assets that the areas enjoy. These include many inner city districts such as Newham and Islington in London, Bury in Lancashire, and Dudley in the Black Country.\n\nIn these places there are a rich set of assets but levels of activity are low. For example:\n\nTower Hamlets has six accredited museums locally and has yielded more archaeological finds than any other London borough (except the City of London). However, just 43% of residents regularly go to a museum – less than the national average of 52%.\n\nDudley is home to a high concentration of industrial history assets including canals, railways and the Black Country Living Museum but overall heritage activity levels are in the bottom half of local authorities when compared across England.\n\nIn Wales, Cardiff, Flintshire and Newport have the largest gap when comparing heritage activities to assets. In Scotland, Moray, Fife and East Lothian have the largest gap. In both cases, these are potential growth areas for heritage activity.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, analysis of the Index reveals that Cornwall, Lincolnshire, Stirling and Ayrshire in Scotland, and the West Wales coast, are doing particularly well already in making the most of their heritage assets. Some of England’s most renowned historic towns, such as Harrogate, Stratford-upon-Avon, Chester, Winchester, York and Bath are all assessed to be performing well, using assets to drive high levels of heritage activity.\n\nHowever, there are many surprises too. Among less famous places, Arun district (containing Littlehampton and Bognor Regis), Milton Keynes and Bedford are all home to relatively high levels of heritage activity, despite being in the bottom half of local authorities in density of heritage assets.\n\nIn Arun, this has included making greater progress on ‘Neighbourhood Plans’ than anywhere else in England – these plans give local people the chance to set policies on how the historic environment is protected in law. In Milton Keynes, although the majority of buildings were built in the last 50 years as the new town was expanded by the government, the number of Heritage Open Days locally is well above average.\n\nAbout me\n\nThe Heritage Index is designed to be a resource which helps to forge a stronger link between local heritage and the identity of residents in a place. This can help a place achieve its aspirations to grow and prosper, socially and economically.\n\nIt allows anyone interested in heritage to understand and interpret a range of data from dozens of different sources through a single access point. Those with a passion for numbers are able to customise results for themselves by changing the calculations within the Index. Engaging with the data can, itself, stimulate a richer conversation which relates heritage assets to heritage activities across a broad spectrum of what we consider as heritage.\n\nIn Bristol, Oldham and Dundee, the RSA will organise a public debate in autumn 2015 to understand better the aspects of heritage which matter most to local people, how they relate to other priorities (like housing, parks or education) and what a range of organisations should do with this collective intelligence.\n\nStrategies which shape the development of local areas are more successful when people can identify with what makes where they live special. Heritage provides a USP, differentiating one place from another and is fundamental to the global brand and local identity associated with that place.\n\nWe recommend that:\n\nLocal leaders – including leaders of government, public services, major institutions and major corporations – should use the Heritage Index as evidence to inform local strategies. The Index shows relative strengths and weaknesses across a broad definition of heritage and brings attention to where strengths could be consolidated and capitalised upon, or areas where under-performance might be addressed. This will be particularly important for areas adopting new powers as part of Devolution and Decentralisation.\n\nPeople designing projects and preparing funding applications will be able to better understand how their work would measure against the scale of existing heritage assets and activities locally. This could inspire better designed projects. The indicators themselves point to different ways in which projects could understand that they have been successful.\n\nThose looking to develop local heritage to boost tourism, employment or leisure and learning opportunities for local citizens can capture, through a simplified measure, the ways in which a local area is special or unique, thereby helping to identify and set priorities."
