        "text": "Welcome to our online tour of commemorative plaques celebrating the people and places associated with the BBC and its programmes.\n\nIn our interactive map we mark the history Britainâs black community, showing the plaques installed as part of David Olusogaâs 2016 landmark BBC TV series Black and British - A Forgotten History.\n\nBroadcasting heritage plaques include some of the UKâs first ever radio stations, such as Glasgowâs BBC â5 SCâ, Cardiffâs â5 WAâ, and Belfastâs â2 BEâ stations, and there are new BBC blue plaques installed at former studios including: Bush House (BBC World Service), Maida Vale (BBC orchestras and BBC Radiophonic Workshop), and BBC Elstree Centre (Eastenders).\n\nFurther south at Asnelles in Calvados, weâve featured the Radio Londres plaque, located at the CimetiÃ¨re d'Asnelles. The plaque commemorates the solidarity of the BBC with the Free French, both in its broadcasts from London, and from 1944 its wartime broadcasting centre at ChÃ¢teau de Creully near Bayeux.\n\nAnd, from each BBC English region we feature a BBC Music Day plaque. These were awarded in 2017 by BBC Local Radio stations to venues that hosted a landmark musical moment in their area. The range of musical talent featured is vast, from Led Zeppelinâs first appearance at Newcastleâs former Mayflower Ballroom, to The Bamboo Club which was the home of ska, reggae and bluebeat in Bristol.\n\nFind out more about how the BBC has commemorated cultural, musical and broadcasting history moments by clicking on the interactive map below.\n\n1 Portland Place - Westminster, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâHome of BBC School Radio, 1952-1993.

This was rapidly superseded by the superior all-electronic service created by EMI that had been running in parallel.\n\nSt. Bartholomewâs Hospital - City, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\n\"Enslaved youth Jonathan Strong was treated at St Bartholomewâs after being savagely beaten.

It lies four miles outside central London at Shepherds Bush. The distinctive building, in the shape of a question mark has been re-developed as offices, a hotel and housing, with three TV studios. It also houses the headquarters of the BBCâs commercial operation BBC Studios.\n\nBroadcasting House - Portland Place, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâFirst purpose-built broadcast centre in the UK.â\n\nA BBC Heritage Trail plaque, which appears at intervals on an information screen on the Peel Wing of New Broadcasting House.\n\nDesigned by G Val Myer and built in 1932, Broadcasting House was the UKâs first purpose-built home for radio broadcasting, and the second only in Europe. It is situated in central London between Oxford Street and Regents Park, adjacent to Nash's All Souls' church, and is Grade II* listed. The Architectural Review of 1932 described it as the 'new Tower of London', but it had a mixed reception amongst architects generally, being criticised as a conservative mix of functional elements with a nod toward Art Deco.\n\nBush House - Strand, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâHome of the BBCâs international radio, TV and online services.â\n\nA BBC Heritage Trail plaque.\n\nFor more than 70 years the BBC's international voice was heard from the neo-classically styled Bush House, originally constructed in the 1920s as a trade centre. Having been bombed out of Broadcasting House in the early stages of the Second World War, BBC European Services, needed a new home. Bush House was massive in comparison to its former offices, and the BBC increased rapidly its number of foreign language services. The BBC left Bush House in 2012.\n\nCamden Palace Theatre - Camden, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâThe Last Goon Show of All starring Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan & Harry Secombe was recorded by the BBC in this Theatre on 30th April 1972.â\n\nA Comic Heritage plaque.\n\nSome of the nationâs favourite radio programmes including The Goon Show, were recorded here for the BBC Light Programme. It was the home of BBC Radio light music and comedy between 1945 and 1972, but was also used for special one off BBC recordings, including a celebratory vinyl LP of Monty Pythonâs Flying Circus. The BBC had to completely renovate the building when it moved in, as it had been converted from a theatre to a cinema.\n\nCatley Lane Head - Rochdale, Greater Manchester\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\n\"In memory of the Rochdale millworkers who supported the struggle against slavery during the American Civil War 1861-65.\"\n\nA BBC History Project plaque\n\nBBC Black and British\n\nTelevision Film Studios - Ealing Green, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâSir Michael Balcon, 1896-1977 Film Producer, worked here 1938-1956.â\n\nAn English Heritage plaque.\n\nThe BBC transformed the former feature film studios at Ealing into its Television Film Studios (TFS) operation starting in 1955. In its heyday more than 50 film crews used Ealing as their HQ for filming drama and documentaries on location. The famous filmed sequences of Cathy Come Home, and Z-Cars were edited here. Quatermass and the Pit, and Colditz were completed here. The BBC subsequently sold the studios to the National Film and Television School, (NFTS).\n\n33 Fairlop Road - Waltham Forest, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâOn this site until 1930 stood a house called Apthorp, birthplace of the famous TV cookery expert Fanny Craddock; born Phyllis Pechey.â\n\nA Waltham Forest Heritage plaque.\n\nHippodrome Theatre - North End Road, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâHippodrome Theatre, Golders Green Home of the BBC Concert Orchestra 1969 â 2003.â\n\nA BBC Heritage Trail plaque.\n\nInitially the BBC took over this 3000 seat former music hall for colour television production in the 1960s, but soon found that it suited radio production much better. Radio 2âs Friday Night is Music Night was a regular fixture at the theatre, as well as series and one-offs from the BBC Concert Orchestra, the BBC Big Band and the BBC Radio Orchestra. By the mid-1970s this middle of the road fair was contrasting with concerts by the likes of AC/DC for BBC Radio 1. The BBC left in 2003.\n\nLime Grove - Shepherd's Bush, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâHome of iconic TV news, Childrenâs and Drama programmes.â\n\nA BBC Heritage Trail plaque.\n\nThese studios were originally built for the British film industry in 1915. Gaumont, Gainsborough Pictures and Rank Films occupied the site, and some of the greatest names of British cinema worked there, including Alfred Hitchcock. The studios were acquired by the BBC in 1949 as a 'temporary measure' until its new Television Centre was built. In 1992 the studios were closed, and were later demolished to make way for housing.\n\nMaida Vale - Delaware Road, London\n\nPlaque inscription:\n\nâHome of BBC Symphony Orchestra and the Radiophonic Workshop.â\n\nA BBC Heritage Trail plaque.\n\nMaida Vale was acquired in response to the rapidly increasing requirements of broadcasting in the early 1930s.
