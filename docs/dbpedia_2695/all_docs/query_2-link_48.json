        "text": "Blue plaques are a familiar sight across the city of Brighton & Hove.\n\nSelect 'Read More' for details about the Blue Plaque Scheme & use the map below to view the plaques already in the city. The map is interactive so simply click (or tap) & drag to see more plaques.\n\nWhat is a Blue Plaque?\n\nA blue plaque is a permanent sign installed in a public place to commemorate a link between that location and a famous person or event - serving as a kind of historical marker.\n\nCommemorative plaque schemes exist across much of England and indeed other countries around the world. The first formal scheme, however, was launched in England, with Brighton's scheme starting in 1923.\n\nNominate a Commemorative Plaque\n\nIf you would like to nominate a person or a specific site to be commemorated by a plaque then please email Roger Amerena, Chairman of the Commemorative Plaque Panel - roger.amerena@btinternet.com\n\nDownload a Commemorative Plaque Nomination Form - for an individual (54 KB - PDF)\n\nDownload a Commemorative Plaque Nomination Form - for an event or institution (55 KB - PDF)\n\nDownload the Criteria for the nomination of a Commemorative Plaque (68 KB - PDF)\n\nAs The Commemorative Plaque Panel consists of nominated and elected volunteers from national and local amenity groups, when submitting a nomination please include as much information as possible, such as research undertaken into the nominee and any correspondence with the freeholder of the property. Once a nomination has been received for approval the Panel will be able to guide you through the process from obtaining listed building consent, when necessary, to the wording on the plaque and the unveiling event.\n\nPlease note that all plaques need to be funded and the approximate cost for the creation and installation of a commemorative plaque is Â£1500.\n\nCommemorative Plaques in the City of Brighton & Hove\n\nThere are over 130 commemorative plaques across the city installed in recognition of a variety of people and events. Different mediums have been used over the years including the Portland Stone ones of the famous Eric Gill, to bronze, Westmorland Green slate and the present porcelain blue and white items.\n\nAlongside internationally renowned figures from history such as Charles Dickens, Sir Winston Churchill and Rudyard Kipling you will also discover less well-known innovators such as Doreen Valiente the Mother of Modern Witchcraft and William Friese-Green who pioneered cinematography."
