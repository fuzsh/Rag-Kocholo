        "text": "Wandering the streets London, especially the more artistic boroughs, you’ve probably seen the blue plaques on the walls of some buildings. These honour the notable men and women who have lived or worked in them. But mostly the men.\n\nThis week, English Heritage asked the public for help on improving the percentage dedicated to women. At present, this stands at a woeful 14 per cent, even after a two year push to improve it. I asked for a list of the women already commemorated – but the response was to suggest using their app to find specific women.\n\nSo I turned to Wikipedia. As that lists the plaques by borough, and I know Citymetric readers love a list with some stats in it, here is a summary of what I found there. If you want to improve the chances of your suggestion making it to a wall, this may help you target your efforts.\n\nGood effort, needs work\n\nFirst up, the boroughs that seem to be trying.\n\nKingston-upon-Thames – 40 per cent of plaques dedicated to women\n\nThere are only five plaques in total, though, so it’s an area worth punting a suggestion in on. The two women were Enid Blyton and Dame Nellie Melba, but sadly their residencies did not overlap, so there were no lashings of peach desserts.\n\nEnfield – 37 per cent, Merton – 37 per cent\n\nOnly four plaques in total in Enfield, so the result here is down to Mary Lamb having to share her plaque with her brother Charles. This seems a little unfair, given he has his own solo plaque over in Islington.\n\nBromley – 33.3 per cent, Hackney – 28 per cent, Islington – 24 per cent\n\nOne of the plaques in Bromley is for two women who lived together, but as we were only counting plaques, that only counted as one. This is not the only time cohabiting ladies appear.\n\nBarnet – 19 per cent, Ealing – 17 per cent, Tower Hamlets – 14 per cent\n\nThere are 21 plaques in total for Tower Hamlets, but only three are for women. The site where the first flying bomb landed does get its own plaque, which seems to be stretching the selection criteria quite a long way.\n\nRichmond-upon-Thames – 14 per cent\n\nThis borough should look to its neighbour to up its game. More overall, but a lower percentage for women. Virginia Woolf gets half a plaque, sharing with her husband. In fairness, she does have her own plaque over in Camden.\n\nKensington & Chelsea – 14 per cent\n\nWith the early focus of the plaques being on artists, it’s not surprising that K&C has the second highest number with 176 in total. Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst have to share, whist Sylvia gets to go alone. George Eliot makes her first appearance here – one of two women to appear twice in the list without having to share with someone.\n\nCity of Westminster – 12 per cent\n\nAnd here’s Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Eliot’s contemporary, who also gets two solo plaques. This time they are both in the same borough, so the poet makes up 5 per cent of the 38 women listed. With 309 plaques, the most of any part of London, this a borough that is dripping in blue.\n\nCamden – 12 per cent\n\nHere’s Virginia Woolf with a plaque of her own, out of the 169 in the borough. Six women get to share plaques with their husbands. It may be worth a punt, if you can find a building Dante Gabriel Rossetti hasn’t already been in.\n\nMust Try Harder\n\nAfter the bulge or the arts crowds, we’re back into the boroughs where the number of plaques is in the tens, if that. Any of the following would be a good place to suggest someone.\n\nHaringey – 10 per cent, Lewisham – 9per cent\n\nHaringey has just one woman. But it did pop one on Alexandra Palace for being where the BBC started television in the UK.\n\nLambeth – 8 per cent\n\nTwo of Lambeth’s are for organisations, and two are for women. One of the women was Violette Szabo, the Special Operations Executive agent commemorated in the film ‘Carve Her Name’ and whose bust features on the SOE memorial close to Lambeth Palace.\n\nSouthwark 6 per cent, Hammersmith & Fulham 5 per cent, Wandsworth 4 per cent\n\nWandsworth has 27 plaques, only one of which is for a woman. And it’s that George Eliot again.\n\nNot Even Trying\n\nThe following boroughs have no women featured on their blue plaques at all. None. Nada. In some cases, they have very few plaques, so a good pitch here could send them to the top of the leader board.\n\nBarking & Dagenham\n\nGiven the role the Dagenham machinists – and their sisters up in Liverpool – had in the push for the Equal Pay Act of 1974, it’s startling to see the lone plaque is to Bobby Moore. The plant the women worked in is being demolished so it may be too late to mark it in the way other places have marked a historic moment.\n\nGreenwich\n\nDespite the borough’s history as a locus of power and scientific thinking, not a single woman of note has been born, died or lived in Greenwich. Not one. The GPO film unit gets a plaque though.\n\nNewham\n\nTwo plaques, but none for women. An obvious choice would be Joan Littlewood, who lived and worked in the Theatre Royal Stratford East. Due to the rule about waiting 20 years after someone’s death to nominate them, this will have to wait until 2022 to be considered.\n\nHavering\n\nContains one blue plaque. To an anti-tank weapon.\n\nBexley, Brent, Croydon, Harrow, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Redbridge, Sutton, Waltham Forest.\n\nI. Can’t. Even.\n\nIf you’d like to nominate a woman for a blue plaque, there are some criteria. Which things like bombs and Ally Pally did not meet, but whatever.\n\nJust 6 per cent of the plaques dedicated to scientists are for women at present, so that could be an area to focus on.
