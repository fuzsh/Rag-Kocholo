        "text": "Brown Heritage Plaques\n\nIn May 2010 Tameside introduced a new Brown Plaque scheme, Blue Plaques are already common throughout the borough and there is also one Green plaque.\n\nBlue Plaques are usually placed on buildings or sites of former buildings where some one who has made a significant historical contribution has lived.\n\nThe Brown plaque scheme marks interesting buildings or structures. These may be architectural or historically important places or both, or where an historic event has taken place. These places are not covered by other plaques.\n\nFollowing the tragic death of George Floyd and in light of our support for the ‘Black Lives Matter’ campaign, we have reviewed the borough’s collection of public sculptures and Blue Plaques. Currently there are none that we would propose removing. However our collection is always under review and we are attentive to the public’s views on historical figures who have been celebrated and commemorated.\n\nTameside Metropolitan Borough Council has also pledged our commitment to further reflection and action to address race inequality issues. For further information see https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/news/greater-manchester-statement-on-george-floyd-and-black-lives-matter/\n\nIf you have any concerns about the statues or blue and brown plaques in Tameside, please contact events@tameside.gov.uk\n\nAshton-under-Lyne\n\nAshton Union Workhouse and Ashton Parish Workhouse\n\nAshton under Lyne Mechanics Institute\n\nDukinfield\n\nDukinfield St Mary’s Former burial ground Astley Street"
