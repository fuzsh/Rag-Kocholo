There are 32 boroughs that make up London, plus the non-borough division the City of London. (Previous borough articles: 1).\n\nBorough 2: The City of Westminster\n\nThe first actual borough of London’s 32 boroughs is the world-renowned City of Westminster. Yes, this is the borough home to famous landmarks like Big Ben, The West End, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, and more. It is, of course, the site of much of the British government.\n\nLike the non-borough City of London, this borough also has the added distinction of being a city in its own right. It is the only London borough to have this distinction.\n\n*Full disclosure: this is the borough I live in, but I’ll try to refrain from too much personal opinion.\n\nFirst and foremost: the history!"
