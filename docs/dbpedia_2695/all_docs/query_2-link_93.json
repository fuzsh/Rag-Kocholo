You are also able to use your map with drawing pins allowing personalisation and the ability to plan travels.\n\nWallpaper\n\nFitting and installation\n\nOur pre-pasted wallpaper from HP needs no additional adhesive and is so simple to install that you won't need to pay for a commercial decorator to do it for you (although we have fitters available should you wish - call us on 01993 880 939 to discuss).\n\nWallpaper details\n\nThe wallpaper is PVC free and is printed using HP's Latex inks ensuring you get a more environmentally friendly mural compared to one produced with solvent inks. It is also odor-free making it safe for all rooms in the home and commercial interiors where the initial solvent smell would be an issue such as schools, restaurants, cafes and offices. The ultra smooth finish and the latex base of the inks provide vivid colour graphics with high-definition detail.\n\nRemoval\n\nWhen the time comes to redecorate, the wallpaper is so easy to remove that HP provide a warranty for clean removal making it ideal for exhibition graphics or rented properties. You can then package up the stripped wall covering and recycle it through HP's Planet Partners Recycling Program.\n\nBespoke mapping wallpaper\n\nIf this standard pre-pasted Wallpaper map is not quite what you're looking for then we offer a bespoke wallpaper service. You can request the exact size to fit your wall and even change the design and colours of the map. Additionally we offer a range of different wallpaper finish options including smooth, laminated and magnetic lined wallpaper. Call our team on 01993 880 939 and they will talk you through all the options. Alternatively email us on [email protected] with your details."
