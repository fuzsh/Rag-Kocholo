A map on the Open Plaques website shows the location of the Society’s plaques.\n\nOur first plaque is a bronze pavement plaque which was unveiled on 23 February 2005 to commemorate the first branch of Waitrose then known as Messrs Waite, Rose and Taylor, which opened over 100 years ago in 1904 at 263 High Street Acton W3 and is now occupied by the Karak Chaii coffee shop. This plaque was jointly sponsored by Ealing Civic Society with the Acton History Group and Waitrose Ltd.\n\nOur second plaque is a green wall plaque which was unveiled on 23 March 2006 to commemorate William Willett who was the inventor of Daylight Saving Time, which is known as British Summer Time in this country.
