        "text": "Square is a turning point in the city and it determines the value and identity of all its surrounding parts and gives identity to them. \" Square is the same as the word middle (miyan) and its Arabic equivalent is \" meydan \" , and it means the heart of city and an open space for people's gathering together with a surrounding market [1]. \" It can be said that in the important cities and especially the capitals, a governmental-public square had been built in which many social-religious-ceremonies had been being held. The history of these squares goes back to the Ilkhanates era and after the Mongol invasion. Maybe due to the lack of popularity and acceptability, the Mongols' kings started to build public buildings and tried to get a kind of popularity [2]. Beside Tabriz city, they built two towns known as \" Shanb Ghazan Khan \" and \" Rab-e-Rashidi \". In the downtown core of both towns, they built a collection of public-royal buildings known as \" Abvab Al-Bar \" which their common features was the tomb of their builder, as the most important building of the collection. In the Timurid era, square, as an organizing space of the cities, had a multi-function, so that educational function was also added to it and it formed the skeleton of the city, beside the market. This space was tested in the cities which were selected as capital and this experience in the other cities gradually formed a background for \" Naghshe Jahan \" square, which is a turning point in urbanization of Iran.\n\nWhile forms of cities in Iran have been transformed from traditional structure into modern one, in the same line, the urban elements including squares changed and appeared in a totally new characteristic. Traditional squares in Iran have normally been vast open spaces enclosed with public traditional uses such as public baths, cisterns, mosques, bazars, palaces and governmental buildings. All of these squares have coherently been articulated with the city fabric for people. Since the first Pahlavi, urban fabric of Tehran, and accordingly its squares, has changed specifically for using cars or applying new modern infrastructures. Thus, from this time on in Tehran, two types of development overlays each other: The traditional layer consisting of organic and narrow roads and the modern layer with orthogonal and grid roads. To some extent, the same prototype has been followed in other big or small cities and settlements. The roundabouts or so-called modern squares emerged at the intersection of road networks across the cities. Therefore, the main usage and scale of these squares was defined for vehicular transportation. Around this new urban element at the crossroads some modern functions were emerged: municipality, post and telegraph office, hotels, banks, national police office, county authorities and province governor buildings which all were, less or more, relevant to the governmental uses. In the middle of the squares itself there was regularly either a statue of the first Pahlavi or any other urban landmark. It is historically significant to figure out the first modern square in Tehran city. Most probably it has been the origin of modern squares and main pattern for the other squares in Tehran and all other Iranian cities. The main objective of this research is to discover the first modern crossing point in the new development layer of Tehran which is imposed to the traditional city. This cross point will demonstrate architecture and urban design issues related to modern and traditional developments in Iran. As Michael Web noted: “We cannot bring back the past, but we can learn from it. An older square that is an organic part of its community usually serves present needs better than a new space ordained by a planner or developer. Cities are learning to preserve, improve and adopt the squares they have, rather than opening up more. People have always enjoyed coming together, and this survey celebrates the different ways in which that impulse can be fulfilled.” (Web, 1990) Methodology This is an explanatory and case study research that focuses on the central city of Tehran within Naseri’s Fortification and its proximities. The mode of the research is historical and it explores Tehran city from the origins to the end of Modern period. It investigatealmost all the primary squares of the city in that period including Sabze Meydan, Arg, Topkhaneh, Baherstan, Mokhber-al-dole, Rah Ahan and Hassan Abad. Moving from the more general to specific observation the research explanation has basically got a deductive or top-down approach. The research approach inherently avoids any normative interpretation and deals with positive statements. In addition to time and location, the spatial characteristic has been another main component for discovering the first modern square of Tehran. Spatial characteristics, in here, include: • Land uses and functions of the squares and surroundings • Type of access and the articulation of roads and squares • Morphology, orientation and the layout of the squares • Architectural prototypes and physical-visual aspects of the squares Illustrations and texts dealing with urban space analysis and square evolutions as well as specific studies on architecture and urban design of Tehran have made the main data and materials for this research. Results and Discussion Comparing the traditional and modern factors of city squares, the first modern square of Tehran city will be hopefully discovered. Thereby, the research discusses and analyzes the first squares of Tehran city in three periods: • From establishment of the city to demolishing Tahmasbi’s fortification and the city development through Naser-Aldin Shah dynasty. The transformation of squares in Tehran through the years and toward modernization is discussed in different aspects: Land use, Access, Morphology and Architecture Style. The discussions indicate that squares are reshaped from irregular to regular shapes and are interlinked to urban vehicular streets at all. Furthermore, diagonal and defined spaces are amongst the main square characteristics in modern period. Locating new and modern land uses and widening the scale of mass and solid spaces around the squares are other distinctive changes of modern city development in Tehran. Moreover, squares are connecting to one another with regular, diagonal and linear streets while sculptures and water features are vastly added to their landscape. The architecture style in proximity of squares follows more extroverted rather than introverted development and it, in turn, reduces the enclosures of the squares. Conclusion The outcome of this research shows that Topkhaneh Square which is made during Qajar period, dynasty of Naserdin Shah, is the first square in Tehran which has acquired modern characteristics of urban spaces. The location of the square at the focal point of the city from which the city has been developed as well as the spread of modern functions including bank and telegraph offices around the square have made this segment different from all traditional squares in Iran.\n\nProblem statement: The urban view area’s extent is an arena for the classification of Tehran’s governmental and non-governmental squares creating different similarities and dissimilarities in this regard. The analysis of the similarities and dissimilarities can reveal the special and general properties of Tehran’s governmental and non-governmental squares in the urban view area. The comparative study can provide a solution for analyzing the quality and the origins of the differences between Tehran’s governmental and non-governmental squares in the urban view extent even with the existence of similarities. Adopting landscape-based approaches, the other researchers of the urban view areas have not so far made use of a comparative study in regard to Tehran’s squares. Research method: The present study has made use of a qualitative research method andit is applied research in terms of objectives. The present research paper has for the first time investigated Tehran’s governmental and non-governmental squares in the area of urban view based on a comparative research method. The study was, on the one hand, based on the library data and it was, on the other hand, drawn on the field data. Thus, after obtaining the data, the various forms and shapes used in the architectural structures and façades have been compared in terms of the arrangement at one another’s side in longitudinal and transversal proportions and the effects of these shapes have been obtained for the squares’ facades. Research objective: The present study is aimed at analyzing the quality and the origins of the differences and similarities created in the area of urban view. Conclusion: The performed analyses made it clear that the systems forming the square stemmed from the proportions between the dimensions and levels of the openings, positioning of them and façade’s geometry, which was per se influenced by the squares’ positioningand function. Although these systems may have undergone changes in the course of the history of Iranian squares, their contents have lasted till the several recent decades and can be applied as a collection of designing indices by the landscape architects and urban engineers.\n\nThe architecture of public spaces of every civilization is one of the most underlying issues determining the social identity of that age. Also, social history is a guideline for the formation and success of these spaces. For the retrieval of the lost identity of races due to preservation of historical identity sequence, one can refer to the past and reread the signs and meanings hidden in the body. Despite using coercion and seizure of public property by the state to build Naqshe-e Jahan Square in the Safavid Era, the state could make a balance between social identity and public space and the effects of which have remained to date. This study aims at analyzing the effectiveness of the Safavid Era in the transformation of the meaning of space and making a social identity for Public spaces. In other words, the study aims at analyzing the way of making social identity in the Safavid Era and its role in making favorable public space. The study has applied documentary and library methods and has employed the social history method to analyze the effects of social trends in architecture. In this way, this study has focused the theoretical analysis of Naqsh-e Jahan Square as the indicator of public space of that age. To this end, after introducing the intellectual basis of the Safavid Era, the social results obtained from these thoughts and the impact on public space architecture and its social acceptability in this age have been investigated. This study is based on the hypothesis that the political and social measures taken to make religious and cultural unity have left the most effect on making an identity for the Public spaces. The results of the study show that along with the increased authority of central government, choosing dominant religion plays a key role in creating new contexts in different sections such as art and architecture. On the other hand, belonging to Iranian history has affected the creation of a new Iranian identity. The results obtained from the study showed that the public space of the Safavid Era includes three political, religious, and geographical dimensions in terms of establishment time. Also, in terms of reasons in the social procedure, it includes three systematic physical, spatial, and constructive sections. These factors changed the public spaces of that age into spaces with unique properties, which could find social legality and identity according to space audiences, other than the governors."
