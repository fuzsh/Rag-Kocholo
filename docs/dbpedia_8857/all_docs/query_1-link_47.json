        "text": "Everyone knows that the Mongols failed to conquer Egypt and lost at Ain Jalut in 1260 but what if that had changed? What if the Mongols had more competent leadership and successfully conquered the Mamluk Sultanate like they did with the Abbasids in Iraq or the Khwarezmians in Persia? Would we see a Mongol Khanate form in a similar way to what we saw with the Illkhanate in Persia? or would Egypt be part of the Ilkhanate? . Furthermore how successful would this future Mongol Khanate centered around Egypt with Cairo as its capital be? Would it expand further into North Africa and conquer all the way to the Atlantic by conquering Morocco? Would the Mongols invade and conquer Sudan and then invade into the Horn of Africa? Would we see the Mongols invade the Sahel? . I have also heard that it is possible that Egypt would become Christian again if the Mongols won at Ain Jalut and conquered Egypt.\n\nIf the Mongols actually do invade the Sahel and conquer it then I could see some Mongol cultures developing their considering the climate of the Sahel has some similarities with the Eurasian Steppe considering both are Steppes but perhaps that is kind of stretching it . Either way let me know your thoughts on this.\n\nEven if Mongols manage to take Cairo I don't think that they are able go much further. The empire is already really seriously stretched and going further just would increase problems. And taking how soon afterwards the empire collapsed this probably wouldn't change really much beside that Mameluks probably not take power back in Egypt.\n\nAnd besides the fact that Egypt would probably suffer massive causalities like on the level that Persia and Mesopotamia did in our timeline . I could see cities like Cairo and Alexandria suffering similar causalities to Baghdad and Nishapur . It may take centuries for the Egyptian population to recover like how it took Persia and Mesopotamia a long time to recover in terms of population. The Mongol Khans of Egypt may convert to Christianity due to wanting to have trade with the Italians as well as the fact that the Mongols have Christian allies in The Levant who would have helped secure their victory in Egypt. So maybe we would see the Egyptian Khanate convert to Christianity in order to strengthen ties with their Christian allies in the Middle East and to have better trade relations with the Italians. Also a high amount of Muslims would have been killed by the Mongols from the Mongol conquest of Egypt so It is possible that the Christians could eventually outnumber them depending on how big their population decline is.\n\nAlthough I cannot really predict the long term effects of this. Perhaps we would see Egypt and The Levant become more Christian and see an Egyptian/Levantine Christian Kingdom Emerge however I do not think this would last as the Ottomans would conquer the region and spread Sunni Islam through tax incentives and Janissary stuff. I could see the Ottomans making their Christian Egyptian and Levantine population into Janissary soldiers like what we saw the Ottomans do with Christian Greeks and Bulgarians in The Balkans.\n\nI do not think the Mongols would really expand any further West into Africa than this. Sudan and the Horn of Africa is probably a no go due to geography and lack of pasture for Horses and also this was a region that the Romans and even the Arabs failed to fully conquer so I do not think the Mongols would have much more success although it could be a cool battle to remember in history like how the Mongol invasion of Vietnam went down in our timeline. Still they would be overstretched by this point and the geography of Sudan with all its desert and the Horn of Africa with its mountains don't make for the best place for a successful Mongol invasion and they would be overstretched by this point and this is also not mentioning deadly diseases that would destroy Mongol Horses especially if they advance further into the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe Mongols may have more success in North Africa but I think they would be overstretched by that point however I would not rule out the possibility of them making it to the Atlantic and conquering Morocco. Still they would probably be very overstretched at this point so I could see them stopping at Egypt.\n\nWest Africa is far too tropical with far too many diseases like sleeping sickness and tse fly which would destroy the Mongol invaders. This was a region that Europeans could not even touch until much later on with the advancement of new technology and medicine so I doubt the Mongols are going to have any success invading Western Africa. Besides they do not have a great track record invading tropical regions with lots of rainforests or jungles just look at how their conquest of Southeast Asia went out. The Sahel and Central Africa would also probably be a no go for the Mongols for a similar reason to why a Mongol invasion of West Africa would likely fail.\n\nEgypt indeed would suffer horrible losses. But I don't think that Egyptians easily would convert to Islam. Islam is not religion which would allow apostasy. And probably khans would convert to Islam since it is major religion of the country.\n\nTrue but Egypt had a very sizeable Christian minority even in the Mamluk Sultanate and there were even Coptic Christians who had high positions in the Mamluk Government . Egypt had roughly as many Christians as Muslims during this time and there were parts of Egypt which were still Christian. Also I am sure the Mongol conquest would disproportionally affect the Muslim population like what happened in the Mongol conquest of Baghdad providing the Mongols are sympathetic to the Christians in Egypt like they were to the Nestorian Christians in Mesopotamia. It would be a matter of population demographics after a while. Besides from a geopolitical standpoint there would be much more to be gained from becoming Christian considering the Mongol rulers of Egypt would be interested in trade with the Italians and Alliances with their Christian Neighbors in The Levant who were part of their successful conquest of Egypt. Converting to Christianity would make for better relations with the Crusader States or the Italians.\n\nIf the Mongol Egyptians do convert to Christianity then it is only a matter of time before the Mongol Christian rulers enforce the religion on their Muslim subjects and start persecuting Muslims and many Muslims may end up converting to avoid Persecution depending on the severity of said persecution although I am unsure how long this would last or if a majority of Egyptian Muslims would end up converting to Christianity to avoid persecution .\n\nI find the \"Egypt becomes its own khanate\" thing a bit cliche, given that it's perfectly possible to dominate Egypt from Persia as the Persian Empire did. In any case, the big change is it shifts the center of gravity for the Ilkhanate to the southwest. They might actually put their capital somewhere in modern Iraq instead of Tabriz or Soltaniyeh. But it's still a long distance, and I feel there's a high potential for restive Ilkhanate commanders and issues with the internal politics of the now-vassalised Crusader states that might often interrupt communication. It's probable that Mongol rule in Egypt ends up being more akin to that of their rule of the Sultanate of Rum, and perhaps might extensively use Europeans (at least in the coastal areas) while areas further upstream are still under the control of Muslim emirs (possibly local Egyptian notables who surrendered).\n\nThere's not much chance they go further. Makuria (in decline at this point) would likely submit and pay tribute as they had been doing to the Mamluks, but the logistics are terrible and the area not very rich. West of Egypt is a lot of mountains and desert and not really very rich land. It has been suggested that the difficulties in finding good pasture and even the stress on horses from the sun-baked landscape landscape of the Levant undermined Mongol operations in Syria and let the Mamluks win, or otherwise salvage their initial defeats into victory. Those problems are magnified in the northern fringe of the Sahara. There is also the more practical reason why they can't move further--the Ilkhanate was constantly faced with invasion and the threat of invasion from the Chagatai Khanate and the Jochids. While they could probably placate both of them by ceding the disputed lands, that would be a controversial move and might only embolden both of the rival khanates or rebel warlords within said khanates. These conflicts were ultimately why the Mongols never grabbed the Levant.\n\nAs for religion, I don't really see it strengthening the chance of a Christian Ilkhanate. The Mongol mentality favoured religions like Tibetan Buddhism and Sufism with their esoteric flair, and the Christian priests they encountered simply didn't have that. Their Islamic subjects were also the ones with the knowledge of architecture, engineering, and siegecraft and also commanded large forces of their own soldiers--Christians didn't really have that going for them. It might happen anyway, granted, but the chance is still dubious. And it wouldn't amount to much--the Mongols were religiously tolerant, even the Muslim Ilkhans. There might be Christian fanatics among them ransacking mosques and extorting Muslim merchants or imams, but they would hardly be government policy since if they stepped out of line they could easily be executed for their offenses. In any case, it was easier to persecute Christians than persecute Muslims, since the Ilkhanate's Christians were a minority and lacked the military or political power to resist.\n\nI agree this will definitely ruin Egypt for some time. Egypt grew powerful because the Crusader states were destroyed and the trade from there forcibly redirected to Egypt. Their other rival, the Ilkhanate, was always prone to civil war and eventually thoroughly collapsed and the main maritime trade routes in the Persian Gulf was closed due to extensive piracy. Thus their ports on the Red Sea increasingly became the main gateways to India, the East Indies, and China during the 13th/14th century. In addition to the destruction within the Nile Valley itself, the Mongols have no reason to favour the ports on the Red Sea compared to ports closer to Persia and might expressly destroy them because they're wealthy ports which are sheltering refugees from the Nile Valley. Europeans have no reason to care about Egypt for trade, since they'll trade through ports in the Crusader states which now will be directly linked to Persia as Mongol vassals. Since without Abu Said Bahadur Khan's death without a clear heir in 1335, the Ilkhanate could easily last another few decades, this means that Egypt might not recover for perhaps 150-200 years.\n\nLong-term, I think Egypt will end up splitting off if an ambitious emir gets his own ideas, as nearly happened to Mongol Anatolia. But they still have to consider the political difficulties of their situation, since they won't have nearly the power the Mamluks had.\n\nEveryone knows that the Mongols failed to conquer Egypt and lost at Ain Jalut in 1260 but what if that had changed? What if the Mongols had more competent leadership and successfully conquered the Mamluk Sultanate like they did with the Abbasids in Iraq or the Khwarezmians in Persia? Would we see a Mongol Khanate form in a similar way to what we saw with the Illkhanate in Persia? or would Egypt be part of the Ilkhanate? . Furthermore how successful would this future Mongol Khanate centered around Egypt with Cairo as its capital be? Would it expand further into North Africa and conquer all the way to the Atlantic by conquering Morocco? Would the Mongols invade and conquer Sudan and then invade into the Horn of Africa? Would we see the Mongols invade the Sahel? . I have also heard that it is possible that Egypt would become Christian again if the Mongols won at Ain Jalut and conquered Egypt.\n\nIf the Mongols actually do invade the Sahel and conquer it then I could see some Mongol cultures developing their considering the climate of the Sahel has some similarities with the Eurasian Steppe considering both are Steppes but perhaps that is kind of stretching it . Either way let me know your thoughts on this.View attachment 909654\n\nThe whole premise is not realistic.\n\nTo start with, the Mongolian force at Ain Jalut was a small contingent, commander of which got overly self-assured and tried to conquer Syria, not Egypt, while Hulagu with the main army was in Mongolia. By the time of a battle he had only between 10 and 20,000 troops, which would be absolutely inadequate for the task even if we disregard the losses and logistical issues. Even if the battle was won, he had to wait for Hulagu to return with the main army and here comes the second problem.\n\nHulagu conquered Persia with the forces borrowed to him by Batu while Mongke (Batu’s personal friend) was the Great Khan. Situation changed on a number of accounts:\n\n1st, Batu was dead and the GH wad ruled by Berke, a devoted Muslim who was pissed off with a sack of Baghdad and recalled his contingents. Moreover, he made an alliance with Sultan Qutuz and later Sultan Baibars of Egypt.\n\n2nd, after Hulagu returned from Mongolia in 1262, there was Berke-Hulagu war on the Northern Caucasus, which Hulagu lost with the terrible losses but the lesser military and political activities kept going on all the way till Hulagu’s and Berke’s deaths.\n\n3rd, in OTL, with the repeated attempts to expend southward, Hulagu and his successors could not even hold Syria (one of the theories was that there were too little of a pasture land there to support a permanent significant Mongolian presence).\n\nQuite possible conquer later, though Mamluks were fairly effective. In terms of Ikhanate capital, they will want to be near nomad lands. OTL Tabriz. ATL I would suggest Mosul as capital as Al Jazira was a major winter grazing area for the Turkic nomads of Greater Azerbaijan and Eastern Anatolia.\n\nUnless the Mamluk state completely disintegrates, Ilkhanate is not in a good position to conduct such a conquest being busy all the way to the 1270s with the wars against GH and Chagatai Khanate followed by the defeats by Mamluks in 1277 and 1281 followed by the internal fighting in 1282-86 followed by more domestic troubles in the 1290s and repeated defeats by the Mamluks. So, to make a meaningful connection between the premise of the OP and its assumed result we’d have to assume that at Ain Jalut Kitbuga manages to completely eliminate pretty much all existing Mamluk forces while not suffering noticeable losses himself and then proceed all the way to Egypt not facing any opposition, not having any logistical problems, etc. And within Egypt to conquer at least a big part of the Lower Egypt with the force available and to keep it, plus Syria, for at least two years waiting for Hulagu to come back. Well, and of course, Berke not starting war with Hulagu. Now, how plausible this scenario looks like?\n\nIt is popular to make Ain Jalut into some critical event, which it hardly was if taken within context pf the contemporary framework and not in a complete isolation. And the same goes for the related geography: Ain Jalut is not “Egypt” and Ilkhanate during its whole existence could not even get a serious foothold in Syria.\n\nAs for your capital proposal, it sounds quite reasonable but, as you know, it is far away from the intended goal of the conquest and does not really resolve the grazing problem in Syria region."
