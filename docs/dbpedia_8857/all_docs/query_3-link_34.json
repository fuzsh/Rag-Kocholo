        "text": "Persia, the historical name of nowadays Iran, comes from the Greek word \"Parsa\" (a region in southwestern Iran now called Fars province) first used by Alexander The Great after invading the region. It was in 1935 that Reza Shah Pahlavi asked foreign delegates to use the name 'Iran', derived from 'ērān', a term originally used in 3rd-century Sassanid dynasty referring to lands inhabited by Aryans.\n\nIran was once the heart of the Persian empire with great dynasties such as the Achaemenids (559-330 BC), Savafid period and Qajar that all left their historical marks. Throughout the centuries the capital changed from Shiraz, Qazvin or Isfahan to nowadays Tehran. Lots of historical buildings and gardens remind us of the great cultural past these empires once had, and many of them are now on the UNESCO heritage list - with some still waiting to be recognised."
