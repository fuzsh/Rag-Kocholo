        "text": "Since the early years of civilization, temples have long served an important role in not only the fabric of countless religions but also the livelihood of communities.\n\nThese magnificent structures offer spiritual solace and showcase architectural marvels that stand as testaments to bygone eras. Whether you seek enlightenment or simply admire architectural wonders, temples are a must-visit on your travel itinerary.\n\nSituated in the illustrious Zanjan province, the historic city of Soltaniyeh boasts a wealth of cultural treasures, including the famed Dashkasan Temple, also known as the Dragon Monument.\n\nThe Dashkasan Temple features intricate carvings, including two prominent dragon motifs, showcasing the influence of Far Eastern cultures during the Ilkhanid era.\n\nRegistered as one of Iran's national monuments, this temple is a rare gem that captivates visitors with its historical and artistic significance. Read on to learn everything you need to know about the enigmatic Dashkasan Temple.\n\nAbout Dashkasan Temple\n\nThe Dashkasan Temple, also known as the Temple of the Dragon, is a remarkable rock building situated on the outskirts of Vir Village, approximately 15 kilometers southeast of the historic city of Soltaniyeh in Zanjan Province. Dating back to the Ilkhanid period, this stone temple holds significant cultural and historical importance.\n\nThe name \"Dashkasan\" translates to \"stonemason\" in Azeri, reflecting the craftsmanship involved in its construction. It is alternatively referred to as the Dragon Temple and was officially recognized as one of Iran's national monuments in 1974.\n\nThe temple features two prominent dragon motifs, intricately carved on both sides in symmetrical fashion. These reliefs, depicting dragons, are rare in Iranian art and bear the influence of Far Eastern cultures such as Mongolia and China, which had an impact during the Ilkhanid era. Some speculate that the temple existed prior to Islam and that the dragon motifs were added during the Ilkhanid period.\n\nAlthough the original structure has undergone changes over time, remnants of the temple can still be observed, with large scattered stones found in the temple's corners. Several dragon statues are scattered throughout the temple area, adding to its allure.\n\nVisitors can explore the temple and witness its unique blend of architectural styles and artistic expressions.\n\n| Read more: Fire Temple - The Holy Places Where Zoroastrians Worship God\n\nHistory of Dashkasan Temple\n\nAccording to the beliefs of some archaeologists, the origins of this structure date back to before the Islamic era when it served as a place of worship for followers of the Mithraic religion. However, no traces remain from that period.\n\nThe current building, on the other hand, belongs to the Ilkhanate period when they ruled Iran approximately 700 years ago. After the death of Arghun Shah, a Mongol ruler, Eljai Khatun, the sister of Sultan Mohammad Khodabandeh, ordered the construction of this building. However, the construction of this structure never reached completion.\n\nThe exact reason for this is unclear, but some believe that the order to build this structure was given before the Mongol ruler converted to Islam, and after the Ilkhanids embraced Islam, the construction of this building was halted.\n\nThe most significant architectural feature, the prominent dragon reliefs, were created during the Ilkhanid period. In addition to the prominent dragon reliefs, all other decorations in the temple were also created during the Ilkhanid era.\n\n| Discover: Temple of Anahita - A Temple of an Ancient Iranian Goddess\n\nWhy is the Temple Decorated with Dragon Motifs?\n\nWhen you see Dash Kasan for the first time, you might think you've stepped into China because dragons are a well-known symbol in Chinese culture.\n\nThe Dashkasan Temple's decoration with dragon motifs may give the impression that it was built by the Chinese. However, in reality, this structure is one of the prominent artifacts of the Ilkhanid period, beautifully carved by the renowned artists of that era amidst the mountains.\n\nIn Chinese culture, the dragon is a symbol of power, blessings, and happiness. The kings of the past were also greatly fascinated by power. Perhaps that's why the order to engrave these carvings was issued in the heart of this ancient site.\n\nLegends of Dashkasan Temple\n\nThere are numerous legends surrounding this site among the locals of the region. The residents of the village of Vir call the Dashkasan temple \"Shirin and Farhad.\"\n\nIn ancient Iranian mythology, Farhad is known as a stone breaker who had a great love for Shirin. That's why this place has gained fame as \"Shirin and Farhad.\"\n\nHowever, the main reason behind the name Dashkasan for this structure is that it was once a stone mine. When the workers were busy cutting the stones, suddenly beautiful patterns would emerge from the heart of the rocks.\n\n| Also read about: Bisotun - One of the World's Biggest Rock Reliefs\n\nDashkasan Temple Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Dashkasan Temple combines elements of Iranian and Chinese styles in a masterful way. The stone temple is regarded as one of the most prominent examples of rock architecture in Iran.\n\nIts most notable feature, which sets it apart in the country, is the prominent relief carvings of two dragons. These symmetrically created dragon reliefs captivate the attention of enthusiasts of unique architectural styles.\n\nLongitudinal symmetry is one of the fundamental principles emphasized in the construction of the temple and is palpable throughout the entire structure. The dragon reliefs have a length of five meters and a width of 1.5 meters, and the design of the mihrab (prayer niche) with its Islamic and arabesque patterns alongside these two dragons is also eye-catching.\n\nThree arches in the western and eastern parts of the temple have been created within the heart of the rock, adorned with beautiful muqarnas (stalactite) decorations.\n\nPatterns with various designs, one of the main symbols of Iranian art, can also be observed in these arches. It appears that the design and creation of these patterns were influenced by the social conditions in Iran during the 8th century.\n\nDashkasan Temple is composed of several courtyards and ancient premises, and prominent relief carvings can be found throughout the site. All these features have come together, making Dashkasan a unique masterpiece. Additionally, within the temple complex, three deep and narrow caves are visible, which likely served as dwellings or storage spaces.\n\nIt seems that in the construction of this temple, the most advanced stone-cutting technologies with metal tools available at that time were employed. The careful selection of the most suitable location for constructing this temple, among the other areas in the region, indicates the extensive geological knowledge possessed by the builders of this structure.\n\nIt is also likely that the stonemasons employed some principles of stonework in their craftsmanship. The temple complex is rectangular, with dimensions ranging from 50 to 100 meters, and a portion of it has been excavated on a hill.\n\n| Suggestion: Naqsh-e Rustam\n\nDashkasan Temple Location\n\nDashkasan Temple, which is considered one of the tourist attractions of Sultanieh, is located approximately five kilometers from Vir Village and 15 kilometers northeast of Sultanieh.\n\nThe distance between the village and the temple is a smooth dirt road that can be easily traveled by regular vehicles; however, there are no signs along this route, so it is better to seek guidance from local people to reach the temple.\n\nHow to Get to the Dashkasan Temple\n\nTo reach Dash Kasan Temple, you need to travel to Zanjan province.
