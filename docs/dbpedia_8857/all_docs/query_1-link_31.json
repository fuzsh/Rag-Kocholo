Ilkhanate tomb (Ilkhanate = Mongol-era and of the Il-khanate, a portion or division of the vast Mongol empire in the early 14th cent. which includes Iran) is the greatest surviving Ilkhanate building, and is capped by the largest dome (49 m.s in height) built by 1312 (the date of its completion) in the Islamic world.  Built in only 10 years (1302-12) here in Oljeitu's new capital (replacing Tabriz), it's claimed to have been an inspiration for Brunelleschi in his design of the later and much taller dome (114 m.s in height) of the Duomo in Florence, and to have anticipated the Taj Mahal.   \n\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/27784269@N06/3072389722/\">www.flickr.com/photos/27784269@N06/3072389722/</a>\n\t<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/rocor/465840311/\">www.flickr.com/photos/rocor/465840311/</a> \n\tIs the dome here at Soltaniyeh the world's oldest double dome?

The first high dome built on a square base dates from the 3rd cent. and still stands today in the palace of Ardeshir Papakan near Firuzabad.
