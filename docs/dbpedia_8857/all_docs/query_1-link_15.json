'people or state of Hülegü'),[9] was a Mongol khanate founded in the southwestern territories of the Mongol Empire. The Ilkhanid realm was officially known as the Land of Iran or simply Iran.[10][11] It was established after Hülegü, the son of Tolui and grandson of Genghis Khan, inherited the West Asian and Central Asian part of the Mongol Empire after his brother Möngke Khan died in 1259.\n\nQuick Facts Land of Iranایران‌زمین, Status ...\n\nClose\n\nThe Ilkhanate's core territory lies in what is now the countries of Iran, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. At its greatest extent, the Ilkhanate also included parts of modern Iraq, Syria, Armenia, Georgia, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, part of modern Dagestan, and part of modern Tajikistan. Later Ilkhanid rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, converted to Islam. In the 1330s, the Ilkhanate was ravaged by the Black Death. The last ilkhan, Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan, died in 1335, after which the Ilkhanate disintegrated."
