It was established in the 13th century and was based primarily in Iran as well as neighboring territories, such as present-day Azerbaijan, and the central and eastern parts of present-day Turkey. In its fullest extent, the state expanded into territories which today comprise most of Iran, Iraq, Turkmenistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey, western Afghanistan and southwestern Pakistan. Later Ilkhanate rulers, beginning with Ghazan in 1295, would convert to Islam.\n\nGhazan[]\n\nMahmud Ghazan was the seventh ruler of the Mongol Empire's Ilkhanate division in modern-day Iran from 1295 to 1304. He was the son of Arghun and Quthluq Khatun, continuing a long line of rulers who were direct descendants of Genghis Khan. Considered the most prominent of the Ilkhans, he is best known for making a political conversion to Islam in 1295 when he took the throne, marking a turning point for the dominant religion of Mongols in West Asia (Iran, Iraq, Anatolia and Trans-Caucassia).\n\nDawn of Man[]\n\nHail Ilkhan Ghazan of the house of Hulagu, seventh ruler of the Subordinate Khanate. The Ilkhanate was formed through great terror, as the Mongol hordes swept through Iran, Iraq and Syria; the utter destruction of Baghdad being the greatest testament of the destructive power of the Mongols. You, however, was no mindless brute. A man of high culture and able reformer, you had a great lasting legacy not only for converting the Ilkhanate to Islam but also due to your sweeping reforms in the economy, military and civil services of the Ilkhanate.\n\nOh distinguished Ilkhan, the once mighty Mongol empire has crumbled and dissipated, its legacy long gone. However, the Great Khans of Mongolia once more yearn for greatness and have entrusted upon you to claim the lands all the way from Balkh to Egypt! Will you fulfill your duties to the Great Khan? Can you conquer a civilization to stand the test of time?\n\nIntroduction: What business do you have in the lands of the house of Hulagu? Have you come to surrender yourself and your petty empire to the Great Khan?\n\nDefeat: I am defeated. Regardless, your empire will never be as powerful as the Great Khanate was in its apogee; you will forever live in its shadow.\n\nStrategy[]\n\nUnique Attributes[]\n\nIlkhanate (Ghazan)\n\nThe Siege of Baghdad\n\nUpon capturing an enemy Capital, all population is killed and all normal buildings destroyed.
