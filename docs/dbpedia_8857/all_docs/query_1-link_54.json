The main building and garden both underwent extensive renovations in 2004–05, and prior to that, many water paths and ponds were added in 1984.\n\nThe museum started life in 1931 as the private villa and garden of Ahmad Amir-Ahmadi, lieutenant-general of Shah Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, Turan Mohajer Eslami. The original garden design was completely different from what it is now.\n\nMain entrance gate, Copyright M.samei, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nAfter the Shah was deposed and mullahs took over, the garden became a public park. Later, Khaneh Cinema, Iran’s largest trade union of cinematographers, took ownership. Only in 2005, after the renovations were finished, did the house and garden finally become a museum.\n\nMany of the miniatures were created by Italian artisans for the 1971 Celebration of the 2,500th Anniversary of the Founding of the Persian Empire, which showcased Iran’s ancient history and modern achievements to the world. They were made of concrete, with polyester and resin for the windows. Some of the miniatures were beautified by oil paint.\n\nSt. Thaddeus Monastery (also called Qara Church), Copyright M.samei, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nIn addition to the miniatures, the garden also contains contemporary Iranian sculptures, a photo exhibition, and artwork on some of the park walls. The indoor gallery houses paintings and handicrafts. Sometimes there are lectures and training workshops on contemporary arts and handicrafts, plus film screenings.\n\nIn addition to art, visitors can also enjoy great food in a beautiful, traditionally-designed café and purchase handicrafts from a gift shop.\n\nDome of Soltaniyeh, Copyright M.samei, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nThe miniature models in the garden depict:\n\nHasht Behesht Palace and Chehlsetun Palace of Isfahan\n\nTehran’s Azadi Tower and Milad Tower\n\nSt. Thaddeus Monastery, also called Qare Kelisa, or the Black Church, of West Azerbaijan Province, affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh, a complex of ruins with the mausoleum of Mongol ruler Öljaitü at its center\n\nFin Garden of Kashan, completed in 1590 and Iran’s oldest known surviving Persian garden\n\nGonbad-e Qabus Tower, Copyright M. samei, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nGonbad-e Qabus Tower, the burial place of Qabus ibn Wushmagir, who ruled the city of Gorgan and the Tabaristan Region from 977–981 and 997–1012\n\nAllahvardi Khan Bridge, more commonly known as Siosepol (literally, “The Bridge of 33 [Spans]”), the largest of the eleven bridges over the Zayande River, in Isfahan\n\nMahyar Caravanserai of Shahreza in Isfahan Province. In addition to the caravanserai itself (a lodging building for travellers on caravans), it also includes a bakery, bazaar, mosque, and coffeehouse.\n\nNaqsh-e Rostam, an ancient archaeological site and necropolis in Marvdasht, dating back to 1000 BCE and the Elamite civilisation.

It was first identified as his burial place by Benjamin of Tudela, a 12th century Jewish travelogue writer who widely travelled through Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis was my twelfth year doing the A to Z Challenge, and my tenth with two blogs. For the fifth year, I only began researching, writing, and editing my posts in March. Not only that, I waited until the second half of March to begin. One of the gifts for winning NaNo 2022 was a free title setup from IngramSpark, and though I knew I had no chance of coming anywhere close to finishing my radical rewrite of my WIP by 15 March, I just had to see how much I could accomplish by the deadline.\n\nIn years prior, I put my posts together many months in advance, sometimes as early as July and August. My initial plan was to research, write, and edit my posts in December 2022, due to the promised threat of the classic WordPress editor being retired on the last day of that year. However, to everyone’s great relief, the classic editor will be retained through at least 2024. Thus, I was able to push off my posts for a few more months.\n\nMany times, I seriously considered doing a far less intensive theme on account of how little time I had left to complete 52 posts. But though I have ten lists in progress for future themes, none of them felt right in the face of what’s going on in Iran, and my near-lifelong personal connection to the Iranian people. All my other themes seemed so superficial in comparison.\n\nI’m really glad I stayed with my original theme planned for 2023, even though I had to work overtime and started having daily tension headaches from the stress. I needed a long time to decompress, and didn’t write my final four posts for my main blog till the last week of April. After that, I needed to decompress all over again!\n\nTopics I considered but crossed off my list were the Caspian Sea, the cities of Jahrom and Lahijan, Safi al-Din al-Urmawi, Zoroastrianism, Al-Farabi, Mohammad-Ali Jamalzad, Persian gardens, Ganjali Khan Complex, Zeynab Begum, Zhaleh Alamtaj, Arg-e Bam, the University of Isfahan, and Abdolhossein Teymourtash. I also began a post about the Iranian Art Museum Garden, but put it into my drafts folder when it became obvious there just wasn’t enough information for the kind of detail-rich post I like to write. You’ll be seeing it at some point in future.\n\nThe trickiest letters were L, O, U, and I. Surprisingly, despite their inclusion in the Persian alphabet, not many people, places, or things start with those letters. I also couldn’t do the most obvious I topic, Isfahan, since I already did a post about it in 2014. Though when I reviewed that old post, I realized I could’ve easily redone it with a lot more historical details.\n\nSince the ongoing uprising in Iran was set off by the torture and murder of Mahsa Amini in police custody, and came after years of campaigns and protests against compulsory hijab laws, I felt it was important for my posts about people to exclusively feature women. The cry of protest is also “Women, Life, Freedom,” Zan, Zendegi, Azadi, زن ز​ن​د​گ​ی آ​ز​ا​د​ی.\n\nMany of the materials I read for my research had to be translated from Persian, and a few times I had to transliterate names that just didn’t seem right (e.g., Lily and Victoria). The latter involved finding the right place in the original Persian lines where the names occurred. I also had to do this with a few sources translated from Arabic.\n\nAnother difficulty in translation was that Persian doesn’t have grammatical gender. I have no problem with this in and of itself, but the translations followed the archaic “generic he” convention and referred to women by male pronouns! And since Persian only has one word for a spouse, these women’s husbands were referred to as their wives! Context apparently doesn’t exist in Google translations.\n\nPost recap:\n\nDr. Azar Andami (دُکتُر آذر اندامی)\n\nBibi Khanoom Astarabadi (بی بی خانم استرآبادی)\n\nChaharshanbe Suri (چهارشنبه‌سوری)\n\nSediqeh Dowlatabadi (صدیقه دولتآبادی)\n\nParvin E’tesami (پروین اعتصامی)\n\nDr. Farrokhroo Parsa (دکتر فرخ‌رو پارسا)\n\nGolestan Palace (کاخ گلستان)\n\nHamadan, Iran (همدان, ایران)\n\nIranian Armenians (ارمنی‌های ایران, իրանահայեր)\n\nJewish Iran (ایران یهودی)\n\nKermanshah, Iran (کرمانشاه, ایران)\n\nLayla and Majnun (لیلی و مجنون)\n\nMariam Behnam (مریم بهنام)\n\nNowruz (نوروز)\n\nOsku, Iran (اسكو, ایران)\n\nPersian cuisine (غذاهای ایرانی)\n\nQazvin, Iran (قزوین, ایران)\n\nRasht, Iran (رشت, ایران)\n\nSimin Daneshvar (سیمین دانشور)\n\nTabriz, Iran (تبریز, ایران)\n\nUrmia, Iran (ارومیه, ایران)\n\nVank Cathedral (Սուրբ Ամենափրկիչ Վանք, کلیسای آمناپرکیچ)\n\nWeddings in Iran (عروسی در ایران)\n\nXenial Iran (زنیا در ایران)\n\nYazd, Iran (یزد, ایران)\n\nZahra Khanom Tadj al-Saltaneh (تاج‌السلطنه)\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nMy WeWriWa post is here.\n\nZahra Khanom Tadj al-Saltaneh was born in late 1884 in Tehran. Her father was Shah Naser al-Din, the fourth Qajar Shah, and her mother was Princess Mariam Touran al-Sultaneh. Needless to say, she came from a long line of illustrious relatives and ancestors on both sides. She had two full siblings, Ahmad and Farah, and at least 39 halfsiblings.\n\nAs typical for a royal child of that era, Zahra’s education began at age seven and was limited to court customs instead of actual academics. She only saw her mother twice a day, and was primarily raised by her tutor and governess. When her father was in Tehran, Zahra usually went to see him once a day.\n\nIn early 1893, at age eight, Zahra was betrothed to aristocrat Hasan Khan Sardar Shojah al-Saltaneh, who was probably eleven or twelve. His father was Defence Minister Shojah al-Saltaneh. Zahra and Hasan were officially married in December 1893, though the formal wedding ceremony was postponed until 1897, when Zahra was twelve.\n\nThe formal ceremony had to be postponed so long not just on account of the couple’s very young ages, but also because Shah Naser al-Din was assassinated on 1 May 1896. A mourning period was necessitated, and that included no weddings.\n\nShah Naser al-Din lying in state\n\nZahra’s education was interrupted by her betrothal, but her studies eventually resumed. She was tutored in Persian and European history and literature, painting, piano, tar (a long-necked lute primarily played in Central Asia and Transcaucasia), Arabic, French, and embroidery.\n\nAfter her father’s assassination, the ladies and girls of the court were ordered to leave the royal harem and taken to the city of Sarostan. Zahra lived like a prisoner during this time, and was eager to escape the strict confines and isolation of harem life through marriage. She felt being a married woman might give her some measure of independence.\n\nAlas, Zahra and Hasan weren’t blessed with a happy marriage, and failed to grow to love one another like some other couples in arranged marriages. Zahra wasn’t prepared for the reality of sex, and Hasan began neglecting her almost immediately after their wedding night. Hasan also cheated with both men and women.\n\nZahra and Hasan had four children, two boys and two girls. One of their sons died in infancy, and another pregnancy ended in a dangerous abortion after Zahra discovered Hasan had an STD (probably gonorrhea or syphilis). Zahra was afraid she might die in childbirth, and before antibiotics, STDs were notorious for ravaging women’s reproductive systems and causing serious birth defects, even stillbirth. Islam, like Judaism, has always permitted abortion when the woman’s life is in danger.\n\nZahra was diagnosed as hysterical from the mental and physical damage of this procedure, though instead of committing her to a hospital or strict rest at home, the doctors prescribed a sightseeing tour.\n\nIn December 1907, Zahra divorced Hasan. She was one of the very first royal women to do such a thing, which violated a traditional taboo. In March 1908, she remarried to Qoller Aghabashi, the nephew of prominent government figure Hossein Pasha Khan Amir Bahadur Jan.\n\nUncle Hossein wasn’t exactly pleased by this marriage, and pressured Qoller to get a divorce. In addition to the scandal of marrying a divorcée, he’d also heard this marriage had been arranged by the Patriotic Women’s League of Iran. These women were active in campaigning for greater rights for their sex, such as education, literacy, political representation, and legal rights. Zahra was also a member of this group.\n\nBoard of directors of Jam’iyat-e Nesvan-e Vatankhah (Patriotic Women’s League of Iran), 1922–32\n\nUncle Hossein got his way, and the marriage ended in July. Zahra remarried in 1909, to Rukn al-Sultaneh. There’s no known information about the fate of this third marriage, but Zahra was describing herself as single by 1921.\n\nIn addition to her membership in the Patriotic Women’s League of Iran, Zahra belonged to the underground Women’s Freedom Association, which was founded in 1907, and led a women’s march to Parliament during the Constitutional Revolution. She also hosted weekly literary salons at her home and was the very first royal woman to wear Western clothes and go unveiled.\n\nIn 1914, Zahra wrote a memoir with a scathing critique of court life, monarchy, slavery, the treatment of women, arranged marriage, classism, religious fundamentalism, everything keeping Persia centuries behind the developed world. However, her memoirs weren’t published until 1996, and parts of her original handwritten text are still missing.\n\nZahra died on 25 January 1936, aged 51. She’s buried in Zahir-od-Dowleh Cemetery in Darband. To this day, Zahra is celebrated as a feminist icon.\n\nThanks to the tireless trailblazing work of Zahra and her fellow feminists, Iranian women eventually gained the same rights many modern Western women seem to take for granted. After 1979, Iranian women fought to regain their rights and participate in public life under the restrictions of Islamic theocracy.\n\nNow the women of Iran are once more rising up to demand their rights and throwing off their chains.

Yazd is also full of cisterns, underground aqueducts, icehouses, and Zoroastrian fire temples.\n\nYazd is also known as the City of Bicycles, the City of Sunshine, and the City of Sweets. It boasts the highest number of bicyclists per capita in Iran, and has a very long, storied history of that mode of transportation. Reportedly, the city’s love affair with the bicycle began after locals encountered many European tourists on bikes.\n\nThe city’s name means “holy, pure, clean.”\n\nOld Town, Copyright Philipp Bock\n\nYazd has been occupied continuously since at least the Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BCE). Prior to assuming its current name, the city was also known as Issatis, Ketrava, Izatikha, Katha, Dar al-Mominim, Dal al-Abada, Dal al-Alam, Dal al-Shia, Dal al-Siadeh, Farafar, Herfat, Yazdan Shahr, Yazdan Gard, Yasdi, Yaks, and many other names.\n\nYazd and her environs began rising to prominence during the Sasanian Empire (224–651 CE). Many of the Sasanid kings and their children were instrumental in developing the area through creating villages and constructing important buildings.\n\nMoshir Caravanserai, Copyright Parastoo.Atrsaei, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nAfter the 7th century Islamic conquest of Persia, many Zoroastrians moved to Yazd. The city was able to retain its majority religion by paying a levy. Though Islam eventually became Yazd’s primary faith, that only happened very gradually, and the city still has a sizable Zoroastrian community of about 20,000–40,000.\n\nYazd escaped the brutal terror wrought by the Mongols in the 13th century on account of its remote desert location and the cleverness of Sultan Qutb al-Din Eshghi. Many people fled to Yazd after their cities and towns were destroyed or occupied.\n\nShahi Bazaar, Copyright Dardodel, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nThe city enjoyed relative security and peace during the Mongol period, and a flourishing new trade route with India led to greatly increased commercial and cultural development and prosperity.\n\nThe construction and expansion of roads brought the Arabian Muzafar family to Yazd after the Mongols invaded their native region of Khorasan. They took advantage of the situation when the Mongol Ilkhanate fell apart in the 14th century, and established themselves as the new ruling dynasty of Persia.\n\nThough Yazd only served as their capital for a short while, the city nevertheless gained a lot of prestige, importance, prosperity, and cultural capital from its association with the Muzafarids. Education, particularly scientific education, also flourished during this time.\n\nAmir Chakhmaq Complex, Copyright Hadi Karimi, Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\n\nCopyright Sasha India\n\nTamerlane defeated the Muzafarids in 1393 and gave Yazd to one of his agents. When he returned to Transoxiana (a region in lower Central Asia), the people took advantage of popular sympathy for the Muzafarids and wrested back control of Yazd. Sultan Mohammed then captured the city and declared its independence.\n\nTamerlane’s thugs marched on Yazd to try to regain order, but their attacks failed. Then a huge army, led by Tamerlane’s grandson Pir Muhammad, swooped in and surrounded Yazd from all sides. The city finally fell to her enemies.\n\nTower of Silence cistern, Copyright Bernard Gagnon\n\nTower of Silence yard, Copyright Adam Jones\n\nDespite being under foreign occupation, Yazd continued soaring to great heights with the creation of many important schools and libraries, and the beautiful tilework added to many mosques.\n\nMore chaos followed during the establishment of the Safavid Dynasty in the early 16th century. Many rulers were scattered through Persia, which Shah Ismail I wanted to put a stop to. Before long, Yazd fell to the empire’s new supreme ruler, but not before a series of senseless murders and bloody battles.\n\nCopyright Wojciech Kocot, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nDuring the Safavid Era, Yazd gained even more prosperity and importance on account of its excellent silk and textile industries, as well as its cake position on trade routes between India and Europe.\n\nThe people of Yazd, led by Mirza Inayat Sultan Bafqi, bravely resisted when Mahmud Hotak of Afghanistan, who had his eyes on the Persian throne, besieged their city in 1722. His attempts to take Yazd failed, and he turned his attentions towards conquering Isfahan instead. He became Shah in 1722.\n\nFire Temple, Copyright Maziart, Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\n\nDetail on top of Fire Temple, Copyright R.shahi24, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nMahmud’s successor, Ashraf Hotak, waged a four-year battle for Yazd and murdered all but two of Inayat Sultan’s descendants through trickery. Finally, in 1729, the forces of Nader Shah Afshar drove the Afghans out of Persia.\n\nAfter all the chaos and violence of being passed through so many rival hands, a measure of peace and stability returned to Yazd during the Qajar Dynasty (1789–1925). Many marvellous buildings were constructed, and the textile, carpet, ceramics, and tile industries thrived.\n\nMain dome of Jameh Mosque, Copyright Bernard Gagnon\n\nJameh Mosque minarets, Copyright Ali Karimzadeh 1355, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nYazd’s many historical landmarks include gardens, bazaars, mosques, mansions, city squares, Zoroastrian temples, bathhouses, tombs, schools, reservoirs, aqueducts, shrines, citadels, houses of famous people, windcatchers, and icehouses. The oldest known surviving building is Davazdah Imam, an 11th century mausoleum and shrine.\n\nOne of the city’s Zoroastrian temples has a fire which has been kept continuously burning since 470 CE. There’s also a museum dedicated to Zoroastrian art, history, and culture.\n\nYazd is one of the world’s largest cities built entirely of adobe.\n\nZoroastrian cemetery, Copyright Petr Adam Dohnálek\n\nYazd is also renowned for its legendary sweets. Many confectionaries have been private family businesses for generations, and master confectioners keep their recipes top-secret.\n\nYazdi sweets include qottab (a deep-fried cake stuffed with almonds), baklava, pashmak (cotton candy), sohan (wheat germ halvah), lovuez (diamond-shaped sweets made of almond flour, sugar, saffron, and various nuts), nan-e berenji (rice flour cookies), haji badam (cookies made of chickpea flour and nutmeg), and Yazdi cake (made with yoghurt, milk, and cardamom).\n\nJameh Mosque, Copyright Liana.yazd, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nNote: The Persian title of this post actually translates as “Xenia in Iran,” since I couldn’t find a Persian translation of the million-dollar adjective “xenial.”\n\nCopyright Mehr News Agency, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nXenia is a code of hospitality originating in Ancient Greece, and is sometimes translated as “guest-friendship” or “ritualized friendship.” It’s the root of the million-dollar English adjective xenial, hospitable. Ultimately, it comes from xenos (stranger), itself the root of more familiar words like xenophobic and xenophile, and other words including xenograft, xenoblast, xenolithic, xenobiotic, xenogamy, and xenogeny.\n\nFor the Greeks, xenia wasn’t just a nice thing to do or the right thing to do, but a sacred moral obligation. This above and beyond commitment to welcoming the stranger and honouring guests is also deeply engrained in Persian culture.\n\nCaravanserai (inn for caravans) at Rasht, ca. 1890\n\nIt’s not uncommon for newcomers, tourists, and visitors to be invited to the house of someone they just met for tea, a meal, or even to stay overnight. Nothing but the best food and drink will do for honouring guests, even if the residents of the house have to go without and give up the last of their victuals.\n\nIranians also frequently invite people they just met to weddings, holiday celebrations, and religious or cultural ceremonies at the last minute. The unexpected, unplanned guests are treated like VIPs.\n\nMountaintop shelter for hikers in Amiri, Copyright Babak Nabizadeh, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported\n\nPeople come swarming to help if they see someone looking at a map, and someone who looks hungry or thirsty is immediately invited for tea and a good meal. Friendly smiles and conversations are everywhere, even if a tourist doesn’t know much Persian and the locals don’t know many words in English or other languages.\n\nAnd if someone of a certain age says s/he’s single, people immediately begin suggesting potential mates. As compared to the West, there’s no sense of “You’re on your own for finding a partner.” A host might even suggest someone in her or his own family!\n\nThere’s a Persian saying that “Guests are God’s friends.” People don’t distinguish between nationalities, ethnicities, or religions. All that matters is showing honour and reverence to guests, be they Iranians from another city, Kurds, Armenians, Assyrians, Balochis, Luris, or tourists without any connection to the land.\n\nAt a meal, guests quickly become acquainted with taarof, wherein a host offers anything a guest might want (food, drink, seat around the table, bed). In turn, the guest is just as obligated to refuse out of politeness. This back-and-forth continues several times until they come to a mutual agreement.\n\nTaarof also involves insisting on a guest having a constantly full plate and glass, and eating multiple servings. Since a guest can’t come right out and say s/he wants more, s/he has to pretend to be full. More back-and-forth follows, culminating in the guest finally cracking and agreeing to have more food.\n\nAbbasi Hotel, one of Iran’s most beautiful\n\nMany Iranians rent their homes to visitors, and there are also many guesthouses, hostels, and hotels where every need and want of the traveller is seen to. No one ever lacks for anything. Even tiny hamlets in the middle of nowhere go above and beyond in honouring guests and giving them the very best of what’s available.\n\nThe Persian word for guest, mehman (also transliterated as mihman), derives from the Ancient Avestan root maandan (staying). Even houses are traditionally built with a special room for guests, a room which is larger and more ornate than the family’s private rooms.\n\nTea is the very first thing served to every guest. Copyright http://persianfoodtours.com; Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n\nThe Persian tradition of xenia hasn’t changed one iota since the mullahs took over in 1979, even though the annual number of tourists has significantly decreased. Despite what the media portrays, the vast majority of Iranians are friendly, warm, welcoming, kind people.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
