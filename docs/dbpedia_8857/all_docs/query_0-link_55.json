This architectural masterpiece is approximately 240 kilometers west of Tehran, offering visitors a captivating glimpse into the grandeur of the Ilkhanid dynasty and Persian medieval architecture.\n\nHistory of the Dome of Soltaniyeh\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh is situated in the city of Soltaniyeh, once a vast plain used for leisure and hunting. Arghun Khan, the fourth emperor of the Mongol Ilkhanate, decided to establish the city of Soltaniyeh as his residence. During the Ilkhanid period, this city became the third capital after Maragheh and Tabriz.\n\nThe construction of the Dome of Soltaniyeh took place between 1302 and 1312 AD, under the rule of Sultan Mohammed Khodabandeh, also known as Öljaitü. He was the eighth Mongol ruler. Originally, Öljaitü followed Shamanism, a traditional belief system of some early tribes, which still has followers today. Influenced by his mother, he later converted to Christianity and adopted the name Nicholas (Nicolo).\n\nSoon after his conversion, Öljaitü fell ill and changed his name to “Kharbanda.” This change was due to a superstition among the Mongols, who believed that the power of the letters in a name (according to Abjad numerology) was crucial. The name “Kharbanda” was considered to hold special significance, equivalent to “the special shadow of the Creator.”\n\nTaj al-Din Ali Shah is mentioned in some inscriptions as the architect of the Dome. Over 3,000 workers were involved in its construction, with Khwaja Rashid al-Din Fazlullah Hamadani, the Sultan’s minister, overseeing the design and construction.\n\nIn 1969, an Italian team began restoring the Dome of Soltaniyeh, a project that continued until 1978. This restoration is regarded as one of the most intricate and detailed renovation projects. With over 700 years of history, the Dome of Soltaniyeh stands as a magnificent example of unique architecture, needing ongoing care and preservation.\n\nDome of Soltaniyeh Architecture\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh features a unique architectural plan. On the ground and first floors, the layout is rectangular, but it transforms into an octagonal shape on the second and third floors. This design reflects a blend of Seljuk architectural style and Islamic principles. Notably, the building includes 110 steps, which correspond to the numerical value of the name Ali (AS) in Abjad numerology. The dome’s symmetry is perfectly aligned with the Qibla, indicating its Islamic influence.\n\nConstructed primarily from brick, the Dome of Soltaniyeh is a remarkable example of medieval Persian architecture. The dome itself is adorned with turquoise and cobalt-blue tiles, applied using a mosaic technique. The mortar used in the building’s construction is a mix of gypsum and a small amount of lime, ensuring durability.\n\nHistorians believe that the design of the Dome of Soltaniyeh was inspired by the tomb of Ghazan Khan, the most famous Ilkhanid ruler, which in turn was influenced by the tomb of Sultan Sanjar, the second Seljuk Sultan. While these earlier tombs have square plans, the Dome of Soltaniyeh stands out with its octagonal shape.\n\nInterestingly, the Dome of Soltaniyeh’s design has had a significant impact on later architectural styles. Notably, Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti, famous 15th-century Italian architects, drew inspiration from this structure for the dome of the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral in Florence, Italy, built about 100 years later. Arthur Pope, a prominent American historian, even suggested that the design of the Taj Mahal in India was influenced by the Dome of Soltaniyeh.\n\nOne remarkable feature of the Dome of Soltaniyeh is its foundation, which is only about half a meter deep. Despite this, the building, weighing 1,600 tons, has only settled eight centimeters over 700 years. It has withstood 33 earthquakes, the strongest of which was 6.0 on the Richter scale. The ground beneath the dome consists of densely packed sand and gravel, providing excellent stability.\n\nThe shallow foundation, about 50 to 60 centimeters deep, has proven remarkably effective, demonstrating the ingenuity of its builders. The foundation is deeper only in the northern part of the structure, extending 1.5 meters below ground level. Made from regular stone blocks measuring 20 by 25 centimeters, bound with gypsum and lime mortar, the foundation of the Dome of Soltaniyeh is a testament to its enduring strength.\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh’s influence extends far beyond its physical location, inspiring structures like the Santa Maria del Fiore Cathedral and potentially the Taj Mahal.\n\nDifferent Parts of the Dome of Soltaniyeh\n\nIn this glorious place you can see different parts, including:\n\nTomb Chamber;\n\nCrypt;\n\nMain Dome;\n\nMinarets;\n\nMuseum;\n\nLost Structures.\n\nTomb Chamber\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh may look like just a big dome from far away, but it’s actually made up of several important parts. One of these parts is the tomb chamber, which is like a room where important people are buried. It’s on the southern side of the dome. The tomb chamber is quite big, about 17.6 meters long, 8 meters wide, and 16 meters high.\n\nIt seems like they added this chamber after they finished building the main dome. A long time ago, they brought soil from special places like Najaf and Karbala to use in making this part of the dome. There are special writings on the walls of this chamber, and the tiles and decorations here are very beautiful and rare.\n\nCrypt\n\nUnderneath the tomb chamber, there’s another part called the crypt. It’s like a secret room under the main chamber. People believe they used this space before they finished building the dome. In the past, important people were buried in crypts like this, along with their precious things, to show their importance. The crypt in the Dome of Soltaniyeh was where kings and important people were buried. To get to the crypt, you have to go through the southern entrance of the tomb chamber. It’s a bit low, so you have to bend down a bit when you enter, as a sign of respect for the people buried there.\n\nMain Dome\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh is a very special building because it has the world’s first double-shelled dome. This means it has two layers, like wearing two hats on top of each other. It’s about 50 meters tall, and the hole in the middle is about 25.5 meters wide. The dome is quite thick, with a space between the two layers that helps it stay strong during earthquakes. The shape of the dome is very different from other buildings in Iran, and it looks very impressive from the outside.\n\nMinarets\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh used to have eight tall towers called minarets, but now only one and a half remain. These minarets were like big towers with spiral staircases inside. People would climb up to call out prayers and announcements from the top. The remaining minarets are hollow, with stairs going all the way up.\n\nMuseum\n\nThere’s a small museum near the entrance of the Dome of Soltaniyeh. Inside, you can see pictures and things from a long time ago. It’s like a mini exhibition where you can learn about the history of the area.\n\nLost Structures\n\nAround the Dome of Soltaniyeh, there used to be other buildings and a big wall to protect the area. Sadly, these buildings were destroyed a long time ago. There was also a mosque nearby, but now only some parts of it remain.\n\nFloors of the Building\n\nIn the Dome of Soltaniyeh you can see different floors, such as:\n\nGround Floor;\n\nFirst Floor;\n\nSecond Floor;\n\nStaircases;\n\nAttic Floor.\n\nGround Floor\n\nThe bottom part of the Dome of Soltaniyeh is where Sultan Mohammad Khodabandeh planned to lay to rest Imam Ali and Imam Hussein. Additionally, there’s a large open space here, likely meant for special religious ceremonies and events. This floor plays a crucial role in the building’s design and function, serving both a solemn purpose with the planned burial site and a communal one with the spacious area for gatherings.\n\nFirst Floor\n\nMoving up to the first floor, you’ll find yourself at a height of about 9.4 meters. This level mainly consists of connecting hallways, making it easier for people to move around the building. Surrounding the structure, there’s a covered courtyard, and the four large courtyards have windows that let in natural light, making the area brighter and more inviting. These hallways were built not just for practicality but also to keep the building light. If these spaces were filled, it would have made the structure much heavier and required more building materials.\n\nSecond Floor\n\nOn the second floor, about 27.8 meters above the ground, you’ll find courtyards similar to those on the first floor but with a view of the surrounding plains. These courtyards are beautifully adorned with tilework, plasterwork, and a mix of brick and tile, along with many inscriptions. Back in the day, these courtyards were where scholars and students of religious studies gathered. During the Safavid period, they were transformed into rooms, possibly for student accommodations. This adaptation reflects the building’s history and how it evolved over time to meet different needs.\n\nStaircases\n\nInside the walls of the second floor, there are eight spiral staircases leading up to the minarets. These staircases serve as pathways connecting the second and third floors. Each step is about 90 centimeters long and 30 centimeters high. These staircases are essential for providing access to the upper levels of the building, ensuring people can move safely and easily between different parts of the structure.\n\nAttic Floor\n\nFinally, the attic floor, located beneath the dome and the octagonal bases of the minarets, serves as a support for the building’s roof. This floor essentially acts as the space behind the roof, allowing people to move around freely. It was often used for maintenance tasks like repairing the dome or clearing snow from its surface. This floor’s strategic location and function contribute to the overall stability and functionality of the building.\n\nThe Sundial of Soltaniyeh Dome\n\nThe sundial at Soltaniyeh Dome was like a giant clock that helped people know the time, especially for their religious duties. Long ago, knowing the time accurately was really important for Muslims, so when they built Soltaniyeh Dome, they included a sundial in its design to help everyone in the city.\n\nHere’s how it worked: When sunlight came through a hole in the main dome, it meant it was time for the noon prayer. The light coming through the big windows acted like the hour hand on a clock, showing the general time, while the light from the smaller windows helped people guess the minutes more precisely. At night, when stars were visible through these windows, they also gave people clues about the time.\n\nSo, the sundial was like a natural clock, using the movement of the sun during the day and the stars at night to help people keep track of time. This was especially useful for people who needed to pray at specific times during the day or night. It was a clever way to make sure everyone in the city knew when it was time for their religious obligations, without needing modern clocks or watches.\n\nThe Secret of the Number Eight in Soltaniyeh Dome\n\nThe mystery surrounding the number eight in the design of Soltaniyeh Dome has intrigued many. The dome’s layout, featuring eight sides, eight doors, eight courtyards, and eight minarets, raises questions about its significance. While the exact reason for choosing the number eight remains unclear, several theories have been proposed. Some suggest that it might have been chosen for practical reasons, such as creating a sundial or enhancing the building’s structural stability. Others speculate that it could have been inspired by the idea of the eight gates of paradise, symbolizing a connection to spiritual or religious beliefs.\n\nDespite various interpretations, the significance of the number eight in the context of Soltaniyeh Dome remains open to interpretation. Whether it was a practical choice, a symbolic representation, or a combination of both, the number eight adds an intriguing layer to the architectural marvel that is Soltaniyeh Dome.\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh Decorations\n\nThe decorations of the Dome of Soltaniyeh can be explained from different perspectives, including:\n\nIslamic Architecture;\n\nBlue Color in the Dome;\n\nWooden Decorations.\n\nIslamic Architecture\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh exemplifies the pinnacle of Islamic architecture, showcasing exquisite craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail.

The Dome of Soltaniyeh stands as a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of Islamic architects, who seamlessly blended artistic expression with religious symbolism to create structures of enduring beauty and significance.\n\nBlue Color in the Dome\n\nThe Dome of Soltaniyeh, renowned for its stunning architecture, features intricate designs incorporating various colors. Among these, blue holds a significant place. The blue color used in the dome symbolizes spirituality, infinity, and the heavens in Islamic art and architecture. It represents the vastness of the sky and the celestial realm, connecting earthly structures with the divine. The vibrant blue hues employed in the dome’s decorations evoke a sense of tranquility and serenity, creating a mesmerizing visual effect that captivates viewers.\n\nWooden Decorations\n\nWooden decorations play a prominent role in embellishing the interior of the Dome of Soltaniyeh, adding warmth and richness to its architectural design. Intricately carved wooden panels, screens, and muqarnas adorn the dome’s interior, showcasing the craftsmanship of skilled artisans.

Moreover, the incorporation of wooden elements adds depth and texture to the dome’s interior, creating a sense of visual interest and inviting contemplation.
