        "text": "The United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, abbreviated as UNESCO, is a special subsidiary organization of the United Nations. Its activities are aimed to improve international cooperation in education, culture, and science in order to increase international peace and welfare.\n\nThe development of sustainable tourism is one of the most important goals of UNESCO, which is being pursued by introducing the most remarkable cultural attractions in each country. This goal involves identifying and choosing the best tangible and intangible heritages of each country through a certain process, realizing their natural, cultural, or historical significance, and eventually publishing the results in two separate lists.\n\nEvery modern civilization has inherited a set of cultural values and monuments that date back far into history. These cultural values include national traditions and customs, skills and industries, arts, literature, beliefs, etc. and are categorized as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. The other category, UNESCO World Heritage Sites, consists of monuments, structures, ancient sites, and also natural attractions.\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nUNESCO World Heritage sites are a group of culturally or naturally significant places registered by UNESCO. These sites include mountains, deserts, lakes, monuments, complexes, and cities and are chosen by the UNESCO World Heritage committee based on predetermined criteria and procedure.\n\nAccording to the World Heritage Convention, all of the sites included in the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list belong to all mankind regardless of race, religion, or nationality. Therefore, governments are responsible for their preservation.\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Sites Selection Criteria\n\nOutstanding sites around the world must meet at least one out of ten selection criteria determined by UNESCO in order to be eligible for nomination by the country in which they are. For the selection process to begin, each country has to surrender a list of potential sites to UNESCO and select one of them to be a UNESCO World Heritage site based on accurate documents and files. Afterward, the UNESCO World Heritage Committee will make the final decision by voting.\n\nIran UNESCO World Heritage Sites\n\nIran UNESCO World Heritage sites list currently consists of 24 cultural and natural sites, 22 of which are cultural ones. There are also 56 Iran attractions on the UNESCO Tentative Sites list.\n\nMoreover, UNESCO has published a similar list with the title of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. This list includes attractions of cultural value such as music, art, dance, cuisine, handicrafts, and festivals that can be recorded but not limited to a physical place such as a museum. However, they can be experienced through equipment and instruments used for them.\n\nIran currently has 14 items on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage list.\n\nNote that this list will be updated over time.\n\nKeep reading as we introduce Iran UNESCO World Heritage Sites:\n\nArmenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran\n\nThe Armenian Monastic Ensembles of Iran consists of three historical monuments located in East and West Azerbaijan provinces in Iran.

The Iranian garden was most popular during the Safavid and Qajar eras. The main elements of a traditional Persian Garden are waterways, pools, Persian Qanats, and plants. There is also a small mansion at the end of the garden.\n\nThe ingenious and outstanding design of the Persian Garden has earned it the title of UNESCO World Heritage Site. Currently, 9 Persian Gardens in Iran are on the list which is: Pasargad Garden, Eram Garden, Chehel Sotoun, Fin Garden, Abbasabad Garden, Shahzdeh Mahan Garden, Pahlavanpour Garden, Akbarieh Garden, and Dolatabad Garden.\n\nThe Persian Qanat\n\nQanat is a name given to a network of canals used to transmit underground water. Qanats are mainly used in regions with hot and dry climate, where water is sparse on the surface. The Persian Qanat refers to several perfectly designed Qanats in Iran. The spectacular design of Persian Qanats has made even the hottest regions in Iran suitable for living.\n\nUsing Qanats, people were able to bring water to houses and even use it to keep the house cool during the summer. There are 11 Persian Qanat networks registered as UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Qanats of Gonbad, Qanats of Baladeh Ferdows, Qanats of Bagh Zarch, Qanat of Mun, Qanats of Hassanabad, Qanat of Vazvan, Qanats of Goharriz, and Qanats of Ebrahimabad.\n\nHyrcanian Forests\n\nCaspian Hyrcanian Mixed Forests refers to an ecoregion that consists of lush forests near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and Azerbaijan. These mesmerizing forests are among the oldest and most valuable forests worldwide.\n\nCaspian Hyrcanian Mixed Forests are the natural habitat of 3200 plant species, 58 bird species, and 58 mammal species including the endangered Persian Leopard.\n\nLut Desert (Dasht-e Lut)\n\nThe Lut Desert is the largest desert in the world with an area of 51,800km. This vast desert fascinates its visitors with its magnificent gigantic Kalouts (Yardangs), tall sand dunes, and salt lakes. Lut Desert also holds the record of the hottest spot on earth with 70.7 degrees recorded at Gandom Beryan region.

UNESCO was conducive to globalizing its lovely natural sights, edifices, bridges, stations, and even historical locomotives as tourist attractions when it ratified the Railway as a Cultural Heritage in the year 2021.\n\nAt the time of its construction, there was much discourse and opposition regarding the need for a trans-Iranian Railway. A railway was a massive advancement for the country; however, many opposed it, since they saw it as the attempt of the enemy to wreak havoc and to facilitate the subjugation of Iran by other countries during the world war. The heritage of the Trans-Iranian Railway is representative of both sides of the political ideology of the time.\n\nAt the current time, one of the safest and most economical routes of travel in Iran is the railway. The railway passes through many different regions and offers a large range of prices and qualities. Access to Iran’s natural wonders along this route persuades many passengers to opt for this method of travel.\n\nThe Cultural Landscape of Uramanat and the Community’s Concord with Nature\n\nAnother Tangible Cultural Heritage of Iran, registered by UNESCO in the 44th session of the World Heritage Committee, is the Cultural Landscape of Hawraman or Cultural Landscape of Uramanat.\n\nUramanat or Hawraman is a historical region with a beautiful stair-like architecture that is located between Kermanshah and Kurdistan Province. The main aspects of the cultural landscape of Uramanat include the Zhaveh-Rood Valley (Darreh-ye Zhaveh-Rood), Uraman Takht, and Lohun. Overall, more than 700 hamlets reside within the Uramanat region, whose culture and origin have been very well preserved.\n\nAccording to archeological finds, the settlements in this area date back to the era of Ancient Persia. There are fossils dating back to the Paleolithic age whose origin is Hajij Village in Uraman Takht; which is why this village is known as the oldest area of Uraman.\n\nThe 44th annual session of the World Heritage Committee of UNESCO was celebrated as an online event due to covid-19, during which Hawraman was granted the label of Tangible World Heritage on the fifth of Mordad."
