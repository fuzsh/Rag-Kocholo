        "text": "Mongolian Ilkhanate (1256 - 1353) Genghis ( Changiz Khan) amalgamate his unified power in the 13th century. After conquering Beijing, the capital of China, he decided to start a trade with the West countries of Asia to improve the lives of people who were living in Central Asia. He established new diplomatic ties with the Kharazm kings to expand his trade westward, but the idiotic and hostile behavior of the Kharazm king prompted Changiz Khan to attack Iran. The Mongols moved westward through the north and south of the Caspian Sea. In their first attack, they destroyed Khorassan. Their attacks continued during the reign of Changiz Khan's successors. After defeating the Kharazm dynasty in a complex way and conquering Armenia and Georgia, the Mongols turned to the west and defeated the Anatolian Seljuks. At first, the Mongol commanders in Iran obeyed the great Mongolian Khan of Peking and called themselves \"ilkhans\" (meaning the dependents of the great Khan). But little by little the Mongolians impressed by Iranians' advanced culture and civilization changed tactics and, after many wars of destruction, they adopted Islam as their religion and began to spread religion. Having lost their savage temptations and become civilized, they are Mongol lords passionate about various arts, including painting, calligraphy, and science of the time. They had no system of government and their goal in life was to fight and Lut. Having tired of their wildlife, Iranian statesmen and lords have found a good opportunity to be loved by Mongol rulers and to dictate their code of government. After Hulaku Khan, grandson of Changiz Khan ended the Abbasid caliphate in Baghdad, the Mongols became masters of the vast Islamic world. But because of weak governance and economic problems, Mongolian leaders were forced to adopt Islam and carry out a series of economic, social, and commercial reforms. Islam helped the Mongols expel their barbaric tribal customs and even Ghazan, a strong Mongolian governor, changed his name to \"Mahmud\". He eliminated the name of the Great Khan from his room and announced that he would no longer obey him.\n\nThe adoption of Islam by the Mongols, the fall of Baghdad and the existence of great Iranian scholars in the Mongol courts, and their love of new sciences such as astrology, medicine, and historiography paved the way for the development of these sciences in the Mongol courts to the point of creating the largest observatory of the Islamic world in Maragheh by Hulaku Khan. In addition, many books of valuable stories were written during the Mongol rule in Iran."
