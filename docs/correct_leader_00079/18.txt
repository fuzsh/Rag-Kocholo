With 5,773 days as minister under his belt, Väyrynen surpasses his late Centre Party colleague Ahti Karjalainen, with whom he served in cabinet back in the 1970s.

Another former Centre Party PM, the late Johannes Virolainen, remains the all-time longest-serving minister with 6,169 days.

The only person to serve as a minister in four different decades, Väyrynen has had a colourful, scandal-dotted career since first being elected to Parliament 40 years ago.

Now 64, Väyrynen’s first ministerial stint began in 1975. At the tender age of 29, he became Minister of Education as part a short-lived 'emergency government' under Prime Minister Martti Miettunen. He then became Minister of Labour in Miettunen's third cabinet.

Between 1977 and 1993, he served in governments led by Kalevi Sorsa, Mauno Koivisto and Esko Aho.

An outspoken Eurosceptic, he then served several terms in the European Parliament and ran for president for a second time.

In a surprise move in 2007, he was appointed to Matti Vanhanen’s second cabinet amid controversy. Väyrynen was elected to both the Finnish and European Parliaments, yet refused to present his credentials in Helsinki until the government was named. He became Minister for Foreign Trade and Development, a post he held onto when Mari Kiviniemi became premier last June.
