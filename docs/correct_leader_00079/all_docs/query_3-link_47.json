One of the reasons the Finnish Limited Liability Company is the most common form of business relates to the shareholders has no personal liability for the company’s obligations.\n\nForeign branch in Finland\n\nA foreign company can establish a local presence in Finland through a branch.

However, the general corporate tax rate is today at a moderate 20%. Companies resident in Finland are liable to tax on their worldwide income. Non-resident companies are taxed on their income derived from Finland, and if they have a permanent establishment in Finland, on all income related to the permanent establishment. There is no definition for corporate residence in the tax laws. The general rule is that if a company is registered in Finland, it is also considered a tax resident of Finland.\n\nDeductions\n\nIn general, expenses are deductible if they are incurred for the purpose of acquiring or maintaining income. The fact that it was the taxpayer’s intention to incur a particular expense for this purpose is usually the decisive test for deductibility. Typical types of deductible expenses are purchases of materials and services, use of inventory, wages and salaries, social security expenses, purchases of investments as a form of depreciation (there are maximum depreciation rates accepted), rents, support services and other operating expenses as well as interest payable.\n\nGroup taxation in Finland\n\nEach company belonging to a group is taxed separately plus there is no joint group taxation.
