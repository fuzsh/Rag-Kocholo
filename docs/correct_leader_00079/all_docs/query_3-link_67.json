        "text": "Company formation in Finland\n\nIf you're thinking of starting a business in Finland, you need to know about the country's company formation process. In Finland, the most common way to form a company is to register as a limited company. To do this, you need to create a company charter and file it with the Trade Register.\n\nThe registration process can be complex, and there are several steps that you need to take. You'll need to choose a company name, draft your company's articles of association, and appoint directors and shareholders. You'll also need to decide on a business structure and register for tax purposes.\n\nThe good news is that there are several companies that can help you with the company formation process. These companies can help you with everything from drafting your company charter to registering with the Trade Register.\n\nFurthermore, Finland is a highly digitalized nation which makes that many business processes can be done online.\n\nBusiness opportunities in Finland\n\nFinland is a great place to do business, thanks to its thriving economy and well-educated workforce. In addition, the country offers tax advantages for businesses, and its rankings in terms of global competitiveness are impressive. If you're thinking about doing business in Finland, these are some of the sectors you should consider:\n\nICT sector\n\nCleantech sector\n\nHealthtech sector\n\nFood and beverage sector\n\nRetail & e-commerce sector\n\nFinland & e-commerce\n\nFinland is a great place for e-commerce businesses, with over two-thirds of the population shopping online.\n\nThis makes Finland one of the most e-commerce-friendly countries in Europe. In fact, Finland is one of the leading countries in the world for e-commerce penetration.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why Finland is such a great place for e-commerce businesses. Firstly, the population is highly digitally engaged, with well over 90% of Finns having access to the internet. Additionally, Finnish consumers are willing to spend money online, with e-commerce sales making up a relatively very high percentage of retail sales in the country. Finally, Finland has a well-developed digital infrastructure, with high levels of internet and broadband penetration. This means that Finnish consumers have easy access to high-speed internet, which they use to shop online. As a result, e-commerce businesses can expect high levels of engagement from Finnish consumers.\n\nIf you're planning on setting up an e-commerce business in Finland, there are a few things you need to know. Firstly, you'll need to choose a suitable e-commerce platform. There are a number of different platforms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. You'll need to consider your specific needs and requirements when choosing a platform. Secondly, you'll need to set up a payment gateway. Finnish consumers are comfortable using a variety of different payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, and online banking. You'll need to choose a payment gateway that supports the payment methods you want to offer. Finally, you'll need to ensure that your website is optimised for Finnish consumers. This means making sure that your website is available in Finnish and that it includes relevant local content.\n\nBy following these steps, you can set up a successful e-commerce business in Finland.\n\nChallenges of doing business in Finland\n\nAlthough there are many opportunities for businesses in Finland, there are also some challenges that you need to be aware of. One of the biggest challenges is the country's geographical location. Finland shares a long border with Russia. Furthermore, Finland is not the most centrally located country in Europe.\n\nAnother challenge for businesses in Finland is the country's small market size. The population of Finland is only about 5.5 million people, which can make it difficult to reach a large number of consumers. On the other hand, Finland is part of the EU and euro system, which gives it full access to the European markets.\n\nFinally, businesses in Finland need to be aware of the country's strict labor laws. These laws can be challenging to navigate and can lead to higher labor costs.\n\nTax system for businesses in Finland\n\nThe tax system for businesses in Finland is relatively complex. There are several different taxes that businesses need to pay, including corporate income tax, value-added tax (VAT), payroll taxes, and land taxes.\n\nIn addition, companies doing business in Finland are subject to EU directives on taxation. This means that they're required to comply with certain rules and regulations regarding taxation. For example, companies are required to charge VAT on all of their sales, regardless of where they're located in the EU.\n\nOne thing to note is that the corporate income tax rate in Finland is relatively low at 20%. Especially compared to its Nordic peers! However, there are also a number of tax incentives available for businesses in Finland. These include deductions for research and development expenses and investment credits.\n\nFinland’s tax advantages for businesses\n\nThere are several tax advantages available for businesses in Finland. These include deductions for research and development expenses and investment credits. Additionally, the corporate income tax rate in Finland is relatively low at 20%. A few others worth mentioning:\n\nLoss carry forward up to 10 years\n\nGroup companies may even out their taxable profits and losses (Group contribution)\n\nTax free dividends to parent company if both companies are in the EU/EEA area\n\nCapital gains from the sales of shares are with some exceptions tax free (Participation exemption)\n\nNo surtax or wealth tax\n\nReal estate tax is set by the local municipal (range 0,93%–2,00%)\n\nWide tax treaty network in order to eliminate double taxation\n\nPredictable interpretation of Transfer Pricing Guidelines rules (OECD, all methods accepted)\n\nVAT tax rates: 24% (standard rate), 14%, 10%\n\nExceptions from VAT (VAT 0%): social, healthcare, medical services, public education and similar services, financial and insurance services\n\nVisa and relocation to Finland\n\nIf you're an EU citizen (including Norway and Iceland), you don't need a visa to live and work in Finland. You can simply move to Finland and start working immediately. As an EU citizen, you also have the right to freedom of movement, which means you can travel and work throughout the EU without any restrictions. You should however register yourself with the Finnish authorities if you are staying longer than 3 months. However, this is just a formality. That last requirement does not apply to citizens from the other Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland).\n\nIf you're not an EU citizen, you'll need to apply for a visa before moving to Finland. The process can be a bit complicated, so it's best to consult with the Finnish embassy or consulate in your country.\n\nOnce you have your visa, you can move to Finland and start working. However, note that as a non-EU citizen, you won't have the same rights as EU citizens. You won't be able to travel and work throughout the EU without restrictions, and you may also need a separate work permit.\n\nHiring employees in Finland\n\nWhen hiring employees in Finland, you'll need to follow the country's employment law. This covers everything from the minimum wage to holiday entitlements. The most important thing to remember is that you must always provide employees with a written contract, as this will outline their rights and responsibilities.\n\nThe Finnish Employment Contracts Act sets out the following mandatory provisions which must be included in an employment contract:\n\n- The employee's job title\n\n- The start date of the contract\n\n- The employee's place of work\n\n- The working hours\n\n- The salary and any other pay arrangements\n\n- The duration of the contract (if it's not permanent)\n\n- Any special provisions that apply to the employee\n\nIn addition, an employer must provide employees with a description of the most essential terms and conditions of employment if they are not indicated on a written employment contract. This document must include information on:\n\n- Holidays and vacation entitlement\n\n- Sick leave entitlement\n\n- Maternity/paternity leave entitlement\n\n- Minimum wage\n\n- Overtime and night work arrangements\n\n- Other fringe benefits"
