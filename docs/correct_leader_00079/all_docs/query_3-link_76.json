        "text": "The Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman\n\nThe Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman is an autonomous institution of the Parliament headed by the Ombudsman. It has more than 70 employees.\n\nThe Parliamentary Ombudsman is a supreme overseer of legality elected by the national parliament whose duties are set out in the Constitution. The Ombudsman exercises oversight to ensure that the authorities, public servants and others who perform public tasks obey the law and fulfil their duties. The Ombudsman has a special focus on the implementation of good governance and fundamental and human rights. The Parliamentary Ombudsman and two Deputy-Ombudsmen work independently and have the same powers.\n\nThe Ombudsman investigates complaints received by him or her and, based on the results of the investigation, takes any action he or she finds necessary. The Ombudsman may also investigate illegalities or shortcomings on his or her own initiative. Every year, the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman receives some 7,000 complaints, which are divided between legal advisers specialising in different branches of administration for investigation. During an investigation, the object of the complaint is heard, and information and statements are requested from the relevant authorities.\n\nThe office carries out some 100 inspections of closed institutions, units of the Defence Forces and offices every year. Shortcomings observed in the course of inspections are subsequently investigated on the Ombudsman’s own initiative. One of the priorities within the Parliamentary Ombudsman’s remit is to monitor the implementation of the rights of persons with disabilities, older people and children.\n\nAbout 75% of the personnel in the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman are legal advisers, and about 25% office staff. Complaints are investigated by the three divisions led by the Ombudsman and the two Deputy-Ombudsmen. The administration division directed by the Secretary General is responsible for the administrative running of the Office, recording complaints, customer service, filing and communications.\n\nThe Human Rights Centre and its Human Rights Delegation operate in connection with the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Human Rights Centre operates autonomously, but administratively it is part of the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman. The Ombudsman, the Human Rights Centre and the Human Rights Delegation together form the national Human Rights Institution of Finland in accordance with the UN’s Paris Principles.\n\nKey values jointly defined by the Office personnel are fairness, responsibility and closeness to people. Working at the Office of the Parliamentary Ombudsman is motivating and interesting. The Office has a good working atmosphere and a low hierarchy. The Office occupies modern and attractive premises on the first floor of the Parliament's annex building, Pikkuparlamentti."
