        "text": "The deficit in the balance of trade rose to nearly 5 billion Fmk in 1974. The rise in the cost of energy was seen as the main cause of this deficit. In 1974 the Soviet Union rose to number one position as exporter of goods to Finland.\n\nIn an interview for Yugoslavian television, Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen stated that the Second Stage of the CSCE had in the main questions advanced far enough for work to be brought to a conclusion in the near future.\n\nFinland cannot, in today's world, build her security emphasizing reliance on arms, stated Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen at the opening of the 55th Defence Course in Helsinki, referring to the fact that the disproportion of the military resources of great powers and small states is continually growing. He also stated that his attitude to the defence forces and the military is not negative. Minister Karjalainen was referring to a statement of his at an interview, in which he said that in modern warfare our army is not of decisive importance to the fate of our nation. This \"pacifist statement” had aroused much attention.\n\nThe second IPU conference on security and cooperation commenced in Belgrade. The appeal to governments participating in the CSCE, expressed in the communique of the meeting, to bring the Conference to a hasty conclusion, was of importance from Finland's point of view. The political part of Finland's proposal on studying nuclear-free zones at a special meeting of experts and parliamentarians was also included in the document. Nordic cooperation in the field of energy was foremost on the agenda at the Nordic Prime Ministers' meeting in Oslo. The meeting was preceded by a Conference for Nordic Ministers of Industry in Gothenburg. The idea of founding a Nordic investment bank was once again brought to life at the meeting.\n\nPresident Kekkonen's suggestions concerning Nordic security are deserving of re-examination, said Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa in his speech at the plenum of the Nordic Council. On the way to Reykjavik, Sorsa met Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme. The doubts recently expressed in Finland about Sweden's neutrality were behind the meeting. At a press conference in Reykjavik, Sorsa stated that relations between Finland and Sweden are good and that Finland trusts in Sweden's neutrality.\n\nThe discussion on Sweden's neutrality began with an editorial in Suomen Sosialidemokraatti on Feb. 8, which stated that the familiar picture of the Nordic countries as a political entity had disintegrated, posed questions on the effect developments in general security policy have had on Northern Europe and brought up the idea of developing cooperation in Northern Europe in which the Soviet Union would also participate. MP Erkki Tuomioja (Social Democrats) presented similar views in his speech at the Nordic Council meeting on Feb. 17.\n\nIn connection with the question of Sweden's neutrality, reference was made to the Viggen sales, Sweden's membership in the lEA and the so-called Synnergren report, which touches on Finland's position in the event of a crisis. Both the article and the speech aroused considerable attention not only in Finland and the other Nordic countries but also in the Western European press.\n\nThe Finnish government appropriated 200 000 Fmk to be used by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for humanitarian aid in Cyprus.\n\nA commercial delegation led by Minister Jermu Laine left on a visit to Cuba, Mexico, Peru and Ecuador. In Peru, Minister Laine participated in the meeting of the UN Industrial Development Organization UNIDO. In Peru an agreement on an extensive forestry research project and a trade agreement concerning a paper and cellulose factory were signed. Finland and Mexico signed an agreement on economic, technical and industrial cooperation and a basic credit agreement for circa 30 million. With Cuba, Finland signed an agreement on economic, scientific and technical cooperation and decided to establish a cooperation commission.\n\nNeste Oy's tanker Enskeri left Sköldvik oil harbour for the southern Atlantic, where it intended to sink 690 drums of waste containing arsenic. The company had not asked for official opinion on the matter. 17. The government decided that Neste must apply for a permit to dump the drums. Parliamentary inquiries on the matter were made in Finland and Norway. The matter aroused considerable attention and was the cause of protests both in Finland and abroad. In its statement on Neste's application for a permit, the Foreign Ministry considered Finland's reputation grounds enough for denying the permit. 23. The government forbade Neste to dump the poison. 25. The tanker was ordered to return to Europe. Its load of drums was brought back to Finland and stored in Naantali. 26. Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen stated that all the countries which had advocated taking up the matter in an international forum had withdrawn from their standpoint and that the matter was no longer on the international agenda. 17. General-Secretary of the CPSU Leonid Brezhnev suggested that the final stage of the CSCE be held in Helsinki on June 30, 1975.\n\nPresident Kekkonen left on a 5-day official visit to Yugoslavia. The communiqué published at the end of the visit concludes that realizing the CSCE is an important step towards direct, wide and equal cooperation between all European countries as well as the lessening of differences between different groupings, thus laying the foundation for solving other international problems.\n\nIn an interview published in Belgrade on March 20, Mr. Kekkonen touched on the establishing of a Nordic nuclear-free zone, the position of small non-aligned countries, the economic inquality in the world, the importance of the CSCE and Finnish-Yugoslavian relations. On his way to Jugoslavia, President Kekkonen met Hungarian President Pal Losonczin and Foreign Minister Friggyes Pujan, on his return trip Hungarian Party leader Janos Kadar.\n\nAt its last meeting, the Constitutional Committee summarized its hopes for the continuation of its four and a half years' work as follows: The question of constitutional reform should be taken up for reconsideration allowing the State Council to decide at least the future preparation of partial reforms in a committee of parliamentary base.\n\nFinland and Romania signed an agreement on cooperation in the field of tourism, in Bucharest. Finland gave Bangladesh and Tanzania 13 million Fmk special development grants, and Ethiopia and Kenya 7 million Fmk development grants.\n\nThe 30th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War was celebrated in Helsinki. At the festivities, President Kekkonen was presented with a Peace Address signed by 582 000 individuals and, inter alia, 174 national organisations. The Address was compiled into 60 books. The collecting of signatures began on Sept. 19, 1974, the 30th anniversary of the ending of the war between Finland and the Soviet Union. 12.5. A delegation led by Foreign Minister Ahti Karjalainen presented Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny with the Finnish Peace Address, in Moscow.\n\nA Soviet delegation led hy Minister Aleksei Sholnikov attended the festivities arranged by the Peace Committee of Finland.\n\nAt the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference (5.—30.5.) Finland proposed measures with which to guarantee the interests of countries having signed or ratified the Treaty compared with those of other countries and with which to thus expand the number of signatories, reported the Finnish delegation led by Ambassador Risto Hyvärinen.\n\nAmbassador Joel Pekuri was elected Secretary-General of the Third Stage of the CSCE to be held in Helsinki, in Geneva. The Finnish government had suggested the appointment a week earlier.\n\nThe Coordination committee of the CSCE reached unanimity on the fact that the Third Stage could commence in the near future in Helsinki. However, the committee did not, as was generally expected, decide the exact date.\n\nWomen must participate in the struggle for peace, international security and cooperation and for human rights and human dignity, as equals to and bearing the same responsibility as men, said chairman of the Finnish delegation Alli Lahtinen while taking the floor for Finland at the UN Womens' Year Conference in Mexico City.\n\nThe 1974 Committee on Foreign Affairs Administration handed its report in which it proposed democratizing and modernizing the administration of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThe ad hoc governmental work-group which had carried out a \"Comprehensive Study of the Question of the Nuclear Weapon Free Zones in all its aspects” submitted its report to the Geneva Disarmament Committee.\n\nThe Nordic Foreign Ministers' meeting in Oslo decided that they would begin to follow the implementation of the CSCE decisions, and that the issue will be brought up at meetings twice yearly. The meeting also decided on a common Nordic position, which in practice will mean that the Nordic countries will not support Israel's expulsion from the UN. Finland had not previously taken a stand on this issue.\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen and Prime Minister Aleksei Kosygin inaugurated the first part of the Finnish built Svetogorsk paper and cellulose plant, and laid the cornerstone of the second part. In talks, the main subjects discussed were joint plans for economic cooperation and the international situation after the CSCE. Finland and the Soviet Union signed a protocol on the building of the second part of Svetogorsk. (The Svetogorsk contract was included in the Finnish-Soviet basic five-year agreement. Negotiations began in 1970, and an agreement on the building was reached in 1972. The contract was worth over 200 million Fmk. The contract for the second part is worth 640 million Fmk, and is one of the largest Finnish-Soviet joint projects. The work is scheduled to be completed by 1979. At the moment, the project employs one thousand men.)\n\nAccording to a survey by M-tietokeskus, 70 per cent of Finns consider the CSCE to have been of equal value to the East and the West, and 85 per cent are of the opinion that it has been of use to our country.\n\nAmbassador Risto Hyvärinen was appointed Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General to the Geneva Conference of the Committee on Disarmament.\n\nUnited States Assistant Secretary of State Robert Ingersoll negotiated with Foreign Minister Olavi J. Mattila and Minister of Foreign Trade Arvo Rytkönen.\n\nMinister of Foreign Trade Arvo Rytkönen officially took the floor for Finland at the Special Session of the UN General Assembly in New York (see document section). 11. \"If it really has been said that Finland is a close to total military vacuum, this indicates a basic lack of information and is, as depreciation, an insult to the Finnish soldier and defender of his country”, stated Commander in chief of the Finnish armed forces General Lauri Sutela, in an interview for the Helsinki daily, Uusi Suomi. The statement was made in reference to the words of a Norwegian NATO staff officer, which appeared in articles of similar content in various dailies on Sept. 7. A group of Finnish reporters had been acquainting themselves with Norway's defence, as guests of the Norwegian armed forces. Other Norwegian views which were made public in connection with the visit were also the cause of considerable attention.\n\nKenyan Minister of Finance and Planning Mwai Kibaki arrived in Finland on a 3-day visit, during which Finland and Kenya signed a basic agreement on development cooperation.\n\nThe Guardian published an article entitled \"Rebirth of the Cold War” which contends that the Soviet Union is considering intervention and subversion in Finland after the death of President Kekkonen. The article claimed to be based on talks held by the Foreign Ministers of the United States, England, France and the FRG. The British Foreign Office denied that the statements were in line with Foreign Secretary Callaghan's views. Foreign Minister Genscher of the FRG also corrected the information. The Finnish Foreign Ministry said that the allegations were totally unfounded and labelled them slander.\n\n31.9.1975 The Foreign Ministry ordered Finland's Ambassador in Madrid, Heikki Hannikainen, to return to Helsinki. News of new political trials in Spain was given as the reason for this measure.\n\nThe second stage of the Pääjärvi Forestry Centre was left to V/O Exportles. (Finland built in the Soviet Union a community for 4 000, with social services and a technically top-level computer-operated wood-processing line and chipboard factory, at Pääjärvi. Work on the second stage began in 1972. Price negotiations on the building of the third and largest stage began at the beginning of November.)\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen left on a 4-day state visit to Sweden, the first since 1956. In talks with Prime Minister Olof Palme, the Nordic investment bank, labour policy and the proposal for a Nordic nuclear-free zone, among other things, were discussed. 19.10. In an interview for Dagens Nyheter, President Kekkonen said that establishing nuclear-free zones both in the Nordic area and elsewhere in the world would considerably further the relaxation of tensions. He also said that \"we have no reason to believe that Sweden has given up her neutrality.”\n\nFinland celebrated the 20th anniversary of Finnish-Soviet scientific and technical co-operation. A Soviet delegation led by Vice Premier V.A. Kirillin attended the ceremonies. (The Agreement on Scientific and Technical Co-operation signed by Finland and the Soviet Union on August 16, 1955, was the first adaption of the FCA Treaty signed seven years earlier. According to the agreement, cooperation can take place in all fields of science and technology. Co-operation takes the form of exchanging information, students and experts, and arranging symposia, as well as joint development and research work. Cooperation is implemented by the joint Finnish- Soviet Commission for Scientific and Technical Co-operation, to which each government names six members. Protocols supplementing the agreement have been signed yearly. In connection with the committee, joint working-groups, of which there are 24 at the moment, have been established. Of late this cooperation has shown a tendency towards planning, which is demonstrated by the signing of long-term programmes for co-operation in science and technology in 1974 and cooperation in the natural and social sciences and the humanities in 1975.)\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen gave the political parties three days' time to form a \"national state of emergency” majority government. He appointed former Governor Martti Miettunen to set up the new government, and dictated the government's programme as securing employment. Negotiations concerning the government had continued since October 6. On November 25, President Kekkonen had asked Keijo Liinamaa's civil servant government to continue. The new five-party government led by Prime Minister Martti Miettunen began its work on November 30. The new government's ministers' portfolios were split up among the parties as follows: Social Democratic Party 5, the Democratic League of the Finnish People 4, the Center Party 4, the Swedish People's Party 2, the Liberal People's Party I - The government also included 2 professional non-socialist ministers belonging to no party. Kalevi Sorsa, chairman of the SDP, was named Foreign Minister.\n\nThe general development in Europe is to a great extent parallel to the foreign policy practiced by Finland throughout President Kekkonen's term in office, the government concluded in its report on the CSCE to Parliament. The first part of the 27-page report examines the international developments leading to the Third Stage of the CSCE, the second part the contents of the Final Act. After the 2-day CSCE debate in Parliament which followed the report, Foreign Minister Olavi J. Mattila concluded that Parliament places value to the CSCE and its results and approves of the government's activity in the matter.\n\nThe Finnish issue of the Final Act of the CSCE was published. The total number of copies printed was 65 000."
