Military manpower estimates are as of 1 July 1976 except for average number of males reaching military age, which are projected averages for the 5-year period 1976-80. Military and communications data are as of 31 October 1976 unless otherwise indicated. Most of the land utilization estimates are rough approximations, and most of the statistical data are rounded (thousands and millions). Figures for \"arable\" may reflect only the area actually under crops rather than the potential cultivable. Fishing limits are included only when they differ from the territorial limits. For some countries GDP, rather than GNP, is shown. The difference between the two is in the addition or subtraction of the value of return on foreign investment. GDP equals GNP plus income earned in the country but sent abroad, minus income earned abroad but sent into the country. GDP thus tends to exceed GNP in debtor countries, and the reverse is true in creditor countries. Major ports are the largest maritime ports of the country, relative to other ports of the same country, on the basis of estimated port capacity, alongside berthing accommodations, and commercial or naval importance. Minor ports are the remaining ports of a country which have, relative to the major ports, significantly lower estimated port capacity, fewer alongside berthing accommodations, are of less commercial or naval importance.. Major transport aircraft are those weighing over 20,000 pounds. Military budgets are in U.S. dollar equivalents. The dollar sign refers to U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The abbreviation FY stands for U.S. fiscal year; all years are calendar years unless otherwise indicated. mm millimeters 0.04 inches in in inches 2.5 centimeters cm cm centimeters 0.4 inches in ft feet 30 centimeters cm m meters 3.3 feet ft yd yards 0.9 meters m meters 1.1 yards yd mi miles 1.6 kilometers km AREA in' square inches 6.5 square centimeters cm' square centimeters 0.16 square inches in' ft' square feet 0.09 square meters m square meters 1.2 square yards yd' yd' square yards 0.8 square meters km' square kilometers 0.4 square miles mi mi square miles 2.6 square kilometers km' ho hectares (10,000 m') 2.5 acres acres 0.4 hectares ha g grams 0.035 ounces oz or ounces 28 grams kg kilograms 2.2 pounds lb lb pounds 0.45 kilograms 1 tonnes (1000 kg) 1.1 short tons short tons 0.9 tonnes ml milliliters 0.03 fluid ounces fl oz VOLUME I liters 2.1 pints pt tsp teaspoons 5 milliliters ml I liters 1.06 quarts qt Tbsp tablespoons 15 milliliters ml I liters 0.26 gallons gal fl oz fluid ounces 30 milliliters ml m cubic meters 35 cubic feet h' c cups 0.24 liters m' cubic meters 1.3 cubic yards yd' pt pints 0.47 liters qt quarts- 0.95 liters gal gallons 3.8 liters h' cubic feet 0.03 cubic meters m' yd' cubic yards 0.76 cubic meters m Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/21 : CIA-RDP08-00534R000100130001-8 Declassified and Approved For Release 2012/08/21 : CIA-RDP08-00534R000100130001-8 AFGHANISTAN LAND 647,500 km2; 22% arable (12% cultivated, 10% pasture), 75% desert, waste or urban, 3% forested Land boundaries: 5,510 km PEOPLE Population: 19,811,000 (January 1977), average annual growth rate 2.3% (7-72 to 7-73) Nationality: noun-Afghan(s); adjective-Afghan Ethnic divisions: 50% Pushtuns, 25% Tajiks, 9% Uzbeks, 9% Hazaras; minor ethnic groups include Chahar Aimaks, Turkmen, Kizelbashes, and others Religion: 87% Sunni Muslim, 12% Shia Muslim, 1 % other Language: 50% Pushtu, 35% Afghan Persian (Dari), 11% Turkic languages (primarily Uzbek and Turkmen), 10% 30 minor languages (primarily Baluchi and Pashai); much bilingualism Literacy: under 10% Labor force: about 4.3 million (1966 official est.); 75%-80% agriculture and animal husbandry, 20%- 25% commerce, small 'industry, services; massive shortage of skilled labor Organized labor: none GOVERNMENT Legal name: Republic of Afghanistan Type: republic Capital: Kabul Political subdivisions: 26 provinces with centrally appointed governors Legal system: based on Islamic law; constitution nullified July 1973; independent judiciary also abolished and powers transferred to the Council of Justice, chaired by Minister of justice; legal education at University of Kabul; has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction Branches: Parliament abolished July 1973; all powers of the parliament and the monarchy transferred to the President Government leaders: President Mohammad Daoud who also serves as Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister; Mohammad Naim, Daoud's brother and personal adviser Suffrage: universal from age 20 Elections: promised but no date set Political parties and leaders: no political parties permitted Communists: there are two pro-Moscow Com- munist groups, Parcham and Khalq, believed to have several hundred active members, and a smaller pro- Peking group, Sholaye-Jaweid Other political or pressure groups: most military officers support the government; no known organized opposition Member of: ADB, Colombo Plan, FAO, IAEA, IBRD, ICAO, IDA, IFC, ILO, IMF, ITU, U.N., UNESCO, UPU, WHO, WMO, WSG ECONOMY GNP: $1.2 billion (FY75, at 1972 prices), $60 per capita; real growth rate about 2.4% (1973-75) Agriculture: agriculture and animal husbandry account for over 50% of GNP and occupy nearly 85% of the labor force; main crops-wheat and other grains, cotton, fruits, nuts; largely self-sufficient; food shortages-wheat, sugar, tea Major industries: cottage industries, food processing, textiles, cement, coal mining Electric power: 320,000 kW capacity (1975); 560 million kWh produced (1975), 29 kWh per capita Exports: $229 million (f.o.b., FY76); fresh and dried fruits, natural gas, karakul skins, carpets, hides, and wool Imports: $260 million (c.i.f., FY76); non-metallic minerals, sugar, tires and tubes, textiles, tea, used clothing, tobacco, transportation Major trade partners: export-U.S.S.R., India, U.K., Pakistan, West Germany, Switzerland, U.S.; imports-Japan, U.S.S.R., India, West Germany, U.
