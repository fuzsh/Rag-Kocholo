        "text": "Constitutional reform rose to the fore in negotiations on Prime Minister Martti Miettunen's Government programme. The left demanded that the majority rules and rules about legislation lying dormant be renewed in the partial reform of the Constitution. 4.3. After four months of negotiations the programme was completed. 1.4. In its economic programme, Cabinet declared that it would try to reduce the trade deficit from the present nearly 8 Bmk to 2.5 bmk within five years. To this aim, consumption must be reduced and cash flows directed to the needs of export industry. SKDL (the Finnish People's Democratic League) ministers considered this in conflict with the Government programme, as it placed the balance of payments before employment.\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen had been Finland's Head of State for twenty years. Kekkonen ran for President already in 1950, but was defeated by Paasikivi. In 1956, he won by the narrowest possible majority, he was re-elected in 1962, and in 1968 there was no doubt about his re-election. In 1973 Parliament passed exceptional legislation prolonging Kekkonen's term by four years to the end of February 1978. By the summer of 1976, the 1978 election results seemed clear, as all the major parties had expressed their support for Kekkonen. SDP, the Communist Party, the Coalition Party and the Liberals made their decisions already in the summer of 1975.\n\nParliament passed the law on the establishment of the Nordic Investment Bank. 27.5. Cabinet decided that the founding agreement would enter force on 1.6., and appointed Finland's representatives to the Bank's governing body. SKDL was opposed to Finnish participation in the Bank, on the grounds that it would increase our economic and political dependence on Western Europe. In its report of 4.5. on the Bank, Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee stipulated that the Bank not exclude Socialist markets and that it in its work take into consideration differences in development between the Nordic countries. 26.11. The Bank's first loan was granted to Imatran Voima for building Finland's share of a Nordic power transmission network.\n\nThe Foreign Ministry announced that Finnish-South African trade is being examined taking into consideration Finland's obligations as a member of the UN. The Ministry contended allegations in the West German press that Finland was preparing to break off diplomatic relations with South Africa. These were based on a statement by President Kekkonen that our trade with South Africa (0.3 % of total trade) could be broken off.\n\nTaking the floor for Finland at the UN Habitat Conference in Canada, Minister of Housing Olavi Hänninen stated that housing questions are a challenge to both the international system and national governments. The Finnish press took notice of the fact that Finland voted for Habitat's declaration of principle in spite of its drawing a parallel between Zionism and racism. At the plenary, the Foreign Ministry explained that Finland wanted to support the main issues discussed at Habitat, but underscored that Finland's negative stand on the parallel Zionism-racism remains unchanged.\n\nThe Swedish People's Party Congress supported Kekkonen's re-election, but left its individual electors the right to vote according to their conviction. The Party's right wing had hoped for the election of a candidate of their own.\n\nTowards the end of the summer, discussion flared up about the method of election and practical campaign arrangements. SDP Chairman Kalevi Sorsa suggested that all parties supporting Kekkonen get together to discuss practical election arrangements. 6.8. Liberal Chairman Pekka Tarjanne prompted switching to direct national elections. Throughout the autumn, SKDL and the CPF advocated transferring Presidential elections permanently to Parliament. (All non-socialist parties have supported direct elections, while the left has supported parliamentary Presidential elections.)\n\nThe Foreign Ministry announced that Cabinet does not look favourably on the participation of a South African team in the gliding World Championships at Räyskälä, as it is in conflict with our UN policy. State financial support for the Championships caused disagreement: Minister of Education Kalevi Kivistö (SKDL) cancelled payments, but his successor Marjatta Väänänen (Centre) asked for the Chancellor of Justice's view on the matter. The Chancellor saw no legal obstacles to granting state support.\n\nThe Committee supervising the free-trade agreement between Finland and the EEC reported that there was a considerable deficit in Finnish-EEC trade, although the deficit had decreased. The EEC Commission criticized Finland for not having stuck to the original schedule for dissolving our import deposit system. In March, Cabinet had decided to prolong the deposit system to the end of the year, because of the unfavourable development of the balance of payments on current account.\n\nAhlström Oy and Kemi Oy bought the West-German paper factory Kämmer.\n\nThe main points in Finland's reply to the UN Secretary-General's query concerning the special report on the question of nuclear-free zones were: the principle goal of establishing a nuclear-free zone is increasing security within the zone; the security- guarantees of nuclear-weapon states are of central importance, and membership in a military alliance or corresponding arrangement should not be an obstacle to membership in the zone\n\nPresident Kekkonen went on an official visit to the Soviet Union. Topics discussed in Moscow included trade and the IS-year economic programme being prepared, international questions and the CSCE. On 23.6. the President left on an extensive tour of the Northern and Eastern Soviet Union. In a statement for lzvestija, Kekkonen said that the state of Finnish-Soviet relations was excellent and that there existed a mutual desire for the continued expansion of our relations. The final communiqué stated Finland's readiness to endorse the general agreement proposed by the Soviets prohibiting the use of violence in international relations.\n\nNow that nearly an entire continent has decided not to participate in the Olympics, maybe we will understand that changes must be made in the organization of international athletics, observed Foreign Minister Sorsa. The International Olympics Committee bases its work on the denial of facts and can no longer carry out its function. International athletics organizations are clearly placing themselves above the UN, said Sorsa. 27.7. At the IAAF conference concerning the Montreal Olympics, the Finnish representative voted for South Africa's membership. Both Foreign Minister Sorsa and Minister of Education Kivistö considered this in conflict with Finnish foreign policy. 13.8. In connection with congratulating Finland's Olympic champions, President Kekkonen also stated his disapproval of the decision taken in Finland's name.\n\nThe unofficial part of President Kekkonen's third state visit to the USA began. 3.-4.8. The actual state visit took place in connection with US bicentennial celebrations. Speaking at the National Press Club, the President dwelled on the balance existing in our foreign policy, particularly in our commercial relations, and refuted views according to which Finland is economically tied to the East. Economic questions were high on the agenda, and Foreign Ministers Kissinger and Sorsa discussed the strategic balance in Northern Europe, the reorganization of the world economy and Southern Africa. On the eve of the visit, the Washington Post published an article by Swedish Göran Albinson asserting that Finland cannot make independent decisions in important questions. The article received sharp criticism in Finland, and on 15.7. the paper published an article by Finnish Jan-Magnus Jansson explaining the foundations of Finnish foreign policy and criticizing writings on \"Finlandization”.\n\nIn an interview for Soviet journalists on the anniversary of the CSCE, President Kekkonen stated that the CSCE Final Act had become a permanent element in international relations, a document referred to in the most different international contexts, and a part of school curriculums. The President agreed with the Soviet view that one way of achieving a serious discussion about disarmament would be to convene a world disarmament conference. In an interview for the Polish \"Polska”, the President said he was certain the CSCE meant a final end to the Cold War and reinforced the foundations for normal cooperation in Europe. In his anniversary statement, Foreign Minister Sorsa considered advancement in detente since the CSCE satisfactory. Sorsa pointed out that changes in international relations generally take place over a longer period of time, and stressed the necessity of taking the following steps in the fields of disarmament and economic cooperation, to ensure the continual improvement of relations. 20.11. Cabinet suggested to the ECE that an environmental conference be convened in the CSCE spirit and as part of its follow-up. The initiative was based on the Final Act as well as the Soviet suggestion for miniature security conferences.\n\nThe Finnish Rural Party asked its Chairman Veikko Vennamo to run for President. Vennamo did not immediately give his reply.\n\nThe exceptional nature of the elections and possible exceptional legislations were also topics of public discussion. \"Uusi Suomi” considered the elections exceptional in any event, as the results were clear from the Outset. 14.10. The Swedish Dagens Nyheter contended that the Centre Party was planning new exceptional legislation for Kekkonen's re-election. Party Chairman Johannes Virolainen refuted the charges and pointed out that in April 1975 President Kekkonen had issued a statement clearly saying that there would be no question but of a solution through normal elections.\n\nAn abstract, published in Hufvudstadsbladet, of the Soviet book by Bartenjev and Komissarov marked the opening of a debate lasting several months about Finnish neutrality and the FCMA Treaty. 6.9. Foreign Minister Sorsa underlined his assurance that Finland and the Soviet Union have no differences concerning the interpretation of the Treaty. 14.9. The Soviet News Agency APN dismissed the view that the Bartenjev-Komissarov book contains new interpretations of the FCMA Treaty.\n\nThe question of granting visas to the Taiwan Opera had long been disputed, threatening to create a foreign-policy scandal. The visas were finally granted on the condition that the Opera display no emblems connected with China during their visit. The Finland-China Society demanded that the visas be repudiated, and Finland's Ambassador to Peking was called to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The Finnish Foreign Ministry stated that our Government has consistently considered the People's Republic of China the sole representative of the whole of China.\n\nPrime Minister Miettunen's new centre-based minority Cabinet was appointed and the 5-party Cabinet was granted its resignation. The places in the new Cabinet were distributed as follows: the Centre Party (9), the Swedish People's Party (3), the Liberal People's Party (3), and one professional minister. Professor Keijo Korhonen was appointed Foreign Minister. Commentaries generally saw the Cabinet as a temporary solution and drew attention to the President's role in the choice of ministers.\n\nIn greeting Miettunen's minority Cabinet, President Kekkonen noted that since Finland's independence, 20 of our 59 Cabinets have been based on minority support. This causes some wonder abroad and is not always understood at home either. He saw it as due to our having too many small parties. This lent momentum to a discussion on the position of small parties and the justification of their existence — a discussion in which the big parties expressed their positive attitude towards a vote threshold in parliamentary elections.\n\nIn an interview, the new Foreign Minister Keijo Korhonen stated that there is general agreement about the main line of our foreign policy. He considered our foreign policy a success, but emphasized that it is not static. According to Korhonen, differences in shade with the line advocated by the Social Democrats are evident in questions of not vital importance to us.\n\nIn the communal elections, the Coalition Party became the second- largest party, increasing its support by 2,5%. The Centre Party also did well.\n\nThe votes were distributed as follows:\n\nSDP (25%), the Coalition Party (20.9%), the Centre Party (18.6%), SKDL (18.5%), the Swedish Party (4.7%), the Liberals (4.8%), the Christian League (3.2%) and others (4.3%). SDP and the small parties were the main losers. The Coalition Party's victory brought to the fore the question of the Party's participation in Cabinet and of its reliability in foreign policy.\n\nAt the UNESCO Assembly, the Finnish delegation expressed its hope that the Assembly discuss the follow-up of the CSCE Final Act in fields coming under UNESCO's competence. Speaking for Finland, Minister of Education Marjatta Väänänen recommended that the Assembly take politically and ideologically delicate decisions by consensus. A particular cause of disagreement was the proposed declaration on the principles governing mass media, which contained certain clauses, e.g. on state responsibility for mass media, that the West found unacceptable. Foreign Minister Korhonen had previously noted that the draft declaration was not in agreement with neither our social system, nor our way of life, nor the role of our media.\n\nThe Cabinet decided to open negotiations on the purchase of about 50 British Hawker-Siddeley Hawk training-fighters. The deal would be worth over 1 billion mk, and the question had long been under consideration. The competitors included the Swedish Saab 105-5, the Czech Aero L-39, the French Fouga Magister 90 and Alpha Jet, and the Italian Aeronautic Macci MB 339. According to Cabinet, the decision was to be based on the plane's technical qualifications, and would require adequate industrial compensation. On 17.11. SKDL's parliamentary group demanded that the purchase be dropped and the money used to boost employment. Buying the planes from a NATO country was seen as ill-considered. In Sweden, giving the deal to a NATO country and not our neutral neighbour also caused consternation.\n\nThe Cabinet decided to open negotiations on the purchase of about 50 British Hawker-Siddeley Hawk training-fighters.

In Sweden, giving the deal to a NATO country and not our neutral neighbour also caused consternation.\n\nIn its annual report, the OECD Development Aid Committee (DAC) noted that Finland's aid was one of the lowest among DAC members, and much less than the UN target (0,7% of the GNP) approved by Finland. DAC found it particularly worrying that the precentual share of aid in the budget had decreased, and recommended drawing up a medium-term plan for budgetary appropriation to development cooperation. Finland was given credit for increasing gift-aid, for the advantageous conditions of aid, and for directing aid to the least developed countries (46 %).\n\nFinland and Cuba signed a 10 million mk development credit agreement. On 8.2 three Coalition Party MPs had made a question in Parliament concerning the credit, asking whether Cabinet considered granting economic aid to a party to the war in Angola in conformity with Finland's policy of neutrality. In his reply Foreign Minister Sorsa contested that the credit was in conflict with Finnish foreign policy. He noted that aid should not constitute an attempt to influence the beneficiary's foreign policy, and that it is long-term work which cannot suddenly be changed.\n\nSwedish Foreign Minister Karin Söder's statements to Dagens Nyheter on Nordic cooperation were well accepted by the Finnish press. According to Söder, \"international” and \"Nordic” goals are not in conflict with each other, and the closer the contact between the Nordic countries, the better their chances for influence will be in the UN and other international instances.\n\nThe press reported that the USA will not be ordering tugboats from Wärtsilä. This was the conclusion to a much publicized chain of events which started when previous US Ambassador Mark Austad appealed to Congress to purchase Finnish icebreakers for the Great Lakes. The plan gained momentum during President Kekkonen's visit to the US, and had resulted in an offer from the US to buy Finnish tugboats.\n\nFinland and the Soviet Union signed their trade agreement for 1977, covering over 10 billion mk. The emphasis of Finnish imports from the Soviet Union was still on raw materials and energy sources, while Finnish exports were headed by metal industry products, consumer goods and foodstuffs. Soviet Minister of Foreign Trade N.S. Patolitshev drew attention to the small share of Finnish imports of machines and equipment from the Soviet Union.\n\nFinn-Stroi Oy submitted its final offer for the Kostamus project to Moscow. The project includes the building of a town for 9000 inhabitants and a 3 million m3 industrial complex as well as territorial work, and would employ 5000 Finns for 4-5 years. Finland had negotiated about the building of the mining complex for over two years, and made five offers which were all too high for the Soviet Union.\n\nIn a speech, Soviet Ambassador V.S. Stepanov saw the coming year as offering Finland and the Soviet Union an opportunity to jointly celebrate the anniversaries of Finland's independence (6.12.) and the October Revolution (7.11.). The right wing of the Coalition Party considered the speech an infringement on the celebration of Finland's independence and made a question about the matter in Parliament. In his reply, Foreign Minister Korhonen said that since 1950 the month between these two days had been observed as a month of friendship, and that Cabinet saw fit to continue this well-found practice.\n\nAt the UNGA, Finland voted for a resolution on the revision of the international development strategy of the Second Development Decade, but explained that while Finland accepts the UN target for official development assistance, she is not able to accept a fixed date for the achievement of the target.\n\nPresident Kekkonen travelled to the Soviet Union to congratulate Party Secretary Brezhnev on his 70th birthday. Brezhnev was awarded Finland's highest decoration, the Grand Cross with collar of the White Rose of Finland. The Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter published an open letter by a Soviet exile claiming that Finland returned Soviet Refugees who had crossed the border, in conflict with the UN Convention on Refugees. 23.12. The Foreign Ministry sent the paper a reply explaining Finland's position. Finland is a party to the convention on Refugees, and officials abide by our Statute on Foreigners according to which the Ministry of the Interior can grant political asylum. Finland and the Soviet Union also have an agreement on border peace, with stipulations against the unauthorized crossing of the border. Press commentaries noted that the agreements may come in conflict with one another."
