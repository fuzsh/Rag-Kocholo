        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: 11.03.2024\n\nJoint statement from organizers of Nordic music industry petitions to ban Israel from Eurovision Song Contest:\n\nMore than 4000 musicians, artists and music industry professionals in all five Nordic countries have signed petitions calling for Israel to be banned from the Eurovision Song Contest. Additionally the Finnish and Icelandic petitions demand that the national broadcasters withdraw from the contest in the case that Israel is allowed to participate. The petitions were organized by groups of music industry professionals in each country between January and March 2024. Signatories include many ESC contestants from previous years.\n\nThe demands are a reaction to Israel’s mass killings and starvation of Palestinians in Gaza during the past five months in addition to Israel’s occupation of Palestine and its apartheid politics that have been going on for 75 years. Meanwhile genocide charges have been brought up against Israel in the International Court of Justice. We feel strongly that Israel should not be given the opportunity to polish its public image on the Eurovision stage and thus use it to cover up and continue its human rights violations.\n\nThe European Broadcast Union EBU has thus far not moved to exclude Israel from the contest. This is inconsistent with and in stark contrast to its quick decision to ban Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nEBU’s arguments for Israel’s participation do not hold water\n\nThe EBU has justified its stance by claiming that ESC is not a political event. Israel’s government has made it clear that the country’s participation in the contest is politically important. It was only after intervention by president Isaac Herzog and ministers that the Israeli public broadcaster Kan agreed to change the lyrics to its song in order to stay in the competition, after their initial entry was flagged as \"too political\". Herzog said “I think it’s important for Israel to appear in Eurovision, and this is also a statement because there are haters who try to drive us off every stage,” thus acknowledging the contest’s PR value amidst international critique. EBU’s decision to allow Israel to participate is just as political as excluding it.\n\nThe EBU has stated that ESC is not a competition between governments. However it makes no difference whether Kan is part of the Israeli government or an independent corporation because the end result is the same. The artists represent their countries and wave their flags.\n\nThe EBU has also stated that Kan has not violated EBU’s rules. In light of videos on the internet it is clear that Kan has repeatedly broken EBU rules when it has published content that slanders Palestinians and glorifies their murdering.\n\nIt seems the EBU has financial or political dependencies that affect their judgement. While it should be the EBU’s responsibility to ensure the contest’s ethicality, it may well be that such action will take place only after national broadcasters threaten to boycott the event as was the case in 2022. If Israel is not banned this year we anticipate boycott demands around Europe to strengthen in the future. The events in Gaza opened the floodgates and there is no return to business as usual.\n\nMedia contacts for the working groups organizing the petitions:\n\nDenmark: musikbrancheopraab@gmail.com\n\nFinland: viisuboikotti.taps726@slmails.com (Media contact: Lukas Korpelainen)\n\nIceland: marsanivioletta@gmail.com (Media contact: Lóa Hjálmtýsdóttir)\n\nNorway: martewulff@gmail.com (Aksjonsgruppe for Palestina v/Marte Wulff)\n\nSweden: hej@artistuppropet.se\n\nLinks to the Nordic petitions and lists of signatories:\n\nDenmark:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSUsH_l3-KiCJXpMwDfymlwxnIx2bCdncvQ5t5I1HfeMcPrXJsKhDQUW52MkFSpKfH9FoLaweMv74yi/pubhtml (signatures) &http://www.tinyurl.com/boykotisrael (petition)\n\nFinland:https://tinyurl.com/viisuboikotti\n\nIceland:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pYtANw_0S7UslNKkN2f2ZWrSL_H8APXc_XSIQdPTbao\n\nNorway:https://docs.google.com/document/d/15KOhQWJVdEn2PIu1j-dTJHvujkrRG8AUZeQsnmMo1H8"
