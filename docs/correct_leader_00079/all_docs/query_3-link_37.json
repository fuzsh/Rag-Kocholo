        "text": "Summary\n\nAfter the upheavals of Finnish independence in 1917 and a civil war, the United States and Finland enjoyed friendly diplomatic relations. The two countries entered into several agreements regarding trade, debt, extradition and other commercial and cultural ties during the 1920s. During the Great Depression of the 1930’s, Finland was the only nation to continue to pay off debts it owed to the United States from World War I.\n\nFollowing the 1939 Soviet attack on Finland and subsequent “Winter War,” Finland allied with Germany to obtain supplies and military assistance in continued conflict with the Soviet Union. This alliance led the United States to sever diplomatic relations with Finland in June 1944, though informal relations were reestablished a few months later and formally reinstated within one year. Between World War II and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Finland pursued a strict policy of Cold War neutrality. The United States, aware of Finland’s precarious geographical position, supported Finnish neutrality while maintaining and reinforcing Finnish ties with the West."
