        "text": "The Finns aren’t massively social as they are very hard to approach. I think that Finnish people don’t even realize how hard they are to approach. Things were a little different at university, but then, at university there’s a lot of alcohol involved and that tends to break down barriers. I definitely remember university also being kind of like, you know who everybody is, but you would never have talked to everybody, no way. Even if there weren’t that many people in your class, you never would have interacted with everyone. But I remember thinking that I don’t actually mind being awkwardly silent. I’m actually very good at it. I don’t mind sitting in the same space as other people without having them talk to me.\n\nOffices aren’t silent though. In Finland, employer branding is a very big selling point in the working world so I think that companies, especially these days, put a lot of effort into making the office a nice environment. That’s because they know it affects the employees so much that you need to have a happy workplace and somewhere that takes care of employees or otherwise they won’t stay. I think that’s definitely something that Finnish people value a lot so at every workplace, you are kind of taken care of. The people are kind, and they arrange things so everyone gets to know each other.\n\nTech start-ups are definitely a thing in Finland. I think a lot of people in Finland have the mindset of wanting to do something bigger, wanting to do something with their life. I think the education system is very good and there’s a strong entrepreneurial spirit in the country which gives them the impetus to go for it. As I said before, the tech start-up atmosphere is very different than the large corporations. You can go to the office in gym clothes, and nobody cares, and you can even go to the gym in the middle of the day and it’s not that big of a deal. You’re trusted to do what you do best without someone standing over you all the time. I mean it’s a very different environment and I think in general, start-ups kind of want to do everything themselves and come up with their own working system.\n\nHelsinki is 100% the place for Finnish start-ups. I think Finland is a very centralised country in a sense because we only have one large city and two medium sized cities and the rest are quite small. So, Helsinki has naturally attracted a lot of the capable workforce and it’s actually been an issue on the surface for a few years to try to attract people to other places. It’s kind of a vicious circle in that you have to move to central Helsinki in order to get a job, so that’s where the talent goes and that’s also where the companies get founded, and until people move to other areas that will just continue."
