        "text": "Since opening our Helsinki office in 1992, the level and complexity of our work in Finland has consistently placed us in the top tier of law firms in the country, and White & Case stands out as the only global law firm with a local presence in Finland. Composed of about 20 lawyers, six of whom are partners, our Helsinki team focuses on mergers and acquisitions, capital markets, bank finance and large real estate transactions, principally in Finland and other Nordic countries.\n\nOur success depends on recruiting and developing the best legal talent, so we can continue to offer the market-leading services that we are known for. As an associate, you will have the opportunity to grow and learn as you work alongside colleagues who are leaders in their field. Working regularly on cross-border transactions, you will be in daily contact with our international clients, making connections with lawyers from across White & Caseâ€™s global network. Our culture is hard-working, but collegial. Committed to helping you reach the pinnacle of your career, we provide a range of training programs, as well as mentorships available at the senior associate and partner level.\n\nThe core practices in our Helsinki office are Mergers and Acquisitions, Capital Markets and Debt Finance. We regularly advise clients including multinational corporates, financial institutions and private equity firms on cross-border transactions across the full range of business sectors. In addition to our three main practice groups, we also advise clients on Real Estate and Regulatory matters.\n\nWhat we offer is unique in the Nordic region. We are a global law firm with expertise in complex, cross-border financial and transactional matters, with a local presence in Finland. We advise Finnish clients on their activities within Finland and around the world and non-Finnish clients in their Finnish and regional activities.\n\nTypically, new associates are assigned to one of our three main practice groups. However, there may be opportunities to work in other practice areas when required by the staffing needs of the Firm or a particular client. All our associates are encouraged to participate in our Firm-wide, practice and industry-specific seminars and training programs."
