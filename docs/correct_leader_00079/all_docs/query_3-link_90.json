In automation and robotics the focus is, especially in the manufacturing industry. Cybersecurity provides solutions, including cyber security auditing and security, for various target groups; e.g. healthcare sector, banks, SMEs etc. Education is a crosscutting theme, where regions have excellence in all educational levels and there is a strong focus on lifelong learning. Energy includes smart grids, battery technologies and renewable energy. Bioeconomy strengths are in food production and in forestry, where regions provide novel solutions in products and processes. Circular economy is the core of bioeconomy. Health and wellbeing focus is on prevention, and enabling technological solutions."
