By his own account, he had a vision of a golden cloud of light on a street corner in West Baltimore in 1972, which helped him turn his previously desperate life around; for his new self he adopted the name Kweisi Mfume, an African name said to mean \"conquering son of kings.\" In 1979 he was elected to the Baltimore City Council, and in 1986 to the U.S. House of Representatives where - as a member of the Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs committee - he was active in housing, welfare reform, and environmental legislation. He became chairman of the influential Congressional Black Caucus in 1992. Mfume left his congressional seat in February 1996 to become chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The post had been vacant for two years following the dismissal of Benjamin Chavis. Mfume pledged to restore strict financial controls to the organization, to improve its management and fundraising operations, and to reverse the decline in membership. He succeeded in bringing the NAACP out of a $3.2 million debt and restoring its reputation. Under his leadership, the organization began pushing for more minority representation at the top levels of the sports, entertainment, and media industries. He announced his resignation on Nov. 30, 2004 (effective Jan. 1, 2005). In 2006 he sought the Democratic nomination for senator from Maryland, but lost to Ben Cardin. He was elected to the House again in a special election in 2020 following the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings.\n\nMfumukeko, Libérat (b. 1964, Bujumbura, Burundi), secretary-general of the East African Community (2016-21).\n\nMgaloblishvili, German (Andreyevich) (d. 1937), chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Georgian S.S.R.

He returned to South Africa in 1962 and became commander of Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the ANC. He was arrested in a sweep by security forces on the ANC's underground headquarters at a farm in Rivonia in northern Johannesburg in 1963. Nelson Mandela, Mhlaba, and six others including Govan Mbeki, the father of future president Thabo Mbeki, stood trial for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government. In June 1964 they were sentenced to life in prison and sent to Robben Island, the notorious prison on a remote island near Cape Town. Together with other Rivonia defendants, Mhlaba was released in 1989.

Sept. 8, 1857, Haynau, Prussia - d. July 24, 1936, Bad Saarow-Pieskow, Germany), chancellor of Germany (1917). He joined the Prussian administrative service in 1879 and in 1885-89 taught in the school of German law at Tokyo, Japan. Returning to Prussia, he was public prosecutor before reentering the administrative service in 1892. He became undersecretary of state in the Finance Ministry in 1909, director of the wartime department for cereals in 1915, and Prussian state commissioner for food supply in early 1917. When Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg resigned in the summer of 1917, the military high command, headed by Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff, Germany's actual rulers, secured the appointment of the colourless Michaelis as his successor. He was totally unqualified for the chancellorship and could maintain himself only with the backing of the army. When the majority in the Reichstag called for his assent to its peace resolution of July 19 (indicating that Germany desired no annexations), he evasively agreed to it \"as I understand it,\" thus not committing himself further than the military might decide. In September, when he acknowledged Pope Benedictus XV's peace proposals of August 16, he likewise avoided any specific statement of Germany's territorial aims. When he supported allegations that the leaders of the Independent Social Democratic Party were to blame for a mutiny in the navy, he lost the favour of the Reichstag and so became useless to Ludendorff, and he was forced to resign on October 31. In 1918-19 he was head of the administration (Oberpräsident) of the Prussian province of Pommern.\n\nMichail, Maria (b. Oct. 14, 1973, Nicosia, Cyprus), Cypriot diplomat.

He was president of the House of Representatives in 1977-81.\n\nMichailidis, Ntinos (English Dinos Michaelides), byname of Konstantinos Michailidis (b. 1937, Limassol, Cyprus - d. April 6, 2020, Athens, Greece), interior minister of Cyprus (1985-88, 1993-97, 1998-99). He joined the diplomatic service in 1961. Before his first period as interior minister, he served as minister to the presidency. In 1991 he became an MP and two years later, Pres. Glafkos Kliridis appointed him again interior minister. In 1997 he withdrew from the government following a decision by the Democratic Party (DIKO) to leave its partner in government, but he returned to the post four months later. In 1999 he resigned shortly after being cleared of corruption allegations by the cabinet. The cabinet had absolved him despite an independent report which questioned the judgement of town planning authorities in changing building zones in an area where the minister later built a luxury house. The town planning department came under Michailidis' authority. Michailidis briefly quit in the midst of the row in late 1998 but then withdrew his resignation when Kliridis refused to accept it. He repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. His 1999 resignation came a day after the shock resignation of government spokesman Christos Stylianidis, who strongly disagreed with the cabinet decision to absolve Michailidis.\n\nMichal, Kristen (b.

He was first elected to the Storting (parliament) from Bergen in 1891, adhering to the \"Pure\" Left Party. In 1894 he returned to business and municipal affairs but he reappeared in 1903, when he was again elected to the Storting for Bergen, now as a member of the Coalition Party (conservatives and moderate liberals). Almost immediately he joined Georg Francis Hagerup's coalition government, first as a member of the Norwegian Council of State Division in Stockholm, then in 1904 becoming finance minister, but he abandoned the government in February 1905 in protest against Hagerup's extremely moderate policy in the growing conflict with Sweden. In March he was appointed prime minister in a new coalition; thenceforth he was the unquestioned leader of the Norwegians in the conflict that led to the dissolution of the union with Sweden. After the king of Sweden vetoed a law for separate consular representation, the Storting declared the union dissolved on June 7. On August 13, Michelsen called for a plebiscite, which overwhelmingly favoured independence. He met with some opposition, however, because of his willingness to compromise with the Swedes in the Karlstad negotiations in September and because of his definite stand for monarchy against republicanism. Haakon VII, a member of the Danish royal house, was chosen as king of Norway. Trying to preserve the unity of the coalition, Michelsen remained in office until 1907, when he retired because of illness. In 1909 he took part in the organization of the moderately conservative Liberal Left Party, but refused to be its leader; after 1910 he retired from political life.\n\nP.

He retired from politics after losing a reelection bid in 1962 but served as Canada's representative at various international conferences.

During his tenure he presided over the opening of Expo 67, Montreal's international exhibition, and he was required to sign the War Measures Act into law during the 1970 October Crisis, when members of the FLQ (Front de Libération du Québec) kidnapped a British trade commissioner and Quebec's labour minister from their Montreal homes.

When the new king took power, he made Micombero prime minister, but Micombero deposed him in November 1966 and made himself president. Temporarily he also was foreign minister (1967) and interior minister (1973). He pursued a conciliatory policy up to 1969, releasing political prisoners and trying to gain support from the Hutu. In October 1969, however, he announced the discovery of a plot led by Hutu officers, many of whom were executed. In 1972 the Hutu rebelled, killing some 2,000 Tutsi. The Tutsi reacted with a savage repression of the Hutu, in which an estimated 100,000 died. The government's role in this, and that of the army, remained obscure, but the division between the two peoples was now irreconcilable. In 1976 he was overthrown by Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and remained quietly in exile in Somalia.\n\nMiculescu, Angelo (Romeo Constantin) (b. Dec. 4, 1929, Constanta, Romania - d.

He became a candidate member (1971) and full member (1976) of the Politburo of the Socialist Unity Party.

He stepped down as D66 leader in February 1998. Elections in May 1998 returned the ruling coalition of Labour, Liberals, and D66 strengthened overall, but delivered a blow to D66.

He had yet to contest a general election. Under his leadership the ruling Labour government did not change any of its hardline policies, although he adopted a somewhat different approach. He continued his predecessor's intransigent attitude toward the opposition Nationalist Party but endeavoured to woo the hostile private commercial and industrial sector and to mend Malta's fences with Western Europe, the U.S., and the Commonwealth.

Oct. 25, 1921, Sinaia, Romania - d. Dec. 5, 2017, Aubonne, Vaud, Switzerland), king of Romania (1927-30, 1940-47). The son of the future king Carol II, he first succeeded to the throne (under a regency) on the death of his grandfather Ferdinand I, his father having renounced his own claims in 1925. In 1930 he was supplanted by Carol, but he was again made king in 1940 when the Germans gained control of Romania. In 1944 he played a considerable part in the overthrow of the dictatorship of Ion Antonescu. He announced the acceptance of the Allied peace terms, and declared war on Germany. His attempts after the war to establish a broader system of government were foiled by the progressive Communist domination. In 1947 he was forced to abdicate and since lived in exile, first in Britain and from 1956 in Switzerland. Following the overthrow of the Communist government, he tried to return to Romania in December 1990, but was expelled. In 1992 he made his first successful visit. In 1994 he was again barred from entering, on the grounds that his planned visit challenged the republican constitution. In 2007 his family palace was restored to him and he was allowed to return. In 2011 he marked his 90th birthday by addressing a joint session of parliament.\n\nMihail, original name Metodij Gogov (b. March 20, 1912, Novo Selo, near Strumica, Ottoman Empire [now in North Macedonia] - d. July 6, 1999, Skopje, Macedonia [now North Macedonia]), archbishop of Ohrid, head of the Macedonian Orthodox Church (1993-99). He went to a seminary at the age of 15. Nine years later he graduated with top honours from the theological faculty of Belgrade University. It seemed his vocation would be teaching. However, World War II disrupted these plans, and he returned to Macedonia, advocating independence and working for the restoration of the archbishopric of Ohrid, a symbol of the independence movement. In 1945 he was one of the prime movers in gathering 300 clergy to debate the issue, and was instrumental in persuading them to vote unanimously for independence. Soon afterwards, at a time when Yugoslavia pursued a stronger anti-religious policy than it did in President Tito's later years, Mihail was imprisoned for six months. He was jailed again in 1948-53. After 13 years back in Skopje, he began a kind of exile in Australia, establishing in Melbourne the first Macedonian (as opposed to Serbian) Orthodox parish outside Yugoslavia. The Macedonian Orthodox Church proclaimed autocephaly (independence) unilaterally in 1967, to the universal condemnation of all other Orthodox churches. After that declaration of autocephaly, only possible in a domestic climate which was less severe on religion, he became assistant to the Macedonian \"Bishop of Australia, America and Canada.\" At this time, he won the nickname of the flying Macedonian priest as he lectured tirelessly around the world, including London in 1969. He was consecrated as bishop of Vardar in 1988. This was possible only because his wife had died, enabling him, according to Orthodox tradition, to take monastic orders and thus be eligible for a bishopric. He was translated to the metropolitan see of Ohrid in 1993.\n\nMihailo Obrenovic III (b. Sept. 16 [Sept. 4, O.S.], 1823, Kragujevac, Serbia - d.

July 17, 1946, Belgrade, Yugoslavia [now in Serbia]), Yugoslav resistance leader. He fought in the Balkan Wars (1912-13) and in World War I. When, on April 6, 1941, Germany attacked Yugoslavia, he was a colonel and chief of staff of a motorized unit in Bosnia. After the swift conquest and partition of Yugoslavia, he organized underground bands of resistance (Chetniks), mainly in Serbia, to act in conjunction with King Petar's government-in-exile and the Allies. He was appointed general in December 1941 and minister of war in January 1942 by the government-in-exile. Another underground organization, the Communist-dominated Partisans, led by Josip Broz Tito, was operating mainly in Bosnia and Montenegro. In the autumn of 1941 the Chetniks and Partisans fought the Germans together, but their divergent political aims led to distrust and by the end of the year they were fighting each other. Mihailovic, fearful of brutal reprisals against Serbians, came to favour a cautious strategy against the Germans and Italians and there were reports of his collaboration with them against the Partisans. Favouring the more aggressive policy of Tito, the Allies withdrew their support from Mihailovic in 1944. After the war he went into hiding, but was captured on March 13, 1946, and charged by the Yugoslav government with treason and collaboration with the Germans. He was sentenced to death and was shot in Belgrade. Throughout the trial he denied any collaboration with the Germans and a U.S. commission of inquiry later cleared him and those under his immediate command of the charge.\n\nMihailovic, Vojislav (b.

He was elected to the Diet in 1937. He publicly opposed the drift toward war with the United States, and thus his political career was not hindered by the postwar American occupation. At various times he occupied 10 cabinet posts, including communications (1947-48), transport (1954-55), international trade and industry (1965-66), and foreign affairs (1966-68). He was chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (1961-62) and director of the Environmental Agency (1972-74) while also serving as deputy prime minister (1972-74). After the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) suffered severe losses in the June 1974 elections, Miki resigned from the cabinet in July in protest at the heavily financed electoral campaign directed by Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka and at rumours about Tanaka's financial irregularities. This was the first of a chain of events that ultimately led to the resignation of Tanaka in December 1974. Party faction leaders then agreed on the irreproachable Miki as the compromise choice for the party presidency and the prime ministry. He adopted the policy of limiting defense spending to no more than 1% of gross national product. His plans to reform the LDP foundered on the developing scandal over Tanaka's acceptance of large bribes paid to him by high executives of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. He demanded a full inquiry into the affair, but Tanaka's indictment in August 1976 still deeply hurt the LDP in the general election of December 1976, when the LDP lost its majority (though not control of the government). Miki, accepting responsibility for the setback, resigned but remained a powerful leader within the party.\n\nMikichura\n\nMikl-Leitner\n\nMikichura, Gennady (Ivanovich) (b. 1951), prime minister of Adygeya (2003).\n\nMikkelsen, Brian (Arthur) (b.

Feb. 9, 1964, Hollabrunn, Niederösterreich, Austria), interior minister of Austria (2011-16) and Landeshauptfrau of Niederösterreich (2017- ).\n\nMiklas\n\nMiklas, Wilhelm (b. Oct. 15, 1872, Krems, Austria - d. March 20, 1956, Vienna, Austria), president of Austria (1928-38). A member of the Christian Social Party, he sat in the imperial parliament, the Reichsrat, from 1907 to the end of the empire in 1918, and was a member of the Council of State and of the Provisional National Assembly (1918-19), of the Constituent National Assembly (1919-20), and then of the National Council (1920-28) of the new Austrian republic. He was president of the National Council in 1923-28, presiding over stormy sessions with philosophic calm and impartiality. With this reputation he was elected to the federal presidency. But despite the increased powers granted the president by the constitutional revision of 1929, he kept consistently in the background, drifting with the rightward, anti-democratic current of Austrian politics after 1930 without protest. In 1938, however, he refused Adolf Hitler's ultimatum to cancel a plebiscite on national independence, and another ultimatum to form a Nazi government. At Germany's threat to invade, Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg resigned (March 11) to make way for Hitler's appointee, Arthur von Seyss-Inquart, but Miklas still refused to appoint the latter, only giving way early on March 12, hours before the German invasion. On March 13 Miklas refused to sign the law uniting Austria with Nazi Germany, declaring that he was incapacitated from exercising his authority to \"certify that the act in question had been constitutionally adopted.\" He then retired from public life. After World War II he explicitly declared that he had not resigned in 1938; indeed the constitution had no provision for vacating the presidential office by resignation.\n\nMiklashevsky, Mikhail (Pavlovich) (b. 1756 - d.

July 18, 1901, Holsterhausen [now part of Dorsten, Nordrhein-Westfalen], Germany - d. Dec. 13, 1966, Chevy Chase, Md.), Polish anti-Communist leader. He was born in Westphalia where his father had gone as a migrant worker, but he was still a young boy when the family returned to its native province of Poznan (Posen), which was then part of Germany but was given to Poland after World War I. He fought in the Polish-Russian war of 1920 and became involved in the People's (or Peasant) Party. A disciple of Wincenty Witos, he was in the Sejm (parliament) by 1930. By 1937 he was head of the party. After the outbreak of World War II, he became president of the Polish National Council, which had been formed to replace the Sejm for the duration of the war. In the Polish government-in-exile in London he became deputy prime minister and interior minister in 1941 and after the death of Wladyslaw Sikorski in 1943 succeeded him as prime minister. In 1944 he was persuaded by British Prime Minister Winston Churchill to join Poland's postwar cabinet as a political counterweight to the Soviet-backed Communist takeover, and he returned to Poland in 1945 to become a deputy premier and minister of agriculture. His Polish People's Party gained widespread public support, but the Communist regime arrested and intimidated its activists, manipulated elections, and accused him of being a British spy. In fear of his life, he fled to Britain aboard a British cargo ship in October 1947 and then in 1948 to the United States. He got involved in exile politics and published a book entitled The Rape of Poland. But many Polish émigrés never forgave him for joining a Communist-led government. He was reburied in a cemetery of honour in the city of Poznan in June 2000, 34 years after his death.\n\nMikov, Mihail (Raikov) (b. June 16, 1960, Kula, Bulgaria), interior minister of Bulgaria (2008-09).

He joined the Bolshevik party in 1915 and became one of the leaders of the revolutionary movement in the Caucasus. He remained in Baku during the British occupation that started in July 1918, but in September, when Germans and Turks entered the city, he left by sea for Astrakhan with a group of comrades. A gunboat under British command intercepted them and escorted their ship to Krasnovodsk, and 26 commissars were shot. Mikoyan was held in Ashkhabad prison until February 1919 when he returned to Baku. In 1922-23 he aligned himself with the forces supporting Iosif Stalin against Lev Trotsky. He entered the Central Committee of the party in 1923; in 1926 he became candidate member and in 1935 full member of the Politburo. He became people's commissar (from 1946, minister) of external and internal trade (1926-30), provision (1930-34), food industry (1934-38), external trade (1938-49), and trade (1953-55). From 1937 he was also a deputy premier (vice chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, then of the Council of Ministers). Although he was apparently in danger of losing Stalin's favour, Stalin died (1953) before he could purge him, and Mikoyan retained his membership in the party's Presidium (formerly the Politburo). He subsequently supported Nikita Khrushchev in his rise to power, and ultimately became Khrushchev's close adviser and a first deputy premier (1955-64). In 1964, months before Khrushchev's ouster, he was elected to the largely ceremonial position of chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet (head of state); he stepped down in 1965, citing ill health. He was excluded from the party's Presidium in April 1966 and left the Central Committee in March 1976.\n\nMikroutsikos, Athanasios, byname Thanos Mikroutsikos (b. April 13, 1947, Patras, Greece - d.

Jan. 3, 1934, Kursenai, Lithuania), foreign minister of the Lithuanian S.S.R. (1988-90). He was also first secretary of the party committees of Kaunas city (1975-83) and Vilnius city (1983-87) and Soviet/Russian ambassador to Sierra Leone (1990-92).\n\nMikulec, Roman (b. March 18, 1972, Bratislava, Slovakia), interior minister of Slovakia (2020-23).\n\nMikulic, Andjelko (b. Jan. 23, 1959, Kocerin village, near Grude [now in Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]), premier of West Herzegovina (1999-2003).\n\nMikulic, Branko (b. June 10, 1928, Podgradje village, near Gornji Vakuf, Bosnia and Herzegovina - d. April 12, 1994, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina), premier of Yugoslavia (1986-89). A Croat by nationality, he joined Tito's National Liberation Army in 1943 and in 1945 became a member of the Communist Party. In 1964 he became a member of the Central Committee in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which he served as secretary in 1969-78. He was also chairman of the Executive Council of the same republic (1967-69). From 1978 he was a member of the Presidium of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia; in 1978-79 he was its acting president. In 1982-83 he was president of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. As chairman of the Organizing Committee of the XIV Olympic Winter Games, \"Sarajevo-84,\" held in the Bosnian capital, he demonstrated strong organizational skills and acquired a reputation for being a tough and interventionist manager. In the same year, he was made a member of the Presidency of Yugoslavia. In 1986 he was appointed premier under the unique collective system of leadership that had existed since the death of Tito in 1980. The premier was responsible mainly for Yugoslavia's financial affairs, foreign policy, defense, and regional funds; political matters were handled almost entirely by the CCP. When Mikulic was elected, however, there were hopes that because he had been a member of the CCP, he would also be able to influence it when necessary to enable him to bring about badly needed economic and political reforms. Social tensions were being exacerbated by the country's poor economy. Solving economic problems was difficult because the constituent republics, with their often \"nationalistic\" leaders, had so much power. It soon became apparent that he lacked the power and perhaps the will to carry out the reforms that he stated in his inaugural speech were necessary.\n\nMikulowski Pomorski, Józef (Karol Mateusz), h.

In 1995 he accused Prime Minister Józef Oleksy of having been a Soviet, and subsequently Russian, agent since the 1980s. This caused Oleksy's resignation in 1996, though he was exonerated later that year. In 2002 Milczanowski was charged with revealing state secrets.\n\nMilea, Vasile (b. Jan. 1, 1927, Leresti, Romania - d. Dec. 22, 1989, Bucharest, Romania), defense minister of Romania (1985-89). He was also chief of the General Staff (1980-85).

Her father, Frederick Edward Miller, was himself a parliamentarian of distinction, holding the ministerial portfolios of health and social services in 1956-61. She began her political career in 1976 when she was elected member of parliament for the City of Bridgetown in a by-election. A few months later she fought and won her seat again in the general elections. She served as minister of health and national insurance in 1976-81 and was the first female to sit in the cabinet of Barbados. Reelected to parliament in 1981, she was appointed minister of education with the culture portfolio being added in 1985. Following the 1986 elections when the Barbados Labour Party (BLP) lost at the polls, she was appointed to the Senate where she served as leader of opposition business. She was again elected MP for the City of Bridgetown in the general elections of 1991, and served as deputy leader of the opposition from 1993 until 1994, when the BLP was returned to government. She was reelected as the member for the City of Bridgetown for the fourth time. She was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, foreign trade, and international business on Sept. 7, 1994. She was also charged with the responsibility of leader of the house. In June 1995, her portfolio changed with tourism and international transport replacing foreign trade and international business. She was also, among other positions, chairperson of the Executive of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and of the Inter-American Development Bank's Women in Development Unit and president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region. She was replaced as deputy prime minister in May 2003. Later that year she was knighted. She served as foreign minister until the BLP's defeat in the 2008 elections. In 2018 she was named ambassador at large.\n\nBob Miller\n\nMiller, Bob, byname of Robert Joseph Miller (b. March 30, 1945, Chicago, Ill.), governor of Nevada (1989-99). A Democrat, he was elected district attorney in Las Vegas in 1978 and was reelected in 1982; he was elected lieutenant governor in 1986 and became governor after Richard Bryan was elected senator in 1988. He represented a second generation in Nevada public life - knowledgeable about the gaming industry, but utterly clean ethically - and was concerned about issues like education, workers' compensation reform, and welfare. With a rising population, Nevada was one state that needed to build new schools; Miller was proud of reducing class size. But he also held spending down and when he ran for reelection in 1994 boasted that Nevada was the third-lowest-taxed state, with a business climate rated near the top of the country (well ahead of California). He pressed for doubled penalties for crimes on school grounds and against the elderly and boot camps for non-violent offenders. He also tried to stop the nuclear waste depository in Yucca Mountain and opposed a federal gaming tax. He won reelection easily in 1990, but in 1994, despite the booming economy, he had serious opposition. In the primary he was attacked by Las Vegas Mayor Jan Laverty Jones for being too cozy with the gaming industry and not doing enough about crime. But she lost 63%-28%. In the general, Jim Gibbons, who upset Secretary of State Cheryl Lau 52%-32% in the Republican primary, pushed for his ballot measure to require a two-thirds vote in the legislature or a vote of the people to increase taxes. Gibbons was a rough-hewn candidate: his truck boasted a bumper sticker saying, \"Fight crime - shoot back.\" But the strong economy and a big margin in Las Vegas and Clark County helped Miller win 53%-41%.\n\nMiller, Charles R(obert) (b. Sept. 30, 1857, near West Chester, Pa. - d. Sept. 18, 1927, Berlin, N.J.), governor of Delaware (1913-17).\n\nMiller, Cyrus C(hace) (b. Nov. 2, 1866, Claverack, N.Y. - d. Jan. 21, 1956, New York City), borough president of Bronx (1910-13).\n\nDan Miller\n\nMiller, Dan, byname of Arthur Daniel Miller (b. Dec. 24, 1944), premier of British Columbia (1999-2000). He was a Prince Rupert city councillor before he was elected as an MLA in 1986, representing the riding of North Coast. He served as minister of employment and investment; minister of municipal affairs; minister of skills, training and labour; and minister of forests. He then was minister of energy and mines and minister responsible for northern development, and he retained those portfolios when he became premier. An intimidating debater known for his crankiness and salty language, Miller took over from Glen Clark, who resigned as premier following the release of a court document alleging he used his influence to help a friend get a lucrative casino license.\n\nMiller, David (b. Dec. 26, 1958, San Francisco, Calif.), mayor of Toronto (2003-10).\n\nMiller, G(eorge) William (b. March 9, 1925, Sapulpa, Okla. - d. March 17, 2006, Washington, D.C.), U.S. treasury secretary (1979-81). In 1978 Pres. Jimmy Carter plucked Miller from the business world (he was chief executive officer of the Textron Inc. conglomerate) to replace Arthur F. Burns as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miller was considered ineffectual as Fed chairman, serving one of the shortest tenures in Fed history. Already in 1979 Carter named Miller to replace the dismissed W. Michael Blumenthal as treasury secretary, making Miller the first person to have guided both the nation's central bank and the Treasury Department. He received mixed reviews as treasury secretary. While a capable manager of the department and the administration's point man on economic matters, he was not seen as a policy innovator or as a potent force against double-digit inflation. He directed the Chrysler Corp. bailout, with a $1.5 billion loan guarantee begun in 1980 that kept the automaker afloat. At first, he opposed providing more than $750 million in assistance, but Carter and Congress approved the deal despite fears that the government would be left to pay off private lenders if Chrysler slipped into bankruptcy. Chrysler recovered financially in the early 1980s and even paid off its debts seven years ahead of schedule.\n\nMiller, James (b. April 25, 1776, Peterborough, N.H. - d. July 7, 1851, Temple, N.H.), governor of Arkansas (1819-25).\n\nMiller, Jerzy (b.

March 8, 1838, Raymond, Miss.), governor of South Carolina (1828-30). He was also a U.S. representative (1817-19) and senator (1831-33) from South Carolina.\n\nMiller, Thomas (b. July 21, 1876, near Grand Valley, Ont. - d. June 20, 1945, Regina, Sask.), lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan (1945).\n\nMiller, Walter Dale (b. Oct. 5, 1925, Viewfield, S.D. - d. Sept. 28, 2015, Dallas, Texas), governor of South Dakota (1993-95).\n\nMiller, William (b. 1770, Warren county, North Carolina - d. Sept. 10, 1825, Key West, Fla.), governor of North Carolina (1814-17).\n\nMiller, William E(dward) (b. March 22, 1914, Lockport, N.Y. - d. June 24, 1983, Buffalo, N.Y.), U.S. politician. A seven-term (1951-65) conservative Republican congressman from upstate New York, he achieved fleeting fame when, in 1964, he became the vice-presidential running mate on Barry Goldwater's unsuccessful presidential ticket. From 1961 to 1964 Miller served as Republican national chairman and in this office gained a reputation for stinging partisan commentary. After his loss in the 1964 election, Miller retired from politics, but in 1975 he reemerged briefly in an American Express credit-card commercial posing the question, \"Do you know me?\"\n\nMiller, William H(enry) H(arrison) (b. Sept. 6, 1840, Augusta, N.Y. - d. May 25, 1917, Indianapolis, Ind.), U.S. attorney general (1889-93).\n\nMiller, William R(ead) (b. Nov. 23, 1823, Batesville, Ark. - d. Nov. 29, 1887, Little Rock, Ark.), governor of Arkansas (1877-81).\n\nZ. Miller\n\nMiller, Zell (Bryan) (b. Feb. 24, 1932, Young Harris, Ga. - d. March 23, 2018, Young Harris), governor of Georgia (1991-99). A Democrat, he was elected to the Georgia Senate in 1960, at 28; he worked for Lester Maddox in his last two years as governor, ran the state Democratic Party when Jimmy Carter was governor, was elected lieutenant governor in 1974 and held the office 16 years. In 1990 he finally ran for governor. In the Democratic primary he faced former Atlanta mayor, congressman, and UN ambassador Andrew Young; in this first statewide contest with a major black candidate, Miller won 62%-38%. In the general he beat Republican Johnny Isakson 53%-45%. He won by advocating a state lottery for increased education spending. He spoke in populist tones natural to him but, perhaps, was also inspired by - or helped inspire - consultant James Carville. In office Miller pushed through the lottery, appointed the first black woman to the state Supreme Court, strengthened drunk driving laws, and started boot camps for first-time offenders. He played a role in national politics as an early and effective Bill Clinton supporter. He got the Georgia primary rescheduled from Super Tuesday to a week earlier, on March 3; Clinton easily won, while Paul Tsongas and Bob Kerrey used up their resources. At the convention in New York, Miller delivered one of the keynotes, a riproaring \"Give 'em Hell, Zell\" effort; he worked Georgia hard for Clinton in the fall, and helped him win 13 unexpected electoral votes. Approaching 1994, Miller was in some trouble. He broke his earlier pledge to serve only one term, and he admitted his ties to Clinton hurt: \"There is no doubt he has gone into areas that were not the highest priority for a lot of us.\" He finally won, by 51%-49%, over Republican Guy Millner. He later served as U.S. senator (2000-05).\n\nMillerand\n\nMillerand, (Étienne) Alexandre (b. Feb. 10, 1859, Paris, France - d. April 7, 1943, Versailles, France), president of France (1920-24). He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1885 and became the leader of the socialist left, but when he joined René Waldeck-Rousseau's cabinet of \"republican defense\" as minister of commerce (1899-1902), he was bitterly denounced by many socialists as a traitor. When the various socialist factions united in 1905, Millerand dissociated himself from the party. He became minister of public works (1909-10) in Aristide Briand's first cabinet and helped suppress the railway strike of October 1910. He was minister of war (1912-13, 1914-15) under Raymond Poincaré and René Viviani. In 1919-20 he was general commissioner in Alsace-Lorraine. In January 1920 he became premier and foreign minister. His main activities were in regard to the application of the Treaty of Versailles; he also frustrated attempts to organize revolutionary strikes in May 1920 and supplied materiel to Poland during the Polish-Russian war. In September 1920 Pres. Paul Deschanel resigned, and Millerand, then head of the centre-right Bloc National, was elected his successor. During his candidature he expressed his wish to strengthen the power of the president by constitutional revision. This brought him into collision with the radical and socialist majority, which, under the name of the Cartel des Gauches, was successful in the elections of May 1924. Their press accused him of having exceeded his powers by intervening in the party struggle. Édouard Herriot, leader of the Cartel, when asked by Millerand to become premier, said he would do so only on Millerand's resignation. Millerand then invited Frédéric François-Marsal to form a cabinet, but this was immediately defeated, and Millerand resigned. He was a senator in 1925-27 and 1927-40.\n\nMillet, René (Philippe) (b.

He joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (from 1963, League of Communists of Yugoslavia) at age 18. In 1984 he became head of the Belgrade party organization. In 1986 he succeeded his mentor Ivan Stambolic as leader of the League of Communists of Serbia (LCS), and in 1989 the Serbian assembly elected him president. He reformed the LCS into the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) and in the first popular presidential election in December 1990 he was returned by a huge majority. In May 1991 Serbia blocked the accession of a Croat to the chairmanship of Yugoslavia's collective presidency, prompting Croatia and Slovenia and later Macedonia and Bosnia to quit the federation, leaving only Serbia and Montenegro, who constituted a new Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in April 1992. He was reelected in December 1992. In 1997, he finessed his way around a law barring him from running again for president of Serbia by being elected president of Yugoslavia, turning the formerly figurehead post into the seat of real power. Armed conflict in Kosovo between the Kosovo Liberation Army and the Yugoslav military intensified in 1998, and when Milosevic defied demands that he withdraw his forces, NATO launched air strikes in March 1999. Significant parts of Yugoslavia's infrastructure were damaged or destroyed, while Milosevic's forces inflicted enormous suffering in Kosovo. The Yugoslav parliament accepted the terms of a peace settlement on June 9, and within a week Serb forces were withdrawing as NATO peacekeepers entered Kosovo. In the September 2000 presidential elections he was defeated by opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica. Milosevic was arrested on April 1, 2001, and handed over to the UN war crimes tribunal on June 28. He was found dead in his cell before the completion of his trial.
