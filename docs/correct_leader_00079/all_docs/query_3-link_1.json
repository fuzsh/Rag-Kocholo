        "text": "Executive branch and cabinet of the government of Finland\n\nThis article is about the executive branch of Finland. For the entire governing system, see Politics of Finland.\n\nFinnish GovernmentFinnish: Suomen valtioneuvosto\n\nSwedish: Finlands statsrådOverviewEstablished27 November 1917; 106 years ago ( )StateRepublic of FinlandLeaderPrime Minister of FinlandAppointed byPresident of FinlandMain organPrime Minister's OfficeMinistries12 (list)Responsible toParliament of FinlandAnnual budget€55.8 billion[1] (2018)HeadquartersGovernment Palace\n\nSnellmaninkatu 1 A, Helsinki, FinlandWebsitegovernment.fi\n\nThe Finnish Government (Finnish: Suomen valtioneuvosto; Swedish: Finlands statsråd; lit. 'Finland's council of state')[2][3] is the executive branch and cabinet of Finland, which directs the politics of Finland and is the main source of legislation proposed to the Parliament. The Government has collective ministerial responsibility and represents Finland in the Council of the European Union. In the incumbent Orpo Cabinet, the Government comprises 19 ministers leading 12 ministries.\n\nMajority coalition governments have become the foundation of the Finnish Government; apart from a few historical exceptions, a Government is usually assembled by the representatives of two major parties and a number of smaller parties.[4]\n\nThe Government is the most important executive body of Finland composed of the ministers.[5][6][7] Its supreme powers are based on Section 3, Chapter 1 of the Constitution of Finland (and the subordinate Government Act of 2003[8]):\n\nThe governmental powers are exercised by the President of the Republic and the Government, the members of which shall have the confidence of the Parliament.[9]\n\nThe Government is led by the Prime Minister, considered practically the most powerful single office holder in Finland and often the leader of the largest political party.\n\nThe Government is composed of 11 ministries plus the Prime Minister's Office. Each ministry is led by at least one minister. Unlike the varying number and portfolios of ministers, the number and names of the ministries are fixed in law.[10][11] All ministers sit in the Government.\n\nThe Government itself proposes the number of ministers and their roles for the Parliament of Finland to confirm, and it is possible to reshuffle portfolios during the life of a Government. There are no senior or junior ministers, and ministers without portfolio are no longer permitted under the 2000 constitution. Ministers are not required to be Members of Parliament (MPs), although they often are. Each minister is assisted by a secretary of state (Finnish: valtiosihteeri; Swedish: statssekreterare), a political appointee who serves at the pleasure of the minister.[5][6][7]\n\nAlthough ministers' portfolios are divided among the participating political parties, the Government has collective ministerial responsibility, and the ministers are expected to follow a government programme agreed upon during government formation talks.\n\nMinistry Finnish name[12] Swedish name Prime Minister's Office valtioneuvoston kanslia statsrådets kansli Ministry for Foreign Affairs ulkoministeriö utrikesministeriet Ministry of Justice oikeusministeriö justitieministeriet Ministry of the Interior sisäministeriö inrikesministeriet Ministry of Defence puolustusministeriö försvarsministeriet Ministry of Finance valtiovarainministeriö finansministeriet Ministry of Education and Culture opetus- ja kulttuuriministeriö undervisnings- och kulturministeriet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry maa- ja metsätalousministeriö jord- och skogsbruksministeriet Ministry of Transport and Communications liikenne- ja viestintäministeriö kommunikationsministeriet Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment työ- ja elinkeinoministeriö arbets- och näringsministeriet Ministry of Social Affairs and Health sosiaali- ja terveysministeriö social- och hälsovårdsministeriet Ministry of the Environment ympäristöministeriö miljöministeriet\n\nThe Prime Minister may sit with a subset of the Government in a ministerial committee (cabinet committee), when it is not necessary or desirable to have the entire Government convene. There are government-specific and optional ministerial committees in addition to the four statutory ministerial committees:[5][6][7]\n\nMinisterial Finance Committee (raha-asiainvaliokunta);\n\nMinisterial Committee on Foreign and Security Policy (ulko- ja turvallisuuspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta; officially since 1922 and unofficially before that);\n\nMinisterial Committee on Economic Policy (talouspoliittinen ministerivaliokunta; officially since 1977 and unofficially before that); and\n\nMinisterial Committee on European Union Affairs (Euroopan unionia koskevien asioiden ministerivaliokunta; established in 1995 to replace the Ministerial Committee on European Economic Community Affairs).\n\nSee also: Law of Finland\n\nThe Government initiates the majority of legislation. A proposed act (Finnish: laki; Swedish: lag) is drafted in the respective ministry under the direction of its minister, after which it is reviewed by the Government and forwarded as a government proposal (Finnish: hallituksen esitys; Swedish: regeringens proposition) to Parliament for processing and possible amendments. However, since coalition governments have become the norm in Finland, the parties represented in the Government usually form the majority in the parliament, making the process somewhat more harmonious. Since 1957, all governments have been majority governments. Before a proposal is enacted into law, it must be confirmed by the President of Finland. As such, the president has the power of a delaying veto as a check against majority politics and potential violations of international agreements. Periods of cohabitation, wherein the president and the government represent different political positions, can create strife. The president's veto can be overridden by the Parliament, although this is in practice not done. Parties can also agree to not to vote along party lines but to leave the decision to individual MPs, although this is uncommon.[5]\n\nWhile the Parliament passes acts, the Government or an individual ministry issues decrees (Finnish: asetus; Swedish: förordning) as delegated legislation. Decrees clarify, specify, and guide the implementation of an act of Parliament, but cannot contradict it. They are similar to US standing executive orders. A typical example is specifying the actual monetary sums for benefits described in general terms in an act.[5] Decrees form an important body of law alongside acts of Parliament.\n\nState funds can be spent only in the framework of the state budget (Finnish: valtion talousarvio; Swedish: statsbudget), which must be confirmed by Parliament. The Government drafts the annual budget and introduces it to Parliament for discussion and approval. If the Government requires more funds mid-year, they have to submit an additional budget proposal to Parliament.[5] For 2018, the central state budget was €55.8 billion, not including municipal budgets and non-departmental bodies like state-owned enterprises.[13]\n\nMain article: Orpo Cabinet\n\nThe current Orpo cabinet is Finland's 77th Government, which was inaugurated on 20 June 2023. Out of the total 19 ministerial posts, eight ministers are from the National Coalition, seven from the Finns, three from the Swedish People's Party, and one from the Christian Democrats.\n\nFurther information: Orpo Cabinet § Ministers\n\nThe incumbent 19 ministers and their associated portfolios are listed below:\n\nPortfolio Minister Took office Left office Party Prime Minister20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister deputising for the Prime Minister20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Finance\n\nRiikka Purra\n\n20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Education20 June 2023IncumbentRKP Minister of Agriculture and Forestry20 June 2023IncumbentKD Minister of Defence20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister for Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Economic Affairs6 July 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Employment20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of the Environment and Climate Change20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of European Affairs and Ownership Steering20 June 2023IncumbentRKP Minister for Foreign Affairs20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of the Interior20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Justice20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Local and Regional Government20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of Science and Culture20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of Social Affairs and Health20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Social Security20 June 2023IncumbentNational Coalition Minister of Transport and Communications20 June 2023IncumbentFinns Minister of Youth, Sport and Physical Activity20 June 2023IncumbentRKP\n\nThe following is a list of all Finnish governments since 1917.[14]\n\nGovernment Took office Seats Parties Svinhufvud's senate 27 November 1917 103/200 Young Finnish Party\n\nSwedish People's Party\n\nFinnish Party\n\nAgrarian League Paasikivi's senate 27 May 1918 103/200 Young Finnish Party\n\nSwedish People's Party\n\nFinnish Party\n\nAgrarian League Ingman's cabinet 27 November 1918 77/200\n\n77/108\n\nNational Coalition Party\n\nSwedish People's Party\n\nNational Progressive Party K.
