        "text": "Our Patron:\n\nSaint Theresa was born Theresa Martin to Louis Martin and Zelie Guerin on January 2, 1873. At the age of 15, she entered the Carmelite convent at Lisieux, France. With the religious name of Saint Theresa of the Child Jesus and Holy Face, she lived a hidden life of prayer. She was gifted with great intimacy with God. Through sickness and darkness, she remained faithful, rooted in God's powerful love. She died on September 30, 1897, at the age of 24.\n\nThe world came to know her through her autobiography. \"The Story of a Soul.\" She described her life as \"a little way of spiritual childhood\" She lived each day with unshakable confidence in God's love. What matters in life is \"not good deeds, but great love.\"\n\nThe inspiration of her life and her powerful presence from heaven touched so many people so quickly that she was solemnly canonized on May 7, 1925 by Pope Pius XI. Had she lived she would have only been 52 years old at the time of her canonization.\n\n\"My mission - to make god loved = will begin after my death,\" she said. \"I will spend my heaven doing good on earth. I will let fall a shower of roses.\" Countless lives have been touched by her intercession, and millions have imitated her \"little way.\" She has been acclaimed the \"greatest saint of modern times.\" Everywhere in the world, her roses continue to fall.\n\nOur History\n\nIn the Beginning:\n\nThe first church of St. Theresa's parish was blessed on April 22, 1928. A new church was built and blessed on June 3, 1958. The Catholic community in Kihei numbered about 75 families.\n\nThe Growing Years:\n\nThe growth was steady and a new church was needed again. The present church was dedicated on April 27, 1985. This church has a capacity of over 600. This semi-rotund house of worship is designed in a contemporary style. It has a bell tower and besides the church proper, there are other rooms, all under one roof. The other rooms are the sacristy, chapel, reconciliation room, and bookstore. There is a hospitality room for receptions and other functions. At the entrance to the church is a painting on the tile wall of the patroness of the church, St. Theresa, known as the \"Little Flower of Jesus\".\n\nThe interior of the church is semi-circular to create the idea of community and allow the congregation to be closer to one another and to the altar. The floor is slanted theatre style to allow maximum visibility. Natural light, ventilation, and natural materials (wood, tile, stone) were used to create a unique setting. Besides planters and skylights, the stained-glass windows along the sides depict profiles of the Hawaiian Islands and the windows on either side of the sanctuary depict the glory of God the Father and the Holy Spirit, as a white dove. The motif of the Trinity is completed by Jesus on the cross that dominates the sanctuary.\n\nThe Corpus (body) was carved by Sam Kaai, a Hawaiian sculptor and activist. Christ's head is tilted upward as though our Lord were in conversation with the Father. His features are Polynesian. The inscription on the crucifix is written in Hawaiian and means \"Jesus of Nazareth - King of the Jews\". The massive Ohia log for the crucifix was brought over from the Big Island. The furnishings in the sanctuary are made of Koa wood. There are two statues at either extremity of the church, one of St. Mary and one of St. Joseph. These also have Polynesian Features and were carved by Louis Benanto, Jr.\n\nIn keeping with the liturgical reform, the Blessed Sacrament is reserved in a tabernacle in a separate chapel at the right of the church. The chapel is open for prayer all day long. The holy water fonts are appropriately giant clam shells. The simple Stations of the cross have tiles noting the number of the Station. The crosses are made from 14 different kinds of wood.\n\nHawaii Catholic Cemeteries\n\nIt is our pleasure to faithfully report that the first Phases of our new Columbaria are underway. Niches are now being purchased or reserved for our community member’s final resting place. In preparation for our upcoming annual Memorial Day Mass, we invite you to consider referring names to be included on our beautiful new \"Cenotaph.\"\n\nWhat is the Right Thing for You?\n\nEach of us must sooner or later prepare for our own end of life journey. Planning your own memorial and funeral benefits your family, and the community we are part of. Talking about and exploring your personal preferences; having open, honest, family discussions, provides you with the time to think through how best to manage your final wishes. It is certainly one of the most loving and significant determinations you can make for yourself, your family, and our Catholic Community at St. Theresa’s.\n\nTalking about my Funeral?\n\nIf we talk about it at all, we may use words such as “I want to be buried” or “I want to be cremated. “ Then, when death occurs, our family is left to guess, make decisions, and worst face costs, at a time of great personal stress and grief. Your family could be forced to debate what they think you would have chosen for your Catholic funeral arrangements and memorial at St. Theresa’s – if only you were still around to ask.\n\nRemembering Others?\n\nWe often do not remember the names and faces of those who built St. Theresa’s or who were Veterans from our community – can you help us remember and honor them at an upcoming annual Memorial Day Mass?\n\nWhat do I need to do?\n\nYou can pre-plan your funeral and memorial, and also help us remember St Theresa’s friends and family not yet memorialized. Recognizing the importance of making your own plans, and taking an active role, is the first step.\n\nWhen you feel ready, we ask that you contact and meet with our Director of Hawaii Catholic Cemeteries, Mr. Duane Pavao.\n\nDuane can be reached at 808-783-6778, or [email protected]\n\nParish Life\n\nThe heart of a parish is the Eucharist, but the parish family is the body that makes it a unique and vibrant community with an exciting parish life. Our parish offers a variety of ways to be part of that communal family in addition to the celebration of the sacraments.\n\nFaith formation is a vital element of Catholic life as we grow in knowledge and understanding of our faith in Jesus Christ and the Church he gave us. A deeper understanding can lead to a more intimate relationship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and through the Trinity to the Church and our family, friends, neighbors, parish, and community. Such faith formation is not just for children, but for all of us as we grow as Catholics. Our parish has many opportunities for faith formation that we encourage you to explore.\n\nAnother way to participate in our parish life is through the various parish ministries, including liturgical ministries, such as choir member, lector, altar server, and Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist; social justice ministries, such as visiting the homebound, serving the poor, volunteering at food pantries and the St. Vincent de Paul Society; and others, such as youth ministry, men's and women's groups, and the annual parish bazaar, to name just a few.\n\nGod calls us to use our gifts and talents to glorify Him and make life better for other people. Please prayerfully consider these opportunities for getting involved in ministry. And if you have an idea for a new parish ministry, please contact us.\n\nWith so many ways to be part of parish life, you'll want to stay informed by regularly reading the weekly bulletin. You’ll also want to check the parish calendar for a list of events and mass schedules.\n\nOur parish has a rich history in our town, being founded by people who trusted in the Lord and gathered under the leadership of our bishop. Who we are today is based on who we were yesterday. Find out more about our spiritual forefathers as you read the history of our parish.\n\nWe hope you'll also enjoy viewing photos of our parish, including some of the many enjoyable events and programs we've had over the years.\n\nAloha Committee\n\nAs the word suggests, we want to spread our Aloha to parishioners and visitors. We would like all to feel that celebrating the liturgy at St. Theresa is special. First impressions are important. We “show the love of Jesus to members and guests coming to church.\n\nWe station “greeters” at both entrances to the church for both Sunday morning masses. They engage those attending, trying to make them feel welcome. Additionally, greeters are positioned to answer questions from those attending.\n\nA welcome party is held quarterly at the rectory to provide a formal welcome and to provide information on ministries. Care and comfort cards are sent to families who have lost loved ones, and families who have relatives hospitalized, or have extended illnesses.\n\nWe are looking at “appreciation” events to thank those involved in the ministry. “Potluck” meals work very well for this purpose.\n\nContact: Betty Arsuaga, 808-276-2922\n\nKnights of Columbus\n\nThe Knights of Columbus is an organization of approximately 1.7 million men around the world. Organized in 1882, the Knights have embodied the selflessness of men as it has helped overcome adversity around the world. Knights are men of faith, guided not only by their belief in God and the Catholic Church but by their belief in each other. Knights are dedicated to making a difference and building a future. It is through five key areas of service – faith, community, family, youth, and fellowship – that Knights make a difference. Faith is their foundation. Dedicated to the Catholic Church’s growth and its good works, they support religious outreach and promote vocations in an effort to strengthen the faith that unites them.\n\nAs committed as they are to their faith, so are they to building their families and communities. Knights serve as valuable role models for other Catholic men as well as mentors for all children.\n\nSt. Theresa Parish has an active group of Knights. They meet monthly. They sponsor fundraising activities, like Sunday Brunches and Lent Fish Fries to raise money for projects at St. Theresa’s parish.\n\nThe Knights are participating in the Wheelchair Foundation, a national organization. This organization began by raising funds for and distributing wheelchairs to Afghanistan. Now regular distributions go to Mexico, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. The foundation also distributes wheelchairs to US Veterans.\n\nContact: Wesley Barut, 808-870-5821, Email: [email protected]\n\nFilipino Catholic Club\n\nThis is a statewide organization devoted to:\n\nSupporting the church\n\nBuilding fraternal bonds through social, religious, educational and athletic activities\n\nReaching out to meet community needs through programs of charity and service\n\nProviding comfort and assistance to sick and needy members\n\nSupporting active participants in various ministries and programs at St. Theresa Church\n\nWorking with other church organizations and especially with the Maui Council of Filipino Catholic Clubs, Diocesan Congress of Filipino Catholic Clubs and Filipino Catholic Clubs in other parishes.\n\nSt. Theresa has a large and very active Filipino Catholic Club.
