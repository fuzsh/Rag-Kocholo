        "text": "Religion has played an important role in the history of the Hawaiian Kingdom. When Christian missionaries arrived in the islands, they brought with them their belief system and built small rural chapels to huge cathedrals. The Mokuʻaikaua Church in Kailua-Kona on Hawaiʻi Island was the first Christian congregation. It was built in 1820.\n\nThe Church of Hawaiʻi, originally called the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, was the state church and national church of the Hawaiian Kingdom from 1862 to 1893. It was the ecclesiastical province of the Anglican Communion in Hawaiʻi.\n\nThe Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary was established by what is now the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu. They built the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, the oldest Roman Catholic cathedral in Hawaiʻi. The Kingdom’s first six bishops, from 1833 to 1940, were members of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. Other churches founded by the institute include Saint Joseph Catholic Church in Hilo and Maria Lanakila Catholic Church on Maui.\n\nBy the time the Portuguese migrated to Hawaiʻi many churches were already established. Most of the immigrants attended Catholic churches, however, many attended Hawaiian or Protestant churches.\n\nOur database of Hawaiʻi’s churches is a new project. We continue to add more churches to this list. Please check back with us again.\n\nMahalo nui loa to Sue Ann Pacheco Chun, B.Ed., P.D for her her time and dedication to compiling this list of Churches in Hawaiʻi.\n\nCHURCHES IN THE HAWAIIAN KINGDOM WITH PORTUGUESE CONNECTIONS\n\nCounty of Kauaʻi\n\nHoly Cross Catholic Church\n\nLocated at 2-2370 Kaumualiՙi Hwy. in Kalāheo.
