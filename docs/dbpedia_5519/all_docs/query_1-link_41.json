        "text": "CHAPTER X\n\nVenereal Diseases\n\nThomas H. Sternberg, M.D., Ernest B. Howard, M.D., Leonard A. Dewey, M.D., and Paul Padget, M.D.\n\nPart I. Zone of Interior\n\nSIGNIFICANT POLICIES IN PREVENTION AND CONTROL\n\nOn 31 May 1912, the War Department published General Orders No. 17 containing specific measures for venereal disease control. This directive was based on evidence and data collected between 1900 and 1912, particularly during the last 4 years of the period. Among the measures ordered were those providing for compulsory prophylaxis, disciplinary measures, physical inspections, education, and early treatment. The introduction of these practices was followed by a decline in venereal disease rates which continued, except for the period of World War I, until the eve of World War II.\n\nThe advent of World War II saw the expansion of existing measures, the elimination of some, and the introduction of important new policies and practices. These changes were predicated by the monumental expansion of the Army and its wide dispersion throughout all parts of the world. Many of the most difficult problems were geographic in nature, due to differences in mores, cultures, and public health consciousness of the various countries\n\n1This chapter attempts to present the Army's experience in the prevention and control of venereal diseases from the beginning of mobilization in 1940 to the termination of World War II and during the immediate postwar period. The task of compilation has been extremely difficult because of the immensity of the Army venereal disease program, concerned as it was with 8 million or more men and women in service scattered over most of the areas of the world. Details of the treatment of venereal diseases, venereal disease education, and venereal disease activities in civil affairs and occupied areas are not fully discussed. As it was apparent, however, that none of these subjects could be completely divorced from prevention and control activities, they have been mentioned within the framework of the chapter. A detailed account of the treatment of venereal diseases during World War II will appear in volume II, Internal Medicine in World War II [in preparation]. The account of venereal disease education will be integrated into the chapter on health education in preventive medicine, in volume IX of the series Preventive Medicine in World War II [in preparation], and the handling of venereal disease problems in connection with civil affairs and in the occupation of liberated countries will be specifically considered in volume VIII of the same series [also in preparation].\n\nEvery effort was made to document this history. However, since the authors were either directly concerned with the making of policy and with operational procedures in the Office of the Surgeon General or were in charge of venereal disease control activities in the theaters of operations concerning which they have written, parts of this chapter were based on personal knowledge of methods and results. Some portions of the chapter dealing with problems in oversea areas were written by officers not directly connected with activities in the areas concerned. In such instances, the material was prepared from reports of those who had taken part in the activities recorded.\n\n140\n\nwhich the Armed Forces of the United States entered. Changes in the basic philosophy governing control measures manifested themselves in corresponding changes of policy such as the elimination of punishment for those acquiring a venereal disease, an increased emphasis on informing and educating the soldier on the venereal diseases, and an extensive contact-tracing program which was designed to cure and rehabilitate. Enlightened public opinion and ever-increasing interest in the venereal diseases by the population at large contributed to the firm and unequivocal stand which the Army took with respect to prostitution-that of suppression. The all-out nature of World War II required, more than ever, close cooperation and collaboration among the Army, civilian agencies and organizations, and the community in order to effect complete control. Finally, of utmost importance in bringing about changes in policies and practices was the discovery of new drugs and the innovation of new methods of treatment.\n\nThe Basis for Civil-Military Cooperation\n\nIt was recognized in World War I that a successful venereal disease control program required a joint effort by numerous agencies. In that war, the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Social Hygiene Association played particularly prominent roles in the control of venereal diseases. Civilian communities, especially in the extracantonment areas, launched extensive programs including the suppression of prostitution, venereal disease education, and improvement of epidemiological and treatment facilities. Unfortunately, with the close of the war interest lagged and the entire civilian program lapsed into a long period of relative quiescence which did not end until 1937, when Dr. Thomas Parran, Surgeon General, U.S. Public Health Service, published \"Shadow on the Land : Syphilis.\" This book provided the impetus for the reestablishment of a vigorous venereal disease control program in most of the States. With the allocation of Federal funds through the La Follette-Bulwinkle Act of 1938, the State health departments organized venereal disease control programs. As the growth of the Nazi power forecast World War II, the military services, the U.S. Public Health Service, and the American Social Hygiene Association, recalling their joint action in World War I, met to establish plans for another collaborative effort. Out of these conferences emerged a joint resolution formally titled \"An Agreement by the War and Navy Departments, the Federal Security Agency, and State Health Departments on Measures for the Control of the Venereal Diseases in Areas Where Armed Forces or National Defense Employees are Concentrated\" (appendix B). The resolution was more commonly known as the Eight-Point Agreement. The agreement was adopted by the Conference of State and Territorial Health Officers, 7-13 May 1940. It was promulgated to the Army by The Adjutant General in a letter dated 19 September 1940.\n\nThroughout the war, with minor exceptions, the close liaison and cooperative relationship established by this agreement between the Army, the U.S.\n\n141\n\nPublic Health Service, the American Social Hygiene Association, and, later, the Social Protection Division of the Federal Security Agency operated effectively to produce an integrated civilian venereal disease program.\n\nWar Department policy.-The policy of the War Department throughout the war was the repression of commercialized prostitution. The aforementioned letter, published by the War Department on 19 September 1940, called the attention of commanding officers to this policy and directed their adherence to it. On 16 December 1940, another letter was issued by The Adjutant General enjoining commanding generals of all armies, corps areas, and departments to declare areas off limits for members of their command whenever local authorities failed to cooperate by eliminating conditions inimical to the health and welfare of the troops. Upon receiving information that certain medical officers were examining inmates of houses of prostitution as a protective measure in safeguarding enlisted personnel against venereal disease, Maj. Gen. James C. Magee, The Surgeon General, directed that a letter be addressed to surgeons of major headquarters to correct any misunderstanding or ignorance of War Department policy on the part of medical officers and their commanders.2 This letter stated that because of these actions the War Department had been misrepresented as condoning the commercialization of prostitution. Attention was directed to the two aforementioned letters, and The Surgeon General's policy was made clear and explicit in the following statement: \"It is recognized by those interested in public health that the attempted segregation and regulation of prostitution is of no public health value. Also, those interested in public health appreciate that in any attempt to control venereal disease unrelenting war must be waged on prostitution and the criminal exploiters of prostitutes.\"\n\nDespite these early, vigorous, and clear-cut directives by the War Department, a few line officers still seemed to misunderstand the attitude of the War Department and passively or actively supported commercialized prostitution activities in many civilian communities. In an effort to correct the attitude of these officers and to forestall adverse public opinion, a very strong Armywide directive3 was published. This referred to the lack of uniformity with respect to the enforcement of War Department policies governing the improvement of moral conditions in the vicinity of camps and stations. Reference was made in this directive to the letters that had been published previously on the subject of prostitution, and commanding officers were again forcefully directed to take every measure in support of local civilian agencies to suppress prostitution activities. This directive further stated: \"* * * Local officials will not be encouraged in any respect either directly or indirectly in\n\n2Letter, Col. Larry B. McAfee, MC, Executive Officer, Office of the Surgeon General, to the Surgeons of all Corps Areas, Departments, and Independent Stations, 13 Jan. 1941, subject : Cooperation With the U.S. Public Health Service in the Control of Venereal Diseases. Â\n\n3Letter, The Adjutant General to Commanding Generals of all Corps Areas, Departments, Armies, GHQ Air Force, Armored Force ; the Chiefs of all Arms and Services, and the Commanding Officers of Exempted Stations, 22 Mar. 1941, subject : Improvement of Moral Conditions in the Vicinity of Camps and Stations.\n\n142\n\nnon-enforcement of these laws and regulations and under no circumstances will military personnel or civilian personnel under military control be permitted to make inspections of any character of houses of prostitution.\"\n\nIn addition to this formal directive, the Chief of Staff sent a personal letter to all corps areas and Army commanders in which he said:\n\nThe Adjutant General is sending to all appropriate commanders a formal letter on the subject of moral conditions in the vicinity of Army camps and stations in which he summarizes the War Department's policy. Recently these policies have frequently been misquoted. A few weeks ago, for example, an ill-advised statement resulted in the impression becoming current that the War Department advocated segregated districts in the vicinity of Army camps. We were immediately subjected to a barrage of protests.\n\nIt will be extremely serious if our attitude on such questions is misunderstood, or if we lay ourselves liable to criticism either for lack of tact or lack of firmness in our dealing with civil health officers. The entire subject is too important to be treated as routine and it demands a uniform adherence to War Department policy. For this reason I am bringing The Adjutant General's letter informally to your personal attention and to that of the other commanders who will receive it.\n\nThe May Act.-By late 1940, it was becoming increasingly evident that local law-enforcement facilities for the repression of prostitution were inadequate in many communities. Recommendations, suggestions, and even exhortations by members of the Army and the Navy, the U.S. Public Health Service, and other organizations concerned with the problem were, in many cases, to no avail. There was no way to put teeth into their suggestions. These agencies, civil and military, were most ineffective in areas where the conditions were most deplorable. It was at this juncture that Congressman Andrew J. May, chairman of the House Committee on Military Affairs, on 20 January 1941, introduced in the House of Representatives a bill designed to suppress prostitution in extracantonment communities through Federal agencies, when local law-enforcement agencies were unable to achieve such suppression. This bill, H.R. 2475, was supported by the Army, Navy, and American Social Hygiene Association and was also the result of spontaneous congressional sentiment. On 3 March 1941, Congressman May wrote to Maj. Gen. James C. Magee, The Surgeon General, requesting his presence as a witness in support of the bill, if he favored it. Congressman May went on to say that if General Magee found it impossible to attend in person, he would be happy to accept a written statement from The Surgeon General which could be incorporated into the record. The Surgeon General replied to Congressman May by letter on 7 March 1941, agreeing with the purpose of H.R. 2475. Among the reasons given for agreeing with the bill were the following: Statistically, venereal disease was at that time the greatest single cause of noneffectiveness in the Army; disability and loss of efficiency resulting from this cause were completely preventable by means available; the source was at the time always to be found in the civilian population and lay without military jurisdiction; three-fourths of all venereal infections among Army personnel could be traced to infected prostitutes; and, during recent months, the\n\n143\n\ncontrol of prostitution in extracantonment areas had appeared as a major problem confronting camp and station commanders.\n\nThe bill was officially titled \"The May Act\" (appendix C) and became law on 11 July 1941. Described as an act to prohibit prostitution within such reasonable distance of military and/or naval establishments as the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy or both should determine to be needful to the efficiency, health, and welfare of the Army and/or Navy, it became more than the policy of the armed services: it was national policy.\n\nRemoval of Punishment for Acquiring Venereal Disease\n\nThe most important change in basic policy in connection with venereal disease control within the Army during World War II was the removal of punishment for acquiring a venereal disease. On 18 January 1943, The Surgeon General recommended to The Adjutant General that the law prescribing loss of pay or time for acquiring a venereal disease be repealed. The change recommended by this letter was revolutionary. It ran directly counter to established Army policy and conflicted with the opinion of numerous Army officers, particularly line officers. On no other issue revolving around the venereal diseases was opinion within the Office of the Surgeon General so divided. Those having experience with these diseases in civilian life were generally in favor of the change, while many of the more experienced medical officers remained unconvinced of its desirability. The question still occasionally enters the realm of controversy.\n\nThe basis for this punishment of individuals who contracted venereal disease lay in the act of the 69th Congress, first session, chapter 302, section 2, 17 May 1926 (44 Stat. 557; 10 U.S.C. 847b; ML 1939, sec. 1442) and was founded on the premise that disciplinary measures and loss of pay were deterrents to exposure on the part of military personnel to venereal diseases. It was becoming increasingly clear, however, that this act was not achieving the objectives for which it was designed.\n\nBrig. Gen. David N. W. Grant, Air Surgeon, Army Air Forces, wrote to The Surgeon General on 19 November 1942 stating that the application of this act was of particular concern to the Air Forces. It had led to the development of situations more dangerous than the venereal diseases themselves. Flying personnel were concealing the fact that they had contracted a venereal disease and, in spite of directions to the contrary, were flying while receiving clandestine treatment involving the extensive use of sulfa drugs. The Air Forces had reason to believe that sulfa drugs affected the skills involved in flying and no one receiving arsenical drugs was permitted to fly. The Air Surgeon cited the case of a flying officer whose death could reliably be attributed to anoxemia caused by the presence of methemoglobin resulting from the promiscuous use of sulfanilamide. The Air Surgeon mentioned that a survey of private physicians in the vicinity of Hunter Field, Savannah, Ga., revealed that they were treating more cases of venereal disease than the\n\n144\n\nstation surgeon. He strongly recommended that the Army regulations enforcing the act be rescinded in order to save the cost of concealed infections to the Air Forces in men, planes, time, and disruption of training and tactical service, and in order to improve the health, efficiency, and safety of personnel.\n\nOn 13 January 1943, Brig. J. C. Meakins, Department of National Defense, Canada, writing to Lt. Col. (later Col.) Thomas B. Turner,4 Chief, Venereal Disease Control Branch, Office of the Surgeon General, noted that the Canadian Armed Forces had discontinued hospital stoppages (loss of pay) for venereal disease since 15 May 1942. This action had been taken, continued Brigadier Meakins, to prevent the concealment of infection, and because of the considerable and increasing proportion of cases of nonspecific urethritis admitted to hospitals (particularly overseas), for which hospital stoppages could not have been made as a diagnosis of gonorrhea had not been readily possible. Brigadier Meakins attributed these findings largely to the increasing use of sulfa drugs with the object of concealment, and he maintained that punishment of only certain confirmed cases amounted to unfair discrimination.\n\nThe Subcommittee on Venereal Diseases of the National Research Council had on two occasions recommended repeal of the law. The minutes of its eighth meeting, held on 20 September 1940, contained the following statement:\n\nIn order to further the control of the venereal diseases, all provisions relating to forfeiture of pay and/or loss of time in the U.S. Army, Navy, Coast Guard and Public Health Service personnel infected with any venereal disease, whether or not such personnel is therefore absent from duty, and whether such disease was contracted at any time before or after entry into the services, should be forthwith repealed.\n\nThis statement was reiterated in recommendations made at the 16th meeting of the subcommittee held on 24 July 1942. Since the abolition of the act of 17 May 1926 would require an act of Congress, the subcommittee had also recommended at its seventh meeting on 6 September 1940 that the American Social Hygiene Association be requested to draw up a bill embodying provisions for repeal of the law and to discuss it with the Surgeons General of the Army, the Navy, and the U.S. Public Health Service, as well as with the Secretaries of War and the Navy and with the Federal Security Administrator, preliminary to its submission for congressional action.\n\nOn 10 August 1942, Dr. Joseph E. Moore,5 Chairman of the Subcommit-\n\n4Colonel Turner was director of the Venereal Disease Control Division, Preventive Medicine Service, early in the war and was directly responsible for most of the policies adopted. His keen knowledge of public health methods and his untiring efforts and tactfulness made many things possible which might otherwise have failed.-T. H. S. Â\n\n5Dr. Moore served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Venereal Diseases, National Research Council, throughout the war and as consultant to the Venereal Disease Control Division, Preventive Medicine Service, and The Surgeon General. Dr. Moore and the Subcommittee on Venereal Diseases never failed to respond to the call for help in all matters concerning venereal disease control and treatment. In addition, Dr. Moore was always available, day or night, for special consultation and made several trips to oversea theaters during the course of the war in response to special needs for his services. At the conclusion of the war, the President of the United States awarded Dr. Moore the highest civilian decoration, the Medal for Merit, for his great and unselfish patriotism and service.-T. H. S. Â\n\n145\n\ntee on Venereal Diseases of the National Research Council, gave his personal views on the topic in a letter to Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Hugh Morgan, MC, Division of Professional Services, Office of the Surgeon General, in answer to a request by Colonel Morgan for more information on which to base a recommendation for the abolishing of penalties for venereal diseases. Dr. Moore also stressed the fact that fear of future punishment did not prevent exposure to venereal diseases and actual punishment following their acquisition succeeded only in promoting their concealment and spread. He commented on the fallacy of classifying venereal disease as due to misconduct. It appeared to him that the soldier who acquired a venereal disease was no more guilty of misconduct than his more fortunate brother who, by sheer good luck or the use of prophylaxis, escaped. This matter of good and bad luck was also mentioned in connection with the loss of pay. The more fortunate man whose course was uncomplicated was treated on a full-duty status and lost no pay, whereas the more unlucky fellow, who through no fault of his own was incapacitated by the disease or by reaction to the treatment, was penalized. The effect of this law which was of primary concern to Dr. Moore was the fact that concealment of disease fostered spread of disease. A soldier who attempted self-treatment of venereal disease or received inadequate treatment from untrained civilian physicians was much more likely to infect other civilian women who in turn would infect additional soldiers. Dr. Moore stated that any public health measure which promoted the concealment of disease and thereby fostered the spread of that disease resulted in the ultimate disadvantage of both the civilian community and the Army. Dr. Moore also apprised Colonel Morgan of many specific instances found by members of his Subcommittee on Venereal Diseases wherein the venereal disease control program was adversely affected by the law in question.\n\nThe memorable letter of 18 January 1943, in which The Surgeon General recommended to The Adjutant General repeal of the act of 1926, was prepared by Colonel Turner with the close collaboration of Colonel Morgan. The writers used freely the advice and opinions of those mentioned above and, in addition, set forth at length the results of the Army's experience with the law. The highlights of the argument for its repeal are summarized in the following paragraphs:\n\n1. With respect to the concealment of disease, self-treatment, and treatment by nonmilitary personnel, these practices usually mean inadequate and ineffective treatment, more frequent resistant cases and relapses, unnecessary loss of manpower, and a resultant increase in the spread of the disease.\n\n2. The law is obviously unjust in that individuals differ in their reaction to treatment. Diagnosis is difficult and often impossible when just a few doses of sulfa drugs are taken. Furthermore, unlucky persons are branded with the stigma of being diseased due to misconduct, while others who escape are not. It is particularly unjust when an individual is liable to be punished if he fails to report the contracting of a venereal disease, is also absolutelyÂ Â\n\n146\n\ncertain of receiving punishment if he does report, and is removed from duty while being treated. In addition to being unjust, the law also places the Army in a most incongruous position concerning inductees entering the service with a venereal disease. The Army accepts an inductee as qualified for military duty and then immediately hospitalizes him and under law deprives him of his pay. Moreover, in such instances, it is impossible to determine whether or not the infection is the result of misconduct inasmuch as the disease was contracted at a time when the inductee was not under military control.\n\n3. The presence of this law influences the attitude taken on this whole subject, with undesirable side effects. For example, in some organizations, reduction in grade is made mandatory for noncommissioned officers who acquire venereal disease. The Army can ill afford to penalize itself by restricting the usefulness of men whose training may represent large investments in time and money and whose services are greatly needed.\n\n4. When men are taken from the relative safety of their home environment and placed in situations where the risk of venereal infection is many times as great, the Government should be ready to assume a share of the responsibility, just as it has always done in the case of other diseases.\n\nThe advent of new drugs for the treatment of gonorrhea has materially shortened the course of the disease. Therefore, the monthly venereal disease inspection provided in Army Regulations No. 615-250 is inadequate to prevent concealment since the only cases of gonorrhea that are likely to be discovered are those which have recently developed or those which have not responded to treatment from unauthorized sources.\n\nOn 27 September 1944, Congress enacted a bill repealing the provision included in the act of 17 May 1926 which provided for loss of pay for acquiring a venereal disease. War Department Circular No. 458, 2 December 1944, effected this change within the Army.\n\nResponsibility for Treatment of Venereal Disease\n\nTransfer of responsibility within the Office of the Surgeon General.-During the early administration of the venereal disease control program, the treatment of venereal disease was a responsibility of the Medical Consultants Division. However, because of the desirability of centralizing the responsibility for all phases of venereal disease control, Brig. Gen. Charles C. Hillman, Chief, Professional Services, recommended to The Surgeon General on 3 November 1942 that the treatment phase of venereal disease control be transferred to the Venereal Disease Control Branch of the Preventive Medicine Division. It was believed that such a change would serve to bring about a desirable unification of the venereal disease control program. The prevailing divided responsibility often resulted in uncertainty as to which office should initiate action or make decision on proposals reaching the Office of the Surgeon General. The situation thus created lent itself to inattention to or\n\n147\n\ndelay in the proper handling of matters of policy. It was suggested that the proposed change would in no way disturb the excellent working relationship between the Venereal Disease Control Branch and the Medical Practice Division, nor render any less readily available the help and advice of members of the latter Division. General Hillman further stated that the treatment of venereal disease was now highly routinized and that a majority of the problems presented were those concerned with administrative procedures incident to the handling of large numbers of venereal disease patients rather than with the more complex aspects of professional care. It was also proposed that a treatment section be added to the Venereal Disease Control Branch. These recommendations were favorably considered, and the Treatment Section, Venereal Disease Control Branch, was established on 12 November 1942 by Office Order No. 466. Maj. (later Col.) Thomas H. Sternberg, formerly Venereal Disease Control Officer, First Service Command, was assigned as the first chief of this section.\n\nDetermination of treatment responsibilities in the field.-The responsibility of venereal disease control officers in the field had never been clear with respect to the treatment of venereal disease. Conflict occasionally occurred between the medical consultant assigned to service command headquarters and the venereal disease control officers. In an effort to clarify this jurisdictional problem, the War Department published a memorandum6 directing that the service command venereal disease control officer serve as principal advisor to the chief of the medical branch in all matters relating to venereal disease, including treatment as well as prevention. The memorandum further directed that full utilization be made of such added advice and assistance as might be rendered by the consultant in medicine in problems pertaining to the professional care of patients with venereal disease. Following the announcement of this policy, the problem was resolved satisfactorily in most instances by the establishment of joint inspectorial and consultative duties. The venereal disease control officer directed his surveys toward treatment procedures with particular emphasis upon duty-status treatment and the followup of syphilitic patients. The medical consultant directed his study to therapeutic practices in the hospital.\n\nInduction of Individuals With Venereal Disease\n\nIn the early period of mobilization, persons known to have venereal disease were rejected for military service mainly because the facilities and personnel then available were inadequate to cope with the problems resulting from their induction. This policy resulted in the accumulation of a large backlog of rejected syphilitics, recognized by all concerned as a potential manpower reservoir which could be drawn upon at the earliest practical moment to fill Selective Service quotas. A similar situation did not develop\n\n6Memorandum, The Surgeon General for Commanding Generals of each Service Command, attention : Chief, Medical Branch, 19 Nov. 1942, subject : Venereal Disease Control Officer.\n\n148\n\nin individuals suffering from gonorrhea or chancroid since Selective Service Boards classified them as 1A until asymptomatic and then referred them for induction. Early in 1942, the Army training program appeared sufficiently advanced and the administrative and professional procedures well enough organized to provide diagnostic and treatment facilities necessary for the induction of men currently infected with, as well as men previously deferred because of, venereal disease. Accordingly, the Office of the Surgeon General initiated and developed the necessary plans, and The Adjutant General issued two radiograms to all service commands. The first of these, dated 7 December 1942, authorized the induction of registrants with uncomplicated venereal disease. The second, dated 10 December 1942, defined the types of venereal disease with which men could be inducted and provided regulations for the rate of induction of these individuals so that existing facilities for their management would not be overtaxed.\n\nMobilization regulations were revised to include authorization to induct all selectees with uncomplicated gonorrhea, syphilis (except cardiovascular syphilis, neurosyphilis, or other forms of visceral syphilis), and chancroid. Individuals with active lesions of granuloma inguinale or lymphogranuloma venereum were rejected. To assure the preinduction rejection of registrants with an abnormal spinal fluid, The Adjutant General, on 9 June 1943, authorized the commanding generals of all service commands to hospitalize for spinal-fluid examination all registrants with a positive serologic test for syphilis. Previously, registrants with a positive serologic test for syphilis had been inducted before a spinal-fluid examination had been made. As a result, individuals with an abnormal spinal fluid had to be put through the lengthy, time-consuming procedure involved in obtaining a certificate of disability discharge. The economy of this move was tremendous, considering the fact that from 15 to 20 percent of apparently latent syphilitic registrants were found to have abnormal spinal fluid.\n\nAn immediate effect of the Army's induction of syphilitic registrants was to relieve civilian health departments of a large part of their syphilis treatment load. The Army benefited by obtaining a large number of individuals suitable for military service at a time when the manpower situation was acute.\n\nORGANIZATION AND PROGRAMS, OFFICE OF THE SURGEON GENERAL\n\nIn 1940, the venereal disease program was still administered by the Subdivision of Preventive Medicine, and no specific officer was assigned to carry out venereal disease control duties. The activities consisted primarily of maintaining the syphilis registers of the Army and conducting the voluminous correspondence connected with them. However, the increase in active participation by The Surgeon General in the national program for the control of the venereal diseases required increasingly greater amounts of correspondence and necessitated many time-consuming conferences with venereal disease con-\n\n149\n\ntrol offices of the U.S. Public Health Service, the National Research Council Advisory Committee, the American Social Hygiene Association, and other organizations. Consequently, when the Subdivision of Preventive Medicine, Office of the Surgeon General, became the Preventive Medicine Division by Office Order No. 87 of 18 April 1941, the Venereal Disease Control Subdivision was created as a part of this new division. The functions of the new Venereal Disease Control Subdivision included developing Army policies in matters pertaining to the control of venereal disease, analyzing and recording venereal disease reports, collecting and filing syphilis registers of all cases in the Army and the Civilian Conservation Corps, effecting a periodic followup on \"cured\" cases of syphilis, preparing recommendations as to the management of individual problem cases, and maintaining liaison with other governmental and civilian venereal disease control agencies. Capt. (later Col.) James H. Gordon, MC, was assigned as the first chief of this new subdivision.\n\nToward the end of 1941, it was apparent that the Venereal Disease Control Subdivision could not carry out its functions successfully without the assignment of additional trained personnel. On 29 December 1941, in a memorandum to Col. (later Brig. Gen.) James S. Simmons, MC,7 Chief, Preventive Medicine Service, Office of the Surgeon General, Captain Gordon recommended the addition of one field grade officer trained and experienced in the clinical and public health aspects of venereal disease control, a trained statistician (officer or civilian) with experience in venereal disease statistics, and an appropriate increase in the number of civilian clerks. In addition, he recommended that additional facilities be provided for statistical studies, informational service, and research.\n\nThe Venereal Disease Control Division.-The Office of the Surgeon General was reorganized in March 1942. At this time, the Preventive Medicine Division became the Preventive Medicine Service, thus elevating the Venereal Disease Control Subdivision to a division. The internal organization and functions of the Venereal Disease Control Division established at the time of this reorganization prevailed to a substantial degree through the remainder of the war years. From time to time the division changed status, alternating between division and branch status as changes took place in the organization of the Office of the Surgeon General, but these changes affected little the internal organization of the Venereal Disease Control Division.\n\nThe Venereal Disease Control Division was primarily a policymaking and planning group with very few administrative or supply functions. In carrying out its mission, liaison with other divisions and services of the Office of the Surgeon General, other branches of the Army, and other governmental and civilian agencies constituted a major portion of its activities. Members of the division were in frequent contact with the various staff sec-\n\n7General Simmons (deceased), Chief, Preventive Medicine Service, Office of the Surgeon General, made many original and effective contributions to the development and carrying out of the venereal disease control program and in connection therewith bore heavy responsibilities.-T. H. S. Â\n\n150\n\ntions of the Services of Supply, the Army Ground Forces, and the Army Air Forces, as well as with the General Staff, itself. Representatives of the division were in almost daily contact with the U.S. Public Health Service, the Division of Social Protection of The Office for Emergency Management (later of the Federal Security Agency), the American Social Hygiene Association, and the National Research Council. A member of the division represented The Surgeon General on the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control. Colonel Turner, who had been assigned on 29 January 1942 to the Preventive Medicine Division, was designated to head the expanding Venereal Disease Control Subdivision and to develop the new Army venereal disease control program as expeditiously as possible. The Venereal Disease Control Division, as it was reorganized in March 1942, was able also to place into effect and supervise a new venereal disease control program which was to be carried out throughout the Army.\n\nBy mid-1942, the essential work of the division was being carried out by three Medical Corps officers, one Sanitary Corps officer, and three clerk-stenographers. (In 1918 the analogous branch had included seven officers and four enlisted men.) The internal organization was dictated by functional considerations into three branches-Preventive Measures, Civilian Collaboration, and Education. Colonel Turner was in charge of the division and also the Preventive Measures Branch. As chief of the division, he was immediately responsible for the work of the entire division and represented The Surgeon General and the Army on various committees and boards dealing with the problem of venereal disease. His primary concern as the officer in charge of preventive measures was the collection and analysis of reliable data on the occurrence of venereal disease, the study of rates, the evaluation of different forms of prophylaxis, and the procurement and assignment of specially trained personnel. The 85 or more venereal disease control officers in the field at this time were personally selected by Colonel Turner. The statistician, 1st Lt. (later Capt.) Stanley B. Russell, MAC, was also assigned to the Preventive Measures Branch. He assisted the chief of the branch and was personally responsible for the processing of syphilis registers, the analysis of raw data on venereal disease, and the carrying out of routine office procedures of the division. Maj. (later Col.) William A. Brumfield, Jr., MC, was in charge of the Civilian Collaboration Branch and, as the title of the branch suggests, maintained liaison with and assisted the division chief in coordinating the activities of various national, State, local, and private organizations which were participating in the effort to reduce sources of infection within the civil population. Additionally, he maintained liaison with the Navy Department. The officer in charge of the Education Branch was Maj. (later Lt. Col.) Gaylord W. Anderson, MC. His functions primarily concerned the study and development of various methods relating to the education of the soldier in venereal disease prevention and the preparation of material for this program. In many respects, these functions were on theÂ Â\n\n151\n\norder of a widespread advertising and selling campaign rather than strictly educational.\n\nLater developments and changes.-Colonel Turner became director of the Civil Public Health Division of the Preventive Medicine Service on 1 January 1944 and was replaced as the director of the Venereal Disease Control Division by Major Sternberg. In November 1942, the Preventive Medicine Division, Professional Services, was given responsibility for the treatment of venereal disease (p. 147) and the Treatment Section was formed, replacing the Preventive Measures Branch. On 19 September 1944, the Civilian Collaboration Branch was eliminated and its duties were assigned to the director of the Venereal Disease Control Division. At the same time, the Preventive Measures Branch was reinstituted and the Education Branch discontinued. When, on 6 January 1944, Capt. (later Maj.) Granville W. Larimore, MC, then chief of the defunct Education Branch, was made chief of the Health Education Unit, Preventive Medicine Service, the educational functions of the Venereal Disease Control Division were transferred to the Health Education Unit.\n\nConsultant functions of staff.-One of the most important functions of the Venereal Disease Control Division staff during the war was that of consultant to various field installations and oversea theaters. Staff members made frequent field trips in the Zone of Interior and overseas for the purposes of analyzing problems encountered at the various installations and of observing firsthand the venereal disease program in operation. This was particularly important in determining defects in the program and needs for changes or improvements. It also served to cement personal relationships with the men in the field-relations which proved to be of considerable value. In addition, special problems encountered in various theaters overseas were of sufficient importance that requests were sent to the Office of the Surgeon General for assistance from the Venereal Disease Division staff. A number of oversea trips were made in this connection including trips to Africa, the Middle East, India, the South Atlantic Command, and the Pacific.\n\nVenereal disease control for WAAC.-In response to a strong recommendation by a committee of the National Research Council pertaining to a provision for venereal disease control among female components of the Army, approval was granted in early May 1943 for the establishment of a WAAC (Women's Army Auxiliary Corps) Liaison Section in the Venereal Disease Control Branch. On 28 May 1943, Maj. (later Lt. Col.) Margaret D. Craighill, MC, was assigned to the branch as chief of the WAAC Liaison Section. Since Major Craighill's responsibilities with respect to medical problems of the WAAC soon came to extend beyond the field of venereal disease, which never in fact constituted a serious problem among this group of service personnel, she was transferred on 15 July 1943 to the Operations Service, Office of the Surgeon General, and the WAAC Liaison Section was discontinued.\n\n152\n\nORGANIZATION AND PROGRAMS IN THE FIELD\n\nEstablishment of control officers.-Shortly after the outbreak of war, the chief and various subdivisions of the Preventive Medicine Division drew up plans for a reorientation of activities toward lines specifically designed to meet the needs of war. In his 29 December 1941 memorandum to Colonel Simmons, Captain Gordon included the following recommendations with respect to the control of venereal disease: \"It is believed that the plan proposed by you of establishing a venereal disease control officer in the GHQ of any expeditionary force, the Staff of the Surgeon of each Army, Division, Corps Area (and Department), and each camp of 20,000 or more is fundamental to the success of the venereal disease control effort. This, along with the equally important and concurrent problems of finding the best qualified individual for each position and insuring that their services be used to the fullest possible advantage, represents in my opinion the greatest contribution that the office can make to the control efforts.\"\n\nThe proposed plan to establish venereal disease control officers in various commands had been submitted to The Surgeon General by Colonel Simmons earlier in December 1941. Both the Training and Personnel Divisions of the Office of the Surgeon General had approved the plan, and it was submitted essentially unchanged by The Surgeon General to The Adjutant General on 5 January 1942. In giving the background of the situation, The Surgeon General wrote:\n\nThe recent declaration of war has made it necessary to reconsider the Army's program for the control of venereal diseases in order to make such changes as may be required to augment and strengthen this program. The control measures employed during recent years have produced a very satisfactory decline in the disease rates and have been adequate for the peacetime conditions which existed; however, the change to a wartime status introduces many new conditions requiring additional facilities for the effective control of these diseases. For example, there will be an increase in the hazard of infection due to the development of a greater reservoir of infected civilians in contact with the expanding Army. Also the increased responsibilities and duties of the surgeons and medical inspectors of large organizations and units will further limit the time available for the important duties required in connection with the prevention of venereal diseases.\n\nAnticipating this situation, tentative plans were considered several months ago with a view to augmenting the medical staffs of such organizations by the assignment to them of additional medical officers who are specially trained in control of venereal diseases. Such an arrangement has been actually tried in one location, namely, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where Major Paul Padget, a reserve officer from The Johns Hopkins Medical School with special training in venereal disease control, was placed in charge of all diagnosis, treatment, and control activities. This arrangement has worked out in a most satisfactory manner and has resulted in a definite improvement in the venereal disease control program at Fort Bragg.\n\nThe Surgeon General then went on to inform The Adjutant General of a list of qualified civilian physicians which his office had compiled to facilitate the selection and procurement of the required number of officers. Stressing the\n\n153\n\nurgency of the situation because of the time it would take to commission these physicians, he continued:\n\nAccording to the plan a \"venereal disease control officer\" should be assigned as an additional member of the staff of the surgeon of each of the following organizations: (a) Headquarters, each corps area and department; (b) Headquarters, each camp of 20,000 or more troops; (c) General Headquarters; (d) Headquarters, Communication Zone; (e) Headquarters, each field army; (f) Headquarters, each division.\n\nThe \"venereal disease control officer,\" as assistant to the surgeon, should be utilized to supervise and coordinate the entire program of venereal disease control. This includes the planning, initiation, and coordination of pertinent and timely measures to bring about a satisfactory reduction in venereal disease in troops.\n\nIn addition, The Surgeon General specified the duties which these venereal disease control officers would perform.\n\nThe plan was approved by The Adjutant General and promulgated in a command letter to the Army in February 1942.8 Specifically, The Adjutant General authorized the assignment of a venereal disease control officer as assistant to the surgeon of each division, army, communications zone, general headquarters, corps area, department, and station complement serving 20,000 or more troops. General functions of these new venereal disease control officers were also mentioned, but, as for specific details, the letter stated: \"From time to time The Surgeon General will publish such additional instructions as may be necessary for the guidance of venereal disease control officers.\" With the publication of this letter, the position of venereal disease control officer was first established in the Army during World War II. It was a singular landmark in venereal disease control activities.\n\nTo effect the provisions of the letter of 6 February authorizing the assignment of venereal disease control officers to posts and command headquarters, medical officers with training or experience in venereal disease control and public health were selected, and many civilian physicians with venereal disease control experience were invited to accept commissions and assignments to key positions. In addition, arrangements were made for the training of medical officers at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health under the direction of Dr. Moore. Plans were made for the training of 100 officers for a period of 8 weeks and a refresher course of 2 weeks for certain officers already assigned to venereal disease control duties. On 21 February 1942, in a letter to surgeons of major headquarters, The Surgeon General stated (1) that selection of venereal disease control officers should be on the basis of established proficiency in this field and (2) that formal training in epidemiology and public health in recognized schools and experience in conducting a venereal disease control program in a city, county, State, or national public health agency were considered basic requirements.\n\n8Letter, The Adjutant General to Commanding Generals, all Armies, Corps Areas, Departments, Divisions, and Communication Zones; Commanding General, Field Forces; Chief, Army Air Forces; Chief, Armored Force, 6 Feb. 1942, subject: Venereal Disease Control Officers. Â\n\n154\n\nRequests from the field for venereal disease control officers exceeded their availability, and therefore, through more informal procedures, additional medical officers were assigned to selected installations for venereal disease control training. It soon became evident that sufficient medical officers trained in venereal disease could not be recruited to enable the assignment of a venereal disease control officer to each division. This provision was accordingly rescinded, by War Department Memorandum No. W40-6-42, dated 10 September 1942, and the duties were assigned to the division medical inspector.\n\nDuties and functions of control officers.-The functions and duties of a venereal disease control officer were specified in a previously cited letter from The Surgeon General to surgeons of major headquarters. These functions involved the prevention of venereal disease through a comprehensive educational program; adequate prophylaxis facilities-individual and dispensary; cooperation with civilian agencies in the elimination of civilian sources of infection; early detection, segregation, and adequate treatment of cases to break the chain of contact; the collection and the detailed analysis of data concerning the incidence of syphilis, gonorrhea, and other venereal diseases acquired by men in the units of the command; and continuous study of problems peculiar to the command with a view to recommending new measures. The venereal disease control officer was also instructed to reduce time lost per case through improvement of treatment methods.\n\nRedefinition of control program.-Toward the close of 1942, The Surgeon General considered it advisable to publish a directive redefining the functions of the venereal disease control officer and the basic measures of the venereal disease control program. On 14 November 1942, a memorandum was therefore transmitted to The Adjutant General recommending the publication of a War Department circular summarizing the different phases of the program. Only a portion of this memorandum was finally published in War Department Circular No. 53 on 17 February 1943. Nevertheless, this circular was significant in many ways. For the first time, the service command venereal disease control officer was clearly designated as the officer chiefly responsible for the integration of the civilian and Army programs. The responsibility for the provision of inspectorial and consultant services to staging areas, ports of embarkation, and exempted stations-activities not otherwise provided with such a service heretofore-was also delegated to the service command venereal disease control officer. The Army Air Forces had developed a relatively autonomous venereal disease control program which had frequently led to duplication of effort.9 This directive was designed to eliminate partially the conflicting and overlapping duties of venereal disease control officers assigned to service commands and those assigned to Air Force commands and stations.\n\n9Personal observations of Maj. Ernest B. Howard, MC, Headquarters, 4th Service Command, 18 May 1942-19 April 1944.\n\n155\n\nDual functions of control officers.-In many posts with a strength of over 20,000, where a full-time control officer was authorized, the post surgeon appointed the same individual as medical inspector and venereal disease control officer. To prevent this practice, The Surgeon General10 recommended that the combining of the positions of medical inspector and venereal disease control officer should be discontinued. As the need, however, for medical inspectors became more acute, the practice of assigning the venereal disease control officer to other duties-usually medical inspector or chief of the venereal treatment section-spread, and by 1944 few full-time venereal disease control officers were assigned to posts.\n\nProblems at ports of embarkation.-Early in the war when large numbers of troops were being shipped to the European theater, numerous protests were sent to the War Department from the command in the European theater with respect to the large number of troops arriving at the theater's port of debarkation with venereal disease. Major Sternberg went to the New York port of embarkation and to the numerous installations and camps used for staging areas to make a study of this problem. He discovered that soldiers to be shipped overseas were given 24- to 48-hour furloughs a day or two prior to their actual shipment. Many of these soldiers spent that time in one of the large cities on the eastern seaboard and in many instances were exposed to venereal disease. The ports of embarkation were doing careful inspections just before shipment, and soldiers found to have venereal disease at that time were held for treatment. However, since the incubation period in most of the venereal disease is from 3 to 21 days, many of the soldiers developed their venereal disease on shipboard or after arrival at the port of debarkation. The only solution to this problem would have been to give the final leave 2 or 3 weeks before shipment, but this was not considered fair or feasible. Nevertheless, the ports of embarkation were requested to carry out intensive venereal disease educational programs in an effort to reduce to a minimum the number of exposures and infections. At the end of the war, when troops were returning to this country from oversea theaters, this same situation occurred in reverse.\n\nCOLLABORATION WITH CIVILIAN AGENCIES\n\nU.S. Public Health Service\n\nEarly cooperative efforts.-On 16 January 1940, The Surgeon General suggested to The Adjutant General that the U.S. Public Health Service be requested to cooperate with the Army in safeguarding the health of military personnel by suitable measures of extramilitary area sanitation in connection with the concentration of maneuvering troops in the Southern United States. He noted that such cooperation would be directed particularly to\n\n10Letter, The Surgeon General to Commanding Generals each Service Command, Department, and Port of Embarkation, 2 Oct. 1942, subject: Venereal Disease Control Officers.\n\n156\n\nthe control of venereal disease, but that other problems of environmental sanitation requiring liaison between the Army and civilian agencies would also be considered. On 30 January 1940, the Secretary of War wrote to Mr. Paul V. McNutt, Federal Security Administrator, requesting such assistance. The Secretary reflected on the fine support that had been given to the Army by the U.S. Public Health Service during World War I and continued:\n\nIt is desired that the U.S. Public Health Service, operating under the authority of existing laws and using its own resources, cooperate with the Army in safeguarding the health of military personnel by suitable measures of extra-military area sanitation in connection with the present concentration of troops in the South. This cooperation is particularly desired at this time in regard to the increase in venereal disease which has been traced directly to organized vice in adjacent municipalities. Other matters of environmental sanitation will arise during the course of the coming maneuvers in which the U.S. Public Health Service can be of great assistance to the Army.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you as to the extent and character of assistance the U.S. Public Health Service will be prepared to give the Army.\n\nOn 12 February 1940, the Federal Security Administrator replied to the Secretary of War indicating that the cooperation and assistance requested would be \"extended gladly.\" He suggested that representatives of the two agencies confer with a view to determining the exact needs and the extent of the assistance required. On 23 February 1940, The Adjutant General directed The Surgeon General to arrange with the Surgeon General, U.S. Public Health Service, for a conference of representatives of the two agencies to plan for joint action. Such a conference involving Army and U.S. Public Health Service representatives was held, and on 18 March 1940, a letter was sent to the Commanding General, Eighth Corps Area, Fort Sam Houston, Tex., informing him of the consent of the Public Health Service to cooperate with the Army in safeguarding the health of military personnel and directing him to furnish the fullest possible assistance to the Public Health Service representatives.\n\nOn 5 April 1940, Dr. Raymond A. Vonderlehr, Assistant Surgeon General, Division of Venereal Diseases, U.S. Public Health Service, wrote to Col. (later Brig. Gen.) Albert G. Love, MC, in the Office of the Surgeon General with reference to the forthcoming May 1940 Conference of State and Territorial Health Officers at which plans were to be formulated for the provision of U.S. Public Health Service aid throughout the country for the fiscal year beginning 1 July 1940. In this letter, Dr. Vonderlehr suggested that it might be desirable for the Army to obtain commitments from State and local health departments with reference to the development of better health services in the civilian areas under consideration for future troop concentrations and maneuvers.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Public Health Service sent its representatives into the Louisiana maneuver area in accordance with the request of the Secretary of War. The work accomplished by these representatives was so satisfactoryÂ Â\n\n157\n\nthat, on 11 April 1940, The Surgeon General recommended to The Adjutant General that the arrangements made in the Louisiana maneuver area be extended to all other maneuver areas and that similar arrangements be established for extracantonment sanitation at all regular Army posts throughout the country. This request was favorably considered by the War Department, and on 29 April 1940 Dr. Parran was notified that The Surgeon General was authorized to make arrangements with the Public Health Service for further cooperation in extracantonment sanitation, provided the measure met with the approval of the Public Health Service. It was further suggested that detailed arrangements be made at informal conferences as was done in the Third Army maneuver area. To effect this extended collaborative program, The Adjutant General sent letters to the commanding generals of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Armies and to the commanding general of each corps area, informing them of the proposed project and outlining the general plan agreed upon by the Public Health Service and the War Department.\n\nOn 20 May 1940, Dr. Vonderlehr wrote to The Surgeon General making certain recommendations which portended the establishment of the extensive contact-reporting program. In this letter, he stated : \"Since the incubation period for syphilis is so long that relatively few cases acquired in the Louisiana-Texas area will develop during the maneuvers, it is apparent that the reporting of contacts suspected of being infected in Louisiana and Texas will do much to discover such contacts and bring them under treatment and control before the second maneuvers are held in this area in August. I feel sure that the State and local health authorities will be glad to cooperate on this basis if you are able to furnish the necessary information.\"\n\nOn 22 May 1940, The Surgeon General recommended that The Adjutant General direct corps area commanders to report to the State boards of health of Louisiana and Texas the source of infection of venereal diseases developing among soldiers after the return of their organizations from the maneuver areas. On 31 May 1940,11 a letter was published incorporating these recommendations, and the contact-reporting program had its inception.\n\nLiaison officers assigned to all corps areas.-The early improvised relationship between the U.S. Public Health Service and the Army was formalized in May 1940 by the adoption at the Conference of State and Territorial Health Officers of the Eight-Point Agreement (appendix B). In order to facilitate the operation of this agreement and to provide close liaison in all matters pertaining to public health, an agreement was reached by the Army and the U.S. Public Health Service to detail a Public Health Service officer to each corps area headquarters. On 28 October 1940, the corps area commanders were informed by The Adjutant General of these assignments and were directed to provide suitable office space and equipment and to cooperate\n\n11Letter, The Adjutant General to Commanding Generals of all Corps Areas, 31 May 1940, subject: Extension of Present Utilization of U.S. Public Health Service.\n\n158\n\nwith the U.S. Public Health Service and its representatives to the fullest extent.\n\nAttacks on Army venereal disease policies.-This well-established working relationship was temporarily shaken by publication in 1941 of a book by Dr. Parran and Dr. Vonderlehr entitled \"Plain Words About Venereal Disease.\" This book criticized the Army for what the authors considered its failure to take sufficiently drastic action against prostitution in extracantonment areas. Charges and countercharges were made, and eventually, on 27 November 1941, Mr. McNutt wrote to the President about the matter. Shortly afterwards, however, the attack on Pearl Harbor occurred. With the American declaration of war, what had threatened to precipitate a serious break in mutual confidence between the Army and the U.S. Public Health Service faded into insignificance in the face of the new responsibilities and problems facing both services.\n\nSummary of U.S. Public Health Service-Army collaboration.-With the exception of this temporary schism, the relationship between the U.S. Public Health Service and the Army from 1940 to 1945 was highly satisfactory and mutually advantageous. To a varying extent, every activity of the Venereal Disease Control Division of the Public Health Service during World War II affected the Army's program. Only the history of that division's activities (in the files of the U.S. Public Health Service) can tell the complete story of that collaboration and assistance. The success of the Army venereal disease control program in the Zone of Interior was due in no small measure to the active support and cooperation provided by the Public Health Service. The program of the Public Health Service constituted one of the most valuable contributions to venereal disease control during World War II. Important phases of this program were liaison activities at service command headquarters; cooperation in the contact and separation programs; support of State and local control programs by allocation of funds and assignment of personnel; distribution of educational literature, films, and posters; analysis of statistical data; support of legislation; establishment of rapid treatment centers; organization of public meetings; and extensive research activities (fig. 13). Some of these activities are discussed elsewhere in this chapter.\n\nAmerican Social Hygiene Association\n\nThe Venereal Disease Control Division of the Army and the American Social Hygiene Association maintained a close collaborative relationship in both World War I and World War II. As the only nongovernmental, private agency continuously active for many years in venereal disease control, the American Social Hygiene Association occupied a key position in civilian control efforts and through its educational, legal, and other activities provided invaluable support and assistance to the Army. The moving spirits of the American Social Hygiene Association, Dr. William F. Snow andÂ Â\n\n159\n\nFIGURE 13.-U.S. Public Health Service bus clinic. A U.S. Public Health Service physician demonstrates how blood test specimens are taken in these mobile clinics operated primarily in the South. (Photo courtesy U.S. Public Health Service.)\n\nDr. Walter Clarke had cooperated with the U.S. Public Health Service, the Army, and the Navy in World War I and were therefore able to bring their experience to bear on the problems of World War II. From the standpoint of the Army, the major contributions of the American Social Hygiene Association during World War II included the organization of local social hygiene societies and their sponsorship of public meetings to stimulate citizen interest; the improvement of State antiprostitution laws; the investigation of prostitution activities by undercover methods and the submission of reports of these investigations to the Army and other interested agencies; and the provision of extensive educational material in the form of posters, pamphlets, and films for use in Army installations (fig. 14).\n\nRole of the Association.-The role of the American Social Hygiene Association was formally recognized in Point Eight of the Eight-Point Agreement. As stated elsewhere (p. 140), the full text of the Eight-Point Agreement was published as a directive to the Army. On 16 December 1940, the attention of commanding generals of all armies, corps areas, and departments was again directed to the American Social Hygiene Association's activities by a War Department letter concerning control of the use of intoxi-\n\n160\n\nFIGURE 14.-Scene from the American Social Hygiene Association film \"With These Weapons,\" produced for the war effort. (Photo courtesy of American Social Hygiene Association.)\n\ncating beverages and the improvement of moral conditions near camps and stations. The American Social Hygiene Association maintained a central headquarters in New York City and assigned field representatives to each service command to provide liaison with service command headquarters. Thus, by the end of 1940, collaboration between the American Social Hygiene Association and the Army had been firmly established through the publication of directives and the assignment of American Social Hygiene Association field representatives (fig. 15).\n\nAntiprostitution activity of the Association.-One of the most important activities of the American Social Hygiene Association was its undercover studies of prostitution in all the larger cities and towns. The association conducted recurring surveys of communities and reported its findings to different Army command levels for information or action. In numerous instances, prostitution activities were first detected by these surveys, and action was initiated resulting in their elimination. Without the incontrovertible evidence provided by these surveys, the effort to repress prostitution and enforce antiprostitution laws would have failed in many cities because of resistance and obstructionism by prostitution interests, the apathy of police and citizens, and the difficulty of proving in court the existence of prostitution.\n\n161\n\nFIGURE 15.-President or American Social Hygiene Association confers with the three Surgeons General. Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur (center) discusses venereal disease control measures with (left to right) Comdr. C. L. Andrus, USN, representing the Surgeon General, U.S. Navy; Maj. Gen. James C. Magee, Surgeon General, U.S. Army; Dr. Thomas Parran, Surgeon General, U.S. Public Health Service; and Dr. William F. Snow, chairman of the Executive Committee, American Social Hygiene Association, Washington, November 1940.\n\nThe Army's venereal disease control program was also facilitated by widespread improvements in State and local antiprostitution laws that were brought about mainly through efforts of the legal section of the American Social Hygiene Association. Many States strengthened their existing laws, and others, with no previous legislation, passed \"model\" laws suggested by the American Social Hygiene Association. The association published an exhaustive study entitled \"Digest of State and Federal Laws Dealing With Prostitutions and Other Sex Offenses,\" Publication A-422. One hundred copies of this study were distributed within the Army to venereal disease control officers. The association also supported the May Act in 1941 and several other bills involving venereal disease control.\n\nStimulation of interest by the Association.-Venereal disease control programs, like other public health efforts, to an important degree depend for their success upon the maintenance of a high level of professional and Â\n\n162\n\nlay interest. The American Social Hygiene Association significantly contributed to this phase of the educational program by conducting well-publicized (fig. 16) Social Hygiene Day meetings each year in cities throughoutÂ Â\n\nFIGURE 16.-Social Hygiene Day, 2 February 1944. These and similar posters were distributed to and displayed in pharmacies throughout the country to publicize Social Hygiene Day and to get educational and informational material to the public. (Photo courtesy of American Social Hygiene Association.)\n\nthe country to which the Army, the Navy, and the U.S. Public Health Service, as well as local groups, were asked to send representatives (fig. 17). These meetings served to prevent inertia and apathy and often injected new enthusiasm into local control efforts.\n\nDivision of Social Protection\n\nDevelopment of the Division of Social Protection and its objectives.-Following adoption of the Eight-Point Agreement and the increasing evidence in early 1941 of commercialized prostitution in civilian communities surrounding Army installations, a new agency was established in the Office of The Coordinator of Health, Welfare, and Related Defense Activities, Office for Emergency Management, to implement Point Six of the Eight-Point Agreement which referred to the repression of commercialized and clandestine prostitution. This agency was the Division of Social Protection, formally established in early 1941. On 3 September 1941, the Division of\n\n163\n\nFIGURE 17.-Participants in Social Hygiene Day meeting in Boston, 1944. Left to right, Capt. Edward M.

On the later date, the functions of the Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services were transferred to the Federal Security Agency where the Office of Community War Services was established as an integral part of the Office of the Administrator. The Social Protection Division functioned within the Office of Community War Services until 30 June 1946.\n\nThe broad objectives of the Social Protection Division were the safeguarding of the Armed Forces and the civilian population from the hazards of prostitution, sex delinquency, and venereal diseases. To accomplish these objectives, the section was instructed to gather and evaluate information with respect to: Prostitution and related conditions in cities and counties adjacent to military establishments, the statutory and administrative mea-\n\n164\n\nures designed to combat such conditions, the extent to which these measures were enforced, and the results being achieved. The section was also given the mission to implement community activities directed toward the protection of women from sexual exploitation and the social rehabilitation of prostitutes and other sexually delinquent women. By September 1941, the program of this division had begun to take shape, and regional and State representatives had been assigned to the field. On 2 October 1941, the War Department advised the field of the establishment of this new agency and outlined the program of the division.\n\nNational program of the Division.-The program by which the Social Protection Division attempted to achieve these broad objectives included the promulgation of policies in cooperation with such national law-enforcement societies as the International Association of Police Chiefs and the National Sheriff's Association, the preparation and distribution of educational material, the organization of coordinating committees (The Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control and the National Advisory Venereal Disease Committee), the arranging of local public meetings, and the application in each local community of the policies and programs developed by these national deliberative committees. The field staff of the Social Protection Division, including 12 regional offices and their associated suboffices, had the responsibility of transmitting these policies to, and effecting their application in, local communities.\n\nField operations of the Division.-The translation into community action of policies and programs laid down from the Washington office of the Social Protection Division was the responsibility of field, regional, and State social protection representatives. Theirs was a complex and difficult operational assignment. It was necessary for them to coordinate their activities with the U.S. Public Health Service and the American Social Hygiene Association whose activities in the field of venereal disease control long antedated those of the Social Protection Division. In addition, they had to integrate their programs with that of the armed services whose venereal disease control officers also carried out control functions in the civilian communities surrounding Army installations. Furthermore, the already difficult functions of these field representatives was made more complex when the Social Protection Section was given the responsibility for the preparation of special reports in connection with the May Act. The conduct of investigations and the preparation of reports in conjunction with this added responsibility became largely an added function of these field representatives. It was not surprising that, in many instances, efforts of these diverse agencies conflicted instead of supporting one another.\n\nSometime after Mr. Eliot Ness became director of the Social Protection Division, a National Advisory Police Committee on Social Protection was organized as an advisory body to the division. This committee, made up of eminent police chiefs and sheriffs, made recommendations that were sent toÂ Â\n\n165\n\nevery police chief and sheriff in the country. The judiciary and the legal profession were brought into the program on a national level through the American Bar Association which appointed a National Committee on Courts and Wartime Social Protection to work with that division. This committee included many of the leading law experts in the country. It completed a study embracing recommendations for adequate health and prostitution laws which was submitted to the States and endorsed by the Council of State Governments. Mayors and city managers were reached from the national level by articles which appeared in the publications of the American Municipal Association, the National Conference of Mayors, and the Inter-National City Managers Association. The American Municipal Association made the social protection program one of the principal subjects of its annual meeting in 1942. To influence liquor vendors, the help of the American Brewing Foundation, the Distilled Spirits Institute, and State liquor control boards was enlisted.\n\nThe National Hotel Association in cooperation with the Social Protection Division set up standards for good hotel operations, and educational material incorporating these recommendations was distributed to hotels throughout the country. To counteract pimping by taxicab drivers, which had become flagrant in many communities, the Social Protection Division and the Office of Defense Transportation completed a joint agreement for the revocation of Certificates of War Necessity when voluntary cooperation could not be obtained. The National Cab Association embarked upon an educational program in which drivers' unions also participated. Activities directed toward the prevention of prostitution and the rehabilitation and redirection of prostitutes were also initiated in cooperation with committees appointed by various national social agencies such as the Conference of Women Superintendents. These and many other policymaking and coordinating activities of the Social Protection Division were energetically carried out by Mr. Ness, who, as director of public safety for Cleveland, Ohio, had already completed a successful antiprostitution and general law-enforcement program and had established working relations with many of the agencies with which he now so effectively strove to develop and promulgate overall law-enforcement policies. In these efforts, Mr. Ness repeatedly sought and received the support and advice of the Office of the Surgeon General. Most of the directives that were distributed by the Social Protection Division were coordinated with the Army before publication. Meetings arranged by the Social Protection Division almost invariably included an Army representative, and many conferences and committees convened in which both the Army and the Social Protection Division participated. Mr. Ness was succeeded, as director of the Division, in 1944 by Mr. Thomas Devine who continued the same close and cooperative relationship with the Army that had been established by Mr. Ness.Â Â\n\n166\n\nEvaluation of Division activities.-The contribution of the Social Protection Division to the venereal disease control program during World War II will long remain controversial because the methods of approach utilized by different agencies involved in the program during the war were often conflicting. There is no question that in many communities the Social Protection Division succeeded in bringing about suppression of prostitution and improvement of the overall venereal disease control program. There is also no question, however, that in many communities and in many instances the Social Protection Division field representative did not clearly understand his role in the overall program and, instead of securing coordination and improved control procedures, caused confusion and personal enmity. Many of these difficulties were due to the failure of the Division of Social Protection representative to perceive clearly the different responsibilities of the Division and the U.S. Public Health Service. In many instances, the Social Protection Division representative made public health recommendations to State and local health authorities which conflicted with previous recommendations by U.S. Public Health Service representatives. In other instances, the approach to Army officers was so belligerent that conflict and personal enmity resulted. By contrast, at the national level the Social Protection Division worked most successfully with the military services and other agencies involved in venereal disease control.\n\nInterdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control\n\nEstablishment and organization.-Publication of the book \"Plain Words About Venereal Disease\" by Parran and Vonderlehr was the impetus for the establishment of the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control. Soon after publication of the book, Mr. McNutt conferred with the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, in order to establish closer liaison between the various departments on the matter of venereal disease control. Mr. McNutt wrote to Secretary Stimson on 6 December 1941 recommending specifically that the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and the Federal Security Administrator \"* * * join quite informally as a top committee to confer perhaps once a month * * * to consider condensed overall reports from our several competent advisors * * *.\"\n\nOn 26 December 1941, Mr. McNutt again wrote to the Secretary of War recommending a program of collaboration for the Secretary of War, the Secretary of Navy, and the Federal Security Administrator in connection with venereal disease control. This program included nine points, point eight of which recommended the establishment of a committee of six composed of two representatives each from the War Department, the Navy Department, and the Federal Security Agency. Mr. McNutt also recommended that this committee consider as advisers to be frequently consulted appropriate representatives of the Department of Justice and recognized private agencies. On 6 January 1942, the Secretary of War wrote to the\n\n167\n\nFederal Security Administrator stating that the War Department was in accord with the general principles outlined in the proposed program and would cooperate in every feasible manner in the control of venereal disease in communities adjacent to military reservations. Two representatives, one from the Office of the Surgeon General and the other from the General Staff, were designated as representatives of the War Department to serve on the proposed Interdepartmental Committee. Colonel Simmons, Director, Preventive Medicine Division, was appointed representative for The Surgeon General.\n\nMeetings of the Committee.-The first meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control was held in the Office of the Surgeon General on 23 December 1941 in response to a verbal request of Mr. Charles P. Taft, Assistant Coordinator, Health, Welfare and Related Defense Activities, Office for Emergency Management. This initial meeting was attended by representatives of the Army, the Navy, the Federal Security Agency, and the U.S. Public Health Service. It was concerned primarily with the problem of venereal disease control in Panama and Cuba. The second meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control was held on Friday, 2 January 1942, in the Office of the Surgeon General. At this meeting, in addition to the Army, the Navy, and the Federal Security Agency, representatives were also present from the American Social Hygiene Association and the Panama Canal Health Department. The minutes of the second meeting recorded that discussion touching upon venereal disease control problems in many areas, including the Caribbean, resulted in no definitive action. Although liaison had now been established between the different national agencies concerned with venereal disease control, it was not yet clear at the conclusion of this second meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee exactly what its function or method of action should be.\n\nOn 22 January 1942, the third meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee was held in the Office of the Federal Security Administrator. The committee now included a representative from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A brief summary of this meeting was prepared for the Army Chief of Staff.12 The representative of the Social Protection Division reported that favorable results were being accomplished throughout the country by cooperative action between the Social Protection Division, military services, and local officials. In connection with the May Act, discussion brought out that considerable differences of opinion concerning its invocation were expressed by representatives of the Public Health Service and the American Social Hygiene Association on the one hand, and the military services and the Federal Security Agency on the other. It was the opinion of Dr. Parran of the U.S. Public Health Service and Dr. Snow of the American Social Hygiene Association that invocation of the May Act in\n\n12Memorandum, Brig. Gen. J. H. Hilldring to Chief of Staff, 26 Jan. 1942, subject : Conference, Inter-Departmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control.\n\n168\n\ncertain localities as test cases should be considered in order to impress the underworld. Representatives of the military services on the other hand opposed indiscriminate invoking of the act, holding that the bill should be invoked only when local services could not or would not satisfactorily handle the situation. The representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation informed the committee that it would be necessary that the Bureau be given advance notice of approximately 14 weeks in order that competent personnel could be trained to administer the act.\n\nOn 7 February 1942, Colonel Turner, chief of the Subdivision of Venereal Disease, was appointed a member of the Interdepartmental Committee to replace Colonel Simmons. The committee met again on 18 March 1942. The major portion of the agenda concerned problems of venereal disease and prostitution in Puerto Rico. After consideration of a report from Mr. Taft, the committee drafted a resolution condemning the attempt of the Caribbean authorities to regulate prostitution and transmitted the resolution on 18 March to the department surgeon. On 2 June 1942, another meeting was held at which subjects of general interest were considered, but no important action was taken. The initial results of the invocation of the May Act in the Tennessee area were discussed and it was noted that, although a good deal of publicity had occurred locally, very little note was taken of the invocation in other parts of the country. At this meeting, the Social Protection Division representative suggested that, in order to achieve better cooperation from State and local police authorities, it might be advisable to call a meeting of representatives of police chiefs in Washington. This recommendation was approved and such a meeting was later convened.\n\nOn 26 August 1942, Major Brumfield, The Surgeon General's representative to the committee, wrote a memorandum to Colonel Turner, chief of the Venereal Disease Control Branch, in which he stated: \"The programs for venereal disease control in areas adjacent to military establishments are suffering because of lack of understanding between the local representatives of the agencies concerned. The principal offenders are the field representatives of the Social Protection Section who apparently do not understand exactly where they fit into the picture.\" This conflict existed principally between the Social Protection Division representatives and those of the Public Health Service. In order to clarify the situation, Major Brumfield had discussed the objectives of the nationwide program with the Assistant Surgeon General, Venereal Disease Division, U.S. Public Health Service; the director of the Social Protection Section; the executive director of the American Social Hygiene Association; and the Surgeon General of the Navy. At their suggestion, he had prepared an outline of the duties and responsibilities of the various groups which he now submitted with the memorandum. In a letter to Mr. Taft on 8 September 1942, Major Brumfield suggested that the outline be submitted to the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control for consideration at its next meeting. At the 18\n\n169\n\nSeptember 1942 meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee, this draft was favorably considered and the committee recommended its issue as soon as possible to all staff members of the agencies concerned so that each agency would be better informed of its functions in relation to the other agencies. On 12 October 1942, the statement entitled \"Relationships of the Army, Navy, United States Public Health Service, Social Protection Section, and the American Social Hygiene Association in Venereal Disease Control\" was submitted by Mr. Taft to The Surgeon General for his comment and indorsement. On 2 November 1942, The Surgeon General acknowledged receipt of this statement and concurred in its publication. It was officially released for publication on 15 January 1943 by the Office of Defense Health and Welfare Services, Office for Emergency Management.\n\nAt the meeting of 18 September 1942, several other subjects received considerable study. The Federal Bureau of Investigation representative reported on the progress of the May Act in the Camp Forrest area. He reported indications that an attempt would be made by local individuals to contest the constitutionality of the act, but that it was expected that this challenge would be successfully met. The question of the use of Civilian Conservation Corps camps as venereal disease hospitals was also discussed, and consideration was also given to the request submitted by the Anglo-American Caribbean Commission for the assignment of a U.S. Public Health Service officer to this area.\n\nAt the next meeting of the Interdepartmental Committee on 17 November 1942, the venereal disease problem in the Caribbean and the operation of the May Act continued to command the attention of the committee. As a result of the discussion at this meeting regarding the venereal disease problem in the Caribbean, the chief of the Venereal Disease Control Division, Office of the Surgeon General, took action to strengthen the Army venereal disease control program in this area by securing and assigning Maj. (later Col.) Daniel Bergsma, MC, an officer specially trained in venereal disease control, to that command.\n\nGeneral satisfaction was expressed in connection with the operation of the May Act. It was the opinion of those present that the operation of the act had been effective in the two areas in which it was invoked but that the mechanism of invoking the act through War Department Circular No. 170, 16 August 1941, was cumbersome. The changes effected as a result of this observation were discussed elsewhere (p. 174).\n\nIn late 1943, some members of the Interdepartmental Committee were apparently convinced that further meetings would not result in sufficiently useful action to warrant them. For example, Dr. Snow, Chairman, Executive Committee, American Social Hygiene Association, wrote to Colonel Turner on 3 December 1943 saying, \"* * * it [the committee] ought to be more active and useful or else some other device should be tried for accomplishing theÂ Â\n\n170\n\nfullest measure of cooperation and exchange of current views between governmental and voluntary agencies * * *.\"\n\nDuring 1944, the committee was inactive. In 1945, a meeting was convened at the request of the Social Protection Division on 12 September. Particular attention was paid by the conferees to the rising Army venereal disease rates and to the question of continuing the May Act. The minutes of the Committee meeting of 30 November 1945 stated that when Commander Ferree, the Navy representative raised the question of the importance of continuing the Interdepartmental Committee, it was the unanimous opinion of all those present that the committee should not only be continued, but that it should be an active functioning organization. At this meeting, the functions and responsibilities of the committee were restated; Mr. Watson B. Miller, Federal Security Administrator, was elected to serve as chairman; and the committee continued to function during the immediate postwar period.\n\nMiscellaneous Agencies\n\nThe high proportion of venereal diseases acquired by military personnel in bars and taverns led the War Department to enlist the cooperation of the Brewing Industry Foundation and other liquor industries (fig. 18). War Department Memorandum No. W850-35-43, dated 18 July 1943, referred to the desire of the Brewing Industry Foundation, New York, N.Y., to assist the Armed Forces in maintaining satisfactory conditions in and around retail beer establishments near military posts. The memorandum authorized commanding officers to solicit the assistance of this foundation. On 30 August 1943, War Department Memorandum No. W850-43-43 further defined the nature of the assistance available from the Allied Liquor Industries, Inc., New York, N.Y., the Distilled Spirits Institute, Inc., National Press Building, Washington, D.C., and the Conference of Alcoholic Beverage Industries, New York, N.Y.\n\nNumerous other organizations were at one time or another cooperating with the Office of the Surgeon General in its venereal disease control program. Among these were church organizations, State and local health departments (fig. 19), officials of States and cities, Negro organizations, the National Federation of Women's Clubs, and other groups. In addition, the Venereal Disease Control Division carried on an extensive correspondence with civilian doctors, nurses, and nonprofessional people regarding problems of venereal disease treatment and control.\n\nOne of the chief activities of the Venereal Disease Control Division of the Office of the Surgeon General during World War II was the civilian collaboration program. Because of the fact that the venereal diseases, unlike most other communicable diseases, were acquired by military personnel from civilian sources outside military jurisdiction, it was necessary to depend upon civilian agencies to a much greater degree than was true in other\n\n171\n\nFIGURE 18.-Bars and taverns played a part in the spread of venereal disease. An investigator of the Chicago Health Department checks, with a Chicago bartender, information supplied in a contact report.\n\nMedical Department programs. In this program of collaboration with the military services, the Social Protection Division of the Office for Emergency Management (later, of the Federal Security Agency), the U.S. Public Health Service, and the American Social Hygiene Association played the most important roles. By February 1943 it was possible to say: \"* * * the past year was a period during which collaboration between military and civil authorities reached a highly effective level. Venereal disease control officers of the Army were in almost daily contact with officers of the United States Public Health Service, with State and local health department officials, and with representatives of other civilian agencies.\"13 Without these joint efforts the success achieved during World War II in the control of venereal disease among military personnel would never have been possible.\n\n13Turner, T.

The Chicago Health Department enters a float urging the fight against venereal disease in the annual Chicago Defender parade, 1943.\n\nSPECIAL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES\n\nControl of Prostitution\n\nDefinitive action to eradicate commercialized prostitution was the responsibility of civilian law-enforcement agencies, but the degree to which these agencies carried out the provisions of the law depended very often upon the sincerity and persistence with which local commanding officers supported repressive measures. For this reason, the War Department issued a series of directives clearly stating its position with respect to prostitution and designed to impress upon line and medical officers the need for repression. The perennial struggle between those who advocated segregated areas of prostitution rather than suppression of prostitution as a venereal disease control measure was not eliminated by the many directives published by the War Department. In July 1943, it was still evident that at least a few commanding officers disagreed with the established policy of the War Depart-\n\n173\n\nment. For this reason, another directive reiterating War Department policy was published in July 1943.14\n\nEnlistment of support of State governors and industry.-To secure full support of the Army's control efforts, the Secretary of War, in March 1942, addressed letters to the governors of all States calling their attention to the danger which prostitution and venereal disease presented to the war effort unless prompt and effective suppressive measures were enforced. He asked the governors to assume responsibility for stimulating State and local law-enforcement agencies in carrying out the venereal disease control program and for the initiation of a program of public education. On 25 May 1942 , the President sent a letter to Mr. McNutt commending the Interdepartmental Committee on Venereal Disease Control for its efforts and referring to the need for continued venereal disease control measures. This letter was transmitted by Mr. McNutt to some 8,500 key executives of war production plants. He called for their active encouragement of physical and moral fitness and referred specifically to the Eight-Point Agreement and to the need for the cooperation of these plants in repressing prostitution and controlling venereal disease locally.\n\nProstitution overseas.-The problem of prostitution in oversea theaters is discussed separately in the individual oversea theater reports. It is of interest to note at this point, however, that in 1945 evidence was becoming increasingly available that prostitution not only existed but in some oversea areas was being actively supported by U.S. Army commanding officers. On the basis of a report submitted by Dr. Joseph E. Moore, a letter from The Adjutant General to all oversea theaters was dispatched on 24 April 1945 . This letter called the attention of commanding generals of oversea theaters to War Department policy with respect to the suppression of prostitution and strongly urged that measures effective in the continental United States also be applied in oversea commands. Use of off-limits authority when cooperation of civilian law-enforcement agencies could not be obtained was directed.\n\nResults of antiprostitution program.-The results of the wartime anti-prostitution program-a program which, it should be emphasized, was a joint enterprise entered into by many agencies of which the military services constituted only one-were evident in practically every city and community throughout the Nation. In over 600 cities and towns, segregated areas of prostitution activities were eliminated. In other communities, efforts to initiate newÂ prostitution undertakings were frustrated by aroused and public spirited local citizens.\n\nEvaluation of antiprostitution program.-Certain lessons were learned\n\n14Letter, The Adjutant General to Commanding Generals, Army Ground Forces, Army Air Forces, Army Service Force; Commanding Generals, Defense Commands, Service Commands, Military District of Washington, Ports of Embarkation; Commanding Officers, Posts, Camps, and Stations, including exempted Stations, 31 July 1943, subject: Improvement of Moral Conditions in the Vicinity of Camps and Stations.Â\n\n174\n\nin the Army's wartime program that should be useful in any future repression program. It was early observed that the mere arresting of girls who were fined or even convicted of prostitution was inadequate to eliminate clandestine or commercialized prostitution. It was only when cities and communities emphasized the role of middlemen-facilitators, bellhops, cab drivers, and other individuals who procured customers for prostitutes-that any repression program could succeed. In addition, many communities which wished to cooperate with the Army and other agencies were handicapped by the lack of detention facilities. It was only after the provision in 1943 and 1944 of treatment centers and, in some insta"
