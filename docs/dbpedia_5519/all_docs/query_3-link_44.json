        "text": "Our Mission\n\nOur Lady of Good Counsel is a Christ-centered Parish enlightened by the Holy Spirit; guided by the Scriptures, Tradition, and the Sacraments of the Holy Roman Catholic Church; through the Stewardship of Time, Talent and Treasure, seeking to renew and maintain Love, Family Unity and Christian Values throughout the Community.\n\nA Brief History of Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish\n\nIn 1958, Our Lady of Good Counsel was established as the 27th parish in the Diocese of Honolulu. The Church and rectory were blessed in 1959 and the school was opened in 1964 with 160 students. The Sisters of the third Order of St. Francis of Syracuse, New York were the first instructors. Monsignor Francis Marzen, the first pastor, was succeeded by Monsignor Bernard Eikmeier and followed by Monsignor Alan Nagai, Reverend Francis Peterson, Monsignor Alen Nagai (second term), Reverends Michael Owens and Daniel McNichol and Reverend Jack Niland, OFM Cap., Reverend Father Pascual Abaya IV and the current Pastor, Reverend Khanh Hoang. The parish is also blessed with the ordination of Deacon Thomas Miyashiro in 1981 and Deacon Efrain Andrews in 2001.\n\nThe stewardship concept of \"Time, Talent and Treasure\" was introduced in 1978. As a consequence, the parish became debt free in 1989 and many ministries surfaced as parishioners became more actively involved in parish life. The included Outreach, parish renewal, Baptism preparation, Marriages Convalidation, Stephen Ministry, Charismatic Prayer Group, Missionary Basic Christian Community, Seniors Club. parish picnics and appreciation breakfasts, fellowship weekends, and parish workdays afforded many to shear their time and talents.\n\nMore changes were seen in 1984 when, in keeping with the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, renovation of the church into a circular configuration occurred. Then in 1988 a diocesan mandate recommended the establishing of the Parish Pastoral Council and the forming of a Parish Mission Statement. From 1995-97 RENEW was one of the sources of parish spiritual development. The legion of Mary, St. Vincent DePaul Society, Neo-Catechumenal Way, Parish Advisory Council and Family Ministry were formed in 1997-98. The Perpetual Adoration Chapel was blessed in October 1998 and continues as a source of prayerful sustenance to many in and around the parish. the Samoan and Micronesian communities are also actively participating in parish life.\n\nThe Welcoming Parish Study/Process, a diocesan mandate, began in 1999 with a parish survey to identify the needs and recommendations towards improving the parish. As a result of the study, the lighting and sound system, floor, and painting of the interior of the church were done and a pictorial parish directory and the registration/offertory envelope system were updated in 2002. The survey also strongly recommended building improvements. Therefore, The Parish Center Building Committee was formed in the fall of 2002. Currently plans are underway for the construction of a new sacristy, restrooms, storage areas, a multi-purpose structure, meeting rooms, and ad administration building.\n\nGuided by the good counsel of Our Lady, the parish continues to be empowered by the Holy Spirit and grows as a family of loving and caring people of God. We are confident that God will provide for all of our needs at His \"Table of Plenty.\"\n\nHawaii Catholic Cemeteries\n\nOur Lady of Good Counsel Parish\n\nIt is our pleasure to faithfully report that our new Columbaria has been built and niches installed. Niches are now being purchased or reserved for our community member’s final resting place. In preparation for our upcoming Memorial Day Mass, we invite you to consider referring names to be included on our beautiful new \"Cenotaph.\"\n\nWhat is the Right Thing for You?\n\nEach of us must sooner or later prepare for our own end of life journey. Planning your own memorial and funeral, benefits your family, and the community we are part of. Talking about and exploring your personal preferences; having open, honest, family discussions, provides you the time to think through how best to manage your final wishes. It is certainly one of the most loving and significant determinations you can make for yourself, your family, and our Catholic Community at Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish.\n\nTalking about my Funeral?\n\nIf we talk about it at all, we may use words such as “I want to be buried” or “I want to be cremated.“ Then, when death occurs, our family is left to guess, make decisions, and worst face costs, at a time of great personal stress and grief. Your family could be forced to debate what they think you would have chosen for your Catholic funeral arrangements and memorial at Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish – if only you were still around to ask.\n\nRemembering Others?\n\nWe often do not remember the names and faces of those who built Our Lady of Good Counsel Parishor who were Veterans from our community – can you help us remember and honor them at our upcoming Memorial Day Mass?\n\nWhat do I need to do?\n\nYou can pre-plan your funeral and memorial, and also help us remember friends of Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish and family not yet memorialized. Recognizing the importance of making your own plans, and taking an active role, is the first step.\n\nWhen you feel ready, we ask that you contact and meet with our new Director of Hawaii Catholic Cemeteries, Mr. Duane Pavao.\n\nDuane can be reached at 808-783-6778, or [email protected]\n\nREV. FR. SANTHOSH THOTTANKARA, SS.CC\n\nPastor\n\nI ’m Fr. Santhosh OusephThottankara from Cheranaloor, Kerala India. I completed Philosophy at Christ the King Seminary and Theology in Maryhill School of Theology in Manila, Philippines and Masters in Counseling at De La Salle University Taft, Philippines. I made my first profession as a religious of the Sacred Hearts (SS.CC) on 04/23/1997and was ordained a priest on April 2, 2005. I was a formator for more than 13 years in the Philippines and in India; coordinator for the Conference of Asia and Polynesia for 3 years; and was in the regional government of India for 6 years. I was also a chaplain at the Medical City Hospital in Pasay, Philippines. I am now the coordinator for ongoing formation in the United States province and vocation promoter for Hawaii. I was the associate pastor at St. Patrick Church in Kaimuki. My vocation is a calling from God with a miracle of second chance to life. As a young boy, I wanted to be a lawyer since I was good at arguing and was very naughty with more time to play and less time for family chores. My mother used to always remind me that I should be a good boy since I was born on December 3rd, the feast day of St. Francis Xavier. One afternoon after playing cricket with my friends I got into a bus to pay the neighbors’ electric bills at the electric office in town. While trying to get off the bus which stopped very briefly for me, I fell from the bus when it suddenly took off without making a full stop. I fell from the bus and hit my head on the rocks used for road repair and became unconscious. I didn’t remember anything after. Later I learned that people gathered in the streets rushed me to the nearby hospital and from there transferred me to a specialty hospital for head injuries. The doctors performed surgery on my brain to remove the blood clots without assurance I would make it. The church bell rang in my home parish announcing my death but after 5 days of coma I came out of it unexpectedly. When I came out of coma I remembered my mother’s words that I should be like St. Francis Xavier who was a good boy. This made me realize that God saved me for His service. I then decided to join the seminary to become a priest. When I finished high school I joined the Sacred Hearts (SS.CC) formation. My favorite quote is “Yet I live, no longer I, but Christ lives in me” (Gal 2:20)."
