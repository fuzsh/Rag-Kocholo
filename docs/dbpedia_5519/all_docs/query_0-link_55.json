On May 27, 2020, he died at age 81 at home in Green Valley, AZ, of cancer.\n\nMichael grew up as a beach kid in Manhattan Beach, CA. He learned to swim early and swam in the ocean throughout his life even during the winter months. His family also lived briefly in the San Francisco Bay area and in the Chicago suburbs. He graduated in 1956 from Arcadia High School, Arcadia, CA., where he was a member of the track team. Michael loved to run and he\n\ncontinued this activity into his early 70âs.\n\nMichaelâs father wanted him to get a job right out of high school, but Michael wanted to continue\n\nhis education. Thanks to the encouragement of a neighbor, he applied and was accepted to UC\n\nSanta Barbara. In 1960 he received his B.A. in History and went on to get his M.A. at UCSB in\n\nthe History of the High Middle Ages. He then was accepted for the Phd program at Berkeley\n\nwhere he was awarded a doctorate degree in American Colonial History with his Dissertation on\n\nSlave Resistance.\n\nHis teaching career, spanning 39 years, included the City College of San Francisco, Smith\n\nCollege, University of Hull in East Yorkshire, England, Nottingham College in the UK and then\n\nSAC State from 1971 until 1995. Most of his teaching revolved around Colonial America. With\n\nthe encouragement of one of his professors at Berkeley, he took his dissertation material and\n\nwrote his first book: âFlight and Rebellion: Slave Resistance in 18th C Virginia, published by\n\nOxford University Press. (The book was nominated for a Pulitzer in 1972).\n\nIn 1975 Harper & Row published his âDocumentary History of American Negro Slavery.â In 1992\n\nthe University of Illinois Press published âAfrica in America: Slave Acculturation and Resistance\n\nin the American South and the British Caribbean 1736-1831.â\n\nJust before he passed, Michael completed a draft of a new book, âVoices of the Underdog and\n\nother Stories of People of Color Fighting Back Against Racismâ using the power of art and\n\ndance.\n\nMichael was a life-long learner. Curious about everything, he read voraciously, not only books in\n\nhis field of academic study but on a wide range of topics. As an intrepid explorer, you could find\n\nhim constantly traveling to Asia, the Americas, Europe and Australia. He haunted museums,\n\ntaking copious notes of each painting or sculpture. Later in life he also developed an interest in\n\nBuddhist meditation and taught yoga to seniors for the last five years.\n\nHe was born a lover of the sea and of the desert. His love of the desert began as a boy with\n\nchildhood asthma who was sent off to the California high desert for holidays to clear his lungs.\n\nHe would hike for hours even in the heat, exploring the terrain, reveling in its stark beauty and\n\nsilence. This love of the desert led him, after retirement, to volunteer at such National Parks as\n\nBandelier in New Mexico and Arches in Utah. Chaco Canyon, also in New Mexico, was his\n\nfavorite. He volunteered as a campground host there for 17 years and thatâs where he met his domestic partner, Naneki Elliott, in 2005. They continued to volunteer at Arches and at Chaco together for several years.\n\nMichael began his academic career in Santa Barbara and thatâs where he and Naneki ended up residing for 11 years until one year ago when they moved to Green Valley. In the 15 years they were blessed to have together, they ventured out on 21 major trips ranging from the northwest to the southwest to the northeast of the U.S. and across Canada, Europe and Australia by RV, car, trains, planes and buses.\n\nMichael has been blessed with five children: Mike Mullin of Bend, OR; Jeannine Mullin of Woodland, CA; Sarah Mullin of Chico, CA; Matt Mullin of Davis, CA and Megan Damon of Lakewood, WA. He has ten grand-children.\n\nMany thanks to Arista Hospice for helping Michael during his final passage. Donations in honor of Michael can by made to his choice of Doctors Without Borders. Since his wish was to have his ashes scattered off the California coast in Santa Cruz, there will be a seaside ceremony there when the time is right.\n\nI want to thank all of his friends and family for loving Michael for the true Renaissance man that he was. As one dear friend said, âI want you to leave me your hair and your brains.â He has left us with the memory of those things and more: his generosity of spirit, his amazing aesthetic sense, his humor, his wisdom, his love for his family and friends, his love of the natural world, his embracing life to the fullest and, at the end, ever the teacher, his showing us how to embrace death with dignity and grace.\n\nJames L. Long\n\nDecember 7, 1937 ~ June 30, 2020\n\nThe Honorable Judge James L. Long, known by everyone as \"Jimmy\" once said, \"I hope to be remembered as a person who did more right than wrong, and who did more good than bad.\" True to his words he earned a reputation as a respected leader, fair under the law, on both sides, a mentor, a colleague, and the epitome of a true friend. James was born on December 7, 1937, in Wintergarden, Florida, to Susie Ward and James Joshua Long. As a youth his family moved to Sacramento, CA and settled in the Oak Park area. The second of three children, he is survived by his sister, June LaVerne Long, Esq. (Ret.); and was predeceased by his parents, and sibling Elton Ward Long. He attended Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento, CA, and graduated in 1955.\n\nHe attended Sacramento City College and not only did he dream of becoming a baseball player, but according to lifetime friend Attorney William Barnaby, \"When we were nine years old, Jim had a difficult time hitting that curve ball.\" Jimmy agreed and when approached by a Major League Baseball scout he still had that problem and thought law school was a better option. He enlisted into the United States Army Reserve Corps in 1961 and served for 8 years at the rank of Second Lieutenant. After an honorable discharge he enrolled at San Jose State University and later attended Howard University Law School. He received his Juris Doctorate degree in1967 and was admitted to practice in the state of California in January of 1970.Â\n\nWhile in Washington, D.C. \"Jimmy\" worked for a research assistant for a constitutional lawyer, Herbert O. Reid, Sr., whose landmark case desegregated schools in the D.C. area; also working for professor Jeanus B. Parks, Jr. L.L.M. After graduation from law school, \"Jimmy\" worked for the Legal Aid Society of Sacramento and for the California State Legislative Counsel Bureau. He also served as an assistant professor in the Department of Criminal Justice at California State University, Sacramento. He went on to serve as a special legal counsel for the (NAACP) Western Region. Prior to being appointed to the bench by former Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. on February 1, 1982, \"Jimmy\" opened a law office in his Oak Park neighborhood on Broadway.Â\n\nAs a private practitioner, among his various clients were the Black Panthers and the exoneration of the high-profile case; (The Oak Park Four), earning him the title of the People's Lawyer. He was sworn-in as a judicial officer of the Sacramento County, Superior Court on February 24, 1982, where he served until his retirement in March 2011. He presided over many complex criminal and civil trials, including several death penalty cases, which prompted him to once say, \"Only God should judge between life and death.\"Â\n\nOn December 15, 2005 \"Jimmy\" was initiated into the Roseville (California) Chapter of the Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, an organization that prides itself on giving back to the community; and one he was proud to be a member of. He was also an award recipient and member of the Wiley W. Manuel bar association, (formerly the Sacramento Association of Black Attorneys (SABA)) , an organization whose mission is to promote the administration of justice; and to make use of legal tools and Legal discipline for the advancement of the economic, political, educational, and social interest of Sacramento, especially the Black community.\n\nÂ Jimmy was a co-author for a book entitled American Minorities: The Justice Issue. He faithfully served the people of Sacramento County and the state of California for almost 30 years; earning numerous awards, including Judge of the Year in 1998, 2001, and 2007. He was a mentor and counselor to all who sought his advice; and he guided many aspiring \"to be\" judges to successful judicial appointments.Â\n\nAlthough he was stern in his courtroom, he was a gentle, caring, and loving person. He was a father figure to many and a friend to many more. He will be remembered for his ferocious laugh and his infectious smile. Jimmy flew against the wind, knocking down barriers and obstacles and accomplishing what many could only dream about.

Henry\n\n1943 ~ September 26, 2020\n\nDr. John F. Henry, 77, died September 26, 2020, at his home in Kansas City, MO. He was professor of economics at California State University Sacramento from 1970 through 2003. Dr. Henry was the son of Forrest J. and Beulah R. Henry (nÃ©e Richard) of Red Hill, PA. He attended Upper Perkiomen High School and graduated from Muhlenberg College in 1965. He subsequently attended McGill University, Montreal, receiving his M.A. in 1967 and his Ph.D. in 1974. After retiring from CSUS, he taught at the University of Missouri Kansas City until 2014 and finished his academic life as senior scholar at the Levy Economics Institute, Bard College, New York.\n\nDr. Henry made contributions to heterodox economics, particularly in the fields of history of economic thought, economic history, and political economy. He is the author of two books, John Bates Clark (Macmillan, 1995) and The Making of Neoclassical Economics (Unwin Hyman, 1990; reprinted by Routledge, 2011). He published over 50 journal articles and book reviews in Journal of Economic Issues, Journal of the History of Economic Thought, History of Political Economy, Forum for Social Economics, Review of Social Economy, Review of Political Economy, Journal of Post Keynesian Economics, History of Economics Review, and Studi e Note di Economia. He also contributed articles to ten books of collected essays. The CSUS School of Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Studies awarded Dr. Henry the Outstanding Teacher Award in 1998 and the Outstanding Service Award in 2003.Â\n\nIn 2001 he was selected by the university to deliver the John C. Livingston Annual Faculty Lecture, the highest honor bestowed by the faculty of that institution. He was the recipient of the 2016 Veblen-Commons Award from the Association for Evolutionary Economics. A festschrift in Dr. Henry's honor, Marx, Veblen, and the Foundations of Heterodox Economics: Essays in Honor of John F. Henry, was published in 2015 (Tae-Hee Jo and Frederic S. Lee editors; Routledge). Dr. Henry served various economics associations for many years, including as president of the Association for Institutional Thought, member of the Steering Committee of the International Confederation of Association for Pluralism in Economics, and member of the editorial boards of Forum for Social Economics and Journal of Economic Issues. More important than his published work was his role as educator. His main objective in his teaching career was to help liberate the minds of students from the shackles of conventional thought.\n\nDr. Henry was diagnosed with leukemia in 2012 and was informed in early September 2020 that it had transformed into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. He elected to forego chemotherapy and to spend his remaining time at home under hospice care. Dr. Henry was married to Charlene Heinen, originally of Loose Creek, MO, for 41 years. He has two daughters, Jennifer Woods (Tom) and Leith Henry, both of Sacramento, CA, from a previous marriage to Barbara Henry (nÃ©e Brode), originally of Sumneytown, PA. Predeceasing Dr. Henry were his parents and two sisters, Mary Jane Maley and Georgianna Kressly. Commemorative donations may be made to the Frederic S. Lee Heterodox Economics Scholarship Fund, in care of the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation, Kansas City, MO.\n\nTribute: Remembering Professor John F. Henry, by Bob Curry\n\nOn the evening of Saturday, September 26th, John Henry passed away peacefully while his wife Charlene Heinen and his children were in his company. What to say about John Henry? Simply and accurately put, he was one of the very best things ever to happen to the CSUS economics department. Beyond Johnâs home department, his contributions to the universityâ students and academic faculty deserve not to be forgotten.\n\nWhen I met him I suspected that something of great value could happen if he chose to teach at CSUS. He and I met at a meeting of the American Economic Association: it was my first recruiting assignment and it was his first job-seeking effort. John recently had completed his Ph.D. work at McGill University. Our recruitment procedure went by no âbook.â It took place at an evening meeting over a bottle of scotch. Neither of us was much of a drinker so after a reasonably late night of talk and too much of the scotch, we called it quits and turned in. The next morning I could remember only his first name, but that was all. I had no way of contacting him but he solved the problemâhe walked off with my CSUS catalogue. The following morning he had no idea who I was and where I was from. But the stolen catalogue saved the day and it led to something of great value for the department and the university.\n\nOrdinarily I try to avoid superlatives but in Johnâs case thatâs an impossible task. Both his scholarship and his contribution to teaching and learning were superlative at CSUS (1970-2004) and at the University of Missouri at Kansas City where he taught from 2004 to 2014. Johnâs research focused on the history of economic thought, post Keynesian economics, economic history, heterodox economics and political economy. He authored two books, one published by Routledge the other by MacMillan. Over the years he authored 50 academic articles published in various refereed journals. His scholarly contributions earned him several awards including the highly respected Veblen-Commons Award that was bestowed on him in 2016. His publications were truly impressive, often ground breaking and never trivial.\n\nCloser to home, his teaching was extraordinary and it earned him a Teaching Award in 1998 and an Outstanding Service Award in 2003. Later he delivered the John C. Livingston Annual Faculty Lecture. His main aim in the classroom was âto liberate students from the shackles of conventional thought.â He was able to motivate a number of very solid students and nurture them through their undergraduate programs which served to send them on their way to graduate schools and then to first-rate academic careers.\n\nJohn was a contributor to the department including as vice chair. The day to day running of a department was not his favorite âthing to doâ but he did it for nine years during the time that Peter Lund and I chaired economics. Peter also joined our faculty in 1970 and the three of us began a friendship that lasted for 50 years. Both Peter and I will miss him. As chairs, we recognized how generous he was with his time, how open his office hours were to students and how genuinely nice he was to people!\n\nIn addition to helping out with departmental details, John made a number of memorable things happen. One occurred during a conversation he and I had about our colleague John Ranlett. We both held Ranlett in very high esteem and Henry suggested that the department ought to recognize what Ranlett meant to it over the decades. Our conversation led to the creation of the John Ranlett Lecture series which continues to feature a visiting scholar each academic spring.\n\nAnyone interested in knowing more about Johnâs academic contributions might want to call up his name on Google, a convenient way to know more about him. Itâs impossible for me to cover everything and itâs very difficult for me to end writing about my friend and colleague John Henry. But I must stop somewhere and it might as well be here.\n\nWilliam Joseph Moriarity\n\nNovember 21, 1941 ~ September 28, 2020\n\nBill was born on November 29, 1941 and died on September 28, 2020 of pancreatic cancer. He is survived by his beloved wife of 58 years, Elizabeth (Niklas) Moriarity, and his cherished son, William Colin Moriarity.Â Also left behind are Bill's and Elizabeth's loved and loving adopted Shepherd family: David and Patty and their children, Jill Doyle, Leah Smith and Jeremy Shepherd. Bill retired from California State University, Sacramento after teaching English there for nearly 25 years. At Bill's request, he will be cremated, and there will be no service or memorial.\n\nMildred Kahane\n\nAugust 2, 1927 ~ September 13, 2020\n\nMildred, known to her friends and family as Millie, was born in Tarrytown, N.Y. on August 2, 1927 to Harold and Ida Loughlin. She had two brothers and one sister. Millie made an early decision to pursue a career and become the first of her family to go to college. Although she started out with humble beginnings, Millie became a very successful woman. Mildred Loughlin Kahane has been a trailblazer since the time she set foot on the campus of Adelphi University in Long Island, where she graduated with a B.S. in nursing in 1949, thanks to receiving the Peggy Ann Burleigh scholarship that allowed her to finish her degree. This single event guided her life-long interest in supporting education and scholarships.\n\nShe had an early passion for nursing and especially public health. She was described as one of the most successful, impactful and influential alumni in the history of that University and was a long-term member of their advisory board. She also did graduate work at Columbia University.\n\nAfter graduation from Adelphi, the next 8 years were spent at the Meadowbrook County Hospital in New York, gaining hands-on experience in bedside care. This was at war's end when there was practically no nursing care outside of hospitals.\n\nMildred met Dr. Albert (Al) J. Kahane in 1956 at Meadowbrook Hospital, where Dr. Kahane was doing his internship. On Sept. 4, 1960, after his residency, they were married. Their next stop was, compliments of the Air Force, Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage, Alaska. She expanded her nursing skills at the local hospital. Because of her public health interest, she became Anchorage's first school nurse. Her work earned her the position of the first Executive Officer of the newly created Alaska Board of Nursing when Alaska became the 49th state. She was also involved in opening a new hospital where she served as Director of Nursing.\n\nAfter their return from Alaska, in 1964, they moved to Fairfield where she commuted to UCSF, and in 1965 earned her Master's degree and Certificate in Public Health. Later that year she and Dr Kahane moved to Sacramento, where he became part of the first group of physicians to open the Kaiser facility there. She became an assistant professor of nursing at Sacramento State College, where she also began Public Health Nursing, and was appointed to the California Board of Registered Nursing by Governor Ronald Reagan, serving one year as president. She also worked with Congressman Robert Matsui in the field of hospice care. Having a connection with the Kaiser Permanente facility in Sacramento, and in conjunction with Dr. John Mott, the Physician in Chief, she pursued the development of a Nurse Practitioner program in collaboration with the University of California, Davis.\n\nThe destiny of nurses, she believed, was to rise above the traditional hospital bedside role and to take on more responsibility in an outpatient setting. She believed that her students could learn new skills that could eventually be included in a bachelor-of- science nursing program, and that those advanced nursing capabilities would provide the core content upon which to build clinical specialties.\n\nSome of Millie Kahane's students became \"nurse practitioners\", a title unheard of at the time in Sacramento County, and, in the 1970's, Kaiser Permanente members would get comprehensive evaluations in what became known as the Department of Preventive Medicine and the Health Appraisal clinic.\n\nIn 1984 Millie and Al moved to Oakland so Dr. Kahane could assume the position of Associate Executive Director of the Permanente Medical Group. Millie joined Kaiser's regional Oakland office as consultant in the department of accreditation and regulations and liaison to the hospital nursing administrators and hospice and home health agencies. Several years later they moved to Alameda, and in 2009 to Cameron Park. They returned to Sacramento in 2013 where they lived at Eskaton Village. Millie and Al established the Rocklin branch of the Bach to Rock music school in July 2016. Al, her loving husband, passed away in 2017.\n\nMillie was a very generous financial supporter of her alma-mater, Adelphi University, and her generosity there will benefit generations of students to come. Her financial support was not limited to her alma mater. She saw the need to expand the Sierra Sacramento Valley Medical Society's Museum of Medical History and made a generous donation enabling the doubling of the size of the museum. Prior to her death, she initiated funding for the Sierra Sacramento Valley Medical Society's End of Life Program, a concept she was very excited about.\n\nBetween all her academic projects, she and Al traveled all over the worldâ¦ Italy, cruised the Nordic States, took safaris in Africa, and Millie even road tripped with fellow nurses across the US and Mexico. She said \"Discipline yourself to travel, see the worldâ¦ Don't let goals get lost.\" She and Al were also avid bridge players, play goers and snow skiers. Millie was a proud member of the 70+ ski club and was a member of the Ski Patrol. They also enjoyed ballroom dancing. She felt that many of her accomplishments were \"a matter of opportunities, being at the right place at the right time, and learning to take risks in life.\" It was likely that such an attitude was responsible for her being featured in the Who's Who of American Women, 1974-1975 edition.\n\nMillie died at home on September 13, 2020. She became a legend in her own lifetime. She left this world on her own terms, in her own homeâwhich is exactly what she wanted.\n\nOn a paper, in Millie's handwriting, was what Millie said at her own mother's graveside. With a very few revisions to apply to Millie it reads: A vital, unique, very proud and fiercely independent lady with a tough exterior which concealed, albeit poorly, a great sensitivity, love and consideration for and of others. A devoted wife of 56+ years. A real lover of LIFE. She cared. She brought cheer and encouragement to others without asking or even accepting anything in return.\n\nShe is survived by her sister-in-law Jacqueline, and two stepchildren and a multitude of good friends.\n\nShe was interred at a private graveside service at East Lawn Sierra Hills Memorial Park.\n\nIn her remembrance, donations may be made in her name to the following organizations.\n\n1)The UC Davis Foundation for the Betty Irene Moore School of Nursingâ for the Mildred \"Millie\" D. and Albert \"Al\" J.

He attended school in Germany, Japan, as well as in many states in the U.S. He ultimately graduated from Armijo High School in Fairfield, CA. Ed then attended Sacramento State University, where he earned both his Bachelor of Science Degree and Masters Degree in Business Administration. He was a proud member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon Fraternity and worked numerous jobs during college to pay his way through.\n\nEdward began his long relationship with Sacramento State University in 1964, when he worked on campus as the assistant to the Business Manager for 10 years. In 1974, he moved to Humboldt State University where he held the position of Vice President for Business Affairs. He returned to Sacramento State in 1992 as Director of the CSUS Foundation. In 2000, he took the position of Vice President for Business Affairs. He held this position until he retired in 2004.\n\nEdward met his wife, Yvonne Gallardo while working at Haleâs Department Store. They were married on June 22, 1963. Ed and Yvonne had three daughters, Michelle, Angela, and Annette. Ed and Yvonne have 5 grandchildren- Madeline, Andrew, Elizabeth, Grace, and Nathan. Ed is survived by 2 of his 3 brothers, Amil Del Biaggio and Charlie Del Biaggio.\n\nEdward was very much a family man who took his career very seriously and had a very strong work ethic. He was a softball coach, President of the Eureka City School Board, an active member of St. Bernardâs Church, and enjoyed playing golf and being a part of a local bowling league. On Thanksgiving, he would always bring home a stranger or two that had nowhere to go. Ed always had a smile on his face and was so accepting of everyone around him.\n\nEd lived his life to its fullest, continuing to seek new adventures, he wanted to learn new things his entire life. He went to the Biggest Loser Camp, attended Clown Camp with his brothers, was an exchange student in Italy for 3 months at 68 years old, ran the Olympic Torch in the 2004 Olympics, was a master woodworker, had a gift for toll painting, travelled extensively, loved photography and took all of the family pictures. One of his favorite hobbies was winemaking. Ed was a wonderful host and loved to have people over.\n\nKind, generous, analytical, wise, passionate, loyal, protective, respected, admired, and a comedian with a great sense of humor. He was a true leader in every sense of the word. He was his children and grandchildrenâs biggest fan and truly believed that they could do anything they put their minds to. He was a great man and will be missed forever.\n\nThe Memorial Service will be held on Friday, October 30th, at 6:30pm, at Nicoletti Funeral Home, 5401 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento, CA. The Funeral Service will be held on Saturday, October 31st, at 2pm, at Our Lady of Assumption Parish, 5057 Cottage Way, Carmichael, CA.

He is survived by his two children, Cary and Scott Warner as well as his two grandchildren Stephanie and Agassi Warner. He was a wonderful and kindhearted man who had a knack for pointing out the error of your ways. He loved life, couldn't get enough of UCLA football and educating students about databases. He was a PHD of computer science and was a retired computer science professor at CSUS. Family, learning, teaching, and drinking coffee were the great joys of his life. We love you paw you will be missed!\n\nRobert Marsh Kloss\n\nNovember 20, 1938 ~ August 4, 2020\n\nRobert (\"Bob\") Kloss passed away on August 4, 2020, at Monument Health Hospice House in Rapid City, South Dakota. Bob was born in Erie, Pennsylvania,on November 20, 1938, to Marsh and Anna E. (Sowa) Kloss. He attended Erie Public Schools and earned a B.A. in Psychology at Pennsylvania State University. He later received his M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in Sociology at Louisiana State University. He served in the armed forces for four years as a Musician in an Air Force Military Band. He played \"the reeds\" (clarinet, saxes) and flute. Music was always an important interest in his life, and he later played in several CSUS faculty bands and in a Community College band in Sacramento.\n\nBob joined the faculty of California State University Sacramento in 1969, where he taught primarily courses in Political Sociology, Social Movements, and Sociological Theory; areas in which he also authored several books. He chaired and served on many Masters Thesis committees, and was a recipient of the Associated Students Teacher of the Year Award in 1997. In addition, he was active in the University's Canadian Studies Program for a number of years, and was a member of the Research Section on Social Movements for the International Sociological Association.\n\nBob was a Democratic Socialist, and that perspective was central to his life both personally and professionally, even in South Dakota, where he moved upon retirement, and where he designed and helped build an Arts and Crafts home in the mountains near Custer. Among other areas of community involvement, Bob was on the Black Hills National Forest Advisory Board for six years.\n\nBob is survived by his wife, Elaine Whittlesy of Custer, Brothers Anthony Kloss of Erie, PA, Joseph Kloss of Erie, PA, John Kloss of Salem OR, sister Elizabeth Shelatz of Sacramento,CA, Marcia Stuczynski of Akron, OH,and many nieces and nephews, and great nieces and nephews.

He spent much of his childhood in the California bay area.\n\nAndy graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. He did graduate work at Penn State, Lehigh University, and the University of Kansas where he received his Doctorate of Engineering. He was a lifetime member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.\n\nEarly in his engineering career he did large-scale experimental work that led to a complex computer model for steam power plant condensers using the punch card technology of the 1960s.\n\nAndy taught engineering design for 34 years starting at Northampton College in Bethlehem, PA and then at California State University, Sacramento, CA. He taught everything from freshman graphics to a graduate course on machine design.\n\nAfter many years of tuning into Radio Australia on his short-wave radio, Andy realized his dream of visiting Down Under. While on a sabbatical leave in 1996, he taught at the University of Technology, Sydney in NSW Australia. He considered this experience a high point in his career.\n\nDuring his tenure at Sacramento State he was the Mechanical Engineering department chair for 5 years and principal investigator on the construction of a unique gas turbine cogeneration laboratory. Combining his interest in cars and educating students, he developed and taught an undergraduate course on vehicle design.\n\nAndy was an avid automobile enthusiast from an early age with particular interest in mid-twentieth century European cars. Classic cars can be finicky and frustrating, but Andy felt a sunny day in an open top car on coastal highway California 1 made it all worthwhile.\n\nHe dabbled in photography and late in life rekindled his interest in model railroading by building a small layout. An opera buff, Andy sent questions to the Saturday radio broadcasts of the Texaco Metropolitan Opera quiz.\n\nAndy and his wife, Linda, enjoyed traveling in Europe and Australia, including his ancestral home of Friesland (now part of the Netherlands), from which his ancestors emigrated to the American colonies in 1659.\n\nAndyâs fascination with Australia extended to the Aussie author Neville Shute. Andyâs search for first editions of Shuteâs novels took him to used book stores in almost every city he visited on 3 continents. He enjoyed interacting with the small but fervent community of other fans at the biennial Shute conferences where he presented papers.\n\nHe was ordained as an elder at the Presbyterian church in Folsom, CA. Subsequently he was vestry Senior Warden at Saint Francis Episcopal church in Fair Oaks, CA.\n\nAndy is survived by his wife, Linda, of 60 years, his sister Mary Banta Whittemore and her husband Ron, his daughter Lois, his son Andy and his partner Linda, his son Geoff and his wife Maria, and his grandchildren Karlan, Erik, and Emmalee.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at a future date.\n\nAnna-Louise Guichard Radimsky\n\npassed away July 2, 2020\n\nWe were saddened to learn of the loss of longtime Computer Science faculty member, Anne-Louise Guichard Radimsky on July 2, 2020.
