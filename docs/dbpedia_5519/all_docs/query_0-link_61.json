        "text": "On this day in‚Ä¶\n\n‚Äì 1787, ‚ÄúAmerican Daniel Shays [left] leads rebellion to seize Federal arsenal to protest debtor‚Äôs prisons.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Before reading the Wikipedia entry on this, I don‚Äôt believe I realized that Shays‚Äô Rebellion lasted a little over four months. I‚Äôd always seen it as a kind of one-week affair. Is it not interesting that two of our first uprisings, including the Whiskey Rebellion, were over perceived unfairness in the redistribution of economic goods?\n\n‚Äì 1879, ‚ÄúThe Bulgarian National Bank is founded.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I thought I‚Äôd throw you off with some really useless information‚Äîconsidering that most of the time I focus on U.S.-related trivia.\n\n‚Äì 1890, ‚ÄúNellie Bly [right] completes her round-the-world journey in 72 days.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Lesson for today: Never, never judge a woman‚Äôs ability to get around by the cut of her dress. üòâ\n\n‚Äì 1917, ‚ÄúThe Danish West Indies [below] is sold to the United States for $25 million.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Now here‚Äôs a territorial purchase that I‚Äôve never noticed in the U.S. survey textbooks. But these are the‚Äîdrumroll please‚ÄîU.S. Virgin Islands. Fact: Slavery was abolished there by Governor Peter von Scholten on July 3, 1848.\n\n‚Äì 1941, ‚ÄúPope Pius XII elevates the Apostolic Vicariate of the Hawaiian Islands to the dignity of a diocese. It becomes the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ In the context of everything happening in Europe and Asia, leading up to World War II, this certainly has the feel of history trivia, yes? It gives new meaning to the phrase.\n\n‚Äì 1942, ‚ÄúWorld War II: Thailand declares war on the United States and United Kingdom.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I consider myself pretty savvy with regard to World War II history and the U.S., but I never knew that Thailand declared war against us. Now I‚Äôll have to rethink my views on the Vietnam War and its regional implications.\n\n‚Äì 1960, ‚ÄúThe National Association of Broadcasters reacts to the Payola scandal by threatening fines for any disc jockeys who accepted money for playing particular records.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Considering what‚Äôs happened in the 1990s and beyond, with regard to Napster and the advent of iPods, this scandal feels pretty small potatoes. We now hardly listen to radio stations in favor of paying for our music directly: we‚Äôve cut out the middle man.\n\n‚Äì 1995, ‚ÄúThe Norwegian Rocket Incident: Russia almost launches a nuclear attack after it mistakes Black Brant XII, a Norwegian research rocket [right], for a US Trident missile.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm continually fascinated by these small, absurdly serious bits of Cold War history. About 25 words sums up the near annihilation of the human race. ‚Äì TL"
