        "text": "Dear Brothers and Sisters in Christ,\n\nWelcome to the new website for the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. Here, we provide you with the latest information about the cathedral, its programs, and those who work rigorously to uphold its majesty.\n\nSince the reign of King Kamehameha III, the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace stood visible from the Honolulu Harbor as a beacon of aid and guidance for the diverse community of the Hawaiian islands. The website looks to expand upon those services by promoting our programs, public events, and Mass schedules in a clear and convenient manner.\n\nThe website is the ideal place to learn about the cathedral’s historical significance and its ties to Hawaiian culture. Prominent figures from the Hawaiian royal family have walked the cathedral grounds and two religious, who served and worshipped in the cathedral, were canonized within the last 15 years. Intact are some of Hawaii’s oldest functioning pieces of architecture that you can see and experience in its full glory, like the cathedral’s bell tower, which has been in use for more than a century.\n\nThe magnificence that radiates from the cathedral’s features is a large factor to what makes visiting the church a grand event. Maintaining the cathedral’s characteristics for future churchgoers is of utmost importance. Through the cathedral’s multi-generational years of service, it has seen its share of refurbishments and restorations, with the most recent one being an ongoing project called the Cathedral Renewal Campaign, which aims to restore the cathedral’s physical condition.\n\nThank you to all who participated in making this essential step to better serve Hawaii’s Catholic community, and those interested in Catholic worship, materialize. The new website for the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace will be a representation of the ongoing services provided by the Church and the Diocese of Honolulu."
