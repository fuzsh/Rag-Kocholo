        "text": "April 19, 2024:\n\nIn Autism Acceptance Month, Flashback Friday features the Institute of Logopedics and its founder, Dr. Martin Palmer, amid students in this 1950s Special Collections photo. Today Heartspring carries on his work to serve the neurodiverse with complex needs and developmental disabilities.\n\nIn fall 1934, Dr. Palmer established the Department of Speech Science at WSU. It continues today as the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders in the College of Health Professions. At its beginning, the Speech Science office, classroom, clinic and lab were located in Room 428 on the top floor of Jardine Hall.\n\nThe name “Institute of Logopedics” was adopted in early 1940 for speech science activities on our campus. Five years later, the Institute was incorporated as a non-profit organization, and, by the end of the decade, its own 40-acre campus consisting of residential, clinical and administration buildings was in operation west of WSU along 21st.\n\nThe Institute of Logopedics was the world’s first residential program for treatment and study of language and speech disorders and the world’s first center to accept persons with multiple disabilities for training. At Palmer’s untimely 1965 death, the Institute of Logopedics was the world’s largest institute of speech and hearing rehabilitation, serving individuals and their families from nearly every state and many countries.\n\nOver the years, many WSU speech pathology and audiology students observed and gained applied learning experiences at the Institute.\n\nIn 1993, the Institute was renamed Heartspring to accommodate the growth of services for those with special needs. Heartspring soon moved to a new campus on 29th between Rock and Webb roads.\n\nIn March 2024, physical therapy and audiology services at Heartspring offered in conjunction with WSU’s College of Health Professions bring the partners full circle 90 years later.\n\nDr. Palmer’s papers are in Special Collections and University Archives.

In this Special Collections’ photo, she and a chauffeur/nurse roll to her graduation held at St. Francis Hospital where WSU Pres. Ahlberg presented her hard-earned degree in social work.\n\nAt 44, Dawson, who never finished high school, enrolled in a WSU continuing ed program which allowed anyone over 25 and out of school at least three years to give college a try. She logged three As and a B and made the dean’s honor roll that semester! Throughout her college years, she had to fight to keep the federal grant which funded her education as a F1rstGen, non-traditional undergrad while overcoming economic hardships.\n\nAfter 5 1/2 years at WSU, while also working and raising 12 children, Dawson (1933-2016) was presented a “Perseverance Award” by the WSU Alumni Association toward the end of her final semester. Unfortunately, just a few days before commencement, she was hospitalized and had to miss the ceremony she had vowed to attend. Remarkably, WSU brought the ceremony to her, complete with a recorded version of the \"Pomp and Circumstance\" processional. President Clark Ahlberg, other WSU officials, medical staff and her family applauded her efforts.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 21, 2024:\n\n#TBT celebrates women journalists!

In many ways o’er the years WSU engineering students have honored their patron saint, Patrick, though probably none more daring than “gracing” Morrison Hall’s clock tower with shamrocks as shown in this 1969 Special Collections photo.\n\nQuiet negotiations during the 1977 construction of Wallace Hall, home of the college of engineering, brought about the shamrocks in front of the building. When the sidewalks leading up to Wallace were poured, legend has it that engineering dean Charles Jakowatz supplied two large metal shamrock outlines to embed in them. Since then, the resulting shamrocks are regularly greened up with paint.\n\nNo clock tower shamrocks have sprouted since 1977.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 08, 2024:\n\nThis Flashback Friday image from Special Collections shows civil rights pioneer Carol Parks with Ron Walters shortly after the successful 1958 Wichita NAACP Youth Council sit-in at the downtown Dockum drug store. The group’s 24 day protest ended segregation at this store’s lunch counter.\n\nThe NAACP Youth Council’s activism not only ended segregation at the downtown Wichita Dockum store, it ended segregation at all Kansas Rexall drug stores of which Dockum stores were part. The courageous and peaceful sit-in led by Parks and Walters happened 18 months before the more well-known sit-ins at Greensboro, North Carolina. Advised by photographer Rosie Hughes and attorney Chester Lewis, Youth Council members rehearsed beforehand in the basement of St. Peter Claver, the city’s African American Catholic church at 11th and Indiana where Parks and her family attended.\n\nFor Women's History Month, we honor Parks and her mother Vivian Sims Parks Curtis (1916-1997) who likely served as an unofficial advisor to the Youth Council sit-in. Active at the local, state and national levels of the NAACP, Vivian held leadership roles and attended national conferences. In 1957, she attended Fisk University’s Institute on Race Relations. Her local parish, the Wichita Catholic Diocese and the Phyllis Wheatley Home, an African American children’s home, benefited from her leadership. In 1947, she organized the city’s first African American Girl Scout troop and led it for a decade.\n\nParks, later known as Carol Parks Hahn, earned a WSU undergrad business degree (’76) and a communication master’s (’82) and then worked in housing and employment. She raised 3 sons and was married for a time to internationally known jazz guitarist Jerry Hahn who attended WSU in the late ‘50s-early ‘60s and later taught here. Carol Parks Hahn died 4-15-2023.\n\nThe image comes from the 9-11-1958 issue of the Enlightener newspaper. Copies of the Enlightener are in Special Collections along with numerous other local African American newspapers.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 23, 2024:\n\nOn Flashback Friday we honor the incredible courage of Congressional Medal of Honor recipient Capt. Riley Leroy Pitts, who died in battle in Vietnam. In this 1960 Special Collections photo, he is shown in action as the news editor of the Sunflower, WSU’s student newspaper.\n\nA First-Gen student from Oklahoma, Pitts was on the Sunflower staff as reporter, columnist and editor. He belonged to the Pershing Rifles Army ROTC, winning the distinguished military student award as a junior. An exemplar of student involvement, he was a member of the Spanish Club, the Press Club and the Reapers men’s pep club and was a Pep Council officer, chairing its “Rally Day” in 1959.\n\nAt WU’s spring 1960 commencement, Pitts received a journalism degree and was commissioned as an army reserve 2nd lieutenant. He began his military career in Vietnam as an information officer and quickly moved up to the captain rank. To grow in leadership, Capt. Pitts volunteered for combat service a few months before his hitch was up. While commanding his troops in jungle combat on October 31, 1967, he lobbed a grenade that ricocheted back to him. According to accounts, he threw himself without hesitation on the grenade which did not explode. Later the same day he was mortally wounded during fierce fighting.\n\nFor his valor, he was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, becoming the first African American commissioned military officer to receive the nation’s highest military honor. President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the medal to his widow Eula and children Stacie and Mark on December 10, 1968, during a White House ceremony.\n\nIn 2014, the Military & Veteran Student Center at WSU was named in his honor.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 14, 2024:\n\nGuess who decided to make a surprise visit to Special Collections on this lovely Valentine's Day?\n\nNone other than the iconic James Dean himself! Decked out in his signature charm, he's absolutely glowing with love for WSU as he showcases a newly acquired shirt from our artifact collections.\n\nCheck out his era (1950s!) in our digital WSU yearbooks and newspapers on SOAR here!\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 11, 2024:\n\nCongratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on their Super Bowl win yesterday!\n\nDid you know that \"Jumpy\" Geathers, a two-time Super Bowl champion and the last WSU football player in the NFL, played a crucial role in his team's successes? Back in the early 80s, Geathers, a defensive tackle for WSU, showcased his talent on the field while being coached by Willie Jeffries and alongside quarterback Prince McJunkins. Talk about a legendary lineup!\n\nGeathers won his Super Bowl rings in 1992 with Washington and 1997 with Denver. His signature NFL move? It's the \"Forklift,\" in which he literally picks up opposing offensive linemen and drives them back toward their quarterback.\n\nHere's a special glimpse of this '83 picture from Special Collections featuring the unstoppable 6'7\" force of nature, Jumpy Geathers, in hot pursuit!\n\nSee original post at: Facebook TwitterInstagram\n\nFebruary 09, 2024:\n\nToday’s Flashback Friday salutes Dr. Robert E. Weems, Jr.’s documentation of Wichita’s African American business history. From 2011 to 2014, he interviewed 34 VIPs, and, in 2018, donated the resulting audio and transcripts to Special Collections. Access online here.\n\nMore than 25 hours of audio tell of business experiences, accomplishments and history of Black Wichitans recognized as entrepreneurs in fields ranging from construction, architecture, mortuary services, publishing, aviation, food services and production to oil drilling, medicine, politics and many others. The participants discuss community life, their own families and backgrounds as well as their motivations, challenges and more.\n\nTo commemorate Black History Month, KWCH 12 News reporter Brock Wilson interviewed Dr. Weems, WSU’s Willard W. Garvey Distinguished Professor of Business History, about the collection and the city’s Black business history.

On Flashback Friday, here’s a 1967 photo from Special Collections and University Archives of the chapter’s founding members. Epsilon Alpha was the first African American national sorority chartered at WSU.\n\nEfforts of Wichita’s Beta Kappa Omega alumnae chapter of the sorority helped establish the campus chapter. Influential WSU alum and BKΩ member Jo Brown served as the chapter’s first advisor. Its meetings were held at the Campus Activities Center, now the Rhatigan Student Center, and, in fall 1967, its first-ever rush party was held at Fairmount Towers, a WSU residence hall which once stood at the northwest corner of 21st and Hillside.\n\nThere’s more AKA EA history in digital Parnassus yearbooks and Sunflower newspapers on SOAR here.

His papers in Special Collections reveal a remarkable career with Beech and Lear Jet in which he crossed the Atlantic nearly 500 times and the Pacific 80+. His retirement plans? Conquer both poles!\n\nA native of Budapest, Sandor \"Alex\" Kvassay secretly performed work for the West following World War II by photographing encrypted telegrams and code books created and used by the Hungarian Foreign Service to inform American and British governments of the rise of Communism in Hungary. In 1948, he immigrated to the United States as a political refugee.\n\nFollowing military service, Kvassay came to Wichita in 1953 to work for Beech Aircraft. His fluency in six languages helped land many international sales for the company. In 1965, he joined the international marketing division of Lear Jet where he boosted its high-performance executive air travel with his brand of corporate aircraft marketing. His papers tell of meetings with world leaders, business moguls and celebrities. Through it all, he consistently chronicled his experiences in photos and recollections.\n\nLearn more about the intrepid Kvassay through papers and images here.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJanuary 19, 2024:\n\nToday’s Flashback Friday from Special Collections shows the Shocker Store circa 1965! Anchoring the south end of the Rhatigan Student Center since 1959, WSU’s “official store” offers course materials, trendy WSU merch, school supplies and, yes, even old fashioned textbooks.\n\nA small clapboard building tucked between McKinley Hall and the Human Resources Center served as the bookstore prior to 1959. It sat at the present site of the CAC Theater. In the 1930s, the bookstore was located in the school’s former cafeteria at the southwest corner of 17th and Fairmount. Until it was destroyed by fire in 1929, Fairmount Hall, the first building on campus, was home to the original campus bookstore.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJanuary 12, 2024:\n\nFlashback Friday 60 years to “Century II” shown in this 1964 rendering from the papers of its architects John Hickman & Roy Varenhorst held by Special Collections. The round structure with its distinctive blue roof and Frank Lloyd Wright influences was dedicated January 11, 1969.\n\nCitizens passed a $15 million bond issue in 1961 to construct in downtown Wichita a “Civic Cultural Center,” an early name for the structure, and a new public library. By February 1963, basic plans formulated by community leaders and architects came together. Two years later demolition of the area began, and an official groundbreaking ceremony took place January 25, 1966.\n\nJust as Wichita was set to begin its second century, Century II was completed. The grand opening lasted nine days! It included the inauguration ceremonies for Kansas governor Robert Docking, performances by WSU musical groups, a panel discussion by distinguished Kansans and a four-day run of the “Holiday on Ice” show.\n\nEnjoy more early WSU views here.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJanuary 05, 2024:\n\nFlashback Friday to winter fun ca. 1898!

At WSU from 1966 to 1972, she earned undergrad and master’s degrees in biology. She’s at the center in this 1970 Special Collections photo of Mortar Board sr. women’s honor society members.\n\nA native of nearby Benton, Kansas, and a grad of Circle High School in Towanda, the future Dr. Sweet was awarded WSU’s prestigious Harry Gore Memorial Scholarship in spring 1966 as an incoming freshman who demonstrated character, academic ability and leadership potential. This investment by WSU has multiplied many times over in the course of her national and international work on HIV/AIDS.\n\nWhile on campus, she was active in SPURS national honor society, Mortar Board honor society and Army Blues, a women’s drill team. She was one of seven students to graduate summa cum laude in 1970. Her 1972 master’s thesis is preserved in the WSU Libraries.\n\nIn 1982, Dr. Sweet completed medical school at the University of Kansas School of Medicine-Wichita. The next year she saw her first HIV/AIDS patient. Since then, she has worked tirelessly to dispel fear and stigma around the disease, advance care and treatment of those with HIV/AIDS and educate caregivers, families, friends and the public. At the height of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, she gave 10 to 15 talks each month while caring for a growing number of patients. She and her team at the KU Wichita Internal Medicine Midtown Clinic currently care for more than 1300 patients in Kansas.\n\nWSU bestowed upon Dr. Sweet an honorary doctorate in December 2015 for her years of service to patients with HIV/AIDS and for contributions to health care education.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nNovember 23, 2023: This thankful Throwback Thursday goes way back to our first-ever football game!

Team pic in Dec. ‘97 Sunflower is from Special Collections.\n\nAccording to newspaper accounts, over 1000 fans at the “Garfield Gridiron,” now Friends University, bedecked in school colors, braved the wind and yelled “at fever heat” on Saturday, Nov. 20, 1897. The contest, won by Fairmount 12-4, was the city’s only football game of the season.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nNovember 17, 2023: We’re proud to feature Native educator Elizabeth Bender Cloud (Ojibwe) in today’s Flashback Friday. At center back in this 1918 Special Collections photo, she and spouse Henry (Winnebago), holding daughter Marion, founded the Roe Indian Institute across 21st from WSU in 1915.\n\nThe Institute, later renamed the American Indian Institute, held its first classes in rooms on our campus. Construction was underway but incomplete at the Institute when the 1915 school term began.\n\nElizabeth and Henry Cloud brought in G. Elmer Lindquist as the Institute’s first principal. His nephew Emory Lindquist would later serve as the 8th president of WSU.\n\nIn Wichita 1915-39, Elizabeth played important roles in the Institute and in the community. She was an in-demand public speaker, served as East High School’s PTA president and took classes at the University of Wichita. After moving to Oregon in 1939 where Henry (1884-1950) was superintendent of the Umatilla Indian Agency, Elizabeth (1887-1965) was the first Native selected “American Mother of 1950” by the Golden Rule Foundation.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nNovember 10, 2023: Today’s Flashback Friday pays tribute to Jerry Shaw (1942-2022) Osage Nation Elder and longtime WSU instructor of Native history, culture and issues.

She’s shown here, second from left, in a vintage shot from Special Collections. A remarkable chapter in WSU’s history closes with her upcoming retirement\n\nIn 1979, Kathy Downes joined the WSU faculty as the biomedical librarian. By 1985, she was the administrative services librarian, a role that encompassed circulation, facilities and coordination of the multi-year library expansion project resulting in the beautiful spaces currently enjoyed in Ablah Library. She also helped plan the original 24 hour study room and its expansion in 2019. The migration of library systems toward cloud-based systems is another accomplishment.

The \"Aircrafter,\" reminiscent of a college yearbook, was produced by employees in 1941 and 1942. The 1941 volume documents the company's efforts to support Allied forces during World War II through the production of T-50 trainers. The 1942 edition documents the company’s continuing support for the Allied war effort in building T-50 trainer plane and receiving the Army-Navy \"E\" Award for Production.

Men competed in the sport from 1964 to 1970 and women in the 1970s.\n\nBob Carroll, shown here, excelled at still rings, pommel horse and parallel bars. His multiple individual event championships propelled WSU to 2nd place in the 1969 and 1970 Missouri Valley Conference meets. He pulled off a three-peat in the pommel horse, winning the MVC title in 1968, 1969 and 1970. He also took 1st in the parallel bars and 3rd in the still rings at the 1969 meet.\n\nCarroll, paralyzed from polio at age 4, gradually improved through a series of corrective surgeries. He took up gymnastics as a sophomore at Wichita East high school and quickly showed promise, placing 4th in the still rings at the state championships his first year of competition. He went on to win state titles in the still rings and pommel horse his junior year. For his final prep season, he repeated as state champion in the still rings and pommel horse and added another title in the parallel bars.\n\nIn a newspaper report, his high school coach Marc Webb called Carroll the \"finest athlete he's ever coached.\" Those sentiments were echoed by his WSU coach Dan Tuckwood: \"He is, without a doubt, the best overall gymnast who has ever come out of Wichita State.\"\n\nCarroll graduated from WSU with degrees in chemistry, earning a bachelor's in 1970 and master's in 1983. His thesis is preserved and available in the WSU Libraries. The Parnassus yearbook from which the accompanying photo comes and the Sunflower student newspaper, preserved by Special Collections and University Archives, document Carroll and the gymnastics programs at WSU. Digital copies of the yearbooks and newspapers are available on the SOAR institutional repository.\n\nAfter WSU, he worked as a gymnastics coach and Bombardier Learjet chemist. Carroll, 74, died April 26, 2023.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJuly 28, 2023: For #DisabilityPrideMonth and #FlashbackFriday we go back 80 years to the first assistance dog-human twosomes on our campus! Pics of Ruth & Simone and Clessia & Molly are in the 1943 Parnassus yearbook preserved by Special Collections. The women, both visually impaired, earned sociology degrees. Click here to go to the 1943 Parnassus yearbook digitized by Technical Services and made accessible online.\n\nLocal newspapers tell about and city directories document Rigg's work as a teacher and case worker in Wichita. Her first assistance dog Simone Simon, named after an actress, was a silver gray German Shepherd trained by Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, New Jersey. She credits Ray McGuire, a visually impaired University of Wichita grad, with teaching her to read and write in Braille and to use the typewriter. Rigg died in 1996.\n\nMolly and Clessia Blakeslee came together in fall 1939. The following spring newspapers across the nation picked up a news item about the pair. It seems there was a question if Molly's picture would be allowed to appear in the Parnassus yearbook. Blakeslee told the yearbook's editors that \"Molly's always with me. If I'm in there, Molly's going to be in there, too.\" An exception was made! Blakeslee later graduated from Texas Tech with a master's in psychology. She served as a psychologist and program coordinator at Texas Lions Camp in Kerrville, Texas, from 1958 to 1963. She married Lester Himes in 1963 and moved near Hunstville, Alabama. Her 2011 obituary states she met Helen Keller.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJuly 21, 2023: #OTD 153 years ago Wichita was incorporated! And just 3 short years later, traveling artist E. S. (Eli Sheldon) Glover drew up this “birds eye view” looking southeast at the rapidly developing city. Copy in Special Collections belonged to James R. Mead, one of Wichita’s founders. (Click image to go to larger view!)\n\nAccording to newspaper accounts, Glover began working on his Wichita view in May 1873. In its May 22, 1873 issue, the Wichita Eagle reported \"every business house, public house and private residence will be shown, and the names given to the streets\" on the completed work. The finished product was delivered in August. On August 13, 1873, the Wichita Weekly Beacon described the lithograph as showing \"our beautiful little city nestled in the valley, at ten fold advantage, not a house in the town or vicinity that is not represented, the river, bridge, and even West Wichita is portrayed truthfully and exact.\"\n\nThe 1873 birds eye view of Wichita is part of a larger collection of maps held by Special Collections.

Special Collections holds this 1918 snapshot by American WWI aviator Lt. Willburt E. Kinsley. (Can you spot the burst of color in the photograph we added?)\n\nThe Willburt E. Kinsley Papers in Special Collections contains photographs and documents relating to Kinsley's military service in World War I and World War II. Most of the collection is comprised of photographs taken by Kinsley during World War I in which he documents locations, people, and activities in France of the 90th Squadron, American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), United States Air Service. These images show aircraft, landing fields, airport structures, barracks, drill grounds and fellow soldiers as well as locations he visited on leave. There also are photographs from Kinsley’s time spent in training at Gerstner Field in Louisiana and at liberty in New York. Several official documents concern his World War I Distinguished Service Cross and discharge. His World War I pilot log book provides detail on training and military missions in 1917 and 1918.\n\nSelected materials from the collection are accessible in digital form here.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJuly 7, 2023: #FlashbackFriday 105 years to wheat harvest, 1918 style. This photograph in Special Collections shows Eldon Cessna, age 11, on a tractor while his father, aviation pioneer Clyde Cessna, stands atop a threshing machine.\n\nAt that time, harvest was labor- and machine-intensive. The caption written by Eldon Cessna on the back of the photo identifies the scene as \"40\" Case Separator; 30-60 Rumely Tractor - E.W.C. on Engine & CVC (Dad) standing on separator threshing stacked wheat in 1918. 8 hired men did pitching grain into machine.\" His caption identifies the equipment in use: a 40 inch separator, also known as a thresher, made by agricultural equipment manufacturer Case and a 30-60 Oil Pull tractor manufactured by Rumely. (The tractor's model name \"30-60 Oil Pull\" combines the horsepower rating, 30 for pulling and 60 for powering a belt, and the use of oil for cooling.) Eldon also notes the people involved: He's on the tractor, his dad's on the thresher and 8 hired men are pitchforking wheat stacked on the ground into the thresher. There's also a team of horses standing by to pull the thresher to the next location in the wheat field.\n\nThe photograph, part of the Cessna Family Papers in Special Collections, was donated in 2017 by Janice Cessna Clarke, the daughter of Eldon Cessna. Materials in the collection include correspondence, newspaper clippings, magazines, advertisements, financial records, awards given to Clyde and Eldon Cessna, materials from clubs to which Cessna family members belonged, aircraft design books, blueprints for Cessna aircraft, books for pilots, aircraft parts catalogs, documents from air races, family photographs and the writings of several members of the Cessna family including diary entries about farming by Eldon's mother Europa Cessna. Selected materials from the collection are accessible in digital form here.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJuly 4, 2023: #OTD 247 years ago, the Declaration of Independence, America’s founding document, was signed! This poster in Special Collections shows the main author Thomas Jefferson standing to the right with key contributors Benjamin Franklin (right) and John Adams (left) seated in the foreground.\n\nIllustrated by James Henry Daugherty in 1942, the poster was intended to generate patriotism and purchases of the Treasury Department’s war savings stamps and bonds that helped finance the U.S. World War II effort. The last line of the Declaration overlays the artwork: “We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”\n\nThe poster is one of four famous scenes from the American Revolutionary War printed on a single 36” x 24” sheet. It occupies the upper right; the other posters show George Washington crossing the Delaware, the militia at Lexington and John Paul Jones declaring “I have not yet begun to fight.” The center of the large sheet reads, “To exhibit these posters to best advantage please cut apart along the dotted lines and display separately.” View the catalog record for the four panel poster here.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Instagram\n\nJuly 1, 2023: Flashback Friday to this 1926 ad for Coleman Camp Stoves & Lanterns. Coleman marketed the Wichita-built products via Hollywood stars like Rin Tin Tin & June Marlowe, the couple shown here. The ad is from a large collection of Coleman Company records in Special Collections.\n\nThe collection contains archival material created and used by Coleman, originally the Hydro-Carbon Light Company, a lighting rental service for rural Americans before mass electrification, and now a large outdoor and sporting goods company. It demonstrates the rise of marketing, mass production and retail in 20th century America. Access the finding aid for the collection here.\n\nThe German Shepherd and his co-star were photographed on location during the filming of Warner Brothers’ silent movie “The Night Cry.” The photo is in a series of advertisements featuring popular film actors of the mid 1920s endorsing Coleman products. View the ad in its entirety in a digital collection.\n\nDid you know Rin Tin Tin was rescued from a World War I battlefield in France by an American soldier?

The summer of ’83 offered Shockers swimming, dance, golf, archery, fencing, martial arts, volleyball, basketball, racquetball, track and tennis all in one place! This color rendering comes from the University Archives.\n\nThe facility, originally “Complex for Dance, Physical Education, and Recreation,” was renamed and dedicated in 1984 as the Heskett Center in honor of alumnus H. Dene Heskett ’35 whose major gift to WSU was dedicated to his parents. The Olympic size swimming pool and diving well were made possible by a gift from Gladys Wiedemann. Her generosity brought about Wiedemann Hall and its Marcussen organ a few years later.\n\nIn 2023, the Heskett Center houses Wichita State Campus Recreation, Wichita State Sport Management, Human Performance Studies and the Dance Department. The facility contains classrooms, offices, human performance studies lab, dance studios, cardio, circuit and weight rooms, rock climbing wall, swimming pool and diving well, running track, basketball/volleyball courts, Esports hub, activity rooms and pickleball courts.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJune 19, 2023:\n\nIn 1978, activist Doris Kerr Larkins helped Wichita celebrate Juneteenth for the first time! Her papers, held by Special Collections, are proof she was determined to make it happen. The inaugural Juneteenth featured a rodeo, picnic and the “Freedom Ball” advertised in this flyer.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJune 16, 2023:\n\nOn this Flashback Friday, the sun is literally and figuratively setting on Cessna Stadium. Demolition on the structure has begun.\n\nPlans for a 15,000-seat concrete football stadium near 21st and Hillside started in the late 1930s but were halted by World War II. After the war, the stadium became Veterans Field, a memorial to Sedgwick County's 17,800 WWII veterans. It saw action in September 1946 but wasn't dedicated until completed in late November 1948.\n\nIn spring 1968, WSU announced a $1.5 million remodeling of Veterans Field. WSU students voted to increase fees by 25 cents per credit hour to fund a 20-year revenue bond, financing half the expansion project. The stadium was renamed in recognition of Cessna Aircraft Company's $300,000 gift. Construction on Cessna Stadium began in February 1969 and was dedicated on September 13, 1969.\n\nBetween 1969 and 1986, the teams had only two winning seasons. Under athletic director Ted Bredehoft (1972-1982), the stadium hosted offbeat promotions like camel races and the Shocker Mountain Ski School. The first snow skiing lessons were held on September 26, 1977, despite the 96-degree heat.\n\nBudgetary issues and low fan interest led to the closure of WSU football at Cessna Stadium. The last home game on November 7, 1986, saw the Shockers lose 10-17 to Illinois State with a small attendance of 4,223. Football was officially dropped by WSU shortly after.\n\nSince then, the stadium has been renovated in 1996 and 2002, hosting various events such as the “Celebrate” Independence Day fireworks shows, an Operation Rescue rally, the Kansas State High School Activities Association’s annual state track meet, and a Rolling Stones concert on October 1, 2006.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJune 14, 2023:\n\nToday we commemorate the US flag’s adoption on June 14, 1777. This Civil War era letter held in Special Collections was written in 1862 on stationery featuring a flag, stars and an eagle. It’s from new bride Eliza Isely to her husband, a Union soldier stationed at Ft. Leavenworth.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJune 09, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday 60 years to June 9, 1963, when the first PhD was awarded at WSU! This photo from Special Collections shows the recipient, Dr. Goro Kamiyama, between Dr. Martin Palmer (l) and Dr. John Breazeale. His PhD was in Logopedics, now Communication Sciences and Disorders.\n\nIn 1959, Kamiyama, already a physician and dentist in Tokyo, moved to Wichita at age 32. He studied four years with Dr. Martin Palmer, founder of the Institute of Logopedics, once part of Wichita State and now known as Heartspring. Arising from his own experiences, Kamiyama’s aim was to help those who stutter. His dissertation about stuttering, based on experiments conducted with the help of Wichita Heights High students, is held in the University Archives.\n\nWhile in Wichita, Kamiyama, a Fulbright scholar, lived with his wife Akiko and son Hideki on the Logopedics campus, photographed weddings and trained actors in the art of Japanese sword fighting for a 1962 Wichita Community Theater production of “Rashomon.”\n\nThe PhD in logopedics awarded to Kamiyama was also the first of its kind in the U.S.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nJune 02, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday to the first Pride Week at WSU!

This song was dedicated to “mothers, wives & daughters of our fallen heroes” who began the ritual of decorating graves with flowers and flags at this time each year.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMay 26, 2023:\n\nOn Flashback Friday we pay our respects to library benefactor Don Ablah ‘54 who recently passed away. In this 1961 photo from the University Archives, Don is with his uncle Harvey who holds a plaque recognizing the Ablah family’s pledge to the University to build and fund a much-needed new library.\n\nFor many decades, Don was the torchbearer of the family’s commitment. His enduring interest in and financial support of students, education, scholarly pursuits, civil rights and all things Wichita continues in the next generation of Ablahs. We are all the better for Don Ablah’s dedication.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMay 19, 2023:\n\nCelebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander Month on Flashback Friday, we honor Wayne Wong (r). A few months after this photo, he came to Wichita from China as a “paper son,” carrying false papers. Decades later, Wong, successful in business, endowed a fund to support the WSU Libraries.\n\nWhen the 1935 photo of Wong and his family in China was taken, his father was already living in Wichita. Wong joined him here at age 13 after enduring a lengthy interrogation about his background. He memorized every detail of a 60 page deposition to uphold his “paper son” status as the son of an American. At the time, US laws prevented Chinese immigrants from entering the country legally.\n\nWong (1922-2021) attended school in Wichita, rising to be junior class vice president at North High. After Pearl Harbor, he enlisted in the military and was assigned to the sole Chinese-American Army unit, the 987th Signal Operations Co. A decorated veteran, Wong earned his US citizenship in 1964 through the federal government’s amnesty program. His company, Wong Enterprises, owned restaurants and real estate businesses in Wichita.\n\nIn retirement, he wrote his autobiography, American Paper Son: A Chinese Immigrant in the Midwest, published by the University of Illinois press.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMay 12, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday 121 years to the class of 1902! The grads, from left to right, are Gail Rhodes, Frank Van Buskirk, Blanche Houston, mustachioed Alfred Roulet, Harriet Sewall, Luella McGinnis and Charles Isely. Photo from Special Collections & University Archives.\n\nFrom sources in the University Archives, here’s the rousing class yell:\n\nZanee! Zanee! Biff! Bam! Boo!\n\nHeo! Hio! Rah! Rah! Roo!\n\nLinga, Linga, Linga, Loo!\n\nFairmount Seniors 1902!\n\nThe “Fairmount Seniors 1902” led interesting post-graduate lives. Before marrying, Rhodes taught in the Philippines and Kansas, Houston taught in Oklahoma and Sewall earned a master’s in education at the University of Chicago. McGinnis raised a family of six, two of whom graduated from the University of Wichita. Roulet became a medical doctor and practiced in Chicago. Van Buskirk ranched and farmed in Kansas and Oklahoma. Isely, brother of Fairmount College dean W. H. Isely and librarian M. Alice Isely, was a lumber dealer and civic leader in southwest Kansas and a war correspondent for the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 1952, the women all returned to campus to be admitted to the Alumni Association’s 50-year club. The men were deceased.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMay 05, 2023:\n\nOn this Flashback Friday, we go back 115 years to this sweet photo of aviation legend Clyde Cessna’s nephews, the children of Dr. Eugene Wallace and Grace Cessna Wallace. In the middle is none other than Dwane Wallace who, after graduating from the University of Wichita in 1932, led the Cessna Aircraft Company for over 50 years.\n\nHe’s shown here with brothers Dwight (left) and Deane. Dwight (1909-1964), an attorney, worked for Cessna and Beech aircraft. Like his father, Deane (1915-1975) was a physician. The Wallace boys’ little sister was Doreen (1926-2018). They are the children of Dr. Eugene Wallace and Clyde Cessna’s sister Grace.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nApril 28, 2023:\n\nFor Flashback Friday in National Library Week, we feature a treasured book recently donated to Special Collections. This annotated copy of Uncloistered Halls: The Centennial History of Wichita State University (1995) is from former WSU president Eugene M. Hughes’ personal library.\n\nThe book’s author, WSU history professor Dr. Craig Miner, inscribed the copy to President Hughes “who advances a tradition that has become substantial.” It’s obvious President Hughes made good use of the book. His notations and bookmarks are found throughout.\n\nArchival sources held by Special Collections and University Archives were extensively researched by Dr. Miner while writing the book.\n\nPresident Hughes served as Wichita State’s 11th president from 1993 to 1998 when he retired. He died in Arizona March 10, 2021.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nApril 21, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday 60 years to spring 1963!

Lamella comes from lamellae, the ribbed structures that hold up the undersides of mushrooms!\n\nDesigned by Wichita architects Schmidt-McVay and Peddie, the Field House opened in late 1955. Its structural steel dome roof weighed in at 450 tons! Wichita’s Watkins Inc. supplied the steel for contractors Dondlinger and Sons, also of Wichita.\n\nThe building was renamed Henry Levitt Arena March 3, 1969. A capital campaign in the early 2000s brought about renovations to the structure and a new name, Charles Koch Arena, in honor of Koch Industries’ $6 million gift.\n\nSee original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nApril 07, 2023:\n\nNo good for directions, early Kansas maps collected and digitized by WSU Libraries, Special Collections, go way back on this Flashback Friday. Detail of this 1556 Italian map shows Kansas places, Quivira and Cibola, recorded by the Spanish explorer Coronado on his 1541 expedition.\n\nOn its website, Special Collections describes and makes accessible over 325 maps from 1556 to 1900 showing the area that becomes Kansas. Mapmakers depict changes in Kansas’ boundaries, trails and cultures with elaborate details, artistic flourishes and inventive spellings of the state’s name. Variations include Kanzas, Kansees, Cansa, Canses, Cansas, Kanses, Konsa and Kansez.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 31, 2023:\n\nFor this final Flashback Friday in Womens' History Month, we salute Dr. Hazel Branch, the first woman as a STEM professor and chair at WSU. Her contributions are documented in the WSU Libraries via archival records in Special Collections, published works and the Virtual Herbarium on SOAR.\n\nOne hundred years ago, Kansas native Hazel E. Branch (1886-1973) joined the faculty of Fairmount College as professor and chair of biology after earning her Ph.D. from Cornell. From 1922 to 1956, she taught numerous prospective doctors and scientists at Fairmount College and the University of Wichita.\n\nAmong those she inspired were Dr. Cramer Reed ’37, the founding dean of WSU’s College of Health Professions, and Dr. Vincent Gott ’51, standing at left in this 1949 photo, a co-inventor of the pacemaker.\n\nIn 1938, Dr. Branch's biography was included in \"American Men of Science.\"\n\nShe kept track of her former students who, at her retirement, numbered nearly 200 doctors, 90 medical technologists, 60 dentists, 40 nurses, several pharmacists, a few with doctorates in various scientific fields and 4 attorneys.\n\nIn 1975, the Hazel Branch Endowed Scholarship was established from her estate for those students majoring in biology with the intent to attend a medical school.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 24, 2023:\n\nOn Flashback Friday, we honor Bobbye Humphrey (1927-2018) for Womens' History Month. Her groundbreaking work leading Affirmative Action at Wichita State is documented in archival records and presidential papers held by WSU Libraries, Special Collections and University Archives.\n\nHumphrey was the first African American woman hired to teach at WSU. She came on in the fall of 1968 when WSU first offered a major in social work. Four years later, President Clark Ahlberg tapped her to be assistant dean of faculties for personnel.\n\nHumphrey was the first woman and first Black member of the influential council of vice presidents and deans. She was responsible for implementing the new federally mandated Affirmative Action program at WSU. The aim in 1972 was to ensure conditions of consistent, fair and equitable recruitment, employment and advancement for all persons in every area of the university.\n\nHumphrey devoted her life to advocating for others and gaining equity for all women and people of color. Her professional and community involvement and achievements are a testament to her commitment to equality, justice and opportunity for all.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 10, 2023:\n\nFor Flashback Friday we honor silent movie star Margarita Fischer for Women’s History Month. Shown here in “The Girl Who Dared” one-reeler, this child performer and stage ingénue began working in films in 1910. Four years later, she was voted the nation’s favorite actress.\n\nFischer’s papers along with those of her husband Harry Pollard are available for research in Special Collections. They tell of her life on stage and screen; marriage to and professional work with actor and director Pollard, a native of Kansas; business acumen; and devotion to family, who often played supporting roles in her movies.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 03, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday to 1970 when Dana Jones and Cynthia Scully played records in Grace Wilkie Hall.

It was named in honor of Grace Wilkie who served the University for 41 years.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 01, 2023:\n\nFor Women History Month we honor Miranda “Minnie” Morrison, our first First Lady. Minnie, the young scholar pictured here, met Nathan J. Morrison, her future partner and Wichita State’s first president, while a student in his Greek class at Michigan’s Olivet College.\n\nIn the course of their marriage, the Morrisons played key roles in the history of three Congregational colleges: Olivet, Drury and Fairmount. He was president, chief fundraiser and professor while she was a supportive spouse and mother to hundreds of college students and their three children. In 1895, the Congregational Education Society and Wichita businessmen brought in the well-respected couple to lead the fledgling Fairmount College, WSU’s forerunner.\n\n“Mother Morrison” stayed on in Wichita after her husband died in 1907. She remained active in the Fairmount Congregational Church and the Ladies Library Club. Eventually, she moved to Ohio to be with her son Douglas. At her death in 1926, she was buried next to her husband in Wichita’s Maple Grove Cemetery, a short distance south of WSU.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 24, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday to 1994 when Walton E. Morgan ‘55/’60 brought a youthful ensemble to the Northeast Senior Center near WSU. “MRMUSIC,” as his personalized license plate read, loved making music with anyone from grade schoolers to senior citizens.\n\nAt Wichita North HS, Morgan was the first and only African American band member. After graduating in 1939, he joined the Army during WWII and played clarinet in military bands. On his return from the service, he earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in music education from the University of Wichita and began his teaching career.\n\nMorgan taught in the Wichita public schools – first segregated and then integrated – for 34 years, retiring in 1986. He also played with jazz greats like Count Basie and Duke Ellington when they performed in Wichita. In later years, he continued making music by giving free lessons on nearly any instrument and forming the Morgan Mid-Towners, a band of senior citizen musicians who played gigs at area churches, care homes and other events. Walton Morgan died July 24, 1996.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 17, 2023:\n\nFlashback Friday to Gordon Parks in his 9th grade school photo! Parks attended grades 1-9 at the segregated Plaza School before going to – and dropping out of – the integrated high school in his hometown of Fort Scott, Kansas.\n\nParks never forgot his Plaza School classmates. Twenty-three years after graduation, he, as a Life magazine photojournalist, tracked them down while on assignment for a piece on segregated schools and their impact on Black children. Unfortunately, the photo essay on his classmates and what became of them was never published. It was bumped by the magazine to make space for a piece about the 1951 firing of General Douglas MacArthur by President Harry S. Truman.\n\nSee original post at:Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 14, 2023:\n\nSpecial Collections holds this sweet hand-lettered valentine in the Center for the Calligraphic Arts’ archives.

Jo, a musician and WU education grad, was the first African American to serve on the Wichita school board. Her husband Val, Wichita native and 2nd generation physician, was a beloved family doc.\n\nIn the 1970s, Jo Brown was elected for two terms on the Wichita school board, and during her terms, the board worked through the issue of school integration. Active in church, civic, and political groups, she helped establish the Epsilon Alpha AKA undergraduate chapter here at WSU. Jo also founded and directed A.R.I.S.E. (African-Americans Renewing Interest in Spirituals Ensemble), whose performances continue to educate audiences and cultivate interest in these folksongs.\n\nDr. Brown (1924-2022) graduated from Wichita’s North High and then attended the University of Wichita in the early 1940s. He moved on to Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he received his medical degree. Dr. Brown practiced in Wichita for nearly 45 years, positively impacting the healthcare of thousands in his hometown.\n\nSee original post at:FacebookTwitter Instagram\n\nFebruary 01, 2023:\n\nTo kick off Black History Month, we salute Shocker legend Linwood Sexton ’48, the first African American to play for the Wichita State Men's Basketball team. Suiting up for one year as a freshman, he was a starter and captain in 1944-45.\n\nSexton (1926-2017) accomplished this during a time when African Americans weren’t allowed to stay in the same hotel, eat in the same restaurant, or even travel to certain away games as the rest of the team. Rising above these constraints, Sexton lettered in football, basketball, and track—and graduated with an education degree. He is Wichita State University’s football all-time rushing leader with 1,995 yards and a Shocker Hall of Fame charter inductee.\n\nA community leader and champion of education, Sexton taught sixth grade at the segregated L’Ouverture elementary school in Wichita but was denied the chance to teach and coach at the high school level. At that time, Wichita schools didn’t hire Black people as high school teachers and coaches.\n\nSexton went on to become the first Black supervisor at Steffen’s Dairy (now Hiland Dairy) and served on numerous city and state boards, including the Kansas Board of Regents. His impact on the community was honored by the WSU Alumni Association in 1977 and the Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce in 2006.\n\nSee original post at:FacebookTwitter Instagram\n\nJanuary 29, 2023:\n\nOn this day 110 years ago: Every Kansan was urged to mail some of these penny postcards to their friends in other states on Kansas Day, January 29, 1913.

A tiny woman, Mrs. Carter was enormously generous to the library at Fairmount College, WSU’s forerunner. In 1910, this faithful friend gave a beautifully furnished second-floor room of books and periodicals in the newly constructed campus library with funds she made selling books and magazine subscriptions.\n\nLegend has it she would stop an acquaintance on the street to say, “ I have entered a subscription for you to the Saturday Evening Post” or some such magazine. The astonished person was then obligated to pay up! Books and periodicals she donated and gave money to buy are still in the University Libraries. Be on the lookout for her bookplate and rules for the “proper care of books.” See original post at: Twitter Instagram\n\nOctober 20, 2022:\n\nThrowback Thursday 75 years to the sign-on of Station WU, our first student-run radio station.

See original post at:Twitter Instagram\n\nSuiting up for four seasons, he played on the undefeated freshman team of 1949 and captained the squad his senior year.\n\nHe boomed a 75-yard punt against Kansas State in 1950, the all-time top mark until 1971. His average of 50.6 yards per punt in 1951 versus Utah State still stands as a Shocker single-game record.\n\nIn 1952 he joined the “Shocker Century Club,” players who rushed for 100 yards or more in one game, carrying the ball 143 yards against New Mexico State and 120 against Drake.\n\nRomero, also on the WU track team, obliterated the men’s javelin record in 1952. It’s no wonder he was awarded “Mr. Athlete” his senior year.\n\nAfter college, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles and later signed with the Chicago Bears.\n\nHe also was an outstanding golfer, winning the city men’s golf championship in 1958.\n\nAn art major at WU, Romero created the sculpture “Classic” which in 1987 was placed at Willowbend Golf Club in northeast Wichita.\n\nSeptember 08, 2022:\n\nHere’s a bit of local history in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month!\n\nGoing back 95 years to Mexican Independence Day festivities in Wichita’s North End where Maria Roman was crowned queen.

This includes novels such as The Catcher in the Rye; Charlotte’s Web; I, Robot; and The Old Man and the Sea.See original post at: Facebook Twitter Instagram\n\nMarch 25, 2022:\n\nFlashback Friday to Patsy T. Mink’s pivotal work on Title IX legislation that opened up opportunities for women’s academic and athletic achievements by prohibiting sex discrimination in federally funded educational institutions.

After Mr. Beech’s untimely death in 1950, Olive Ann led the highly successful company to unprecedented growth through deliberate, planned policies of expansion and diversification, and by an early entry into the nation's space program. Mrs. Beech, who signed her business correspondence “O. A. Beech,” supported many cultural, economic and educational programs including those at Wichita State University.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. following his assassination. Classes were dismissed at 10 a.m. that day, and all campus activities were paused. The Chapel was filled to capacity - standing room only - so loud speakers were set up so those outside could pay their respects.

A challenge to the readers of Mathematics Magazine - “but if two and two and fifty make a million. . .” - came from a Seeger song. Dr. Bajaj solved it with style - so much so his solution, in the form of a letter to the magazine, was included in Seeger’s 1993 book. The two corresponded and later met backstage at a New York City concert in August 1993. Dr. Bajaj died December 30, 2021. He taught mathematics at WSU from 1968 to 2001.
