Lindbergh was embarking on the first transatlantic, solo, nonstop flight, successfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean and landing in Paris. The pilot landed in Paris less than 34 hours after taking off, despite many doubting that he would be able to make the full journey.\n\nLindbergh’s journey was crucial in changing public opinion about aviation and laid the groundwork for aviation development in the coming years. Despite studying engineering at college, Lindbergh always held a passion for air travel and was keen to become an aviator for the skill and adventure of flying. His attempt was financed by businessmen of St. Louis, which led to his aircraft being named the Spirit of St. Louis.\n\nAt the time, the press reported on Lindbergh’s flying attempt by referring to him as “the flying fool,” since his plane only had one engine and led many to believe this would stop him from reaching the other side of the ocean. He flew over Nova Scotia and Cape Cod, battling drowsiness, thick fog and sleet. He then flew over Ireland and England, heading for Paris as night began to fall.\n\nHis historic journey led to a tour in 49 states and President Calvin Coolidge gave Lindbergh the Medal of Honour. The pilot worked as an Aviation Consultant afterwards, continuing to serve the United States.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nBabe Ruth Hits a Record 60 Home Runs in a Single Season\n\nIf you’re wondering what happened in 1927 to make American sports fans shout, September 30, 1927 saw New York Yankees slugger Babe Ruth reach a new record in Major League Baseball, making the day one to remember. In a game against the Washington Senators in Yankee Stadium, New York, Babe Ruth smashed his 60th home run in one season, hitting a record that would be undefeated for the next 34 years.\n\nRuth just made the record in the last game of the season, when he launched a Tom Zachary pitch high into the bleachers of the right-field, taking a walk around the bases. The crowd roared, tore paper into confetti and threw their hats in the air. 1927 was a great year for baseball, particularly for the New York Yankees who bore their infamous lineup of power hitters, known as Murderer’s Row. The lineup included Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Tony Lazzerri and Bob Meusel.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nLaurel and Hardy Emerge On-Screen\n\nOn October 8, 1927, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy would star in their first film together, beginning their career as a comedy duo. Laurel and Hardy are regarded as one of the best on-screen comedy partnerships in history, and they would go on to make over 100 comedy films together. From the early Classical Hollywood era in American film to the mid-1940s, Laurel and Hardy would make audiences cry with laughter at their slapstick scenes.\n\nThe director of the 1927 silent, short film The Second Hundred Years, Hal Roach, recognised the pair’s potential as a comedy team despite the two already having well-established and separate film careers. Hardy was the pompous bully who led along the childlike, clumsy figure of Laurel. Putting Pants on Philip was also released in 1927, and was the official first film starring them in their new comedy partnership roles. While the comedy duo began in the silent film era, they would continue to make films together into the full feature-length movie era of Hollywood.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
