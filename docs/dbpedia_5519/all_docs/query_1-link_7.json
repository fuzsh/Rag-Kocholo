        "text": "24/01/1940\n\nJewish property in \"Generalgouvernement\" registered\n\nAs soon as an administrative regime was installed in the occupied provinces, the Jews were buffeted with decrees and ordinances meant, among other things, to oust them from economic life and dispossess them of their property. The process of expropriating and liquidating Jewish and Polish factories and businesses in the annexed areas began in September 1939, when this region was still under military rule. In January 1940, the Generalgouvernement regime issued an order placing under German custodianship any business whose owners were absentees or that were being inefficiently run. The rationale of inefficiency was a pretext for the liquidation of all the largest Jewish-owned factories and businesses. That month, the Jews were also required to register their property with local authorities. Uniformed and non-uniformed Germans, with and without formal powers, partook of the booty.\n\n25/01/1940\n\nJudenrat established in Lublin\n\nAfter the Germans occupied Lublin, the kehillah (the Jewish community council) was left intact and almost unchanged. Its sphere of activity was expanded to meet the Germans' demands and the Jewish population's new needs. The kehillah now had to deliver quotas of people for forced labor; hand over valuables, furniture, and other household items; cope with economic strictures imposed on individual Jews and the entire community; and make welfare arrangements for refugees and the needy, to name only a few examples. On January 25, 1940, the committee was officially recomposed as a 24-member Judenrat, although almost no changes in personnel were made. The Judenrat was headed by Engineer Henryk Bekker, but his deputy, Mark Alten, was the central personality. The Judenrat maintained the policies previously pursued by the committee, but its maneuvering ability diminished as German policy toward the Jews became tougher.\n\n26/01/1940\n\nWarsaw Judenrat fined after ethnic German beaten in street\n\nOn January 26, 1940, Adam Czerniakow, head of the Warsaw Ghetto Judenrat, was summoned to the police station and told that unless the community remitted 100,000 zlotys by the next day because of the beating of a Volksdeutsche (ethnic German), 100 Jews would be shot to death. Czerniakow described the event in his diary: \"I appealed to the Gestapo for an annulment of the fine, then, for permission to pay for it in installments, and finally for the release of the Community from the obligation of clearing the snow, which would let us save some money. Nothing came out of it. We must pay up and tomorrow morning at that. Under these circumstances I began a money collection in the Community. We must borrow 100,000 zloty and then get it back from the taxpayers\" (Diary, p. 50).\n\n04/03/1940\n\nKatyn massacre: Soviets execute tens of thousands of Polish officers\n\nAccording to data in the possession of the Polish government-in-exile, in early 1940 the Soviet Union held as many as 15,000 Polish prisoners of war, of whom 8,300 were officers. Taken prisoner by the Red Army in the second half of September 1939, they were interned in three camps: Kozelsk, Starobelsk, and Ostaszkow. Late that year, there were reports that the three camps had been disbanded. In 1941 and 1942, the Polish government-in-exile repeatedly asked the Soviet Union for information on the prisoners' fate, but to no avail.Â\n\nOn April 13, 1943, the Germans announced that mass graves had been discovered in the Katyn Forest, in their area of occupation, containing the bodies of thousands of Polish officers who had been shot in the back of the head. The Germans charged the Soviet authorities with the murder and appointed a multinational medical commission to probe the matter. In May 1943, the commission reported that the graves contained the bodies of 4,143 officers, of whom 2,914 were identified by documents in their uniforms. It was the commission's opinion that the men had been shot to death in the spring of 1940. The Soviet authorities flatly rejected the accusations of the German-appointed commission, arguing that the Germans themselves had committed the deed when they had occupied the area in July 1941.Â\n\nIn mid-April 1943, when the Polish government-in-exile demanded that an investigation of the Katyn killings be made by the International Red Cross, the Soviet Union reacted on April 25 by severing relations with the government-in-exile. This step would have far-reaching effects on relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. In November of that year, several months after the Red Army had liberated the area, the Soviet Union appointed a commission of inquiry of its own, which blamed the Germans for the Katyn murders. A United States congressional inquiry in the early 1950s found the NKVD (the Soviet secret police) responsible, and most Western historians now believe that the massacre was committed at the behest of the Soviet authorities. On March 8, 1989, the Polish government officially accused the NKVD of perpetrating the slaughter.Â\n\nIn 1990, in keeping with Mikhail Gorbachev's Glasnost policy, the Soviet Union released documents indicating its responsibility for the massacre at Katyn, and uncovered further mass graves in the area.\n\n09/04/1940\n\nGermany invades Denmark and Norway\n\nGerman forces invaded Denmark and Norway by sea, by land, and by aerial bombardment. Some 10,000 German soldiers hidden in vessels disguised as merchant ships occupied the coasts of Oslo, Bergen, Kristiansund, Trondheim, and Narvik. Paratroopers captured the airports of Oslo and Stavanger. Although the onslaught took the Norwegians by total surprise, they inflicted heavy losses on the German navy. In Denmark, the invader met with almost no resistance. Explaining its action, Germany argued that, according to documents in its possession, Britain and France were planning to occupy Norway against its will.Â\n\nThe German invasion forces in Norway were greeted by Vidkun Quisling, who declared himself prime minister of Norway. Upon this invasion, Hitler abandoned any hopes of striking a peace settlement with France and Great Britain.\n\n30/04/1940\n\nLodz Ghetto sealed\n\nThe Jews were resettled in the Lodz Ghetto in an action replete with brutality, looting, abuse, and murder. As they were led to the ghetto, snipers on rooftops opened fire on them to frighten them and expedite their departure. They fled to the ghetto in panic. The Lodz Ghetto was sealed on April 30. Some 164,000 Jews of Lodz were packed into its four square kilometers, of which only two and a half square kilometers were built. The congestion in the area that comprised the ghetto was seven times greater than it had been before the war. The ghetto area was carved into three sectors by two main streets that linked neighborhoods outside the ghetto. Congestion, hunger, cold, and poor sanitation led immediately to mass mortality.\n\n10/05/1940\n\nGermany invades Belgium and Netherlands\n\nThe Low Countries maintained their neutrality and hoped to avoid the fate that befell Norway and Denmark. However, at approx. 3:00 a.m. on May 10, 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg on the Belgian frontier and, on the pretext that Britain and France were planning to invade Germany via Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, invaded the Low Countries. Belgium presented Germany with a fiercely worded protest: \"All facts in the possession of the Belgian government indicate that the offensive was planned in advance.\" The Netherlands were attacked mainly by air. As negotiations for the surrender of the Dutch were under way, Hitler had Rotterdam bombed not for any military reason but to express the doctrine of intimidation: Terror impairs the will to resist. The bombardments leveled the center of Rotterdam and killed more than 800 people. The Germans' main intention in this invasion was to enhance their ability to threaten France.\n\n10/05/1940\n\nChamberlain resigns; Churchill Prime Minister of U.K.\n\nGreat Britain reached what may have been its nadir as Chamberlain resigned and Winston Churchill became the new prime minister. The Conservatives, the Labor Party, and the Liberals formed a new coalition. On May 22, an emergency law vested Churchill with wide-ranging powers to prepare the British economy and army for the war effort.\n\n26/05/1940\n\nAllies Evacuate Forces at Dunkirk\n\nOn May 24, Hitler, true to his original invasion plans but against the counsel of his officer corps, ordered his forces to turn toward Paris. The greatest concentration of Allied troopsâ380,000 soldiers in allâwas trapped by German forces at Dunkirk, in an area of 60 square miles.Â\n\nHitler waited two days before ordering his forces to attack the troops at Dunkirk. The evacuation of the trapped forces at Dunkirk began on May 26 in one of the most dramatic retreats in military history, as 861 ships and boats were mobilized and began to remove the trapped forces. Within a week, 224,585 British soldiers and 112,546 French and Belgian fighters were taken to safe shores; 40,000 French soldiers were left behind. 231 vessels were sunk, most by the Luftwaffe. The British left behind 11,000 machine guns, 1,200 cannons, 1,250 anti-aircraft and anti-tank pieces, and 75,000 motor vehicles.Â\n\nAt Britain's most difficult hour, Churchill addressed the House of Commons and proclaimed: \"We shall not flag or fail. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing ground, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills. We shall never surrender.\"\n\n14/06/1940\n\nGermany occupies Paris\n\nOn May 10, German armed forces began their offensive against France itself. The French had fewer troops than the Germans, and the French general Weygand termed their deployment \"a line of troops without depth or organization.\"Â\n\nArtillery shelling and air cover helped the German army to breach the ostensibly impermeable Maginot defense line. The Wehrmacht routed the French army within a few days. The government fled from Paris to Bordeaux; German forces marched into Paris. The next day, June 14, French military forces began to retreat from the Maginot Line. Columns of refugees attempting to escape the conquering German army were savaged by Luftwaffe bombing raids on the roads.Â\n\nFrance surrendered to Nazi Germany on June 22. The armistice agreement, tailored to Hitler's terms, was signed in the same railroad car in which Germany had surrendered to France 22 years previously. Hitler personally witnessed the humiliation of the French. For him and the Germans, it was sweet revenge. Marshal Petain blamed his country's stinging defeat on \"too few children, too few armaments, too few allies.\" Hitler now expected the conflict to end quickly: \"The British have lost the war, but they do not know it. Give them time and they will realize it.\"\n\n18/06/1940\n\nHitler presents Mussolini with Madagascar Plan\n\nMany antisemites had long toyed with the idea of deporting European Jewry to Madagascar and, briefly, in the summer of 1940, this scheme was the centerpiece of the Nazis' Jewish policy. In the spring of 1940, after the victory over France, Himmler proposed to Hitler that the Jews be banished to some African colony. However, the official who made this plan practical was Franz Rademacher, the expert on Jewish affairs in the German Foreign Office. Hitler disclosed the plan to Mussolini in June 1940 as part of its elaboration. The Madagascar Plan was shelved when, in the autumn of 1940, Germany failed to win its battle with Britain. The French also refused to cooperate with the plan. Essentially the plan was not feasible logistically.\n\n28/06/1940\n\nUSSR annexes Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina from Romania\n\nDuring the Soviet annexation of Northern Bukovina and Bessarabia in June of 1940, and the withdrawal of Romanian troops from that area, the Romanians attacked the local population, particularly the Jews, accusing them of being Communists and Soviet sympathizers, and blaming them for armed acts of provocation against Romanian soldiers. During this period, and without any connection to the Nazis, Romanian army units murdered hundreds of Jews: on 30 June 1940, a withdrawing Romanian battalion massacred some 200 Jews in Dorohoi, a town on the border with Bukovina. Infantry Battalion 16, withdrawing south from Northern Bukovina towards Falticeni, under the command of the antisemitic Maj. Valeriu Carp, brutally tortured and murdered dozens of Jews. Even when the withdrawal of the Romanian troops from Soviet-annexed territory was completed the massacres continued, assisted by further infantry battalions which actively participated.Â\n\nJewish soldiers serving in the Romanian army were also the victims of humiliation and torture by the Romanian soldiers, and a number of Jewish soldiers were murdered.Â\n\n10/07/1940\n\nVichy government formed\n\nThe German offensive in May-June 1940 breached the Maginot Line and prompted the French army to collapse. The armistice accord actually a surrender agreement was signed on June 22. This brought the Third Republic to an end, and on July 10, 1940, the French parliament in joint session dissolved the Republican regime and installed Marshal Henri Philippe PÃ©tain as head of the French state with full governing powers. The government established its seat at Vichy, in the southern part of the country. The results of the armistice were already evident by the end of June. France was partitioned into two sectors: a German-occupied zone (including the Atlantic coast, the English Channel front, and Paris); and an unoccupied zone in the southeast, administered by the Vichy government. The Vichy regime replaced the principles of the French Revolution LibertÃ©, Ã©galitÃ©, fraternitÃ© with new principles: Travail (work), Famille (family), and Patrie (fatherland). The Vichy regime, bolstered by nationalists who demanded a policy of \"returning France to the French,\" began systematically to circumscribe \"aliens\" influence and erode the rights of refugees and Jews. Vichy adopted a policy of courting Nazi Germany in order to extract more tolerable arrangements from the German authorities. The Vichy regime did much to help the Germans persecute the Jews and took anti-Jewish actions at its own initiative such as the Statut des Juifs â the Jewish Statutes (October 1940) and the establishment of institutions such as the Commissariat for Jewish Affairs (March 1941).\n\n19/07/1940\n\nU.K. turns down German peace offer for recognition of domination in Western Europe\n\nAfter his military advisers warned him about the difficulties that Operation Sea Lion (the plan for an amphibious landing on England, scheduled for September 15) would encounter, Hitler made Britain a non-belligerency offer. In a speech at the Reichstag, he offered Britain peace in return for British recognition of German dominion in Western Europe and the restoration of former German colonies:Â\n\nMr. Churchill, or perhaps others, for once believe me when I predict a great empire will be destroyed, an empire that it was never my intention to destroy or even to harm. I do realize that this struggle, if it continues, can end only with the complete annihilation of one or the other of the two adversaries. Mr. Churchill may believe this will be Germany. I know that it will be Britain.Â\n\nBritain rejected the offer.\n\n08/08/1940\n\n\"Battle of Britain\" begins\n\nIn his Adlertag - Eagle Day order, Hitler instructed his air force: \"Within a short period of time, you will wipe the British Air Force from the sky. Heil Hitler.\" Thus, the Luftwaffe (the German air force) attacked British air-force targets in a vast operation. With clear supremacy in the skies (2,700 warplanes against 700), Hitler hoped to bring Britain to its knees quickly from the air and thereby set the stage for a ground invasion of the island. When the Germans' attempt to defeat the British air force failed, the Luftwaffe changed its tactics and began to bombard cities, mainly to brutally intimidate the civilian population.Â\n\nChurchill had the following to say about Hitler: \"This wicked man, this monstrous product of former wrongs and shame, has now resolved to break our famous island race by a process of indiscriminate slaughter and destruction\".Â\n\nHitler's gambit failed; Operation Sea Lion was delayed again and again. Great Britain spent that summer in utter isolation, fighting not to rescue its air force, but to save the country itself.\n\n08/08/1940\n\nAntisemitic Racial Laws in Romania - \"The Jewish Statute\"\n\nThe Jewish Statute was passed in Romania on 8 August 1940, in an effort to forge stronger ties with Germany. The statute revoked most Romanian Jews' civil rights, and forbade mixed marriages. The Jews, accused of being communists who served the interests of the Soviet Union, were collectively blamed for the disasters that had befallen Romania and its citizens.\n\n17/08/1940\n\nGermany declares \"total blockade of Britain\"\n\nThe naval war in the waters around the British Isles was in full progress. The whole area had been mined. German planes attacked every vessel. Any neutral ship that entered these waters was liable to be destroyed.\n\n07/09/1940\n\nGerman \"blitz\" on England reaches climax\n\nThe Luftwaffe launched its most devastating attack on London, setting aside a force of 625 bombers for this purpose. By November 13, 150â200 tons of bombs were being dropped on London each day; the total came to approximately 1 million bombs. Hitler regarded these massive bombings as a response to the bombardment of Berlin by the Royal Air Force. The Germans continued to bomb the British capital until June 1941.\n\n27/09/1940\n\nGermany, Italy, and Japan conclude Tripartite Pact\n\nGermany, Italy, and Japan entered into a 10-year military and economic agreement. The stated \"prime purpose\" of the Tripartite Pact, signed in Berlin, was to establish and maintain a new order, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned. The pact expressed the formalization of the Axis partnership, and the unmistakable targets of the strengthened alliance were the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\n03/10/1940\n\nFrance enacts \"Jewish Statute\"\n\nVichy's first comprehensive anti-Jewish statute (Statut des Juifs), passed on October 3, 1940, defined a Jew as a person with three grandparents \"of the Jewish race,\" or with two Jewish grandparents if the spouse was also Jewish. In the latter provision, and in its explicit reference to race, the Vichy definition was both harsher and more inclusive than that stipulated by the Germans in the occupied zone of France and elsewhere. The law went on to provide the basis for drastically reducing the role of Jews in French society. It excluded Jews from top positions in the French civil service, the corps of officers and noncommissioned officers in the army, and professions that helped shape public opinion teaching, the press, radio, cinema, and theater. Jews could hold menial public-service positions, provided they had served in the armed forces between 1914 and 1918, or had distinguished themselves in the campaign of 1939â1940. The statute also stated that a quota system would be devised to limit the presence of Jews in the liberal professions (law, medicine, etc.). Formulated purely on French initiative, the law was hastily prepared in the Justice Ministry of Raphael Alibert, a militant antisemite, a friend of the monarchist and fascist-leaning Action FranÃ§aise movement, and the formulator of the Vichy motto \"Travail, Famille, Patrie\" (\"Work, Family, Fatherland\").Â\n\nVichy's efforts to apply this statute effectively and toughen some of its provisions led to a second Statut des Juifs, on June 2, 1941. It emerged from Xavier Vallat's Commissariat General aux Questions Juives (Commissariat for Jewish Affairs; CGQJ), and was carefully drafted in a series of cabinet meetings and consultations with Justice Minister Joseph Barthelemy. After tightening the definition of Jewishness and tinkering with the provisions for the purging of Jews from public posts, the law opened the way for a massive removal of Jews from the liberal professions, commerce, and industry. Only a handful of well-established French Jews could benefit from the exemptions provided by the statute. Even Jewish prisoners of war, if returned from captivity, faced the rigors of the anti-Jewish law.Â\n\nKeenly attentive to detail, Vallat was determined to close every loophole through which Jews might escape the jurisdiction of the anti-Jewish program. Never fully satisfied with the handiwork of the CGQJ, the coordinator of the antisemitic legislation elaborated a new Statut des Juifs over the fall and winter of 1941. Although this law never saw the light of day, its successive drafts point to a continuing effort to tighten the definition and ease the task of legal definition as, for example, in the case of the children of foreigners whose grandparents' racial makeup could not be determined. Mean-spirited and beset with contradictions on the matter of race and religion, the statutory core of the Vichy regime's policy toward the Jews reflected its legalistic approach toward, and animus against, all Jews, whether or not they were French citizens.\n\n07/10/1940\n\nRomania Consents to German Army Entry\n\nIn October 1940, 12 German army divisions entered Romanian territory. They were presented by Hitler not as an army of occupation, but rather as an extension of the German military mission that had been dispatched to Romania one month earlier. Hitler's desire to maintain a facade of Romanian independence derived from his awareness of the country's key position in the Balkans and the undesirable effect that its occupation would have on Germany's allies in the region, the Italians and the Soviets.Â\n\nSome six weeks later, Romania joined the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Axis.Â\n\n22/10/1940\n\nJewish businesses in occupied Netherlands registered\n\nAfter the Dutch civil service was purged of Jews, an order issued on October 22 stipulated the registration of businesses owned or influenced by Jews. Registration was the first step toward the \"Aryanization\" of Jewish property. In all, 20,690 businesses were recorded. The registration campaign proved that the Jews played a relatively small role in the Dutch economy and that most of their businesses were small.\n\n28/10/1940\n\nRegistration of Jewish property in Belgium\n\nEconomic measures against the Jews were introduced in late 1940. No such measures had been taken in the first few months of the occupation, and for a while it even seemed that the Jews might be allowed to pursue a reasonable level of economic activity. Some Jews who had fled to France (mainly to the southern zone) when Belgium was occupied actually returned to Belgium and resumed their economic activities there, especially in the diamond industry in Antwerp. In November 1940, however, Hermann Goering ordered the Belgian economy to be \"Aryanized,\" thus prompting interest by various German enterprises in acquiring Jewish businesses. In practice, \"Aryanization\" was launched only in late 1941, its \"legal\" basis being decrees of October 28, 1940, and May 21, 1941. Aryanization gathered momentum in March and April 1942, when the systematic liquidation of Jewish businesses in the textile, leather, and diamond industries was set in motion. However, the Aryanization process was never completed; according to a comprehensive survey conducted by the Germans, the large Jewish enterprises stayed in existence and kept their assets intact. The situation in Jewish-owned real estate was similar.Â\n\nSeveral economic decrees were enacted in 1942: confiscation of property owned by German Jews (April 22 and August 1); severe restrictions on the practice of medicine (June 1); and, forbidding the sale of real estate without special permission (September 29) during the period when Jews were being deported to camps.\n\n28/10/1940\n\nItaly invades Greece\n\nItaly claimed that Greece had inspired attacks on its forces along the Greek-Albanian frontier, Albania having been invaded by Italy in April 1939. By now, Italy had massed a force of 162,000 men along the border. Greece had only 75,000 men to counter an invasion on this front.\n\n16/11/1940\n\nWarsaw Ghetto sealed\n\nThe Jewish ghetto, located in the heart of the Jewish quarter in northern Warsaw, was sealed. Until the last day, the Jews did not know if the ghetto was going to be sealed. On November 16, the ghetto was closed and thousands of Jews were dispossessed of belongings that they had left on the other side. According to the Germans' statistics, 30 percent of the city population was crammed into the 2.4 percent of its area that was reserved for the ghetto, and housing in the ghetto was occupied at seven persons per room. The ghetto had severely inadequate sanitary provisions, no greenery, and no trees. This was the largest of the Jewish ghettos; some 330,000 people were placed there in its first stage; later on, another 120,000 Jews were sent there.\n\n01/12/1940\n\n\"Oneg Shabbat\" clandestine archives established\n\nWithin a few months of the beginning of the war, Dr. Emanuel Ringelblum and a group of friends began to gather testimonies and descriptions of events of Jews who had come to the capital from peripheral towns. When the Jews were interned in the Warsaw Ghetto, a new phase in the work of the archives began. Ringelblum, aware that the events befalling the Jews under the occupation regime were unprecedented, believed it essential to enable future historians to obtain painstakingly recorded material. The team did not settle for gathering material and taking notes on events; it also encouraged writers and laypersons to write about, and analyze, the ghetto realities. Among the small circle of friends who established and managed the collection known as the \"Oneg Shabbat\" archives, only one member survived.\n\n21/01/1941\n\nThe Revolt of the Iron Guard; Anti-Jewish Riots in Romania\n\nOn 21-23 January, the Iron Guard rose in revolt and tried to seize power in the country. The revolt was accompanied by anti-Jewish riots in Bucharest. Members of the Iron Guard, together with bands of thugs, rioters from the suburbs and gypsies attacked Jewish neighborhoods, murdered 127 Jews and destroyed and looted houses and shops. Within a few days, the revolt was crushed by the army. In order to garner Romanian support for Germany in the upcoming invasion of the Soviet Union, Hitler came out in support of Ion Antonescu and his army in putting down the revolt.\n\n05/02/1941\n\nAnti-Jewish Legislation in Romania, with German support\n\nIn the months between the repression of the \"Legionary Rebellion\" at the end of January and the advent of the war against the Soviet Union, a string of anti-Jewish laws were passed in Romania. The German Foreign Ministry sent a special advisor on \"Jewish affairs\" to Romania - Gustav Richter, who was an aide to Adolf Eichmann. His official function was \"to advise the Romanian government on legislation against the Jews, similar to the kind of laws that have been enacted in Germany.\" On 5 February, the Law for the Protection of the State was passed, which provided that for the same offense, Jews would be given double the punishment meted out to Christians. On 27 March, a further law was passed permitting the confiscation of Jewish-owned property, resulting in the confiscation of over 40,000 Jewish houses and apartments. On 15 May, Jews were stripped of the last vestiges of legal protection, and were drafted for forced labor.\n\n25/02/1941\n\nAnti-Nazi strike in Amsterdam\n\nThe arrest and deportation of several hundred Jews to Buchenwald in February 1941 horrified the inhabitants of Amsterdam. Communist Party activists declared a strike and, in their manifesto, demanded an enhancement of social benefits and the release of the Jewish prisoners. The strike spread rapidly as all segments of the population, irrespective of their adherence to the Communist platform, shut down all means of transport, large enterprises, and public services. By the next day, the strike spread to the towns around Amsterdam. The Germans, although surprised by the extent of the strike, countered it with massive forces and stamped it out by its third day. The failure of the strike prompted the Germans to toughen their anti-Jewish policies.\n\n01/03/1941\n\nConstruction of Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp begins\n\nIn March 1941, Himmler issued orders for the construction of a second wing at the Auschwitz camp, a much larger facility three kilometers away from the original camp known as Auschwitz I. The new division would be called Auschwitz II-Birkenau. To make room for the new camp, 2,000 residents of several Polish villages, including Brzezinka, known in German as Birkenau, were evicted from their homes. The villagers' homes were razed and a vast area of 40 square kilometers was declared off-limits.Â\n\nIntensive construction of barracks and other facilities at Auschwitz II began in October 1941. In its final stage, Auschwitz II was composed of nine sub-units, separated from each other by electrified barbed-wire fences.Â\n\nAuschwitz II (Birkenau) was the most populous of the concentration camps at Auschwitz, and the most brutal and inhuman in its conditions. Most of its prisoners were Jews, followed by Poles, Germans and Gypsies. It was Auschwitz II that became the extermination center containing all gas chambers and crematoria, except for the first which had been built in Auschwitz I.\n\n11/03/1941\n\nU.S. Congress passes Lend-Lease Act\n\nAfter two months of protracted discussions and in defiance of isolationists' opposition, Congress passed the Lend-Lease Act. Churchill's entreaty from London \"Give us the tools and we will finish the job\" also had an influence.Â\n\nThe Lend-Lease agreement authorized the president to lend and lease military equipment to the anti-Axis powers for direct or indirect payment. The transfer of mammoth sums of money ($50 billion by the end of the war) and important war material effectively terminated the American neutrality policy.Â\n\nRoosevelt responded to the passage of the Act by proclaiming: \"This decision is the end of any attempt at appeasement in our land; the end of urging us to get along with the dictators; the end of compromise with tyranny and the forces of oppression.\"\n\n06/04/1941\n\nGermany invades Yugoslavia and Greece\n\nOn April 6, 1941, Hitler's forces, in alliance with the Hungarians and the Bulgarians, invaded Yugoslavia and Greece. Hitler intervened in the war in this fashion to secure his southern flank in anticipation of the imminent invasion of the Soviet Union.Â\n\nYugoslavia Yugoslavia refrained from joining the Axis until March 25, 1941, when it made this move under duress. Two days later, a pro-Western military coup took place in Belgrade and Yugoslavia's alliance with the Axis was aborted. The invasion of Yugoslavia by German, Hungarian and Bulgarian forces began a week and a half later (April 6), and the Yugoslav army lay down its arms on April 18.Â\n\nGreece The Prime Minister of Greece, General Ioannis Metaxas, attempted to maintain neutrality until the war began. On October 28, 1940, however, the Italians invaded his country. Metaxas died in January 1941. When the Germans invaded Greece on April 6, 1941, the Greek army, despite valiant resistance aided by a small British force, could not arrest the onslaught. On April 18, 1941, Greek Prime Minister Alexandros Koryzis committed suicide, the Greek army and king fled to Crete, and the Germans closed in on Athens. Most of the British forces were evacuated.\n\n09/04/1941\n\nGermany occupies Salonika\n\nOn April 9, 1941, the Germans occupied Salonika, which had a Jewish population of 50,000. Within a week, the members of the Jewish community council were arrested, Jews' dwellings were expropriated, and the Jewish hospital was requisitioned for the use of the Wehrmacht. Three Jewish newspapers in French and Ladino were shut down and replaced with antisemitic and collaborationist papers. In April-May 1941, Einsatzstab Rosenberg (Rosenberg Operational Staff), aided by units of the Wehrmacht, systematically looted 500-year-old literary and cultural treasures in dozens of private and public libraries and synagogues in this city. Most of the booty was taken to Frankfurt, where the Nazis were establishing a library for the study of Judaism.\n\n24/04/1941\n\nLublin Ghetto closed\n\nThe ghetto in Lublin was established in late March 1941 and more than 34,000 Jews were gathered there. Approximately 10000 Jews were evicted from the city as part of ghettoization. From April 24 on, Jews were not allowed to leave the ghetto, except for members of labor groups and holders of special permits.\n\n10/05/1941\n\nRudolf Hess parachutes into Duke of Hamilton's estate\n\nRudolf Hess was the deputy Fuehrer, Hitler's No. 2 man. Nevertheless, Hess's sense of having been removed from centers of policymaking power, coupled with his knowledge of the planned attack on the Soviet Union, evidently joined with other factors to prompt his bold decision to fly to England. Hess set out on his mission in early May 1941, hoping that Britain would be willing to make peace with Germany after the impending invasion of the USSR. To this day, it is not clear whether the initiative for the flight was purely Hess's or whether it was inspired, albeit indirectly, by Hitler. In either case, Hitler repudiated Hess's mission as soon as its failure became known. Hess was arrested when he landed in England and was held there until the end of the war. After the war, he was prosecuted along with the other surviving leaders of the Nazi regime at the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, and was held in Spandau prison after being found guilty. He committed suicide there in 1987.\n\n06/06/1941\n\n\"Commissar Order\"\n\nAbout two weeks before the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht high command (OKW) issued the Kommissarbefehl, the \"Commissar Order.\" The order was consistent with the Nazis' ideological perception of the invasion of the USSR as an action meant to liquidate Bolshevism by physically eliminating all bearers of the idea and the Soviet State apparatus. Thus, in contravention of international law, the order stipulated:Â\n\n...If captured during combat or while offering resistance, [these commissars] must on principle be shot immediately.... As for the others, the following rules shall apply: Even if they are only suspected of resistance, sabotage, or instigation thereto... protection granted to prisoners of war... will not apply to them. After having been segregated they are to be liquidated.Â\n\nThe Commissar Order, signed by General Walter Warlimont and approved by the OKW Chief of Staff, General Wilhelm Keitel, directly implicated the German army in involvement in, and responsibility for, war crimes in the occupied territories. In the summer of 1941, Keitel had all copies of the Commissar Order destroyed, in order to remove evidence of the army's crimes.\n\n22/06/1941\n\n\"Operation Barbarossa\"\n\nThe largest military offensive in history began at 3:00 a.m. on June 22, 1941. The armed forces of Germany and its allies attacked the Soviet Union along a frontier 1,800 miles long. Stalin disregarded all forewarnings about the impending onslaught, leaving his army formations totally unprepared. The war was meant to fulfill Hitler's Lebensraum plans. Germany's goal was not only to defeat the Red Army, but also to destroy it and the Soviet Union in a mammoth and ruthless tide of annihilation. Hitler's strategy was simple: a blitzkrieg that would wipe out large Red Army formations quickly, by denying them the possibility of retreat or assistance from other units. To accomplish this, the Germans prepared a military offensive on an unprecedented scale: More than 3 million fighting men, 600,000 motor vehicles, 750,000 horses, 3,580 tanks, and 1,830 aircraft took part in the invasion. Hitler hoped to attain a rapid victory and to reach the Ural Mountains before the winter. German forces advanced toward the immediate targets: Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev. The Wehrmacht attained prodigious success in the first few weeks, occupying a strip hundreds of kilometers deep. Masses of Soviet soldiers were killed or taken prisoner, and the German military juggernaut, treating the occupied civilian population with a brutality never before witnessed, seemed unstoppable.\n\n23/06/1941\n\nEinsatzgruppen begin killings in the USSR\n\nIn the Spring of 1941 four Einsatzgruppen were organised who together numbered some 3000 people. They were mobile units of the SD and the Security Police who were disposed after the combat forces to take control of the areas that the army had occupied. Each unit advanced in a predetermined direction toward a pre-assigned sector. The Einstazgruppen engaged in \"special tasks\", ie: mass murder on an unprecedented scale.Their orders were spelled out in a letter given to them on July 2 by Heydrich:Â\n\nThe following is the gist of the highly important orders that I have issued to the Einsatzkommandos... Executions: The following categories are to be executed: Comintern officials (as well as all professional Communist politicians); party officials of all levels; and members of the central, provincial, and district committees; people's commissars; Jews in the party and state apparatus; and other extremist elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, etc.).Â\n\nIn Nazi eyes, all Jews were Bolsheviks, extremists, and dangerous. Hence practically speaking, the order encompassed all Jews.Â\n\nWe know that these Einsatzgruppen were helped by other units who participated in the murder, such as other SS units, the Wermacht, and other local militias.Â\n\nBy the Spring of 1943, when the Germans began their retreat from Soviet Territory, the Einsatzgruppen had murdered approximately 1.25 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of other Soviet nationals including Prisoners of War.\n\n24/06/1941\n\nGermans occupy Vilna; in July, killings begin at Ponary, south of Vilna\n\nOn June 24, 1941, two days after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans occupied Vilna. In July, the Germans began taking Jewish victims by foot, in motor vehicles, and by train to Ponary, where they were led in groups of hundreds and thousands to enormous pits. The victims were marched through a circular entrance at the construction site of a fuel depot. They could not see where they were being taken, because their upper garments were pulled over their heads as they marched. Having reached the pits, they were shot by SS men and German police, with collaboration from Lithuanians.\n\n28/06/1941\n\nRomanian soldiers kill 14,000 Jews in Iasi\n\nOn the evening of June 28, Romanian and German soldiers, members of the Romanian Special Intelligence Service, police, and masses of residents participated in an assault on the Jews of this town. Thousands were murdered in their homes and in the streets; additional thousands were arrested by patrols of Romanian and German soldiers and taken to police headquarters. In their homes, Christians posted crosses, icons, and inscriptions such as \"Here live Christians, not Jewboys.\" The next day, \"Black Sunday,\" Romanian soldiers shot thousands of Jews who had been interned in the police headquarters yard. The 4,330 survivors, and many Jews who had been rounded up from all parts of town, were packed into freight cars and vans; 2,650 of them died of suffocation or thirst, and others lost their sanity. On August 30, the 980 Jews who survived the torture were brought back to Iasi.Â\n\n30/06/1941\n\nGermany occupies Lvov; 4,000 Jews killed by July 3\n\nThe Germans occupied the city on June 30. Members of Einsatzgruppe C, German soldiers, and Ukrainian nationalists and rabble began to murder Jews that very day. The Germans and the Ukrainians spread rumors implicating the Jews in killing Ukrainian political prisoners whose bodies had been found in the cellars of the Soviet political police station. In the four days of rioting that ensued, the Ukrainian rabble ran wild assaulting, abusing, torturing, and murdering Jews, and raping Jewish women as German soldiers took pictures. By July 3, 1941, 4,000 Jews had been murdered.\n\n30/06/1941\n\nEinsatzkommando 4a and local Ukrainians kill 300 Jews in Lutsk\n\nThe Germans entered Lutsk on June 25. The next day, Ukrainians perpetrated a pogrom including looting, beatings, and murdered several Jews. On June 27, a vanguard unit of an Einsatzkommando reached the town. Visiting the local prison, the unit discovered the corpses of numerous inmates, including Ukrainians whom the Soviets had murdered before their retreat. The German military administration and Ukrainian nationalist leaders accused the Jews of the murders, and 300 Jews were rounded up and executed on June 30 in reprisal. On July, 2, Jewish men were summoned for work, about 2000 of them were taken to the Lubart Fortress and murdered. German soldiers from rearguard units stationed in the city participated in the murder.\n\n01/07/1941\n\nRomanian units and Einsatzgruppe D shoot 160,000 Jews in Bessarabia between July 1 and August 31\n\nIon Antonescu, dictator of Romania, issued a secret order: Before the Germans and Romanians invaded the Soviet Union, all Jews in Bessarabian villages were to be murdered on the spot; Jews in the towns removed to ghettos; and anyone who served the Soviets during the year of Soviet rule was to be executed after being found guilty. A special unit was established as a spin-off of the Security Police, patterned after the Einsatzgruppen units, and placed under the command of Deputy Premier Mihai Antonescu. The unit was assisted by the Romanian army, and both of these agencies collaborated with the corresponding German entities. Some 150,000-200,000 Jews were murdered in July-August, mostly by Romanians.\n\n04/07/1941\n\nVilna Judenrat established\n\nThe Germans occupied Vilna on June 24. Within a few days, the Germans and the Lithuanians issued orders forcing Jews to wear the Jewish Badge, forbidding them to walk on sidewalks and enter certain locations, stipulating a nighttime curfew, and limiting their food purchases. On July 4, the Jews were ordered to establish a Judenrat. Concurrently, the Germans, assisted by Lithuanian volunteers, began to abduct Jews some 5,000 in July from the streets and their homes, to take them to Ponary, and to murder them. The Jews of Vilna and their relatives knew nothing whatsoever about the fate of their loved ones.\n\n08/07/1941\n\nMurder of the Jews of Bukovina and Bessarabia begins\n\nFollowing the invasion of the USSR in June 1941, Germany and Romania occupied Bessarabia and northern Bukovina. Romanian leaders Marshal Ion Antonescu and Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu and other government members gave the Romanian army and gendarmerie secret orders to murder all the Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia under the code name \"Cleansing of the Ground\" (Curatirea Terenului).Â\n\nOn the eve of the war, a special killing unit was created from the Security Services, commanded by the deputy Prime Minister, Mihai Antonescu, and called the Esalon Special (Special Echelon). Together with the German army and Einsatzgruppe D, they massacred about 150,000 to 160,000 Jews in Bukovina and Bessarabia during July and August 1941.Â\n\nIn a government meeting on 8 July, Mihai Antonescu said:Â\n\n\"Be merciless. Saccharine and foggy humanitarianism has no place here... I am all for the forced migration of the entire Jewish element of Bessarabia and Bukovina, which must be dumped across the border... If necessary shoot your machine guns... I couldnÂ´t care less if history will recall us as barbarians... I take formal responsibility and tell you there is no law.\"Â\n\nThe Jews who had survived the massacres were deported in the direction of the Dniester River. They were forced to march hundreds of kilometers in the summer heat, hungry, sick and exhausted. Anyone falling behind was shot by the Romanian escorts. After some six weeks in temporary camps, the deportation continued towards Transnistria. The establishment of ghettos and camps in the Transnistria region began in August 1941, and the remaining Jews were incarcerated there. Some 195,000 Jews were deported to these camps, of whom approximately 145,000 perished. Additionally, some 180,000 Ukrainian Jews who had lived in this region previously were murdered by the Romanians.Â\n\n20/07/1941\n\nMinsk Ghetto established\n\nThe order to establish the ghetto in Minsk 34 streets and alleys plus the Jewish cemetery was given on July 20, 1941. Jews were brought to the ghetto from Slutzk, Dzerzhinsk, Cherven, and other localities in the vicinity of Minsk. Jewish men and women who had married non-Jews were also taken to the ghetto, as were their children. In all, the ghetto population climbed to 100,000.\n\n24/07/1941\n\nKishinev Ghetto established; 10,000 Jews already dead since the invasion\n\nThe Jews of Kishinev were annihilated in several phases. When Romanian and German units entered the town, many Jews were slaughtered in the streets and in their homes. Their exact number is not known, but the researcher Matatias Carp estimates it at some 10,000. After the ghetto was established, 2,000 Jews were systematically murdered by a unit comprised of men from Einsatzkommandos 11a from Einsatzgruppen D. This unit selected for murder members of the liberal professions (doctors, lawyers, engineers) and Jewish intellectuals. In some of these executions, Romanian soldiers and police participated alongside the Einsatzkommando men as an auxiliary force. The 11,000 Jews who survived the murder spree were concentrated in the ghetto that was established on July 24, 1941, by order of the Romanian governor of the district and the German commander of the Einsatzkommando. The Jews in the ghetto were dispossessed, tortured, and mobilized for forced labor. Many were executed and their bodies were not removed, thereby angering the Germans.\n\n25/07/1941\n\nPogrom in Lvov\n\nOn July 25-27, Ukrainians under German patronage rioted against the Jews again. The pogroms were organized by Ukrainian nationalist circles with German encouragement. Among the Jews of Lvov, rumors had spread that the Ukrainians were planning a pogrom. As July 25 approached, an unusual bustle was noticed among the Ukrainian police in the city. Jews tried not to step outside. Early in the morning of July 25, groups of peasants from nearby villages began to flow into Lvov. They assembled on the premises of police stations, set out from there to the street accompanied by Ukrainian policemen, and assaulted any Jew whom they encountered with clubs, knives, and axes. Groups of Jews were taken to the Jewish cemetery and murdered brutally. A roundup of Jews from their homes, coupled with looting, began in the afternoon. The proportion of Jewish intellectuals was high. Ukrainian police circulated in groups of five and consulted prepared lists. Some 2,000 people were murdered in approximately three days. The pogrom was known as the \"Petliura Days,\" in commemoration of Simon (Semyon) Petliura, the Ukrainian premier who had organized massive pogroms against Jews in 1919 and was murdered in exile by a Jew in 1926.\n\n31/07/1941\n\nGoering orders Heydrich to prepare a plan for the \"Final Solution of Jewish Problem.\"\n\nHermann Goering instructed Reinhard Heydrich to compose and submit \"all the necessary preparations with regard to organizational, practical and financial aspects for an overall solution ( Gesamtlosung) of the \"Jewish question\" in the German sphere of influence in Europe\". Heydrich himself seems to have initiated this commission. To discharge this duty, Heydrich received cooperation from all Reich ministries and convened the Wannsee Conference, where Heydrich summoned the directors of the main government agencies that would have to cooperate for the plan to succeed. Many researchers consider Goering's instruction the first important document that set the wheels of the \"Final Solution\" in motion.\n\n01/08/1941\n\n50,000 Jews confined in Bialystok Ghetto\n\nThe Germans reoccupied Bialystok on July 27, 1941. Two days later, the military commander of the town summoned the Chief Rabbi of the city, Dr. Gedaliah Rosenmann, and the head of the Jewish community council, Efraim Barasz, and ordered them to establish a Judenrat. On August 1, 50,000 Jews were confined in the ghetto area, a newly developed non-Jewish neighborhood that was split into two parts, east and west, divided by the Biala River. There were 2 gates in the ghetto, and a third gate was eventually added. The Judenrat had its offices at 32 Kupiecka, and most of the departmental offices, dealing with the ghetto's day-to-day affairs, were housed there as well.\n\n04/08/1941\n\nKovno Ghetto sealed\n\nThe Jews of Kovno who survived the violent rampage that accompanied the occupation of this town on June 24 were given a month to move to two ghetto districts in Slobodka, on either side of the main street the \"large ghetto\" and \"small ghetto.\" The area was encircled with barbed wire and heavily guarded, including German soldiers stationed at the gates. Some 29,760 Jews lived in the sealed ghetto before mass murder operations began in August.\n\n05/08/1941\n\nMurders in Pinsk; 10,000 Jews killed in three days\n\nThe first spate of murders in Pinsk began on August 5, 1941. The Germans occupied Pinsk on July 4; 16 Jews were abducted and murdered the next day. In the second half of July, a 28-member Judenrat, headed by David Alper, the principal of the Tarbut High School, was established. On August 5, some 8,000 men were rounded up on the pretext of having to repair a railroad track; among them were 20 members of the Judenrat, including the chairman. All were taken to pits outside the city and murdered. On August 7, another 2,500-3,000 males (elderly, adults, and boys) were rounded up and subjected to the same fate.\n\n27/08/1941\n\nMassacre at Kamenets-Podolsk\n\nIn July, Kamenets-Podolsk was occupied by the Hungarian forces that fought alongside Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union. Beginning in mid-July, some 14,000 Jews, residents but not citizens of Hungary, were deported to Korosmezo near the Polish border. From there, they were sent to Kolomija near Kamenets-Podolsk, and turned over to the SS. By August 10, at least 14,000 Jews had been handed over in this fashion. On August 25, these Jews' fate was sealed in a meeting at the headquarters of the commander of the Wehrmacht logistics division at Vinnitsa. At this meeting, SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Friedrich Jeckeln promised to finish murdering, by September, the Jews whom the Hungarians had turned over. The Aktion took place on August 27-28, and according to Jeckeln's report (Operational Report USSR No. 80), 23,600 persons were murderedâ14,000-18,000 from Hungary and the rest local. The Hungarians had also played an active role in the murder.\n\n01/09/1941\n\nNazi \"Euthanasia Program\" officially terminated\n\nGrowing criticism of the \"euthanasia\" operation such as a sermon given by Clemens Galen, the Catholic Bishop of Muenster on August 3, 1941 prompted Hitler to terminate the operation officially. Practically, however, it continued under improved camouflage until the end of the war. By September 1, 1941, when the operation was officially terminated, 70,273 people had been \"purged,\" according to T4 figures; by the end of 1941, T4 reported that 93,521 beds had been made available for other purposes.\n\n03/09/1941\n\nFirst experimental gassings at Auschwitz\n\nOn September 3, the first pilot group of people 600 Soviet prisoners of war and 250 other prisoners, selected among those who had fallen ill was put to death at Auschwitz by means of Zyklon B gas. The initial attempts failed; the intended victims did not die as had been planned. They had to be taken out and made to wait until the technical flaws were corrected. Then, they were led back to the cells and killed in accordance with the plan.\n\n05/09/1941\n\nTwo ghettos established and sealed in Vilna\n\nOn September 3-5, the area that had been cleansed of Jews in the \"Great Provocation\" Aktion (in which the Germans faked a gunfire attack by Jews on German soldiers) was fenced off, and 8,000 Jews of this city were murdered in \"retribution.\" Two ghettos were established there: Ghetto No. 1 and Ghetto No. 2, separated by Deutsche Street. On September 6, all the Jews of Vilna were banished to the ghettos 30,000 to Ghetto No. 1, and 11,000 to Ghetto No. 2. About 6,000 were taken to Ponary and murdered there. The Germans appointed Judenraete in both ghettos the next day.\n\n08/09/1941\n\nSiege of Leningrad\n\nThe German army advanced so rapidly toward Leningrad, the second-most important city in Russia, that by August 30, 1941, the last of the railroad tracks that led to the town had been cut. Several days later, German tank units completed their stranglehold on the town. German troops under Field Marshal Ritter von Leeb from the southwest, and Finnish Marshal Mannerheim's army from the northwest, rushed to the city outskirts quickly and began to shell the city fiercely. However, the Nazis' hopes of a swift occupation of Leningrad faded when Marshal Zhukov was placed in charge of organizing the town's defense. He turned the city into a maze of strongholds and firing positions.\n\n12/09/1941\n\nHitler: \"Leningrad will be starved into submission\"\n\nThe last overland connections with the city were severed in early September. Leningrad and its population of 3 million were under siege, with enough food for one month. A trickle of supplies was hauled across Lake Ladoga. Terrible hunger set in. The German forces encamped on the outskirts of town for a protracted siege. Hitler forbade his commanders to accept a surrender. Leningrad and its population, Hitler ordered, would be bombed and shelled to death. Although Hitler's plan was not carried out in full, by the time the siege was lifted and Leningrad liberated in January 1944, an estimated million inhabitants had died of severe hardship and horrifying starvation.\n\n15/09/1941\n\n150,000 Jews deported to Transnistria; 90,000 perish\n\nTransnistria is a region in the western Ukraine, across the Dniestr River from Romania, that Hitler handed to Romania as a reward for its participation in the war against the Soviet Union. After it was occupied, Transnistria became a concentration ground for the Jews of Bessarabia, Bukovina, and northern Moldavia, whom the Romanian authorities deported on the direct order of Ion Antonescu. The deportations began on September 15, 1941, and continued on-and-off until the autumn of 1942; September 15 is the official date of the deportation of the Jews of Bessarabia. Most of the deportations to Transnistria took place on foot, via four transit points: Atachi (the principal transit point), Cosauti, Rezina, and Tiraspol. In all, an estimated 150,000 persons were deported; German sources speak of 185,000. In addition to massacres carried out by Romanians, Jews were murdered in the camps of Bogdanovka, Akhmechetka and Domankevk.Â\n\nThe Romanian army and gendarmerie also participated in the murder of some 200,000 Jews from Ukraine.Â\n\nIn October, the Jews of southern Bukovina were also deported to Transnistria. Ion Antonescu stated that Bessarabia would be \"Judenrein\" and that in Bukovina, the Jewish population of 90,000 would be reduced to the 10,000 Jews who were considered indispensable to the region's economy.\n\n19/09/1941\n\nZhitomir Ghetto liquidated; 10,000 murdered\n\nZhitomir was a district capital in the Soviet Ukraine. When the Germans occupied the town on July 9, 1941, they found 10,000 Jews there. In July and August of 1941, nearly 5,000 Jews were murdered in groups under various pretexts, and the remaining 5,000 were ghettoized. Early in the morning of September 19, the ghetto was surrounded by German and Ukrainian police. The 5,000 Jews in the ghetto were led to pits and murdered.\n\n19/09/1941\n\nGermans in Kiev\n\nStalin instructed Marshal Semyon Budenny to hold Kiev at any price, but it was too late; German tanks had placed the Ukrainian capital in a stranglehold. Stalin addressed his soldiers over the radio, urging them to continue holding the town and to fight to the death. Nevertheless, the Wehrmacht occupied Kiev, killing 350,000 Soviet soldiers and taking 600,000 prisoner. The Soviet losses included 3,718 artillery pieces, 884 armored vehicles, and five armies.\n\n19/09/1941\n\nGerman Jews to wear Jewish badge in public\n\nIn September 1941, Jews in the Third Reich areas were ordered to wear a yellow badge, referred to as a \"Jewish star\" (Judenstern). According to the order, issued two years after a similar requirement was introduced among Polish Jews, all Jews aged 6 or over were to wear, on the left side of their chest, a fist-sized yellow six-point star bearing the inscription \"Jude.\" The Judenstern order in the Reich and the areas annexed to it, as in every other location, was but one of a series of anti-Jewish decrees, each representing a general escalation in severity of the Jewish policy applied.Â\n\nAt this stage (September 1941), the marking of the Jews in Germany was carried out in preparation for the \"Final Solution.\" Persons not employed in enterprises of importance to the state economy were placed under restrictions of movement that month, and were sent to the East over the next few months.\n\n29/09/1941\n\n33,771 Kiev Jews killed at Babi Yar\n\nOn September 28, the Germans posted notices in Kiev ordering the Jews to report the next day at 8:00 a.m. to the corner of Melnik and Dekhtyarev streets for relocation to other localities. The Germans expected 6,000 Jews to comply; instead, 30,000 reached the assembly point. The Germans herded the masses down Melnik Street toward the Jewish cemetery at the edge of the city and the nearby ravine of Babi Yar. The interior of the ravine was fenced with barbed wire and guarded by police, soldiers of the Waffen-SS, and Ukrainian police. As they approached the vale of death, the victims were forced to hand over their valuables, undress, and advance in ranks of 10 toward a terrace at the edge of the valley. When they reached the edge, they were gunned down by automatic fire and their bodies toppled into the ravine. The squads of shooters from Sonderkommando 4a relieved one another every few hours. At the end of the day, the bodies were covered with a thin layer of soil. On September 29-30, according to official reports of the Einsatzgruppe, 33,771 Jews were shot. Most of the victims were women, children, the elderly, and the ill those who had not been able to flee from Kiev after the Germans invaded. The Einsatzgruppe report noted proudly that, \"owing to exceptionally clever organization,\" the Jews did not realize what awaited them until the last moment. The report added that \"there were no incidents.\"\n\n08/10/1941\n\nVitebsk Ghetto liquidated; more than 16,000 Jews murdered\n\nThe Germans occupied Vitebsk, a district capital in northeastern Belorussia, on July 11, 1941. Immediately, the Jews suffered persecution, forced labor, and murder. A ghetto was established in the town and 16,000 Jews were settled there. The liquidation of the Vitebsk Ghetto began on October 8, 1941, on the pretext of epidemics that allegedly emanated from the place. In the course of the three-day murder Aktion, Jews were taken to the Vitbe River, where they were shot and their bodies hurled into the water.\n\n11/10/1941\n\nJews of Czernowitz, Romania, ghettoized\n\nCzernowitz (Chernovtsy, Cernauti) was the district center of the Chernovtsy Oblast and former capital of the Bukovina province. On October 11, by order of District Governor Corneliu Calotescu, all the Jews of Czernowitzâmore than 50,000âwere confined to an area of several side-streets, and representatives of the Romanian National Bank confiscated their belongings and property. The deportation of the Jews of Czernowitz to Transnistria began the next day. By 15 November, some 28,000 Jews had been deported.\n\n12/10/1941\n\nGermans reach outskirts of Moscow\n\n\"On the night of October 14-15, the situation on the western front deteriorated,\" a Red Army document states. \"The German-Fascist forces pitted large forces of tanks and mobile infantry against our forces and penetrated our defenses in one sector.\" Two entire Soviet armies, with more than 650,000 soldiers, were neutralized in the first two weeks of October. Stalin ordered government offices and some enterprises in the capital to evacuate, although he remained there to command the defense. German patrols came so close to the Soviet capital that they could see its water tower 15 miles away. This marked the Soviets' lowest point in the military campaign.\n\n15/10/1941\n\nDeportation of German and Austrian Jews to ghettos in the East begins\n\nA mass deportation from Austria to Lodz 5,000 Jews from Austria and a similar number of Gypsies from the Burgenland area began in the middle of October 1941. Afterwards, another 5,000 Jews were banished to the Lodz Ghetto and 3,000 to the Baltics.\n\n16/10/1941\n\nOdessa occupied and Jews massacred\n\nOdessa, the largest port city in the Ukraineâon the coast of the Black Seaâwas occupied on October 16, 1941, after a two-month siege. Immediately afterwards, the operations company of Romanian intelligence and Einsatzkommando 11b of Einsatzgruppe D massacred more than 8,000 people, mostly Jews.\n\n24/10/1941\n\n20,000 Jews transported to Dalnik; all murdered\n\nOn October 22, the Romanian command building was blown up and 66 members of the military, including the military governor of Odessa, were killed. In response, the dictator of Romania, Marshal Ion Antonescu, ordered the following: the execution of 200 Communists for each officer killed and 100 for each soldier; the incarceration of all Communists; and the taking of hostages among Jewish families. The next day, some 5,000 people, mostly Jews, were apprehended and executed, most by hanging and a smaller number by gunfire.Â\n\nThat afternoon, the Romanians rounded up another 20,000 Jews in the local prison and led them the next day to the village of Dalnik. Some of the victims were shot; others were locked in warehouses or herded into the harbor square where they were burned alive. After the massacre, many Jews of Odessa were sent to the camps, and another 35,000-40,000 who remained in the town were concentrated between October 25 and November 3, 1941, and kept outdoors for ten days. Those who did not die of exposure and starvation, or at the hands of the German inhabitants, were sent to their deaths a month later.\n\n25/10/1941\n\nEichmann approves plan for use of mobile gas vans\n\nOn the initiation of Heinrich Lohse, Reich Commissar for the Ostland, and Alfred Rosenberg, Minister of the Occupied Territories, a meeting was held at which Rosenberg and representatives from Lohse's and Adolf Eichmann's office were present. Soon thereafter, on October 25, Eichmann expressed his approval and requested the swift implementation of the use of mobile gas vans for murdering Jews.\n\n28/10/1941\n\nMassacre in Kovno: more than 9,000 Jews killed\n\nThe \"great Aktion\" in Kovno took place on October 28, 1941. The Jews of the ghetto were assembled in Democrats Square, SS Master Sergeant Helmut Raucke separated those fit for labor from the others. Workers were referred to the left, and non-workers - more than 9,000 men, women, and children - to the right. At dusk, when the sorting was completed, everyone on the right was sent to the \"small ghetto\"; those to the left were allowed to return to their homes. The next morning, the Jews who had been gathered in the \"small ghetto\" were marched to the Ninth Fort, where they were murdered by gunfire that toppled them into large pits prepared by Russian prisoners of war.\n\n30/10/1941\n\nBratislava Jews expelled to rural Slovakia\n\nAnti-Jewish legislation in Slovakia, Germany's ally and patron state, gathered much momentum in 1941. Jews were required to wear the Jewish Badge and perform forced labor. Construction of labor camps for Jews began in the autumn. An order for the banishment of 10,000 of the 15,000 Jews in Bratislava to several peripheral towns and labor camps was issued in September and implemented in October. In a statement to the German Foreign Office of October 22, 1941, concerning the deportations to the peripheral towns, the German Ambassador to Slovakia, Hans Ludin, noted that the action had followed the example of the ghettos in the Generalgouvernement and took place with the encouragement of the German advisor on Jewish affairs, Dieter Wisliceny.\n\n01/11/1941\n\nConstruction of Belzec camp begins\n\nIn May 1940, the Germans built a labor camp for Jews in Belzec, a small town in the southeastern part of the Lublin district in Poland. The Jewish inmates were put to work at building fortifications and anti-tank trenches on the German-Soviet frontier. The camp was closed in late 1940. In late October, 1941, construction of an extermination camp at Belzec began as part of Operation Reinhard. The camp was built along a railroad siding half a kilometer from the Belzec railroad station. The anti-tank trenches on the camp premises were given a new purpose: mass graves for the Jews who would be murdered there.Â\n\nBy December 1942, some 600,000 Jews had been murdered in Belzec.\n\n01/11/1941\n\nRomanians agree to the murder of Jewish citizens living outside Romania\n\nIn November 1941, Deputy Prime Minister of Romania Mihai Antonescu agreed to the deportation to the extermination camps of Jews who were Romanian nationals living in Germany or German-occupied countries. Several thousand of these Jews were deported and killed.Â\n\n15/11/1941\n\nJews murdered in Maly Trostinets, near Minsk\n\nFrom November 1941, Jews and other victims of the Nazi regime (Soviet POWs, partisans, hostages etc) were murdered in the Blagovtshina Forest, near the village of Maly Trostinets, south-east of Minsk. The first to be murdered were some 10,000 Jews from the Minsk ghetto, and beginning in May 1942, Jews were transported from Germany, Bohemia and Moravia, Poland and the Netherlands, to be murdered there. Some were murdered in gas vans, and all were buried in pits that were dug at that time. According to different estimates, between 206,500 and 500,000 people were murdered in the region of Maly Trostinets.\n\n24/11/1941\n\n\"Model Camp\" established in Theresienstadt\n\nThe first deportees to the Theresienstadt Ghetto arrived at the end of November 1941. By the end of May 1942, 28,887 Jews, one-third of the Jews in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, had been banished to this camp. The Czech Jewish leadership initially supported the plan to establish this ghetto, hoping that it would spare the Jews from deportation to the East. In the first few months, conditions in Theresienstadt resembled those in other Nazi concentration camps, and the hopes that the ghetto would prevent deportation to the East were also dashed. After the first deportation of 2,000 Jews to Riga in January 1942, the inmates of the ghetto lived in dread of deportation at all times.Â\n\nBetween November, 1941 and April 20, 1945, 140000 Jews had been expelled to Theresienstadt. Of these 32,497 people died there from the intolerable conditions. Of the 86,934 who had been deported from the Ghetto to Auschwitz, 3097 survived. At the end of October 1944, only 11,068 inmates remained in Theresienstadt.\n\n30/11/1941\n\n30,000 Riga Jews arrested, subsequently shot at Rumbuli\n\nThe Germans established two ghettos for the Jews of Riga. On the night of November 29, Germans separated working Jewish men from the rest of the ghetto inhabitants and removed them to a fenced area at the northeastern corner of the city that had been cleared of its residents three days before. On the night of November 30, German and Latvian guards ringed the western part of the \"large ghetto.\" The inhabitants were rounded up in groups of 1,000, and on the following day, December 1, they were taken out to the Rumbuli Forest, eight kilometers from town, and shot to death at the edge of large pits that had been prepared.Â\n\nAll inhabitants of the \"large ghetto\" were murdered on December 8-9. In the two phases of the Aktion, approximately 30,000 people were murdered at Rumbuli, including the members of the Aeltestenrat and the historian Simon Dubnow.\n\n06/12/1941\n\nSoviets launch counteroffensive at Moscow\n\nThe Germans were already at the gates of the Soviet capital. The Soviet Union reached its lowest point in the war, its institutions of state about to fall to the German army. Georgi Zhukov, Red Army chief of staff, was summoned to orchestrate the city's defense. He built the defense line and waited for his colleague, \"General Winter.\" The German generals pleaded with Hitler to establish a defense line for the winter, but he refused, insisting they continue to attack. The counteroffensive began on December 6 under Zukhov. Three new, specially prepared Soviet armies consisting of 1 million combat soldiers, attacked the German forces. The onslaught caught the German forces exhausted, dug into heavy snow, freezing in the cold, and too widely dispersed by surprise. The German defense disintegrated, thousands of German soldiers were taken prisoner, and Soviet newspapers ran photographs of them covered with women's undergarments and furs against the bitter cold. Zukhov's counterattack spared Moscow from the threat of German occupation and handed the Wehrmacht its first defeat.\n\n07/12/1941\n\nJapanese attack Pearl Harbor; U.S. enters war\n\nJapanese forces attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, in Hawaii, and other American and British sites in the Pacific Ocean. The main Japanese force chose to assault Pearl Harbor from the air, in order to take out the principal American fleet in the Pacific. Most of the warships were unscathed, because they were not in the harbor at that time. The U.S. Navy, although not destroyed totally, incurred heavy losses: 4 warships, 92 naval aircraft, and 96 army aircraft were destroyed; 2,334 American servicemen killed and 1,347 wounded. The Japanese lost 28 planes, 5 submarines, and fewer than 100 men.Â\n\nThe United States declared war on Japan the next day. Great Britain, Canada, New Zealand, the Free French, the Netherlands, and other countries joined the declaration. Some 60 million Americans heard President Roosevelt urge Congress to declare war against all the Axis forces.\n\n07/12/1941\n\n\"Night and Fog\" suppresses resistance in Western Europe\n\nGeneral Wilhelm Keitel, the OKW chief of staff, signed an order prescribing repressive measures against resistance movements in the German-occupied countries of Western Europe France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. To deter all inhabitants of occupied Western Europe from taking action, Keitel ordered the use of extreme measures of terror. The death penalty was introduced for resistance activity. The order prohibited the broadcasting of information on suspects, thereby facilitating their disappearance in nacht und nebel \"Night and Fog.\"Â\n\nKeitel sent the minister of justice instructions on how to interpret and implement the order. He stressed that Hitler considered even life imprisonment for anti-German activity an indication of German weakness. The Ministry of Justice expressed no objection to being charged with implementing the punishments stipulated in the order or to the guidelines it was given by the Wehrmacht General Staff. The right to clemency was not applied to Jews and Communists. The surviving \"Night and Fog\" prisoners were liberated in April and May 1945.\n\n08/12/1941\n\nGas vans introduced at Chelmno\n\nTransports to Chelmno for extermination began on December 7, and the camp went into operation the next day. Chelmno was meant to be a site for the murder of the Jews of the Lodz Ghetto and the Wartheland. The first victims were Jews from communities in the vicinity, who were told that they were being transported to Germany for labor and that they must undergo disinfection in groups of 70-90 persons. As the Jews undressed, their valuables were collected in baskets and the appearance of recording them with their owners' names was made. Then they were led naked through a doorway bearing a sign \"To the Baths\" into a 25-meter passage, fenced on both sides. At its end, the passage turned into a slope that led to a gas van. From the moment the victims reached the slope, the Germans, with great cruelty, made them run in the only direction possible: downhill into the truck.Â\n\nThe camp had three gas vans, each of which was equipped with a sealed rear compartment that had a set of double doors. From the outside, they looked like moving vans. Inside, the compartment was lined with galvanized steel and had a wooden grating on the floor. Under the grating was a pipe with openings, and at the end of the pipe was a fixture with which gas was pumped into the compartment through a hose. The driver padlocked the rear doors and started the engine. Within 10 minutes, the victims died of suffocation from the exhaust fumes. Forced laborers were induced, under severe torture, to remove the corpses from the gas vans and bury them in mass graves.\n\n11/12/1941\n\nGermany and Italy declare war on the U.S.\n\nThe United States declared war on Japan the day after the Japanese attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941). In response, Italy and Germany, Japan's allies, declared war on the United States, making the U.S. a full partner in the war against Germany. However, back in March of that year, in the context of the war in the Atlantic, American naval vessels had begun patrolling maritime routes in the western Atlantic in order to relieve the pressure on the British navy. In September 1941, a German submarine attacked the American destroyer Greer; and in October, a German submarine sank the American vessel Reuben James. President Roosevelt ordered his fleet to carry out a reprisal attack, thus bringing the U.S. into the campaign at that early stage, albeit indirectly.Â\n\nThe official and full participation of the U.S. in the war against Germany and its allies would become one of the main factors in Germany's defeat. The other two Axis countries, Bulgaria and Hungary, added their names to the declaration of war on December 13.\n\n12/12/1941\n\nFirst transport of Jews reaches Majdanek extermination camp\n\nThe first persons deported to the Waffen-SS concentration and extermination camp on the outskirts of Lublin, Poland, were prisoners of war. The true functions of the camp, however, were to remove and exterminate enemies of the Third Reich, to exterminate Jews, and to assist in the deportation and resettlement of the inhabitants of the Zamosc region. The camp was ringed with a high-tension electrified double barbed-wire fence punctuated by 18 watchtowers. Adjoining the camp and its gas chambers were workshops, warehouses, a laundry, and other facilities. The SS's residential section of the camp also had a casino.Â\n\nOn 12 December 1941, the first group of Jews was deported to Majdanek: 150 men who had been captured in a manhunt in the Lublin ghetto. By 6 January 1945, just 17 of them were still alive, and were liberated from the camp by an order of the German Labor Ministry in Lublin. Between 22 February and 9 November 1942, at least 4000 Jews from Lublin were murdered in Majdanek.\n\n21/12/1941\n\nMore than 40,000 Jews shot at Bogdanovka\n\nBogdanovka was an extermination camp that the Romanian occupation authorities established in the village of that name on the Bug River, in the Golta district of Transnistria. In the middle of December 1941, when several cases of typhus were discovered in the camp, a joint decision was made by Fleisher the German advisor to the Romanian administration of the district and Romanian District Commissioner: Col. Modest Isopesco , to murder all the inmates. Participating in this operation were Romanian soldiers and gendarmes, Ukrainian police and civilians from Golta, and local ethnic Germans (Volksdeutsche) under the commander of the Ukrainian regular police, Kazachievici. The Aktion began on December 21. Some 5,000 ill and disabled prisoners were gathered in barns that were set ablaze. The remaining Jews were arranged in rows of 300-400, led to a forest near the camp, and shot in the neck. The four-day operation resulted in the murder of 30,000 Jews. The remaining Jews, waiting their turn in bitter cold, dug pits with their bare hands and packed them with frozen corpses. Thousands of Jews froze to death. The murders were halted on Christmas Eve and resumed on December 28. By the evening of December 31, the last 11,000 Jews were also dead.\n\n22/12/1941\n\n33,500 of 57,000 Jews in Vilna already murdered\n\nThe last Aktion in a series of operations in the Vilna Ghetto took place on December 22, 1941. The Germans' method was to murder inmates who did not hold a \"Schein,\" a German-issued labor permit. For this reason, the Jews in this city termed the murder operations \"Schein-aktionen.\" By the end of 1941, the Germans had murdered 33,500 of the 57,000 Jews in Vilna, mostly at the massacre site at Ponary.Â\n\nSeveral Jews managed to survive Ponary and return to the Vilna Ghetto. A teacher, Rivka Yoselewska, who regained consciousness in the mass grave related:Â\n\n'When I came up to the place - we saw people, naked, lined up. But we were still hoping that this was only torture. Some of the young people tried to run, but they were caught immediately, and they were shot right there. It was difficult to hold on to the children. We took all children not ours, and we carried them -we were anxious to get it all over - the suffering of the children was difficult; we all trudged along to come nearer to the place and to come nearer to the end of the torture of the children. The children were taking leave of their parents and parents of their elders.Â\n\nWe were driven; we were already undressed; the clothes were removed and taken away; our father did not want to undress; he remained in his underwear.Â\n\nThen they tore off the clothing off the old man and he was shot. I saw it with my own eyes. And then they took my mother, and we said, let us go before her; but they caught mother and shot her too; There was my younger sister, and she wanted to leave; she prayed with the Germans; she asked to run, naked; she went up to the Germans with one of her friends; they were embracing each other; and she asked to be spared, standing there naked. He looked into her eyes and shot the two of them. They fell together in their embrace, the two young girls, my sister and her young friend. Then my second sister was shot and then my turn did come.Â\n\nWe turned towards the grave and then he turned around and asked \"Whom shall I shoot first?\" We were already facing the grave. The German asked \"Whom do you want me to shoot first?\" I did not answer. I felt him take the child from my arms. The child cried out and was shot immediately. And then he aimed at me. First he held on to my hair and turned my head around; I stayed standing; I heard a shot, but I continued to stand and then he turned my head again and he aimed the revolver at me and ordered me to watch and then turned my head around and shot at me. Then I fell to the ground into the pit amongst the bodies; but I felt nothing.Â\n\nThe moment I did feel I felt a sort of heaviness and then I thought maybe I am not alive any more, but I feel something after I died. I thought I was dead, that this was the feeling which comes after death. Then I felt that I was choking; people falling over me. I tried to move and felt that I was alive and that I could rise. I was choking. I heard the shots and I was praying for another bullet to put an end to my suffering, but I continued to move about. I felt that I was choking, strangled, but I tried to save myself, to find some air to breathe, and then I felt that I was climbing towards the top of the grave above the bodies.Â\n\nI rose, and I felt bodies pulling at me with their hands, biting at my legs, pulling me down, down. And yet with my last strength I came up on top of the grave, and when I did I did not know the place, so many bodies were lying all over, dead people; I wanted to see the end of this stretch of dead bodies but I could not. It was impossible. They were lying, all dying; suffering; not all of them dead, but in the last throes of suffering; naked; shot, but not dead. Children crying \"Mother\", \"Father\"; I could not stand on my feet.'Â\n\n31/12/1941\n\nFirst partisan manifesto in Vilna\n\nAs Jews were being deported from Vilna to Ponary, several inhabitants of the ghetto realized that the actions being perpetrated against them belonged to a genocide scheme. Several leading members of the Ha-Shomer ha-Tza'ir youth movement in Vilna slipped out of the ghetto, found refuge in a monastery a short distance from town, and attempted to understand the meaning of the events and the conclusions to adduce from them. Abba Kovner said, \"One mustn't believe that those who were taken from us are alive, that their removal was merely a deportation. Everything that has happened to us thus far; that is, Ponary is death, and even this fact is not the whole truth. It is immeasurably greater and deeper than that. The annihilation of thousands is but a portent of the extermination of millions.... Vilna is not just Vilna. Ponary is not a [passing] episode. The yellow Schein is not an invention of the local commandant. We are facing a carefully thought-out method, which for the moment we cannot fathom.... Is there any possibility of rescue? As brutal as the answer sounds, we have to state it: No, there is no deliverance!\" In a meeting with members of the youth movement on December 31, Kovner showed them a poster in which he urged Jewish young people to resist: \"Hitler is plotting to annihilate all of European Jewry.... Let us not go like lambs to the slaughter! True, we are weak and defenseless, but the only answer to the enemy is resistance!\" It was the first time that an Einsatzgruppe murder Aktion was judged to be part of a general plan to obliterate European Jewry, and the first time that Jews were urged to defend themselves against the Nazis with arms.\n\n06/01/1942\n\nMolotov hands over information on mass graves\n\nOn January 6, 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Viacheslav Molotov sent a message to all countries with which the USSR had diplomatic relations, with information on mass graves that the Soviet army had discovered after liberating a series of towns and localities on the Moscow front in the winter offensive. The letters, entitled \"Concerning the NazisÂ´ terrible crimes against civilians, prisoners of war, and others,\" quoted witnesses who had come from the occupied territories and described the murder of 52,000 people in Kiev and additional thousands in Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Mariopol, Kamenets-Podolsk, and other locations. The letters supported fragmentary reports that were gradually reaching the Western countries and corroborated accounts of the genocide raging through Europe.\n\n14/01/1942\n\nConcentration and expulsion of Dutch Jewry begin\n\nPreparations for the annihilation of Dutch Jewry were made in late 1941 when the German authorities informed the Jewish leadership that \"unemployed Jews\" would be sent to labor camps. The first deportation in the Netherlands took place on January 14, 1942, as part of a plan to make the country Judenrein. It began in the town of Zandam: Jews with Dutch citizenship were ordered to move to Amsterdam, and alien Jews were transported to the Westerbork camp.\n\n16/01/1942\n\nDeportation of some 55,000 people from Lodz to Chelmno begins\n\nAmidst much terror and intimidation, the first transport from Lodz set out for the gas vans of the Chelmno extermination camp. Earlier, the German authorities forced the chairman of the Judenrat, Chaim Rumkowski, to prepare lists of candidates for deportation and to organize the assembly points at the edge of the ghetto. Rumkowski was not aware of the purpose of the deportation at that time. A committee was appointed and ordered to select victims among those in the \"asocial\" category-people sentenced for various offenses (who would be banished along with their families), and those on welfare. Excused from the deportation were the seriously ill, sick children, residents of old-age homes, public functionaries, and rabbis. Those who did not report as told were taken to the collection point by the Jewish police. The first deportation also included deportees from Germany: groups of Jews and Gypsies, who had been living in a separate part of the ghetto since October 1941. From the assembly point, the victims were transported to the Chelmno extermination camp under especially heavy German guard. All were murdered in gas vans the day they arrived, or the day after.Â\n\nBetween January and May 1942, approximately 55,000 Jews were deported from Lodz to Chelmno. By the end of these deportations, the Lodz Ghetto had been \"productivized,\" turned into a camp where the only legal inhabitants were forced laborers who manufactured for the Germans.Â\n\n20/01/1942\n\nWannsee Conference\n\nOn January 20, a meeting took place in a villa in Wannsee, on the outskirts of Berlin, to discuss the measures and inter-ministerial coordination needed to implement the \"Final Solution\" of the Jewish problem. The meeting was held at the initiative of Reinhard Heydrich, who, as HimmlerÂ´s deputy and the head of the RSHA, had been authorized by Hermann Goering to elaborate a program that would solve the Jewish problem totally. Heydrich summoned the directors of the main government agencies that would have to cooperate for the plan to succeed. The goal of the meeting was not to discuss a decision to solve the Jewish problem by murdering all the Jews, but only to consider ways of implementing a decision already made.Â\n\nThe meeting was originally scheduled for December 9, 1941, but did not take place until January 20, 1942. It was attended by the State Secretaries of the most important German government ministries. Including the highest-ranking representatives of the Interior Ministry of the Generalgouvernement, the Foreign Office, the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories, the Ministry of Justice, the Reich Chancellery, the Four-Year-Plan Office, several leading officials in the SS Race and Resettlement Main Office, the commander of Einsatzgruppe A, the director of the Party chancellery office, Heydrich, and his Jewish affairs expert, Adolf Eichmann.Â\n\nHeydrich began the meeting with a lengthy speech. Because most of the participants were directly or indirectly involved in the mass murders that were already underway, he did not need to relate to a matter that was unfamiliar to the participants. HeydrichÂ´s plan targeted all 11 million Jews in Europe as by Nazi definition and statistics. He would exploit the Jewish masses for road-building and subject those who survived this grueling labor to \"special treatment\"-murder.Â\n\nIn the last portion of his speech, Heydrich addressed himself to several special problems, foremost the fate of Jews who had married Aryans, and their offspring. The conference participants did not resolve these questions.Â\n\nThe directors of the government offices presented no obstacles; the meeting lasted only 60-90 minutes.\n\n21/01/1942\n\nUnited Partisan Organization established in Vilna\n\nOn January 21, 1942, representatives of Zionist youth movements convened in the Vilna Ghetto, resolved to mount a resistance, and founded the United Partisan Organization-the Fareynegte Partizaner Organizatsye (FPO) in Yiddish. The FPO was an outgrowth of the discussion held on the night of December 31, 1941, in which the poster concerning \"Lambs to the slaughter\" was read out and the Jewish youth movement leaders were urged to organize for struggle against the Germans, in the awareness that the Germans intended to subject the Jews to genocide. Yitzhak Wittenberg, a representative of the Communists, was chosen as commander. The task of the FPO was to make preparations for armed resistance that would be offered the moment the Germans came to liquidate the ghetto. The members of the new organization were divided into five-person underground cells that were combined into platoons and companies. All the parties and youth movements that united for resistance were represented in the FPO command. The FPO sent representatives to other ghettos in order to establish contact, apprise them of the genocide campaign underway, and spread the idea of resistance and rebellion. The FPOÂ´s main problem and constraint was the procurement of weapons.\n\n15/02/1942\n\nEstablishment of Jadu concentration camp in Libya\n\nThe Jadu concentration camp in Libya was established in February 1942. Jadu was a former army camp, surrounded by a barbed-wire fence. Its commandants were Italian, and the guards were Italian and Arab policemen. Out of the twenty-six hundred Jews sent there, more than five hundred died within 3 months, of weakness and hunger, and especially from typhoid fever and typhus. Water shortages, malnutrition, overcrowding, and filth intensified the spread of contagion. Inmates buried the dead in a cemetery on a hill outside the camp.Â\n\nIn January 1943, the camp guards left. Several weeks later, British soldiers arrived, but many of the prisoners could not be moved due to their poor physical condition. The first Jews returned to their homes from Jadu in the spring of 1943, and the last group of prisoners only left Jadu in October 1943.Â\n\n24/02/1942\n\nSinking of the \"Struma\"\n\nIn December 1941, 769 Jews boarded the old cattle boat Struma in the port of Constanta, Romania; their destination was Eretz Israel.Â\n\nThe boat reached the port of Constantinople, where it remained at anchor for over two months with its passengers confined on board, as they did not have entry permits for Eretz Israel.Â\n\nThe many pleas from various quarters to the British to permit the entry of the Jews on the basis of the existing modest legal immigration quota were to no avail. The Turkish authorities, for their part, were adamant in refusing permission to transfer the would-be immigrants to a transit camp on land until the resumption of their voyage could be arranged, even though the camp was maintained by Jewish organizations at their own expense.Â\n\nOn February 24, 1942, the Turkish police towed the boat into the open sea, although it had no water, food, or fuel on board. Within a few hours it was sunk, struck by a torpedo apparently fired in error from a Soviet submarine. Only a single passenger was saved.Â\n\n13/03/1942\n\nJDC: Germans have already killed 240,000 Jews in Ukraine alone\n\nIn March 1942, Bertrand Jacobson (for two years the JDCÂ´s main agent in its relief efforts in Eastern Europe) held a press conference that provided information for newspapers around the world. Jacobson estimated that the Nazis had already murdered 240,000 Jews in the Ukraine alone and asserted that the killings in Eastern Europe were continuing in full fury.Â\n\nOne of the most horrifying disclosures made in the United States to that point was an account by a Hungarian soldier who had observed a large mass grave near Kiev. Seven thousand Jews, some dead but others wounded and alive, had been thrown into the shallow grave and covered with a thin layer of soil. The spectacle of this field, \"heaving like a living sea,\" was etched into the soldierÂ´s memory.Â\n\nAlthough we know today that these figures underestimated the extent of the NazisÂ´ genocide among the Jews through March 1942, the press coverage had the important effect of revealing the reports on the murders to the free world.\n\n17/03/1942\n\nBelzec Extermination Camp inaugurated\n\nBy March 17, the main installations of the Belzec Extermination Camp, located near a siding of the Belzec railroad line, had been constructed, tried out, and the program for mass extermination was launched. In experimental gassings conducted in late February, Jews from Lubycze Kralewska and the Jewish forced laborers who had built the camp for the Germans were murdered. Anti-tank trenches on the camp premises wegiven a new function: mass graves for the Jews who would be murdered there. At first the camp had three gas chambers, each eight meters long and four meters wide. The trip to the camp took hours, if not days, under appalling conditions that left many deportees dead en route and others on the verge of death. The survivors were unloaded from the trains with shouting, beatings, and threats. They were told that they were about to be disinfected. After they undressed and handed over their possessions, they entered the gas chambers through what the Germans called \"the tube\"-a passageway 20 meters long, 2 meters wide, and lined with fences, through which the victims were driven naked. The chambers were hermetically sealed and could be opened only from the outside. The gas, pumped into the chambers through hoses, killed everyone inside within 20-30 minutes. Each chamber had another aperture for the removal of the corpses. Some 80,000 Jews from Lublin, Lvov, and other ghettos in the vicinity were murdered in Belzec in the campÂ´s first four weeks of operation.\n\n26/03/1942\n\n58,000 Slovakian Jews deported\n\nThe deportation of Slovakian Jews to the Lublin district and to Auschwitz began in late March 1942. This transport was undertaken with cooperation and substantive assistance from the Slovakians, who prepared the transport trains and arrested Jews for deportation.Â\n\nAlfred Wetzler, subsequently famous as one of the four young men who escaped from Auschwitz in the spring of 1944, testified about the circumstances of his removal from his parentsÂ´ home: \"Guardsmen arrested the Jews and took everyone they found, including people aged sixty and over. When the guardsmen came to take my parents, I asked them to leave my parents alone and let me go in their stead.\"\n\n28/03/1942\n\nFirst transport of French Jews to Auschwitz\n\nIn December 1941, the military commander Otto Stuelpnagel took advantage of the attempted killing of a German officer in Paris to escalate anti-Jewish activities in France. He sought permission to shoot 100 hostages, impose a mammoth fine on the Jews of France, and deport 1,000 Jews to the East. Hitler approved these measures, and on December 12 Jews were arrested in Paris and interned in a camp in Compiegne. Serious transport difficulties delayed the deportation for some time. The deportation of Jews from France to Auschwitz was the first such action in Western Europe, and Eichmann approached the matter cautiously. He wished to increase the number of deportees to 10,000 and obtained authorization to do so from the German Foreign Office, which operated in close coordination with the government of France. The first train, carrying 1,012 Jews, did not leave on March 23 as planned, but on March 27. The Jewish population was horrified; thousands of panic-stricken Jews sought hideouts from the Nazis and the French police in any possible location. Eichmann, inspired by the success of this transport, began to plan mass deportations from the West.\n\n01/04/1942\n\nJewish Anti-Fascist Committee established in USSR\n\nAfter Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, a peopleÂ´s assembly on the air was organized under the slogan of Soviet JewsÂ´ unity with \"their Jewish brethren\" around the world. The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee first met in Kuybyshev, where some of the institutions of state had moved when the German army advanced toward Moscow. The Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee was one of a set of anti-Fascist committees that operated under the Ministry of Propaganda. The committee urged world Jewry, especially that in the United States, to mobilize for the anti-Fascist struggle. Its communiques made abundant use of Jewish motifs, symbols, and personalitiesÂ´ names. The committee presidium was headed by some 20 famous Soviet Jews from all walks of life.\n\n08/04/1942\n\nEinsatzgruppen report: No Jews left in Crimea\n\nIn April 1942, the Crimean Peninsula was declared Judenfrei-cleansed of Jews. When the Axis occupied most of the Crimea in October 1941, the area had a Jewish population of 50,000-60,000. They were murdered by the Einsatzgruppen units, with active assistance from the local population.\n\n30/04/1942\n\nPinsk Ghetto established\n\nOn April 30, the Germans ordered the Jews of Pinsk to move into the ghetto by 4:00 p.m. on May 1. More than 20,000 persons were packed into the ghetto, a cramped area in a slum quarter.\n\n01/05/1942\n\nFirst mass killing in Sobibor Extermination Camp\n\nThe Sobibor camp was built near the small village of that name in the eastern sector of the Lublin district, close to a railroad line. Construction of the camp was based on experience gained in building and operating the camp at Belzec. Sobibor, laid out in a rectangle 600 x 400 meters, was partitioned into three zones. The \"forward camp\" had a railroad platform, room for 20 cars, and GermansÂ´ and UkrainiansÂ´ housing quarters. Jews transported to the camp for extermination were taken to the \"reception area,\" where they underwent all steps preceding their murder: removal of clothing, removal of womenÂ´s hair, and appropriation of valuables. The extermination area, the most distant, contained the gas chambers, the burial pits, and a barracks for Jewish prisoners. The reception area and the extermination area were connected by a path 150 meters long, 3 meters wide, and bordered by barbed-wire fences camouflaged with vegetation, through which the victims were driven naked. The camp had three gas chambers, each one 4 x 4 meters. Each chamber had an additional door through which the bodies were removed. The gas was pumped in from an adjacent shed. In the middle of April 1942, as construction of the camp was nearly complete, a group of Jews, mostly women, was taken to Sobibor from the labor camp in Krychow to make sure the gas chambers would work properly. The pilot run was attended by the entire camp command. Operations at Sobibor were based on deception; the victims did not know what awaited them until the gas was being pumped into the sealed chambers. The first transport included 10,000 Jews from Germany and Austria, 6,000 from Theresienstadt, and thousands from Slovakia. In the first two months-from early May to the end of June-100,000 Jews were murdered in Sobibor. The Germans found that the gas chambers, which had a capacityof fewer than 600 people, were a bottleneck in the murder process. Therefore, a halt in camp operations in the summer was used to construct three more chambers, thus doubling the pace of extermination.\n\n18/05/1942\n\nThe New York Times reports by May 18, more than 400,000 Jews shot by Germans\n\nReports on the mass murders carried out by the Einsatzgruppen began to filter into the United States and England very shortly after the Aktionen themselves. As early as July 1941, the Yiddish daily press in New York revealed that hundreds of Jewish citizens had been slaughtered by Nazi soldiers in Minsk, Brest-Litovsk, Lvov, and elsewhere. Additional reports arrived in subsequent months, and in late October 1941, The New York Times carried a story on its inside pages concerning the murder of thousands of Jews in eastern Poland and the Ukraine. In March 1942, the Jewish and the general press reported the mammoth dimensions of the genocide for the first time.Â\n\nOn May 18, The New York Times carried a report by a United Press correspondent who had been trapped in Germany when the United States entered the war. Reaching Lisbon with a group of American citizens who had been exchanged for citizens of the Axis countries, the correspondent revealed that the Germans had machine-gunned to death more than 100,000 Jews in the Baltic countries, nearly as many in Poland, and more than twice as many in western Russia.\n\n27/05/1942\n\nCzech Underground assassinates Heydrich\n\nReinhard Heydrich, acting governor of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, was driving "
