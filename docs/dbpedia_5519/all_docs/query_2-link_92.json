I have learned that the life of Faith is not lived in the head. I keep learning that all life is a gift from God. I believe in a giving and forgiving God, a loving God. I believe in a Church that will survive every challenge placed before it. We Are the Church, all of us. We are all on the same journey of life. The priesthood does not give one a free ride; far from it. “To whom more has been given, more shall be demanded.” I pray for the grace to end my days in God’s hands.”\n\nFr. Gregory M.
