        "text": "OUR STORY:\n\nFounded from Two Missions - Hawaii\n\nTHE HAWAIIAN MISSION\n\nOur story begins with the first foreign mission territory entrusted to the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. The United States Province of the Congregation finds its origin in this mission. In May of 1825 our Founder, Fr. Coudrin went to Rome to obtain approval of the new Constitutions. On July 15, 1825, he visited the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of the Faith and requested foreign missions for the Congregation. On October 6, 1825, the Founder accepted the mission to the Sandwich Islands. After two failed attempts to secure passage to the Sandwich Islands, on September 25, 1826. Fathers Alexis Bachelot, ss.cc. (appointed Apostolic Prefect), Abraham Armand, ss.cc. and Patrick Short ss.cc, and Brothers Theodosius Boissier, ss.cc. Melchior Bondu, ss.cc. and Eustache Hurel, ss.cc. departed from Paris by stagecoach for Bordeaux. Two of the brothers fell ill in Bordeaux and Br. Hurel had to be replaced by Br. Leonard Portal ss.cc.\n\nFinally, on November 20, 1826 the six missionaries departed from Bordeaux on the Comète. After an arduous sea journey with several port calls in South America, they arrived in Honolulu on July 7, 1827. After some difficulties they were allowed to disembark on July 13 and celebrated the first recorded Mass on Hawaiian soil.\n\nPhilippe de Morineau, leader of the French community in Honolulu, secured a grant of land for the mission from King Kamehameha III. Located at the site of the present Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, it was to become the center of the Honolulu Catholic Mission. The mission house served as the residence for Honolulu priests who ministered at several chapels and quasi parishes until the early 20th century. Two of the first Honolulu parishes to have their own resident priests in the 1920’s were St. Augustine in Waikiki and Sacred Heart on Wilder Avenue.\n\nThe missionaries, however, were not given a warm reception in the Hawaiian Kingdom. Seven years earlier, the members of the American Protestant Mission of Massachusetts arrived. They had established themselves and gained favor with the Hawaiian royalty. However, for a while our brothers had the protection of Boki, the Royal Governor of O’ahu. With some foresight they began preparing lay catechists who were instrumental in the growth of the faith in the mission.\n\nIn late 1829 Governor Boki departed on an expedition. Persecution of Catholics began, led by Queen Kaahumanu. Boki never returned, his ship was lost at sea. By the end of 1831, Fr. Armand and Brs. Boissier and Portal had returned to France. The Queen expelled Fathers Bachelot and Short on December 24, 1831 and left for California. Br. Bondu was left alone to hold the fledgling mission together. Brother Portal returned to Hawai’i in 1834.\n\nIn September 1836 Father Robert Arsenius Walsh, ss.cc. arrived in Hawaii. As a British citizen, he was allowed to stay but was banned from public preaching. Thinking that things were improving Fathers Bachelot and Short returned in April 1837. A few months later Father Louis Maigret, ss.cc. arrived from France. The priests were again ordered to leave. In October, Fr. Short left the islands. In November, Frs. Bachelot and Maigret departed for Ponape. In December 1837 the Catholic religion was declared illegal by official ordinance. During this period, the natives were given harsh punishments for the \"crime\" of being Catholic. Hundreds were imprisoned and forced into hard labor. It took a threat of war to stop the persecution. On July 9, 1839, the French warship L'Artemise arrived in Honolulu Harbor. Captain Laplace demanded religious freedom for Catholics in Hawaii. King Kamehameha III, fearing an attack, issued the Edict of Toleration, giving Catholics the freedom to worship.\n\nIn 1833, Rome had created the new Vicariate Apostolic of Eastern Oceania, headquartered in Valparaiso, Chile. The Hawaiian mission was placed under this new Vicariate. Fr. Etienne Rouchouze, ss.cc. was named Vicar Apostolic and Titular Bishop of Nilopolis. With religious liberty assured in Hawaii, Bishop Rouchouze visited in 1840 accompanied by Fr. Maigret, who had been in Mangareva, and Frs. Ernest Heurtel, ss.cc. and Dosithé Desvault, ss.cc. who were in the Marquesas.\n\nUnder the new mantle of religious liberty, the Catholic mission could grow and expand. Seeing the mission chapel had become too small to accommodate the growing community of faith, Bishop Rouchouze laid the cornerstone for the Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace on August 6, 1840. It was dedicated on August 15, 1843.\n\nIn 1841 O’ahu was divided into mission districts. and Fr. Martial Jan, ss.cc. was assigned to the Ko’olau district. Working from He’eia many chapels were establish in windward O’ahu. Education was thought to be key to spreading the Catholic Faith. With the spread of the mission, mission schools were established. In 1846 Ahuimanu College was opened on the windward side. It would evolve and move, eventually becoming the modern-day St. Louis High School in Kaimuk?.\n\nVery soon the missionary endeavors spread to the neighboring islands. Fr. Walsh was particularly instrumental in this evangelization. He and Fr. Heurtel landed in Kailua-Kona on the Island of Hawai’i in June 1840. Walsh’s next mission was Kaua’i. He celebrated mass at Koloa on Christmas day 1841. Then he spent three weeks on Ni’ihau in 1842. The mission on Maui began in 1846. When the missionaries landed in Lahaina, they found 4,000 catechumens prepared by the renowned lay catechist Helio Koaeloa.\n\nRealizing the prospects for expanding the mission, in 1841 Bishop Rouchouze sailed to France to recruit more missionaries and raise monies. He was successful in his endeavor. He acquired a ship for his return, named the Marie-Joseph in honor of the Founder. The Marie-Joseph left St. Malo on December 15, 1842. Aboard ship was the bishop, six priests, a subdeacon, seven lay brothers, and ten sisters. Tragedy struck! After a stop in Florianopolis, Brazil the ship set sail February 1843 and was never seen again.\n\nAfter the disappearance of Bishop Rouchouze, the three prefectures of the Vicariate Apostolic of eastern Oceania were elevated into independent vicariates apostolic. In 1847 Pope Pius IX created the Vicariate Apostolic of the Sandwich Islands and Fr. Maigret was appointed Vicar Apostolic and Titular Bishop of Arathia. He was consecrated in Valparaiso, Chile. In 1848 the name was changed to Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands. The mission continued to grow and flourish. It was at Bishop Maigret’s request for volunteers, in 1873, that St. Damien was the first to volunteer to serve in Kalaupapa.\n\nBishop Maigret, ss.cc. died in 1882. From 1882 to 1940 the Vicariate Apostolic of the Hawaiian Islands was served by four other Sacred Hearts Vicars Apostolic: Herman Koeckemann, ss.cc, Titular Bishop of Olba (1882–1892), Gulstan Ropert, ss.cc, Titular Bishop of Panopolis (1892–1903), Libert H. Boeynaems, ss.cc, Titular Bishop of Zeugma in Syria (1903–1926), Stephen Alencastre, ss.cc, Titular Bishop of Arabissus (1926–1940).\n\nBishop Alencastre died aboard a ship on route from Los Angeles on November 9, 1940. With Bishop Alencastre’s death the mission status of the Catholic Church in Hawai’i ended. Pope Pius XII erected the new Diocese of Honolulu on January 25, 1941.\n\nTHE HAWAIIAN PROVINCE\n\nThe acceptance of the foreign missions brought with it the establishment of religious houses of members of the Congregation in the Vicariate Apostolic. In May 1838, the General Council “considering that the brother employed in said missions must never be without a Superior to whom them might have recourse” provisionally decided that the Superior General would appoint a Brother as Superior, until the General chapter could take up the matter. They gave the appointed Superior the title of Provincial of the Missions in Oceania. In addressing this need the General Chapter of 1838 added several articles to the new Constitutions which Rome approved in 1840. Article 396 of the 1840 Constitutions defines the position. “...among the missionaries a priest will be designated who under the title of Provincial will be superior of all the members of the Congregation employed in this mission and to whom all will have resource for what concerns their duties as religious.”\n\nIn 1838 the Mission Province of America and Oceania was erected. The Superior General appointed Fr. François Caret, ss.cc. as Provincial. He became Vicar Apostolic of Southern Oceania in 1840. In 1845 Fr. Dosithé Desvault, ss.cc. succeeded him as Provincial.\n\nIn 1868 Hawai’i became an independent mission Province, with Fr. Modeste Favens, ss.cc. as the first Provincial Superior. In 1946 it became an ordinary province under the title Province of Hawai’i. On November 13, 2011 the Province of Hawai’i merged with the United States East Province to become the Province of the United States of America.\n\nFounded from Two Missions - USA East"
