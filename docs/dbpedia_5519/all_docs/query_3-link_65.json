        "text": "HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - Catholic Church officials in Honolulu announced Monday that they were suspending most gatherings, including Mass, through the end of March.\n\nThe closures go into effect Tuesday at noon.\n\nChurch officials will reevaluate the situation on March 27 before deciding on a new course of action.\n\nIn a statement, Bishop Larry Silva said that the closures were based on guidance the church had received from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other health experts.\n\n“The decision to cancel Masses is a very serious decision that was not taken lightly and that was made after consultation with the members of the Priests Council,” Silva said.\n\nIn addition to Mass cancellations, Silva issued guidance on several other items:\n\nFunerals and weddings that are already scheduled for this month may continue to take place, but families are encouraged to limit the number of guests.\n\nBaptisms are to be postponed.\n\nCommunal penance services are canceled.\n\nPastors are to do “all they can” to have churches open during the day for private prayer.\n\nSilva says Mass will be “celebrated without the congregation” and live-streamed from the Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Honolulu each Sunday."
