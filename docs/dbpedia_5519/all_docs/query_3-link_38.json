        "meta_description": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of Peace is said to be the oldest Catholic cathedral in continuous use in the United States and one of the oldest existing buildings in the downtown area. The Cathedral stands on land which was given to the missionaries by King Kamehameha III when the mission was established in 1827. The building was dedicated in 1843 and is made of simple coral stone blocks which were brought to the site from the Kaka‘ako shores. The Cathedral Basilica of Our Lady of Peace is the mother church of the Diocese of Honolulu and serves as a spiritual center for downtown Honolulu. It was home to Father Damien De Veuster, later Saint Damien who served the Molokai Hansen’s disease community for more than two decades, and Mother Marianne Cope, later Saint Marianne, who worshipped at the Cathedral upon her arrival in Hawai‘i. A relic of Saint Damien, a foot bone and the mortal remains of Saint Marianne are enshrined in the Cathedral Basilica.",

        "text": "We recognize the use of linguistic markings of the (modern) Hawaiian language including the ʻokina [‘] or glottal stop and the kahakō [ō] or macron (e.g., in place names of Hawaiʻi such as Lānaʻi). We acknowledge that individual businesses listed on this site may not use the ʻokina or kahakō, but we recognize the importance of using these markings to preserve the indigenous language and culture of Hawaiʻi and use them in all other forms of communications."
