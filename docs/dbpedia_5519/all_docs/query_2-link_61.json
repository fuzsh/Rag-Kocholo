        "text": "JOSEPH DUTTON CAUSE FOR CANONIZATION MOVES TO ROME!\n\nThe diocesan phase of Joseph Dutton’s cause was closed yesterday in Honolulu, Hawaii. It was during a special Mass, a moment for me that was filled with great joy but you could see some tears through the joy.\n\nOn December 18, I wrote about my just-concluded trip to Honolulu: When an historical commission for a cause of canonization has finished its work, the Vatican asks that all members meet within the diocese of the cause for canonization, and there is a specific agenda for that meeting, including the fact that each member of the commission presents a written report of their year or more of work on the cause, questions are asked of each one of us, and we must sign a number of documents in the presence of the diocesan notary.\n\nI was on the Historical Commission for the cause of canonization of Joseph Dutton and we finished our work in November and had our meeting in the diocese of Honolulu in December, as you know from what I have posted.\n\nI learned in December that, the commission’s work being done, Mass would be held on January 21 in Honolulu’s Our Lady of Peace cathedral to close the diocesan phase of the cause for Dutton, a huge moment on any path to canonization! Two copies of our reports would now go to Rome to be studied and evaluated by dicastery staff. One copy of the commission reports stays in the diocese that originated the cause.\n\nI knew only one thing. After years of work on the Dutton Guild and then almost a year of research for the Historical Commission, I would have to be at that January 21 Mass!\n\nHowever, the Lord had other plans. The back pain issues I have been suffering since my return from Hawaii, obviously meant that trip would not happen.\n\nThus, yesterday, January 21 was a day when I smiled through tears. Several of my dearest friends did a Face Time with me while waiting in the cathedral for Mass and I truly felt present because I’ve been there many times for Mass.\n\nThe noon Mass presided over by Bishop Larry Silva was streamed live so I was able to follow that, including a final half hour dedicated to the administrative matters that close a diocesan phase for a cause of canonization. I saw so many of my Hawaii friends, especially those on the Dutton Guild, such as Guild president Dr. Maria Devera, Pat Boland, a Guild member and member of the Historical Commission, and Msgr. Robert Sarno, episcopal delegate to Dutton’s cause.\n\nNow is the time for prayer. Prayer that the cause proceeds positively in Rome. Prayer that, through the intercession of Servant of God Joseph Dutton, a miracle occurs. One miracle is needed for beatification and a second miracle for canonization. That second miracle must occur after beatification.\n\nNo photos of yesterday’s Mass at this moment.\n\nThe following story almost seems miraculous!|\n\nLost Joseph Dutton collection found in Wisconsin parish rectory basement\n\nCLICK ON ABOVE TITLE TO READ FULL FASCINATING ARTICLE IN THE HAWAII CATHOLIC HERALD!\n\nHere’s the great website put together by the Dutton Guild of the diocese of Honolulu: https://www.josephdutton.org/\n\nVATICAN INSIDER: RESEARCHING A FUTURE SAINT: FR. JOHN PAUL KIMES\n\nI was a member of the Historical Commission for the Cause of Canonization of Servant of God Joseph Dutton who, as you know, worked for 44 years on Molokai with Saints Damien and Marianne caring for the victims of leprosy. When such a commission closes its work, a meeting must be held in the diocese of the cause for canonization with all members present. This is required by the dicastery for the causes of saints to which we our individual reports are sent.\n\nThus. two other members of that commission, Pat Boland of Honolulu and Fr.. John Paul Kimes, Canon law professor at the university of Notre Dame, and I met in Honolulu this past December to present our findings and work with Msgr. Robert Sarno, an advisor on the cause. One copy of the findings remain in the diocese of Honolulu and two are sent to Rome for further work by the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints.\n\nThough now retired, when he was on the staff of the dicastery (then the Congregation for Saints) in Rome, Msgr. Sarno also helped with the causes of St. Damien (canonized in 2009) and St. Marianne Cope (canonized in 2012).\n\nThe diocesan phase of the Joseph Dutton cause will close in Honolulu on January 21st, after which the Roman phase of his causes goes to work.\n\nYou have heard Fr, Kimes before but he is back this weekend with more riveting stories about the life and times of Servant of God Joseph Dutton, a man we both hope and pray will one day join Damien and Marianne at the honors of the altar.\n\nThis is a photo of Msgr. Sarno, Fr. Kimes and me at our special fund-raising event on Honolulu in November 2022.\n\nHere we are at dinner in Honolulu (Duke’s restaurant) this past December with Dr. Maria Devera, president of the Joseph Dutton Guild in Honolulu. I am also on that guild.\n\nI simply love this photo of Maria DeVera and me with Audrey Toguchi. It was Audrey’s miraculous cure of cancer through the intercession of Blessed Fr. Damien that led to his canonization in 2009. Audrey and I first met in July 2008 and have been good friends ever since: I see her during every trip I make to the islands (December was my 12th!), often with her husband Yuki. She is a lovely nonagenarian and a living history book on the Hawaiian islands. Audrey is the grandmother at whose knees you always want to sit and listen to her stories!\n\nThis was in the latest edition of the Hawaii Catholic Herald:\n\nCanonization cause for Joseph Dutton proceeds to Rome\n\nAs you may know, I am on the Historical Commission for the Cause of Canonization of Servant of God Joseph Dutton who worked for 44 years on Molokai with Saints Damien and Marianne caring for the victims of leprosy. When such a commission closes its work, a meeting must be held in the diocese of the cause for canonization with all members present. This is required by the dicastery for the causes of saints to which we will send our report.\n\nI leave tomorrow for Honolulu for several days of work with other members of the commission. I fly to Newark, spend the night and then take United’s 8:30 am nonstop flight to Honolulu – half way around the world from Rome – 12 time zones!\n\nI doubt I’ll have time to post a blog, but you never know.! In any case, you might check my Facebook and Twitter/X pages.\n\nPOPE TO DONATE GOLDEN ROSE TO ANCIENT ROMAN ICON OF BLESSED VIRGIN MARY\n\nOn the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, Pope Francis will pay homage to the Blessed Virgin Mary with a Golden Rose placed at the feet of the ancient Roman icon of ‘Maria Salus Populi Romani’.\n\nBy Vatican News\n\nPope Francis will venerate Our Lady with a Golden Rose for the Marian icon of the Salus Populi Romani in the Basilica of St. Mary Major on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception.\n\nHe will travel to the Basilica on 8 December to accomplish this historic gesture which has not been performed in 400 years.\n\nIn the afternoon, as is traditional, the Pope will perform an Act of Veneration to the Blessed Virgin Mary before the statue of the Immaculate Conception in Rome’s central Piazza di Spagna.\n\nJust ahead of that visit, he will stop at the papal basilica of St. Mary Major with his gift for Our Lady.\n\nAn ancient gift\n\nThe Golden Rose has ancient roots, symbolising the papal blessing, and the tradition of this gift dates back to the Middle Ages. Over the centuries, it has been given to monasteries, shrines, sovereigns, and prominent personalities in recognition of their commitment to faith and the common good.\n\nAs explained by a statement issued by the Basilica, with the gift of the Rose to the Salus Populi Romani, “Pope Francis highlights the spiritual importance and profound significance that this icon holds in the life of the Catholic Church, as it is also the oldest Marian shrine in the West dedicated to the Mother of God.”\n\nhttps://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2023-12/pope-immaculate-conception-gift-golden-rose-salus-populi-romani.html\n\nFYI: Here is a great piece from the University of Dayton on the fascinating history of the Golden Rose, : https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/g/golden-rose.php\n\nVATICAN INSIDER’S SPECIAL GUEST: BISHOP SILVA OF HONOLULU\n\nTune in this weekend when my guest in the interview segment is Bishop Larry Silva of Honolulu. As you know I spent part of my summer vacation in beautiful Hawaii, a place I’ve fallen in love with since my first visit in 2008 to cover the life and times of then Blessed Damein of Molokai who would be canonized in 2009. Subsequent visits were to report on St. Marianne Cope and the astonishing story of a man who worked with both Damien and Marianne, Brother Joseph Dutton. Some first steps are being taken to look into the life of Dutton and a possible cause for canonization.\n\nAmong other things, Bishop Larry talks about the renovation of the Honolulu cathedral and some big anniversaries for the Church in Hawaii – the 175th anniversary of the cathedral of Our Lady of Peace, the 100th anniverary of the death of St. Marianane and the 180th anniversary of her birth.\n\nA little piece of trivia about the Hawaiian language: it has all 5 vowels but only 7 consonants – H, K, L, M, N, P and W.\n\nHere are some of the photos I took during an evening visit to the cathedral with Bishop Larry and a priest friend from California. As you’ll hear Bishop Larry explain, there are wonderful plans to renovate parts of this old and lovely church, as well as to create a separate area, a mini chapel, if you will, to house the relics of Saints Damien and Marianne that are currently in the cathedral.\n\nOur Lady of Peace –\n\nRelics of St. Marianne and St. Damien –\n\nI took the following two photos last summer before the altar was moved forward and the pews moved to face the altar.\n\nAs shown in this renovation plan, the pews now face the altar –\n\nHere you can see what the cathedral will look like after cleaning and restoration –\n\nThe original altar is now behind a see-through screen which will be permanently removed: the current altar has been moved forward from its earlier position in the center of the church:\n\nBishop Silva’s grandparents were baptized at this font –\n\nIn this rendition, you can see the small side chapel that will be built to house the relics of Hawaii’s two saints –\n\nIn the United States, you can listen to Vatican Insider (VI) on a Catholic radio station near you (there is a list of U.S. stations at www.ewtn.com) or on channel 130 Sirius-XM satellite radio.
