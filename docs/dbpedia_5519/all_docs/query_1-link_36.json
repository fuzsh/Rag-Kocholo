        "text": "October in global missions history: It happened today!\n\nOn this date in world evangelism outreach\n\n\"Since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses . . .\" -- Hebrews 12:1\n\nSignificant events, locations, people, and movements in world evangelism\n\nOctober 1, 1883 -- Former Presbyterian minister A. B. Simpson opened the Missionary Training School for Christian Evangelists (which would later be re-named The New York Missionary Training College).\n\nOctober 2, 1792 -- A dozen English ministers formed the Baptist Missionary Society \"for the propagation of the Gospel among the Heathen, according to the recommendations of [William] Carey's Enquiry.\"\n\nOctober 3, 1954 -- Herbert and Alice Ratcliff arrived in British Guinea (now Guyana) as missionaries. They served in Guyana and various Caribbean islands for more than 30 years.\n\nOctober 4, 1930 -- British missionaries Eleanor June Harrison and Edith Nettleton were beheaded in China. They had been abducted in July at Chungan in Fujian province. Their ransom was originally set at $500,000. When the ransom was not forthcoming, the bandits cut off one of Miss Nettleton's fingers and sent it along with the same ransom demand to the provincial authorities. The Church Missionary Society authorized a representative to pay $10,000 in gold for the women's release. The bandits received the money, but, believing that they had been betrayed when provincial troops attacked them, the outlaws killed the two missionaries.\n\nOctober 5, 1744 -- David Brainerd, who had been expelled from Yale for criticizing a tutor and attending a forbidden revival meeting, began missionary work with Native Americans along New Jersey's Susquehanna River. Jonathan Edwards' biography of Brainerd was very influential in promoting world missions activity. That biography was an important book in the spiritual journey of William Carey.\n\nOctober 6, 1861 -- Tai Ping rebels in Yantai, Shantung Province, China, murder missionary J. Landrum Holmes.\n\nOctober 7, 1873 -- Southern Baptist missionary hero Lottie Moon reached China. Later, she would write: \"If I had a thousand lives, I would give them all for the women of China.\"\n\nOctober 8, 1853 -- Miles Justin Knowlton was ordained as a Baptist minister. Soon afterward he sailed as a missionary for Ningpo, China. In 1871, while on a visit to the United States, Knowlton wrote a prize-winning essay titled \"China as a Mission Field.\" He also delivered a lecture series at several theological seminaries that was published under the title The Foreign Missionary, His Field, and His Work.\n\nOctober 9, 258 -- During a period of persecution unleashed by the emperor Decius, a missionary named Denis, who had been sent to Gaul (modern-day France), was arrested along with two other church leaders. All three were beheaded in an area of modern-day Paris now called Montmartre (Martyrs' Hill). Their bodies were thrown into the Seine River.\n\nOctober 10, 644 -- Paulinus, missionary and First Archbishop of York, died. In 627, Paulinus' preaching led to the conversion of King Edwin of Northumbria (roughly the northern quarter of modern England)\n\nOctober 11, 2002 -- The Lutheran Church (Missouri Synod) reported that their missionaries are safe amid Cote d'Ivoire fighting in a military uprising that began there Sept. 19.\n\nOctober 12, 2000 -- In India, K.S. Sudarshan told members of his Hindu nationalist group, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), that the Indian government should expel all foreign churches and set up a state church similar to the government-controlled church in China.\n\nOctober 13, 1799 -- A party of new missionaries arrived in India to join with William Carey. Among the new arrivals were Joshua and Hannah Marshman, with their three children, and William Ward.\n\nOctober 14, 1829 -- Alexander and Ann Duff sailed from London for India aboard the Lady Holland. They were the first missionaries of the Church of Scotland to India. The ship was wrecked near Cape Town, South Africa. The Duffs lost everything except the clothes on their backs and their Bible and Psalm book. In May -- eight months and another shipwreck later -- they arrived in Calcutta praising God for the hardships. Duff founded an English-speaking college. By 1844, he had a thousand students.\n\nOctober 15, 1932 -- A small party of supporters gathered in Liverpool, England, to send Gladys Aylward, a 28-year-old parlormaid, off on a dangerous missionary journey to China. Though she'd been turned down by the missions agency she applied to, she went on to become one of the most amazing single-woman missionaries of modern history. Her dramatic rescue of a hundred orphans is told in the movie \"The Inn of the Sixth Happiness.\" [ more on Aylward ]\n\nOctober 16, 1877 -- William Taylor, who had been a Methodist missionary to South Africa and India, sailed for South America to see if the ideas on self-support he had been expounding would work there as well. He taught that when missionaries insisted on establishing structures that were expensive to maintain, they made it impossible for a church to achieve independence and vitality. Eventually, this eminent missions thinker would have a university -- Taylor University in Upland, Indiana -- named after him.\n\nOctober 17, 1895 -- Peter Cameron Scott's Africa Inland Mission team arrived in Mombasa, Kenya. Scott pressed inland to share the gospel and plant missions. Peter contracted blackwater fever. He died on December 8, 1896. After his death, his teammates also died one by one. Others came to replace them, some carrying their supplies in coffins! Such dedication eventually opened the hearts of the Africans.\n\nOctober 18, 1855 -- Francis McDougall was officially named leader of Anglican work in Labuan and Sarawak. He had initially turned down an opportunity to go to Borneo as a missionary. Later, he repented of that decision and, in December 1847, sailed for the mission field. Francis was a pioneer in medical missions. His supervisors actually thought he was stepping out of line when he began to tend to the sick. He had little success among the Muslim Malays who were overlords to much of Borneo. He did better among the Chinese traders who had settled Borneo but best among the indigenous Dyaks. Among McDougall's achievements was a Book of Common Prayer and Catechism in Malay.\n\nOctober 19, 1893 -- John Livingston Nevius, Presbyterian missionary to China, passed away. He is well known for promoting the concept that mission work should aim, from the very beginning, to establish self-propagating, self-supporting, self-governing indigenous churches. Nevius' writings include The Planting and Development of Missionary Churches. [ more on the three selfs ]\n\nOctober 20, 1833 -- Dr. Justin Perkins arrived in Urmi (northwestern Iran) as the first American missionary in that area.\n\nOctober 21, 1944 -- Alois Kayser (born 1877 in Alsace) died in Chuuk where he had been deported by the Japanese. Kayser was a German Roman Catholic missionary who spent almost 40 years on Nauru and wrote a Nauruan grammar (and possibly a Nauruan dictionary). The government of Nauru had named a technical school after Kayser.\n\nOctober 22, 1941 -- Presbyterian missionary Bruce Hunt was arrested and imprisoned in Manchuria by Japanese occupying forces. The 38-year-old father of five was released on December 5, after 45 days of imprisonment. While reluctantly preparing to return to the States, he was arrested again two days later, in the wake of the Pearl Harbor attack. He was then sent to a concentration camp, where he grew weak and sick from semi-starvation. He was finally freed as part of a prisoner exchange.\n\nOctober 23, 2003 -- Yakup Cindilli, a Turkish convert to Christianity was severely beaten for distributing New Testaments in his hometown of Orhangazi in northwestern Turkey. Yakup Cindilli's interest in Christianity had begun when he made a telephone call to \"Alo Dua\", a prayer hotline ministry organized by Turkish Christians after a devastating 1999 earthquake in their country.\n\nOctober 24, 1869 -- Scottish Presbyterian missionary John Paton held the first Communion service on the small island of Aniwa (part of what is now Vanuatu). Paton eventually saw all the islanders on Aniwa become at least nominally Christian.\n\nOctober 25, 1933 -- John and Elisabeth Stam were married in Jinan, China. A year later they would be taken hostage by communist forces. The Red Army took the Stams and many Chinese captives to nearby Miaosha. John wrote a letter to the China Inland Mission (CIM) headquarters, saying they would be released in exchange for $20,000. He closed the letter, \"God give you wisdom in what you do and give us grace and fortitude. He is able.\" The next day, John and Elisabeth were executed by decapitation. The Stams' death was later cited by many Americans as an event that caused them to become missionaries.\n\nOctober 26, 1966 -- The first World Congress on Evangelism opened in West Berlin, attracting approximately 600 delegates from about 100 countries.\n\nOctober 27, 1874 -- Presbyterian missionary Mary Parker wrote in her diary that on this day a Japanese believer named Takahashi was sending a letter to a Japanese government ministry asking for the right to bury Christian Japanese \"according to our way.\"\n\nOctober 28, 1646 -- At Nonantum, Massachusetts, missionary John Eliot preached the first worship service for Native Americans in their native language.\n\nOctober 29, 1885 -- English missionary James Hannington was murdered in Uganda\n\nOctober 30, 1838 - In a letter, Marcus Whitman, missionary to Native Americans in the Northwest part of the U.S., announced the safe arrival of several missionary reinforcements and discussed how best to deploy them. In addition to providing updates on the Waiilatpu mission, Whitman described a plan to obtain a printing press from Hawaii and mentioned his desire to build a grist mill.\n\nOctober 31, 1825 -- George Muller, who founded orphanages in Great Britain that would house more than 10,000 orphans, converted to Christianity at a Moravian mission. Muller's living-by-faith approach to finances became a key inspiration for Hudson Taylor (China Inland Mission) and other \"faith\" mission leaders.\n\n-- compiled by Howard Culbertson,\n\nIt happened on this date in January | February | March | April | May | June | July | August | September | October | November | December\n\nYou might also like these\n\nBrief world missions history\n\nGlobal outreach year-by-year\n\nReflections on world missions history\n\nWorld missions history crossword puzzle\n\nEvangelizing the Barbarians (400 to 800 AD)\n\nEvangelizing the Vikings (800 to 1200 AD)\n\nMonastic missionary strategy (1200 to 1600 AD)\n\nWorld evangelism from 1600 to the present\n\nPowerPoint: Epochs of world missionary outreach\n\nMore on world missions history"
