        "text": "A chronology of events in He‘eia. This chronology includes relevant incidents both in He‘eia and in O‘ahu more generally—and in some cases, in the Hawaiian Islands as a whole.\n\nThis is not a comprehensive time line, and recommendations for additions are welcome.\n\nKing Kamehameha III institutes the partitioning of lands, later known as the 1848 Mahele. Through these legal acts, Abner Pākī receives the ahupua‘a of He‘eia with the exception of the ‘Ili of ‘Ioleka‘a. Victoria Kamamalu receives 140 acres, the Catholic Mission receives 216.50 acres and Makekehau receives 14.65 acres.\n\nAbner Pākī dies on June 13, leaving his lands in He‘eia to his daughter Bernice Pauahi Bishop.\n\nFor $870, John and William Sumner buy the ‘ili of Mōkapu.\n\nPauahi sells 772 acres “from the top of Ma‘eli‘eli peak” to Catholic Bishop Maigret for $970.00.\n\nSixteen year-old Joseph Paul Mendonça comes to Hawai‘i from the Azore Islands, 1,500 miles off the coast of Portugal. One of his leases was Mōkapu Peninsula, where he became a primary shareholder in the 1893 Kāne‘ohe Ranch Company,\n\nPauahi leases 2,500 acres in He‘eia for 15 years to John McKeague for growing sugar. McKeague formed the He‘eia Sugar Company and extended the lease in 1869 for an additional 13 years.\n\nMcKeague mortgages his lease to Hackfield and Co. and deeds half-interest in his lease to Alexander Kennedy, his partner in the He‘eia Sugar Plantation Co.\n\nBernice Pauahi Bishop leases land to Chinese rice farmers in He‘eia: Wing Wo Tai Company.\n\nSt. Anns church, under Fr. Mattias Limburg, SS.CC., establishes a boarding school for eight boys. The following year, a regular day school was started for boys and girls. The McCabe family was instrumental in running the school until the arrival of the Maryknoll Sisters in 1927.\n\nMcKeague sells all of his interest in He‘eia lease to He‘eia Sugar Plantation Co. [HSPC] for $1.00 and a new lease is written between HSPC, Ltd. and Charles Reed Bishop for much of the land in He‘eia.\n\nThe lease is augmented for the lands already had, and grants the company all traditional konohiki rights to fisheries and seas appertaining to He‘eia, including the loko, Moku o Lo‘e (Coconut Island) and Ha‘ikū Valley.\n\nA railroad was installed for the sugar company.\n\nHawaiian Monarchy forcibly overthrown by a handful of non-Hawaiian businessmen. Efforts by the deposed Queen, Liliuokalani, to restore Hawaiian sovereignty were unsuccessful. U.S. President Cleveland chose not to annex the islands. The provisional government declared the independent Republic of Hawaii. After the Spanish-American War and the acquisition of the Philippines, President McKinley chose to annex the Hawaiian Islands, which became the U.S. Territory of Hawai‘i.\n\nKea‘ahala Military Reservation created when the federal government acquired the land, which had been surveyed by the Territory for homesteads. The military reservation had been intended for use as camp site for a brigade-sized unit when on maneuvers, but the land was never utilized.\n\nFrom around 1915, Arthur H. Rice, Sr., uses a lease on the ‘ili of Heleloa from Harold K.L. Castle and an arrangement with Wally Davis for the ‘ili of Mōkapu to run cattle on the peninsula, as well as cultivate commercial crops. He also had pigs and horses.\n\nThrough Executive Order 2900, President Woodrow Wilson designates 322 acres in the central portion of Mōkapu Peninsula as the U.S. Army’s Kuwaaohe Military Reservation. Deactivated at the end of World War I, the reservation was leased for ranching until 1939, when it was reactivated as Fort Kuwaaohe.\n\nTerritorial Governor executed Executive Order 112 to establish a game farm on 345 acres on the north side of the Mōkapu fishponds. Between 1921 and 1928, 1,200 Mongolian pheasants were hatched. In the 1930s, over 40,000 game birds were raised and released. At the end of the decade, over 60,000 birds had been released to six different islands, with 18,409 birds still at the farm in early 1941.\n\nUnder Presidential (Coolidge) Executive Order No. 4036, 141 acres of Kāne‘ohe land consisting of the Keaahala Military Reservation were turned over to the Territory of Hawaii from the federal government for the construction of an insane asylum that would become the Hawaii State Hospital. Building construction at the new hospital got underway in late 1926.\n\nMōkapu tract subdivision gets underway. Samuel Wilder King, Bishop Trust Co., Ltd., and A.H. Rice & Co., Ltd., subdivided the ‘ili of Mōkapu into parcels ranging from a quarter acre to just over a full acre. Prices ranged from $1,200 to $3,000 for beach lots and $500 to $900 for inland parcels.\n\nDredging of the Bay was done to accommodate small boat landings, piers, and wharfs. The dredged material was used for landfill at the Kāne‘ohe Naval Air Station (now Kāne‘ohe Marine Corps Air Station). Between 1946 and 1948, nine fishponds on the south side of Kāne‘ohe Bay (total area of almost 80 acres) were filled with dredged materials for urban development.\n\nFort Kuwaaohe on Mōkapu renamed Fort Hase, in honor of Major General William F. Hase, who served as Chief of Staff of the Army’s Hawaiian Department from April 1934 to January 1935. It serves as headquarters of the Harbor Defenses of Kāne‘ohe Bay.\n\nNavy begins acquiring more land on the peninsula, ultimately condemning the privately\n\nheld lots in the Mōkapu Tract Subdivision. The residents of the western peninsula were given notice that they had three months to surrender their homes.\n\nSaint Stephen Seminary founded when the Diocese of Honolulu obtained the 22 acre estate of Harold K.L. Castle, which was built in 1927. It is located above Maunawili valley in the Koolaupoko district and was staffed by the Sulpician Fathers. The seminary closed in 1970.\n\nBishop Estate considers selling the He‘eia meadowlands (Hoi) for $25 million dollars to a Japanese investor whose intent was to build a golf course. Effort is stopped by community outrage.\n\nFriends of He‘eia, acquires the two main buildings at Ke‘alohi Point."
