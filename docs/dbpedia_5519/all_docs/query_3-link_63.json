        "text": "I am the first born of six children of Joseph Kobla Apetorgbor and Ama Kuma Asuo. I had my priestly training at St. Victor’s Major Seminary, Tamale, Ghana and was ordained in the Diocese of Damongo, Ghana. After my ordination on July 22, 1995, I did further studies at the Ruhr-University Bochum in Germany while simultaneously serving in various ministries throughout Germany.\n\nSince my ordination, I have served as a pastor, parochial vicar, diocesan youth chaplain and vocation director, lecturer and formator at a major seminary, rector of a Minor Seminary Senior High School and administrator of a diocese. All these, I served throughout in Ghana.\n\nAfter completing a wonderful sabbatical program at the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas in 2011, I proceeded to Hawaii in December 2011. After a few days at Our Lady of Good Counsel, Pearl City, I served one and a half years at St. Jude Parish, Kapolei.\n\nI am happy to be back in Hawaii and I am equally happy for the opportunity to serve the wonderful parishioners of St. Catherine’s Parish. I feel very welcome here and I am very grateful for the warm reception. May the Lord continue to bless us with unity and love!\n\nI was born in Butuan City in 1962 in the Philippines to Primo and Editha Sescon Sanchez. My younger sister, Maria Corazon and I were raised surrounded by my large family in Butuan City.\n\nI was ordained July 19, 1994 in the Diocese of Butuan, Philippines. I often traveled far in my ministry because the parishes had many Chapels. I served as a Parochial Vicar, Pastor and Priest in residence till 2013 in a number of parishes in the Diocese of Butuan.\n\nI established close relationships with parishioners by interacting with them in the everyday life of my parish. Celebrating Masses was followed by sumptuous meals and games with the youth and an occasional trip to the city.\n\nIn 2013, Bishop Larry invited me to serve in Honolulu Diocese where I began my ministry as a hospital chaplain. I did the chaplaincy ministry on Oahu for 11 years serving four hospitals.\n\nIn 2017, I also was assigned as the Chaplain for the Visayan Community in St. Anthony Church in Kalihi.\n\nI was fortunate to fully recover from a cardiac surgery in 2018. I attribute a change in eating habits and exercise for my present good health.\n\nI enjoy playing basketball and singing karaoke with fellow priests.\n\nBishop Larry assigned me as Parochial Vicar at St. Catherine of Alexandria Parish in Kapaa, Kauai on July 1, 2024. Upon arrival, I was very warmly received by parishioners. I am happy to continue my ministry in St Catherine of Alexandria Parish and look forward to a fruitful ministry.\n\nMy name is Alejandrino Andy Ragasa, Jr. I was ordained a permanent deacon for the Diocese of Honolulu on February 19, 2021. Upon my ordination, the Honorable Bishop Larry Silva assigned me to diaconal service at St. Catherine of Alexandria.\n\nI was born in the rural plantation town of North Kohala on the Island of Hawaii on February 22, 1961. I attended and graduated from Kohala High School (Go Cowboys!) in 1979. Upon graduation, I enrolled in the University of Hawaii at Manoa and was accepted to the College of Engineering. I earned my BS degree in Civil Engineering from UH-Manoa in 1984. My first engineering job was with M&E Pacific, Inc. in Honolulu from 1984 to 1989 as a design engineer. In 1989, I passed the board exam and became a Licensed Professional Civil Engineer in the State of Hawaii. I switched jobs and went to work for Koga Engineering & Construction, Inc. where I worked my way up from Project Engineer to Project Manager to Island Manager to Vice President of Kauai Operations. I moved from Oahu to manage our Kauai operations at the start of 1996 and recently retired at the end of 2020 after 31+ years at Koga Engineering.\n\nI got married to the love of my life, Inocenta Acosta Ragasa, on June 22, 2013 at Immaculate Conception Church in Lihue. We live in Lihue and together we have two sons and two daughters from our previous marriages – Christiaan, Carlos , Kelcie, and Dayna. We have also been blessed with a granddaughter, Camille (Kelcie’s), born in September 2019.\n\nIn my spare time, I like to golf, garden, and travel…not necessarily in that order. I also love to spend time with our granddaughter along with our pet dogs (Simba and Hokulani) and cats (Popoki and Eleele). I was ordained a deacon to serve and that is exactly what I intend to do, not only for the faith community at St. Catherine of Alexandria but for the entire Island of Kauai and the Diocese of Honolulu. “As for me and my household, we will serve the LORD.” (Joshua 24:15)"
