        "text": "The Episcopal Diocese of Hawai‘i consists of 35 worshipping communities on five islands. About half of these can be found on the island of O‘ahu, where Honolulu, the capital of Hawai‘i, is located. Other churches are distributed on the islands of Kaua‘i, Maui, Moloka‘i, and Hawai‘i Island (“the Big Island”). The following is an alphabetical listing of our churches by island. ​If a church name is highlighted in blue, it is linked to their website. If a name is highlighted, it is linked to a form that will generate an email message to that person. To jump to an island's listing click on the buttons below. We begin at the top of the island chain and travel south.\n\nKAUA‘​I: The Garden Island\n\n(Color: Purple, Flower/Plant: Mokihana Berry)\n\nThere are five Episcopal Churches on Kaua‘i. In the town of Kapa‘a, All Saints' was the first Episcopal Church built in 1925, followed by Christ Memorial in Kilauea. Both buildings utilize the native lava rock stone in its structure and feature magnificent hand-crafted stained glass windows. On the western side of the island, St. John’s in ‘Ele‘ele and St. Paul’s in Kekaha were built in the early 1940s, and now make up The Episcopal Church on West Kaua‘i (ECWK). The newest and largest Episcopal Church on Kaua‘i is St. Michael and All Angels, located in Lihu‘e. It was dedicated in 1991, with an open and contemporary feel to its structure. The oldest and fourth largest of the main Hawaiian Islands, Kaua‘i has been given the name “The Garden Island” with Mount Wai‘ale‘ale, one of the wettest spots in the world feeding the countless streams, waterfalls and the only navigable rivers in Hawai'i.\n\nO‘AHU: The Gathering Place\n\n​(Color: Yellow, Flower/Plant: ‘Ilima)\n\nThere are 20 Episcopal Churches and two preaching stations located on O‘ahu, including The Cathedral of Saint Andrew, the first Anglican Church founded in the mid-1800s by King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. Nestled in the heart of downtown Honolulu, it is surrounded by historic buildings such as ‘Iolani Palace, and more contemporary landmarks such as the State Capital Building. The third largest of the Hawaiian Islands, O‘ahu is home to nearly 70% of the entire population (1.3 million) of the State of Hawai‘i. The church communities on O‘ahu are as diverse as their neighborhoods. With the continuing influx of immigrants from around the Pacific Basin and beyond, several churches feature special services catering to different ethnic groups, such as Samoan, Micronesian, Filipino, Korean and Chinese.\n\nMAUI: The Valley Isle\n\n(Color: Pink, Flower/Plant: Lokelani Rose)\n\n​There are four Episcopal Churches on Maui located in the main towns of the island that include the Church of the Good Shepherd in Wailuku, Holy Innocents in Lahaina, St. John’s Episcopal Church in Kula, and Trinity By-The-Sea in Kihei. Maui is the second largest of the main Hawaiian Islands, with a population of over 144,000. Named “The Valley Isle” because of the many large valleys carved into its mountains and the large isthmus that was created between two (now dormant) volcanoes. One of these volcanoes, Haleakala, is more than 10,000 feet above sea level, making it one of the world’s highest mountains. The magnificent Humpback whales spend the winter months mating and birthing in the channels of Maui before heading back to Alaska for their annual migration."
