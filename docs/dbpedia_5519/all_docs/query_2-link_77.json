        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nIntro\n\nDefining Holy Days\n\nHoly Days by the Vatican\n\nUS Holy Days\n\nHoly Days in Different Countries\n\nImportant Days that are Not Holy Days of Obligation\n\nFAQ about Holy Days of Obligation\n\nHow many Holy Days of Obligation can you name?\n\nYour answer probably depends on where you live.\n\nAnd when you were born.\n\nThe Catholic Church has such a rich history, and Holy Days of Obligation represent but a small part of the Church’s story. However, what they celebrate shines a light on the most beautiful truths of our faith.\n\nThey’re not merely requirements. Holy Days of Obligation might better be known as Holy Days of Opportunity–the chance to grow in faith and encounter God through the most important tenets of our faith.\n\nLet Hallow help guide you through everything you need to know about Holy Days of Obligation in the Catholic Church.\n\nWhat Is a Holy Day of Obligation?\n\nRather than defining Holy Days by what’s required (Mass attendance and a refrain from unnecessary work), we might think about Holy Days of Obligation by what they offer: beautiful reminders of important ways God has shown His love for us.\n\nThese are important days in the liturgical year in which we recognize God’s love for us. They require us to attend Mass, just as we’re obligated to attend Mass each week on Sundays.\n\nThe 10 Holy Days According to Canon Law\n\nHoly Days have a long history in the Church. In 1642, Pope Urban reduced the number of Holy Days of Obligation to 36.\n\nIn the 1917 Code of Canon Law, The Vatican listed the following 10 days as Holy Days of Obligation:\n\nNativity of our Lord Jesus Christ (Christmas)\n\nThe Epiphany\n\nThe Ascension\n\nThe Body and Blood of Christ (“Corpus Christi”)\n\nHoly Mary Mother of God\n\nImmaculate Conception\n\nAssumption\n\nSt. Joseph\n\nSaints Peter and Paul\n\nAll Saints\n\nThe Vatican also gave conferences of bishops the power to suppress Holy Days or transfer them to Sundays (meaning a person could attend Mass on Sunday and fulfill the obligation for the Holy Day.)\n\nThis means that Holy Days vary slightly by country.\n\nHoly Days of Obligation in the United States in 2024\n\nIn 1991, the USCCB decreed the following Holy Days of Obligation, suppressing days like the Feasts of St. Joseph and Saints Peter and Paul and celebrating the Epiphany on a Sunday each year to come up with the following list of Holy Days of Obligation for American Catholics:\n\nJanuary 1, the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God\n\nMay 9 (Thursday of the Sixth Week of Easter) the Solemnity of the Ascension\n\nAugust 15, the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary\n\nNovember 1, the Solemnity of All Saints\n\nDecember 8, the Solemnity of the Immaculate Conception\n\nDecember 25, the Solemnity of the Nativity of Our Lord Jesus Christ\n\nAdditionally, the bishops decreed that when the Solemnity of Mary, the Assumption and All Saints fall on Saturdays or Mondays, the obligation to attend Mass on that day is canceled. Catholics can attend Mass regularly on Sunday. This is the case in 2024, with Jan. 1, the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, falling on a Monday. Catholics are not obligated to attend Mass on New Year’s Day in 2024.\n\nThe Epiphany has been permanently transferred to the first Sunday after January 1 in the U.S.\n\nFinally, there are even differences in how each diocese handles Holy Days. In 2022 for example, certain archdioceses in the U.S. observed the Ascension on Thursday as a Holy Day of Obligation, while others “transferred” it to Sunday and observed the day then.\n\nFurther, within the U.S., Hawaii has aligned its calendar with the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific (CEPAC).\n\nAccording to the USCBB, “In a decree dated March 23, 1992, the Bishop of Honolulu designated Christmas and the Immaculate Conception as the only two Holydays of Obligation for the State of Hawaii.”\n\nHoly Days in Different Countries\n\nThere is even more variety in Holy Days of Obligation because some countries recognize Holy Days outside of the list the Vatican prescribed.\n\nOn May 17, 1846, U.S. bishops adopted Mary, under the title of her Immaculate Conception–as the country’s patron saint.\n\nElsewhere, countries celebrate their patron saints on Holy Days of Obligation.\n\nIn Ireland, the Feast of St. Patrick is a Holy Day of Obligation; Mexico recognizes Our Lady of Guadalupe as a Holy Day.\n\nDays That Are Not Holy Days of Obligation\n\nThere are several important liturgical observances and holidays that might seem like they are Holy Days of Obligation but actually are not.\n\nThat list includes:\n\nAsh Wednesday\n\nHoly Thursday\n\nGood Friday\n\nThanksgiving\n\nOf course, you can still go to church on these days!\n\nCommonly Asked Questions about Holy Days of Obligation\n\nMore Catholic Prayer Resources"
