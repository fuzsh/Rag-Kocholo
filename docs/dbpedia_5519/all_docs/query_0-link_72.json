        "text": "Welcome to the official website for the Holy Theotokos of Iveron Orthodox Church. We are a small thriving multi-ethnic Christian parish here in the Hawaiian Islands, striving to both live the Gospel of Our Lord Jesus Christ and spread the ancient Orthodox Christian Faith to the people of Hawaii. Stop by for a visit if you are new to the islands or wish to experience the oldest living Christian Tradition on earth. Services are primarily conducted in English, with Hawaiian, Old Church Slavonic, Romanian and Greek added in.\n\nAll are welcome!\n\nAfter over a hundred years of much struggle and fervent prayer, the Russian Orthodox Church's Mission in Hawaii has a church to call her own. We would like to humbly thank everyone for helping us to make this once far-fetched dream a reality. May the Grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the intercessions of the Most holy Theotokos be with all of you.\n\nIf you would like to become a STEWARD of our parish, please consider filling out a PLEDGE CARD and mailing it to our church's new address (provided below). We have a large mortgage and many new expenses, not to mention the struggles of the after-effects of the Coronavirus pandemic, of which we suffered greatly, any help you can offer is greatly appreciated.\n\nMay it be returned to you a hundred fold!\n\nHoly Theotokos of Iveron Orthodox Church\n\n201 N. Kainalu Drive\n\nKailua (Honolulu), Hawaii 96734\n\nUSA\n\nOur Orthodox Community of Hawaii warmly welcomes our new Deacon, Father Seraphim Andov and his family.\n\nFather Deacon Seraphim received his Bachelor of Theology at Holy Trinity Orthodox Seminary in Jordanville, New York, and his Master of Theology at Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Brookline, Massachusetts.\n\nFather Deacon Seraphim is assigned to the Holy Theotokos of Iveron Orthodox Church in Hawaii, and will assist Father Nectarios in the Divine Services, Bible Study, Catechism and teaching the Law of God at the Parish's Saturday Parochial School.\n\nPlease welcome them with open arms, showing them our Aloha Spirit!\n\nPlease click on the link above (the photo) to help support the Ukrainian Relief Effort. All monies collected will go towards assisting the persecuted Ukrainian Orthodox Church in her care of the suffering People of Ukraine. May the Holy Mother of God protect His Beatitiude Metropolitan Onuphry, His Eminence Metropolitan Longin (under trial), His Eminence Metropolitan Pavel (under house arrest) and the monastics and seminarians of the Kiev Caves Lavra and all the oppressed and suffering Orthodox Chrisatian faithful in the Ukrainian Lands!\n\nRita Madden, MPH, RDN, is the Nutrition Director for Mediterranean Wellness, a company that focuses on sensible weight loss/management and chronic disease prevention/management. She completed her graduate work in public-health nutrition at Loma Linda University. She has an excellent podcast on the subject of food, health, and the Eastern Orthodox Faith on Ancient Faith Radio, click here: PODCAST\n\nShe also conducts online workshops on this subject matter around the country. To learn more about her workshops, click here: WORKSHOPS\n\nRita is devoted to helping people form a healthy relationship with food. Rita is also a beloved member of our parish, and Head Sister of our parish sisterhood.\n\nEach Wednesday Night we will be chanting an akathist for the building of our church and for various needs. The Akathists will be dedicated to the Most Holy Theotokos and Ever-Virgin Mary, St. John Maximovitch, St. Luke the Surgeon, and various other saints.\n\nEvery Wednesday Night, 6:15pm (See calendar)\n\nThe Orthodox Church is the original Church, founded by Jesus Christ, continuing down the centuries to our times without addition or subtraction, as our Lord promised.\n\nThis claim may amaze some people. They will say, How can this be possible? So many centuries have passed! And, look, there are so many churches, with good and sincere members, each one different from the other in its beliefs and worship, each one thinking it is right... (Click here)"
