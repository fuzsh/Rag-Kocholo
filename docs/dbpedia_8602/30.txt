Tribalistas are a Brazilian super group consisting of Arnaldo Antunes (ex-Tit√£s), Marisa Monte and Carlinhos Brown of Timbalada.

Their debut collaboration resulted in the popular album 'Tribalistas', released in Brazil in 2002 by EMI and in international territories in 2003. The album attained considerable popularity despite the group never performing any song on TV or giving any radio interviews.

In August 2017, the band officially announced their reunion and released a new album of the same name, which reach #1 in Brazil and Portugal.

Now in 2018, Tribalistas head to Hammersmith Apollo for a huge November show. Catch them live by checking out the tour dates and concert ticket information below on Stereoboard.
