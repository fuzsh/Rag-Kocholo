        "text": "Carlinhos Brown is one of the most creative, active and innovative artists in the current Brazilian music scene. With his multiple talents, Brown stands out as a singer, musician, producer, arranger and cultural agitator. However it was percussion that really launched him internationally, which has a special place in the artist's mosaic of natural abilities.\n\nBrown started one of the most successful projects of his career at the end of the 1980s. Rediscovering and at the same time reinventing the sound of the timbau , he brought dozens of percussionists together and founded Timbalada. The group was born with its own personality and sound, which boosted the Bahian musician's success even further around Brazil and provided the opportunity for various world tours.\n\nParallel to this, Brown has always been involved in numerous other musical projects. Among these, his participation in Sergio Mendes' CD \"Brasileiro\" in 1995, meant that the Bahian musician's name gained an even greater reputation and respect on the international scene. Brown was responsible for five of the twelve 12 tracks on Mendes' album, which was awarded a Grammy for the best World Music album.\n\nBrown consolidated his singing career in 1996, launching the celebrated \"Alfagamabetizado\", his first solo album. Brown performs as singer, producer and instrumentalist on the disc. \"Alfagamabetizado\" recently entered the \"1001 discs to listen to before you die\" category, launched all around the world and bringing together the opinions of 90 internationally renowned music critics.\n\nIn 2002, Brown undertook yet another great project, which attained international success. Together with friends and partners Marisa Monte and Arnaldo Antunes, The Tribalistas were created. Launched on CD and DVD, their collective work snapped up prizes around the world and reached the marker of selling more than 1 million copies, receiving a diamond disc.\n\nSince the launch of his first solo CD, Brown has notched up five projects, with his most recent launched in 2007. Entitled \"A Gente Ainda Nao Sonhou\", it was totally produced by Brown who plays almost all the instruments on the disc. Carlinhos Brown currently divides himself between his international career, which has a solid base, mainly in Europe, social projects in the district of Candeal Pequeno in Salvador, as well as cultural project, shows, producing discs and soundtracks for dance performances, films and other productions.\n\nHis trio eletrico, the Camarote Andante, took more than 400,000 people to the streets of Barcelona in 2004 during the opening of the Universal Forum of Cultures. According to information from the Barcelona city hall, it became the cultural event with the greatest attendance in the city's history up to that time.\n\nThe film \"El Milagro de Candeal\", directed by Fernando Trueba was also launched in Spain in the same year. It portrays the community of Candeal through the eyes of Cuban musician Bebo Valdes. The film won the 2005 Goya Prize in Spain for Best Original Song, Zambie Mameto, which was composed by Brown.\n\nThe Camarote Andante returned to visit the streets of Spain in 2005, when five large-scale carnivals were held in Bilbao, again in Barcelona, Madrid, Seville and Valencia. The audience reached the marker of 1,200,000 in Madrid.\n\nCarlinhos Brown is also one of the most successful Brazilian composers. He has already recorded with artists such as Bebel Gilberto, Maria Bethania, Gal Costa, Cassia Eller, Ney Matogrosso, Daniela Mercury, Angelique Kidjo and Italian singer, Jovanotti and partnered international artists such as Sergio Mendes and Will.i.am.\n\nwww.carlinhosbrown.com.br"
