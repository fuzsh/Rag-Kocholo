        "text": "Arnaldo Antunes, Carlinhos Brown, and Marisa Monte -- three noted Brazilian pop artists -- formed Tribalistas and released a self-titled album in 2003. Mostly acoustic, with splashes of electronics, Tribalistas centered mainly around Monte's vocals while remaining loosely tied to the trio's Brazilian roots. The album generated a handful of Latin Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Brazilian Contemporary Pop Album, and Best Brazilian Song (Portuguese Language).\n\n&copy Andy Kellman /TiVo"
