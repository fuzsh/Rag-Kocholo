        "text": "Originally posted by kasumigenx\n\nWhat if Wenceslaus II survives to 1320's to 1330's, how would this effect the history of Poland and Bohemia, one thing is that Wenceslaus III is guaranteed to marry the OTL Elisabeth of Toss which means he keeps the claims to Hungary and becomes Ladislaus V.\n\nI think Wenceslaus II had a good chance to keep Polish crown for good. Piast dukes were too weak and disorganized to challenge him; he organized a competent administration, restored order and improved economy in Poland. AFAIK most Poles were only unhappy with his German inclination (i.e. using German as his first language and having German advisors), although Bohemians had the same problem. I'm not sure about Hungarian claims though - IIRC already Wenceslaus II was forced to\n\ngive up his Hungarian claims anout 1304.\n\nOriginally posted by kasumigenx\n\nThe other questions are, would any of the ITTL sons of Richeza Elisabeth inherit the Polish throne instead, since the sons of Richeza would inherit her claims to the Polish throne and claims to Greater Poland or Wenceslaus III would claim Poland instead?\n\nEven if Richeza Elizabeth has sons with Wenceslaus II, they are still younger than Wenceslaus III - IMO that would make him a legal heir to all lands which belonged to his father, including Poland. Wenceslaus II was crowned as king of Poland in 1300, and his marriage with Richeza Elizabeth was among conditions put by nobles of Greater Poland for their support. Wenceslaus II met their demands, so technically, his position was strong enough, although the pope did not accept his coronation.\n\nTheoretically, Wenceslaus III might have problems with his half-brother(s), who would have equal or even better claims to Polish and Bohemian crowns. OTOH he would be elder and he and his father would have much more time to prepare for potential succession crisis. I do not believe they would allow for splitting of the country - possibly Richeza Elizabeth's son would be made a duke of Greater Poland and vassal of his older half brother, king of Bohemia and Poland. Litle Poland (Małopolska), Silesia and other Polish lands would remain either under Wenceslaus III's direct rule or as his vassals.\n\nOriginally posted by kasumigenx\n\nI think Wenceslaus II had a good chance to keep Polish crown for good.

Duke of Kuyavia was an enemy of Premislids, their competitor to the Polish crown (successful, IOTL). As such he was supported by Hungarian magnate, Amadeus Aba, follower of Charles Robert of Hungary. In early XIVth centuryy he was almost nobody, an exile - but thanks to Hungarian help he managed to return to Poland and was lucky enough that two Premislids died in time (if it was luck...). And besidaes, who will give Władysław's son a girl with very good claims to Hungarian crown? She was much too valuable to waste her on some minor duke form who knows where. Abd to make him a possible candidate to Hungarian throne? There were enough of them already.\n\nAnyway, the problem of Hungarian crown will be solved , one way or another, by Wenceslaus II, since he is supposed to live longer.\n\nIt is very possible that he will defeat Władysław Łokietek ( he did it before IOTL). If so, his claims to Polish throne will be more or less secure. However, If Wenceslaus II is soundly defeated by Charles Robert, there is a significant chance that he will loose both Polish and Hungarian crown (for his son), since Charles Robert will try to put his own candidate on Polish throne - probably Łokietek, if he's available, or perhaps his son. Just to have an ally on Bohemian border, should Premislids try for another round. Another possible outcome is for Wenceslaus II to loose Hungary, but to keep Poland - depending of war / diplomacy with Charles Robert.\n\nP.S. Punctuation is your friend. Please, please USE IT! Sometimes it is hard for me to understand what you mean."
