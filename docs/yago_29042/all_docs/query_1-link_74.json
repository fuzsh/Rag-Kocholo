        "text": "Today is the Feast of Stephen. Where have you heard that recently? Oh, yes, in that carol: “Good King Wenceslas looked out on the Feast of Stephen…”\n\nA fellow writer recently blogged about favorite Christmas songs. I commented that one of mine is the carol about the good King. I love the imagery of a king going out to physically help a peasant.\n\nDid you know this song is based on a real ruler?\n\nWenceslaus was born in Prague about 905 to a Christian father, the Duke of Bohemia, and a pagan mother. He was raised and educated by his grandmother (his father’s mother), who was also a Christian.\n\nThe Duke died when Wenceslaus was about 13 years old. His mother became regent and began to impose a secular reign. The grandmother disapproved of this, and encouraged Wenceslaus to usurp his mother’s power. The power struggle between the two women was fueled by various advisors who pitted Christians against pagans in an effort to advance their own interests. It wasn’t long before the grandmother was murdered (strangled with her own veil) and the mother exiled for the deed.\n\nWenceslaus took power when he turned 18. He tried to unify Bohemia under Christian rule. He was known as a pious, educated, and intelligent man who cared for the poor and the sick, and widows and orphans. It is believed by many that Wenceslaus even took a vow of poverty, though there is no direct evidence of this. He established several churches, including the rotunda of Saint Vitus at Prague Castle.\n\nHe also sought to ensure peace by forming an alliance with Germany. For a few years Bohemia enjoyed tranquility and security. During these years Wenceslaus married and had children, including a son who became next in line to the Dukedom. This removed Wenceslaus’s brother Boleslav from the line of succession.\n\nIn 929 the peace ended when German king Heinrich I the Fowler invaded Bohemia and forced Wenceslaus to submit. Boleslav took this opportunity to undermine Wenceslaus’s leadership and turn people against him. A group of knights aligned with Boreslav assassinated Wenceslaus on the steps of a church as he was entering to attend Mass.\n\nWenceslas was considered a martyr and a saint immediately after his death, and legends sprang up about him within just a few years. One written account states, “rising every night from his noble bed, with bare feet and only one chamberlain, he [Wenceslaus] went around to God’s churches and gave alms generously to widows, orphans, those in prison and afflicted by every difficulty, so much so that he was considered, not a prince, but the father of all the wretched.” (Centuries later Pope Pius II, who walked ten miles barefoot in the ice and snow as an act of pious thanksgiving, proclaimed this legend to be factual.)\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Otto I posthumously “conferred on [Wenceslas] the regal dignity and title” and Wenceslaus was viewed as a “righteous king,” one whose power stems from his piety. Thus we sing about “Good King Wenceslaus.”\n\nMay his example and lesson encourage those of us who live with plenty to remember and care for those less fortunate.\n\nGood King Wenceslas looked out\n\non the feast of Stephen,\n\nwhen the snow lay round about,\n\ndeep and crisp and even.\n\nBrightly shone the moon that night,\n\nthough the frost was cruel,\n\nwhen a poor man came in sight,\n\ngathering winter fuel.\n\nHither, page, and stand by me.\n\nIf thou know it telling:\n\nyonder peasant, who is he?\n\nWhere and what his dwelling?\n\nSire, he lives a good league hence,\n\nunderneath the mountain,\n\nright against the forest fence\n\nby Saint Agnes fountain.\n\nBring me flesh, and bring me wine.\n\nBring me pine logs hither.\n\nThou and I will see him dine\n\nwhen we bear the thither.\n\nPage and monarch, forth they went,\n\nforth they went together\n\nthrough the rude wind’s wild lament\n\nand the bitter weather.\n\nSire, the night is darker now,\n\nand the wind blows stronger.\n\nFails my heart, I know not how.\n\nI can go no longer.\n\nMark my footsteps my good page,\n\ntread thou in them boldly:\n\nThou shalt find the winter’s rage\n\nfreeze thy blood less coldly."
