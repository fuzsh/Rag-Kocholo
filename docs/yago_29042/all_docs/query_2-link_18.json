        "text": "Wenceslas (born Feb. 26, 1361, Nürnberg—died Aug. 16, 1419, Prague) was a German king and, as Wenceslas IV, king of Bohemia. His weak and tempestuous, though eventful, reign was continually plagued by wars and princely rivalries that he was unable to control, plunging his territories into a state of virtual anarchy until he was stripped of his powers altogether by a rebellious nobility.\n\nSon of the Holy Roman emperor Charles IV, Wenceslas was crowned king of Bohemia in 1363 and king of the Romans in 1376, proving a largely incompetent ruler after his father’s death in 1378. He was a peace-loving man and held frequent diets in Germany from 1378 to 1389, but he could not prevent the continuing wars between town leagues and princes that reduced Germany to anarchy for almost a decade. The diet at Eger (modern Cheb) in 1389 finally settled most conflicts by a general peace, but, because the King spent most of his time in Prague to the detriment of Germany, the empire’s princes repeatedly demanded the appointment of a Reichsverweser (imperial governor) for Germany, a request consistently refused by Wenceslas.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nAfter 1389 Wenceslas left Germany largely to its own devices, returning only in 1397 to hear the princes’ complaints before travelling to France to attempt to resolve the Western Schism that was dividing Christendom. Finally, in August 1400, when Wenceslas refused to attend another meeting of the princes, they deposed him and elected Rupert (Ruprecht) III, elector Palatine, king of the Romans. Wenceslas was, however, able to retain the title of German king for the rest of his life."
