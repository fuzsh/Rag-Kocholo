        "text": "Elisabeth Richeza’s son\n\nOn 1305, Richeza Elisabeth of Poland gives birth to two children, fraternal twins that have very good destinies, one is destined to be the King of Poland, he is named Przemyslaw, and his sister is called Agnes.\n\nPrince Wenceslaus takes Viola of Cieszyn as his mistress, knowing that a Polish wife can do nothing and his brother, Przemyslaw becomes the heir to the Polish throne.\n\nWenceslaus II dies after the birth of her twins due to tuberculosis and Richeza Elisabeth becomes the Queen Regent of Poland.\n\nWhile Prince Wenceslaus would only rule over Bohemia and not inherit Poland, Wenceslaus III is forced to continue his own marriage plans with Elisabeth of Hungary.\n\nThe Dukes of Mazovia and Silesia declare loyalty to the regency of Richeza Elisabeth of Poland for her son Przemyslaw III.\n\nIn the meantime, another Princess named Elisabeth is under the custody of Habsburgs, and that girl is the fiancé of Wenceslaus III.\n\nWenceslaus III planned campaigns against the Habsburgs to get back his own fiancé, Elisabeth.\n\nWenceslaus III dangled his sister, Anna as a bride to Vladislaus or Stephen, the sons of Wladyslaw the Elbowhigh in order to neutralize him and in order to start a cease-fire between the Przemyslids and the Kuyavian Piasts but the negotiations did not push through and Anna was able to have a short secret marriage with Henry of Carinthia who later died for mysterious reasons.\n\nSince Richeza needed another husband, she would marry Stephen of Kuyavia, the son of Wladyslaw the Elbowhigh as a second husband on 1310, it was against the plans of Wenceslaus while Elisabeth would marry Vladislaus of Kuyavia that is what Richeza made as a plan for her own survival in reality Richeza loved another man and it is Henry of Lipa.\n\nFor Anna of Bohemia, a marriage for her is negotiated by Wenceslaus III and she will be used as a way to get his bride Elisabeth back from captivity by Wladyslaw the Elbowhigh and for that reason a marriage between Henry the Friendly and Anna of Bohemia is made as a way for Elisabeth of Hungary to be back from Habsburg captivity and Anna of Bohemia is married to Henry the Friendly, however, the marriage lasted for months and it was rumored that Anna of Bohemia killed her husband and Elisabeth.\n\nAnna of Bohemia was given another match and this time on 1315 and it would be a Lithuanian one to Algirdas, who wanted to convert.\n\nIn this time, Polish and Czech troops would war with Hungary to reclaim the Hungarian throne from the Angevins stolen from his wife, Elisabeth of Hungary.\n\nAfter Anna of Bohemia remarried to Louis the Quarreler, the King of France\n\nAnna of Bohemia gave birth to a well-deserved son for her husband, she made her husband happy and a son was born.\n\nThe son between Anna and Louis is named Charles on 1316.\n\nFor Wenceslaus III, he would have three children, Jutta(1313), John(1315) and Charles(1316).\n\nHenry VII of the Holy Roman Empire negotiated for a marriage between Margaret and his son, John as well as a marriage between Beatrice of Luxembourg and Przemyslaw III, the two marriages did happen.\n\nIt means that Beatrice would be crowned as a Queen of Poland, instead of the plan to make her the Queen of France.\n\nBaptism of Lithuania\n\nAlgirdas made a condition on 1310 that they will convert if the Teutons Cede Latvia and the Eastern Part of Prussia to Lithuania, Wenceslaus III wanting to gain more allies tried to persuade Algirdas to ally with him in exchange for conversion and marriage with his sister, Agnes of Poland, the full sister of Przemyslaw III as well as the guarantee to gain the land he wanted.\n\nOn 1315, a marriage between Agnes of Poland and Algirdas was made and Algirdas converted to Catholicism, the marriage would advance the Przemyslid cause and besides that he would also support the initiative of promoting the church popularity of the Polish Queen regent.\n\nThe Problem with Agnes of Poland is that she is just 10 years old and her husband already is married to another woman in another church, which was dissolved promptly after the negotiations, time was needed for him to actually consummate the marriage.\n\nIn this time, Zavish of Falkenstein’s son, Stephen is also scheming for the throne of Hungary, so Wenceslaus III needed an alliance with Algirdas for it.\n\nAgnes of Poland, Grand Duchess of Lithuania\n\nPremyslid Century\n\nThese are the revised chapters..\n\nSurvival of Wenceslaus II\n\nThe death of Otto of Brandenburg complicated again Ryksa's situation, because as the only child of the last male member of the Piast Greater Poland line and the first King in almost two centuries, she was the perfect match for every contender to the Polish crown. For this, when King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia (a widower since 1297) received from the lords of Greater Poland the offer of marriage with the princess, he didn't think too much, and even before his own coronation as King of Poland on 25 July 1300 in Gniezno, Ryksa was sent to Prague.\n\nBecause of her youth, Wenceslaus II decided to delay the wedding until Ryksa was fifteen years-old. During this time, she was placed under the care of Gryfina of Halych, widow of Leszek II the Black and aunt of the Bohemian King.\n\nThe marriage between Ryksa and Wenceslaus II took place on 26 May 1303 in Prague Cathedral. During the ceremony, Ryksa was crowned Queen consort of Bohemia and Poland, and at the request of her husband, she adopted the name Elisabeth, because her name was not used in Bohemia and seen as strange. The ceremony was performed with the consent of the Archbishops of Mainz and Gniezno and the Bishop of Wrocław, Henry of Wierzbnej.\n\nTwo years later, on 15 June 1305, Queen Elizabeth gave birth to a daughter named Agnes. Only six days later, on 21 June, King Wenceslaus II was sickly but was able to recover shortly and a year after the recovery of King Wenceslaus II on 1306, Elisabeth Richeza is Pregnant and gives birth to a son named Premislaus who becomes the heir to the throne of Poland, she gives birth to another son named Casimir on 1307.\n\nDue to the birth of a son, Wenceslaus III would never change his mind about his marriage to Elisabeth of Hungary[1] and Elisabeth, the daughter of Wenceslaus III would be married to Wladyslaw’s son Stephen [2]in order for Vladislav the Elbowhigh to end his claims to the Polish throne, as for Anne he plans to marry her to Rudolf of Austria in order to retrieve the bride of Wenceslaus, or rather Vladislav V of Hungary, Elisabeth of Hungary was sent back to Bohemia in exchange for Anna and they were crowned in Hungary where in they would rule after their coronation.\n\n1. He inherits none of Poland and he will not marry a Polish match, the match for him is the Hungarian Princess not a Polish one.\n\n2.The marriage will end Wladyslaw’s claims to the Polish throne.\n\nWenceslaus II\n\nm.
