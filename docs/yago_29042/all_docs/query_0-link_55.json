        "text": "I’ve always loved the Jul- names, including the Yul- variations found in some Slavic languages. These are some of my favorites:\n\n1. Julia. This popular classic is found in English, German, Dutch, the Scandinavian languages, Spanish, Finnish, and Polish. In Spanish, the J is pronounced like a sharp H, and in all the other languages besides English, the J is pronounced like a Y. Júlia is the Hungarian, Catalan, Slovakian, and Portuguese variation.\n\n2. Julie. This is the French form, and also quite popular in English. It strikes me as one of those names which, in spite of only getting popular/trendy fairly recently, doesn’t have a dated feel to it. Another name of this sort is Lauren. In spite of having been most popular in another generation, it doesn’t really have a time stamp or one particular age I associate with it.\n\n3. Julian. This is an English, German, and Polish name, with the J pronounced like a Y in Polish and German. It sounds so soft and romantic. However, historically, this was actually a lot more popular as a girls’ name.\n\n4. Yulian. I recently covered this name in the male half of this year’s Y post for A to Z. It’s the Russian and Bulgarian form of Julian. I love the nickname Yulik.\n\n5. Julieanna, Juliana, Julianna. This is an English, Dutch, German, Portuguese, and Spanish name. I have a character named Julieanna, and used that spelling because I was all of 11 years old when I created her and thus didn’t realise that’s not really the most traditional or refined spelling.\n\n6. Juliet, Juliette. Juliet is the familiar English form, first used by Shakespeare, and Juliette is the French form. The French form is traditionally a nickname for Julie.\n\n7. Giulia. This is the Italian form. I knew a Giulia growing up. The diminutive form is Giulietta.\n\n8. Julio. This is a Spanish and Portuguese name, and sounds so strong, romantic, and masculine. I love it because of Julio Desnoyers, the protagonist of The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, an incredible anti-war novel by Vicente Blasco Ibáñez. In 1921, it was magnificently adapted to the silver screen and gave Rudy Valentino his big break.\n\n9. Julietta. This is the Polish form of Juliet, and an English elaborated form. Júlíetta is the Icelandic variation.\n\n10. Julissa. This is an English and Spanish name. I personally prefer it pronounced with a long I.\n\n11. Yuliana. This is the Russian and Bulgarian form of Juliana.\n\n12. Yuliya. This is the Russian and Bulgarian form of Julia.\n\nKing Wenceslaus II of Poland and Bohemia (27 September 1271–21 June 1305), drawn by Aleksander Lesser\n\nWenceslaus is the English and Latinized form of Veceslav, a Czech and Slovakian name which means “more glory.” The modern, contracted form is Václav, with a variant of Věnceslav. The Polish form is Wacław (older form Więcesław), the Bulgarian form is Ventseslav, the Russian and Ukrainian form is Vyacheslav, the Spanish form is Venceslás, the Italian form is Venceslao, the Romanian form is Veaceslav, the Hungarian form is Vencel, and the German form is Wenzeslaus (older form Wenzel).\n\nWenceslaus is mentioned in a bad light in Canto VII of Purgatorio, and held up as an example of a crappy king in Canto XIX of Paradiso. He was still alive during Dante’s otherworldly journey in 1300, though had passed on by the time Dante actually began writing his beautiful poem.\n\nWenceslaus, part of the Přemyslid Dynasty, was the fourth and youngest legitimate child of King Ottokar II, and the only surviving son. His mother was Queen Kunigunda, who was part of Russia’s Ryurikovich Dynasty on her father’s side. Shortly before his seventh birthday, his father passed away. Before Wenceslaus was old enough to rule in his own right, Margate Otto V of Brandenburg–Salzwedel and then his stepfather Záviš of Falkenštejn governed the kingdom.\n\nAt age thirteen, on 24 January 1285, Wenceslaus married Judith of Habsburg, daughter of King Rudolf I of Germany, to whom he’d become betrothed in 1276. In 1290, Wenceslaus had his stepfather beheaded for supposed treason and took the throne in his own right.\n\nUnder his rule, the empire expanded from the Baltic Sea to the Danube, important cities such as Plzeň were founded, the penny of Prague currency was created, Bohemia became Europe’s largest producer of silver, and the crowns of Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary were won. There was also great urban development, and he planned to build Central Europe’s first university.\n\nWren is obviously after the English word for the small songbird, derived from the Old English wrenna. I’m quite partial to Nature names, as long as they’re not too outlandish. Bird names as people names are kind of hit-or-miss, but I’ve always really liked the name Wren. It’s so sweet and simple, though perhaps works better as a middle name.\n\nTheodore is probably my third-favoritest male name of all time, after only Samuel and Peter. If I ever have children, and I have at least three boys, I’ll name the third Theodore, in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt. I’ve just always adored the name, and the nickname Teddy. It also has a lot of awesome foreign variants. My favorites include:\n\n1. Fyodor. This is the Russian form, which some people erroneously transliterate as Fedor or Feodor. The Russian letter Ë transliterates as YO, not E or EO. The modern transliteration Fyodor makes the pronunciation so obvious and immediately clear, whereas Fedor and Feodor suggest much different pronunciations to me. I also love the nickname Fedya, which has cute superdiminutives including Fedyushka, Fedyushenka, and Fedyushechka.\n\n2. Teodor. This is the spelling used in much of Central, Eastern, Southern, and Northern Europe. I’m particularly fond of the Polish nickname Dorek.\n\n3. Théodore. This is the French version. I’m a sucker for names with accent marks.\n\n4. Todor. This is the Macedonian, Serbian, and Bulgarian form.\n\n5. Theodor. This is the German form.\n\n6. Teodoro. This is the Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese form.\n\n7. Tivadar. This is the Hungarian form. An alternate version is Tódor.\n\n8. Fedir. This is the Ukrainian form.\n\n9. Teodoras. This is the Lithuanian form.\n\n10. Tudor. This is the Romanian form, and apparently quite popular at the moment.\n\nThe name Alexander was the eighth-most-popular male name in the U.S. in 2015, and its popularity has been steadily rising since 1981, after it jumped from #92 to #70. It’s been somewhere on the Top 10 since 2008, with its highest popularity so far being #4 in 2009. It’s a strong, classic name which has been used regularly since Alexander the Great (who popularized the name) and is found in all the major Indo–European languages. Even some non-Indo–European languages use a form of it. These are some of my favorite forms.\n\n1. Aleksandr. This is the Russian form, and as readers of my main blog should know, the name of my favoritest writer, Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn. The base nickname forms are Sanya, Sasha, and Shura, with Alek also sometimes used.\n\n2. Aleksander. This is the Polish, Norwegian, Estonian, Danish, Slovenian, and Albanian form. The base Polish nickname form is Olek. I really miss skarbczyk.com, which is now only viewable through archive.org. It had a plethora of awesome Polish names and their nickname forms. Most of the individual name pages weren’t archived, sadly.\n\n3. Sándor (pronounced SHAHN-dor). This is the Hungarian form, which I, for the longest time, erroneously believed was pronounced SAHN-dor. It’s embarrassing to admit to having been a Magyarphile for 21 years this April and only recently realized the Hungarian S is pronounced SH when it’s by itself.\n\n4. Skender. This is one of two Albanian nickname forms (the other being Sandër), though it sounds substantial enough to work as a name in its own right (outside of Albania, of course!). The persistently negative commenter I was having problems with tried to tell me I wasn’t being very consistent in my post about nicknames, but if she hadn’t cherry-picked my post to try to find a reason to criticize me yet again, she would’ve understood I have no problem with nicknames as full names if they sound substantial and have a fair bit of history of being used as such (e.g., Ella, Jack, Jenny. Jessie, Natasha, Henry).\n\n5. Iskandar. This is the Arabic and Indonesian form.\n\n6. Alessandro. This is the Italian form, and sounds so soft, pretty, and romantic.\n\n7. Alejandro. This is the Spanish form, and sounds so strong and masculine.\n\n8. Aleksandar. This is the Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, and Macedonian form. The Bulgarian and Macedonian base nickname is Sasho; Aca and Aco (C pronounced like the TS in Tsar) are Serbian and Macedonian forms; Saša is Croatian and Serbian; and Ace is Macedonian.\n\n9. Aleksandro. This is the Esperanto form.\n\n10. Eskandar. This is the Persian form.\n\nThe English name Elizabeth has been steadily popular pretty much forever. It’s a solid, established classic that sounds mature and professional, works on any age, doesn’t date the bearer, ages very well, and is probably one of two names with by far the most nicknames to choose from (the other name being Katherine, of course). However, if you really like the name or want to name your daughter after someone special, but are a bit off-put by how popular the name is, there are plenty of foreign versions to choose from. These are my personal favorites.\n\n1. Elisabeta. This is the Romanian form of the name, and sounds and looks so pretty. It really stands out for all the right reasons.\n\n2. Elisabetta. This is the Italian form of the name, a little frillier than the Romanian form but still super-pretty.\n\n3. Eliisabet. This is the Estonian form, and the name of one of the Estonian characters in my Russian historicals. I love the double vowels found in so many Estonian names.\n\n4. Elżbieta. This is the Polish form, pronounced Ehlzh-BYEH-tah. It’s got so many great nicknames, like Elża, Ela, Elżunia, Elunia, Elcia, Elicia, and Elka. The Lithuanian form is Elžbieta, which is pronounced basically the same way, except for having a háček instead of a dot over the Z.\n\n5. Elisabeth. I’ve really grown fond of the German and Dutch form recently. It looks so soft, classic, and pretty, as well as having been borne by so many famous women and girls throughout history.\n\n6. Élisabeth. The French form has also really grown on me recently, not to mention the fact that I’m a sucker for names with accent marks.\n\n7. Lizaveta. I prefer the simplified Russian form of this name over the traditional, full version Yelizaveta. It sounds softer and prettier, and doesn’t have as many syllables.\n\n8. Elisabet. This is the Scandinavian and Finnish form of the name. The Icelandic form is Elísabet.\n\n9. Elisaveta. This is the Bulgarian and Macedonian form, and I have a deep fondness for the Bulgarian people due to how they saved their entire Jewish community from the Nazis.\n\n10. Erzsébet. This is the Hungarian form, pronounced Ehr-ZHAY-bet, and with nicknames including Erzsi, Bözsi, Erzsa, Eri and Zsóka. Sadly, since history is written by the victors, many non-Hungarians to this day believe the lies the Austrians concocted about Countess Erzsébet Báthory. It’s so hard to get people to believe the truth after centuries of sensationalistic stories."
