        "text": "On 1306, Wenceslaus, the Prince of Poland and Bohemia, son of Wenceslaus II, the later Wenceslaus III would annul his marriage with Viola Elizabeth of Teschen who would end in a nunnery which would be like a death sentence to her and she would regret marrying Wenceslaus all her life and Elizabeth of Hungary would marry him and his sister Anna would marry Rudolf of Austria as a payment of the release of Elisabeth of Hungary from Habsburg custody, this was a happy time for King Wenceslaus II due to the two kingdoms that he is ruling.\n\nHe would plan his reconquest of Hungary now against the King of Hungary Charles Robert and expel him from Hungary for his wife Elizabeth I of Hungary as king de jure uxoris, the two will wait for their time to come, Wenceslaus II would betroth his daughter, Margaret to John of Luxembourg to support the Henry of Luxembourg as the future Holy Roman Emperor and his daughter, Elizabeth to Andrew Yuryevich of Galicia.\n\nElizabeth

in Hungary and Croatia as the De jure Uxoris of Elizabeth I of Hungary.\n\nWladyslaw the Elbowhigh would be forced to bow to Wenceslaus II, and he would die in 1311 which would be said due to the poisoners sent by Wenceslaus and he would be left by his two daughters and his own inheritance in Lesser Poland would be claimed by Wenceslaus himself, this was the end of Elbow High in 1311 and Wenceslaus II would be able to rule Poland himself with the principalities in Poland under his own thumb.\n\nThey would have Elizabeth of Hungary married to Henry II/XIV of Bavaria in 1320 to make an ally against a rival claimant to Hungary in Bavaria.\n\nThe Slavs in two sides of the Tatras and Carpathian would have been united under Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, the Poles, Czechs, and Slovaks would share one country under the rule of Wenceslaus II which Wenceslaus II would inherit in 1330 when he becomes the King of Poland and Bohemia after he becomes the King of Hungary and Croatia.\n\nDue to the actions of Wenceslaus II and Wenceslaus II, it would start the unification of the three Slavic Countries of Poland, Bohemia, and Croatia under one ruler as well as of Slovakia which is in Hungary which would unite the Slovaks under a ruler more like them.\n\nOn November 1316, Clementia of Naples’ son, John would turn out to be healthy and she and her brother in law would be regents for her own son, John as John I of France, the new King of France and he would reach his majority on 1330 and they would pick Jutta of Hungary, the daughter of Ladislaus V of Hungary and Elizabeth I of Hungary who would be renamed as Bonne of Hungary as wife of John I of France on 1331, the marriage would have been made to isolate the Neapolitan claimants from their claims in the Hungarian throne.\n\nBonne of Hungary would have the following Children\n\nCharles IV of France (January 21, 1333)\n\nCatherine (1335)\n\nLouis I, Duke of Anjou (July 23, 1337)\n\nJohn, Duke of Berry (November 30,

to a daughter named Agnes of Bohemia, followed by another daughter named Margaret on 1307, her daughter Margaret would be the last pregnancy that she will carry to term, Elizabeth Ryksa would be the regent for the Kingdom of Poland and she would be the one who would manage and be the regent for the Kingdom of Poland which would mean she and her husband would be apart due to her rule as regent of Poland for most of the time, she would go to a monastery and become a nun in Prague after the death of her husband until her own death in 1350.\n\nOn 1320, a marriage between Algirdas and Agnes of Bohemia would be negotiated to baptize Lithuania and for the Teutonic Crusaders to end their own occupation of the Prussian lands, her only male issue that survived infancy would be King Jogaila(1349) of Lithuania and another for her daughter Margaret for her to marry Peter II of Sicily to secure an ally against the Neapolitans in the succession of Hungary.\n\nAgnes of Bohemia, Queen of Sicily

starting an alliance between the English and the Bretons again as they have common interests against the French while Yolande of Brittany[1], the rival of Jeanne would marry Charles V of France, during the reign of John I who would produce two sons, John(1360) and Louis(1371) which would cause a war that would happen between the English and the French which would last for decades on the reigns of John I(which lasted til his death on 1360) and Charles V, however the English would win in Brittany but lose in Aquitaine and Gascony.\n\nOn 1369, Philippa of Antwerp would marry John of France(1360), the eldest son of Charles signing a cease fire between the French and the English on 1360 but the marriage treaty would include the cession of Aquitaine and Gascony to the French and the independence of Brittany from the French which would be temporary and the English would retain Ponthieu, the marriage between John of France and Philippa of Antwerp would cause the French to be involved in the succession issues in England on the death of Richard II in 1400.\n\n1.
