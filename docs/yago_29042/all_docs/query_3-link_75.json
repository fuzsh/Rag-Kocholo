        "text": "Our Kinship With St. Casimir of Poland and Blessed Charles of Austria\n\nThrough my mother's Scottish ancestry, two lineages may be traced back to the famous Austrian House of Habsburg, which first rose to international prominence and power with Rudolf I von Habsburg's election as King of the Romans (i.e., \"Holy Roman Emperor-elect\") in 1273, which brought an end to the long Great Interregnum when the Prince Electors of the Holy Roman Empire were unable to agree on who should be the next Holy Roman Emperor. As shown below, the wife of King James II of Scotland was descended from two of the daughters of King Rudolf I.\n\nConsequently, this makes our family very distant cousins of St. Casimir of Poland (1458-1484), a prince of the Jagiellon dynasty which ruled Poland and Lithuania from the latter 1300s until 1572. Son of the King of Poland and a Habsburg princess, St. Casimir was noted for his profound piety and fervent religious devotion even as a young boy. At night when churches were locked, he would pray outside on the church steps for hours. Though he was heir apparent to the Polish throne and governed Poland under his father from 1481 to 1483, St. Casimir renounced marriage and embraced holy celibacy. He fell sick of a severe lung ailment in early 1484 and died at Grodno on 4 March 1484, being only 25 years old. He was interred in the cathedral in Vilna, in the chapel of the Blessed Virgin for whom he had a deep devotion. After his death he began to be popularly venerated as a saint, and many miracles took place through his intercession, leading to his canonisation by Pope Adrian VI in 1522. His feast day is March 4, anniversary of his birthday into heaven.\n\nWe are also distant cousins with Blessed Charles of Austria (1887-1922), i.e., Emperor Charles I (Karl Franz Joseph Ludwig Hubert Georg Otto Maria von Habsburg-Lothringen), last Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary (1916-1922), whose proposals to restore peace during World War I were rejected by the Allies who were intent on crushing their enemies and aggrandising their own empires and hegemony in the name of secularist liberalism and social progress. With the war's end the Austro-Hungarian Empire was dismembered and Emperor Charles decided to \"renounce participation\" in state affairs without abdicating his throne and legal rights. The new liberal political regimes in Austria and Hungary, however, decided to abolish the monarchies, with Austria's rulers passing a law making it a crime for any Habsburg to live in or visit Austria. After abortive attempts to return to his throne in Hungary, in 1922 the Allies exiled him with his wife Empress Zita and their children to the Island of Madeira, consigning them to poverty and forbidding them to leave. Blessed Charles was personally pious and devout, and a loving husband, telling his wife Zita on their wedding day after their marriage, \"Now, we must help each other to get to Heaven.\" He accepted his expulsion and exile with patience and holy resignation, enduring the illness that led to his death as redemptive suffering, saying, \"I must suffer like this so my people will come together again.\" He died of pneumonia on 1 April 1922 and was interred in the Church of Our Lady of Monte on the Isle of Madeira, but his heart and the heart of his beloved wife are interred in Muri Abbey in Switzerland. In 1949 a cause for his canonisation was opened, and he was beatified by Pope St. John Paul II on 3 Oct. 2004 after the confirmation of two miraculous healings that resulted from his heavenly intercession. His feast day is Oct. 21, the anniversary of the marriage of Charles and Zita.\n\nThe first chart below, tracing the Habsburg Dynasty back to their royal founder Rudolf von Habsburg in the 1200s A.D., illustrates that I am a sixth cousin 19 times (and 20 times) removed of St. Casimir of Poland, and a 19th cousin six times (and seven times) removed of Blessed Charles of Austria.\n\nRudolf I von Habsburg Count of Habsburg King of the Romans d. 1291 _____________________________|_________________________________________ | | | Albert I Jutta=Wenceslaus II Matilda=Louis II the Severe King of the Romans d. 1297|King of Bohemia d. 1304|Duke of Bavaria d. 1308 |King of Poland | d. 1294 | | | Albert II Elisabeth=John of Luxemburg Louis IV Bavarus Duke of Austria d. 1330 |\"the Blind King\" Holy Roman Emperor | |King of Bohemia d. 1347 _________|_________ | d. 1346 | | | | | Albert III Leopold Jean II the Good=Judith (Bona) Albert I of the Long Hair | King of France | d. 1349 Count of Holland Duke of Austria | d. 1364 | Duke of Bavaria | | | d. 1404 | | | | Albert IV Ernst Philippe II the Bold | Duke of Austria | Duke of Burgundy | | | d. 1402 ________________| | | | | Albert II Frederick III Jean the Fearless=Margaret von Wittelsbach the Magnanimous Holy Roman Emperor Duke of Burgundy| d. 1423 King of the Romans | d. 1419 | | | | Casimir IV=Elisabeth Maximilian I Adolf I=Marie de Bourgogne Jagiellon| Holy Roman Emperor Duke of Cleves| King of | | | Poland | | | | | | ST.
