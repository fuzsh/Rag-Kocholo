If possible, verify the text with references provided in the foreign-language article.\n\nYou must provide copyright attribution in the edit summary accompanying your translation by providing an interlanguage link to the source of your translation. A model attribution edit summary is Content in this edit is translated from the existing Czech Wikipedia article at [[:cs:Václav II.]]; see its history for attribution.\n\nYou may also add the template {{Translated|cs|Václav II.}} to the talk page.\n\nFor more guidance, see Wikipedia:Translation."
