        "text": "“I don’t love myself, I love the way you look at me…’ Polish Director Grajper c/o ANALOG DIGITAL has created a spellbinding piece of work with his very first UK music video for the indie rock band STONE from Liverpool. For ‘Queen’– a track from the debut album ‘Fear Life For A Lifetime’ – Grajper came up with a unique concept featuring two versions of frontman Fin Power. Through the depiction of seemingly everyday routines, where reality and imagination seamlessly become one, he skillfully skirts the line between everyday reality and the surreal.\n\nGrajper is known for his unique visual style, frequently establishing a connection between the ordinary and the uncanny. His work is marked by a powerful aesthetic, and success seems to remain loyal whatever the project – from commercials to music videos. He skillfully weaves emotional depth and subtle storytelling into his projects giving his work an emphatic and often though-provoking quality.\n\nCREDITS\n\nArtist: @stoneliverpool\n\nDirector: @grajper\n\nProd Company: @friend_london\n\nMusic Video Rep.: @leethalreppin\n\nDOP: Louis Evennou @louis_evennou\n\nGoSee : analogdigital.tv"
