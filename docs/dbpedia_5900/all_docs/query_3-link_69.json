        "text": "CAPE FEAR\n\n1962\n\nDirector: J. LEE THOMPSON\n\nGREGORY PECK, ROBERT MITCHUM\n\nALL SEATS $12.00\n\nDIGITAL CINEMA PRESENTATION\n\nSam Bowden (Peck) is a lawyer, a pillar of his community, married and with a 14-year-old daughter. Released from prison, Max Cady (Mitchum) seethes, hell bent on destroying Bowden, whose testimony sent him there. Mitchum is mesmerizing as Cady, but Peck's Bowden grounds Cape Fear, and his character's desperate attempts at protecting his family call into question ethics, morality and even challenge Peck's own image as an upstanding man.\n\nDCP courtesy Universal Pictures.\n\nAdvance tickets are available."
