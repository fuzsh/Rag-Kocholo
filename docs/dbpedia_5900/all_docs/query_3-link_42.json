Although Cady makes no direct threats, it is apparent that he is after Sam's wife, Peggy, and his 12-year-old daughter, Nancy. Because he has broken no law, neither Sam nor the police are able to take any legal action against him. Consequently, Sam cannot prevent Cady from poisoning the family dog, menacing Nancy when she leaves school, and whispering obscenities to Peggy over the telephone. Furthermore, Cady refuses to be bribed or bullied out of town. Desperate, Sam decides to take the law into his hands and lay a trap for Cady. After hiding his wife and daughter in a houseboat on the Cape Fear River, he leaves town. He then secretly returns, hopeful that Cady has discovered the hiding place. The ruse works, and Cady arrives on the scene late one night. Following a furious struggle in the river,",

Hedda Hopper’s column in the 24 Feb 1961 LAT included character actress Hope Holiday among the cast, but she is not credited on screen.

The reel was screened at the 1961 Theater Owners of America (TOA) convention in New Orleans, LA.\n\nOn 21 Mar 1962, Var announced the picture’s 6 Apr 1962 premiere at the Olympia Theater in Miami, FL. The theater was erroneously referred to as the “Olympic” in the article. Openings followed in New York City on 18 Apr 1961, and Los Angeles, CA, on 16 May 1962. While the 2 May 1962 Var reported encouraging box office receipts, critics were less enthusiastic. The 17 May 1962 LAT warned that the film would leave viewers feeling “lower than a snake’s belly,” and syndicated columnist John Crosby described it as “sordid, vicious and utterly depraved,” according to the 7 Nov 1962 Var.\n\nAn article in the 22 Jul 1962 NYT noted that the British censorship board demanded fifteen cuts to the film. Director J. Lee Thompson claimed the censors intended to make 161 cuts, and protested their attempt to “mutilate and emasculate” his picture. Following a tour of England, Polly Bergen told the 19 Dec 1962 Var that she appeared in most of the deleted scenes, and considered cancelling a series of personal appearances since she was effectively not in the picture. Bergen believed such censorship unnecessary, as the British government already had a rating system in place. An item in the 21 Nov 1962 Var reported that Italian censors passed the film, providing it was shown only to adult audiences.\n\nLess\n\nFollowing a 6-year imprisonment for committing a sadistic sex crime, Max Cady arrives in a small southern town to seek revenge on the man responsible for his conviction, counselor Sam Bowden.
