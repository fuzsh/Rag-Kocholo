        "text": "Surf Curse presents Cape Fear Screening live at the Brain Dead Theater with Intro by the band !! Presented by Sid The Cat\n\nSam Bowden is a small-town corporate attorney. Max Cady is a tattooed, cigar-smoking, Bible-quoting, psychotic rapist. What do they have in common? 14 years ago, Sam was a public defender assigned to Max Cady’s rape trial, and he made a serious error: he hid a document from his illiterate client that could have gotten him acquitted. Now, the cagey Cady has been released, and he intends to teach Sam Bowden and his family a thing or two about loss.\n\nPlease note that this screening is not eligible for Brain Dead Studios membership discounts, and tickets must be purchased separately."
