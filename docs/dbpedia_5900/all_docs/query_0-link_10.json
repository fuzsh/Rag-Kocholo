        "text": "As a rule, I hate remakes of films. This review won’t be an exception. Mr. De Niro, I loathe your liberal politics, but you are an amazing actor, and the lone redeeming piece of this otherwise horrible film. In 1957, John D. MacDonald’s novel, The Executioners, later renamed as Cape Fear due to the title of the 1962, film got published. The 1962 film appeared, and then 29 years later, a 1991, a remake of Cape Fear hit theaters. MacDonald’s original novel was a second shelf selection. The 1962 film, a third shelf selection. This 1991 remake film, the worst of the three. By far. I finished it, thanks to Mr. De Niro, and I suppose since I did I’ll put it on the second shelf, but as a very weak selection.\n\nOnce again, our “heroes,” our “sympathetic” brood, are even less sympathetic than originally intended. None, not one of these three characters is likeable or sympathetic in any way. To have a great villain, we need a hero to triumph. These people are all horrible in acting and character. I wouldn’t have cared had Max Cady killed them all. A horrible script with a horrible cast, save our villain. I don’t think this was what the creators wanted, but I hate this remake.\n\nCape Fear debuted in theaters on November 15, 1991. As with the original 1962 film, Universal Pictures distributed. Amblin Entertainment, Cappa Films, and Tribecca Productions joined forces as production companies. Martin Scorsese sat in the director’s chair. Barbara De Fina produced. Wesley Strick wrote this abominable screenplay based on MacDonald’s original novel and James R. Webb’s screenplay of the 1962 film. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. It should be gold. Like Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. However, this one fails. Miserably.\n\nOur cast? Robert De Niro is our villain, Max Cady, completely removed from the original novel or the character portrayed in the 1962 film by Robert Mitchum. Speaking of Mitchum, he has a small role here, as does his co-star in the 1962 film, Gregory Peck, in his final screen role. Nick Nolte plays our “hero” Sam Bowden. He’s anything but heroic and sympathetic. Jessica Lange plays his wife. Juliette Lewis is the daughter. Martin Baslsam, from the original, makes a cameo. Law & Order fans will spot Fred Thompson in a small role.\n\nThe 1962 film was no mirror image of the original 1957 novel. The 1991 film is no mirror image of either. De Niro’s Max Cady is a far cry from the character in the novel, and not the character portrayed by Robert Mitchum in the 1962 film. Mitchum’s Cady was sly and cunning. De Niro, as always, violent for violence’s sake. At 128 minutes, or a bit over two hours, this was a chore to watch. This isn’t the type of story, the type of film, where you cheer for the villain. The “faces’ are so flawed and villainous in their way you can’t cheer for them. They aren’t good people in any regard. Stick with the 1962 film."
