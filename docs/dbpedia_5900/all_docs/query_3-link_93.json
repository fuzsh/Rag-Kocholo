When released after 8 years in prison, Cady stalks Bowden and his family but is always clever enough not to violate the law. Bowden enlists the aid of a local police chief, a private detective and then hires thugs to harass Cady all to no avail. The film climaxes pitting Bowden and his family against Cady.\n\nRole Credit\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese Producer: Barbara De Fina , Kathleen Kennedy , Frank Marshall , Robert De Niro , Steven Spielberg Cast: Robert De Niro , Nick Nolte , Jessica Lange , Juliette Lewis , Robert Mitchum , Gregory Peck , Martin Balsam"
