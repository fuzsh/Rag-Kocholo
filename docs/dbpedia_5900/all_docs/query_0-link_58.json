        "text": "Plot\n\nSam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer living in North Carolina with his wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). Max Cady (Robert De Niro), a former client of his, is released from prison after 14 years. Cady was tried for rape and battery of a 16-year-old girl and, appalled by the attack, Sam buried evidence of the victim's promiscuity, which might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal.\n\nBowden believes that Cady, who was illiterate at the time of his conviction, remains unaware of his purposefully botched defense. Unbeknownst to him, however, his former client is a naturally intelligent and single-minded psychopath; he learned how to read and studied law in prison, and even unsuccessfully appealed his own conviction several times. He tracks Sam down and begins to terrorize the Bowden family; he lurks near the property and the family dog is mysteriously killed. Sam attempts to have Cady arrested but the police have no evidence of a crime. After intentionally crossing paths with her in a bar, Cady violently attacks and rapes County Courthouse clerk Lori, who is in love with Sam. Despite Sam's advice, she refuses to press charges out of fear that their ongoing platonic flirtation become public, as well as unwillingness to be cross-examined and humiliated by her own colleagues. Sam hires a private investigator, Kersek, to follow Cady.\n\nCady approaches Danielle by impersonating her new drama teacher and feigning an unorthodox interest in her teenage angst. He lures her to the school theater, shares a joint with her, manipulates her libido and attraction to him and kisses her. Her parents find the joint in her schoolbook, and Danielle's coyness about the extent of Cady's seduction drives Sam to the point of desperation. He then agrees to Kersek's plan, which he had dismissed earlier, to have Cady beaten up. He also gives Cady a final warning, which Cady secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Kersek's three hired thugs accost and beat Cady as Sam watches from afar, but Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Cady then uses the recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam. Cady's lawyer also petitions the ABA Ethics Committee for Sam's disbarment, thereby triggering a two-day emergency meeting in Raleigh.\n\nKersek anticipates Cady's intention to enter the Bowden house while Sam is in Raleigh; the family fakes Sam's departure and hides in the house, hoping that Cady will break in, so that he can be shot in self-defense. Cady kills the Bowden's housekeeper Graciela and dons her clothing before murdering Kersek by garroting him with a piano wire and shooting him with his own pistol. Horrified after discovering the bodies, Sam, Leigh, and Danielle flee to their houseboat docked upstate along Cape Fear river.\n\nCady, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danielle while making Sam watch. Danielle sprays Cady with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Cady clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm, a badly burned and deranged Cady confronts Sam, putting him on a mock trial for his deliberate negligence 14 years ago. Despite Sam's insistence that Cady bragged about beating two prior rape charges and that his crime was too heinous for the promiscuity report to be taken into account, Cady berates him for failing to do his duty as a lawyer.\n\nThe storm eventually knocks Cady off his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam uses Cady's handcuffs to shackle Cady to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Cady away and he drowns speaking in tongues and singing the hymn âOn Jordanâs Stormy Banks I Standâ. Sam washes the blood from his hands before he rejoins Leigh and Danielle, who realizes that things will never be the same again for them.\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was adapted by Wesley Strick from the original screenplay by James R. Webb, which was an adaptation from the novel The Executioners by John D. MacDonald.\n\nIt was originally developed by Steven Spielberg, who eventually decided it was too violent and traded it to Scorsese to get back Schindler's List, which Scorsese had decided not to make. Spielberg stayed on as a producer, through his Amblin Entertainment, but chose not to be credited personally on the finished film.[2]\n\nDespite having worked with Nolte in New York Stories (1989), Scorsese did not have him in mind to portray Sam Bowden and wanted Harrison Ford to play the part instead. Ford, however, agreed to do the film only if he was going to portray Max Cady. Nolte, who was interested in portraying Bowden, managed to convince Scorsese to cast him for the part. In addition, Drew Barrymore and Reese Witherspoon both auditioned for the part of Danielle Bowden and Spielberg reportedly wanted Bill Murray to portray Cady.[3]\n\nNick Nolte is taller than Robert De Niro, but for the movie, Nolte lost weight and De Niro developed muscles until he appeared to be the stronger man. De Niro also paid a doctor $5,000 to grind down his teeth for the role to give the character a more menacing look, later paying $20,000 to have his teeth restored after the film production was over.[4]\n\nThe work of Alfred Hitchcock was also influential on the style of Cape Fear. As with the 1962 film version, where director J. Lee Thompson specifically acknowledged Hitchcock's influence, strove to use Hitchcock's style, and had Bernard Herrmann write the score, Scorsese made his version in the Hitchcock manner, especially through the use of unusual camera angles, lighting, and editing techniques. Additionally, Scorsese's version has opening credits designed by regular Hitchcock collaborator Saul Bass, and the link to Hitchcock is cemented by the reuse of the original score by Herrmann, albeit reworked by Elmer Bernstein.[5] Portions of Bass's title sequences are reused from the unreleased ending to his film Phase IV.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe film was parodied in the 1993 Simpsons episode \"Cape Feare\", with Sideshow Bob in the role of Cady. They also pay homage to another Robert Mitchum film The Night of the Hunter in which Sideshow Bob's knuckles (scaled down for a cartoon character with one fewer finger on each hand) say \"Luv\" (Love) and \"HÄt\" (Hate, with the diacritical mark providing the long vowel). This parody was itself the basis for Anne Washburnâs play Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play, which imagines post-apocalyptic theatre troupes attempting to recreate the episode, and by extension the two films and the novel.\n\nIn 1995, professional wrestler Dan Spivey made his WWF (now WWE) debut under the ring name, Waylon Mercy, with his gimmick based on De Niro's portrayal of Max Cady. However, he only lasted a few months with the company, as Spivey was forced into retirement due to a buildup of previous injuries, and the character was abandoned. In 2013, WWE debuted Bray Wyatt, another character partly based on not just De Niro's portrayal, but also Waylon Mercy.[12]\n\nIn a Seinfeld episode, titled \"The Red Dot\", Elaine makes a reference to the film as her boyfriend rampages through her office to get revenge on Jerry for making him lose his job. In another Seinfeld episode, âThe Bookstoreâ, after Jerry rats on Uncle Leo for shoplifting in a bookstore, Jerry has a nightmare where Leo is doing chin ups, working out in prison to get his revenge on Jerry once he finally received his release. Sharing the same scary score of the movie, a close-up of Uncle Leo is seen with âJerryâ & âHelloâ tattooed on each hand. This is a clear reference to Robert De Niro's character in Cape Fear.\n\nIn the Rick and Morty episode \"Ricksy Business\", Lucy, the deranged maid who tries to rape Jerry, is shown clinging to the underside chassis of their car as they drive home, maniacally shouting \"Ha, I'm doing like in Cape Fear!\"\n\nIn the Itâs Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode âMac and Charlie Die part 1â, a scene in which Luther, Macâs father, is released from prison is based on the scene in which Robert De Niroâs character is released.\n\nIn the South Park episode Pre-School Trent Boyett's character and his quest for revenge and the weight lifting scenes are both references to Cape Fear and the 1991 remake of the same name."
