It stars Gregory Peck as Sam Bowden, an attorney and family man who is stalked by a violent psychopath and ex-con named Max Cady (played by Robert Mitchum), who is bent on revenge for Bowden's role in his conviction twenty years prior. The film co-stars Polly Bergen and features Lori Martin, Martin Balsam, Jack Kruschen, Telly Savalas, and Barrie Chase in supporting roles.\n\nThis article is about the 1962 film.

J. Lee Thompson's direction was also strongly influenced by Hitchcock.\n\nThe film was released on June 15, 1962. It received positive reviews from critics, who highlighted Peck and Mitchum's performances. A remake of the same name was released in 1991, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Nick Nolte and Robert De Niro in the lead roles. Peck, Mitchum, and Balsam all appeared as different characters in the remake.[2]\n\nIn Southeast Georgia, Max Cady is released from prison after serving an eight-year sentence for rape. He promptly tracks down Sam Bowden, an attorney whom he holds personally responsible for his conviction because Bowden interrupted his attack and testified against him. Cady begins to stalk and subtly threaten Bowden's family, including his wife, Peggy, and 14-year-old daughter, Nancy. He kills the Bowden family dog, though Bowden cannot prove Cady did it. A friend of Bowden, Police Chief Mark Dutton, attempts to intervene on Bowden's behalf, but he cannot prove Cady guilty of any crime.\n\nBowden hires private detective Charlie Sievers. Cady brutally rapes a young woman, Diane Taylor, when he brings her home, but neither the private detective nor Bowden can persuade her to testify. While Nancy is waiting in a car one day, Cady begins to walk near her, causing her to run and end up almost getting hit by a car. Bowden hires three thugs to beat up Cady and coerce him to leave town, but the plan backfires when Cady gets the better of all three. Cady's attorney vows to have Bowden disbarred.\n\nFearing for Peggy's and Nancy's safety, Bowden takes them to their houseboat in the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. In an attempt to trick Cady, Bowden makes it seem as though he has gone to Atlanta. He fully expects Cady to follow his wife and daughter, and he plans to kill Cady to end the battle. On a dark night, Bowden and local deputy Kersek hide in the swamp nearby, but Cady realizes that Kersek is there and drowns him, leaving no evidence of a struggle. Eluding Bowden and setting the houseboat adrift down the current, Cady first attacks Peggy on the boat, causing Bowden to go to her rescue. Meanwhile, Cady swims back to shore to attack Nancy. Bowden realizes what has happened, and also swims ashore.\n\nThe two men engage in a final fight on the riverbank. Bowden manages to grab his gun, which he had dropped, and shoots Cady, wounding and disabling him. Cady tells Bowden, \"Finish the job\", but Bowden decides to do the thing that Cady earlier told him would be unbearable – put him in prison for the rest of his life, to \"count the years, the months, the hours\". In the morning light, the Bowden family are together on a boat, traveling with police back to port.\n\nDevelopment\n\nCornel Wilde acquired the rights to John D. MacDonald's novel The Executioners for $30,000 in 1958.[3] Gregory Peck had his own production company, Melville Productions, in partnership with Sy Bartlett, which had made The Big Country and Pork Chop Hill and they later purchased the rights. They planned to make it after The Guns of Navarone. Peck was impressed by J. Lee Thompson's work on that film and hired him for Cape Fear.[4] Peck said his goal was to make \"first class professional entertainment intelligently done.\"[5]\n\nCasting\n\nTelly Savalas was screen tested for the role, but later played private eye Charlie Sievers.[6] Robert Mitchum refused to play Max Cady when he was first offered the part, but eventually accepted it after Peck and Thompson delivered him flowers and a case of bourbon.[7]\n\nThompson wanted Hayley Mills, whom he had cast in Tiger Bay, to play the daughter, but Mills was unavailable.\n\nPolly Bergen signed in December 1960. It was her first film in eight years.[8]\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography of Cape Fear began on April 6 and ended in June 1961. Thompson envisioned the film in black and white, believing that shooting the film in color would lessen the atmosphere. As an Alfred Hitchcock fan, he wanted to have Hitchcockian elements in the film, such as unusual lighting angles, an eerie musical score, closeups, and subtle hints rather than graphic depictions of the violence Cady has in mind for the family. Hitchcock collaborators Robert F. Boyle and George Tomasini served as production designer and editor, and his regular composer Bernard Herrmann wrote the score.\n\nThe outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Savannah, Georgia; Stockton, California; and the Universal Studios backlot at Universal City, California. The indoor scenes were done at Universal Studios Soundstage. Mitchum had a real-life aversion to Savannah, where as a teenager, he had been charged with vagrancy and put on a chain gang. This resulted in a number of the outdoor scenes being shot at Ladd's Marina in Stockton, including the culminating conflict on the houseboat at the end of the movie.\n\nThe scene in which Mitchum attacks Polly Bergen's character on the houseboat was almost completely improvised.[citation needed] Before the scene was filmed, Thompson suddenly told a crew member: \"Bring me a dish of eggs!\" Mitchum's rubbing the eggs on Bergen was not scripted and Bergen's reactions were real. She also suffered back injuries from being knocked around so much. She felt the impact of the \"attack\" for days.[9] While filming the scene, Mitchum cut open his hand, leading Bergen to recall: \"his hand was covered in blood, my back was covered in blood. We just kept going, caught up in the scene. They came over and physically stopped us.\"[10]\n\nIn the source novel The Executioners, by John D. MacDonald, Cady was a soldier court-martialed and convicted on then Lieutenant Bowden's testimony for the brutal rape of a 14-year-old girl. The censors stepped in, banned the use of the word \"rape\", and stated that depicting Cady as a soldier reflected adversely on U.S. military personnel.[citation needed]\n\nMusic\n\nBernard Herrmann, as often in his scores, uses a reduced version of the symphony orchestra. Here, other than a 46-piece string section (slightly larger than usual for film scores), he adds four flutes (doubling on two piccolos, two alto flutes in G, and two bass flutes in C) and eight French horns. No use is made of further wind instruments or percussion.[11]\n\nIn his 2002 book A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann, Stephen C. Smith writes:\n\n\"Yet Herrmann was perfect for Cape Fear ... Herrmann's score reinforces Cape Fear's savagery. Mainly a synthesis of past devices, its power comes from their imaginative application and another ingenious orchestration ... a rehearsal for his similar orchestration on Hitchcock's Torn Curtain in 1966. Like similar 'psychological' Herrmann scores, dissonant string combinations suggest the workings of a killer's mind (most startlingly in a queasy device for cello and bass viols as Cadey prepares to attack the prostitute). Hermann's prelude searingly establishes the dramatic conflict: descending and ascending chromatic voices move slowly towards each other from their opposite registers, finally crossing–just as Boden and Cadey's [sic] game of cat-and-mouse will end in deadly confrontation.\"[12]\n\nCensorship\n\nAlthough the word \"rape\" was entirely removed from the script before shooting, the film still enraged the censors, who worried that \"there was a continuous threat of sexual assault on a child.\" To accept the film, British censors required extensive editing and deleting of specific scenes.[13]\n\nAfter making around 6 minutes of cuts, the film still nearly garnered a British X rating (meaning at the time, \"Suitable for those aged 18 and older\", not necessarily meaning there was sexually explicit or violent content).[citation needed][14] Thompson said he had to make 161 cuts; the censor argued it was fifteen main cuts but admitted they took 5 minutes. The censor said this was primarily because the film involved threat of sexual assault against a child.[15]\n\nCritical response\n\nUpon its release, the film received positive but cautious feedback from critics due to the film's content. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 92% of 25 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The website's consensus reads: \"An exemplary thriller powered by Robert Mitchum's chilling performance and Bernard Herrmann's sinister score, Cape Fear seethes with perfectly modulated tension.\"[16]\n\nBosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the \"tough, tight script\", as well as the film's \"steady and starkly sinister style.\" He went on to conclude his review by saying, \"this is really one of those shockers that provokes disgust and regret.\"[17] The entertainment-trade magazine Variety reviewed the film as \"competent and visually polished\", while commenting on Mitchum's performance as a \"menacing omnipresence.\"[18]\n\nHome media\n\nCape Fear was first made available on VHS on March 1, 1992. On May 14, 1992, it was released on laserdisc. It was later re-released on VHS, as well as DVD, on September 18, 2001. The film was released onto Blu-ray on January 8, 2013. It contains production photos and a \"making-of\" featurette.[19]"
