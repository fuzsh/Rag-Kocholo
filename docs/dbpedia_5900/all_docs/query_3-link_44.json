        "text": "I’ve been weirdly averse to this movie for years. Seeing DeNiro’s Max Cady design and some snippets of Scorsese’s unruliness, I thought it betrayed the dichotomy that was essential to the original. Mitchum’s Cady wears a clean face, and it’s only his domineering presence that indicates the malice underneath — the same clean face that covers up the cracks in Americana and the Bowden family. If these things are so clearly frayed from the immediate on-looker’s perspective, as is the case with this update, I figured the whole gambit was moot.\n\nBut I see now that Scorsese was diagnosing a different America here than J. Lee Thompson and co. The original had this clean facade because that’s what the country was wearing, and as the cracks were more than evident by 1991, there would be no use in keeping up a front that no longer existed, which liberated Scorsese to relish in the messiness. A more psychotic Cady, a more broken Bowden family. The most innocuous conversations have the camera doing whip-pans and 360º flips, rocking split diopters and some of the most felt cuts. The climax spirals into theatrics that harken back to the 60’s, but I sincerely believe the theatre scene that takes place between Cady and Danny halfway through the film is one of the most vile and harrowing moments in Scorsese’s entire oeuvre.\n\nThe moment that sealed the deal for me, though, which I’ve already brought up in various podcasts and videos and will continue to bring up at any opportunity, is the Fourth of July parade, where Iwo Jima reenactors look down on Bowden as he gives into temptation and beats up Cady. Scorsese takes an already loaded film and packs it even tighter with this perfect confluence of Catholic guilt and America’s fundamental malice. The soldiers look down on Bowden with the eyes of God and the eyes of postal stamp American idealism in one fell swoop. How far we’ve fallen, they seem to say — except for the fact that 20 feet in front of them is a giant confederate flag being paraded right next to the modern U.S. flag. The source of that American self-righteousness has been fundamentally crooked from the start.\n\nIt takes an unabashed paragon of evil like Cady to bring these truths to the surface, and once he’s done what are we left to do? Bear the trauma and saying nothing of it to each other."
