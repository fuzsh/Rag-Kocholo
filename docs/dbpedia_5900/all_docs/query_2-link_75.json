        "text": "Martin Scorsese’s first studio genre picture is a big, violent, widescreen remake of the 1962 thriller with Robert De Niro as the crazy con Max Cady, Nick Nolte as decent guy Sam Bowden, out to protect his family, and cameos from Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum, the stars of the original.\n\nIt was filmed in Florida, around Fort Lauderdale and its southern suburb Dania,on I-95 north of Miami, and in the subtropical wilderness of the Everglades, down on Florida's southern tip. If you want to visit, the main entrance to the Everglades National Park is on Route SR 9336 from Florida City, or off Route 41 at Shark Valley and Everglades City.\n\nYou’ll find ‘New Essex High School’, where Cady seduces Danielle (Juliette Lewis) into a bout of finger-sucking, in West Broward County (just east of Caddyshack's Rolling Hills Golf Club). It's Broward College, 3501 SW Davie Road, Davie.\n\nCady disturbingly clings to the underside of the family car at Seminole Indian Truck Stop, 4690 Orange Drive (North US Highway 27) at SW 45th Street, Weston.\n\n'New Essex' is Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, West Broward, where the ice cream store is the Rainbo Cafe, 1909 Hollywood Boulevard."
