        "text": "THURSDAY, MAY 16 AT 11:00AM\n\nRegular Admission Prices\n\nPasses Accepted\n\nExperience the greatest films from Hollywood’s Golden Age back on the big screen, every week at The Loft Cinema!\n\nGregory Peck and Robert Mitchum star in the shocking tale of revenge and murder, Cape Fear. Sam Bowden (Peck) is a small-town lawyer whose worst nightmare comes true when Max Cady (Mitchum, in a truly unnerving performance), the unhinged criminal he helped put away, returns to stalk his wife Peggy (Polly Bergen) and teenage daughter Nancy (Lori Martin). Despite help from the local police chief (Martin Balsam) and a private detective (Telly Savalas), Sam is legally powerless to keep Max from playing his sadistic game of cat and mouse. Finally, Sam must put his family’s lives at stake in a deadly trap that leads to one of the most suspenseful and heart-pounding confrontations ever committed to film. Remade to stunning effect by Martin Scorsese in 1991, the original Cape Fear is an unforgettable, pulse-pounding thriller that may give you a few sleepless nights! (Dir. by J. Lee Thompson, 1962, USA, 106 mins., Not Rated)"
