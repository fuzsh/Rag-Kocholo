Sextans is an extremely faint constellation with only one star brighter than magnitude 5. The brightest star in the constellation is Alpha Sextantis with a visual magnitude of only 4.48. It is a blue-white giant star located approximately 287 light years from Earth. It is considered to be an “equator star” because it lies within a quarter of a degree from the celestial equator. The second brightest star is Beta Sextantis with a magnitude of only 5.00. It is a blue-white dwarf star that sits about 345 light years from our solar system. Gamma Sextantis is the third brightest star with a magnitude of 5.07. It is a triple star system located some 262 light years away.

Sextans contains no Messier objects but does contain a few notable deep-sky objects. NGC 3115 is a lenticular galaxy that appears nearly edge-on to our line of sight. Sometimes referred to as the Spindle Galaxy, it is located only 31.6 million light years away from Earth. It is also the nearest galaxy believed to contain a supermassive black hole at its center. NGC 3169 and NGC 3166 are a pair of spiral galaxies that appear very close together. They are only 50,000 light years apart and will eventually merge to form a single larger galaxy. Sextans A and Sextans B are both irregular galaxies. Sextans B is one of the smallest irregular galaxies known to contain planetary nebulas.
