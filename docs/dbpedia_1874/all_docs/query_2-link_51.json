        "text": "Current Studies\n\nOverviews of ongoing and completed studies conducted by MetroHealth trauma experts.\n\nPREP-IT\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine which pre-operative solution, iodine-povacrylex or chlorhexidine gluconate, is better at lowering the risk of infection and complications requiring additional surgery in patients with fractures.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Nicholas Romeo\n\nCo-Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nBRT: Brake Response Time\n\nThis prospective study will examine total time to brake after fractures of the pelvis or legs. The time to weight bearing and the types and treatments of injuries will be evaluated.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nPTSD: Post-traumatic Stress Disorder\n\nPTSD is common in ortho/trauma patients. The Orthopaedic and trauma services started administering PTSD screening forms to evaluate patients at risk for PTSD. We are identifying risk factors for PTSD and providing treatment.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Mary Breslin\n\nRECALL\n\nThis study aims to evaluate potential effects of patient education regarding injury and treatment on patient (1) knowledge about their injury and treatment, (2) adherence to treatment recommendations, and (3) satisfaction with care.\n\nWe hypothesize an intervention consisting of education with feedback will permit better recall about injury and treatment recommendations. We also hypothesize that better recall will be associated with better patient satisfaction.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nMETRC Studies\n\nThe Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium (METRC) consists of a network of clinical centers (both civilian and military) to conduct multi-center clinical research studies relevant to the treatment and outcomes of Orthopaedic trauma. The overall goal of METRC is to produce the evidence needed to establish treatment guidelines for the optimal care of the wounded warrior and ultimately improve the clinical, functional and quality of life outcomes of both service members and civilians who sustain high energy trauma.\n\nCurrent Studies:\n\nMETRC: PREVENT CLOT\n\nThe study evaluates treatment to prevent blood clots after pelvis and leg injuries. It is a multi-center, prospective, randomized trial of subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered twice daily versus oral aspirin (ASA) taken twice daily. This trial will provide definitive evidence whether aspirin is just as effective as LMWH at preventing death and symptomatic blood clots, while potentially resulting in significantly fewer complications associated with the medicines.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD, Jeffrey Claridge, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl, Brianna Arko\n\nMETRC: REPAIR\n\nThe REPAIR study will improve recovery after femur (thigh bone) fracture. We will test the effectiveness of the REPAIR intervention (physical therapy (PT) plus blood flow restricted training when compared to usual care PT alone. We hypothesize that REPAIR will lead to improved long-term functional outcomes with increased muscle strength and muscle volume\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nMETRC: EMS BIND\n\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of emergent placement of circumferential Pelvic Compression on resuscitative measures required for life-threatening pelvic ring injuries. This trial will guide the development of future efficacy trials of three advanced resuscitation techniques (surgical pelvic packing, angioembolization, and REBOA).\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nUpcoming Studies:\n\nMETRC: TOBRA\n\nAntibiotic (vancomycin) powder placed into wounds has been shown to reduce infection. The purpose of this study is to review a new type of antibiotic power: tobramycin to compare the effect of Vancomycin powder to Vancomycin and Tobramycin powder combined in the reduction of post-fixation infections of tibial plateau and plafond fractures at high risk of infection.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nMETRC: SEXTANT\n\nThe proposed study is a multi-center, comparing current standard of care treatment to the SEXTANT treatment protocol in patients with Type III open fractures of the tibia and IIIB fractures of the ankle and hindfoot.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nMETRC: NSAIDs\n\nThe study is a randomized controlled multicenter trial looking at pain medications for patients with tibia (shin bone) fractures treated with intramedullary nail. The control group will receive standard pain management, and no nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The treatment intervention group will receive standard pain management plus up to six weeks of NSAIDs. NSAIDs give additional pain relief, but there is a small risk of bone healing being delayed. We believe that pain management with NSAIDs will result in improved pain control and lower opioid consumption but no difference in complications compared to standard of care pain management.\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Heather Vallier, MD\n\nCoordinator: Joanne Fraifogl\n\nPublications\n\nSelected bibliographic body of published work by MetroHealth trauma experts.\n\nPolytrauma: update on basic science and clinical evidence.\n\nNauth A, Hildebrand F, Vallier H, Moore T, Leenen L, Mckinley T, Pape HC.Nauth A, et al.
