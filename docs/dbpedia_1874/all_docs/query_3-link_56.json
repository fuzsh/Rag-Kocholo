        "meta_description": "The Milky Way is surrounded by 11 ‘classical’ satellite galaxies in a remarkable configuration: a thin plane that is possibly rotationally supported. Such a structure is thought to be highly unlikely to arise in the standard (ΛCDM) cosmological model (Λ cold dark matter model, where Λ is the cosmological constant). While other apparent discrepancies between predictions and observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies may be explained either through baryonic effects or by invoking alternative forms of dark matter particles, there is no known mechanism for making rotating satellite planes within the dispersion-supported dark matter haloes predicted to surround galaxies such as the Milky Way. This is the so-called ‘plane of satellites problem’, which challenges not only the ΛCDM model but the entire concept of dark matter. Here we show that the reportedly exceptional anisotropy of the Milky Way satellites is explained, in large part, by their lopsided radial distribution combined with the temporary conjunction of the two most distant satellites, Leo I and Leo II. Using Gaia proper motions, we show that the orbital pole alignment is much more common than previously reported, and reveal the plane of satellites to be transient rather than rotationally supported. Comparing with new simulations, where such short-lived planes are common, we find the Milky Way satellites to be compatible with standard model expectations. The ‘plane of satellite galaxies’ surrounding our Milky Way seemed to defy dark matter theory for 40 years. Observations now suggest that the alignment is transient, while new simulations form similar structures far more often than previously thought.",

        "text": "Another defining feature of a rotationally supported disk would be a significantly higher velocity dispersion parallel to the plane (σv∥) than perpendicular to it (σv⊥). However, for the MW’s classical satellites, we measure σv∥ = 165.1 ± 1.2 km s−1 and σv⊥ = 121.6 ± 0.4 km s−1. The ratio, σv∥/σv⊥ = 1.36, is indistinguishable from the purely geometrical factor of \\(\\sqrt{2}\\). By this basic measure, the plane is not rotation supported.\n\nThe longevity of the plane can also be tested directly via orbital integration. This method was first, but inconclusively, applied using pre-Gaia data35. In this work, we benefit from significantly more precise observations, including Gaia EDR3 proper motions and more accurate distances.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we saw that several satellites are presently crossing the plane, while Leo I and II, which dominate the inertia, are moving apart. To elucidate the impact of such ‘fortuitous alignments’ on the anisotropy, we show in Fig. 3 the effect on c/a and (c/a)red of randomizing the position of each galaxy on the sky at the observed radius, keeping all other galaxies at their observed positions. For Sagittarius, the satellite with the smallest distance, the c/a distribution is extremely narrow: Sagittarius contributes less than 1% to the inertia tensor. However, randomizing the angular position of either of the two outer satellites, Leo I or Leo II, raises the median value of c/a to 0.28 and 0.31, respectively, with maxima of 0.53 and 0.63, far above the ΛCDM median.\n\nWhile placing satellites at random sky coordinates highlights the sensitivity of c/a to individual galaxies, it is not a physical process. However, we also show at the top of Fig. 4 the anisotropy distributions when each satellite simply moves along its orbit. The time-averaged anisotropy of the system is then calculated over one full orbital period centred on the present time. Depending on the orbital phase of Leo II alone, c/a could be as high as 0.39, more isotropic than most ΛCDM systems. In other words, almost the entire anisotropy of the classical MW satellites is due to the orbital phases of Leo I and Leo II. Simply omitting both Leo I and Leo II from the analysis would yield c/a = 0.279, also more isotropic than 37% of ΛCDM systems of 9 satellites.\n\nThe bottom panels of Fig. 4 show time-averaged probability densities of c/a and (c/a)red when all satellites evolve simultaneously. The current value of c/a is significantly lower than in the recent past: over the past 0.5 and 1 Gyr, the time-averaged medians of c/a are 0.23 and 0.27 respectively, greater than 13% and 23% of ΛCDM systems. (c/a)red has varied widely. Neither metric is an invariant of the satellite system, both are sensitive to the orbital phases.\n\nThe four panels of Fig. 5 show the evolution of c/a, (c/a)red and of the orientations of the planes defined by the full and reduced inertia tensors, which we parametrize by the angles between the vectors normal to the planes, xc and xc,red, and their present day equivalents, xc,0 and xc,0,red. The value of c/a approaches the ΛCDM median within a lookback time of 0.5 Gyr. (c/a)red evolves more rapidly, twice exceeding the ΛCDM median. That c/a and (c/a)red vary on such different timescales is a further consequence of the radial distribution and of the fact that c/a and (c/a)red are determined by satellites at different radii and on orbits with different periods: while Leo I and Leo II, which largely determine c/a, have orbital periods of 3.4 ± 0.2 and 7.2 ± 0.3 Gyr, respectively, the eight inner satellites, which largely determine (c/a)red, all have orbital periods under 2 Gyr.\n\nWe further see that the orientation of the Milky Way’s plane of satellites is not stable, but has tilted by ~17° over the past 0.5 Gyr (and ~40° for the reduced definition). This is readily understood considering that the plane is largely defined by only two outlying satellites. This is demonstrated clearly in Fig. 6, where we show the orbits and positions of the 11 classical satellites projected edge-on, in the frame defined by the minor and major axes of the inertia tensor at z = 0. The central panel, which shows the positions of the satellites at z = 0, shows the plane aligned with the major axis, analogous to the bottom left panel of Fig. 1. The other four panels show the evolution up to 1 Gyr in the past and the future. The orientation of the plane of satellites is changing, so that at each moment, it points toward the current position of the outermost satellites. Rather than satellites orbiting inside a stable plane, the plane tilts as it tracks the positions of its most distant members.\n\nObservations\n\nWe adopt the sky positions and radial velocities from the McConnachie41 catalogue, and combine these, where available, with McConnachie and Venn23 proper motion measurements based on Gaia EDR3 (ref. 42). The systemic proper motions were measured within a Bayesian framework that combines information from stars with full astrometric data with information from stars with only photometric and proper motion data. The method is a mixture model that associates a probability for each candidate star to be associated with the target galaxy taking into account foreground and background contaminants. It constitutes the best technique currently available in the literature to determine proper motions and provides the most precise measurements so far37. For the three innermost satellites (Sagittarius dSph, the LMC and the SMC), where the McConnachie & Venn catalogue does not include proper motions, we use the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) proper motions of ref. 43. We further compiled the most recent estimates of the distance moduli of each satellite. The sky coordinates41, proper motions42,44 and distance moduli45,46,47,48,49,50 used in this study, including their sources, are listed in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nWe also repeated our analysis using the Gaia EDR3 proper motions of Battaglia et al.37 and the Gaia DR2 proper motions described in Riley et al.43. A comparison of the evolution of c/a and (c/a)red, analogous to Fig. 5, is shown in Extended Data Fig. 1. Unsurprisingly, the evolution based on the two EDR3 datasets are in excellent agreement. The main difference when using the DR2 data is the larger uncertainty (the astrometry errors of EDR3 are reduced by approximately a factor of two compared with DR2), but the evolution of both c/a and (c/a)red is essentially the same in all three datasets, and the results are consistent within the respective errors.\n\nMonte Carlo samples\n\nWe account for measurement errors by generating Monte Carlo samples of the satellites in the space of observed quantities: distance modulus, radial velocity and proper motions, as well as the position of the Sun relative to the Galactic Centre. We model each observable as a Gaussian distribution with the mean value and standard deviation given by the measurements and their quoted errors. For the Sun’s distance from the Galactic Centre we assume R⊙ = (8.178 ± 0.022) kpc (ref. 51), for the circular velocity at the Sun’s position Vcirc = (234.7 ± 1.7) km s−1 (ref. 52) and for Sun’s motion with respect to the local standard of rest (U, V, W) = (11.10 ± 0.72, 12.24 ± 0.47, 7.25 ± 0.37) km s−1 (ref. 53), where U is defined positive toward the Galactic center, V is positive in the direction of Galactic rotation and W is positive toward the North Galactic Pole.\n\nThe clustering of orbital poles\n\nTo characterize the clustering of orbital poles, we adopt the orbital pole dispersion for a subset of Ns satellites, Δstd, defined by Pawlowski and Kroupa26 as:\n\n$${{{\\varDelta }}}_{{{{\\mathrm{std}}}}}({N}_{{\\mathrm{s}}})=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{{N}_{{\\mathrm{s}}}}\\mathop{\\sum }\\limits_{i=1}^{{N}_{{\\mathrm{s}}}}{\\theta }_{i}^{2}},$$\n\n(3)\n\nwhere θi is the angle between the orbital pole of the ith satellite and the mean orbital pole of the satellites in the subset. To compute the clustering of an observed system relative to expectation, the same analysis is performed on the observations and simulations.\n\nBased on earlier Gaia DR2 and Hubble Space Telescope proper motions, Pawlowski and Kroupa26 calculated orbital pole dispersions for all possible satellite subsets in the MW and in simulations with Ns = 3...11, and discovered that Ns = 7 yielded the most unusual configuration. However, there is no a priori reason to specifically consider Ns = 7. When considering only a proper subset of satellites, the interpretation of Δstd(Ns) as evidence for unusual clustering is subject to the ‘look-elsewhere effect’. To account for this, we follow here the method of ref. 12, which involves performing the same analysis for the simulated systems. As in the observations, we consider all subsets of size Ns = 3...11 in each simulated system, and identify the most unlikely to arise by chance from an isotropic distribution, which we calculate based on 105 isotropic distributions of N = 11 points, and the probability distributions of Δstd(Ns) for all Ns = 3...11 possible subsets.\n\nIn Extended Data Fig. 2, we show a Hammer equal area projection of the most likely orbital poles and their Monte Carlo sampled uncertainty. The 3 black circles identify the clustering of 7 of the 11 satellites. The dotted line corresponds to Δstd(7) = 16.0°, the dispersion calculated by Pawlowski and Kroupa using pre-Gaia EDR3 data. The solid line shows our results, Δstd(7) = 23.2°, for the same satellites using Gaia EDR3 data. The dashed line shows our result for the most clustered subset Δstd(7) = 18.9°, exchanging Leo II for Leo I.\n\nTime evolution and time integration\n\nTo infer the time evolution of the Milky Way satellite system, the orbits of the satellites are integrated numerically as massless test particles in a static potential using the Gala package54. The potential consists of a disk, stellar nucleus and bulge, and a dark matter halo. The disk is modelled as an axisymmetric Miyamoto–Nagai disk55, which, for our default model, has disk mass 5.17 × 1010 M⊙, a = 3 kpc and b = 0.028 kpc (ref. 56). The nucleus and stellar bulge are both modelled as spherically symmetric Hernquist profiles57. For the nucleus we assume a mass of 1.71 × 109 M⊙ and a scale radius a = 0.07 kpc, and for the bulge we assume a mass of 5.0 × 109 M⊙ and a = 1.0 kpc. For the dark matter halo, we assume a spherically symmetric Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW)58 potential.\n\nUntil recently, the Milky Way halo mass may have been a prohibitive source of uncertainty for calculating the orbital evolution of the satellites, as its value was known only to within a factor of two59. However, the Galactic halo mass has now been estimated with an uncertainty of only about 20% using Gaia data. Multiple dynamical probes, such as the stellar rotation curve, the escape velocity, the motions of halo stars, globular clusters and satellite galaxies60,61,62,63,64, consistently imply a dark matter halo mass for the MW of M200 = (1.0 ± 0.2) × 1012 M⊙ and NFW concentration, c200 = 11 ± 2.\n\nBased on these results, we adopt a reference MW halo of mass 1.0 × 1012 M⊙ and a concentration parameter c200 = 11, corresponding to an NFW scale radius of rs = 19.2 kpc. The positions and velocities relative to the plane of satellites, and the orbital periods and apocentre distances for the default potential, are listed in Supplementary Table 1, where the quoted uncertainties reflect 68% confidence intervals for all quantities based on Monte Carlo sampling. Varying the MW potential within the observational uncertainties does not significantly affect the conclusions of our study, as we show in Extended Data Fig. 3 where we vary the halo mass between 0.8 and 1.2 × 1012 M⊙. The inferred anisotropies, as measured by c/a and (c/a)red, begin to diverge for lookback times beyond ~500 Myr, but the behaviour is qualitatively similar across the halo mass range. As shown in Extended Data Fig. 4, we also tested the impact of varying the other three mass components and the concentration parameter within the observational uncertainties, and found no significant effects. The true Milky Way potential evolves with time, but the dynamical time of the halo (~2 Gyr at z = 0) is much longer than the timescale for the reported dissolution of the plane of satellites (several hundred Myr). A further possible source of uncertainty may be the mass of the LMC and its perturbation of the potential. However, at a distance of 49 kpc from the centre, even a massive LMC does not significantly perturb the acceleration field at distances above 150 kpc (ref. 36) and would not significantly affect the orbits of the two most distant satellites, Leo I and Leo II.\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nInitial conditions\n\nThe simulations used in this work are cosmological zoom-in-constrained simulations, based on initial conditions created for the SIBELIUS project31 and designed to reproduce Local Group (LG) analogues within the observed large-scale structure. The simulations assume a ΛCDM cosmology with density parameters Ω0 = 0.307 and ΩΛ = 0.693 for matter and dark energy, respectively, an r.m.s. density variation on a scale of 8h−1 Mpc of σ8 = 0.8288 and a Hubble parameter of h = 0.6777. We use physical units throughout this work. Building on an octree representation of the phase information65, we used the methods described in ref. 66 to supplement the observationally constrained scales in the initial density field67,68 with independent random information below 3.2 comoving Mpc (cMpc). In total, we generated 60,000 simulations, resulting in several thousand loosely defined Local Group analogues. From these, we selected 112 for the high-resolution resimulations used in this work. All initial conditions refine a Lagrangian region extending to at least r = 3 Mpc around the centre of the LG at z = 0, with the remainder of a 1,0003 cMpc3 volume populated with progressively more massive particles. The simulations start at z = 127. More details about the initial conditions may be found in ref. 31.\n\nSimulations\n\nAll simulations used in this work were performed with the public version of the Gadget-4 code69, on the Cosmology Machine at the University of Durham and at the Finnish IT Center for Science. Extended Data Fig. 5 shows a comparison of one LG analogue at two different resolutions. The left panel corresponds to the resolution of the set of 60,000 simulations of the SIBELIUS project (particle mass 2.0 × 109 M⊙). At this resolution, a MW analogue halo contains approximately 500 particles, and only the largest substructures are identifiable. The right panel shows a simulation with a particle mass of 1.0 × 106 M⊙. At this resolution, a MW analogue halo contains approximately 106 particles, and an average of ~200 subhaloes down to 2 × 107 M⊙ can be identified within 300 kpc from the centre. All results presented in this paper are based on simulations at this resolution.\n\nStructure finding\n\nStructures and self-bound substructures were identified using the Friends-of-Friends and Subfind algorithms implemented in Gadget-4 at 60 snapshots equally spaced in time, from z = 4 until a lookback time of 1 Gyr, and a further 40 snapshots equally spaced over the final 1 Gyr up to z = 0. Given their mass and separation, the two most massive self-bound substructures of the LG analogues can either belong to the same or to separate Friends-of-Friends structures. Throughout this work, we refer to the two principal self-bound substructures of each LG analogue at z = 0 simply as ‘haloes’ and to the lower mass substructures within 300 kpc of the centre of potential of each halo as ‘satellites’. We select Local Group analogues as pairs of haloes with individual masses in the range 0.6–2.2 × 1012 M⊙, separated by 500–1,000 kpc, with radial velocity −150 < vr <−50 km s−1 and transverse velocity vt < 70 km s−1. In total, our set of high-resolution simulations contains 101 LG analogues, and, for the purposes of this work, we consider both haloes as a MW analogue.\n\nWe use Gadget’s on-the-fly merger tree construction to find the progenitors of these subhaloes at previous snapshots. We cut the chain of links when a subhalo’s progenitor is no longer found, or when a clear discontinuity in mass and position indicates that a satellite’s progenitor has been erroneously identified as the main halo. At each snapshot, we record the maximum circular velocity of each subhalo, xc,red and define vpeak as the highest value of vmax of a subhalo and its progenitors over time. Following ref. 17, we use the standard procedure to rank satellites by vpeak, and identify the top 11 within 300 kpc of each MW analogue at z = 0 as analogues to the classical MW satellites.\n\nObtaining a complete satellite sample\n\nAs noted above, the radial distribution of satellites is important for the anisotropy. Numerical simulations suffer from the artificial disruption of substructures, that can affect subhaloes far beyond the particle number limit at which they can theoretically be identified28,70. According to van den Bosch and Ogiya71, the main cause of this artificial tidal disruption is inaccurate force softening, which can cause force errors that, for particles within substructures, do not cancel out: once a particle is lost to the main halo, it cannot be recovered. Additionally, the amplification of discrete noise in the presence of a strong tidal field near the centre of a halo can lead to a runaway instability that can lead to the complete, but purely numerical, disruption of a subhalo.\n\nThese effects can, however, be mitigated using semi-analytical models (which populate merger trees constructed from simulated dark matter subhaloes with galaxies). These models include so-called ‘orphan’ galaxies, that is, galaxies whose dark matter subhalo has been numerically disrupted. After the subhalo is disrupted numerically, its subsequent evolution is followed by tracing the positions of its most bound particle32. Our ‘complete’ sample includes these ‘orphan’ subhaloes.\n\nOne important result of this work is that the ‘incomplete’ and ‘complete’ samples of satellite haloes have different radial distributions. Even though our high-resolution simulations resolve, on average, 200 surviving satellite haloes inside 300 kpc of each MW analogue at z = 0 and we rank the satellites by vpeak (vmax being more strongly affected by tidal stripping), we find that the radial distribution of the top 11 surviving satellites in the ‘incomplete’ samples are systematically and significantly less centrally concentrated than the MW’s brightest satellites.\n\nFigure 2 in the main text showed consistency between the radial distributions of the complete sample and the Milky Way satellites. It is reproduced in the top row of Extended Data Fig. 6. By contrast, the bottom row of Extended Data Fig. 6 shows how our comparison between simulations and observations would have looked had we considered only subhaloes from the incomplete samples. In the bottom left, it can be seen that their radial distribution is systematically offset from the MW data (shown as thick black line). For example, the innermost nine MW satellites are found within a distance of 140 kpc from the Galactic Centre, but none of the 202 incomplete samples has 9 satellites within this radius. The bottom-centre panel shows that the more uniform radial distributions of the incomplete samples lead to more equal contributions to the moment of inertia than in the case of the MW satellites. In fact, as shown on the bottom-right panel, none of the incomplete satellite systems have Gini coefficients as high as the MW’s and only two have c/a as low or lower. This is in line with previous studies (for example, refs. 22,26), which, presumably using incomplete subhalo populations, have found c/a values as low as the MW’s to be very rare.\n\nTo demonstrate the dependence of the anisotropy on the Gini coefficient and the radial concentration independently of our simulations, we also repeat the analysis on synthetic random data. The distributions shown in the top row of Extended Data Fig. 7 use a parent radial distribution that is uniform in r1/2, while those in the bottom row use one that is uniform in r; both parent angular distributions are isotropic. The relation between c/a and G is independent of the radial distribution, but the more centrally concentrated r1/2 distribution attains larger values of G and higher anisotropies than the more extended one.\n\nBaryonic effects\n\nIn hydrodynamic simulations, Milky Way mass haloes tend to be slightly more spherical than their counterparts in collisionless simulations72, which might reduce the anisotropy of subhaloes. Additionally, the adiabatic contraction induced by baryons can increase the concentration of the dark matter halo73, which can lead to a more central concentration of subhaloes but, conversely, could also enhance the disruption of subhaloes near the centre.\n\nThe presence of a stellar disk could also lead to additional disruption of subhaloes close to the centre of the galaxy74,75,76,77. To estimate its possible impact, we have calculated the fraction of subhaloes and orphans that pass through a cylinder whose radius, r = 4.3 kpc, is twice the scale-length and whose height, h = 0.5 kpc, is twice the scale-height of the MW disk during the past 1.3 Gyr. We find that in approximately half of the systems, none of the 11 satellites that we consider analogues of the classical satellites have passed through this disk, and at most one satellite has in ~83% of systems. Since satellites that passed through the disk are more likely to be found near the centre, this disruption could make the radial profiles slightly more extended. We find that this does not have a significant effect on our results: removing all satellites identified as having passed through the disk and replacing them with the next highest by vpeak only reduces the median Gini coefficient from 0.63 to 0.61, while it increases the median value of c/a from 0.35 to 0.36.\n\nSome authors have argued that, in aggregate, the various baryonic effects that could individually lead to higher or lower anisotropy can increase the anisotropy of satellite systems in ΛCDM13,35,78. On the other hand, refs. 26 and 20 concluded that baryons only have a negligible effect. A fully realistic simulation of the Milky Way satellite system would clearly include baryons, but we believe that the inclusion of baryons would, at the very least, not decrease the anisotropy significantly. In other words, including baryons is unlikely to make the ‘plane of satellite problem’ worse."
