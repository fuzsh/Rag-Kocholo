        "text": "Power LED\n\n-\n\nOur Power LED is the ultimate in LED technology. It blends together impressive light output and low power consumption without compromise. A cluster of three 1 watt LED chips in the centre of the fitting provide the most natural light, in the same style as a halogen . As standard, the Power LED module comes in 3200K and 4000K white as well as white to red and white to blue colour switching.\n\nSMD LED\n\n-\n\nThe SMD module is a less expensie alternative to our Power LED range. The SMD module represents excellent value for money, achieving a practical balance of performance and style. It is an excellent choice for those looking to use an LED solution whilst keeping an eye on costs. As standard, our SMD LED modules come in 3200K and 4000K white."
