        "meta_description": "MIS TLIF).\r\r\nSummary of Background Data: \r\r\nObesity is a proven risk factor for poorer outcomes in MIS TLIF patients. However, few studies have investigated the impact of body mass index (BMI) on achievement of a MCID for Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Physical Function (PROMIS PF).\r\r\nMethods: \r\r\nA prospective surgical database was retrospectively reviewed for primary, elective, single level MIS TLIF patients. Patients were categorized into BMI groups: nonobese (<30 kg/m2); obese I (≥30 and <35 kg/m2); severe (≥35 and <40 kg/m2); and morbid (≥40 kg/m2). Demographic, perioperative information, and complication rates were compared between groups. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) back and leg, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), 12-Item Short Form-12 Physical Composite Score (SF-12 PCS), and PROMIS PF were collected preoperatively and up to 2-year postoperatively. Impact of BMI on outcome measures and MCID achievement at all timepoints was evaluated.\r\r\nResults: \r\r\nA total of 162 patients were included with 88 patients categorized as normal weight, 37 obese I, 25 severe, and 12 morbid. SF-12 PCS, and PROMIS PF significantly differed by BMI at all timepoints, but only at 6- and 12-week for VAS back, preoperatively and 12 weeks for VAS leg, and preoperatively to 1-year for ODI. MCID achievement only differed for PROMIS PF and VAS back at 2 years, but did not for overall MCID achievement.\r\r\nConclusions: \r\r\nBMI is a significant predictor of ODI, SF-12 PCS, and PROMIS PF preoperatively to 1-year postoperatively, but only through 12-week for VAS scores. MCID achievement varied for PROMIS PF and VAS back, suggesting that though BMI may affect postoperative outcome values, obesity may impact a patient’s perception of meaningful improvements in pain and physical function....",
