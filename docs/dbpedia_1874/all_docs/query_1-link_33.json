        "text": "A Survey of the Resolved Stellar Content of Nearby Galaxies Currently Forming Stars\n\nTwo of our 10 M31 fields mosaiced together; color based upon our BVR images.\n\nThe galaxies of the Local Group serve as our laboratories for understanding star formation and stellar evolution in differing environments: the galaxies currently active in star-formation in the Local Group cover a factor of 10 in metallicity and span a range of Hubble types from dwarf spheroidal to Irr to Sb and Sc. We are conducting a uniform survey (UBVRI, Halpha, [SII], and [OIII]) of nearby galaxies selected on the basis of current star formation. In the Local Group, this sample includes M31, M33, NGC 6822, IC 1613, IC 10, WLM, Pegasus, and Phoenix; we exclude the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, which are being surveyed separately by seve ral groups. We also include Sextans A and Sextans B, located just beyond the Local Group (van den Bergh 1999a, 1999b). Using the new, wide-field Mosaic cameras, we are producing catalogs of UBVRI photometry of roughly a million stars, using Halpha, [SII], and [OIII] to distinguish bona fide stellar members from compact HII regions. This on-line catalog will answer a number of scientific questions directly, but we believe that the real strength of this survey will be in the science we will enable with 8-10-m class telescopes and the capability of follow-u p spectroscopy. In addition, the calibrated images will provide a detailed, uniform atlas of both the stellar and ionized gas components of these galaxies, which will certainly prove useful for a host of other projects.\n\nThe Team\n\nThe following compose our Survey Team:\n\nPhil Massey, Lowell Observatory\n\nPaul Hodge, University of Washington\n\nShay Strong (Holmes), Univ of Texas\n\nGeorge Jacoby, WIYN\n\nKnut Olsen, CTIO/NOAO\n\nAbhijit Saha, KPNO/NOAO\n\nWayne Schlingman, University of Arizona\n\nChris Smith, CTIO/NOAO\n\nNEW COLOR IMAGES (February 2007)\n\nCTIO has kindly put nice versions of our images as downloads; go to http://www.ctio.noao.edu/images/download_pict/local_group_survey.htm\n\nIn addition....

The stacked images can be downloaded either from ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/massey/lgsurvey or from http://www.archive.noao.edu/nsa/ The individual images can be obtained from http://www.archive.noao.edu/nsa/ Tell them Phil send you.\n\nOur UBVRI and narrow-band photometry is complete. The first paper ``A Survey of Local Group Galaxies Currently Forming Stars. I. UBVRI Photometry of Stars in M31 and M33 was published in Massey et al. 2006 AJ 131, 2478.\n\nThe second paper, ``...II. UBVRI Photometry of Stars in Seven Dwarfs and a Comparison of the Entire Sample\" has now also come out: Massey et al. 2007, AJ, 133, 2393."
