        "text": "\"Planning large astronomical missions is a long process. In some cases, such as the now functional James Webb Space Telescope, it can literally take decades. Part of that learning process is understanding what the mission will be designed to look for. Coming up with a list of what it should look for is a process, and on larger missions, teams of scientists work together to determine what they think will be best for the mission. In that vein, a team of researchers from UC Berkeley and UC Riverside have released a paper on the arXiv preprint server describing a database of exoplanets that could be worth the time of NASA's new planned habitable planet survey, the Habitable Worlds Observatory HWO. Astronomy's decadal surveys are the starting point for many ambitious projects, and the Astro2020 Decadal Survey didn't disappoint. It called for NASA to develop a 6-meter space telescope capable of high-contrast observations in optical, infrared, and ultraviolet wavelengths. That project became known as the HWO; its primary mission is to observe 25 different exoplanets in their parent star's habitable zones and look for biosignatures on them. Essentially, it will be humanity's best alien finder. While not searching biosignatures, it can also do general astronomy, but knowing what planets to look at is critical to its mission. To tackle that part of the project, a NASA project known as the Exoplanet Exploration Program developed a list of 164 candidate exoplanets \"whose [hypothetical] exo-Earths would be the most accessible\" for the HWO. Mainly, that accessibility had to do with the characteristics of the planet's parent star, but its separation from that star was also considered.\"...

These stations are typically equipped with advanced telescopes, detectors, and instruments that allow astronomers to study various aspects of the universe, such as stars, planets, galaxies, nebulae, and other cosmic phenomena. Observatory stations are often situated in remote locations with minimal light pollution to maximize the clarity of observations. They can be found atop mountains, in deserts, or even in space aboard orbiting satellites. Some observatories specialize in specific areas of research, like solar observatories that focus on the sun or radio observatories that detect radio waves emitted by celestial objects. These stations play a crucial role in advancing our understanding of the cosmos. They contribute to scientific research, discovery of new celestial objects, exploration of exoplanets, understanding the origins of the universe, and studying various astronomical phenomena. Additionally, observatories often engage in public outreach and education, allowing visitors to learn about astronomy and experience the wonders of the universe firsthand through guided tours, workshops, and stargazing events.

Soon, the pressure and heat of that hydrogen will cause a thermonuclear explosion. If you're looking into the night sky around August and September, you will see a pre-eruption dip in light emitted by T CrB. But if you miss any of this, \"NASA and the global astronomical community plan to leave no stone unturned when T CrB...appears to the naked eye...\" The network includes such community members as the James Webb Space Telescope and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array, in New Mexico (I vote this one is the best named of all of the network list). \"Recurrent novae are unpredictable and contrarian. When you think there can‚Äôt possibly be a reason they follow a certain set pattern, they do‚Äîand as soon as you start to rely on them repeating the same pattern, they deviate from it completely. We‚Äôll see how T CrB behaves.‚Äù And that about sums it up!\n\nCongratulations to UNISTELLAR and SETI Institute citizen astronomers for the confirmation of a warm Jupiter exoplanet! ü™ê In this study, soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal, observers with our Exoplanet Transits program teamed up with NASA Exoplanets Exoplanet Watch to capture the passing of this planet in front of its star and confirm its existence. This gas giant had previously only been a \"planet candidate\" seen by NASA's TESS mission, but thanks to citizen scientists, it is now an official planet. Thank you Astronomy magazine for this fantastic article! https://buff.ly/3XwOtgf \"While the method relies on pure chance, TESS observes so many stars all across the sky that it has so far amassed over 7,000 candidate worlds. But because TESS is so busy trying to detect as many planets as possible, almost all of these detections rely on a single transit event: just one pass of the exoplanet in front of its star. The task of confirming the existence of the exoplanet is left to follow-up surveys with ground-based observatories, which is a tedious, difficult, and time-consuming job. This is where citizen scientists come to the rescue. Using a network of telescopes scattered across the globe, amateur astronomers can perform the necessary observations needed to turn a candidate exoplanet into a confirmed one. Recently, the Unistellar Network and Exoplanet Watch has confirmed a new exoplanet, TIC 393818343 b, which sits about 300 light-years away from Earth.\"\n\nLight from an exoplanet captured in the visible spectrum for the first time Astronomers have been discovering exoplanets, or planets around alien stars, for almost 20 years though not in a very direct way. These discoveries were purely scientific, and therefore the milestone that we are writing about in this note should almost give rise to goosebumps. We first saw an exoplanet directly in 2008. Now we have the first official detection of exoplanet light in the visible spectrum, made by planet hunter HARPS and ESO's 3.6-meter telescope at La Silla Observatory in Chile. This exoplanet orbits the star 51 Pegasi about 50 light-years from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. Remarkably, this exoplanet 51 Pegasi b is the first exoplanet we discovered in 1995 that orbits an ordinary star like our Sun. For amateur astronomers, 51 Pegasi has a magnitude of 5.49, which means you can easily see it without binoculars or a telescope if you step out into a clear night sky. Luckily, we have much more sophisticated equipment to strain our eyes at not-so-distant stars. Although there are a number of methods for searching for exoplanets around stars, the most commonly used method to analyze an exoplanet's atmosphere is transmission spectroscopy. Using this method, astronomers measure the star's spectrum, which is filtered by the planet's atmosphere during transit. When a star passes in front of a planet, you can get information about the exoplanet's temperature. However, this method is quite difficult because exoplanets are extremely dim compared to their parent star and are often completely lost in the rays of the latter. This detection method is of great scientific importance because it allows us to measure the real mass and inclination of the planet s orbit, which is important for a more complete understanding of the system, says Jorge Martins, leader of the team of scientists who obtained the image. It also allows us to estimate a planet s reflectivity, or albedo, which can be used to determine the composition of a planet s surface and atmosphere. 51 Pegasi is estimated to be 7-8 billion years old, a couple billion years older than our Sun. Although the exoplanet 51 Pegasi b is considered a hot Jupiter and is unlikely to harbor life, the idea that it could host a civilization older than ours is exciting. Scientists continue to make observations with advanced telescopes: the Very Large Telescope and the soon-to-be launched European Extremely Large Telescope. Last week, NASA announced it was bringing together experts from a variety of scientific fields in a new coalition to search for alien life on planets beyond our solar system.

Two NASA-funded teams of amateur astronomers are tracking you with their backyard telescopes. These two teams, called UNITE (UNISTELLAR Network Investigating TESS Exoplanets) and Exoplanet Watch, have combined forces to confirm a new planetary discovery‚Äîa toasty \"warm Jupiter\". \"I pinch myself every day when I recall that I have made a meaningful scientific contribution to astronomy by helping professional astronomers confirm and characterize a new exoplanet,‚Äù said Darren Rivett, a volunteer from Australia who contributed to the effort. Planets around other stars, called exoplanets, sometimes block the light from the stars they orbit. When this happens, it‚Äôs called a ‚Äútransit‚Äù. Amateur astronomers can observe exoplanet transits with their own telescopes by watching for the light from a nearby star to dim. NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sees these dimming events, too‚Äîmany thousands of them. But just seeing a star dim once is not enough. You need to catch multiple dimming events (and perform various other checks) to know that you‚Äôve found a new exoplanet. That‚Äôs where volunteers from the UNITE and Exoplanet Watch projects come in. These two teams of amateur astronomers have collaborated with the SETI Institute to detect the transit of an object called TIC 393818343 b (aka TOI 6883 b)---proving to the world that this object does indeed contain a planet orbiting a star.\n\nNebula Kohoutek 3-46: A ‚ÄòButterfly‚Äô from Death‚Äôs Door | Gemini North Telescope FriendsofNASA.org | High-res image: https://lnkd.in/gdt2-Wgs This ghostly, butterfly-shaped planetary nebula, captured by the Gemini North telescope, one half of the International Gemini Observatory, supported in part by the U.S. National Science Foundation and operated by NOIRLab, is known as Kohoutek 3-46. Kohoutek 3-46 derives its name from the prolific planetary nebula hunter that discovered it, Czech astronomer Lubo≈° Kohoutek. Located in the constellation Cygnus, Kohoutek 3-46 is estimated to be around 20,000 years old and around 7,200 light-years away. The term ‚Äòplanetary nebula‚Äô is a misnomer, since these nebulae are unrelated to planets. The term originates from their planet-like round shape. Kohoutek 3-46 has expanded into an unusual bipolar shape, classified by its well-defined hourglass shape, prominent equatorial ring and marked waist. About 10‚Äì20% of planetary nebulae are bipolar. No matter the shape they take on, these glowing clouds of gas form after a star of one to eight times the mass of the Sun has expanded into a red giant. As the core of the red giant contracts, the star expels layers of its atmosphere into space. Energetic ultraviolet radiation from the hot, exposed core then ionizes this gaseous shell around it, ‚Äòilluminating‚Äô the planetary nebula. Since 2002, Gemini North has also been known as the Frederick C. Gillett Gemini North telescope. Dr. Gillett, who died in April 2001, was one of the primary visionaries of the Gemini telescopes. He was instrumental in assuring that the design of Gemini's twin 8-meter telescopes would make major scientific contributions to astronomy.

Light curves of TOI-1135 for the eight sectors of TESS. An international team of astronomers reports the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star. The newfound alien world, designated TOI-1135 b is young, hot and comparable in size to Saturn. To date, NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified nearly 7,100 candidate exoplanets (TESS Objects of Interest, or TOI), of which 420 have been confirmed so far. Since its launch in April 2018, TESS, with its array of wide-field cameras, is conducting a survey of about 200,000 of the brightest stars near the sun with the aim of searching for transiting exoplanets, including giant extrasolar worlds. A group of astronomers led by Manuel Mallorqu√≠n D√≠az of the University of La Laguna, Spain, has now confirmed another TOI monitored by TESS. They identified a transit signal in the light curve of TOI-1135 (also known as HIP 62908 or TIC 154872375)‚Äîa young solar-type star of spectral type G0 at a distance of some 371 light years. The planetary nature of this signal was confirmed by follow-up photometry and spectroscopy. \"This paper introduces the discovery and mass characterization of a close giant gas planet orbiting the young solar-type star TOI-1135,\" the researchers wrote. TOI-1135 b has a radius of about 0.8 Jupiter radii and its mass is approximately 0.062 Jupiter masses, which yields a density at a level of 0.16 g/cm3. The planet orbits its host every 8.02 days, at a distance of 0.082 AU from it. The equilibrium temperature of TOI-1135 b is estimated to be around 950‚Äì1,200 K. Therefore, the obtained results indicate that TOI-1135 b is an inflated exoplanet, similar in size to Saturn, however less massive than the solar system's two biggest gaseous giants. The planet has an extended atmosphere, most probably due to strong stellar radiation. The astronomers assume that TOI-1135 b may be in the process of losing its atmosphere by photoevaporation. They noted that the planet has a high mass-loss rate of about 39 Earth masses per one billion years, so it will eventually lose most of its atmosphere in a few hundred million years. \"Giant planets with masses less than Saturn are susceptible to losing all or most of their atmosphere in their early stages if they receive enough radiation from a host star, which might be the case of TOI-1135 b,\" The parent star, TOI-1135, is slightly larger and more massive than the sun, while its luminosity is at a level of 1.7 solar luminosities. The star is estimated to be between 125 million and 1 billion years old, and its effective temperature is approximately 6,122 K. #exoplanet #TOI-1135b #tess #astronomers #radiation #stars #equilibrium"
