        "text": "The universe continues to unveil its secrets, and NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is at the forefront of this revolution. Recently, an international team of researchers mapped the weather on the distant exoplanet WASP-43 b, located 280 light-years away. Using precise brightness measurements and advanced 3D climate models, they have uncovered extraordinary details about this hot gas giant's atmospheric conditions, including thick clouds, clear skies, and rapid equatorial winds.\n\nRead more:\n\nJames Webb Space Telescope uncovers young stars in NGC 346’s dusty ribbons\n\nThe Pale Blue Dot Photo: History, Significance, and Legacy\n\nPale Blue Dot Image: What About Large Format Prints like Fine Art?\n\nWilliam Bill Anders Tribute: Astronaut, Earthrise Photographer, Aviator\n\nJADES-GS-z14-0: NASA's JWST Discovering the Most Distant Galaxy\n\nThe Earthrise Photo: A Journey Through Earth’s Iconic Space Portrait\n\nEnceladus holds potential for alien life with recent discovery of vital element\n\nAnticipating the celestial show – Betelgeuse's potential supernova event\n\nSupernova 2020eyj: First radio signal from the massive explosion of a dying white dwarf\n\nIf there's life on TRAPPIST-1, it would be hard to detect\n\nLAMOST discovered pre-low-mass white dwarf binary\n\nHubble Telescope Captures a Stellar Trio: The Dawn of a Sun-like Star\n\nDiscovering WASP-43 b: A Hot Jupiter Exoplanet\n\nWhat is WASP-43 b?\n\nWASP-43 b is a \"hot Jupiter,\" a gas giant similar in size to Jupiter but much hotter. It orbits its star at a mere 1.3 million miles, causing extreme temperatures and unique atmospheric conditions. This close orbit, completed in just 19.5 hours, results in the planet being tidally locked, with one side facing the star continuously while the other remains in darkness.\n\nTidally Locked Giant\n\nThe term \"tidally locked\" means that the planet's rotational period matches its orbit around the star, much like how our Moon always shows the same face to Earth. This leads to one hemisphere constantly bathed in starlight while the other remains perpetually dark.\n\nLeveraging the James Webb Space Telescope's Capabilities\n\nWASP-43 b: Mid-Infrared Observations with JWST\n\nResearchers utilized JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to measure light variations from the WASP-43 system every 10 seconds over a 24-hour period, creating a comprehensive temperature map across the planet.\n\nSupersonic Winds and Dramatic Temperature Differences on WASP-43 b\n\nOn the star-facing dayside, temperatures soar to nearly 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,250 degrees Celsius), while the nightside cools down to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius). These temperature shifts are driven by supersonic winds exceeding 5,000 miles per hour, redistributing heat and causing a notable eastward shift of the planet's hottest spot.\n\nThis set of maps illustrates the temperature of the hot gas-giant exoplanet WASP-43 b's visible side as it orbits its star. The dayside of the planet becomes visible just before and after it passes behind the star. These temperatures were determined from over 8,000 brightness measurements of 5- to 12-micron mid-infrared light detected by the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope. Generally, hotter objects emit more mid-infrared light.\n\nCredits: Science: Taylor J.

The nightside appears dimmer and cooler due to thick, high-altitude clouds that trap infrared radiation, while the dayside remains largely clear.\n\nThis phase curve, captured by the MIRI low-resolution spectrometer on NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, tracks the brightness changes of the WASP-43 system as the planet orbits its star. The system shines brightest when the hot dayside of the planet faces the telescope, just before and after it passes behind the star, and grows dimmer as the nightside comes into view. It brightens again after the planet passes in front of the star as the dayside rotates back into view.

Bell (BAERI); Joanna Barstow (Open University); Michael Roman (University of Leicester) Graphic Design: NASA, ESA, CSA, Ralf Crawford (STScI)\n\nWater Vapor and Missing Methane\n\nBoth the dayside and nightside atmospheres showed clear signs of water vapor. However, methane, expected to be found on the cooler nightside, was notably absent. The fast-moving winds prevent methane formation, maintaining a uniform atmospheric chemistry across the planet.\n\nCheck also:\n\nM31: Star that changed the universe\n\nNili Fossae: Explore the Legendary Scars of Mars\n\nStunning history behind the Black Hole image\n\nUnexpected shape of the kilonova explosions\n\nAT2018fyk: the star survives a close encounter with a black hole only to meet it again\n\nFirst known binary system composed of two Y-type brown dwarfs\n\nMagellan shows volcanic activity on Venus – VERITAS mission to investigate\n\nNASA's Lucy Mission: new target gets a name\n\nConclusion\n\nNASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has significantly advanced our understanding of exoplanetary weather with its detailed observations of WASP-43 b.\n\nUsing mid-infrared light and advanced modeling, researchers have painted a comprehensive picture of the planet’s dynamic atmosphere. These discoveries are vital for future explorations of exoplanetary atmospheres and potentially habitable worlds.\n\nWASP-43 b: A hot Jupiter orbiting 280 light-years away.\n\nTidal Locking: One side always faces the star, resulting in extreme temperature differences.\n\nHigh-Speed Winds: Equatorial winds reaching 5,000 mph transport heat across the planet.\n\nCloud Dynamics: Thick clouds on the nightside and clear skies on the dayside.\n\nAtmospheric Composition: Presence of water vapor; absence of methane due to rapid atmospheric mixing.\n\nFAQ: Understanding WASP-43 b and Beyond\n\n1. What is WASP-43 b?\n\nWASP-43 b is a hot Jupiter exoplanet, similar in size to Jupiter but with much higher temperatures due to its close proximity to its star.\n\n2. Why is WASP-43 b tidally locked?\n\nThe planet's orbit is so close to its star that gravitational forces have caused it to have the same rotational period as its orbital period, resulting in one side always facing the star.\n\n3. How did JWST map the weather on WASP-43 b?\n\nJWST used its Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) to measure light variations over a 24-hour period, allowing researchers to create a detailed temperature map of the planet.\n\n4. What temperatures are observed on WASP-43 b?\n\nTemperatures reach nearly 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,250 degrees Celsius) on the dayside and drop to 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius) on the nightside.\n\n5. What are supersonic winds?\n\nSupersonic winds on WASP-43 b exceed 5,000 miles per hour, transporting heat from the dayside to the nightside.\n\n6. What is the significance of the missing methane?\n\nThe absence of methane on the nightside suggests rapid atmospheric mixing, preventing methane formation.\n\n7. What role do clouds play in WASP-43 b’s atmosphere?\n\nThick clouds on the nightside trap infrared light, making the side appear cooler than it would without clouds.\n\n8. How does WASP-43 b’s atmosphere compare to Earth’s?\n\nWhile vastly different in composition and temperature, studying WASP-43 b's dynamic atmosphere can help scientists understand weather patterns on other planets.\n\n9. What is phase curve spectroscopy?\n\nA technique measuring tiny changes in brightness as a planet orbits its star, helping to infer atmospheric conditions.\n\n10. Why is this discovery important for future exoplanet studies?\n\nMapping weather on exoplanets like WASP-43 b helps scientists understand their atmospheres and edges us closer to finding potentially habitable worlds.\n\nRESOURCES"
