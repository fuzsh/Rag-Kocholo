Please find attached a picture of the back of the index mirror. From the instruction manual it is unclear whether the screw that adjusts the perpendicularity error is the one circled in red or the one circled in green.\n\nWhat do you guys think?\n\nThanks!\n\nI have read those pages, and that is the part which is unclear: The line which starts from ‘C’ in the image on page 11 points to nowhere in the middle of the horizon mirror.\n\nThank you. Do you know what is the size of the square in the key for the Tamaya MS 833 sextant? I have been looking for that key online, it appears to be a clock key, and it comes in different sizes, see for example here.\n\nThe size of the square for the Tamaya MS 833 is around 2mm (2 mm would be a 00 key), but I don’t have a calipers and it could be also 2,25 mm or 2,5 mm."
