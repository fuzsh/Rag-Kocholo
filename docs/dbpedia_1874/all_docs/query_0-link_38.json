OPTICAL PHOTOMETRIC AND STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF LOCAL GROUP DWARFS\n\nMeasurement of the integrated photometric and structural properties of Local Group dwarfs is challenging. Because they are so close, many Local Group dwarfs are quite extended, ranging from under 10 arcmin in diameter to over 40°. Few telescope/detector combinations can survey the entire extent of the larger systems in one or even several exposures (though see Kent 1987, Bothun & Thompson 1988). Nearly all Local Group dwarfs have very low surface brightnesses, which not only makes it difficult to discover these galaxies but greatly complicates obtaining reliable follow-up photometry. Nonetheless, there have been many attempts over the past 35 years to study the integrated properties and structural parameters of Local Group dwarfs. Hodge, de Vaucouleurs, and Ables pioneered these studies, and in many cases their results remain the only ones available (e.g. Hodge 1963a, b, 1973;, de Vaucouleurs & Ables 1965, 1968, 1970;, Ables 1971;, Ables & Ables 1977).\n\n3.1. Integrated Photometry\n\nTable 3 lists the integrated V-band magnitudes and, when available, the integrated colors of Local Group dwarfs. In some cases, these values are based on observations of only a small fraction of the galaxy. For example, less than 1% of the surface area of Sagittarius has been measured photometrically (Mateo et al 1995c, 1996;, Fahlman et al 1996), though a large fraction has been mapped photographically (Ibata et al 1997). Combined with the distance and reddening values in Table 2, the photometry in Table 3 can be used to derive integrated absolute magnitudes and luminosities (Table 4) and the luminosity function (LF) of the Local Group (Figure 4). For MB -14, the Local Group LF matches that of the \"poor\" groups studied by Ferguson & Sandage (1991). The best-fitting Schechter (1976) LF for the poor groups of Ferguson & Sandage (1991) is also shown. Note that the analytic expression, if extrapolated as in Figure 4, implies that the Local Group contains many galaxies less luminous than MB ~ -12 that have yet to be discovered.\n\nTable 3.

For NGC 205, rc is estimated from surface-brightness profile as the location where the central surface brightness drops a factor of two below the level listed in this table. Both M32 and NGC 205 exhibit composite-surface-brightness profiles; no single King model, exponential profile, or power-law profile can fit the observed profiles at all radii. m The outer isophotes of M32 are not truncated according to Kent (1987). n The position angle and e values refer to the inner bar structure. o Aparicio et al (1997a) found that the radialsurface-brightness profile is best fit with two exponential components. The values of rexp refer to the inner and outer components, respectively. The two exponential components meet at a radial distance of 40 arcsec from the center of the galaxy.\n\nTable 4.

See footnote m for details about values in parentheses. m The interstellar medium (ISM) velocity dispersion of these galaxies is assumed to be 8 km s-1 (see Table 7). n The central mass density has not been determined kinematically for these galaxies. Instead, we assume 0 = 2.5 I0. o The results given here for NGC 55 are especially uncertain because of internal reddening that affects the inferred total luminosity and central luminosity density. See Puche et al (1991) for a complete discussion and for more precise estimates of the luminosity and mass of this galaxy. Note that these authors assumed a distance of 1.6 Mpc for NGC 55, in contrast to the distance of 1.48 ± 0.15 Mpc used here (Table 2). p Owing to the possible presence of a massive central black hole, the nuclear kinematics are too complex for the simple analysis used here. See Kormendy & Richstone (1995) for details. q MHI / Mtot 1.0. This indicates an error in the distance (MHI / Mtot D, where D is the distance), a misinterpretation of or error in the kinematic data, an error in the HI flux measurement, or some combination of these. r Sagittarius probably violates the assumption of equilibrium that is implicitly adopted in the analysis used here and its structural parameters remain highly uncertain. The mass and M / L ratios given here are taken directly from Ibata et al (1997). Rc and 0 are also taken from this source.\n\nFigure 4. The differential luminosity function of galaxies in the Local Group based on the data in Table 4. The upper and lower panels show the V- and B-band luminosity functions (LFs), respectively. The lower panel also shows a best-fitting Schechter (1976) function ( = -1.16, M*,B = -21.42) and the empirical LF that Ferguson & Sandage (1991) derived for their sample of \"poor\" groups. Both LFs are scaled to match approximately the cumulative galaxy counts for MB -14.\n\nFigure 5 is the color-magnitude diagram of the Local Group based on the integrated V-band absolute magnitudes (MV0) and (B-V)0 colors. The giant/dIrr galaxies are segregated from the early-type galaxies (denoted as a dotted line in Figure 5). EGB 0427+63 is the only dIrr that lies redward of this boundary, but its photometric properties and reddening are poorly known (Karachentseva et al 1996). The transition galaxies - so named in Table 1 solely on the basis of their morphological properties - are located close to but on both sides of the dIrr-early-type dividing line. NGC 205 is a luminous dSph system that contains a bright central region of recent star formation and has a luminous blue nucleus (Hodge 1973, Price 1985); it is located on the dIrr side of the dividing line in Figure 5. The smaller region of young stars in NGC 185 (Hodge 1963b) has a negligible effect on that galaxy's integrated colors (Price 1985).\n\nFigure 5. The MV0-(B-V)0 color-magnitude diagram of Local Group galaxies based on the data from Tables 2 and 3. The diagonal dashed line separates galaxies classified as Spirals, or Irregular systems (filled squares; Table 1), and dSph or Elliptical systems (open circles). Five \"transition\" objects, Antlia, LGS 3, Phoenix, Pegasus, and DDO 210, are plotted as filled triangles; NGC 205 is plotted as a filled circle.\n\n3.2. Structural Properties\n\nIn the optical, the structure of Local Group dIrr galaxies is dominated by star-forming complexes and OB associations with typical diameters of 200-300 pc (Fisher & Tully 1979, Hodge et al 1991a, b; see the \"Images\" references in Table 1). These clumps are usually not found near the optical center of symmetry of the galaxies. NGC 3109 - one of the most luminous dIrr galaxies in the sample - shows clear evidence for spiral structure underlying a patchy morphology (Demers et al 1985, Sandage & Carlson 1988). In all suitably studied Local Group dIrr systems, the clumpy young stellar populations are superimposed on a more extended, smoother, and symmetric distribution of older stars (Hodge et al 1991a, b;, Minniti & Zijlstra 1996). Either dynamical effects smooth out the structures with time, or else the star-formation regions migrate through individual galaxies, eventually forming a more symmetric sheet of old stars (Skillman & Bender 1995, Hunter & Plummer 1996, Dohm-Palmer et al 1997).\n\nThe early-type dwarfs of the Local Group are dominated by a symmetric spheroidal component (Hodge 1971, Irwin & Hatzidimitriou 1995), with occasional instances of superimposed concentrations of relatively young stars (NGC 185 and NGC 205: Hodge 1963b, 1973;, Price & Grasdalen 1983;, Price 1985;, Lee et al 1993b). Of interest, the star-forming regions in NGC 185 and NGC 205 are similar in size to those seen in dIrr galaxies, but these young stars are found near, though slightly offset from, the centers of the galaxies. Demers et al (1994b, 1995) carefully searched for substructure in a number of dSph systems but found weak evidence for such structure only in Ursa Minor (Olszewski & Aaronson 1985).\n\nOnly three Local Group dwarfs contain nuclei: NGC 205, Sagittarius, and M32. The latter is now widely believed to contain a massive central black hole (Kormendy & Richstone 1995). The nucleus of NGC 205 is extremely blue (Price & Grasdalen 1983, Lee 1996), dynamically colder than the surrounding galaxy envelope (Carter & Sadler 1990), and has a spectrum dominated by young stars (Bica et al 1990, Jones et al 1996). The existence of a nucleus of Sagittarius - the globular cluster M54 - is somewhat controversial. Da Costa & Armandroff (1995) argued that the velocity dispersion and metallicity of M54 are incompatible with its identification as a normal dSph nucleus. However, M54 is the second most luminous globular cluster in the entire Milky Way, nearly as luminous as the nucleus of NGC 205 (Peterson 1993); exhibits an internal abundance dispersion (Sarajedini & Layden 1995); and is located close to the center of symmetry of Sagittarius (Ibata et al 1994, 1997). Such an unusual object seems unlikely to have been merely an isolated globular cluster in a dSph galaxy such as Sagittarius."
