        "text": "In simplistic terms, all non-rogue stars, like planets, orbit around a central object, although that is actually not true. Where is the centre of the Solar System. For simplicity it's the central star, such as the Sun. In the case of a star, it's the galactic centre. The constellations we see today will be different than they were 50,000 years ago or 50,000 years from now.\n\nProper motion details the movements of these stars and is measured in milliarcseconds. 24 Sextantis is moving -34.92 ± 0.26 milliarcseconds/year towards the north and 66.21 ± 0.38 milliarcseconds/year east if we saw them in the horizon.\n\nThe radial velocity, the speed at which the 24 Sextantis is moving away from the Sun, is 7.09000 km/s with an error of about 0.23 km/s . When the value is negative, the star and the Sun are getting closer to one another; likewise, a positive number means that two stars are moving away. It's nothing to fear as the stars are so far apart they won't collide in our lifetime, if ever.\n\nThe table is scrollable if you can't see everything, just swipe the table to see the hidden information.\n\nPrimary Name24 SextantisSpectral TypeG5Star TypeHigh Proper-Motion StarColouryellowGalaxyMilky WayConstellationSextansMain StarNoAge2.7 million yearsAbsolute Magnitude2.08 / 2.00Visual / Apparent Magnitude6.45Visible From EarthYesRight Ascension (R.A.)10h 23m 28.33Declination (Dec.)-00° 54` 07.8Galactic Latitude44.71563108 °Galactic Longitude245.08502620 °1997 Distance from Earth13.37000 Parallax (milliarcseconds)243.95 Light Years74.79 Parsecs2007 Distance from Earth12.91000 Parallax (milliarcseconds)252.64 Light Years77.46 Parsecs15,977,160.561 Astronomical UnitsGalacto-Centric Distance24,214.367 Light Years / 7,424 ParsecsProper Motion Dec.-34.92000 ± 0.26000 milliarcseconds/yearProper Motion RA.66.21000 ± 0.38000 milliarcseconds/yearB-V Index0.91Radial Velocity7.09000 ± 0.23 km/sEccentricity0.20240Semi-Major Axis8057.0000000Luminosity (Lsun)14.1540000Mass (Solars)1.5400Effective Temp.
