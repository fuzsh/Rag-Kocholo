It's part of the Hercules constellation family. Sextans is best seen in April (from latitudes +80° to -80°).\n\nSextans can be found between Hydra and Leo. Until the late 1600’s this group of stars represented a fin on the back of the multi-headed monster Hydra. Hevelius named the constellation in 1687 for the astronomical instrument used to measure the positions of the stars. His own sextant was destroyed along with other instruments in a fire at his observatory in 1679."
