        "text": "We present a comprehensive spectroscopic study of the integrated light of metal-rich Galactic globular clusters and the stellar population in the Galactic bulge. We measure line indices which are de ned by the Lick standard system and compare index strengths of the clusters and Galactic bulge. Both metal-rich globular clusters and the bulge are similar in most of the indices, except for the CN index. We nd a signi cant enhancement in the CN=hFei index ratio in metal-rich globular clusters compared with the Galactic bulge. The mean iron index hFei of the two metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6528 and NGC 6553 is comparable with the mean iron index of the bulge. Index ratios such as Mgb=hFei, Mg2=hFei, Ca4227=hFei, and TiO=hFei, are comparable in both stellar population indicating similar enhancements in individual elements which are traced by the indices. From the globular cluster data we fully empirically calibrate several metallicity-sensitive indices as a function of [Fe/H] and nd ...\n\nSignificant progress has been made during the last 10 years toward resolving the debate over the expansion rate of the Universe. The current value of the Hubble parameter, H0, is now arguably known with an accuracy of 10%, largely due to the tremendous increase in the number of galaxies in which Cepheid variable stars have been discovered. Increasingly accurate secondary distance indicators, many calibrated using Cepheids, now provide largely concordant measurements of H0 well out into the Hubble flow, and deviations from the smooth Hubble flow allow us to better measure the dynamical structure of the local Universe. The change in the Hubble parameter with redshift provided the first direct evidence for acceleration and “dark energy” in the Universe. Extragalactic distance measurements are central to determining the size, age, composition, and fate of the Universe. We discuss remaining systematic uncertainties, particularly related to the Cepheid calibration, and identify where impr..."
