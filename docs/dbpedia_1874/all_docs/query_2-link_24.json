        "text": "This course presents an introduction to the field of astronomy and astrophysics with an emphasis on the discoveries from space exploration. The first third of the course deals with understanding the history of astronomy, orbits, gravitation, optics, and the properties of light and matter. The rest of the course explores the properties, origin, and evolution of the major planets, asteroids, comets, the Sun, and other components of the Solar System with particular emphasis on comparative aspects with respect to the Earth. The origin and formation of the Solar System and the origin of life will also be discussed. This course is intended for non-science concentrators with a basic high school math and science background.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: A basic high school math and science background.\n\nNo credit for those who have completed or are enrolled in 115. (4 credits; NS, BS, QR/2*)\n\nDiscover the nature of stars, black holes, luminous nebulae, supernovae, galaxies, and other cosmic phenomena. In this concept-focused course you will learn what these objects are, how they formed, and what is ultimately in store for the universe. Explore the roles of light, energy, and gravity in astronomy.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: A basic high school math and science background.\n\nNo credit granted to those enrolled in or have completed ASTRO 104, ASTRO 142, or ASTRO 201.\n\nIn this course, we shall be “traveling” through space and time to “visit” firsthand some of the remarkable features of our Universe. Our “spacecraft” will be built from our imagination, but its destinations will reflect what astronomy and physics have revealed about the nature of our Universe. We will see the Solar System from different planets, look back at the Sun from neighboring stars, and travel throughout our home Galaxy even as we prepare to embark to distant galaxies and beyond. As we travel extremely far from home, we will find that we also have to move back in time to see how the galaxies, stars, the Sun, and the Earth came about in the first place. The physical concepts that we require to understand what we see will be introduced as we go along, and some of these will be used many times during the course. Online notes will be available during the course of the term, though students may use any number of standard modern Astronomy textbooks to supplement these notes and the class lectures. (3 credits; NS, BS, QR/2)\n\nNo credit granted to those enrolled in or have completed ASTRO 102, 142, or 201.\n\nThis mini-course discusses the on-going search for extra-terrestrial life.\n\nDoes ET exist?\n\nHas he/she/it visited Earth?\n\nDo we want to try to communicate and should we?\n\nIn this course, we will discuss the on-going search for extra-terrestrial life. We will place a strong focus on the scientific hurdles that lie in our understanding the development of life and for its potential evolution towards interstellar travel and communication. The framework of the course will be based upon the Drake Equation, first posed to estimate the total number of intelligent civilizations that might exist in the Galaxy at a given time. Thus we will take a census of the potential for life beyond Earth through an exploration of our own solar system. We will then survey beyond our own star system to the exciting search for “extra-solar” planets and their biological potential. We will end with a group activity where students and professors will try to estimate how many ET civilizations might exist and then move on to discuss our future potential to travel to the stars.\n\n(1 credit mini-course; No credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in Astro 115; NS, BS)\n\nThis course covers one of the most exciting areas of modern astronomy: understanding our own origins and the search for life elsewhere. First, we survey our understanding of life's origin on the Earth. Second, we apply this knowledge by exploring our own solar system and asking what planets or moons could potentially harbor life. Third, we move beyond our star system to outline the search for other planets in the Galaxy, speculate on the existence of life in the Universe, and consider the possibility of star travel sometime in the future.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: A basic high school math and science background.\n\nNo credit for those who have completed or are enrolled in ASTRO 101. (3 credits; NS, BS, QR/2)\n\nStudents learn about the nature of the most common astronomical objects that can be observed by eye, such as the Sun, Moon, planets, stars, comets, and meteors. The motion of these objects in the sky is studied along with their influence on the Earth.\n\nMeets two hours/week for half the semester.\n\nNo credit for those who have completed or are enrolled in 105. (1 credit mini-course; NS, BS)\n\nThis course will trace our progress in understanding the nature of the Universe from the early Greeks to today, with emphasis on our current understanding based on Einstein's relativity. The Big Bang Theory will be presented and origin of matter will be traced from the formation of atoms, to the formation of the first stars, to the build-up of galaxies such as the Milky Way. Dark energy and the ultimate fate of the universe will also be discussed in the context of the recent results from space satellites concerning the cosmic microwave background radiation that fills the universe and the large scale distribution of galaxies that form the cosmic web\n\nNo credit for those who have completed or are enrolled in Astro 102, 104, or 201; or Physics 112. (3 credits; NS, BS, QR/2)\n\nHow do science and science fiction help to shape our ideas about who we are, the function of our bodies, our relation to the nonhuman, our place to the universe, and our engagements with the environment? To what extent are works of science fiction anchored in real science, and what are the implications of their divergences from the scientifically possible? This course will give students the opportunity to explore these questions in an interdisciplinary context.\n\nSince its emergence, science fiction has encouraged us to imagine possible futures toward which technological innovation might lead. The genre, initially given shape by Romantic critiques of Enlightenment thinking, has helped us to explore the imaginative possibilities enabled by science and the ethical implications of new technologies. This course shares the attitudes of exploration and critique embodied by its double subject matter.\n\nIn this class, students will learn about the history of science fiction and will track historical trends and movements within the genre as they relate to the history of science and to concepts and problems in contemporary science. Students will also study how science fiction has brought into everyday language terms and tropes derived from the discourse of science—black holes and wormholes, warp speed and hyperspace, cloning and cryogenics, teleportation and terra-forming, cyborgs and androids, hive minds and the multiverse. The class gives students the opportunity to investigate the scientific roots and meanings of such concepts, while looking at the ways that these ideas are elucidated and challenged in science fiction, and considering how science fiction explores their ethical and practical implications.\n\n(3 Credits; ID)\n\nDiscover the extraordinary nature of astronomy, e.g. stars, black holes, galaxies, dark matter, and the universe. This course uncovers the astrophysics behind the most important and common astronomical phenomena in our universe. A major topic is stars and their lives, which can end violently through supernova explosions, leaving behind black holes or neutron stars. This is followed by the study of the Milky Way and its content, other galaxies, and how unseen \"dark\" matter shapes the universe we see today. We conclude with the origin of the universe and the limitations of looking back in time. Three lectures and two hours of laboratory work weekly; The course requires after-dark observing with telescopes on Angel Hall at least once during the semester, at a time TBD based on weather conditions. (4 credits; NS, BS, QR/1)\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: Calculus and Physics at the high school or university level are strongly recommended. Students should expect a level of math equivalent to MATH 115 (Calculus I).\n\nBlack holes are among the most fascinating concepts in Astronomy. A natural prediction of Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, they can be described as a gravitational singularity inducing infinite curvature into the fabric of space-time. Thus, the relation between time and space gets warped near these objects, generating some of the strangest phenomena in the universe. Although black holes do not emit light directly, their presence can be inferred via extreme effects on their environment. Paradoxically, black holes turn out to be the brightest sources of radiation across the entire universe. Even more surprisingly, black holes can convert infalling matter into bipolar jets that accelerate up to a substantial fraction of the speed of light. In turn, these jets can profoundly alter the properties of the black hole environment on large scales. Supermassive black holes are thought to play a crucial role regulating the evolution and overall properties of their host galaxies – akin to an object the size of a coin dictating the growth of a city the size of Detroit. This class addresses the most basic questions about the nature of black holes, their formation, observational appearance and ultimate fate.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: 3 credits of any Astronomy course, with the exception of ASTRO 183 and ASTRO 261.\n\nEnforced Prerequisites: Any one of: PHYSICS 135, 139, 140 or 160.\n\n(3 credits; NS, BS, QR/1)\n\nThis is a topics course that exposes students to new developments in Astronomy research. Each week, a different invited speaker (local or external) visits the class and gives a simplified, 15-minute talk about their research. The students will have time for questions and discussion with the visitor. There will be both preparatory and follow-up discussions before and after the visit so that students gain a complete understanding of the context, motivation, methodology, and scientific discoveries associated with each project presented. Theoretical uncertainties and experimental limits will also be discussed. In summary, students in this course will essentially participate in a real colloquium experience, but at a slower pace compared to the faculty experience. The Astronomy Department Colloquium series is traditionally on Thursday afternoon, and the classes must be scheduled to coincide on the same day as the Colloquium Series.\n\nEnforced Prerequisites: Any one of the following: PHYSICS 112, ASTRO 101, 102, 104, 105, 115, 142, or 201.\n\n(3 credits; NS, BS, QR/2)\n\nThis introductory course, suitable for majors and non-majors, fulfills the Natural Science requirement and offers hands-on, activity- and project-based application of scientific knowledge. The course is divided into three parts--Astronomy, Geology, and Climate Science. It covers the discovery of the place of Earth in the universe and its origin; discusses plate tectonics, volcanoes, and earthquakes; and addresses the major components of the climate system (atmosphere, oceans, and cryosphere).\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: High school mathematics and physics recommended.\n\n(3 Credits; BS, NS)\n\nNo credit granted to those who have completed or are enrolled in ASTRO 101 or 115, or EARTH 171(or GEOSCI 171) or AOSS 171 or BIOLOGY 110 or ENSCEN 171 or ENVIRON 110.\n\nThe purpose of this course is to educate students in all aspects of marine navigation, from getting a vessel underway from port through open ocean navigation using both celestial and electronic means. The content of the course is divided into three major areas. The first section focuses on piloting, emphasizing the safe navigation of vessels in coastal waters. This section provides an introduction to navigational instruments and aids to navigation. The second section concerns celestial navigation, the ability to determine position through observation of celestial bodies. Students learn how to determine position based on the use of the sextant and various almanacs and mathematical tables. The third section of the course considers electronic navigation.\n\n(3 credits; BS)\n\nFor students in astronomy who are prepared to undertake a limited research project under the guidance of a member of the staff of the Department of Astronomy. Open to qualified students in other departments subject to approval by concentration advisors and members of the staff of the Department of Astronomy.\n\nRequires instructor’s permission. May be repeated for credit. Continuing Course. Y grade can be reported at end of the first term to indicate work in progress. At the end of the second term, the final grade is posted for both terms. (1-3 credits)\n\nThis course examines the appearance, structure, and evolution of stars. We examine the basic physical processes that cause stars to have their observed structures; a study of the energy generation through nucleosynthesis; the basic physical laws that lead to the structure of stars; the transfer of radiation through the outer parts of the star; how spectroscopic information informs us as to the composition and motion of stars; and an in-depth look at the late stages of stellar evolution and stellar death.\n\nEnforced Prerequisites: MATH 215, 255 or 285, and prior or concurrent enrollment in PHYSICS 340 or PHYSICS 360, or graduate standing.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites: MATH 216, 256 or 286 and ASTRO 201.\n\n(3 credits; BS)\n\nComputational Astrophysics develops practical working knowledge of the numerical methods most widely used in current research. For each method we briefly discuss the underlying theory and then put it into practice by coding and using numerical routines for specific research applications. All coding is done in python, using interactive IPython notebooks. We first cover most common scientific methods, such as interpolation, integration, differentiation, and statistical description of data. We then study in depth data modeling and parameter fitting, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a particularly common task of linear regression, we compare these direct methods with Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We apply various machine learning methods to analyze and classify complex datasets. We also consider illustrative examples of solving systems of ordinary and partial differential equations. The course concludes with student projects, where these methods are used for real-life research applications.\n\nAdvisory Prerequisites:Prior or concurrent enrollment in MATH 216, 256 or 286, prior or concurrent enrollment in PHYSICS 235, 240 or 260, and some knowledge of programming.\n\n(3 credits; BS)"
