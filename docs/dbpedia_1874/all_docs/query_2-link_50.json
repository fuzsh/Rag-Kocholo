        "text": "The goals depend on where an IO psychologist works. The title may as well. Common descriptions include organizational development, talent management, human capital analytics, workforce analytics, people analytics, HR science, and human capital management.Earning a Master’s in Industrial Organizational Psychology prepares graduates for leadership positions as consultants and working directly for government and industry. With a doctorate, many can move into academia and research positions in government agencies. An IO psychologist’s work includes organizational development, compensation, training, data analysis, and generalist human resource management.“These are all different areas within I/O Psychology that, depending on the size of the company, can be one position, or many different ones with varying job titles that are usually not “I/O Psychology professional” or “I/O Psychologist,” which is why many people aren’t familiar at first,” said Gina Possin, Assistant Professor of Psychology and IO Psychology MS Program Director\n\nat Marian University.\n\nThe Difference Between Industrial and Organizational Psychology\n\nAccording to Richard Landers, an expert on applying psychological principles to the working world, industrial psychology once focused primarily on improving production in manufacturing and other manual labor – including the performance of battlefield soldiers.\n\nLanders writes that in those days, many of the experiments involving industrial psychology were essentially “trying to trick the worker into working harder.” But by the 1930s, some in the field started looking outside the narrow focus of predicting and improving performance and began to consider issues involving people’s feelings. These considerations included motivation, satisfaction, and how people get along with each other.\n\nThat area became known as organizational psychology. In the decades since, the two have merged to where there is little distinction. According to Landers, the main distinctions are as follows.\n\nIndustrial psychology tends to focus on hiring, training and development, assessing employee performance, and legal issues associated with those issues.\n\nOrganizational psychology tends to focus on motivation, teamwork, and leadership.\n\nEven so, both sides borrow from the other, creating no real distinction between the two in many settings.\n\nIO Psychology has now expanded just helping businesses, according to the American Psychological Association. They note that IO psychologists in the 21st-century work on projects such as the post-deployment needs of combat-wounded veterans, research into potential ways of improving the lives of poverty-level workers in Asia, and other ways of applying IO Psychology research, methods and practice “for the benefit of society at large.”\n\nCompetencies for IO Psychologists\n\nSuccess in IO psychology requires a combination of specific skills. They include expertise in psychology and its application to the workplace, of course. But they also include data analysis, critical thinking, research skills, psychometrics, and knowledge of test development and validation principles.\n\nMost states do not refer to professionals with a master’s degree in IO psychology as psychologists. Psychologists requires doctoral training and licensing. However, Wisconsin is not a state that requires licensing for I/O Psychology.\n\nThe Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP) notes that IO psychology is a “context-centered discipline.” They write: “This focus differentiates it from fields of psychology that study basic processes (e.g., perception, memory, learning), from fields that study particular populations of individuals (e.g., children, the mentally ill), and from fields that study mechanisms of behavior (e.g., physiological psychology, brain research).”\n\nA sample of the potential job titles in the field include:\n\nTalent Management Specialist\n\nOrganizational Development Specialist/Manager\n\nBehavior Analyst\n\nHuman Resource Research Specialist/Manager\n\nResearch Scientist\n\nTraining and Development\n\nPersonnel Psychologist\n\nPsychometrician\n\nProject Manager\n\nSelection & Assessment Specialist (Many times working in this role is called of Human Resource Specialist in regions that are unfamiliar with I/O Psychology)\n\nIO Psychology and the Modern Workplace\n\nPossin said that no matter the title, those who hold a master’s degree in IO psychology are sought after in the modern workplace.\n\n“The world of work is quickly changing over the past year, and we see I/O Psychology gaining interest,” Possin said. “Companies are finding employees are more productive working remotely, and in some cases, happier to do so. There is a growing need for more workforce analytics, more AI, and a greater understanding of organizational development needs and growth, including some difficult conversations.”\n\nEarning a master’s degree in IO Psychology provides graduates the skills they need to lead those conversations and apply what they learn to benefit workers and businesses. As the workplace becomes more complex, those skills are needed now more than ever."
