        "text": "Discussion\n\nGlobally, seabirds are among the most threatened groups of birds with 97 of 346 species (28%) listed as globally threatened, including 17 species classified as “Critically Endangered” (Croxall et al. Reference Croxall, Butchart, Lascelles, Stattersfield, Sullivan, Symes and Taylor2012). On their breeding grounds, the gravest threat to seabirds is the impact of introduced mammalian predators (Baker et al. 2002, Croxall et al. Reference Croxall, Butchart, Lascelles, Stattersfield, Sullivan, Symes and Taylor2012), with invasive rodents being among the most serious invasive species (Jones et al. Reference Jones, Tershy, Zavaleta, Croll, Keitt, Finkelstein and Howald2008). Our results from Gough Island present a worrying situation for almost all of the burrowing petrels studied here, with low values of burrow occupancy and breeding success recorded for Atlantic Petrel, Broad-billed Prion, Soft-plumaged Petrel and Grey Petrel. The ranges of breeding success recorded for Atlantic Petrel (20–23%; Cuthbert Reference Cuthbert2004, Wanless et al. Reference Wanless, Ratcliffe, Angel, Bowie, Cita, Hilton, Kritzinger, Ryan and Slabber2012), Soft-plumaged Petrels (14–44%), Broad-billed Prions (0–9%) and Grey Petrels (31–35%) from Gough Island are well below the breeding success of most petrels in areas free from introduced predators (Table 4). Only Great Shearwaters had levels of burrow occupancy and breeding parameters that can be considered normal for Puffinus species (Cuthbert and Davis Reference Cuthbert and Davis2002; Table 4).\n\nWe consider the predatory behaviour of house mice at Gough Island to be the most logical explanation for these low values of reproductive success. Mouse predation of chicks has been confirmed by direct observation for Atlantic Petrels, Great Shearwaters and Tristan Albatrosses on Gough Island (Wanless et al. Reference Wanless, Angel, Cuthbert, Hilton and Ryan2007) and patterns of injuries indicate predation also occurs on nestlings of Gough Buntings (Ryan and Cuthbert Reference Ryan and Cuthbert2008). Further records now suggest that mice also predate Atlantic Yellow-nosed and Sooty Albatross chicks (RSPB unpubl. data). Further direct evidence for predation was recorded for Broad-billed Prions in the current study, where both eggs and chicks of birds breeding in caves (where mice are abundant; Cuthbert et al. Reference Cuthbert, Visser, Louw, Rexer-Huber, Parker, Ryan, Veitch, Clout and Towns2011) were found with injuries consistent with mouse predation (Brown et al. Reference Brown, Moller, Innes and Jansen1998; Cuthbert and Hilton Reference Cuthbert and Hilton2004). While breeding success of many seabirds can be highly variable, often in response to at-sea conditions (Warham Reference Warham1990), we consider it very unlikely that environmental conditions would be responsible for consistently low breeding success and low burrow occupancy across four different species and over several years of monitoring. A further cause of low breeding success could be due to high rates of burrow competition, with larger species (such as Great Shearwaters) displacing smaller species on Gough, as has been observed for other seabirds (e.g. Ramos et al. Reference Ramos, Monteiro, Sola and Moniz1997, Was et al. Reference Was, Sullivan and Wilson2000). While such competition may occur on Gough the low levels of burrow occupancy seems likely to reduce the scale and impact of this upon breeding success. It is exceptional for house mice to be predators on the scale observed at Gough Island (Cuthbert and Hilton Reference Cuthbert and Hilton2004, Wanless et al. Reference Wanless, Angel, Cuthbert, Hilton and Ryan2007), and our study indicates that this source of mortality is impacting a wider range of species than previously considered.\n\nGiven the low values of breeding success observed in four species of petrels at Gough Island, are their populations likely to be stable or declining? Petrels are able to withstand several years of poor breeding success as they are long-lived, and even with consistently low breeding success, population declines are likely to be slow (e.g. Brooke et al. Reference Brooke, O’Connell, Wingate, Madeiros, Hilton and Ratcliffe2010). Population modelling undertaken for the Henderson Petrel Pterodroma atrata suggests that with values of annual adult survival set at 93%, breeding success needs to average more than 25% in order for the population to be close to stable (Brooke et al. Reference Brooke, O’Connell, Wingate, Madeiros, Hilton and Ratcliffe2010). Values of breeding success for both Pterodroma species on Gough are close to this level, suggesting that despite poor breeding success populations could be close to stable provided adult survival is sufficiently high. Published information for Grey Petrels is limited, but values of breeding success from Kerguelen of 40–60% (Inchausti et al. Reference Inchausti, Guinet, Koudil, Durbec, Barbraud, Weimerskirch, Cherel and Jouventin2003) and Macquarie Island 75–80% (Schulz et al. Reference Schulz, Robinson and Gales2005) indicate that in comparison breeding success for this species on Gough Island is low (Table 4). As well as suffering low breeding success on Gough Island, Grey Petrels are also often killed by commercial fishing operations (Barbraud et al. Reference Barbraud, Delord, Marteau and Weimerskirch2009) and in combination these two sources of mortality could be leading to population declines. Population modelling predicts a similar scenario for the Tristan Albatross, which like the Grey Petrel is impacted at sea and on land (Wanless et al. Reference Wanless, Ryan, Altwegg, Angel, Cooper, Cuthbert and Hilton2009). No demographic data are available for Broad-billed Prions, but with a breeding success of just 0–9% the species is almost certainly declining.\n\nAt least 12 species of burrowing petrel breed at Gough Island (Table 5) and our results demonstrate that breeding success was low in four out of five species studied. Angel and Cooper (Reference Angel and Cooper2006) hypothesised that winter-breeding species and smaller species (diving petrels and storm petrels) are likely to be most impacted by mouse predation on Gough Island, and other studies have reported that invasive rats have a greater impact on smaller seabird species (Baker et al. 2002, Jones et al. Reference Jones, Tershy, Zavaleta, Croll, Keitt, Finkelstein and Howald2008). These hypotheses are supported by our data which indicate a significant relationship between body size and breeding success as well as lower values of breeding success for the two winter breeding species (Figure 1). If this relationship holds for all species of burrowing petrel on Gough Island then we predict that the impact of house mice on the remaining species is likely to be severe, as they are either winter breeders (Great-winged Petrel) or of small body size (< 350 g; Table 5 and Figure 1). Given these results we predict that wide-scale population declines are occurring among most burrowing petrels on Gough Island. The very low rates of burrow occupancy found for Broad-billed Prions (4–12%) and Soft-plumaged Petrels (11–18%) suggest that large-scale population declines may already have taken place for these two species, although some caution should be attached to these occupancy figures as it is difficult to separate burrows of the two species and large numbers of prions breed in caves on the island. If burrow occupancy values found in this study are applied to the population estimates in Cuthbert (Reference Cuthbert2004) then populations of both Broad-billed Prions and Soft-plumaged Petrels could be far lower than previously estimated.\n\nEarlier reports and observations of burrowing petrels at Gough Island lend some further credence to the fact that populations of many species have declined. The first detailed ornithological survey of Gough Island in 1955/56 (Swales Reference Swales1965) described Little Shearwaters Puffinus assimilis as “extremely abundant”, recorded that Kerguelen Petrels Lugensa brevirostris were so abundant that “so many thousands... were attracted to the lights... that it became necessary to turn them off again at once for the safety of the observers, the birds and the lights themselves”, reported “large numbers” of Great-winged Petrels and described Common Diving Petrels as “abundant”. Similarly, Ryan (Reference Ryan2010) estimates on a single misty night in October 1984 that there were “tens of thousands of Broad-billed Prions, thousands of Soft-plumaged and Kerguelen Petrels, and hundreds of Atlantic Petrels, Little Shearwaters, Common Diving-petrels and White-faced and Grey-backed storm-petrels”. By contrast numbers of birds seen spot-lighting at the same location over many nights in September–October 2009, recorded no Kerguelen Petrels, one Little Shearwater and two Grey-backed Storm Petrels. Ryan (Reference Ryan2010) also reports that Little Shearwaters used to be commonly heard calling in tussock areas in the southeast of the island during the mid 1980s but are now no longer recorded. While there are obviously limitations to these conclusions based on a single night’s observations from the mid- 1980s, nonetheless it is striking that no similar observations of numbers on this scale have been recorded during the last decade, when year-round teams of fieldworkers have been present for five years since 2000/01. Despite specific searches, they have failed to locate any breeding burrows of Great-winged Petrels, Little Shearwaters, Common Diving Petrel or storm petrels, and have only found a few Kerguelen Petrel burrows. Some caution should be applied to comparing the surveys from 1955/56 with results from the last decade, as the earlier surveys were undertaken on the east coast at The Glen, whereas most recent fieldwork has been undertaken in upland areas of the island and at Transvaal Bay. Nonetheless, despite some evidence from birds attracted to the lights of fishing boats anchored offshore from The Glen that this site may hold greater numbers of Little Shearwaters and Kerguelen Petrels than other areas (PGR and ES pers obs.) it is clear from overnight visits to the site that there are considerably fewer birds present than described by Swales (Reference Swales1965). While these comparisons from The Glen are qualitative, the observations of Ryan (Reference Ryan2010) from 1984 and 2009 were undertaken at the same site and provide stronger evidence for large-scale declines.\n\nHouse mice have been present on Gough Island since the early 19th century (Rowe-Rowe and Crafford Reference Rowe-Rowe and Crafford1992) and given that numbers of burrowing petrels appeared to remain abundant on Gough Island until at least the 1960s, the question arises as to why large scale impacts of mice and apparent reductions in petrel numbers have only been observed in the last few decades? The negative impacts of rats on seabird populations are usually acute and relatively rapid (Atkinson Reference Atkinson and Moors1985), although in some circumstances gradual population declines can take place over hundreds of years (Brooke et al. Reference Brooke, O’Connell, Wingate, Madeiros, Hilton and Ratcliffe2010). Comparable knowledge on the impacts of House mice on seabirds is lacking, because large-scale predatory behaviour by the species appears to be the exception rather than the rule. Given the impacts that mice are now having on Gough Island and the presence of very large numbers of birds until the mid 20th century we consider it likely that, for currently unknown reasons, the predatory behaviour of mice has increased in recent decades to the point whereby the impact of predation is now observed across most species on the island."
