The light from the Sun prevents the stars from appearing during the day, so you will need specialised equipment to study them. There are 88 constellations, of which 14 can be found in the southern hemisphere.\n\nScreen is too small to see picture, please view on a screen that is at least 380 pixels wide.\n\nSextans Facts\n\nSextans is a Latin word; the English meaning/translation is the sextants.\n\nSextans's pronunciation is Sex-tans.\n\nThe genitive form is Sextantis, which means any object with Sextantis at the end of its name infers a relationship to the constellation. Typically, the thing is within the constellation's boundaries or was once until it (the borders) was redrawn.\n\nSextans can be shortened or abbreviated to Sex. Sextans is a modern constellation rather than one created by Claudius Ptolemy, such as Aquarius, Leo and Taurus.\n\nSextans (Constellation) takes up 313.515 sq. degrees of the night sky, equating to 0.76% of the night sky. Sextans is the 47th largest constellation in the night sky.\n\nSeven Extrasolar Planets in the Sextans constellation are detailed on this site. There is a dedicated page for exoplanets in Sextans.\n\nCharles Messier didn't catalogue any deep-space objects in the Sextans constellation.\n\nThe following constellations border Sextans:-\n\nLeo\n\nHydra\n\nCrater\n\nSextans Stars\n\nHere are a few facts about the stars in the constellation.\n\nSextans has three stars that make up the constellation's shape.\n\nThe Hipparcos satellite scanned and detailed six hundred and thirty-eight stars.\n\nYou can see forty-five stars within the Sextans constellation borders with the naked eye on a clear night sky.\n\nRoss 446 is Sextans's nearest star, about 23.05 light-years from the Earth.\n\nThe nearest star in Sextans to the Earth with an exoplanet is HD 92788, about 115.66 light-years away.\n\nAlpha Sextantis\n\nSextans's brightest star is Alpha Sextantis, about 283.37 light-years from the Sun. The star is recognised as the brightest in the constellation as it has the Bayer status of Alpha. Alpha Sextantis has an apparent magnitude of 4.48 but an absolute magnitude of -0.21. The difference between the magnitudes is that absolute magnitude is the object from 10 Parsecs or 32.6 light-years away from the observer, whereas apparent is from Earth.\n\nSextans Mythology\n\nCreated by Johannes Hevelius in around 1687 and recognised by the International Astronomical Union. It was created to fill a void in the maps."
