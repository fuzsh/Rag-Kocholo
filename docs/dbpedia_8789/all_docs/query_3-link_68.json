Children and youth reside at these centers as per their age, gender and what they do. At these centers they undergo definite rehabilitation programs in their journey towards social reintegration.\n\nIt is heartening to note that BOSCO with its motto, ‘that they may have life … in all its fullness’ has reached out to the deprived, marginalized and vulnerable children/youth and made efforts to make their life better.I hope that with many more such endeavors, BOSCO protects the interest of such children and brings light in their life.\n\nBOSCO, Bengaluru has been transforming Bengaluru into a society that takes care of its children, empowers them, ensures that they are given access to education, and prevents them from all the social evils by closely working various Government Departments and Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR).May BOSCO continue to be a healthy presence to the young, as they form a very important part of the society! Best of Luck!\n\nBOSCO is a well know NGO in Karnataka, especially in Bangalore city, working for the rehabilitation of children on the streets, runaway children, child labourers, trafficked children and other vulnerable children. It is working in close collaboration with Government in taking care of the children in need of care and protection. I extend my best wishes to all their endeavours.\n\nBOSCO is doing favour for children who are at risk by rescuing and nurturing them into a responsible individual/citizen from the past 40 years. Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, BMTC is also been associated with BOSCO from many years at Kempegowda Bus Station, KBS, Bengaluru. On behalf of BMTC and Government of Karnataka, I extend my support to the Organization and wish them a good success in the years ahead."
