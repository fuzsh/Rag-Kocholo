A permit is required. If the incident happened after business hours, then a permit must be obtained the next business day. Gas inspections will generally occur during normal business hours except when necessary for heat when extreme cold temperatures are expected. For a planned outage, work should be coordinated with the inspector to minimize outage duration.\n\nEmergency Inspection Contact\n\nSelect option 1 to be directed to the answering service who will contact the inspector on call."
