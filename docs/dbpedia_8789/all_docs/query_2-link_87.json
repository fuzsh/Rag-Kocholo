We have always had a coast, whether it be Atlantico or Caribbean, a theme that brings us to the present day with the recent constitutional reform of 2014, in which the legislators incorporate the decision of the International Court of Justice which as it pertains to us the Caribbean Sea is restored to Nicaragua by the aforesaid decision, and in the political constitution of Nicaragua. Law No. 854, amendment to the political constitution of the Republic of Nicaragua. published in the official daily gazette, number 26, 2014-02-12: Every reference to \"Costa Atlántica\" in the onstitution or in legislation, should read \"Costa Caribe.\"\n\nNicaragua abandoned DST after a two-year trial in 2005-06.\n\nSorin Cosoveanu pointed out to me the results of the 2005 census.\n\n\"Administrative Subdivisions of Countries\" shows Nicaragua divided into sixteen departments. As a sidelight, it mentions that there is an alternative division into six regions and three special zones. Each of the regions and special zones consists of one or more departments, except that Zelaya department is split into two special zones: Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte, and Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur. The FIPS and ISO standards have now begun to treat these special zones as department-level divisions.\n\nErratum: Population data in the book are 1990 estimates, not a 1991 census.\n\nISO 3166-2 Newsletter Number I-2 was published on 2002-05-21. For Nicaragua, it replaces Zelaya department with two autonomous regions named Atlántico Norte and Atlántico Sur.\n\nCountry overview:\n\nShort nameNICARAGUA ISO codeNI FIPS codeNU LanguageSpanish (es) Time zone-6 CapitalManagua\n\nNicaragua has been independent for the whole 20th century.\n\nOther names of country:\n\nDanish: Nicaragua\n\nDutch: Nicaragua, Republiek Nicaragua (formal)\n\nEnglish: Republic of Nicaragua (formal)\n\nFinnish: Nicaragua\n\nFrench: Nicaragua m\n\nGerman: Nicaragua n\n\nIcelandic: Nikaragúa\n\nItalian: Nicaragua m\n\nNorwegian: Nicaragua, Republikken Nicaragua (formal)\n\nPortuguese: Nicarágua, República f da Nicarágua f (formal)\n\nRussian: Республика Никарагуа (formal)\n\nSpanish: Nicaragua, República f de Nicaragua f (formal)\n\nSwedish: Nicaragua\n\nTurkish: Nikaragua Cumhuriyeti (formal)\n\nOrigin of name:\n\nNamed for Nicarao, chief of the tribe of Nicaraos\n\nPrimary subdivisions:\n\nNicaragua is divided into fifteen departamentos (departments) and two regiones autónomas (sing. región autónoma: autonomous regions).\n\nDepartmentHASCFIPSPopulationArea(km.²)Area(mi.²)ZoneCapital BoacoNI.BONU01150,6364,1771,613CBoaco CarazoNI.CANU02166,0731,081418PJinotepe ChinandegaNI.CINU03378,9704,8221,862PChinandega ChontalesNI.CONU04153,9326,4812,502CJuigalpa EstelíNI.ESNU05201,5482,230861CEstelí GranadaNI.GRNU06168,1861,040401PGranada JinotegaNI.JINU07331,3359,2223,561CJinotega LeónNI.LENU08355,7795,1381,984PLeón MadrizNI.MDNU09132,4591,708660CSomoto ManaguaNI.MNNU101,262,9783,4651,338PManagua MasayaNI.MSNU11289,988611236PMasaya MatagalpaNI.MTNU12469,1726,8042,627CMatagalpa Nueva SegoviaNI.NSNU13208,5233,4911,348COcotal Región Autónoma del Caribe NorteNI.ANNU17314,13032,82012,672ABilwi Región Autónoma del Caribe SurNI.ASNU18306,51027,54610,636ABluefields Río San JuanNI.SJNU1495,5967,5402,911ASan Carlos RivasNI.RINU15156,2832,162835PRivas 17 divisions5,142,098130,37350,337\n\nDepartment: except RACN and RACS, which are autonomous regions.\n\nHASC: Hierarchical administrative subdivision codes.

I'm not sure how that works out when there are seventeen departments. The postal service site doesn't have any facility for looking up specific postal codes yet.\n\nFurther subdivisions:\n\nSee the Municipalities of Nicaragua page.\n\nThe departments are subdivided into municipios (municipalities). Since 1982-07-26, there has also been a subdivision into six regions and three special zones. However, the departments are still the divisions most often referenced. The regions are:\n\nNameCapitalDepartments Región IEstelíEstelí, Madriz, Nueva Segovia Región IILeónChinandega, León Región IIIManaguaManagua Región IVJinotepeCarazo, Granada, Masaya, Rivas Región VJuigalpaBoaco, Chontales Región VIMatagalpaJinotega, Matagalpa Región Autónoma del Caribe NorteRositaZelaya (part) Región Autónoma del Caribe SurBluefieldsZelaya (part) Zona Especial IIISan CarlosRío San Juan\n\nThe parts of Zelaya are also known by their acronyms, RAAN and RAAS; or as Zelaya Norte and Zelaya Sul. In the latest FIPS list, they have separate codes of NU17 and NU18, respectively, superseding Zelaya.\n\nTerritorial extent:\n\nGranada includes Zapatera Island in Lake Nicaragua.\n\nRío San Juan includes the Solentiname Archipelago in Lake Nicaragua.\n\nRivas includes Ometepe Island in Lake Nicaragua.\n\nZelaya includes Nicaragua's Caribbean islands: the Corn Islands (Isla Grande del Maíz and Isla Pequeña del Maíz), the Cayos Miskitos, and some islets.\n\nThe UN LOCODE page for Nicaragua lists locations in the country, some of them with their latitudes and longitudes, some with their ISO 3166-2 codes for their subdivisions. This information can be put together to approximate the territorial extent of subdivisions.\n\nOrigins of names:\n\nGranada, León, and Segovia were named for cities in Spain.\n\nGracias a Dios: Spanish for thanks to God, name bestowed on the cape by Columbus in 1502 after finding refuge from a storm in its lee\n\nManagua: possibly from ethnic name\n\nNueva Segovia: Spanish nueva: new, named when the department was split from Segovia\n\nZelaya: after general and president José Santos Zelaya\n\nChange history:\n\n1900: Nicaragua consisted of the departments of Chinandega, Chontales, Granada, Leon, Managua, Masaya, Matagalpa, Segovia, Rivas, and Zelaya (also known as Mosquito Reservation).\n\n~1902: Districts of Cabo Gracias a Dios, Prinzapolka, Rio Grande, and Siquia formed from the eastern parts of Chontales, Matagalpa, and Segovia; Estelí and Jinotega also split from Segovia; Carazo split from Granada.\n\n~1915: District of San Juan del Norte split from Chontales.\n\n~1938: Status of Cabo Gracias a Dios changed from district to comarca; Boaco split from Chontales; Segovia split into Madriz and Nueva Segovia; Zelaya merged with the four districts.\n\n~1957: Río San Juan formed from parts of Chontales and Zelaya.\n\n~1977: Cabo Gracias a Dios merged with Zelaya.\n\n1982-07-26: Six regions and three special zones formed as a higher-level subdivision of Nicaragua.\n\n~1988-01-01: Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte and Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur established.\n\n~1994: Name of capital of Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte changed from Puerto Cabezas to Bilwi. The municipio is still named Puerto Cabezas, and the capital is frequently called by its old name.\n\n~1998: Región Autónoma del Atlántico Norte and Región Autónoma del Atlántico Sur considered to be on the same level with the departments. Before this time, they were together known as Zelaya department (HASC NI.ZE, FIPS NU16, capital Bluefields).\n\n2005-02-01: A small part of R.A.A.S. transferred to R.A.A.N. in order to form Mulukukú municipio.\n\n2014-02-10: Names of the autonomous regions changed, replacing Atlántico with Caribe.\n\nPopulation history:\n\nDepartment19401950-05-311963-04-251971-04-201995-04-252005-05-28 Boaco40,32050,03972,00069,355136,949150,636 Cabo Gracias a Dios17,323 Carazo58,38152,13866,00071,494149,407166,073 Chinandega78,52981,836129,000154,726350,212378,970 Chontales61,02750,52976,00069,059144,635153,932 Estelí51,95443,74269,00079,400174,894201,548 Granada51,56148,73266,00071,579155,683168,186 Jinotega48,49448,55477,00092,567257,933331,335 León89,631123,614150,000167,519336,894355,779 Madriz34,62333,17850,00054,020107,567132,459 Managua133,745161,513319,000504,1261,093,7601,262,978 Masaya69,10772,44677,00093,890241,354289,988 Matagalpa116,766135,401171,000173,758383,776469,172 Nueva Segovia27,85627,07846,00065,719148,492208,523 Zelaya/R.A.A.N.69,91156,49789,000149,016192,716314,130 R.A.A.S.272,252306,510 Río San Juan9,08916,00021,15970,14395,596 Rivas51,25545,31464,00074,156140,432156,283 Total983,1601,057,0231,537,0001,911,5434,357,0995,142,098\n\nNotes: In 1940, population of Zelaya includes Cabo Gracias a Dios and San Juan del Norte. 1963 data rounded to nearest 1,000.\n\nSources:"
