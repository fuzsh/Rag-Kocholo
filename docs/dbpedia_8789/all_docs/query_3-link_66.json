        "text": "Making a difference in the lives of families\n\nToo often, parents and caregivers don’t get a say in the laws and policies that directly affect their families. The Parent Cabinet is helping to change that. We’ve turned to the experts — parents and caregivers across the state.\n\nThe Parent Cabinet gives parents a chance to work directly with OEC — and to report back about the concerns and experiences of other parents.\n\nHow we created the Parent Cabinet\n\n2019: OEC creates a Design Committee — made up of 10 parents from across the state — to develop the concept of a Parent Cabinet\n\n2019-2021: Design Committee meets regularly with OEC staff members to determine the Cabinet’s mission, structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities\n\n2021: Parent Cabinet established and first members chosen.\n\nModels and strategies\n\nThe Design Committee researched and based their work on various models and approaches. These include:\n\nCT’s 2Gen Initiative\n\nCT’s Framework and Definition of Family Engagement\n\nHead Start Family and Community Engagement\n\nManifesto for Race Equity & Parent Leadership in Early Childhood Systems\n\nParent Leadership Training Institute\n\nMembers of the Parent Cabinet Design Committee\n\nCaroline Austin\n\nCaroline is a writer, an actress, and a mother of 3.

She, along with other key parents has been a contributor to the planning and implementation of the Two-Gen Initiative since 2015 and is a co-creator of the Two-Gen Parent Academy. She also co-created the Manifesto for Race Equity & Parent Leadership in Early Childhood Systems for the Center for the Study of Social Policy (CSSP) and their Parent Leadership Network as-well-as co-created the National Early Childhood Family Network and their Parent Leadership Network supported by FREDLA.

She has learned to pivot in more recent times with the onset of COVID planning and presenting in the virtual space with conferences such as CSSP’s First Virtual Leadership Summit. Whether the topic is health or education, whether it’s in the workplace or outside of it, this innovative facilitator and thought leader boldly and unapologetically creates spaces to have the tough conversations with organizations, families, and the local community. The foundation of Caroline’s work is her dedication to true and authentic collaborations with parents and families. Instead of taking the traditional, outdated approach of designing for communities and families, she designs with them — gently leading them through a process of co-creation and co-design.\n\nJoyce Bosco\n\nJoyce is the Catholic Charities’ Family and Community Engagement Specialist.
