Overview

Boaco is the capital city of Boaco Department. Information about the city at Wikipedia.

The flag of Boaco is probably inspired by the flag of Antigua. Image and photo of the flag are at www.manfut.org. Same flag also appear at www.alcaldiaboaco.gob.ni with this information (translated from Spanish): "Yellow is for the religion. Green is for the mountains. Blue is for the sky and white is for purity.

The municipality of Boaco (62,448 inhabitants in 2020, 25,817 in the town of Boaco; 108,700 ha) is located 100 km north-east of Managua; Located in a mountainous area, Boaco is nicknamed "the Two-Storey City".

This is what the municipal website says, but the other website, www.manfut.org, says something slightly different: "Yellow stands for the relationships between the [Roman] Catholic Church and the Town of Boaco. Blue and white are the colours of the national flag of Nicaragua. Green represents the aspiration to be an ecological municipality."

The flag is made of two rectangle isosceles green triangles forming a V filled with three horizontal stripes, yellow, blue and white (2:1:2).

In this photo it doesn't seem that the central stripe is narrower. The flag exists in both designs.
