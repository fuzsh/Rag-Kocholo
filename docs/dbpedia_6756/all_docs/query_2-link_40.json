        "text": "Ralisa Dawkins is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Science, Technology, and Society (STS). The skills and experience acquired throughout her academic life shaped her research interests. Such interest surrounds exploring:\n\nthe relationship between persons living with a Disability and Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems, devices, and tools.\n\nhow situating people with disabilities within the field of AI from a point of influence and expertise may shape the relationship between technology and society.\n\ncapturing the controversies surrounding AI systems and people with disabilities in the context of the global north and south divide.\n\nThe different academic skills, professional and first-hand experiences obtained over the years forms the basis for the need to often explain the significance of disability inclusion in the creation of a fair and just society.\n\nLyndon is a 3rd year Ph.D. student. His research lands in the intersection of trans studies, medical studies, and economics. However, do not ask him to do any economic forecasting (number crunching) for gender affirmative medicine because he does not do that kind of work. Prior to coming to VT, he did his undergraduate and master's in STS and Integrated Social Sciences, respectively, at Arizona State University (yes, I am far from home). In his spare time, he likes to go on hikes and runs with his dog Scout, goes rock climbing (it's a new hobby), plays D&D, and spends time with friends (new slots are always open).\n\nTheo is a first-year PhD student in the Science, Technology, and Society department as well as an author. Theo did his undergraduate work in Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies, Russian and Eurasian Studies, and German at Colgate University. He just released his first poetry book, Ele-Mental through Spinning Monkey Press. In his spare time, he likes to go on walks with his dog Bex, read, write, and spend time with friends.\n\nI’m Jack R Leff (he/him), my dissertation is on the spatial and epistemic biopolitics of tear gas. I have a background in continental philosophy and applied ethics (M.S.) and cellular/molecular biology (B.S.), which form the backdrop for my interdisciplinary work. I’m an active political organizer interested in prison abolition and carceral technologies. Please feel free to shoot me an email (leffjr@vt.edu) to get in touch, I am always excited to meet other people interested in social movement engaged scholarship.\n\nTaylor Loy brings a diverse academic/professional background to the problems of nonproliferation. He is a PhD candidate in the Department of Science, Technology, & Society (STS) at Virginia Tech. His dissertation research focuses on tritium, a unique and ephemeral radioactive isotope that readily transgresses established boundaries between civilian/military and natural/technological domains. He has presented tritium-related research at the Society for History of Technology (SHOT) Annual Conference (co-authored with Sonja Schmid) and The Future of Disarmament Workshop (University of Glasgow). After competitive application processes, he has also attended two prominent workshops: the Public Policy and Nuclear Threats (PPNT) Bootcamp 2022 and the New Era Workshop (NEW) 2023 with Bridging the Gap. Most recently, he published a policy brief as part of the Nuclear Futures Working Group with New America, “Speculating on Tritium Futures: Why Defense Material Should Fuel Fusion Innovation,” which considers opportunities for harmonizing global decarbonization and nonproliferation goals along the material axis of tritium.\n\nBefore returning to graduate school to pursue a PhD, he worked in the nuclear power industry for over six years in operations and training. During that time, he started out as an assistant unit operator trainee and progressed to a senior reactor operator certified instructor for initial license training. Taylor holds graduate degrees (MA/MS) in English and STS from Virginia Tech. In 2021, he completed a cross-disciplinary graduate certificate in Nuclear Science, Technology, and Policy (NSTP).\n\nCAPT Jamie McGrath, USN(ret), retired from the US Navy after 29 years as a nuclear-trained surface warfare officer. He is now the Director of the Major General W. Thomas Rice Center for Leader Development at Virginia Tech, an adjunct professor for the US Naval War College, and a first year PhD student in STS. Passionate about using history to inform today, his area of focus is US naval history, 1919 to 1945, with emphasis on the inter-war period, and he is currently exploring the impact of technology on naval fleet design and construction. He holds a Bachelor's in History from Virginia Tech, a Master's in National Security and Strategic Studies from the US Naval War College, and a Master's in Military History from Norwich University.\n\nMichael J. Meindl is a PhD candidate with a focus on the intersection of animation/screen media and the history of technology. His dissertation work centers on Disney's multiplane camera. He has an MFA in Dramatic Media and a MA and BA in Theatre Studies. He is an Associate Professor of Media Production at Radford University, where he also acts as Director of the Cinema and Screen Studies Program. He has worked on a number of non-fiction media projects, has published essays and articles in a variety of sources, and has presented at regional, national, and international conferences. He serves on the governing board for the Society for Animation Studies, where he also acts as the chair for the Science, Technology, and Animation special interest group.\n\nMy name is Morgan Moore and I am a first-year PhD student in the Science, Technology, and Society department here at Virginia Tech. I am a career Hokie thus far, having graduated with a BS in Microbiology in Spring 2023. During my undergraduate degree, I developed a passion for studying matters at the intersection of biology and sociology through my (STS) Medicine and Society minor. I plan to continue along this trajectory in our program by focusing on social determinants of health.\n\nAriyan is a Ph.D. student in the field of Science and Technology Studies (STS). Holding master's degrees in Computer Science from Stockholm University and IT Engineering with a concentration in E-commerce, Ariyan's academic journey began with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction before transitioning to the STS community. Currently, his research interests encompass a broad spectrum, including AI Ethics and its societal implications, Governing Innovation and Advanced Technology, Human Life Technology, and epistemic practices in computer simulation. Ariyan's scholarly pursuits also extend to various subjects within STS, ranging from Epistemology to the History of Technology and Innovations. With a passion for interdisciplinary exploration, Ariyan is interested to advancing knowledge and understanding in the intersection of technology and society.\n\nLois Nguyen is a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Science, Technology, and Society. Her research focuses on multispecies ethics, nature-based solutions and technologies, and theories of displacement. She is interested in ecofeminist approaches to thinking ecologically about spatial and technical arrangements.
