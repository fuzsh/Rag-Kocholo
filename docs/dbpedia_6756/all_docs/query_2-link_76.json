        "text": "Barbara Jean Montgomery, 66, of Black Eagle passed away on October 5, 2021. Four years ago, a stroke took away her “spark of life.” COVID took away anything that was left.\n\nBarb was born in Minot, ND on October 10, 1954, to Wesley and Erma Munson. Shortly after that, they moved to Billings, MT. One of Barb’s biggest dreams was to own a horse, which her parents said she could have if they ever lived out in the country. Much to their surprise, her dad eventually found a job as a country school janitor. This meant that Barb could now have her horse. She spoke fondly of having the horse neck deep in the ditch and jumping off his back to go swimming. Barb became the first in her family to graduate from high school when she graduated from West High School in 1972.\n\nAfter graduation, she married Steven Harren but divorced shortly after that. Barb tried to work as a waitress but ended up pouring a pitcher of beer onto someone who got a little too loud and a little too friendly. She agreed with her boss that she needed a different profession. She determined that it should be a sitting down job, so she became a secretary and worked for Weissman’s in Billings and then the City of Billings at the water department.\n\nShe met David Montgomery and gave birth to her daughter, Nicole. She moved with Dave to Bozeman and attended Montana State University for a couple years and the couple married. School was not her thing, and she went to work for Weissman’s again in Bozeman. At the time, she drove a blue Volkswagen Beetle she named “George” to work. One day the temperature was about 20 below and everyone’s expensive vehicles would not start, but “George” did. The shotgun rider was in charge of scraping the window on the inside since that air-cooled engine could not keep up with four people breathing in that bitter cold.\n\nAfter Dave graduated MSU, the family moved to Great Falls and Barb gave birth to Karom David. Karom’s kidneys were destroyed soon after birth so that meant Barb and Dave did around the clock dialysis at home to keep him alive. He was a happy boy with a great smile. Unfortunately, SIDS came to call, and he died the day after Thanksgiving. A year later, Danielle was born. In Great Falls, Barb worked for a group of accountants and was then hired as a secretary and insurance adjuster for Crawford and Company. She ended her career as an Administrative Assistant at the Great Falls Community Food Bank. She truly enjoyed working for George Paul and Gayle Carlson. While working there, she was excited to welcome her grandchildren, Emily and Jacen. She was planning to work a few more years, but one day she came to work and could not remember how to do things even though she had worked there for 10 years. The stroke had happened, and she retreated to her home.\n\nShe loved reading romance novels. In fact, she would head to work an hour or more early so she could sit in the parking lot and read before work. Sadly, her stroke caused such memory problems that reading became impossible for her.\n\nSummer was her favorite season, and her back yard was always full of colorful geraniums, petunias and one cherry tomato plant for Dave. Her Basset Hound, Frank, was her constant companion the last few years. She also enjoyed collecting goose and duck themed figurines, cookie jars, and other items to decorate the house. She asked that her remains be placed in her goose cookie jar and be interred at Hillcrest Mausoleum. Those wishes will be honored.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents; her brother, Milton (Darlene) Munson; and son, Karom.\n\nShe is survived by her husband; daughters, Nicole (Ben) Jetland and Dani (MaryAnn) Montgomery; and grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at Hillcrest Lawn Memorial Chapel on Friday, October 15, 2021, at 2:00 p.m.\n\nCondolences for the family may be shared online at www.SchniderFuneralHome.com\n\nFuneral Services for Brandon Stevenson, 37, of Colorado Springs, CO will be 10:00 am, Friday, December 17, 2021 at the Stevenson Funeral Home in Dickinson with Pastor Scott Skones officiating. A Second Funeral will be held at 1:00 pm, Tuesday, December 21, 2021 at the Woodmen Valley Chapel at the Rockrimmon Campus in Colorado Springs, CO with Pastor Matt Ferrell officiating. Burial will be held in Colorado Springs. Full Military Honors will be presented by the Dickinson Drill Team and the Army’s 10th Special Forces Group.\n\nBrandon Dale Stevenson was born February 28, 1984 in Miles City, MT to Jonathan and Marlys (Kolka) Stevenson where he joined brother, Nicolas. Due to a sudden and brief illness, Brandon passed away December 12, 2021 at St. Francis Medical Center in Colorado Springs, CO. Brandon was raised and spent most of his childhood and adolescence in Baker, MT before moving to Dickinson, ND in 2001. Brandon graduated from Trinity High School in 2003 where he excelled in football, wrestling, and track.\n\nFollowing high school, Brandon was nominated to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Brandon graduated in 2007 with a Bachelor’s degree in History and commissioned as an Army Infantry officer. During Brandon’s ten years in the Army, he earned many distinguished awards including the Army Ranger and Special Forces Tabs, as well as Combat Infantryman, Combat Action, Air Assault, and Airborne badges. Brandon entered the United States Army Special Forces in 2012 and earned the coveted and distinguished Green Beret. Brandon faithfully served the nation with seven deployments that took him all over the world to include three tours to Iraq, Libya, Jordan, Germany and Niger where he was awarded two Bronze Stars for his valor in combat. Perhaps Brandon’s greatest military accomplishment was the deep and life-long friendships he built with his Army brethren.\n\nBrandon married his best friend, Wendy Junelle Jorde in Dickinson, ND, May 26, 2012. Brandon and Wendy lived in four states and settled in Colorado Springs, CO after Brandon was stationed at Fort Carson with the Army’s 10th Special Forces Group. Brandon and Wendy have two beautiful children, Adler 3 and Hadley 16 months. Brandon wholeheartedly enjoyed being a dad to Adler and Hadley and being a dad brought immense joy. Brandon was the best at being the bedtime story narrator, lyric creator, song singer, fire camp starter, tickle monster and so, so much more. Adler’s and Hadley’s first word was dada’ which is evident by Brandon’s sweet-sweet love, commitment, humor, and happiness that he shared with the kids and the love they felt for their dada. Although so young, we know that Brandon’s attention, love, and connection will carry Adler and Hadley through life with his insurmountable love.\n\nBrandon separated from the United States Army in 2017 and went to work for Northwestern Mutual, which allowed him the opportunity to explore and get grounded in the financial sector. This past summer Brandon embarked upon his entrepreneurial journey and created his own financial practice, Imperium Capital. Brandon was well on his way of creating greatness in the financial world. This endeavor brought great love, commitment and passion to his life, and he was determined to make something big out of nothing, following in his father’s footsteps.\n\nBrandon was a committed son, brother, husband, father, and friend. This is evident by the amount of people around the United States and world who have shown their support and love during this incredibly difficult time. The profound amount of sadness is indescribable. Brandon loved well and showed up for so many. Brandon’s humor, wit, and smile will be greatly missed by all who had the pleasure of knowing him. The overwhelming love and support, like his commitment to country and others, has been unwavering. Although it seems impossible, we’ll weather this storm and our love for Brandon and God will lead us through.\n\nSurvivors include: wife, Wendy and children, Adler and Hadley, Colorado Springs, CO; parents, Jon and Marlys Stevenson, Dickinson, ND; brother, Nic (Terri) Stevenson, Dickinson, ND; father and mother-in-law, Wayne and Vangie Jorde, Dickinson, ND; grandma, Marlene Stevenson, Miles City, MT; brothers-in-law, Justin (Lisa) Jorde, Thornton, CO; Joshua (Lindsey) Jorde, Dickinson, ND; sister-in-law, Angie (Bryan) Muri, Colorado Springs, CO; half sister-in-law, Angela (Steve) Bagan, Fargo, ND; nieces and nephews: Sadie, Nathan, Ali, Patrick, and Delaney Stevenson; Marisa and Aralynn Panasuk; Addison, Scarlett and Payton Jorde; Kinley and Levi Muri.\n\nBrandon was preceded in death by his grandfather Dale Stevenson, niece Ava Jorde, and Grandpa Whimp. As well as his brothers-in-arms Captain Jay Jones and Major Sean Maples.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests contributions to the Brandon Stevenson Memorial Fund that will help ensure that Adler and Hadley are able to live out their dreams.\n\nArrangements by Stevenson Funeral Home – Dickinson\n\nPaula Suzanne (Kimple) Whitaker was born in Salem, Oregon on December 26, 1936, to Donald and Delpha Kimple. She came from a heritage of pioneer stock, as many of her ancestors were part of 1845 great migration who travelled west in covered wagons. They were among the earliest settlors of Oregon. She grew up in Eola, Salem and Keizer. Paula graduated from North Salem High School in 1955. After graduation, she was hired at “Ma Bell”, the phone company. She worked a total of 40 years before retiring.\n\nPaula met the love of her life, Laurence “Larry” Whitaker on a blind date. The two were smitten with each other and married on September 7, 1957. One week later, the two moved to San Francisco, where Larry went to mortuary school. Paula typed all of his notes and at the end of the school year, she was confident she could pass the state boards! In 1958, Larry graduated and the two began life in the Funeral Industry.\n\nIn 1958, they welcomed their first daughter, Debbie, and 22 months later, their son Scott was born. Soon after, they purchased a funeral home and ambulance service in Albany, Oregon. The family lived in the funeral home when their youngest daughter, Lynn, was born. Paula would comment on the challenges of raising young children while living in the funeral home. She would also say the kids had excellent manners and knew how to use their “funeral voices” (speaking very quietly). While Larry ran the funeral business, Paula was also involved, particularly taking calls.\n\nIn the late 60’s, the funeral home was sold, and the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon. Paula transferred with “Ma Bell” and loved working in downtown Portland. She loved the hustle and bustle of the city. She and her good buddy, Judy, would hit the streets running during lunch hour to go shopping.\n\nPaula was a fantastic homemaker. Although she worked fulltime and had three kids, her home was always very neat, tidy, and clean. Paula loved music and was an accomplished pianist. She was a talented seamstress and made the majority of her and the girls’ clothes. She also was very talented at knitting, embroidery, needlepoint and later in life began a love affair with beading. She made all holidays very special for her family. The home was always decked out for each holiday. She would do her Christmas shopping throughout the year and would look for just the “perfect” gift and would gift wrap them with flair.\n\nIn 1978, Larry took a travelling sales job and was often out of town. Paula was quite the independent lady and would hold down the fort at home for weeks at a time. She was often taking phone orders when funeral directors would call. She could even guide funeral directors over the phone on how to clean the filter in their embalming machines!\n\nPaula was a die-hard Trailblazer fan and they had season tickets for well over 30 years. She would rarely miss a game and if Larry was out of town, she would take one of her kids or a friend. She was not going to miss a game just because Larry was out of town!!! Paula loved big cities – Portland, Seattle, and San Francisco. She also enjoyed trips to the Oregon Coast. By far her favorite vacations were the month-long trips Larry and Paula would take to the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nPaula has been described as feisty, a fireball, a spitfire. She was a daughter, sister, wife, mother, grand-mother, and friend. She was loyal and a champion of all she loved. She often could be heard exclaiming, “Oh! Isn’t that wonderful!”\n\nPaula is pre-deceased by her husband, Larry; daughter-in-law, Deon; and, grandson, Forest.\n\nShe is survived by her children Debbie (Jerry) Van Kirk; Scott (Alicia); Lynn (Paul) Szasz; grandchildren Brook and Steven; her brother, Steven (Brenda Pace) Kimple and a host of nephews, nieces, and friends.\n\nFuneral services will be held at 11:30 am Monday, August 23, 2021, at River View Cemetery in the Adams Chapel, 300 South Taylors Ferry Road, Portland, OR 97219. Private family entombment to follow in River View Cemetery Mausoleum.\n\nHowdy! That was always the first word to come out of Tyson’s mouth when he greeted people. Tyson Gene Haycock entered this world on the 21st of August, 2000 at the Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center in Idaho Falls, Idaho. His parents Dustin Gene Haycock and Jessica Christina Adams would later give him a sister and a brother. Natalie and Caiden, whom he loved dearly.\n\nTyson’s greatest joys were hunting with his family, volunteering at the Vet, playing and listening to music, caring for our dogs Jerzey, Copper, and Rocco and his cat Chirp. Those animals were his greatest pride and joy. He loved his mission more than anything else as he was serving the Lord and gaining his own testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Even though he only served a few weeks in New Mexico, he fell in love with his mission and especially his companions Elder Britton Jeremie Berrett and Elder Michael Austin Davis. Tyson is continuing his service to the Lord on the other side of the veil alongside his companion Elder Davis.\n\nOur brother Tyson was very outgoing, caring, and very very stubborn. Not a day went by when he didn’t do some act of service whether it be helping our neighbors, helping mom with work, cooking and baking for our family, or helping his little sister with her car troubles and all of her gardening needs. In fact, he insisted and was eager to do these things. Starting from a young age, he had a love for music. You would not find him without at least one earbud in his ear. We would often play “Guess the Song” as a family together as music is such an important aspect in our family. We would also have competitions seeing who could get the bigger deer. Tyson had his years where he was close to getting the biggest deer, but Caiden would always show him up. He would always take care of skinning it though. Tyson would still say he’s the better hunter. He would not leave the house without a sharp knife and would often be found sharpening one of his many knives. He loved nature and everything that came with it. He’d often chase Natalie with snakes, frogs, toads, and even a quail that he found in our yard. He loved making people laugh and smile and could tell when someone needed a pick-me-up. He loved being with his best friend “Pipsqueak” McKinsey Jerrel which included getting their cherished pedicures.\n\nIf you didn’t find him helping out mom or working around the house, then you would find him working on his many projects, his last of which being a bow. But at the end of the day, family and friends were most important to him.\n\nTyson was greeted on the other side of the veil on the 22nd of July 2021 by his grandmother Darlene Adams, great-grandparents Wayne and Alice Anne Christensen, great-grandparents Jim and Mabel Adams, grandfather Donald Haycock, grandmother Carla Vasquez, great grandparents Deral and Margie Haycock, great-grandmother June Haycock, great-grandparents James and Ruby Jennings, uncle Timothy Haycock, and aunt Jody Longie. We know that families can be together forever and hold fast to that knowledge.\n\nTyson is terribly missed by his parents Dustin and Jessica Haycock, sisters Natalie and Calista, brother Caiden, grandparents Jon and Suzie Adams, and many aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n\nThank you to all of those who showed their love to Tyson in the Idaho, Oregon, Montana, New Mexico and Utah areas.\n\nFamily will receive friends on Thursday, July 29, 2021 from 4:00-7:00 p.m. at Stevenson & Sons Funeral Home. Funeral services will be held on Friday, July 30, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. at the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints in Miles City. Interment will follow in the Custer County Cemetery. Condolences may be sent to the family by visiting: www.stevensonandsons.com.\n\nTyson loved animals, please, if desired, donate to your local animal shelter in honor of him.\n\nDale Zimmerman, 93, lifelong resident of Garrison, died on Sunday, December 20, 2020 at the Garrison Hospital, not COVID related. Funeral services will be held on Sunday, December 27, 2020 at 2:00 pm at the First Congregational Church in Garrison. Masks will be required.

CDC and North Dakota COVID-19 guidelines will be followed.\n\nDale was born May 2, 1927 to Herman and Beatrice (Ziegler) Zimmerman in Garrison, ND where he was raised and educated. He married Helen Johnson in Garrison on November 25, 1948.\n\nDale and Helen owned the Dairy Queen in Garrison and he later worked for REA as a lineman for two years. He then began what ended up being a 40-year career as a Service Representative for Otter Tail Power Company. He also worked part time for Rensch Farm Store for 5 years.\n\nDale was extremely active in the Garrison community. He was a member of the Garrison Sportsman Club, Elks Club, Garrison Jaycee's (twice the Jaycee Man of the Year), Garrison Trooper Boosters, and was deacon and board member of the First Congregational Church. He also served as the judge for the City of Garrison for many years. Dale was a very dedicated member of the Garrison Fire Department for 20 years and later attended all the departments activities as an honorary member.

Faith and trust in the will of God sustained her in all the seasons of life and formed the foundation of her family.\n\nDorothy Clay (Klimper) Malisani, 81, died Wednesday, November 18, 2020 at her home in the presence of her family and prayers from near and far. Clay was born July 8, 1939 in Malta, MT to Max and Dorothy (Whitcomb) Klimper.

In 1994 her very special granddaughter Rayne was born.\n\nWhile juggling her career and family life she perfected the art of motherhood. Whether it was waking up at 5:00 AM to drive her boys to a wrestling tournament and volunteering at it all day to maintaining everyday activities that accompany a growing family she never missed a beat. Her passion for motherhood was able to continue while supporting her granddaughter through basketball and other activities.

Alice hosted parties, reunions, and even weddings at the Seymour cabin in Wise River. Whether she hosted hundreds of attendees at the Sayers and Seymour family reunions or a dozen family members around the table at weekly Sunday dinners, all that mattered to Alice was that her family was around her.\n\nAlice loved exploring the Pioneer Mountains by snowmobile, ATV, or Sunday drives with Joe, her family, and her friends. Alice also enjoyed painting ceramics, sewing, cooking, and caring for her home and garden.\n\nIn the 2000 Sayers Family Reunion book she wrote:\n\n“Life has been a great adventure. But, the greatest adventure of all has been lots of fun and laughter with family.

During his earlier musical foray in high school, he noticed the piano player in the dance band, a pretty Anaconda girl named Marlene Murray.

He also had a dance band (The Moon Moods) that was well known throughout the Missoula area; Fred and the band’s drummer Mel Rice would remain lifelong friends.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Army, serving stateside and overseas in Japan with the post-WWII occupational forces. Following his discharge from active duty in 1954, he accepted his first teaching job as band director at Polson Public Schools. During this time, he also earned his Masters Degree from U of M.\n\nHe came to Libby in 1957, accepting the position as director of bands and music department supervisor for Libby Public Schools. He remained there during a period of student growth years with baby boomers and the influx from Libby Dam construction.

Ken was born in Wetaskiwin, Alberta, Canada to Frances McDougal and George Avison on June 5th, 1945.\n\nWhen Ken was 8 years-old he found his love for the art of magic and performed 100’s of shows with his faithful assistant Dorothy, his sister.

When he was with The Fendermen they had a huge hit called “Muleskinner Blues” that has been covered several times, most notably by Dolly Parton.\n\nDuring this time, he was also an avid hockey player (goalie) and got picked to play in the NHL. The day of signing he snapped his leg and that dream went out the window.\n\nHe had a long career as a school administrator both as a principal and superintendent, touching many young lives. He was given the nickname “Radar” because of his uncanny way of hearing and seeing everything, resulting in no one getting away with anything in his school. His mother, when visiting him at one of his schools, would ask if he was really in charge or if he was pranking her and was actually the janitor. This had to do with it taking more than 7 years to finish high school due to his pranks and rock and roll lifestyle!\n\nHe is preceded in death by his parents, brother-in-law’s Tom Vert and Darrell Sutton and several good friends.\n\nKen is survived by his wife of 50 years, Tami; his sons Jason, Kevin (Aimee), and Ryan Avison.

On February 10, 2019, he died refusing to follow the doctors’ orders, being stubborn and coloring outside the lines for nearly eight decades. Russ met death as he lived; on his own terms along the banks of the Missouri River in the golden pastures of Floweree that captivated him.\n\nAs a certified organic farmer and rancher, Russ was a pioneer in the field and a champion for the Earth way before “being green” was cool. Countless individuals and organizations turned to Russ for his progressive thinking, proven techniques, guidance and generous support. For many, it was Russ who came along with a “Hatful of Peas”.\n\nRuss’ true color was bold! A manly man, he delighted in wearing his favorite color purple for impact. He had the courage and strength to live out the extreme beliefs and ideals that others only talk about. His commitment to his word was his deeds. “Hard work and honesty are the only two things that matter in this life”.\n\nRuss knew the value of even the most worn down, used up crayons in the bottom of the box. He collected things others considered useless envisioning a way they could be reused, repurposed or remade; the Kaiser car converted into a shop truck for Russ’ service station, the corral constructed out of old vehicles, the converted school bus hauling cattle down the highway with their heads hanging out the windows, and so much more!\n\nRuss scribbled brightly wide and long. The master mechanic with an artistic flare was practical yet eccentric, complex yet simple, thrifty yet generous. He struggled to express what was on his mind and in his heart, but his hands and feet spoke loudly. His strong, grease stained hands designed whimsical metal sculptures, made every machine “go”, and easily tossed 55-gallon drums. Those same hands held on ever so lightly as his fancy feet glided effortlessly and famously across the dance floor. Ladies stood in line for a twirl with Russ!\n\nBeneath the surface of all that Russ planted in his life lays a deeply rooted, vibrantly colored legacy. Russ is survived by the land which was the love of his life; wife, Elsie Tuss; brother, Kirby (Tina) Salisbury of Belize, Central America; sons, Shane (Ann) Salisbury of Billings and Todd Salisbury of Carter; grandchildren, Damon Salisbury of Casper, WY, Cory Salisbury of Mesa, AZ, Castle and Sophia Salisbury of Billings; niece, Christie Juarez; nephew, Scott Salisbury; and a varied assortment of colorful characters.\n\nRuss requested no service. We honor his request but cannot deny our loss and wish to remember Russ. We welcome your condolences, thoughts and memories. Please, send them to 717 Agate Avenue, Billings, MT 59105.\n\nDr. Seuss said it best, “Why fit in when you were born to stand out?”\n\nJohn “Bernard” Dahl, 93 of Billings died November 21, 2018 surrounded by his loving family.\n\nBernard was born February 28, 1925 in Rhame, North Dakota to Danish immigrant Emil and Irish homesteader Alice (Kane) Dahl.\n\nBernard was the youngest of five children.
