        "text": "The Merionethshire coast from Barmouth up towards Porthmadog is home to a small cluster of Ffynhonnau Mair – wells dedicated to St Mary, the majority of which are little known and no longer flowing. The six are identified on the map below. A forthcoming article by Janet Bord in the Journal of the Merioneth Historical and Record Society explores the legend of St Mary’s visit to Merioneth and the legacy in terms of the numbers of wells and other landmarks named in her honour in this area.\n\nI have reported previously on the wells and Dolgellau, Maentwrog and Llanfair. on the way to my most recent visit to Llanfair, I also stopped off at the site of Ffynnon Fair at Llanaber.\n\nThe only references I have found to the well are from newspaper articles published some hundred years ago, at this time it would appear that the well was still visible and remembered. I have found no record of it having been closed or of whom the last people were to see it.\n\nLlanaber is a small coastal village that over recent times has become increasingly consumed by Abermaw (Barmouth), both being adjacent popular seaside holiday resorts.\n\nThe church at Llanaber (below) is dedicated to St Bodfan and St Mary, though generally referred to as St Mary’s. The well was close to an area known as Hendre Mynach. Mynach (a monk) is an element of a number of features in the immediate area and is taken to imply that a monastery once existed in the area. It may be that it was a house belonging either to Cymer Abbey, a Cistercian monastery a few miles inland from Llanaber, or to its offshoot Egryn Abbey a few miles to the north. This is believed to have been a hospital dedicated to St Mary. There is no evidence for ownership of Hendre Mynach by either.\n\nHowever, one must assume that the history of the well is bound up with the history of any religious establishment at Hendre Mynach (the present building is shown below). In 1902 the well was described as being\n\nin the corner of a field at the back of Hendre Mynach old farmhouses and close to Glyn-y-mynach. It measures 9 feet long by 6 feet wide and 5 feet dep. The lower end of the well has been taken away, and the steps which led down to it have also disappeared. Some years ago the side of the well next to the field fell in, after which it was never properly repaired.\n\nIn 1902 the local antiquarian Rev Mather noted that\n\nAt one time bucket fulls of small white pebbles, about the size of hazel nuts, intermixed with a large number of pins, some straight and some crooked, were taken out of it. The water was used for the cure of warts. After they had been bathed they were pricked with a pin, which was then bent and dropped into the well. the white pebbles, which evidently served a similar purpose, were placed, a pebble on each wart and then thrown into the well. And we may gather that persons who suffered from rheumatism, sore and weak eyes and other ailments, having bathed the affected part dropped pebble or a pin into the well.\n\nDavid Richard who is nearly 88 [thus born around 1814] was born and bred in the small farmhouse on the north side of the stream. He remembers patients visiting it to use its waters for healing purposes. He believes there is no water like it in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe description of the well places it close to Glyn-y-Mynach, which has been anglicised as Friars Glen, at one time a popular footpath leading up into the hills overlooking Barmouth . This name seems at one time, either accidentally or by design corrupted into the Fairy Glen which became popular with early 20th century visitors, reflecting similar named areas in other holiday resorts. However, by 1914 complaints were being received that the Fairy Glen had been closed down, a letter to the press noted the potential impact of this on hotel keepers trade. (the stream referred to at the end of Glyn-y-Mynach below].\n\nThe legend of St Mary in Merioneth persists, but the wells, the imprints of her feet and other body parts in the stones that she touched, flowers that bloom in her honour and tales of her giant leaps across the landscape have faded. from memory.\n\nFfynnon Fair at Llanaber may still exist, hidden in the grounds of a farm or camp site, but I could find no evidence of it, and like several of her other wells on this part of the coast I think, unless evidence comes to light to the contrary, we have to consider it lost.\n\nReferences\n\nBord, Janet (2023) .
