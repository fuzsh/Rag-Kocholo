From whatever point the traveller approaches, his mind cannot fail of being forcibly impressed with the singular beauty of its situation and general aspect;—its dark and frowning p. 2castle, the elegant towers and gracefully tapering spires of its ecclesiastical structures; the undulating, irregular, yet picturesque disposition of its buildings, and above all, the beautiful windings of “Severn’s ambient wave;”—all combine to form a prospect surpassed by none and equalled but by few other towns of our island.\n\nFrom the gradual and progressive improvements of civilization, the present condition of the town presents few points of resemblance to the appearance indicated in its original Saxon name, Scrobbesbyrig, the fenced eminence overgrown with shrubs; a dense population of more than 20,000 inhabitants [2] now dwelling within its extent, busily engaged in the manufactures of linen, thread, iron, brawn, &c.—not forgetting those far-famed cakes\n\n“Whose honour’d name th’ inventive city own,\n\nRendering thro’ Britain’s isle Salopia’s praises known.”\n\nIts earliest history, like that of most other ancient places, remains involved in obscurity; though it is p. 3now the generally received opinion, that the town was founded by the Britons, who, expelled from the adjacent station of Uriconium, or Wroxeter, which they continued to inhabit after the final departure of their Roman masters, sought here that refuge against their Saxon enemies which the then nature of the country was so well capable of affording them. During the progress of succeeding ages, our town and its inhabitants, have, of course, by turns flourished amid the calm prosperity of peace, and trembled at the terrors and desolations of overwhelming warfare. But the ample details of its important history are totally foreign to the purpose of the present manual; the highest aim of which, is to furnish to the intelligent and inquisitive traveller, a faithful, though humble guide, in conducting him, in his survey of the place, to those objects which, from general or local circumstances, are most deserving his attention and observation. [3]\n\nTo all classes, in their various and varied pursuits, our town will be found replete with matter of interest p. 4and instruction. The refined traveller will here meet with customs and manners peculiar, singular, and interesting—the artist, subjects for his pencil and exercise for his judgment, in imitating the tints and stains of time and nature’s never-ceasing powers—the historical antiquary will, with enthusiastic delight, trace its connexion with many of the grandest features of our national history—the architectural antiquary will find ample scope for many an hour’s delightful meditation on the massive grandeur of the “oulden time”—whilst to the scrutinising eye of the naturalist, the vicinity will, at every step, unfold objects of beauteous and wondrous design, which will uplift his enraptured mind, as he fondly gazes on them, in heartfelt gratitude, adoration, and praise, to the bounteous Giver of all good.\n\nCommencing then at the centre, let us first survey that emporium of civic honour,\n\nTHE TOWN HALL.\n\nThe ancient Guild Hall was a large, low, timber structure, with a high clock-turret, erected in the reign of Henry VIII. and stood across the Market Square, nearly at right angles to the centre of the New Hall. The lower part consisted of shops, and a covered way for carriages communicating with the p. 5High Street. The upper story contained the rooms in which the business of the town was transacted, and the assizes held. The Exchequer, in which the municipal records were preserved, stood on the south-east side, and was a strong square stone tower of three stories, erected in 1490.\n\nThis incommodious building was in 1783 levelled with the ground, and a new hall erected in its place, after the design of the late Mr. Haycock of this town, at an expense of £11,000, and opened for public business on 17th March, 1786. In excavating the foundations, considerable deposits of what was apparently manure were discovered, indicating, in all probability, the existence of a farm-yard on the spot, at some very early period. The new structure exhibited a handsome stone front towards the Market Square, and consisted of a spacious vestibule, and two not very convenient courts for the assizes, on the ground floor. A large assembly room, grand jury room, and spacious offices for the business of the town and county, occupied the upper story, to which an elegant spiral staircase of stone led from the vestibule below.\n\nConsiderable sinkings having in 1832 been observed in different parts of the structure in consequence of the instability of the foundations, the building was surveyed by eminent and experienced p. 6architects, and pronounced unsafe and dangerous. The matter was immediately deliberated upon by the proper authorities, and after due investigation, it was determined to take down the whole edifice and erect a more commodious one on its site. For the double purpose of obtaining a more eligible foundation, and of adding a considerable additional space in front to the Market Square, some adjoining premises were purchased by subscription, and a substantial structure, well adapted for all the purposes of the business to be therein transacted, was, in 1837, completed by Messrs. Birch, of this town, after a design by Sir Richard Smirke. The cost of this building was about £13,000, and was raised by a county-rate.\n\nThe disposition of the interior embraces on the ground floor, a vestibule, affording a communication with rooms on either side for the mayor, counsel at the assizes, and witnesses, and beyond with two spacious courts and robing rooms for the judges. On the second floor are arranged the clerk of the indictments, grand jury and witnesses attendance rooms; and on the upper floor, the town clerk’s and clerk of the peace’s offices, and a great room, 45 feet by 32 feet, for general purposes; on this floor are also fire-proof chambers for the safe preservation of the municipal records. Under the crown court are cells, &c. for the prisoners, and a room for the p. 7deliberations of juries. Its exterior elevation is here represented:—\n\nThe following pictures, presented at various times to the Corporation, adorn the walls of the Town Hall: Charles I.; Charles II.; William III.; George I.; George II.; George III. and his Queen Charlotte; Admiral Benbow; Lord Hill, by Sir William Beechy; and Admiral Owen, painted by our townsman, R. Evans, Esq. R.A. by subscription. An excellent likeness of The Honourable Thomas p. 8Kenyon, late Chairman of Salop Quarter Sessions, and various other local portraits, are arranged around.\n\nThe Norman Earls of Shrewsbury, to whom the town belonged after the Conquest, ruled the burgesses with the iron sway of tyranny. From this thraldom they were somewhat relieved by Henry I., who conferred on them many valuable privileges, and diminished the rent of their town. Henry II. was the first king who granted them a written charter, but from his time to the reign of James II. almost every successive sovereign has confirmed or enlarged their privileges and customs. A guild merchant existed here, antecedent to the 11th John, and was recognized and established by charter of 11th Henry III. 1226–7, by which, every one carrying on business in the town was compelled to become a member of it. The town was anciently governed by two Bailiffs or Provosts, until the Corporation was remodelled by charter of 14th Charles I., under which it consisted of a Mayor, (annually elected,) Recorder, Steward, Town Clerk, 24 Aldermen, 48 Common Councilmen, 2 Chamberlains, and inferior officers. Under the Municipal Reform Act, Shrewsbury was divided into five wards, and is now governed by a Mayor, 10 Aldermen, and 30 Councilmen. There are also 12 magistrates appointed by the Crown to assist in the local government of the town.\n\np. 9THE MARKET SQUARE\n\npresents an interesting and antique appearance, on account of the numerous old timber houses, which still remain on its sides. It consists of a large oblong space, the northern half of which affords room for an excellent Green or Vegetable Market, whilst the southern half is occupied\n\nTHE MARKET HOUSE,\n\nwhich, according to an inscription over the northern arch, was erected in 1595, at the expense of the Corporation. It is one of the most spacious and p. 10magnificent structures of its kind in the kingdom; is of wrought freestone, and in the fantastic style of the 16th century. The principal front faces the west, and has in the centre a spacious portal; over which are sculptured, in high relief, the arms of Elizabeth, under a canopy adorned with roses, with the date 1596. Attached to the imposts of the great arch are pillars, each supporting a figure of a lion, with a blank shield on its breast. Above are two stories, with large square mullioned windows. On each side the portal is an open arcade of three spacious round arches, reposing on massive pillars; over which, a range of square mullioned windows lights the upper story, which is surmounted by a rich, though singular parapet, with grotesque pinnacles. Large open arches occupy the north and south ends, which are terminated above in sharp pointed gables. Above the northern arch, in a tabernacled embattled niche, is a statue of Richard, Duke of York, father of Edward IV. clothed in complete armour, and a surcoat emblazoned with his armorial bearings, removed from the tower on the Old Welsh Bridge, on its demolition in 1791. On his left are the town arms, azure, p. 11three leopards’ heads, or, sculptured in relief. The south end is decorated with a sculptured stone, representing an angel, with expanded wings, under a canopied niche, bearing in his hands a shield, charged with the arms of France and England, quarterly. This fragment of antiquity formerly stood in the southern tower of the Castle or North Gate of the town, and was removed hither in 1825, when that building was taken down to widen the street. The exterior of this fine old building has of late years undergone a needful reparation and careful restoration, and its northern front has recently received the useful appendage of an excellent clock, illuminated by gas, constructed by Joyce, of Whitchurch, in this County. The lower area is appropriated to the excellent Corn Market held here every Saturday.\n\nGeneral Markets are held on Wednesday and Saturday in every week, and Fairs for Cattle of all kinds, in the Smithfield, on alternate Tuesdays, and for Butter and Cheese, on the second Wednesday in each month.\n\nThe spacious apartments in the upper story of the Market Hall are occupied by the\n\nMECHANICS’ INSTITUTION,\n\noriginally established in 1825, and supported by subscriptions and donations. The present number of the members is 200. The Library comprises 2000 volumes, and the Reading Room is supplied with Periodicals and Newspapers. There are Classes for p. 12the English and French languages, Arithmetic, Mathematics, Music, Writing, Modelling and Drawing; and during the winter months Lectures are delivered every fortnight. The subscription is Ten Shillings and upwards per annum for members, and Five Shillings for students.\n\nOn the south side of the Market Square are\n\nTHE PUBLIC ROOMS,\n\nerected in 1840, by Mr. Stant, after the design of p. 13Mr. Haycock. On the ground floor in front is the principal entrance to the\n\nPUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION NEWS-ROOM,\n\nwhich is immediately above, and also to the spacious\n\nMUSIC HALL,\n\nwhich occupies the remaining portion of the second floor. The third story is divided into various rooms, used as Billiard Rooms, &c. The back apartments on the ground floor are appropriated to the Street Act Offices, and dwelling for hall-keeper, &c.\n\nThe Public News-Room, supported by annual subscriptions, is supplied with the principal London and Provincial Newspapers, Journals, Magazines, &c. and is open from 8 a.m. till 10 p.m.\n\nThe Music Hall is 90 feet in length, and 42 feet wide, and 38 feet high, with an Orchestra at the south end, containing a very fine-toned and powerful Organ, built by Bishop of London, and presented to the Choral Society of the town, by the late Rev. Richard Scott, B.D.\n\nAdjacent are the Stamp Office, the Salop Fire Office, the Police Station, and Post Office,—the two latter in the “Talbot Buildings,” recently well known as the old established “Talbot Inn,” formerly the warehouses of an eminent draper of the town, of the name of Oteley, of the family of Oteley, of Pitchford, p. 14County of Salop, and erected on the site of some of the buildings probably belonging to Vaughan’s Mansion, as is evident from the old stone foundations and singular vaults still existing in the basement.\n\nLooking towards the north, and turning on the left, we enter the High Street, where on the left-hand side is a noble timber house, now divided into separate dwellings, once the town residence of the (now p. 15extinct) family of Ireland, of Albrighton. When entire, it must have presented a grand and imposing appearance. The front consists principally of four deep ranges of bow windows, four stories high, very lofty, and terminated above in pointed gables, on each of which, are escutcheons of the arms of the Ireland family. Gules, six fleurs de lys, three, two, and one, argent. The principal entrance is through a flat Gothic arch. The premises are now the property of the Corbets of Sundorne.\n\nImmediately fronting the High Street, behind the premises of Mr. Burrey, upholsterer, are the remains of some extensive building of red stone, probably ecclesiastical, and in the style of the 14th century. Considerable doubts have been entertained by our best antiquarians concerning these remnants of fallen grandeur, and no record is extant by which their use or name can be ascertained with any certainty. In an entry in the chartulary of Haughmond Abbey, in this county, of the early date of 2d Rich. II. 1378, these premises are mentioned, as having been known before that time, by the name of\n\n“BENNETTE’S HALLE,”\n\nbut when or from what cause they acquired that appellation is unknown.\n\np. 16Turning to the right, we proceed up Pride Hill, on the right-hand side of which may be seen many curious old timber houses, the ancient mansions of our honest burghers.\n\nMidway of Pride Hill, on the right, is the\n\nDOUBLE BUTCHER ROW,\n\nin which are also many interesting specimens of domestic architecture.\n\nAt the top of Pride Hill, on the right, is\n\nTHE BUTTER CROSS,\n\nintended for the accommodation of persons bringing Butter, Eggs, and Poultry to the markets. The old cross, a heavy, inconvenient brick building, with a large reservoir on its top for supplying the upper parts of the town with water, stood nearly in the centre of the thoroughfare, whence it was removed in 1818, and another erected at the expense of the Corporation, on the present site; which also proving insufficient and inconvenient, was taken down, and the present structure, on an enlarged scale, built in 1844, by the Corporation, aided by the subscriptions of the town and neighbourhood.\n\np. 17In early times a Cross stood on this spot, of which frequent mention is made in old documents, by the name of the High Cross, and the adjoining street was called the High Pavement. Here proclamations were accustomed to be made, and criminals executed. This cross is remarkable as the place on which David, the last of the British Princes of Wales, underwent a cruel and ignominious death, by order of Edward I. and where many noblemen, taken prisoners at the battle of Shrewsbury, were executed.\n\nOn part of the site of the present Cross stood, previously, an ancient timber structure, probably part of the collegiate buildings of the adjacent church of St. Mary.\n\nNearly opposite the Butter Cross, on the left-hand side of the street, is an old mansion, now new-fronted, modernised, partially rebuilt, and divided, once, it is believed, the residence of the opulent and ancient, but now extinct, family of the Prides, who gave their name to the street “Pride Hill.” Some idea of its former splendour may have been collected from the ornamented plaster ceilings, which remained in several of the rooms, but which, by recent alterations, are probably now removed.\n\nProceeding onwards, we shortly reach, on the left,\n\np. 18THE RAVEN INN,\n\nwhere the ingenious George Farquhar wrote his sprightly but licentious comedy of “The Recruiting Officer,” during his residence in our town in 1704, in that capacity. The scene of the play is laid in Shrewsbury, and though the plot may not have had any foundation in reality, it has been ascertained, on indubitable evidence, that the author took for the originals of his characters, many distinguished persons, living or well known at that time, in the town and neighbourhood. The window of the room, which tradition points out as that in which the drama was composed, still exists, and may be seen from the yard of the Inn.\n\nAt the end of Castle Street, on the right side, the remains of\n\nST. NICHOLAS’S CHAPEL\n\npresent themselves to the spectator; the architecture of which, with the exception of a pointed window at the west end of later date, is entirely of the early Norman era: and it is highly probable that the Chapel was erected by Roger de Montgomery, the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, for the use of such of his retainers as resided in the outer works of the Castle. The only portions of this edifice at present remaining, are the nave, a massive semicircular arch, formerly opening into the (now entirely p. 19destroyed) chancel, and two similar side arches. The building is the property of the Lysters of Rowton, and has been converted into two stables and a coach-house.\n\nImmediately adjoining, on the right, is the venerable and highly-ornamented timber\n\nGATEWAY OF THE COUNCIL HOUSE,\n\nwhich presents an interesting and curious specimen of the domestic architecture of the year 1620; that p. 20date, and the initials W O E, indicating it to have been built by one of the Owens of Condover, the then possessors of this property, being still visible on the south-eastern front.\n\nEntering through this gateway, we approach\n\nTHE COUNCIL HOUSE,\n\nwhich is so called from having been the occasional residence of the Council of the Marches of Wales, during their annual visit to our town. [20] It is situated on a lofty bank, which abruptly rises above the river Severn, and commands a most interesting and enlivening prospect of the surrounding country. The buildings occupy three sides of a small court, and are now divided into three excellent houses. Of late years they have been so considerably altered and modernised that little of the original structure is at present discernible. That portion which includes the Hall and the Great Chamber over it, comprises nearly the whole of the building which retains any resemblance of its original features. These once magnificent apartments, during the last alterations, were subdivided and despoiled of the stained glass, p. 21elaborately carved chimney pieces, [21] and richly ornamented ceilings, which contributed so largely to their former splendour. The carved wooden porch, once affording entrance to the hall, has, with other relics, been carefully preserved.\n\nThe house was originally erected about 1501, by Peter Newton, Esq. one of the Council of the Marches, and having passed through numerous hands, is now the property of the Lysters of Rowton.\n\nThis venerable mansion afforded, in 1642, an asylum to the unhappy Charles the First, upon the commencement of his troubles. His Majesty resided here for six weeks, during which time the gentry of Shropshire flocked around him, and testified their deep attachment and unshaken loyalty, by contributing most liberally in this hour of need to their sovereign’s exigencies. James II. also on his visit to the town, kept his court here on the 24th of August, 1687.\n\nThe next object which demands our attention is\n\nTHE GATEWAY OF THE CASTLE,\n\nthe arch of which is the only existing part of the original Norman fortress of Roger de Montgomery. p. 22It is eighteen feet in height, semicircular, with plain round facings, and its walls appear to have sustained a tower, from whence hung the portcullis.\n\nThrough this gateway we are conducted into the inner court of p. 23whence we obtain a comprehensive view of the existing remains, which consist of the keep, the walls of the inner court, and a lofty mound on the south side, probably part of the early fortress constructed here by the Britons. From the various dilapidations and changes which the fortress has undergone during the course of many centuries, no adequate idea can now be formed of its original size and strength. The Castle stands boldly elevated on a steep bank of earth, on the narrow isthmus formed by the p. 24Severn, and is approached from the town by a gentle ascent.\n\nThe Keep, the walls of which are of great strength and thickness, was erected by Edward I. and is a square building, connected with two round towers of equal diameter, embattled and pierced, and originally consisted of one great apartment on each of the upper floors. The interior, as well as the exterior, has been greatly altered. A handsome stone staircase, of modern construction, leads from the vestibule (in which is a statue of the founder, Roger de Montgomery), to the principal apartments. The drawing room, used as a guard-chamber in the time of Charles 1st, is spacious and handsome. A stone stair-case within the wall, lighted by narrow chinks, leads to an apartment in the western tower, in which was a recess, with a strong groined ceiling, and small acutely pointed windows.\n\nThe summit of the mound above mentioned, is crowned with ruinous walls, and an ancient watch tower, which, during the last repairs was converted into a delightful summer room, commanding a fine panoramic view, and now called Laura’s Tower.\n\np. 25On the east side of the court is a postern, built probably during the civil wars; and adjacent to it are the massive foundations of an ancient tower.\n\nIn the area of the court, now entirely cleared of buildings, the Knights of the Shire have, from time immemorial, been girt with their swords by the Sheriff.\n\nOf that invariable appendage of castles, the Chapel of St. Michael, all traces have long been swept away. Its site is even now a matter of conjecture. Originally it was endowed with considerable landed estates, was a “Royal Free Chapel,” and was subsequently granted, with its appendant, the Church of St. Juliana, in this town, by Henry IV. to his College erected at Battlefield, in commemoration of his victory there.\n\nRoger de Montgomery, the first Norman Earl of Shrewsbury, is regarded as the founder of the Castle, though it is more probable that he only enlarged a smaller fortress which is known to have existed here anterior to his times. To afford an eligible site for his new buildings, he is stated to have destroyed fifty-one houses; a fifth part of the whole town at that period. On the forfeiture of Earl Robert de Belesme, in the time of Henry I., the castle became a royal fortress, and was entrusted to the custody of the Sheriff, and the vast possessions p. 26annexed to it were parcelled out among various knights, to be held by the service of castle ward. During the turbulent reign of Henry III. the castle fell into a state of great dilapidation, but his son, Edward I., immediately on his accession, almost entirely rebuilt the structure; which, upon the submission of the Welsh, being no longer needed as a military fortress, was again abandoned to ruin and decay.\n\nIn the reign of Elizabeth a grant was made of its site and buildings to Richard Onslow, Esq. who subsequently transferred his interest to the Corporation. During the civil wars it was repaired and garrisoned for the royal party; but being besieged by the parliamentary forces, it surrendered in 1645, and escaped demolition by being entrusted to Colonel Mitton, a native of the county. On the Restoration it reverted to the Corporation, who, in 1663, surrendering their title to Charles II., that monarch presented it to Francis Viscount Newport, afterwards Earl of Bradford, from whom it has passed to the present proprietor, the Duke of Cleveland.\n\nNearly opposite the Castle is\n\nTHE ROYAL FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL OF KING EDWARD VI.\n\nfounded by that monarch by letters patent, dated 10th February, 1552, and endowed with portions p. 27of the estates of the late dissolved Colleges of St. Mary and St. Chad, in this town. The original endowment, on the request of the learned, estimable, and ever to be venerated Thomas Ashton, the first Schoolmaster, was considerably enlarged by Queen Elizabeth, in the 13th year of her reign, by a donation of other portions of the properties of those ecclesiastical institutions. Mr. Ashton himself left by will a handsome legacy; and Dr. John Taylor, the learned editor of Demosthenes, bequeathed the greater part of his valuable library.\n\np. 28The amount of the present annual revenue is £3086. 15s. 1d. which is appropriated in the payment of the Salaries of the Masters and Bailiff, the maintenance of scholarships and exhibitions in the Universities, the stipends of the Vicar of Chirbury, and the Curates of St. Mary, Clive, and Astley, the necessary repairs, &c. of the school-buildings and estate, the Library, Rewards, Prizes, &c., providing residences for the Incumbents of the School livings, and a Play-ground. The surplus is applied to the formation of a Reserved Fund, not exceeding £5000, to be applied from time to time, under the direction of the Court of Chancery, for repairs, &c. of the School buildings and Estate.\n\nThe head-master receives a salary of £425, including £100 for Mathematical instruction, and a further sum of £40 as catechist and reader; the second master £200, and the third master £100, with the use of dwelling-houses, free from rent, taxes, and repairs; the French and German master £50, and the writing master £50.\n\nThe exhibitions and scholarships from this school to both Universities, are numerous and valuable, and are mostly confined to the sons of burgesses, (who have attended the school for two years), born in the town or suburbs, or in the Abbey Foregate; or in default of such, to persons born in the parish p. 29of Chirbury; or in default of such, to those born in the county of Salop.\n\nAdvantages open to all boys educated at Shrewsbury School.\n\nFour scholarships of £63 per annum each, on the foundation of John Millington, D.D. at Magdalen College, Cambridge, tenable during residence till M.A. Electors, the Master and Fellows of the College.\n\nOne Fellowship of £126 per annum, on the same foundation, in the same College. Electors, the same.\n\nOne Exhibition of £23 per annum, on the foundation of John Taylor, D.D. open to any College. Electors, the Head and Second Masters, and the Mayor of Shrewsbury.\n\nOne Exhibition of £10 per annum, on the foundation of Mrs. Nonnely, for a boy proceeding to the University of Oxford.\n\nOne Exhibition of £30 per annum, on the foundation of Mr. Podmore, for a boy nominated by the Head Master, and proceeding to Trinity College, Cambridge.\n\nPrizes for Composition in the Greek, Latin, and English Languages, are awarded annually, with a Gold Medal to the best Scholar leaving School for the University. There are also Exhibitions for which Shrewsbury School has a preference, at Balliol College, Oxford, and at St. John’s College, Cambridge.\n\np. 30Advantages limited in point of qualification.\n\nFive Exhibitions of £50 per annum each, tenable for four years. Electors, the Trustees of the School.\n\nTwo Exhibitions founded by Mr. James Millington, for sons of burgesses born in Frankwell, and proceeding from the School in Millington’s Hospital to Shrewsbury School, and thence to Magdalen College, Cambridge. Electors, the Trustees of Millington’s Hospital. Value £40 per annum each.\n\nTwo Exhibitions, founded by Oswald Smith, of £25 per annum each, for sons of burgesses. Electors, the Head and Second Masters, and the Incumbent of St. Mary’s, Shrewsbury.\n\nFour Exhibitions to Christ Church, Oxford, founded by Mr. Careswell, for natives of Shropshire. Examiners, the Dean of Christ Church, or his Deputy. Electors, two or more Justices of the Peace for the County. Present value £60 per annum each.\n\nThe whole management of the school and revenue, was, by Act of Parliament, 38 George III. vested in the Bishop of Lichfield as Visitor, and Thirteen Governors and Trustees. The election of the head and second masters rests solely in the Master and Fellows of St. John’s College, Cambridge. The under-master is appointed by the head-master.\n\nAll the sons of burgesses of Shrewsbury, who are not under eight nor more than twenty years of age, p. 31may be admitted on the foundation, on application to the head-master, provided they are able to write and read English. Any boys not sons of burgesses may be admitted on payment of certain fees,—viz. two guineas admission, and fifteen guineas yearly.\n\nThe instruction in the schools is “in the Holy Scriptures, the Church Catechism, the Liturgy, Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of England, the Greek, Latin, English and French languages, Reading, Writing, and Grammar, in Ancient and Modern History, sacred as well as profane, and Geography, in Arithmetic and Mathematics, and also in such other modern Languages, Arts and Sciences, as the Governors, with the consent of the Visitor, shall think proper.”\n\nThe head-master is Rev. B. H. Kennedy, D.D.; the second master is Rev. W. Burbury, M.A.; the third master, H. Greenwood, Esq. M.A.; the assistant classical master, Edward Calvert, Esq. M.A.; Mathematics and Arithmetic, Rev. A. T. Paget, M.A.; Modern Languages, T. A. Bentley, Esq.; Latin Accidence and Writing, Mr. T. N. Henshaw.\n\nAmong the many persons of eminence who have received their education at this school we may enumerate Sir Philip Sidney; his friend, Sir Fulke Greville, Lord Brook; the son of Edwyn Sandys, Archbishop of York; the cruel Judge Jeffries; Lord p. 32Chief Justices Jones and Price; Dr. Bowers, Bishop of Chichester; Dr. John Thomas, Bishop of Salisbury; Dr. John Taylor, editor of Lysias and Demosthenes; Dr. Edward Waring, Lucasian Professor of Mathematics; James Harrington, the author of “Oceana;” Wycherley, the Dramatist; Ambrose Phillips, the Poet; and the Venerable Archdeacon Owen, and the Rev. J. B. Blakeway, the learned and estimable Historians of Shrewsbury.\n\nThrough the indefatigable exertions and learning of the late venerated head-master, (The Right Reverend Samuel Butler, D.D. F.R.S. &c. late Lord Bishop of Lichfield,) the institution attained to an unrivalled celebrity and repute, most deservedly ranking among the first public schools in England. And as an earnest of continued prosperity, we cannot do better than refer to the words of the venerable Bishop, who, on resigning his arduous duties to his learned and talented successor, stated “that he considered Dr. Kennedy, as the most brilliant scholar he had ever sent forth, as the brightest star in that galaxy of distinguished pupils whose names adorn the ‘Boards’ of Shrewsbury School.—That from Dr. Kennedy’s experience of his system, both as a pupil and assistant master at Shrewsbury School, from his constant practice as a lecturer and private tutor at College, and as an assistant master for six years or more at Harrow, as well as from his own unrivalled talents and high literary distinctions, from his fine p. 33taste and sound learning, there was not a shadow of doubt but that he would fully maintain the reputation which Shrewsbury School had already acquired, and would add, at least as many distinguished names to its Boards, during his superintendence of this important foundation, as had been inscribed there by himself in any equal period.” These bright anticipations of the venerated Bishop have been already, and are daily more and more fully realized.\n\nMore than 100 gentlemen educated at Shrewsbury School have during the present century been elected Fellows of various Colleges in both Universities, and nearly 250 Scholars and Exhibitioners; of whom more than forty have subsequently been Tutors or Lecturers in their several Colleges.\n\nPermission having been kindly granted, we are enabled to give the following copy of the Boards alluded to:—\n\n1806\n\nThomas Smart Hughes, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Browne Medal, Latin Ode.\n\n1807\n\nThomas Smart Hughes, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Browne Medal, Greek Ode.\n\nJohn Turner, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Second Bachelor’s Prize.\n\n1809\n\nThomas Smart Hughes, St. John’s College, Cambridge, First Bachelor’s Prize.\n\n1810\n\nThomas Smart Hughes, St. John’s College, Cambridge, First Bachelor’s Prize.\n\nWilliam Henry Parry, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Third Bachelor’s Prize.\n\np. 341811\n\nRobert Wilson Evans, Trinity College, Cambridge, Second Medallist.\n\n1812\n\nMarmaduke Lawson, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Browne Medal, Latin Ode.\n\nRobert Wilson Evans, Trinity College, Cambridge, First Bachelor’s Prize.\n\n1813\n\nWilliam Henry Parry, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Norrisian Prize.\n\nRobert Wilson Evans, Trinity College, Cambridge, First Bachelor’s Prize.\n\n1814\n\nMarmaduke Lawson, St. John’s College, Cambridge, Pitt University Scholar, (the first elected on that foundation.)\n\n1816\n\nMarmaduke Lawson, Magdalen College, Cambridge, Medallist.\n\nRichard P.

The portion immediately fronting the street was erected in 1630, and contains on the first and second floors dwelling houses for the assistant masters. The upper story is entirely occupied by\n\nTHE PRINCIPAL SCHOOL-ROOM,\n\nand was originally divided into three apartments by wooden carved partitions, now removed. The centre of this front is pierced by a gateway, adorned on each side with a Corinthian column, supporting p. 44statues of a scholar and graduate, bare-headed, and in the costume of the times. Over the arch is a sentence in Greek from Isocrates, importing that a love of literature is essential to the formation of a scholar. Above are the arms of Charles I. The windows, with the exception of a large pointed one in the style of the 14th century, at the south-end of the principal school-room, are all of the square form of the Elizabethan age. The walls are crowned with a singular and clumsy battlement of curled leaves and pinnacles.\n\nSituated at right angles to this is the remaining wing of the edifice, originally erected in 1595, comprising the chapel and library, with the tower containing the staircases in the angle.\n\nThe Chapel, in which prayers are read by the headmaster every morning, occupies the ground floor, and is divided from the ante-chapel, by an oak screen, carved in the grotesque manner prevalent in the days of Elizabeth. The pulpit and BIBLE-STAND are in a similar style. The ceiling is adorned with carved foliated bosses, interspersed with the arms of the founders, and of the first and late head-masters.\n\nAbove the chapel and of the same size, is\n\np. 45THE LIBRARY,\n\ncontaining a very valuable and extensive collection of MSS. and books. This part was lately rebuilt and repaired at a considerable expense. Two large pointed windows, filled with mullioned tracery, afford light to this venerable apartment; in the northern one of which are the arms of Edward VI.; Queen Elizabeth; St. John’s College, Cambridge; the See p. 46of Lichfield and Coventry impaling Cornwallis; and those of the town: and in the southern one, those of the four principal benefactors, with appropriate inscriptions in Latin. Richly foliated bosses, the arms of the founders, visitors, and thirteen first trustees, decorate the ceiling. Around the walls are portraits of Henry VIII. half-length; his son Edward VI. when a boy of ten or twelve; an Admiral, full length, in the dress of the time of Charles II.; five of the former head-masters, and the late head-master, Bishop Butler, by Kirkby.\n\nBy the late scheme made by the Court of Chancery, (1853) a sum not exceeding £70 yearly, is to be applied to the purchase and repairs of Books, Mathematical, Philosophical and other instruments and articles for instruction.\n\nWe would venture to suggest the propriety of persons educated at Shrewsbury School, or natives of the town and county, presenting to the Library copies of any works which they may publish. Such a practice would at once form an interesting memento of their connection with the venerable institution, and add to the valuable and useful stores already accumulated on its shelves, which in former years have been so greatly enriched by similar benefactions.\n\nThe Library also contains three sepulchral inscribed stones, and various other Roman antiquities p. 47from Wroxeter, and a small collection of fossils and natural curiosities.\n\nA court, enclosed by a stone wall, intervenes between the street and the schools. At the back of the school-buildings are two spacious houses for the head and second masters, most delightfully situated, and commanding extensive views of several portions of the town, the river and Welsh bridge, and the rich woods of Berwick and Almond Park. On this side are extensive play-grounds for the use of the school.\n\nPassing down Castle Gates, we have on our right\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT MEETING-HOUSE,\n\nand see immediately before us\n\nA BRIDGE\n\nof cast-iron of 64 feet span, which carries over the street five lines of rails of the Chester Railway.\n\nOn the right\n\nTHE STATION\n\nof the United Railway Companies opens to view.\n\nThis striking and handsome building is in a late perpendicular English style, and presents a frontage p. 48of upwards of 150 feet in length, and two stories in height, with a large square tower nearly 70 feet high, in which is one of the principal entrances, through a large four-centered arched doorway, above which is an oriel window projecting from a richly ornamented base, and a circular opening, within which is an excellent eight-day clock, with the latest improvements, manufactured by Messrs. Joyce and Son, of Whitchurch, in this county. A richly carved battlement, with octagonal turrets at the corners, of considerable elevation, terminates the summit.\n\nOn either side of the tower extends a large wing, divided into four equal spaces by projecting turrets, corresponding with those of the tower, surmounted with ornamental caps. These spaces are subdivided p. 49again horizontally above the heads of the upper and lower windows by enriched string-courses. Above the cornice a rich embrasured parapet runs the whole length of the edifice. The ridge of the roof is finished with an ornamental cast-iron crest. The windows are divided by stone transoms and mullions, with projecting drip-stones, terminating in corbel heads.\n\nThe ground floor is appropriated to booking offices, ladies’ and gentlemen’s waiting rooms, and a large refreshment room. Beneath the ground-floor are a large kitchen, cellars, &c. A board-room and offices for the various officers and clerks, occupy the upper floor.\n\nIn the left wing, as the visitor approaches, is a door opening into the booking and parcel offices: At the end of the right wing an entrance to the arrival and departure\n\nPLATFORMS,\n\nrespectively 600 feet and 450 feet in length, and 16 feet wide. A wrought-iron roof of 70 feet span covers the platforms and lines of rails for a space of 450 feet.\n\nThe water required for the use of the Station, Engines, and Carriages, is conveyed in iron pipes along the rim of the railway from high ground in the neighbourhood of Hencott, (60 feet above the level p. 50of the rails at the Station,) to a large iron tank near the Station, whence a constant supply can be immediately obtained in the event of fire breaking out.\n\nThe Goods, Engine Station, and Coal Depôts of the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway are situated between Coton Hill and the General Passenger Station, with convenient access from the Castle Foregate Street, where an abundant supply of Welsh Coal and Lime is always on hand.\n\nBranch lines diverge from behind the railway platforms, which pass under Howard Street to the Canal Wharf, where is the Depôt of the Shropshire and Staffordshire Coals and Cokes.\n\nThe Station House and Offices were designed by Mr. Thomas Penson, jun. of Oswestry. The Engineering works by Messrs. Robertson and Baylis. The former cost £6,000, the latter about £45,000, and the Goods, Engine, Station, and other necessary works, above £20,000.\n\nThe total cost of the above works, together with the Viaduct over the river Severn, and the brick Bridge over Cross Street, including land and buildings, exceeds £100,000.\n\nThe whole of the works have been executed by Mr. Brassey, the Contractor, under the direction of Mr. James Baylis, the resident Engineer, at the joint p. 51expense of the four Railway Companies whose lines unite in Shrewsbury.\n\nThe Railway to Chester was first opened October 12th, 1848. The line to Birmingham, November 12th, 1849. The line to Hereford was opened to Ludlow, April, 1852; and throughout, October 31st, 1853.\n\nTurning on the left, immediately opposite the entrance to the Railway Station, we pass on the same side, the Road leading across the Raven Meadow to Mardol. This meadow is now converted into a spacious and convenient\n\nSMITHFIELD, OR CATTLE MARKET,\n\na great boon to the town, inasmuch as the Fairs were previously held in the open streets, to the great annoyance, in point of cleanliness and convenience, of inhabitants and passengers.\n\nThe works with the site cost about £13,000, and are capable of affording accommodation for 700 horses, (with extensive trial grounds for the same), 1,400 cattle, 5,000 sheep, and 1,000 pigs, with suitable receptacles for sheep and cattle coming to town previously to the fairs which occur on the alternate Tuesdays in every month.\n\nHere are also held the Agricultural Shows, which are considered to equal those of most places where p. 52similar exhibitions have been established; and a Great Horse Fair is held annually in March.\n\nA little further on the right, we pass the\n\nRAILWAY BRIDGE\n\nover Cross Street, a piece of beautiful brick-masonry, and approach the river Severn, on the margin of which are\n\nTHE SHREWSBURY WATER-WORKS,\n\nestablished in 1830, in 347 shares of £50 each, for the purpose of affording the inhabitants a constant supply of river water, at a reasonable rate.\n\nThe Town is also gratuitously supplied with excellent spring water, from a fine spring called Broadwell, in a field near Crow Meole, distant about two miles, conducted by pipes to conduits placed in convenient situations in the principal streets.\n\nOn the right-hand side are\n\nTHE ROYAL BATHS,\n\nand immediately beyond, on the same side, stands\n\nBENBOW PLACE,\n\nthe birth-place of the renowned John Benbow, Vice-Admiral of the Blue; the details of whose gallant bravery are so familiarly known to all as to render their recapitulation here unnecessary.\n\np. 53Proceeding a short distance along Coton Hill, we soon reach another of the\n\nRAILWAY BRIDGES,\n\nfrom which, on the one side, we obtain a good view of the Chester Railway as far as Hencott Bridge, and on the other side, a comprehensive view of the various Railway Buildings, backed by a beautiful prospect of the Town, St. Michael’s Church, the Castle and its wooded Mount, Free Schools, Spires of St. Mary, and St. Alkmond. [53]\n\np. 54Retracing our steps, we gain, as we proceed, not unpleasing views of other portions of the town and its public buildings, and then passing along Cross Street, under the Railway Bridge, traverse the lengthened and unsightly suburb of the Castle Foregate, to\n\nST. MICHAEL’S CHURCH,\n\na neat brick structure, in the Grecian style, erected at an expense scarcely exceeding £2000 (raised by subscription,) and consecrated on 24th August, 1830, as a chapel of ease to St. Mary’s church.\n\nThe plan is oblong, and consists of a nave, side aisles, an elliptical recess for the altar, and a western tower. The interior is entered on the north and south, and is lighted by three circular-headed windows p. 55on either side. Over the side-aides are galleries, the sittings in which are free; and at the west end is a spacious one for the use of poor children, in which stands a small organ, the gift of the late Rev. W. G. Rowland, M.A., Minister of St. Mary’s. The same gentleman also most munificently adorned the windows of the chancel with fine stained glass, executed by Mr. David Evans, of this town, representing the Nativity, after Corregio; the Annunciation, after Guido; and the Presentation in the Temple, after Rubens. To the same unbounded liberality, the parishioners are indebted for the substantial service of communion plate, the peal of six bells which hang in the tower, and the erection of the adjacent schoolrooms for the poor children of this portion of the parish. The edifice contains 800 sittings, 620 of which are free, and has recently undergone alterations by which additional “sittings” are obtained for the already large and increasing population of the district. The judicious and economical arrangements of the burial ground merit the attentive consideration of every visitor.\n\nIt would ill beseem us to pass, without honourable mention, the talents of our ingenious townsman, Mr. David Evans, who, by unwearied exertions, and consummate skill, has raised the art of glass-staining to a degree of perfection unequalled in modern times, and nearly approaching, if not entirely equalling, the rich and mellow tints of the “royal glass” of p. 56ancient days. The numerous and singularly beautiful specimens of his elaborate labours, visible in the inimitable restorations of the splendid glass of Winchester and Lichfield Cathedrals, the churches of St. Mary, St. Michael, St. Chad, St. George, the Abbey, and domestic chapels of the nobility and gentry, in almost every part of the kingdom, speak, however, his merits more forcibly to the correct eye and refined taste, than whole volumes of our feeble encomiums. [56]\n\np. 57Returning along the Castle Foregate, the more remarkable objects are the Shrewsbury and Ellesmere Canal, the Manufactory of linen-thread, the Coal Wharfs, the Gas-Works, and the Goods and Coal Depôt of the Railway, the New Meeting House of the Wesleyan Reformers, and Buildings of the Freehold Land Society.\n\nPassing up Howard Street, on the left-hand side of which is the New Butter and Cheese Market, we approach\n\nTHE COUNTY GAOL,\n\nerected in 1793, on the principles of the benevolent Howard, after a design by Haycock, of Shrewsbury, at an expense of £30,000. The building is of brick, p. 58and is entered by a massive free-stone gate, on either side of which is a lodge. Over the gateway is a fine bust of Howard, by Bacon. Immediately behind is the governor’s house; an octagonal chapel occupies the centre; and the remainder of the structure is divided into four principal courts, with several smaller ones, around which are cloisters, with sleeping rooms above for the prisoners, and cells for the condemned and refractory. The male and female prisoners are kept apart, and distributed into classes. On the eastern side is the Infirmary, detached from the other buildings. A strong and lofty brick wall encompasses the whole.\n\nThe entire structure is strong, spacious, airy, well supplied with water, and every other necessary; and in point of situation for salubrity and beauty, vies with any of the adjoining eminences.\n\nAn admirable institution, supported by voluntary benevolence, entitled “The Prison Charities,” has subsisted within the walls for nearly fifty years, and has been productive of the most beneficial results. Its objects are to enable debtors and criminal prisoners, of deserving conduct, to provide by their industry for their better maintenance during confinement, and to furnish them with a seasonable supply of money and tools, for immediate use on their restoration to society.\n\np. 59Nearly opposite the Gaol is a\n\nBRIDGE\n\nconsisting of two timber arches, 85 feet clear span each, on the bow and string principle, which carries the public walk called\n\n“THE DANA”\n\nover the Railway Station, along the base of the Castle to the Street opposite the Free Schools. From the Dana walk a good view of the Station House and Railway is obtained, bounded by a long extent of the adjacent country in the back-ground.\n\nIn this direction however we must not proceed, but passing along the terrace on the south-east side of the Gaol, continue our walk on “the gentle Severn’s sedgy bank,” at the base of a steep and rugged declivity, most picturesquely planted and crowned with the Castle’s “worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,” and the antique gables of the Council House, and presenting pleasing views of the venerable Abbey, the adjacent suburb of the Abbey Foregate, and the massive and really grand\n\nRAILWAY VIADUCT\n\nover the river Severn, consisting of 7 elliptical arches, 45 feet span, rising 18 feet above the springings. The Viaduct is quite level throughout its p. 60whole length, in width is 39 feet, and the level of the rails about 36 feet above the ordinary level of the river.\n\nPassing under an arch of the Viaduct we see immediately before us the elegant English Bridge, and arrive at\n\nTHE WATERLANE GATEWAY,\n\nmemorable as the avenue through which the Parliamentary forces were treacherously admitted into the town, at the siege of Shrewsbury, 22nd February, 1644–5.\n\nAdvancing up this narrow lane, we leave, on the left, the site of\n\nTHE DOMINICAN, OR BLACK, FRIARS,\n\nlong since cleared of its buildings, and now converted into a wharf, warehouse, and excellent gardens. These friars established themselves here as early as 1222, and assumed as their founder Matilda, grand-daughter and co-heiress of Walter de Lasci, lord of Ludlow, and wife of Geoffrey de Joinville, of Vaucoulour.\n\nEdward IV., who, throughout the whole of his reign regarded Shrewsbury with much affection, selected this religious house as his occasional residence, p. 61and the place in which his Queen was delivered of her second and third sons, Richard Shrewsbury, (1473–4,) Duke of York, afterwards murdered in the Tower, and George Plantagenet, who died young. Many persons of distinguished rank, who fell in the battle of Shrewsbury, 1403, received interment here.\n\nOn levelling the ground in 1823, the foundations of three spacious apartments, fragments of mullions and pillars, emblazoned tiles, several skeletons enclosed in rude stone coffins, and great quantities of bones, were disclosed to view. The site is now the property of the Corbets of Sundorne.\n\nThe sloping ground rising above the site of this friary, and extending to the south and south-eastern wall of the town, where the Infirmary and other houses now stand, was, as we learn from a charter of Henry III., dated 1227, confirming the possessions of the Abbey of Shrewsbury, given by “divers citizens of Salopesbury” to the monks of that house “for the planting of a vineyard:”—a situation, according to the best writers on horticulture, eminently adapted to the cultivation of the vine.\n\nArrived at the top of the Water-lane, we enter, on the left, a cathedral-like close, in the centre of which the venerable edifice of\n\np. 62ST. MARY’S CHURCH\n\nuprears its “heavenward spire.” This church, once collegiate, is said to owe its foundation to Edgar the Peaceable, (959 to 975,) who, at the suggestion of Archbishop Dunstan, placed in it a dean, seven prebends, and a parish priest, though there is every probability that the foundation was antecedent to his reign. In the Saxon times, it possessed a landed estate of about 1300 acres, which it continued to hold p. 63at the time of Domesday, but of which it was soon after deprived, by what means we have no power of ascertaining. At the dissolution of collegiate churches, 1 Edw. VI., the revenues, which consisted chiefly of tithes, amounted to £42; the greater portion of which was granted in 1550, by Edward VI., towards the endowment of the Free Schools.\n\nFrom a very early period this church enjoyed the privilege of a Royal Free Chapel, exempt from the jurisdiction of the Bishop. This peculiar jurisdiction remained till the recent Act of Parliament (1846) restored it to the Bishop of the Diocese, and was held by lease, at an annual rent of £1 6s. 8d. of the Corporation, to whom Queen Elizabeth granted it by charter, dated 23rd May, 1571. The Minister was usually, though not necessarily, the lessee, and his style was “Ordinary and Official, Principal of the Peculiar and Exempt Jurisdiction of the Free Royal Chapel of the Blessed Virgin Mary.” In his Court wills were proved, letters of administration were granted, and all ecclesiastical matters, arising within the parish and its subordinate chapelries, adjudicated. The Official also granted marriage licenses, and licenses to the curacies of St. Mary and its chapelries.\n\nThe appointment to the living was vested by Act of Parliament, passed in 1801, in the Corporation, who in their choice are directed to give the preference to the son of a burgess who has been educated at p. 64the Free School, or to one born in the parish of Chirbury, in this county. The Minister is, ex-officio, Public Preacher of the town.\n\nThe parish of Saint Mary includes about a fourth part of the whole town, nearly the entire suburb of the Castle Foregate, and extends several miles into the country.\n\nWithin these sacred walls the Pope’s Legatees held their court in 1232, for the adjustment of the differences subsisting between Henry III. and Llewellin, Prince of Wales. In 1642, the unhappy Charles I., during his residence at the Council-House, attended divine service here, received the Sacrament, and made solemn protestations of his fidelity to the principles of the reformed religion.\n\nThis fine structure is cruciform, and consists of a nave, side-aisles, transept, chancel, two chauntry chapels, and a tower at the western end, crowned with a lofty and elegant spire. In the architecture three very distinct styles are conspicuous: the Anglo-Norman of the 12th century, in the basement of the nave, most of the doors, and other portions; the lancet style of the 13th century, in the chancel and transept; and the more obtuse arch of the 15th century, in the clere-story, side-aisles, chapels, &c. with a few trifling additions of later date.\n\np. 65The dimensions of the church are\n\nFeet\n\nIn.\n\nLength from east to west, including steeple\n\n160\n\n0\n\nLength of transept\n\n90\n\n0\n\nBreadth of nave and side-aisles\n\n50\n\n0\n\nHeight of steeple\n\n220\n\n2\n\nHeight of steeple from the level of the river\n\n300\n\n0\n\nEsteeming this ancient fabric to be the principal ornament of our town, we deem it necessary to add the following detailed description, which we trust will prove serviceable to the visitor in his attentive examination of the building.\n\nThe tower is broad and low, the basement of red stone, and the upper portion of grey, and of the Anglo-Norman and early pointed styles of architecture. The entrance is on the west side, through a plain pointed arch of the very earliest kind, springing from square jambs with regular impost mouldings, and having an internal arch, nearly triangular, inserted within the head. On the opposite eastern side, a very early pointed arch without mouldings, resting on short round Norman pillars with indented capitals, communicates with the nave. Two tiers of small round-headed windows pierce the lower stories, on all sides except the east. The upper story is lighted on each side by two united and handsome pointed windows, bisected by single mullions, forming quatrefoil heads, and divided by transoms in the middle. A facia, charged with roses, and terminating at the angles in projecting grotesque heads, ornaments p. 66the upper and lower portions of this story, which is finished with a plain embattled parapet, and crocketed pinnacles at the corners. From the summit of the tower rises an octagonal spire, “fine by degrees, and beautifully less,” pierced on alternate sides, with three tiers of tabernacled openings, and crowned with an open flower, cross and vane. In the tower is a peal of ten bells, the eight largest of which are extremely melodious. This beautiful tower and spire have been thoroughly repaired and restored at considerable cost, raised by subscription, under the superintendence of Mr. S. Pountney Smith, of this town, whose skill, judgment, and taste, in ecclesiastical architecture, are worthy of the highest praise.\n\nThe nave and side-aisles, externally in the pointed style of the 15th century, and of grey stone, are entered on the north and south-west by beautiful semicircular arches, adorned with chevron, lozenged, and foliated mouldings. Before the south-west entrance is an ancient porch, principally of Anglo-Norman architecture; the outer arch of which is circular, enriched with chevron mouldings, and issues from clustered columns with foliated capitals. The interior rib is obtusely pointed and unadorned. On each side is a small pointed window, exhibiting specimens of the earliest rudiments of the mullioned Gothic style, in which have been lately placed some highly interesting “roundels” of old painted glass, of German execution, on which are depicted various p. 67incidents, chiefly from the Apocrypha. The groined ceiling rests on two strong and plain ribs, crossing in the centre. Over this is a small chamber, with a plain pointed window.\n\nA stone porch, entered by a pointed arch, has recently been erected before the corresponding door, on the north side.\n\nThe nave is separated from the side-aisles by four semicircular arches, overspread with deep-cut early Gothic mouldings, springing from elegant clustered columns with foliated capitals of varied and beautiful designs. This union of the round arch and clustered pillar, which belong to such different æras, is singular and very unusual in our ancient architecture. Above is a clerestory, which is continued along the walls of the chancel, lighted by short double windows, bluntly pointed, and bisected by single mullions.\n\nBy the pious munificence of the late Minister, the Rev. W. G. Rowland, the west end has been enriched by an elegant Organ-screen, [67] in the style of Henry 7th’s time, designed and executed by Mr. John Carline, of this town. Three obtusely pointed arches, overspread with deep-cut mouldings and richly foliaged spandrils, and separated by intervening p. 68buttresses elaborately adorned with open flowers in relief set in reticulated divisions, open to the nave and form the lower portion of the front. Above which, from a string-course, charged with finely sculptured heads, flowers, &c. rises the upper part or parapet, consisting of a series of similar, though smaller arches, divided by slender buttresses, and filled with the like ornamented reticulations. Around the soffits of the larger arches are the following inscriptions, in ancient church-text:—\n\nVenite Domino exultemus;\n\nRupi salutatis jubilemus;\n\nJehovam hymnis concinamus;\n\nEt grates illi persolvamus—Hallelujah.\n\nJehovam virgines laudate,\n\nSenes et pueri celebrate;\n\nPsalmis ecclesia sanctorum\n\nExtollat Dominum Dominorum.\n\nLaudate carminis clamore,\n\nLaudate buccinæ clangore,\n\nLaudate organo sonoro,\n\nLaudate cymbalis et choro.\n\nThis spacious gallery contains a remarkably fine-toned organ, made by John Harris and John Byfield, 1729.\n\nThe beautiful ceiling of the nave is of pannelled oak, richly studded with elegant and exquisitely carved pendants and foliated bosses, and merits the most minute attention, not only on account of its p. 69elaborate workmanship, but as being one of the richest and most highly preserved specimens of its kind now in existence.\n\nThe side-aisles are each lighted on the sides by three pointed traceried windows, with smaller and earlier ones at the western terminations, and communicate at their eastern extremities with the transept, by semicircular arches, rising from thick round pillars with indented capitals.\n\nIn the windows of the western ends are figures of St. Andrew and St. John. The central window of the north aisle contains some beautiful stained glass from Holland, depicting the following subjects—Holy Family; Kneeling figure; Balaam and the Angel; the Donor and patron Saint; Adam and Eve; Mater Dolorosa; Angel appearing to the Shepherds; Disciples washing each other’s feet:—Justice; Kneeling figure; a Bishop in grief or disgrace; the Donor’s Wife and patron Saint. The windows on either side are filled with various ecclesiastical subjects. The central window of the south-aisle contains part of the history of St. Bernard; that on the west, the adoration of the Magi; and the east one, St. Helena, Kneeling figure, and Charlemagne.\n\nA lofty and graceful pointed arch, including in p. 70its span the entire breadth of the nave, rises from richly clustered piers with foliated capitals, and divides the nave from the ancient choir. Against the north pier is a beautiful Stone Pulpit, designed and executed by Mr. S. Pountney Smith, of this town, and erected by the parishioners as a Memorial of their late revered Minister, Rev. W. G. Rowland. Its plan is an unequal octagon, the sides of which are carved into deep-pointed arches, springing from round pillars with rich foliated capitals, resting on a basement of gradually receding mouldings, terminated by a richly carved boss representing the Saviour preaching. The trefoil and the dog-tooth are the prevailing ornaments throughout. The central panel towards the south bears a bas-relief of the Crucifixion; the arch on the east, a statue of St. Peter, and that on the west, St. Paul; the eastern panel represents the Angels appearing to the Shepherds; the western one, the Ascension; and the northern arch, the statue of St. John the Evangelist.\n\nEastward of this, on each side, is a similar arch of like dimensions, springing from the same pier. From these, the wings of the transept, corresponding in size and style, branch off to the north and south. In the eastern wall of each wing are two semicircular arches, those nearest the choir being larger than the others, and communicating with the chauntry chapels. At each extremity of the transept is a fine triple p. 71lancet window, highly enriched with slender shafts, foliated capitals, and delicate mouldings, and filled with beautiful stained glass. That at the north is of a rich and elaborate mosaic design, with oval compartments, enclosing figures of the Apostles and an escutcheon of the arms of George III., executed by Mr. David Evans. That at the south contains the memorial stained glass to the late Rev. W. G. Rowland, comprising figures of the Virgin and Child, St. Thomas, and St. Bartholomew, under rich florid canopies, with groups of angels above, bearing scrolls with inscriptions. The side walls are pierced with narrow lights, in couplets, in a similar but plainer style; one of which, on the west side of the north transept, contains the Virgin and Child, under a canopy; whilst the corresponding window in the south transept contains the arms of France and England quarterly, and the armorial bearings of the late Bishop Butler, and the alliances of his family. The narrow doorways [71] are semicircular, rising from round pillars with foliated capitals, and enriched with a moulding, consisting of a round branch, swelling at intervals into lozenged panels, charged with roses. Under the triple lancet window of the south transept is a large and bold Gothic monument, in three compartments, to the family of Lloyd, and to the widow of the late Bishop Butler: and around the walls of the north transept are p. 72placed the splendid Gothic monuments to\n\nTHE REV. J. B. BLAKEWAY,\n\nand the families of Dukes, Parry, and Hughes.\n\np. 73The following is the inscription on the former:—\n\nTO THE MEMORY OF THE REVEREND\n\nJOHN BRICKDALE BLAKEWAY, M.A. F.S.A.\n\nTHIRTY-ONE YEARS ORDINARY AND OFFICIAL,\n\nAND THIRTY-TWO YEARS MINISTER OF THIS PARISH,\n\nTHIS MONUMENT IS ERECTED\n\nBY THE VOLUNTARY SUBSCRIPTION OF HIS PARISHIONERS\n\nAS A TRIBUTE OF RESPECT FOR HIS TALENTS,\n\nESTEEM FOR HIS VIRTUES,\n\nAND GRATITUDE FOR HIS LONG AND FAITHFUL SERVICES\n\nAS THEIR FRIEND AND PASTOR.\n\nHE DIED THE TENTH DAY OF MARCH, MDCCCXXVI,\n\nAGED SIXTY YEARS.\n\nThese exquisite specimens of monumental skill, (together with many others in various parts of the edifice,) unrivalled in chaste elegance of design, and richness of execution, are the masterly productions of Mr. John Carline.\n\nThe chancel is elevated above the rest of the church, and is filled with carved oak stalls recently erected for the scholars of the Free Grammar School. It has on each side a narrow pointed arch, with deep mouldings rising from clustered pillars, opening to the chauntry chapels. On the north side near the richly decorated altar, is a beautiful and uncommon p. 74TRIPLE LANCET WINDOW; the central arch, remarkably acute, rising far above the lateral ones, and resting internally on two slender insulated columns, with capitals richly decorated with a combination of heads and foliage. These ornaments are continued as a frieze to the wall, and from the imposts project busts of monsters. This window contains some remarkably fine and highly finished stained glass, representing the history of the life of St. Bernard, said to be by Albert Durer, or at all events of his age. Another portion of this glass is in the central window of the south aisle of the nave. The great eastern window occupies the whole extremity of the chancel. Its arch is broad and inelegant, divided by clumsy mullions and tracery, and exhibits a specimen of the debased style of church architecture of the Elizabethan sera. In this window is the curious and beautiful ancient stained glass which filled the east window of Old St. Chad’s Church, prior to its demolition, and which was presented to this church in 1791. The subject is that favourite one of the old glass-stainers—the Genealogy of Christ from p. 75Jesse. Jesse is represented reclining in sleep; from his loins springs a vine, which overspreading the whole window, encloses in its branches the several kings his descendants. In the lower compartments are figures of three knights banneret, and three ladies, kneeling under foliated tabernacles; the former habited in hawberks and yellow surcoats, charged with a lion rampant gules. Underneath is an inscription, requesting our prayers for “Monsr. John de Charleton and Dame Hawis, sa companion,” from which, and from the armorial bearings, we learn that this exquisite piece of ancient art was set up by the great Sir John de Charleton, lord of Powis, and must have been executed between 4 Edward II., (1310,) when he was married to Hawise Gadarn, the heiress of the ancient Princes of Powis, and 1353, the year of his death. It has been conjectured that this glass was originally presented to the Grey Friars, in this town, to which religious house Sir John and his wife were great benefactors, and that it was removed to St. Chad’s at the dissolution—a singular instance of so fragile a material surviving the destruction of two vast and substantial edifices. The whole of this window has lately been thoroughly and most judiciously restored. The clerestory windows are filled with figures of Apostles and Angels.\n\nOn the north side of the chancel is the vestry, recently erected in the Norman style, the windows of which are filled with “roundels” of old German p. 76and Flemish glass, exquisitely finished; and immediately adjoining is the chauntry chapel of St. Catharine; in the east wall of which is a window of very uncommon form, consisting of a pointed arch, within which is a trefoil, containing, in stained glass, Christ seated on a throne amid the clouds p. 77and the dead rising to judgment. Immediately beneath is a round-headed window, in which is a kneeling figure in stained glass of the Virgin Mary, with angels hovering over her head, bearing in their hands a crown. On the north side is a large window, of three lights, with perpendicular tracery, containing fine old German glass representing the Crucifixion; Saint and kneeling figure; Judas betraying Christ; and St. Lambert and kneeling figure. This chapel is now used as a Baptistery, and the beautiful Ancient Stone Font stands in the centre, on a rich pavement of modern encaustic tiles. Against the north wall, an alabaster slab, engraved with figures of a warrior and lady, commemorates Nicholas Stafford, Esq. and Katherine, his wife, the reputed founders of this chapel, who died 1463, which formerly lay under the arched recess in the north wall.\n\nOver the door leading into the vestry is the monument, in white marble, erected by subscription, to the memory of the brave Admiral Benbow, a native of the parish. It represents an obtuse pyramid of black marble, against which leans an oval medallion full faced bust of the Admiral, surrounded with anchor, flags, and cannon; and below a delicately sculptured representation p. 78in bas-relief of a naval fight: underneath is the following inscription:—\n\nERECTED BY PUBLIC SUBSCRIPTION TO COMMEMORATE\n\nTHE SERVICES OF\n\nJOHN BENBOW, ESQ. VICE-ADMIRAL OF THE BLUE,\n\nA SKILFUL AND DARING SEAMAN\n\nWHOSE HEROIC EXPLOITS LONG RENDERED HIM THE BOAST OF\n\nTHE BRITISH NAVY,\n\nAND STILL POINT HIM OUT AS THE NELSON OF HIS TIMES.\n\nHE WAS BORN AT COTON HILL IN THIS PARISH, AND DIED AT\n\nKINGSTON IN JAMAICA,\n\nNOVEMBER 4TH, 1702, AGED 51 YEARS,\n\nOF WOUNDS RECEIVED IN HIS MEMORABLE ACTION\n\nWITH A FRENCH SQUADRON OFF CARTHAGENA IN THE\n\nWEST INDIES,\n\nFOUGHT ON THE 19TH AND FIVE FOLLOWING DAYS OF AUGUST\n\nIN THAT YEAR.\n\nAttached to the south side of the chancel is a large and lofty chapel, in ancient times variously called “The Leybourne Chapel” and “The Trinity Aisle.” There is every probability that it was founded about the year 1300, by one of the Leybournes of Berwick, as a place of sepulture for the family, and was subsequently enlarged into its present form by the Drapers’ Company of the town, soon after their incorporation in 1461. In the south-east wall are three stone sedilia, with canopied arches; and on the north side of the altar, a small locker, once used for keeping the Eucharist. A fine pointed arch, in the pure style of the 14th century, communicates with the chancel through the north-east wall. Under this is an altar, tomb, (probably p. 79of Simon de Leybourne, lord of Berwick, who died between 1300 and 1315,) the sides of which are adorned with canopied niches, formerly containing figures; and on the table reclines the figure of a knight, cross-legged, and in chain armour. In this tomb the headless corpse of Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester, “ill-spirited Worcester,” who was taken prisoner at the battle of Shrewsbury, 1403, and beheaded, is believed to have been interred. The windows on the south side contain figures in stained glass:—commencing eastward the subjects are—St. Christopher, Count Horne, St. Catherine:—Bishop, Count Horne, St. John, St. Catherine, St. Barbara:—St. John the Baptist, Angel, Count Horne, Joseph of Arimathea, and the dead Saviour, St. Anne, Angel, Countess Horne:—Bishop, Countess Horne, St. James, with armorial bearings of the family of Horne. Several of these figures are old, the rest are modern, executed by Mr. D. Evans, after designs by P. Corbet, Esq., of this town. Underneath which is a rich Gothic monument to Master Wigram.\n\np. 80MAN KNOWETH NOT HIS TIME.\n\nAT THE WEST SIDE OF THIS CHURCHYARD ARE INTERRED THE\n\nMORTAL REMAINS OF\n\nHEATHCOTE WIGRAM,\n\nSECOND SON OF MONEY WIGRAM, ESQ. AND MARY HIS WIFE,\n\nOF WOODHOUSE, IN THE COUNTY OF ESSEX,\n\nHE WAS A PUPIL IN THE ROYAL FREE GRAMMAR SCHOOL OF\n\nTHIS TOWN AND WAS DROWNED WHILE BATHING IN THE SEVERN\n\nSEPTEMBER I, MDCCCXXXVIII, AGED XIV YEARS.\n\nTHE CONDUCT OF THIS AMIABLE YOUTH HAD GREATLY ENDEARED\n\nHIM TO HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS\n\nHIS NATURAL TALENTS IMPROVED BY SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION\n\nHAD ALREADY GIVEN PROMISE OF FUTURE EXCELLENCE\n\nWHEN HIS HEAVENLY FATHER CALLED HIM AWAY FROM THIS\n\nEARTHLY STATE OF TRIAL\n\nFOR THE EYES OF THE LORD ARE UPON THEM THAT FEAR HIM\n\nAND HOPE IN HIS MERCY TO DELIVER THEIR SOUL FROM DEATH.\n\nTHIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY HIS MASTERS AND\n\nSCHOOL-FELLOWS\n\nTO THE MEMORY OF HIM WHOM THEY LOVED AND LAMENTED\n\nAND FOR THE CONTINUAL ADMONITION OF THE YOUNG IN THIS\n\nCONGREGATION THAT THEY—\n\nREMEMBER NOW THEIR CREATOR IN THE DAYS OF THEIR YOUTH.\n\nAgainst the east wall are large gothic monuments to John Jeudwine Esq. and Thomas Sutton, Esq. and between them is the statue erected by his pupils, at a cost of eight hundred guineas, to the memory of the late Bishop Butler. The figure is full-length, clothed in the Episcopal robes, sitting in an easy and graceful attitude; the right hand hanging over the chair, and the left supporting the head, which is leaning in thought. It is of pure white p. 81Carrara marble, and was sculptured by F. H. Baily, Esq. R.A. The pedestal which supports the statue is of dove-coloured marble from the Clee Hill, and bears the inscription below:—\n\nSAMVELI BUTLER, S.T.P. R.S.S.\n\nEPISCOPO LICHFIELDENSI\n\nPRAESVLI PIO DILIGENTI DESIDERATO\n\nPRAECEPTORI IN PRIMIS DOCTO AC SOLLERTI\n\nCVIVS FAVSTIS ADMINISTRATA CONSILIIS\n\nSCHOLA REGIA SALOPIENSIS\n\nLITERARVM STVDIIS LAVDEM OMNEM SVPERGRESSA EST\n\nDISCIPVLI MVNICIPES AMICI ET FAVTORES EIVS\n\nVIRO EGREGIE MERITO\n\nHONORIS EXEMPLIQVE CAVSA POSVERVNT\n\nA.S. MDCCCXLIV.\n\np. 82Dispersed in various parts of the edifice will be found many monuments of modern date, some of which bear elegant inscriptions.\n\nThe northernmost of the windows immediately above, is filled with stained glass representing our Blessed Saviour receiving young children, and figures of Charlemagne and Edgar below, and in the window adjoining, is the Adoration of the Magi, and figures of Alfred and David below, the latter the gift of Daniel Rowland, Esq. brother of the late Incumbent.\n\nOn the exterior western wall of the tower are some quaint verses, recording the death of Robert Cadman, who, on 2nd February, 1739, rashly attempted to slide down on his breast along a rope, extended from the summit of the spire to the opposite side of the river. The rope being drawn too tight snapped asunder as he was passing over the Dominican Friars, and he fell lifeless on the ice-bound earth.\n\nOn the south-west side of the church-yard lies Lieutenant Thomas Anderson, one of the last persons executed for adherence to the Stuart family. He was tried at Worcester for desertion, and shot here on 11th December, 1759.\n\nOn the west side, “grav’d in the hollow ground,” close to the tomb of the Rev. J. B. Blakeway, also repose the ashes of that amiable man, and indefatigable p. 83antiquary, Mr. David Parkes, who died 8th May, 1833, of whom there is a mural tablet in the Trinity Chapel. And also on the north-east side, those of the late zealous incumbent, the Rev. J. O. Hopkins, M.A. over which is a stone bearing the following inscription:—\n\nJOHN OLIVER HOPKINS, M.A.\n\nINCUMBENT OF THIS CHURCH, DIED AUGUST 1ST, 1853,\n\nIN HIS 43RD YEAR.\n\n“BE YE ALSO READY FOR IN SUCH AN HOUR AS YE THINK NOT,\n\nTHE SON OF MAN COMETH.”—MATT. XXIV. 44.\n\nWestward of the church-yard are\n\nST. MARY’S ALMSHOUSES,\n\nthe safe asylum of feeble age and decent poverty. This foundation arose from the benevolence of the Worshipful Company of Drapers of this town, at a very early period; and was remodelled during the wardenship, of that company, of Degory Watur, a worthy burgess and draper of Shrewsbury, in the days of Henry IV., who, is believed (though whether on sufficient grounds is uncertain,) to have charitably devoted a portion of his substance to the erection and endowment of an almshouse, for thirteen poor persons of both sexes. This beneficent man is said to have “dwellyd in the almeshowse hall amongst the poor,” and a truly affecting sight must it have been to behold the pious old man, white with “the silver livery of advised age,” deprived of sight, and bowed with the weight of ninety-six years, daily accompanying p. 84the participators of his bounty to St. Mary’s church, where he “wold kneele amongst them in a fayre longe pewe made for them and hym selfe,” and offer up the grateful incense of thanksgiving to that Eternal Being, with whom there is no respect of persons. The good Degory\n\n“Even in the downfall of his mellowed years,\n\nWhen Nature brought him to the door of death,”\n\nforgot not the objects of his charity, but in his will, dated on the day of his decease, 28th July, 1477, devised certain lands to the Wardens of the Drapers’ Company to “sufficientlie susteyne poore people in St. Mary Allmeshowse.” Other charitable individuals made subsequent additions to the endowment.\n\nThe almshouses originally stood within the churchyard, and were confined, unwholesome, and highly incommodious to the thoroughfare. In 1825 they were entirely removed, and the present comfortable habitations erected on the opposite side of the street, by the Drapers’ Company, at an expense of nearly £3000. The houses are sixteen in number, and the inmates, who must be parishioners of St. Mary’s, are appointed by the Drapers’ Company, and supported by them, at an annual expense of upwards of £100.\n\nIn an ancient timber house in the south-west corner of the church-yard, is\n\np. 85THE DRAPERS’ HALL.\n\nThis curious and spacious apartment retains many features of the good old fashioned days. Elevated on a dais, “richlie dyghte withe blazon’d tyle,” stands the massive oaken table at which the Company hold their meetings, and below at right angles, is another table, which in former times was wont to groan beneath the solid cheer, with which the worthy drapers feasted their tenants and dependents. A rudely carved muniment chest occupies the lower end, and portraits of the excellent Degory Watur and his spouse, and of King Edward IV. “The Royal Founder of their Companie,” decorate the dark and gloomy wainscot.\n\nThe Drapers were incorporated by Charters of Edward IV. and James I. and their Company is recognized by several subsequent Acts of Parliament. Seven years’ apprenticeship to a member of the company is the necessary qualification for admission, though foreigners may be admitted on payment of a fine, at the discretion of the company. Their income, which chiefly arises from lands originally purchased by the voluntary contributions of the members, is considerable, and is expended in the support of the inmates of St. Mary’s Almshouse, in liberal subscriptions to the charitable institutions of the town, and in relief to the widows and families of deceased members.\n\np. 86The traffic in Welsh woollen-cloths, the staple trade of the place during three centuries, is now very inconsiderable, the market formerly held here every Thursday having been long since removed to Welshpool and Newtown in Montgomeryshire.\n\nThe next object which demands our attention is\n\nTHE SALOP INFIRMARY. [86]\n\n“Here all have kindness, most relief—for some\n\nIs cure complete,—it is the Suffers’ Home.”\n\np. 87This excellent institution was established in 1747, for the humane purpose of affording skilful medical assistance to the suffering poor, and is most munificently supported by the voluntary subscriptions and benefactions of the county. According to the last report the total number of persons who have received the benefit of this useful charity since its commencement, are,—In-patients 65204; whereof 32298 have been cured, and 25156 relieved; Out-patients 138039, of whom 98376 have been cured, and 24700 relieved. The yearly number of patients is 1277 in-patients, and 4835 out-patients. Several of the physicians and surgeons of the town most humanely afford their valuable advice and skill gratuitously; and in order that medical aid may always be ready in cases of emergency, a surgeon, retained at a salary, is constantly resident in the house. The pecuniary and ordinary concerns of the institution are superintended by a board of directors, consisting of eight trustees, the deputy treasurer, and secretary. The domestic economy is regulated by a matron. Two of the subscribers, weekly attend as house-visitors. The Chaplain the Rev. J. Lewis reads prayers daily and visits the sick in the wards. A treasurer is also annually appointed, who, on the anniversary day in the Hunt week, is accompanied to church by the subscribers and patrons of the charity, where, after a sermon, a collection is made in aid of the funds; the plates on this occasion, being held by two ladies and two gentlemen of rank or opulence.\n\np. 88The house surgeon is allowed to take three pupils at a premium of 20 Guineas to himself, and 200 Guineas to the Infirmary, which entitles the pupil to board and residence for five years. Attendance at this hospital is recognized by the Royal College of Surgeons, and the Apothecaries’ Company, London.\n\nThere is a Library of about 3000 volumes, to which the best new medical works are yearly added by purchase.\n\nThe present building was erected in 1830, on the site of the Old Infirmary, after a design by Mr. Haycock, of this town, at an expense of £18,735 18s. 10d. of which £12,994 1s. 3d. was raised by subscription, and the remainder disbursed from the funded property of the charity.\n\nIt is constructed of freestone, in the Grecian style, is 170 feet in length by 80 feet in height, and has a handsome portico in the centre, supported by Doric pillars. The disposition of the interior is adequate to the accommodation of from 150 to 160 in-patients, and comprises four stories. The various offices, in number twenty-two, are arranged in the basement; the ground floor is appropriated to the board-room, dispensary, rooms for the admission of patients, the house-surgeon and matron’s apartments, and two wards for surgical cases; the first floor has seven wards for male patients, with p. 89day-room, scullery, and baths; the upper story contains a spacious operation room, with wards for female patients on each side; and in the attics are four other wards, with nurses’ rooms, &c. A staircase, at either end, communicates with spacious galleries extending the length of each story. A proper ventilation is kept up through the whole structure, and an uniform temperature preserved by a patent hot-water apparatus, which likewise affords a constant supply of warm water. The walls of the board-room are decorated with the portraits of Sir Rowland Hill, Bart., General Lord Hill, and Lord Clive, the armorial bearings of the successive treasurers, and the tables of benefactions.\n\nThe spacious terrace on the eastern side, commands an extensive view of unequalled richness and beauty. The eye, after dwelling on the nearer objects of the rugged declivities of the Castle Mount,—the Railway Viaduct over the Severn,—the majestic ruins of the Abbey,—the stately grandeur of the White Hall,—the elegant Column,—and the venerable church of St. Giles—wanders uninterruptedly over an extensive tract of fertile and finely wooded country, bounded by the long ridge of Haughmond Hill, the Wr"
