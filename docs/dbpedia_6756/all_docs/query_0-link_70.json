        "text": "In a powerful new account of Japan’s earthquake and subsequent tsunami, Ghosts of the Tsunami: Death and Life in Japan’s Disaster Zone, Richard Lloyd Parry, author and Asia Editor for The Times of London, focuses in on the tragedy at one small coastal school, Okawa Elementary School, where 74 out of 108 children and 10 out of 13 teachers died during the tsunami. In Ghosts of the Tsunami, named one of the best books of 2017 by The Guardian, NPR, GQ, The Economist and Bookforum, Richard Lloyd Parry explores exactly what happened at the school that led to the failed evacuation, and how the nation struggled to find consolation.\n\nDisasters and History offers the first comprehensive historical overview of hazards and disasters. Drawing on a range of case studies, including the Black Death, the Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and the Fukushima disaster, the authors examine how societies dealt with shocks and hazards and their potentially disastrous outcomes. They reveal the ways in which the consequences and outcomes of these disasters varied widely not only between societies but also within the same societies according to social groups, ethnicity and gender. They also demonstrate how studying past disasters, including earthquakes, droughts, floods and epidemics, can provide a lens through which to understand the social, economic and political functioning of past societies and reveal features of a society which may otherwise remain hidden from view.\n\nThis article examines local myth and folklore related to earthquakes, landslides, and tsunamis in oral traditions from Cascadia (part of the northern Pacific coast of North America) and in written traditions from Japan, particularly in the Edo (present-day Tokyo) region. Local folklore corresponds closely to geological evidence and geological events in at least some cases, and the symbolic language of myth and folklore can be a useful supplement to conventional geological evidence for constructing an accurate historical record of geological activity. At a deep, archetypical level, Japan, Cascadia, and many of the world&#39;s cultures appear to share similar themes in their conception of earthquakes. Although folklore from Cascadia is fragmentary, and the written record short, the evolution of Japanese earthquake folklore has been well documented over a long period of history and illustrates the interaction of folklore with dynamic social conditions."
