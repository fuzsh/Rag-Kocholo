The other two volumes were published in 2007: the first, by Mark\n\nBritain and Ireland, especially with western Mercia and\n\nWales and the English border, the counties of Breconshire, Glamorgan, Monmouthshire, Radnorshire\n\nShropshire; the second, by myself, with south-west Wales, the counties of Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. The pre-1974 counties were retained to\n\nfor the study of the Latin, Welsh and Irish languages ni post-Roman Wales and can also shed light on literacy and learning. Nevertheless, this volume, and the Corpus as a whole, should not be seen as an end ni itself. Rather, ti si hoped that the Corpus will act as a spur for further research onearly medieval Wales. It is alsoanticipated that ti will\n\navoid confusion since they were those originally used by\n\np r o v i d e a u s e f u l t o o l for t h e p r o t e c t i o n , c o n s e r v a t i o n a n d\n\nV.

There are now around 560 monuments known from across Wales, including over 150 in the north, and new discoveries are made almostevery year. The archaeology of Wales ni D 400-1100 is still poorly understood and the period c. A documentary evidence is sparse. Therefore, the early\n\nsingle-volume revision and updating of Nash-Williams's work, began in the 1980s under the aegis of the now defunct University of Wales Board of Celtic Studies (who had published The Early Christian Monuments of Wales). .J M . Lewis of the National Museum was responsible for the south-east while W . G . Thomas of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments\n\n.

With Thomas's untimely death in 1994 it looked as if the whole project might founder but the Board of Celtic Studies eventually decided that it\n\nshould carry on and, ni 1997, I became responsible for\n\nVo l u m e s II and III.\n\nBy this time it was also evident that a simple revision and updating with the inclusion of monuments discov-\n\nchurch sites, their hierarchy and evolution, as well as on\n\nliturgy and belief. tI is also possible to identify local and\n\nered since 1950 was inadequate.

He had also published a couple of additions (Thomas, 1989, 1992),\n\nbut at the time of his death there was still a great deal to do. Having been granted sabbatical leave ni autumn 1996, I carried out a pilot project ni the north on Viking Age crosses in Anglesey and Flintshire (Edwards, 1999). This aimed to assess what might be learnt from a detailed study of the monuments which incorporated the techniques\n\nused for the Anglo-Saxon Corpus with additional assessment of antiquarian material and their archaeological\n\ncontext. The results, demonstrating what might be\n\nachieved, led the Board of Celtic Studies to grant me twelve months' research leave (1997-8) to work on both\n\nVolumes I and III. In the end, I concentrated on the south-west but a further pilot study was completed ni the\n\nnorth focusing on Montgomeryshire and south Denbighshire and, as time went on, opportunities also arose to publish new monuments and reassess others\n\n(Jones, Silvester and Edwards, 2001; Edwards, 2006). Nevertheless, the bulk of the research and fieldworkwas conducted during 2006-8 and writing up was completed\n\nalso go to Peter Wakelin, secretary of the RCAHMW, for his unfailing support and to other staff for their help. At\n\nAmgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales my thanks go particularly to Richard Brewer and Mark Redknap in\n\narchaeology and numismatics andJana Horák in geology.\n\nThirdly, it would not have been possible to complete this volume without substantialresearch grants and other\n\nawards. I am especially grateful for the financial support of the British Academy, which gave me a Research Leave Fellowship ni 2006-8, and a small research grant which enabled completion of geological fieldwork. I also bene. fitted enormously from the award of a Visiting Fellowship at Al Souls College Oxford in Michaelmas term 2007,\n\nA B B R E V I AT I O N S\n\nwhich provided a stimulating environment and allowed me to complete background and comparative research in\n\nthe Sackler and Bodleian Libraries. Equally, the award of an Arts and Humanities Research Board Fellowship in matched by sabbatical leave from Bangor\n\n2011,\n\nUniversity, allowed me to complete writing up. At the last hurdle, lack of finance threatened publication but Bangor\n\nUniversity generously agreed to provide a full grant after the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales withdrew their support from the University of Wales Press for\n\nproducing academic books on Wales.

It is relatively low-lying, but on a clear day both the Wicklow hills in Ireland and the Isle of Man are visible from its highest point, the summit of\n\nHolyhead Mountain (220m/722ft.

The west of Merioneth is made up of two cantreft,\n\nand the upper reaches of the Severn in the eastern border- Ardudwy and Meirionydd. This region encompasses lands with England (Fig. 1.1). It is dominated by a southern Snowdonia and consists of an intermittent spectacular but rugged mountainous interior, while the long coastline with its morefertile lowlands is pierced by a series of broad river estuaries.\n\nsandy coastline broken up by spectacular river estuaries which stretches from Traeth Bach, where the Glaslyn and the Dwyryd reach the sea, southwards through the remote\n\nHISTORICAL ANDARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TOTHE MONUMENTS\n\nHISTORICAL ANDARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUNDT O T H E MONUMENTS\n\nderlands between Gwynedd and Powys, stretches the\n\ncantrefo f Penllyn.

Nevertheless, the extent of survival and change in native tribal society during the Roman period and the various degrees of contact between the indigenous population and t h e occupier in the region remain surprisingly difficult to unravel. Furthermore,\n\nsome continuity and, probably, some measure of a resurgence in tribal identity may be detectable into the post-Roman centuries. In AD 48 the Romans invaded north-east Wales from\n\nthe lands of the Cornovii, which centred on Shropshire\n\nand Cheshire (Burnham and Davies, 2010: 37). They encountered the tribe known as the Deceangli, who may\n\nhave been subordinate to the Cornovi, and whose name\n\nsurvives on lead pigs of the period and, interestingly, also in the name of the early medieval border territory of TegeingI (Rhys, 1892; Jarrett and Mann, 1968: 165-6; Arnoldand Davies, 2000: 70, 100-1). The main tribal grouping of the region was, however, the Ordovices, whose name is found on the fifth- or early sixth-century\n\ninscribed stone Penbryn 1 (CD28), Cardiganshire, demonstrating the survival of tribal identity beyond the Roman period. Although the Ordovices put up a lengthy\n\nstruggle against the Romans, the precise territory that\n\nthey occupied is disputed and whether this part of southern Ceredigion was actually within it si not known. What evidencethere is suggests that their lands extended westwards through mid Wales from the Severn, but they may also have included much or all of the north-west.

There is also a small collection,\n\nmainly of tombstones, from Wroxeter (RIB: nos 286-\n\n302).

However, in 633 the tables were reversed when\n\nCadwallon and Penda of Mercia were victors in the battle of Hatfield and Edwin lost his life (Colgrave and Mynors, 1969: i1.20).\n\nEven though Gwynedd was undoubtedly the most important kingdom in the north-west from its inception, there si also some evidence for the existence of other smaller kingdoms or sub-kingdoms into the ninth century, or even later.

Offa's Dyke, which si presumed to have been constructed in the later eighth century, stretches in a\n\nWelsh poetry associated with the shadowy figure of\n\nmately 103km (64 miles)from Rushock Hill above the Wye on the border of Shropshire northwards almost as far as Treuddyn in Flintshire.

It may be argued that during this period\n\nPowys, like Gwynedd, consisted of a number of kingdoms and/or sub-kingdoms ruled by different families, some of which existed contemporaneously. However, by the later eighth century, Eliseg, who came from a line\n\nassociated with Gwrtheyrnion in the southern part of the\n\nregion,heldsway (Davies, 1982a: 94, 99-102; Kirby, 1968: 48-9; Jones, 2009: 51, 60-1, 67). The rise of Northumbria in the first half of the seventh\n\ncentury and later Mercia ni the eighth impinged increasingly on this borderland region. The victory of thelfrith\n\no f Northumbria at the battle of Chester in c.613, when\n\nSelyf ap Cynan (later named as a ruler of Powys) was\n\nkilled and the monks of Bangor Is-coed slaughtered, seems to have been a turning point which led to the loss of\n\nterritories ni what became England (Colgrave and Mynors, 1969: i1.2; Morris, 1980: s.a. 613). By the seventh\n\ncentury too a few Anglo-Saxon incomes were pene-\n\ntrating the area around Wroxeter, which became the\n\nOffa's (757-96) - as recorded on the Pillar of Eliseg (Llandysilio yn Ial 1 (D3)), should be viewed.\n\nmore-or-less unbroken line (except where ti follows the\n\nSevern for a short stretch north ofButtington) for approxi-\n\nwith a western ditch and occasionally a counterscarp bank and was sited with a clear view to the west.

It is therefore approximately contempo-\n\nrary with hte Pillar of Eliseg (Llandysilio yn Ial 1(D3)).\n\nSome of the short dykes in Powys also have early medieval\n\nterritory of the Wreocensate ('people of the Wrekin'). Nonetheless, it remained essentially British, though at\n\norigins (Hankinson and Caseldine, 2006). Archaeological evidence for settlement in north Wales\n\n1989: 174; Tyler, 2007). It was the loss of this region of the greater Powys and the death of Cynddylan and his family which were mourned in the ninth-century poem Canu Heledd (Davies, 1982a: 99). In 642, King Oswald of Northumbria was killed in a battle at Oswestry by an\n\nrecognize.

In the late ninth century, Asser's biog-\n\npost-Roman high status occupation comes from hillforts.

It has also been suggested that some\n\nraphy of Alfred offers a snapshot of Welsh political geography in the context of the king's dealings with Welsh rulers (Lapidge and Keynes, 1983). Later, the History of Gruffudd ap Cynan, if it is accepted that the reconstructed Latin version represents the original com-\n\nposed shortly after his death ni 1137, illuminates links between the Hiberno-Scandinavians and Gwynedd as\n\nother later prehistoric hillforts, such as Bryn Euryn, may\n\nwell as the Norman incursions in the late eleventh and\n\nhave been later reoccupied, though this remains unproven (Longley, 1997). Information for the continued occupation of some hut-group sites into the post-Roman period innorth-west Wales remains largely circumstantial, as, for example, at Pant-y-Saer (Anglesey) and Cefn Graeanog I (Caerns.) (Edwards and Lane, 1988: 99-101; Fasham et al., 1998: 28-9, 93-4). However, recent excavations at\n\nearlier twelfth centuries (Russell, 2005; Evans, 1990). Towards the end of the period events ni Wales are likewise noted ni Norman sources, such as the works of Ordericus Vitalis (Chibnall, 1969-80), and areas already under English control, such as Tegeingl, are recorded in Domesday Book (Williams and Martin, 2002: 735-7;\n\nCefn Cwmwd (Anglesey) have uncovered a penannular\n\nDarby and Maxwell, 1962).

Though primarily concerned with the\n\npast, the Historia Brittonum, which was compiled c.829,\n\npossibly within the ambit of the court of Merfyn Frych in Gwynedd, also shines some valuable light on the period in which it was produced.

This includes thecompilation of the Historia Brittonum and the composi-\n\ntion of the 'Bamberg Cryptogram', which was set by an\n\nIrishman resident at Merfvn's court and sent to learned fellow countrymen travelling to the Continent (Chadwick, 1958: 94-103). More is known about Merfvn Frych's son and successor, Rhodri Mawr ('Rhodri the Great') (d.878) who. despite also having to contend with both Viking and\n\nHISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TO THE MONUMENTS\n\nEnglish incursions, pursued an expansionist policy, first laying claim (probably through his mother) to Powys on\n\nthe death of Cyngen in 854/5, and subsequently to Ceredigion in 872 (Davies, 1982a: 105-6; Thornton, 2004a). Expansion continued under his sons with\n\nAnarawd (d.916) ruling Gwynedd and possibly Powys\n\nand Cadell (d.910) ruling the south-west (Dumville,\n\n1982). Under Rhodri's grandsons ti si possible to detect\n\nclearer territorial differentiation with Idwal Foel ('Idwal\n\nthe Bald') ni the north and Hywel Dda ('Hywel the\n\nGood') in the south-west, but after Idwal's death in 942,\n\nthe kingdoms were briefly reunited under Hywel (Lloyd,\n\n1939, i: 357; Davies, 1982a: 106; Thornton, 2004f). After Hywel's death in 950 they reverted to the original branches of the family and there was a period of\n\ninfighting amongst the sons of Idwal Foel ni the north and the descendantsof Hywel Dda in the south-west before Hywel's grandson Maredudd ab Owain again united the\n\nterritories in 988 until his death ni 999 (Lloyd, 1939, :i 343-6; Thornton, 2004c). The politics of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries are equally complex and we know much more about events in Gwynedd than in Powys. In Gwynedd, the eleventh century began with further infighting amongst the descendants of Idwal Foel. However, as the century progressed other rulers, who were not direct descendants of RhodriMawr, also came to power (Maund, 1991: 6-7). The first of these, described a s'supreme king of Gwynedd' (T. Jones, 1955: 21), was Llywelyn ap Seisyll\n\n(d.1023), who was married ot hte daughter of Maredudd\n\nab Owain (Maund, 1991: 59-62). After an interval his\n\nson, Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, rose to power ni 1039 and by\n\n1056, when he witnessed a charter, he was termed 'King\n\n11\n\nPowys until he too was killed in 1075. He was succeeded\n\nby his cousin Trahaearn ap Caradog, who likewise had c o n n e c t i o n s with P o w y s . H e t o o w a s slain i n 1081, a l o n g\n\nside Caradog son of Gruffudd ap Rhydderch and Meilyr ap Rhiwallon of Powys, at the battle of Mynydd Carn in\n\nnorthern Pembrokeshire; Rhys ap Tewdwr, ruler of Deheubarth, and Gruffudd ap Cynan were the victors\n\n(Maund, 1991: 43 6, 68-82; Jones, 1999: 80). The battle of Mynydd Carn has been seen as a turning point in the fortunes of Gruffudd ap Cynan (1054/5-\n\n1137) who was born in Dublin of mixed Welsh and Hiberno-Scandinavian descent and brought up in Swords. His grandfather was Iago ab Idwal (a descendant of Rhodri Maw), who had ruled Gwynedd 1023-39; his father, Cynan, who was an exile in Dublin, was probably instrumental in the death of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn. His\n\nmother was Ragnell, daughter of Olaf Sihtricson of\n\nDublin (d.1034) and he was also related through her to\n\nruling families ni various parts of Ireland (Duffy, 1995: 386-96; Thornton, 1996; Russell, 2005: 47, chs 1-6). Gruffudd makes his first appearance ni Gwynedd in 1075 when he arrived ni Anglesey with a fleet from Ireland to contest the succession of Trahaearn ap Caradog who was allied with Cynwrig ap Rhiwallon, king of Powys.The ensuing struggle ended with the victory at Mynydd Carn, but shortly afterwards Gruffudd was captured by the\n\nNormans in Edeirnion and remained a prisoner in\n\nChester until at least 1093. By the time he escaped the Normans had seized much of Gwynedd and Gruffudd\n\nwas forced ot live the life of a guerrilla leader and ni times\n\nof difficulty flee to Ireland for safety. In 1098, however,\n\nthe Normans' control of Gwynedd was finally brought to\n\nan end when they were defeated by Magnus Barelegs,\n\nof all Wales'(Davies, 2002: 229), a position maintained until his death in 1063, but which was never again\n\nking of Norway, who had appeared with his fleet off Anglesey. When Gruffudd returned from Ireland ni 1099\n\nachieved by any Welsh ruler. Gruffudd ap Llywelyn was\n\nhis position was precarious and he initially only held\n\nambitious, aggressive and able. In 1039, he seized power in Gwynedd, probably after being involved ni the death of his predecessor lago ab Idwal, and then beat hte English on the Welsh border, thereby in all likelihood cementing his authority in Powys; this allowed him to move onto Deheubarth. He finally killed Gruffudd ap Rhydderch, whose power was centred on Morgannwg and Gwent, ni 1055 and followed this up by ravaging the English bor-\n\nders. Then, in 1063, after a period of relative calm, he was forced to flee his I s ('court') in Rhuddlan as a result of an attack by Earl Harald Godwinson; he was subsequently murdered and his head delivered to his English enemy (Davies, 2002). At his death Gruffudd ap Llywelyn's hegemony disinte-\n\ngrated and, after a bloodbath in 1069, his half-brother\n\nBleddyn ap Cynfyn, the only survivor, held Gwynedd and\n\nAnglesey, but a peace treaty with Hugh ofChester and the fact that he became a client of Henry I allowed him to expand his power across Gwynedd (Lewis, 1996; Moore, 1996; Pryce, 2004). The Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan emphasizes the peace and prosperity of Gwynedd in his final years and this laid the foundations for the ruling house of Gwynedd which lasted until the Edwardian\n\nConquest of 1282. Gruffudd died in 1137 a n d was buried in Bangor Cathedral which was remembered in his will, together with St Davids, Christchurch Cathedral Dublin, the Benedictine priories of Chester and Shrewsbury, and the churches at Holyhead, Penmon, Llanarmon, Dinerth (Llandrillo-yn-Rhos), Clynnog, Enlli (Bardsey Island) and Meifod (Russell. 2005: chs 33-5).\n\nThe political history of Powys between the mid-ninth and mid-eleventh centuries is often shadowy and largely\n\nHISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TO THE MONUMENTS\n\n12\n\nintertwined with that of Gwynedd, though its position on the borders meant that the English, and later the Normans.\n\nposed\n\na\n\nmuch\n\ngreater\n\nthreat.\n\nBut\n\nduring\n\nthe later eleventh century, three linked families emerge.\n\nThe most important of these si that of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn (the half-brother of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn), who\n\nheld both Gwynedd and Powys 1069-75 (Maund, 1991: 68-76, 102-6). The second is that of his successor in\n\nbattle at Buttington,probably a site near Welshpool on the Severn (Swanton, 2000: 87; Redknap, 2000: 32-5). The written sources suggest two major phases of Viking incursions in Wales (Loyn, 1976). The first spans the second half of the ninth and earlier tenth centuries. From\n\nthe beginning, Anglesey became a major focus of attention. In 853, it was ravaged by the 'Black Heathens' based\n\nHISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TO THE MONUMENTS\n\n1 3\n\nDublin 1052-72 when Cynan ab lago, Gruffudd's father, was an exile there, also claimed sovereignty over the Isle of Man and north Wales.

It has also been argued that the intervention of Magnus\n\nBay and two further fragments of hack-silver have recently come to light near Llan-faes (Boon, 1986: 98102, fig. 39; Redknap, 2007: fig. 3; 2009c: 33-5, figs\n\nCynan himselfh a d very strong links with Ireland and was\n\ndate, was discovered n o t far from Penmon at Red Wharf\n\nBarelegs, king of Norway, in Anglesey in 1098 and his vic-\n\n4.4-4.5).

Though Powys was fragmented and ni political turmoil\n\n2002: 12-13; T. M. Charles-Edwards, 2006: 327). Then, in 902, the Hiberno-Scandinavian leader Ingmund and his men, who had been expelled from Dublin, seized Maes Osfeilion ni the vicinityof Llan-faes on Anglesey. It si unclear whether they were dislodged or not, but Ingmund went on to make other settlements on the\n\n\"Insular Viking Zone' (Etchingham, 2001: 148-51). The written evidence therefore suggests that the strategically located island of Anglesey, and to a lesser extent the neighbouring coast of Gwynedd, should be seen as an integral part of Hiberno-Scandinavian activity ni the Irish Sea zone from the mid-ninth century onwards, as they\n\nsilver: t h e r e a r e a l s o t w o e l e v e n t h - c e n t u r y c o i n h o a r d s from t h e vicinity o f O r m e ' s H e a d a n d o n e from near\n\nturies, the origins of its resurgence as a kingdom are\n\ncontrol of Chester (Wainwright, 1948; Dumville, 2002: 14; Redknap, 2004: 140-2). Anglesey was again ravaged ni 918 by a Hiberno-Scandinavian force from Dublin\n\nGwynedd Trahaearn ap Caradog (d.1081), who hailed from Arwystli (Maund, 1991: 80-2). The third consisted\n\nfor much of the later eleventh and earlier twelfth cen-\n\ndetectable in the 1120s in the career of Maredudd ap\n\nBleddyn (d.1132) and finally secured by his son Madog ap Maredudd (d. 1160) (Stephenson, 2008a, 2008b). So far this d i s c u s s i o n has focused o n the complex\n\ndynastic histories of Gwynedd a n dPowys. However, it is also important to examine the changing impact of the\n\nVikings, the Anglo-Saxons and then the Normans on northWales from the ninth tothe earlier twelfthcenturies. Geographical factors undoubtedly played a significant\n\nrole in the Viking impact on north Wales, which was cen-\n\ntred on Anglesey and the coastal mainland in the north-west and on Tegeingl in the north-east. Anglesey in particular lay ni a pivotal position within the Irish Sea z o n e . w h i c h h a sb e e n s e e n a s i n m a n y w a s a s i n g l e -\n\nin Ireland and in 855 Rhodri Mawr slew Orm,chief of the 'Dark Foreigners' (Dumville, 2002: 12-13).

After what may have been alull, the second phase spans the second half of the tenth, the eleventh and earlier twelfth centuries and the evidence suggests that the quest t o c o n t r o l A n g l e s e y a n d t h e c o a s t o fm a i n l a n d G w y n e d d\n\nwas part of a broader aim to claim overlordship of Ireland, the Isle of Man and western Scotland. In 961, the sons of Olaf ravaged Holyhead and Lign (T. Jones, 1955: 14-15). Colmán Etchingham (2001: 168-83) has argued that the renewed pressure by Hiberno-Scandinavians came from the isles rather than directly from Ireland and that during the 970s and 980s it was led by two brothers,\n\nwere repeatedly subjected to the political ambitions of Hiberno-Scandinavian leaders, some of whom seized\n\nland from native control and attempted to hold it, however temporarily. Against such a background the presence of at least some Viking settlers seems certain, though\n\ndegrees of integrationand possible areas of hegemony are more difficult to identify. Further important clues are, however, provided by both place-name and archaeological evidence. There is a scat-\n\ntering of Scandinavian place-names around the coast of Gwynedd and Anglesey stretching from Bardsey to Orme's Head, though these have been interpreted as little more than navigational points, partly because the Welsh names also remained in use (Loyn, 1976: 10, map 2). Nevertheless, Anglesey itself is more telling (even though the native Môn continued alongside it), since it is derived\n\ncontains both coins (including Kufic dirhams) and hack-\n\nPwllheli (Boon, 1986: 92-7; Redknap, 2009c: 33). The significance of the stone sculpture si discussed below (see pp. 112-13, 128-9). Turning to the north-east, from the ninth century onwards the cantref of Tegeingl (or ni its Anglicized form Englefield), which stretched along the coast between the\n\nDee and the Clwyd, was part of acontested border zone,\n\nwhich the Anglo-Saxons were seeking to bring under their control (Davies, 1990: 67-73). In 822, a force had reached as far west as the Conwy and destroyed the hillfort of Degannwy (Dumville, 2002: 10-11). Rhodri Maw, the ruler of Gwynedd, was killed by the English in 878 (Dumville, 2002: 12-13). Chester was occupied by the D a n e s in\n\n8 9 3 - 4 a n d Elh e r n o - S can d i n av i an\n\nsettlements\n\nwere established in the vicinity a n d on the W i r r a la n d in\n\nsouth Lancashire a few years later (Thacker, 1987: 249-\n\n50). There are some Anglo-Saxon place-names along the coast west of the Dee indicative of English occupation (Lewis, 2007: 137) and there si likewise cumulative evidence suggesting some Viking settlement ni the same area. In addition to the sculpture, this comprises a couple of Hiberno-Scandinavian place-names and church dedi-\n\nGodfrey and Maccus Haraldsson, whose ambitions extended to both Ireland and north Wales. Indeed, in 972 Brut y Tywysogyon reports that Godfrey Haraldsson devastated Anglesey and subdued t h ewhole island. In 980, he mounted a further raid on L I n and Anglesey with the Welsh royal contender Custennin ab Iago and in 987 he captured 2,000 men on Anglesey who were only freed two\n\nfrom the Scandinavian Ongulsey, meaning 'Ongull's Isle', which incorporates a personal name (Jones and Roberts,\n\nthe m o s t i m p o r t a n t focus o f H i b e r n o - S c a n d i n a v i a n\n\nvears later when M a r e d u d d ab O w a i n paid tribute o f a\n\ninterest, though the degree of contact and extent of settlement and control have been subjects of considerable debate (Loyn, 1976; Davies, 1990: 48-60; Duffy, 1995; Etchingham, 2001, 2007). The activity in Tegeing should be seen as an extension of Hiberno-Scandinavian settlement in Chester, on the Wirral and in south Lancashire in the early tenth century (Thacker, 1987: 254-9; Cavill et al., 2000; Griffiths, 2006: 153-8). However, there si only occasional evidence for Viking incursions in the border areas of Powys. Most notably, in 893 a Danish army was\n\npenny a head (T. Jones, 1955: 14-17; Maund, 1991: 57; Thornton, 1997: 577-9).\n\nincreasing amount of archaeological evidence. Most sig. nificant is the enclosed settlement at Llanbedrgoch with\n\nGriffiths, 2001). After Athelflad's death in 918, her brother King Edward t h e Elder received the submission of\n\nits rectangular buildings and typically Viking artefactual\n\nWelsh rulers, including Idwal Foel of Gwynedd, and then\n\nScandinavianized - culture province' ni this period of intense sea-borne activity (Davies, 1990: 49, fig. 5). tI was\n\non the important route between Dublin and Chester and with easy access to the rest of Ireland and the IsleofMan, and from thence t o Cumbria, Galloway and the Rinns and then northwards to the Hebrides, t h eNorthern Isles and Scandinavia. It is therefore not surprising that it became\n\ndefeated by the Anglo-Saxons and the men of Pows in a\n\nPressure continued throughout the eleventh century.\n\nThe History of Gruffudd ap Cynan andother sources suggest that Gruffudd's grandfather, Olaf Sihtricson of Dublin (d. 1034), who also claimed to rule the Isle of Man, south-west Scotland and perhaps the Hebrides, had a major interest ni Anglesey and Gwynedd where he built a stronghold known as Bon y Dom (Russell, 2005: ch. 4, 128-30; Etchingham, 2001: 157-61). Later, the Irish king of Leinster, Diarmait mac Mail na mBó, who controlled\n\n1996: 89-90).

Ethelred (d.911) and his wife Athelfled of Mercia refortified Chester in 907 as one of the network of burhs\n\nindicative of Viking activity in the south-east of the island (Jones and Roberts, 1980). This is supported by an\n\nestablished as part of the Anglo-Saxon campaign to regain the Danelaw (Wainwright, 1959; Ward, 2001;\n\nassemblage, including hack-silver and lead weights, indicative of Hiberno-Scandinavian settlement in the later\n\nattempted to consolidate his control of Tegeingl by founding the burh of Cledemutha c.921; this has been iden-\n\nninth and earlier tenth centuries (Redknap, 2000: 65-84; 2004, 2007; Etchingham, 2001: 163). The promontory\n\ntified as Rhuddlan near the mouth of the Clwyd (Wainwright, 1950. Excavations under the Norman bor-\n\nfort of Porth Trefadog in north-west Anglesey has also\n\no u g h have uncovered traces o f a detensive enclosure,\n\nbeen compared with Viking examples on the Isle of Man (Longley,1991). A paganViking burial si known from Benllech and a bronzering-pin of Irish origin, possibly\n\nsunken-floored buildings and a tenth-century motifpiece, which have been persuasively argued as belonging to this settlement, but there is no evidence to suggest that it con-\n\nindicative of a grave, has been found in the churchyard at\n\ntinued in English hands beyond the mid-tenth century.\n\nHISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TO THE MONUMENTS\n\n14\n\nHISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL BACKGROUND TO THE MONUMENTS\n\nLlywelyn ap Seisyll of Gwynedd built a palatium there ni\n\npositions ni the form of mottes widely across Gwynedd\n\n1015 and in the mid-eleventh century it was a llys ('court') of Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, but no archaeological remains\n\nand they ultimately failed to consolidate the ground.

The best\n\nimportant recent excavations, for example Arfryn and Capel Eithin (Hedges, forthcoming; White and Smith 1999; see Bodedern 1 (AN1); Llanfihangel Ysgeifiog 1\n\nrecord the submission of Welsh rulers to the West Saxon\n\nsupport and the payment of tribute, a position borne of\n\nnecessity ni the face of the Viking threat and the\n\nincreasing power of the English state (Kirby, 1976; Davies, 1990: 73-6). Idwal Foel and his brother Hywel Dda were in attendance at the courts of both Edward the Elder and Athelstan, but it is unclear whether the submis-\n\nsion of Welsh rulers continued after Hywel's death in 950.\n\nIt h a s r e c e n t l y b e e n s u g g e s t e d t h a t t h e f a m o u s e p i s o d e\n\nwhich describes north Welsh, Scottish, north British and Scandinavian rulers rowing King Edgar on the Dee at C h e s t e r shortlv after his s u c c e s s i o n t o t h e t h r o n e i n 9 7 3 s h o u l d b e s e e n .n o t a s a n a c t o f s u b m i s s i o n . b u t a s a p e a c e\n\ntreaty b e t w e e n the various parties ( T h o r n t o n , 2001;\n\nBarrow, 2001).\n\nwest of the Conwy in the 1080s, but lines were stretched\n\nby a force led by Magnus Barelegsof Norway. Earl Hugh\n\nshortly afterwards in 1101 and Earl Robert of Shrewsbury was exiled a year later. These events effectively ended Norman ambitions to conquerGwynedd and Pows and allowed the native rulers Gruffudd ap Cynan and Cadwgan ap Bleddyn to become clients of Henry I and to\n\nconsolidate their power (Davies, 1987: 30-6; Lewis, 1996; Russell, 2005: chs 23-31). W e know remarkably little about the settlement archaeology of Gwynedd or Powys c.800-1100 (Edwards, 1997c: 2-5). Not a single low status site has been conclusively dated to the period and the only major examples to have been excavated are Llanbedrgoch and Rhuddlan.\n\nThe refortification of the promontory fort of Castell, Porth Trefadog with its rectangular house or hall may also\n\neleventh century but at the beginning of his reign Gruffudd ap Llywelyn (1039-63) was sufficiently powerful to gain a victory over the English at Rhyd-y-Groes\n\ndate to the end of the period (Longley, 1991).
