He was the son of Edward Haycock and Mary Hatton Hincksman. He came from a family of architects, but William seems to have found an occupation as a solicitor.\n\nHe married Anne Marie Parker in Maidstone, Kent in 1859.[1] They had possibly 6 children.\n\nRalph Hine Haycock 1860–Deceased • m. Margaret Parker\n\nTrevitt Reginald Hine Haycock 1862–Deceased • m. Grace J Thornton\n\nReginald Haycock 1864–Deceased • absent 1871 and 1881 censuses\n\nAdelaide Mary Trevar Hine Haycock 1867–Deceased • d. unmarried\n\nArchibald Leslie Hine Haycock 1870–Deceased • m. Alexa Maud Petherick\n\nVaughan Randolph Hine Haycock 1871–1937 • m. Grace Mary Vaughan- Arbuckle\n\nThey lived in Little Heath, Charlton-by-Sunbury, London.[2][3]\n\nBy 1881 the family lived in Sidmouth, Devon. William is described as a solicitor not in active practice. The family were well to do, with 5 servants.[4]\n\nIn 1901 he and his wife were living in Church Street, Chelsea with unmarried daughter Adelaide. They still had enough wealth to live comfortably and employ 3 servants, without any income.[5]\n\nHe passed away in 1903, probably in Chelsea,[6] and is buried in West Brompton Cemetery, Kensington & Chelsea. His widow passed away in 1911 and is buried in the same place.\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #222087548\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"British Newspaper Archive, Family Notices,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:QLSW-2WK7 : 18 April 2019), William Hine Haycock, Maidstone, Kent, England, United Kingdom; records extracted FamilySearch and images digitized by FindMyPast; citing Maidstone, Kent, England, United Kingdom, 7 May 1859, The British Newspaper Archive, Ireland; FHL microfilm .\n\n↑ Birth records for Adelaide 1867, Archibald 1870 and Vaughan 1871 give same location, confirmed by 1871 census (residence) and 1881 census (birth locations)\n\n↑ \"England and Wales Census, 1871\", database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VB67-QJY : 25 June 2022), William Hine Haycock, 1871.\n\n↑ \"England and Wales Census, 1881,\" database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:Q276-G8BV : 12 December 2017), William Hine Haycock, Sidmouth, Devon, England; from \"1881 England, Scotland and Wales Census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing p. 9, Piece/Folio 2136/8, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey; FHL microfilm 101,774,762.\n\n↑ \"England and Wales Census, 1901,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X942-RVX : 20 May 2019), William Hine-Haycock, Chelsea, London, England, United Kingdom; from \"1901 England, Scotland and Wales census,\" database and images, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : n.d.); citing Chelsea North subdistrict, PRO RG 13, The National Archives, Kew, Surrey.\n\n↑ \"England and Wales Death Registration Index 1837-2007,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2N5F-D1Z : 31 December 2014), William Hine Haycock, 1903; from \"England & Wales Deaths, 1837-2006,\" database, findmypast (http://www.findmypast.com : 2012); citing Death, Chelsea, London, England, General Register Office, Southport, England.\n\nfrom family history work done by William Hine-Haycock, Kittery Quay, Kingswear - 1989\n\nadditional sourcing from https://www.familysearch.org/tree/person/details/L1PJ-GSP\n\nResearch Notes\n\nWas he born Hine-Haycock (his siblings all seem to just be Haycock) or did he adopt it at some point later in life? The only record on which it is hyphenated is the 1901 census, although it should be noted his wife had adopted it and all his children bore it, albeit unhyphenated, in the 1881 census whereas in the 1871 census it only appeared once as William's middle name. Theory: some time between 1871 and 1881 William made a legal application to change his surname and that of his family from Haycock to Hine-Haycock."
