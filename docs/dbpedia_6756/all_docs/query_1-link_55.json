        "text": "The area known as Old Town which spreads up the hill and overlooks the harbour is what remains of the old town of Barmouth. Before the middle of the 19th century the whole town consisted of buildings of this more traditional style. The lanes that crawl up from the town's main streets in a most haphazard way will soon have you gazing down over the town, the estuary and the bay in just a few minutes (give or take a few breathers!)\n\nContinue up beyond the cottages and you will eventually come to the National Trust Information Board and this explains that the area you stand in, Dinas Oleu, was the first parcel of land to be given to the then newly formed Trust by Mrs. Fanny Talbot\n\nAmong the cottages in Old Town are several that were given, for a consideration of Â£1000, by Fanny Talbot to John Ruskin and his Guild of St. George in 1874. These were to house the poor as part of Ruskin's social experiment, outlined in his Fors Clavigera, that aimed to prevent the foment of revolution.\n\nOne of the tenants 'acquired' with these cottages was a Frenchman , Auguste Guyard, exiled after he had fallen out with the authorities in his homeland. He was certainly a kindred spirit of Ruskin. He created extensive gardens on this inclement rock and is buried above his cottage (below) in what has become known as the Frenchmen's Grave."
