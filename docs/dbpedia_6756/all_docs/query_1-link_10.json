Colt Hoare mentioned a cicerone but he might have meant one of the canons or archdeacons who provided him and others with hospitality during their stay; Mary Anne Hibbert mentioned a Welsh speaking guide but no one explicitly mentioned being taken round by an elderly woman or man as was often the case at other attractions in Wales.\n\nGuides and hosts:\n\n1776 The Bishop of St David’s and his wife stayed at the Treasurer’s house\n\n1788 Dr Holcombe, Canon of St David’s entertained Anon\n\n1791 Sophia Ward and her party were very genteelly accommodated at Mr Probyn, the residentiary vicar.

Others have suggested that it was written by George Owen of Henllys (1552-1613) (but see Atkins, Ivor, ‘The Authorship of the XVIth century description of St David’s Printed in Browne Willis’s Survey, 1717’, National Library of Wales Journal, vol. 4, (1946), pp. 115-22) On p. 60 of the transcription a marginal note dates it to between1601 and 1603 but it might be earlier. The author of other marginal notes appears to correct Willis’s transcription in places, implying that he too had seen the original manuscript.\n\n1600 (about)\n\nSouth-east view of the Cathedral probably drawn by George Owen’s servant, John Browne as a frontispiece for a collection of records of the episcopal estate.\n\nBritish Library, Harleian 6077, f. 5\n\nCharles, B.G., George Owen of Henllys, (1973), p. 184, plate 4\n\n1610\n\nFrom a MS.

Behind the choir a handsome chapel of bishop Vaughan’s, where sitting, he had windows so contrived into another chapel behind, called St. Mary’s chapel, that he might see five masses said together, at five several altars. The steeple is taken into the choir, and the bell ropes hang down into it; and of the wings of the church are made chapels. The Welch have a proverb, that it is as good to go to St. David’s twice, as to Rome once. There are also in this church the tomb of St. David, and one Wogan, a gentleman. This town is now a poor place; not far hence, on the sands, stood old Menew, whence the bishop is styled Menevensis.\n\nRay, John, Memorials of John Ray: consisting of his life by Dr Derham.

The West End or Body of the Church is tolerably well; the Choir is kept neat, and in tollerable repair, the S. Isle without the Choir, and the Virgin Mary’s Chappel, which makes the E. End of the Church, are in a manner demolish’d, and the Roofs of both fallen in.\n\nThere are a great many eminent Persons bury’d here, besides such, whose Monuments are defaced by Time; There is St. Davids Monument, to whom the Church is Dedicated, the Monument of the Earl of Richmond, as also of the famous Owen Tudor; there are also, four ancient Monuments of Knights Templars, known by their Figures lying cross Legged but their Names are not known. and there are six several Monuments of Bishops, who ruled this Church, besides St. David.\n\nThis St. David they tell us was Uncle to King Arthur, that he lived to 146 Years of Age, that he was Bishop of this Church 65 Years, being born in the Year 496, and dyed Ann. 642; that he built 12 Monasteries, and did abundance of Miracles.\n\nThere was a very handsome House for the Bishop, with a College, all built in a Close by themselves, but they are now turn’d to Ruins.\n\nDefoe, Daniel, A Tour Through the whole Island of Great Britain, (1725), pp. 85-86\n\n6.6.1730\n\nSt David’s Cathedral is in a bottom. The Chancel of it paved with painted Brick. Against the S. Wall in the Chancel is a Latin Inscription on Will. Needham, S.T.B. Chancellor here 40 Years, who dyed June 22, A.D.1727. Æt 73. The Sexton said that Bishop Erward was born here. [Biblioth. Topogr. Britann. No v. XL1 p.89. & British Critic xiv.] In the Chantor’s Isle are ornamental Pillars like those at Carphily Castle. Twice every Day there are Prayers in the Cathedral. In the Nave is the Parish-Church; a Welsh Sermon here on Sunday Morning. The Chantor, Chancellor, Treasurer, Canon Stephens (sed Q?), & the Archdeacon of St David’s, have Houses standing now. The Archdeacon of Cardigan, Mr Parry, had prepared materials for building his house, but dyed; Dr Davies of Kingsland, Herefordshire, the Chantor, has laid out Money on his House &c. He is very hospitable here. Medley, the Archdeacon of St David’s, has never been here but once. The Ruins of the Bishop’s Palace are very grand; it has the finest Vaults I ever saw, A noble Kitchen. The People have a silly Notion, that if the Bishop should come here at St James’s Tide, when the Audit is, the Chapter can oblige him to rebuild his Palace. Bishop Smallbrooke is in no good understanding with the Chapter. He has obliged them by Law to reside here two Months in a Year; in this undertaking he had the concurrence of the Chantor: The Chapter fills up their own Vacancies. Blundel told me, that the Bishop interested himself in Parliamentary Elections, but that the generality of the Clergy voted contrary to him; that Impropriators generally gave their Curates 5£ per Ann; the most generous 10£. One half of the Clergy hereabouts have never been at an University.\n\nLoveday, John, (1711-1789)\n\nMarkham, Sarah, John Loveday of Caversham, 1711-1789: The life and tours of an eighteenth-century onlooker.

But the tradition is that the tower has faln [sic] and probably beat down a great part of the church, particularly almost all the quire, for at the east end three old windows remain and the middle one, being probably damaged, appears now a gothic arch; over them is a Gothick window of about five feet in length, only below the spring of the arch all the ancient pillars of the quire remain, the arches being all Gothic. In the chancel are the three seat for the priests and attendants, who celebrate pontifically, and the Bishop’s seat is singular, consisting of three stalls, probably for the archbishop and two of his suffragans, in case they should happen at any time to come. There is a fine Gothic ornament over them, something like that at Exeter. The under part of the seats of the stalls are carved in many odd figures. The skreen at the west end of the quire is highly ornamented in the Gothick taste; the Saxon arches are double turned after the old way towards the aisle but to the body they are partly Gothic workmanship, partly Saxon. The present quire is in the tower, the lower part of the west side of which is old; all the rest is of Gothick architecture, except a few windows. The south end of the cross aisle is ancient, with more modern windows built in it; all the pillars of the body of the church are old, covered with four semi-circular pilasters over the large arches but they seem to have been rebuilt, with the addition of Gothick arches in front of the passage under them along the wall; all the great arches on the pillars are old, except the two western arches. The west end is all old, and the upper window is most singular in this manner, being as two quarters of a circle, or half windows on each side of the arch’d window. what they call the Bishop’s door is narrow. All the arches are finely adorned with Saxon ornaments, and most of them and the pillar with different ornaments. The destruction of the church is threatened by the same means as before, for the tower is split, and the pillars have given way, so as to drive the arches of the body of the church much out of the perpendicular. Archbishop Peter de Leia, about 1176, rebuilt the cathedral; this was probably the Saxon building. In 1220 the tower fell down; in1248 a great part of the church was thrown down by an earthquake. There are tombs of many bishops and canons about the church. There is a remarkable monument in the middle of the chancel, which I judge was the old quire. It is of Edmund, Earl of Richmond, father to Henry 7th, and, it’s said, this saved the church when Henry VIII thought of removing the episcopal see to Carmarthen. The college is to the south of the cathedral, with its Cloyster and refectory, This is, it may be, the college for a master and seven priests, founded by William, Duke of Lancaster … in 1365.\n\nOn the other side of the river is what they call the palace, a very grand building, and what adds to its magnificence are the handsome small arches at the top with battlements over them; … [about half as much description as for the Cathedral.]\n\nThe houses of the dignitaries …\n\nOn the 23rd we left St David’s …\n\nPococke, Richard, letter dated St David’s, 23.8.1756, British Library Add ms. 23000, ff. 107-108\n\nCartright, James, Joel, (ed), The Travels Through England of Dr Richard Pococke, Camden, vol. 2, (1889), pp. 174-233\n\nT., F.D., Bye-gones, [Selective transcription of Cartright]: 19.1.1927, pp. 71-72; 16.3.1927, pp. 83-84\n\n1761\n\n[The Chanter’s chapel] is greatly neglected and seems to be chiefly used for ordinary burials.

But here, for itch and filth of all kinds I will defend the superiority of St. David’s to Scotland against any partial Scotch advocate whatsoever. I must have been poisoned but for the profuse libations of lavender water which I was perpetually opposing to Welsh stink and nastiness. Such terrible accommodation are no incitements to view a place honoured with the internment of the British Saint and Bishop.\n\nAdjoining to the palace also appears venerable vestiges of an Abbey, now entirely unroofed in every part, exposing to the wind and rain the sculptured resting places of the worthies of past ages, so that I had the pleasure of beholding the Maidenhair, Hartstongues and Spleenwort, plentifully flourishing from between the Knights Templars legs and mitred noddles of long forgotten Bishops, decorating with living green, the monumental effigies of those whom time long since had crumbled into nothing.\n\nT.K., Account of a Journey through North Wales 1767, Gentleman’s Magazine, vol. 37, (1767) p. 589-590Thomas, P.G., An English tourist in the 18th century.

Part of the palace was erected by St Patrick [sic] for the erection of King John in his journey to Ireland; a monument to this saint is still shewed here. This place was once an archbishopric, but has been since translated into the bishops palace. They show a kitchen which by the number of fires, seems calculated to supply all the luxuries of eating. A statue of King John and Queen Mary is yet seen over one of the portals belonging to the palace. The cathedral is a most noble and sacred pile of building, though it must now boast more of its antiquity than beauty; it is 300 feet in length. The choir part is the exact size of the tower. The Bishop’s throne is particularly neat and beautiful; the Mosaic pavement round the altar piece is worth observation. St David’s shrine is to be noticed. Bishop Vaughan’s chapel is immediately behind the altar and is remarkable for the beauty of its architecture. The roof yet remains unhurt by time. This is the place in which it is said the penitents confessed their sins. St Mary’s chapel greatly esteemed by our famous antiquarian, Browne Willis, is immediately beyond the other; a relic of St Peter’s head is here presented, [sic] a are also some other monuments of the Bishops of St Davids. In the church is the tomb of Edmund, Earl of Richmond, father to Henry VII, and also the famous Owen Tudor. Saint David was said to be the father of King Arthur and lived to be 146 years of age; he was bishop of this place 65 years.\n\nExpenses at St David’s £0/2/0 (£0.10)\n\nGrimston, James Bucknall, Sir, (Third Viscount Grimston, 1749-1809)\n\nA Tour in Wales, 1769, Hertfordshire Record Office D/EV/F15-19).

I had so little notion of its being the bishoprick that I enquired in the street how far it was to St David’s. The palace and cathedral lie below the town and cannot be seen from it. [In the 2nd edition (1781) Wyndham replaced ‘wretched’ with ‘miserable’.]\n\nThe bishop’s palace, which was erected in the reign of Edward III. St. David’s is an immense ruin; several of the apartments are of an extraordinary magnitude, the walls of which are all entire. The whole parapet is Gothic, and open, like those at Swansea and Llamphey, a circumstance peculiar to these three monuments of antiquity.\n\nThe area of the great court is about 120 feet square. On the east side of it is the bishop’s hall, 58 feet in length, and 23 in breadth. The king’s hall on the south side is 88 by 30. This grand saloon is said to have been built expressly for the reception of king John on his return from Ireland, tho’ it carries evident marks of bishop Gower’s architecture, who certainly constructed the other parts of the palace.\n\nThe arch, over the door way of the porch leading to the bishop’s hall, has the singularity of forming half an octagon.\n\nThe nave of the present cathedral was built in the reign of king John; the semi-circular arches in it are large and well proportioned to its piers. A majesty of style, in the Norman door and windows of the western front, renders that side uncommonly striking. The other parts of the church have been the production of different ages, as the variety of architecture plainly demonstrates.\n\nThe roofs, within, are wainscoted with Irish oak, and, though coeval with the church, are entirely free from the filth of cobwebs.\n\nSome people have considered this antidotal quality against spiders in the oak of Ireland, as fabulous; but, whatever the cause may be, the fact is certain, for I have seen an old barn, the timbers of which were of that country, and, notwithstanding the partiality of those disagreeable animals to that kind of building, I could not, upon the strictest examination, discover a single cobweb in any part of it.\n\nBishop Vaughn’s chapel was annexed to it in the time of Henry VIII. and has a light elegant roof of stone quite perfect. Several ancient monuments appear both within the church, and among the many ruined chapels, that adjoin to it. Edmund, earl of Richmond, father of Henry VII. lies under a raised tomb, near the middle of the choir, and, at a little distance from it, is the monument of Owen Tudor.\n\nThe choral service is performed in this cathedral twice a day; I am sorry to add, that the church is kept in a very slovenly manner; part of it is not paved, and the graves are frequently raised within it of earth, as in common church yards. There is something innocent, and pathetically pleasing, in the idea of strewing flowers and evergreens over the grave of a departed friend, which is the universal practice of these parts.\n\n{History}\n\nI cannot better express the dreariness of this country, than in the words of Giraldus, who lies buried in the cathedral; but poor Cambrensis was unknown to the officiating vicar, and of course, his tomb.\n\nThe land about this remote angle, on the Irish sea, is rocky, barren, and fruitless; it is neither clothed with wood, varied with rivers, not beautified with meadows; but a land constantly exposed to storms and tempests. – Such solitary habitations were formerly industriously explored by religious men; where undisturbed with the noise and hurry of the world, they might freely and securely enjoy a spot of ground, which was not likely to be torn from them.\n\nQuotes Drayton’ Polyolbion, song 5\n\nWyndham, Henry Penruddocke.

His wife, Mary, wrote a letter describing the visit\n\nWe approached the town and entered it between two great stones by way of a gateway. It is nothing but a parcel of poor houses dispersed about and built upon a slope which we descended to the church which appeared to me nothing more of the outside than a plain well-looking parish church, and not at all or ornamented like a cathedral, however it is here in Wales thought a marvellous fine thing because so superior (which is true enough) to any other in the whole country, its antiquity likewise is cried up … but I refer your Ladyship to Browne Willis. … The inside of the Cathedral is much superior to the out, being really a regular pretty cathedral, and the ceiling of Irish Oak, much superior to that in Westminster Hall; but the whole in danger of falling and much out of repair.\n\nAnd now I come to the house we rest in belonging to the treasurer, and one of the best in the place. [A substantial part of this house was no longer standing by the 20th century.]\n\nThe first room I came to was a hall; open to the roof at the top; and paved by Nature herself; unless (if one may conjecture from the holes and unevenness) she called in the assistance of some of the neighbouring rabbits that abound here. The saloon through it, where now I sit, is paved with brick, however the house is clean and warm, my Lady received me as I expected last night, and I was scarcely seated in my chair when I was consulted not only what I would order for supper, but how I would have a sheep cut up? the butcher waiting with his knife ready whetted to obey my orders. Indeed the whole of this journey to St David’s has been not unlike some journeys in a much more distant country: the sending weeks before to order Small Beer here to be brewed, and chickens and sheep brought, with the hurry that appears in preparing before hand for every fresh removal, would almost persuade one we were travelling to Chenea.\n\nThe environs of this place are highly amusing, the sea views, the ruins of the fine Old Palace, College etc contrasted with the poverty of the present hovels, furnish a fine fund for speculation as well as employment for the pencil.\n\nThe hall called King John’s (who as said to be entertained here on his way to Ireland), is 80 feet by 30, the chapel and the common hall, all magnificent, but when I come to describe to you the kitchen supported by a pillar in which are 5 chimneys! I am ready to lay down my pen, and say, how are the mighty fallen! alas poor Bishop of St David’s.\n\nThe confirmation was held here in the morning [and I] went with the Bishop in the afternoon to prayers, we both agreed we never were present at so odd a scene before, the service as to be performed as in other choirs and all the state assumed upon the occasion that the poverty of affairs would admit of, the Bishop and his procession, the manner of chanting the service, the Throne on which he was placed raised with matting, and the tottering stand to rest his book upon that altered his balance with the weight of every fresh leaf he turned over, put him in mind of what one has heard said of the scald miserables who imitated in a miserable style the free masons. But who should I describe the congregation? Fine folks dressed out from the English alias Pembroke side, inhabitants of St David’s who are Welsh, dreadful poor natives from the Northern Sea Coast (who are the poorest and wildest of this wild country picking up a miserable livelihood by milking the sheep and scraping some mosses of the sea stones to sell), add to these sailors from the bay and our own family who were really a different set of people from any I have named, all close together … I will only describe the dress of two women just before me to show how distinct (and yet how near united, in the Country) the two sets of people are. One of my ladies in powdered hair with feathers and no cap, the other just by her who it would be flattery to liken to the Witches in Macbeth; round her shoulders was cast a dirty square piece of flannel fastened before with a thorn, round her head a more dirty blue and white pocket handkerchief, over this a man’s hat that perhaps was once black, but now much of the colour of the face it shaded, namely a yellow brown, the whole complexion seemed made of tan leather, and whereas in Carmarthenshire the faces of the common people have a vacant grin and stare upon them, this face was too ugly to have any expression.\n\nHer Husband added:\n\nWe shall not soon forget the oddities and ruinated magnificence of St David’s town and church [Cathedral]\n\nYorke, Mary, Bedfordshire Record Office, Wrest Park Papers, L30/9; L 30/11 and others; Jones, Anthea, Letters from the Bishop’s wife, 1774-1778, Carmarthen Antiquary, XXXVIII, (2002), Letter 6, pp. 24-27\n\n1.5.1781\n\nI rode to St. David’s, seventeen measured miles from Haverford. I was surprised to find all the land, for the last nine or ten miles, so fruitful and well cultivated. What a difference is there between the westermost parts of England, and the westermost parts of Wales’ The former (the west of Cornwall) so barren and wild; the latter, so fruitful and well improved. But the town itself is a melancholy spectacle. I saw but one tolerable good house in it. The rest are miserable huts indeed. I do not remember so mean a town, even in Ireland. [This was written after nearly 45 years of travelling 250,000 miles around the UK and elsewhere.]\n\nThe cathedral has been a large and stately fabric, far superior to any other in Wales. But a great part of it is fallen down already; and the rest is hastening into ruin: one blessed fruit (among many) of bishops residing at a distance from their see. Here are the tombs and effigies of many ancient worthies: Owen Tudor in particular. But the zealous Cromwellians broke off their noses, hands, and feet; and defaced them as much as possible. But what had the Tudors done to them: Why, they were progenitors of kings.\n\nWesley, John, The Journal of the Reverend John Wesley: vol. 2, (1832), p. 542\n\n19.8.1785\n\n{decided not to go to St David’s, due to lack of transport, the absence of the hospitable canon [?Canon Holcombe] and lack of a sufficient object to recompense them.}\n\nDrake, William, [3 letters to his father, Tour of Wales]\n\nCentre for Buckinghamshire Studies, D-DR/8/13/1-3, p. 9\n\n5.9.1787\n\nto St David’s. The approach to this Holy City (as it is called) does not impress any idea of magnificence. a straggling street of mean houses among which we find a most miserable inn made us rather wonder at St David’s taste for removing the seat of his archbishopric from Caerleon into this obscure corner. A few eggs and bacon was with much difficulty procured, and would have been very welcome after a tedious journey of 5 hours if the filth and ill smells of the house had not almost banished all idea of eating. The thought of sleeping in the midst of it were beginning to perplex us, when we were happily relieved by a message from Mrs Holcombe at whose house we were received with the most polite and cordial hospitality. The worthy canon was at this time absent from home, but his good lady vies with him in extending her benevolence to all travelling in distress hose curiosity brings them to this place. She was so obliging to conduct us to the Cathedral and the ruins of the Palace where Miss Holcombe the eldest of eight fine children acted the part of Cicerone being perfect mistress of the history of the place. The chapels adjoining to the cathedral are most of them uncovered; one of them, Bishop Vaughan’s still preserving a very beautiful roof. The most remarkable of the tombs are those of St David – Owen Tudor and Edmund, Earl of Richmond father of Henry 7th and Bishop Gower and these are principally curious from the from the illustrious men interred within them; what ornaments they had being defaced by Cromwell’s soldiers. The Early of Richmond’s is now perfectly plain; but is composed of granite found in the country of uncommon hardness; so much so that were [sic] assured the finest Sicilian marble might brought over at less expense than the stone on the spot can be wrought for.\n\nThe palace is a very large structure. King John’s hall a noble room 88ft by 30. The whole is full of peculiar whims of architecture not found in other places; among these may be reckoned the open gothic parapet similar to that at Llanphor [Lamphey]; the circular window like a wheel at the end of King John’s hall and two arches in the court one of which is like the bottom of an escutcheon [small sketch of an ogee arch] the other half an octagon [small sketch]. Near the church are the ruins of a college dedicated to St Mary founded by John of Gaunt. The situation of the church and palace seems very extraordinary being in a deep dell; and the earth appear to have been dug away very considerably towards the east end of the church to give room to build it.\n\nBut the reason probably was to conceal it from being an object at a distance, a they were liable to frequent visits from the Danes and other piratical invaders. It is so effectually hid by its situation that even from the town nothing but just the top of the tower can be seen. These sacred precincts were fortified by a wall which contained the houses of the canons prebends etc. They had the advantage of a rivulet which ran through their citadel; but the town itself was a kind of suburb totally undefended.\n\n{Entertained by the young ladies playing on the harpsicord, and decided to stay another day.}\n\n6.9.1787 Thursday\n\nPorth Clais\n\nSt David’s Head\n\nTo Haverfordest.\n\nAnon [Mr M? of Belmont, in or near Hereford], NLW Ms 9352a, no page numbers\n\n28.7.1788\n\nSt David’s is a Bishop’s see but the Cathedral is nothing surprizing, the only part worthy of notice in point of architecture is Bishop Vaughan’s chapel which appears to me to be Gothic and which can be trifling when compared to the Antiquity of the building as they have traced 110 bishops progressively.

They reckoned about 1200 inhabitants, and 261 within the parish, and these 290 inhabitants and 78 small houses in the town. The cathedral and episcopal palace are quite at the bottom of a steep hill, so that the tower is scarcely visible in the town. These and the prebendal houses, are surrounded by a stone wall, 1100 yards in circuit, with four gates. The cathedral having been often demolished; the present was built according to Giraldus, in the reign of King Henry II. or, as Willis, 1110, It is a handsome pile, with two transepts, in length, from east to west, 300 feet, and the body with the aisles, 76 feet broad.\n\nBehind the choir is a most beautiful chapel, with a rich roof of carved stone, built by bishop Vaughan, t. [temp] King Henry VIII. as a kind of presbytery, between the\n\nchoir and Lady Chapel. In the last, whose roof, as well as those of the aisles of the choir and transepts, have been down ever since the civil war, are monuments of three bishops, and in the nave, &c. four or five more. In the north wall of the choir is the shrine of St. David; a kind of altar tomb, with a canopy of four pointed arches, and in front four quatrefoil holes, into which the votaries put their offerings, which were taken out by the monks at two iron doors behind. In the choir are also the monuments of Owen Tudor, second husband of Queen Catharine, Rhys ap Tudor, Bishops Jorwerth and Anselm, in the thirteenth century, and Edmund, Earl of Richmond, father of King Henry VII. This last monument is said to have prevented King Henry VIII. from removing the see to Caermarthen. Giraldus Cambrensis, who was archdeacon of Brecon, canon of Hereford, and rector of Chesterton, Oxford, was buried here in 1213. On the north side of the church are some walls of St. Mary’s College, founded by Bishop Houghton, and John of Gaunt, in 1365, valued at £106 per annum.\n\nThe little river Alan divides the church on the west from the rest of the close. Over it formerly lay a large block of marble, 10 feet long, called Llech-lavar, or the speaking stone; because attempting to speak once as a corpse was carrying over it split in two, on which account no more corpses were carried over it. {more stories relating to the stone}.\n\nOn the other side of the river stands the shell of three side of a magnificent palace built by bishop Gower. The hall is 58 feet by 23, to which adjoins a parlour 25 feet square, with an oratory. The kitchen is 23 feet by 28, with a central pillar supporting four wide arches which occupy the four side of the room forming four vast chimnies. The south side of the quadrangle consists of a very noble hall, built as they say to entertain king John on his return from Ireland, 90 feet by 30, with a beautiful catharine-wheel east window, and over the porch two statues called king John and his queen. To this room adjoins another 30 feet by 28, and a second 40 by 20, beside other apartments and offices. within the close are four or five good prebendal houses; those of the minor canons being mere cottages; and north-east of St Mary’s college are the ruins of the vicars chorals college.\n\n{The name of St David’s}\n\n{Y Maen sigl}\n\n{Whitesands bay}\n\n{chapels}\n\nCamden, William, Britannia: or, a chorographical description of the flourishing kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the islands adjacent; from the earliest antiquity.

Like other visitors, he did not like what Nash had done, but in a footnote added to his 1802 tour, thought that Mr Nash, then a young man, [is] now much improved in his art as an architect.\n\nDrawings of the front before and after Nash’s work survive but it was rebuilt by George Gilbert Scott in 1862.\n\nJones, I.

The roads are better but the country still more open and dreary inclosed with high banks and stone walls. How melancholy and at the same time how true a description does Gerald give of this place. …\n\nNothing can be more dreary than the country about St David’s; not even a hedge can be reared on account of the high winds which prevail here. Much however might be done by human labour and industry toward recovering the bad character it has born for so many centuries. The residentiary canon, Mr Holkham [Holcombe] has planted some trees near his residence which thrive well – their situation, however, is rather sheltered and the crop of corn, here the land is properly cultivated, are good. The barley of these parts is of a particularly fine quality and in great request.\n\nSt David’s however, on account of its ancient name and high character in the Welsh Annals deserves the attention of every curious traveller but few I find ever visit it.\n\nThis church as originally founded by St David whose bones rest under its roof, and till the year 1101 was the Metropolitan church of Wales; about which time it became subject to the see of Canterbury. The shrine of this saint was frequented by numerous crowds of pilgrims and even Kings came penitent and barefooted to pay their devotions to it. The value of the relicts and offerings daily received was so great that the weighed, and divided amongst the monks every week. In short it became to British Loretto.\n\nThe Church as well as all the adjoining buildings are either in an absolute state of ruin or decay. The cathedral is still made use of as a place of religious worship and service is performed in it both in the English and Welch languages, though owing to the bad ground in which it is built its existence is in a very precarious state. There is a very great settlement in one of the arches supporting the steeple. The architecture is a mixture of Norman and Gothic; the arches are finely proportioned and many of the ornaments are very elegant.

In the interior quadrangle of this building is a hall of large proportions, over the entrance door to which are said to be the statues of King John and his Queen. On the other side of the quadrangle are the Bishops apartments – hall, kitchen etc. in which were some chimnies of a curious construction, now fallen down. This noble building owes its ruin to Bishop Barlow who lived in the time of Queen Elizabeth and procured leave to strip the lead from off the roof of this palace and with which he is said to have portioned his five daughters to as many Bishops. He is also said to have alienated another Episcopal Palace at Lamphey which became the possession of the Favourite Earl of Essex and to which he retired after his disgrace. But the epoch of the fall of Saint David’s was at the Reformation when the offerings to the holy shrine, the relicts, indulgence etc. etc. came into dispute.

The former consists of Norman and Gothic architecture, the latter of which no prevails in the extension part of the building but the front as formerly of the former style and now presents a miserable compilation of modern architecture. But within the walls we find a beautiful assemblage of ?de cora noe architecture and many interesting particularities in the rood loft, st David’s shrine etc. nor must we pass over in silence the elegant chapel built by Bishop Vaughan, and in which he lies buried. Amongst the most remarkable monuments are those of Bishops Morgan, Goer, Anslem – Iorwerth, Houghton and Martin – of Rhys ap Tudor prince of Wales and his sons and the Duke of Richmond father to King Henry the seventh.

The Cathedral is still used for divine service both in English and Welch – though there are so many settlements in it owing to the bad ground on which it is built that its existence is in a precarious state. There is a very great one in the arch supporting the steeple. The architecture is a mixture of Gothic and Norman. The arches are finely proportioned and many of the ornaments very elegant – though not so light and airy as those at Llanthony Abbey. The pavement is sadly disfigured by the custom generally adopted through many parts of Wales of digging graves within the church by which its level is raised and rendered very uneven. …\n\nThe monuments which it contains are these –\n\nBishop Morgan\n\nBishop Gower\n\nBishop Anslem\n\nBishop Iorwerth\n\nBishop Houghton\n\nBishop Martin\n\nBird, the stone cutter\n\nSilvester the physician\n\nTreasurer Lloyd\n\nOwen ap Tudor\n\nRhees ap Tudor his brother\n\nDuke of Richmond Father to King Henry VII\n\nSt David\n\nThese are besides many others defaced and unknown\n\nI was also shown one supposed to be that of my travelling companion Giraldus Cambrensis – There is a doubt about those of the Tudors. There are several of the Knights Templars with their legs crossed. Behind the tomb of St David are the Holes here the pilgrims placed their offerings.\n\nMany of these tombs, particularly that of the Duke of Richmond were opened and plundered by Oliver Cromwell.\n\nBishop Gower was the last great improver and restorer of the church and adjoining buildings. There is a beautiful chapel built by Bishop Vaughan called by his name and in which he is buried.\n\nAbove £2,000 have lately been expended in repairing the West End of the church and I wish I could add that they had been expended with judgement and good taste instead of the beautiful window of Norman Architecture which was universally admired another composed of heavy compilation if Gothic and Norman\n\np. 18\n\nornaments is substituted in its place and at every point of view hurts the eye and makes you regret the loss of the former antique window. The eastern front remains in its old situation. The college adjoining the cathedral, built by John of Gaunt is a beautiful elegant ruin. The Bishops palace from its magnitude is still more magnificent. The range of open Gothic Arches run along the parapets. The use of these is evident from one part remaining entire. This castle served as a fortification as well as an Episcopal residence and this range of arches was evidently made se of to strengthen the battlements over them.\n\nKing John’s hall and the Royal chapel adjoin in a still ???? ???? – over the entrance to the former are the ?statues of himself and his queen. Near it is the Bishops hall and a ??? ??? half octagon arch ?one of these forms the entrance to it. There was a curious chimney in a room adjoining – but no fallen down. This noble building owes its ruin to Bishop Barlow who lived in Queen Elizabeth’s time and procured leave to strip the lead from off the roof of this palace with the amount of which it is said he portioned five daughters to as many Bishops. It is said that he alienated also another Episcopal Palace at Lamphey which became the possession of the Favourite Earl of Essex and to which he retired after his disgrace.\n\nBut the Epoch of the fall of St David’s was the reformation when the offerings to the Holy shrine of the Relicts came into dispute. A tower is shown at St David’s said to have been the birth place of St Patrick – though other countries dispute for that honour – Erasmus certainly quotes him as a Welshman by birth – Thus much for St Davids and its church which to a lover of antiquities is highly gratifying, and affords to the painter a variety of picturesque beauties and the Richest specimens of Norman Architecture. I could have wished that its situation had been more advantageous it is built in a ?flat and surrounded by so many stone walls, modern buildings etc. etc. that it requires no short time to discover what points of view are the most favourable. Its history has been written by Browne Willis – but very incorrectly as he never saw the place till his book was published – the records have been unfortunately lost not even a list of the Bishops exists at St Davids and part only of the statues of the church – New churches, from the early era of its foundation and its great celebratory would furnish more interesting records of ?anecdotes for history, but the materials are lost and St David remains unfrequented and unknown. In the churchyard lies Miss Lucy Bland sister to our celebrated comedian Mrs Jordan. NB the entrance to the city is through an Octagon gateway which has a fine appearance.\n\nThe modern village of St Davids consists of some straggling low houses and one long street opening to distant views of the sea. In this is situated the inn if it deserves that appellation, for it is by far the worst I have yet met with. During my tour I was very far from well … yet resolved to put up with the accommodations which the Black Lion afforded. I was soon however relieved from my anxiety by the kind invitation of Canon Holcombe who insisted on my lodging in his house.\n\n{St David’s Head}\n\nColt Hoare, Richard, Tour of South Wales, Cardiff Public Library, ms 4.302.6 (folio)\n\n1793\n\nThe cathedral is in a very ruinous state and I should conceive will soon come down as the north side of the principal aisle inclines and I understood the foundation is bad, the town has the poorest and most miserable appearance I ever beheld indeed I think it scarce worthwhile going to see at so much trouble a church that exhibits no singular marks of particular architectural merit, the roof, nevertheless claims attention, is of Irish oak and carved in a singular manner, the Bishop’s palace is a complete ruin and has been so for better than 200 years as also a large hall built, as is said, for the reception of King John. … As the inn at St Davids is merely an ale house, accommodations there would be bad, but they told me that they could procure excellent beds at an adjoining house ?where there is great civility shewed to strangers by one of the canons Mr Holecolm, [Holcombe] who upon hearing we were there sent immediately to invite us to dinner but we had already got our bad fare.\n\nCooke, Bryan, Journal of a Tour to south Wales, NLW MS 24143, f. 14\n\n14.8.1794\n\nSt David’s – a wretched city\n\n{Cobwebs never seen on the roof of St David’s cathedral}\n\nAnon, Journal of Tours in the Midland and Western Counties of England and Wales in 1794, and in Devonshire in 1803, BL add ms. 30172, f. 6v\n\nThe reference to cobwebs may have come from Wyndham (1774) above.\n\n1795\n\nSt. David’s {location, names, history}\n\nThus it appears to have been once a city of good account, and to have had a castle and walls, which, though both long since destroyed, and the place so reduced, as to have no market; yet it still continues the see of a bishop, whose palace, indeed, is said to be much out of repair, and the town quite decayed, and almost deserted, by reason of its barren and unhealthy situation, in a land, says Giraldus, neither clad with trees, nor watered with rivers, nor adorned with meadows, but continually exposed to the winds and storms. Therefore it has little worthy of notice, besides its cathedral built in the reign of king John, and dedicated to St. Andrew and David, which is a venerable old building, and the west-end is in good repair; but the east-end has suffered much from time and neglect, the roof being quite fallen in. It was very high, the height of the middle aisle to the vaulting being fifty-four feet, and that of the tower in the middle, wherein hang but three bells (the four biggest having been stole out of it) 127 feet. The length of the whole fabric from east to west, including the walls, is 300 feet, whereof it is 124 from the west door to the entrance into the choir. The length from the choir door to the altar is 8o feet. The breadth of the body of the side aisles is 72 feet, and of the west front 76 feet, and the length of the great cross aisle from north to south is 136.\n\nBoswell, Henry, The Antiquities of England and Wales Displayed: Being a Grand Repository of Elegance, Taste, and Entertainment … Comprising everything of Importance in the works of Leland, Maitland, Gibson, Dugdale, Buck, Speed, Pennant etc., and Captain Grose.\n\n1796\n\nBoth Lady and Sir Christopher Sykes wrote an almost identical account of their tour of Wales, and although Lady Sykes’s version is longer it is thought that she copied and embellished her husband’s script. They were shown round by someone whom they thought was a sub-dean of eighty-five years of age. [Pritchard was really (Delabere) Pritchett the Sub-chanter. Thanks to Wyn Evans].\n\nThe City of St David’s is now no better than a miserable village, with no entertainment for man or horse, but what a mere pot ale house suited to such a village affords but bad as was our Hotel, the Cathedral and the remnants of its two palaces are worth being sometime in purgatory to see and Sir C [her husband] said had he been alone, a bed or no bed, he would have made a longer stay. The town is situated above the cathedral, to which you descend through a strong gateway, The West, North, and South great Nave and side aisles are of the finest and most ancient Saxon architecture I should think as old as Edward the Confessor; The arches vast semicircles with one grand scroll of Zig Zag work, large and bold and the smaller arches for the upper windows of the same style; one arch, under the tower, to separate the East and West end of the church is unfortunately walled up; it is remarkable, that there is an ascent in the floor of the church, from the west or Bishops door as it is called (being never opened except when he is there) to the Altar; from this west door to the screen under the Tower Arch, above named, each pair of column shafts are shorter than their western neighbours, for the plinths of them all are of the same height, from the screen to the altar, the ascent is by several small flights of steps; here is a small neat quire with the Archbishops throne, and a seat on each side for his attendants. Within the altar rails are remains of the glazed tiles, so commonly used about four hundred years ago with arms and inscriptions, but I did not see a date to any of them, they told us they were blazoned with the arms of the most ancient families in Britain, but it would have been a work of time, to have deciphered them, being laid in no order. There have been three high narrow windows , now walled up, behind the altar in which it was common formerly to have coloured glass in various figures, and behind these windows, in Bishop Vaughan’s chapel, large lamps were placed so as to be moved, sometimes illuminating one figure and sometimes another which caused almost a moving picture and were seen only by the multitude at a distance, never nearer than the screen, the old priest making them believe it was enlightened by rays from Heaven. This part of the choir was called the sanctorum, or Holy of Holies, being sacred to the Priests. Behind this chapel built by Bishop Vaughan, was the Ladies chapel, the wall between them was the confessional oratory, the priests being in our Ladies chapel, and the Penitents in Bishop Vaughan’s; in this wall eighteen inches thick, are now remaining the diagonal apertures, one on each side, about two inches wide, and fourteen inches high, through which the Penitents confessed their sins; there are also two other larger apertures, through which they made their peace offerings. In this confessional chapel are seven figures of mournful and hideous countenances, which may be supposed to represent the sorrow and horror a penitent should entertain for the sins he has committed. When the Tyrant, Henry 8th destroyed the power of the pope, he did not at once destroy the power of the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Religion, for he made it death to hold that auricular confession was unnecessary or private Masses improper, nor did he abolish all the ceremonies of that religion, but as he adopted the reformed religion from convenience, from Pique, and the gratification of his Lust, he was indifferent as to what ceremonies were retained, or abolished, which accounts for those remains of the Popish ceremonies being found in some of our old cathedrals and churches, as here and at Malvern, It is said that he had some little veneration for this cathedral, as it contained the bones of his Grandfather, and on that account would not suffer the Bishoprick to be removed from St Davids to Carmarthen, as was once proposed, as being nearer the centre of the See;\n\nBut its then bishop then expostulated with him upon it, and told him, he hoped he would not degrade the See or his grandfather’s remains by separating them, to which he replied, “it may rust here”\n\nIn the quire is the tomb of St David, and there is an aperture from the aisle into the tomb, through which all the rich offerings were made to the shrine of St David; and in the opposite aisle, but against the before named Ladies chapel has been a closet, about two feet square, with a strong iron door to it, in which is supposed to have been kept the host. In the quire are also the Tombs of Owen Tewdyr [Tudor] and Rhys, who was the son of this Tudor, and one of the Princess of South Wales who had been defeated by Traham, and took sanctuary at this place, and hearing of Gruffud’s arrival, he went with all the clergy to meet him, and falling on his knees implored his help against his adversaries, promising to do him Homage, and to reward him with a moiety of his revenues; Gruffydd pitying him his condition yielded to his request, and having overthrown their common enemy, Rhys was put again into the quiet possession of South Wales; here also are the tombs of Edward Earl of Richmond, father to Henry 7th and several Bishops; and in the side aisle, now unroofed, which run beyond the quire past the Ladies chapel are many more, and a knight templar, and many fragments of figures from the ruins of other monuments; the roof of the west nave is said to be of Irish oak, it is very curiously constructed, a little of that kind called the dropping roof; The present Bishop (Stuart) and chapter have rebuilt, or repaired the West end, and have very laudably preserved the precise style of the cathedral; the tower is lofty , and plane [sic] and very ancient, but I guess not so old as the west end; the quire comes next in antiquity to the tower, and the rest is of a much later date. The confessional or Bishop Vaughan’s chapel, built in the beginning of Henry the 8th reign is a beautiful piece of Gothic work. The columns are very odd, being built of red and white stones laid in alternate order from bottom to top. The whole cathedral is ill paved, being chiefly laid with fragments of tomb stones, but otherways I saw nothing improper as to the graves, as some modern authors have mentioned. Service is performed here twice every day, in English in the morning, and Welsh in the afternoon, no human being attending but the readers and choristers. Four canons constantly reside and read their week each, and one Prebend or residentiary, which is very different from poor Llandaff.\n\nAdjoining to the cathedral have been the cloisters and a fine room, perhaps a library, or grand hall; these are on the north. To the west stand a vast pile of ruins said to be of two palaces, one for the archbishop and the other for King John; in the latter iss a hall 28 yards 9 ½ as Sir C. strided it. In the other is also a very large room, and several small ones, the whole is even yet vaulted under; the roof is gone though there is a very curious parapet remaining on many of the walls, it stands on small pillars between which, the slating of the roof has been continued to carry off the water and upon those pillars were arches, and above the arches a low wall, supposed in this exposed stormy country to be intended to prevent the slates, or lead, or whatever it was covered with, from being blown off.\n\n{Story of King John and the Jews.}\n\nThe ruins of other buildings, and of the walls are scattered all around; ssome of the vaults are supposed to have been appropriated to the lodgings of the numerous pilgrims, who were devotees to St Davids shrine.\n\nA sub-dean of eighty five years of age, named Prichard, had the kindness to attend us. We can never forget his kind attention to strangers. He had just finished the morning service, and though very unequal to the Duty, he said the reading in that cathedral was the greatest comfort he had on God’s Earth.\n\nWith the assistance of Sir C’s arm he led us through the cathedral and all over the ruins to his house and introduced us to his daughter, Mrs James who along with her husband lived with him. Mr James is a clergyman and has a school at St David’s. This hospitable and venerable man offered us wine and said he was as sorry as the man who killed his Greyhound, that he could not accommodate us, and pointing to the arms over the door, related the story of how a man killed his hound which had saved his child from a wolf symbols of which were on the coat of arms over the door of the sub-dean.} More on the story of the hound which is like that of Gellert\n\nLady Sykes, University of Hull, DDSY(3)/10/11 (Typed transcript) pp. 178-186\n\nSykes, Christopher, Sir (1749-1801) (of Sledmere, Yorkshire, M.P. for Beverly, 1784-1790), Journal of a Tour in Wales, 1796, NLW MS 2258C (Typescript copy of his tour of Wales), pp. 38-41 and another copy NLW Misc vols 38.\n\n1796\n\nSt David’s – ‘a few miserable hovels and an inn or rather a wretched ale house.’ [but a paragraph below suggests that they didn’t visit St David’s]\n\nJ.

Whatever the place might have been formerly, it is now only a scattered village, situated in the midst of barrenness, on the banks of the river Ilen. We went to the cathedral, and visited the shrine of the saint after whom it is named. This memorable character, as we were informed, lived about one thousand three hundred years since, and is regarded by the Ancient Britons with a superstitious kind of veneration ; for within the limits of his diocese, death-fires, ghosts, and other mysterious appearances are seen, the very mention of which would make\n\nEach particular hair to stand on end,\n\nLike quills upon the fretful porcupine.\n\nThe cathedral stands at the bottom of a hill, at the end of the town, and does considerable credit to the architectural genius of antiquity; but the situation, from its lowness, is extremely ineligible. All magnificent structures should, as much as possible, command some interesting points of view. If this circumstance be overlooked, the money of the public and the labours of the artist will be exhausted, without producing any great or corresponding effects;\n\nEvans, John, (ed.), Remains of William Reed, late of Thornbury; including rambles in Ireland, (London, 1815), pp. 94-95\n\n23.7.1798\n\nMuch of Clutterbuck’s account came from Richard Gough’s edition of Camden’ Britannia (1789) whom he acknowledged:\n\nThe city of St David’s if it can be called one is inferior to any town in Wales having but few houses and but one small inn with bad accommodation, bad beds, the bed for instance in which I had the misfortune to be laid being not only damp but so stocked with fleas that to sleep was impossible.\n\np. 123\n\nThe cathedral is well worthy of observation built in the Saxon style of architecture of hitch\n\nThe pillars are very fine specimen particularly the s???? at the east end.\n\nThe Cathedral, and dilapidated ruins of the episcopal Palace, are situated at the\n\nbottom of a steep hill, and scarcely visible in the town: these, and the prebendal\n\nhouses, were formerly enclosed by a strong stone wall, with four gates, computed at\n\neleven hundred yards in circuit…. The Cathedral having been demolished; the\n\npresent was built, according to Giraldus, in the reign of King Henry II.; or, as Willis,\n\n1110. It is an handsome pile, with two transepts, its length, from east to west, 300 feet; and the body with the aisles, 76 feet broad, behind the choir and Lady chapel, In the last, whose roof, as well as those of the aisles of the choir and transepts, have been down ever since the civil war, are monuments of three bishops, and in the nave, &c. four or five more. In the N wall is the shrine of St. David with a canopy of four pointed arches, and in front four quatrefoil holes, into which the votaries put their offerings, which were taken out by the monks at two iron doors behind. In the choir are also the monuments of Owen Tudor, second husband of Queen Catharine, Rhys ap Tudor, Bishops Jorwerth and Anselm, in the thirteenth century, and Edmund, Earl of Richmond, father of King Henry 7th.

In a deep hollow beneath the town, sheltered from those winds which ravage this stormy coast, we found a few good houses appropriated to the ecclesiastical establishment, in the midst of which the cathedral appeared rising in renovated magnificence, like a phoenix amidst the splendid ashes of the ruined grandeur of St. David’s. This church is far superior to that of Llandaffe in its preservation, and has received ample justice from the attention and expence bestowed on it by its modern proprietors, the whole being in good repair, and the west front having lately been rebuilt in a taste perfectly corresponding with the rest of the structure. Its tower is finely carved in fret-work, and, like many of our English cathedrals, the Gothic ornaments of the choir contrast the Saxon pillars and arches of the great aisle, which are themselves curiously worked in wreaths. A ceiling of Irish oak also is much to be admired, together with a very perfect Mosaic pavement. Bishop Vaughan’s chapel lies behind the choir, where we were much struck with a highly wrought stone ceiling, similar to the finest specimens of Henry VII’s reign, with which all the surrounding ornaments of the building correspond. St. Mary’s chapel must have been still more elegant, from the curious remains of pillars and arches with which its space is strewed; various also and extraordinary are the devices in sculpture to be found there, including the heads of the seven sisters who were said to have contributed to the building. The chapter-house also has a fine coved ceiling, and St. Mary’s hall, now in ruins, exhibits the remains of much ancient grandeur. From the cathedral and these adjacent buildings, we visited the ruins of the bishop’s palace, which must formerly have been a magnificent, and even a princely structure. Two parts of its quadrangle are yet nearly entire, and these are crowned with a light Gothic parapet, similar to those at Swansea castle and Llamphey court. The arch by which we entered the king’s hall is singularly fine, with the statues of king John and his queen over it; the hall itself is a grand room, 88 feet in length by 30, and at its eastern end is a curious circular window, like a wheel, with a rim, spokes, and centre, wrought in the finest Gothic, and still quite entire. This room was built after the rest of the palace, for the reception of king John and queen Mary on their return from Ireland, being much larger than the bishop’s hall, which is notwithstanding a fine building. The chapel contains the remains of a font, with some pieces of sculpture, and the kitchen is nearly entire, with four chimneys and four arches, supported by a solid pillar in the middle.\n\nAfter devoting several hours to these fine remnants of antiquity, we ascended to the poor street which bears the title of a city, and found very moderate accommodation at the house dignified with the name of an inn.\n\nSaint David’s, said to have been a Roman station, was the seat of the primacy of Wales, transferred here from Caerleon by St. David in the sixth century. Its modern ecclesiastical establishment is highly respectable, consisting of the bishop, six canon residentiaries, four archdeacons, and several minor canons. The modern residence of the bishop, these splendid ruins being no longer habitable, has been transferred to Aberguilly near Caermarthen, a central part of his diocese, in a pleasant country. One of the canons is generally resident at St. David’s in rotation, where a handsome house is appropriated for his habitation, and the rest of the institution appear to be well lodged. Much praise is due to the establishment for the excellent repair in which the cathedral and those buildings which are still in use, are preserved; and the service of the church in this remote corner of the kingdom, where there are few to witness it, is conducted with a degree of decorum and attention which would put some of our proudest choirs in England to the blush.\n\nNothing, except the similar extremity of the Land’s end in Cornwall, can be imagined more dreary and desolate than the aspect of this country;\n\np. 160\n\nSt David’s ‘miserable place, dismal and dreary tract’\n\nSkrine, Henry, Two successive tours throughout the whole of Wales, so as to form a comprehensive view of the picturesque beauty, the peculiar manners, and the fine remains of antiquity, in that interesting part of the British island.

DAVIDS, now properly deserving the name of a Village, was rather more captivating than our walk before breakfast: it was occasionally enlivened by the prospect of the wide ocean, boundless to our view on one side, whilst before us the fantastic shapes of the rocks off St. David’s Head, exhibited Nature, in her most awful and striking attitudes.\n\nThe Cathedral, and dilapidated ruins of the episcopal Palace, are situated at the bottom of a steep hill, and scarcely visible in the town: these, and the prebendal houses, were formerly enclosed by a strong stone wall, with four gates, computed at eleven hundred yards in circuit. David, the national saint of Wales, with the consent of King Arthur, is said to have removed the metropolitan see from Caerleon to Menevia, which has ever since been called Ty Dewi by the Welsh, and St. David by the English. What was the condition and extent of this town formerly, it is difficult to say, having been so frequently destroyed. At present it is a very small city, and has nothing to boast but its ruined palace, and old cathedral, dedicated to St. Andrew and St. David, which has often been demolished; but rebuilt, in its present form, by Bishop Peter, according to Giraldus, in the reign of King Henry II.; or, as Willis, in the year 1110, in Rhos Vale, below the town. It is still esteemed a noble pile, consisting of two transepts, measuring in length, from east to west, three hundred feet; and the body with the aisles, seventy-six feet broad.\n\nBehind the choir is a most beautiful chapel, with a rich roof of carved stone, built by Vaughan, in the time of King Henry VIII., as a kind of presbytery, between the\n\nchoir and Lady Chapel. In the last, whose roof, as well as those of the aisles of the choir and transepts, have been down ever since the civil war, are monuments of three bishops, and in the nave, &c. four or five more. In the north wall of the choir is the shrine of St. David; a kind of altar tomb, with a canopy of four pointed arches, and in front four quatrefoil holes, into which the votaries put their offerings, which were taken out by the monks at two iron doors behind. In the choir are also the monuments of Owen Tudor, second husband of Queen Catharine, Rhys ap Tudor, Bishops Jorwerth and Anselm, in the thirteenth century, and Edmund, Earl of Richmond, father of King Henry VII. This last monument is said to have prevented King Henry VIII. from removing the see to Caermarthen. Giraldus Cambrensis, who was archdeacon of Brecon, canon of Hereford, and rector of Chesterton, Oxford, was buried here in 1213. On the north side of the church are some walls of St. Mary’s College, founded by Bishop Houghton, and John of Gaunt, in 1365, valued at one hundred and six pounds per annum. [quoted from Richard Gough’s edition of Camden’ Britannia.]\n\nIt is much to be regretted, that so little regard has been paid to the internal appearance of this noble pile; the whole of it has lately been white-washed, which gives it too much the air of a modern building: the external part, I am sorry to add, has been equally neglected; and the chapels and monuments exposed to the wanton mischief of boys and idle people.\n\nThe West front of the Cathedral has very lately been repaired by a Mr. Nash, who has endeavoured, with bad success, to imitate the beautiful circular window remaining in the ruins of the Bishop’s Palace. [This paragraph was excluded from the 1828 edition]\n\nThe stone, likewise, with which it is built, is of so soft a substance, that it even moulders with the touch of the finger; but possibly it may, by being exposed to the air, like the Bath stone, become more solid; and, when by time it shall have acquired a darker hue, may then better correspond with the original building.\n\nThe Bishop’s Palace now stands a monument of desolation; – and as we walked over the loose fragments of stone, which are scattered through the immense area of the fabric, the images of former times rose to reflection when the spacious hall stood proudly in its original splendor; when the long aisles of the chapel were only responsive to the solemn, slow-breathed chant. In this palace is a very long room, purposely erected for the reception of King John: at the extremity of it is a circular window, of very elegant and curious workmanship.\n\n{History – reference to Godwin and Mr Rees}\n\nThe walk to St. David’s Head, though barren, represents a view striking and awful; sublimity gives place to elegance: yet what is it to view? – a boundless waste of ocean; – not a glimpse of smiling nature, – not a patch of vegetation, to relieve the aching sight, or vary the objects of admiration. The rocks on this shore are shaken into every possible shape of horror; and, in many parts, resemble the convulsions of an earthquake, splintered, shivered, and amassed. On these rocks stood the famous rocking stone, or Ymean sigl; which, “though twenty yoke of oxen could not move it, might be shaken with the slightest touch.” We understood it was thrown off its balance, by order of the farmer, to prevent the curious from trampling on his grounds. “A mile strait west from St. David’s, betwixt Portclais and Porthmaur,” is the shell of Capel Stinen, St. Stinan’s or St. Justinian’s chapel.\n\nAnon, The Cambrian directory, or, cursory sketches of the Welsh territories, (Salisbury, 1800), pp. 50-53\n\nThis is not a guide book, but an account of a tour of Wales by two anonymous men in 1798 but it was published in several editions up to 1851 under different titles such as The Cambrian Tourist; Or, Post-chaise Companion Through Wales … (6th edition, 1828), pp. 83-88; (8th edition, 1834), pp. 89-95\n\n1801\n\nSt David’s Inn – Black Lion.\n\nSt David’s is situated in a"
