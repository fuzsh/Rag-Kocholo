Conclusion and Bibliography ps 339-357 Part One: The Incorporated Church Building Society and Wales: History and Themes This book is a celebration of voluntary effort. For 164 years, 1818-1982, the Incorporated Church Building Society (incorporated by Act of Parliament in 1828, ten years after it began as the Church Building Society) gave grants for the building in England and Wales of new churches and mission buildings of the Church of England, and for the rebuilding, restoration, repair, re-seating and enlargement of existing Anglican churches. All of its money came in voluntary donations from individuals, parishes, dioceses, legacies and trust funds. Not a penny was ever granted by any government. This is not a book of âbest churchesâ or, mainly, about the architectural or historical interest of these churches. It is about the relationship between a London-based organisation and the churches of Wales; as in England, more than half the Anglican churches of Wales applied for a ICBS grant at some point, many more than once ( Oystermouth near Swansea and Clynnog Fawr in Arfon five or six times ). The Society`s grants, ranging from Â£5 to Â£1,000 (this last only once, Â£500 the normal maximum) were never meant to pay for a project in full but to stimulate giving from other sources and reward local effort. The grants were about partnership in funding and were, for most recipients of grants, the only tangible evidence that The Church of England in Wales meant something nationally in practical terms; the parish, and sometimes the diocese, was for many applicants the limit of their horizon in terms of seeking help for their churches and the Society was their best hope of wider recognition and support. The ICBS had a national mission and encouraged the best aspirations of churches to be worthy buildings in which all who chose to attend could 4\n\nP:05\n\nbe seated without having to pay. The people who ran it were not elected or hereditary politicians, not bishops or senior clergy except as honorary trustees and patrons, not architects or builders, not aristocrats or plutocrats. Its running costs were modest and, as an operation it was, in the best sense, amateur; records and correspondence were hand-written until decades after the invention of the typewriter. It had paid officials, of course, and running costs, but it was and remained a charitable endeavour. It had no special access to the corridors of power, no special leverage on âthe great and the good.â It was, like the other organisations that came out of the traumatic time of the French Revolution and Napoleonic wars, such as the National Society created in 1811 (for educating poor children into the principles of the Established Church), a voluntary effort of public- spirited people which caught the imagination and inspired a response out of all proportion to its modest resources. The Early Years 1818-60 Its full name in 1818 was the Society for Promoting the Enlargement and Building of Churches and Chapels. After Incorporated was added in 1828, a parliamentary seal of official recognition, the work which its title defined continued, adding to its first tasks of building new churches and enlarging existing churches its own three âRsâ of restoring, rebuilding and reseating churches. This work continued until 1982 when its activities were absorbed into the Historic Churches Preservation Trust and then the National Churches Trust. Its end, however, as something to be subsumed into a conservationist-minded heritage body was emphatically not how it began; it was a missionary movement to provide soundly-built churches for everyone, in tiny hamlets and in industrialised districts, and to ensure that there would be room for everyone to attend without having to pay for a private pew or sitting, as was the case with so many seats in church. These were straightforward ambitions but far from simple to fulfil to the best effect. The Incorporated Church Building Society (henceforward I call it the Society or the ICBS) gave grants to slightly more than eight in ten applications which came from every diocese in England and Wales. Until 1920, the Church of England included Wales, in the Province of Canterbury. The disestablishment of the Church in Wales in that year made no difference at all to the Society`s work which continued uninterruptedly in the Principality, though with dwindling resources, through the post-war years of economic recovery and depression, WW2 and huge social changes; it also continued witnessing, in its reduced circumstances, to a steady decline in church attendance. The disendowment that accompanied disestablishment was also a grievous burden for the fledgling independent Church in Wales. The Society`s greatest period of activity was the second-half of the 19th century; that was especially 5\n\nP:06\n\ntrue in Wales as a response to the intense industrialisation of coal-mining and related works in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, and in north-east Wales. One of the themes of this book will be the determination of the ICBS to give Wales the fullest possible support within its means, and, overwhelmingly, Wales received far more from the Society than the total of any contributions sent in from Welsh parishes and dioceses in gratitude for help received and for the Society`s national work. A book was published in 2018 for the bicentenary of the foundation of the Society- Free Seats for All by Gill Hedley - but there are few references to Wales. There have been substantial articles on 19th century church building in different parts of Wales which have used some of the records of the Society, now preserved in Lambeth Palace Library in London, and there are unpublished theses on 19th century church building including Wales and the architects of Welsh churches and articles.[i] The scope of this book is to give a broad but focused account of the Society`s work and the separate identity of Wales has been ideal to express the range of churches supported: the hundreds of files encompass tiny rural parishes, market towns, the rapid growth of Merthyr Tydfil, Cardiff, Swansea and Newport , and the new populations in mining districts, including N.E. Wales, where many parishes had workers coming from England and changing the demographic dynamic. Doubtless many situations in English counties were different and unparalleled in Wales but there has been sufficient variety in the Principality to characterise the work of the ICBS in breadth and depth by studying the files in Lambeth. With the added piquancy that, in many Welsh locations, the Church of England was very much the under-dog, the minority institution in reality even if not in name, and in competition with vigorous expressions of Nonconformity, not least in the design and quality of the buildings, let alone the attendances. The Church of England in Wales was effectively in many places in a missionary position from the early 19th century onwards: in Llandaff diocese alone, in the period 1800-1850, Dissent (the Nonconformist churches and chapels) increased in strength by 900%, the Church by 16%.[ii]Another reason for looking at the Society`s work in Wales is that it was done without favour or prejudice; the people who ran it had few connections with the Principality to give it any special advantages, and there was no evidence of any prejudice against the Welsh language, indeed the opposite, as the responses to clergy who had to organise separate services for English and Welsh speakers will confirm. The committee`s pattern settled after the early years to nine monthly meetings a year, with clergy and laity represented, to consider applications with the Society`s advisers- its examining architects- having reviewed the proposals. In its first year, 1818-9, 145 applications were received by the Society. Eight were rejected. 90 were left pending and 47 grants totalled Â£13,807, from which spending 17,700 additional seats in churches were provided of which 13,459 were free of charge with no pew rents.It had 6\n\nP:07\n\nattracted Â£55,070 in donations and Â£582 in annual subscriptions. The King, George III, gave Â£1,000 in 1819; for its 50th year celebration in 1868 Queen Victoria gave Â£500.[iii] By the time of the second Annual General Court of the Society, in May 1820, 454 applications had been received and 254 grants made, totalling Â£63,122. By the end of its second year, 91,995 additional seats had been secured, those free totalling 69,295. By the mid-1820s it was getting 90-100 applications a year.[iv] The 8th annual report recorded 56 grants totalling Â£8,765 with 13,987 extra sittings and 10,649 of them free. Grants ranged from Â£1000 to Â£30 in these early years; the Â£1000 in 1819 went to St Clement`s, Worcester, which was regularly exposed to floods of the river Severn and needing much help, but the Wheatley Balme legacy to the Society did secure Â£1000 later in the century for one Welsh church: St Martin`s, Roath, Cardiff. The terms of that bequest were very restrictive; only churches with a seating of 700 or more could apply. Â£500 was normally the Society`s maximum. In fact, very large increases in seating for big churches were not the Society`s priority at first; however, already in the second Annual Report, church building and reseating at Wrexham parish church of St Giles had been listed as a medium-sized project in the same bracket as churches in Bath and Walsall and, among the early grants awarded in Wales, were Â£500 to Newtown St David in Montgomeryshire ( a project not completed for 28 years) and Â£350 to Pontypool St James, both in the first year, 1818.[v] Measuringworth.com, an internet website, calculates that Â£850 in 1818 would be worth Â£62,500 in 2019. Not a bad start for Wales. To give an idea of the scale of the operation: after the first year there were, from England and Wales, 96 applications and 64 grants in 1820; in 1821, 74 and 43.In 1840 there were 205 applications and 149 grants; in 1841, 181 and 145, and then through the 1840s and 1850s most years showed success for most applications. In 1851, 118 applications and grants for 117 and, in 1858, 127 applied and 124 were granted. In 50 years, 1818-1868, there were 5,233 applications and a successful outcome for 3,900. Perhaps applications were better prepared and understanding of the Society`s requirements more complete as its procedures became better known. In 1858 the grants total was, extraordinarily, almost the same as in 1819- Â£13,290- but it secured many more seats, 26,910 and 22,935 of those to be free. The annual report in 1832 confirmed an upward trend. Since 1818 it had given Â£148,860 and secured 225,224 additional seats of which 168, 298 were free. In Wales, by 1832 it had given Â£8,008 and secured 11,026 free seats; by far the biggest result was from St Davids diocese (Â£3215 and 4825 seats). The highest year for Society grants in England and Wales in this early period was 1840 with Â£24,997 and the lowest Â£8,765 in 1826. The 1840 summit for grants was also its apogee of additional seating in this period of 40 years: 51,010 additional seats and 35,143 to be free. Indeed, no figures could compare later as the bitter loss of the Society`s chief income, the Royal Letters, in 1854 started to take effect and was to be evident in 7\n\nP:08\n\nreduced grants. All these grants were given to a maximum of Â£500 for one church and to a maximum of one-quarter of projected expenditure: the society was the enabler and the stimulator of giving locally and nationally, not the sole provider. In its first years, the building of new churches was not its priority; that was the purpose of the Church Building Commission, the CBC, to use government funds from taxation for new churches. Two parliamentary grants, one for one million and another for half a million pounds, were the main parliamentary financial contributions to its work. The Commission worked on entirely different principles to the ICBS, even though several officials served both organisations. Its funds paid for new churches and often paid for the total cost of erection; the parishes did not have to raise money.[vi] Its first church in Wales, St Matthew`s, Buckley, in Flintshire was an example, built 1821-2 for Â£4,052, the entire cost paid. St David, Carmarthen, followed in 1835-6 with a Â£3,000 grant. The CBC worked on the principle of building for instead of with the local promoters of church building; this was its defining difference from the Society`s funding. Moreover, the Commissioner churches were for populations of 4,000 upwards; most churches in Wales in these early years did not meet this threshold. The purpose of the ICBS was completely different: it gave grants to stimulate or reward, sometimes both, the efforts of individual parishes to raise funds, most in the countryside and small towns. These were to be more practical and pragmatic projects, to restore, rebuild and, above all, to enlarge churches to provide more seating and for at least half that increased sitting to be free of charge. There was no minimum of size. Without any question, the ICBS`s foundational principles were longer lasting; once the CBC had spent the taxpayers` money- Â£1,500,000- it had little else to offer for buildings; the ICBS`s more modest grants complemented parish and diocesan fundraising and gave help to a vastly greater number of churches. In its own words, âits proper business was not merely to spend its money in a pious and charitable work but to stimulate the exertions of others, and by the promise of a contribution on its part, to render that easy, or at least practicable, which had perhaps been scarcely contemplated.â It had an âindirect and collateral influenceâ in stimulating others to give.[vii] Having left the creation of new churches mostly to the Commission, the ICBS took on funding new churches more frequently from the 1840s onwards as the former`s funding dried up. That said, the Commission did help build 34 new churches in Wales, and often in cooperation with the Society for grants but it funded no new churches after 1855. Moreover, free seating was not the priority of the Commissioners` churches: St George`s, Tredegar (1835-6) had 614 paid seats and 394 free; Nant-y-glo (1852-4) 216 paid and 319 free. There were different balances: St Thomas, Abersychan had 60 paid and 493 free but Aberdare parish church had no free seats while Mynyddislwyn was all free, but free seats was not a cardinal principle of the Commissioners. They did, however, have a crucial role in 8\n\nP:09\n\ncontributing to clergy stipends and there were later smaller grants from its residual funding, especially for chancel repairs. After the first flush of donors` generosity, the Society had to establish a regular source of income. Legacies were an irregular source; the momentum of private donation needed to be kept up and help from the dioceses was expected. It was âcalling into action extensive parochial and individual exertion,â to quote the first annual report. It had only Â£37,000 in hand after the first year. Its most successful source of funds, operating for 35 years, was the Royal Letter begun in 1828, authorizing collections of voluntary contributions in all churches in England and Wales. It produced an astounding Â£41,393 in that year although 1,256 parishes sent nothing at all. These letters had the monarch`s blessing and encouragement, and carried a weight of authority and commanded a respect hard to imagine now. There were eight such Royal Letters, mostly at three year intervals, until the final one in 1851 produced Â£25,342; in total Â£257,769 ( the equivalent of some Â£25-27 million pounds in 2019). The 1851 return was the lowest, a time of economic depression, but it was also the beginning of a crisis time for the Society as there were to be no more royal letters sent out inviting donations.[viii] The government of the Peelite, Lord Aberdeen, abruptly stopped their issue, summarily and inexplicably. About half the Society`s annual income was at a stroke withdrawn, the biggest single blow to the Society in all its history. Sir Robert Peel, who had been a lay vice-President of the Society, had died in 1850; although Gladstone described him as âa religious man (who) was wholly anti-church and unclericalâ it is hard to think he would have countenanced this but the Liberal administrations of Palmerston that followed did not restore them. The bishops responded with an Episcopal Letter which collected Â£15,338 in 1855 from 21 dioceses, two-thirds for the Society, one third for the diocesan society for church building and extension (which St Davids did not have until 1883). It did some good: in Bangor diocese, Â£225 was given to churches to secure 321 more seats and Llandaff spent Â£197 on buildings but no extra seats and St Asaph spent nothing that year. Nor had the Royal Letters always been very successful: Bishop Ollivant of Llandaff`s charge of 1854 pointed out that of 221 benefices in Llandaff there had been no response from 132 of them to the last Royal Letter of 1851. The need remained pressing; the annual report of the ICBS for 1860 had Cardiff heading the table of âunchurchedâ towns with populations of over 2,000; Rhyl was there with 2,500 but Cardiff was thousands ahead of any English town with 13,000.[ix] From 1855 on, the ICBS would always be struggling for funds having lost its royal patronage; bishops did not inspire the same generosity. For example, in 1862 the Society received Â£754 in donations, Â£12,286 in subscriptions, Â£1595 from diocesan associations following sermons preached for the Society`s funds, legacies Â£17,916, dividends on investments Â£2126 and rent of premises owned Â£300 = Â£25,508 total. 9\n\nP:10\n\nHowever, with irregular legacies representing two-thirds of income, the Society`s future was difficult. Moreover, in that year, the entire funding of the mission churches fund- for inexpensive buildings put up in colliery districts, mainly- had reduced to zero after paying out Â£1454 for 19 school churches, four iron churches and six mission houses. By 1864 unspent accumulations had been used up and the Society was compelled to reduce its grants drastically. 1864 was a watershed year; up to then, in 46 years, the Society had helped to add 1,284,595 seats in churches of which 962,886 were free. It was perhaps the Society`s finest statistic: not the number of new churches, or the repair and restoration of others, but the purpose which all church building served in their mission, viz. more seats in church and more of them to be free of charge. It was always a challenge: Llanbrynmair in Powys, as an example, in 1851 was a settlement of 1,980 but church room only for 170 and 46 seats were free. The goal was to increase the church seating and to make at least half of it free. By the end of the decade it had done both; total seating went up by 50 to 222 and only 36 remained appropriated. (file 5176). This was the sort of quiet success which made a difference. The Society had principles to guide its operation but not a strategy in which it took the lead. The Society regularly listed towns with populations over 2,000 that were unchurched or with very inadequate church provision. This might give the impression -indeed, it has been argued- that the Society was motivated to give most help where there was most population, as a simplistic formula. This was completely untrue, and the files will show its commitment to small village and hamlet populations as they applied for help. It could only respond to applications; the invitation was to all. It had no means of prioritising one district over another; churches had to make their own applications and they were handled in strict rotation of receipt at the Society`s office. Six rural parishes of a few hundred population each mattered as much as six new mining settlements: it was up to each church to apply. The fact that so many did, from small settlements, suggests that the Society`s efforts were recognised. Regional newspapers regularly publicised its work in awarding grants. There was liaison with the diocesan societies, and particularly with the last to be created in Wales, St Davids, and bishops were urged to promote its work and invite both applications and subscription contributions from parishes (once again, St Davids was by far the most active diocese to both apply and be given). The involvement or not of bishops could be decisive; the Society had its strongest advocate in Alfred Ollivant of Llandaff and its least interested in Thomas Vowler Short of St Asaph but parishes could apply on their own initiative, though this assumed an administrative and organisational skill that was not part of most clergy training. It was very much up to the incumbent, sometimes in partnership with a patron, and there are both heartening and saddening stories to tell. For each application, there was a file kept by the Society with forms, correspondence, 10\n\nP:11\n\nparish profiles, appeal letters, architects` plans and specifications; these are now lodged in Lambeth Palace Library with related material ( the Society`s journal Church Builder and its minute books especially important). Some files are missing, notably the records of mission-churches and buildings which are an unsung but essential part of understanding the ICBS` outreach. All ICBS files are indicated by reference number in this book, e.g., (265) means file number 265, the building of St Tydfil, Merthyr Tydfil, the first application from Glamorgan. These files are not digitised, unlike many of the church plans which can be viewed online, and have to be read in situ at Lambeth Palace Library. I am most grateful indeed to the staff there for their continued patience with my many requests as I have summoned from the reserves nearly 90% of the files from Wales. The parish profiles in particular are an invaluable source of social and economic information about parishes: for example, population figures, the range of employment, size of landed properties, church rate apportionments revealing the levels of wealth and the evidence of community fund- raising. There is enough material across hundreds of files of a thorough attempt to give a complete a picture as possible of the parishes` social composition and wealth distribution. Some incumbents may have exaggerated the poverty and undervalued the wealth of their parishes but most seem to have made a conscientious effort to record accurate numbers. None surpassed Rev John Kirkham`s analysis of the parish of Llanbrynmair in Powys in his doomed seeking of a grant for his proposed new church at Trefolwern, as we shall see. In my county references I use the historic 13 counties of Wales, alphabetically from Anglesey (Sir FÃ´n) to Radnor (Sir Faesyfed). Where some churches have changed historic county with boundary changes, I have indicated this. References to Society files on individual churches are given in brackets, e.g. the file on Llanbrynmair/ Trefolwern above is (6552). A growing population in England and Wales had reached over ten million in 1811 but it was thought there had been no increase in the number of churches since Norman times when there were two million people. The excess of population over church room was in excess of 2,500,000. The Industrial Revolution had wrecked the parish system and the Church was not adapting but Nonconformity was. Commentators at the time saw all this as a threat to public order rather than as a matter of moral welfare; religion was a bulwark against political excesses and public turbulence. Regular churchgoing reinforced political stability and social morality. Methodism was tolerable and Romanism to be viewed with suspicion but not a major threat; most important was to secure church accommodation in the large cities to secure social order. Political instability and insurrection- the fear of another Peterloo- might result from a lower class untutored by the restraining hand of the Established Church. For this purpose the Anglican parish system was hopelessly inadequate; the average church living in London included 9,490 people, in Lincolnshire 473.In Wales, the 11\n\nP:12\n\nlargest town in 1801 was Merthyr Tydfil with 8,000 people, and church provision for even a small fraction of that number barely existed. There was no co-ordinated church building programme, only in large towns a few proprietary chapels-of-ease which were for those paying pew-rents. Nor was there always a strong passion for creating new churches or enlarging existing ones; the status quo was preferred by many comfortably off. Nonconformist chapels were better able to manage new and splinter congregations; the Church had no coherent policy, just the conscience of individual landowners and industrialists. Many vested interests were against growth, notably clergy having to pay curates and the loss of fees to established clergy if a new parish was created; a new church was a threat to the market value of an existing church`s patronage and the parish vestry was afraid of a growing church rate bill. Many incumbents did not willingly surrender their surplice fees, tithes, endowments, glebe profits, pew rents and Easter offerings. It was all very well for Richard Watson, Dean of St Paul`s in London and non-resident bishop of Llandaff, like his successor Copleston (both lived in the London Deanery), to write to William Wilberforce in 1800 to propose free churches in London; the situation was worse in the diocese he seldom visited. There was a system called Church Briefs which sought to raise money in a haphazard way, an appeal to community goodwill. One such was a letter soliciting charitable giving in Newtown, Montgomeryshire, when, on April 26th 1719, 12s 7d was collected for the rebuilding of Dolgellau church, and the system was used for personal crises such as lost goods in shipwrecks. They proved too costly to administer, up to three-quarters of what was given consumed by administration costs and fees. In 1732, for example, for Llanddulas church in St Asaph diocese 9902 briefs or appeal letters were sent out and Â£649 was collected but Â£432 went on legal fees, patents, salaries for collecting (a stupendous Â£324). Briefs ceased in 1828 and were replaced by the triennial Royal Letters for the Church Building Society which continued until 1853/4. [x] The story of the ICBS is one of individuals. John Bowdler (1746-1823) was from Bromley, Kent, a wealthy conveyancer, and involved with missionary activity, notably the SPCK. He and three friends wanted churches for the people; they sent a letter to that effect to the Bishop of London in May, 1814. Dissenters could build conventicles fairly easily but not a tenth of the population could find a church near them or room in it to sit freely. This was followed up by a memorandum to Lord Liverpool, the Prime Minister, in 1815, signed by 120 laymen, building as it was hoped on the success of the launch of the National School movement. However, the Napoleonic wars had taken their toll and the government had to respond to the general cry for a remission of taxation. A Society for the Building of Churches and Chapels was mooted but it did not take off as a project until 1817 when a more definite idea of holding a London meeting took shape; a dinner at the London 12\n\nP:13\n\nFreemasons` Tavern, for example, had raised Â£1,500 for the London Hospital and something similar was planned for new churches. It found the right moment. Lord Liverpool backed it, and a cluster of the great and good combined including, above all, perhaps, Joshua Watson (1771-1855), a wine merchant and noted philanthropist who founded the National Society and was involved with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a fund for wounded of the Napoleonic Wars, and was a church commissioner. George Bramwell was Honorary Secretary. The Duke of York, Prince Frederick, agreed to be Patron; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Charles Sutton, was President. There were 25 vice-Presidents of ânoblemen and gentlemenâ and 26 committee members. A general meeting was held on 6th February, 1818, with William Cotton, Lord Kenyon, Sir Thomas Acland, Sir James Allen Park and Mr Bramwell. Within a short time a little over Â£50,000 was collected, half the projected minimum, and Â£340 in subscriptions, an amazingly successful beginning; it caught the right time. The treasurer was Charles Hoare and the family-named bank, Hoare`s, remained the Society`s bank for the whole of its life to 1982, fulfilling its purpose faithfully.[xi] From the start, it was realised that its funds would not of themselves accomplish but a fraction of the project but it would stimulate the exertions of others and âby the promise of a grant render more practicable projects which had scarcely been contemplated or indeed abandoned in despair.â They would hope to advance at most a fourth part of the estimated expense any church was contemplating. In 1818 it paid out Â£13,707. Preference would be given to parishes promising most of the seating to be free, with a minimum of half the seats to be free. Taking the model of Christ Church in Bath-âsimple, chaste, free from useless decorationâ-Bowdler hoped to achieve an eloquent simplicity: â it be a condition in every grant that no expense shall be incurred for ornamental architecture,â beyond, that is, what would be sufficient to impart âthe character of churches or chapels of the Church of England.â That character was to be hotly debated: an 18th century preaching-box with some classical dressing or a sacramentally-minded church with a chancel and prominent altar. The balance of population by 1818, the year of the Society`s foundation, was already shifting from rural to urban, and, in church terms, this presented a huge challenge, to provide worship centres in the towns of industry, mining and manufacture. The focus of English and Welsh church building had been hitherto not just predominantly rural but often very rural, with churches not always built in the largest rural centres but where patronage and the influence of the great landowners had dictated the sites, often in tiny settlements. In our story, it will be very telling to note that in 1820 the largest town in Wales was still Merthyr Tydfil and the early application for a new church there to meet the needs of an unchurched industrial population was a pastoral imperative to which the Society made a positive response.There was, from the start, a political element; in its first report of 1819 the Society saw its work as to promote 13\n\nP:14\n\nsocial peace and political welfare. The perils of Chartism in places like Blackwood in Monmouthshire, and what was interpreted as morally subversive Mormonism in Merthyr, Llanelli and elsewhere, were regularly proclaimed, as was the lack of social cohesion in industrial areas with so many labourers coming in from England. The rhetoric could be exaggerated as in John Wade`s The Extraordinary Black Book (1832) and, as late as 1840, Sir Robert Inglis was warning in his printed Address that where spiritual destitution existed, âthere prevail not only private vice and demoralisation, but political excesses and public turbulence.â The ICBS was not a conservationist movement. Its main purposes were twofold: to provide churches where they were needed - existing churches too small or in poor condition, new churches needed where urban and industrial settlements were concentrating - and to ensure that as many as possible of the seats in them would be free of charge or pew-rent. The former purpose is easier to understand; the latter will be a major refrain of this book and needs explanation. In its first task, the Society had many advantages. The ICBS never became identified with a particular Church party and thus benefited in receiving support from all sections of the Church of England. This was in contrast with other church organisations like the missionary societies and those seeking to provide more clergy where different expressions of churchmanship led to separate societies. After the Ecclesiastical Commissioners exhausted its Â£1.5 million grants, by the mid-1840s the ICBS had become the most important national source of finance for church building. It was based on voluntary offerings which were inevitably variable but proved more durable than a reliance on occasional parliamentary grants. Individually, its grants were moderate and its outlay relatively small but its prestige stayed high and its influence strong. It commanded considerable respect and its activities were regularly reported in regional newspapers; these can be accessed online and show a respectful appreciation of the Society`s national work, not just noting grants in the areas of the newspapers` readerships. For this purpose, Welsh newspapers online, accessed free through the National Library of Wales, have been an invaluable resource. It had, as its first Annual Report noted, âindirect and collateral influenceâ¦by awakening attention to the subject and calling into action extensive parochial and individual exertion.â Its focus was on the âless condensed and smaller divisions of the people,â in other words, local projects that involved community effort. The Society`s heart was in pastoral provision: in its first meetings Welsh churches were discussed in that spirit. Llanguick, near Pontardawe, had 3,000 people but room in church only for 350; a new church would provide 230 sittings and 200 free. Wrexham was mentioned early, by 1820, along with Bath and Walsall and âmany other populous places.â Llanelli had 11,000 people and church room for only 500, or 1 in 22 people, comparable with deprivation in Blackburn and Oldham. Within four years the Society had overall added 91,995 sittings to churches and 69,295 were free. By 14\n\nP:15\n\n1826, the eighth report revealed the average cost of providing a free sitting had been reduced from a guinea to eighteen shillings by prudent management. Within eight years it had spent Â£92,900 and provided 166,612 additional sittings, 94,254 of which were free. Again and again in the Society`s Reports, the needs of churchless populations were emphasised. Of the 18 new parishes of 2,000 or more people, hitherto without adequate church provision, Aberdare with 14,000 people easily topped the list with one small church-the old parish church of St John-accommodating 175 people. In 1852 the 34th report indicated that a new church in Cwm Rhondda was desperately needed for 2,639 souls, chiefly colliers, living six miles from the nearest church. In the same year, the list included Pont-y-rhun and, in the north, Rhosllanerchrugog in the Wrexham colliery area, as one of the largest unchurched communities with 3,733 people. The following year, Maesteg with 4,847 was noted. Substantial places like Holyhead, with 8,756 people, and Cyfarthfa, outside Merthyr Tydfil, with 8,397 people, were among the largest in England and Wales with pitifully inadequate church provision, often a decaying medieval church unrestored for generations. By 1826, in eight years, the Society had overall (England and Wales) added 126, 612 sittings to churches, and 94,254 were free; the average cost of providing a free seat had been reduced from a guinea to eighteen shillings by prudent management.[xii] By the early 1850s the Commissioners were aware that more new districts would have to be formed, created out of older parishes, to better organise the parish system â this had begun in Sir Robert Peel`s administration in the previous decade- and the Society was fully aware it would have to target its aid to churches in these new districts of distinctly increased , mostly industrialised, populations. Pews and church seating were the biggest single issues in many applications for reseating and the public cry for reform came loud and bold, beginning with The Ecclesiologist (from 1841) and continuing with The Church Builder (from 1862), the latter the Society`s own publication. Most church sittings at the start of our period were privately owned or rented. Family pews were appropriated- sometimes on the sites of suppressed chantries- with high backs, locks, fireplaces, glass windows, shutters and velvet upholstery. They were often huge enclosures capable of containing ten or twelve pews but actually only occupied by one family, satirized as âtwo or three lounging at opposite cornersâ. There were complicated plots to secure a private pew whenever one became vacant; they were sometimes leased by the year, if not bought outright, and were enclosed with doors, often locked, and admission controlled by hired retainers, satirized by Dickens and others as ânests of fashionable somnolencyâ with âwizen-face pew-openers, eager for stray shillings.â The Ecclesiologist gleefully reported complicated elections for vacant pew seats with every kind of personal rivalry in evidence. [xiii] Calling these old-fashioned pews âobsolete sleeping compartmentsâ, a rector of Llandegfan, John Williams-Meyrick, in 15\n\nP:16\n\n1883 demolished some pews in St Mary and St Nicholas, Beaumaris, belonging to the patron of the church, Sir Richard Williams-Bulkeley; the patron was more annoyed at their peremptory removal than the actual issue as he had indicated he would give up his own private pew provided all pews were free sittings but the rector had charged ahead without consultation.[xiv] It was easy to mock all this but we must acknowledge the dependency of clergy for their maintenance on pew-rents, in many cases making them dependent for support on their popularity as a preacher. âDomestic castles of John Bull`s selfishnessâ the pews often were. Exclusion of draughts was the only real practical defence of them. It is interesting to note Tractarian opposition to pews with doors; high-church ritualists they may have been, but their policy was to commend open benches with none paid for or reserved. This last point is important, as removing box pews did not in itself solve the problem of churches expressing within the social distinctions enforced in the world outside. It is also fair to point out that nearly all Nonconformist chapels charged for sittings as well, though usually rather less than churches; as with churches, the free seats were usually in the galleries. An analysis in a recent study (Bibliography 75, ps 346-7) indicates, perhaps surprisingly, that county percentages of free sittings as reported in the 1851 church census showed that in four Welsh counties at least half the seats in Anglican churches were free (Anglesey 53%, Caernarfonshire 47%, Cardiganshire 68% and Monmouthshire 49%); much of that would have been the influence of the Society and its grant-making conditions, that at least half the seats would be free. By the end of the century, the battle would be mostly won. In 1851, for the Church of England as a whole, 45.6% of places were free. It was a mixed picture in the âfreeâ churches; in those four welsh counties, none of these denominations (Independents, Total Baptists, Wesleyan, Primitive and Calvinistic Methodists) had more than 26% of sittings free in Anglesey; the average in Caernarfonshire was also 26%, in Cardiganshire 45% and Monmouthshire 60%. It is a staggering statistic that seat appropriation-paid seating-across all denominations on Census Sunday 1851 in England and Wales was 5,407,968, 53% of all sittings (ibid, p.325). After 33 years effort, the Society had made an impact but still had much to do. The appropriation of pews to individuals and families, with staves and padlocks, became the symbolic rallying focus of the Church Building Society- Free Seats for All-and with a distinct socio-political thrust. The few free seats were usually open benches in the centre of the aisle, often towards the back and under western galleries which deadened the sound. Even the Duke of Wellington was to describe family pews as âquite contrary to the system of Church Establishment.â [xv] The system was âexcluding almost all the lower classes and those most in want of instruction.â It relegated the poor, âforced into remote corners and recesses of the sanctuary.â Pews were defended as reinforcing âfamily valuesâ but the ICBS would have none of this. Kneeling was, however, greatly to be desired by the ICBS and either hassocks or 16\n\nP:17\n\nkneeling-boards were often enjoined as the conditions of a grant. William Butterfield, the architect, expressed a decided preference for the latter, illustrated with diagrams; hassocks, he opined, were soon soiled and messy; he also contributed some robust thoughts on the design of seats, as did other contributors to the Society`s publication Church Builder (April 1889, pp 77-82). There were proprieties to be observed; sitting in the chancel was âmumming and playing at sacred thingsâ, according to The Ecclesiologist, and chancel or nave seating north-south in collegiate chapel style was anathema. At least, by the first issue of Church Builder in 1862 (p.7) the Society could record that nine-tenths of new churches built under its auspices were free and that, from 4,365 churches helped, 895,526 seats were free, three-quarters of all church accommodation enabled. It was an uphill struggle to fight for free sittings: an article in Church Builder for 1863[xvi] by J.C., almost certainly Joseph Clarke, one of the Society`s consulting architects, expressed this frustration. The Society was correcting itself: high, square and panelled pews, and other very uncomfortable structures had been too long tolerated and given more occasion for sleeping than anything else. Too much cramming in of seats was no answer either but was practised to get more grant; 100 cramped seats got more grant instead of 90 comfortable ones. Examples of appropriate seating were kept at the Society`s offices for inspection. Up till 1876, grants were halved if chairs rather than fixed benches used but this was not insisted upon thereafter. The main emphasis was on not turning one`s back to the altar, as would happen in a four-sided box pew. Open benches would give more seats. Low backs to the seats were demanded and a central east-west alley required in the nave. Attention to children is interesting to note- 20â for adult in width and 14â for a child; seats exclusively for children may be 24â from back to front, adults 30â. The Society was one of the first church organisations to recognise the different needs of children`s seating in churches. Social stratification was still at the heart of seating arrangements but the ICBS was the first to take a public stand, well ahead of others, notably, from 1866, the Incorporated Free and Open Church Association, and supported from the start by The Ecclesiologist in its attack on âcastles of selfishness.â[xvii] In 1863 Joseph Clarke noted that the âcold selfishness of the past gradually gave way toâ¦a revived belief that all are equal in God`s house.â Pews had become easy and âcomfortable nooks formed for no other purpose than to encourage sleep.â Religion was in danger of becoming âa purely middle-class propriety or luxury.â But do not go, Clarke advised, to the opposite extreme and so cramp the space that services cannot be followed and the proper posture of devotion prevented. Three feet from centre to centre of seats was ideal; at under two feet ten inches the cramming began. At Eglwysfach (8596) the building in 1818 had not solved the pew problem; farmers put up box square pews-long and short- high and low- in different colours, âunsightly 17\n\nP:18\n\nand ruinous for devotion.â Success in applications required evidence of the âgreatest extent of free sittings.â The application form for grants required seat dimensions and the Society`s preferred dimensions were rigidly enforced. Two illustrations at this point may be helpful. It is deeply ironic that, towards the end of the Society`s life, a grant (13020) was secured in 1951 for Worthenbury church in the detached portion of Flintshire known as English Maelor. The striking fact is that such an old- fashioned arrangement for pew seating in boxes with doors, however pleasing the polished woodwork is to the eye, was absolutely opposed by the Society from its foundation; it offended against all its equalising principles to render the House of God a direct challenge to the way the world was socially divided. However, the church`s social ordering had survived, never seeking a Society grant which would have been refused. Conservation arguments had long since begun to influence grants and from c.1870 the Society was inclined to give grants to protect historic features where possible. This element of conservation principles influenced many late 19th century applications and onwards, and represented a distinct change of emphasis. Worthenbury remains a wryly paradoxical example; towards the end of the ICBS`s existence, here was conservation support for something the Society had set its face against from the start. Of course, by the mid- 20th century, the sittings were not appropriated and the box pews kept for their period charm. To reinforce the irony further, replacing box pews with open benches did not in itself secure equality in seating; there are the 18th century deal benches at Llangelynnin in Meirionnydd (not to be confused with the church of the same name in the Conwy Valley) with the names of the local farms (many still in existence) painted on them; what they had paid for, they claimed. ( Note the medieval doom wall painting of a skeleton at the rear, concealed by plastering for generations but exposed more recently).The survival of these rare 18\n\nP:19\n\npainted-name benches was a contributory factor in securing Grade One listed status for this church in recent times and thus the probability of grant assistance. The remedies for the lack of church room were obvious; new churches, rebuilding of existing churches and rearrangement of furnishings. Obvious too, though, was the cumbersome system of civil and ecclesiastical law governing these procedures. Opening a new place of Anglican worship often required parliamentary statute; it took six acts of parliament between 1770 and 1818 before the handsome church of Thomas Hardwick at Marylebone in London could be built; the Additional Churches Act of that year complicated matters further with parochial boundaries and endowments. The conventicles of Dissent could be built as cheap preaching-boxes. Paying for these new Anglican churches was another matter. An historic method was the church rate system, a levy on every property in the parish by the local vestry meeting, as though it was assumed that, regardless of religious affiliation, if any, everyone of means in the parish would contribute to the upkeep of the parish church as a community duty. Many clearly did not so wish: they might contribute to highways, vagrancy provision and the relief of poverty as community obligations but not to places of worship they did not attend. Church rates still worked in many places where a community sense of identity prevailed but if Nonconformity was strong, as in industrial Wales, or if the local landowners were Roman Catholic (a few in Wales, e.g., at Holywell in Flintshire) the Church of England could expect little support. At Colwyn Bay, the entire town was created and controlled by a Methodist building company in Manchester which spent Â£13,000 on a handsome church of its own persuasion, St John`s, now Rydal School chapel, but refused to give a penny to the building of St Paul`s parish church (9144). The overwhelming progress of Dissent went almost unchallenged by Church authorities until far too late. By 1851, 86% of the population of Wales could attend reasonably conveniently a place of worship- 68% at a chapel, 18% at the Established Church.[xviii] The very lack of diocesan structure gave a freedom of manoeuvre to the chapels which could be built quickly as daughter foundations from parent congregations without either episcopal permission or a landowner`s or proprietor`s bounty. New churches, by contrast, threatened vested church interests: clergymen feared they would lose income if they had to pay for additional curates, fees for occasional offices would be lost and new churches would mean more burden on the church rates. Church rates could always be blocked by dissenters and atheists; the system had little enforcing capacity. Moreover, a building was of little use without an endowment to pay for a minister, and this problem was to recur several times in the applications recorded in this book. Without a formal consecration of the church by a bishop, which went hand-in-hand with endowment, a new church might be stymied from the outset by an insecure provision for the cost of ministry. The Society would refuse a grant if a church was 19\n\nP:20\n\nnot consecrated or endowed; it could have little hope of surviving without these protections of status and income. This affected even well-connected churches: the now-closed St Seiriol, Penmaenmawr- so named as it looked across the Menai Strait to the shrine of St Seiriol at Penmon Priory on Anglesey-failed to get a Society grant for this reason of lack of endowment, even though the church was well-supported by the Prime Minister and doughty churchman, W.E. Gladstone (file 6379). The farming out of churches to often poorly trained curates by non-resident clergymen was a well- known abuse. One of the scandals of the 18th and 19th century church was the number of licences granted for non-residence of the priest; he could live far away, often in England, yet enjoy the revenues of his clerical freehold, perhaps paying a pittance to curates to do the parish work. This was the case at Dolfor, near Kerry, in Powys where even the saintly Alfred Ollivant drew the emoluments of office but resided at the time of ICBS application as a Professor at St David`s College, Lampeter, a paid curate taking the services (file 2240). So too was the reliance on an exclusionary system of pew rents another abuse. Income for the Society flowed in from appeals to the great and the good of the time, but what was special about the Society was its appeal to parishes; pennies were valued as much as pounds for the sense of participation. This was not to be a matter of getting a small group of benevolent wealthy people to pay for everything which, as we shall see, was favoured by one crusted Tory of a bishop (Thomas Vowler Short of St Asaph at the 1865 Annual Court of the Society); parishes were to be encouraged to raise money themselves and have their efforts matched or supported by ICBS funding. This will be a major theme in this book. The Society wanted to encourage parish efforts to raise money-a penny bazaar was as valuable for its participatory involvement as the squire sending in a big cheque- and we shall see some remarkable examples from the grass-roots of poor parishes. The church establishment was far too often complacent in relying on wealthy patrons to provide the money. Some did, of course, and not a few of Wales` iconic churches, e.g., the âMarbleâ Church at Bodelwyddan, near St Asaph, were entirely paid for by private patronage (in this case, Lady Willoughby de Broke and the cost Â£35,000) and never needed the Society`s help. In Flintshire alone, nine new churches were built in the High Victorian era, all patron-funded. As we shall see, the diocese of St Davids, the last of the Welsh dioceses to establish a church building or extension society (in 1883, the others 50 years earlier- St Asaph 1834, Bangor 1838, Llandaff 1845), took this principle to heart in the later 19th century and no other diocese in Wales (and not very many more in England) could match St Davids for the numbers of parishes organising collections for the Society in the last quarter of the 19th century. This evidence of parish commitment to raise money, however little, was an enlightened sign of participation in fundraising, and added much to people`s sense of involvement in a project. Churches built by wealthy landowners and patrons usually 20\n\nP:21\n\ndid not need to apply to the Society except for later repairs; the vast majority of those who were helped had made efforts to raise money but were short of their total. There were few alternatives for hard-pressed parishes: loans for church repairs could be obtained from the Public Works Loan Commission but for a hefty 4% interest charge. The Society`s grants in many cases made the difference: both in the actual sums given, which started high in the first forty years and diminished thereafter as the Society`s income reduced, and in the encouragement of others to give, inspired by the Society`s example. The Society commanded a high reputation and its imprimatur or seal of approval often inspired more giving from those who trusted its recommendations. This first period, 1818 to 1860, was one of relatively generous grants, spending the money as they got it, but was also, unfortunately, not a great era for the professionalism of the architect`s calling. The diffusion of awareness of these grants seems to have been remarkably rapid and, within a few years, applications for grant were coming from all parts of Wales. The Society formulated two series of notes for applicants and these formed the bedrock of the grant-making progress. The Society knew it could not send out architects to the four corners of England and Wales to inspect churches, so they issued two sets of suggestions to churches in 1819 and 1842 so that they could make focused applications, based on detailed forms with supporting documentation, that would stand a chance of success. There were always the vagaries of the post; letters frequently went astray, postage of architects` plans to the Society`s offices in London was frequently complained of as very expensive and Welsh place-names and postal addresses sometimes defeated the postal system. One of the saddest examples was the first Denbighshire application, from Llanynys near Ruthin; this was a large church with only a middle-ranking tenantry to support it, but it had ambitious plans, with a spirited local effort, to create a gallery for singers (186). This very early application indicates awareness of the Society`s grant offers had spread to remote country districts surprisingly quickly. There was, however, another Llanynys, near Builth Wells in Breconshire, to which the Society`s reply was unfortunately delivered and where the obtuse incumbent declared, in returning the file to London, that the Society had made a dreadful mistake and there was no other Llanynys in the Principality. Nothing more was done; the Denbighshire church must have thought it had been turned down. It did eventually get a grant, for another application, in 1939 (12449), 120 years later. The Society`s Suggestions and Instructions The first document was published in 1819 as Suggestions from the Society for Promoting the Enlargement and Building of Churches and Chapels; for the Consideration of Persons engaged in such undertakings and reflected the common sense of the time: churches were to be built on well-drained sites, off main thoroughfares, elevated but not on high points, vaults provided for coals and stoves, 21\n\nP:22\n\ndurability in walls more to be valued than beauty, brick walls 1 ft 10 and half ins minimum and thicker if cased with stone. Tie-beams, an early ICBS sine-qua-non which they clung to for a long time, were to be placed at the foot of principal rafters; roof trusses were never to be more than 10` apart; lead was the most durable roof covering, slates the next best, and to be laid on battens not boards. Gutters and pipes to be set at least two inches from the wall were never to be replaced by dripping eaves; the lead used for gutters should be 8lbs to the foot-this was a constant refrain in the Society`s strictures. Chimneys, if used, were to be concealed in pinnacles. Allowance should be made for the future rise of the surrounding burial ground; many church floors originally above ground were now below, and had become damp and unwholesome. Windows were not to resemble modern sashes but, whether Grecian or Gothic, were to be in small panes. Copper gutters could be fixed to the bottom of lead lights to receive condensation with copper tubes to convey the same. Fresh air could be brought in through under-floor pipes and foul air expelled through channels near the roof. Heating was to be from stoves in vaults. Domes and coved ceilings were anathema as causing echo sound; wood ceilings were better for the voice than plaster. No square, round or double-pews should be allowed; all should see and hear the minister. No part of the congregation should turn their back on the altar. Gallery seating needed to be flexible whether for children or the elderly. Seats were to be 17- 20â deep by 28-35â wide. Attention was paid to children`s seats, a notable first.[xix] The most approved church designs were a parallelogram and an octagon; a polygon would bring a large congregation nearer to the preacher than any other design except a circle which was condemned for destroying clarity of sound. ( Polygons were also recommended by John Wesley but none appeared to be used in Wales, except sometimes a semi-polygonal apse.) Pulpits should be placed centrally and preferably be on the angle of the north wall and chancel. Ornament internal and external was to be neat and simple - ânone preferable to the simplest Gothicâ though Grecian Doric could be allowed. Galleries were allowed in spite of the Society`s reservations about how they reinforced class divisions. This first set was a basic statement; simple Gothic and columned Grecian were not going to be guiding principles for long. All these suggestions were for new churches; they had no confidence to declare principles for restorations as all would depend on circumstances. As yet, there was little recommendation of specific medieval Gothic forms; the main concerns were maximum seating and maximum audibility. The first Suggestions were mainly for new churches, and, as Basil Clarke identified, emphasised four virtues: conveniency, decency, economy and durability.[xx] These guidelines worked for 24 years. The Act of Incorporation in 1828 added to the Society`s functions an ability to make grants towards the repair of existing churches, to compensate for the abolition of the system of church briefs which had, very inefficiently, addressed this problem. âand repairingâ was added to the Society`s title 22\n\nP:23\n\nas well as the word âIncorporated.â However, whether a new church or a repair or rebuild or enlargement of an existing one, the same principles of consent of patron, incumbent and ordinary, and of half any additional seats secured to be free, still applied. The second set of Society recommendations was issued in May, 1842, with a firmer emphasis as Suggestions and instructions. [xxi]By then there had been a definite advance in architectural and theological thinking about what a church should look like, within and without. The Cambridge Camden Society was in its stride, founded in 1839 and later known as the Ecclesiology Society, and architectural societies had been formed with informed opinion about church building in more plentiful evidence. The Oxford Architectural Society, for example, argued that walls of new churches should be of rubble not brick and that the tedious insistence on tie-beams to all roofs was simply inappropriate. The vague recommendation of Gothic forms in 1819 was sharpened up. The Society published its amended Suggestions and Instructions in both The Ecclesiologist in 1842 (a journal which continued monthly to 1868 and was the voice of High Victorian ecclesiology) and The Builder in 1846, the latter a very major Victorian publication, crammed with detail. Between 1819 and 1842, the two sets of the Society`s Suggestions, church architecture changed: out went vague references to Gothic and out went a tolerance of pretence such as the use of cast iron with plaster as columns and concealment of chimneys in pinnacles. It was very different by 1842: Gothic was not a dressing but a foundational principle, a deliberate effort to reproduce the constructional and artistic formulae of medieval churches: âNo style seems more generally suitable for an English church than the Gothic of our own country, as developed in its successive periods.â Early English, Middle Pointed or Decorated or Perpendicular: these were the approved forms. The Lord`s Table was to be raised two or more steps above the chancel floor, itself to be raised a step or two above the floor of the nave. The reading pew was not to be unduly elevated and neither it nor the pulpit were to obscure the view of the altar. Gothic was not a âdressâ; it was a form of construction, in particular a form of medieval construction, that was to be emulated in a contemporary idiom. In particular too, a church was to have a chancel if it was to be a church at all; otherwise, it was a preaching box, a simple parallelogram. With the creation of a proper chancel flowed much else: a respect for the sacramental, a raised chancel and a raised altar with room for a choir and observances of ritual. This was in conformity with the principles revived by the Oxford Movement, inaugurated in 1833, and the Cambridge Camden Society, which elevated the altar above the pulpit. Ecclesiology now ruled. Norman or Romanesque was, nevertheless, acceptable as a design, especially if brick was to be used, and the 1830s and 1840s witnessed an unexpected revival of Romanesque design but High Victorian Gothic triumphed by the 1850s. A single rectangle would suffice for a chapel or small church, the length being at least 23\n\nP:24\n\ntwice as great as the breadth. A building to be enlarged later, as funds permitted, was allowable. For foundations, concrete was recommended in all irregular or doubtful soils. The footings could be spread on each side to prevent partial settlements. No graves were to be within 20ft of the wall. A paved open area at least 18â wide, built around the church and sunk in below ground level with a drain to carry water away, would render the church drier. Crypts, if required, must be of massive construction entered only from without. Wood floors where there were sittings and open spaces, and chancel floors to be of stone or encaustic tiles. Stone work could be filled with up to 18âof rubble, flints or slack to prevent damp. The church floor should be raised at least three steps above the ground floor. Brick if used for walls had to be cased with stone or flint well bonded into the brick. Buttresses were to be placed opposite the trusses or principals of the roof; no buttresses meant greatly thicker walls. Stone facings filled with rubble were acceptable if bonded well. Whatever the material, dressings must invariably be of stone. Lead for the roof had to be 7lbs minimum to the foot, preferably 8lbs. Slates, if used, had to have copper nails, quite an expense. Flat ceilings were inconsistent with Gothic architecture. Next to a stone vaulted roof the best effect internally was an open roof exhibiting the timbers. A wooden panelled roof, if used, should be made to imitate stone. Horizontal tie-beams were no longer essential. If principal truss distances exceeded ten feet, intermediate trusses must be introduced. The distance between common rafters should never exceed 12â. Where timber ends were lodged in the walls they should rest in cast-iron shoes or on stone corbels. Windows not stained should be in diamond panes. Hopper casements in all windows would improve ventilation. Sacramental principles were given a direct focus: the altar was to be raised two or more steps above the chancel floor which in turn was to be one or two steps above the nave floor. Rails should extend across the chancel, and, where not provided, no seats be allowed between the rails and north and south walls. The font was to be at the west end and near the main entrance but not under a gallery. A reading-pew and pulpit were to be placed to cause the minimum obstruction of the view of the east end from the body of the church. Pulpits should not be placed centrally; they should be on the angle of the north wall and the chancel. No seat must have its back to the altar. There must invariably be an open central passage up the whole length of the church. No square, round or double pews were allowed and there should be as few pews as possible; open seats with backs would increase the accommodation greatly The Cambridge Camden Society in its A Few Words to Church Builders (1841) had urged open wooden seats or chairs as pews (or pues) were a cause of unmixed evil.â Galleries were discouraged but not actually forbidden, a more pragmatic approach than that adopted by the strict Ecclesiologists. Galleries tended to be used to relegate the poor aloft while the ground floor was often full of private pews. Seats should be three feet wide if possible but two feet six inches was allowed; height should be two 24\n\nP:25\n\nfeet eight inches. Twenty inches in length for adults and fourteen for children; seats exclusively for children could be twenty-four inches from back to front. The attention paid to children`s seating here is remarkable, and some of the most favoured applications for grant paid particular attention to children`s needs. An important ecclesiological emphasis was changed; in 1819 there was a requirement for seating to focus on the pulpit but in 1842 there was a stronger insistence that no sittings have their backs to the altar. It was not until Joseph Clarke`s article of 1863 in Church Builder that much attention was paid to the actual comfort of seats. These principles of seating were codified in new instructions printed as a detailed set of rules as part of this article by one of the Society`s Honorary Architects, and followed the next year by a shorter article on chairs. The 1842 advice was reinforced. Chairs were recommended for filling difficult spaces and providing additional seating at lower cost but it was acknowledged that chairs were not popular. The Committee of Architects The development of a committee of architects was to be a huge leap-forward in professionalism and corporate standards. In the early years, with so much to do, and so many applications coming in with resources only just ahead of pledges of grant, the Society felt some basic principles should be established as it did not have the resources or networks to conduct appraisals on the spot. Travelling to Welsh parishes would have been exhausting and costly, and frustrated the efforts to employ the best architects, besides the relative poverty of so many parishes faced with professional fees though the Society did not charge for its own inspections; the early death of the promising architect Charles Buckeridge was perhaps hastened by his frequent visits from Oxfordshire to the remoteness of Powys to supervise restorations of impoverished churches.[xxii] The first years of the Society coincided with the slow emergence of the professional status of the architect as distinct from surveyor and builder. The first certificate forms to be produced for grant payment were to be signed by the minister, three principal inhabitants and the âsurveyor employed in the work.â The word âarchitectâ emerged in the 1820s on application forms. There was no attempt by the Society to make connections with surveyors and architects, or recommend them; it was up to parishes- the incumbent and churchwardens usually- to commission professionals to produce plans, specifications and estimates, in tactful liaison with the principal landowners. The Society`s role was to approve or reject plans, not to indicate a choice of designs. In the first instance, the examining architects employed by the Society had to decide whether plans were structurally sound and many were not. Then, as Basil Clarke has observed, there were four criteria: conveniency, decency, economy and durability. The first such permanent examining architect was Joseph Henry Good (1775-1847), also surveyor to the Church Building Commissioners, and a former student of Sir John Soane. He was appointed in 1829; for its first eleven years the Society relied on 25\n\nP:26\n\nits committee and consultant advice to test whether proposals were acceptable. The Suggestions of 1819 were just that and more directed to new structures than enlargements of existing buildings. Good was not, despite his credentials, a distinguished architect; Armourers and Braziers Hall in the City of London is a modest neo-classical building by him and his church in Pembrokeshire, St John the Baptist in Slebech, built 1838-40 but closed since 1990, is a heavy Early English lancet church with minimal chancel and a timbered west gallery showing little sense of Ecclesiology and inelegant pinnacles outside. Good was an unfortunate choice for the Society; his comments on plans submitted are very brief and frequently illegible and seemed to concentrate on a mechanical repetition of strictures on the thickness of walls, any dangerous roofing systems and the want of means to let condensation flow away. The Suggestions were, however, a great deal better than nothing and as Sir Kenneth Clark noted, were an improvement on fanciful Gothic like Fonthill Abbey. [xxiii] There was still a sense that church was essentially a preaching house with perhaps a distinguishing steeple, with minimal attention to the sacramental principles of a chancel and raised altar. The emphasis was on plainness and cheapness, and securing the maximum seating with maximum audibility. As Richard Yates noted in 1815, âThe Clergyâ¦are no longer the Ministers of an External Ceremonial, in which the people were little more than Spectators. The Liturgyâ¦must be heard and understood by them.â[xxiv] There was nothing scholarly about this early understanding of medieval Gothic. Too many box-like conventicles were allowed with a wretched steeple, porticoes, balustrade and imitation of pointed forms. Tightly set buttresses, high pinnacles, entrance bays left and right of the tower, long and thin windows, and a short or non-existent chancel were no more than Gothic âdressâ for the parallelogram. A committee of architects was formed- Minute Book XIII 16 April 1848- to inspect plans.[xxv] The Society bore the cost of a survey if an architect was employed, by the applicant if a local builder was presenting the plans. The committee of eleven included well-known architects G. Gilbert Scott, Thomas H. Wyatt and Benjamin Ferrey, all of whom worked in Wales. In 1870 there were twelve: those three mentioned still there with G.F. Bodley, David and Raphael Brandon, G.E. Street, E. Christian, Jos Clarke, J. St Aubyn, J.H. Hakewill and J.L. Pearson. Quite a roll-call of distinguished names and nine did significant work in Wales. They were assigned geographical areas. Already the Society was aware that many old churches were being needlessly demolished and alterations were often executed by unskilful persons. The committee of architects` brief was to prevent improper alterations and, when possible, to inspect sites so that no alterations to plans were being carried out âas frequently occurs.â The scheme was an immediate success, as the 31st Annual Report noted: âmany ancient structures...are preserved, which else might be grievously injured, or entirely destroyed, through the inexperience of those interested 26\n\nP:27\n\nin their restoration, for want of professional advice.â As early as 1849, conservation arguments were becoming important, and this critical note continued, with sharp comments on âspending much money in the carrying out of very unworthy designs.â[xxvi] Church Builder Vol XXXIII in January 1870 reported how the system worked, in this case a rejected application for a new church at Ryde, Isle of Wight. The case went to law, so the Society had to explain its procedures. One committee member would make an original report on an application, a second would review and initial, and the decision would be made by four members of the architects` committee so, if a serious proposal as here for a new church had been turned down, it would have been the decision of six architects. The architect opined that the Society should simply have paid an architect Â£50 to pronounce one way or the other; the Society retorted that all six architects gave their services for free. The architects` committee was the single biggest step the Society took after its founding to secure the professional integrity of its work. It was high time, as many new churches sponsored by the Society had been of deplorable quality and old churches mutilated badly. As Mr Beresford Hope stated baldly, for its first 20 years the Society had stood sponsor for âsome of the most horrid monstrosities in the shape of churches whichever disfigured art.â The concern was âto prevent the destruction of any building worthy of being preservedâ; here was positive affirmation of confirmation principles. Many churches so liberally assisted by the Society were a standing reproach to good taste and others hopelessly mutilated.â Standards had been improved.[xxvii] The architects included, as time went on, some of the best architects of the mid- to- late Victorian era and an increasing number working in Wales. They were assigned geographical areas. They gave their time voluntarily to go through submissions sent to the Society. Bodley, Street, Scott and Pearson were amongst the greatest of Victorian architects; their vast collective experience across England was of immeasurable help when considering Wales. Four members in rotation attended monthly meetings to consider applications. If one was absent, unavoidably or not, they fined themselves voluntarily for non-attendance, an extraordinary step. They took no remuneration. Their priorities were to save features of architectural or antiquarian interest, or indeed whole sections of churches, from being needlessly rebuilt. Conservation was a key principle; unnecessary destruction was all too common. Unworthy designs were to be weeded out at an early stage. In some cases, one of the committee would go to inspect- no easy task. Reports were given in writing to the ICBS officials. To keep up the standards of ecclesiastical architecture was the goal but a note of caution was sounded; there was a related discussion of the creation of fabric funds which, though laudable, might encourage unnecessary repairs on âbeautificationsâ and money spent simply because it had accumulated. The 27\n\nP:28\n\nâchurch-wardenisingâ of generations to come was a peril to avoid; power to spend money was to be exercised wisely. Money was spent. The committee`s work for approved applications for April 1869- March 1870 was recorded in Church Builder and outlined at the Annual Court for 1870. The Society had overseen, since 1818 and over 52 years, spending on 5,618 churches, 1,532 of them new and the rest for rebuild, restoration or enlargement. 1,480,078 additional seats had been added, of which 1,217,147 were free. A total of Â£770,528 had been given by the Society and 66 mission churches also aided. The issue for July 1871 confirmed the trend: in 1970-1 another 127 grants had been made, another 32 new churches supported and another Â£6,185 granted. Architects` recommendations continued to be a vital channel connecting parishes to the Society`s main management committee: five was the quorum for the latter, meeting up to nine times a year. Issue XXXIV (April, 1870) ps 38-40 of Church Builder outlined the principles explained above: an example of its settled way of working was given in issue LXV (January 1878) pp 5-9. Building and Restoration, Enlargement of Churches and Mission Churches were the three emphases that day. In the first category were five new churches, four rebuilds and sixteen restorations. The pastoral priority was the unchurched areas, notably the new coal-mining districts which were either lacking churches or using mission buildings offering insufficient room. Attention was paid to architectural and antiquarian interests where they were outstanding, such as Aston, near Ludlow, a Norman gem which then and now had fewer than 200 people resident. Dire reports came from Lincolnshire of churches with boarded windows and deluging water-ingress and, tragically, a church in Truro where the vicar had plunged to his death from the inadequate scaffolding while inspecting rotten timbers. Mission churches were considered; in this case, in communities, post- industrial even by 1877, where the coal seams had been exhausted and population and prosperity gone elsewhere, leaving depressed communities that needed active mission churches for fellowship where âthe people are deteriorating and getting more degraded daily.â That afternoon`s list of projects would cost Â£119,200 to complete; there was a deficiency of Â£56,366 to meet but the Society could afford to grant only Â£3,264 that month. Though no Welsh applications were considered that month, the principles held true for them as they arose, and there was no sparing of detail. Several architects became associated with regions of Wales. Here, alphabetically, are the main ones noted in these pages; there were significant others such as W.E. Nesfield in Clwyd to be mentioned for individual churches in the county sections.[xxviii] Edwin Lingen Barker (1838-1917) of Hereford and London; he also had an office in Tenby and profited from that connection in a large number of Pembrokeshire restorations and rebuilds. 28\n\nP:29\n\nSir Arthur Blomfield (1829-99) was diocesan architect of Winchester and architect to the Bank of England. Swansea St Mary was his most significant Welsh church. G.F. Bodley (1827-1907) a pupil of G.G. Scott for 5 years and then stayed with him until 1856, setting up a practice with Thomas Garner, 1869-97. St Germans, Roath, and St Saviour`s, Splott, were his two great Cardiff churches aided by the Society; he did significant work at Beaumaris St Mary in 1902, not Society-aided. Charles Buckeridge (1830-73) a pupil of G.G. Scott, he practised in Oxford and London and was active in Breconshire especially, with some ventures into Glamorgan and Pembrokeshire following his clerical mentor Gilbert Harries; he died young at 43 and J.L. Pearson finished some of his churches. William Butterfield (1814-1900). His finest church in Wales is the magnificent St Augustine, Penarth, but not Society aided. He made at least two visits to Ceredigion in 1860s where he was involved at Llangorwen, one of the first Ecclesiological churches in Wales, began the Welsh church of Aberystwyth, St Mary, but fell out with the incumbent and did not finish the work or become involved at Llanbadarn Fawr as expected, but his masterpiece in the county was the remote St Peter`s, Elerch (Bontgoch) where he responded to an exposed site with a toughly assertive exercise in complex geometric lines in a unique and challenging way. William D. CarÃ¶e (1857-1938) grew up in Ruabon, spent 5 years in Europe, and served his articles with J.L. Pearson, becoming independent from 1883. Architect to the Church and Ecclesiastical Commissioners from 1895, and an important influence in the Society`s committee of architects, on the side of unobtrusive restoration. He built only one new church in Wales at Llangammarch Wells, which was unfinished, but both accomplished and counselled sensitive restoration in many churches. His major work was on the main buildings of Cardiff University and Number 1, Millbank, in London. He responded to the Arts and Crafts movement, and his fittings, especially furniture and metalwork, were of outstanding quality. Ewan Christian (1814-95) vice-president of RIBA, he joined the committee of architects in 1849 and was chairman from 1869; architect also to the Ecclesiastical Commission. J. Coates Carter- perhaps the most individual architect to work in Wales, with two of the most interesting 20th century churches built in Wales, post-WW1: Abercarn, now ruined, and Newport, never finished. John Douglas of Chester (1830-1911), often in partnership with D. Fordham (1846- 99): he was a pupil of Edward Paley. Any Douglas church commands confidence in its spaciousness, breadth of feeling inside and noble proportions. With one disaster haunting his reputation, the collapse of St John`s, Barmouth, blamed by him on quarry blasting operations but still controversial. 29\n\nP:30\n\nBenjamin Ferrey (1810-80), a pupil of Pugin; he worked with distinction on nine Welsh churches that were Society aided, including Bala and Cefn Meriadog, plus Merthyr Mawr and St Giles, Wrexham, not Society aided William Habershon of Cardiff (1818-92) of London and Cardiff with other members of his family, Matthew and Edward. George Halliday (1858-1922) worked in John Prichard`s office, set up on his own and became diocesan surveyor for Llandaff in 1892. FRIBA in 1897. President, South Wales Institute for Architects, 1911-13. Miss Olive Talbot of Margam was a generous benefactor to many Glamorgan churches and Halliday was her favoured architect. Henry Kennedy (1840-97)-the pedestrian restorer of so many churches in Bangor diocese in a dull, cautious style but occasionally capable of something bolder, especially Llandwrog, south of Caernarfon, where there was more money available. He had a London office in Adelphi. He was diocesan surveyor in Bangor for many years. His two idioms were Early English lancets for small churches and Decorated tracery for larger buildings. He designed from the book rather than from any feeling for medieval forms or sense of place. His restorations were usually careful. F.R. Kempson of Cardiff- Roath St Martin (10093) and Port Talbot (10878) were among his largest church commissions Thomas Nicholson of Hereford (1823-95) where he was diocesan architect; very active in mid-Wales. He was a heavy restorer who favoured big effects. John Norton- a London architect who did splendid work including churches at Magor (5728), Neath (6338) and Pontypridd (6410) and achieved the rare distinction of being repeatedly praised by The Ecclesiologist. Richard Kyrke Penson (1815-86) and Robert Jewell Withers (1823-94) in West Wales- between them, they were involved in a very large percentage of the churches the ICBS helped in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire. Their approaches were completely different which also explains why they fell out professionally. Penson was surveyor of these two counties from 1857, often in partnership with Archibald Ritchie of Chester, a fine architect. Penson was a pupil of his father Thomas, as was his brother, Thomas Mainwaring Penson. He was based in Ludlow. Withers settled in a London office at Adelphi after a practice in Sherborne; he had no obvious Welsh connections but seized his opportunities in Ceredigion especially and changed his style as he went on, softening a severity of design to something more vernacular. Both served on the Society`s committee of architects. John Prichard (1817-86)- the Glamorgan diocesan architect of very long standing (1847-86). His work shows consistent attention to the quality of building stone, and his restorations, although sometimes over-thorough, were invariably well-considered. He would not relax his standards and refused to build inexpensive churches below his 30\n\nP:31\n\nminimum stipulations. He is best remembered for his work at Llandaff cathedral, 1845-52, where he is buried and memorialised, but this was the pinnacle of a large body of solid parish work. Sir George Gilbert Scott (1811-78) father of generations of architects, active at three Welsh cathedrals- St Davids (1864), Bangor (1866) and St Asaph (1869) - and at Brecon Priory, later a cathedral, and an extensive author, notably on the restoration of ancient churches. A workaholic, thriving on having many projects, often finished at increased cost after starting. John P. Seddon (1827-1906)- for a long time in partnership with Prichard, 1853-69. including churches at Llanfabon (2063), Pentyrch (4605), Cardiff Canton St John (4625), , Llanharan (5066), Cowbridge (4170), St Nicholas (5390), St Mary Church (5836), Mountain Ash (5659-with its splendid spire) and Aberavon (5245). The partnership ended but he continued on his own. He took John Coates Carter (1859- 1927) into partnership in Wales, 1884-94, but retaining his London office. University College, Aberystwyth, is his finest building. John Dando Sedding (1838-91) He died young like his architect brother Edmund, and like G.E. Street, but, based in Penzance and Bristol, he worked on five churches in Wales; his masterpiece is Holy Trinity, Sloane Square, London. He inherited from Ruskin a passion for craftsmanship. George Edmund Street (1824-81) worked in the office of G.G. Scott and set up in London in 1856. His great achievement is the Law Courts in London`s Strand, and he was architect to the dioceses of Oxford, York, Ripon and Winchester. Professor of Architecture at the RA. Many publications, especially on Spanish and Italian architecture based on his travels. Thomas Henry Wyatt (1807-80) Hon Sec RIBA. Worked with David Brandon (1813- 97) from 1838 to 1851 and with his son Matthew from 1860. A member of a dynastic family of architects more famous for grand country houses. The apogee of his church career was Wilton, near Salisbury: Wales was spared any equivalent. Edwin Montgomery Bruce Vaughan (1856-1919)- architect of many run-of-the-mill churches in industrial Glamorgan built to a budget and often virtually to the same designs; he was, however, capable of finer things including the grand church in his own parish in Cardiff, St James (now closed), and solid churches on his forays west, notably Goodwick. President, Cardiff and South Wales Architectural Society Stephen Williams (1837-99) county surveyor of Radnor 1862-99 and frequent contributor to Archaeologia Cambrensis on church conservation matters. High Sheriff of Radnor in the year he died, an honour to him and his profession. Henry Woodyer (1816-96) most active in Surrey and Hampshire with forays into Wales at Panteg, Itton, Caldicot, Cardigan and Verwick, with mixed results. 31\n\nP:32\n\nThese -and others we shall note in individual profiles- include some of the most distinguished names in British architecture in the 19th century. The profession had emerged in its integrity rather slowly. There was an Architects Club in London in 1791 but the profession was essentially seen as an intermediary agent between client and contractor. The Institute of British Architects was formed in 1834 âfor facilitating the acquirement of architectural knowledgeâ and some regulating of contractual relations. By 1835 it had 82 members. It had a charter of incorporation in 1837 and became a Royal institute- RIBA- in 1866 and four years later in The Times was described as â a highly respectable trades union.â A trade had become a discipline.[xxix] The changing fortunes of the Society 1860 onwards The Society continued through the period 1818-1860 to give quite generous sums, albeit sometimes with little assurance of the best building standards. It hoped to attract others to make contributions by the authority and example of its grants. It was almost always consistent and dealt fairly on the strict understanding of its terms. It was the very best kind of committee management in which no individual dominated. Its income was based on voluntary offerings which proved variable at times but it was better than occasional parliamentary grants such as the Commission had twice received. To believe the incumbents pleading their case for money for churches, one would think industrial Wales was in a perilous state of moral and spiritual ill-health. In 1850 at Llanwonno, William Davies said there were, âhundreds as dark and as ignorant respecting the way of salvation as the Heathen.â Cyfarthfa in 1852 was described as âthe principal scene of infidelity, Chartism and Mormonismâ ; this expanding but separate settlement to Merthyr Tydfil headed one of the lists of unchurched settlements of over 2,000 people to which the Society regularly drew attention. Actually, on a less intemperate look at the facts, South Wales was still probably the most religiously observant part of England and Wales, on the evidence of the census of religious worship held on 30th March, 1851. Census Sunday revealed that of the 250,000 people inhabiting the coalmining districts of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire and the ports of Cardiff and Newport, at least 100,000 had attended a nonconformist chapel and 17,000 attended one Anglican church. In 1800 there were 50 nonconformist chapels in Llandaff diocese; by 1851 nearer 550. [xxx] It was not a matter of irreligion; the Established Church had simply been inadequate to the challenges in comparison with the way that the chapels had prioritised their mission. The church had looked too often inwards and protected itself and its vested interests and church preferments. Llandaff didn`t even have a resident bishop; Edward Copleston`s tenure (1827-49) was marked by frequent absenteeism, as he mostly resided at the Deanery of St Paul`s in London, a strange base from which to run a Welsh diocese. For a time he had a house in Gwent as well. In fairness, it could be 32\n\nP:33\n\npointed out that Llandaff and St Davids were much poorer dioceses than St Asaph and Bangor, both in financial endowments and in the value of clergy livings, from the bishop downwards.[xxxi] Changes were afoot but too often the church was reacting to events, not ahead of the situation. Government and private action often created opportunities for the church to organise action. For example, six new Peel districts were established by the Commissioners in Glamorgan - Nant-y-glo, Whitchurch, Penmaen, Beaufort, Skewen and Cyfarthfa - between 1844 and 1846 which concentrated minds on how to address the church needs in a better organised way and the Society reported this progress. Reorganisation of parishes to respond to actual not historical settlements was in progress but never easy in view of threatened vested interests. Negotiations with the agents of Lord Bute and the Monmouthshire iron companies helped create nine new parishes. A diocesan church extension society was founded in Llandaff in 1850, and supplemented the diocesan church building society. A more coordinated approach was still lacking. This need for more planning and the enhanced professionalism of the ICBS` architects sharpened its determination to make an informed appeal to its donors and to publicise its efforts and raise its profile. Annual Reports had been published from 1819 to inform the wider constituency of support for the ICBS; these expanded from 1849 to become quarterly reports ; in that same year, space was given to report Archdeacon Williams of Llandaff`s visitation charge in May 1849 included in the Report for this year. His themes were shortage of church accommodation, residences for parochial clergy and educating children of the poor. The Vale of Glamorgan was managing but not by a long chalk the industrial areas: âLook at Merthyr and its 30,000 souls, with its Church room, even now, for less than three; Aberdare with its twelve thousand, and its Church not able to contain four hundred.â A piecemeal approach here and there would not suffice; it was a question of âsupplying a vast immigrant population, whose invasion is within the memory of living men, with access to the means of grace in connexion with the church.â Never mind Canada or Australia; our English neighbours have âpoured into our diocese their surplus populationâ¦from every English county.â In Gwersyllt, the reports added, a mining area near Wrexham, the township was Â¾ mile from the parish church and there needed to be not just a new church but a parsonage, a schoolroom and a master`s house, the classic Anglican combination, but now in a growing urban context, not just in a rural idyll such as Llandisilio near Montgomery where Thomas Wyatt oversaw the building of such a trio of these complementary buildings. Quarterly Reports developed from the annual summaries and began by describing church work from November 1848 and, as published, fleshed out the detail of the Society`s contributions and reported parish situations. Dolgellau, it was noted, had 3,674 people and church accommodation only for 700; the church never applied for 33\n\nP:34\n\nSociety funding â 700 seats in a town well supplied with chapels was enough church room. There was a profile of Llanelli which had a colliery and mining population of 11,155 with two churches that could seat 900; it was also a vast parish ten miles in length and five in breadth. Such was the background to the creation of the new church of St Paul, Llanelli. Rebuilds included Tudweiliog, and enlargements at Llanwnnen and Martletwy. Difficult situations were being recognised; at Llandovery, in the parish of Llandingat, more church room was needed as the National Schools had been built to counter the British Schools of Nonconformity. The parish of Llanfair-ar-y-bryn, spread over 233,000 acres, formed one benefice with Llandingat: many would attend the church, it was asserted, but could not find room in free seats and were discouraged by distances to be travelled, especially when there were convenient chapels nearer at hand. The second report of 1850 listed the most important cases. The population of Aberdare was 6,741 at the last census and was now estimated at 14,000; it had one hall church, the old St John`s, with 176 seats, all appropriated, and school accommodation only for 120. The population was increasing at the rate of 1000 a year; houses could not be built fast enough and they were tenanted before fit for occupation âand while the plaster on the walls is not merely damp, but soft.â Iron and coal mines brought the people in and, apparently, â it is to be lamented that frequent strikes among the workmen keep up a continual excitement in the place.â [xxxii]The Bishop of Llandaff had identified Michaelston-super-Avon as one of the most distressing cases of want of pastoral superintendence and church accommodation. The church built c. 1660 had a steeple destroyed by lightning in 1834 and re-erected but seating only 145. That would have been in order in 1803 when there were 232 people and the parish rates were Â£74; the population had risen to 5,723 and the poor rate to Â£652 but it was hard to collect for church purposes. In Monmouth archdeaconry, Bedwellty had 22,413 people and church room for 2,003; Trevethin 2,000 seats for 14,942 people and Mynyddislwyn 177 for 5,385 people. The situation intensified throughout the 1850s. A Quarterly Report for 1860 showed 26 towns of over 2,000 people which had only just in the last year been aided by a Society grant towards a new church: it included new settlements like Rhyl (2,500 people) but well at the top was Cardiff with 13,000 people. In an 1860 Report among the âshow-caseâ examples was Coyty with 2,296 people and 51 extra seats provided, all free. It was still a battle to get half the seating free. A significant example of the new mission churches, for whom a special fund had been created in 1858, was Llanelly, Brecon (M025). In the later reports more details are given of the style of new churches (e.g. Early English, Middle Pointed), the form (nave, chancel, aisles, vestry, transept, tower, bell turret), the cost including sometimes the site cost (a few significantly costly, most often donated), the architect and the total accommodation with the number of free seats, and, of course, the Society grant. Those completed in 1859-60 34\n\nP:35\n\nincluded Glyndyfrdwy near Corwen for Â£1250, a T.H. Wyatt commission with all 230 seats to be free with a grant of Â£130; and Prion, near Llanrhaiadr. between Denbigh and Ruthin to be built for Â£890 with all 250 seats to be free and a Â£125 grant. Both were Early English style, with the former hoping to add tower and spire. These Quarterly Reports were necessarily brief but laid the ground for its more substantial successor, the quarterly journal, Church Builder, in 1862, which ran for over 60 years and only stopped in World War One, and was an excellent means of communicating the Society`s activities to a wider audience. This publicity vehicle for the Society had so many articles fleshing out the broader picture of church life; here showing a before- and- after profile of one church in Monmouthshire (file 12967) which showed what could be done by good publicity. It started at one shilling per annum for four issues. Its scope was extraordinary. It recorded the building of new churches and the repair, restoration rebuilding and enlargement of others, and not only those grant- aided by the Society. The number and proportion of seats to be free was always a priority and the numbers who could find room to worship in church. In 1818 the population of England and Wales was over 11.5 million and in 1861 it was just over 20 million. By 1861, the population of Wales had increased from c700,000 in 1818 to 1,286,000 by 1861. In the 43 years of its existence to date (1861) the ICBS had assisted 4395 churches England and Wales to create 895,526 free seats, three- quarters of all the additional accommodation its grants secured. All new churches supported by the Society had to pledge that at least hal"
