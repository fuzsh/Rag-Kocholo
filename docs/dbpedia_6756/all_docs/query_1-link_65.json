        "text": "A group of St David’s Hospice supporters challenged themselves to raise vital funds to help improve the services in their local area. Members of Criccieth Family Church decided to walk up Snowdon, then cycled over 100 miles to the Brecon Beacons before finishing the challenge climbing Pen Y Fan.\n\nOn 15th July, the group led by David Webster, included David Lauder, Andrew Hinton, Andy Kime, Gill Kilbey, Carla Lauder, Steve Trythall, Ben Lauder and Dave Newbold, made their way up Snowdon. They then spent the weekend cycling to Brecon Beacons, and on 18th July, reached the summit of Pen Y Fan. The challenge was only made harder when they had to endure the gruelling heatwave, but the hottest days of summer didn’t deter them. The group found the challenge great fun, the most memorable parts being the bike ride from Barmouth to Aberdyfi and the top of Pen y Fan. Perfect weather conditions allowed them to enjoy some spectacular views of Wales.\n\nDavid Webster said,\n\n“We wanted to raise money for St David’s Hospice because it serves the people of Criccieth, Gwynedd. The charity helps so much at the most difficult of times.\n\n“In our church we have had several friends with serious illnesses who have been helped in this way. Particularly the hospice at home service.\n\n“St David’s Hospice is a superb charity. One which we want to support in any way that we can.”\n\nTo help their fundraising efforts, the church held a ‘Paned a Cacen’ afternoon in the Church Hall on 27th June. The group have smashed their fundraising target of £2000 and have raised a fantastic £3177.22 so far.\n\nKeri Mckie, Gwynedd and Anglesey Area Fundraiser of St David’s Hospice said,\n\n“This was a very unique and challenging fundraiser, made harder by the heat over the weekend. The team have done a brilliant job and should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n\n“Criccieth has always been so supportive of St David’s Hospice and the money raised will make such a difference to the local services.\n\n“Thank you very much to David and all the participants for their dedicated support.”\n\nFundraising challenges like this, help St David’s Hospice fund services that provide care to adult patients across Gwynedd, Anglesey and Conwy. This year St David’s Hospice will need at least £6 million to continue to care for local patients, but with the cost of living and bills increasing, this figure will also increase. If you would like to take on a challenge for your local hospice, please contact us on enquiries@stdavidshospice.org.uk."
