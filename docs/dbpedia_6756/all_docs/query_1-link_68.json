They had no pavement, and the earth is full of holes, and the seats are rude benches. And the altars have no rails; one of them has a breach in the roof. On the desk I think of each lay a Folio Welsh Bible of the black letter, which the curate cannot easily read. Mr T [Thrale] proposes to beautify the churches.\n\nJohnson, Samuel, Tour in Wales, July-September, 24.8.1774; Bristow, Adrian, Dr Johnson and Mrs Thrale’s Tour in North Wales, 1774 (Wrexham, 1995), p. 49\n\n1774 Tremeirchion / Tremeirchion church, Flintshire\n\nJohnson’s companion, Mrs Thrale, was a parishioner at this church.\n\nWe went to Dymerchion church, where the old clerk acknowledged his mistress. It is the parish church of Bach y Graig. A Mean fabric, … [it has] fourteen seats in it. … there is an English service only once a month … the texts on the Walls are in Welsh.\n\nJohnson, Samuel, A Diary of a Journey into North Wales in the year 1774, (1816)\n\n1774, Nevern\n\nNevern church has no pavement in it, and the frequent burials, in the manner of St David’s, have raised the ground within, 7 or 8 feet, higher than it is without.\n\nWyndham, Henry Penruddocke.

A gentleman’s tour through Monmouthshire and Wales, in the months of June and July, 1774 (1775), p. 85\n\nI am sorry to add, that the church is kept in a very slovenly manner; part of it is not paved, and the graves are frequently raised within it of earth, as in common church yards … we saw the faded and perished plants, rotting on the heaps of new raised earth, within the walls of the church; they no longer pleased, but became offensive, disgusting, and unwholesome.\n\nWyndham, Henry Penruddocke.

The present church is wholly covered with a stucco, by which the Roma bricks are concealed from view.\n\nWyndham, H.P., A Gentleman’s Tour through Monmouthshire and Wales, made in the months of June and July, 1774 and in the months of June, July and August, 1777 (1781), p. 101 – 102\n\nlate 1770s\n\nThe church has a neat modern square tower … with one bell. The nave is plain and decent with a coved ceiling; the roof being supported by eight wooden pillars. It is not paved, the seats consist of moveable benches. The floor being of mother earth is covered with rushes which are changed once a year {as was done in some parts of England on the saint’s day still called the rush-bearing}.\n\nThe reason for continuing the practice of strewing the church with rushes here, as in several other places in north Wales, is rationally accounted for. When, say they, an order was given to pew the churches it was found by a majority of the parishioners to be unwholesome and inconvenient on account of the dampness of the floors. The customary mode of strewing rushes instead of flagging the church was consequently continued.\n\nJackson, John, (1742-1792), Letters from and relating to North Wales now first published from originals and transcript copies written at different periods, comprising a series of observations and incidents introductory to a general history of the Principality at large, with a treatise on the origin of hills and the formation of Strata by J Jackson with sketches by the late W Parry, Esq., Cardiff Central Library, MS 4.1163, letter 22\n\nAnon, Journal of the Merionethshire Historical and Record Society, vol. 6, (1972), p. 356\n\nHENRY THOMAS PAYNE’S DESCRIPTIONS OF CHURCHES IN BRECON, 1785-1807\n\nThis group of descriptions of the state of churches in part of Breconshire was written by Henry Thomas Payne, Rural dean, while on his Parochial Visitations in 1785 and 1787. He wrote further descriptions of churches in later manuscripts (listed below). Later he became Rector of Llanbeder cum Partrishew and Vicar of Devynock and Archdeacon of Carmarthen.\n\nOnly the description of the fabric is transcribed below: he also commented on the state of the ceilings (he used cieled or cieling for ceiling throughout); the floor (whether pavemented or not); the pews; the communion table; surpluses, fonts, list of prohibited degrees of marriage, bibles and prayer books (in both Welsh and English) and how frequently services are held, and in which language (According to him Divine service was normally held once or twice each Sunday often in English with a Welsh service once a month – but this varied from Parish to Parish. The Holy Sacrament was normally administered on the three great festivals only (Christmas, Easter, Whitsunday) and sometimes on or near the saint’s day.) Nearly all the churches had towers or bellcots and bells and often had aisles. Payne also commented on the state of the graveyards.\n\nSOURCES:\n\n‘A Parochial Visitation of the Deanery of the Third Part of Brecon containing an Account of the several Churches, Edifices, Glebe Lands and Benefactions thereunto belonging with a state of their several repairs and a list of the succession of the several Incumbents settled therein.

May not this have been part of the ancient chapel alluded to in the charter of Bernard de Newmarch? It is now of no other use, than as a lumber Room, or as a receptacle for materials provided for the repair of the fabric. The external walls appear to be firm: – but I cannot say much for the Decency of the Appearance within. It is not cieled; and but very indifferently paved … Parochial Visitation p. 266\n\nCrickhowel\n\nthe church fabric consisted originally of a nave and two side isles; – but being found upon examination to be in a very dilapidated state a faculty was in the year 1764 obtained … to enable the church wardens and Inhabitants to take down the two side Isles, and employ the materials towards such repairs as are necessary in other parts of the building. – The alteration has certainly been much for the better … The church as it now stands is in the form of a cross; – with a neat little spire erected on a tower in the middle, containing five tolerable bells … Parochial Visitation pp. 167-168\n\nLlanbedr, St Peter\n\nThe church in appearance a good deal resembles Llangattock – being divided into two Isles, with a strong tower at the West end containing five indifferent bells … The church, like most of its neighbours, is not Ceild [no ceiling], and is consequently, not only cold but unfavourable to the voice of the reader. The pavement has been shamefully torn up, and rendered very uneven, and unsightly by a long succession of slovenly burials, in different parts of it. – The pulpit and reading desk are very indifferent and ill supplied with light. … the rails before the communion table are in a crazy state. The books of service are much out of repair, particularly the Books of Common Prayer, both in Welsh and English. – The windows are much broken … The language mostly Welsh, but in compliance with an old custom prevalent in many Parishes in Wales; The first Lesson, and the Hymnal Parts are always read in English. – The Sermons, excepting on the first Sunday in each month, are altogether in Welsh – The Holy Sacrament is administered on the Three Great Festivals only – The custom of holding a Plygain is still entertained here.

The chancel was cieled with an impanelment of oak wainscot, but it is now in a very shattered condition. The floor in the body of the church is tolerably level.

It is neatly cieled [sic], and decently paved and seated. Parochial Visitation p. 309\n\nLlanelly [now in Monmouthshire]\n\nThe Body of the Church consists of Two Isles, which are rather dark – It has a strong though low tower, at the West End; in which are Five tolerable Bells in Good Order. The external part of the fabric appears to be firm – but when I made my first visitation in 1785, I found many Things in the internal part of it which did not strike me with that idea of Decency and Propriety, to be wished for, and expected, in a Place of Public Worship. – The floor was very slovenly, uneven, and ill paved – the seats irregular and crowding upon the Isles. – The reading desk shabbily patched up with Old Ends of rough Boards had more the appearance of a Toll-Gatherers Stall, in a small market town … and the roof, for the most part, unceiled, and wholly out of repair. … At my second visitation, in 1787, I had the satisfaction of observing that my former Exhortation to them had not been wholly disregarded. …{description of improvements: new paved internally, new and decent reading desk erected,}.

It has never been cieled [sic], and consequently must be cold, particularly as the roof is not kept in the best repair. – The floor is uneven, and in some parts without paving – The seating is tolerably decent upon the north side. {conditions of the bibles and prayer books} Parochial Visitation p. 315\n\nLlangasty Tal-y-Llyn, St Gastyn\n\noutline drawing of Llangasty Talyllyn Parochial Visitation p. 320\n\nThe church is cold and bleak, being exposed to every storm from the lake … It is an awkward looking Building consisting of a Nave and Chancel only, with a strong clumsy tower at the West End, containing four bells. The whole of this fabric seems to be in decent repair – it is cieled and paved – The seating is tolerably regular. … Parochial Visitation p. 321\n\nLlangattock, St Cattwg\n\nThe present fabric [of the church], consists of two isles, with a strong but heavy tower at the West End, containing six light tuneable bells. In 1785 I was sorry to find it extremely out of Repair. Through the unpardonable neglect of several successive Churchwardens, the whole body of the church was little more than a concealed ruin. The principal timbers which supported the roof proved upon examination to be so greatly decayed that the weight had driven the walls much out of their perpendicular … the Rector, by the authority of the Bishop had absolutely declared that Divine Service should be stopped till the church was put into proper condition … {by 1787 repairs were completed except for the pavement}. Either a total prohibition will be put to that indecent practice of Burying within the church, or at least it should be limited to certain restrictions by an injunction from the Ordinary – Viz, that every person who opens ground within the church, should not only pay a fee … to the incumbent for his Licence but also be obliged to build a brick or stone wall around the place of internment, to be covered with a smooth substantial Paving stone, well jointed and laid in mortar. Always with this general Caution, that the Graves be dug to a proper Depth, and never made as formerly under the Pews, which render then uneven and unsightly, nor within six feet of the walls of the church either within, or in the church yard … Parochial Visitation pp. 54-57\n\n1806\n\nIn the summer of 1806 [the church] was new paved, glazed and seated. – which upon the scale of neatness certainly places it above any of the neighbouring churches but their former parsimony still stares them in the face. And I much fear that the additional weight imposed by the present heavy roof, has tended not a little to weaken the external walls which are certainly spread, and threaten a dissolution.

To this very circumstance, we may indeed in a great degree attribute the general dilapidation of our churches throughout the Country. Not only are our floors broken up, and rendered thereby inconvenient, and unsightly, – but from the bad practice of digging graves, close to the walls of the building, the foundations are often undermined, and the whole fabric put in danger – hence the many cracks and bulges perceptible in the walls of the greater number of our sacred edifices. – It is also extremely prejudicial to the health of the congregation – a late physician has very pointedly remarked, that whatever gave rise to the custom, it is a bad one. {and the putrid carcases causes poor air in buildings which are seldom ventilated.} Parochial Notices p. 21\n\n1807\n\nOne Sunday morning I accompanied Mr P [Payne] to Partishrew, (a little chapel of which he is minister) about three miles and a half distant from Llanbedr. … a very fine specimen of ornamental carving is still existing in the Rood Loft and Screen … it is richly sculptured in Irish Oak, and displays all that infinity of decoration which distinguishes the architecture of the latter part of the fifteenth, and the beginning of the 16th century. … Tradition reports it to have been executed by an Italian, but the name of the artist, as well as that of the benefactor who gave it to the church is lost.\n\nPayne, H.

The Holy sacrament is administered only four times in the year, at the Public charge of the Parish but at the desire of the family of Trefecca, and at their private expense, on the first Sunday in every Month. {Transcription of Howell Harris’ memorial and criticisms of him.} Parochial Visitation pp. 296-298\n\nTretower, St John the Evangelist\n\nthe chapel at Tretower, was erected in 1776 on the foundations of an old one … Parochial Visitation p. 233\n\nPen and ink drawing of a church, and another of Tretower Parochial Notices, p. 31\n\nEND ON SECTION OF HENRY THOMAS PAYNE’S DESCRIPTIONS\n\n1789 Brecon\n\nThe Chapel (of the great church).

It forms part of a curious, pretty, old church beautifully situated in a churchyard, the low walls of which are washed by the Conway, & command a view of the bridge, the Gwydir woods, & a thousand other beautiful objects. Within the chapel is a large, very ancient stone coffin, which had belonged to some Welsh king or prince a thousand years ago, some Llewellyn or other whose name I have forgot. Two or three other old monuments of Wynnes, amongst them some very curious old brass tablets, fixed in the walls & engraved with the names of & portraits of those they celebrated. They are almost all diamond shaped, with the figure in the middle, & the inscriptions in a border round. I ought to have said that the stone coffin, which seems precious in the eyes of Antiquarians, was removed from Conway abbey at the time it was pulled down to make room for the castle, as was also the case with a carved oak screen, part of which is now in Llanrwst church, & part in that at Conway. This is alone worth the journey from Capel Curig, were there no other object of interest. It is of oak, & adorned with the richest carving, of such a size as to allow of the singers being seated in the upper part of it. The part they occupy has a sort of balustrade ornament with figures and open borders in relief, & below that the screen is formed into a row of groined arches, which make the depth of it much greater at the lower part than at the upper. Between the arches is carved a beautiful veil of tabernacle work. Every part is finished most perfectly & gives one a most respectful notion of the taste & powers of the days of Edward the First. In general it seems to be in tolerable condition, but there were parts injured & falling to decay, which grieved my heart to see. Apparently a moderate expense would repair it now, but a few years more, especially if they permit the singing children to knock it about, will injure it materially. It was a pity it was divided, why was it not put up in some church that would have contained it entire? As a whole it must have been magnificent.\n\nAtherton, Ann, Tour of North Wales and Cardiganshire, 1825, NLW, 20366B, 5th October,1825\n\n1825 Newborough\n\n‘Newborough is a city of hovels, and the church, like almost all I have seen in Wales, as comfortless and shabby within as an old barn.’\n\nWeeton, Ellen (1776–1849).

There is a side isle which though open to the nave … is used as a place for ladders old stones and other lumber, the roof is open to the weather at the west end so that the bell is seen hanging in the turret and at the east end the ivy hangs down over the altar.\n\nNo tomb stones but pieces of oak with dates cut in them and some are old but in quite perfect preservation.\n\nAnon [same author as Cardiff Central Library, MS 4.349] , ‘Journal of a tour of north Wales with engravings, made in the summer vacation of 1825’, Cardiff Central Library, MS 4.350pp. 77-78\n\n1826 Lampeter\n\nMentions the whitewashed church at Lampeter.\n\nMasleni, Thomas John, Sketch of a Tour of Scenery in Wales, 1826, NLW Mss 65a, p. 72\n\n1827 Gresford\n\nwe went to see the church … which is quite beautiful; the screen is exquisitely carved oak; there are several monuments with Welsh inscriptions, more odd than beautiful…\n\nBagot, Eleanor, National Library of Wales, Bachymbyd collection, Uncatalogued, 6th June 1827\n\n1827 Wrexham\n\nThe church ill kept and church yard slovenly tho always kept locked up.

I am in love with the Monmouthshire churches, almost as humble buildings as the Scotch, but not like them, looking like barns, and ugly barns too; I will try to make out the usual shape [illustration], very low and nicely whitewashed. Ours [Llanover] has a tower steeple, which is very rare. They usually stand at some distance from their village on fine green knolls sloping down to a river or brook, and the churchyard is sure to have (more or fewer) large yew trees in it. Some of them have not a single grave stone, in others these are numerous, and the places where higher persons have been interred are enclosed with rails and planted with flowering shrubs.\n\nStuart, Louisa, The letters of Lady Louisa Stuart selected with an introduction by R.

The church is a new one very roomy and on a good plan – I cannot say much for the manner in which the service is done – The first service is at 11 in English – the 2nd at 3, in Welsh, the 3rd at 6 in English\n\nDuke of Newcastle, The University of Nottingham, Manuscripts and Special Collections, Ne 2F\n\n1835 Ross\n\nWithin the church we were shown the pew where the good man [John Kyrle, “The Man of Ross”] sat for so many years, and which, out of respect to his memory, has never been altered or touched during the several alterations the church has since undergone. Two slight elm-trees grow inside of the church, and indeed within the pew, partially curtaining with their foliage the tall arched window that opens upon it. The local legend is, that some years ago a rector impiously cut down some of John Kyrle’s dear elms that stood in the churchyard, outside of the window, and opposite the pew, and that thereupon, as if determined to show their affection for their planter, some roots threw out fresh shoots, which, penetrating the church wall, grew up over the very seat he used to occupy.\n\nThe legend, at all events, is pretty, and there are the trees growing in the church, and their light green leaves gracefully extending over the pew, to answer for its veracity. The people who showed us the interior of the church seemed to regard the trees as miraculous and sacred objects, and they will probably be left to grow unmolested in the aisle, until their size becomes inconvenient and requires trimming.\n\nIn Pope’s time John Kyrle lay “without a monument, inscription stone,” but in 1776 Lady Betty Duplin left a sum of money for the purpose, and his name is now recorded in a simple inscription, but in gold letters, on a marble tablet, over which is placed that other doubtful adjunct of monumental fame, a tolerably “bad bust.” The memory of honest John did not require these things to preserve it, but they will do it no harm, and they proceeded from laudable motives.\n\nAnon, THE WYE, The Penny Magazine, issue no. 219, Aug. 31, 1835.\n\n1836 Brecon\n\nTo the priory church which is now under repair.\n\nRobinson, Henry Crabb, (1775-1867), Dr. Williams’s Library, 14 Gordon Square, London, Henry Crabb Robinson’s travel journal no 24, (microfilm), p. 19; Sadler, T., (ed) The Diary, Reminiscences and Correspondence of Henry Crabb Robinson (3 vols, London, 1869; 2 vols, 1872)\n\n1836 Llanfair Clydogau\n\n‘The church grossly whitewashed …\n\n{Architecture of the church} ‘The interior … much neglected, yet when I see what has been done elsewhere I begin to respect and esteem that very negligence …’\n\nParker, John, (1798-1860), ‘St David’s 1836, no 56’, NLW MS 18253B, pp. 27-29\n\n1836 Roche\n\nthe church … {the ceiling of the porch is panelled with stone …} ‘this elegant and unusual relic is barbarously whitewashed.’\n\nParker, John, (1798-1860), ‘St David’s 1836, no 56’, NLW MS 18253B, p. 49\n\n1836 Llangurig Church\n\nWhen I last saw it, the interior was wretchedly pewed, and miserably neglected, but there was a fine old font … and a chancel screen of most exquisite, highly wrought and well designed … Instead I find vulgar modern pews and the whole screen has been swept away, no vestige of it remaining.’ {the screen was burned …} ‘This was all done a year ago …’ {he had drawn it} [in 1831]\n\nParker, John, (1798-1860), ‘St David’s 1836, no 56’, NLW MS 18253B, p. 4-6\n\n1838 Llansilin church\n\n{sketch of church tower, detailed description of the church tower, designed by a builder, the interior of the church}\n\nParker, John, (1798-1860), NLW MS 18256C Tours through Wales 1819-47, pp. 209-214\n\n1839 Tremadoc\n\nWalked towards the church where we were accosted by a lady who very obligingly offered to procure the key for us.

It is in a sad ruinous state & service is not performed in it. The old guide at the castle said it was a shame to see the mother church so neglected & I quite agreed with her; the old oak roof appears quite sound, but the slates are off, day light appears, & of course the weather will soon destroy that, as well as the pews below. There is a fine monument of the Salisbury family two figures recumbent on a tomb date 1578.

We entered the church, which is a plain, ancient structure, semi-Gothic; the ceiling is ornamented with carved oak, and there are some pictures of stained glass.\n\nThe morning service was in the native Welsh language, of which the Amen, pronounced by the Clerk with great emphasis, was the only word that was intelligible to us, although we could follow the responses by means of a prayer-book in Welsh and English; the singing was melodious, the aspect of the people serious, and it was very pleasing to observe remains of the ancient Welsh language preserved in the primitive worship and faith of a people who were christianized very early, who contended long and bravely for their liberties, who were cruelly oppressed by their more powerful neighbors, and were therefore excited to vindictive retaliation.\n\nSilliman, Benjamin, A visit to Europe in 1851, (New York, 1853). pp. 59-60\n\n1854 Trawsfynydd\n\n{Description of the village and the church which is being restored and saw pits dug in the churchyard}\n\nWelsh service in the National School (but men were working in the gold mines and on the church)\n\nPamplin, William, Notes and sketches of a tour in North Wales, NLW MS 7509C, 22-23 July, 1854\n\n1861 Lampeter\n\nprobably the worst of any of these [Cardiganshire] churches is that of Lampeter itself, more ugly than the rest,— and yet, though a poor case, containing a jewel. The font, much mutilated by the sharpening knives of many generations of men, when it used to lie in the churchyard, is a square basin, perhaps of the twelfth century, on a circular shaft, with emblems of the evangelists the angel, the lion, the ox, and the eagle—at the four corners rudely worked; but one of the most interesting relics of early art that Wales possesses. This is worthy of careful preservation. As for the building itself, it is a public eyesore: it demands total demolition, and scientific reconstruction.

The rude and squalid aspect of some of these old mountain churches can hardly be imagined by a person who has not seen them. Time has done much to dilapidate them, but neglect more. I shall not soon forget the fotheram-like interior of one which we hit upon “over the hills and far away” during a ramble from Penmaenmawr, where a number of swallows had built their nests upon the naked rafters of the chancel, and, along with the sparrows were flying in and out, reminding us of the passage in Psalm lxxxiv, by what some good church people in “our town” would have considered a rather too expressive illustration of the text.\n\nThis, like most of the oldest churches in Wales, has at the entrance of the grave ground, what is called a “lychgate”, a wicket or penthouse-covering, under which the bearers of a corpse may rest, and sing the verse of a hymn or wait until the minister is ready to meet them. In some places these structures, whether of wood or stone, are both ancient and picturesque. These rustic sanctuaries of religion- so indicative of the earnestness, though uncomplimentary to the taste of the builder, have a special charm for the draughtsman and the poet:\n\n“Yes, I do love these old Welsh Churches well,\n\nPerched, as they are, like bird-nests rarely found …”\n\nHolland, John, Letters from Llangollen (19 letters published in The Sheffield Daily Telegraph, 1863) with poetry, manuscript notes and many prints), NLW ms. 16722 D, f. 29\n\n1865 Beddgelert\n\n[church described but not transcribed.]\n\nStratton, Gertrude J, NLW 21992A, 3rd September 1865\n\n1865 St Tudnos\n\nchurch on the Great Orme’s Head, which is very ancient, & for a time was roofless, by reason of the violence of the tempests which sweep round the Great Orme’s Head…restored by Mr Reece of Birmingham in 1855, in commemoration of his daughter having been restored to health at Llandudno.\n\nStratton, Gertrude J, NLW 21992A, 7th September 1865\n\n1868 Llangar\n\nLlangar Church … consists of a nave, south porch, chancel, and a stone bell-turret at the west end, containing one bell.

Griffith, ‘Another trip to North Wales,’ The Builder, Volume 26, (1868), p. 710\n\n1868 Llangollen\n\nLlangollen Church consists of a nave, with aisles, north porch, chancel with aisles, and a tower at the west end containing four bells. This was an Early English church, with a north aisle only; a south aisle has recently been added, and the chancel and aisles have been rebuilt. The new aisle and additions are in the Decorated and Perpendicular styles; the ornamental Early English doorway (formerly external) on the south side of the church is retained as an inner doorway between the nave and new aisle. It is to be regretted that the additions were not made to accord with the original style remaining, or in the style of the day. In former times, if additions were made to our old churches, the additions were always in the new style—the style of the day: our ancestors never rebuilt in half-a-dozen styles. The tower was rebuilt about 100 years ago, and if it were again rebuilt it would be well.\n\nThe roofs over nave and north aisle in Llangollen church are original, of oak, open, and truncated, with collars, hammer-beams, carved angels, &c. The east end of the nave is ceiled with oak, and formed into panels, and enriched with ornaments. The new roofs are of deal varnished. It has been suggested that the roof of the nave formerly belonged to Valle Crucis Abbey: without documentary evidence I saw nothing to confirm this opinion.\n\nThere are a few brasses; the clerk hands the visitor a paper with the inscriptions printed thereon, not a bad precedent to be followed by officials in churches generally; there are loose brasses handed to you to read; on this I urged that they be immediately fixed in their proper places, as they might be lost; this was promised to be done.\n\nWith a view to obtaining a list of all the brasses remaining throughout the United Kingdom, the British Archaeological Association should issue a paper to each incumbent to fill with the number and dates of all brasses in his church. The Society of Antiquaries some years ago attempted to collect inscriptions, but did not succeed.\n\nThere is a tomb of the fifteenth century beneath an arched recess in the wall of the aisle, forming a canopy, with crocketed label, and pinnacles, springing from small attached columns. The effigy has gone; it was taken piecemeal to cure diseases in horses’ eyes! It was not a founder’s tomb, but belonged to the Trevor family.\n\nW.P. Griffith, ‘Another trip to North Wales,’ The Builder, Volume 26, (1868), p. 709\n\nGriffith published articles on visits (presumably to north Wales), in The Builder, Volume 22, (1864), p. 718- and volume 24 (1866), pp. 609- which probably included detailed descriptions of some other churches, but these volumes could not be found on-line.\n\nLLANDDEWI BREFI\n\nThis was off the beaten track but it had been an important College, and had Roman and Early Christian inscription which a few antiquaries wanted to see.

A pulpit and desk are the only furniture; not a pew or a bench in the whole extent of the vast pile, not a pane in the windows, not a bell in the fry.

A building not less the notice of strangers from its mean and squalid appearance than the mansion for its elegance and splendid show. Till lately there was neither gate nor fence to the Church yard. The gloomy aspect to the spot is much heightened by the yew tree which nearly overhang the Church. We found the door open and the floor covered with dirt and weeds and from appearances it seemed to give occasional shelter to the cattle. The benches barely able to sustain their own weight, the roof naked, and the walls damp, the chancel covered with memorials of departed greatness, the reading desk and pulpit which is only nine inches above the desk in a ruinous state. But prayer and adoration uttered in this wretched building by the untutoured yet humble Welch curate are sure access to the throne of Grace, as easy as the polished rhetoric of the lawn-sleeved prelate in St Paul’s cathedral. Mr Johnes however, intends shortly to build a new church upon a better plan better suited to the magnificence of his house.\n\nWilliams, William, (1774-1839) and Burgess, James, Rev (1774-1839)\n\nA Pedestrian Tour thro Wales in 1796, NLW MS 23253 C, p. 49-50\n\n1833, Hafod\n\n22.9.1833\n\nThis is Sunday we went to church [at Aberystwyth] and walked about. The church is a new one very roomy and on a good plan – I cannot say much for the manner in which the service is done – The first service is at 11 in English – the 2nd at 3, in Welsh, the 3rd at 6 in English –\n\n6.10.1839\n\nAt the church at Hafod this morning I saw what I saw before – two clergymen in cordial cooperation in the reading desk and reading alternately different parts of the service – the preacher afterwards after a very long Welsh prayer gave out the psalms and the heads of each verses – but after the conclusion of the sermon and the blessing given what was our astonishment to hear the reading desk break out with a roaring voice and in a theatrical style but more like a sailor in the straits and sing some verses probably of his own composition and accompanying himself upon an accordion – It was a painful and unbecoming exhibition and what I presume could only be met with in a Welsh church –\n\n14.9.1840\n\nMy matters here occupy all my attention – I wish my means were equal to my views and I could do a great deal and no inconsiderable good –\n\nI am about to repair and alter the church here and to erect the monument by Chantrey to the Johnes family – when accomplished, at a very reasonable expense this little church will be one of the choicest buildings to be found anywhere – I wish I had a better clergyman but few of the Welsh ????? are otherwise than low and disreputable and in their religious doctrines, little better, if any, than ranting Methodists, or ?????? preceptions – as to desecration of the church or its service they think nothing of it –\n\n25.10.1841\n\nNo post from London – fully occupied … before leaving this place – The church is nearly finished – the monument in course of erection – the painted glass windows will be put up tomorrow – the church and view from it is now one of the most striking features of these grounds – I have taken great pains with the building and the scenery, and, I think, I have been very successful –\n\n20.8.1843\n\nThis is Sunday – we were all at church today, with a numerous and most respectable and well behaved congregation, and in a church now endued capable of inspiring veneration to Almighty God and decency of behaviour in this temple – I surveyed it with infinite satisfaction and I looked at it and participated in its service in all probability for the very last time – for we go on Saturday next – I trust that the benefits which I may have been instrumental in effecting here may live after me, when I am gone and far away –\n\nSelected extracts of the Diaries of Henry Pelham Fiennes Pelham-Clinton, 4th Duke of Newcastle under Lyme (1785–1851), eldest son of the 3rd Duke, The University of Nottingham, Manuscripts and Special Collections, Ne 2F (photocopy in Ceredigion Archives)\n\n1844, Hafod\n\nEglwys Newydd, or New Church, stands on part of the Hafod estate. It was erected by Mr Johnes in 1803, from designs by Mr Wyatt [architect], and is built in the form of a cross, with a tower at one end. The altar-piece by Fuseli, is a masterly representation of Christ, and his two disciples at Emmans.

The Altar is well railed-in, and the carved work about the Gallery to the east has been very good. A Breve is now out for the rebuilding of the church, and they propose to do it with good stone. The people would never bury North in the churchyard ‘till Dr Parry the minister ordered his own Grave to be there.

Chancel separated from Nave by an ornamented open Skreen, as were the Side Aisles from the Nave. No antient Monument. A mural Tablet to the Owens family of Llyn lloedd, a seat close to the town. The whole bears strong evidence of its being very antient. All the Windows handsome, with stone tracery in Chancel and each Aisle. … there is a Window of same dimensions and tracery with those in the East End and cross Aisles in the West End. Tower ending in a tiled short spire. In the Chancel, just within the Skreen separating from the Nave, old Oak Stalls, with grotesque carving under the seats each side of the Entrance, as if for Singers or Chantry Priests.
