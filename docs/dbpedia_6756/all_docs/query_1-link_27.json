        "text": "BARMOUTH. ST. JOHN'S CHURCH -A fine elevated site for this new church has been obtained on the hill- side facing the sea - a gradual slope up of the road giving easy access to the porches at the west end. In plan the church consists of nave and side aisles, divided by piers and arches; choir, and chancel, with morning chapel on northside of choir, and vestries, with organ- chamber over, on the south. Over the choir is the tower, 34 feet square outside, and rising 100 feet high from the base of its elevated position. With a. view to meeting the large influx of visitors in the summer months to this favourite watering place, the church has been designed to seat 1000 persons. It was at first intended to erect a smaller and less costly church, but Mrs. Dyson Perrins, of Plas Mynach, near Barmouth, having generously intimated to the rector that she would build the chancel, tower, side chapel, and vestries, to the memory of her late husband, this has led to a more ornate structure being erected, and will enable the parish to devote their efforts entirely to the nave and aisles, towards which Mrs. Perrins' son contributes the oak seats, whilst other members of the family make special gifts to the church. The whole of the work will be carried out under the direction of the architects, Messrs. Douglas and Fordham, of Chester. [ Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald 21 June 1889 page 6]\n\nPRINCESS BEATRICE AT BARMOUTH. LAYING THE FOUNDATION STONE OF A NEW, CHURCH. Never before, probably, in the history of Barmouth has so large a concourse of people assembled in the town as on Tuesday last when the Princess Beatrice visited that favourite watering place for the purpose of laying the foundation-stone of the new church of St. John's. Trains from Portmadoc and the north, Dolgelley, and from Aberystwyth on the south and east, poured thousands of visitors into the town, and the steamship Snowdon brought a large company across the bay from Aberystwyth. … The Church, which will be dedicated to St John the Evangelist, is designed in the Late Perpendicular style of architecture, and will consist of nave and side aisles (divided by piers and arches), chancel, with morning chapel on the north of choir and vestries with organ over on the south. Over the choir will be a tower of fine proportions, thirty-four feet square outside and rising 100 feet high from the base of its elevated position. With a view to meeting the requirements of the large influx of visitors in the summer months, the church has been designed to seat 1.000 worshippers. As had been said, it was at first intended to erect a church smaller and less costly; but Mrs Dyson Perrins, of Plasmynach, Barmouth and Davenham Bank, Malvern, having generously intimated to the Rector that she would build the chancel, tower, side chapel and vestries to the memory of her late husband, has led to a more ornate structure being erected and will enable the parishioners to devote their efforts entirely to the nave and aisles, towards which Mrs Perrins' son contributes the oak seats. The contract has been let to Mr W. Winnard, of Wigan Mr Alban Lloyd is clerk of the works, and the architects are Messrs Douglas and Fordham, of Chester. [ The Cambrian News and Merionethshire Standard 30 August 1889 page 6]\n\nThe new district church of St. John the Evangelist at Barmouth, of which Princess Beatrice laid the foundation stone on Tuesday, is being built from designs by Messrs Douglas and Fordham, of Chester, on a site scooped out of the side of a hill, and facing the sea. It will consist of nave and side aisles, choir and chancel, with morning chapel on north, and vestries, with organ chamber above, on the south of choir. Over the choir is the tower, 100 feet in height, and 34 feet square. It will be seated for 1,000 persons. The greater portion of the cost is being met by Mrs. Perrin and family of Worcester, who have contributed the sum of £14,000, besides the oak seating and other special gifts. Mr. William Winnard, of Wigan, is the contractor, and Mr. Allen Lloyd the clerk of works. [Building News 30 August 1889 page 284]\n\nTHE NEW CHURCH, BARMOUTH. FALL OF THE TOWER. – During the Queen's visit to North Wales in August 1889, Princess Henry of Battenberg, at the invitation of the Dowager Marchioness of Londonderry, visited Barmouth, and laid the foundation stone of a new church. The site chosen consisted of an excavation in the limestone cliff over-looking the estuary, and a lofty central tower formed part of the design. After a considerable portion of the masonry had been erected it was found that some serious defect rendered the foundation unsafe. Great expense was incurred in trying to strengthen the foundation by means of concrete buttresses, and the building was proceeded with. On Friday, the roof was ready for the slates, and the tower had been built almost to its full height, when, suddenly, shortly after midnight it collapsed and fell into the nave, destroying the greater portion of the building, consisting of the north arcade and aisle, chapel, and east end of the church. Fortunately, no lives were lost, owing to the hour at which the collapse took place. Had it happened in the day-time, the loss of life must have been terrible. The architects for the church were Messrs Douglas and Fordham, of Chester, and the contractor Mr W. Winnard, of Wigan, while the whole of the wood-work and seating have been carried out by Mr W. Freeman, of Chester! The cause of the accident is being investigated. The loss is estimated at from eight to ten thousand pounds. It has been decided to at once commence there-erection of the tower, end to restore the fabric of the building. EXPLANATION OF THE DISASTER. A meeting of the building committee was held on Tuesday, to consider the steps to be taken in consequence of the disastrous accident to the new tower. It was estimated that, the total loss will be upwards of £5,000. The tower, a large portion of the fabric, comprising the north arcade and aisle, chapel and east end has been wrecked, Messrs Douglas and Fordham, architects, attributed the catastrophe entirely to blasting operations with dynamite among the rocks immediately at the back of the church in order to obtain more light for the church. The explosions had first shaken and eventually brought down the tower. Mr Winnard. contractor, Wigan. immediately commences the reconstruction of the tower and building. [ Carnarvon and Denbigh Herald 18 September 1891 page 7]\n\nST. JOHN'S NEW CHURCH, BARMOUTH. CONSECRATION SERVICE. The consecration of St. John's Church, Barmouth took place on Thursday, the event being one of great interest and attraction, the fashionable health resort being crowded with people from far and near and during the services the sacred edifice was filled. The church stands on Belle Vue Hill side opposite the station and forms a pleasing feature in the bird eve view of Barmouth from the Friog Cliffs, on the southern side of the Mawddach estuary. The church itself is in cruciform with tower rising from the chancel and transepts after the manner of the old sixth century churches, dedicated to Teilo, Cadvan and Dewi, exemplified at Towyn, Llanbadarn Fawr, Aberystwyth and the Cathedral of St, David. The material of the exterior walls is of local stones relieved with a free stone of a pretty light colouring. The tower is carried up in a square form and contains a clock and a peal of eight rich-toned bells. The interior of the church is divided into channel and transepts on either side, approached under the massive arches of the tower. The transept on the right contains the organ loft and the transept on the left is suitable for morning chapel. The chancel is provided with choir stalls elaborately carved in ecclesiastical style. The floor is laid in mosaic, and is approached from the nave by three steps. The seats are of oak in open form, and the floor is laid in blocks. Nearly all the work has been defrayed at the cost of Mrs Perrins. Handsome gifts have also been given by Mrs Porter, Mrs Seddon, Mrs Dixie, and others. The pulpit, which stands on the right of the chancel looking eastward from the nave, is of oak, finely carved, the reading desk being of iron and bronze, and in the centre is the figure of the sower going forth to sow, with an embossed lettering above of \"The Seed is the Word.\" The nave consists of a centre aisle and clerestory, with lights on the aisles of either side divided from the central nave by massive pillars and richly moulded arches. The roof is of open timber work, and the windows filled in with cathedral glass. The eastern window is a beautiful specimen of the glass manufacturer’s art, and represents Christ surrounded by the Apostles. The side windows are also filled in with stained glass with Scriptural subject. The font is of pure marble throughout, including the steps and pedestal, and represents a full-sized angel kneeling on one knee and holding a large shell with the other. The wings and robes of the figure, as indeed all the parts, are moat exquisitely sculptured. The whole is to be enclosed by a rail, and inside which arrangements will be made for the sponsors to kneel on the steps and the choir to stand outside the railing when the service of holy baptism is being celebrated during the ordinary services. ….
