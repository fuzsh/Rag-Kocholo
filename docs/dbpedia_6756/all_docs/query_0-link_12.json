DYVRDWY.— m Dee.— The Editor of the Cijm- mrodor, j. 199, impugns the derivation of the name of this river in the Gossiping Guide to Wales, from Diovr du, Blackwater, and asserts ex cathedra that it is from dwvr, water, and dwy, divine. As I think tliat I formerly sup- plied the first derivation, I still maintain that it is correct, and I will give my reasons for it. I wish now to ask for the authority of dwy meaning divine. I believe it to be so asserted without the least foundation. I cannot find dwy, divine, ip any Dictionary, and I have every one of the Welsh language. The chief are by Salesbury, Dr. Davies, Edw. Llwyd, and Dr. Owen Pughe. They say nothing of dwy being divine, though Dr. Owen Pughe gives Dyvrdwy, the Divine water, which is a mere asser- xxxx tion, and thence the Cymmrodor obtained his knowledge. There is, however, no authority for this derivation. Dyvr- dwy is always called by the present inhabitants of its banks Dwrdu, Black water, and it is very descriptive of it. It was so called in the time of our Welsh hero, who wrote his name Owen de Glendourdy. Water in Old Welsh was duhr, and dobr, and in Old Irish dohur. Then by the regu- lar change of h into the soft form hh, dobhr in Welsh, and dohhar in Irish ; now hh was pronounced as v, whence dwvr in Welsh, and contractedly dour or dior ; and dur in. Irish. Dohhra, dur, in Gaelic, and dour in Manx. The old form of du, black, in Welsh and Irish, was duh, and so used by the Ancient Britons, when they occupied Ire- land. It is still preserved in its integrity in Dublin, Blackpool ; Modern Welsh, Dulyn. The Welsh and the Irish dub underwent the usual mutation into dubh, and the final, having the sound of v, became indistinct, as is seen in tre for trev, and phvy ior phoyv, and in many other instances, and finally omitted. There is a large river in Ireland, called Blackwater. There are two rivers in Scotland, called Dee, and two more called Dye, and another Duv or Duff, from their colour, and this is corroborated from two rivers in Ayrshire called Dow-uisk, which means nothing else but Black-water, without any reference to divinity. The Roman name of both Dees was Deva, whence I suspect the Welsh dwy was drawn; w?/ being the later equivalent of the Latin e, as is evident from Welsh rhwyd, cwyr, eghoys, &c., from rHe, ctra, ecclesia. The idea of divinity attached to our Dee is of comparatively recent times, such as of Spencer and Drayton. The earliest author quoted is Giraldus Cambrensis, and all that he says is — “The inhabitants of these parts assert that the waters of this river, the change their fords every month, and as it inclines more towards England and Wales, they can with certainty prognosticate which nation will be successful or unfortunate during the year,” Rhydycroesau. R. Williams. M.S. HISTORY OF OSWESTRY, 1635.— Refer- ences are made by Pennant (1778) and Bingley (1804) to this M.S., which is preserved in the British Museum. Price (1815) and Edwards (1819), in their local histories also refer to it — probably not from actual examination, but copying the earlier Topographers. The M.S. was written by “John Davies, Esq., Recorder of Oswestry,” for the Earl of Arundel, and to it ‘the following letter is appended, which now, for the first time I fancy, appears in print : — Right Honhle I have at length accomplished yor Lor'ps comand in transcriheing the Chres heretofore graunted by yor. noble Aun- cestor.s unto the Towne of Oswestrie, and now extant among their Records.

The M.S. comprises 162 folio pages, much of which (in- cluding the early charters) is in Latin. I have not seen it myself, so am unable to say how far our local historians are indebted to it. J.P. J. West Holm, Oswestry. [A contributor to Bye-gones — whose initials are always wel- come to us and to our readers— has kindly promised to overhaul the M.S. and compare it with our local histories.— Ed.] QUERIES. R. JONES OF BULTHEY NEAR ALBERBURY. Will any reader of Bye-gones give me information as to who Robert Jones of Bulthey was, and to what family he belonged ? It is generally thought that he represented an old wealthy Denbighshire family who originally were pos- sessors of much property in that county, and from some cause or other lost the greater part of it. Robert Jones came from the neighbourhood of Sychdin, or Trefonen, and settled in Montgomeryshire, where he bought the Bulthey in the year 1728 ; he died in 1786. Ancient. SKETCHES AND CHARACTERS.— I have in my possession a little volume purchased by my father at the sale of JohnMytton’s effects atHalston. The follow- ing is a copy of the title page: — “Sketches and Charac- ters of the most Eminent and most Singular Persons^ now Living. By Several Hands. Vol. 1. Bristol, Printed for John Wheble, at No. 24, Pater-noster Row, London. M.DCC.LXX.” Some of the Sketches are far from compli- mentary, and some much too vulgar for modern readers. Nearly all are headed by initials only, as for instance the following : — Of L d C e. His going the last time to India, did him more honour, than all his former expeditions. Of L d P s. His Lordship not only suffers the disagreeable inquietudes of being often ill, but he thinks it necessary to be always taking Physic when he is so ; and for that reason, travels like a Sea Surgeon, with a medicine chest ; we think to be ill, and to take physic too ; is rather too much. Another paragraph gives one of the names referred to above in full, and it is amongst a number headed “Of those who have made great figures, in some particular action, or circumstance of their lives.” Lord Clive. When he went last to India, to the astonishment, and mortification of his enemies. Can any of your readers give us some account of this curious work? N.W.S. JANUARY 9, 1878. NOTES.

[From a transcript made in the reign of Hen. VII, inHengwrtMS. 213.] W. JOHN MORGAN, M.P. — I extract the following from an old Scrap Book, which is, unfortunately, very de- ficient in dates : — John Morgan, Esq., the member for Monmouthshire, who died lately, was in South Wales pretty much what Sir Watkin Williams Wynn is in the North. The estates of the family pro- duce £30,005 annually. One of his ancestors is celebrated in Wales for having displayed the riches of his country in going to St. James’s drawn by a set of horses shod with silver, and Mr. Morgan Avas one of the two brothers who found so much money in the house of their immediate ancestor, that it was divided, not by tale, but by shovels-ful.

ADERYN-Y-CORPH. — A bird bearing this name which, literally translated into English is, the corpse-bird, is believed by the superstitious among the Welsh to dis- (a) of Emral, married to his first wife about 1484, died 18 Jany. 36 Hen. VIII, buried at Gresford. (b ) Ancestor to the Pulestons of Havod y wern. Jan., 1878. BYE-GONES. 3 charge an ominous function by prognosticating the near occurrence of death in a sick chamber. And of this in- telligence it is represented to be the harbinger by invariably pecking with its bill in the night time at the window of the individual lying on a sick bed, two or three weeks before his decease occurs. Many years ago several persons whose character for truthfulness was unquestionable, de- clared to the writer that, whilst watching at the bed side of a sick person previous to his decease, they had most distinctly heard the repeated raps of the coriDse-bird at his window, though not one of them could tell that he had ever seen the bird itself, or even knew what kind of bird it was. But as the writer himself has since then both seen the corpse-bird and heard its tappings, he is able to testify that its nocturnal visits are real, but that they have no- thing of a foreboding nature connected with them. Before, however, that is done, it may be desirable to identify and describe the supposed ominous bird. The mention of aderyn-y-corph occurs twice in the Welsh translation of the Bible, namely, in Lev. xi. 17, and Deut. xiv. 16. The name by which the said bird is designated in the English translation in both passages is the little owl. But in some English- Welsh dictionaries aderyn-y-corph is given as the Welsh name for the screech- owl. In the English Bible, however, where screech-owl is named, that is, in Isai. xxxiv. 14, night monster is given in the margin, and in the Welsh Bible yr wyll. Assuming then that by the little owl, screech-owl, yr wyll and aderyn-y-corph one and the same bird be meant, the reason of the latter being reputed to be ominous becomes at once apparent. The screech-owl is so named on account of its habit of hooting or screeching at night, its cry being doleful, dismal and horrifying, whose very voice is regarded by the superstitious to betoken danger, misery and death. It has quite as much aversion to the light of day as the common barn-owl. Whilst the latter perches in the day-time in the ruins of old buildings, fis- sures of rocks, and hollow places under the projecting brink of stone-quarries, the screech-ov/1 resorts to hollow apertures in the trunk of trees, to such trees as are by reason of their thickly-grown branches impervious to light, as spruce-firs, and others densely entwined with bushy ivy. Being of a ruddy colour it is not easily dis- covered in such occult haunts. During a stay made by the writer a few years since at a rural residence in South Wales, he had a favourable oppor- tunity of acquiring an accurate knowledge of the screech- owl, and of hearkening to its despondent and terrifying cry. The residence in question is situated near the edge of a thickly wooded ravine, by which it is bounded north and east. As the writer one night was with a light in his chamber he heard something resem- bling the repeated pecking of a bird at the window. Having extinguished the light, and very gently drawn aside the blind, he observed on the window sill, by the glimmer of the stars, two owls, in colour ruddy, and in size smaller than the barn owl, which had been attracted thither, no doubt, by the reflection of the light within. The morning following the writer visited the foremen tioned ravine in search of what he believed were screech-owls, and there discovered, embosomed in impenetrable foliage, just such two birds as he had espied the previous night. And since then he has frequently at dusk, on a still sum- mer evening near the same ravine, heard the hideous simultaneous cries of half-a-dozen screech-owls reverber- ating from side to side. The visits and raps of aderyn-y-corph at the window of the lighted chamber in which a sick person is lying, is to be accounted for in a similar way. Attracted by the light burning there, it pecks with its beak at the window, and its peckings are heard by those who may be watching at the bed-side. If they shoiTld be of a superstitious cast they will forthwith identify them with the forebodings of approaching dissolution, speak of them as such, and so perpetuate the credulity in the reputed premonitory in- tention of the taps of aderyn-y-corph or the screech-owl.

Charles Thomas. Newtown. COUNT De CRILLON. — I have recently heard a very interesting episode in connection with the residence of the French Prisoners of War at Oswestry in 1812-14. Among them there was one who called himself Count De Crillon, but whom General Veillande (another of the captives here) knew to be an impostor, be- cause he was acquainted with the real Count, who be- longed to a good family. The General, however, kept his own counsel, on the so-called Count satisfjdng him that he had substantial reasons for going under an assumed name. Only Mr. Aubrey was in- formed of it, and the General told the pretended De Crillon that so long as he did nothing to disgrace France, his secret should be kept. “The Count” was received into the best society in the neighbourhood, and behaved in all respects as aii officer and a gentleman ; until one day he was “wanted” by the Bow-street officers, who apprehended him, but from whom, it appears, he escaped. It then turned out that he was a complete adventurer, and not a Frenchman at all, although his broken Eng- lish was admirably assumed. He had committed frauds in America, under the name of “Henry,” and was well known to the police of England. I have been told that his career appeared in a newspaper some years ago. Can any of your readers supjdy it ? J arco. 4 BYE-GONES. Jan., 1878. JANUARY 16, 1878. NOTES.

WILMOT OF OSWESTRY.— Although, man and boy, I must have passed the cottage in Penylan Lane now occupied by Mr. Bennion hundreds of times, I never, until one day last summer observed an engraved tablet on it, just under the roof, inscribed as follows : — M I : W 1696 Mr. Bennion’s house stands on the corner of “ Croft Wilmot,” and on the other side of the Welshpool road we have “ Bias Wilmot,” the residence of Mr. Shaw. Who was Wilmot, and does the wall-tablet refer to him ? Oswald. SADLER THE AERONAUT.— This early navi- gator of the atmosphere came to grief off the Welsh Coast, near Holyhead, on Oct. 9, 1812. From what place did he make his ascent ? It was stated chat on the 12th of Aug. in that year he went up in his balloon from a field, near St, Domingo, about a mile and a half from Liverpool ; and such was the excitement, that, as we are told by the Liverpool Courier oi time, “At twelve o’clock the town was nearly deserted, and the shops being universally shut, it wore the aspect of Sunday, but with scarcely a person in the streets.” Some idea of the tremendous attraction such an exhibition was sixty years ago, may be gathered in the fact of a great town like Liverpool sus- pending business to witness it. G.G. REPLIES. COUNT DE CRILLON (Jan. 9, 1878).— The prisoner of war known as De Crillon arrived at Oswestry long after the other captives. The Duke De Alemberghad been, I think, previously removed to Bridgnorth, Many prisoners had escaped ; among them General Philippon, and it was thought the Duke assisted them with money. It was, I believe, as stated, an old General named Veillande who recognized De Crillon. The German pri- soners had been released and sent home in 1813. The news of the entrance of the allied armies into Paris reached Oswestry at Easter, 1814. There was great ex- citement in the town, and on the Monday Count De Crillon and some others mounted the White Cockade ; and then it began to be whispered that he was not the real man. The following night he went off, and it was soon found out that he was greatly in debt. He was taken, but suffered to escape in a somewhat mysterious manner. It was only conjectured that Mr. Aubrey knew who he was ; it was generally supposed he was a spy on the other prisoners. He was a fine-looking man, and affected great consequence, holding regular levees, when the other prisoners went to pay their respects. He lodged somewhere in Upper Brook-street, near to the Schools. I remember seeing the following written in the Album then kept at Porkington Cottage : — Sweet Cotage adieu ! You recollects to my imagination the happy scenes of my youth. Your presence softens the horrors of my captivity. Edward Count de Crillon. Some tinie afterwards I cut out from a newspaper a para- graph saying he was supposed to be “ Henry,” a person well-known in America, but I forget for what reason he was notable. F. [Any records of the life of the French prisoners in Os- westry, 1812-14, will be acceptable. When Price’s History of Oswestry was published in 1815, their residence here was too recent to come under the head of ‘History,’ and when Mr. Cathrall issued his book in 1855, he does not seem to have troubled himself about the subject, — Ed.] DYVRDWY (Jan. 2, 1878). — Canon Williams of Rhydycroesau denies the correctness of my etymology of Dyfrdwy. The affix dwy he will have to mean ‘black,’ not ‘ divine’ or ‘ sacred,’ as I had asserted in the Cymmro- dor ; and he desires to credit himself with the discovery. He moreover asserts that I derived my knowledge from Dr. Owen Pughe. He is wrong on all points. In deal- ing with his assertions, I will reverse their order. I have not to this hour consulted the lexicographer he mentions. Nor is he the discoverer of the theory that dwy is another form of du. If he will turn to Pennant’s Tour in Wales: London, 1810, vol. ii., page 215, he will find that Pennant, a century ago, combatted that particu- lar etymon : it was doubtless the received opinion of his day. Turning to the point in question, his etymology is equally erroneous. To refute the editor of the Cymmrodor he has recourse to his dictionaries. It is almost a pity he should have disturbed the sleep to which scholars liave latterly consigned those relics of a byegone time. A more unreliable set of books (excepting, perhaps, Davies’s and Lhwyd’s limited compilations) never came from the press. I do not say they are worthless. They have had, and still have, their use. But on any crucial point no dependence can be placed on their authority. Since their appearance in the world the science of comparative phi- lology has sprung into being, and with a vigour that causes those lesser lights to pale before it ; though very little light is needed to elucidate the question now in point. Dwy., or dwyf, is the root of dwyfol, ‘divine,’ ‘sacred.’ It is congenital with of the Sanscrit, dea of the Latin, thea of the Greek, dia of the Irish, done of the Breton, and dwyw of the old Welsh. It will be found in com- position in Gwasdioy, or Gwasduy as the Record of Carnarvon has it, and Meudwy ; in both of which instances its meaning is ‘ divine.’ But as I do not wish to assert philological views ex cathedra^ I will give a quotation from an author whose linquistic re- searches are of European reputation. If Canon Williams will turn to Rhys’s Lectures on Welsh Philology, page 325, Jan., 1878. BYE-GONES he will read as follows : — “ The Dee, Deva, probably means ‘the goddess’ ” (that is in contradistinction to the masculine j ‘god’), “and as the river is still called in Welsh Dyfrdioy j or Dyfrdwyf, ‘ the water of the Divinity, &c, ’ ” So writes I Mr. Rhys. But the Canon would twist dtoy or dwyf, into da to uphold his theory. This etymology is again confirmed in the Arcliceologia Camhrensis by a writer who signs himself “ Cereticus,” an accomidished Welsh scholar, whose opinions we may regard as endorsed by the Editor, the Rev. D. Silvan Evans, or they would not have ! appeared in that journal. (Vol. 5, of the 4th Series, page ! 86.) “ The forms Dioyf and Dwyio (pi., dioyfau and dioyio- : iau) are not unfrequently met with, being modifications ! of Daiv (God) ; and in words like Dnyf it is no uncommon practice to drop the final / in pronunciation. From Dvxyf corner dioyfoL (divine), just as duwiol (divine, godly) is formed from Daxu. Both Dyfx'dxoy and Dyfrdwyf are i used in the vernacular for the river Dee.” But what does ■ historical testimony say ? It is all against him. He would ignore Gix'aldus Camhrensis as of comparatively recent date ; and yet Giraldus Avrote eight hundred years ago. Drayton | and Spenser, too, are regarded as mushrooms though they ! sang in the sixteenth century. Does he desire a date j from the days before the flood? Such a record as is said to be found in the pedigree of one of our princely Welshmen, j ‘ About this time the world was created !’ True, no ! mention is made of the myth in our ancient Welsh poems ; | but anyone acquainted with them knows that they deal but little with imaginative questions or legends of this kind. What then, I repeat, is the historical evidence we have from these old writers? Giraldus declares that Deverdoeu, which in our day would be Dyfx'dwyw or Dyfrdxeyf, was gifted with divinity, or the prescience which enabled it to foretell prosperity or adversity to Celts or Saxons. Michael Drayton, in the ninth poem of his Polyolbion, makes Merioneth to declare with pride that : — The pearly Conway’s head, as that of holy Dee, Renowned rivers both, their rising have in me. In the tenth poem he says that : — Twice under earth her crystal head doth run ; | When instantly again Dee’s holiness begun. History or legend had impressed the same idea on Spenser’s mind. In his day it was an ancient character- istic of the river. He says : — And following Dee, which Britons long ygone Did call divine, that doth by Chester tend. Milton with his vast learning was not unacquainted with its history, when he spoke of the land Avhere Deva spreads her xjoizard stream. And what is the language of our Poet Laureate — of him who sings so lovingly and so well our Arthurian romances? Was he ignorant of Celtic legend and myth when he says: As the South-west that blowing Bala lake Fills all the sacred Dee. I trust even these hurried remarks will satisfy Canon Williams that he has erred in this matter ; and that he will not again attempt to destroy an etymology which records one of the most romantic and picturesque “bye- gones” connected with our country and language.

PUNISHMENT BY BURNING.— It was stated in the Annual Register for 1763, a woman, for poisoning her husband, was sentenced at the Chester Spring Assizes, “ to be burnt the third day after conviction, but the sen- tence was respited by the judge till the 23rd [April] on which day she was executed at Bury.” R.J.D. WILSON’S THREE LOGGERHEADS.— On the highway that goes from Mold to Ruthin, about three miles from Mold, by the side of a bridge is an old fashioned road- side public house, called The Loggex'heads which had at one time a sign of real value nailed to the wall, because it was painted by Wilson, but at present the sign is smeared over, and the heads of the two loggerheads on the signboard are almost gone. It appears that the whole had been painted over, possibly for the purpose of reproducing the original sign, but that the work was stopped by the interference of some one who knew the folly of what was about to be done, and then an attempt possibly was made to remove the paint daubed over the original picture, but with very impartial success, as only an indistinct outline of one of the faces can be made out and a portion of the cranium of the other logger- head. The profile of the one that can be faintly seen shows a receding forehead, a somewhat comical, partially turned-up nose, a turned downward mouth. The eye- brow and eye and mouth are those of a conceited noodle, the other profile, that was, has only a part of the skull visible and nothing of the face. They look in opposite directions and are unmistakably at loggerheads with each other. Underneath can be traced with some difficulty, for all has been smeared over with dark paint, the words, xjoe thx'ee loggex'heads. Whether there was the word he after loggex'heads, I could not make out ; possibly, it read originally thus, xjoe three loggex'heads he, the traveller being the third loggerhead. Another inspec- tion proves that the inscription is xve three loggerheads. There is no he, nor any room for it, on the sign. The three words above given can be seen, but there is not a trace of he. The words on the sign are those now given and nothing more. Accuracy in such a thing as a public house sign may be thought of little importance, but I have seen this given as ‘ ‘ xoe three loggerheads 6e’’ in Guide_ Books. It is said that Wilson p)ainted the sign to pay for hospitality received at this inn, and the tenant knew not the treasure he had, and so disfigured, or some one disfigured, what would have been an attraction to his house. The spot is a picturesque one. Opposite and not far from the house, are perpendi- cular rocks, the country around is well wooded, close to is a murmuring river. The house is in a quiet nook, and a place, barring its being a public house, for an artist’s abode. It is a great pity that Wilson’s sign painting has all but gone, but it would be a greater pity to have it touched up by any hand. It stands there a picture of the painter’s chequered life. Wilson is said to have died in the village of Llanverris, which is distant about a mile from the Three Loggerheads, in 1782, and was buried in Mold Churchyard. Iago. LORD CAPEL’S SWORD.— In the vol. of Mont: Coll: for 1875, at p. 161, in a note about the brave old soldier. Sir John Owen of Clenenny (the ancestor of Lord Harlech), Mr. Stanley Leighton says, “There is a rajuer at Porkington, inscribed with these words, ‘ Lord Caj)el the day before his execution presented this swoi d to Sir John Owen, by whom, he said, he was convinced that it would be worn with honour.’ ” The last of the Ovsens who 6 BYE-GONES Jan., 1878 possessed the sword was the late Mr. Owen of Penrhos, who entrusted it to the father of the late Mr. P. J. Croxon, of Oswestry, to convey to Porkington, and it used to be kept, with other old armour, in The Cottage. In the same note, by the way, Mr. Leighton says, “the owner has changed the old name of Porkington, which the house has borne for many centuries, to Brogynton (sic), the name of an encampment in a neighbouring field.” This is scarcely correct. The house has not borne the name of Porkington for many centuries, and Porkington is only a corruption of Brogyntyn. The place originally took its name from Owen Brogyntyn ; and in the 12th century there is evidence to show it was called Broginton, one of the first corruptions of the word. Another corr op- tion— at an early date — was Porkinton, and in 1547, we find it called Porgynton. In a deed of the reign of Hen, 8, it is rightly spelt, Brogyntyn. In the time of Lady Eure (17th century), it was called Porkintan. I fancy Mr. Stanley Leighton’s “many cenLxries” will fade away if he consults authorities, and he will find Porking- ton comparatively recent. Eitz Alan. STONING KING GEOKGE III.— Bread Riots all over the countrj^ in 1795 culminated in an attack on the King as he went to open Parliament on Oct. 29 of that year. One man, it has been said, was taken up be- fore the mayor of Oswestry, suspected of being a ring- leader in the attack, and our district was as unruly as the rest of the kingdom. But the attack on the king resulted in a loud ebullition of loyalty everywhere, and not more so than in Wales and the Borders. A few records of the doings of the time I have culled, and herewith present them : — November 6, 1795. — Public meeting at Shrewsbury for the pur- pose of voting an address of congratulation to the king on his recent escape from the mob as he went to open parliament. The motion for the address was made by John Corbet, Esq., seconded by the Rev. Francis Leighton, who in the course of his speech .said, “ Monarchy (limited, gentle, and beneficent as it is found to be in this kingdom). Monarchy was the real object of the indignation of those deluded men, or rather of their employers; and by striking at the person of the Monarch, they thought they laid the ax to the root.” November 14.— County Address of Congratulation voted to the King by the Shropshire gentry ; moved by Robert Corbett, of Longnor, Esq., and seconded by Rowland Hunt, of Boreatton, Esq., Henry Bevan, Esq., sheriff, presided. November 26. — At a Common Hall, or Public Meeting of the High Steward, Bailiffs, and Burgesses of the Borough of Mont- gomery, ‘ Jones, Town Clerk,’ it was resolved that the Common Seal of the Borough should be affixed to an address of congratu- lation to the King, and sent for presentation to Whitshed Keene, Esq., the member for the Borough. November 30.— County Meeting at Bala for the purpose of voting an address of congratulation to the King. Robert ' Lloyd, Esq., high sheriff, in the chair. An address, moved by Edward Williames Vaughan Salesbury, Esq., of Rug, and | seconded by John Jones, Esq., of Rhagatt, was agreed upon, i Sir R. W. Vaughan, Member for the County, and the high i sheriff, to present the address. December 14. — County Meeting at Welshpool for voting ad- dress of congratulation to the King. Lawton Parry, Esq., sheriff, in the chair. Address moved by Devereux Mytton, and seconded by John Herbert, Esqs. To be presented by Francis Lloyd, Esq , Member for the County. j December 23. — Thomas Bonsall, Esq., high sheriff of Cardi- ganshire. has recived the honour of knighihood, on the occasion of presenting the congratulatory address to his Majesty, on his , late happy escape from the daring attempts of his enemies.

RICHARD POWELL. — The death is recorded, in the Annual Register, for 1795, of “ one of the greatest geniuses Wales produced” during the century. For all this Mr. Williams has left him out of his catalogue of Eminent Welshmen. The notice of Mr. Powell’s death is as follows : — Oct. 19. On the dreary hills betwixt Festiniog and Yspytty, in Denbighshire, on his return on foot from the former place where he had been upon business, Mr. Richard Powell, master of Yspytty school. His body Avas found on the folloAving Wednes- day afternoon, a considerable distance from the road, and it is supposed that night coming on, he being near-sighted, unfortu- nately missed his Avay, and through fatigue had lain down, when death overtook him. His death will be severely felt by his aged mother, whom he had for many years passed maintained out of the small pittance acquired by honest industry. We may say of him, without the least tincture of flattery, that he was one of the greatest geniuses Wales has produced in the present century. Asa Welsh grammarian he was equal to most ; and as a poetical writer his “ Four Seasons ” (for which he gained the Gwyneddigion’s annual medal in 1793 — although contested for by eleven able candidates) will be a lasting monument of his poetic skill. Has this “lasting monument ” survived the 87 years that have passed since it was penned. Anon. REPLIES. THE CASE IS ALTERED QUOTH PLOWDEN (Jan. 9, 1878). — The saying I have always understood is derived from Edmund Plowden, the eminent lawyermen- tioned by Mr. Salisbury in his list published Aug. 16,1877. According to Hulbert’s medley, called a History of the County, Plowden “ was treasurer for the society of the Middle Temple in 1572, when their magnificent hall was built, and was a great advancer of it himself.” The popular belief of the origin of the saying, Mr. Hulbert says, is this : — “That being trepanned to hear Mass, he found that the pretender to officiate was no priest, but a mere layman, whereupon he flew back and would not hear it, saying, ‘ The case is altered, No Priest no Mass.’” ScROBBES Byrig. Hartshorne says that this phrase originated in the unexpected decisions of Judge Plowden. He was a Shrop- shire man, and was made a sergeant in the reign of Mary. Being a Catholic he obtained no preferment under Eliza- beth. Nemo. The origin of this old saying was given in Notes and Queries, Nov. 21, 1857. I hav’nt the vol. at hand or would copy the reply. Ty;ro. Dr. Brewer says Plowden w^as a priest who was in- veigled to attend mass performed by a layman, and then impeached for so doing. Before the tribunal he asked the accuser if he was the man who officiated, and on the man replying that he was, said, “ That alters the case, for it is an axiom with the church, ‘ No priest, no mass.’ ” (See “Dictionary of Phrase and Fable,”) Spot, Jan., 1878. BYE-GONES 7 JANUARY 30, 1878. NOTES. “THANK YOU FOR ME.” — This expression is still occasionally used in the Oswestry district, where parties confer favoiirs on those a little lower in the social scale than themselves. For instance, a lady will entertain to a meal a “ poor but honest peasant ” — who has perhaps once been her servant — and who, when she rises from the Wpitable board, drops a curtsy, and says, “Thank you /or me.” N.W.S. WILSON’S GRAVE. — This stands near the en- trance to a small incongruous vestry lately built to Mold Church. The tomb is what is called an altar-table tomb. The inscription is cut into the top or table of the tomb, and is as follows: — “The Remains of Richd. Wilson, Esqr., Member of the Royal Academy of Artists. Interrd. May 15th, 1782, aged 69.” This tomb was erected by subscrip- tion. It is like many other tombs in the churchyard. After the above inscription come two englynion. These were the result for a competitive meeting or Eisteddfod held in Mold in 1851. There were twenty-six competitors for the prize for the best englynion to the memory of Wilson ; Caledfryn was the adjudicator, and he awarded the palm to the author of the lines that are now on the tomb, and which are as follows : — O foreu i yrfa eirian, — rhoi oleu Ei athrylith allan ; Darluniai— clilynai’n Ian, I’r linell ar ol anian. Yn Haw ei oes bu’n llesol,— dyg iddi Deg addysg gelfyddol ; A’i gy wir waith geir o’i ol, A syna’r oes bresenol. When at Mold I was told that some time ago a few gentle- men from the Royal Academy visited the grave, and one of them threw himself across the tomb, uttering the words “ Oh for the spirit of Wilson.” There is some talk about placing a stained window to Wilson’s memory in the church opposite his resting place. Iago. ■ OLD OSWESTRIANS. — Echvarcl Wynne Evans. Mr. Evans was a mercer in the town last century, and that he was one of Oswestry’s leading men is proved by the fact that his name appears in the list of Mayors— at a period when such an office did not go-a-begging, as in these degenerate days ; but was an honour eagerly coveted. He filled the office in 1782-3. He was the first treasurer appointed by the Oswestry Incorporation, when the parishes were amalgamated in 1791. This ap- pointment was no doubt due to the fact that Mr. Evans was a banker as well as a mercer. In 1792, when there was a scare aP through the country lest seditious meet- ings should be held for the spread of Republican princi- ples, Oswestry, in public meeting assembled, declared its^ loyalty, and opened a subscription list to back its opinion. The amounts subscribed were to be “ paid into Messrs. E. W._ Evans and Co’s bank.” Also in 1794, when subscriptions were solicited for increasing the Militia, money raised at Oswestry was to be paid to ‘ ‘Messrs. Edward W ynne Evans an d Co. ” This would imply that Mr. Evans hadapartner, inthebank, atleast,and the minutes oi the Oswestry Incorporation state that, in 1792, Mr. Evans being appointed Deputy-Mayor of Oswestry, by Mr. Mytton of Halston — who was our chief-magistrate for that year — he “ being liable to serve as a director,” in virtue of his office as acting mayor, “ Mr, Edward Birch Marriott was appointed treasurer.” Mr. Marriott was, I presume, Mr. Evans’s partner, for in 1799 when “ Mr. Croxon, draper,” was appointed treasurer, he is stated, in the same minutes, to have succeeded “Messrs. Evans and Marriott” in the office. Was Marriott partner in shop and bank ? In an advertisement of 1801, in connec- tion with the trade of mercer and draper, we have “ Mar- riott and Arrowsmith.” Many of our middle-aged Oswes- try readers will remember Mr. Marriott, and his sister, who survived him.

Church-street was called up to 1670 “ Street yr Velyn.” Brook-street was called up to 1720 “ Street yr Abbot.” Information as to the reason of these changes would be interesting. J.P.J. A NEWTOWN PISCATOR.— In the Cambrian Quarterly Magazine for July, 1830, Vol. 2, p. 386, the following death is recorded — “ Mr. Henry Williams, the Isaac Walton of Newtown, Montgomeryshire.” Was Williams in any way remarkable? The fact of his death being recorded in the Gam. Quar. does not prove it, be- cause from the number of nobodies whose deaths are announced one would be led to supiDose that the obituary was a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. Taffy. REPLIES. JOHN MORGAN, M.P., (Jan. 9, 1878).— The paragraph supplied from an old scrap book forms the con- cluding part of the obituary notice in the Gentleman^s Magazine for 1792, p. 673, of John Morgan, who was one of the M.P.’s for Monmouthshire in 1790-92. As the pre- ceding portion of the notice may prove of interest to archaeologists who have not the above-named volume at hand, it is hereunto appended: — Death June 27, 1792. At his seat at Tredegar, co. Monmouth, John Morgan, Esq., M.P. for that county. In advanced life he married a lady [Louise, daughter of Ch Pym Burt, Esq., of London], considerably younger than himself, with the hope of an heir, in which he was more than once disappointed, and she has, since his death, experienced her usual ill-fortune, so that the heirs of this opulent and antient house are the sons of Sir Charles Gould, .Judge-advocate, and of the late Mr. Van, of Lanwerne, married to the sisters [Jane and Catherine] of Mr. Morgan. — By Mr. M’s death, Col. Gould, son of Sir C, comes to an estate of nearly 30,OOOZ. per annum, and a parliamentary influence as follows : Monmouthshire, represented by the late Mr. Morgan ; county of Brecon, by Sir Charles Gould; town of Brecon, by Col. Gould.— Mr. Morgan was in the South of Wales, &c. In page 863 of the same volume the following correction is added: — Ibid, [i.e. p. 673] Mr. Morgan’s sister, Lady\" Gould, is living of course her son is not heir to Mr. M. 8 BYE-GONES Jan., 1878. Lady Gould died in 1797. Her demise is recorded in the Gentleman's Magazine for that year, p. 357, thus : — Sufldenly, at her house on Ejiham-hill, Lady Gould, relict of the late Hon. Mr. Justice G. On the 11th of April, her remains were intei-red in the family-vault at Stapleford Abbots, Essex. Mr. Morgan is said to have bequeathed Tredegar and the greater part of his property to his sister. Lady Gould, and her eldest son, Sir Charles Morgan, who subsequently was raised to the peerage, and became the late Lord Tredegar, and accordingly came into possession of the estate. The above statement that Lady Gould was a relict is incorrect, for Sir Chaides, who by roya^ licence assumed the name of Morgan, survived her nine years. The following record of his decease is transcribed from the Gentleman's Magazine for 1806, p. 1180. Dec. 7. At his seat at Tredegar, co. Monmouth, in his 82d year, beloved and respected by all who knew him, the Right Hon. Sir Charles Morgan, Bart, (so created Oct. 30, 1792), LL.D., many years military judge advocate-general, and representative in six Parliaments for the County of Brecon. No man was more attached to his Sovereign, or more zealous for the good of his country; in private life most honourable, sincere in his friend- ship, charitable and humane. He is succeeded in title and estate by his son, Colonel Morgan, of Ruperra, M.P. for the county of Monmouth. According to the pedigree of the Morgan family, John Morgan, M.P., had two brothers, namely Thomas, who was born in 1727, and died unmarried in 1771, and Charles, born in 1736, and died in 1787. But which of the two with his brother John, found so much money in the house of his immediate ancestor as to have been under the necessity of dividing it with him by shovels-ful is best known to those who are in possession of the traditions of the family. Llallawg. ADERYN-Y-CORPH (Jan. 9, 1878).— The note of your correspondent Llallawg upon the Aderyn-y-corph is interesting, and his remarks as to the origin of the local superstition in the distortion of natural facts are doubtless correct. As to the Biblical references, however, I think it is impv)ssible to assume “that by the little owl, screech owl, yr wyll, and aderyn-y-corph one and the same bird is meant and this for the following reasons : — The word translated into the Welsh “aderyn-y-corph,” and into the English “little owl” in Lev. xi., 17,. and Lent, xiv., 16, occurs also in Psalm cii., 7 (6 in the English and Welsh versions), where it is rendered by the Welsh “ dylluan,” and by the English “ owl.” But the Hebrew word in all these passages is “ kos,” a name doubtless given to a bird, but having as its first meaning “a hollow receptacle” or “cup:” whence it seems probable that this name was, after the Hebrew manner, descriptive not of the owl, but of the pelican, a bird having a “cup” or “pouch” in its flexible lower mandible. In the English Bible “pelican” is the usual translation, whether correct or not I cannot say, of the Hebrew ‘gaath;’ as in Lev. xi., 18., Deut. xiv., 17, and Psalm cii., 6, wherein the English agrees with the Septuagint version. As to Isaiah xxxiv. 14, where the Welsh version is “ wyll,” the English “ screech owl,” it is by no means certain that a bird is meant, most probably not so. The Hebrew word ‘lyilyith’ means simply the “nightly one” or “night monster,” from ‘ layil,’ ‘ night’ ; and it is supposed by some that Isaiah expressed by this word rather a popular .superstition as to the existence of a monster supposed to haunt ruins than any real animal. This agrees with the Septuagint translation of that passage, where the word is ‘ onokentauros,’ a monster with a quasi human shape. There are beliefs in the existence of similar evil beings existent amongst the Arabs and other Eastern races at this time. The sum of the Biblical evidence which Llallawg adduces is therefore as follows : — That in Lev. xi. 17, and Deut. xiv. 16, to which I add Ps. cii. 6, a bird is certainly signified by the same Hebrew word, but whether the ‘ owl ’ or another kind of bird is a matter for discussion. In Isaiah xxxiv. 14 it is more than doubtful if the word ‘ lyilyith’ signify a bird at all. I think, there- fore, we cannot with any certainty identify the screech owl, or the Aderyn-y-corph of Welsh legend and of the Welsh Bible with the bird called by the Hebrews ‘ kos’ in the passages cited. E.P. CURRENT NOTES. An interesting celebration was held last month in the parish of St. Paul’s, near Penzance— namely, the centenary of the ex- tinction of the old Cornish language. It was last spoken by a venerable woman, who died at Mousehole, just 100 years ago, and was buried in St. Paul’s parish. The proceedings were attended by a large number of fishermen and farmers, and after a “ Cornish tea” Mr. W. C. Borlase, a descendant of Dr. Bor- lase, the Cornish antiquary, presided, and explained the early history of the county. Of the Cornish language, he said, no literary relics prior to the thirteenth century \"had been yet found, although Welsh literature was very rich from an early date. The Rev. W. S. Lach Szyrma, vicar of Newlyn, followed with an explanation of the position of the Cornish in the Aryan family of languages. He said the European languages were like a chain, of which Cornish was one link, and that link was of great interest to philologists. The Cornish Language belonged to the Celtic division, and was nearest to the Breton and Welsh, and like the Irish, the Manx, and the Gaelic. He gave a sum- mary of the existing relics of Cornish literature. The Vicar of St. Just had to translate the Bishop of Exeter’s sermon to the people of St. Buryan. The language was not quite dead, for it still affected the Cornish dialect, the accent of which was foreign, and also many expressions. A number of local words were given (still in use), with their Welsh and Breton congeners, and their connection was shown with other Aryan languages. The William Salt Library at Stafford contains a Reli- gious Census of the Province of Ca.nterbury for the year 1676, made “ in pursuance of a letter from the Rt. Rev. Father in God, Henery, Lord Bishop of London, to give an account of the number of Inhabitants, Papists, and other Dissenters.” The totals for the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield are as follows : — 155,720 Conformists, 5,042 Nonconformists, 1,949 Papists. The whole province was reported to contain 2,123,362 Conformists, 93,154 Noncon- formists, 11,870 Papists. The North Wales Chronicle tells the following story, for the truth of which it vouches — Some seventy years ago, as the Sir Watkin Wynn of those days was riding in the neighbourhood of Wrexham, he heard a man singing in a cooper’s workshop, with whose voice he was much struck. It was a person of the name of Meredith, who possessed a splendid bass voice. Sir Watkin had him instructed, and he became celebrated as a singer of sacred music. He was engaged at the ancient concerts, oratorios, &c., but he resided chiefly at Liverpool. Having heard that a parish clerk of a village in the Vale of Clwyd, of the name of Griffiths, could sing down to double C, Meredith was de- termined to visit him. He accordingly started, and walked about forty miles. When he arrived in the village he inquired for (jriflSths. A very little fellow, digging potatoes in a garden, was pointed out to him. “ What,” thought Meredith, “that shrimp of a thing to sing lower than I can ? Impossible !” Meredith, it is said, was a. fine, tall man, upwards of six feet high. He walked around the garden, eyeing poor Griffiths disdainfully ; at length he said, upon low G, “ Good day to you, sir.” Griffiths, resting on his -spade, replied on double low C (five notes lowjrj, “ Good day to you, sir.” Upon which Meredith marched off with double C ringing in his ear, all the way to Liverpool. BYE-GONES 9 Feb., 1878. FEBRUARY 6. 1878. OWAIN\" BROGYNTYN.— In reference to the note of Fitzalan Jan. 23, under the heading “Lord Capel’s Sword” a correspond- ent suggests that it would be more correct to say that Owain Brogyntyn took his name from that of the previously existing one of the township, than that the castle took its name from him There is no doubt the place was called Broginton in the 12th century, and has undergone several variations in spelling since. But according to Lady Eure’s will it would seem that at one time the house went under a new name alto- gether, for her ladyship speaks o^ it as “ Constables Hall, in the township of Porkinton.” NOTES. THE SHELTON OAK. — It was stated in the Salopian Magazine for 1815, that there was_ “sufficient room for at least half a dozen to take a snug dinner” inside Shelton Oak. I have been told that eight persons have been known to dance a quadrille in it ; and it will interest Shropshire readers to know that there is at least one flourishing tree existing, raised from an acorn of this oak. The tree in question is at Pentreheylin, and is on the right side just as you pass the entrance gate. It was planted about 1832 by the late_Mrs. Croxon, of Oswestry. Jaeco. THE DUKE D’ALEMBEKG.— The name of this Erench prisoner was mentioned J an. 16. When he was at Oswestry he got up concerts of instrumental music among his fellow-captives, and sometimes they performed in the ball-room at the Wynnstay Arms Hotel, and there was free admittance for any one who liked to hear them. F. WREXHAM RACES. — At the top of the List of Entries for the Wrexham Meeting of Oct. 1833, is given the names of the winners of^the “ Wrexham Gold Cup,” as follows : — Yn. Oitmers. 1815 Mr. F. R.

Why were there no races in 1825? W.M. OSWESTRY TOWN SEAL.— It is stated in Price’s History of Osvjestry, p. 27, that “the oak branch on the seal of King Oswald, as mentioned in the MS. of John Davies, Esq., Recorder, 1635, was a mere ornament, as on those of the bailiffs of Shrewsbury, and several royal seals of the time of Edw. I.” The writer of Price’s History mentions this incidentally in his descrip- tion of New Gate that spanned the junction of Church and Cross streets up to the last quarter of last century, xxxx Over the gateway there was a “ horse with an oak branch in its mouth,” which “was the crest of the Fitzalans, and is borne by the present earl-marshal of England, as the dexter supporter of his shield.” The writer adds, “There is a very ancient carving of the horse and oak bough in the old house at Trenewydd, near Whittington.” It is certainly not right to quote the Recorder of 1635 as the authority for saying that the oak branch on Os- westry seal was a mere ornament, for in an abstract of his MS. kindly sent me by “H.W.L.” I find the author — writing of the name “ Maserfield,” as applied to the town, remarking : — This Saxon name was derived (as app’th) from the oulde Brittishe name thereof Messen, which in the oulde Brittish & ac- cordinglie in our modern Welsh signifieth an accorne, mees [mesT in the plurall number Acornes, meserie glandium copia and Mesbren an oake or the acornetree whence the Saxon Meserfelth (soe written bv Beda) or Maserfield by the other historians <fc Antiquaries (1) : Both being the same in sense & neere in sound signitie glandium 'campus & semblably the ould Britaynes called this towne Tre’r fesen glandium urbem. & accordingly the Welsh poet Llosgoth ffagloth i phen Trwy oer fisif tre’r fesen. Hereupon the Normans afterwards implying the reason & ren- dering the meaning of this antient Brittish name did call it Glanvill or Glandeville Glandium Villa : & the Welsh Bards some- times Tre-Koderi (i.e., coed deri, oak-wood), The towne of great oakes as being situate in a soil then full of greate oakes growing thereupon, & compassed therewith for a spacious distance & largo circuit on every side, and therefore (as I suppose) the oaken bough was antientiy the armes of the towne of Oswestry ; for upon their ould com’on seale of brasse (called the towne seale) I finde depicted a kinge (in all likelihood Kinge Oswald) sittinge on a chaire, houlding a sword in his hand, and in his left hand an oaken bough. So that when the noble owner of that antient crest the white horse came first to be owner and also Baron of Oswestry, whether to evidence his love, or to add honr to the Towne, or taking it as an honr to be Lord of the Towne, or either, he put the oaken bough into his white horses mouth, of which white horse & of that right noble peer whose crest it was, one made this disticon Hie alacer sonipes niveo candore superbus Est gentilicii nobile ste’ma sui. There is a further note, in the abstract before me, in which it is stated that the author of the MS. differs from the common account given of the origin of this crest, viz,, a race between twins to a standing oak, taken for his crest by the winner. Jaeco. (1) Marginal Note. “ Maesbury, a hamlet in the P’ish of Os- westry, is now called Llys feisiror llys feisidd [feisydd].” QUERIES, “THE ENGLISHMAN’S RIGHT.”— This is the title of a tract reprinted in 1785, by T. Wood, of Shrews- bury, and stated to be the seventh edition of a “ Dia- logue between a Barrister-at-law and a juryman,” written by “Sir John Hawles, Knight, Solicitor General to the late King William.” This edition is dedicated “to the Rev. William Davies Shipley, D.D., Dean of St. Asaph,” doubtless because of the celebrated case, tried at Shrews- bury a year or two earlier, in which he was the defendant. In the preface we are told that an English jury “has a right to give a general verdict on a question of Law, arising out of, or necessarily included in, the question of Fact before them in an indictment or information, for a supposed Libel, cannot be more fully evinced than it was in the case of the King v. Owen, in the year 1752.” Who was Owen ? And can any of your readers give us an out- line of the Trial of the Dean ? Tell. [We hope some day to give an outline of the two triala of the Dean of St. Asaph. — Ed.] 2 10 BYE-GONES. Feb., 1878 WELSH CRUSADERS. — In a note on page 441 of Robson’s translation of Michaud’s History of the Crusades, vol. 1, we have the following : — There is extant in Latin an account of the journey of Archbishop Baldwin through the country of Wales, entitled Itinerarium Cambrice, drawn up by Barry, who accompanied the preacher of the crusade. This journey is curious, from the singular prodi- gies and miracles which are related in it. If this relation may be credited. Archbishop Baldwin neglected no means to induce the people to take the cross ; he enrolled one day, says Barry, a great number of men who came to him in a state of nudity, their clothes being secreted by their wives and Mends, who wished to prevent their going. Has any translation of the Welsh Itinerary of Giraldus, in an accessible form, ever been published, and is it to be procured ? Tyro. BARDIC SEAT OF GENIUS.— The writer of an interesting paper in the December No. of the Cornhill Magazine, entitled “The Celt of Wales and the Celt of Ireland,” in which the Welsh and Irish are compared, and contrasted greatly in favour of the former, styles Cader Idris the “ bardic seat of genius.” What does the author mean by this ? Gogledd. REPLIES. MR. TOMKINSON OF NANTWICH (Jan. 9, 1878). — I fancy the term “eminent” as applied to Mr. Tomkinson, was only a figure of speech. Last century, and early in this, solicitors in anything like a large way of business were generally so called. An instance I have before me in “Robert Hall’s Life of the Rev. T. N. Toller,” [a son of whom was once an Independent minister in this town] where the author says of the subject of his memoir, “ His father was an attorney of eminence in the populous village of South Petherton, and two of his sons were educated for that profession.” Indeed the term was not confined to solicitors, as may readily be ascertained by reference to old magazines and newspapers. We are told, for instance, of the death, in 1797, of “Mr. Griffith, an eminent mercer and ironmonger in Wem in 1799 of the death of “Mr. George Stoakes, late an eminent timber merchant, in Oswestry also under date of 1811 1 have Been a reference to a “Mr. Jones, an eminent brandy- merchant of St. Mary’s Hill.” And in Bye-gones very recently in the autobiography of Thomas Olivers, his uncle is described as “an eminent farmer in the parish of F^rden.” G. Wem, Salop. [The terms “eminent,” “ingenious,” and “ respectable,” were very favourite ones with the journalists of last century, and doubtless meant nothing more than compliment.— Ed.] NASH POINT (Jan. 23, 1878).— In Traces of History in the Names of Places, the name Nash is derived from Ncesse, a promontory, and the following examples are given : — Nash Scaur (Rads.), the cliff promontory • Nash (Pemb.); and Nash (Mon.) _ Another name, that of Nash in the union of Bridgend, might be added to the list. Mr. Joyce, in his Irish Names of Places (ed. 1871, p. 429), has the following remarks: — “The word ros signifies first a promontory, or peninsula, secondly a wood ; and it has other significations which need not be noticed here. . . . A well-known example is Ross Castle, on the lower lake of Killarney, so called from the little ros or point on which it was built.” Muck ros, the peninsula of pigs; Rossbehy, birchy point ; Rossinver, the peninsula of the inver or river mouth: Rossory, eastern peninsula; Rost ruis, the landing place of the peninsula, and other examples are given. Is Rhas the Welsh form of the Irish word, and is its presence on our coasts another “Vestige of the Gael” in Gwalia? H. FEBRUARY 13. 1878. NOTES. VALENTINES. — Walking one market day up the road leading from Oswestry to Trefonnen, I passed a couple of women ; one going homewards with a pig, and the other coming t :> market with a basket. As I passed them I heard the following request and reply : — “If yo see Ann Davies say as ime gone ’ome ” “ I wool” The last words remind me of an old valentine story I heard when a boy, and which was vouched for as happening on the borders. A young farmer sent a “ serious ” valentine to the daughter of a neighbour, with a few lines added in which he put an important question. The lady, who could not write, was too proud or too shy to call in as- sistance, in replying ; so she got a box and into it placed a sheep’s eye and a bit of wool ! [This was casting sheep’s eyes with a vengeance.] The answer was complete and, let us hope, the pair were united in happy bonds of lasting bliss. Half a century ago “serious ” valentines were more common than in this more educated age, and often meant business. I have heard my father say that not long after he set up in business in Oswestry, a young farmer of the neighbourhood bought from him a valentine— with the traditional brace of hearts, on a skewer before a roasting fire, fanned by Cupid— and asked him if he would be so kind as to add a few lines expressive of his devotion to a damsel, to whom he also addressed it ; of course under a bond of secresy. On the following Wednesday into his shop came a young woman ; who produced the valentine, and with many blushes, asked my father to write for her a few suitable lines on another valentine, in reply. He did so ; again being under the bond of secresy. A few months elapsed, when the couple called to thank my father for what he had done. They had got married ; and, added my father, “ they were customers at my shop for years afterwards.” Jarco. TRIAL OF CHARLES I. — You have already had several references to Col. Jones, one of the King’s judges; but so far no contributor has noted the fact that several of the witnesses were connected with Shropshire and Wales I have before me Nalson’s Trial of Charles the First, and find the following parties giving evidence : — William Brayne, of Wixhall, in the county of Salop, gent. ; Edward Roberts, of Bishop’s-castle, in the county of Salop, iron- monger; Samuel Morgan, of Wellington, in the county of Salop, feltmaker; John Thomas, of Llangollen, in the county of Denbigh, husbandman ; Diogenes Edwards, of Carston, in the county of Salop, butcher ; Gyles Gryce, of Wellington, in Shropshire, gent. ; also a couple from Monmouthshire, &c. The evidence of Roberts related to the King’s doings at Shrewsbury ; and another witness, a Yorkshireman, testified that he heard the King, at the head of his army on Hounslow Heath, “ incourage several regiments of Welshmen (then being in the field) which had run away at Edge-hill, saying to them. That he did hope they would regain their honour at Brentford, which they had lost at Edge-hill.” D. QUERIES. SMALL NOTES. — In looking over some old newspapers the other day, I came across an account of a public meeting convened by the High Sheriff of Denbigh- shire, on the 16th of J une, 1828, at which petitions to both Houses of Parliament against the “Bill for Sup- pressing the Circulation of Small Notes” were agreed to. Feb., 1878. BYE-GONES. 11 No arguments advanced at the meeting are given in the report ; and I am at a loss to know, first, why it was de- sired by Parliament to suppress Pound and Guinea Notes ; and, second, in what way they were so useful to county gentlemen that they should act in so vigorous a manner in trying to retain them ? Tyro. QUEEN VICTORIA’S HEAD.— In divers parts of the Principality we have remarkable rocks that are supposed to assume a likeness to celebrated individuals ; but of the fallowing I never heard until a few days ago, in the record of a tour performed five-and-thirty years ago, in Merionethshire. The writer is descending the route from Dolgelley to Talyllyn : — The sterile heights stoop over the valley until they almost meet ; the road runs along a steep which hangs above a torrent- stream brawling and winding below. All kinds of fanciful shapes appear on the eminences, some of which have been named according to the passing thought of the observer. Queen Victoria’s Head is supposed to rise above the rest, and near her is a rock Penydelyn, from its resemblance to a harp. A little further on is Llam-y -Hadron, or the Robbers’ Leap ; for from hence it is said to have been in early days the custom to cast offenders ( See Miss Costello's Tour.) Perhaps some of your local readers will be able to point out the precise spot at which these rocks may be seen ? A correspondent of Bye-gones (May 23, 1877) fixes the locality of Llam-y-lleidr at Harlech, although be believes there are other places to which the same name and tradi- tion attaches. G.G. OSWESTRY THEATRE.— I have before me a couple of playbills of performances in Oswestry Theatre on Wednesday evening, Oct. 26, 1825, and Wednesday evening, Nov. 1, 1826, respectively. The performers at the earlier date include Messrs. Maitland, Gordon, Smith, Wood, Hallam, Stanton, jun., Fairbairn, Mathews, Faw- cett, Kirk, and Scotcher. The actresses were Miss Stan- ton, Mrs. Hallam, Miss H. Stanton, Mrs. Fairbairn, Mrs. Wood, and Mrs. Rowlands. For how long a period did “Stanton’s Company” perform in Oswestry, and were there any actors of note in it ? And whilst I am putting queries on the subject may I ask if any of your readers know what became of the large stone carvings, representing Tragedy and Comedy, that adorned the front of the Theatre in Willow-street, before it was converted into a malt-kiln ? When was the Theatre opened ? Fitz-oswald. REPLIES. “ THANK YOU FOR ME ” (Jan. 30, 1878).— This is one of the many border expressions borrowed from the Welsh, only the latter do not use it as the Borderers do, by saying “ Thank you /or me,” but “ Thank you forme.” For instance a couple of pedestrians will call at a farm house to ask, perhaps, for a draught of milk ; and when they have drunk it, one wiU say, “Diolch i chwi drosta’ I;” or “Diolch yn fawr iawn i chwi drosta’ I;” leaving his comrade to convey like thanks on his own hehalf. Bonwm. WILLIAM CURETON (Jan. 30, 1878).— A brief memoir of this distinguished Salopian scholar appeared in Salopian Shreds and Patches^ Dec. 20, 1876. It is there stated that His principal publications are— 1. “Tanchumi Hierosolymitani Commentarius in Lamentationes.” 2. “Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects, by Mohammed Al-Sharastani.” 3. “A Brief Exposition of the Principal Tenets of the Sunnites, by Al-Nasan.” 4. “The Ancient Syriac Version of the Epistles of St. Ignatius.” 5. “ Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Arabi- corum qui in Museo Britannico asservantur.” 6. “ Vindicise Ignatianee, or the Genuine Writings of St. Ignatius, as ex- hibited in the Ancient Syriac Vei’sion, vindicated from the charge of Heresy.” 7. “ Corpus Ignatianum ; a Complete CoUection of the Ignatian Epistles, genuine, interpolated, and spurious.” 8. “The Festal Letters of Athanasius, discovered in an Ancient Syriac Version.” 9. “The Ecclesiastical History of John, Bishop of Ephesus.” 10. “ Fragments of the Iliad of Homer, from a Syriac Palimpsest.” 11. “ Spicilegium Syriacum, con- taining remains of Bardesan, Meliton, Ambrose, and Mara Bar Serapion.” 12. “ Remains of a very Ancient Recension of the Four Gospels, in Syriac.” 13. “Three Sermons preached at the Chapel Royal, St. James’s.” 14. “ Sermon preached before the Corporation of Trinity House,” &c. From this it may be inferred that he was the author of other works not mentioned. It will be seen that Salopiensis refers to 7 works out of the 14 given above. W.H. NAMES OF OSWESTRY STREETS (Jan. 30, 1878). — “ J.P.J.” states that he finds, in deeds dating back 300 years, or so, “ Beatrice Street ” called “ Bettridge Street,” and that it has been so spelt 200 years later. Like the name of our town itself, the street has been spelt in various ways. Leland tells us of Betericke gate, and Harrison (1564) calls the street Beterich, and its gate “the Baderickes or Baderish gate.” Of the origin of the name we are told in Price’s History of Oswestry, pp. 27-8, that “ it was probably erected by Thomas, Earl of Arundel, in the beginning of the reign of Hen. IV., who named it in compliment to his wife, Beatrice, natural daughter to the King of Portugal.” In Edwards’s History, we have a similar paragraph, only with the name spelt “Beatrix.” They neither of them quote their authorities, but they evidently copy from Pennant. Where Pennant got his information from I cannot say : it would appear that he had seen Davies's MS. in the British Museum ; as he quotes it elsewhere ; and as the subject in question happens to be in the abstract of the MS., I referred to (Feb. 6) as having been copied by a contributor to Bye-gones, I am able to present to its readers what our Recorder of 1635 said as to the origin of the name : — Some say that the castle-gate called Beatrice gate was built in Henry the 2ncl’s time by Beartrix (sic) or Betrard a greate Lady daughter of Simon Earl of Mountford and Eureux [Evreux] in Normandy wief of Hugh Kiviliog (qu. Cy veiliog] the 5th Earl Pala- tine of Chester. This Lady travailing that way fell there in Labour, & was delivered of a son named Randolph Earl of Chester and Lincoln who was surnamed Blandevill because hee was borne in Powis in a Towne called Album Monasterium [one of the Saxon names of our town]. But others say that gate was built by another greate Lady named Beatrice daughter of King John of Portingall (sic) & married to Thomas Earl of Arundell <fc Surrey 1405 in the p’sence of Henry the 4th Kinge of Englande (p. 6. b). In quite modern times, as a contributor once stated, Beatrice Street was commonly called “ Stryt y Petris,” by our Welsh neighbours over Cyrn-y-bwch ; and letters were sometimes addressed to “ Partridge Street.” Jarco. I have seen it stated, on the authority of an old deed that Brook Street, a century and a half ago, was called Oswald Street, and Street yr Aber. Th"
