        "meta_description": "Lord Hill's Column stands tall outside Shirehall in Shrewsbury and is one of the most notable landmarks in town. While it is shorter that the 'Monument to British Liberty' at Gibside, the overall height of the column and statue is higher in total, and you still need to crane your neck to catch a glimpse of it! It is, however, the tallest Doric column in the country measuring almost 41 meters (134 feet) and was built between 1814 and 1816. Two architects, Edward Haycock Senior, and Thomas Harrison, worked on the project. The pedestal is square shaped and has horizontal lions lying flat.",
