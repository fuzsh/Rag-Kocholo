        "text": "Tregaron is an ancient market town that sits astride the River Brenig, a tributary of the renowned Teifi. Strictly speaking we should be saying “Mae Tregaron yn dref farchnad hynafol sy'n eistedd ar hyd Afon Brenig, un o lednentydd y Teifi enwog” because most people in the town speak Welsh and the simple, almost Spartan but nevertheless attractive layout of buildings around the central square somehow seems to ooze Welsh tradition and history. If you don’t speak Welsh though, don’t worry: people here are extremely friendly and will happily speak English to you all day.\n\nThe square is dominated by a statue of Henry Richard, a congregational minister and Welsh Member of Parliament between 1868 and 1888. He was a strong voice for peace, international arbitration and the end of slavery and was known as the Apostle of Peace.\n\nTo call Tregaron a town is technically correct but it has more of a size and feel of a village. In some ways it is a step back in time to when everything was much more local. Very few places of its size today can boast what it has: a hospital, a secondary school, a doctor’s surgery, two mini-markets, three butchers, a chemist, a baker’s, a large hotel, two major agricultural suppliers, a builder’s merchant, an auction mart and a leisure centre. Oh, and there is an annual rock festival and in 2022 the national Welsh music, arts and culture festival - the Eisteddfod - took place here.\n\nThere is also a small community museum - the Red Kite Centre - and a must-visit is the Welsh Gold Centre where Rhiannon makes fine, and very expensive, gold jewellery. You can watch her working, browse the gold rings or take in the broader arts centre behind. Gold has been mined in Wales since Roman times and most recently in the 1980s. Rhiannon holds much of the remaining stock of true Welsh gold.\n\nJust outside the town is the Riverbank Café with a great menu and a Welsh produce shop attached.\n\nIt might be officially only a town but to the people of Ceredigion, Aberystwyth is the big city. As the only sizeable settlement in this part of western Wales, it contains everything. There is a rare railway terminus here, some banks – an equally unusual find in West Wales – supermarkets, an A&E hospital, a university, the National Library of Wales and lots of shops selling all the things you need to survive in the modern world.\n\nIt is also a tourist destination with two beaches – North Beach and South Beach – a long promenade, a pier, a castle, a marina, fish and chip shops and so on. Sitting high above it all is Constitution Hill, scaled by the Aberystwyth Cliff Railway. At the top there are panoramic views and other attractions, including a camera obscura. For those who do not know what one of these is, which included ourselves when we moved here, a camera obscura derives from the Latin for “dark chamber” and means “a darkened room with a small hole or lens at one side through which an image is projected onto a wall or table opposite the hole”. Aberystwyth is also the starting point of the Vale of Rheidol Steam Railway, which runs to Devil’s Bridge.\n\nAnd let us not forget the Aberystwyth Arts Centre, frequented by top tribute bands including Darkside (Any guesses? Actually, it is a Pink Floyd tribute act, reference Dark Side of the Moon), What’s Love Got To Do With It (Obviously Tina Turner), Buddy Holly and the Cricketers (No need to give the answer to that one), Jive Talking (Yes, the Bee Gees) and the Illegal Eagles (Obvious again). Real bands might be thin on the ground, although Tom McGuire and the Brassholes performed in 2022. Now you know.\n\nNew Quay was once a flourishing ship-building centre and fishing port. The miles of secluded coves around the town also provided ideal hiding places in the less salubrious, but probably more profitable, trade of smuggling spirits and tobacco. Today small local fishing and pleasure craft still come and go in the sheltered bay.\n\nNew Quay is not to be confused with its rather noisier Cornish cousin, Newquay. But if the number of static caravans sited near here is anything to go by, it is a top destination for summer holidays and it is easy to see why. New Quay’s beaches extend in a golden arc around the bay, the quay is often the perfect spot for dolphin watching, there is a marine life centre and lifeboat station and the choice of eateries is broad. At the head of the quay, the Lime Crab offers huge portions of the best fish and chips you’re likely to find in Wales and you can enjoy them watching the world go by from seats at the far end of the quay.\n\nYou can buy seaside postcards, buckets and spades and everything in between. You can take a boat trip for wildlife watching. But there are some surprises too: see if you can find the basement guitar shop with its retro metal band T-shirt collection!\n\nIt might sound like the name of a nightclub in Ibiza but Strata Florida was once the most famous church in Wales after St David’s, a place of pilgrimage and a linchpin of Welsh culture.\n\nStrata Florida – Latin for Vale of Flowers – has stood on meadows beside the banks of the infant River Teifi since 1201. It was founded by the Norman Robert Fitz Stephen and then hugely developed by Lord Rhys, ruler of the kingdom of Deheubarth. It became a major centre for Cistercian monks as part of a movement that spread across western Europe in the early Middle Ages.\n\nIt was far from an easy life for the monks at Strata Florida. The day began with a church service at 2am, followed by others at 3.30am, 6am, 8am, 11.30am, 2.30pm, 6pm and 8pm, punctuated by work and the occasional meal. Bedtime was at quarter past eight.\n\nWhen Llywelyn ap Lorwerth decided to summon all the Welsh princes to swear allegiance to his son Dafydd in 1238, Strata Florida was the obvious choice as the centre of Welsh culture. But its importance in this respect came at a price: the enmity of the English crown. It was damaged by the wars of King Edward I, weakened by the Black Death and occupied by English troops during the rising of Owain Glyndŵr. The heyday of Strata Florida was long gone by the time Henry VIII dissolved the monasteries. It was partly dismantled in 1539, starting with 10 tons of lead from the roof, and gradually allowed to fall into ruin.\n\nToday a visit to the abbey is a time for quiet contemplation and appreciation of the Cambrian scenery at this high point in the Teifi valley. Not least when you learn it is the final resting place for generations of Mediaeval Welsh princes.\n\nIt is an hour’s drive away but the National Wool Museum at Drefach Felindre near Newcastle Emlyn provides an absorbing experience.\n\nHistorically and into the 19th century, the woollen industry in Wales, including spinning and weaving, surpassed even coal as the most important industry in Wales. The Teifi Valley was the centre of the West Wales woollen industry, earning itself the nickname The Huddersfield of Wales.\n\nThe National Wool Museum is located in the former Cambrian Mills. David Lewis erected the mills on the site of a former small water-powered weaving workshop in 1902. The new mill was to supply the need for woollen cloth for working men in the coal and steel industries. In 1915, 100 people were employed here and flannel was produced for military uniforms for the First World War. Over the years, shirts and shawls, blankets and bedcovers, and woollen stockings and socks were all made here. The mills were still working in 1965, when they were put up for sale with 30 people still employed, but they became a museum in 1976.\n\nThe National Wool Museum is open from Tuesday to Saturday, 10am-5pm, and is free to enter. You can see the sympathetically restored listed mill buildings and historical machinery and follow the whole process from fleece to fabric. If you did not fully know what was involved in shearing, harvesting, sorting, willowing, scouring, dyeing, carding, spinning, winding, warping, weaving and finishing, you will come away from your visit an enlightened person. A raised walkway also gives a unique view of textiles in production at Melin Teifi, today’s commercial woollen mill at the site.\n\nThe Cambrian Mountains are definitely the unsung hero of Wales. The scenery is dramatic and austere but is over-shadowed in terms of popularity by Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons National Parks. Think of this upland area as the neglected child sandwiched between two more admired siblings. The Cambrians were actually proposed as a National Park themselves in the 1960s but it came to nothing.\n\nWhat all this does mean is that few people bother to visit this part of mid-Wales and as a result you can find what perhaps you cannot easily find today in Snowdonia or the Brecon Beacons: peace and solitude.\n\nThe only slight nods towards visitor attractions here are the Elan Valley and, somewhat surprisingly, a phone box and a postbox. It is true. On the road up into the mountains from Tregaron, there is a lonely spot where at some point in the past someone decided it was just the right place for some communications facilities. The slightly bizarre sight of a bright red phone box and postbox in a wide, deserted green landscape attracts the attention of people who come to take pictures of themselves at this far-flung place. You could hardly call the visitors thrill-seekers but nevertheless this location has a fan club and has become iconic. Perhaps you had better go there is see what all the fuss is about.\n\nFor the notebook, the Cambrian Mountains include the sources of the River Severn and River Wye - actually surprisingly close to each other - and the highest point is Plynlimon at 2467 feet (752 metres).\n\nDevil’s Bridge is a well known tourist attraction north of Orchid Meadows. The waterfalls here have attracted many thousands of visitors since the 18th century, including William Wordsworth who wrote about “the torrent at the Devil’s Bridge”. Today the Falls Nature Trail provides a great opportunity to see this impressive natural feature in the Rheidol Gorge. And you can arrive in style by taking the Vale of Rheidol Steam Railway from Aberystwyth to the very place itself.\n\nThere are actually three bridges at Devil’s Bridge, more or less built in a stack. It is thought that the first or lowest of the three bridges was built by the monks of Strata Florida to shave a few minutes off the journey time to their abbey in Pontrhyfendigaid.\n\nBut there is another theory.\n\nAround the time of the 11th century, the Devil visited Wales as he had never been there before and had heard that the scenery was breath-taking. He came across an old lady who seemed upset. “What’s the matter?” he asked but only out of curiosity because obviously he was not known to be nice to old ladies.\n\n“Oh, I’m in such a terrible muddle and I don’t know what to do!” she replied. “My cow has wandered across the river and I can’t get her back.”\n\n“Ah!” said the Devil, “What you need, My Dear, is a bridge and I am just the man to build you one! Why don’t you go home and in the morning there will be a bridge waiting for you. All I ask in return is to keep the first living thing to cross the bridge!”\n\n“Okay then,” she said. “It’s a bargain. I’ll see you in the morning. Nos da (goodnight).” That night she wondered about this stranger who would build her a bridge. “What a strange request! Why should I cross the bridge to get my cow back if he gets to keep me in exchange? Mind you, I won't say it's not a tempting offer.”\n\nThe next day she got up and called for her faithful dog. Together they went down to the river. She could not believe her eyes. In front of her was the best bridge that she had ever seen!\n\n“I told you I would build you a bridge,” said the Devil, appearing from nowhere. “Now it’s your turn to keep your side of the bargain.”\n\nShe replied: “I know, you get to keep the first living thing to cross the bridge.” She started to walk towards the bridge. But just when she got to the start of it, she stopped, took out a loaf of bread from her apron pocket and hurled it across the bridge. As quick as a flash and before the Devil could stop it, the dog chased after it.\n\n“Aaaaaaagh!” screeched the Devil. “You stupid old woman. I don’t believe it! Your smelly, hairy farm dog has become the first living thing to cross my bridge. A dog’s no good to me.” With that, he vanished and was never seen in Wales again as he was so embarrassed at being outwitted by the old lady.\n\nThis all seems entirely plausible until you learn that this legend is very similar to another in Switzerland where the Devil built a bridge so that a lost goat could safely cross the ravine. Maybe it is not true at all and simply a marketing stunt. What is true is that the Devil has not been seen in Wales since but only because he was driven out by the Manic Street Preachers.\n\nAt the western edge of the Cambrian Mountains, just off the A44, is the Bwlch Nant yr Arian Visitor Centre. It is well-known for its long-established tradition of feeding red kites daily.\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the red kite population had crashed to a handful of pairs in southern and mid-Wales, the result of a long history of pointless persecution. In 1989 a re-introduction programme was set up by the RSPB and the Nature Conservancy Council due to concerns about the slow rate of population expansion in Wales, and the improbability of natural re-colonisation of other suitable parts of the UK by red kites from Wales or the continent. Red kites were re-introduced to four areas in England: the Chilterns, the East Midlands, Yorkshire and the North-east. And in 1999, Bwlch Nant yr Arian became a red kite feeding station as part of a programme to protect the small number of red kites in the area at that time.\n\nSince then the red kite has become an unparalleled conservation success story. Fast forward to 2022 and the bird is a familiar site in many parts of Britain, including nearly all Wales. At Orchid Meadows, we see red kites most days.\n\nAt Bwlch Nant yr Arian daily feeding nevertheless continues at 3pm during the summer months and 2pm in winter. As many as 150 come in to feed from a radius of 10 miles. Here you can also find a range of waymarked trails for walkers, mountain bikers and runners.\n\nAlso not far from Orchid Meadows is the Llyn Eiddwen Nature Reserve near Bronnant. A natural upland lake, it is surrounded by moorland and mire and managed by the South and West Wales Wildlife Trust. It is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\n\nThe reserve is known for its flora with the lake supporting abundant stands of water lobelia with carpets of shoreweed, spring quillwort and awlwort, here at one of its southernmost locations in the UK. At the southern end, there are extensive beds of bottle sedge and water horsetail which grade into bog vegetation dominated by cotton grass and Sphagnum moss.\n\nThe lake is important locally for wintering wildfowl, including coot, mallard, pochard, teal, and wigeon together with whooper swans. Water voles inhabit the shoreline, beyond which are brown trout, pike, minnow and three-spined stickleback.\n\nThe surrounding area of upland heathland and acidic grassland is typical of this part of mid-Wales and includes mat grass, bilberry, heath bedstraw, sheep’s fescue, tormentil and heather. North of the lake is small mire with a good cover of bog mosses with cotton grass, bog asphodel, cranberry and round-leaved sundew.\n\nThe smaller Llyn Fanod nearby is a sister upland lake and also a nature reserve. A range of aquatic plants occur, including water lobelia, quillwort, shoreweed and awlwort. In high summer there is a spectacular display of white water lily and yellow water lily and the lake is particularly good for dragonflies, damselflies and caddis flies."
