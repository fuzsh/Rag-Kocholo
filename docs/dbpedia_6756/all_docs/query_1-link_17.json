Probably built on older Celtic foundations the church has undergone restoration during the Victorian period and also in the early 20th century when the monks added the unique stained glass windows which were designed by Dom Theodore Bailey who was one of the Benedictine monks living on the island at that time.\n\nWebsite:-\n\nhttp://www.caldey-island.co.uk/"
