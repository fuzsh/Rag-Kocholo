There seems to be tittle or no doubt of some severe actions having been fought between the Turks and Russians, in which the Russians suffered considerable loss. Tt is said that, the Russian corps, which had wintered at Hirsova, Russuva, and Cztrnivada, received orders to advance to Silistria to support the operations from Kalarasch. The Turks, from Silistria, sttneked this corps and foiced it to r£ treat. with coii- mdi'table loss. It then joined the main army, which broke up from C'zcrnivada on the 13th of last month. The left column had been harassed by the Turks, who fought with great obstinacy in order to execute an operation of the greatest importance to the Garri- son of Silistria- the introduction of 1,500 head of cattle into the fortress. In this operation they suc- ceeded completely. The loss of the Russians in the action of the 17th May, is said to have amounted to 3,000 killed and wounded, amongst, whom there were many officers. The Siege of Silistria is likely to <> ecupy the Russians a considerable time. On the 8th ult. the garrisons of Rudschuk and GiUrgevo attacked the Russians before those places, nnd a very severe engagement took place, without any decisive Success on either side.— One hundred waggons of w ounded Russians were scut to Bucharest. A Russian corps which had crossed the Danube near Hirsova, was attacked and defeated by the Turks ; 2,600 wounded Russians were sent to B ailow and Gallacz. Some serious events have also taken place on the shores of the Black Sea, but all persons coming' from that quarter are strictly prohibited from speaking upon military or political events. tt is supposed that the Russian General will leave about 25,000 men before Silistrin, and advance with 50,000 uien into Servia, which has not as yet felt the miseries of war. This movement is described to be necessary, the Principalities and Bessarabia having been totally exhausted. The first grand operation Will, however, in all probability, be the siege of Silistria. It . seems quite clear, that the Principalities and Bessarabia are utterly unable to furnish supplies. All the villages on the Danube have been deserted by the inhabitants, and sickness is making great ravages. So quick and extensile arc they, tliat the inhabitants believe it to be the plague.' The Paris Papers, quoting au article from a Nuremberg Paper of the 26th ult. state that Varna has been retaken by the Russians after a horrible carnage, This is doubted ; but it is evident that the Turks are developing an extraordinary degree of energy, and are improving in discipline daily. Many foreign officers arc said to be in their service. commercial distress. He thought, however, that the vessel would have a better chance of success if she were left to' right herself. The system of factory labour, instead of manual labour, had produced great consequences j and he did not think that enough had been attributed to the great improvement in ma- chinery. Few persons also had attributed enough to the importation of labourers from Ireland. A greater number of Irish labourers in the manu- facturing districts were out of femploy than people could imagine; and the magistrates relieved them rather thaft pass them to their parishes, reflecting that as they had contributed to the prosperity of the places, they had a right to relief when in distress. Where flic passage was. so low, and this country possessed the advantage of a legal provision for the poor, it was impossible to check the influx of Irish labourers, and this fact would suggest important improvement in the state of the law. He felt convinced that any alteration with respect to the value of the currency would be attended with the greatest evils to every class, and lie should therefore oppose it.

SHREWSBURY IFILdMBHOTS0 NOTICE TO CREDITORS. HOUSE OF COMMONS— THURSDAY. PETITION FROM BIRMINGHAM. ' Mr. BROUGHAM rose to present a petition from a Very respectable body, to whom he felt grateful for the confidence ihey had reposed in him, after a distinct statement on his part that he by no means agreed either with the prayer or the allegations on which the petition was founded. After this distinct statement of difference of opinion, and after his saying- lie would rather they should put it into the hands of some other person who, from community of opinion, would support the doctrines and prayer of the petition— they were pleased to say that they were willing he should present the petition to the house, and state the subject matter of it. It had been agreed to at a numerous meeting of manufacturers, artizans, and other inhabitants of Birmingham, and was signed by 8000 persons without solicitation. They contended that the distress which now prevailed not only had reference to the poorer classes of society, but spread itself generally over the whole system. This distress the petitioners ascribed to the tampering that had falien place with the currency. Their opinion was, that too much stress was laid upon . the panic which had taken place in 1825; for though it was true that a great number of failures had taken place among the bankers, yet it was no less true, that out of about seventy bankers who had failed, as many as sixty had subsequently paid 2l) s in the pound. If such were the case, he was very glad to hear it. These were some of Ihe principal features of the petition, and though he could not by any means agree with all of them, yet within certain bounds he thought that a great deal of faith might be put in their statements. Tbnt a great deal of the distress of the nation had arisen from the depreciation of the currency, by which people were now paying taxes at a rate tbnt had never been intended when Ihcy were originally imposed, was extremely likely ; but whether it oper- ated to the extent that the petitioners described was another qnestion. ' As to meddling wilh the public debt in ti. e decisive way suggested by the petitioners, such a resort must tend to a general bankruptcy of t he nation ; he could not therefore advise such a step. In rcduciug the salaries of the public functionaries' however, there could be no breach of faith; for ns those salaries had been raised during the depreciation, it was but fair now to restore them to the same, or to something like tire same footing as before He had already said that he could not agree with a great deal of the petition, and he therefore trusted that there would be no attempt to open Ihe question of the currency again. With the latter part of the petition he, however, entirely agreed, and hoped that every tiling would be done to give the people as great relief from the pressure of the taxes as might be consistent with a due regard to the public credit and the service of the state; and so far from treating this remedy lightly, the more he thought that Ihe petitioners were wrong in their observations on the tampering of the currency, the more he was inclined to listen to that part of the petition which appeared lo him to be founded on truth. Mr. Secretary IVEL observed, that whenever any change, however calculated to be ultimately beneficial, was made in the system of the currency, it must be fttt- tided in the first, instance with considerable inconvemencies. Unless government had. permitted things to remain as they were in that respect, ( hey could only adopt one of two courses, either to depreciate the standard, or to make the paper currency payable in gold. It was true that what had been called an equitable adjustment had been talked of; but he had never heard any plan devised, by which those who had become the creditors of the slate when the currency was in a depreciated state should be subjected to a proportionate reduction of their claims now that the currency was metallic. The . question, however, which Ihcy had then to decide was, if it were expedient again to unsettle the currency ? Tlie more he considered the subject, the more was he convinced that the best interests of the nation required that we should strictly adhere to the law of our currency as now established. He hoped he should never see the time when tbe restriction on cash payments should be renewed. When, however, the petitioners declared it to be expedient to increase the amount of the currency by an issue of paper, he would ask them, what they would in that case do with the exchanges? If the exchanges fell, the gold would go out of the country. What could they then do but renew tbe restriction on cash payments by the Bank ? He was quite aware that the immediate effect of an increase of our circulating medium, by an issue of paper, would be to give a stimulus to trade. But the temporary excitement thus created would be followed by a correspondent languor; and all that had been done would be to do again. Persons had contended that over- production could never exist, inasmuch as the W;. sis of mankind were insatiable; but be could by no means acquiesce in such opinion. If he took the imports and exports from the year 1818 to the present time, it would prove that there was a gradual increase of both, and as gradual an increase in the consumption of exciseablc articles. When taxation was reduced, consumption vvas increased, and the revenue often benefitted. How could the Hon. Member reconcile this with the universal stagnation he had described ? He had strong impressions that the distress arose from very different causes to those imagined by him. The transfer of trade from one place to another had very great effect, in creating temporary distress, as was seen in the distresses at SnttrilHelds occasioned by the silk trade being removed to Manchester. It was not any change in the value of the currency, but. the prosperity of Manchester that had occasioned the depression in Spitillielils. Long before the Bank Restriction, in 1797, there had been periods of long stagnation and distress, either from ovcr- excitement, over- production, or from some other causes. But at present there were several causes combined to account for the stagnation. There had been an over- production of several articles;* the bad harvest had a combined effect; the American tariff was another cause; the war in the Levant, the civil dissensions in South Americ?, and the state of Portu- gal bad also concuned to cause stagnation and The Prussian State Gazette of the 1st install^ received this day, states that a part of the Russian force now besieging Silistria, attacked a division of 5000 Turks near that city, on the 17th ult. defeated them with great loss, and compelled them to retire within the main fortress. This contradicts the Turkish account given in a preceding column. Hamburgh Papers bring accounts from Silistria to the 23d of May.— These accounts assert that the Russians were attacked by the Grand Viz'ier' himself with a great force, on tlie 17th ult. and that the Russians acknowledge a loss of nearly 1000 killed and wounded. The Great Seal is immediately to pass into new hands. Whether voluntarily or otherwise, Lord Lyndhurst MUST retire forthwith. At present it would be improper to say more, and it is unnecessary, for even before the session closes all the circumstances connccted with the intended and inevitable change in the Court of Chancery will doubtless be made public. — Mr. Peel will retire also, but perhaps not so soon. — Standard. Lord Tlturlow died at his house, Regency- square, Brighton, on Wednesday last. His lordship was in lii. s 48th year. The late Lord Thurlow, whose death we announce with sincere regret, held the offices of Clerk of the Hanaper, Patentee for making out Commissions of Bankruptcies, and Clerk of the Custodies of Lunatics and Idiots,— the whole yielding an aggregate of we believe nearly ten thousand pounds per annum, besides very extensive patronage. These are all offices in the gift of the Lord Chancellor; and in the present crisis it is an object of curiosity to ascertain how they are to be disposed of. Will they be regulated according to the arrangement recommended by several successive finance committees ; that is to say, by carrying all the fees to the consolidated fund, merely reserving their present salaries to the deputies who discharge the duties of the respective offices ? or supposing that even in these days of retrenchment and economy the offices m question shall be thought things too good to sacrifice, will Lord Lyndhurst under present circumstances be permitted to dispose of them? We shall see in a day or two. Lord Thurlow's death will probably accelerate the dis- closures and events to which we alluded on Saturday. Standard. CAMBRIDGE, June 5.— The approaching election for this University, in consequence of the elevation of SirN. C. Tindal to the Bench, occasions the highest degree of excitement. Mr. George Bankes arrived here on Friday last, and offered himself ffs a can- didate for the representation of the University. On the same day Mr. Aldcrson, Caius College, issued a circular from the Temple, soliciting the votes of the members of the senate. This gentleman has now withdrawn, in consequence of the invitation given to and accepted by Mr. Cavendish, of Trinity College. Mr. Bankes and Mr. Cavendish have each commenced an active canvass ; their committees are in full operation, both in the university and in the metropolis, and nn arduous contest is expected. The election it is thought will take placc on Tlnysday next, bat the writ not having yet arrived, the day cannot be at present fixed.— An unexpected vacancy has also occurred in the representation of the borough hy the appointment of Colonel Trench to an office in the Ordnance Department The Colonel arrived at Cambridge on Monday to solicit, the suffrages of his late constituents, nnd Mr. S. Wells has declared himself a candidate. The election will take place on Tuesday. Tuesday, the 16th, is the day fixed for the Election for the University of Cambridge.

On Wednesday, the 3d inst. as William Mason was fly- iishing near Eyton, where the bank above the river Severn slopes down to it at. an angle of about 60 degrees, and is of a considerable height, a partridge which was probably sitting in some Gorse on the side of the bank, flew out and was caught by the line lapping round its neck, and was actually brought to hand. INQUEST.— On Monday last, an inquisition was taken at Montford Bridge, near this town, before George Wingfield, Gent. Coroner, and a respectable Jury, on view of the body of Hannah Corbett; and it appeared that the deceased, who was a very old and infirm person, and very deaf, was walking on that part of llie turnpike road called tbe Grange Bank, on Saturday last, when a horse the property of Mr. Richard Vaughan, of Mytton, with a cart at its heels, ran at full speed down the bank, the animal having become restive, and broke away from the care of the driver: the off- side of the cart came in contact with the deceased, and then upset, whereby the deceased was so severely bruised and otherwise injured, as to cause her death next day: it further appeared that Mrs. Vaugban and a child w ere thrown from the cart, in consequence of which, fhe tVirnier received some injury, though not of a serious nattire; the body of the cart passed over ' the child, but providentially, indeed almost miraculously, the child escaped unhurt.— The Jury returned a verdict, that the death of Hannah Corbett was accidental, under the circumstances above stated: deodand on the horse and cart 5s. On Saturday, an inquest was held at Quat, near Bridgnorth, before Francis Pierpoint, Gent, coroner, and a respectable jury, on view of the body of a man ( a stranger) found dead in a coppice near Quat, and who appeared to have been dead some days. Ver- dict accordingly. BURGLARY.— In the night of Tuesday, the 2d inst. or early on Wednesday morning last, the dwelling- house of Mrs. Denston, near The Mount, in this town, was broken open and robbed of plate, jewellery, linen, & c. of considerable value; Mrs. Denston being on a visit in the country at that time, and the house unoccupied. By the vigilance of our Police Officers, however, a clue was obtained, which will, we think, eventually bring the robbers under the just punishment of the offended law, two at least of the suspected parties being now in custody, under circumstances that fully warrant the opinion we have expressed, and as to whom we shall probably be enabled to say more in our next publication.— While on this subject, wc think it right to give our readers generally a caution as to strangers of doubtful appearance, who may visit their respective vicinities. We know that a number of villains, . who had recently been very successful in Worcester and its vicinity, have just been arrested on their route to these parts, where they intended to have laboured, for a time at least, in their unworthy vocation : at present they are in limbo ; but there arc plenty of the same stamp now traversing the country; and the public will do well to pay attention to this caution- Committed to our County Gaol, Thomas Langford, Charles Gough, and Thomas Jebb, charged with stealing a basket containing one yard and a quarter of buff nankeen, three yards of calico, one yard of printed cotton, three yards of ribbon, and various other articles, the property of Martha Lloyd, also a silk handkerchief, a pair of kid gloves, a waist ribbon, nnd other articles, the property of Elizabeth Lloyd ; Itichard Dut ies, charged with stealing a waistcoat, and. a pair of breeches, the property of John Edwards; Ann Powell, charged with having in her possession one silver watch, the property of Thomas Thorpe, knowing the same to have been stolen. 29ioc£ 0i of fftmforH.

ST. MARY'S CHIMES. i - M ' The strains, which from the sacred tower the breeaes bear along So sweetly when the evening falls, or morning's light is young; So simply and so mournfully they wander through the air,, As seeking- lonely, distant dells, to hide their echoes there! Tile same sweet sound that music keeps, unchanged, unhurt, by time, IndiH'ereul to all that is— the quiet— the sublime— . To age when withered on its stem, to maidens in their bloom ; Alike to races yet unborn, or past ones iu the tomb. More dear to me those midnight chimes, with moonlight o'er the scene, Aud Severn's waters rolling by, and heaven— and all serene, Than poet's song, or lover's lay, or music's proudest strain ; These hover lightly round the heart— those euter and remain 1 ffl& TOHilir IBTLBUBAlLUDo SHREWSBURY.

Our supply of Wheat of our own growth continues to arrive sparingly ; still, having an immense arrival of foreign, our Market was very heavy this morning, although there were many country buyers i\\ t market ; but as the factors demanded last Monday's prices, the sales were very few, still that day's prices must be quoted. Malting Barley sold for 33s. per quarter, and the grinding qualities were also very dull sale, and somewhat lower. Beaos and Peas were far from being brisk, but not cheaper.

The Clerks of Bridgnorth Market have been much engaged lately in examining the weights and measures used in that town, and also the weight of butter brought, to market; many seizures have been made and fines levied. In our Fair, yesterday, Fat Sheep averaged 5jil per lb.; strong Store Pigs sold at rather better prices than last Fair, but small ones were lower. Ellcsmere Fair, yesterday, was what farmers gene- rally denominate a very honest one, most of them keeping possession of the stock they had to sell.— What little was disposed of fetched lower prices, with the exception, perhaps, of a few small fat cattlc, suitable to the market, which sold from 5' d. to 5| d. per lb. RI'GFLF. Y GREAT HORSF. FAIR.— This celebrated fair commenced on the 1st instant. There was not the usual supply of horses, nor were the dealers so active in purchasing as on former occasions; not- withstanding which, good hunting- like nags of superior figure sold extremely well.— Many enquiries were made after the Sultan blood ; and black horses of this description with fine Piccadilly action sold for long prices. There is at present a most flattering prospect that this year will prove a \" hit\" both for apples and pears, in the orchards of this county ; and, if so, we suspect casks will scarcely be found in some places, to contain the liquor that will lie made. The east- erly winds which have latterly prevailed, are sup- posed to bring blight; but those whom age and experience qualify to judge the matter, assert other- wise— and when a good barking season, a kind blossom, and an easterly wind, comc together, they say, \" prepare all the casks you can muster, for they will be wanting.\" We have had all llicse this year, and time will shew whether age and observation may not make a hit, that younkers will benefit by attend- ing to.— Hereford Journal. The Great Derby Stakes at Epsom, 50 sovs. each, 89 subscribers, were won by Mr. Gratwicke's Frederick.— The Oaks Stakes, 50 sovs. each, 79 subscribers, were won by the Marquis of Exeter's Green Mantle.— The Surrey and Middlesex Stakes, 25 sovs. each, 13 subscribers, were won by Mr Griffiths's Mosquito, beating 4 others. CURIOUS TEST OF A PREACHER'S TALENTS.— Two friends in the north were a short time sincc disputing anent the comparative talents of their respective ministers. Both at length waxed wondrous hot on the subject, till at last one of them settled the question by exclaiming with all the consciousness of victory in the dispute, at the same time addressing his opponent, \" Your minister, Sir, is a perfect driveller— a down- right squeaker. When he speaks of a certain gentleman, the monarch of the nether world, he calls him in a weak tremulous voice, as if afraid to pronounce his name, ' the Deevil,' but our minister calls him ' the Devil,' at once, and more than that, Sir, he does not care a d— n for him.\"— Elgin Courier.

We speak this advisedly and npon delibera- tion ; and maugre the boastings of tlw braggadocio himself, and the puffings of his partizans, we repeat it, that he has not the most remote chance of being elected. Out of three thousand notices served on the Clerk of the Peace, two thousand at the least were forgeries, and of the remaining, not above two hun- dred and fifty will be qualified to vote Up to Thursday evening, being the second day, there were only sixty- three voters registered for the county, and only ninety- one presented themselves out of all those who had served notices. The attempt at manufacturing Freeholders is now found to be impossible. REGISTRATION OF FREEHOLDS. On Wednesday, tbe Assistant Barrister attended at the County Court House, Kilkenny, for the registry of freeholds. There were sixty- four applicants, out of which number only seventeen were registered up to Friday evening. In the county of Leitrim, only five ten- pound free- holders were registered on the first day, out. of fifty, whose names were called. In Cavan, thirty- eight were allowed out of fifty.. In Waterford, nineteen, principally tenants of the Marquess of Waterford, registered under the Act. Thus the day on which the Bill for the pacification of Ireland became law, is just the period from which the future historian will date her misery, agitation, and dissension. The Papists have discovered that the Elective Franchise, as at present constituted, will throw the whole of the Representation of Ireland into the hands of the Lords of the Soil and the Clergy of fhe Established Church ; that it will, in fact, make property the criterion of opinion ; and that as the Roman Catholics possess only a small portion of the propertjfoof Ireland, scarcely one of that persuasion can be returned to Parliament. This is a plain and simple statement of the facts; and the Morning Register and Evenivg Post are quite beside them- selves at the prospect. They thus express themselves. From ihe Morning Register. THE REGISTRIES.— As far as we can at present learn, authority carries a high hand indeed relative to registries. We have heard of 23 names entered for one county, and 15 for another ! We have heard of a Parish Priest whose claim Was rejected, though he held a house at £ 25 a year, which could be set at any time at twice that sum. He swore he had an interest, of £ 10 a year in the premises, and also swore that he derived in mere lodging money out of them, in one year, £ 60. He was, however, pronounced by the Assistant Barrister, to be incompetent to vote under the new Act, but that officer did not so pro- nounce until he had the insolence to call upon ttfe Priest to substantiate his allegations by a second oath! This, probably, is all for the better ! The more justice and decency are outraged in this way, the more im- perative it vvill be upon Ireland to insist upon the repeal of the abominable law which placed the con- stituency of Ireland in the power of the Assistant. Barristers. From the Evening Post. IMPORTANT.— REGISTRY OF FREEHOLDERS.— Out of 165 notices to register freeholds, in the county of Dublin, of ten- pound yearly value, but 23 were passed by the Barrister! Many, it is true, who gave notice did not appear — but these were in general supposed to have felt that they were not properly qualified. We apprehend that a new source of agitation has been opened by the Freehold Bill. The Constituencey of Ireland will probably be found to have been vesled in 32 Officers of the Crown, removable at pleasure. In such case it is unnecessary to say that the agitation will prove as universal as the dissatisfaction. Aggregate Meeting of the Roman Catholic Association. [ FROM THE STANDARD.] There was an aggregate meeting in Dublin, On Wednesday last, for the purpose of voting £ 5,000 to Mr. O'Connell, for his expenses at the approaching Clare election. It is perfectly unnecessary to say that the money was voted with the utmost liberality. This is altogether correct, but we notice the meeting only for the purpose of showing how far the measure of emancipation has conciliated the Irish Roman Catholics, and rendered them grateful to the persons by whose means it was carried. Mr. O'Connell's forgiveness of his political enenlies. 44 Davy M4Clearv, I assure you, gentlemen, is no lonoer my master. ( A lavgh. J Since my late extra- ordinary growth, I positively am as big, ns tall a man as little Davy. What a comfort to think that I am as tall as little Dai')'. ( A burst of laughter J This late act, too, has given me an elevation so as that I cannot be looked dow n upon by the great nnd wonderful Sir Aby Baby King. Is it not something to have lived to see the day w hen Abv Baby can no longer say that othe constitution lift's given him port and dimensions superior to fnine? ( Loud laughter. J It must be fairly allowed that we are both of us now ou the same \" stool, and that being the case, 1 wi'l allow the illus- trious Baby to abuse me for the remainder of his life ' W nothing— that is without the cost of a reply on mv piirt. (' Lhugh.*<•>.) Placed on one stool, I never shall seek the . bene fit of a reply to the Kind's stationer ; 1 shall he Contented to be allowed the liberty merely of laughing at him. ( Great applause and laughter.)\" II. Romish gratitude to the recreant Irish Protestants who supported their cause. 44 To be placed 011 a footing with such renowned personages as Davy M4Clearv and his brother Bruns- vvicker, Sir Aby Baby, is n greai thing ; but I ow n it bus not half the value of the relief we have got from the patronage of my Lord Kingston and his like. [ tteai, hearMany things annoyed nnd galled me in the struggle, but nothing went so near to setting me out of inv wits as the patronage of the Kingston tribe. Patronage, inequality, aud all have been shaken off.\" This is, we confess, delightful: but for the apostate meanness of the Kingston tribe, and others equally contemptible, the game of Mr O'Connell and Co. would not have succeeded. Now that his object is attained, he is very right in spurning them con- temptuously away. III. Opinion of the Duke of Wellington's conduct to Lord Anglesey. 44 1 own that nothing has filed me icith MORE INRPFABLB DISGUST than the disclosures made iu the eorrcifpondenee between the Duke aud the Noble Marquis. It has lifted a curtain, coucealing what 1 hope we are to consider as the transactions of a former slate of tbe Castle nf Dublin that are truly frightful. Let the Irish people and the English nation only look to the correspondence between Lord Anglesey and the English government. Nothing more is necessary to explain the past, or furnish a hope of the fu"
