        "text": "Special church services, a beach party and other events have been held across Wales to mark the coronation of King Charles III.\n\nThe Church in Wales called it a \"significant and happy\" occasion.\n\nBells at Llandaff Cathedral, Cardiff, and St Davids Cathedral, Pembrokeshire, began ringing ahead of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey.\n\nMeanwhile, a \"Not My King\" protest with about 400 people was staged in Cardiff.\n\nBass-baritone Sir Bryn Terfel gave the first performance in the Welsh language at a coronation.\n\nAlongside the Choir of Westminster Abbey, he performed the Coronation Kyrie, described by Welsh composer, Paul Mealor, as a \"cry from the deep soul of the hills and valleys of Wales\".\n\n\"I will enjoy that one minute of singing in my mother tongue after the procession that arrives into Westminster Abbey - I'm first on,\" Terfel told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast ahead of his performance.\n\n\"In my performance I want to bring something that is beneficial to Wales and I'm really looking to perform.\"\n\nAn outdoor screening of the official ceremony was cancelled outside the Friars Walk shopping centre in Newport due to the weather.\n\nBut organisers of a beach party in Barmouth, Gwynedd, were able to go ahead with a community lunch on the seafront followed by music from DJs.\n\nCardiff is the centre of Wales' Coronation celebrations with 40 events over the Bank Holiday weekend, including a 21-round royal gun salute at Cardiff Castle, which happened at noon, a public screening of the coronation ceremony in London and another of the subsequent concert taking place at Roald Dahl Plass.\n\nBecca, from Bridgend, who has been taking part in the events, said: \"I like the celebrations have come to Cardiff and it's something we can take part in here.\"\n\nBethan Sayed, a former Plaid Cymru Member of the Senedd, who attended the protest, said the \"cost of the Coronation has been astronomical in a cost of living crisis\".\n\n\"We're here on the day of the Coronation raising awareness that we're a new campaign for a Welsh republic,\" she said.\n\n\"We want to talk to people about why a republic would be beneficial.\"\n\nAbout 15 people also took place in a coronation protest outside Caernarfon Castle in Gwynedd, which hosted the investiture of the then Prince of Wales in 1969.\n\nSome people in Cardiff were choosing not to take part in celebrations or the protest, however.\n\nMillie Gee and Sam Harredence, both 19, were simply visiting the shops.\n\n\"We're not too bothered,\" Millie said. \"I've never been too enthusiastic about the royals. I don't really know anyone who is particularly patriotic.\n\n\"I don't see the point,\" Sam added.\n\n\"It's a really old fashioned thing. it just seems really out of touch.\"\n\nWelsh independence and republican stickers have been plastered on a Royal Mail postbox in Cardiff, one of four in the UK repainted to mark the Coronation.\n\nIt had drawn criticism for its location - outside the Owain Glyndwr pub - named after the last native Welsh person to hold the title Prince of Wales.\n\nThe stickers have been removed on at least two occasions.\n\nMeanwhile, Anne Daley, from Cardiff, 65, has been camping in London since Monday to see Coronation events for herself.\n\n\"We've been camping in the park which has been eventful,\" she said.\n\n\"We've seen King Charles go up and down a few times... King Charles was beaming.\"\n\nRachel Walters, 53, from Cardigan, Ceredigion, who has also been camping on the route, said had \"came to the jubilee and the Queen's funeral, so wasn't going to miss this\".\n\nA planned event at Caldicot Castle in Monmouthshire, is no longer happening after it \"failed to raise any money whatsoever\" towards its £3,000 running costs.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon there is a party on the green at Llandaff Cathedral between 13:00 and 19:00, with refreshments, stalls, games, and music from the cathedral's choristers.\n\nThe Bishop of St Asaph will lead a civic Coronation Evensong at St Asaph Cathedral in Denbighshire from 15:30.\n\nA reception with refreshments will follow a choir and orchestra performance of Coronation anthems at Brecon Cathedral, Powys.\n\nThe bells of St Giles Parish Church will ring at 15:00 and Sunday at 11:00, followed by a service and afternoon lunch party.\n\nThere will also be a procession to the church from St Mary's Roman Catholic Cathedral where a service will feature the Rhos Orpheus male choir.\n\nAnd a coronation festival is taking place late into the evening on the promenade at Barmouth with music - but it started with cake stalls.\n\nSt Mary's Priory Church in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, will hold prayers for the new King and Queen and a Festal Evensong starting from 17:00 on Sunday.\n\nBut not everyone will be taking part or even following any of the coronation ceremonies, including republican Owen Williams from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan.\n\n\"We won't be taking any notice of it,\" he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.\n\n\"Instead of a coronation, I'd prefer and election. Instead of Charles, I'd prefer a choice."
