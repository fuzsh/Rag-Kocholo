Now lei us see how this operates, The produce o(' these two branches of the Revenue in the year ending October, IH20, was £ 3f>, 2: i4,* 05. The produce of the year ending October, 1* 25, notwithstanding the loss of the above mentioned 7- 0, OOii, is no' f2^, 474,805, as might have been expected, but £ 35,926,)* 06: so that the foreign trade and h- me consumption of the country must have advanced no less than five and twenty per cent, within the hist five years ; or, in other words, for every four millions we then consumed or ex- ported, we now require five.

Those persons, however, w hose prophecies time is thus rendering increasingly ridiculous, will endeavour, as far as they can venture, to \" hint . a doubt\" yvhether too little, after all, has- not been done If 10 taken from 50 leaves 50 still, the deduction of 20, they will suggest, might have left. 60 The best answer to this is, au appeal to the every- dav practice of commercial men. Manu- facturers and trnders. frequent. ly find that a reduction of prices operates an increase of profits by increas- ing Ihe demand But the'y know that there is a point.' at which this reduction must stop; and so there is a poin' in finance, as it respects' every individual commodity, beyond which reduction could not he carried without a clear loss to the revenue But the excellence of the plans of the Chancellor of the Exchequer consists in this - that each remission is, so calculated to give relief to trade, and facility to commerce, as to draw after it, as a natural consequence, that increase of prosperity which furnishes the means for futuie repeals.— New Times. The early part of his Majesty's administration was splendid in military giory ; the subsequent years have been marked by improvements in all our internal circumstances, and by a more decided patronage of the Fine Arts, the adorning of the capital, and a l the other pursuits which become the peaceful leisure of a nation rich iu internal hap- piness and external glory. These are the days, and these the works, which the prophetic eye of our great poet foresaw — Bid harbours open, public ways extend ; Bid temples w orthier of the God ascend ; Bid the luoad arch the dangerous flood contain ; The mole projected, break the roaring main ; Back to his bounds the subject sea command, And roll obedient rivers through the land ; These honours, peace to happy Britain brings ; These are imperial works and worthy Kings ! POSTSCRIPT. LONDON, Mowing Night, Oct. 17, 1825. ter 111 Port Bowen, being eighty days in ciois- iiig the ice. if « e are thus deprived of the satisfac- tion of announcing to our readers that Captain Parry has at length succeeded in solving the gre;: t problem, for which he and his gallant companions have so often encountered danger and hardships, in their most hideous forms, we are yet enabled to state, that the discovery is most probably within 1 each, that the route lies open to the glorious prize, and tiiat an unfortunate accident alone has, to all appearances, snatched it, on the present occasion, from the grasp of our intrepid countrymen. In the summer of last year, the llecla and Fury were fitted out lor this service, the former under the immediate command ' of Captain Parry, the latter under that of Captain Hoppner. Our readers will re- member, that in the first voyage Captain Carry enteied Lancaster Svound, and, steering nearly due west, winteied at Mel- ville Island, having on the way entered an inlet on the left, in a southerly direction called Prince liegeiit's Inlet, whieh was explored to some distance, and found to terminate in an open sea. In the second voyage Captain Parry was directed to enter Hudson's Bay, at a pass- age farther to the South than Lancaster Sound, where he was unfortunately entan- gled in an ice, and was unable to make anv progress. In the meantime, Captain Franklin had proceeded by land, and reached a peninsula, m which the open sea lay to the northward, at a point bearing siuth- west from the discovery already niaile in Prince Regent's Inlet, from which it could only be distant by a very short run, it was the object of the third voyage to connect those two points, there being scarcely any doubt that the sea lay open to Behring's Strait, troin the position at which Captain Franklin had terminated his discoveries. la the last season, the Expedition for this purpose entered Lancaster Sou. id, and ihen Prince Regent's inlet, aud wintered at Port Bowen, on the left or easterly side, in hit. 73. long-.- 89. Their operations in the present se. ison commenced with the most favourable prospects. The sea lay open to the southward and westward, under a cloudless sky J every indication seemed to point to the happy consummation of their wishes, when llie unfortunate circum- stance occurred to which we have before alluded. The expedition had penetrated a little way only soulh- west of the point at winch the discoveries in the first voyage had terminated. The crews were all in high health and spirits, and thev have returned to their native shores without the loss of a man, except two sailors, oue of whom died o! illness previously contracted, the other having lost his lite by accident. \\\\ e regret the event that has thus, for On Tuesday, ft tittle Saint Sw. illiiiiVChurch, near tlie Close, Winchester, by tlie Rev.

A highly- respectable correspondent has pointed out to our notice one of those iustanVes of per- severing industry in humble life, in which, from a laudable anxiety to better his situation, an indi vidual, unassisted, has already effected what would have been deemed almost impossible, and who, for want of aid, may yet he unable to accomplish the object so diligently sought :—' Thomas Wat kins, who has been a - mason's labourer for the greater part of his life, purchased about an acre of land on the Lea moor Common, the allotment being sold under the Church Stretton, Wistanstow, and Edgton Inclosure Act.

BISHOP OF CHESTER.— In proposing the health of this distinguished Prelate, at a recent civic festival, at Bury, the Eat I of BRISTOL said : Owing to circumstances which have transpired since I bad the honour of addressing you on the occasion of this health being given here, I feel myself imperatively called upon to say a few words respecting that illustrious Prelate and myself it has been, basely attempted, by oue or more of the public prints, to throw obloquy upon the character of the Bishop of Chester, by various surmises and assertions to the effect that he had, in ranking him self with the opponents of the \" Catholic Claims,\" deserted his early professions, and his early friends, when he found by doing so, he could promote his views of aggrandizement. There never,\" said the Earl, in a most animated and impressive tone, THERE NEVER YVAS A MORE FALSE OR UNFOUND ED ASSERTION SUFFERED TO DISGRACE THE PUBLIC PRESS. I can declare, and I no v declare it upon my honour, that at no period of my acquaintance with Dr. Bloomfield had I the slightest idea of the Catholic cause ever finding in him an advocate • so far to the contrary, the open expression of his sen- timents at all times and on all Occasions, with respect to this important subject, left me full reason to know that he yvould be found a most decided as well as a most powerful opponent to granting further privileges to the Catholics.\" MARgETJHERAIxP, SHREWSBURY.

The experience they have gained by these re- peated voyages into the Arctic Seas, can- not but conduce of itself most importantly to the preservation of their lives, and to familiarize them with dancess which might otherwise have appeared insurmountable. 1 What is perhaps most to be regretted in the failure . of Captain Parry's expedition to the Arctic Regions is, that it may derange the plans of Captain Franklin, and tiie overland expedition, which was formed in concert with that of Captain Parry. It appears hy a letter received in Edinburgh from Captain Franklin, dated the 2u of Juae, that lie aud his adventurous comrades were at that time 700 miles in advance of Cumberland House. The party were all well, and in good spirits, which had been height ened by the intelligence that the stores had reached the d'.^) ot at the first wintering station, ' t heir progress had been greatly impeded by the falls on Mackenzie iliver, which are represented as inferior only to those of Niagara. Yesterday Philadelphia Papers were received to tlie 20th ultimo They contain information from Lima to the 19l! i of June. At that time Callao. was holding out, and opinions were very much divided as to the probability of its fall ; some anticipating its surrender in two months, while others maintain- ed, that it was provisioned for a great length of time ; and as to taking. it by force that seemy to be quite out of the question.

Several colliers from the Clee Hills and from Staffordshire have seen his work, and from the appearances they have ub doubt there is coal, at no very great distance. As the discovery and procuring of coal ou this spot would be a circum stance of great advantage to the adjacent pro. pert ies, and as poor Wat kins, if unassisted, may be compelled to relinquish his voluntary task, our Correspondent is of opinion that our giving the circumstances publicity may ; have the effect of obtaining for Watkins thai aid in his undertaking which can alone bring it to the wished for ter- mination. SINGULAR DOMESTICATION OF A THRUSH. [ Fiom a Correspondent.]—- In the Spring of 1824, a thrush, which had domesticated itself in a surprising degree, constructed a nest ( while hatch- ing her brood) in the cavity of a glass bottle, put in the usual manner in a bottle rack nearly ad- joining the back door of Mr. A. Thompson's dwelling house, at Uptoh Magna, in this county. The same bird has late I y ( May, 18,2 5,) i; e t u r n ed to the former residence, has pot it into Complete order, and appears more familiarised'] to the haunts of men\" than' on her first visit; she feeds out of the hand of an acquaintance, and suffers ( without any apparent offence) an egg or two to be taken from her nest. At Leicester Fair, on Monday, the 10th inst. a large quantity of sheep were penned,, and they went off at good prices. Fat beef sold briskly, and store beasts went off fully up to late vaiiie.' On Tuesday, the Cheese Fair was well attended and supplied, and little remained unsold at the close. The great bulk of the best cheese was bought at 73s. to 75s per ewt. j only a few select dairies reached a higher price. WAXES. MARRIED. On the lst inst. Mr. liees Jones, of Tregaron to Eliza, fourth daughter of the late. Thomas Jones Esq. of Llanio, Cardiganshire. SHREWSBURY. WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1825. Just previous to our Paper going to press last week, Mr. MORELAKl), of the Theatre, came to our office and wrote a paragraph advertisement for insertion, an. nouncing his Benetit Yor Friday liigiit last; and in which paragraph tlie name of a noble and' gallant General was mentioned. Not suspecting that a person filling the office of Stage Manager in a respectable Theatrical Company would dare to make use of the name of an individual of rank without authority, we inserted the paragraph as written by Mr. MonEtANl). We have to regret that our reliance on Mr. M. was so inlich misplaced, as we have the most unquestionable authority for stating, that the noble and gallant personage alluded to was perfectly unaware of tile use to which bis name was applied, until our Journal reached his mansion on Wednesday. - Mr. MOHEI. AN1), perhaps, may pride himself on the success of his manoeuvre as it relates to the proceeds of his Benefit; but we can assure him that such disgraceful practices must tend to degrade bis profession in public estimation, and consequently to injure those members of the Company who have yet to solicit tb. public favour.

Ann the wife of Richard Blair, Esq. aged 34, died in March last, near Halifax, in Nova Scotia, win she was then buried. Her husband had the body exhumed, and arrived with it at Brecknock, the place of the deceased's nativity, on the eve of the second funeral. The reason assigned for this ex traordinary transaction, is the fulfilment of a promise made by Mr. Blair to his wife in her last illness, to bury her at Brecknock. We under- stand Mr. Biair is a native of Dudley or its neigh bourhood. The singularity of the occurrence at- tracted a most numerous assemblage of persons to witness the solemn ceremony, and all seemed deeply affected by the scene. MELANCHOLY SHIPWRFCK.— The brig Ac- tive, of Whitehaven, Johnson, master, from Quebec, laden with timber for Cardigan, being at anchor in that Bay during the violent gale of Friday ae'nnight, was obliged lo cut her cables, and run on shore at low yvater. In a few minutes her bottom went out, and the decks giving way, the Captain and two seamen were unfortunately drowned. Those on board, consisting of Mrs. Johnson, and nine seamen, remained on the wreck, poor Mrs. Johnson being lashed in the foretop. Several boats came to their assistance, the crews of which at the most imminent peril of their lives, and with persevering courage, contended yvith the tremendous element for Upwards of three hours, when they succeeded in rescuing the whole from a watery grave. The vessel in a few minutes became a complete wreck; but the greatest part of the cargo and materials are saved. It reflects great credit on the inhabitants that every article which came on shore has been delivered to the owners. CALAMITOUS SHIPWRECKS.—-- Last week, about 25 trading vessels bound to the westward, were detained for several days in Fishguard Roads, by contrary winds. On the night of Thursday, the weather being more favourable, they all set sail towards St, David's, when a most tremendous gale arose from the North west, & nearly the yvhole were driven| ashore. The following are the particulars of the loss as far as we have been able to ascertain ; Horatio schooner, Maccarty master, with eight men on board, laden with sheep ami pigs, from Kiiisalc, Ireland s the crew excepting one man were saved by letting down ropes from the top of the rocks, a depth of 120 feet ; the vessel went to pieces shortly after.— The Blessing, from Pwllheli totally lust; crew perished. Linnett, of Aberyi with, on shore at Abermawr, crew saved.— Jane, Evans, fi • om Port Madock, hound to Car. 1111, with slates, on shore at Abcrbach; crew saved Brothers, of Mllford, Richards, from Meinel In Haverfordwest, wrecked al Abermawr, crew saved The B.' tsey, H. liibes, of Aberyslwilh, got safe to Aherca^ tle— Two others returned to tile Roads, and three are reported to have reached Milford in safely The Bee, of Aberystwyth, was lost to Ihe vvesl ward of Trigwiot, vvitli all her crew, in a heavy gale, on Thursday last. AI our Sheep and Pig Fair, on TBesday, there was a good supply, and there being plenty ol buyers, prices looked up. Prime fal wethe.- s sold from 7ii. to 7 ;< l ami other sorts in pro- portion. Fat pigs 6 § d. ; stores ralher better than last fair.— On Wednesday, there was a good supply of Cattle, anil plenty of buyers: prime fat beasts averaged 6} l. others 6,1. Stores fetched good prices, There was a very large supply of But er, ami good lols fetched from Is. to 12jil per lb. A l.- w prime dairies of Cheese fetched 72s^ percwi.; much of the belter soi l of Cheese went at from 60s. to 68s. per cwt. and inferior in proportion. ISacon 9d. to 9| d. per lb. Hams 11( 1. to Is.— Oil the whole, more business was transacted at ibis Fair than has been remembered for a long series of years. Hops. — The prices at Chester Fair, last week, were as follow -.— New Hops £ 18. 18s. to £ 21. 0s. 1824 £ 15. 15s. lo £ 17. 17s 1822 £ 10. 0s. to £ 2. 12s Old Olds £ 6. Os. to £ 10. 0s. WEYHII. L FAIR.— This Fair opened early on Monday morning, ihe 10th inst.: business com- mencing wilh Ihe lUlu of day. The number of sheep penned exceeded 150,1 00! Down ewes fetched from 27^. lo 44s.; some lols of a very superior breed as high as 47s. Down lambs 16s. to 33s. ; some as high as 36s. Wethers from 27s. to 46s, some- fat ones 50s. Horse Fair.— The shew of horses was remarkably good, as regards strong cart colts, and the prices immoderately high. There was a fine shew of excellent riding horses; the string of hunting horses, not so numerous as in some former years, but such as were of the first rate and price. There was also a fine shew of Flanders mares ; the. v are remarkable for size and colour, and with crests like the English stallion, Ho/ is— The Hop Fair did not commence till Wednesday ; the number of pockets of New Hops grounded this year was about 1500 ; and about 301) nickels of Old Hops, from various dales to 1819. Vlany packets are grounded from Worcester, Here- fordshire, and Kent. Ou Wednesday evening, however, not a Hop was sold ! The price asked for country Hops was £ 28 per cwt. while Furnhain Hops were otiering at £ 31. 10s. per cwt. * Cheese.— The quantity of cheese grounded this year is comparatively small, and the sale at first was far from brisk ; and the prices were as under : two years old Somerset, finest Sis. ; one year ditto, 68s. to 76s.; North Wiltshire, 6 > s to 70sl— a prime lot or two realizing a few shillings a cwt. more; Skim 30s. to 45s. The price of Iron has suffered the depression which all conversant yvilh the state of the trade anticipated. In Staffordshire the fall has been £ 1. 10s. per ton last quarter day, and £ 2 per ton shortly before, making iu all a reduction of £ 35 per cent. The consequence of this reduction of price has been au attempt pretty generally to reduce the workmen's wages, which have been of late unusually high even when viewed relatively to the advanced price of the commodity produced. Many have closed their works with this intention, and the attempt, which has only one object in view, will have the additional effect of bettering the market by preventing any thing like a glut, and perhaps may even give a favourable turn lo prices. Boscow, a butcher, and Mucgee, an Irish stone- mason, from Liverpool, fought a severe- battle ou Tuesday, at a place called Ihe Lache Eyes, near Chester, for a purse ot' 100 sovereigns Macgee was beaten, after a severe fight of 39 rounds. AA immense multitude witnessed the fight.
