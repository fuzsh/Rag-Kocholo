        "meta_description": "The St Davidâ€™s Church situated in Barmouth, Gwynned is an active Welsh church. The church was consecrated in 1824 and had influences of late English style of architecture. The site previously had a ship building yard and much opposition surfaced when the decision of erecting a church in the area was taken, as the site was deemed to be highly inaccessible. The church saw many renovation works down the ages, especially the completely new wooden floor and the restructured north-east corner. As of 1974, the church also housed a few oil paintings by Rapahel, all of which are now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum of London. The church holds bi-lingual services at present.",
