        "text": "In the Domesday Book, Preston Gubbals being the Parish which included Bomere Heath is described as:-\n\n“Now a parish, the name Gubbals is from the 1066 holder Godbold. It was in Baschurch Hundred (2) in 1086, later in Pimhill, where the Abbot of Lileshull holds 4 hides in Preston Gubald belonging to the Church of St Alkmund in RH ii p. 75a; see Pimhill Roll p. 119, FA iv p. 231 and Eyton x p. 171. Lea [GR SJ 4921] was a member, as was an unidentified ‘Charlton’, not the same as 3g,9: see Ch. 3g note. 4 HIDES.... In the MS a gap suitable for about 5 letters has been left after hide; see 1,5 note.”\n\nMerrington nearby also appears in the Domesday Book and is described as follows:-\n\n“DB Gellidone. Later forms of the name are Guidone, Murydon and Muridone, see VCH I p. 336 note 89 and DEPN s.n. It is now in Preston Gubbals parish and lay in Baschurch Hundred (2) in 1086, later in Pimhill. Picot de Sai gave two-thirds of the demesne tithes to Shrewsbury Abbey (Salop. Cart. pp. 7-8, 43, 45, 276-279 etc.) and the manor itself was later given to Haughmond Abbey: in the Pimhill Roll (p. 121) the Abbot of Haughmond holds Meryden in free alms by gift of Robert Girreis; see TE p. 260b and Eyton x p. 154.”\n\nBoth above paragraphs are English translations of the original and are taken from Domesday Book - Shropshire published by Phillimore 1986 ISBN 0 85033 586 8\n\nsee also The National Archives - Domesday or The Domesday Book Online\n\nWhilst the following was written about the village of Whittington in North Shropshire I feel sure it applies equally to Bomere Heath.\n\n“This neighbourhood was alarm’d with the shock of an Earthquake. Abt. 10 at night a rumbling noise much like a mighty wind was heard, at the same time all was calm. This was followed by 2 tremulous motions succeeding each other instantaneously. The doors and windows of the houses in this village chatter’d the beds were observed to tremble, the chairs rocked under some that sat in them, and a man walking in the fields between Berghill and Francton totter’d so that he could scarce keep his legs. Providentially no damage ensued. The shock was felt in Shrewsbury, Wem, Ellesmere, Halston, here and in a slighter degree in Oswestry.”\n\n[Source: Jottings by W. Roberts, Rector of Whittington in the parish register and reproduced in the Shropshire Family History Journal June 2011.]\n\nA drizzling rain wch fell partly in Icicles and froze as it fell. Many accidents happen’d from the slippery surface of the paths wch were perfectly glazed. Travellers cloathes instead of being wet, were so stiffly congealed about them that it was with difficulty that they were got off. The wings of small birds were so frozen that they fell to the ground. Many were picked up and others died frozen to the ground. The next day a gentle thaw began to discover the face of the earth wch had been hid for so long a time.\n\n[Source: Jottings by W. Roberts, Rector of Whittington in the parish register and reproduced in the Shropshire Family History Journal June 2011.]\n\nThe local roads, 1863-1893.\n\n('Highway Districts ' were virtually imposed on the county under an Act described by some people as 'a Gentleman's Act ' for 'the upper ten thousand') but the surveyor of the Pimhill Highway District Board for 32 years was the much respected James Truman Howell. He died on 23rd January 1895, two days before the dissolution of his Board, after serving diligently for the greater part of his life, since the Board’s creation in l863. Those present at his funeral included the Vice Chairman, Mr A. Mansell, Mr Davies of Yeaton, waywarden, Mr Davies of Little Ness, ex-waywarden, and many others for the whole area.

E.V. Pigott F.M.S., was officially inspected on the 30th ult. by Mr Marriott, the assistant secretary, who was accompanied by Mr Graves, the president, and found to be in a satisfactory condition. The observations include the reading of the barometer, dry and wet bulb thermometers, with the highest and lowest temperature in the shade, the highest in the sun’s rays and the lowest on the grass, as well as the rainfall, direction and force of the wind, the amount of cloud etc. They are made twice daily, viz. 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., and copies are forwarded on monthly forms to the Meteorological Society for publication in its quarterly journal. Weekly returns are also furnished, giving the highest and lowest temperature in the shade, rainfall and weather, for incorporation with other returns from the various grazing and wheat-producing districts of the county, which are published on Thursdays for agricultural purposes.\n\n(Source: The Baschurch File by N. Rowley 1994 p14. ISBN 0 9503979 4 6)\n\nTale of a stolen duck.\n\nAt the Albrighton Petty Sessions on Thursday before G.M. Campbell and T.S. Eyton Esq., Richard Evans and William Evans were charged with stealing a duck, the property of John Bromley, at Leaton on 7th August. Emma Bromley deposed to missing a duck, and identified a duck produced as that which she lost. The prisoners were working for her brother at the time, William as an indoor servant. Police Constable Samuel Taylor said he received information of the loss of the duck and went to the house of the elder prisoner at Bomere Heath. Upon asking for the duck, the prisoner's daughter brought a duck downstairs and gave it to him. He then went to Mr Bromley's farm and apprehended both prisoners, charging them with stealing the duck.\n\nWilliam Evans said he threw a stone at the duck and struck it, and Richard Evans struck it with a knife on the head and took it home. They did not intend to steal the duck. This statement was repeated and he said the duck had got into an oat stack, and in throwing stones to drive them (sic) out William Evans accidentally struck the duck, while the other prisoner took it home with the intention of concealing, not stealing it.\n\nThe elder prisoner said he had belonged to the Foresters Society for 23 years, and if he should be convicted of felony he would be turned out of the society and lose the benefit of his subscriptions. He said he would pay any amount of damages the magistrates might order. William Evans said he also belonged to the Order of Foresters and should forfeit the membership if sent to gaol. The magistrates ordered them to pay the value of the duck and costs of 12 shillings and tenpence each. Mr Campbell had great misgivings whether they were acting rightly in not sending them to gaol.\n\n(Source: The Baschurch File by N. Rowley 1994 p17. ISBN 0 9503979 4 6)\n\nChapel anniversaries at Bomere Heath\n\nOn Good Friday the annual tea in connection with the Zion Hill chapel was held. The chapel, which had been refurbished for the occasion by Mr Payne of Prescott, looked very neat and quite surpassed any other chapel in the neighbourhood for comfort and accommodation. It was filled three times. The ladies who presided at the tables were mostly from the Davies and Evans families. After the tables had been cleared, a service of songs entitled ‘Bunyan’s Holy War’ was rendered by the choir. Mr W.F. Davies referred to the need to clear the chapel of debt. Subscriptions would be gladly received by Mr E. Davies, butcher, of Bomere Heath.\n\nThe anniversary of the Wesleyan chapel was held in May, and a selection of hymns from Moody and Sankey’s edition was sung by the scholars, the service being conducted by Mr Emberton of Liverpool.\n\n(Source: The Baschurch File by N.
