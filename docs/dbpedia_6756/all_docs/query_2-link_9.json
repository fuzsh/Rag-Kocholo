        "text": "Frederick Gibberd was born in Coventry in 1908, where his father ran a gentlemenâ€™s outfitters business. Having no wish to follow into the family firm he decided that he wanted to be an architect and after he finished his schooling he was articled to a local practice. However, he soon realised that he needed a broader education and enrolled himself full-time at the Birmingham School of Architecture, then part of the College of Art.\n\nUpon completion of studies Gibberd moved to London and took up work in the offices of E Berry Webber, a well-known architect who had considerable success in the interwar years in the design of municipal buildings in a Modernist/neo-classical or Art Deco style. Gibberd worked on the Southampton Civic Centre commission during his time at the practice, until he was laid off in the recession of the early 1930s. Rather than seek work in another office he decided to go into business on his own account.\n\nAt this time he became involved in the Modern Architectural Research Group, one of a number of initiatives which hoped to promote Modernism in Britain, but undoubtedly the most successful as it was able to capitalise on the influx of designers and architects who were leaving Nazi Germany and coming to work in London. As an enthusiastic Modernist, the principles adopted by MARS would have a profound effect on his early career."
