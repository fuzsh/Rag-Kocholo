This obviously increased the status and as with all pilgrimage sites would bring in much needed income and by 1131 the new cathedral was completed and consecrated by Bishop Bernard.\n\nThe building was plagued by problems with the collapse of the new tower in 1220 and earthquake damage several years later. Over the years various bishops have added to the building, making it ever more impressive, but with the dissolution of the monarchy under Cromwell the Cathedral was attacked by his troops and all most totally destroyed.\n\nIt would be around 150 years before work would start on the reconstruction of the west front and with other work being undertaken over the years.\n\nClick on the town name below to visit other areas of Wales or Here for Map Aberaeron Aberdovey Abergavenny Aberystwyth Amlwch Bala Barmouth Beaumaris Beddgelert Betws-y-Coed Brecon Builth Wells Caernarfon Caldey Island Cardiff Cardigan Carmarthen Chepstow Chirk Colwyn Bay Conwy Crickhowell Denbigh Fishguard Flintshire Harlech Haverfordwest Holyhead Llanberis Llandrindod Llandudno Llangollen Machynlleth Newport Newtown Porthcawl Porthmadog Pwllheli Rhayader Rhyl Ruabon Ruthin Saundersfoot St Asaph St Davids Swansea Tenby Welshpool Wrexham Photos Old Photos Chester Oswestry"
