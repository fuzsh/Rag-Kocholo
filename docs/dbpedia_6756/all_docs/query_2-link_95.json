The church was completed in 1836, and the first sermon was preached by Archdeacon John Strachan on May 22. Mahlon Burwell deeded the property (five acres in lot 12, concession 1) to the Diocese on Feb. 18, 1840. A cemetery was also established, with the earliest date on a stone being 1839, although earlier burials were believed to have taken place. Trinity church is the oldest surviving building in Port Burwell. Services in the church were irregular after its opening in 1836, being conducted by visiting ministers. The rectory stood empty until 1842 until the arrival of Rev. Thomas Boulton Read, the first resident rector. There was still much work to be done on the church, including plastering the interior, building a gallery and adding rented pews. Even by 1848, the outside was not painted and was only half filled with pews. By the turn of the century, the church was beginning to show signs of its age, so in 1909 extensive repair and renovation took place. New pews and windows were installed, the plastering repaired and the roof was shingled. In 1967, the church was selected for designation as an historic site by the government and a plaque was unveiled on July 21. The church building received substantial damage during a blizzard on January 26, 1978. The main damage done to the church was to the spire which had to be repaired and replaced by a crane.\n\nFurther history: -“Trinity Church, Port Burwell, 1836-1936, Celebrating Its Centenary”\n\n(Elgin OGS has a copy)\n\n“Memories – A History of Port Burwell”, by Frank Prothero, 1986\n\nMinisters:\n\nRev.

It was situated on the north side of the Plank Road (Highway 19), on the east bank of the creek. It was reported to the Diocese in 1837 that the congregations at Port Burwell and Vienna were sufficient to occupy the time and attention of a rector. The congregation was officially formed in 1844 and a church was built in 1845 which was destroyed by fire in 1860. Services were held in the Town Hall until the brick church on Main Street was erected in 1860. St. Luke’s Cemetery is located at Lot 16, Concession 3, north of the village of Vienna on Highway 19 (Plank Road). Because of declining attendance, meetings were held in the fall of 2005 to discuss the future of the church (Aylmer Express, 13 July 2005). No decision as to the closing of the church was available at the time this publication was compiled.\n\nMinisters: see Trinity Anglican Church, Port Burwell\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Baptist\n\nName of Church: Estherville Baptist Church (also known as Old Port Burwell Baptist and First Baptist Church) later Port Burwell Baptist church (Wellington St., Port Burwell)\n\nLocation: Lot 12, Concession 2 (near intersection of Con 1 and Highway 19)\n\nDate of Formation: 1819\n\nDate of Closing: 1865 (rebuilt in Port Burwell)\n\nAffiliations: Bayham\n\nMalahide – Jubliee Lakeview 1842\n\nYarmouth\n\nRecords: The Canadian Baptist Archives lists the following records in their collection for First Baptist Church, more recently Port Burwell:\n\nMinute Books (1819-1872); (1873-1920)\n\nMembership Lists (1826-1972)\n\nCemetery Records (to 1926)\n\nThe Minute Books (1819-1872) are also on LDS film # 0804351, item 3, on indefinite loan at the London & St. Thomas LDS Family History Centre.\n\nChurch minute book, 1819-1872\n\nAuthor: Port Burwell Baptist Church (Ontario); Canadian Baptist Historical Collection\n\nHistory: The first Baptist congregation in this district was organized in 1819. The early Port Burwell Baptist church was erected on the east side of the Otter Creek, near what is now the intersection of the First Concession and Highway 19. It was here that Joseph Merrill donated three and a quarter acres of land at the southeast corner of Lot 12, Concession 2 to the Trustees of the church for a site and a cemetery. The deed was registered July 4, 1835. (Estherville Cemetery). At that time it was known as the Bayham Baptist Church, since it was the first Baptist congregation organized in the township. Alexander Saxton was the master builder, and James Hatch was the decorator. It was a large church with a gallery on three sides, capable of seating four or five hundred people, and was said to have been one of the finest Baptist Churches west of Toronto in its day. Elder Joseph Merrill was the first pastor and continued his leadership until his death in October 1842. In 1829, membership was eighty, but had grown to 209 by 1842.\n\nIn 1865 the church building was torn down and rebuilt on a somewhat smaller scale at its present location in the village of Port Burwell on Wellington Street. It was opened and dedicated on December 17, 1865\n\nMinisters: see Port Burwell Baptist Church\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Baptist\n\nName of Church: Port Burwell Baptist Church (formerly First Bayham Baptist Church)\n\nLocation: Wellington Street, Port Burwell\n\nDate of Formation: 1865 [continuation of First Bayham Church]\n\nDate of Closing: 1969\n\nAffiliations: Estherville\n\nRecords: The Canadian Baptist Archives lists the following records for this church in their collection:\n\nMinute Books (1819 – 1872); (1873 – 1920); (1921-1938); (1938-1954); 1955 – 1966)\n\nMembership List (1826 – 1971)\n\nCemetery Records (to 1926)\n\nThe Minute Book (1819-1872) is also found on LDS microfilm number 0804351, item 3, and is on permanent loan at the St. Thomas LDS Family History Centre.\n\nHistory: The Baptist church at Port Burwell began in 1865 when the First Baptist church at Estherville was closed and rebuilt in Port Burwell, using some of the materials from the old church. The new building was dedicated on December 17, 1865. After a long and successful history, membership had been declining in the 1960’s, and after celebrating the congregation’s 150th anniversary in 1969, no further ministers were secured and the church was closed. The church sat vacant for a number of years, and when attempts by the Village of Port Burwell to purchase the building and convert it into a Marine Museum failed, the church was demolished in 1986.\n\nFurther history: “Memories – A History of Port Burwell”, Frank Prothero, 1986\n\nMinisters:\n\nJoseph Merrill, 1819-1842\n\nRev.

Elder McDorman was the first Baptist preacher conducting a special mission in this settlement, holding services for several weeks in the schoolhouse. Through the efforts of Deacon Timpany, a church was organized on March 14, 1855 with eighteen members requesting letters of dismissal from the Regular Baptist Churches of Malahide Jubiliee and First Bayham, in order to form their own congregation at Calton. In April, they organized themselves in to a church. In August 1856, the church met in its new chapel for dedication services. The first church was erected on land given by Deacon Timpany and was known as Malahide Union Chapel, and was open to evangelical services of other denominations. A new brick church was erected and opened in 1887 north of the corners in Calton on the east side, and the church was re-named Calton Baptist.\n\nA deed exists, dated Jan. 13, 1887, between Joseph Cartwright and Albert Cohoon, George C. Truman, David L. Augustine, George Spence, James P. Vanvelzor & William B. McConnell, Trustees, for 14 acres – part of the south half of lot 1, concession 4. This no doubt refers to the new church building, and perhaps additional land for the cemetery. Membership in the church by this time had risen to about 100. The new church featured a gallery across one end and also a large, well-equipped basement for Sunday School.\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Baptist\n\nName of Church: Eden Baptist Church (Second Regular Baptist Church)\n\nLocation: 56927 Eden Line\n\n(519) 866-3686; mailing address: P.O.

Early meetings were held in a log school house near the old cemetery on Ridge Road, south of Eden. Between 1853 and 1855, the Goshen church closed, and the members were taken into the Eden church. Also during this period, a chapel was built about ½ mile east of Eden. In 1856, twelve members asked for letters of dismissal to re-organize the Goshen church. In 1859, 22 members asked for letters of dismissal to organize an independent church; the request was granted and the organization took place in 1860. In 1875, the chapel was moved to Eden and a parsonage was built on the present site, which was donated by Edwin Gray; also three acres of land adjoining the church property was given for a cemetery. The church was raised up and bricked about 1890. A new baptistry was installed in 1916, and alterations were made to the front of the church. The choir loft was lowered to the same level as the platform.\n\nFurther history: “Hundredth Anniversary of Eden Baptist Church 1848-1948″ (Elgin OGS has a copy)\n\nMinisters:\n\nElder Baker, 1848\n\nSimeon Rouse, 1849-1853\n\nA.

This church, also known as the Benson Chapel, was located at the west end of the 10th concession, on the north side of the road. It was a Wesleyan Methodist congregation. There is no record of when the church was built, but it is known that ministers in the church in 1850 were Samuel Phelps and John English. In 1851 ministers were George Kennedy and Thomas Peacock. This congregation purchased land from Thomas Firby in 1855 for the Firby Cemetery, which actually has burials dating back to 1850.\n\nTrustees of the Benson Chapel in 1855 were Hiram Moss, Joseph Firby, George Silverthorne, William Kipp Jr., John Medcalfe, Samuel McKenney and Thomas Cascadden. It is presumed that this church closed in 1884 when the Methodist Church of Canada was formed by the union of Primitive Methodist, Episcopal Methodist and Bible Christian churches. It may have closed a few years earlier, in 1880, when a new Methodist church was built at Corinth. After the Moss Church was closed, it was moved south and became part of the cheese factory north of the Firby cemetery, being used for the manufacturing room. When the cheese factory was no longer used, it was torn down by a carpenter from Brownsville.\n\nMany names of persons contributing to the missionary fund were kept over the years. In 1875, many of the names that had been on the list at the\n\nBenson Chapel were listed on the Corinth list. Corinth at this time was on the Brownsville circuit, including Brownsville, Delmer, Bayham, Dereham and Culloden.\n\nThe deed for the church property bears the date of May 8, 1859, between Daniel Moss and the Trustees of the Wesleyan Methodist Church, for property in lot 1, concession 10.

Also listed under Tillsonburg are Trustee Board Minutes of Eden (Methodist) United Church, 1903-1934. The history given states this church was never actually active, although a Trustee Board looked after the disposition of its property.\n\nHistory: The community of Maple Grove is located on land deeded to David Hatch, between Big and Little Otter Creeks on Ridge Road, running from Concession 8 to Talbot St. David Hatch and his brother-in-law William Bowes were said to have been two of seven trustees, who moved the first frame church to Maple Grove from Straffordville. This church, which was the former New Connection Methodist church at Straffordville, was taken down in 1871, moved and rebuilt and dedicated three years later, about 1874.\n\nMaple Grove was part of a five-point charge, the others being North Hall, Eden, Straffordville and Guysboro. A minister came only every two weeks, and local preachers took charge of the services. Names connected with this congregation are Thomas and John Hatch (sons of David), Levi Hatch, Edwin Bowes, Henry Hatch, Jacob Ketchabaw, John and William Wilson, William and John Stewart, William Chamberlain, Walter Mitchell, William Yeandle, James Procunier, Elgin Hatch, and Andrew Dean.\n\nIt is said the new brick church was built about 1900. It is possible that this building was moved to Tillsonburg and converted into the Orange Lodge hall.\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Methodist (became United Church of Canada in 1925)\n\nName of Church: Straffordville United Church\n\nLocation: 9279 Duke Street (at Heritage Line), Straffordville\n\nStraffordville Pastoral Charge, Box 220, Straffordville, ON N0J 1Y0\n\n(519) 866-3626\n\nDate of Formation: 1852\n\nDate of Closing: active\n\nAffiliations: Vienna Circuit\n\nRecords: contact church at above mailing address\n\nHistory: This church was originally a Wesleyan Methodist congregation, and in 1853-1854 is recorded as having contributed to the Missionary Fund from the newly formed Vienna Circuit.

In 1865, Straffordville is listed on the Bayham circuit, which included Guysboro, Eden, Nelles and Dobbie’s. In 1875 the circuit included seven points – Maple Grove, Eden, Richmond, North Hall, Pine Grove (Garnham), Brick and Straffordville. In 1879 a parsonage was built at Straffordville and in 1883 a church was built. In 1888 the circuit was made up of Straffordville, Eden, Guysboro, Maple Grove and North Hall. In 1910 the 26-year old church moved five blocks away. In 1924-1926 the church and bell tower was raised and a basement installed. Sod was turned for a new church on April 12, 1964, and the first service was held there on December 20, 1964. The new church is located on lot 124, North Side Talbot Road (corner of Heritage Line and Duke Street). The old church was sold to another congregation and became known as the Glad Tidings Chapel.

These efforts led to the construction of the Wesleyan Methodist church in Port Burwell which began in 1850 and dedicated in 1852. It was a frame building, erected on the site of the present brick church. It was built under the direction of George Backhouse. Some of the timber and pillars were purchased from the original Baptist church north of the village which was being dismantled at that time. Leonidas Burwell donated the land for the church in a deed dated April 19, 1852. Samuel Lee was the chief architect. First preacher on the Port Burwell and Vienna charge was Rev. O. H. Elsworth, who arrived in 1854. Previous to this, both places had been missions, with outside preachers holding services. The church remained in the possession of the Methodist church until May 1911, when it was sold to the Free Methodist congregation to be moved, and was still in use by that congregation in the 1930’s. In September1910, the corner stones of the present church were laid by Squire William Backhouse, David Marshall, M.P., and Mrs. E. E. McConnell. The church was completed and dedicated in December 1911. A bell was installed in the tower of the church in 1955.\n\nMinisters:\n\nRev. O. H. Elsworth, 1854\n\nRev. T. L. McCutcheon, 1894\n\nRev. R.

It was moved from its original location to Lot 35, Shakespeare Street. The Free Methodists did not join the union creating the United Church of Canada in 1925, and therefore had to struggle with a small congregation. The last two decades of the church’s existence were due largely to the dedication of Harry & Dorothy Alward. Mr. Alward took over as lay pastor in 1952 and held the church together until 1966. The church closed in 1967 and the church was demolished in June 1980 when it became a fire hazard.\n\nMinisters: [earlier ministers names not available]\n\nRev. J. R. Lambert, 1946-1949\n\nRev. G. F.

Brinton P. Brown came to Dereham township and settled where the village of Brownsville is now. He was a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and began holding meetings in the homes of the community. Soon he was preaching in the adjoining communities of the Jones Settlement (Corinth), and the Chauncey Smith Settlement (North Bayham). There is a record of a communion service being held in his home in 1843. Attending from North Bayham were the families of Chauncey Smith, Thomas Benstead Arn and John Malcolm.\n\nThe first church was built on the farm of Chauncey Smith, lot 16, Concession 11, about 1866. It was a white frame building and served the community for 42 years. A deed exists dated Nov. 25, 1865 for property in lot 16, concession 11, between Chauncey Smith and James Hill, et al, Trustees of the Canadian Wesleyan Methodist New Connection Chapel. The Brownsville Circuit was formed in 1874 and included Brownsville, Delmer, North Bayham, Corinth, Culloden and Dereham Centre. The circuit was served by a resident minister living at Brownsville and a student minister assisting. The Corinth Circuit was formed in 1896 or 1897, and North Bayham became part of that circuit. When plans were being made for a new building, it was decided to change the location to a site adjacent to the North Bayham school where the concession (10) line joins No. 3 Highway.\n\nThe cornerstone for a new church was laid on August 30, 1907 and completed and dedicated on March 8, 1908. The church was described as a two-storey building with block and cement basement and brick walls. The main entrance was in a tower at the south corner and the choir gallery and pulpit platform in the opposite corner. In 1909, North Hall was added to the circuit. In 1933 the Richmond-Corinth Circuit was formed, including North Bayham, and the church at North Hall was closed. North Bayham became part of the Springfield Circuit in 1964, which included Corinth, Springfield and North Bayham. The North Bayham church held a farewell closing service on November 10, 1968, and the church was officially closed on November 15, 1968. An auction of the furniture, kitchen equipment, etc. was held on February 25, 1969, and on September 25 of the same year, the church building was sold and was removed by October 25.\n\nFurther history: Corinth & North Bayham Tweedsmuir History\n\nMinisters:\n\n[1866-1906]\n\nRev.

It is presumed both congregations were joined together when the new church was built in the village of Corinth in 1880. This congregation was first on the Brownsville circuit, which included Brownsville, Delmer, Bayham, Dereham, and Culloden. Corinth was removed from this circuit in 1896 and put on with North Bayham and North Hall. The North Hall church was closed in 1935 and Corinth was put on the Richmond Circuit which was made up of Richmond, Summers Corners, North Bayham, Fairview and Corinth. In 1934 the church shed at North Hall was torn down and added to the Corinth shed. In the spring of 1963 it was decided to build a Fellowship room on the back of the church to be used for Sunday School and a meeting place. The building was named “Gould Fellowship Hall”, in honour of Rev. J. N. Gould of Aylmer, who served at Corinth from 1944 to 1955. In 1964, the circuit was again changed, with Corinth being placed on the Springfield circuit, made up of Springfield, Corinth and North Bayham. At this time, the parsonage was sold to Leo Smith, of Corinth. The Corinth United Church closed in 1997, and the building was converted into a residence.\n\nFurther History: -article in Tillsonburg News, April 21, 1980, Corinth Church 100 Years Old\n\n– Corinth & North Bayham Tweedsmuir History\n\nMinisters:\n\nBrownsville circuit:\n\nJohn Saunders, Charles C.

The ministers used to come out from Richmond and hold Sabbath preaching in the old Dobbie schoolhouse on the sideroad where the Hatch farm was located. In 1862, three school sections united, and the Dobbie school children attended the White Schoolhouse, south of Corinth. All ages attended Sunday School at the White School in the afternoons on a weekly basis. At this time, the congregation from North Hall would attend this Sunday school at White’s School, then walk down the road for church services at the Templar’s Hall, a crude red brick edifice near where the North Hall Church was later built. The Templars were a lodge organized for the cause of temperance, and ministers of the New Connection Methodist church preached there. It was part of the Bayham circuit, along with Garnham’s, Eden, Straffordville, and the Brick Schoolhouse. For 14 years, this hall served as a church for the North Hall congregation, from 1864 to 1878.A deed exists dated June 1, 1878 for 1/4 acre in the north half of lot 8, concession 8 between Elisha Howell and the Trustees of North Hall Methodist Church.\n\nA brick church was built on this lot in 1878, and by this time, the North Hall congregation had been transferred from the Richmond Circuit to the Straffordville Circuit. At the time of the dedication of the church, the minister was Rev. Francis Nugent, of Straffordville. The church building committee consisted of Abram Todd, A. L. Cook, Henry Berry and Haggai Cook.\n\nThe church was changed to the Corinth Circuit in 1909, and celebrated its golden anniversary of its erection on Aug. 19, 1928.\n\nDue to declining attendance, services were discontinued in June 1934. The church shed was given to the Corinth United Church in 1934, and preparations were made to dispose of the rest of the church property, which was done by auction. The church was sold in 1935 to Charles Laister of Tillsonburg, who dismantled it. The property was sold to Earl Greer, who owned the adjoining property.\n\nFurther history: Corinth & North Bayham Tweedsmuir History\n\nMinisters:\n\nBayham-Richmond circuit:\n\nRev.

When the Rebellion broke out in 1837, the stormy time put a stop to the work, and it was never completed. The frame was sold to a Mr. Durdle some years later who tore it down. In 1845, it was decided to build a chapel in Vienna for the Wesleyan Methodist church. A 1/5 acre lot was deeded to the Wesleyan Methodist congregation on May 19, 1845 by Thomas & Snow Edison (part of lot 14, concession 3). The building was still in the process of being erected in 1849. The Episcopal Methodist congregation in Vienna joined this church in 1884. A basement was put under the church in 1950. The Vienna United Church is now closed, but continues as “The Church at Vienna” (519) 874-4975.\n\nFurther history: “Vienna United Church History, 1840-1965″ (Elgin OGS has a copy)\n\nMinisters:\n\nMalahide Circuit (1840-1853):\n\nThomas Fawcett, 1840\n\nLuther O.

It was located just north of the four corners in Corinth, known as the Jones Corners. It was on the east side of the road, and was a red brick building. A deed exists for property in the south part of lot 6, concession 10, dated August 2, 1875 between Thomas Weaver and Isaac Smith, Guilford Marr, & Michael Wolfe, Trustees. It was first a Church of the Christian Brethren, and later the Methodist Episcopal Church. It is presumed that the congregation of the Moss Church and this church joined together when the new Methodist church was built in Corinth in 1880.\n\nAfter this building was no longer used as a church, it became a hall for the use of the community. It was also used for holding court, and court cases for this area were tried there, court sessions being held every fall. This building remained on the site until about 1935 when it was demolished by Charles Laister of Tillsonburg.\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Methodist\n\nName of Church: Straffordville Methodist Episcopal Church\n\nLocation: Straffordville (lot 125, North Talbot Road)\n\nDate of Formation: between 1851 and 1861\n\nDate of Closing: 1884 (became Straffordville Methodist Church; now United church)\n\nAffiliations: Vienna (1840-1880’s)\n\nRecords: no known records\n\nHistory: A deed exists dated Oct. 25, 1855 between Joab Leach and the Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church, for property in lot 125, North Talbot Road.

In 1854, Presbyterians from Port Burwell, Vienna and Straffordville began holding meetings in schools and homes, and eventually organized themselves as The Free Presbyterian Church of Canada. They were served by visiting ministers or missionaries during this time. By 1867, the congregation was strong enough in Port Burwell to consider erecting a church. Property for the building of a church was deeded on March 4, 1868 by Mr & Mrs L. Burwell to the congregation of the Canada Presbyterian Church. The frame church of substantial size was built in 1867 on the corner of Victoria and Erieus Streets. The first permanent minister, Rev. James Donaldson, did not arrive until about 1872. Dissension arose within the congregation surrounding the minister, who left in 1873. Many of the members had left the church by this time. For the next twenty years, it is not certain whether any attempt was made to continue services there. In 1896, the building was bought by James Burger who moved it to Main Street where it was used as a livery stable. It was destroyed by fire about 1913. The original building site was sold later and became the lawn of a residence which stood behind the old church.\n\nFurther history: “Memories – A History of Port Burwell”, Frank Prothero, 1986\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Roman Catholic\n\nName of Church: Roman Catholic Church, Vienna\n\nLocation: corner of Fulton Street and Edison Drive (formerly Main Street), Vienna\n\nDate of Formation: 1850’s\n\nDate of Closing: 1873\n\nAffiliations: Circuit – Charlotteville to Tillsonburg\n\nRecords: no known records; contact Roman Catholic Archives in London\n\nHistory: In 1851, there were about 65 Catholics living in Bayham township, and by 1860, there were over 150, about one-third of them residing in Vienna. The Roman Catholic congregation at Vienna was formed in the 1850’s, and was part of a circuit including churches from Charlotteville to Tillbonsburg. In the 1850’s, it was served by priests from Brantford to LaSalette. A church was built on Main Street about 1860 on a lot donated by Vienna watchmaker Henry Vogt.A deed exists dated May 16, 1861 for lot 10, west side of Main Street, from Henry Vogt to the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of Sandwich. During the 1860’s, Vienna had resident clergymen, including Father J. Wagner & Father G. Volkert. By the 1870’s, the Catholic population in Vienna had been reduced by half, and the church was closed in 1873. Apparently, occasional services continued to be held, as there is record of the last Mass being said in 1883. On May 20, 1901, the London Diocese sold this lot to Alexander S. Stillwell, who on Dec. 9, 1901 sold it to the Trustees of the Vienna Circuit of the Denomination of United Brethren in Christ. This congregation worshipped there for several years, but was purchased by the Vienna Masonic Lodge # 237 in 1912. The Lodge was still active in this building in 2006.\n\n***\n\nTownship: Bayham\n\nDenomination: Roman Catholic\n\nName of Church: St. Joseph’s Roman Catholic Church\n\nLocation: 59 Victoria Street, Port Burwell\n\nDate of Formation: 1937\n\nDate of Closing: closed circa 2004 (now Lighthouse Gospel Church)\n\nRecords: contact London Catholic Diocese Archives\n\nHistory: This congregation was formed on June 20, 1937, largely due to the efforts of Monsignor J. H. O’Neil of Tillsonburg, who made frequent visits to the 35 Catholic families in the Port Burwell area. The congregation was first organized as a mission, and a cement block house was rented and eventually purchased in 1938 from a Mr. Sampson. In 1941, the former St. Brigitta Church in Port Bruce was moved to Port Burwell to a lot behind the Sampson house. It was renovated to accommodate about 75 people, and the first mass in the church was held on August 3, 1941. The mission became a parish in 1947 with Father Stephen Toth being named the first pastor. After about a year, Father Toth moved the services back into the former Sampson house and sold the church building to Ralph Hurley, and is now the first home south of the United Church. During the 1950’s, two acres of land was purchased on Victoria Street for a future church. The project of building a new church and rectory was begun in August 1965. The first mass held in the new building was March 30, 1966, and was blessed by Bishop G. Emmett Carter of the London Diocese in November 1966. The new building contained several special rooms, including four bedrooms for visiting priests, and a “crying room” where mothers of small children may watch the service from behind a sound-proof window and hear the words and music over an intercom system. The church was closed probably around 2004, with a liturgy celebrated by Bishop Fabbro. The building was purchased by the Lighthouse Gospel Church, a congregation of the Evangelical Mennonite Mission Conference.\n\nFurther history: -article in Aylmer Express, Nov. 9, 1966, re blessing of new church\n\n– “Memories – A History of Port Burwell”, Frank Prothero, 1986\n\nPriests:\n\nMonsignor J.

Since the only information known about the Plymouth Brethren church is that is was located south of Straffordville on Highway 19, this deed matches that description quite closely. There is a white frame church still standing (8507 Plank Line, just north of Jackson Road) but it is not known if this is the same building used by the Plymouth Brethren.

Christopher Pearson was elected the first pastor, and enrollment consisted of twelve members. Services of this congregation were held in the homes, some of which were Christopher Pearson, William Jenkins and Thomas Bearss. A lot southeast of the railroad tracks in Corinth was donated by William Jenkins in 1882, and a small, white frame edifice was erected and dedicated on June 19, 1883. In 1908 the church was raised and blocked. The church was known for many years as “the little white church at Corinth”. In 1975, the former Corinth Public School south of Corinth on Elgin Road 44 (now Eden Line) was purchased and renovated by the congregation for their church building. The first service there was held on November 30, 1975. The “little white church” was converted into a home. The congregation celebrated its centennial and dedication services on Oct. 15 & 17, 1976. The name of the denomination was changed in 2001 to “Community of Christ” to more accurately reflect the Church’s mission and theology. Their mission statement is “We proclaim Jesus Christ & promote communities of joy, hope, love and peace”.\n\nFurther history: Corinth & North Bayham Tweedsmuir History\n\nPastors:\n\nChristopher Pearson, 1876-1883\n\nWilliam Jenkins, 1883-1887\n\nChristopher Pearson, 1887-1911\n\nWilliam Jenkins, 1911-1913\n\nHenry Pearson, 1913-1919\n\nAlbert Borbridge, 1919-1921\n\nCecil Beemer, 1921\n\nHenry Pearson, 1922-1940\n\nCecil Beemer, 1940-1950\n\nHoward Marshall, 1950-1952\n\nArchie Barham, 1952-1960\n\nThomas McDonald, 1960-1961\n\nArchie Barham, 1961-1964\n\nEarl Hill, 1964-1965\n\nArchie Barham, 1965-1973\n\nHoward Jenney, 1973-1974\n\nJohn Greenwood, 1974-1982\n\nGlenn Groves, 1982-1987\n\nJohn Greenwood, 1987-1993\n\nArchie Hill, 1993-2003\n\nCheryl Brooks & Pastoral Team, 2003-\n\nOther Current Places of Worship found in Bayham Township:\n\nCorinth Mennonite Church\n\n56519 Eden Line\n\n866-3883\n\nMission Baptist Church\n\n35 Plank Road\n\nStraffordville, 866-5585\n\nStraffordville Evangelical Mennonite Church\n\n8277 Plank Road\n\n866-5460\n\nCalton Conservative Mennonite Church\n\n6732 Richmond Road\n\nUnidentified white frame church at\n\n8277 Plank Road (south of Straffordville)\n\nStraffordville Gospel Hall\n\nPlank Line (beside # 9132)\n\nFrom FamilySearch"
