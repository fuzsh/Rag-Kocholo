        "text": "As an aside, it is more than likely that Penson’s use of terracotta at Christ Church, Welshpool was known to T G Newnham, the local architect associated with Poundley & Walker, and who supervised Rev. John Parker’s highly eccentric work at Llanmerewig (two miles north of Kerry), where Parker was rector from 1827-1844. When Newnham came to build the neighbouring church at Dolfor in 1851 (recently declared redundant) he was to make extensive use of terracotta, including, as we now know, cleverly disguised in the elaborate roof structure, as well as in the window tracery, belfry and corbels1.\n\nThomas Penson was succeeded as County Surveyor for Montgomeryshire at his death by his son Richard Kyrke Penson (1816-86; for more on R K Penson see our story, The Gothic Fantasy of Sir Thomas Lloyd). Penson Jr. was followed in his turn after a few years by J W Poundley.2 Poundley’s own significant and independent work dates from the last decade of his life, and includes only one church that he designed apart from his partner, David Walker.3 That church, St John the Baptist, Carno (1863), is a simple, single-cell building, notable only for some restrained detailing in the belfry, the ironwork on the roof-ridge and a rather bold east window.\n\nIt is to be suspected that the major share in the designs for the ecclesiastical work of the partnership fell to David Walker of Liverpool (who seems to have spent a great deal of his time in this Montgomeryshire border area).\n\nWalker (1840-92) was born in Birkenhead, but his professional life centred on Liverpool, across the Mersey. He had been a pupil there in the practice of W H and J M Hay, before establishing his own office. His partnership with Poundley (it is not clear how that came about; it was in existence by 1863-4, so it seems likely that it followed closely on the completion of his pupilage) was fruitful but not of long duration; it was formally dissolved in 1867 when Walker was only 27. Poundley, as indicated earlier, was considerably older; more than 30 years separated them. Although Walker may have taken the bulk of the ecclesiastical work of their joint practice, he does not seem to have designed many new churches after Poundley’s death in 1872; Holy Trinity, Gwernaffield (1871-2) was already building when he died, though St John the Evangelist, Great Sutton, on the Wirral (1878-82), St John the Baptist, Rhyl (1884-90) and St Mary, Beaumont, Cumberland (1887-9) are certainly by him.4\n\nBetween 1863 and 1868 the partners were together responsible for three, possibly four, churches in Montgomeryshire, one in Radnorshire and one in Denbighshire, as well as undertaking some restoration/rebuilding at Machynlleth in 1864.5 The new churches in Montgomeryshire were at Darowen and Trefeglwys (both in 1864) and at Llanbrynmair – now a ruin – in 1868.6 It is likely, on stylistic grounds, that the partnership was also responsible for Llanwyddelan in 1865.7 In Radnorshire there is the splendid church at Abbey Cwmhir (1866), which was complemented by its ‘companion piece’, the adjoining Abbey Cwmhir Hall (1867). In Denbighshire, Llanbedr Dyffryn Clwyd (1863) seems to be the earliest ecclesiastical work of the partnership. Trefeglwys, described by Richard Haslam as ‘well designed and dull’, is a rebuild on earlier foundations; Darowen is well-proportioned, light and simple, which can also be said of Llanwyddelan; and Llanbrynmair, built for a new community, was short-lived and is now a ruin.\n\nDavid Walker continued to work in the area after 1867, but concentrated here on secular and not ecclesiastical commissions; his rather grandiose extensions at Nantclwyd Hall of 1875-6, now almost entirely demolished. In the ecclesiastical field three works stand out, and all are in relation to the conservation of the masterpieces of the late medieval ‘Newtown School’ of wood-carving: the screens and rood-lofts at Llanwnnog, Llananno, and Newtown itself, of which he left a record.11At Newtown the medieval parish church of St Mary, prone to constant flooding, was finally abandoned in the 1840s, and replaced between 1843 and 1847 by Thomas Penson’s costly (£4600) St David’s, on higher ground. To this new church, in 1856, was removed from St Mary’s what Richard Haslam called the ‘exceptionally fine and long screen of c.1500, the highest in quality of any of the so-called Newtown School, except perhaps Llananno.’ Rev. John Parker made a number of visits to St Mary’s between 1828 and 1832, visits which resulted in at least a dozen meticulous drawings, some showing the original colour, but sadly, though these are invaluable records of the surviving detailing at that date, he does not seem to have made one of the screen in its entirety more than a quarter of a century before its removal from St Mary’s to St David’s.\n\nThereafter this masterpiece of late medieval woodwork had an unhappy history. In 1874-5 Penson’s short apsidal chancel was replaced by a larger, square-ended, one by David Walker. At the same time, the medieval screen was dismantled, and was presumably put into storage, as it does not emerge again until 1909, when panelling, probably from the loft, was used to line the sanctuary, and then again in 1938 when H L North had the rest re-erected as a parclose screen in the north aisle. However, St David’s is now closed, and the screen was moved again, after some debate as to its housing, to Llanllwchaiarn, the adjoining and linked parish to Newtown. It is a somewhat unhappy solution, as Llanllwchaiarn Church was rebuilt in brick in 1815 and today is effectively a ‘gothicized’ Regency building.\n\nExcept at Abbey Cwmhir and Llanbedr Dyffryn Clwyd, Poundley and Walker were working with modest budgets. The churches at Darowen, Trefeglwys, Llanwyddelan and Carno were all erected on the sites and foundations of pre-existing medieval buildings with simple ground-plans. The rebuilt churches were fitted out as economically as possible, with few architectural flourishes. The chancel arch at Trefeglwys, carved by Edward Griffiths of Chester (who Poundley & Walker also used at their 1863-5 Town Hall for Ruthin) is one example, and Poundley’s embellishments at Carno would be another. Their churches were equipped with the necessary furnishings – seating, pulpit, reading desk, font and communion table – and even here some items were re-used from the earlier church. At Trefeglwys, somewhat unusually, they re-used the western lancet and perpendicular east window. At Llanwyddelan the 15th–century font, 17th–century communion table, and fragment of the pre-conquest cross-shaft were retained15, and care taken elsewhere to salvage wall-mounted monuments and memorials.16"
