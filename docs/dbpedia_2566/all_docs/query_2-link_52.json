        "text": "VVN’s Most Impactful People in Cycling Esports For 2024 List aims to recognize the athletes and individuals who have left their mark on cycling esports, humanizing their personalities and introducing the game-changers, groundbreakers, and difference-makers behind the scenes shaping this new cycling era.\n\nSpotlighting these personalities puts a face to the digital avatar and builds a fan identity and relationship crucial for the growth and sustainability of the evolving sport.\n\nThe word “impactful” means different things to different people, and it is thrown around too often in specific contexts when describing situations where there is still a lot of work to do. However, the individuals on this list have had a powerful and undeniable effect on the birth and growth of the sport.\n\nWhen you still have a long way to go, it’s easier to see where you started. Recognizing the people who set the groundwork is essential: the visionaries and the dreamers who were there from the beginning—the unknown and unheralded whose passion paved the way for creating a new cycling discipline.\n\nWe needed to make that distinction for the first annual edition, knowing historical figures would dominate the record. Many remain, whereas others have passed the torch, and ongoing yearly iterations will acknowledge the forward thinkers and innovators who have brought the sport to new heights.\n\nAfter countless interviews, impromptu inquiries, and exhaustive research, an extensive list of nominees took shape. We brought in an award-winning cycling journalist, an elite esports racer, and the captain of South Africa’s National Esports squad, Aaron Borrill, as the deciding vote to sit alongside Chris and Si.\n\nThe three-person panel put each name up against the following criteria, and the first compilation of its kind took shape.\n\nBrian Duffy Jr is easily the most consistent cycling Esports racer in the world right now, having secured the 2024 USA Cycling Esports National Championships in emphatic style over an omnium-type format. The co-founder of NeXT eSports pb Enshored has developed a knack for conserving energy during races and only using it when needed—something he continues to demonstrate week in, week out in the top rungs of elite cycling esports. But what makes Brian such an inspiration to his peers is his affable demeanor and willingness to help others and impart knowledge to his teammates, which has earned him many fans. With the 2024 UCI Cycling Esports World Championships set to take place in October, you can bet your bottom dollar Brian will be in with a shot for overall honors.\n\nBlake Pond is the founder of Nopinz, creators of the SpeedPocket; the transparent sleeve found on the back of a skinsuit that houses a race number. He has developed and produced some of the fastest kit on the planet and, as a problem solver and innovator, also saw the need for an indoor-specific kit, which was non-existent at the time. In 2020 the Nopinz Subzero range was launched—featuring lightweight, perforated material, an indoor-specific chamois pad, and clever sewn-in pockets to hold frozen gel packs to help cool riders and drop core temperatures. It was a success, and many established brands soon followed Blake’s lead and vision. The innovative kit is now in its second generation and is used by myriad esports athletes, including two of the successful teams in the Zwift Racing League, Saris-Nopinz and Toyota Elite Ecycling.\n\nRachael is a truly inspiring individual with incredible talent and natural ability as both a runner and cyclist. A classically trained violinist, she picked up cycling late in life after a foot injury curtailed her running career. She turned to cycling, time trialing more specifically, where she quickly forged a name as one of the best female time trialists in the UK, breaking the 30-mile record as well as taking the National Closed Circuit title at Thruxton racetrack in 2017. On Zwift, she was equally as successful.\n\nHer Zwift achievements include 1st place at the CVR World Cup finals in Paris, winning the women’s world champs in 2016, and getting an invite to the Zwift Academy finals, which she had to decline for work reasons. In 2018, Rachael suffered a hemorrhagic stroke while training on Zwift, which left her almost completely blind. Owing to her impaired vision, she returned to time trialing on a tandem bike with Ian Greenstreet. The duo have since broken nearly every course record and competition in their category. Rachael continues to inspire many able-bodied and disabled athletes and still uses Zwift to train and race.\n\nWho is on your list? Now, we turn the spotlight over to you, the community. Who are the figures that impact you? Are there unsung heroes that deserve recognition? Please share your thoughts and stories with us. Your insights enrich our conversation and help us all discover new sources of inspiration and understanding.\n\nEngage with us in the comments below and on our social media platforms. Whether it’s suggesting names, sharing personal anecdotes about how a particular individual has influenced you, or even debating the merits of those listed, your input is invaluable.\n\nTogether, let’s continue celebrating the achievements of those who pave the way for progress, challenge the status quo, and inspire the evolution of cycling esports. Your perspective is crucial to this ongoing dialogue, and we can’t wait to hear from you."
