        "meta_description": "Kenneth Womack's guest on this episode of “Everything Fab Four” is English singer/songwriter Dave Mason, who first found fame and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his work with the rock band Traffic. He wrote and sang lead on Traffic’s 1968 single “Feelin Alright?” which also went on to become a hit for Joe Cocker and throughout the years has been covered by a wide range of artists, from the Jackson 5 to Widespread Panic. Over the course of his legendary career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable musicians, including Paul McCartney and George Harrison, and on Jimi Hendrix's version of “All Along the Watchtower.” In this conversation, Mason talks about being a young musician in London when the Beatles hit, listening to “Sgt. Pepper” at George Harrison's house, what it was like playing with Jimi, and more.",

        "text": "On today’s episode, American jazz fusion guitarist and singer-songwriter George Benson drops by to discuss what gave the Beatles “prestige” and how the band helped Black musicians succeed.\n\nBenson recorded his first album The New Boss Guitar, at 21, and followed it up with It’s Uptown with the George Benson Quartet. In 1969, he recorded his homage to the Beatles’ album Abbey Road, entitled The Other Side of Abbey Road.\n\nThings really took off for Benson in the mid-1970s, beginning with the LP Bad Benson, which topped the Billboard jazz charts in 1974. Benson scored a triple-platinum hit with his 1976 album Breezin’, and in 1978, he earned a Grammy award for his live rendition of “On Broadway.”\n\nIn 1980, Benson took the pop charts by storm with his studio album Give Me the Night. Produced by Quincy Jones, the LP yielded several hit singles including the upbeat, jazz-infused title track.\n\nBenson’s latest LP Dreams Do Come True features orchestrations that had been lost for 35 years, and were recently unearthed from his archive. The collection includes Benson’s takes on such standards as “Autumn Leaves,” “At Last,” “My Romance,” “A Song for You,” and the Beatles’ “Yesterday.”\n\nOver the years, Benson has earned 10 Grammy Awards, while seeing his career memorialized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nOn this bonus episode of Everything Fab Four, we trace two television icons from the 1970s—both very different in terms of target audience, but united in the inspiration that they drew from the Beatles.\n\nFirst is the New Zoo Revue, the children’s TV show that was broadcast from 1972 through 1977. Designed as a musical comedy, it ran for 196 episodes and imparting valuable life lessons to the program’s legions of child viewers. The show was hosted by husband and wife duo Doug and Emmy Jo. On the New Zoo Revue, they interacted with an array of loveable costumed characters, including Henrietta Hippo and Freddie the Frog.\n\nAt the other end of the TV demographic spectrum is George Schlatter, the founder of network television’s groundbreaking Laugh-In. The hilarious sketch comedy program ran for more than 140 episodes between 1968 and 1973.\n\nWith Dan Rowan and Dick Martin as Schlatter’s irreverent hosts, Laugh-In thrived on its moveable feast of guest stars, including the likes of Jack Benny, Johnny Carson, Sammy Davis, Jr., Phyllis Diller and more. Laugh-In also launched the careers of series regulars Goldie Hawn and Lily Tomlin. Last year, Schlatter released his memoir, Still Laughing: A Life in Comedy.\n\nOn this episode of Everything Fab Four, actor and activist Rosanna Arquette shares her favorite Beatles song and recounts where she was when John Lennon died.\n\nAs part of a large show business family—including siblings Patricia and David Arquette—Rosanna began acting as a child. Her father, character actor Lewis Arquette, was well known as “J.D. Pickett” on The Waltons, while her mother Mardi was a poet, political activist, and therapist. Rosanna started working professionally as a teenager and has never stopped.\n\nShe has since appeared in over 70 films, which have earned over $450 million in domestic box office sales. In addition to such early successes as The Executioner’s Song and Baby, It’s You, Arquette has appeared in such beloved classics as After Hours and Pulp Fiction.\n\nArquette expanded her talent as a filmmaker by directing and producing the documentaries, 2002’s Searching for Debra Winger and 2005’s All We Are Saying. She is currently developing projects for both television and film through her company, Flower Child Productions.\n\nAuthor and filmmaker Jamie Bernstein joins Everything Fab Four to discuss growing up with a world-famous father, and why Leonard Bernstein chose Beatles songs to explain musical concepts.\n\nJamie Bernstein’s 2018 memoir, Famous Father Girl, traces the story of growing up with composer-conductor Leonard Bernstein, and pianist and actress Felicia Montealegre in an atmosphere bursting with music, theatre and literature. Famous Father Girl served as the inspiration for the Academy Award-nominated movie Maestro.\n\nOver the years, Bernstein has written and narrated concerts about Mozart, Aaron Copland, and Stravinsky, as well as “The Bernstein Beat,” a family concert about her father. She performs concert narrations all over the world, including for Copland’s “A Lincoln Portrait” and her father’s Symphony No. 3, “Kaddish.” Bernstein has also produced and hosted the New York Philharmonic’s live national radio broadcasts, and recently narrated the podcast “The NY Phil Story: Made in New York.” Her other works include co-directing the award-winning documentary film Crescendo: the Power of Music, about children from struggling urban communities who participate in youth orchestra programs, and articles and poetry in Symphony, Town & Country, and Opera News.\n\nOn this episode, legendary singer-songwriter Darius Rucker joins Everything Fab Four to share how he first discovered the Beatles at five, and which Beatles album he thinks is the “most perfect album ever made.”\n\nRucker first achieved multi-Platinum status in the music industry as lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the GRAMMY Award-winning band Hootie & the Blowfish, who have sold more than 25 million albums worldwide. Their Double Diamond-certified (21x Platinum) debut Cracked Rear View remains among the best-selling studio albums of all time. Since releasing his first country album in 2008, Rucker has earned four No. 1 albums on the Billboard Country chart, 10 No. 1 singles at Country radio, and 11 Gold, Platinum or multi-Platinum certified hits. Rucker was also inducted as a Grand Ole Opry member in 2012, and his GRAMMY-winning version of “Wagon Wheel,” has become one of the top five best-selling Country songs of all time. His brand-new album Carolyn’s Boy is available everywhere now and his first book, a memoir titled “Life’s Too Short,” is set for release via Dey Street Books on May 28th.\n\nA lifelong philanthropist, Rucker co-chaired the campaign that generated $150 million to help build the MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children's Hospital in his hometown of Charleston, S.C., and has raised over $3.6 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital through his annual Darius & Friends benefit concert and golf tournament. In addition, Rucker has advocated for over 200 charitable causes supporting public education and junior golf programs in South Carolina through the Hootie & the Blowfish Foundation and serves as a National Chair for the National Museum of African American Music in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nGrammy-nominated American recording artist Joan Osborne joins Everything Fab Four to talk about hearing “Revolution 9” at a makeout party and how her music career began.\n\nOsborne moved to New York City to attend film school at NYU in the late 1980s, dropping out after becoming involved in the city’s downtown music scene. In 1991, Osborne formed her own record label Womanly Hips, releasing her first album Soul Show: Live at Delta 88. She later signed with Mercury Records, and in 1995 she made her major label debut with the album Relish, which reached the Top 10 on the back of “One of Us,” an international hit that propelled Osborne to stardom.\n\nOsborne has been nominated for eight Grammy Awards, and has performed duets with such icons as Luciano Pavarotti, Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Patti Smith, Emmylou Harris, and Isaac Hayes. She has toured with Mavis Staples, the post-Jerry Garcia Grateful Dead, and Motown's Funk Brothers, while also performing for the Dalai Lama at his monastery in Dharmsala, India. She also regularly records and performs with Trigger Happy, founded by Black Crowes drummer Steve Gorman.\n\nThis summer, she will go on tour in support of her latest album Nobody Owns You.\n\nOn this episode, acclaimed actor and Beatles fan Jeff Daniels joins “Everything Fab Four” to discuss his experience filming a movie scene with George Harrison and getting his guitar signed by the Quiet Beatle.\n\nAcross his five decade-long career, Jeff Daniels has worked with some of the world’s most revered filmmakers. He made his screen debut in Miloš Forman's Ragtime, and followed with James L. Brooks's Terms of Endearment, Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, and Mike Nichols's Heartburn. Daniels has been nominated for numerous Golden Globe and Screen Actors Awards for his dramatic turns, including such films as Jonathan Demme's Something Wild and Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale.\n\nIn 2012, Daniels joined the cast of HBO’s political drama The Newsroom, which earned him a Prime Time Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Playing Will McAvoy, Daniels’ monologue about American exceptionalism in the series pilot has been viewed more than 22 million times on YouTube. His acclaimed television work also includes his portrayal of John O'Neill in the Hulu miniseries The Looming Tower and FBI director James Comey in Showtime’s The Comey Rule.\n\nIn May 2024, stars in the new Netflix limited series A Man In Full, based on Tom Wolfe’s novel of the same name.\n\nEnglish-American music icon Billy Idol joins Everything Fab Four to discuss the exhilaration of being a Beatle fan “in real time” and how his voice was mistaken for Paul McCartney’s.\n\nBilly Idol began his rock n roll career as the guitarist for Chelsea, subsequently achieving renown on the London punk rock scene in the 1970s, when he performed as the lead singer for Generation X. His career truly exploded in the 1980s when he moved to New York City to pursue a solo career working in collaboration with guitarist Steve Stevens. His eponymous debut LP yielded monster hits in “White Wedding” and “Dancing with Myself,” while his 1983 sophomore album Rebel Yell achieved double-platinum success on the heels of “Eyes without a Face” and the sizzling title track “Rebel Yell.”\n\nOver the years, he has continued to burnish his star on the shoulders of such albums as Whiplash Smile, Charmed Life, Cyberpunk, Devil’s Playground, and, most recently, Kings and Queens of the Underground.\n\nIn 2024, Rebel Yell was remastered in a deluxe new edition to celebrate Billy’s incredible 40-year run as one of music’s most beloved, and most notorious, artists.\n\nTo celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the Beatles’ first appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, our guests revisit the evening that the Beatles graced their living rooms for the first time, on this special episode of Everything Fab Four. These Beatles lovers include Steven van Zandt from Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, R&B singer Darlene Love, actor Billy Bob Thornton, and even one lucky audience member from that first Ed Sullivan performance.\n\nIt's almost impossible to imagine what it was like to be at ground zero of American Beatlemania on February 7, 1964, when the group landed at New York City’s John F. Kennedy International Airport, which had been renamed some fifty days earlier in honor of the fallen leader. The band’s Pan Am flight was met with the screams and fanfare of some 5,000 people, whom the Beatles claimed to have heard—incredible as it may seem—even as the plane was taxiing along the runway.\n\nAs writer Stephen Glynn presciently remarked, “The spirit of Camelot, shot down in Dallas, Texas, had flown over from Liverpool, England, and the unprecedented euphoria that greeted the group seemed part of an expiation, a nation shaking itself out of its grief and mourning.” There is little question that the Beatles’ timing in the history of the United States was uncanny, as well as a welcome respite from the national malaise, but one cannot overlook the power of marketing in a new media era unlike any that the postwar world had ever seen.\n\nCapitol Records had saturated the city with posters announcing, “The Beatles Are Coming,” while New York’s WMCA and WINS radio stations had given away T-shirts—and, rumor has it, $1 each—to thousands of teenagers who greeted the Beatles that Friday afternoon on the JFK tarmac. Released in December 1963 by Capitol, “I Want to Hold Your Hand” had sold more than one million copies by mid-January, an astounding feat for a group that had been largely unheard of on American shores scarcely a month before.\n\nOn Sunday, February 9, the Beatles launched into a spirited rendition of “All My Loving” to begin their set on the Ed Sullivan Show before some 73 million television viewers, a figure that accounted for nearly 40 percent of the population of the United States at that time. It was popular music’s big bang, and like that incredible instance in the birth of the universe some 13 billion years ago, it is still resonating.\n\nBrian Ritchie, bassist for the folk punk band the Violent Femmes, joins host Kenneth Womack on this episode to chat about his first Beatles records and the 40th anniversary of the Femmes’ debut album.\n\nRitchie co-founded the Violent Femmes with percussionist Victor DeLorenzo in 1981, and the duo were later joined by singer-songwriter Gordon Gano. Ritchie came up with band’s distinctive name on a whim, employing it during their early days playing in Milwaukee’s coffee houses. In August 1981, the Violent Femmes were discovered performing on a street corner in front of the Oriental Theatre by James Honeyman-Scott, the guitarist for the Pretenders, and Chrissie Hynde invited the Femmes to play an acoustic set prior to the Pretenders’ show that night.\n\nIn 1983, the Violent Femmes released their self-titled debut album, which emerged as a key soundtrack for the burgeoning alternative and college-oriented rock movements. The inaugural LP featured many of the band’s best-known songs, including “Blister in the Sun,” “Kiss Off,” “Add It Up,” and “Gone Daddy Gone.” The album became the Femmes’ most successful LP, eventually earning platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nOver the years, the Femmes have recorded 10 studio albums, including Hallowed Ground (1984), The Blind Leading the Naked (1986), and Why Do Birds Sing? (1991). The group is widely considered to be a key influence on the 1980s and 1990s alternative rock scene.\n\nOn this episode, Grammy Award-winning American singer-songwriter and activist Joan Baez joins host Ken Womack to share her memories of meeting the Beatles for the first time and witnessing their final live concert.\n\nBaez's time-eclipsing folk music often champions songs of protest and social justice. Over the years, she has recorded 30 albums in genres ranging from folk rock, pop and country to gospel music. As a performer, Baez has specialized in interpreting the work of other composers, recording songs by such luminaries as the Beatles, Woody Guthrie, Bob Marley, and many others.\n\nBaez began her recording career in 1960, producing a trio of successful LPs in Joan Baez, Joan Baez, Vol. 2 and Joan Baez in Concert. During her early years, Baez was one of Bob Dylan’s first major collaborators, steadfastly working to popularize his impact upon folk music. She was also a featured performer at the 1969 Woodstock Festival, singing fourteen songs on that vaunted stage.\n\nIn addition to her musical career, Baez has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to political and social activism in the areas of nonviolence, civil rights, human rights, and the environment. In 2017, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2023, Baez was the subject of the acclaimed documentary \"I Am A Noise.\"\n\nSophie B. Hawkins, the Grammy-nominated American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and painter, joins host Kenneth Womack on the season five finale episode of “Everything Fab Four.” Hawkins started her Beatles journey as a kid with “Revolver,” and remembers playing along with tennis racket guitars and couch cushion drums. “Even as a non-musician, you can sing basically every part.” In this conversation, she digs deep into the unique ways Beatles fans come together through the music, and how being a Beatles fan pushed her toward excellence in her own songwriting.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City, Hawkins pursued her studies as a percussionist at the Manhattan School of Music before embarking on a music career. She exploded into the international consciousness in 1992 with her debut album “Tongues and Tales.” A massive critical and commercial success, the LP spawned the hit single “Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover.” Her second album, “Whaler,” featured additional hit singles in “Right Beside You” and “As I Lay Me Down.” As an actress, she has portrayed Janis Joplin in the play “Room 105,” while also performing as herself on the NBC TV series “Community,” for which she sang renditions of “Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover” and “As I Lay Me Down.” Her latest album “Free Myself,” on the independent label she founded, Trumpet Swan Productions, features such standout tracks as “Love Yourself” and “Better Off Without You.”\n\nThis week's guests are Margo Precht Speciale and Andrew Solt, who join host Kenneth Womack for a special episode devoted to celebrating the 75th anniversary of The Ed Sullivan Show and its lasting impact on American culture, including Beatles fandom.\n\nThe granddaughter of Ed Sullivan, Precht is a documentary filmmaker, as well as a UCLA graduate with a degree in Sociology. Her latest project traces her grandfather’s life and work as a television pioneer who reigned as the medium’s longtime tastemaker. In particular, Precht’s documentary explores a little-known aspect of Sullivan’s legacy, which involves his radical dedication to diversity that would act as an inflection point for igniting conversations about race in America.\n\nAndrew Solt is an Emmy- and Grammy-winning, producer, director, writer and documentary filmmaker. Over the years, Solt has released a number of documentaries on the history of rock and roll. His collaboration with television documentarian and producer David Wolper included their work together on “Imagine: John Lennon” in 1988. In 1990, Solt purchased the rights to The Ed Sullivan Show library, which consists of 1,087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes that CBS broadcast between 1948 and 1971 on Sunday nights. Included in the archive are over 10,000 live performances by virtually every popular entertainer of the post-war era, highlighted by appearances from Elvis Presley and the Beatles.\n\nOn this episode, the Boxmasters — an American rock band comprised of Grammy Award-winning recording engineer J.D. Andrew and Academy Award-winning actor Billy Bob Thornton — join host Ken Womack for a spirited discussion of songwriting, recording, and what Thornton says is \"the most difficult thing about being a Beatles fan.\"\n\nFormed in 2007, the Boxmasters have recorded a diverse catalog of music that touches on their shared love of the rock and roll of the 1960s. Listening to The Boxmasters, one can hear obvious odes to the Beatles, Byrds and Beach Boys, but also The Mothers of Invention, Kris Kristofferson, John Prine and Big Star.\n\nSince the formation of The Boxmasters, several long-time friends have contributed to the sound of the band, but the core of The Boxmasters has always been Andrew and Thornton. As primary songwriters, the sound of the Boxmasters has been an evolution as the duo constantly strive to find new inspiration, new sounds and new means of expression.\n\nAs a touring band, The Boxmasters have cultivated a rabid fanbase across the United States and Canada. Opening for the likes of ZZ Top, Steve Miller, George Thorogood and Kid Rock, their touring highlights include appearances at Levon Helm’s “Midnight Ramble” in Woodstock, New York, a performance at “Ramble at The Ryman” in 2008, and “The Grand Ole Opry” in 2015. Their 14th and latest album is entitled ’69, with an ensuing tour that includes a stop at Monmouth University’s Pollak Theatre in June 2023.\n\nLegendary singer-songwriter, author, and rock ‘n’ roll star Ian Hunter's illustrious career is now in its seventh decade. His rock ‘n’ roll life has long been marked by collaboration, from the golden age of Mott the Hoople to his fabled partnership with Mick Ronson and 21st-century renaissance with his crack backing combo, the Rant Band. Over the years, Hunter has enjoyed numerous chart successes, especially Mott the Hoople’s international hit “All the Young Dudes,” the David Bowie composition that emerged as a countercultural anthem in the 1970s. Hunter would later recount the trials and tribulations of his life with Mott the Hoople in his autobiography \"Diary of a Rock 'n' Roll Star.\"\n\nDuring his solo career, Hunter’s best known work includes the song \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy\", later covered by Great White, and \"Cleveland Rocks,” (originally “England Rocks”) the popular theme song for \"The Drew Carey Show.\"\n\nWith his latest album DEFIANCE PART 1, Hunter takes creative solidarity to an unprecedented new level with accompaniment from a truly awe-inspiring roster of special guests, famous fans, and lifelong friends. DEFIANCE PART 1 sees backing from luminaries such as Ringo Starr, Jeff Beck, Todd Rundgren, Joe Elliott (of Def Leppard), Guns N’ Roses’ Slash, Jeff Tweedy and – in one of his final recordings – the Foo Fighters’ late, great drummer Taylor Hawkins.\n\nThis episode’s guest is Barbara Feldon, a model, author and actress best known for portraying “Agent 99” on the classic ‘60s sitcom “Get Smart.”\n\nFeldon was born Barbara Anne Hall in a suburb of Pittsburgh and studied drama at Carnegie Mellon University. Soon after, she departed for New York City to pursue a career in acting, where a stint as a showgirl led to her appearance on the game show, “The $64,000 Question,” where she took home the top prize for her knowledge of Shakespeare. The next year, Barbara married Lucien Feldon-Verdeaux, a handsome European she’d been dating, and took “Feldon” as her last name personally and professionally. Working as a fashion model led to a few TV ad spots before landing the one that would make her a household face, lolling about on an animal rug and daring all the male “tigers” out there to try Revlon’s Top Brass hair tonic. That led to securing the plum role of Agent 99 in the spy spoof “Get Smart” opposite comedian Don Adams. The role became Feldon’s biggest break, leading to an Emmy nomination and several film roles to boot. In more recent years, Feldon has written two books: 2003’s “Living Alone and Loving It: A Guide to Relishing the Solo Life” and, in 2022, “Getting Smarter: A Memoir,” which recounts for the first time the true story of her marriage and the many lessons she’s learned since.\n\nOn this episode, host Kenneth Womack welcomes Grammy winner Kenny Loggins, whose songs have left a musical imprint on “the soundtrack of our lives.” Over the last four decades, his chart-topping songs have included “This Is It,” “I’m Alright,” “Footloose,\" “Danger Zone,” and so many more. “Danger Zone” was featured once again in Paramount’s “Top Gun: Maverick,” the biggest theatrical release of 2022, earning over $1.5B in box offices globally. “Danger Zone” earned over 1 million streams per day across streaming services at its peak. On June 14, 2022, Hachette Books published “Still Alright,” Loggins’ long-awaited memoir. In “Still Alright,” Loggins gives fans a candid and entertaining perspective on his life and career as one of the most noteworthy musicians of the 1970s and ’80s. In addition to his string of successful recordings, both solo and as a member of the famed duo Loggins & Messina, Kenny became the first major rock star to dedicate himself to recording music for children and families. His album “Return to Pooh Corner” remains the best-selling children’s album of the last 20 years. His gift for crafting deeply emotional music is unparalleled, and it's been a part of his life as long as he can remember. His generous support of countless local organizations has made a lasting impact on the causes that are close to his heart. And in 2016, he was a recipient of the ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award at the annual Chapin Awards hosted by WhyHunger.\n\nPattie Boyd is an English model, photographer, and an eyewitness to key moments in rock ‘n’ roll history, particularly in terms of the lives and times of the former members of the Beatles, especially George Harrison. In 1962, Boyd began her modeling career, later appearing on the covers of Vogue and other leading magazines. In 1964, she met Harrison while working as an extra on the set of \"A Hard Day’s Night.\" After moving in together at Harrison’s Kinfauns home in Esher, Boyd and Harrison married in January 1966.\n\nBoyd was a regular fixture in the Beatles’ lives, attending the June 1967 Our World live simulcast and joining them in Rishikesh, India, for the group’s February 1968 visit to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi’s ashram. In 1970, Boyd and Harrison relocated to Friar Park, the former Beatle’s enormous Victorian mansion in Henley-on-Thames. By 1973, the Harrisons’ relationship was disintegrating. In 1974, the couple separated, with Boyd later marrying Harrison’s longtime friend and collaborator Eric Clapton, who had nurtured a long-running passion for the model.\n\nOver the years, Harrison had written numerous songs for Boyd, including the top-charting Beatles hit “Something.” In 1970, Boyd was the subject of the legendary Derek and the Dominos’ album \"Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs.\" The album’s title track describes Clapton’s unrequited love for Boyd. Clapton later composed the Top 20 U.S. hit “Wonderful Tonight” with Boyd as his inspiration.\n\nIn 2007, Boyd published her best-selling autobiography entitled \"Wonderful Tonight: George Harrison, Eric Clapton, and Me.\" In 2022, she published her latest book, \"Pattie Boyd: My Life in Pictures.\"\n\nToday’s guest is Hayley Orrantia, an American singer and actress known for her role in the hit TV show \"The Goldbergs.\" The show follows the hilarious and awkward lives of a colorful, suburban family in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania in the 1980s. Orrantia is a scene stealer as Erica, the eldest Goldberg sibling, who fans have watched transform from a socially awkward, nerdy high schooler to popular, college-aged beauty who drops out of school to form a band with her girlfriends. In film, Orrantia most recently starred in Amazon/Lionsgate’s holiday comedy “Christmas is Cancelled” alongside Dermot Mulroney and Janel Parrish.\n\nBorn and raised in Texas, Orrantia discovered her love of performing at nine years old, performing impromptu concerts in her bedroom. Now Orrantia is widely recognized as a successful independent music artist, who draws on inspiration from all genres to create soulful country-pop. In 2018, Orrantia conducted her first headlining tour, the Strong, Sweet and Southern Tour, hitting 22 cities across the United States.\n\nOn this episode of \"Everything Fab Four,\" host Kenneth Womack and Orrantia discuss covering iconic songs like “Maybe I’m Amazed,” her search for authenticity as an artist, working with the late George Segal, and how Lindsay Lohan’s “The Parent Trap” introduced her to the Beatles.\n\nKen Womack's guest this week is Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Darlene Love (born Darlene Wright). Best known for her holiday hit “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home),” in addition to her vocals on records by “girl group” The Crystals and her acting roles such as in the “Lethal Weapon” film series, Love's beginnings were modest, having started out singing in the Los Angeles church choir where her father was the pastor. She began working in 1962 with notorious producer Phil Spector (who’d given her the “Love” surname for recording, and who also worked on several Beatles-related projects). In light of his later troubles, Love explains to Womack, “I will say this: He was not the same guy to me back then that he later came to be.” In this conversation she dives deep into her storied career, opens up about working with Phil Spector, and answers a complex question: Were the Beatles influenced by Black musicians, or did they steal from them?\n\nMay Pang is a former music executive and an eyewitness to key moments in rock ‘n’ roll history, particularly in terms of the lives and times of the former members of the Beatles, especially John Lennon.\n\nAfter growing up in Spanish Harlem and Manhattan, Pang's early jobs included working as an old-school record-plugger and at Allen Klein’s management office, which represented Apple Records and three former Beatles: Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. In December 1970, Pang was invited to assist Lennon and his wife Yoko Ono with their film projects, “Up Your Legs Forever” and “Fly.” Pang was then asked to be Lennon and Ono's secretary in New York and Great Britain, which led to a permanent position as their personal assistant when the Lennons moved from London to New York in 1971. That October, Pang famously coordinated an art exhibition for Ono's This Is Not Here art show at the Everson Museum in Syracuse.\n\nWhen Lennon and Ono separated in 1973, Pang and Lennon began a relationship that lasted more than 18 months. Lennon later referred to this time as his \"Lost Weekend\". In addition to acting as Lennon’s muse, she served as production coordinator for him on such hit LPs as “Rock ‘n’ Roll” and “Walls and Bridges,” which included “Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,” John’s only number-one solo hit during his lifetime.\n\nAfter Lennon returned to Ono in 1975, Pang began working as PR manager for record companies. Pang subsequently authored two books about her relationship with Lennon—a memoir entitled “Loving John” (in 1983) and a book of photographs, “Instamatic Karma” (in 2008). She was recently the subject of a critically acclaimed documentary, “The Lost Weekend: A Love Story,” which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival this past June.\n\nGerman artist, musician and record producer Klaus Voormann, former bassist for Manfred Mann, has played on a number of iconic recordings, from Carly Simon's \"You're So Vain\" to Lou Reed's \"Transformer\" album, and with many projects of the former members of the Beatles, whom Voorman has known since their Hamburg days. The one-time London roommate of George Harrison and Ringo Starr won a Grammy for designing the cover of their 1966 album \"Revolver,\" which has just been reissued in a deluxe remastered box set. In 2009, Voormann released his debut solo album \"A Sideman's Journey,\" which featured the two surviving Beatles, McCartney and Starr, performing as \"Voormann and Friends.\" His latest work involves the composition of the graphic novel \"Birth of an Icon, which details his efforts behind the creation of the \"Revolver\" cover art. In this bonus episode of \"Everything Fab Four,\" Voorman — on the phone all the way from Germany — and host Ken Womack discuss the evolution of the Beatles' songwriting, everyone's favorite Mal Evans, and of course, how he created the \"Revolver\" cover.\n\nA note to our listeners: Technical difficulties resulted in audio that's less clear for this episode, but we hope you'll stick around for Klaus' fascinating eyewitness accounts of working with the Beatles.\n\nThis week's guest is celebrated English guitarist, singer, and songwriter Peter Frampton. A musical prodigy, Frampton taught himself to play the guitar at age 7. Within the next few years, he mastered complex jazz, blues and rock riffs. He spent his pre-teen years performing with bands including George & The Dragons, a group that included fellow up-and-coming musician David Bowie. Eventually, Frampton caught the attention of the Rolling Stones’ Bill Wyman, and in 1967, under his mentorship, Frampton became the lead guitarist and singer for the pop group The Herd. In 1969, after achieving the adoration of teenaged fans with hit singles like \"From the Underworld\" and \"I Don't Want Our Loving to Die,\" and after a stint with the blues-based rock band Humble Pie, Frampton decided to strike out on his own.\n\nThe popularity of his first three solo albums coupled with Frampton's captivating live performances culminated in the 1976 live double recording Frampton Comes Alive!, which sold more than 10 million copies. The LP held the notable distinction of being the best-selling live rock album in history, while the singles \"Baby I Love Your Way,\" \"Do You Feel Like I Do?\" and \"Show Me the Way\" dominated the American charts. Considered the crowning achievement of Frampton's career, the album influenced both Billboard and Rolling Stone magazines to name him Artist of the Year.\n\nOn this episode of Everything Fab Four, host Kenneth Womack and Frampton talk about his watershed live album, John Lennon's legendary Rickenbacker and “Son of Dracula,” hearing an early “Sgt. Pepper’s” copy that had “fallen off the back of a truck,” and how Frampton came to play lead guitar to George Harrison’s rhythm on “Doris Troy.\"\n\nAmerican filmmaker Ken Burns is renowned for his documentary films and television series, many of which chronicle American history and culture, such as \"The Civil War,\" \"Baseball,\" \"Jazz,\" and \"Country Music.\" Burns's documentaries have earned two Academy Award nominations and have won several Emmy Awards, among other honors. His latest documentary is \"The U.S. and the Holocaust,\" which premieres this month and was produced with longtime collaborators Lynn Novick and Sarah Botstein. But before that, he worked at a record store where the best-selling album of his tenure was “Abbey Road.” He still thinks about the Beatles every day. In this conversation with our host Kenneth Womack, Burns discusses what his creative process shares with the Beatles’ and reveals the secret ingredient that he believes has made the band’s catalog so timeless. And he makes the case for a significant portion of the top 10 “quintessential” Beatles’ songs aren’t written by Paul or John.\n\nIn this episode, host Ken Womack and powerhouse rocker Ann Wilson go deep into Beatles songs and their influence on her own work, the high school politics of fandom, and what the Beatles taught her about gender as a young rocker. Wilson rose to fame alongside her younger sister, guitarist Nancy Wilson, as lead vocalist in the rock band Heart, the first hard rock group fronted by women. In their heyday, Heart released numerous albums throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Dreamboat Annie\" and \"Little Queen,\" and \"Dog and Butterfly,\" which generated hit singles such as \"Magic Man,\" \"Crazy on You,\" \"Barracuda,\" “Straight On” and “Dog and Butterfly.” The band later enjoyed commercial success with a trio of albums, including the self-titled \"Heart,\" \"Bad Animals\" and \"Brigade,\" along with a raft of hits such as “What about Love,” “Never,” “These Dreams,” “Nothin’ At All,” “Who Will You Run To,” “Alone,” and “All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You.” To date, Heart has sold over 35 million records. Over the years, Wilson has earned her place as one of rock’s most vaunted singers. Known for her operatic abilities and banshee screams, she was ranked no. 78 in Hit Parader's 2006 list of Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time. And in 2013, she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Heart.\n\nKenneth Womack's guest on this episode of “Everything Fab Four” is English singer/songwriter Dave Mason, who first found fame and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for his work with the rock band Traffic. He wrote and sang lead on Traffic’s 1968 single “Feelin Alright?” which also went on to become a hit for Joe Cocker and throughout the years has been covered by a wide range of artists, from the Jackson 5 to Widespread Panic. Over the course of his legendary career, Mason has played and recorded with many notable musicians, including Paul McCartney and George Harrison, and on Jimi Hendrix's version of “All Along the Watchtower.” In this conversation, Mason talks about being a young musician in London when the Beatles hit, listening to “Sgt. Pepper” at George Harrison's house, what it was like playing with Jimi, and more.\n\nEthan Russell is one of rock’s most influential photographers — and the only one to shoot album covers for the Beatles, The Who and The Rolling Stones, whose work he also chronicled as the band’s primary photographer from 1968-72, including their ill-fated Altamont show. Pete Townshend once called him “the civilized eye of an uncivilized art form — rock and roll.” Through his camera, Russell has had a front-row seat to many of rock’s great historical moments, including shooting the Beatles’ “Let It Be” cover and the band’s final photo session. But his life could have gone in an entirely different direction. “If Cambridge had accepted me, I never would have done the cover for ‘Let It Be,’” Russell tells our host, Ken Womack during their wide-ranging conversation about his career and experiences in documenting so many iconic moments in rock.\n\nWhen Sananda Maitreya first heard the Beatles, he felt a spiritual awakening. The son of gospel singer Frances Howard wasn’t allowed to listen to music that wasn’t gospel until he was 15 years old, but the Beatles were so ubiquitous, he says, that they couldn’t be contained. When he first heard “She Loves You,” the American singer/songwriter (formerly known under the stage name Terence Trent D’Arby) who catapulted to fame with the number 1 hit “Wishing Well,” says the sound and look of the Beatles were “so alien and yet so familiar at the same time that it was utterly captivating. Growing up in predominately Black culture at that particular time, the way the music seemed to fit so perfectly into the culture … It just felt like something ordained by God.”\n\nAs a young man, Maitreya trained as a boxer, served in the U.S. Army where he was stationed in West Germany and worked as a band leader. Then in 1987 he released his debut solo record, “Introducing the Hardline,” which netted him a Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance. His twelfth studio album, “Pandora’s Playhouse,” is out now.\n\nOn this episode of Everything Fab Four, Maitreya and host Ken Womack talk about all things Beatles, from Ringo’s drumming to the birth of a white blues with “Hard’s Day Night.” Maitreya also takes a deep dive into his spiritual connections to John Lennon and Prince, and tells Ken the story of the time he and George Harrison had a mystical experience together.\n\nRock and Roll Hall of Famer Nancy Wilson rose to fame as the guitarist of Heart, the first hard rock band fronted by women. With hits like “Magic Man” and “Crazy On You” to “These Dreams” and “What About Love?” Wilson and her sister Ann, Heart’s lead singer, sold more than 35 million records and along the way, changed perceptions of who can lead a hard rock band. In this episode, Nancy and host Ken Womack talk about the early days of Heart, the songwriting craft behind some of their most iconic tracks, her recent tribute to Eddie Van Halen, and how the Beatles inspired her to pick up a guitar — “We weren’t looking to marry them or date them, we wanted to be them” — sparking the passion for rock and roll that would carry her through her storied career."
