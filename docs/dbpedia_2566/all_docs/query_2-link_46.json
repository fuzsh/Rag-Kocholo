On several occasions, while the \"real\" Doctor was absent or incapacitated, she assumed the mantle, promise and name of \"the Doctor\", with the Twelfth Doctor acknowledging on one of these occasions that she \"made a mighty fine Doctor\".\n\nAccording to the Doctor, she was \"impossible\" due to their meetings previously in his personal timeline, with two such encounters where he saw her die. Though assured by the empathic psychic Emma Grayling and the TARDIS scanner that Clara was just an \"ordinary girl\", the Doctor couldn't believe that to be true and thought her to be \"the only mystery worth solving\".\n\nWhile a physically ordinary human woman from the 21st century, Clara chose to enter the Doctor's timeline in his tomb on Trenzalore in order to try to reverse the damage done to his timeline by the Great Intelligence. This caused the time winds to shatter her into millions of what River Song referred to as \"echoes\" or \"splinters\" that were dispersed throughout his personal timeline. These echoes corrected the damage caused by the Great Intelligence but were not the original Clara. She was trapped in the Doctor's time stream but rescued shortly thereafter.\n\nAfter Trenzalore, Clara became a school teacher, though she still travelled with the Doctor, meeting the Doctor's War and Tenth incarnations. She was with him when he regenerated into his twelfth incarnation, having encouraged the Time Lords to grant him a new regenerative cycle and continued to travel with him thereafter.\n\nClara later met and fell in love with fellow schoolteacher Danny Pink. However, she lied to him about giving her travels with the Doctor; only to lose him to a car accident, and again to Missy despite her best efforts to bring him back.\n\nAfter the loss of Danny, Clara became less attached to Earth and began to copy the heroic aspects of the Doctor's persona; this caused her to become increasingly reckless, as she believed he would always have a plan.\n\nClara's heroics eventually cost her greatly. While trying to prove Rigsy's innocence of a false murder accusation she took a Chronolock, which killed the one branded, from him. The Raven, who was originally set to kill Rigsy, killed her instead. She was later extracted from her own fixed point of death in her timeline by the Doctor using an extraction chamber on Gallifrey. In her resurrected form, Clara had none of the usual aspects of the living, such as breathing, having a pulse or even ageing, instead being stuck \"between one heartbeat and the next\".\n\nThe Doctor then stole a TARDIS and escaped Gallifrey, travelling to the end of the universe in an attempt to fully bring Clara back, proving to be ineffective, however. The Doctor planned to wipe Clara's memory of ever travelling with him, yet instead, in a turn of events, the Doctor lost his memories of Clara. She then left in the other TARDIS, planning to use it to travel \"the long way round\" back to Gallifrey, with Ashildr and Willa Twiston for company.\n\nBiography[]\n\nChildhood[]\n\nClara was born in Blackpool (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) on 23 November (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) 1986 (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) to Dave and Ellie Oswald. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She liked to receive travel books and science kits for Christmas rather than hair products (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).) and loved attending Sunday school, which was taught by a \"nice lady teacher\" in a small church room that smelt of oak polish and had felt-tip colouring on the walls. (PROSE: Into the Nowhere [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Ellie told her not to speak to strange men, advice which she ignored. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).)\n\nAs a child, Clara visited many National Trust houses (AUDIO: The House of Winter [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and went to the Blackpool Tower circus with her grandmother. (PROSE: All the Empty Towers [+]Jenny T. Colgan, The Scientific Secrets of Doctor Who (2015).) Her role model was Amy Johnson, whom she learnt about at school, (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and she always wanted to meet Robin Hood. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) She was once stung by a wasp. (PROSE: The Crawling Terror [+]Mike Tucker, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2014).) She met the Eleventh Doctor when she accidentally kicked a football at his head in a park whilst she was with her parents, after which Dave remarked that she wanted to be Bryan Robson. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara often lost things, including her \"best pencil\", her school bag, her grandmother and her mojo, which she managed to get back. Whenever she lost something, she would go to a quiet place, close her eyes and remember where she left it. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) Her worst fear was getting lost herself and she had a number of nightmares about it. On a bank holiday Monday when she was about six, she got lost on Blackpool Beach and was eventually found by her mother. They then went for fish and chips and returned home where Ellie told Clara that she would always find her. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara met the Eleventh Doctor a second time, earlier in his timeline, in a park and advised him to go somewhere quiet to think about how to find his lost friend instead of waiting for destiny, both of them being unaware that it was her that he was looking for. (WC: The Bells of Saint John: A Prequel [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who episode prequels series 7 (BBC, 2013).) He followed her advice. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nDave took Clara to a restaurant with a glass floor at the top of a tower block near Southport when she was nine. Although he assured her that the floor was \"safe as houses\", she was scared when two boys started jumping up and down on the glass, swearing and shouting that they were going to break it, and she remained nervous about heights and glass floors afterwards. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She also stopped believing in Santa Claus at the same age, later explaining that she was growing out of fairy tales. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nEllie read to Clara from her copy of 101 Places to See. When Clara was nine, she wrote her own name inside the book and updated it with her age over the years. Inside of it was kept the leaf that blew into Dave's face on the day that he and Ellie met, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) which she would later refer to as \"page 1\". (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara attended St Mary's School and played on the rugby team. (COMIC: Unearthly Things [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In 2001, at the age of fourteen, she let the leaf blow away in the wind in frustration after her mother told her she could not stay over a friend's following a Halloween party. She met the Doctor again at the party and they briefly ventured to an alien forest where a wolf guided her to the leaf before they returned to Earth. Having been aiming for Clara during her time as his companion, the Doctor wiped her memory of the adventure to preserve the timeline. (PROSE: Clara Oswald and the Enchanted Forest [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nYoung adulthood[]\n\nClara passed her driving test on her first try. (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) She was able to ride a motorcycle. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special (BBC One, 2013).) Although she was not always successful, she enjoyed making soufflés and followed the recipe used by her mother, who told her that the soufflé was the recipe rather than the soufflé itself. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nOn 5 March 2005, Ellie died. Taking 101 Places to See with her, Clara visited Ellie's grave with her father, unaware that the Eleventh Doctor was watching her from a distance. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She was angry following her mother's death. (AUDIO: The Gods of Winter [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She wore her mother's ring, which was precious to her, (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) and remembered her as a great woman. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) She went on to graduate from university. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara was among the billions of people across the world who briefly became part of the Master Race circa the 2000s.[nb 1] (PROSE: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, adapted from The Day of the Doctor (Steven Moffat), Target novelisations (Target Books, 2018).) She once found a second-hand book in a shop with a dedication reading, \"There's no larger responsibility than great potential\", a phrase which stuck with her and made her want to look after children. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nIn 2012, Clara planned to go travelling and went to stay with family friends George Maitland and his wife for a week before she departed. George's wife died during her stay and she decided to halt her plans to travel in favour of helping George by becoming Angie and Artie's nanny, (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) inspired by the phrase she read in the second-hand book. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She told George that she would help for as long as she was needed and intended on going travelling once that was no longer the case. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nMeeting the Doctor[]\n\nClara had a poor knowledge of the internet. While attempting to log on to the Wi-Fi in the Maitland home, she used a mnemonic device, \"Run you clever boy and remember\", to help her recall the Wi-Fi password, rycbar123. She phoned a number for technical support, given to her by a woman in a shop, that reached the Eleventh Doctor in the year 1207. Perplexed, she believed that he was on a helpline, and so she requested that he go to her to help her figure out how to use the Internet.\n\nHe attempted to assist her, but Clara clicked on the Wi-Fi connection being used by the Great Intelligence to harvest human minds. A Spoonhead, adopting the guise of a character from Summer Falls, a novel she read, uploaded her to the data cloud. The process was incomplete when the Doctor found her, allowing him to restore her. Clara found that her technical knowledge was greatly enhanced as a result of this.\n\nShe used this new skill to hack the Great Intelligence's operatives, choosing \"Oswin\" as a username. She discovered their location in the Shard, before she was downloaded again by a Spoonhead, this time successfully. The Doctor had the entire cloud downloaded back where possible, restoring Clara once more. He invited her to come with him and she told him to return the next day and ask again. (TV: The Bells of Saint John [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nTravels with the Eleventh Doctor[]\n\nEarly trips[]\n\nWhen the Doctor returned for her, Clara was waiting eagerly. She rushed to meet the TARDIS outside the moment the Doctor knocked on her door. When the Doctor asked her where she wanted to go, she was stuck at first. She quickly recovered, replying \"somewhere awesome\". He took her to the Festival of Offerings near Akhaten.\n\nThere, they explored the markets and watched the festival. When Merry Gejelh, whom Clara had comforted and encouraged to sing the Long Song at the Festival, was taken by the Mummy, Clara and the Doctor saved her. In doing so, Clara had to give up her mother's ring, which had extreme sentimental value to her. To destroy Akhaten, she was forced to sacrifice something even more precious: the leaf that brought her parents together, \"the most important leaf in human history\". After saving everyone on the planet, they thanked her by returning her ring. After the trip, the Doctor dropped her back off at her house in London, which she remarked looked different. (TV: The Rings of Akhaten [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor later took her on another trip, but instead of landing in Las Vegas as planned, they landed on the Firebird, a Soviet submarine at the North Pole in 1983. While the Doctor brought the sinking submarine to safety, the TARDIS activated its Hostile Action Displacement System and it dematerialised, leaving the Doctor and Clara on the submarine.\n\nThey quickly found that the Ice Warrior Grand Marshall, Skaldak, had been brought on board. The Doctor attempted to convince the submarine's crew to be peaceful to him, but Lieutenant Stepashin stunned Skaldak with a cattle prod. The Doctor ordered the crew to imprison Skaldak; Clara was sent to try and talk some sense into him, under the Doctor's guidance, but discovered Skaldak had managed to escape his capture and threatened to launch the submarine's nuclear missiles. The Doctor and Clara managed to make him hesitate his decision, and Skaldak and the submarine were rescued by an Ice Warrior ship. Skaldak left and remotely disarmed the submarine. The Doctor then confessed to setting the HADS, and found that it had sent the TARDIS to the South Pole; he had to ask the submarine captain for a lift, much to Clara's amusement. (TV: Cold War [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAt some point, Clara went to Baghdad in 1930 with the Doctor, where she met and befriended Amy Johnson. After an adventure, Clara bade a sad farewell to Amy, knowing that she wouldn't see Amy again until Amy's death. She soon found a loophole in that her body was never found and, thus, as Amy was drowning a few years later, the TARDIS materialised around her. The Doctor and Clara took Amy to Cornucopia. (COMIC: A Wing and a Prayer [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLater, the Doctor took Clara to Caliburn House, the home of Major Alec Palmer, which was thought to have been haunted by the \"Witch of the Well\" for many years. Unknown to Clara, he took her there to speak to the psychic Emma Grayling and find out what Clara was. The Doctor took lots of photographs of the ghost throughout Earth's timeline. The Doctor used his photographs to explain that the \"ghost\" was, in fact, a time traveller from the future called Hila Tacorien, who was trapped in a pocket universe and being chased by the Crooked Man. The Doctor used a crystal from Metebelis III to make Emma open up the portal to the pocket universe. Whilst there he saved Hila but got trapped himself; Clara argued with the TARDIS voice interface when the TARDIS would not let her in, Clara wanting to use the TARDIS to save the Doctor while the TARDIS was concerned for its own safety.\n\nLater, after revealing that Hila was a distant relative of Alec and Emma, the Doctor realised that the \"Crooked Man\" in the pocket universe was trying to get to another creature in the house, so he and Clara went back to pick it up. (TV: Hide [+]Neil Cross, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nWhile the Doctor was out, the TARDIS demonstrated her antagonism toward Clara by deleting her bedroom and creating a holographic leopard while she was in the bathroom. It also created multiple versions of Clara simply to annoy her. (HOMEVID: Clara and the TARDIS [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) After this, he and Clara made an arrangement: he would pick her up every Wednesday and they would have adventures, but unlike his previous companions, she wouldn't travel aboard the TARDIS on a permanent basis as she had responsibilities on Earth of being a nanny. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nTimelines in the TARDIS[]\n\nWhile trying to teach Clara how to operate the TARDIS, the time machine was caught in a magnetic hobble-field from a space salvage ship, operated by the Van Baalen Bros. A future version of the Doctor arrived through a time rift, throwing his present self a magno-grab remote with \"BIG FRIENDLY BUTTON\" branded into it to stop the ship's magno-grab. After the Doctor pressed the button, the TARDIS disappeared, escaping the Van Baalens and preventing its engine failure. The Doctor said aloud to Clara that two days had been compressed into the space of one. The Doctor asked Clara if she felt safe travelling with him, and after a long conversation, she admitted that she did.\n\nIn an alternate timeline, however, the TARDIS was successfully captured by the Van Baalen Bros., causing the TARDIS to leak the past and future. In the confusion, the Doctor made it out of the TARDIS, while Clara ended up lost inside, her hand burnt by the scorching metal of a magno-grab remote that had mysteriously appeared in the TARDIS and rolled towards her shortly before she was separated from the Doctor. Inside, she travelled through the TARDIS' rooms, running away from a time zombie threatening to harm her. She eventually arrived in the TARDIS library and hid there. She read a book called The History of the Time War, and found out the Doctor's true name.\n\nShe kept travelling inside the TARDIS, eventually arriving in an echo of the control room. She was pulled through to another echo room and reunited with the Doctor, meeting Bram and Tricky Van Baalen. The Doctor switched off the countdown to the TARDIS's non-existent self-destruct sequence but realised that the magno-grab had caused the engine to start malfunctioning. On the way to the \"centre of the TARDIS\", the four kept running from the time zombies and reached the Cloister Room, where they found out what the time zombies really were: them. The Doctor managed to trick the time zombies and make them fall to their deaths inside the Eye of Harmony. The Doctor and Clara ran to the heart of the TARDIS. There, the Doctor told Clara about her uniqueness, and about her multiple lives and deaths.\n\nThe Doctor found that the burn marks on Clara's hand had formed words: \"BIG FRIENDLY BUTTON\". The Doctor then realised they needed to go back to the point of the disaster and activate the magno-grab remote, which had caused the burn marks on Clara's hand before, to stop the field and prevent the disaster. The Doctor passed through a time rift to give the device to his past self, who successfully activated it, undoing the damage to the engine and making Clara forget about the Doctor's name. The Doctor did not want Clara to go searching for his name, because an important secret was connected to it. (TV: Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) This adventure, although negated, was later recalled by Clara when the TARDIS leaked time energy. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nContinued adventures[]\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travelled to 1893 Yorkshire and reached a new little town, Sweetville, run by Winifred Gillyflower and her mysterious partner. While investigating the town, the two were taken by Gillyflower's guards into a creepy dungeon, where they were lowered down into a strange red liquid — known locally as \"the Crimson Horror\". Clara was successfully preserved by the matter and was placed with another survivor into a glass dome in one of the Sweetville houses, awaiting the next part of Mrs Gillyflower's insane plan. After Jenny Flint rescued the Doctor from being held by Ada Gillyflower in an almost catatonic condition, they eventually found Clara. The Doctor broke the glass, took Clara out and pulled her out of her \"puppet\" condition. Clara, the Doctor and Jenny set off to finally defeat Mrs Gillyflower in a tower in the town; Gillyflower, along with her mysterious partner — the repulsive red leech, Mr Sweet — planned to fire a rocket that would spread the \"Crimson Horror\" all around the world, wiping humanity out except for those preserved by being lowered into the liquid. Clara broke a chair on Mrs Gillyflower's control console preventing her from triggering the rocket. After the Crimson Horror was safely removed from the rocket, Mrs Gillyflower threatened to kill the Doctor and Clara anyway. She was shot by Strax and fell to the ground, suffering fatal injuries. Mrs Gillyflower died and Mr Sweet was also killed by Mrs Gillyflower's daughter, Ada.\n\nThe Doctor brought Clara back to the 21st century to the Maitland family house. Angie and Artie, the children she looked after, found photos from her adventures with the Doctor on her laptop and found out that she was a time traveller. When going through the photos, Clara saw one of her past lives, Clara Oswald, in Victorian London. Realising that both her physical appearance and where the picture took place in was different, Clara began to suspect something wasn't right. Before she could process the thought entirely, the kids begged her to take them to an adventure, or else they would tell their father that their nanny was a time traveller. Clara, lacking any other choice, agreed. (TV: The Crimson Horror [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor took Clara, Artie and Angie to the abandoned theme park, Hedgewick's World of Wonders, where Angie and Artie were taken by weapons-grade Cybermen, who had been reawakened from their tombs after being presumed long-extinct. The Doctor put Clara in charge of the punishment platoon to fight the Cybermen and began a game of chess to end the stalemate over his mind with the Cyber-Planner, Mr Clever.\n\nThe Doctor released the children in exchange for one of his chess pieces and pulled in the \"local resources\" to stop the Cybermen. The missing Emperor, Ludens Nimrod Kendrick Cord Longstaff XLI, revealed himself as having been their short-statured friend Porridge and activated the planet-destroying bomb. This summoned his spaceship, transmatting the humans on Hedgewick's World to safety while the Cybermen were left behind on Hedgewick's World. Porridge proposed to Clara, but she declined. The Doctor returned Clara, Angie and Artie home. (TV: Nightmare in Silver [+]Neil Gaiman, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nClara visited Tickle Town with the Doctor and was trapped in a roller coaster. She eventually escaped in the TARDIS. (COMIC: Welcome to Tickle Town [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTogether, they met the King of Bones, (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and visited the avocado seas of Venofax, where they visited an archaeological dig. While the Doctor enjoyed himself, Clara quickly got bored and pressed some buttons on the archaeologists' equipment, accidentally turning off the barrier keeping the site from being flooded by the avocado seas. Nobody got hurt, but the entire expedition was ruined and everyone got wet.\n\nAfter leaving Venofax, Clara changed into dry clothes in the TARDIS. When she came out, the Doctor had landed in Dallas in 1963. Clara and the Doctor discovered a parasite called the Shroud which was feeding off of the grief of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. After allying with some clowns from the planet Semtis, the Doctor took the Shroud to Venofax and trapped it there. (PROSE: Shroud of Sorrow [+]Tommy Donbavand, BBC New Series Adventures (BBC Books, 2013).)\n\nSometime later, whilst at home with Angie and Artie, Clara received a letter from Vastra laced with a soporific that took her into a \"conference call\". There, she learnt that the murderer Clarence DeMarco had said \"The Doctor has a secret, you know. He has one he will take to the grave. And it is discovered,\" and showed Vastra the co-ordinates to where the Doctor's tomb was. The call was interrupted by the Whisper Men attempting to murder Jenny. River woke up Vastra and Strax, and the Great Intelligence appeared, using the face of Walter Simeon, to tell Clara that to save his friends, the Doctor had to come to Trenzalore - the place of his grave. When she woke up from the conference, River stayed connected. Using the telepathic circuits to get the co-ordinates, the Doctor and Clara went to Trenzalore, crossing the Doctor's timeline. The Great Intelligence was waiting there and wished to enter the tomb of the Doctor, a future, decaying version of the TARDIS.\n\nEntering the decaying TARDIS through a hidden passageway, Clara began to remember the events of a deleted timeline, in which the Doctor told her about her multiple lives, causing her to panic slightly. They eventually made their way to the Doctor's tomb, where the Great Intelligence demanded the Doctor tell him his true name. When he refused, River uttered it, and the door opened. Inside the tomb, the Intelligence entered the Doctor's timeline, rewriting his history, changing all his victories into losses. The universe began decaying, all the people and civilisations saved by the Doctor now destroyed. With no other choice, Clara did what she was meant to do; saying, \"Run. Run you clever boy, and remember me\", she walked into the timeline as well, scattering herself across time and space. This action projected her across time, creating many other versions of her that saved the Doctor time and time again, (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).) ultimately weakening the Great Intelligence so much that it was forced to jump to the Brigadier's time stream instead where Clara couldn't follow it. (PROSE: The Forgotten Son [+]Andy Frankham-Allen, Lethbridge-Stewart novels (Candy Jar Books, 2015).) Meanwhile, the Eleventh Doctor decided to jump into the timeline as well in order to save her. Hearing the Doctor's comforting voice, she approached him. As they were just about to leave, Clara noticed an incarnation of the Doctor that she'd never met. This version was the only one to break the promise of the name \"the Doctor\". However, the stress of the experience caused Clara to faint, so she didn't find out anything more about this incarnation. Clara and the Eleventh Doctor then departed, with the mysterious Doctor watching them leave. (TV: The Name of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 7 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nAfter she escaped the Doctor's timeline, Clara could only remember bits and pieces of her echoes' lives. Some memories were more vivid, others she only recalled as dreams. (PROSE: Into the Nowhere [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nHanging out into space from the TARDIS, Clara and the Doctor found a Tonnchenform, similar to Earth tardigrades. The Doctor told Clara that because the space between galaxies was so big, they were rarely seen, but each of the billions of macroscopic creatures out there were beautiful and unique, just like the trillions of microscopic ones on Earth. Soon after, they went on an adventure involving a dinner with alien robots, a small jewel-encrusted seashell stolen by Bozzi the Mysterio, and a chase across the snowscapes of Halas Four. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAfter the two had ended the Frogman civil war, they were assaulted by Adam Mitchell who abducted Clara and placed her, along with all of the Doctor's other companions, in a suspended animation chamber. (COMIC: The Choice [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).) The companions were soon freed by Frobisher to fight off the Tremas Master's Auton army, with the Doctor delighting in introducing Clara to Amy Pond and Rory Williams before Adam sacrificed himself to thwart the Master's plan. Along with the other companions, Clara attended Adam's funeral before she and the Doctor resumed their travels. (COMIC: Endgame [+]Scott & David Tipton, Prisoners of Time (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAs a result of an accident caused by his fiddling with the TARDIS' telepathic circuits, the Doctor was left with the majority of his vast memory wiped as he and Clara were preparing to go on holiday. Using the Twelve Hundred Year Diary, Clara helped him remember his life. The Doctor lamented that it was easier not remembering the people he had lost over the years, but Clara reassured him that he was a man who never ran from danger and had helped save billions of lives. Cheered up, the Doctor put the TARDIS into flight as they proceeded to their holiday. (TV: The History of the Doctor [+]Gareth Roberts, Doctor Who (BBC Three|BBC Three]], 2013).)\n\nOne day, Clara awoke in a darkened and abandoned TARDIS, discovering herself to be in a spatial loop. Finding a button with a note that read \"Do Not Touch\", Clara decided that it was reverse psychology and pressed it, plummeting into a white void where she was rescued by the Sky Jack and taken to Tipperary Station, a meeting point of several alien scavengers, where she reunited with the Doctor, who had been there for three years from his perspective. As the two conversed, the Doctor came to the realisation that they were still in the TARDIS, within an old console room whose preparations had been comically exaggerated. Arriving at the console, the Doctor explained that this was the machinations of \"the Hypothetical Gentelman\", a disembodied entity that resided within the TARDIS' Matrix that the Doctor presumed to be a digital copy of a Time Lord tyrant, only for the being to reveal that it was the Matrix. After the Matrix explained how it became sentient, Clara, knowing that the Doctor was telepathically linked to the Matrix, took the initiative and stowed away on its craft, sabotaging it before the Matrix could cross the wormhole into the wider universe. The delay was enough for the Doctor to reset the TARDIS and trap the Matrix in a never ending wormhole. After the aliens had all been returned home, Clara and the Doctor joined the crew of the Sky Jack at VJ Day in the Hawaii. (COMIC: Sky Jacks [+]Andy Diggle and Eddie Robson, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nThe Doctor later took Clara to Deadwood in 1882 where they crossed paths with Oscar Wilde and ran afoul of the Doctor's old foe Es'Cartrss who had put Earth on trial. As Clara worked with Calamity Jane, they discovered that Wild Bill Hickok and many others were being resurrected. After thwarting this scheme, the two went off to Shoreditch. (COMIC: Dead Man's Hand [+]Tony Lee, Doctor Who (2012) (IDW Publishing, 2013).)\n\nAfter a particularly stressful day of nannying, the Doctor took Clara to Cui Palta to relax only for both to fall victim to the psychic pollen of the local flowers, hallucinating an elaborate maze before Clara deduced the truth. Despite the danger, Clara was left exhilarated by the experience. (PROSE: Clara and the Maze of Cui Palta [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nBecoming a teacher[]\n\nClara studied to become a teacher whilst living with the Maitlands (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and met and befriended Christel Dean, another aspiring teacher. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).) Her travels with the Doctor got in the way of her studies, but she managed to qualify (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and remained in contact with Christel afterwards. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nClara was offered a job at Coal Hill School as an English teacher and accepted it as George Maitland was dealing with Angie and Artie well enough on his own. As she was newly-qualified, she accepted that there could be some truth in Angie and Artie's teasing remarks about the Doctor having been behind her getting the job, but she chose to believe that it was at least partly on her own merit. When she started at the school, she asked the Doctor to leave her to live a normal life for a while. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nOn Clara's first day, she lost control of the class and threatened to have them all expelled, but Courtney Woods called her bluff by telling her to go through with it. This made her realise that she should never start with her final sanction. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) Although Courtney challenged her more often than any of the other students, Clara found it hard to stay made at her because of her apparent lack of any real malice. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) She befriended colleague Adrian Davies, (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) whom she once had a confusing conversation with about South American authors (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) and whom she did not consider to be her type despite his resemblance to the Doctor. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nIn one particular lesson, Clara decided to switch things up, declaring that \"normal is overrated\", and brought her English class outside to teach them about tardigrades in an attempt to give them a glimpse into the wonders of the universe. Once they got settled on the grass, she instructed them to look up at the sky for ten seconds, then to shut their eyes, count to five, open them again and tell her what they saw. (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) At some point, she took tae kwon do lessons with the Year Sevens after school. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nLast trips together[]\n\nAfter more than six weeks, (PROSE: Normality [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) the Doctor contacted Coal Hill with the address of where he had landed the TARDIS and she rendezvoused with him. The TARDIS was airlifted by UNIT to the National Gallery where Clara met Kate Stewart and consoled the Doctor when he was reminded of the Last Great Time War. She travelled with a Zygon impersonating Kate Stewart to the Black Archive unaware that the scientific leader of UNIT was being impersonated. Using the code scraped into the wall of the Tower of London, Clara activated Captain Jack Harkness' vortex manipulator and escaped the menacing Zygons by travelling to 1562. There, she met the War Doctor, Tenth Doctor and Queen Elizabeth I and attended the wedding of the latter two.\n\nShe was inserted into the Gallifreyan stasis cube Gallifrey Falls No More with the Doctors to surreptitiously re-enter the Black Archive in the 21st century. When the War Doctor left for his own time to activate the Moment, Clara told the two remaining Doctors that she could see in his eyes that the ending of the Time War was still in the earlier incarnation's future. She travelled through the Time Lock with the Doctors and begged them to reconsider when they decided to cause the genocide together. They took this advice to heart. She was therefore present when the Doctor changed history as he remembered it, and saved Gallifrey instead of destroying it. Back on Earth, she briefly met the mysterious Curator, unaware that anything was extraordinary about him. She bade farewell to the past Doctors, and kissed her Doctor on the cheek; when the Doctor asked how she knew he needed time alone with the painting, she told him, \"I always know.\" Clara visited the Black Archive twice, but only had a memory of visiting once. As a result of the visit that she did not remember, she already had security access during the visit she did remember. (TV: The Day of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nOn her travels with the Doctor, Clara was attacked by a mind parasite that was dubbed Waites. Waites caused Clara to live a horrible life where she lost her job and all her money but she retained enough awareness to seek out the Doctor, who called himself \"John Smith\" within the shared dream, only for him to turn her away. Eventually Clara managed to shatter the illusion, seconds after the Doctor, whereupon she physically attacked the parasite for the hell it had subjected her to before she and the Doctor ripped its avatars off its other victims, killing it. As the two walked away, the Doctor theorised that Clara's self awareness was the result of her having lived multiple lives. Clara smiled that the lack of Doctor was probably what had tipped her off that something was amiss. (COMIC: John Smith and the Common Men [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara visited the Obsidian Mainframe and attended the auction for various creatures. She was with the Doctor when the TARDIS was sold, and the Doctor gained a lot of money. They were then forced to travel \"the normal way\" to the Cornucopia's airport, where Amy Johnson lived. (COMIC: Pay the Piper [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW., The Blood of Azrael [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nTrenzalore[]\n\nNeeding a fake boyfriend as she cooked Christmas dinner for her family, Clara called the Doctor twice while he was orbiting a planet surrounded by the universe's most dangerous enemies. She convinced him to come but was shocked to find him naked, which he fixed for her by putting a holographic filter on her. Clara introduced him to her family, who saw him naked because he hadn't put the filter on them. Learning from Handles that the planet was apparently Gallifrey, Clara and the Doctor travelled there. When the Papal Mainframe arrived, the Doctor made Clara swallow a holographic projector to generate holographic clothes around her. Once on board, they met Tasha Lem who agreed to teleport the two to the planet's surface. There, Clara and the Doctor were surrounded by Weeping Angels.\n\nThe Doctor pulled a secret key out of the wig he was wearing and summoned the TARDIS, saving them both. Dressed in proper clothes again, he then flew the TARDIS to the nearby town of Christmas, where they learnt that the town was surrounded in a truth field. Searching for the source of the transmission, the two found a crack in time, and the Doctor realised that it was the Time Lords trying to return to the universe. The Doctor then explained that if he said his real name the Time Lords would return but all hell would then break loose. After learning from Tasha Lem that the planet was Trenzalore, the Doctor had Clara return to the TARDIS. In the TARDIS, Clara inserted a device the Doctor gave her and was returned home, but grabbed onto the TARDIS as it dematerialised again.\n\nClara returned to Trenzalore three hundred years after she left and found the Doctor middle-aged. The Doctor had been defending Trenzalore from the various threats besieging the planet and revealed to Clara that he had used up all of his regenerations and this would be the end of him. Clara begged him to let someone else take up the job of protecting the planet, but the Doctor refused. Clara watched the planet's brief sunrise with him, during which Handles ceased functioning and the two were invited by Tasha to return to the Papal Mainframe.\n\nThere, Clara and the Doctor were led into a trap, as the Daleks had already taken over the Mainframe and converted everyone, including Tasha, into Dalek puppets. When the Doctor threatened to release the Time Lords if the Daleks tried to kill him, Tasha took Clara hostage, and the Doctor claimed not to care if she died. Bravely, Clara declared she would die anyway. Using Clara as an example of bravery, the Doctor helped Tasha regain control of herself and she teleported them back to the planet after disposing of the Daleks.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara returned to the TARDIS where they found Clara's turkey cooked, and after promising never to send her away again, he tricked her into returning home once more. As a grief-stricken Clara celebrated Christmas dinner with her family, she had her grandmother repeat the story of how she fell for her grandfather and was relieved to hear the TARDIS returning for her again, grabbing a Christmas cracker to take to the Doctor. To her surprise, Clara discovered Tasha piloting the TARDIS, and Tasha returned her to Trenzalore sometime further into the future after she left, telling her to go find the Doctor.\n\nUpon reuniting with the Doctor, Clara found him very old and weak. While they sat together, Clara opened the cracker and read the poem inside. When the Daleks demanded his surrender, he agreed but asked Clara to remain behind for her own safety. Desperate to change the future, Clara pleaded to the Time Lords for help through the crack. To her surprise, the crack snapped shut disappeared.\n\nClara watched tearfully as the Doctor stood on top of Christmas' Clock Tower and surrendered to the Daleks, prepared to die at last. As the Daleks hesitated and the Doctor goaded them on, the Time Lords granted the Doctor a new regenerative cycle. To Clara's relief, the Doctor began to regenerate, using the explosive force of his regeneration energy to destroy the Daleks. When the dust cleared, there was no sign of the Doctor, so Clara checked the TARDIS where she found him restored to his youthful self. However, the Doctor told her that he would still regenerate.\n\nShe implored him not to change but despite her pleas, the Doctor suddenly regenerated into a new, older incarnation who left Clara confused by staring at her face to face, and then making comments about his new kidneys. The TARDIS suddenly began crashing, and to Clara's horror, the new Doctor asked her if she knew how to pilot the TARDIS, having apparently forgotten how to do so himself. (TV: The Time of the Doctor [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2013 (BBC One, 2013).)\n\nThe new Doctor[]\n\nAfter crashing in prehistoric times, the new Doctor and Clara were chased by a Tyrannosaurus rex. They managed to escape into the TARDIS, which the dinosaur then swallowed. The TARDIS then relocated to Victorian London, bringing the dinosaur with them, which spat out the time machine onto the banks of the Thames after choking on it. The Doctor, suffering from severe post-regenerative confusion, stepped out and met Madame Vastra, Jenny, and Strax, joined by an equally befuddled Clara, before collapsing. Back at Paternoster Row, the Doctor was put to bed to recover. Vastra confronted Clara over her prejudiced attitude to the Doctor's new face, and Clara admitted that it was a big change for her. Upstairs, the Doctor escaped his room and attempted to communicate with the dinosaur in the Thames, when it suddenly burst into flames. Clara and the Gang left separately and ended up right next to him. The Doctor, still rather confused, disappeared into the Thames.\n\nThe next morning, Clara found a newspaper advertisement that called her the \"Impossible Girl\" and invited her to \"dinner on the other side\"... of the page, which turned out to be an advert for Mancini's Family Restaurant. Believing it was a message planted by the Doctor, Clara travelled to the restaurant and indeed found the Doctor there, though he denied leaving the message. Clara and the Doctor were taken down to the restaurant \"larder\" so that the droids could harvest their organs. After being separated from the Doctor, the Half-Face Man interrogated her with threats of death, but remembering what happened when she had unsuccessfully threatened her rebellious students, dared him to, calling him on his bluff and saying that if the new Doctor was really the Doctor, he'd save her. The Doctor suddenly revealed himself. She and the Doctor called the Paternoster Gang into action, and they began fighting off the droids. The Half-Face Man escaped, but the Doctor followed. Clara and the Gang seemed to be overpowered by the droids, but before they could be killed they all suddenly deactivated.\n\nClara and the Gang returned to Paternoster Row, finding that the Doctor and the TARDIS had vanished. Clara prepared to ask for a vacancy, believing the Doctor wouldn't come back. However, he did, and Clara happily ran to the TARDIS. Inside, she was surprised to find the Doctor, like his predecessors, had renovated the control room. He affirmed to Clara he was not her boyfriend. Still having great trouble dealing with the sudden changes to the Doctor's regenerated self, Clara showed trepidation to continue travelling with him when the TARDIS landed on Earth. Clara's phone started ringing. Stepping outside, Clara answered the phone and was shocked to hear the voice of the Eleventh Doctor. He told her he was calling from Trenzalore before he had finished regenerating. He told her the new Doctor would be just as scared after the change as she would be and urged her to help him, with the two of them finally exchanging a belated goodbye. This call finally convinced Clara to accept the new Doctor, and she gave him a big hug, despite him protesting he was no longer a \"hugging person\". The two then realised that instead of Clara's home, they had landed in Glasgow, and they set off to get coffee. (TV: Deep Breath [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nTravels with the Twelfth Doctor[]\n\nWhen the Doctor failed to return with the coffee, Clara returned to her teaching duties. Mr Armitage introduced her to a new maths teacher, Danny Pink, and following an awkward conversation, asked each other out. Clara returned to her office and found the Doctor with the coffee. The Doctor told her he needed her help and brought her aboard the TARDIS. He asked her if he was \"a good man\", but she told him she didn't know.\n\nAboard a ship called the Aristotle (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) in the Ryzak solar system, (PROSE: The Secret Lives of Monsters [+]Justin Richards, BBC Books (2014).) Clara and the Doctor joined a team to be shrunk and deposited into a malfunctioning Dalek called \"Rusty\". The shrunken Doctor and Clara entered Rusty through its eyestalk in order to determine how it became good and attempt to repair the Dalek so that it could help the efforts of the resistance. When the Doctor's repairing of Rusty caused it to kill several of the Aristotle's soldiers, Clara entered the Dalek's memory banks and allowed the Doctor to link minds with it, causing it to turn against its kind and order a nearby Dalek ship to retreat. After this Clara and the Doctor returned to their normal size. The Doctor then returned Clara to Coal Hill School, again asking if he was a good man. Again she admitted she didn't know but pointed out that he tried to be, which was what really counted. Back at Coal Hill, she met up with Danny again, agreeing to go on a date with him and insisting she had nothing against soldiers. (TV: Into the Dalek [+]Phil Ford and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara later gave the Doctor some chips who proceeded to ramble about how great they tasted. (COMIC: Untitled [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) In return, the Doctor attempted to get a reservation at a restaurant on Calbaron III in 5083, only to learn that there was a three year wait. They booked and went three years to the future, only to learn the restaurant was closed to celebrate the third anniversary of the overthrowing of the tyrannical emperor Vimlox. After briefly returning to 5083, and seeing their future selves enjoying a meal, the two made for 5080 to make a reservation. Before they left, the Doctor found that the tyrannical emperor had scratched his TARDIS and promptly overthrew him, resulting in the anniversary. (COMIC: Planet of the Diners [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor repaired the scratch on the TARDIS, but found that the damage had caused time within the TARDIS to temporarily run backwards, much to Clara's annoyance when she tried to converse with him. (COMIC: The Inversion of Time [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) The Doctor later used his uncertainty about what sort of person he was to have Clara do various chores around the TARDIS, though she stopped indulging him after he forced her to take out the trash. (COMIC: The Bin Dilemma [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor offered Clara the choice of their next visit. She requested to meet Robin Hood, having grown up reading the stories about him, despite the Doctor's insistence that he was a fictional character. They arrived in Sherwood Forest, to indeed find Robin Hood, but the Doctor refused to believe he was real. Following an archery contest, the Doctor, Clara and Robin were captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham and his robot knights, and taken to his castle, which was actually a spaceship. The Doctor and Robin argued in the cell, leading the guard to believe Clara was the most responsible and mature one of the three - and therefore their leader - so he took her out to the Sheriff. Clara tricked the Sheriff into revealing to her his plans to take over the kingdom. The Sheriff also revealed that he planned to make Clara his consort, and attempted to kiss her, which she avoided. She then warned the Sheriff that he'd \"regret that\" if he tried again. She managed to escape with Robin, who brought her to his campsite and demanded he tell her what the Doctor knew about the Robin Hood legends, though she ended up telling them about the Doctor's life as well, having been unable to stop once she started. They returned to the castle in the middle of a revolt led by the Doctor, where Robin defeated the Sheriff in a battle. Clara, the Doctor and Robin then teamed up to launch a golden arrow to allow the ship to fly into space. Clara and the Doctor farewelled Robin and set off on more adventures. (TV: Robot of Sherwood [+]Mark Gatiss, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara went on a date with Danny, but some miscommunication caused her to storm off. Returning home, Clara met the Doctor, who convinced her to help him learn if there was a creature that can perfectly hide; he believed this to be why people talk out loud when alone. Using the telepathic circuits, Clara accidentally landed the TARDIS at the West Country Children's Home in the 1990s when a call from Danny distracted her. Clara and a young boy called Rupert Pink, who was a younger version of Danny, and they encountered a mysterious figure hidden by a bed sheet sitting on Rupert's bed. The Doctor, Clara and Rupert turned away from the figure as it left Rupert's bedroom, and they were unable to find out if it was a creature or a child playing a prank. Clara asked the Doctor to take her back to the moment she left Danny, so she could attempt patching things up. However, not only did she mess things up, but the Doctor called her back to the TARDIS, where she met Orson Pink, who came from 100 years later in Clara's timeline.\n\nOrson was a time traveller who had been trapped at the end of time, where the Doctor's theory seemed possible, as something wanted in. However, the Doctor was knocked out when the door opened and the oxygen field collapsed. Clara piloted the TARDIS via the telepathic circuits, accidentally landing in the Doctor's own childhood. Hiding under his bed, Clara convinced the young First Doctor it was a dream. Fear, she told him, can make one kind instead of cruel and cowardly, and a day would come when he was the most afraid. Inside the TARDIS, Orson asked the Doctor what was outside Orson's ship, but Clara entered and asked the Doctor what if there was nothing behind the door, or under everyone's beds, and \"What if the big bad Time Lord doesn't want to admit he's just afraid of the dark?\" Clara made the Doctor promise to leave and never find out where they had landed. She returned to the 21st century where she decided to make her relationship with Danny a romantic one. She leaned in and kissed Danny, allowing both of them to overcome their separate fears of becoming a couple. (TV: Listen [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nDating life and companion life collide[]\n\nWhile Clara was preparing for a date with Danny, she refused to go sightseeing with the Doctor. However, when the Doctor received a call from an elderly Madame Karabraxos, who asked him to rescue the Teller and its imprisoned mate from the Bank of Karabraxos before the solar storm would destroy it, Clara joined the Doctor on the mission. The Doctor recruited Saibra and Psi and, disguising himself as \"the Architect\", orchestrated a bank heist for himself and his new team to commit. The Doctor, Clara and Saibra used memory worms to erase their recent memories, while Psi deleted his recent memories manually. This allowed them to break into the Bank of Karabraxos without revealing their plan to the Teller, who was forced to work as the bank's telepathic guard by Ms Delphox, the Head of Bank Security. Following the instructions left by the Architect, the team discovered six devices which they believed were atomic shredders. Preferring a quick and painless death, Saibra was soon forced to use one of them, as later was Psi.\n\nLeft alone, the Doctor and Clara entered the bank's vault, where they found the payment which the Architect had promised to Psi and Saibra. The pair were soon captured by the Teller and Ms Delphox, who ordered their execution. However, they were rescued by Saibra and Psi, who had survived and disguised themselves as guards. They revealed that the \"atomic shredders\" were actually teleporters. Reunited, the team ventured into the bank's private vault, where they discovered the bank's director, a younger Madame Karabraxos. Realising the true identity of the Architect, the Doctor wrote down his phone number and gave it to Karabraxos, who fled the bank. No longer subjected to Karabraxos, the Teller used its psychic powers to restore the Doctor's lost memories, allowing him to learn the true objective of their mission. After freeing the Teller and its mate, the Doctor and his team escaped the planet using the teleporters. Reunited with his TARDIS, the Doctor dropped the two creatures off on an isolated planet. After giving Psi and Saibra their payment and having a meal with them and Clara in the TARDIS, the Doctor returned his companions to their respective times and places, allowing Clara to be back home on time for her date. (TV: Time Heist [+]Steve Thompson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nAt some point, the TARDIS had been lost in 22nd century London and kept a boy called Simon safe when the city had been taken over by wolves. At a time when Simon, the Doctor and Clara all needed help, Simon triggered the TARDIS' telepathic circuits and the TARDIS materialised around the Doctor and Clara just as they were \"about to be turned into toast by an Aaraanandal slime beast\". They took Simon out of the danger zone to bring him to his parents in Bedfordshire, before leaving in the TARDIS. (PROSE: When the Wolves Came [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nAlthough the Doctor always returned her home soon after they left, leading a double life didn't prove to be easy for Clara. During one of their adventures, the Doctor and Clara were held prisoner on a desert planet. As a result, Clara acquired a tan, which surprised Danny. After meeting fish people with the Doctor, Clara turned up on a date with Danny in a wet dress and with seaweed in her hair. One day Danny came round to Clara's flat to go running with her, not knowing that she was already exhausted after running for her life on another outing with the Doctor. On another occasion, Danny saw Clara wearing a space helmet. By that time, the rumours of Clara's and Danny's romantic relationship were travelling among the students of Coal Hill School. Clara's two lives finally collided when one morning the Doctor informed her that they were not going to have an adventure that day, explaining that he had a \"thing\" to do. To her horror, when Clara arrived at Coal Hill School, Mr Armitage introduced her, Danny and other teachers to the school's new caretaker, who was actually the Doctor going undercover. He had discovered a Skovox Blitzer killer robot in the surrounding area and was planning to lure it into the school, where he was going to trap it using chronodyne generators and send it into the Time Vortex. However, his plans were spoiled when Danny, whom the Doctor didn't like and whom he claimed he didn't recognise, discovered and switched off some of the chronodyne generators.\n\nThe Doctor was still able to temporarily send the Blitzer into the Time Vortex. Noticing that Clara was familiar with the Doctor, Danny demanded explanations. Clara had to tell him the truth about her life with the Doctor. The Doctor's dislike for Danny increased when he learned that Danny was Clara's boyfriend. Declining his proposal to erase Danny's memories of these events, Clara took the shocked Danny home. Danny was uncomfortable with the fact that Clara \"eloped\" with the Doctor when he wasn't seeing her. This prompted her to give him an invisibility watch and take him with her into the TARDIS the next day so that he could observe her interactions with the Doctor. However, the Doctor sensed Danny's presence, and a heated confrontation arose between the two men. As Danny stormed out of the TARDIS, Clara reminded him that it was parents' evening at Coal Hill School that day, and the pair had to return to their duties.\n\nDuring the parents' evening, the Skovox Blitzer suddenly emerged from the Time Vortex earlier than expected, which the Doctor detected. He summoned Clara and gave her his sonic screwdriver, instructing her to use it to attract the Blitzer's attention and lure it towards the TARDIS. The Doctor used the device that he had built to make the Blitzer think of him as of its superior. This accidentally triggered the Blitzer's self-destruct protocol. However, Danny appeared at the last moment and distracted it, giving the Doctor enough time to deactivate the Blitzer. The Doctor had to acknowledge that Danny had saved the world, while Danny claimed that he didn't need the Doctor to like him, but needed to prove himself a worthy boyfriend for Clara in the Doctor's eyes. Clara shared an evening with Danny. He told her that when he was a soldier, he knew officers like the Doctor, and made Clara promise to tell him if the Doctor ever pushed her too hard. (TV: The Caretaker [+]Gareth Roberts and Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nClara volunteered to supervise a school ski trip with Danny, so the Doctor brought her to the planet Isen VI, which they discovered being terraformed by Kano Dollar and his company Dollar Intergalactic. The terraforming woke up a Hyperion named Rann-Korr. Clara had to use a ski-pole to fence with Eric the drone, reprogrammed by Rann-Korr, and helped the Doctor to revert an area of Isen VI around Rann-Korr to its original icy state, freezing Rann-Korr inside. This was Clara's first encounter with Hyperions. (COMIC: Terrorformer [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014).)\n\nClara and the Doctor later answered a distress call from an old friend of his, Tiger Maratha, leading them to meet his daughter Priyanka Maratha instead as Tiger had been dead for some time. It turned out that a family cult that worshipped Kali were working to resurrect her by murdering people and using their souls to power Kali's rebirth; they had tricked Tiger into collecting three of the four swords, but threatened to kill him when he claimed that the fourth was nowhere to be found. Clara was captured and used as bait to ensure the Doctor brought the fourth sword of Kali to them, in exchange for Clara's safety.\n\nHowever, they double-crossed the Doctor and used Clara as the vessel of Kali's spirit, mutating her into Kali's form; Clara retained awareness of what was happening. When the Doctor returned, he managed to help free Clara briefly from Kali's control, saving him from being sliced to death. However, the Doctor had a backup plan; he had placed his sonic screwdriver in the fourth sword and tricked Kali into destroying her power source. The vengeful spirits forced Kali out of Clara, returning her to normal. Borrowing a shirt from Priyanka, Clara and the Doctor attended the Festival of Light with Priyanka and her new girlfriend Rani Jhulka, a time-displaced Amazon from 18th century Africa. (COMIC: The Swords of Kali [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nEarth was later invaded by the Fractures, creatures of the Void who sought Paul Foster, a scientist from another universe who had crossed into N-Space to join a version of his family that had lost his counterpart. The Doctor managed to banish the Fractures with Clara convincing him to allow Paul to remain. (COMIC: The Fractures [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).) Clara had been given one of the Doctor's sonic screwdrivers during the course of the adventure but as he had forgotten to reclaim it, Clara kept it for herself. (COMIC: Clara Oswald and the School of Death [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2016).)\n\nOn a jungle planet, Clara found a museum that held a record of the Tenth, Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors meeting. Seeking to prevent the dangerous paradoxes of a Multi-Doctor Event, Clara steered the TARDIS to Paris in 1923 to enlist the aid of Gabby Gonzalez and Alice Obiefune only for a future Gabby to arrive and warn that they were all falling into the trap of an alternate Twelfth Doctor who now ruled the Voord. Navigating around the traps, the group made their way to Marinus to confront their foe where Clara convinced the alternate Twelfth Doctor to revert the Voord lest they be destroyed. Only asking that Clara not forget him, the alternate Doctor complied. Having previously entered the Doctor's timestream, Clara's memories of this were erased soon after. (COMIC: Four Doctors [+]Paul Cornell, Titan summer events (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nShunning the Doctor[]\n\nWhen the Doctor told Courtney that she wasn't special, she became upset and inconsolable. Noticing this, Clara asked the Doctor to tell Courtney that she was special, which prompted him to take both Clara and Courtney to the Moon in the year 2049 so that Courtney could become the first girl to step on the lunar surface. The TARDIS landed on board a space shuttle that Captain Lundvik and her crew were piloting to the Moon, which recently had been gaining weight and creating chaos on Earth due to its increasing gravity. Investigating an abandoned moonbase, the Doctor, Clara, Courtney and the astronauts were attacked by spider-like creatures, who soon killed Lundvik's crew.\n\nAfter scanning the Moon's core, the Doctor discovered that the Moon was actually an egg that was about to hatch and release a giant creature. Believing that it was a threat to humanity, Lundvik desired to kill it using the nuclear bombs which her crew brought to the Moon in their shuttle. Unwilling to kill a yet-to-be-born and potentially innocent organism, Clara asked for the Doctor's advice - but to her horror, he proclaimed that it was not his place to decide the fate of Earth's Moon and departed in the TARDIS, leaving Clara, Courtney and Lundvik to make a decision on behalf of humankind.\n\nClara sent a video message to Earth, asking humanity to vote whether they should destroy the creature or not. Although the human race unanimously voted for killing it, Clara could not bear such a decision and cancelled the countdown. At the same moment, the TARDIS arrived back, and the Doctor took the three women to a beach on Earth. The creature harmlessly emerged from its egg, its eggshell dissolving without doing any damage to Earth, and laid another egg. He explained that the sight of such a creature being born would fascinate humanity and inspire it to pioneer into space and spread across the universe.\n\nAfter the Doctor took Courtney back to Coal Hill School, Clara confronted the Doctor, demanding to know what he really knew and threatening to hit him \"so hard he would regenerate\". The Doctor replied that he knew that the creature wouldn't harm Earth and that Clara \"would always make the right choice\". Angered by the fact that the Doctor, whom she considered her friend, had put her in a terrible situation in which she nearly caused the death of an innocent creature, and tired of his patronising attitude, Clara told him to leave and never return for her, exiting the TARDIS in tears. When Danny came to see Clara in her class, she recounted the story to him. She claimed that she had finished with the Doctor, but Danny pointed out that she was still angry and stated that \"you can never finish with anyone while they can still make you angry\". He told Clara to calm down first, and only then tell the Doctor that their relationship was over. (TV: Kill the Moon [+]Peter Harness, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nForgiving the Doctor[]\n\nClara remained angry at the Doctor for several weeks, but eventually, she realised that although she couldn't carry on travelling with him, she didn't want to part with him on bad terms, and agreed to make one final trip with him as \"a goodbye to the good times\". The Doctor took Clara to the space-bound recreation of the Orient Express, where they soon learned that one of the passengers, Mrs Pitt, had recently died. Theorising that she was killed by the mythical Foretold, the Doctor set off to investigate, while Clara followed Maisie, Mrs Pitt's granddaughter, to the luggage car, where the two got themselves trapped.\n\nAfter several more people were killed by the Foretold, the Doctor discovered that the Orient Express was actually a trap orchestrated by Gus, the computer who controlled the train, to study the Foretold. Learning that Maisie would be the next victim and planning to make use of her death in order to study the Foretold, the Doctor phoned Clara and told her to bring Maisie to the lab, making Clara lie to her that the Doctor would be able to save her. Gus unlocked the luggage car door, allowing Clara and Maisie to the lab, where the Doctor admitted knowing all along, or at least suspecting, that this wouldn't be just a relaxing voyage. Clara realised that the Doctor had once again placed her in a dangerous situation. The Doctor was able to make the Foretold attack him instead of Maisie and, identifying it as an \"ancient soldier being driven by malfunctioning tech\", surrendered to it, allowing it to die. Having no more need for the scientists, Gus proceeded to remove all the air from the train, making Clara and the rest of the passengers pass out. The Doctor retained oxygen long enough to use the Foretold's teleport to rescue everyone on board.\n\nUpon waking up, Clara found herself with the Doctor on a beach on a nearby planet. He explained that he was unable to save the other passengers from the Foretold and that there was a big chance that he wouldn't be able to save Maisie as well, but he still had to risk her life to stop the Foretold, because \"sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose\". Back in the TARDIS, Clara asked the Doctor if he loved the fact that his life was full of dangerous situations and hard decisions, and whether it was like an addiction for him, to which he replied that you couldn't tell if something was an addiction until you tried to give it up. Upon receiving a call from Danny, Clara indicated to him that she had finally parted ways with the Doctor. However, unable to really give up her life in the TARDIS, she lied to the Doctor that Danny wouldn't mind if she continued travelling with the Doctor as long as he brought her home safe and on time, and much to his joy and delight, asked him to take her on a new adventure. (TV: Mummy on the Orient Express [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nSecret adventures[]\n\nThe Doctor landed on the Pollyanna, the first of the Ninth Era sunships, which had been on an expedition to circumnavigate the Sun. Because the temperature was kept cold in spite of the Doctor telling Clara he was taking her \"somewhere warm\", Clara went back inside the TARDIS to change in warmer clothing, while the Doctor ran off without her. Clara met the boss of the expedition, the egotistical \"handsome quadrillionaire\" Rudy Zoom, and was shown the Pollyanna's flight deck. When the Umbra, a group of \"psychic predators\" who fed off self-loathing, began attacking the Pollyanna, Clara used the TARDIS to translate a looped signal Sandy Tanaka had been trying to decode. The signal was a message recorded by an alien scientist whom had created the Umbra. He said that originally, the Umbra had been a psychic fabric fashioned into a cloak which drained guilt. However, the Umbra gained intelligence and devoured his people's \"spirits\".\n\nThe scientist as a last ditch effort tried burning them in the Sun, but they survived, trapped inside the Sun's chromosphere. The Umbra began swarming the Pollyanna, anchoring the ship to the Sun to try and hijack it and use it as a way of reaching Earth. As the rest of the crew on the flight deck headed to auxiliary control, Clara destroyed the navigation system, stopping the Umbra from finding Earth. After the crew was surrounded, Clara realised that Rudy was too much of a narcissist to have any self-loathing in his mind for the Umbra to feed on, and sent him to speak to the Umbra. As a result, the inside of Rudy's mind was \"like poison\" to the Umbra and the Umbra on board were destroyed while trying to feed on his mind. Meanwhile, the Doctor had used the graviton inverter on the Pollyanna to destroy the Umbra which had swarmed on the ship's hull by freezing them to death. (COMIC: The Eye of Torment [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhile attempting to return Clara home, the Doctor accidentally took the TARDIS to Bristol, and the pair discovered that the TARDIS exterior had reduced in size. Staying behind in the TARDIS to investigate the effect, the Doctor sent Clara to look around and find the cause. Clara met Rigsy and his community service crew and learned that people had been disappearing in the area, with murals of them appearing on the walls of a pedestrian tunnel. On returning Clara discovered that the TARDIS had shrunk further, preventing the Doctor from getting out. However, the doorway was still large enough for him to pass Clara his sonic screwdriver, his psychic paper and a nanotechnological device that allowed him to communicate with Clara and see through her eyes. Putting the small TARDIS in her handbag, Clara set off to find the source of the dimensional leeching.\n\nClara once again met Rigsy, and they investigated the disappearances. The Doctor realised that they were dealing with beings from a two-dimensional universe, who were sucking people into flat surfaces. As the two-dimensional entities were advancing on Clara and Rigsy, Clara received a call from Danny and, telling him that she was busy helping a community worker find his missing aunt, quickly hung up. Clara and Rigsy escaped the danger and, when the Doctor realised that the murals were actually the creatures taking forms of their victims, Clara and the rest of the community service crew at the tunnel hid in a nearby engine repair warehouse. While the group was confused and disorientated, Clara became the leader and attempted to bring them to safety. As the creatures had gradually picked off the community service workers, Clara, Fenton and Rigsy became the only survivors. The Doctor claimed that he had discovered a way to send the creatures back to their dimension but didn't have enough power to do so. In the chaos, the TARDIS was dropped down a shaft onto a railway. Fleeing from the creatures, Clara found the TARDIS in siege mode on the tracks and devised a plan to restore its power. She asked Rigsy to paint a fake door with a flattened handle and placed the TARDIS behind it. Attempting to de-flatten the fake handle so that they could open the \"door\", the creatures unknowingly pumped dimensional energy into the TARDIS, restoring it to its proper size and full power. The Doctor emerged from the TARDIS and, taking his sonic screwdriver back from Clara, sent them back to their dimension. When the threat was over, the Doctor took the survivors to the surface. (TV: Flatline [+]Jamie Mathieson, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nThe Doctor tried taking Clara to the frost fair in 1641, but instead, was drawn off course and landed in the Sahara Desert in 1941, where they were captured by Nazis. After the Doctor spoke to their field marshal, Erwin Rommel, and learnt of Germany's Tuareg allies making friends with \"men from the stars\", Clara stayed behind at the base because of the Tuareg's hostility towards women. Eventually, though, after the Rutan spy Heinz Bruckner framed the Doctor and Clara as spies, Clara was taken prisoner and joined Bruckner, ostensibly in a mission to find the Doctor and Field Marshall Rommel. Instead, Bruckner drove to the site of the Sontaran world engine weapon, the Warsong, using the chronal energy inside Clara to pinpoint the location of the Warsong so he could claim it for the Rutans. The Doctor and Rommel broke through the defences of the Warsong, but Bruckner held Clara hostage. The Doctor stopped Bruckner from conducting the millennia-old preset programming of the Warsong by using a Sontaran osmic projector to send Bruckner's trigger mechanism through time, and Clara broke free. Rommel threw Bruckner into the Warsong, killing him, while the Doctor destroyed the \"orchestra\" of the Warsong by using his sonic screwdriver to blow it up. Afterwards, he brought Clara to the frost fair. (COMIC: The Instruments of War [+]Mike Collins, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2014-2015).)\n\nClara and Danny chaperoned a school trip to a museum, and upon leaving, discovered a forest had grown all over the world. One of the students, Maebh Arden was missing. Clara, Danny and the students met up with the Doctor at Trafalgar Square, and she and the Doctor set off to find Maebh. Following a trail that Maebh left, they caught up to her but were trapped by a tiger. Danny saved them. Maebh claimed to have been behind the forest, and the solar flare headed for Earth that had come to her in the thoughts Maebh found after her sister Annabel went missing. Believing there was no hope for humanity, Clara convinced the Doctor to leave her and Earth behind. The Doctor began to leave but realised the trees were protecting Earth, rather than destroying it with the solar flare. With the Doctor's help, Maebh sent out a message to humanity urging them to leave the trees alone. The Doctor and Clara then watched as Earth was shielded from the solar flare by the trees. Back at her flat, the Doctor stated to Clara that humanity would forget the incident. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nWhen the Doctor took Clara to Las Vegas in 1963, he quickly won her a fortune only to be escorted away by enforcers of the casino's owner. Left to her own devices, Clara quickly won the affections of the Wolf Pack who promised to help her find the Doctor before the Cybock Imperium invaded. Imprisoned with the artists at the Cosmos Casino, Clara managed to extort information from the conquerors, distracting them long enough for the Doctor to arrive. The Doctor eventually managed to convince the Cybock to play a game of Rassilon's roulette with the Time-Gun of Rassilon, resulting in the Cybock wiping themselves from history, the Doctor revealing that the gun couldn't fire on Gallifreyan DNA. Afterwards, Clara attended a show by the Wolf Pack, being mortified to discover that they considered the Doctor her \"sugar daddy\". (COMIC: Gangland [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nNext materialising in Derbyshire in 1845, though aiming for Margate, the Doctor and Clara were brought to North Lees Hall where they freed the residents from the thrall of an Aranox, which burnt to death along with the castle. As the residents all left, Clara was delighted to learn that they'd given Charlotte Brontë the inspiration for Jane Eyre. (COMIC: Unearthly Things [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nLosing Danny[]\n\nThis section's awfully stubby.\n\nInfo from Fear Is a Superpower [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW. needs to be added\n\nDuring the \"invasion of the trees\" Danny learned about Clara's secret adventures with the Doctor. After marking her student's schoolwork and writing some sticky notes, Clara was prepared to tell Danny the truth. (TV: In the Forest of the Night [+]Frank Cottrell-Boyce, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).) While he was out walking, she phoned him. She began to tell him about her recent travels with the Doctor and that she loved him, however, the line fell silent during the call. A panicked woman took the call and informed her that Danny had been hit by a car. Clara rushed to the scene in time to see Danny's lifeless body being taken away by paramedics. Several days later, Clara attempted and failed to blackmail the Doctor to save Danny's life. The Doctor still agreed to use the telepathic circuits to find a way to save Danny. The TARDIS took them to 3W. They were greeted by Missy, who said that she was a greeting droid and passed them on to Dr Chang. Dr Chang established a communication with the Nethersphere, and the voice of Danny came through. The Doctor left with Chang to investigate the centre while Clara spoke with Danny. Clara asked Danny to say something which only he could say so that she knew that it was definitely him. She vowed to find a way to be with him, even if it meant taking her own life. In fear that she would die for him, Danny repeatedly told Clara he loved her, prompting her to end the call. Turning around, she found that the dark water had drained from the tank containing Dr Skarosa, revealing him to be a 3W Cyberman. (TV: Dark Water [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nTo save herself, Clara used her knowledge of the Doctor to try to convince the Cybermen that she was him but ultimately failed. However, another Cyberman stunned her, killed the others and took her to a graveyard. In the graveyard, Clara avoided the Cybermen rising from their graves and her saviour revealed itself to be Danny. However, Danny couldn't stand the pain of being a Cyberman and asked Clara to activate his inhibitor for him. Clara activated his inhibitor to allow Danny to clearly see the Cybermen's plan and afterwards hugged Danny who retained control even with the inhibitor due to his love for her. As Clara hugged Danny, Missy, who was in fact a female incarnation of the Doctor's boyhood friend the Master, arrived to reveal her plan was to convert all of humanity and have them march across the universe, conquering and converting, an unstoppable army, with the only question being whether that army spread on its own or the Doctor took control of it himself. During the confrontation, Clara got ahold of Missy's weapon, while the Doctor handed control of the army to Danny. Danny then sacrificed himself to stop Missy's plans. However, the devastated Clara decided to kill her out of revenge. The Doctor decided to do it to spare Clara from being tainted, but they were both spared when a rogue Cyberman appeared to disintegrate Missy with his wrist blaster.\n\nTwo weeks later, Clara awoke to Danny's voice and followed it to a portal. Clara was excited as the Doctor had told her that Missy's bracelet, which Danny had on him, would thus allow him to come back. However, Danny chose to send back the boy he killed, asking Clara to get him home as there was only enough power left for one trip for one person. Meeting with the Doctor, Clara nearly told him about what happened with Danny when the Doctor assumed he returned and she would be ending her adventures with him for a life with Danny. However, she stopped herself when he told her that he had found Gallifrey. Clara said goodbye to the Doctor and watched him depart once more as she didn't want to spoil his happiness. (TV: Death in Heaven [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 8 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nSecond chance with the Doctor[]\n\nWhen Clara was attacked by a dream crab who slowly fed on her brain, she had a dream where she became an old woman filled with regrets. She turned down many marriage proposals, taught in every school in Europe and learnt how to fly an aeroplane. She was then attacked by a dream crab, and in the dream within the dream was a young woman who saw Santa Claus' sleigh crash on her roof. The Doctor arrived and invited Clara into the TARDIS, and they arrived at a base on the North Pole on Christmas Eve. The Doctor, Clara and the scientists at the polar base were again attacked by dream crabs and had a dream within this dream where Santa saved everybody's life. Clara told the Doctor that Danny was, in fact, dead, while the Doctor explained that he lied about finding Gallifrey. While trying to fetch a dream crab specimen for the Doctor to examine, Clara realised the specimen had come to life, and attacked her face, causing her to have a dream within this dream. In the dream, Clara had woken up on Christmas morning to an alive Danny, and the Doctor had used a dream crab to enter this dream. Clara assured the Danny in the dream that she would miss him for five minutes every day while for the rest of the time she would \"get the hell on with it\".\n\nAfter leaving Danny, the Doctor realised that the dream crab had left no wound on either of them and everyone at the polar base still had the pain in a spot on the head, which meant that they were still dreaming. The Doctor, Clara and the scientists woke up, but before they left, Clara asked the Doctor how Santa could have been on her roof if he was a part of the dream. Ashley Carter signalled Santa with a flare to get them away from the dream constructs that were psychic representations of the dream crabs' attack, and as they rode on Santa's sleigh, the base's scientists, who weren't actually scientists, woke up in the real world. Inside Clara's dream as an old woman, the Doctor pulled the dream crab off her face while she failed to wake up, and he realised that he had arrived sixty-two years after he had last met her. As Clara told the Doctor about her life and the Doctor wished he could have come back for her earlier, Santa arrived, asking the Doctor, \"How much do you wish that?\" The Doctor woke up again, and pulled the dream crab off of Clara's face again at her home, revealing a young Clara. The Doctor offered Clara to travel through time and space in the TARDIS again, and she agreed. (TV: Last Christmas [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who Christmas Special 2014 (BBC One, 2014).)\n\nTo celebrate Clara's birthday, the Doctor threw her an \"Infinite Clarabration\" attended by herself as a child and an old woman along with Oswin and Clara Oswin Oswald. When Clara was shocked at the violation of the First Law of Time, the Doctor revealed that the guests were, respectively, a ganger, an Ood in a wig, a Zygon and the Teselecta, sending them all out and explaining that he'd already paid for the \"Infinite Clarabration\" banner. (COMIC: The Partying of the Ways [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWhen the Doctor took Clara to Cinema Paradoxo for a silent film, he had her smuggle all his snacks under her coat, only for the two to discover that it was a movie acted out by Silents, leaving Clara unable to recall the film. (COMIC: Silver Screenesis [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor later took Clara to an auction where they purchased the living portrait of Lady Josephine, who was destined to become the Eighth Doctor's companion Josie Day. (COMIC: Briarwood [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.) Depositing her in the Doctor's cottage, the two later returned to check up on the two, Clara teasing the Twelfth Doctor about his sentimentality.

(COMIC: Selfie [+]George Mann and Cavan Scott, SDCC exclusive (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travelled to a galactic auction in Earth's orbit where unclaimed storage was being bid on. One of the storage pods belonged to the reclusive collector Hyphen T Hyphen. When the pod was opened, a mother Rigellan Hyper-Kraken emerged and began killing everyone. Her eggs were jolted after being transported with the station's dimensional shunt and began to hatch. Clara helped distract the Hyper-Kraken along with the station's auctioneer as the Doctor safely transported the Hyper-Kraken, her eggs and the storage pods to a backwater world. (COMIC: Space Invaders! [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara went on a tour of Snowcap University in Antarctica in 2048. While taking a helicopter ride, they learnt that one of the students, Polly Evans, had stayed behind at the end of term to join the classified Project Sub-Zero. When another student, Quinn Norton, who also a part of Project Sub-Zero, was killed in a helicopter crash the Doctor and Clara narrowly avoided being on along with Polly's father George, they returned to Snowcap U to investigate. Clara met a research graduate called Winnie Clarence, short for \"Oswin Clarence\". Winnie looked exactly like Clara and recalled dreams of living a thousand lives in a thousand places. Winnie overheard a discussion between the Doctor and Clara over whether or not this meant she was one of her splinters who was born to die based on a decision Clara made and ran off on a snowmobile. Clara tried following after Winnie but the two fell down a crevasse into an ice cavern where the missing students had been experimented on, engineered by Dr Patricia Audley to survive in extreme cold. Along with the spy Paul South, Winnie released most of the imprisoned humans from captivity.\n\nThe Doctor transmitted a signal with his sonic causing Dr Audley's animals to go wild. After feigning betrayal of the two, Winnie threw the Doctor the key to free the hybrid subjects from their cells and saved the Doctor's life by pulling Dr Audley into a vat of liquid ice after Audley pulled a gun on him. Dr Audley was killed, and Winnie appeared to have sacrificed herself, once again, for the Doctor. When Winnie's mother arrived on the scene, Clara, struck with guilt over the death of Winnie, made the decision to live out her life as Winnie to spare Winnie's mother the pain of losing her daughter. Fortunately, Clara did not have to do this as Winnie survived when she unwittingly had a syringe of Dr Audley's experimental blue blood serum injected into her, allowing her to live inside the ice. Clara realised that this meant that not all of the splinters died saving the Doctor, and many of them had lives of their own. The Doctor said that Clara was able to release some of her inner demons as a result of this knowledge. (COMIC: Blood and Ice [+]Jacqueline Rayner, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara visited Paris in 1944 just after it was liberated from the Germans. After foiling a plot by the Darapok Empire, the Doctor and Clara joined in on the liberation celebrations. (COMIC: Trust [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nClara joined the Doctor in a mission to help Mr Hitch recover the sentient superweapon the Hadax Ura. The Hadax Ura shot down the landing craft the team were inside, revealing the weapon's location on the planet Unnamed BX-4, but the team were able to escape using jetpacks. While piloting a jetpack, Clara got separated from the team when she was attacked by pterosaurs, causing her to fall into the Jungle.\n\nClara met the Jungle's organic avatar, who took the form of Danny in an attempt to get Clara to trust him. Although this didn't work, the Doctor found Clara and the organic avatar, and the avatar told them that the Hadax Ura had been \"devouring\" the Jungle, and turning its indigenous life into an army, and asked them either to destroy the weapon or to take it elsewhere. The Doctor realised that this meant it intended to end the war between the Hub Alliance and the Axis Worlds, and the Hadax Ura began augmenting the crew to become its foot soldiers. Believing it had augmented Clara as well, the Hadax Ura had actually linked the Jungle's computer systems to its own after augmenting the avatar. The avatar appeared to shut down the Hadax Ura and its augmented soldiers, but in fact, the Hadax Ura had tricked Hitch's team to bring it on board the lander as a means of escape for the Hadax Ura. With Clara surrounded by the converted Gela and Wiremu and about to be killed by them, the avatar saved her life by destroying them with the entire Jungle's wildlife. When the Doctor returned, Clara kissed goodbye to the Danny avatar, who told her he would always be in her memories. (COMIC: Spirits of the Jungle [+]Jonathan Morris, DWM Comics (Panini Comics, 2015).)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara encountered a vampire-like race called the Corvids in Highgate Cemetery in 1972, who had petrified the TARDIS. They tried consuming Clara's psychic essence but found her toxic due to her unique connection to the time-space vortex where she splintered into a million Claras. The Doctor discovered that the Corvids exposing themselves to Clara left a psychic corridor open, and using the psychic signature of the dead amplified by the ley line the cemetery was built on, the Doctor banished the Corvids back to the time vortex. (COMIC: The Highgate Horror [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara arrived in a forest on a planet, where the TARDIS was stolen by dragons. Navigating to a nearby village, they learned from the Lord Mortigan that they were on a planet designed to resemble medieval times, with the dragons being the planet's natural inhabitants, which had been genetically modified. The dragons had been freed from being inhibited by inhibitor chips by a person known as the Dragon Lord, who aimed to wipe out the townspeople, having already killed the royalty. Although the Doctor declared his intent to leave and let the townspeople get what they \"deserved\" for enslaving the dragons, Clara reminded him that he shouldn't decide which lives were worth saving. The Doctor, Clara and the town's remaining lords set off to reason with the Dragon Lord. Along the way, they ran into a baby hatchling, but Lord Mortigan killed it, causing its parents to attack the party. The Doctor was separated from Clara in the chaos, and reuniting with Clara at the Red Castle, they found that the Dragon Lord had been killed, believing they would have been grateful to him for liberating them. The Doctor and Clara retrieved the TARDIS from the dragons' treasure hoard and left, calling rescue ships to evacuate the planet of humans to allow the dragons to live in peace. (COMIC: The Dragon Lord [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nThe Doctor and Clara were summoned by Harry Houdini and found themselves in a computer program inside a crystal ball which fed on their despair. The program set up theatrical death traps with no way out so their minds could be ripened for it, but the Doctor, Clara and Houdini escaped. The Doctor revealed the virtual environment with his sonic screwdriver. The Doctor, Clara and Houdini then fought back by imagining what made them feel the most free, which shattered the prison and returned them to the real world. They found the owner of the crystal ball prison, Diamanda, had been completely consumed by the crystal ball's power and killed. When Houdini regretted his inability to commune with the dead, the Doctor and Clara reassured him that his legacy would be remembered forever. (COMIC: Theatre of the Mind [+]Error: Code 2 - no data stored in variables, cache or SMW.)\n\nWanting to raise funds for an IT suite at Coal Hill School in memory of Danny, Clara came up with the idea of a Halloween Fayre. However, few people had actually turned up. As part of the Fayre's witch hunt, the time traveller Miss Chief, intending to create mischief, brought the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins to find Clara. When he did so, Miss Chief sent them back in time to the 17th century, where Hopkins captured Clara, in costume as the witch, throwing her into the water to see if she floated. Miss Chief saved Clara from drowning, and Clara later found a mob was accusing a woman called Agnes Leech of being a witch. Trying to save Agnes' life and prove her innocence, Clara was captured by Hopkins again. Clara and Agnes were framed as witches; imprisoned and left to starve and be deprived of sleep in solitary confinement until they confessed.\n\nA hallucination of Danny convinced Clara to confess to being a witch and escape, rather than remain in the dungeon. Clara accidentally identified the Doctor, who had come to rescue Clara, as a witch, and both were to be executed. Miss Chief brought them back to the 21st century before they could be hanged. The Doctor and Clara convinced Miss Chief to bring them back to retrieve the TARDIS and save Agnes from the dungeons, and unwittingly brought the missing cat Smudge with them. Clara convinced the mob that Hopkins was a witch and Smudge was his familiar, but the Doctor prevented them from murdering Hopkins by sneakily putting Miss Chief's time travelling Marotte in his belt, forcing Miss Chief to save his life. The Doctor and Clara escaped and returned to Coal Hill. Because of the Doctor and Miss Chief bringing extinct animals and rare artefacts to the 21st century as part of Miss Chief's scavenger hunt game and her making superstitions coming true, the publicity from paranormal, wildlife and antique experts made Clara's fundraiser at the Halloween Fayre a success, and a few months later, Clara opened the Danny Pink IT Suite, which the Doctor was also present at.

When Clara had befriended a fireman named Sam, he led them to the remainder of London's population where they found Kate Stewart waiting for them. Joined by Sam, the Doctor and Clara tried to destroy the Sussex Firewall only to wind up letting the transformed Colonel Weir into the TARDIS. Armed with Weir's knowledge, the trio flew to the sun only to be confronted by a Hyperion who revealed how their race had survived. After escaping back to Earth, the Doctor and Clara led a resistance movement before shifting the fusion web around the sun to the year 5000000000, collapsing it as the star went nova. (COMIC: The Hyperion Empire [+]Robbie Morrison, Doctor Who: The Twelfth Doctor (Titan Comics, 2015).)\n\nAt some point, Clara and the Doctor met novelist Jane Austen. Clara befriended Austen and the two would play pranks on each other (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).) She once confided in her class that Austen was \"a phenomenal kisser\", (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One|BBC One]], 2015).) and later told Rigsy, \"I love her,\" before teasing him with the statement, \"Take that how you like.\" (TV: Face the Raven [+]Sarah Dollard, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One, 2015).)\n\nThe Glory Days[]\n\nWhen all the planes of Earth were frozen, UNIT requested Clara's help due to being unable to contact the Doctor. With Clara acting on his behalf, they eventually discovered that Missy was behind the freezing of the planes. Missy proposed a meeting with Clara. However, she would not reveal how she was still alive. Clara and Missy managed to track the Doctor down to Essex in 1138, and Missy used vortex manipulators to get them there.\n\nAfter finding out that the Doctor had been having a 3-week party there, they were captured by Colony Sarff who imprisoned the three in a hospital building on Skaro, and later took the Doctor to Davros. After escaping, Clara and Missy were captured by a Dalek and taken to the Supreme Dalek who ordered for their \"extermination\". (TV: The Magician's Apprentice [+]Steven Moffat, Doctor Who series 9 (BBC One|BBC One]], 2015).)\n\nDespite the appearance that she had been killed, Clara ended up far away from the Dalek City with Missy. The latter led them into a Dalek burial ground, where she attacked and killed a Dalek. She told Clara to get in it, and so she obliged, leading Missy through the city as her \"prisoner\". When she was found by the Doctor, Missy attempted to convince him that the Dalek that, in fact, was Clara had murdered Clara. In trying to convince the Doctor not to kill her, Clara caused the casing to say \"mercy,\" rousing the Doctor's suspicions. Telling Clara how to open the casing, the Doctor found her inside it and told Missy to run. Retreating to the Dalek control room, the Doctor revealed his new sonic sunglasses and rematrialised the TARDIS around them, carrying them to safety beyond the city. Standing on a mountain, the two watched the Dalek city descend into chaos with the Doctor asking Clara how she'd caused the casing to say \"mercy\". When Clara confessed that she didn't know, the Doctor realised what he had to do and led her back to the TARDIS.
