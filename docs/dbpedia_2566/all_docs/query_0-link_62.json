        "text": "[FONT=&quot]8 APRIL[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 3 of 3[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1994 - Kurt Donald Cobain, musician (Nirvana), found dead aged 27. [/FONT]In the last year of his life, Cobain attempted to kick heroin, which he claimed made his stomach problems unbearable once more. Then, by some miracle, a doctor came up with a diagnosis, scoliosis – temporarily relieving the delighted singer from one of his major burdens at least. The burden of coming off heroin was, however, one he seemed less able to accommodate. During 1993, police made many visits to his home, usually to investigate either drugs or firearms possession (Cobain claimed his guns were purely for protection). Cobain was also banged up for several hours after an alleged assault against Love. By the start of 1994 he was talking of divorce. Then in early March 1994, a distraught Courtney Love called for help from a Rome hotel room, where Cobain had apparently overdosed. Nirvana's tour had been postponed because of the singer's throat infection, and he, Love and Frances Bean had attempted to spend some quality time in the Italian capital – though even this seemed beyond Cobain now.\n\nOn 8 April, Gary Smith was fitting security lighting when he made the discovery that so many in Cobain's world had dreaded. Despite a major search for the AWOL singer, the maintenance man was the only one who had thought to enter a room called 'the greenhouse' above the garage at the musician's Seattle home. Cobain's body was found slumped with a 20-gauge Remington shotgun resting on his chest – he had been dead for three days, killed by a single bullet wound to the mouth. By his side was an open wallet and driver's licence, presumably for identification; as well as Cobain's well-publicized suicide note, there was also drug paraphernalia near by. Within the hour the shocking news flashed across the world. A verdict of suicide was passed with little ado, and the media circus epilogue for a rock great began in earnest. Tributes came and went as expected, with Courtney Love leading a wake on 10 April that was undermined by a number of Cobain's friends choosing to retire to Krist Novoselic's house afterwards. In Seattle's Space Needle Park, 5,000 Cobain followers held their own vigil, singing Nirvana songs and burning their flannel shirts in what Spin magazine described as 'an awesome moment of pagan catharsis'. Inevitably, sales of Nirvana records thereafter went through the roof – and at least sixty-eight copycat suicides were reported. (As for the other musicians, Courtney Love and Hole enjoyed brief fame ( before the singer attempted various reinventions of herself, most notably as a Versace-clad movie starlet), Grohl still enjoys rock superstardom with Foo Fighters, while Novoselic saw two projects, Sweet 75 and Eyes Adrift, bite the dust before becoming politically active.)\n\nAlthough the external signs point to an open-and-shut suicide, twelve years on there are an increasing number of dissenting voices. Leading a crusade that has spawned countless books and websites (and an intriguing documentary by British film-maker Nick Broomfield) is private investigator Tom Grant, hired by Love to investigate Cobain's earlier disappearance. Grant has since turned against his former employer, who, in his view, stood to lose everything had the couple divorced. Grant has run an ongoing campaign for the case to be reopened. (Among his claims are that, at his death, Cobain was loaded up with so much heroin that it would have been impossible for him to fire a gun and that there were indeterminate fingerprints on the weapon.) Furthermore, both Cobain's best friend, Dylan Carlson, and Frances Bean's nanny, Jackie Ferry (who had resigned a week before Cobain's passing), have stated that most of the couple's rows towards the end seemed to involve money – and, most crucially, Cobain's will. Remarkably, another dissenting voice is that of Love's father, Hank Harrison, a former manager of The Grateful Dead. Less convincing, though nonetheless intriguing, was the claim of Washington schlock-rocker Eldon 'El Duce' Hoke that Love had offered him money to kill her husband – before he died in mysterious circumstances himself (gApril 1997 ). But the authorities apparently remain satisfied by the suicide verdict, while what little evidence coming to the fore tends to be snuffed by Love's lawyers.\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1994 - The Recording Industry Association of America announced that Pink Floyd's 1973 album Dark Side of the Moon had become the fourth biggest-selling album in US history and had passed the 13 million mark in sales. The album has sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.\n\nin 1994 - Irene Eisinger, singer, dies at 91\n\nin 1995 - Take That had their sixth UK No.1 single when the Gary Barlow penned 'Back For Good' went to the top of the UK charts. The song sold over 300,000 copies in its first week and was also a US Top 10 hit. The song won Best British Single at the 1996 Brit Awards.\n\nin 1996 - Charles Donald Adams, singer, dies at 67.\n\nin 1897 - (Eugen Otto) Herbert Eimert, German musicologist and composer, is born at Bad Kreuznach. He took courses with Abendroth, Bolsche, and Othegraven at the Cologne Conservatory (1919-24) and studied musicology with Biicken, Kahl, and Kinsky at the University of Cologne (PhD., 1931, with the dissertation Musikalische Formstrukturen im 17. und 18. Jahrhunderi; published in Augsburg, 1932). He worked for the Cologne Radio from 1927 until the advent of the Nazis in 1933; after the fall of the Third Reich in 1945, he resumed his activities (until 1965); was founder- director of its electronic music studio (1951-62). He served as a professor at the Cologne Hochschule fur Musik (1965-71). He composed a number of electronic works. His important writings include AtonaleMusiklehre (Leipzig, 1924), Lehrbuch der Zwolftontechnik (Wiesbaden, 1950; 6th ed., 1966), and Grundlagen der musikalischen Reihentechnik (Vienna, 1963). With H. Humpert, he edited DasLexikon der elektronischen Musik (Regensburg, 1973). - Died at Cologne, Dec. 15, 1972.\n\nin 1997 - Mae Boren Axton, country deejay, publicist for Hank Snow, dies at her home in Henderson, Tennessee. Axton was also a songwriter, co-composing Elvis Presley's hit, 'Heartbreak Hotel'. Axton is the mother of singer-songwriter Hoyt Axton. She accidentally drowned in a hot tub. She had been ill for some time. - Born September 14, 1914.\n\nin 1997 - Laura Nyro (LAURA NIGRO) Died. The daughter of a professional jazz trumpeter, Bronx-born singer Laura Nyro had greater success as a songwriter than as a performer. Composing her first song at age eight, she nurtured her talent at the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. Recording a much-ignored début album at 19, More Than A New Discovery (1966), the project instead spawned a trio of cover hits: 'Stoney End' (Barbra Streisand), 'And When I Die' (Blood, Sweat & Tears) and 'Wedding Bell Blues' (The Fifth Dimension).\n\nHaving alienated the crowd with her odd costume, Nyro was mercilessly booed off-stage at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, and thereafter she rarely performed in public. Hiring the young David Geffen as her manager, Nyro switched to Columbia Records where she would release her breakthrough album Eli And The Thirteenth Confession, which was highlighted by 'Stoned Soul Picnic' (a hit for The Fifth Dimension), and 'Eli's Coming' (a Top 10 hit for Three Dog Night). Nyro followed this up with the genre-crossing album New York Tendaberry, which yielded a third cover-hit for The Fifth Dimension, 'Save The Country'.\n\nNyro landed her sole chart hit with a cover of the Goffin-King standard, 'Up On The Roof', which appeared on the emotive and politically charged album Christmas And The Beads Of Sweat. She later recorded an album's worth of cover hits, and was backed by LaBelle on the Gamble & Huff-produced Gonna Take A Miracle (1971). After retiring from music for four years, Nyro divorced her husband and returned to the studio in 1976 to record Smile.\n\nA reclusive, cult figure who preferred to expend her energy in social activism in the latter part of her life, Nyro toured for the first time in over a decade in 1988, a performance captured on Live At The Bottom Line. Her final studio recordings, Angel In The Dark, were released in 2001. She died at her home in Danbury, Connecticut.

UK No.1 hits.\n\nin 2001 - Van Stephenson (VAN WESLEY STEPHENSON) died at Memphis, Tenn. A Nashville based singer-songwriter, Van Stephenson was also a member of the trio, BlackHawk. Born in Hamilton, Ohio, but raised in Nashville, Stephenson became a minister before switching careers to become a staff writer for House Of Gold, where he landed his first major success with the Crystal Gayle country hit 'Your Kisses Will'. Also pursuing a solo career, Stephenson had a solo pop-rock hit with 'Modern Day Delilah' (1984). Teaming with songwriter Dave Robbins in the early Eighties, Stephenson penned a number of hits for Restless Heart, Dan Seals and others. In 1992, Stephenson and Robbins teamed with former Outlaws member Henry Paul to form the country trio, BlackHawk, one of the most successful country acts in the Nineties, with over a dozen chart hits including 'Every Once In A While', 'I'm Not Strong Enough To Say No' and 'There You Have It'. Diagnosed with cancer in 1999, Stephenson quit the group the following year. He died in Memphis. - Born November 4, 1953.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2001 - Pedro Depestre Gonzalez, dies suddenly at the age of 55, he was one of the greatest violinists of the Cuban music scene. Long established as a musical celebrity in Havana, he seemed on the point of winning a much larger following in Europe, when he collapsed during a concert in Basel, Switzerland this week. Performing in Cachaito Lopez's band, on the first night of their current European tour, Pedro Depestre (as he was best known) had just played what was generally agreed to have been an \"incredible\" violin solo.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While other Cuban musicians, many much older than Depestre, have become celebrities in the West in recent years, thanks to the success of the Buena Vista Social Club album, and the various off-shoot albums and tours that have followed, he had until recently retained a low profile outside Cuba, despite his fame back home. He had performed on solo albums by two of the Buena Vista stars, Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, but never took part in any of the Buena Vista touring bands. His real breakthrough outside Cuba came with his appearance on Cachaito, the widely praised debut album from the Buena Vista bass player, Orlando Cachaito Lopez, which was released earlier this month.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While the best-selling Buena Vista album had revived earlier Cuban musical styles with he help of the now elderly Cuban musicians who had pioneered them, the Cachaito album was something different: a highly atmospheric, experimental, instrumental set, in which echoes of Cuban dance music were mixed with Jamaican dub reggae, jazz, and DJ styles. Wildly experimental, it sounded at times like the sound-track to some imaginary film and included contributions from the likes of Hugh Masekela, the great South African trumpeter, to Pee Wee Ellis, the American saxophonist. Depestre played an important role in the project, matching Cachaito's daring and rhythmic bass work with his moody, drifting and experimental solos.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Regarded as a musical celebrity since he was a teenager, Depestre started playing violin at the age of five, and by the time he was 13 was invited to join one of the great Cuban bands, Orquesta Aragon, with whom he stayed for three or four years. Founded more than 60 years ago, and still continuing today, this is a band known for its mixture of modern and traditional Cuban styles, making use of flute, violin, but no brass section. Started up by Orestes Aragon, it was later taken over by Rafael Lay (father of the current Aragon bandleader) who was Depestre's godfather.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Later, Depestre moved on to become the director of the Maravillas de Florida and the Orquesta Tipica De Juventud (Santiago de Cuba). He also worked as a music producer for the Cuban Radio and Television Orchestra, and for Egrem, the state-run studios that recorded and released scores of records by Cuban musicians.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 1979, he took part in the celebrated Estrellas de Areito recordings at Egrem, in which a whole variety of different Cuban musicians from four generations came together for a series of sessions that in many ways were a forerunner of the Buena Vista project. The pianist Ruben Gonzalez (a major star since the Buena Vista Social Club) was one of those taking part, and, like him, Pedro Depestre was given a then rare opportunity to stretch out and record some of his finest solos. He later went on to become director and orchestrator of the violins, as well as first violinist, at Havana's famous Tropicana Club.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After all the years in which he had never left Cuba, it was sadly ironic that Depestre should die after playing at the start of a tour that would surely have helped to establish him as a major star in the west, and would provide further proof that contemporary Cuban music is capable of far more than revivalism.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His death at such a young age (certainly compared with other members of the Buena Vista project and its other highly successful offshoots) is a sad loss to the Cuban music scene at a time when he was proving so triumphantly that Cuban music can be experimental as well as revivalist.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Cachaito tour is continuing without him \"in honour and respect of Deprestre's music\", and the remaining members of the band will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall, London, the following day. -born June 1945.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 2002 - Marilyn Manson denied claims that he was responsible for the death of a woman after a party at his mansion in 2001. Jennifer Syme, a former girlfriend of actor Keanu Reeves, died when her Jeep Cherokee hit three parked cars. Her mother, Maria St John, was suing the singer for wrongful death, claiming Manson was negligent in \"instructing the woman to operate a motor vehicle in her incapacitated condition\".\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 2003[/FONT][FONT=&quot] - Lisa Marie Presley, daughter of Elvis Presley, releases her first solo album, To Whom It May Concern.

His system of construction marked a new departure in the making of woodwind instruments. To render the flute acoustically perfect, he fixed the position and size of the holes so as to obtain, not convenience in fingering, but purity and fullness of tone; all holes are covered by keys, whereby prompt and accurate \"speaking\" is assured; and the bore is modified, rendering the tone much fuller and mellower.

Or so it was first believed.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2008, The New York Times reported the playback of a phonautogram recorded on 9 April 1860. The recording was converted from \"squiggles on paper\" to a playable digital audio file by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California. The phonautogram was one of several deposited by Léon Scott in two archives in Paris and only recently brought to light.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The recording, of part of the French folk song Au clair de la lune, was initially played at a speed that produced what seemed to be a 10-second recording of the voice of a woman or child singing at an ordinary musical tempo. The researchers leading the project later found that a misunderstanding about an included reference frequency had resulted in a doubling of the correct playback speed, and that it was actually a 20-second recording of a man, probably Scott himself, singing the song very slowly. It is now the earliest known recording of singing in existence, predating, by 28 years, several 1888 Edison wax cylinder phonograph recordings of a massed chorus performing Handel's oratorio Israel in Egypt.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A phonautogram by Scott containing the opening lines of Torquato Tasso's pastoral drama Aminta, in Italian, has also been found. Recorded around 1860, probably after the recording of Au clair de la lune, this phonautogram is now the earliest known recording of intelligible human speech. Recordings of Scott's voice made in 1857 have also survived, but they are only unintelligible snippets.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]It has been claimed that in 1863 Scott's phonautograph was used to make a recording of Abraham Lincoln's voice at the White House. A phonautogram of Lincoln's voice was supposedly among the artifacts kept by Thomas Edison. According to FirstSounds.org, these stories are variations of a myth that seems to have first appeared in print in a 1969 book about antique collecting, in which it is explicitly categorized as a legend and dismissed as based on \"garbled accounts\". There is no solid evidence that such a recording ever existed. The most nearly similar artifact known to have been kept by Edison was a recording of the voice of President Rutherford B. Hayes, captured as a groove indented into a sheet of tinfoil when Edison demonstrated his newly-invented phonograph to Hayes in 1878.

He first studied law; then music with Bruno Walter and Josef Labor. He was a magistrate in Vienna until 1920 while at the same time composing industriously. He devoted most of his energy to opera and also wrote his own librettos. He also composed 2 symphonies., sacred choruses, and numerous songs for his wife, Emilie Bittner, a contralto. During his last years, he suffered from a crippling illness, necessitating the amputation of both legs. - Died at Vienna, Jan. 9,1939.\n\nin 1879 - Ernst Friedrich Richter, German musical theorist, composer, dies at 70.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Born at Großschönau, Saxony.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He first studied music at Zittau, and afterwards at Leipzig, where he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music, then newly founded by Felix Mendelssohn. On the death of Moritz Hauptmann on 3 January 1868, he was elected cantor of Thomasschule zu Leipzig, conducting the Thomanerchor, an office he retained until his death.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He is best known by three theoretical works: Lehrbuch der Harmonie, Lehre vom Contra punct and Lehre von der Fuge, valuable textbooks known to English students through the excellent translation by Franklin Taylor.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"Ernst Friedrich [Eduard] Richter [(1808-1879)]...His compositions include psalms for chorus and orchestra, motets, two masses, a Stabat Mater (voices only), part songs, string quartets and sonatas, and also pieces for organ and for piano. But it is his treatise on the theory of music that will keep Professor Richter's name from oblivion. As already mentioned, two English editions have appeared: one in London (printed without Richter's leave, by the way) by Mr. Franklin Taylor, which must by no means be accepted as a translation, but merely as a very moderate adaptation; the other, unfortunately little known in this country, printed with Richter's consent by John P. Morgan, in New York. The latter translation is most carefully done, and forms a strong contrast to the English edition. On last Good Friday, the 150th anniversary of the first production of Bach's Matthew Passion, the dear old cantor and beloved professor [Richter] was laid to his last rest, accompanied to his grave by the solemn sound of the beautiful choral, Jesu, meine Zuversicht. More hearty regret has rarely filled the hearts of those standing round a musician's grave. Once more the voices of his choir arose in Bach's beautiful melody to Wenn ich eimmal soil scheiden, and then with a last look at his coffin the crowd dispersed. But though gone to his last rest, the memory of many of us will long cherish, as one of the truest artists, most thorough musicians and excellent teachers, that we have ever met, the name of Ernst Friedrich Richter.—London Mn.

Schoenberg denounced the respective isolation of harmonic theory, counterpoint, and form in compositional education as productive only of an \"artless and primitive\" approach to composition.\n\nin 1883 - (Rinaldo) Renzo Bossi, Italian conductor and composer, son of (Marco) Enrico Bossi, is born at Como. He studied in Venice and in Leipzig, and took a course in conducting with Nikisch. He conducted at various cities in Italy. In 1916 he was appointed instructor at the Verdi Conservatory in Milan.

She went on to attend the New England Conservatory of Music and would eventually settle in Chicago. There, her award-winning \"Symphony in E Minor\" was performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, paving the way for more of her work to be commissioned by orchestras both domestically and abroad. Over the years, luminaries like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price sang her compositions as well. A major contributor to classical music, Price died on June 3, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Florence Beatrice Smith was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on April 9, 1887, to Florence Gulliver and James H. Smith. With her mother being a music teacher, the younger Florence learned how to play piano as a child, as did her two siblings, and Florence gave her first recital at 4 years old. She attended the same elementary school as William Grant Still, another future classical music great, and both studied under educator Charlotte Andrews Stephens. By the time Smith graduated from Capitol High School as valedictorian at age 14, she had become a published composer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Smith then attended the New England Conservatory of Music, passing for Mexican for a time at the behest of her mother, who was aware of the challenges to be faced by an African-American student. Smith was nonetheless able to forge friendships with other black composers, and was mentored by the likes of George Whitefield Chadwick and Frederick Converse. Upon her graduation from the Conservatory of Music in 1906, she worked as a teacher for a few years and continued composing. In 1910, she moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to head Clark University's music department.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Florence married lawyer Thomas J. Price in 1912, moving back to Little Rock, and the couple eventually had two daughters. They also had a stillborn son, to whom Florence would dedicate one of her songs.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Prices left Arkansas in 1927 after experiencing severe racial trauma due to a lynching in their community. Upon settling in Chicago, Illinois, Florence immersed herself in opportunity, studying at various musical institutions. Yet she also faced financial difficulties, as her marriage ended and she was forced to make ends meet for herself and her children. At one point, she roomed with one of her students, Margaret Bonds, with Price also working as a composer for radio ads and an organist for silent-film screenings. By the end of the 1920s, she made some headway as her songs for piano were being published.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Upon breaking her foot, Price was able to find the quiet time to complete the composition of the long-form \"Symphony in E Minor,\" which would win the 1932 Wanamaker Prize. The following year, the piece was performed on June 15 at the Century of Progress Fair by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, making it the first work composed by an African-American woman to be played by a major symphony. A sweeping, romantic delight with four movements, \"Symphony in E Minor\" paved the way for orchestras both nationally and internationally to present work from Price over the next two decades, with the pianist being called upon to perform as well.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Price ultimately created more than 300 compositions, and was inducted into the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers in 1940.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In addition to her orchestral pieces, Price wrote shorter pieces sung by vocal luminaries of the day. Marian Anderson sang Price's arrangement of the spiritual \"My Soul's Been Anchored in de Lord\" during the famous Easter Sunday recital at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939. Price also set Langston Hughes's poem, \"Song to the Dark Virgin,\" to music, which was performed by Anderson to great acclaim. Later, vocalists like Leontyne Price and William Warfield would also cover Price's work.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Price died of a stroke on June 3, 1953, in Chicago, Illinois. It's believed that her musical contributions were soon overshadowed by the emphasis on more modernist composers who fit en vogue tastes. Many of Price's compositions were lost. Yet over time, as the work of African-American and female composers began to receive proper attention, her repertoire received new recognition.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In 2001, The Women's Philharmonic issued an album of Price's work, and a recording of her \"Concerto in One Movement\" and \"Symphony in E Minor\" was released in December of 2011, performed by pianist Karen Walwyn and the New Black Repertory Ensemble. In February 2013, classical music figure Terrance McKnight of radio station WQXR, New York produced and hosted a retrospective on Price's career.\n\nin 1889 - Victor Young, American pianist and composer, is born at Bristol, Tenn. He studied piano with Isidor Philipp in Paris. He toured in England and the U.S. as accompanist to prominent singers; held various teaching positions; was music director in Thomas A. Edison's Experimental Laboratory in West Orange, N.J., conducting tonal tests and making piano recordings under Edison's personal supervision (1919-27). He wrote the musical score for one of the earliest sound films, In Old California; composed some 300 film scores altogether; also wrote, for orchestra, Scherzetto, Jeep, In the Great Smokies, Charm Assembly Line Ballet, etc.: piano pieces. - Died at Ossining, N.Y., Sept. 2, 1968.\n\nin 1889 -Efrem Zimbalist, composer/violinist is born at Rostov on Don Russia.\n\nEfrem Zimbalist, Sr. (21 April [O.S. 9 April] 1889 or 1890[1] – February 22, 1985) was one of the world's most prominent concert violinists, as well as a composer, teacher, conductor and a long-time director of the Curtis Institute of Music.\n\nZimbalist was born in the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don (Rostov-na-Donu), the son of Jewish parents Maria (née Litvinoff) and Aron Zimbalist, who was a conductor. By the age of nine, Efrem Zimbalist was first violin in his father's orchestra. At age 12 he entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory and studied under Leopold Auer. He graduated from the St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1907 after winning a gold medal and the Rubinstein Prize, and by age 21 was considered one of the world's greatest violinists.\n\nAfter graduation he debuted in Berlin (playing the Brahms concerto) and London in 1907 and in the U.S. in 1911, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. In 1912, he played the Glazunov Violin Concerto in a concert marking Leopold Stokowski's first appearance with the London Symphony Orchestra. He then settled in the U.S. He did much to popularize the performance of early music. In 1917, he was elected as an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, the national fraternity for men in music, by the fraternity's Alpha Chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. In 1928, Zimbalist began teaching at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. He was director of the school from 1941 to 1968. His pupils included such distinguished musicians as Aaron Rosand, Harold Wippler, Oscar Shumsky, Felix Slatkin, Shmuel Ashkenasi, and Hidetaro Suzuki.\n\nHe retired as a violinist in 1949, but returned in 1952 to give the first performance of the Violin Concerto by Gian Carlo Menotti, which is dedicated to him. He retired again in 1955. He served as a juror of the International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1962 and 1966.\n\nHis own compositions include a violin concerto, the American Rhapsody, a tone poem called Daphnis and Chloe, a Fantasy on themes from The Golden Cockerel by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov and a piece called Sarasateana, for violin and piano. He also wrote an opera Landara, which premiered in Philadelphia in 1956.\n\nHe married the famous American soprano Alma Gluck and they toured together for a time. Alma Gluck died in 1938. In 1943, having been a widower for 5 years, he married the school's founder, Mary Louise Curtis Bok, daughter of publisher, Cyrus Curtis, and 14 years his senior.\n\nHe died in 1985, at the age of 94. His and Alma's son, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and their granddaughter, Stephanie Zimbalist, both became popular actors.\n\nVideo Note: Unfortunately the quality is poor but still one can note[/FONT][FONT=&quot][/FONT][FONT=&quot] the quick vibrato and portamenti.

He went to Moscow and studied piano with Yavorsky at the First Music School (1925-29) and composition with Gnessin at the Gnessin Music School (1929-30). He then went to Leningrad to pursue training in composition with Popov and Riazanov at the Central Music School (1930-32) and with Asafiev at the Conservatory (1932-34). While still a student, he composed his first opera, TikhiyDon (Quiet Flows the Don). After its failure in an opera competition, he sought the assistance of Shostakovich, who helped him to revamp the score. It received its premiere in Leningrad on Oct. 22, 1935.\n\nAfter Stalin attended a performance of the work in Moscow on Jan. 17, 1936, the Soviet propaganda machine was set in motion to proclaim it a model for the development of the so-called \"song opera\" in the socialist realist manner. Dzerzhinsky's limited compositional gifts frustrated him in repeating this signal success, although he continued to compose a large catalog of music. He held various administrative positions with the Union of Soviet Composers from 1936, serving on its central committee from 1948. - Died at Leningrad, Jan. 18, 1978.\n\nin 1909 - Robert Murray Halpmann, dancer is born.\n\nin 1916 - Vicente Goicoechea Errasti, composer, dies at 62.\n\nin 1918 - Jurn Utzon, Danish architect (Sydney Opera House) is born.\n\nin 1920 - Art Van Damme, Norway Mich, jazz accordionist (Chicago Jazz) is born.\n\nin 1923 - Bruno Kiefer, composer is born.\n\nin 1924 - Harald Heilmann, composer is born.\n\nin 1924 - Julian (Midforth) Budden, English musicologist, is born at Holylake, Cheshire.

His studies of 19th-century Italian opera are important; especially valuable is The Operas of Verdi (3 vols., London, 1973-81; rev. ed., 1992). He also published the biography Verdi (London, 1985; rev. ed., 1993).

In protest against this case of racial discrimination, a distinguished group of citizens, headed by Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt, sponsored her concert.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]At 42, contralto Marian Anderson was famous in Europe and the U.S., but she had never faced such an enormous crowd. There were 75,000 people in the audience that day, and she was terrified. Later, she wrote: \"I could not run away from this situation. If I had anything to offer, I would have to do so now.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]So, in the chilly April dusk, Anderson stepped onto a stage built over the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and began to sing \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee.\" Her first notes show no sign of nerves. Her voice is forceful and sweet. And the choice of music — that opening song — is remarkable, given the circumstances. The NBC Blue Network announcer explained the unusual venue this way: \"Marian Anderson is singing this public concert at the Lincoln Memorial because she was unable to get an auditorium to accommodate the tremendous audience that wishes to hear her.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]That was hardly the story. According to Anderson biographer Allan Keiler, she was invited to sing in Washington by Howard University as part of its concert series. And because of Anderson's international reputation, the university needed to find a place large enough to accommodate the crowds. Constitution Hall was such a place, but the Daughters of the American Revolution owned the hall.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"They refused to allow her use of the hall,\" Keiler says, \"because she was black and because there was a white-artist-only clause printed in every contract issued by the DAR.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Like the nation's capital, Constitution Hall was segregated then. Black audiences could sit in a small section of the balcony, and did, when a few black performers appeared in earlier years. But after one such singer refused to perform in a segregated auditorium, the DAR ruled that only whites could appear on their stage.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]One of the members of the DAR was first .... Eleanor Roosevelt. Outraged by the decision, Roosevelt sent a letter of resignation and wrote about it in her weekly column, \"My Day.\" \"They have taken an action which has been widely criticized in the press,\" she wrote. \"To remain as a member implies approval of that action, and therefore I am resigning.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The DAR did not relent. According to Keiler, the idea to sing outdoors came from Walter White, then executive secretary of the NAACP. Since the Lincoln Memorial was a national monument, the logistics for the day fell to Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes. It was Ickes who led Anderson onto the stage on April 9, 1939.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]She began with \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\" — also known as \"America\" — a deeply patriotic song. When she got to the third line of that well-known tune, she made a change. Instead of \"of thee I sing\" she sang \"to thee we sing.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A quiet, humble person, Anderson often used \"we\" when speaking about herself. Years after the concert, she explained why: \"We cannot live alone,\" she said. \"And the thing that made this moment possible for you and for me, has been brought about by many people whom we will never know.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]But her change of lyric — from \"I\" to \"we\" — can be heard as an embrace, implying community and group responsibility. Never a civil rights activist, Anderson believed prejudice would disappear if she performed and behaved with dignity. But dignity came at a price throughout her 25-minute Lincoln Memorial concert. Biographer Keller says she appeared frightened before every song, yet the perfect notes kept coming.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"I think it was because she was able to close her eyes and shut out what she saw in front of her,\" Keiler says. \"And simply the music took over.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After \"America,\" she sang an aria from La favorite by Gaetano Donizetti, then Franz Schubert's \"Ave Maria.\" She ended the concert with three spirituals, \"Gospel Train,\" \"Trampin'\" and \"My Soul is Anchored in the Lord.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]On that stage, before a bank of microphones, the Lincoln statue looming behind her, iconic photographs reveal Anderson as a regal figure that cloudy, blustery day. Although the sun broke out as she began to sing, she wrapped her fur coat around her against the April wind.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Anderson's mink coat is preserved at the Anacostia Community Museum in Washington. It's kept in a large archival box in cold storage and stuffed with acid-free tissue to preserve its shape. The lining of the coat is embroidered with gold threads in a paisley pattern, and the initials M A are monogrammed inside.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Whether wrapped in that coat or gowned for a concert hall, Anderson, Museum historian Gail Lowe says, touched everyone who heard her: \"Her voice was a very rich contralto and so those kind of low notes ... can resonate and match one's heartbeat.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Conductor Arturo Toscanini said a voice like Anderson's \"comes around once in a hundred years.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]'Genuis, Like Justice, Is Blind'[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]When Ickes introduced Anderson, he told the desegregated crowd — which stretched all the way from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument — \"In this great auditorium under the sky, all of us are free. Genius, like justice, is blind. Genius draws no color lines.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]And genius had touched Marian Anderson.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Anderson inspired generations and continues to do so. An anniversary concert will take place at Constitution Hall, which denied her 75 years ago. A few featured performers are Jessye Norman, Dionne Warwick, American Idol winner Candice Glover, bass Soloman Howard and soprano Alyson Cambridge.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Cambridge first heard about Anderson while she was a young music student in Washington. \"They said she was the first African-American to sing at the Met,\" Cambridge says. At 12 years old, Cambridge was just beginning voice lessons, but she knew that New York's Metropolitan Opera was it for an opera singer.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]These days, Cambridge finds she has to explain the great singer to others. \"Some people sort of look at me with a raised eyebrow — 'Who's Marian Anderson?' \" Cambridge says. And she continues, \"She really broke down the barriers for all African-American artists and performers.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Lincoln Memorial concert made Anderson an international celebrity. It overshadowed the rest of her long life as a performer — she was 96 when she died in 1993. Eventually she did sing at Constitution Hall. By that time, the DAR had apologized and changed its rules. Anderson rarely spoke of that historic April day, and Keiler says when she did, there was no rancor.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\"You never heard in her voice, a single tone of meanness, bitterness, blame, it was simply lacking,\" he says. \"There is something saintly in that.

America protest singer-songwriter, born in El Paso, Texas; He wrote hundreds of songs in the in 1960s and released eight albums. Politically, Phil described himself as a \"left social democrat\" who became an \"early revolutionary\" after the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to a police riot, which had a profound effect on his state of mind. He performed at many political events, including anti-Vietnam War and civil rights rallies, student events, and organized labor events over the course of his career, in addition to many concert appearances at such venues as New York City's Town Hall and Carnegie Hall. The Vietnam War ended on April 30th 1975. Phil planned a final \"War Is Over\" rally, which was held in New York's Central Park on May 11. More than 100,000 people came to hear Phil, joined by Harry Belafonte, Odetta, Pete Seeger and others. He and Joan Baez sang a duet of \"There but for Fortune\" and he closed with his song \"The War Is Over\"—finally a true declaration that the war was over. Michael Korolenko directed the 1984 film Chords of Fame, which featured Bill Burnett as Ochs. The film included interviews with people who had known Ochs, including Yippies Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, manager Harold Leventhal, and Mike Porco, the owner of Gerde's Folk City. Chords of Fame also included performances of Ochs songs by folk musicians who knew him, including Bob Gibson, Pete Seeger, Tom Paxton, Dave Van Ronk, and Eric Andersen. (Phil's drinking had become more and more of a problem, and his behavior became increasingly very erratic. Also afflicted with serious depression, he hung himself at his sisters home in Queens, New York).\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5pgrKSwFJE\"]YouTube - Phil Ochs - I aint marching anymore[/ame]\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1977 - ABBA goes to #1 on the US singles chart with \"Dancing Queen,\" the group's seventh US Top 40 hit and first #1. The song is also a #1 in the UK and 12 other countries.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Before \"Dancing Queen,\" Abba had their fair share of hits in the US, but while the Swedish quartet was sweeping the globe with massive album sales and Top 10 singles - five at once in Australia - their tunes rarely hit the upper echelon on the US charts. The most recent record, \"Fernando,\" petered out at #13. Respectable, but that same song breezed to the #1 slot across the globe. What gives, America?[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Up to this point, Abba has given the US a name without a face. Without tours or TV appearances, Stateside listeners are largely oblivious to the fact that all these bright Swedish pop records of late come from the same group. To combat the invisibility issue, they show up on a few LA-based programs like Dinah and Midnight Special so they won't be forgotten, but Abba isn't really phased. \"We'll wait until there's a demand from the audience,\" the group's Benny Andersson tells Phonograph Record in 1976. \"We could come here as a supporting act, but it takes so much money and so much time to do it the way we want (a 13-piece band and no backing tapes)...We can wait.\"[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]They don't have to wait too long. Less than six months later, their new single \"Dancing Queen\" is a #1 hit in the US. The song replicates Phil Spector's lush Wall of Sound and taps into the still-raging disco boom in the country. Plus, there's the novelty of watching the foursome on their TV screens performing in bedazzled jumpsuits - finally, a shiny image to go with a shiny record. Abba has officially conquered the world.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1982 - Wilfrid Pelletier dies at age 85.French Canadian conductor, pianist, composer, instrumental in establishing the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. He was one of the most influential music educators in Canada during the 20th century. It was largely through his efforts that the Conservatoire de musique et d'art dramatique du Québec (CMADQ), an organization which has established and oversees nine different schools of higher education in music and theatre in Quebec, was established in 1942. From 1943 through 1961 he served as the director of the CMADQ and its first school the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Montréal. He also served as the first director of the CMDAQ's second school, the Conservatoire de musique du Québec à Québec, from 1944–1946, and was instrumental in establishing the Conservatoire d'art dramatique du Québec à Montréal in 1954. As a pianist, he was active during the 1920s and 1930s as one half of a piano duo with partner Arthur Loesser. He also made a number of solo recordings in the early 1920s, playing mostly piano reductions from the operas of French composers like Georges Bizet, Charles Gounod, and Jules Massenet. As a composer, he produced only a small body of work, most notably In the Dark, in the Dew which soprano Maria Jeritza included in a number of her recitals.

In 1948, he went to New York to pursue his music career, going in and out of gospel groups, such as The Langfordaires, The Jerusalem Stars and The Golden Gate Quartet. Returning to his home state, he joined a R&B singing group, The Sandmen, and went back to New York to get a big break with his group. The Sandmen had limited success and their label, Okeh Records, decided to push Peay as a solo artist, changing his name to Brook Benton, apparently at the suggestion of label executive Marv Halsman.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Brook earned a good living by writing songs and co-producing albums. He wrote songs for artists such as Nat King Cole, Clyde McPhatter (for whom he co-wrote the hit \"A Lover's Question\") and Roy Hamilton. He eventually released his first minor hit, \"A Million Miles from Nowhere\", before switching to the Mercury label, which would eventually bring him major success.

Both of the first two hits were written by Benton with Clyde Otis. They were originally offered to Nat King Cole, but when Otis became an A&R manager and producer at Mercury, he convinced Benton to sign with the label and record them himself, while asking Cole not to record the songs as planned. Benton followed this success with a series of hits, including \"So Many Ways\" (#6), \"Hotel Happiness\" (#3), \"Think Twice\" (#11), \"Kiddio\" (#7), and \"The Boll Weevil Song\" (#2). In 1960, he had two top 10 hit duets with Dinah Washington: \"Baby (You've Got What It Takes)\" (#5) and \"A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall in Love)\" (#7).[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the mid 1960s, Benton recorded for RCA Records and Reprise Records with minimal commercial success. Then, in 1968, he signed with Cotillion Records, a subsidiary of Atlantic Records, where, the following year, he enjoyed his last major hit with \"Rainy Night in Georgia\", written by Tony Joe White and produced and arranged by Arif Mardin. a million-seller which topped the Billboard R&B chart. Benton recorded a total of five albums with Mardin, including a gospel album, during his stay at Cotillion.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Benton eventually charted a total of 49 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with other songs charting on Billboard′s rhythm and blues, easy listening, and Christmas music charts.[6] The last album made by Benton was Fools Rush In, which was released posthumously in 2005.

The tenor (higher) voice was Samuel David Moore (born Samuel David Hicks on October 12, 1935 in Winchester, Georgia), and the baritone/tenor (lower) voice was Dave Prater (May 9, 1937, Ocilla, Georgia -- April 9, 1988, Sycamore, Georgia).\n\nAccording to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Sam & Dave were the most successful soul duo, and brought the sounds of the black gospel church to pop music with their call-and-response records.

They were an influence on many future musicians, including Bruce Springsteen, Al Green, Tom Petty, Phil Collins, Michael Jackson, Elvis Costello, Teddy Pendergrass, Billy Joel and Stevie Winwood. The Blues Brothers, who helped create a resurgence of popularity for soul, R&B, and blues in the 1980s, were influenced by Sam & Dave - their biggest hit was a cover of \"Soul Man\", and their act and stage show had many similarities to the duo.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot][ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlXm5gy5ZU\"]YouTube - Sam and Dave live - Hold on I'm coming (live 1966)[/ame][/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1991 - Martin Hannett aka Martin Zero dies at age 42.English record producer, born in Manchester, Lancashire; as a teenager he played bass with Spider Mike King and as member in a band called Paradox, in 1973, alongside Paul Young, later of Sad Café and Mike + The Mechanics.
