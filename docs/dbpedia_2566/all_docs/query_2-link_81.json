        "text": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nThe most outrageous awards show of the year will return to our screens very soon.\n\nThe 2024 MTV Video Music Awards is certain to be star-studded, especially with a nominee list that includes everyone from industry powerhouses like Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, and Megan Thee Stallion to rising newcomers like Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, and Gracie Abrams.\n\nAhead, we break down everything to know about this year's VMAs.\n\nWhen are the 2024 VMAs?\n\nThis year, the VMAs will take place on Wednesday, September 11. The ceremony will start at 8 p.m. ET, though the red carpet will likely begin hours earlier.\n\nWhere are the VMAs?\n\nThe stars will be heading to New York's UBS Arena to attend the awards show.\n\nHow can I watch?\n\nYou can watch the show live on September 10 by tuning into MTV. If you don't have cable, you can likely catch up with the ceremony through by subscribing (or, in some cases, signing up for a free trial) to a streaming service platform, such as Hulu Live TV, YouTube TV, Sling TV, and Fubo TV.\n\nShop Now\n\nSign Up for YouTube TV\n\nShop Now\n\nShop Now\n\nWho's nominated?\n\nTaylor Swift dominated this year's nominations list, racking up a total of 10 nominations for categories like Artist of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop. Her nomination for the night's most coveted award, Video of the Year, sets the stage for Swift to potentially make VMAs history as the first artist to win in that category three years in a row and five times overall.\n\nPost Malone closely follows Swift with nine nominations, followed by Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, and Eminem, who each tie with six nominations. Other major artists who received nominations include Beyonc√©, Megan Thee Stallion, SZA, Olivia Rodrigo, and Blackpink's Lisa.\n\nBut, the night will also shine a spotlight on up and coming musicians. This year's first-time VMAs nominees include Chappell Roan, Tyla, Coco Jones, and Gracie Abrams.\n\nWho's performing?\n\nSome of today's biggest artists are set to take the stage at this year's ceremony. Among the first slate of confirmed performers include Chapell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Camila Cabello, GloRilla, and Rauw Alejandro. In particular, the VMAs will mark Roan's first-ever live performance during an awards ceremony.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
