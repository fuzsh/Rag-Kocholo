        "text": "1. Bob Einstein's real name was Stewart Robert Einstein. He was born on November 20, 1942, in Los Angeles, California.\n\n2. Aside from his notable career as a comedic actor, Bob Einstein was also a writer and producer. He co-created and wrote for the critically acclaimed comedy series \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" in the late 1960s.\n\n3. Many might not know that Bob Einstein was the older brother of renowned comedian and actor Albert Brooks (real name Albert Lawrence Einstein). They both grew up in a family with a long history of show business, as their father was radio comedian Harry Einstein (known as Parkyakarkus).\n\n4. One of the most surprising facts about Bob Einstein is that he had a successful career as a writer and performer before gaining widespread recognition for his character \"Super Dave Osborne.\" In the early 1970s, he won two Emmy Awards as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" and even appeared as a guest on shows like \"The Dick Cavett Show\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\""
