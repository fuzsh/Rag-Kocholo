I just loved working with her. I love her as a person. She's just fantastic. She's just so great. She was up for anything and she's back in this season,\" Portia de Rossi told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. \"She's just game for anything and has a great sense of humor and can laugh at herself. Just terrific.\"\n\nMinnelli appeared in several episodes of \"Arrested Development\" as vertigo-suffering Lucille 2 -- Lucille Austero -- a neighbor to Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter) and one-time lover of more than one Bluth boy.\n\nMinnelli returns in the new season. \"It was really strange, it was fun,\" Minnelli told The Huffington Post about returning to \"Arrested Development.\" \"That director [Mitch Hurwitz] is just extraordinary, and he writes it too.

The waitress' timing makes it even better.\n\nWatch the video above.

Looks like she took all the talent with her too. But it got me thinking about other showbiz families and what I like to call the Roberts Dichotomy. Namely, Eric and Julia. Both actors, both born of the same genes, and yet, one opens wide her gaping maw and makes gabillions while the other's busy doing B-movies and birthing bigger child stars.\n\nThing is, I love Eric Roberts. I'll watch The Best of the Best pretty much every time it's on. It's like Rocky for sad lonely kickboxers. It's just strange that Julia gets all the accolades. And so started up a list of other semi-talented siblings overshadowed by the crazy successful brethren/sistern.\n\nFun Fact: Nicolas Cage, Sofia Coppola, and Jason Schwartzmann are all first cousins.
