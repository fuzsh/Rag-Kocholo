        "text": "Bon Jovi have officially been in the cultural conversation for five decades — and it looks like we'll never say goodbye.\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album was unleashed upon the world in 1984, and lead single \"Runaway\" made some waves. Yet the New Jersey group didn't truly break through until their third album, the 12 million-selling Slippery When Wet. By the late 1980s, they were arguably the biggest rock band in the world, selling out massive shows in arenas and stadiums.\n\nSince, Bon Jovi releases have consistently topped album charts (six of their studio albums hit No. 1). A big reason for their continued success is that, unlike a majority of their ‘80s peers, frontman Jon Bon Jovi made sure that they adapted to changing times while retaining the spirit of their music — from the anthemic stomp of 1986’s \"Bad Medicine\" to the Nashville crossover of 2005’s \"Who Says You Can’t Go Home.\" It also doesn’t hurt that the 2024 MusiCares Person Of The Year has aged very gracefully; his winning smile and charismatic personality ever crush-worthy.\n\nTheir fifth decade rocking the planet has been marked by many other milestones: The release of a four-part Hulu documentary, \"Thank you, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story\"; Bon Jovi's 16th studio album Forever, and fan hopes for the return of original guitarist Richie Sambora who left unexpectedly in 2013. Despite all of these positive notes, there is an ominous cloud hanging over the group as their singer had to undergo vocal surgery following disappointing, consistently off-key performances on the group's 2022 U.S. tour. Even afterward, he remains unsure whether he’ll be able to tour again. But Bon Jovi remains popular and with Sambora expressing interest in a reunion, it's plausible that we could see them back on stage again somehow.\n\nJon Bon Jovi has also had quite a multifaceted career spun off of his success in music, as shown by the following collection of fascinating facts.\n\nJon Bon Jovi Sung With Bruce Springsteen When He Was 17\n\nBy the time he was in high school, Jon Bongiovi (his original, pre-fame last name) was already fronting his first serious group. The Atlantic City Expressway was a 10-piece with a horn section that performed well-known tunes from Jersey acts like Bruce Springsteen and Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.\n\nThey regularly played The Fast Lane, and one night Bruce Springsteen was in the audience. To Bon Jovi’s surprise, The Boss jumped onstage to join them. The two later became good friends — during his MusiCares performance, Bon Jovi introduced Springsteen as \"my mentor, my friend, my brother, my hero.\"\n\nJon Recorded Bon Jovi’s First Hit Before The Band Formed\n\nAlthough \"Runaway\" was the debut single and lone Top 40 hit from Bon Jovi's first two albums, it was recorded as a professional demo back in 1982.\n\nBon Jovi got a gig as a gopher at Power Station, the famed studio co-owned by his second cousin Tony Bongiovi where artists like the Rolling Stones, Diana Ross, and David Bowie recorded. (He watched even watched Bowie and Freddie Mercury record the vocals for \"Under Pressure.\")\n\nThe future rockstar cut \"Runaway\" (which was co-written mainly by George Karak) and other demos with session musicians — his friend, guitarist Aldo Nova, Rick Springfield/John Waite guitarist Tim Pierce, Springsteen keyboardist Roy Bittan, bassist Hugh McDonald (a future Bon Jovi member), and Scandal drummer Frankie LaRocca. The song first appeared on a WAPP compilation under his name, but then it was placed on Bon Jovi’s debut album. When the video for \"Runway\" was created nearly two years later, members of Bon Jovi were miming to other people’s performances.\n\nAlthough it is a classic, original guitarist Richie Sambora hates it and never wants to play it again.\n\nHe Eloped With His High School Sweetheart In April 1989\n\nDuring the band’s world tour in support of New Jersey, Bon Jovi and Dorothea Hurley spontaneously eloped in a quickie wedding in Vegas. His bandmates and management were shocked to find this out; the latter probably feared that his ineligible bachelor status would harm their popularity with their ardent female fans. But it simply played more into his more wholesome image that differed from other hard rockers of the time.\n\nIn May 2024, Bon Jovi’s son Jake secretly married \"Stranger Things\" actor Millie Bobby Brown. It was like history repeating itself, except this time family was involved.\n\nListen: Revisit Jon Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits & Deep Cuts Ahead Of MusiCares' Person Of The Year 2024 Gala\n\nThe Bongiovi Family Is Part Of The Bon Jovi Family\n\nBack in the ‘80s, parents often didn’t like their kids’ music. However, Bon Jovi’s parents completely supported his. Mother Carol Bongiovi often chaperoned his early days when he was an underaged kid playing local clubs and bars in New Jersey. Father Jon Sr. was the group’s hair stylist until their third album, Slippery When Wet. He created his son's signature mane.\n\nJon’s brother Matthew started as a production assistant in the band’s organization, then worked for their management before becoming his brother’s head of security and now his tour manager. His other brother Anthony became the director of a few Bon Jovi concert films and promo clips. He’s also directed concert films for Slayer and the Goo Goo Dolls.\n\nBon Jovi Is A Regular In Television & Film\n\nAfter writing songs for the Golden Globe-winning \"Young Guns II soundtrack (released as the solo album Blaze Of Glory) and getting a cameo in the Western’s opening, Bon Jovi was bitten by the acting bug. He studied with acclaimed acting coach Harold Guskin in the early ‘90s, then appeared as the romantic interest of Elizabeth Perkins in 1995's Moonlight and Valentino.\n\nIn other movies, Bon Jovi played a bartender who’s a recovering alcoholic (Little City), an ex-con turning over a new leaf (Row Your Boat), a failed father figure (Pay It Forward), a suburban dad and pot smoker (Homegrown), and a Navy Lieutenant in WWII (U-571). The band’s revival in 2000 slowed his acting aspirations, but he appeared for 10 episodes of \"Ally McBeal,\" playing her love interest in 2002.\n\nElsewhere on the silver screen, the singer has also portrayed a vampire hunter (Vampiros: Los Muertos), a duplicitous professor (Cry Wolf), the owner of a women’s hockey team (Pucked), and a rock star willing to cancel a tour for the woman he loves (New Year’s Eve). He hasn’t acted since 2011, but who knows when he might make a guest appearance?\n\nIn 2004, Bon Jovi became one of the co-founders and co-majority owner of the Philadelphia Soul, which were part of the Arena Football League (AFL). (Sambora was a minority shareholder.) The team name emerged in a satirical scene from \"It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" during which Danny DeVito’s character tries to buy the team for a paltry sum and twice butchers the singer’s name.\n\nJon stuck with the team until 2009, a year after they won Arena Bowl XXII, defeating the San Jose SaberCats. He then set his eyes on a bigger prize, the Buffalo Bills, aligning himself with a group of Toronto investors in 2011. One of his biggest competitors? Donald Trump, who ran a smear campaign alleging that the famed singer would move the team to Toronto.\n\nIn the end, neither man purchased the team as they were outbid by Terry and Kim Pegula, who still own the Bills today.\n\nJon & Richie Sambora Wrote Songs For Other Artists\n\nHaving cranked out massive hits with songwriter Desmond Child, Bon Jovi and Sambora decided to write or co-write songs for and with other artists.\n\nIn 1987, they co-wrote and produced the Top 20 hit \"We All Sleep Alone\" with Child for Cher, and also co-wrote the Top 40 hit \"Notorious\" with members of Loverboy. In 1989, the duo paired up again Loverboy guitarist Paul Dean for his solo rocker \"Under The Gun\" and bequeathed the New Jersey outtake \"Does Anybody Really Fall in Love Anymore?\" (co-written with Child and Diane Warren) to Cher.\n\nThe Bon Jovi/Sambora song \"Peace In Our Time\" was recorded by Russian rockers Gorky Park. In 1990, Paul Young snagged the New Jersey leftover \"Now and Forever,\" while the duo penned \"If You Were in My Shoes\" with Young, though neither song was released. In 2009, Bon Jovi and Sambora were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame for their contributions to music.\n\nJon Bon Jovi Once Ran His Own Record Label\n\nFor a brief time in 1991, he ran his own record label, Jambco, which was distributed through Bon Jovi’s label PolyGram Records. The only two artists he signed were Aldo Nova and Billy Falcon, a veteran singer/songwriter who became Bon Jovi's songwriting partner in the 2000s. Neither of their albums (Aldo Nova’s Blood On The Bricks and Billy Falcon’s Pretty Blue World) were big sellers, and the label folded quickly when they began losing money.\n\nStill, the experience gave Bon Jovi the chance to learn about the music business. That experience helped after he fired original manager Doc McGhee in 1991 and took over his band’s managerial reins until 2015.\n\nBon Jovi's Vocal Issues Aren't New\n\nAlthough Jon Bon Jovi's vocal problems have become a major issue recently, they stem back to the late 1980s. It's doubtful as to whether Jon had proper vocal training for a rock band at the start.\n\nThe group did 15-month tours to support both the Slippery When Wet and New Jersey albums. Near the end of the grueling Slippery tour, Bon Jovi was getting steroid injections because his voice was suffering.\n\nWhile his voice held up into the 2000s, it has become apparent over the last decade that his singing is rougher than it used to be. As shown in the Hulu new documentary, the singer has been struggling to maintain his voice. It’s natural for older rock singers to lose some range — it’s been very rare to hear him sing any of the high notes in \"Livin’ On A Prayer\" over the last 20 years — but he admitshe is unsure whether he can ever tour again, even with recent surgery.\n\nBon Jovi Has Been A Philanthropist For Over Three Decades\n\nBack in the 1980s, the upbeat Bon Jovi made it clear that they were not going to be a toned-down political band. But in the ‘90s, he and the band toned down their look, evolved their sound, and offered a more mature outlook on life.\n\nReflecting this evolved viewpoint, the band started an annual tradition of playing a December concert in New Jersey to raise money for various charitable causes; the concert series began in 1991 and continued with the band or Jon solo through at least 2015. The group have played various charitable concert events over the years including the Twin Towers Relief Benefit, Live 8 in Philadelphia, and The Concert For Sandy Relief.\n\nBy the late 2000s, Jon and Dorothea founded the JBJ Soul Kitchen to serve meals at lower costs to people who cannot afford them. COVID-19 related food shortages led the couple to found the JBJ Soul Kitchen Food Bank. Their JBJ Soul Foundation supports affordable housing and has rebuilt and refurbished homes through organizations like Project H.O.M.E., Habitat For Humanity, and Rebuilding Together.\n\nWhile he may be a superstar, Jon Bon Jovi still believes in helping others. For his considerable efforts, he was honored as the 2024 MusiCares Person Of The Year during 2024 GRAMMY Week.\n\nListen: Revisit Jon Bon Jovi's Greatest Hits & Deep Cuts Ahead Of MusiCares' Person Of The Year 2024 Gala\n\nWhen photographer Charles Peterson first saw Nirvana at a small Seattle club in 1988, he was so underwhelmed he didn’t bother taking a single picture of them.\n\nThe band shared a bill with local act Blood Circus, who, Peterson says, \"put on quite a grungy show; lots of hair going everywhere and guitars flying.\" When Nirvana came on, \"they had the lighting guy dim the light really low and Kurt [Cobain] just stood there and stared at his feet. The music came off as kind of heavy, really difficult to play. I just didn’t get it.\" At one point Peterson even turned to Sub Pop Records co-founder Jonathan Poneman and asked him, \"Jon, are you sure about these guys?\"\n\nSub Pop was sure about Nirvana, and would later sign them. And as the label’s in-house photographer, Peterson (who was in his mid-20s at the time) documented the band’s career for the next five years — from their indie days to international stardom. In his latest book, Charles Peterson’s Nirvana, from Minor Matters Books, Peterson has winnowed down his impressive catalog of an estimated 3,000 shots to a well-curated 90.\n\nReleased on Feb. 20, Cobain’s birthday, Charles Peterson’s Nirvana features shots from his first session with the band, lounging in the wilds of Bainbridge Island, Washington (\"They did have that kind of hippie aspect to them\") to his last, a promotional shoot for In Utero (\"They all, Kurt especially, just seemed a little tired\"). While the book tells the band's story, it's less of a history and more reflective of Peterson's own experience.\n\nAs Peterson recalls, Minor Matters Founder Michelle Dunn Marsh defined the book’s direction, believing Peterson's \"artistic sensibility and how it moves the viewer and portrays the power of the music\" set his work apart from the thousands of other images taken of Nirvana.\n\nPeterson spoke with GRAMMY.com about the stories behind five images in the book. \"And like I say in the introduction, go put on a Nirvana record before you look at this book, and you really get that idea of immersion in the music,\" the photographer advises.\n\nAll images © Charles Peterson/Minor Matters Books\n\nKurt Cobain, University of Washington, Seattle, Jan. 6, 1990\n\nPeterson Got Up Close & On Stage With Nirvana\n\nPeterson had ready access to the band in their pre-Nevermind years. \"It was great, in these early days, to be able to just crawl around on the stage, go do whatever I wanted to,\" he says. \"It does bring an intimacy that you lose later on when you’re stuck in a position like the pit or off behind a PA or something.\"\n\nIn his early days of photographing Nirvana, Peterson had free range of movement and often stood behind the band or close at their side. The musicians had also become a lot more active on stage compared to when Peterson first saw them.\n\nKrist Novoselic, University of Washington, Seattle, Jan. 6, 1990\n\n\"I don't know what it was, if it was having Chad [Channing] as their drummer or the addition of Jason Everman for a while [on guitar]; maybe that allowed Kurt to worry a little bit less about hitting the chords perfectly so that he could jump around and go face down on the stage and roll around and do all that,\" Peterson says. \"Even so, he’s not holding the audience’s attention. They’re not looking at Kurt; they’re all looking at something over there, which must be somebody stage diving or something.\n\n\"It’s all those little details that you pick up on that are great; there’s a piece of crumpled paper in front, and another photographer up in the back,\" Peterson notes. \"And again, in the Krist shot, he's looking at me yet everyone else is looking away. There’s all this other stuff going on that you don’t even have to pay attention to the band. There’s feet in the air here. A lot of Converse in the photos!\"\n\nCrowd shot, Motor Sports International Garage, Seattle, Sept. 22, 1990\n\nNirvana's Audience Was Just As Important — And Interesting\n\nPeterson always focused his lens on the audience as much as the bands. \"I love this one because you’ve got a Nirvana shirt there. One person is looking at me; nobody else is. Bare chests. A lot of sweaty, sweaty hair,\" he says of the above photo, taken at a makeshift venue that was actually a parking garage.\n\n\"Seattle crowds, we’re some of the best. And it just didn’t seem right to isolate the power of the bands from the effect that they were having on the audiences,\" Peterson reflects. \"I found that the photos had just that much more power if you could anchor the band in their time and space with the audience, and see what that reaction is between the two, versus it just being the beauty shot of the singer.\"\n\nPeterson says there was both a symbiotic and cathartic relationship between Nirvana and their fans. \"People would be like, ‘Oh my God, look at those audiences in Seattle!’\" The photos distill the essence of that relationship. \"The bands are great, the personalities in the bands are great…that idea that it’s a complete scene, that the participation of the audience is just as important as the participation of the bands.\"\n\nPeterson recalls standing next to the PA at stage right during this show.\n\n\"What I would do is, with one hand, lean out holding the camera upside down over the audience. And then I would have my flash in the other hand, so that the light gave a nice kind of mottling to it. Not looking through the viewfinder, just photographing. I do a lot of that,\" he says. \"The camera takes the picture whether you’re looking through the viewfinder or not.\"\n\nKurt Cobain, Commodore Ballroom, Vancouver, BC, Canada, March 8, 1991\n\nPeterson Sensed This \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" Shot Was Something Special\n\nPeterson knew immediately that something special had occurred when he took this picture. \"I remember pushing the shutter on this shot and going, What just happened? But then the show moves on.\"\n\nA few days later, Peterson was in his darkroom developing the film and finally saw the impact of the moment he captured. He printed the image and a proof sheet, and gave them to Nirvana’s Seattle publicist Susie Tennant, who shared them with Cobain. The picture is on the back of Nirvana's \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" single.\n\nThe photo became one of Peterson’s most widely reproduced images. \"I think what makes a photo iconic is that the photo reads easily and at the same time is larger than life and dramatic,\" he says. \"And despite the fact that it reads easily to the eye, there’s a lot of other stuff, hidden stuff going on that you need to think about.\n\n\"It’s also a photo that you can sort of transport to any time and place. It doesn’t necessarily have to be locked in with this particular show or anything. It really goes beyond that and then that ends up standing the test of time.\"\n\nKrist Novoselic and Kurt Cobain, Beehive Music & Video, Seattle, September 16, 1991\n\nBy '91 Nirvana Inspired Mosh Pits Everywhere, Even In Stores\n\nPeterson calls this in-store appearance, a week before Nevermind was released, as \"a watershed moment.\"\n\n\"This was the last time I saw them play on a floor, which to me makes for great photos because you’re right there at the same level as them. It really is in your face,\" he says. \"What was totally surprising was the subsequent mosh pit in the store, with people being hoisted on shoulders.\"\n\nThere were also signs of how things were about to change for the band, Peterson recalls. \"Kurt was besieged by autograph seekers outside the store. It was the first time I think that really happened to him. He was definitely overwhelmed by it.\"\n\nPeterson had some challenges in the darkroom when developing this film, which led to a \"weird graininess\" that differs from many of his other images. \"At the time I was like, ‘Oh God!’ But I think it has a unique look that you just don't get with digital now, unless you really manipulate it.\"\n\nKurt Cobain, Reading Festival, Reading, UK, August 30, 1992\n\nKurt Cobain Cared About His Peers\n\nBy the time of this show, Nirvana were a bonafide international sensation. The band were plagued by stories of drug use and rumors about an impending break-up, while Courtney Love had just given birth to her and Cobain's daughter. All of which attracted huge media interest in this performance.\n\n\"I was a little shocked when I went into the press tent; I had never been to a festival like this before and there were 96 photographers listed on the dry board!\" Peterson reflects. \"Photographers that were shooting from the pit in the front of the stage, they would bring them out and give them five minutes each.\"\n\nThat was not going to work for Peterson.\n\n\"And all of a sudden, Nick Cave finished and there was this huge rush to the stage. And [Nirvana’s UK publicist] Anton Brookes grabs me by the wrist and he’s like, ‘Dude, come with me!’ And we all start running up onto the stage, up the ramp. I was taking a few snaps and then everybody settled into their place. There was Eric Erlandson [from Hole] next to me, and to the right was Mark Arm [from Mudhoney] and some members of L7,\" Peterson says. \"I didn’t have an official stage pass or anything like that, but as long as I was with those guys, it was all cool. That was my spot, so I didn’t dare move from it.\n\n\"This photo was a really, really special moment. Kurt, in between songs, he just looked over at us, and mouthed something like, ‘How are you guys doing?’ And we’re like, ‘We’re fine.’ And then we started waving like back at him, like, ‘Go play, dude! Don’t worry about us,’\" Peterson remembers.\n\n\"It was like he wanted to check in with his peeps on the side of the stage. It’s one of my favorite photos.\"\n\nA potential volume two of Nirvana photos is being considered, as is a retrospective of Peterson’s work, which includes photos of Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, TAD, Mother Love Bone, Beat Happening, and a multitude of others. But Nirvana invariably tops the list.\n\n\"You can talk and write reams about the dramas and the ins and outs. But it’s the power of the music that keeps people coming back,\" he says of the band. \"And the fact that it’s not rooted in a time and place; you can make the music be whatever you want it to be. I mean, half the time you don’t know what Kurt’s singing about or even what the words are, but you can shout your own words along to it if you want. It’s the music that really is that lasting, lasting legacy.\"\n\n11 Reasons Why 1993 Was Nirvana's Big Year\n\nThe rock scene may no longer be the dominant force it once was — blink-182's One More Time... is the only Billboard 200 chart-topper this year to predominantly fall under this category. But 2023 has still been an interesting and eventful period for those who like their guitar music turned up to eleven.\n\nOver the past 12 months, we've had the two biggest groups of the Swinging Sixties returning to the fray in style, a new European invasion, and a wave of blockbuster albums that may well go down as modern classics. And then there's the revivals which will no doubt spark nostalgia in any kids of the 2000s, a resurgence in all-star line-ups, and a residency that could possibly change how we experience live music.\n\nAs we gear up for the holiday season, here's a look at 10 trends that defined rock music in 2023.\n\nEuropean Rock Traveled To America\n\nFrom Lacuna Coil and Gojira to Volbeat and Rammstein, the Billboard charts aren't exactly strangers to European rock. But 2023 was the year when the continent appeared to band together for a mini invasion. Italian quartet Måneskin continued their remarkable journey from Eurovision Song Contest winners to bona fide rock gods with a Best New Artist nod at the 2023 GRAMMYs, a top 20 placing on the Billboard 200 albums chart for third album Rush!, and a Best Rock Video win at the MTV VMAs.\n\nMasked metalers Ghost scored a fourth consecutive Top 10 entry on the Billboard 200 with covers EP Phantomime, also landing a Best Metal Performance GRAMMY nomination for its cover of Iron Maiden's \"Phantom of the Opera,\" (alongside Disturbed's \"Bad Man,\" Metallica's \"72 Seasons,\" Slipknot's \"Hive Mind,\" and Spiritbox's \"Jaded\"). While fellow Swedes Avatar bagged their first Mainstream Rock No. 1 with \"The Dirt I'm Buried In,\" a highly melodic meditation on mortality which combines funky post-punk with freewheeling guitar solos that sound like they've escaped from 1980s Sunset Strip.\n\nAge Proved To Be Nothing But A Number\n\nThe theory that rock and roll is a young man's game was blown apart in 2023. Fronted by 80-year-old Mick Jagger, The Rolling Stones reached No.3 on the Billboard 200 thanks to arguably their finest album in 40 years, Hackney Diamonds, with lead single \"Angry\" also picking up a Best Rock Song GRAMMY nod alongside Olivia Rodrigo's \"aallad of a homeschooled girl,\" Queens of the Stone Age's \"Emotion Sickness,\" Boygenius' \"Not Strong Enough,\" and Foo Fighters' \"Rescued.\" (The latter two will also battle it out with Arctic Monkeys' \"Sculpture of Anything Goes,\" Black Pumas' \"More than a Love Song,\" and Metallica's \"Lux Aeterna\" for Best Rock Performance.)\n\nThe eternally shirtless Iggy Pop, a relative spring chicken at 76, delivered a late-career classic, too, with the star-studded Every Loser. And Bruce Springsteen, KISS, and Paul McCartney all proved they weren't ready for the slippers and cocoa life yet by embarking on lengthy world tours.\n\nDeath Was No Barrier To Hits\n\nJimmy Buffett sadly headed for that tropical paradise in the sky this year. But having already recorded 32nd studio effort, Equal Strain on All Parts, the margarita obsessive was able to posthumously score his first new entry on the Billboard Rock Chart since 1982's \"It's Midnight And I'm Not Famous Yet.\"\n\nBut he isn't the only artist to have recently achieved success from beyond the grave. Linkin Park reached the U.S. Top 40 with \"Lost,\" a track recorded for 2003 sophomore Meteora, but which only saw the light of day six years after frontman Chester Bennington's passing.\n\nPerhaps most unexpectedly of all, The Beatles topped the U.K. charts for the first time since 1969 thanks to \"Now and Then,\" a psychedelic tear-jerker in which surviving members McCartney and Ringo Starr brought previously unheard recordings from George Harrison and John Lennon back to life.\n\nThe Giants Stayed Giant\n\nFoo Fighters also overcame the death of a core member on what many rock fans would consider this year's most eagerly awaited album. Drummer Taylor Hawkins, who passed away in early 2022, doesn't feature on the poignant but vibrant But Here We Are. Yet the two-time GRAMMY nominated LP still proved to be a fitting tribute as well as an encouraging sign that Dave Grohl and co. can extend their legacy:lead single \"Rescued\" became their 12th number one on Billboard's Main Rock Chart.\n\nThe Best Rock Album category for the 2024 GRAMMYs proves that veterans were alive and mighty in 2023. Along with the Foos' latest LP, the nominees include another Grohl-affiliated band,, Queens of the Stone Age's first album in six years, In Times New Roman..., Paramore's This Is Why, Metallica's 72 Seasons and Greta Van Fleet's Starcatcher.. (Metallica's 72 Seasons also struck gold with its singles, three of which landed at No. 1 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, where lead single \"Lux Æterna\" spent 11 consecutive weeks on top.)\n\nOf course, we also have to give a shout-out to U2. Not for March's Songs of Surrender album (for which they re-recorded 40 of their biggest and best tracks), but for the immersive, eye-popping Las Vegas residency at The Sphere which potentially reinvented the future of live music.\n\nThe Rock Supergroup Continued To Thrive\n\n2023 spawned several new rock supergroups including Mantra of the Cosmos (Shaun Ryder, Zak Starkey and Andy Bell), Lol Tolhurst x Budgie x Jacknife Lee, and Better Lovers (various members of The Dillinger Escape Plan and Every Time I Die). But it was an already established all-star line-up that took the GRAMMY nominations by storm.\n\nConsisting of Phoebe Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, and Julien Baker, boygenius bagged a remarkable seven nods at the 2024 ceremony. Throw in a well-received headline set at Coachella, U.S. Top 50 follow-up EP, and even a \"Saturday Night Live\" showing alongside Timothée Chalamet, and the trio couldn't have asked for a better way to continue what they started together in 2018.\n\nThe Early 2000s Enjoyed A Revival\n\nThe cyclical nature of the music industry meant that the era of choppy bangs and super-skinny jeans was always going to come back into fashion. And following throwbacks from the likes of Olivia Rodrigo and Willow, the original punk-pop brigade returned this year to prove they could still mosh with the best of them.\n\nPossibly the defining nasal voice of his generation, Tom DeLonge headed back into the studio with blink-182 for the first time in 12 years, with the resulting One More Time... topping the Billboard 200. Linkin Park (\"Lost\"), Papa Roach (\"Cut the Line\"), and a reunited Staind (\"Lowest in Me\") all scored No. 1s on the Mainstream Rock Airplay Chart, while Sum 41, Bowling For Soup, and Good Charlotte were just a few of the high school favorites who helped cement When We Were Young as the millennial's dream festival.\n\nThe Emo Scene Went Back To Its Roots\n\nAfter channeling the new wave and synth-pop of the 1980s on predecessor After Laughter, Paramore returned from a six-year absence with a record which harked back to their mid-2000s beginnings. But it wasn't their own feisty brand of punk-pop that Best Rock Album GRAMMY nominee This Is Why resembled. Instead, its nervy indie rock took its cues, as frontwoman Hayley Williams freely admits, from touring buddies Bloc Party.\n\nParamore weren't the only emo favorites to rediscover their roots. Fall Out Boy reunited with Under the Cork Tree producer Neal Avron and old label Fueled By Ramen on the dynamic So Much (for) Stardust. And while Taking Back Sunday further veered away from their signature sound, the Long Islanders still embraced the past by naming seventh LP 152 after the North Carolina highway stretch they used to frequent as teens.\n\nCountry Artists Tapped Into Rock Sensibilities\n\nWe're used to seeing rock musicians going a little bit country: see everyone from Steven Tyler and Bon Jovi to Darius Rucker and Aaron Lewis. But the opposite direction is usually rarer. In 2023, however, it seemed as though every Nashville favorite was suddenly picking up the air guitar.\n\nZach Bryan repositioned himself as Gen-Z's answer to Bruce Springsteen with the heartland rock of his eponymous Billboard 200 chart-topper (which is up for Best Country Album at the 2024 GRAMMYs alongside Kelsea Ballerini's Rolling Up the Welcome Mat, Brothers Osborne's self-titled LP, Tyler Childers' Rustin' in the Rain, and Lainey Wilson's Bell Bottom Country). Meanwhile, Hitmaker HARDY — who first cut his teeth penning hits for Florida Georgia Line and Blake Shelton — leaned into the sounds of hard rock and nu-metal on his second studio LP, The Mockingbird & the Crow.\n\nBut few committed more to the crossover than the one of country's greatest living legends. Dolly Parton roped in a whole host of hellraisers and headbangers including Richie Sambora, Joan Jett & The Blackhearts, and Rob Halford, for the 30-track Rockstar — her first rock-oriented project of her glittering 49-album career.\n\nPost-Grunge Reunions Were Abundant\n\nFans of the mopey '90s scene known as post-grunge had all their dreams come true this year thanks to several unexpected reunions. Turn-of-the-century chart-toppers Staind and Matchbox Twenty both returned with new albums after more than a decade away. Creed, meanwhile, announced they'd be headlining next year's Summer of '99 cruise after a similar amount of time out of the spotlight.\n\nThe insatiable appetite for all things nostalgia, of course, means that any band — no matter how fleeting their fame — can stage a lucrative comeback. Take Dogstar, for example, the unfashionable outfit boasting Hollywood nice guy Keanu Reeves. Twenty-three years after appearing to call it a day, the Los Angeles trio surprised everyone by hitting the Bottlerock Napa Valley Festival before dropping a belated third LP, Somewhere Between the Power Lines and Palm Trees and embarking on a headlining national tour.\n\nThe New Generation Gave The Old Their Dues\n\nSay what you want about today's musical generation, but they know to pay respect where it's due., Olivia Rodrigo, for example, doffed her cap to '90s alt-rock favorites The Breeders by inviting them to open on her 2024 world tour.\n\nNew working-class hero Sam Fender invited fellow Newcastle native Brian Johnson to perform two AC/DC classics at his hometown stadium show. While ever-changing Japanese kawaii metalers Babymetal debuted their latest incarnation on \"Metali,\" a collaboration with one of their musical idols, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello.\n\nWhether new artists are teaming up with the old or veterans are continuing to receive their flowers, 2023 proved that rock is alive and well.\n\n2023 In Review: 5 Trends That Defined Hip-Hop"
