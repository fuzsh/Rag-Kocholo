        "text": "Part 1\n\nTranscript\n\n[March 3, 2022: This episode has been updated to include a response from Nick Timothy.]\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThis my first story as a journalist.\n\nI hadn't planned for it to be my last story, but it probably will be given what's happened in the years I've been working on this.\n\nIt's about a letter that surfaced in my city and had huge consequences for Britain.\n\nThis letter launched four government investigations, changed our national policy, and ended careers.\n\nIt's hurt some of the country's most vulnerable children, a letter that many people who've seen it agree is ridiculous.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nIt's unsigned, undated.\n\nIt didn't look like a serious document.\n\nIt just seemed comical.\n\nWhat the hell is this?\n\nI remember looking at it for some time and thinking, what on Earth is this?\n\nThe infamous letter -- was it written on parchment, in blood?\n\nSo you're presenting me with a document that turned our lives upside down.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI first learned of the letter in 2014.\n\nI wasn't a journalist then.\n\nI was a doctor.\n\nI quit medicine, living in Birmingham, England, making my breakfast at 1:00 PM, listening to the news, when I heard about the discovery of a secret communiqué between Muslim extremists.\n\nThey were discussing a plot to infiltrate our city schools and run them on strict Islamic principles, potentially with the aim of radicalizing students.\n\nSomeone had forwarded the letter anonymously to the local government, the Birmingham City Council.\n\nBut it was missing the first and last page.\n\nSo it's unknown exactly who wrote it or who they were sending it to.\n\nAccording to the intercepted pages, the plot had a code name --\n\nOperation Trojan Horse.\n\nI have to admit, when this story about Muslims in Birmingham first broke, as a Muslim in Birmingham, I was alarmed.\n\nIt sounded possible.\n\nKids across Britain, across Europe, were flying off to Syria to join this group called ISIS.\n\nAnd Birmingham has been home to quite a few terrorists.\n\nMy neighbor was a terrorist.\n\nThe guy who killed five people and then tried to run into parliament with a knife, he did his planning in a flat above the Persian restaurant across the street from me.\n\nSo I wasn't surprised watching, as over the next several months, Operation Trojan Horse snowballed into a huge national story --\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nA number of schools in Birmingham have been infiltrated by hardline Muslims.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\n-- headlines like Islamist plot, jihadist plot.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nAlleging a conspiracy by --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAnd the government responded with full force.\n\nThe prime minister got involved, convening his cabinet to discuss the threat.\n\nThe national government sent in a bunch of investigators, including Scotland Yard's former head of counter-terrorism, to look into two dozen schools in majority Muslim areas of Birmingham.\n\nLike I say, this was all very frightening until a few months later, when the various investigators finally start reporting their findings.\n\nThey had found no plot called Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nThey had seen no signs that anyone had been radicalized, no evidence of violence or planned violence.\n\nThey didn't bring any terror charges against anyone working at the schools they'd looked into.\n\nBut despite all of that, despite finding no plot, investigators still concluded that something terrible was happening in Birmingham schools.\n\nThe letter helped them uncover that Muslims had influenced the schools in a dangerous way.\n\nGovernment officials snapped into action.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nThings that should not have happened in our schools were allowed to happen.\n\nOur children were exposed to things they should not have been exposed to.\n\nThe fallout has been huge.\n\nPrime Minister David Cameron, as we said, is calling a special meeting of the government's extremism taskforce.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOfficials removed educators, revamped schools and renamed them.\n\nThey mandated all schools in the country start teaching what they termed \"British values\" to make kids less susceptible to extremist ideas.\n\nThey beefed up Britain's counter extremism laws by making public sector workers like teachers and doctors part of the state surveillance apparatus to now inform on their co-workers and students and patients.\n\nToday, if you stop someone on the streets of Britain and ask them what happened in Birmingham schools in 2014, if they follow the news, they'll likely tell you that a bunch of Muslims were up to no good.\n\nThere is another version of the story, though.\n\nIt's one less told and far less popular.\n\nThat version of the Trojan Horse affair is that nothing happened, that these bearded brown educators were set up, and the nation fell for it.\n\nBut it's always seemed to me that there's a simple way to figure out what really happened here --\n\nthe letter.\n\nEven with all the government inquiries, no authority, none of the investigators ever figured out who wrote it.\n\nRemarkably, none of them even tried.\n\nAnd that, to me, seemed like a pretty glaring oversight.\n\nThe reason the country was looking at these schools with suspicion, the reason they were investigating them at all, was because this dodgy letter showed up portraying the people who worked there as nefarious plotters, claiming they were sneaking Islam into schools like a Trojan horse.\n\nThe letter is what put the idea in authorities' heads.\n\nSo I didn't see how you could know what Operation Trojan Horse was or wasn't, unless you got to the bottom of the Trojan Horse letter.\n\nWho wrote it, and why?\n\nA few years later, I decided to go to school for investigative journalism.\n\nBut my professor wasn't completely sold on the story I wanted to report for my student project, Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nThis was investigative journalism.\n\nHe wanted me to unearth something new, not recover some years old story.\n\nAs a doctor, though, I'm familiar with the concept of a second opinion.\n\nSo the night before my masters was set to start, I went looking for one.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nA doctor came to see me for a second opinion.\n\nOne night, in fall of 2017, I'm in a theater in Birmingham.\n\nAfter my podcast, S-Town, came out, I went around doing some Q&As.\n\nAfterwards, people would sometimes come backstage to chat.\n\nAnd so this guy comes in, introduces himself as Hamza Syed.\n\nHe said he was changing careers to become a reporter.\n\nHe was beginning a masters program in investigative journalism the next day, actually.\n\nAnd he wanted some advice.\n\nHe was speaking fast, like I might walk away at any moment.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nTo be fair I was told that I had five minutes with Brian Reed, after which I'd be escorted out of the building.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nI did not know that.\n\nAnyway, Hamza ran through the Trojan Horse story for me, elevator pitch style.\n\nI've never heard of it, but a guy I was with backstage, a producer I know from the BBC, he had.\n\nAnd he jumped in as Hamza was talking.\n\nYeah, yeah, Trojan Horse, he said.\n\nThat was a big thing a while ago.\n\nSome bad stuff went down.\n\nMuslim educators have been up to no good.\n\nBut it was cleared up -- old story.\n\nThere was something Hamza said, though, which afterwards, I couldn't get out of my head.\n\nHe kept talking about a letter which had set off this whole cascade of consequences, whose origins were still a mystery.\n\nSo when I got home to New York, I read the letter.\n\nIt looked like a caricature of a missive between two terrorists, filled with Islamophobic tropes about conniving and scheming Muslims.\n\nIt's missing pages.\n\nParts of it are too dark to read, like it got jammed in the Xerox machine.\n\nIt instructs the recipient to destroy it after reading.\n\nIt struck me as a funky document for a government to take seriously, especially because from what I read, the government hadn't even looked into who wrote the letter or why.\n\nThere was a strange lack of curiosity about this instigating document.\n\nI thought to myself, it seems like somebody should try to figure out who wrote that thing.\n\nAnd then I thought, well, wait, this journalism student's doing that.\n\nMaybe I had to give him a hand.\n\nAnd here we are, years later, at the end of a dizzying fascicle and enraging investigation, in which one mystery led to another, led to another, tracing this letter's path of destruction across multiple continents.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIn defiance of many unhappy officials and some aggressive attempts to shut our reporting down,\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nFrom Serial Productions and The New York Times, I'm Brian Reed.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI'm Hamza Syed.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nPresenting to you the most elaborate student project ever.\n\nThis is The Trojan Horse Affair.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI got the call from Brian when I was in class.\n\nMy phone started ringing from a New York number.\n\nI asked my professor if I could take it.\n\nHe said no.\n\nI asked if I could go use the toilet.\n\nHe said yes.\n\nI answered, and Brian told me he wanted in on my investigation, but that I would need a producer.\n\nI said, yeah, sure, all casual.\n\nI had no idea what a producer did.\n\nSoon, he started getting in touch with missions for me to complete.\n\nFirst one, he'd secured a recorder for me in Birmingham and said there's something I had to do.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nIt was supposed to be a basic bread and butter assignment -- go record a meeting.\n\nHamza had seen an event advertised called Trojan Horse, The Facts, where some of the educators who've been accused of carrying out the plot would be speaking publicly.\n\nThey insisted the Trojan Horse affair was just an Islamophobic stitch-up.\n\nThe event hashtag was #TrojanHoax, and they were trying to clear their names.\n\nThey'd never gotten their lives back on track after the story died down.\n\nThey'd lost their jobs and had been made into pariahs by the national media.\n\nBut afterwards, Hamza calls me and says when he showed up at the spot, the community center, at 5:00 PM, the receptionist told him --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIt's been canceled.\n\nThe event's been canceled.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nDid they give you any -- but wait, did they give you any other information, like --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nNo, they said it's been canceled, and that was it.\n\nI said, no, this is --\n\nI spoke to the event organizer a few days ago.\n\nThey said, yeah, it got canceled today.\n\nSo I felt like an idiot, to be honest, because I was standing there with this big mic stand that looks like a fishing rod.\n\nI got my box of equipment.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThis can't be a good omen, I thought, to mess up your first journalism assignment.\n\nBut then more people started showing up, confused like me, until a man in one of those safety vests swings around the corner, tells us to follow him and takes us up the street to a wedding hall, where everyone was gathering instead.\n\nIt's a lot of people, maybe over 100.\n\nAnd as I explained to Brian, while I'm setting up the microphone --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI start catching all the whispers in terms of what happened.\n\nAnd it turned out that the original venue had received phone calls from the national newspaper, specifically this guy, Nick Timothy.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHe's like a reporter or a publisher?\n\nOr what is he?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nHe's a columnist, I think, for The Telegraph.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAnd not just any old columnist.\n\nNick Timothy used to be the chief of staff to the prime minister.\n\nHe was essentially Theresa May's right-hand man.\n\nI spoke to the guy who ran the community center, who told me Nick Timothy had actually emailed, not called.\n\nHe wouldn't let me see the email, but according to others at the meeting, the implication was: If you hold this event, I will associate you with extremists in the newspaper. And the community center pulled the plug.\n\nNick Timothy denies contacting the community center, and says he doesn't know who did or what they said. But he wrote a triumphant column about the planned meeting -- which I'd missed, because I was on YouTube all day watching instructional videos on how to use my recorder -- in which he noted, quote: \"When the Daily Telegraph discovered this, and contacted the owners of the venue, they rightly cancelled it.\" He went on to suggest the event organizers .. were extremists.. and described the proposed meeting as, quote: “a shocking attempt to deny the Trojan Horse scandal.” And, quote: “The people behind Trojan Horse are trying to do it all over again, and right under our noses.”\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nGood evening, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nAnd welcome to Trojan Horse or Hoax, the discussion and debate.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSo here they were, the teachers and school volunteers allegedly behind Operation Trojan Horse, along with their defenders, academics and activists and an educational barrister and a union leader packed in this wedding hall instead.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nI am really, really concerned that simply holding a public, open meeting like this becomes controversial.\n\nJust the fact we are holding this meeting seems to be an act of resistance right now.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe people at this meeting called for an inquiry to correct the record on the Trojan Horse affair.\n\nThey believe the government had set them up, to the fact that a former chief of staff to the prime minister, Nick Timothy, went out of his way to attack a grassroots event at a community center, years after the Trojan horse affair.\n\nIt just reinforced their suspicion, and mine, quite honestly, that there was something dodgy the authorities were still keen to hide.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nAnd then it was like a witch hunt.\n\nHeads were rolling this way and that way.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHamza sent me the recording of the meeting.\n\nI listened to it, and I was interested to hear that one of the people who got on stage and spoke was the man named repeatedly in the Trojan Horse letter as the mastermind of Operation Trojan Horse, the plot's alleged ringleader, a longtime school volunteer named Tahir Alam.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (TAHIR ALAM)\n\nI've never been a danger to anyone.\n\nI've never hurt anyone.\n\nI've never had any police case against me or anything of the kind.\n\nI wasn't running a plot.\n\nWe are very proud of what we did --\n\nI do not regret nor apologize for anything that I've done.\n\nThere was nothing clandestine, hidden, or sinister about what we were doing.\n\nWe're very open and very transparent.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSo when I landed in Birmingham to begin reporting, that's who we decided to go to first, to hear Alam.\n\nWe figured, we're looking to find the source of this mysterious letter.\n\nMight as well start with the guy it outed as an extremist plotter.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nIs this about to be the first radio interview you've ever done?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nYeah.\n\nI need to be schooled beforehand, mate.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nLike, how so?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWell, I mean, if this is me flying solo, I'd be like, well, whatever.\n\nI'll just do it my style, you know?\n\nBut this is -- you know.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd what is your style?\n\nDo you have a style?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI don't know.\n\nI feel like I'm a lot --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHow many of these have you done?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nNone.\n\nBut I have an idea in my head of what my style could be.\n\nI think you're a lot more sensitive than I am, put it that way.\n\nDo you know what I mean?\n\nLike, you're --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nI'm the more sensitive one?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI think so.\n\nDon't you think so?\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nI don't know.\n\nI don't know you that well.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI wonder what he will be wearing.\n\nSalaam, Tahir.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nSalaam.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSalaam.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nHello.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHello.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nIll-fitting button-down shirt, khakis.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWelcome.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThank you.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe're going to be in that room there.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThis room?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nSo.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWe kick off our shoes.\n\nHe shows us to a room at the front of his place.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nSorry you have to sit on slightly uncomfortable chairs there.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHamza and I squeeze behind two school desks meant for children.\n\nThere are protractors lying around, a whiteboard with sketches of geometric shapes, a creative writing workbook titled, Descriptosaurus.\n\nTahir's converted this room from his garage into a tiny makeshift classroom, where it appears he tutored students quietly, because one result of the Trojan Horse letter is that the government has banned him from ever volunteering or working officially in schools again.\n\nTahir's in front of us in his office chair, confident, erudite, framed by his bookshelf filled with texts about Islam and British history.\n\nI pull a copy of the letter out of my backpack.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nIt's a completely anonymous letter, undated, claiming that there is a plot to take over and Islamize the schools in Birmingham led by Tahir Alam, which is myself.\n\nBut I speak from a vantage point where I actually know the truth.\n\nI know the reality.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nTahir denies being an extremist.\n\nHe denies engineering a plot.\n\nHe says the reality is that rather than corrupting schools as a radical conspirator, he, a first generation immigrant from a poor Pakistani family, was responsible for one of the most miraculous school turnarounds in British education, until, he says, the letter arrived and destroyed him.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe story of this turnaround, it's not a secret.\n\nIt's one Tahir has shared with journalists before, not that it's done him much good in terms of clearing his name.\n\nBut this backstory does explain why the Trojan Horse letter was so persuasive because, Tahir told us, some of what was in that letter was true.\n\nTahir begins the story one night in 1993, when he's watching TV, and a show caught his attention.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI just happened to be just lying on the sofa, really, and the program came on.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIt was a documentary, part of the BBC series, Panorama.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nNine times out of 10, I would switch to something else.\n\nBut I was just sitting there, and I started watching.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nBritain's new underclass is Asian and it's Muslim.\n\nA once tightly knit community is now in crisis with drug abuse, crime, and family breakdown on the increase.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAnd the title of this documentary was Underclass in Purdah.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nIn tonight's Panorama, we investigate an underclass in purdah.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nPurdah meaning cover, meaning a veil, if you like.\n\nUnderclass in the veil, you know?\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nIn tonight's program, we lift the veil on this new underclass.\n\nA report from --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe documentary opens with shots of brown men skulking around dark, cobblestone streets in a Muslim neighborhood, in what the correspondent calls the \"Muslim ghetto.\"\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nAt night, it doubles as the local red light district.\n\nIt's a seedy world of vice and illicit drug dealing.\n\nLurking in the shadows is a new Manningham phenomenon --\n\nthe Pakistani pimp.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nHe's like a regular pimp, but in a kurta.\n\nPart of the documentary takes place in Tahir's neighborhood in Birmingham called Alum Rock, on the east side of the city.\n\nIt's one of the poorest areas in England and is majority Pakistani and Muslim.\n\nIf you're not from Birmingham and you're not brown, you may have heard that Alum Rock is a great place to find a terrorist.\n\nIf you're not from Birmingham and you are brown, you'll have heard Alum Rock is a great place to find a wedding dress.\n\nAdmittedly, this BBC documentary is racist in a '90s TV kind of way, but it had a big impact on Tahir because amidst the awkward brown-gazing, some truly sobering facts emerged.\n\nThe presenter reports that Pakistani Muslims are incarcerated at disproportionately high rates.\n\nShe says they have some of the highest rates of joblessness.\n\nThey're suffering from devastating health issues, terrible housing, domestic violence, with one underlying cause of it all --\n\na lack of education.\n\nThis is the number I found most shocking --\n\nabout 20% of white students were leaving school without any qualifications, meaning they failed to pass exams that would essentially be the equivalent of a high school diploma in the US.\n\nAnd that rate, 20%, was roughly the same for most people of color as well.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nBut for Pakistanis and Bangladeshis, an astonishing 50% hold no qualifications whatsoever.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\n50%, half of us, were basically failing school.\n\nThat hit Tahir hard.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThat the extent of education failure was so bad that we were at risk of creating an underclass of Muslims, who were, basically, uneducated, prone to crime and unemployment.\n\nSo I kind of sat there, and it made me feel guilty, actually, guilt because I was one of the few people who made it from my family, one of the first ones to make it to university and to have a good job and so on.\n\nBut there was also a sense of humiliation, really, because I was from this community.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nTahir's family brought him to England in the '70s, when lots of people from Kashmir were moving here, largely because the British designed this huge dam that flooded swaths of land and displaced tens of thousands of people.\n\nAnd one solution the Brits got behind was to invite displaced Pakistanis over to England so they could improve the British economy by working in British factories and mills, which is what Tahir's dad did.\n\nTahir arrived in England as a nine-year-old who didn't speak any English and wouldn't become fluent for several years.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI knew one word of English only, which was F-O-R-D. I mean, I don't know X, Y, Z, but I know F-O-R-D. That's it.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI can relate.\n\nI couldn't speak any English when I first came here.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAll right.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI couldn't even speak Ford.\n\nI was just like, mute.\n\nFootball -- that's what I knew -- football.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThat's right.\n\nSo that's how we arrived here.\n\nAnd the first school, when I came here, we arrived --\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\n-- country is growing up angry and alienated from white society.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nNow Tahir watched as the documentary captured the next generation --\n\nPakistani kids who were born in Britain, being educated in state schools, still struggling to read, not able to recall basic English words.\n\nThe camera cuts to a park in Birmingham.\n\nIt looked to Tahir like Ward End Park, which is right across from where he went to school in Alum Rock.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI recognized the park.\n\nWe used to go and play there.\n\nAnd then I saw some children, and I said, oh, that's our neighbor's children.\n\nI recognized the kids there, even though it was from a distance.\n\nBut I recognized who the kids are.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nWe filmed an encounter with two Asian lads in a park in a Muslim quarter of Birmingham.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThese Asian lads --\n\nwe use Asian to mean South Asian, by the way --\n\nthey're skipping school.\n\nAnd Tahir knew which school they were skipping.\n\nIt's the one he'd gone to as a kid, right next to that park --\n\nPark View School, another majority Muslim school with miserable academic results.\n\nIt's a secondary school, ages 11 to 16.\n\nIt was a school where Tahir had done well enough to make it to college and then university before getting a good job in telecommunications.\n\nThe documentary made him realize how rare his success was and how little he'd done with it.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSo Tahir decided to do something.\n\nHe started a tutoring program for kids in the neighborhood, but what he was really interested in was volunteering at his old school, Park View, on what's known as their governing body.\n\nIn England, a governing body oversees how a school is run, like a corporate board does a company.\n\nIt's sort of like a school board in the US, except it's specific to one school.\n\nThey can have a lot of influence.\n\nSo anyway, Tahir says one afternoon, a couple of Park View parents he didn't know knocked on his door.\n\nWe hear you're interested in becoming a governor, they said.\n\nIt was like they'd read his mind, though, actually, Tahir had been talking about wanting to be a governor at a recent wedding, and these parents got wind of it.\n\nResentment and frustration had been festering for years among parents in Alum Rock, who'd been trying and trying to get the authorities to do something about the dismal schools.\n\nThese parents at Tahir's door had joined the Park View governing body in an attempt to make a change, but they didn't speak fluent English and hadn't gone to university.\n\nTahir was a professional with a degree who still lived in the neighborhood.\n\nWe'd love to propose you, they told him.\n\nAnd with that, Tahir found himself at the next governing body meeting of Park View School, being voted in not only as a member, but as the chair.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nSo that's when I became a governor on the 7th of January, 1997.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou remember the date?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYeah, well, I was to remain there for 18 years.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhen Tahir started, Park View was one of the worst secondary schools in the country.\n\nOnly 4% of students were passing --\n\n4%.\n\nThe National School Inspection Agency had recently placed the school into special measures, the lowest possible ranking, an emergency status, basically, meaning Park View was in danger of being shut down.\n\nThere were brawls breaking out in the schoolyard.\n\nOn a tour of the building, Tahir saw vandalized bathrooms, with stalls missing locks and toilets missing seats.\n\nBut where Tahir really trained his focus was on the complacent teachers and administrators.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe initially just started by saying that, obviously, children should be achieving higher, that the achievement was not acceptable, and the fact that the school was to blame for the failure.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThis statement, so obvious to Tahir, that the kids in Alum Rock were as capable as kids anywhere was met with massive resistance.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nIt was very difficult getting the school to accept that they were the problem.\n\nPeople didn't want to accept that because they had been blaming the community for maybe two decades.\n\nThey had such a low expectation of children.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nOne thing Tahir noticed early on was that the staff of this school with nearly 90% Pakistani students had only one full-time Pakistani Muslim teacher.\n\nSo Tahir began searching for more Muslim staff and governors.\n\nHe gave presentations, held workshops.\n\nHe became a fixture at events around East Birmingham, standing behind his little table or booth, evangelizing for people to get involved in their local schools.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nI loved it.\n\nI loved it with the children because I felt as though I could make a difference.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThis is Moz Hussain, the first Muslim teacher Tahir hired.\n\nHe taught math.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nI could use my language, my background, my understanding of where they come from, to make a difference.\n\nI knew their families.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nMoz can point to a specific moment, by the way, when he decided to go into teaching.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nThere's a Panorama program.\n\nIt's called an Underclass in Purdah.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nPowerful segment.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nMoz Hussain says from the very beginning, he encountered serious prejudices among the mostly white staff.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nI had a group of children come to me, and they said, look, there's this one teacher in school.\n\nHe always calls us Pakis.\n\nHe's calling us Pakis.\n\nHe's doing it in a jokey way, but we find it offensive.\n\nThey're not able to tell anyone else, but they're telling me that, look, he's swearing at us.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThat's a slur in any context, but especially shocking for a teacher to say to Pakistani students.\n\nMoz told them, I think the best thing to do, have your parents write to the school.\n\nHe talked them through the procedure for doing that, in case their parents didn't know.\n\nHe says eventually, the school looked into the teacher's behavior.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nAnd while they're investigating, he resigned.\n\nAnd he gave his final leaving speech in the staff room and goes, it should be our culture dominant in this school, not the kids'.\n\nAnd he finished off with the words, \"The West is the best,\" and all teachers clapped.\n\nAll teachers clapped.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe racism was pervasive.\n\nRazwan Faraz, a former governor and math teacher, says at one of his first governing body meetings, he was shown a list of places the students had been given work placements through a program at the school.\n\nAnd it was all restaurants, supermarkets, clothing stores.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nAnd there was no surgery, doctor surgery, or law firm, or anything like that.\n\nAnd I said, how is it that --\n\ndid the children decide these?\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd Razwan says the vice chair told him --\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nWell, their parents want them to go and become doctors and engineers and et cetera.\n\nBut the reality is these kids will become taxi drivers, shopkeepers, so we've got to prepare them now.\n\nAnd for a good while, I was struggling to process what he was saying.\n\nThis is me, a brown person, a Muslim, and he's saying to me that they deserve to have these kind of jobs.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThis is this community's role in society.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nThat's right.\n\nThat's right.\n\nJOHN BROCKLEY\n\nWe just failed the kids.\n\nWe just failed the kids, and didn't even feel bad about it.\n\nDidn't even -- we didn't!\n\nWe didn't even feel guilty!\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nJohn Brockley was one of the non-Muslim teachers at Park View.\n\nHe was a math teacher who'd been there since the '80s.\n\nHe was frank with us about the bigotry that he and his colleagues held towards the students and their families.\n\nJOHN BROCKLEY\n\nWe thought that we were a superior culture.\n\nAnd we looked down.\n\nWe looked down on these people who didn't know about education.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou're talking about yourself here?\n\nJOHN BROCKLEY\n\nI'm talking to you about myself, but I'm also talking about many of the people that I worked with.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe teachers attitudes are documented, by the way.\n\nA former head teacher of Park View -- a head teacher is what we Americans call a principal --\n\ndid a master's thesis while he was at the school for which he collected opinions from the staff, including from John, as to why Muslim children were drastically underperforming compared to their peers.\n\nIn the thesis, teachers say the kids' parents are ignorant, wrongly claim the students don't speak English.\n\nThe teachers try for a while, one teacher said, but end up feeling like, \"Who gives a damn?\"\n\nThat's a quote.\n\nIt makes John cringe to think back on it.\n\nJOHN BROCKLEY\n\nIt's only when you move away from a situation like that, that you can realize how awful it is.\n\nI don't normally think about this sort of thing because it's too embarrassing.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nOnce we created the shift in the belief of the teachers, then the job became much easier.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nTahir says by the early 2000s, Park View was changing.\n\nThe school began taking basic, but transformative steps, setting individualized achievement targets for each student, to follow them from year to year, and preparing students for qualifying exams, which, amazingly, hadn't happened before.\n\nThe school started awarding trophies for good marks, inviting parents to ceremonies when their kids did well.\n\nTahir and the governors hire a new head teacher, a non-Muslim woman from a girls' school, who embraced Park View's new aspirations.\n\nTest scores started to rise.\n\nStudents were heading to college.\n\nPark View's reputation was turning around.\n\nBut there were other changes Tahir instituted at Park View, which, later, officials would view as suspect, changes that investigators would point to as the trademarks of Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nThat's coming up.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou don't get labeled the leader of an extremist conspiracy simply by raising test scores at your neighborhood secondary school.\n\nThe main accusation against Tahir Alam, the overarching assertion of the Trojan Horse letter, which the government supported and which has defined Tahir's reputation since then, is that he was \"Islamizing\" schools.\n\nThis is not a word I'm particularly fond of, \"Islamize,\" because Islamize in relation to what?\n\nSome assumed non-Islamic baseline?\n\nHas this story been Islamized by Hamza's involvement?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nYes.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nIt's a word that isn't inherently negative, but gets used that way.\n\nAnyway, that's what the letter said Tahir was doing --\n\nIslamizing schools.\n\nAnd funnily enough, it's also what Tahir says he was doing.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe were valuing the cultural and the faith background of the children.\n\nAnd we were allowing that to be expressed, if you like.\n\nWe catered for children so they could perform their daytime prayers if they wanted to.\n\nWe made a prayer facility available for them in a room.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nReligious accommodations like this are legal in British schools, by the way, whether they're explicitly designated as a religious school or not, which Park View wasn't.\n\nIt was the equivalent of a regular public school in the US.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAnd since 98% of the children happen to be of the Islamic faith background, we obviously are catering for the constituency that the school serves, in line with the regulatory requirements.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nTahir ascribed to an educational philosophy that, the way he and other Park View staff talk about it, reminds me of Afrocentric or Black excellent schools in the US, that students will do better academically when their schools incorporate and celebrate who they are.\n\nAnd there's research that backs this up.\n\nSo under Tahir's leadership, Park View allowed students to pray if they wanted.\n\nThey installed facilities for wudu, the ablutions you do before prayers.\n\nThey celebrated Ramadan and altered the schedule during that month to facilitate fasting.\n\nThey served halal food.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAnd I felt that this was our school.\n\nI mean, we were proud to say that this is our school.\n\nWe wanted our children to say that this was their school and that they were proud of it.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIn the wake of the Trojan Horse letter, government officials would declare that the way Tahir and his colleagues were running Park View School had undermined, quote unquote, \"British values,\" that they were limiting the children's ability to thrive in modern Britain,\n\nwhich is an interesting charge to bring against Tahir because I have to say, I haven't personally met an English Pakistani more confident that he's British than Tahir.\n\nDeciding whether or not to call yourself British is a fraught and personal thing for us.\n\nSpeaking for myself, even though I came to England when I was eight and became a British citizen with a British passport, even though I have a British education, went to British University, worked for Britain's National Health Service, I didn't call myself British.\n\nI was never precious about nationality, so I didn't really care what I was called.\n\nBut sure, I'd also picked up on the subliminal messaging that in order to be proper British, you had to be white.\n\nTahir, on the other hand, not only calls himself British, but does so proudly.\n\nI got to talking to Tahir about this one day.\n\nHe and Brian and I were getting tea at my favorite chai shop on an Alum Rock road.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThis is the hangout.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAnd as we sat outside on one of the main thoroughfares of Islamic Britain, around the corner from where Tahir grew up, with double decker buses passing by sweet shops and fabric stores and halal chippies, I told him my reason for why I'd finally, only recently,\n\nstarted calling myself British.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSo for a long time, I never called myself British.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI was about 30.\n\nI'd been reading a book about the British empire.\n\nAnd I learned how rich India, which, at the time, included Pakistan, was.\n\nAccording to some economists, before the British took control --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI believe the statistic is, roughly, it controlled about 24% or something like that of the world's economy at the time.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYeah, 23% of the world's economy, yeah.\n\nIt was the richest nation in the world.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nRight.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\n24% of the world's economy is roughly what the U.S. controls today.\n\nI know this is somewhat of an apples and oranges comparison because the world wasn't organized into a globalized economy back then, but it does show how rich India was in relation to other countries at the time.\n\nWhen the British left the Indian subcontinent after some 200 years of economic exploitation, India and Pakistan were among the poorest nations in the world.\n\nI didn't learn this stuff in school because Britain's colonization of a quarter of the planet is not a compulsory part of the national curriculum, which is why I only discovered it as an adult, that so much of the wealth I saw in Britain was actually extracted from the place I come from.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAnd so from that point onwards, I've started calling myself British.\n\nI was just like, well, I'm British.\n\nI own this country.\n\nThis is my money with which you have raised everything around me.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYeah, so I mean, that's very similar to the position I am arrived at.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nExcept, for me, proclaiming I'm British is somewhat of a finger in the eye.\n\nFor Tahir, it's sincere.\n\nIt also came to him later in life.\n\nHe says, he was at an event held by a British Muslim organization, and they began saying very clearly, you're never going back to Pakistan.\n\nYour children are never going to move back.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nIt's not going to happen.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThat's what you had been thinking of to that point.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYeah, because our parents spoke like that to us.\n\nOur homes are in Pakistan.\n\nWe are Pakistani.\n\nOur parents spoke to us like that.\n\nMy father never told me we are British.\n\nBecause that's not what he felt. He lived in Pakistan most of his life.\n\nWhy would he say that?\n\nSo --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe people at this event were saying, you live here now.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe were part of this country and that it was important, as Muslims, we should benefit to this country.\n\nAnd so ever since then, I've been kind of dissing the idea that we are other, that we are outsiders, that we don't belong here.\n\nIslam is part of Britain.\n\nIt's not alien.\n\nI don't accept that.\n\nCan you see?\n\nSo this is why --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSo for Tahir, not only was incorporating Islam into the school an academic strategy, it was also a British value.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nIt was really nice for me that --\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nIt was during school --\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\n-- I'm doing something at home and now my school is helping me do it.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nYeah, I didn't want to have a different life at school.\n\nIf I'm praying at home, I want to pray at school, too, because --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThese are two students who graduated from Park View in 2014.\n\nWe're not using their names because such is the stink of the Trojan Horse scandal, they don't want potential employers to know where they went to school.\n\nThey actually keep it off their resumes.\n\nWhen Hamza and I met them four years after they graduated, they were both studying law at university, some of the first in their families to go on to higher education.\n\nThey've been best friends since school, the kind of friends who don't need words to communicate.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nAre you talking about --\n\nyeah.\n\nI don't know if I said --\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nOh, that.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nWe're telepathic, basically.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe students told us about these assemblies they would have in the mornings, which included religious teachings and sometimes prayer.\n\nThis is something that, as an American, made me do a double take when I first heard about it.\n\nThe idea of teachers in a public school leading prayers during assembly is not normal to us.\n\nBut in Britain, there's no separation between church and state.\n\nThe queen is head of both.\n\nSo not only is prayer allowed in schools, some form of worship is legally mandated in all schools that are publicly funded.\n\nSchools don't always adhere to this, but students are supposed to take part in what's called a daily act of collective worship.\n\nBy default, it's supposed to be broadly Christian in character, but schools can apply to change it to other faiths if that better suits their students, which is what Park View did.\n\nIt got approval for its worship to be Islamic.\n\nThe students told us at Park View's assemblies, they would sit in the main hall, and a teacher would tell parables or lessons, usually from Islam, but other faiths, too.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nDo you guys remember actually learning things in the assemblies, or did they make you think?\n\nOr were they just kind of boring teachers -- blah, blah, blah, blah --\n\nlike -- you know?\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nNo, they really made us think.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nYou know, I really enjoyed those assemblies because I didn't learn this from anywhere else.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThey still remember this one assembly all these years later about charity.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nTalking about charity, and they say, when you're giving charity, put your hand in your pocket and take out -- don't care how much you give in.\n\nJust put it in.\n\nDon't count what you're giving and what you have left because when you give, you receive tenfold.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nYeah, and charity does not make you poor.\n\nQuite literally, sometimes when I see somebody who is asking for money and things like that, I'll put my hand in in my purse.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nTake it out.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nI'll take it out, and I don't look at what's in it.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nYeah, I do that all the time.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nJust because I remember that one teacher.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nOne teacher.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nHe literally said it like that.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nLike that.\n\nGive so that your left hand doesn't even --\n\nSTUDENT 1 & STUDENT 2\n\n-- know what your right hand gave.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nYeah.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWhen Tahir became chair of Park View's governing body in 1997, 4% of students were passing.\n\nBy 2010, that number was 71%, a 17-fold increase.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe had not changed the children.\n\nWe had not changed the parents.\n\nBut slowly but surely, we took the results so that they were consistently in the 70s, which means the school actually is kind of guaranteeing an outcome.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nPark View was now actively preparing its students for the eventuality that their academic success would lead them out of East Birmingham.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nSomething that a lot of teachers said to me, you live in a bubble.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAgain, the former Park View students.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nAnd I was like, what do you mean?\n\nThey were like, you live in an Asian community.\n\nYou go to an Asian school.\n\nYou're very safe.\n\nYou don't know what it's like to branch out.\n\nI remember we learned about the population and how it's divided in UK.\n\nAnd I think it was something like 2% of the population in the UK is Asian.\n\nAnd I was like, wow, only 2%?\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nIt seems like a lot more.\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nI was like 2%?\n\nHow is it 2%?\n\nEverybody I know is Asian.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nEvery person that I've come across is Brown.\n\nHow is that possible?\n\nSTUDENT 1\n\nSo it was so odd.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe UK is actually 2% Pakistani, 7% Asian.\n\nThe point being, there was a vast majority of the population that these students and their classmates were not bumping into day-to-day in Alum Rock.\n\nThe school organized visits to Cambridge University.\n\nThey took them on camping trips.\n\nThey visited the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nSome students went on a week-long trip on a sailboat with kids from all over, including a bunch of white kids.\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nApparently we weren't used to mingling with people who were not Pakistani.\n\nSo they were exposing us to you guys.\n\nOK.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou're looking at me?\n\nSTUDENT 2\n\nThis is what they were preparing us for.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nParents clamored to get their kids into Park View.\n\nThe school had a waiting list.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWe were given all kinds of accolades nationally in the press.\n\nWe had officials coming in and out of our school, really.\n\nThey're saying, what are you doing?\n\nPerhaps we can learn something.\n\nAnd they invited us actually that why don't you support other schools?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nTahir became well regarded in education circles.\n\nAnd over the years, he expanded his reach beyond Park View.\n\nHe was certified as an inspector for Ofsted, the agency that monitors and rates schools in Britain.\n\nThe Birmingham City Council hired him to train other governors throughout the city.\n\nThe National Department for Education even asked Tahir and his colleagues at Park View to take over two other troubled schools in East Birmingham, which they did.\n\nTahir was invited to tea at 10 Downing Street and met Prime Minister Tony Blair.\n\nBack in Birmingham, though, some people resented him.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nYeah, he had made enemies of a lot of schools in the area.\n\nHe became hated amongst a lot of people.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nMoz Hussain, who became Park View's acting headteacher around this time, was in full support of Tahir's, but still, he and other former colleagues told us they wished Tahir was a bit more circumspect in the way he went around to other schools, advocating for reform.\n\nHe was self-assured, blunt, and particularly unsparing when laying out for head teachers and other school leaders the way their schools were failing Muslim students.\n\nMOZ HUSSAIN\n\nTo tell other schools, look, Park View can do it.\n\nPark View can do it.\n\nPark View can do it.\n\nSame family, same children that you got.\n\nThey can do it.\n\nThat's not an excuse.\n\nWe used to tell Tahir off for this a lot.\n\nStop using us as a beating stick because it's isolating us amongst other schools.\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nHe was actually pointing the finger and saying directly to head teachers, you're not doing a good enough job here for these kids.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nJackie Hughes used to be in charge of school improvement for the Birmingham City Council.\n\nAnd she says she can name head teachers that she knows Tahir made enemies with.\n\nMany of them were used to having the final word on academics.\n\nAnd then here was Tahir, this volunteer with no professional teaching experience, waltzing in and criticizing their work.\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nI mean, actually, people come to me and say, I can't understand why you give Tahir the time of day.\n\nHe's a terrible man.\n\nHe said to me, blah, blah, blah, blah.\n\nAnd they would go sounding off.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nColleagues and friends warned Tahir, you might want to consider softening your approach.\n\nBut Tahir wasn't having it.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYou have to fight for justice.\n\nJustice is not going to be handed to you on the plate.\n\nYou have to make space for yourself.\n\nSo the fact that some people may not be OK with that is irrelevant to me.\n\nThat's their problem.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIn 2012, Park View received the ultimate validation and what was probably its proudest moment in Tahir's nearly 18 years there.\n\nOfsted arrived for an inspection and deemed the school outstanding, the highest rating possible.\n\nAmong the many things inspectors praised at Park View were the, quote, \"wide range of opportunities for spiritual development, including voluntary Friday prayers.\"\n\nIn his time as chair of governors, Tahir had taken Park View from the lowest ranking, the verge of closure, to the very top.\n\nThe person in charge of Ofsted, the chief inspector, said, quote, \"Every school in the country should be like this.\"\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nLess than two years later, on November 27, 2013, an envelope arrived on the desk of the leader of Birmingham City Council, a man named Sir Albert Bore.\n\nInside was a cover sheet addressed to him, marked, \"Very important, confidential.\"\n\nMr. Bore, it said, this letter was found when I was clearing my boss's files.\n\nAnd I think you should be aware that I am shocked at what your officers are doing.\n\nYou have seven days to investigate this matter, after which it will be sent to a national newspaper, who I'm sure will treat it seriously.\n\nSincerely, AN -- anonymous, presumably.\n\nBehind that note was the Trojan Horse letter, four poorly copied pages, shadows at the edges, instructions to destroy after reading.\n\nThe letter was written as if from a collaborator of Tahir's, describing a conspiracy Tahir had been running to take over and Islamize schools by deception.\n\nIt took weeks for Tahir to learn about it.\n\nHe heard rumors there was a mysterious letter making its way around Birmingham, around the city council and to head teachers in town, which named him as the orchestrator of a plot.\n\nOne of Tahir's friends rushed to his house to tell him that he'd been getting a haircut over on Washwood Heath Road, and afterwards, his friend's barber had beckoned him into the back room of the shop and showed him a copy.\n\nTahir did not know what to make of it.\n\nFinally, he got a hold of the document himself.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nObviously, I was thinking, what is the source of this letter?\n\nWho wrote this letter?\n\nWhy was this letter written, is what's ringing in my head.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe front page was missing, so there was no, \"dear whoever.\"\n\nIt just started as if it had been going on for a page or more already.\n\nAnd the letter ended mid-sentence, too, with the phrase, \"I would also like,\" so there's no sign-off, which meant Tahi couldn't tell exactly who it was supposed to be to or from.\n\nBut whoever wrote the letter said explicitly, \"Tahir and I.\"\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nIt's supposed to be from somebody who knows me well in Birmingham.\n\nAnd he's talking to somebody in Bradford.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnother British city that's home to a lot of Muslims.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nHe's talking about Tahir, what he's done here, we can do it over there.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd he's your friend or your associate.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYeah, supposed to be.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nOr she, whoever.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWhoever it is, yeah.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nCan you keep reading just the first few paragraphs?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nOK, Operation Trojan Horse has been carefully thought through and is tried and tested within Birmingham.\n\nTahir and I would be happy to support your efforts in Bradford.\n\nThis is a long-term plan and one which we are sure will lead to great success in taking over a number of schools and ensuring that they are run on the strict Islamic principles.\n\nIn Birmingham, the benefits --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe main tactic of Operation Trojan Horse is to target headteachers at the schools you want to take control of, to make their lives so miserable, that they'll resign or else, be fired, at which point, you can install your own people, who will implant Islamic extremism in the school.\n\nThe author gives several examples of schools in Birmingham where Tahir and his cronies were supposedly in the middle of doing this.\n\n\"We have caused a great amount of organized disruption in Birmingham,\" the letter says, \"and are on the way to getting rid of more head teachers and taking over their schools.\n\nWhile sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things, you must remember that this is a jihad.\n\nAnd as such, using all means possible to win the war is acceptable.\"\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhat was your feeling or your attitude?\n\nWere you laughing at it?\n\nWere you actually kind of taking it seriously and frightened?\n\nWhat were --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI mean, the claims --\n\nI wasn't laughing actually because I knew the serious nature of the allegations that were being made.\n\nBut as far as the claims themselves were concerned, they were laughable.\n\nSo I knew that there was something not right about what was going on here.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nTahir contacted the Birmingham City Council, where the letter was first sent.\n\nHe'd done training for them for years.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAnd I said, look, I work for you.\n\nAnd this letter apparently is going around, claiming certain things.\n\nAnd I'm surprised that you haven't spoken to me to at least to get my view on the matter.\n\nAt least ask me to explain or if I know anything or whatever or something.\n\nAnd the gentleman there actually from the city council, he said, Mr. Alam, to be very honest with you, we don't think anything of the letter.\n\nWe think it's a completely bogus hoax letter.\n\nAnd we don't believe there is any truth in it.\n\nAnd therefore we didn't take any action.\n\nWe didn't do anything with it.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nDid you feel reassured by that, or how did you --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nNot really, no, because then the letter began to be printed in the national media as well.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSomeone leaked the letter to the Sunday Times of London.\n\nAnd from there, it became a frenzy.\n\nOne story turned to two, turned to dozens, in the Daily Mail, the Telegraph, the Spectator, Sky TV, many of them giving credence to the letter, saying that extremists like Tahir had allegedly been infiltrating UK schools for years.\n\nReporters camped outside Park View.\n\nThey stalked Tahir down the street --\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nWe tried to put these allegations to the Academy's chair of governors, but Tahir Alam --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\n-- turned up at his house.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (TAHIR ALAM)\n\nHello.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nHello, Mr. Alam.\n\nMr. Alam.\n\nHello?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe government kicked into gear to investigate the swarmed Park View.\n\nOfsted, the school inspector, arrived for two surprise inspections.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nAnd then we had the education funding agency investigation, which was about 10 days, I think.\n\nThey were in there for 10 days.\n\nAnd as soon as they left, we had the PWC --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers, a big outside auditing firm.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\n-- looking into the financial affairs of the school.\n\nSo then we had them for four or five weeks in the school as well.\n\nI said, what are you looking for?\n\nI said, what are you looking for?\n\nYou've been here three weeks.\n\nYou must have a family.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThere was more.\n\nThe secretary of state for education called in England's former counterterror chief from Scotland Yard, a man named Peter Clark.\n\nAnd the Birmingham City Council appointed its own special investigator, and they scrutinized Park View, along with 20 some odd other schools in Muslim neighborhoods.\n\nIn the middle of the melee, some politicians and journalists were saying that the letter itself was likely a hoax.\n\nThere were some obvious factual inaccuracies.\n\nYet the government believed it still warranted this action.\n\nHonestly, I don't think any authority explained this logic with much clarity at the time, but my understanding of how the thinking went, is that even if the letter itself wasn't an actual communiqué between two real life conspirators, it could still be pointing at a real problem.\n\nEven if it was fiction, the thinking went, the letter could have been fabricated by someone who had legitimate concerns about Muslim extremists scheming and wielding influence in schools.\n\nAnd maybe the letter was their creative way of raising an alarm.\n\nSo rather than look into who wrote the letter and why, instead, the government put out general public calls for information about these schools.\n\nAnd people started coming forward, mostly anonymously, with complaints.\n\nAgain, investigators found no evidence of radicalization, no evidence of violent extremism, and no plot.\n\nWhat emerged instead was a kind of grab bag of Islam adjacent allegations, many of the same things authorities had celebrated up to that point, but apparently now were seeing in a different light, like these educators weren't merely allowing students to pray --\n\nthey were pressuring them to pray.\n\nThey weren't innocently recruiting brown Muslim staff --\n\nthey were hiring their buddies, who thought the same way as they did, and possibly discriminating against non-Muslim candidates in the process.\n\nSchool governors, including Tahir, they weren't holding head teachers to a high standard.\n\nThey were pressuring them, harassing them, and exercising more power than a governor was supposed to.\n\nInvestigators also said they'd found instances of intolerance towards LGBTQ people and unequal treatment of women and girls.\n\nThey said Park View had held assemblies and invited speakers with anti-Western views, and that Tahir and people aligned with him allegedly subscribed to, quote, \"an intolerant and politicized form of extreme social conservatism that claims to represent and ultimately seeks to control all Muslims.\"\n\nAll of this, as the then secretary of state for education put it, as she presented the findings on the Trojan Horse letter to parliament, meant that students --\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nInstead of enjoying a broadening and enriching experience at school, young people are having their horizons narrowed and are being denied the opportunity to flourish in a modern, multicultural Britain.\n\nIt is for this reason and with a deep sense of injustice and sadness that today, we are announcing our intention to resign our positions at Park View Educational Trust and allow new members to assume responsibility.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAfter months of scrutiny, in early July 2014, Tahir, looking tired and stressed, stood at a lectern outside Park View's gates and resigned.\n\nTahir told us he and the other Park View governors only agreed to do that because the Department for Education promised that the head teacher and other on the ground leadership at the school would be kept in place.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nBut soon as school opened in September, all of those people were suspended.\n\nAll the leadership was basically sacked, ruthlessly.\n\nThey went about destroying their careers, destroying their reputations and they did that systematically.\n\nWe had worked for 10, 15 years, really, to build this school.\n\nThey destroyed it within months.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe government renamed the school.\n\nIt's no longer Park View.\n\nIt also notified nearly every teacher and governor you just heard from, Tahir included, that it was bringing proceedings to ban them from education for the rest of their lives.\n\nIn the years since, student achievement has plummeted at the school formerly known as Park View, from more than 70% passing to, in recent years, from the low 40% to mid 50% range.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSo that's the story Tahir told us, that first meeting in his makeshift teaching room, that this letter, which was never fully investigated, that described a plot called Operation Trojan Horse, which is never found to have existed, inspired all of this --\n\nthe ruining of careers and an educational movement, the fear mongering headlines against Muslims that continue to this day, the government instituting policies that encourage us to spy more brazenly on each other.\n\nWe've been talking with Tahir for a couple of hours by this point.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhat time is it?\n\nI know you need to leave at some point.\n\nI don't want to --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI mean, I have to go to Friday prayer now.\n\nSo 1 o'clock, I'm there, really.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nI understand there's a lot to talk, so if you wanted to --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThere's a lot to --\n\nno, no, I don't get tired of talking these things, really.\n\nI mean, you probably could tell.\n\nObviously, when I talk about that, you begin to relive it, isn't it?\n\nAnd I have to say that it does sadden me, actually, as what has been lost for the children, for the community, the irreparable damage that has been done, for absolutely no reason whatsoever.\n\nSo, anyway, can I get you guys some tea or something?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAt that event I went to, where we all got redirected to the wedding hall, one of the speakers, a columnist named Peter Oborne, put it well.\n\nHe said Operation Trojan Horse has become a \"social fact\" in Britain.\n\nThat even though within weeks of the Trojan Horse letter hitting the news, people acknowledged it was probably a hoax, that's never seemed to matter.\n\nWhether Muslims in Birmingham were conspiring or not doesn't matter.\n\nThe intimation that they were has persevered, to the extent that the prime minister's former chief of staff was outraged that some people in the community center would dare to say otherwise.\n\nBut we don't need to settle for a social fact because there are actual facts.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWhy, up to this point, has no one cared about who wrote this letter and where this letter came from?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nWell, that's my question.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThat's my question.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThis is what I've been arguing.\n\nThis is why I went to the police to see what they could do.\n\nThis is what I wrote in my letter to the Birmingham City Council, that you need to get to the bottom of who wrote the letter.\n\nThis is what I wrote to the Department of Education as well.\n\nYou need to get to the bottom of the letter.\n\nWho wrote the letter?\n\nBecause that will then unravel why the letter was written.\n\nYou see?\n\nSo this is what I have been arguing, but the Department of Education is not interested.\n\nThe police are not interested.\n\nThe Birmingham City Council is not interested in answering that question.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWhy?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nBecause they have used this letter.\n\nAnd on this hoax, they have built so much policy.\n\nDo you think now they want to launch an investigation into the letter to have it proven that it was written for completely different reasons?\n\nYeah?\n\nHow would that make them look like?\n\nA bunch of monkeys.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAs I've been saying, if you could just find out who wrote that letter and why, that's the only thing that might change Britain's understanding of Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nBut whoever wrote the letter, they knew me, I think.\n\nAnd I like to think that I know them, too.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nDoes that mean you think --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI have a strong hunch as to who wrote the letter.\n\nI strongly believe that I know who wrote the letter.\n\nAnd I strongly believe that I know that why was the letter was written as well.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSo you think you know the who and the motive.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nYes.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThat's

children's school desks.\n\nWe're in a the covert classroom, at the front of Tahir Alam's house, talking about the Trojan Horse letter, those four pages that painted Tahir as the ringleader of an extremist plot.\n\nTahir clearly has strong suspicions about who wrote it.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThe motive was quite an interesting one.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nEven though the plot wasn't real, the Trojan Horse letter still prompted authorities to investigate and ultimately dismantle the education movement Tahir was leading, a successful movement.\n\nOutcomes for Muslim students had improved dramatically.\n\nThe national government also beefed up counter-extremism policy, and tried to prevent Tahir and his colleagues from ever working or volunteering in schools again, all in the aftermath of the letter.\n\nTahir believes if they'd ever bothered just to investigate who wrote the thing, it would have been very difficult for the government to justify its actions.\n\nBecause, he says, it would have been obvious the letter had nothing to do with a conspiracy, or with him.\n\nHe's sparse on details with us this first day, but he does give us that tantalizing hint that the letter came from someone close to him.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nBut whoever wrote the letter, they knew --\n\nyou know, they knew me, I think.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nOr possibly more than one person.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWere they from Birmingham?\n\nWere they involved --\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThey're from Birmingham.\n\nThey are well-known to me.\n\nI know them quite well.\n\nAnd they know me quite well too.\n\nI know them, and I meet them often, you know, in an educational kind of environment and setting.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nIs there a reason we're playing 20 questions here?\n\nCan we just ask you who it is?\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nBecause I'm not able to -- obviously, I don't want to name anyone, because I can't prove that.\n\nI'll give you a clue.\n\nIf you read the letter just from a literary point of view --\n\njust read the letter.\n\nAnd all you have to do is --\n\nwho is being defended?\n\nJust read the letter with that in mind.\n\nWho is the letter defending is the question you have to answer.\n\nAnd you will arrive at your own judgment.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nFrom Serial Productions and The New York Times, I'm Brian Reed.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI'm Hamza Syed\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nLet's see if we can figure out who wrote the Trojan Horse letter.\n\n[THEME MUSIC]\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAll right, you want to do this?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOK, so let's move these drawers.\n\nWe're going to have to drag it up.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWe need a place to hunker down, a place to scrutinize the letter, a place to think, a place to throw names on the wall.\n\nWe need a headquarters.\n\nAnd for this purpose, Hamza has generously offered up his parents' bedroom.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOK, we're going to lay the things on top, because they kill the vibe.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHamza's has been crashing in his parents' old flat here in Birmingham.\n\nThey live in Abu Dhabi these days, and are planning to retire to Pakistan, so I guess they're not here that much.\n\nI hope not, because we're completely rearranging their bedroom --\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOh my God.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\n-- pushing the bed up against the closet, sliding the bureau into the corner, packing away Hamza's mom's jewelry at his insistence.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou want no reminder that this is your parents' bedroom?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nMate, I'm serious about this.\n\nIt's headquarters.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nDo you have a toolbox?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nYeah.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nClearly, being in England, sleuthing for the author of a mysterious letter alongside a doctor was having an effect on Brian.\n\nHe was going fully into Sherlock Holmes mode.\n\nHe detached the TV from the wall, and replaced it with whiteboards, a corkboard, and multi-colored note cards, which were connected with string.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSuccess.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI didn't have the heart to tell him that Sherlock didn't really do the whole murder wall thing.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhat are you seriously going to do if your parents come?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nI'll just tell them sleep in a different room, you know what I mean?\n\nLike --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nReally?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nNo, I mean, we'll figure that out when they come in.\n\nShall I get the Hoover?\n\n[VACUUM RUNNING]\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHQ was ready.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOperation Trojan Horse had been very carefully thought through, and is tried and tested within Birmingham.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHamza sat in his parent's bed and read the letter aloud, as I paced around, scribbling names and schools on the white boards, circling some, crossing off others.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHT Springfield.\n\nOK.\n\nKeep moving.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAll right.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nTahir had told us, read the letter and think about who is it defending?\n\nThat word choice seemed deliberate -- defending.\n\nRemember, the whole conceit of the letter is that it's written as if it's from an accomplice of Tahir's in Birmingham to a co-conspirator in another city, describing how they can start implementing this plot Tahir had devised, called Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nThe author of the letter breaks the plan into five steps, all aimed at pushing out headteachers -- what they call principals in Britain --\n\nso you can bring in your own leadership, who will make the school more Islamic.\n\nYou're supposed to get conservative Muslim parents to give the headteacher a hard time about classes such as sex ed, install a sympathetic governor on the governing body to basically spy on the head from there, find staff to complain about the headteacher from within the school.\n\nBut the author also explains what Tahir and his co-conspirators are currently up to in Birmingham.\n\nThe author names four headteachers at four specific schools who the plotters are on the verge of successfully unseating, and explains how they're pulling it off.\n\nAt one school, they'd framed the head for doctoring test scores, and now she was under investigation.\n\nAt another, they'd instigated a nasty fight over one of the headteacher's disciplinary decisions.\n\nAt another, they'd accused the headteacher of fraud.\n\nThese schools and head teachers named in the letter were all real, by the way, and so were the scandals the letter described, or at least the gist of them.\n\nEach of these headteachers had been in actual trouble in real life, for doctoring test scores, facing allegations of fraud, et cetera.\n\nWhat the letter claimed, though, was that these weren't random incidents of supposed wrongdoing.\n\nInstead, the letter claimed all these incidents were the result of the Trojan Horse conspiracy run by Tahir Alam and his cronies.\n\nTherefore, it was these headteachers who we think Tahir meant when he told us to consider who the letter defends.\n\nBecause in real life, these four teachers really had been at risk of losing their jobs.\n\nAnd then the Trojan Horse letter showed up, suggesting they hadn't actually done anything wrong, that they were victims, in fact, of Operation Trojan Horse.\n\nPresumably, one of them could have written the Trojan Horse letter to help themselves get out of trouble.\n\nSo I list these heads on our detective wall.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWe've narrowed it down to --\n\nwe've got the headteacher at Regents Park community school, the headteacher at Adderley, the headteacher at Saltley school, and the headteacher from Springfield school.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWe take a step back and stare at the board pensively, beard-strokingly, as the cogs turn in my partner's brain.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOh.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAs my partner swallows his first meditative sip of a British cuppa.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd after about --\n\nI don't know, what was it, five minutes?\n\nWe had ourselves a theory about where the Trojan Horse letter came from.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThe letter came from Adderley Primary School.\n\nThat's the most plausible theory.\n\nI told Brian this before he came to Birmingham, but he was new to the story.\n\nHe reminded me I was new to journalism.\n\nAnd he insisted we should start by analyzing the letter with an open mind, which we did.\n\nAnd then we ended up at Adderley Primary School.\n\nIn three years, we've added almost nothing new to the murder wall.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSorry for the trouble, Dr. and Mrs. Syed.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIt's not really that sophisticated.\n\nIf you read the Trojan Horse letter, sure, the author goes on about a grand city-wide plot.\n\nBut there's one school that the author seems to be obsessed with, Adderley Primary School.\n\nIn the middle of the letter, the author goes on this long tangent about a bizarre employment dispute between the headteacher at Adderley Primary School and four teaching assistants there, four classroom aides.\n\nThe author says this employment dispute is part of the plot, and describes it in excruciating detail.\n\nNone of the other schools get more than a few sentences devoted to them, relaying information you could have read in the news or online.\n\nBut Adderley --\n\nAdderley gets paragraphs stuffed with particulars that at the time were not public, including a bunch of different characters and events.\n\nWe're going to wait to read this part of the letter to you, because it's so in the weeds, it's going to make a lot better sense once you know more.\n\nBut for now, just know that, yeah, there's no mistaking whoever wrote the Trojan Horse letter had deep insider information about this Adderley case.\n\nAnd we're not the first to notice this, by the way.\n\nMore than a year after the Trojan Horse letter was made public, this employment dispute went in front of a judge.\n\nAnd in his decision, the judge said, undoubtedly, whoever wrote the letter had intimate knowledge of the allegations going to the heart of this case.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nWhat are your thoughts regarding that quote?\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIn our first interview, I actually read Tahir this line from the judge.\n\nBecause even though he wouldn't come out and say explicitly where he thought the letter came from, I suspected he was talking about Adderley.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nThe quote is very insightful and very accurate.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOK.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nI think the judge there has made a good observation.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSo OK, Adderley.\n\nTahir is pointing there.\n\nThis judge independently of Tahir is pointing there.\n\nWhen you just read the letter as a layperson, your head goes there.\n\nBut who at Adderley, and why?\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nWell, let us tell you the perplexing story of what happened at that school.\n\nIt begins not too differently from the story of Park View, with a troubled school in East Birmingham, and an ambitious new leader who comes in determined to turn the school around.\n\nAdderley Primary School is about a mile from Park View, on an industrial edge of the same neighborhood, Alum Rock.\n\nIt's a red brick Victorian building inside a spiky blue fence.\n\nIt's a big school, almost 600 students, twice the size of an average state primary school.\n\nAnd for a long time, it had a reputation for having a volatile staff, difficult to manage.\n\nIn seven years, it had been through nine head teachers, which wasn't good for the students.\n\nOfsted, the agency that inspects Britain's schools, had labeled Adderley inadequate, failing.\n\nIn 2008, the Birmingham City council turned to, among others, Tahir for help.\n\nBy then, Tahir had a reputation for revitalizing schools, and the council asked him to apply the Park View formula at Adderley.\n\nHe joined the Adderley governing body, which went searching for a new head teacher for the Primary school.\n\nAnd they found someone they were excited about, a Muslim woman who'd been a deputy headteacher at another East Birmingham majority-Muslim primary school, which under her team's leadership had vastly improved.\n\nHer name was Rizvana Darr.\n\nTahir says she was a standout candidate.\n\nTAHIR ALAM\n\nShe was very ambitious.\n\nShe is very passionate as a person.\n\nShe came across as being very child-centric as well.\n\nIn other words, children's interest comes first, rather than, let's keep some teachers happy and we have keep the unions happy, which is part of the dynamics in schools.\n\nBut she came across as being somebody who would put the children's interests first.\n\nThat came across very strongly to me.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nYou won't be hearing from Rizvana Darr.\n\nShe's declined to talk to us.\n\nBut we're able to tell you what went down between Mrs. Darr and the teaching assistants, because they ultimately ended up in a knockdown, drag-out legal fight over this in an employment tribunal, which means we've been able to read pages and pages of exhibits,\n\nand witness statements, and legal briefs, and the resulting judgment, all of which sets out their competing versions of what happened.\n\nThe people we have spoken to who know or have worked with Rizvana Darr --\n\nnearly every one of them says she was super impressive.\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nShe, you know, has a genius mind.\n\nThere's no question about it.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nRazwan Faraz is one of the locals Tahir recruited into teaching.\n\nHe lost his job after the government accused him of wrongdoing in the Trojan Horse affair.\n\nRazwan worked under Rizvana Darr at Adderley as an assistant head before they had a falling out, and Razwan moved on to another school.\n\nHe and Rizvana Darr were close.\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nIt wasn't that she was really good at one thing.\n\nShe was really good at everything she did.\n\nShe was really good at training teachers.\n\nShe was really good at monitoring.\n\nShe was really good at planning.\n\nShe was really good at assessing curriculum development.\n\nI've learnt more from her in the career of teaching than anybody else.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nRizvana Darr --\n\nRiz, as lots of people call her -- was a big part of the reason Razwan took a position at Adderley.\n\nShe was exciting to work for.\n\nShe was tireless.\n\nRazwan says sometimes, she'd show up at 5:00 or 5:30 in the morning and leave at 10:00 at night.\n\nAnd she implemented many of the same kinds of changes that Tahir's recruits had at Park View, high academic standards, inspiring lackadaisical staff, getting parents involved, making religious accommodations.\n\nAnd it was working.\n\nWithin just a few years, Ofstead, the school inspectors, raised Adderley from its lowest ranking to the second highest.\n\nThey credited Mrs. Darr as a head teacher of, quote, \"great vision and energy.\"\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBut this is where the story at Adderley takes a turn for the unusual.\n\nBecause a very peculiar series of events began developing at the school, the details of which would become an important part of the Trojan Horse letter.\n\nOne day, in December 2012, about a year before the letter surfaced, Mrs. Darr calls a teaching assistant named Hilary Owens into her office.\n\nWe've heard some people involved in schools describe teaching assistants as quite frankly, a nuisance, resistant to reforms, and a drain on resources.\n\nAnd there are strong unions in the UK, so it's hard to just up and fire someone because you don't get along.\n\nBut according to Mrs. Darr, her experience with Hilary Owens was on another level.\n\nIn a witness statement, Mrs. Darr describes Ms. Owens as rebellious and emotional, an employee who would take to, quote, \"throwing her arms in the air, crying, lying on the floor, or spreading herself across the table when she didn't get her way.\"\n\nOne big disagreement between Mrs. Darr and Hilary Owens was over the classroom Ms. Owens had been assigned to.\n\nThere were specific grades and teachers Hilary Owens felt comfortable with, and she'd gotten a health assessment saying it'd be better if the school could accommodate those preferences.\n\nWhen Mrs. Darr didn't accommodate that, by Miss Owens's own account, she started weeping in the staff room, which led to her taking a leave of absence, which meant the school had to pay her even when she wasn't coming in.\n\nAnd then came that day in December.\n\nHilary Owens was back at work.\n\nAnd according to Mrs. Darr's telling, Mrs. Darr finds an envelope in her mail cubby.\n\nIt's a letter from Hilary Owens tendering her resignation.\n\nYet Ms. Owens is still coming to work like everything's normal.\n\nSo Mrs. Darr calls Ms. Owens into her office.\n\nHilary Owens sits down.\n\nAnd Mrs. Darr says, I've received your letter of resignation.\n\nI accept it.\n\nCan I have your key fob, please?\n\nYou're free to go.\n\nTo which Hilary Owens responds, what letter of resignation?\n\nI didn't write a letter of resignation.\n\nI haven't resigned.\n\nHilary Owens also declined to do an interview with us, but we have a recording of her describing this moment to the police.\n\nYes, the police would eventually get involved.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nI said, but I haven't written a letter of resignation.\n\nAnd she said, you're now on garden leave.\n\nI need your security fob.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nGarden leave is administrative leave, basically, when you're on your way out from a job.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nAnd I thought, did she hear what I said?\n\nShe clearly didn't, because she carried on talking.\n\nAnd I kept saying to her, but I haven't written a letter of resignation.\n\nI haven't signed a letter of resignation.\n\nI haven't given you a letter of resignation.\n\nMay I see the letter?\n\nShe said, I don't have it.\n\nAnd she said, I need your security fob, which I was wearing around my neck.\n\nI said, you may have this fob if I can see my signature on that letter.\n\nAnd she said, this meeting is over.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd with that, Ms. Owens says, Mrs. Darr got up and stood by the door.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nIt's pretty strange isn't it?\n\nGet this, though.\n\nJust a few days before this meeting with Hilary Owens -- this is also laid out in the court records --\n\nMrs. Darr says she'd received three other resignation letters from three other teaching assistants at Adderley Primary School.\n\nThey were employees Mrs. Darr also had a difficult run with.\n\nThey were three Muslim women who lived near the school, and had worked there a long time.\n\nLike Hilary Owens, they weren't keen on Mrs. Darr and the changes she was making to the school.\n\nThey too had been fighting with the head teacher for many months, and by this time in December 2012, were all on paid leave due to work-related stress.\n\nWhen Mrs. Darr received resignation letters from these three TAs, she quickly wrote back to them at their homes, saying, I'm accepting your resignation.\n\nBest of luck with your future.\n\nEach of the three TAs replied, what are you talking about?\n\nWe haven't resigned.\n\nI hate to be a broken record here.\n\nWe'd love to hand the story off to those TAs, but they've also declined to talk to us.\n\nSo to the court files.\n\nThese TAs were named Rehena Khanom, Shahnaz Bibi, and Yasmin Akhtar.\n\nThey were close.\n\nTwo of them were sisters.\n\nOne had sent her kids to Adderley.\n\nAnd Hilary Owens was friendly with them.\n\nSometimes, she'd give one or the other a lift home.\n\nWhen they learned they were all in a similar predicament -- their boss claiming they'd resigned --\n\nthey started coordinating.\n\nThe TAs asked for a copy of the resignation letters they were supposed to have sent.\n\nBut when Mrs. Darr provided them, they said someone had fabricated these letters and forged their signatures.\n\nMs. Owens is forensic about this in her interview with the police.\n\nA cop shows her the letter supposedly signed by her.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nThat was not my signature.\n\nThe first thing I said, that's not my signature.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (OFFICER)\n\nOK, is it similar to your signature?\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nNo.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (OFFICER)\n\nNo.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nNot at all.\n\nThe H is wrong.\n\nThe C is wrong.\n\nThe M is wrong.\n\nThe S is completely wrong.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (OFFICER)\n\nSo it's not even --\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nThe M is wrong.\n\nIt's not even close.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (OFFICER)\n\nRight, OK, that's fair.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING (HILARY OWENS)\n\nI don't understand.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSo four of Rizvana Darr's employees were insisting someone had forged their resignation letters.\n\nBut Mrs. Darr, as she later explained in a witness statement, still believed the letters were authentic, despite what her employees were saying.\n\nShe refused to let them come back to work, at which point, the TAs came to the conclusion that Mrs. Darr must have been behind this.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWhat did you make of that story?\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nWell, I was completely amazed, because it seemed quite far-fetched, really, the notion that a headteacher forges resignation letters.\n\nYou couldn't imagine a headteacher going to those lengths.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nJackie Hughes used to be assistant director for school improvement for the Birmingham City Council.\n\nWhen this resignation fracas happened, she'd left that job.\n\nBut Adderley was a school she knew well, and Hilary Owens came to see her for advice.\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nShe was just so adamant over and over again.\n\nRiz Darr has lied.\n\nShe has treated us very, very badly.\n\nWe did not write those letters.\n\nAnd the headteacher didn't want them in the school, that they were part of the old guard from the previous head, and that she was making up stuff solely to get rid of them, so she could have her own people.\n\nAnd I thought that was quite plausible, because that's -- you know, does happen, doesn't it?\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nBut how about faking resignation letters?\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nWell that is --\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nLess plausible?\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nThat is just the bit that is completely bizarre.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nHave you come up with an explanation for the bizarrity?\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nIt strikes me Riz likes to write the script for everybody.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nYou see, I like Riz very much as a person.\n\nHowever, she was quite ruthless in getting her own way, and making sure that her school --\n\nand it would be hers --\n\ngot the outcome she wanted.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nSome of the same people who told us that Mrs. Darr was brilliant -- who awed at what she'd accomplished, lifting Adderley out of its academic abyss --\n\nthey also saw flip side to her ambition.\n\nHere's former assistant head Razwan Faraz.\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nEvery single classroom had to look the same.\n\nThe boards had look the same.\n\nEvery single book had to look the same.\n\nYou know, there was a level of control down to that detail.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nControl freak, slave driver, these are some of the words people who know Rizvana Darr have used to describe her to us.\n\nRazwan says she would monitor the most menial of her employees' tasks, the way workbooks needed to be color-coded by subject, the margin size staff was supposed to be printing with.\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nShe would say pencils need to be all together.\n\nThey cannot be mixed with pens, and --\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThis is a real example?\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIt would be very, very dictatorial.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nHow would she would even be aware of this, like, as a headteacher?\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nOh, she would scrutinize.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nAnd she would, like, march around the school and inspect these little --\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\n100%.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\n-- things?\n\nRAZWAN FARAZ\n\nYeah, and expect the leadership team to do the same.\n\nDAVE HUGHES\n\nYou go into some headteacher's offices, and you can tell they belong to a particular headteacher, but they're obviously places of work.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nDave Hughes was a member of the Adderley governing body that hired Mrs. Darr.\n\nHe's an experienced governor, who served for decades on the governing bodies of schools throughout Birmingham, including at Park View with Tahir.\n\nDave's also married to Jackie Hughes, who's sitting next to him, eyeglasses hanging around her neck, nodding her head.\n\nDAVE HUGHES\n\nYeah, this might be a family photograph or something, but you can tell it's a place of work, a professional place.\n\nRiz's office was like an extension of her home, lots of personal belongings in there, as well as professional stuff pinned on the wall.\n\nThe whole school had the feeling of not being an independent institution which she was leading, but her fiefdom --\n\nwas how it felt to me.\n\nJACKIE HUGHES\n\nYeah.\n\nNo, I did also.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nExactly right, yeah.\n\nDAVE HUGHES\n\nWhich is why I think she could be capable of doing whatever's necessary to protect that fiefdom.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nMrs. Darr saw the four TAs as a threat to her job.\n\nThat's clear from the court files and her witness statements.\n\nShe said they were miserable during the workday, constantly fighting her.\n\nRizvana Darr also started getting a lot of grief from parents about how she was running the school, in particular, more Orthodox parents, people Mrs. Darr referred to in the litigation as Salafi Muslims.\n\nSalafism is a conservative interpretation of Islam.\n\nGroups of parents started sending in complaints, or showing up at school to raise a stink, efforts to which Mrs. Darr seemed coordinated.\n\nShe knew the Muslim TAs had connections in the nearby Salafi community, and thought they were riling up these parents on purpose.\n\nShe also blamed Salafi parents for spreading rumors about her personal life, weaponizing the fact that she wasn't married at the time and didn't wear a hijab.\n\nMrs. Darr writes about this in her witness statements.\n\n\"I regularly stand in the playground, welcoming the children in the morning, or waving them off in the afternoon.\n\nAs I do so, I receive a high level of insults from parents.\n\nIn response to my good morning, they call me bitch and slag, and tell me I am not a good Muslim, not a good enough role model for their children, due to not covering my head.\n\nThat I should be married, that my clothes were inappropriate, and I was too modern and too Western.\"\n\nWe haven't talked to anyone from Adderley who observed this abusive behavior directly.\n\nBut in witness statements, members of Mrs. Darr's leadership team say they saw behavior like this, and that the TAs were behind the bullying.\n\nBut the TAs say that Mrs. Darr was the real bully.\n\nThey, along with a few other colleagues, lodged formal grievances against her through their union for bullying, intimidation, and harassment.\n\nThe TAs claimed that they were, quote, \"constantly undermined and belittled by Mrs. Darr,\" and that some of them had to seek medical help and go on medication.\n\nThese grievances were significant and serious.\n\nThey had the potential to cost Mrs. Darr her job.\n\nAnd notably, it was shortly after the TAs had filed these grievances that Mrs. Darr informed them that they had resigned -- that she had received resignation letters from them.\n\nAccording to the TAs, it was these official grievances -- that's why Mrs. Darr was so desperate to get rid of them.\n\nThe TAs tried everything they could think of to get their jobs back.\n\nThey contacted the Birmingham City Council.\n\nThey contacted their representatives in parliament.\n\nThey made a declaration in front of a magistrate, asserting that they did not write the letters.\n\nThey filed a report with the police.\n\nNone of it was working.\n\nThey asked for advice around the neighborhood.\n\nSAJAD AKRAM\n\nThey said they wanted their job back.\n\nThey want to stay at Adderley.\n\nThey didn't want to leave, and they've been forced to resign.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSajad Akram used to be a teacher at Adderley, and he'd also been involved with hiring Mrs. Darr.\n\nHe lives around the corner from one of the TAs.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nWere they upset, were they mad?\n\nSAJAD AKRAM\n\nThey were upset.\n\nThey were very concerned, actually, because they felt that they were on their last legs, and they had no ground to retain their job.\n\nThey're losing their job.\n\nSo I said, the best advice I can give you is go and see Tahir.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nTahir was the guy you went to when there was a problem with a school in East Birmingham.\n\nPlus, he'd helped recruit Rizvana Darr to Adderley.\n\nSAJAD AKRAM\n\nI said, look, speak to Tahir.\n\nHe will be able to help you, because he's obviously in the know about legislation.\n\nBecause I didn't know the truth, but I suspect what they were saying was true.\n\nBut I said, look, if anybody's got some influence over Rizvana, it would be Tahir, because they respect him.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nThe women approach Tahir, though Tahir tells us he doesn't really remember much about it.\n\nHe says he bumped into one of the TAs at the grocery store, and she explained a bit about the situation.\n\nBut he says he doesn't recall it going any further than that.\n\nOne organization did intervene for the TAs, their union.\n\nTheir rep was firing off emails to Birmingham City Council, which is Rizvana Darr's employer, saying that Mrs. Darr had quote, \"fabricated the charade, and that in all her years, the representative had never seen someone more drunk on power -- \" that's a quote --\n\n\"than Rizvana Darr.\"\n\nUntil finally, the Birmingham City Council stepped in, and instructed Mrs. Darr that she should not terminate the TAs' employment.\n\nThe council warned her in a letter that if you treat these resignations as valid, and the employees sue the school for wrongful termination, we won't defend Adderley.\n\nWe will not pay for your lawyers, or any damages you're liable for, like the council normally would for one of its schools.\n\nYou'll be on your own.\n\nAnd Mrs. Darr --\n\nshe ended the women's employment anyway.\n\nTo no one's surprise, the TAs brought a case against Adderley Primary school for unfair dismissal.\n\nAnd the Birmingham City Council did exactly as it said it would.\n\nIt left the school on the hook to pay for its own defense, and for any potential damages if the TAs won their case.\n\nMrs. Darr plowed ahead.\n\nAnd the defense Adderley Primary school submitted ahead of the hearing was certainly novel.\n\nDaniel Zakis a solicitor who represented one of the TAs, Hilary Owens, remembers when he read Adderley's argument.\n\nDANIEL ZAKIS\n\nThey said that their case was that all four of the claimants had engaged in a course of conduct over a period of years to undermine the headteacher, and that their resignations were part of a plot.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nThese four people, including Hilary, were part of a plot to undermine Rizvana Darr?\n\nDANIEL ZAKIS\n\nYeah, to convert the school to one based on strict Muslim Salafi teachings.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nSalafi being that more conservative interpretation of Islam, the interpretation Mrs. Darr said the parents whom the TAs were whipping up against her subscribed to.\n\nDaniel Zakis thought, that's an odd accusation to make about classroom aides at a Primary school, and especially about his client, Hilary, who attended Anglican church every Sunday.\n\nAdderley's defense filing doesn't use the word plot, but that is what it describes.\n\nThe school's lawyers wrote that the resignation letters, quote, \"have been used as a contrived and malicious means of falsely creating a scenario which would bring into question the headteacher's reputation.\"\n\nIn other words, the TAs had schemed together to all submit resignations, and then pretend that Mrs. Darr had forged them to get her in trouble.\n\nDANIEL ZAKIS\n\nTo say that they all resign --\n\ngenuine resignations.\n\nThey then all deny that they've resigned.\n\nAnd that would then cause uproar.\n\nIt's not the, you know, greatest plot.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nBear in mind, everything we've been talking about up to this point --\n\nthis whole resignation dispute --\n\nit all happened before the Trojan Horse letter existed.\n\nSo when Adderley's legal team filed its defense in spring 2013, this was the first Hilary Owen's solicitor was hearing about an Islamic plot in a Birmingham School to undermine a headteacher.\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nAs the hearing date approached, a handwriting expert was brought in to analyze the signatures on the disputed resignation letters.\n\nAnd the expert concluded that the TAs signatures were, in fact, not authentic.\n\nThey had been forged.\n\nBy the month of the hearing, November 2013, Adderley defense was looking pretty strained.\n\nMrs. Darr was facing the real prospect of the school losing the case.\n\nAnd it was that month that someone claiming to be an anonymous whistleblower forwarded the Trojan Horse letter to the Birmingham City Council, a letter apparently written from one shadowy conspirator to another, describing a plot to oust headteachers in majority-Muslim schools.\n\nThe letter outlined the process of taking down a headteacher in five steps.\n\nStep one, identify a poor performing school based in a Muslim area of town.\n\nStep two, quote, \"select a group of Salafi parents.\"\n\nThe letter is very specific about this.\n\nThe parents should be Salafis.\n\nThe goal is to get these Salafi parents, quote, \"fired up and ready to give the headteacher a very difficult time on a daily basis.\n\nIf you can get them to be very vocal on the playground as they drop off or pick up their children, that will stir up other parents,\" end quote.\n\nStep three, put your own governor on the governing body.\n\nStep four, identify key staff to disrupt the school from within.\n\nHere too, the letter is very specific.\n\nThe best people for this job are TAs, because, quote, \"they are less educated and from the local community, so are much more easily influenced.\"\n\nThe letter continues, quote, \"it is also important where possible to ensure you have an English face amongst the group,\" end quote.\n\nIt's clear from the context the letter doesn't mean my type of English face.\n\nIt means a white person.\n\nBecause according to the letter, this person can give cover to the fact the Muslim TAs are part of a religious conspiracy.\n\nAnd finally, step five, start a campaign where you complain to authorities about the headteacher, including the city council and your local MP.\n\nIf you're hearing those five steps and thinking Adderley, you're not the only one.\n\nAnd that's not even the part of the Trojan Horse letter that's directly about Adderley.\n\nThe Adderley part is a good half a page, and it's about this specific resignation case.\n\nThe author includes it as one of the main examples of how the plotters are maneuvering against headteachers.\n\nListen to how closely it mirrors Adderley's defense in the case.\n\n\"Mrs. Darr,\" it begins, \"is not a good Muslim, and was not open to our suggestions of adhering to strict Muslim guidelines.\n\nShe's very procedurally strong, and so we had to find a reason for her to be sacked linked to procedures.\n\nThree of our Muslim sisters and a governor have been disrupting the school, and causing issues for Mrs. Darr since she took over the school.\n\nThese sisters are a great example of what can be achieved by only three people.\n\nThey, along with an English woman who is their close friend, have raised an allegation of fraudulent resignation letters against the head, even though they did actually write the letters themselves.\"\n\nFrom there, the Trojan Horse letter goes on to give a meticulous account of what happened with the resignations, how and where the TAs drafted them, how they arrange to have them delivered.\n\nThis account lines up exactly with the claims made in the employment case.\n\nIt ends with an explanation of Hilary Owens's unique role in the Salafi plot.\n\nQuote, \"as the English woman dropped her letter off in the head's staff box, it adds another angle of fraud against the head.\n\nAnd because she's English, it will take the focus off the other Muslim sisters.\n\nIf all goes wrong, everyone is briefed, and will blame the English woman for planning and implementing the whole campaign to cause disruption amongst the Muslim staff and the Muslim headteacher.\"\n\n[MUSIC]\n\nThat's how the Trojan Horse letter describes what was going on Adderley.\n\nThat support staff at a Primary school --\n\nthree aunties from East Birmingham, and a Christian lady from the burbs --\n\nwere in reality secret agents, conspiring with extremists as part of a broader Salafi conspiracy to take down Rizvana Darr.\n\nIt's incredible reading.\n\nThe Trojan Horse letter was just the evidence Rizvana Darr needed to support her version of the resignations.\n\nUp to the point when it appeared in November 2013, hers had been a singular and unconvincing claim that she was the victim of a Salafi plot by four of her teaching assistants.\n\nBut now here was proof of that plot.\n\nOne of the conspirators had conveniently written it all down.\n\nIncredible.\n\nRizvana Darr was accused of fabricating letters, and another letter materialized to come to her rescue.\n\nBRIAN REED\n\nAnd rescue her it did.\n\nRizvana Darr would go on to use the Trojan Horse letter to clear her name.\n\nIn the wake of the letter, the Birmingham City council reversed course, and paid for Adderley Primary school's legal case.\n\nThe police raided the teaching assistants' houses at dawn, and arrested them for conspiracy to commit fraud.\n\nThe cops didn't end up bringing any charges, but all of this delayed the TAs' case against Adderley for years.\n\nOnce the hearing began and Mrs. Darr finally did go in front of a judge, Adderley's legal team used the Trojan Horse letter as evidence to support the school's case that the TAs had conspired to unseat Mrs. Darr.\n\nIn the end, the judge concluded that Mrs. Darr did not fabricate the resignation letters.\n\nRizvana Darr is the headteacher of Adderley Primary school to this day.\n\nMore after the break.\n\nHAMZA SYED\n\nOnce the Trojan Horse that started floating around East Birmingham in early 2014, for people close to the schools involved -- people who knew and worked with Rizvana Darr --\n\nit didn't take too many reads for their minds to wander over to a spiky blue fence, and the headteacher inside.\n\nARCHIVED RECORDING\n\nWhat I remember distinctly coming to mind was seems to be a lot of information about Adderley here.\n\nIn the Trojan Horse letter, a lot of it relates to Adderley, and things that wasn't in the public domain.\n\nWho else would know this?\n\nWho else at the time would know this, other than Riz Darr?\n\nIt was just so o"
