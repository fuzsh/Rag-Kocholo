To help erase this problem, I’ve invited Dustin Lien from JumpXmarketing.com back on the show. Dustin first appeared on episode 251 back in 2017. Back then, he was just ramping up JumpX after shutting down his own physical product business. Since then he’s grown it into a 6-figure operation and built it in such a way that it only requires part-time attention. What’s been his key driver? Partner workshops, essentially virtual lunch-and-learn sessions where he can showcase his expertise and build his client roster without ads or bidding for work. This works in just about any niche and in this episode, Dustin breaks down his exact process so you can go out and apply it in your own business.

Back then, the process was much more manual. The typical workflow was something like this: coming up with viral video ideas, hiring scriptwriters, voice artists, and video editors to create content. The aim was to hit the viral YouTube lottery by planting a bunch of digital assets and hoping enough would hit big to turn a profit on ad income. But what a difference a year makes. Now, we've got AI tools to assist in just about every step of that production process, and Tony's been on the front lines of these changes. So I wanted to have him back on to find out, first of all, is that a good thing for content creators, YouTubers, and side hustlers? And how much can you make in this new AI-powered YouTube landscape?

Quitting your job to pursue your business full-time is a dream for many side hustlers, but there are a few things you should have in place before you make the leap. When I was working in my corporate gig, I probably stuck around longer than I needed to because I'm a little more risk averse. I was out to dinner with my boss in Eureka, CA ... and it wasn't until my second beer I finally got up the nerve to tell him I was leaving. Since I'd been thinking about it for at least a year, it felt amazing to get that off my chest. But it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment decision or a triumphant flip-off-everyone-in-the-office-and-make-a-dramatic-exit. It was the result of 3 years of hustling nights and weeks to build my business (the now-defunct footwear comparison shopping site). Here are the most important questions to answer before you make the leap. Full Show Notes: 7 Questions to Ask Before You Quit Your Job New to the Show?

For some entrepreneurs and small business owners, that’s a tough pill to swallow. But when you’re up against that ceiling you've got two options. You can: Settle in. Get help. This episode is about growing your team in such a way that you have some breathing room in your schedule and in your mental bandwidth to do the work that’s required of a business owner.

As we cruised the neighborhood, a bright pink \"Kroopin's Poopin Scoopin\" sign caught my eye. We first heard from this guest in 2020. She was earning around a thousand bucks a week from her part-time pooper scooper/pet waste removal business. And since then, it has grown to serve almost 200 weekly residential customers at an average ticket price of $99/month.

For the sake of background, dad is a chemical engineer — he spent decades of his career at one company — but still had lots of entrepreneurial experiences and insights along the way. (He did do a bit of consulting in retirement!) The funny thing is almost all of these were very literal conversations, which I’ve extrapolated out (30 years later!) to have a broader meaning. And as I think about the kind of advice I want to be passing along to my own kids, I think these kinds of concrete illustrations may be a really effective way to do it.

But is there an advantage to staying a solo operator? In this Side Hustle Showdown, we're looking at freelancing vs. building an agency. For this debate, I invited a couple members of The Side Hustle Nation community who both run cleaning companies: Chris Schwab from ThinkMaids.com represented the agency side. We last heard from Chris in episode 294, where he talked about how he’d built his cleaning business to $60k a month in revenue, and scaled back his own involvement to just 10 minutes a day. Ken Carfango from SmartCleaningSchool.com represented the solo freelance side. Ken’s a former engineer and a father of 5 who’s got his cleaning business dialed in where he can knock out the work himself in just a couple days, and enjoy 5-day weekends with his family. Tune in to hear both Chris and Ken discuss which business model is best for: Getting started Finding new clients Scaling Start-up costs How to exit And more If you’re trying to decide which path you want to take, stick around to learn how to avoid the dreaded “valley of despair” that often afflicts service businesses, and how to get started on the right foot.

As soon as you’ve...\n\nBefore we begin, I should note that the single BEST way to make your side hustle feel official is to get paid. As soon as you’ve got your side hustle idea, go sell something. Seriously. That first income — no matter how small — is an empowering moment. In fact, I did a whole episode describing how I got my first sale in 6 different businesses, and later another 25 members of Side Hustle Nation shared their story in this fun round-up episode. But I also understand that many people — myself include — often want some level of “establishment” before they feel comfortable saying they’re open for business. I opened my first LLC while I was still in college and really had no idea what I needed it for. But it felt good, and if I’m being honest, made me feel smart and important too. And later I got plenty of use out of it. And that’s what this post is about. Even though in the early days of your side hustle, you’re better off focusing on getting customers, sometimes you need a little foundation before you’re mentally ready to focus on getting customers. My only caution is not to use this list as fodder for procrastination, but to use it as a checklist to build positive momentum and keep going. Again, before you pull my hustle card, know that you don’t need any of these to get started. But you will need to do most of these eventually, and if you’re the person who likes to get everything in order first, let’s get that excuse out of the way. Ready? Let’s do it.

All it takes is following some proven rules and principles to put you on the path. I'm talking about 10 fundamental rules that will help turn your financial dreams into reality. And they come from my recent conversation with Robert Farrington, founder of the famous personal finance site The College Investor and a longtime guest on The Side Hustle Show. This conversation is based on his article 10 Rules to Get Rich and Grow Wealth. Full Show Notes: 10 Rules to Get Rich and Build Wealth New to the Show?

Simplify first, diversify second—that’s an idea I have always advocated on the show. The first step towards diversifying is to have something working. But how do you know it’s time to diversify? That is exactly what Bjork Ostrom (our previous guest from Ep 46) has done as he (and his wife Lindsay) masterfully “stacked” multiple online businesses that have developed out of their original food blog, Pinch of Yum. This 10-year-old blog has been a launchpad for Food Blogger Pro (a guide for aspiring food bloggers), Clariti (for optimizing your site's content), and the holding company, TinyBit. And this is the framework he uses to decide if an idea is worth pursuing. Full Show Notes: Side Hustle Stacking: How One Extra Income Stream Can Lead to More New to the Show?

It's flexible, low-overhead, and you can probably start with skills you already have. “I had a lot of drive underneath me,\" Abbey Ashley told me, about starting her service business back in 2013. \"I was super pregnant and I hated my job so much,” Abbey started offering her services as a virtual assistant, and connected with her first clients at local networking events in Washington, DC. My the time her maternity leave was up--just a few short months--Abbey had booked enough work to not have to go back to that job she hated. On top of that, she only had to work 20 hours a week to do it, and could work from home. There are almost no barriers to entry to starting a freelance service business, and the startup costs are minimal. (All Abbey did was make business cards for networking.) In fact, it was a service business, a house painting business in my case, that was one of my first entrepreneurial adventures. Over time, Abbey scaled her virtual assistant business from just herself at $20-30 an hour, to her own little virtual agency, to $75 an hour and up for some specialized work.

Kelan built his online business up from making $50 in the first year to now seeing around 500k pageviews a month. That led to his online business making seven figures last year.

Can I still start a side hustle?\" On the one hand, I totally get that feeling. If you're a teacher, tutoring might seem like an obvious side gig. If you're an accountant, you could freelance or start a bookkeeping business. But not everyone's skills neatly align with a natural side hustle. So what do you do if you don't think you have any marketable skills? Is there still a path to earning extra income on the side? Yes, there absolutely is! And that's what I'm breaking down in this post—your four options to start a profitable side hustle, even if you think you're skillless today.

He's a side hustling real estate investor specializing in \"creative\" financing deals -- houses he can buy without using his own money. Austin is the author of Free Houses: How To Build Your Real Estate Investment Portfolio With No Money. His basic strategy is this: Find a killer deal on a house that needs some work. Buy it with the creative financing methods Austin talks about in this episode. Either do the work yourself or hire contractors. Put a paying tenant in the newly rehabbed home. Refinance the home with a traditional bank loan and pay back the original funding source. The end game is positive monthly cash flow from rental income, plus building a long-term wealth through tenants paying off the mortgage. Austin has developed some unique and interesting ways to hard money and private money to fund his property purchases. The best part – it’s truly a side hustle that can be done in a few hours a week the end result is passive income from rental revenue. Tune in to hear how Austin finds killer deals, buys the houses without risking his own capital, and then rehabs them to get ready to rent.

But Carter Osborne from carterosbornetutoring.com took a pretty unconventional path to dominating this niche business. When he started providing tutoring services on the side, he was just a \"broke, desperate graduate student\" in need of some extra money. Carter actually had no formal business training. His background was in political science and public administration—so not exactly the traditional entrepreneurial breeding grounds. Not exactly the traditional path for an entrepreneur, right? And yet, the untraditional route Carter took allowed him to build a unique $100k consulting business, with almost all the revenue coming in just half the year. While Carter's career path didn't seem logical as a tutor, he was about to discover an untapped market niche that was waiting to be explored.

With a growing email list of beginners wanting to learn about email marketing, she knew she wanted to find a way to step away from client work within a couple of years. She had just signed a huge copywriting contract worth $20,000... her biggest one yet. But instead of excitement, all she felt was dread about the massive project she now had to take on. And as a single parent, she knew the importance of creating a business that would support her lifestyle and allow her to be present for her family. This is where the idea of \"low cost = low responsibility\" appealed to her, as it would allow her to serve her audience at LizWilcox.com while maintaining a manageable workload.

Profitable vending machines are everywhere — offices, apartment buildings, gyms, airports.

It wasn't even an idea in founder Russ Perry's head yet. That's why it seems crazy to me that today the unlimited graphic design service is doing $400k in monthly recurring revenue! Back in 2014, Russ was running a creative agency, but he started to hate everything about it. “I felt like I was in a prison of my own creation,” he said. By January 2015, he'd shut down his agency and started working as a freelancer. Not wanting to build a similar prison again, he sought out a different business model -- one with a simpler service offering that was designed to scale. From taking on a friend as his first client to now completing more than 800 design jobs a day, it’s been an incredibly quick ascension and a great example of how to scale a service business. Tune in to hear how Russ grew his business from zero to $410k+ in monthly recurring revenue in less than 3 years.

Plus, you’ll learn why we think they’re important and how you can apply them in your own life.

The stability of a steady paycheck no longer worth the daily dread of unfulfilling work? Did you suddenly want a career change? I’m talking staring-at-the-ceiling-all-night type misery. Alex Warneke knows exactly how this feels. She found herself creatively stifled and financially limited working as a marine ecologist and park ranger. While loving the subject matter, restrictions around income growth, adventure, and location independence nagged her. She couldn't shake the feeling that her current path just wouldn't get her to the life she envisioned. Despite no prior experience, Alex strategically skilled up and gained Salesforce credentials to increase her income potential dramatically. Her story offers an inspirational template for others looking to pursue more career flexibility.

She ended up doing just that after acquiring – and improving – a portfolio of mini online businesses. In her case, these were websites that make money from advertising. Now, this asset class can be risky, and Stacy is open about her early failures. But if you have some online skills, (or management skills to bring people in if you don’t want to run the site yourself) this can be a fast-track to the cash flow you need to fund your lifestyle. Since websites often sell for 20x monthly earnings, they’re perhaps 10-15x “cheaper” than if you were to rely solely on traditional investments and a 4% withdrawal rate. Sound like the kind of investment that suits your lifestyle? Tune in to episode 323 to hear where Stacy finds these businesses to buy, her unique filtering criteria, and a few quick ways she’s been able to accelerate the cash flow of her portfolio for even better returns.

While that experience was upsetting for both of them at the moment, it sparked an idea for Lou and her husband Ben to create a solution. Ben fashioned a silicone strap with staples to attach Lou's Kindle to her hand and prevent any future dropping incidents. Lou tested it out over the next month and absolutely loved having the grip and security of the strap for comfortable one-handed reading during those long middle-of-the-night feeds. And thus, their side hustle, strapsicle.com was born—a company now generating over $50k a month selling their innovative Kindle straps. Not only that, but Strapsicle is on pace for its first-ever 6 figures after recently going viral on TikTok and Instagram.

Coming up with a large down payment, securing financing, dealing with tenants, handling maintenance and repairs. The barriers to entry aren’t exactly low. But what if you could skip all that and still bring in serious cash flow by renting out apartments and homes without buying them? When Richie Matthews and his wife were looking to supplement their seasonal events business in late 2019, rental arbitrage seemed like an ideal side hustle. Little did they know that just a few months later, that tiny side hustle would quickly scale into a business managing 60 units and generating over $2.5 million in revenue and $700k in profits.

That's what Paul Minors achieved with his virtual software consulting side hustle. You might recognize Paul’s name. Paul is a productivity blogger and consultant from New Zealand. He was part of a fun productivity roundtable episode we did towards the end of 2016 -- that was episode 197 if you want to go back and check it out. At that time, Paul was putting the wheels in motion on his consulting business centered around specific software tools. If you can hitch your cart to a rising tide of interest in a particular tool, and become the go-to expert in that space, you can do really well. Paul was able to leave his day job within a couple of months of starting his business. He was then able to go traveling with his wife for 6-months while working 15-20 hours a week from his laptop. After arriving back home, he started working full-time on his consulting business. “I noticed the impact of that straight away, within a couple of months I had doubled my income,” Paul told me. It's clear Paul has figured out this business model. This episode is packed with ideas you might be able to apply to your own areas of expertise. Maybe you’ll even uncover some areas of expertise you never really considered that special before. Tune in to episode 344 hear: How Paul came across the idea of offering his first consulting services “by accident.” The several different marketing channels that drive targeted traffic to his website How he’s added more products and services to his portfolio Full Show Notes: Virtual Consulting: How to Start a Location-Independent Consulting Business New to the Show?

After being fired from her toxic work environment, Becky was inspired to start her own business. She launched the blog MomBeach.com in 2015, but it took 6 long years of blood, sweat, and tears before it became a full-time income source. When COVID-19 struck, Becky's blog exploded from 20,000 pageviews a month to over 250,000. Riding the growth, she took the leap into full-time blogging and digital product creation. Just two years later, Becky now earns $30,000 a month, largely from digital product sales. She sells printables, courses, planners, workbooks, and more through her website, Etsy store, and TeachersPayTeachers.

Or, what if instead of paying that expense every month, your living situation actually paid you? It’s not as far-fetched as it may sound. In fact, that’s exactly what today’s guest, Craig Curelop, has done by intentionally \"house hacking\" over the past few years. He’s even written a book on the topic, and it's one I wish I’d had when I was 18 or 19! I would have definitely done some things differently. The basic idea is to use other people’s rents to offset, or even profit from your own housing costs. On top of that, you'll begin building wealth through real estate and earn tax benefits as well. If you have a spare room or two in your home, or you're interested in house hacking, this episode is going to get the gears turning for you. Tune in as Craig runs through some examples of how you can do this. Whether you’re a young professional, or you have a family of your own, you can offset some or all of your mortgage payments. But keep in mind, this isn’t a common path -- this is living for a period of time like others won’t -- as you’ll hear from Craig’s story.

As young professionals working busy day jobs, they struggled with skincare issues like acne and eczema but couldn’t find products that worked for them. Rather than accept their fate, these best friends decided to take matters into their own hands.

In 2019, Ben and Kevin finally decided to scratch their entrepreneurial itch and turn this passion project into a side hustle reality.

It’s not a far-fetched goal according to this...\n\nImagine going from having no business ideas and no money, to making your first sales in 2 weeks. It’s not a far-fetched goal according to this week’s guest. Alan Donegan from PopUpBusinessSchool.co.uk specializes in guiding people through this transformation, and he says that everyone has a profitable business idea in their heads – and he knows how to find it. He does this through in-person workshops that are free to attend by forming partnerships with government bodies in cities across the UK, and he’s bringing his workshops to the US soon. Alan is adamant about bootstrapping and not taking on a load of debt to start a business because he saw his family go through a multi-million dollar bankruptcy and doesn’t want anyone else to have to experience the same fate. He preaches starting a business around a passion or something that excites you. Because running a business you’re passionate about sets you apart from the competition and makes the process so much easier. He shares how he teaches his students to pre-sell and validate their side hustle ideas before putting down cash for stock that might end up collecting dust in the garage. Alan also shares how he practiced what he preaches when he sold his first PopUpBusiness workshop to a housing authority in the UK. He ended up selling his highest priced package right out of the gate, and his business has been gaining momentum ever since.
