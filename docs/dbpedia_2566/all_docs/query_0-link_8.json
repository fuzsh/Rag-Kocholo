        "text": "children’s preconceptions about a medium—for example, that print is “hard” and television is “easy”—shape the amount of mental effort they will invest in processing the medium. This amount of invested mental effort, or AIME, is defined as “the number of non-automatic mental elaborations applied to the material” (Salomon, 1984). AIME, in turn, shapes how much children will take away from the medium; that is, how much they might learn. The contexts of a child’s life will contribute to how “shallowly” or “deeply” he or she will process mediated information (Cohen & Salomon, 1979). For example, comparisons of Israeli children and American children during the 1970s showed that, even when IQ was accounted for, Israeli children learned more from television programming than their American counterparts did. He reasoned that this was because at the time of his studies, Israelis used television primarily as a news source. Salomon also found that the perceived demand characteristics (PDCs) of a medium could be altered. Children who were told that they would be asked questions about what they viewed, or who were told to pay attention because the material was hard, did in fact pay more attention and did in fact learn more (Salomon, 1983).\n\nAIME theory raises the question of how children come to think about media as fulfilling particular uses or gratifying particular needs. Van Evra (1998) suggests that since much of television is entertainment, children develop a particular schema for how much processing is required—a schema that will drive viewing of even educational programming. While preschool programming, particularly that which airs on PBS, has historically had a mission to educate, the past decade has seen a virtual explosion of educational offerings for children—and novel approaches for getting children engaged with the material. Research with the program Blue’s Clues has been an interesting case study. The producers of the program designed the series to be “interactive,” mimicking Mr. Rogers’s (Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood) style of speaking and pausing as though he were talking with the young viewers themselves. Assessments of viewers’ reactions to the series indicate that the program encouraged a novel style of TV watching—one in which preschoolers talk to characters, shout out solutions to problems, and generally “interact” with what is on the screen. These Blue’s Clues–induced viewing styles, moreover, translated to the viewing of other programs, including noninteractive ones such as Cartoon Network’s Big Bag (Crawley et al., 2002).\n\n199"
