        "text": "You’re studying neuroscience and AI at Stanford. How does that fit into your Farmlink work? Do you intend to stay on as CEO after you graduate?\n\nThere is a lot of need in the world right now to apply AI to help us solve real-world problems such as global food insecurity, disaster resilience, and climate change. I am currently taking a year off from Stanford to work on Farmlink, and I am not sure what I will be doing after I graduate yet!\n\nYou’ve expanded into Mexico. How did that happen?\n\nSome of our team members grew up or currently live in Mexico, so they really led the charge to get the Farmlink operation off the ground there. Food insecurity doesn’t have borders, and Mexico has the same challenges of billions of pounds of fresh produce going to waste while so many face food insecurity, so it made sense. We have had students reach out from about 20 different countries hoping to start Farmlink in their home communities. This was the first step toward that.\n\nAs the end of the pandemic draws near, what’s the future for Farmlink?\n\nEven before the pandemic, 20 billion pounds of fresh produce a year were going to waste on farms in the United States alone. Globally, it’s 200 billion pounds. At the same time, millions of people in this country go hungry and nearly a billion people around the world face food insecurity. Every year, we are growing enough food to feed every person on this planet, yet nearly a third of that goes to waste while so many people struggle to keep food on the table. Farmlink is on a mission to bring an end to this absurdity. To do that, we have teamed up with IDEO and the World Wildlife Fund to build a technology product that can help us do what we are doing at a much larger scale. While we are proud of delivering 30 million pounds of produce, we know there is so much more work to be done. That’s why we are also investing in carbon sequestration [removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it], policy change, and tangible projects to build a more sustainable food system for people and our planet.\n\nWhat can someone reading this do to help with food insecurity?\n\nVolunteer at your local food bank! It makes all the difference in the world. And go to Farmlinkproject.org and get involved!\n\nCan you describe what you do at Pixar?\n\nI owe a lot of my career to my time at HW! It was in a computer lab with [visual arts teacher] Dr. [Arthur] Tobias at HW that I first started learning and playing with 3D animation software, sparking an interest that would eventually lead to my path to Pixar. I’ve been at Pixar for more than 15 years, so I’ve had the chance to work on a lot of great films: Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, Cars 3, Coco, Finding Dory, Incredibles 2, Toy Story 4, Onward, and Soul. I’m currently working on Luca, slated for release this summer, and Win or Lose, Pixar’s first original episodic series due on Disney+ in 2023.\n\nI typically work in simulation, using computer physics simulations to add motion and detail to things that are too difficult to animate by hand, like clothing and hair—how they wrinkle, bend, and move with a character and the air. Typically this work comes on the production side of the film, after writing and story decisions have been made. On Wind, I stepped into the director’s role and guided the project from beginning to end.\n\nWhat is the idea behind SparkShorts, the umbrella under which you made Wind?\n\nSparkShorts is a program at Pixar designed to encourage a new set of diverse storytellers to experiment with new storytelling and production techniques. The SparkShorts are made with small teams, so everyone’s responsibilities and opportunities expand beyond their usual scope, and everyone helps out however they can. In my case I both directed and worked directly on shots as a simulation artist.\n\nWhat made you want to make Wind?\n\nI started with the question of what it would be like to live in a state of constant falling. That sparked a curiosity about what it would be like for a family to live in a place like that. The chasm the boy and his grandmother live in represents a world left devastated after some disaster, like a war. More broadly, it represents a place where opportunity is scarce and hope seems like a distant light on the horizon.\n\nWind is inspired by my grandmother’s own story. When the Korean War started, she and my father and his brothers fled south, not realizing that they would end up separated from my grandfather. My grandmother was left a single mother taking care of her children. Wind is inspired by everything she did to feed and educate them, and eventually, when my father grew older, to put together enough to send him to the U.S. for a new life.\n\nWhat do you hope audiences take away from watching this short?\n\nStorytelling is one of the best tools we have for teaching empathy, and I hope those who watch this film have that sense expanded in them—for Asian Americans, for the elderly, and for immigrants as well. We all share stories of family members and loved ones who’ve sacrificed for us, and I hope knowing that can better connect us with each other.\n\nHow did the COVID-19 pandemic influence your decision to run?\n\nWhen I was in high school, I thought I might go into politics. But after graduate school I was drawn to teaching, as I found that my greatest passion was helping other people discover what they love and support them in pursuing it. I went from teaching to running a nonprofit focused on women’s economic security through education and training, and for two decades served as an advocate.\n\nHad we not faced COVID, I might not have run for office. Somebody had to email me to get me to even think about running for state representative, because I hadn’t thought about it. But COVID laid bare all of the inequities and gaps that we had been [talking about] as advocates for years. Because of COVID, we are now talking about childcare or healthcare differently because it has become so obvious that supports for working families are fragile and insufficient. I see in this moment an exciting opportunity to ask bigger questions and change systems and institutions that haven’t worked for most Americans for a very long time.\n\nWhat was your first day in office like?\n\nI was sworn in remotely as people were storming the Capitol; it was both an exhilarating and deeply unsettling day. My very first vote, two days later, was a resolution to condemn the events of January 6. It was an extraordinary first few days.\n\nWhat are you working on in your first year in office?\n\nI’m on the General Housing and Military Affairs Committee, which has a really broad portfolio; in one afternoon we can bounce from considering how to spend federal COVID relief money earmarked for housing, to raising the minimum wage, to considering an expansion of the state lottery, to revising statutes related to the National Guard. It’s a great introduction to a range of issues. Doing this work is a privilege and an unusual opportunity to get to do something so new and different at age 59.\n\nNikil Saval ’01, Pennsylvania State Senator\n\nHow did Harvard-Westlake affect your career path?\n\nI always wanted to be a writer. I’ve been a freelance journalist since 2011. The emphasis on literature in my classics and English classes and the Playwrights Festival really honed my skills as a writer.\n\nI worked in book publishing after I graduated from college and had a naive sense of idealism around that industry. Great writers write, and like them, I wanted to produce books. But books are produced in a commercialized industry that exploits workers in certain ways. So I wanted to learn to organize for better workplace conditions.\n\nWhen I was in graduate school, I volunteered for a union in San Francisco. It was majority minority. It was immigrants from East Asia and Black workers and people from Latin America. I had never seen a group of people who had similar backgrounds to mine banding together and having power in a city.\n\nAnd this is important, I think, for people who come up through meritocratic institutions like Harvard-Westlake, where you’re supported in your talents and abilities, but a lot is put on you as an individual to make your way. You can't just make it on your own. The way that broad changes are won in society is with other people. I learned that in the labor movement. That experience was transformative for me.\n\nWhat other experiences influenced your decision to enter politics?\n\nI knocked on doors for Senator Bernie Sanders in South Philadelphia in 2016 and got to know my neighbors. That feeling was powerful. There was a constant dialogue about what we needed in our society. Out of the Sanders campaign, I came to cofound a progressive organization, Reclaim Philadelphia, which was meant to localize the national work of the Sanders campaign.\n\nHow did you react when another member of Reclaim Philadelphia proposed that you run for Pennsylvania State Senate?\n\nI wasn’t horrified by the idea, and I knew that we had a broad group of people who would work for it. And I think that’s the key. I didn’t really want to do it myself. I wanted to be an organizer. But at some point, you get asked to represent social movements in office. That’s how I think of what I’m doing right now. I had the capacity and wherewithal, and my family was ready to support me. That was the most important conversation.\n\nSeason 1 interviews were recorded in person, while Season 2 are recorded virtually. What was that transition like?\n\nFortunately I am using a platform like Zoom where the guest and I can see each other during our conversation, which helps a great deal. I prefer in-person conversations, given the intimacy created by a physical space that draws in both the guest and the listener; that said, virtual technology has opened up many new possibilities in terms of who can be interviewed. For example, Phoebe Stubblefield ’86, who is leading the forensic excavation of the 1921 Tulsa race massacre, joined me from Gainesville, Florida. That could not have happened in Season 1.\n\nWho is your own supporting cast, and how did they influence you?\n\nFor me, in college, it was Tom Dunne, a dean at Princeton. And at Santa Barbara High School, it was two people—Fred Warrecker, my baseball coach, and Tony Jackson, an AP U.S. History/Black tudies teacher. Dean Dunne was such an optimist, really believing in student leadership and innovation and providing endless encouragement and accessibility and belief in me; Coach Warrecker preached character and work ethic, “the limitations of talent and the virtues of hard work,” with just the perfect balance of crankiness, toughness, and a wry smile that betrayed an unconditional love of his players; and Mr. Jackson really challenged me intellectually, exposing me to a more nuanced understanding of diversity and inclusion and our own history as Americans, and about the privilege I still carried as a young person despite not being privileged financially. What is fascinating to me is how different the styles and values of these three men were. But in each case, I can trace many of the ways I think and behave on a daily basis back to each of them, for which I am infinitely grateful.\n\n1980s\n\nMonty Minchin ’83 writes, “Larry Thrall ’83 and I have been lifelong friends since Harvard School. He has been working in finance with solar power and alternative energy, and I have been in education for over 20 years. This year, we joined together to start our 501(c)(3), This Little Light Africa, supporting the most underserved in Africa. A few years ago, Larry’s solar business had him involved in Africa. I was running an online education business and was drawn to the region that Larry was involved in. If Larry could provide solar power to an area without power or with limited power, it only seemed natural to further support and extend education and jobs to empower the people there. Larry’s Nigerian partner, Pastor Isaac Komolafe, had already built wells, farming co-ops, and schools in Northern Nigeria. His schools and foundation needed a way to grow and provide better and wider services to the community. There were schools with no roofs and dilapidated facilities, no desks (or cinder blocks for desks), and schools and homes without power. Then COVID hit.\n\n“Because of the lack of medical infrastructure, people were locked in and could not work. Pastor Isaac reached out to us and asked if we could supply food and seeds for rice. That day, This Little Light Africa was started, feeding hundreds and providing seeds for rice for thousands in northern Nigeria. After providing these basic needs, Isaac and others on his team along with us, designated Makurdi, Nigeria, as a remote city that could be radically changed with additional support. Both farming and water wells had been provided for the 350,000 there. The next step has been bringing in solar power to provide light for the first time to many and improved education through structural improvement, scholarships, and supplies. If you’d like to find out more and/or provide your support, please visit www.thislittlelightafrica.org/the-story/.”\n\n1990s\n\nShawn Landres ’90 writes, “Glad to join Michael Jeon, Evan Sils, and Yanni Vourgourakis as Harvard Class of 1990 parents in the Harvard-Westlake Class of 2026, and honored to be serving as Chair of the City of Santa Monica Planning Commission. Hope to see everyone before too long for our makeup 30th reunion!”\n\nWestlake Class Notes\n\n1960\n\nVicki Goddard ’60 writes, “I had a wonderful week in Barbados at the end of January...enjoying island food and seeing lots of family...all before our world changed. Since March I have completed more jigsaw puzzles than I care to remember…. With luck the new year will help get us back to a norm, and in the meantime let’s be grateful to live in a time with telephones, email, FaceTime, and Zoom.”\n\n1980s\n\nChristina Huber ’87 writes, “This year has brought with it a roller coaster of both challenges and amazing new chapters. The best moment was my engagement to Gary Rhoades. We are excited for our new life together but will wait to have our wedding until we can celebrate together with friends and family.”\n\nMilena Jovanovic Radovic ’87 writes, “The year spent at the Westlake School on the AFS student exchange program from the former Yugoslavia left me with great memories. I am the mother of two great children, Milica (10 years old) and Marko (13 years old), living in Belgrade and working for the Serbian government as an FDI advisor. If you ever happen to be in this part of Europe, I will be glad to hang out.”\n\nSabrina Schick ’87 writes, “My daughter Sophie, who is a freshman at Indiana University, received the Dean’s Council Scholarship to the Kelley School of Business and is on the Indiana University water polo team. They are in full training.”\n\nHarvard-Westlake Class Notes\n\n1993\n\nLeslie Ivie writes, “I was recently appointed Vice Chair on the Los Angeles Commission on Civil Rights. The Commission on Civil Rights investigates complaints of discrimination and enforcement against violators, holding businesses and individuals accountable for discriminatory practices that deny equal treatment to any individual in private employment, housing, education, or commerce. I continue to work as an attorney at Restoration Law Center, a private law practice that guides individuals and nonprofits over obstacles by providing mobile criminal defense, nonprofit formation legal services, and training resources.”\n\nDan Ming writes, “I am still hanging around in Hollywood with my wife Desiree and daughters Aria (8) and Siena (5), working as a camera technician on various projects. The one I can’t wait to see the most is Top Gun 2, where I got to cross paths with Eric Guerin ’93, also working as a camera technician!”\n\nKara Nortman writes, “I have partnered with Julie Uhrman and Natalie Portman to found the Angel City Football Club, LA’s fledgling National Women’s Soccer League team. The founding investor group includes Serena Williams and her husband, tech entrepreneur Alexis Ohanian; 14 former U.S. national team soccer players, among them Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm, and Abby Wambach; Billie Jean King; and actresses Eva Longoria, Jessica Chastain, America Ferrera, and Jennifer Garner. Angel City will begin play in 2022 as the first major U.S. professional sports team with a women-led, majority-woman ownership group.”\n\nDorie Weiss writes, “Rebecca Neubauer ’07, LCSW, PPSC, and I enjoy cofacilitating a virtual teen girls group to help girls cope with anxiety during these unprecedented times. As a clinical psychologist, I have a private practice in West LA where I see children, teens, and adults in individual therapy (virtually). I also conduct neuropsychological and educational testing. My website is www.drdorieweiss.com.”\n\nNeha Wickramasekaran writes, “My husband Sean and I welcomed our first child Rakesh to the family in October.”\n\n1994\n\nNaomi Asher writes, “I’ve recently taken on the role of Vice President of International Neighbouring Rights at SonyATV. It’s been such an amazing bright spot in an otherwise insane year. I’ve loved every minute of my time at Sony so far and look forward to a long and exciting partnership. I’m still living in London with my husband and two boys but travel to LA regularly for both work and to spend time with my family.”\n\nSusie Monk Galiano writes, “I moved in May of 2020 back to California from Minnesota, where my husband Caesar, two children, Leo (8) and Victoria (10), and I lived for six years. I am extremely happy to be home and looking forward to reconnecting with HW alums. I am currently practicing labor and employment law at LightGabler in Camarillo. You can reach me at sgaliano@lightgablerlaw.com.”\n\n1995\n\nMark Ryan writes, “I directed my third documentary feature film, WINE and WAR, on Lebanon, its conflicts, and how wine is produced in the midst of this instability. In light of the August 4 explosion in Beirut, 100% of proceeds will be donated to CAP-HO, a charity providing medical care to children at Saint George Hospital in Beirut. To watch the film, visit wineandwar.com.”\n\n1996\n\nRachel Hanson writes, “With a heavy heart I share the news that my dad, Don Hanson, passed away on January 28, 2020. We celebrated his life on March 7 and 8 with a ‘Festival of Dad’—a weekend of laughter, memories, music, good food, family, and friends—including a party in his honor at our family home (attended by quite a few of his HW colleagues and former students). My siblings and I got to hear so many priceless stories about ‘Mr. H.’ It's amazing how many people remember his tie collection and his colorful day of the week sweaters! My heartfelt thanks to those who have sent condolences over the past few months—and the next time you hear a pun, a play on words, or a corny dad joke, be sure to think of him!”\n\n1997\n\nJessica Kronstadt writes, “On August 16, I became the 101st President of Women Lawyers Association of Los Angeles (WLALA). Established in 1919, WLALA has been a respected advocate of women attorneys, women judges, persons of color, the disadvantaged, and the underrepresented in Southern California. WLALA has over 1,100 members and is one of the largest local women’s bar associations in California. My parents, Hon. John Kronstadt and Justice Helen Bendix, administered the oath and swore me into office. I currently serve as a Deputy District Attorney at the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office in the Sex Crimes Division, where I prosecute child sexual abuse cases.”\n\n2001\n\nEric Altschul writes, “I’m living in Maplewood, New Jersey, with my wife, Ali, our two kids, Benjamin (4) and Isabelle (1), and our senior Brussels Griffon, Arnie. I work at Mondelez International, where I manage the Wheat Thins brand and a handful of other cracker brands.”\n\nJustin Barad writes, “Since starting Osso VR, a company that trains surgeons with virtual reality, we have raised a $14M series A led by Kaiser Permanente Ventures.”\n\nJaclyn Rosenson Clifford writes, “Jeff Clifford ’01 and I married in 2012. We live near the Harvard-Westlake Upper School with our two young daughters, Gabriella (7 years old) and Caroline (4 years old). I work in commercial real estate and Jeff works in film and TV development.”\n\nRyan Kriwanek writes, “I live in Orange County with kids Quinn (6), Piper (4), and Smith (19 months). I’ve owned my practice, Newport Oral Surgery, for five years now and was elected as chairman of my department at Hoag Hospital.”\n\nIndia Mandelkern writes, “I am finishing a book manuscript on the art and politics of street lighting in LA. It’s under contract with Angel City Press and should be out next year.”\n\nTaylor Roth writes, “Career-wise, I've been working as an IT system engineer. When the COVID lockdown occurred earlier this year, I had the opportunity to be part of the effort to allow the staff to work from home. More recently I have ventured into cloud infrastructure administration and continue to deepen my understanding of the subject. Outside of work, my personal life includes riding and repairing motorcycles, refining my metal guitar playing skills, and participating over Zoom with my SGI Buddhist group in encouraging dialogues and study sessions.”\n\n2002\n\nAshley Felts Anderson writes, “I married Steven Anderson in an intimate wedding at my parents’ home in Los Angeles in October 2020. We recently moved to Manhattan Beach and are thrilled to start our new life together!”\n\nWhy did you write this book?\n\nWhen I learned about Latasha Harlins, I wanted to write about that case and what it meant for LA. There are tons of these stories of miscarriages of justice in the U.S., but this one felt personal because I’m Korean American and [the killer] was a Korean woman in LA who settled in the San Fernando Valley, where I’m from. I felt a sense of complicity and shame because she was a member of my community.\n\nYour House Will Pay seems to be commenting on the connection between criminals and victims—that oftentimes people are both simultaneously or loop back around between one and the other. Was that intentional?\n\n[The African American characters] Shawn and Ray are both people who have committed crimes and spent time in prison; Yvonne [a Korean-born character modeled after the woman who shot Latasha Harlins] committed a worse crime and never spent time in prison. I would not say that this is a book devoid of good and bad characters, but I wanted to ask those big questions: What is criminal? What is wrong? Who serves time? Who gets away with it? So many people in the book are criminals by definition, but there’s a range in the things they do. None of the characters is perfectly innocent in any way. I was interested in examining the differences between different types of criminality and evil and sin. What is the crime of cheating on your spouse versus shooting someone who killed your cousin? What makes you a bad or good person and do those things track with the way punishment actually plays out?\n\nHow do you think social media affects the way violence and race are perceived today?\n\nIn the present day, all these stories play out on Twitter first. Social movements course through social media very quickly and in a reactive way, which has both positive and negative results. The way in which we process these stories has allowed for some really amazing things; for one, the engagement of young people is dramatically higher than it was when I was a teenager. But it also means that the knee-jerk response becomes the dominant one. It’s not always possible to maintain accuracy. I was interested in looking at those tradeoffs.\n\nThe reason the Rodney King story became such a big deal was because someone recorded it. If Rodney King were beaten today, he would be one among many. I don’t think we have more police violence than we did in the ’90s, but it’s more visible now. It makes it so we are constantly mourning somebody. Rodney King we didn’t even have to mourn; compared to all these other names, he was lucky, as crazy as that is. He survived. That’s just not true for many names of the present-day movement.\n\nWhat responsibility do journalists have in how they cover these stories?\n\nOne of the things the book is concerned with is the power of the story and who gets to shape the story. Sometimes it’s the wrong people. In the book, I explore the idea of losing control of the story of a loved one. I wanted to look at the collision between the private mourning and the public death. Journalists bear a lot of responsibility for that. The stories people want to hear are the simplified versions. You don’t get 300 pages to explain who somebody was every time. The news cycle is fast. There’s not a ton of room for nuance with the quick and dirty way that narratives about Harlins or Michael Brown [the 18-year-old African American man fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014] are put together. Without making any broad moral claims, one of the unfortunate things about how the news cycle works is how human beings are treated when they become subjects of national attention. When they become characters, there’s a loss of agency. It’s messed up.\n\nWhat do you want people to take away from Your House Will Pay?\n\nThe main thing I want to get across is that the division between the personal and political is a false one. That can only be maintained if you are shielded by great privilege. For a lot of people, these tragedies come to their door. Grace [the Korean American protagonist] is somebody who has this shameful legacy she has to deal with—and that she had been blissfully ignorant of before. Those literal circumstances are pretty uncommon, but that idea is very American. By being born in this country or immigrating here, you are in a system that has preexisted you by centuries and was built on some pretty awful things like genocide and hundreds of years of slavery. A lot of people don’t really grapple with that, but even if all that is invisible to you, it’s still part of you and what you inherit. We are all part of this. Shawn and Grace are characters who would prefer not to be involved in anything outside of their own family lives, but they don’t have that choice. They have that illusion of separation taken away—their lives versus the stuff of politics and the news. These are things that affect real people—and sometimes those real people might be you.\n\nArt of the Possible\n\nEvery fall since 2017, Harvard-Westlake has brought an artist to exhibit work at the Arlene Director Schnitzer Art Gallery as part of the Visiting Artists Program. Made possible by an endowment from Arlene Director Schnitzer ’47, who was a prominent philanthropist and patron of the arts until she passed away this past April, the program is intended to showcase art that shines a light on prejudice and injustice. Schnitzer, who attended Westlake School from 1945 to 1947 and was only the second Jewish student admitted to the school, hoped to improve the climate for Jews and others who faced discrimination at Westlake and elsewhere.\n\n“Artists are the chroniclers of our time,” says Jordan Schnitzer, Arlene Director Schnitzer’s son and a leading philanthropist and art collector in his own right. “They’re at the forefront, fostering discussion about issues in our communities. And just as we have a diverse population, we need art from diverse voices on diverse themes. That’s important for Harvard-Westlake students—for all of us—to experience. People think of art as an elitist thing, but my mother’s philosophy was that art is for everyone. She felt Westlake was a special place, and she wanted to do her part to make it even better for future generations.”\n\nThe middle school visual arts faculty selects each artist and organizes each year’s show in the Arlene Director Schnitzer Art Gallery in Wang Hall at the middle school. The artist opening, talk, and an artist challenge (where students are challenged to respond to the work with their own artwork) are shared with students on both campuses, and students, faculty and staff, families, and alumni are invited to come to the exhibit’s opening, view the artwork, and hear the artist speak. This year, the opening and talk were presented via Zoom, and in addition to the Harvard-Westlake community, students from Humanitas Academy of Art and Technology, a public high school in East Los Angeles, were invited to attend and ask questions of the featured artist, Patrick Martinez. The program exposes students to thought-provoking artwork and artists from diverse backgrounds, challenging assumptions and building empathy.\n\nHere’s a look at the artists featured so far:\n\nWritten in the Stars\n\nOn October 6, astronomer and UCLA professor Andrea Ghez P’19 ’24 was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics. She shares half the prize with Reinhard Genzel, Director of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics, “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the center of our galaxy.” The other half of the prize goes to Roger Penrose, mathematics professor emeritus at the University of Oxford, “for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity.” Only the fourth woman to win the Nobel Prize in physics, Ghez has spent more than 20 years doing the research that has now made her a Nobel Laureate.\n\nWhat was it like to find out you won?\n\nI got the news at 2 a.m., so I was fast asleep. The tradition is the committee makes their decision and then calls the recipients right away. I actually once visited the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and there’s a phone booth with the specific phone that they call the Nobel Laureates on. You get to speak to the head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the head of the committee for physics, who asked me to prepare a few remarks for their press conference an hour later. I hung up with a combination of shock, disbelief, giddiness—I kept thinking I must be dreaming—and made myself a cup of coffee. Luckily, I’m an astrophysicist, so I’m used to being up in the middle of the night.\n\nDid you have any idea you were being considered?\n\nPeople will tell you they think you’re in the running. But the minute you get wrapped up in “this might help you win a prize” or “this might help you be first,” you move away from getting the science right. This award recognizes my work and the work of a group I’ve been competing with for the past two decades. Sometimes I’ve been first, sometimes they’ve been first, sometimes it’s incredibly close. But there was a moment 10 years in, when I started having kids, that I decided consciously to give up on the concept of being first and really focus on getting it right. I was trying to figure out how to manage being at the forefront of a very competitive world and being a mom. When my oldest was really little, I remember going to my first conference, where I talked about my latest results, and my competitor scooped me because I hadn’t published them yet; I wasn’t in any shape to publish fast. There was a moment of being destroyed and then a moment of realization that first isn’t everything; take the time and get it right. I just decided to lean into that strength of being careful instead. And the work became more creative after that.\n\nWhat if your teams worked together instead of competing?\n\nThere have been many overtures over the years for the two teams to join forces, and I’ve explicitly resisted that. A lot of these measurements are hard to get right. Once you join forces, it’s kind of like a mind meld; you have to agree how to approach the problem. Over the years, we’ve had different approaches and gotten different results. My competitor and I definitely learn from each other as we publish, but there’s a lot to be said for the independence and space to do the analysis in a different way. I’m also much younger than he, so I was more aware of the danger of being subsumed. There is benefit to collaboration, but it’s kind of like when companies become a monopoly. There’s something useful in competition.\n\nWhat is a supermassive black hole, and how can you tell there’s one in the center of our galaxy?\n\nSupermassive black holes are black holes that are a million to a billion times the mass of the sun. And if you want to prove that these black holes exist at the center of galaxies, our galaxy is the best one to study because it’s the closest example; the next galaxy center is 100 times further away. While you can’t directly see black holes themselves, you can see energetic phenomena associated with things just outside the event horizon, which is the last point that light can escape. Why is all this important? Black holes represent the breakdown of our laws of physics. They’re a giant red arrow saying “work more here.” You can’t describe a black hole, because it’s an object whose mass is contained in zero volume. So that means the density goes to infinity, which in physics we call a singularity. It also means that black holes create gravitational effects that mix space and time, which makes them very intriguing subjects for lots of good science-fiction movies.\n\nHow did you do your research?\n\nMy work is all done with Keck telescopes, the largest telescopes in the world. Big telescopes allow you to see fine detail, but the Earth’s atmosphere blurs these images. I’ve spent a lot of my career working on techniques to correct that blurring effect. By getting that technique to work, we’ve been able to get the sharpest images of the center of the galaxy, discover stars at the heart of the galaxy, and then measure their motions. By detecting how they move, you’re tracking the gravitational influence of whatever’s inside their orbit. One of the quickest stars goes around every 16 years. Its orbit tells you that there’s four million times the mass of the sun inside a region the size of our solar system, which demonstrates the existence of a black hole at the center of its orbit. This has increased the evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes by a factor of 10 millions, which has moved the idea of the existence of these objects from a possibility to a certainty. And it’s been so much fun—these images have allowed us to not only discover the black hole, but also to understand that the region around the black hole is unlike anything we expected. It defies almost all our predictions about how galaxies should interact with their host galaxies. That’s another part of this project that I’ve enjoyed immensely. Not only has it allowed us to answer the questions we’ve posed, but we’ve also opened up more questions than we’ve answered.\n\nYou’ve said that your high school chemistry teacher was an inspiration for you. How did she influence you?\n\nMy chemistry teacher was the first female science teacher I had. She taught me all sorts of things, but her most important lesson came when I was applying to college. I wanted to apply to MIT early, and someone told me they don’t take girls. I went to her upset, and she said, “What’s the worst thing they could do, say no?” [Editor’s note: She got in.] Don’t be afraid of trying, even if people don’t think it’s possible. If you believe in yourself, just do it.\n\nDo you think of yourself more as a scientist or a teacher?\n\nWhen I was in high school and college, public speaking terrified me. I was one of those kids, if you were in a group and you went around to introduce yourself, my heart would beat fast just to say my name. But I really cared about encouraging women in science, so in grad school I asked to be a teaching assistant for introductory physics, which at Caltech, only the professors teach. So I had to convince them. It’s funny, because I was so terrified of teaching, but they didn’t have any women professors in the physics department at the time, and I thought it was so important. I ended up loving it. At first it was connected to convincing both the young women and the young men that women could be scientists by just being visible. Today I do all my teaching at the undergrad level, the very first introductory classes, because that’s where the role model piece has the biggest impact. I still see myself first and foremost as a scientist, but I’ve come to appreciate the power of teaching now more than ever because we rely on the next generation to think independently and have hard, complex discussions.\n\nI understand that you wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid. Why do you think you ended up exploring space in a different way?\n\nThe early moon landings inspired me, that’s true. It got me thinking about the scale of the universe and the concept of infinity. But quite frankly I had no idea what I wanted to do. There was a stage I wanted to be a dancer. I went to college thinking I wanted to be a math major. It’s important for kids to realize that not everyone knows what they want to do in the beginning. So many kids feel the pressure to understand where they’re going. For some, it is really clear, but for others it’s a random walk, and it’s continually evolving. It’s almost like asking a scientist, what’s your next research question going to be? I have no idea. You just keep pursuing and trying to figure out what you enjoy doing and how you’re going to put all these pieces together. But it's so important to keep trying new things because you never know what you’re going to enjoy.\n\nMission Possible\n\nReverend Anne Gardner joins Harvard-Westlake as the new school chaplain\n\nBefore coming to Harvard-Westlake, Reverend Gardner was the Director of Spiritual and Religious Life at Phillips Academy Andover, a position that included living in a dorm for 12 years. “It was super fun,” she says. “When you live with kids, you get to know them so intensely.” Despite school starting remotely, she’s also felt a “connection right away” with the students at Harvard-Westlake, starting with her first visit last year. “As I met people on campus,” she remembers, “there was just a joy and lightness to the place. It was palpable.” In this Q&A, she shares what her new role involves—and why teenagers are some of her favorite people.\n\nWhy have you chosen to work as a chaplain at a school rather than as a minister at a church?\n\nChaplaincy work, whether at a hospital or school or in the military, is an offshoot of what most of my colleagues do, which involves serving congregations. But most priests serve parishes where there are only a handful of employees, so your group of colleagues is quite limited. In addition, your evening and weekend work schedule runs in opposition to that of your friends and family. In contrast, school chaplaincy provides a schedule that matches the wider world. It is also a cycle I have followed for nearly all of my life. I was in school myself, through college, through a master’s degree program, then worked in university admissions for almost 20 years before enrolling in seminary and becoming ordained. The cadence of the academic calendar makes sense to me, and it means that I can have a life filled with colleagues, not necessarily doing what I’m doing, but working toward the same mission.\n\nWhat challenges has starting this job remotely presented?\n\nIt’s tough to start a new ministry in the midst of a global pandemic. Ministry is traditionally understood as a gift of presence. Normally, if I were on campus, I’d be sitting amongst the kids, going to their games, seeing their plays...you have so much time shoulder to shoulder with them, it’s much easier to organically develop relationships in person. So, in trying to build those relationships while remote, I’ve started to write to every student on their birthday. Now, of course, they don’t know me, they’ve never met me, so there’s a challenge in sort of cold-calling: Hi, I’m the new chaplain, happy birthday, I’m excited for you, hope there’s frosting in your future, know that I’m thinking about you.... And yet I’m stunned at how many of the kids write me right back. It’s wonderful. I’m also teaching Life Lab with [Dean of Students] Jordan Church and Teneice Stegall, one of the new deans, so that’s been helpful in getting to know some students. I’ve volunteered to be one of the HW Sibs leaders at the middle school and reached out to [music teachers] Zanaida Robles and Mark Hilt to invite kids to participate in the chapel music program. I have also been able to participate in the GSA [Gender & Sexuality Awareness] clubs on both campuses. I’m open to connecting in whatever way it can happen.\n\nYou’re a baseball fan. Who’s your team?\n\nI’m a Red Sox fan as a native Bostonian. I even worked for them for a couple of years and loved it, but they’ve already been eliminated from the playoffs. So I think I’m going to have to jump on the Dodgers bandwagon. I’d like to see Mookie Betts do well in Dodger blue.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the weekly services you lead?\n\nBecause it’s on Zoom, anyone who wants to come can come—students, parents, faculty, alumni, whoever. Just roll out of bed and tune in. It’s not designed as a Christian service per se, it’s for everybody. The first time I did a service I was thrilled to see over 60 people on the call. In a nutshell, there’s a brief introduction followed by a reading, which could come from a scriptural source, a poem, a piece of literature, lyrics of a song, whatever will set the right tone. Then I do a brief reflection on the reading and someone sings or plays an instrument, followed by a benediction. The gathering lasts between 15 and 20 minutes, just a way to start the day with some kind of musing you can chew on for the remainder of the week.\n\nWhat’s the best thing about working with students?\n\nA lot of people are reticent about working with teenagers. They can be tough, but if they can see that you’re really interested in them, if they can tell you actually care about them, they will forgive you almost anything. They will take you into their hearts in an instant. By the time you’re an adult, you’ve learned to filter what you say, you’ve learned how to smooth the edges. But when you’re a teenager you don’t have that polish quite yet. You’re just who you are, and it’s fantastic.\n\nIn the Name of Love\n\nEli Caplan ’14 on the Say Their Names Silver Lake memorial\n\n“There are so many names, it’s nearly impossible to stay abreast of all the killings,” says Eli Caplan ’14. In fact, there have been about 3,000 Black people killed by police in the United States since 2013, hundreds of them unarmed. “We might hear about the George Floyds, but there are so many others who are wrongfully killed and we don’t know a thing about them.” The names of almost 300 of them are rendered in strips of sheets, tarps, even tulle, woven into the chain-link fence around the Silver Lake Reservoir as part of a memorial organized by Caplan and his friend Micah Woods.\n\nHow did the project get started?\n\nIt was the weekend following the murder of George Floyd. I was going to demonstrations, but not everyone in my family felt comfortable because of COVID. Then I had the idea to put up a few names—Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery—on the fence around Silver Lake Reservoir, which is half a block from my parents’ house. My brother and I had already been putting up our protest signs; instead of just throwing them out after a demonstration, we’d tie them on the fence with twine. They’d only last a day or two before getting torn down, but soon we started seeing more signs near the ones we put up. Then I thought, if we weave a name with fabric into the fence, it would be a little harder to take down. So I threw the idea out to my family.\n\nThe first day, we only got one name up, but we thought, this was a cool thing to do as a family, let’s do it again. A few days later, my mom [Lia Brody] texted a few neighbors, and I texted a few buddies, and that day a group of about 15 got, like, 12 names up over three or four hours.\n\nThat’s when I realized what the scope of the project could be with community engagement. I said to my mom, half as a joke and half serious, we put up 12 names today—let’s get out here tomorrow and Friday and maybe we can get around the whole reservoir. That night, Micah Woods, a buddy of mine I’d invited to come down that day, put up the work we did on his Instagram. He has a pretty big social media presence, and 50 people responded wanting to help out. We thought, let’s do it, let’s get all these people involved, and we organized it together.\n\nWhat motivated you to do this?\n\nI didn’t have this idea in a vacuum; so much of the social change and dialogues taking place now wouldn’t be happening without the constant effort of Black Lives Matter. Following the 2016 election, so many of my peers and I were so energized, going to demonstrations, canvassing. But then you sort of lose steam. The news cycle shifts, you start getting back to the day-to-day grind. I’ve always had other people get me inspired to do things; I haven’t done much action on my own. But I have a brain and a heart and I’m a compassionate person, and how much injustice can you see before you do something? Not that anything I've done is really going to save Black people from being killed by police, but hopefully at least it’ll get people thinking.\n\nWhat’s the response to the memorial been like?\n\nPretty awesome. I didn’t expect the project to grow wheels the way it did. People walking by as I was putting up a name would ask what I was doing and say, wow, that’s so powerful, thank you for doing this; can I help? I’d say yes, I’ll be out here all day—just bring a bedsheet and we will set you up with a name, or you can find your own name. People would come back or sometimes stop jogging around the reservoir right then and there to help.\n\nAnd people with children, that was a big one. One kid walking by with her family asked, “Mom, what’s going on, who’s La’Vante Biggs?” [In 2015, Biggs was fatally shot by police in Durham, North Carolina, after his mother called 911 reporting that he was acting suicidal and had a gun to his head.] The mom said she didn’t know, but then saw another name she recognized and pieced it together, explaining: “These are the names of Black people killed by police.” To see that people were taking the time to acknowledge these people and educate their children about them—it was really inspiring.\n\nHow did the project expand?\n\nAt first we didn’t think about putting up bios, but then we started seeing people Google the names. They wanted to know about them. A name can still be kind of anonymous in a weird way. So we added a photo and statement about each person and put them next to the name. We also wanted to help people take direct action, so we also added links and descriptions of social justice organizations, including Black Lives Matter LA, White People 4 Black Lives, and BOLD [Black Organizing for Leadership and Dignity]. It’s easy to go to a demonstration and think, oh, this is so cool, we’re taking this stand together, but what’s next? I’m just gonna go home and have dinner. We wanted to inspire people to do something after reading someone’s bio: scan an organization’s QR code, get involved, donate 20 bucks.\n\nAfter we got all the way around the reservoir with the names, we had a candlelight vigil on June 14. It was way bigger than we expected—close to 1,000 people came out. Micah, my mom, and someone from White People 4 Black Lives said a few words, and then we walked around the reservoir together. I still see people come out with candles or flowers or write little notes and put them in the fence. Now we are working with the Silver Lake Reservoirs Conservancy to hopefully put up a permanent installation—a sign with three panels: one with all the names, one with the history of violence by the police against Black people in the United States, and one about the project and the community support.\n\nHow did your experience at HW affect who you are today?\n\nMy relationship with Harvard-Westlake is complicated. I was actually close to leaving after my sophomore year because I was pretty unhappy there, but quick shout-out to my dean, Pete Silberman, who came to my parents’ house for a big sit-down and convinced me to stay. I’m so glad I listened to him—Harvard-Westlake gave me such a solid educational foundation and work ethic that by the time I went to college at Pitzer, it was a walk in the park. I do want to mention that Pitzer was a very progressive campus with a lot of dialogue about social issues, and I felt pretty ignorant. I don’t feel like Harvard-Westlake did a good job preparing me for those conversations. I understand it’s gotten better over the past few years at creating spaces for those conversations and for people to explore issues of race and politics and socioeconomic standing, but I almost felt like when I was at Harvard-Westlake, it was a don’t ask, don’t tell kind of environment. I mean, I didn’t feel that way at the time because I just wasn’t thinking about it. But that was kind of the problem. We weren’t encouraged to have those conversations.\n\nAnything else you’d like to add?\n\nAnyone can start something like this. Micah’s not an organizer, I’m not an organizer. I’m a 24-year-old unemployed dude. It never occurred to me that my voice could bring people out to the street. I never thought I would be the one with the megaphone initiating change. We were just a couple of guys who wanted to take some action. We got others involved and it snowballed.\n\nWhere did the idea for NATAL come from?\n\nGabrielle Horton: I kept seeing articles about the Black maternal health crisis, like Beyonce’s 2018 Vogue cover story about how she had preeclampsia, which can be a fatal condition and is disproportionately more common in Black birthing parents. But when you’re reading headlines about celebrities like Serena Williams or Olympic gold medalist Allyson Felix having these near fatal complications, it’s different than hearing about them from people you know. Last summer my childhood best friend also developed preeclampsia and had her baby two months early. And she was like, I had no clue what preeclampsia was, no one warned me about it, I had never even heard the word. Her blood pressure had spiked and she had gained over 40 pounds in a few weeks, but her doctors were like, oh, you’re fine, you’re fine, until eventually her blood pressure got so high they had to induce labor. But when I posted on Twitter about my friend’s experience and it went viral with over half a million engagements, it really showed me how many people had had experiences of neglect and disregard in their medical care. That became the inspiration to start NATAL, an original podcast docuseries from my production company, The Woodshaw, in partnership with Martina Abrahams Ilunga from You Had Me at Black, a podcast featuring stories from Black millennials.\n\nNATAL features several stories from Black gay and trans parents. How do those identities come into play in the birth experience?\n\nGabrielle Horton: Everything is so related. When we talk about Black lives mattering, it’s got to be all Black lives: Immigrant Black lives. Gay Black lives. Trans Black lives. So starting the season with a lesbian Black parent was very intentional. We also have a Black trans father in episode 3. It’s important to normalize that Black parents come in different identities. Sometimes their queerness is not visible to their doctor, so it may not be something that immediately comes up in their prenatal visits or how they experience care, but they’re always navigating life as Black and. My coproducer Martina Abrahams Ilunga is of Caribbean heritage, so we knew we also wanted to talk to Black people from across the diaspora. We talked to parents who are low income or on state benefits and Medicaid. There's an Afro-Dominican parent in episode 3 serenading her toddler with her favorite lullaby in Spanish. We wanted to show that Blackness comes in a lot of different varieties, and all of it matters. All the Blackness matters.\n\nThe second episode of NATAL talks about how race isn’t the problem, racism is. Can you talk a little more about that?\n\nGabrielle Horton: The issue is not our Blackness, it’s how our Blackness is perceived by medical care providers, how Black parents are treated, how they’re talked to or not talked to at all during their prenatal visits, what access they’re given to care. We’re talking about forces in place for centuries. For example, Dr. J. Marion Sims founded the obstetrics and gynecology field as we know it by testing surgical techniques on enslaved Black women without anesthesia, and enslaved Black granny-midwives were expected to not only nurture their own kids but nurture and breastfeed their owners’ kids as well. And you can see how that history trickles down to today. Women of color experience postpartum depression at almost 40% vs. 13 to 19% of all women total. A Black trans parent in episode 3 was sterilized without consent the day after giving birth. And that’s historical—that was happening to Black and Puerto Rican women in the ’70s. That said, everything isn’t all doom and gloom. There are a lot of birth workers and advocates working to address these issues. How can we all do better? There are organizations you can donate to, you can take action at the ballot box, you can share resources and learn about these issues, including on our podcast and on our site, so you can talk about these things with friends and know what to look for and ask for from your doctor.\n\nSinmi Bamgbose: It’s about structural racism going back hundreds of years. I remember learning in medical school that the stress of being a Black woman every day in this country means higher cortisol levels circulating all the time, which leads to higher rates of pregnancy complications like preterm birth and hypertension. And then there’s the experience I’ve heard about from so many women: We go to the doctor and our concerns are dismissed. I actually see it from the other side in the hospital too; I hear that a patient is difficult, but when I go in to see them, it’s a Black patient saying “I’m upset because no one is listening to me.” Your education level and income bracket can’t protect you from your skin color. Black women face a lot of risk factors for developing depression and anxiety based on a host of socioeconomic and cultural issues, but they’re less likely to be screened for issues like postpartum depression. They may also fear that if they confess their feelings or concerns to their doctor, Child Protective Services may be called.\n\nHow did your experience at Harvard-Westlake affect your path?\n\nSinmi Bamgbose: All my best friends are from Harvard-Westlake. Being around people who are successful and driven since the age of 12 was great. And when you’re the only Black female doctor in a room and you say you went to Harvard-Westlake, people who don’t think anything of you are immediately like, “Oh! Well! You matter.” Which is annoying that they think that way, but Harvard-Westlake prepared me for the rest of my life, which is being in these spaces with a majority of white people who are appropriately impressed when they find out where you went to high school. In that way, just the way that our society is, Harvard-Westlake was really instrumental for me.\n\nGabrielle Horton: At Harvard-Westlake, I developed leadership skills as the president of Youth Ending Hunger and BLACC [Black Leadership Awareness & Culture Club]. Those organizations made me think about the role of public speaking, social justice, equity, activism, race, and class. At 16 years old, you don’t know exactly what’s going on, but you know there’s work to be done. In college, I started working in Congressman John Lewis’s office. What I loved about politics was connecting with people on their porches, at their small businesses, in their churches, even in barbershops. I got to hear what issues they cared about and what they wished their politicians would care about. It was great to help communicate the concerns of people who don’t ever really get heard. Then I came back to LA and worked for Mayor Eric Garcetti [’88], overseeing public engagement for South LA. Once I got to grad school, I was like, there’s got to be another way to approach these issues—running the same statistical models and doing the same case studies is just not getting us the results we need. So I started working at the NPR station there and thinking about how to talk about politics and policy and serious issues in a way that feels like friends talking on a couch. So that started my journey in media. While I’ve produced podcasts for other creators, NATAL’s my first baby, and it really combines all the things I’ve been wanting to do for so long: create a space for people to connect, learn new information and tools, and find ways to leverage that into self-advocacy, policymaking, and real structural change.\n\nThings are shifting in the dialogue Americans are having about what it means to be Black in this country. How hopeful do you feel about how that will affect Black parents?\n\nSinmi Bamgbose: So much is happening right now, it can feel overwhelming. Will things really be different when I have children? It’s definitely going to take time. But so many people are working for policy changes. People are sharing podcasts and articles. Within the medical community, we’re trying to educate other providers. I’m figuring out ways to be a part of the pipeline mentoring young people. That’s how the change is going to happen, across all industries. Having a doctor who looks like you can be so helpful and powerful. I’ve heard that so many times from patients; it’s generations of internalized trauma speaking. We have to continue to look out for one another. I am hopeful that that will be sustainable and sustained.\n\nGabrielle Horton: I feel very encouraged. One of the things we have been so energized by in our research for NATAL is how tightly knit the Black birthing community is. The network of Black doulas and midwives is expansive. Black folks have been birth workers since they got to this country, honestly, but think about the resources that can come from this radical movement that we’re in the middle of. In terms of race and racism, the birth working space is critical. How can we raise children to live full and whole lives if from the very beginning they’re marked as less than? Parents and birth workers need to have the tools they need to foster healthy and safe pregnancies. That’s what NATAL is all about. And so far it’s amassed over 125,000 downloads across North America, Africa, Europe, Asia, South America—it feels like everybody is listening. I’m excited to see what comes out of this, not only in terms of state and local policy support, but also how folks think about supporting Black parents bringing new life into this world.\n\nBob Collins ’60 writes, “The Class of ’60 would have held its 60th reunion on April 3-5. From a graduating class of 54, half of us are still ‘present and accounted for.’ Head of School Rick Commons would have brought us all up to date with a school we barely recognize—no military? no Wednesday chapel? and women on campus? YIKES. No yikes—HW today is our wonderful school. If memory serves us right—and even if it doesn’t—we still boast fielding Harvard’s best ever football and tennis teams in ’59 and ’60. Our banquet festivities plans included an after-dinner show by Tom Gundelfinger O'Neal ’60 performing 'The Way We Were' and a concert led by rock guitarist John Harris ’60 with his Pacemakers: Wayne Behlendorf ’60 on piano, Mike Miller ’60 on banjo, and Larry Marks ’60 on harmonica. FORWARD MARCH!”\n\nMort Hurt ’63 writes, “Sally and I returned to Seattle in 2019 after living five magical years in Sun Valley, Idaho. We now live in Edmonds, Washington, enjoying the beauty of the Northwest, four of our five daughters, and ten of our eleven grandchildren. Life is good.”\n\n1970s\n\nAlex Laine ’70 writes, “I became involved with Ventura Search and Rescue because it’s an organization that allows me to utilize my outdoor skills to help others in the back country who are in trouble, often in bad situations. To be successful, many skills are required, both physical and mental. The mental skills include map reading, GPS, medical, ropes, setting up rigging for extractions, and the ability to use this knowledge correctly the first time. We do this under stress or in challenging conditions, which requires clear thinking. It’s also physically demanding, as we have to get to the victim(s) wherever they may be, in the desert, snow and ice, rivers, you name it, night or day, rain or shine. We help with fire, floods, mudslides, or any other disaster. From a rescued person, parent, friend, wife, husband, brother, sister, or..., you will never, ever, ever hear a more sincere ‘Thank you.’”\n\nThomas McCarter ’70 writes, “I will be retiring from my job as Events Planner for the David & Lucile Packard Foundation (www.packard.org) that I have held for 20 years. I got my start by organizing dances at Harvard.”\n\n1980s\n\nBrian Ross ’80 writes, “Two of my children were admitted by audition to A.W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts, a public magnet arts high school in Palm Beach County, Florida. Each year, I put in roughly 400+ hours, year-round, to help many high-need students and their families figure out how to find a pathway into college and life as a fee-free volunteer college advisor. I work with many, years into college, to help them prepare for graduate school, or to open up opportunities in fields where I have worked or I have business contacts. I have also developed the school’s college fair into one of the top fairs in Florida, with more than 125 schools attending each year. This began from my service in the Adelphians and as a student member of the admissions committee at Harvard, working with Art Gibson in 1978-1979 and 1979-1980.”\n\nJim Glantz ’85 writes, “I left my position as the Vice-President of Leadership Development for the Wonderful Company (FIJI Water, POM Wonderful, etc.) to partner with a few other professionals and launch The Academy For Leadership And Training (TAFLAT). Our team does two things: custom leadership programs (including multi-day programs, offsites...) and leadership coaching (for all levels of leaders, all industries). If you’d like to contact me, I can be reached at Jim@TAFLAT.com.”\n\nMichael Kananack ’85 writes, “Seeing The Who was enjoyable, but the main enjoyment was sharing with Sargon Duman, brother Claude Kananack, Rick Farrell ’89, and my 19-year-old son Joe!”\n\nAlex Reed ’85 writes, “Recently celebrated 25 years of marriage with my beautiful wife Xantipa. Thoroughly enjoying our children, Malcolm, Miles, and Jackie, as they evolve into fine young adults. And happy to be overseeing human resources for the West Coast law offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.”\n\nChris Tregillis ’85 writes, “My family and I reveled last summer in the great outdoors on Mount Williamson and in Yosemite.”\n\nTed Weitzman ’85 writes, “I have been on hiking adventures across the Dolomites in Italy and all five national parks in Utah.”\n\nRoni Capin Rivera-Ashford ’71 writes, “In 1972 I married my hometown sweetheart and soul mate, Danny. December 2020 we’ll celebrate 48 years of marriage. After 20 years as a bilingual educator, preschool through community college, I became the Spanish-English translator/interpreter for our school district. Graduating with distinction in three years from CSU-Pueblo in 1974 and 44 years later honored by the president of CSU-Pueblo in 2018 as the Distinguished Alumni of the Year, I began my teaching career in my hometown of Nogales, AZ, on the U.S./Mexico border. While teaching, I wrote some nonfiction stories in both languages to capture the hearts and attention of my students by including their language and cultural traditions. The first story came to me in Spanish first and was published years later, in 2002. My Nana’s Remedies/Los remedios de mi nana was the first of three bilingual, nonfiction, award-winning books. National and international awards for My Tata’s Remedies/Los remedios de mi tata caught a Disney children’s book editor’s attention. Thus Miguel and the Amazing Alebrijes was created, and I was given the go-ahead to invite my screenwriter son, Aaron, to be my coauthor. As I travel and give author talks, I tell the story of how I was sent to a private girls’ boarding school in Los Angeles and would wake up in a terror of loneliness and anger at 2 a.m. That’s when I began writing. And today I realize my writing was a remedy to calm my soul and heal my woes in a natural way. That is what two of my bilingual stories are about—natural healing. Mr. David Coombs, my English teacher for two years, was also a compassionate advocate. Presently I am working on three projects: a statewide-binational, bilingual, multicultural literacy project bridging AZ and Sonora; my first YA chapter book—a bilingual biography of a genuine Dreamer born in 1916 in Cananea, Sonora, México, called The Life and Legacy of Raúl H. Castro, about Arizona’s first and only Latino governor and thrice U.S. ambassador; and last but not least, a multiseason TV miniseries spanning four decades on the U.S./Mexico border about two families—one owns the town’s business dynasty, while the other is made up of humble, athletic, salt-of-the-earth blue-collar workers. For decades, power, discrimination, betrayal, and secrets of love, tragedy, and triumph intertwine, involving two families and more than two cultures—AND THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG, ready for the perfect passionate producer.”\n\nLaura Weinman ’78 writes, “For the past three years I have been the chef instructor for the culinary training program at St. Joseph Center, a nonprofit in Venice, where students with barriers to employment come full-time for eight weeks of classic culinary training, food safety, and soft skill instruction, working toward the goal of jobs in food service. I am most proud of our 85% success rate for hiring in Los Angeles restaurants, institutions, and catering businesses as a means towards self-sufficiency and breaking the cycle of poverty. While much of this important effort has been paused due to the coronavirus outbreak, the mission of St. Joseph’s continues through our food pantry, delivering 220 bags of groceries daily to low-income families, and at Bread and Roses Café, where nearly 300 to-go meals are distributed daily to people experiencing homelessness. This is twice our regular output, which is a real indication of how devastating this pandemic has been to our most vulnerable neighbors. The needs are great and the work has been rewarding. With classes temporarily suspended, I am writing recipes and helping remotely with my whole gang, who are finishing their undergrad and graduate work from home. Anyone interested in supporting the work of St. Joseph Center or learning more can check out social media: sjculinary@instagram, stjosephctr@instagram, facebook.com/stjosephctr.”\n\nTracy Berliner Smith ’79 writes, “During this pandemic, when Zoom has become the preferred lifeline of communication, along with providing vitality in work-at-home situations, a group of very close Westlake friends have begun meeting to check in, laugh, cry, share, distract and enjoy ourselves. Surrounded by the comfort of our common bond (attending Westlake from 1973-79), we have strengthened our deep connection. We all met at age 11 or 12 years old, and are now in our late 50s, early 60s. This time visiting via Zoom has become vital and impactful to all of us. In scary, uncertain times, having these women to wrap their virtual arms around each other has been profound. We were already close but today we define that with new meaning. The group (not all pictured), from both near (California) and far (Italy!), includes the class of 1979's Terri Berglass Baird, Jamie Dotson Cipriani, Laurie Sigoloff Doyle, Leslie Knutson, Anita LaRue McAfee, Donna Lisciandro Navarro ’78, Holly Heston Rochell, Tracey Silberling, Jenny Taylor Litzow, Julie Welch and myself, has met often—this week, we shared recently discovered Westlake ’79 graduation pics on our Zoom. We had a ridiculous amount of fun looking at them together and laughing in Westlake-style hysterics! It’s just great to have these unbreakable bonds—solidified since 1973—and to reconnect with each other during a very difficult time for so many of us.”\n\n1980s\n\nDayna West ’80 writes, “I am still loving life in the San Francisco Bay Area. I returned to school last year and have nearly completed a certificate in psychedelic-assisted therapies and research. I was part of the fourth cohort at CIIS (The California Institute of Integral Studies). I left my position as staff psychologist in the department of psychiatry at Children's Hospital, Oakland, 20 years ago and have not missed the clinical work—until now! I could not be more fascinated by or hopeful about the promise of psychedelic medicine as it experiences this renaissance and am eager to find my place in the field. If you or anyone you know would like to talk about the program, the medicine, and/or its possible applications, please get in touch!”\n\nKaren Bender ’84 writes, “Received Honorary Doctorate of Divinity in 2019.

I’ve been managing two apartment rentals in Paris as well as helping foreigners navigate the real estate market to acquire property in France. Very intense, reminiscent of junior year at Westlake! Would love to hear from schoolmates on our FB group and can be reached professionally at Christine@home-hunts.com. (Do we have a HW alum group in Paris?)”\n\nLisa Niver ’85 writes, “I represented Ms. Magazine at the United Nations Conference (UN GA 74) in NYC earlier this year. I also attended Goalkeepers, the Gates Foundation Conference. I am working on articles on both now.”\n\nStacey Hine Copeland ’87 writes, “I started my Los Angeles–based interior design studio, Blythe Home, five years ago and have had the pleasure (and fun!) of designing many homes, offices, and restaurants. I just launched my online shop on Chairish, where I sell vintage home decor and art. I’ve been lucky to work with Harvard-Westlake alums and many parents and current students.”\n\nLaurie Flamholtz ’87 writes, “I married William Vu Tam Anh on February 1 at Il Cielo in Beverly Hills. The ceremony was nondenominational and we were surrounded by our family and closest friends. We live in Westwood with our beloved cat named Coco.”\n\nDebby Glupczynski ’87 writes, “I am making a big change this year and moving to NYC to do a one-year reproductive healthcare and advocacy fellowship (after having been back here in CA for 17 years!). The fellowship is an opportunity for me to get expanded clinical skills in contraception, abortion, and miscarriage management in a primary setting. There is also an advocacy training component, producing physician leaders in the area of reproductive justice. I am very excited for this opportunity! Also, my sister Becky ’90 has lived in New York for years, so it will be nice to spend more time with her.”\n\nWhitney Rosenson ’88 writes, “On May 26, 2019, I married Steve Sincoff. Celebrating with me were lifelong friends and classmates Wendy Recht Nevens, Alex Perkins Furlong, Liz Karatz Faraut, Monica Stagen Jensen, Emily Sikking Milam, Meredith Salenger, Ally Miller, Jane Feldstein Mass ’89, Anissa Banchik Siegel, Cara Familian Natterson, Justine Stamen Arrilaga, Kelly Foster, and Julie Handler Gottlieb.”\n\n1990s\n\nDana Guerin ’90 writes, “I am still trying to wrap my head around the idea that the class of ’90 would have been having our 30th reunion. There’s no way I’m old enough to be 30 years out of school. Oh wait, that might explain how my twins are actually graduating high school. My youngest is 14. And I’m about to complete another low-budget horror film. Was looking forward to seeing everyone in May and celebrating the extraordinary life of Joannie Parker.”\n\nHarvard-Westlake Class Notes\n\n1992\n\nCarl Gromberg writes, “I turned 45 this year and—now realizing that I will not live forever—have fully embraced middle age. I traded in my car for my first SUV in December, began wearing colorful, cartoonish dress socks to work, gave up trying to understand Bitcoin, and can't be bothered to figure out what Billie Eilish is singing about. But at least I’m not a boomer…. Sending best wishes to the 50% of my graduating class I spent six years with and more best wishes to the 50% I sadly barely got to know during my senior year, and welcoming all to reconnect/connect with me on Facebook (because TikTok scares me).”\n\n1994\n\nNaomi Wallace Asher writes, “I have recently become Vice President of International Neighbouring Rights at Sony/ATV. I am still based in London and am thrilled to be part of the Sony family.”\n\n1995\n\nCeline Khavarani writes, “I’m excited to begin my new job with Giorgio Armani as the Senior Vice President of Entertainment Industry Relations for the Americas.”\n\nEvan Horowitz writes, “Gayitri Budhraja ’99 and I just won three major marketing awards together, in a collaboration that started at our 20th reunion last year! Over dinner at reunion, we started talking about our respective work: Gayitri leading marketing at e.l.f. Cosmetics and Evan running an innovative marketing agency, Movers+Shakers. Soon we partnered to launch a TikTok campaign for e.l.f., which became the most successful TikTok campaign in history. We got celebrities from Ellen to Lizzo to join organically and wrote a song that hit #4 on Spotify's global viral chart. So eight months after reunion, we were on stage together receiving multiple industry awards. Go Harvard-Westlake!”\n\nDavid Soloway writes, “Allison Levin and I got engaged in January, and planned to get married in Cleveland (her hometown) in September. COVID-19 then intervened, and our plans changed. On May 28, after a few false starts and some technical difficulties, and a little more than one year after our first date, we were wed in my parents’ backyard. My parents, my siblings, and my niece were with us, and Allison’s parents and sister joined us remotely.”\n\n2000\n\nHillary Schwab Ethé writes, “Conservation work has always been important to me, as has serving my community. As an HW student and faculty member, I participated in beach and river cleanups, invasive plant removal projects, and community restoration efforts. My family now lives in Mercer Island, Washington, next to Ellis Pond Park, where we volunteer as forest stewards with the City of Mercer Island Parks and Recreation Department Forest Stewardship Program. We remove invasive plants and plant native species with our neighbors to support forest restoration efforts. I hope to inspire a dedication to environmental stewardship and grassroots activism in my children by continuing this work for years to come. Thank you to Tara Jones Eitner, Wendy Van Norden, and Vicki Goddard for supporting my love of conservation work since 1994.”\n\nMelody Ahdout Godfred writes, “I recently published my second book, The ABCs of Self Love, and had my third child, Theodore (Teddy joins my twin daughters, Stella and Violet, who are almost eight). I continue to manage my two companies, Write In Color Resumes and Fred and Far (a self-love movement powered by the Self Love Pinky Ring).”\n\nLuke Hornblower writes, “In September 2019 I left the New Jersey law firm I had been working for and joined the legal department of ICE Data Services in New York City. Coming into the city allowed me to see more of my father and half sister Natalie, who is turning 13 soon(!!), but also my older brother Sam, his twin girls, and his wife Emily. I was also able to finally attend my first NY area HW alumni event. Since early 2019, I have also been developing a car rental activity, catering mainly to ride-share and food delivery drivers in the area. Strangely, renting a small fleet of cars has been a highly cathartic experience for me. I have greatly enjoyed getting to know some of my customers and dealing with insurance claims from time to time.”\n\n2001\n\nJamie Goldblatt Manné writes, “I joined Kayne Griffin Corcoran as a new co-director after serving as the Director of the Marciano Foundation in Los Angeles for two years, after having managed the Marciano Collection for seven years. I am charged with expanding Kayne Griffin Corcoran’s community outreach programming, as well as managing the gallery’s growing list of artists.”\n\nBrian Nathanson writes, “My wife Janie and I recently had a baby girl named Fiona.”\n\nTrini Rios ’09 writes, “A little update—we had to push our July wedding back to probably summer 2022 when Oke [Bamgbose ’10] graduates from UCLA Anderson. Meanwhile, we’re so grateful to the fellow members of the HW community who open up their doors and share their resources with other alumni. Just a couple weeks ago, Oke joined a HW4L call! We are always so inspired by this community and recently had an opportunity to pay it forward in an unconventional way. :) While walking our dog and switching up our route, we came across a home that sported a HW Class of 2020 lawn sign. We got so excited that someone from our neighborhood (which we particularly cherish as first-time homeowners) goes to the same beloved school we went to, that we wanted to introduce ourselves! Since we couldn't do so in person right now, we wrote them a card. If there is any way that we can be a resource to this graduate or their family, we hope that we can continue the positive impact that the HW alumni community has had on us.”\n\n2010\n\nErin Moy writes, “I first became interested in the foster system when I heard an (incorrect) number quoted on how many foster children end up homeless. What I found out from there was how many foster children are actually in the system in LA County (30,000) and the odds they are up against once they are within the system, and that spurred me to find a way to get involved. CASA finds the foster cases that need the most help (cases that have been left unopened for too long or have special needs) and pairs them with advocates to assist the social workers and lawyers in finding a long-term solution for foster youths.”\n\n2013\n\nHugo de Castro-Abeger writes, “I began working at Bird Rides Inc. (the e-scooter company) last June. This is my first ‘office’ job, and it was not until month eight or so that I ran into Jason Fieldman ’98. He happens to be an engineer here who has been here for a long time. He told me he was a math teacher while I was at HW 2013-2017. Really cool to run into an HW alum and teacher!”\n\nThis Hero Wears a Mask\n\nValerie Lau ’03 on More PPE, the nonprofit that aims to make face masks available to all\n\nMore PPE, founded by Valerie Lau ’03 and her friend Amy Ng, started out as a way to donate masks to front-line medical workers. Now, as states ease shelter-in-place restrictions, it’s also become a place to buy surgical masks at cost—so everyone can stay protected.\n\nWhat’s More PPE’s origin story?\n\nWhen shelter in place started, I got worried. My dad works at Kaiser in LA, and I was messaging him all these articles about healthcare workers in Italy who were dying and asking him, are you guys ready? Is this going to be okay? I had physician friends in New York, and it all sounded very dire. I was like, Dad, you’re retiring this year—can’t you just not go to work? But obviously healthcare workers don’t have that luxury. He said no, this is when you have to do your part; the community trusts us.\n\nAnd I thought, if they’re forced to make that sacrifice, what can we do to help? A friend of mine, Amy Ng, and I started talking—maybe there’s a way we can raise some money, get in touch with some suppliers through personal connections, and donate masks to hospitals. Neither of us knew much about importing goods—I’m a corporate attorney and she works at LinkedIn—but both of us had good family friends who run factories in China, so we just had to figure out the byzantine process of shipping things into the U.S. We are now working with a friend in Hong Kong who ran a diaper factory but started producing PPEs [personal protective equipment] after the Chinese government told them either you shut down or you switch over. Now they can make a million masks a day.\n\nAt first, you were mobilizing people to make masks as well as donate them. How has your mission evolved?\n\nWhen we started, we were not only asking people to donate, but also teaching them how to make cloth masks, since supplies were so hard to find, and cloth masks were considered better than nothing. But surgical masks are better at filtration than cloth masks, and they’re easier to breathe through. They don’t stick to your face like cloth masks can, especially when you sweat, and when you’re done with them, you just toss them instead of having to wash them every time you use them.\n\nSo now that we’ve found a good source of medical-grade masks, we’ve expanded our mission: We want to keep donating surgical and N95 masks to the medical facilities that need them and at the same time support our community by selling surgical masks wholesale, at cost, to local businesses and others who need them. The better funded hospitals have gotten mask donations from people like us, but others, like the San Francisco Department of Public Health, which treats a lot of the homeless population, definitely still need masks. Those are the places we’re focusing on donating to now as we also make the shift toward providing masks for others.\n\nAs California and other states try to open up, helping everyone else get masks will go a long way to make sure everyone doesn’t get COVID at the same time. The rule of thumb is that if you go outside, you should be wearing a mask. But it is still hard. A lot of friends are trying to find masks on Amazon, but they won’t come for weeks, or there’s price gouging. We are trying to do some good and fill that need."
