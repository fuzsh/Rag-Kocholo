        "text": "In this dissertation, I explore the key elements that enable leaders to foster creativity in a virtual work environment; I thus contribute to the scientific discussion that increases our understanding of the links between leadership and creativity in virtual work. The research topic was investigated in four separate studies (1–4). The dissertation features a conceptual part and an empirical part, each of which consists of two studies. I used a qualitative research approach as the primary research methodology and combined several methods and the theoretical perspectives of both business-oriented and pedagogical research to understand the research topic more deeply and achieve more productive and reliable results. In Study 1, I executed a descriptive, interpretative concept analysis that clarified the fundamental concepts of the research—virtual work, creativity, and leadership—and determined how they are connected to one another in the research literature. Study 1 provides a map of the central concepts and defines leadership that fosters creativity in virtual work. The results show that leaders who efficiently foster creativity in virtual work understand the complex, multidimensional, and multilevel essence of virtuality at work and the role of both virtual and face-to-face interaction in mutual collaboration in organizations and networks. This kind of leadership utilizes both leadership approaches to support inspiring interaction and collective creativity at work and understands the significance of interpersonal interaction in the virtual work context and ways to exploit it. In Study 2, I applied myself to the philosophical underpinning of the study and explored the applicability of heterarchy as an ontological commitment to leadership for encouraging creativity in virtual work. The results show that a heterarchical ontological commitment is appropriate to leadership regarding creativity in virtual work. Heterarchy can help leaders comprehensively understand their roles in virtual networked work, develop supportive orchestration abilities, nurture co-workers’ creativity, and develop the most appropriate organizational culture possible. The results of Study 2 indicate that the three focal leadership challenges around creativity—understanding virtuality as a networked context, developing a virtual leadership mindset, and leading meaningful work for progress—and the two heterarchical leadership attributes of distributed authority to orchestrate work and supportive interdependent interaction are very strongly linked to one another. In Study 3, I investigated (a) the experiences of the key people in a case start-up regarding the learning challenges in leadership and collaboration toward creativity in virtual work and the meanings attributed to those experiences and (b) the measures they see as necessary to meet those challenges. The study was a single in-depth case study in the early development phase of a start-up operating in a global sustainable engineering sector. Study 3 reveals that co-creative and assertive coaching leadership in a start-up advance the stimulation of creativity and improve business forecasting and decision making that can contribute to superior credibility among customers. In Study 4, I developed a descriptive typology based on empirical data from a multiple-case study to identify and describe how leadership occurs in virtual work in various types of companies. Study 4 supports the conception of the present trend in leadership toward type B (the “collective mind”), especially in today’s realities of globally operating networks and more technologically advanced contexts. The collective mind operates via a virtual mindset. Its characteristics include shared values, meaningful work, collective intelligence, conscious reflection, transparency, coaching, empowering leadership by example, effective multichannel interaction, and assertiveness. Based on the research findings, I argue for a coaching and distributed leadership culture to help leaders inspire creativity in a virtual workforce. This culture means coaching people to flourish, supporting their professional growth, adopting distributed leadership by example, and encouraging collective creation. The main factors contributing to coaching and distributed leadership in virtual work are (a) adopting a virtual leadership mindset to support diverse knowledge management, (b) respecting collective intelligence to provide a seedbed for critical reflection and testing, and (c) developing social bonding skills, tools, and spaces to offer opportunities for learning and growth. A leader with a virtual mindset understands virtuality as a networked context realizes that leadership and the work setting are linked and that it is necessary to integrate the use of technology with the mindset for creativity, collaboration, and multimedia productivity. Respect for collective intelligence incorporates shared power and shared responsibility, paying attention to knowledge management, skillful recruitment and orientation, critical reflection and testing, focusing on people, and a climate of microinteraction. Moreover, leaders who care for their people and communicate with them actively and transparently through multiple channels while being visible in their cooperation with both employees and partners can better develop social bonds within the virtual work context and thus enhance creativity. This dissertation strengthens the benefits from integral theoretical pluralism in the future development of leadership theory toward creativity in virtual work. The findings indicate that leaders who advocate humanistic values and so care for and empower people support their meaningfulness at work and professional growth and that leaders who foster collective creativity can contribute to the common good of society. Keywords: leadership, virtual work, collective creativity, heterarchy, coaching and distributed leadership, virtual leadership mindset, collective intelligence, skills, tools, and spaces for social bonding\n\nIn this chapter it is demonstrated that the way in which leaders implement a decision largely depends on the nature of it, that is, whether it is strategic or not. Leaders must be as open as possible and not withhold information from the persons involved in the process. Therefore, they should distribute as much relevant information as possible to meeting participants before a meeting. At the same time, they must be able to steer the process. It is not unusual for there to be a separation between the formulation and implementation of a strategic decision. Often, it is the top leadership that formulates the decision problem and the middle managers that implement its solution. For this reason, it is relatively common that the top leadership signals that the implementation has been successful as soon as the middle managers begin to report positive results. This can sometimes happen even though most of the implementation is incomplete. However, there are also cases where the top leaders rule out certain implementation processes as failures when in fact they prove later on to be successful. A common problem in organizations is that leaders often inherit the task of implementing decisions that past leaders have made. In order to succeed with an implementation, leaders must understand the importance of the process. They must communicate their vision clearly, evaluate and monitor continuously, and allow interested parties to participate actively in the process. They should also understand that what at first may look like a failure, at a later stage may prove to be a success. Different types of decision implementations In order to implement a decision it normally implies that some form of change is executed in relation to the situation. Often, changes of various kinds create resistance in organizations. It is therefore important that leaders focus on the factors that are essential in order to achieve a desirable result. How leaders choose to implement a decision usually varies from situation to situation. There are two main factors that influence how the process will be executed. These are the size of the strategic problem and the time horizon. The implementation of decisions that have relatively small effects requires a completely different approach than the implementation of decisions that implies major changes and an extensive use of resources. In some cases, the entire organizational structure is changing. An organization that is in a state of crisis requires a completely different implementation philosophy than an organization that is about to undertake changes in its product range. In the first case it is important to act quickly, while in the other a long and gradual process is more appropriate. Based on the dimensions of strategic problem and time horizon, Hrebiniak and Joyce (1984) have defined four basic types of decision implementations."
