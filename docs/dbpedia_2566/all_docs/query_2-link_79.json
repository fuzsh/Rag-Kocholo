        "text": "It’s been a good long while since I’ve taken to the blog, and the end of the year seems as good a time as any to refresh it. Despite a few notable entries (and partly because I was a tad lackadaisical), this was a less than memorable year of reading. With that in mind, I decided to reflect on twelve standout works of art overall, including three plays I got to write about this year. Many of them came out or came to conclusion this year, but some are from a little further back. It’s be no means a best-of list—I didn’t watch nearly enough movies to make that claim—but it does speak to what stood out to me amidst a year of big personal and professional milestones. Here they are in alphabetical order, with a few other highlights tacked on at the end.\n\nBaldur’s Gate 3 (Larian Studios)\n\nUnsurprisingly, I came late to the Baldur’s Gate series, but once I understood what it is, I couldn’t wait for it to hit Xbox. Nothing can truly replicate the unique adventure of a tabletop roleplaying experience, but Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of two things on this list that got awfully close. There is a lot to be said about the breadth of the world and the way the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition rule set has been adapted to this format, but it’s the richness of the party characters and the variety of ways to get through the world that are really rewarding, even intimidating. It’s early days for Sprim, my Halfling Bard from deep in my roleplaying history, but I already can’t stop sneaking a few minutes of gameplay here and there.\n\nThe Bear (FX)\n\nThe Bear is one of two shows on this list that blew the socks off most critics this season, and there’s nothing I can say about it that hasn’t already been covered. Nevertheless, it’s wonderful to see a show demonstrate mastery of is own recipe while still leaving room to innovate. A lot of attention goes to the absolutely harrowing episode “Fishes,” and rightly so, but for me the most rewarding experience was in the very next episode, “Forks,” in which obnoxious Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) pulls himself together by going back to culinary basics. Watching him discovery true love for his craft made me miss getting lost in rehearsing a show: it’s absorbing (maybe too absorbing), but at its best it leant my life a pleasing clarity.\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\n\nThis movie had absolutely no reason to be as good as it was. Previous efforts to bring the Forgotten Realms to the silver screen had crashed and burned, and at the time, Wizards of the Coast, the company that owns Dungeons & Dragons (and is owned by toy giants Hasbro), was being pilloried by fans for trying to tighten its long-standing Open Game License. In short, there was a lot stacked against this movie going in, which made it all the more satisfying when the final product turned out to be funny, thrilling, and surprisingly moving. Some purists might scoff, but the hilarious talking-to-the-dead scene and the inventive way in which the heroes break into the hold of Neverwinter would be right at home in any campaign I’ve been part of.\n\nFela! (Olney Theatre Center/Round House Theatre)\n\nI saw a lot of good shows in the DC area this season, but no other gave me the take-home value of a Fela Kuti discography. Olney Theatre Center and Round House Theatre Company’s co-production of Bill T. Jones and Jim Lewis’s jukebox musical, presented back-to-back with a production of James Graham’s Ink, was a key feature in my article for American Theatre, and it really felt like an event. While the book is a little light, Duain Richmond’s performance as the Nigerian singer-songwriter and activist, backed by an exceptional cast and band, made me feel like I was in the presence of someone special. When Fela told me to get on my feet, I listened.\n\nGhost Church (iHeart Media)\n\nSometimes a podcast comes to you at just the right time, and that was the case with Ghost Church, Jamie Loftus’s exploration of spiritualism past and present, which was the perfect sound track for my (last?) spring break road trip. Harry Houdini’s tussle with supposedly bogus mediums, and their would-be champion in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, has become a major subject of interest to me, but what really makes this piece sing is the clarity and sensitivity with which Loftus treats her subject. While séances and spirit guides might just be hokum, they are part of a religion with a fascinating history and a lot more in common with other religions than you might think.\n\nHow Long ’til Black Future Month? by N.K. Jemisin\n\nI fell hard for N.K. Jemisin’s Broken Earth trilogy last year, and decided to put her collection of short stories early on my reading list for this year. In addition to being a great window into what was to come (you can trace Broken Earth and her current Great Cities project to entries in this volume), it was also a lesson in how to create a range of rich worlds and compelling stories in short form. The cloak-and-dagger adventure of “The Effluent Engine,” the yearning in the adult fable “Cuisine de Memoires,” the body horror of “Waiting Awake”: Jemisin gives you just enough of each, and that’s a gift. It’s made me want to dabble in the shorty story form myself.\n\nThe Jungle (Shakespeare Theatre Company/Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company)\n\nWhen I reviewed The Jungle for Washington City Paper, I had no choice but to break the mold. A production as immersive and complex as Joe Murphy and Joe Robinson’s epic, based on their work with London’s Good Chance Theatre in the real-life “Jungle” of a migrant camp in Callais, France, puts you into the action and demands to be taken on its own terms. While superbly crafted in its own right, the play’s exploration of displacement, ethnic tension, Western democratic malaise, White guilt, and even persistent hope clashed wildly with the glossy surroundings of Sidney Harman Hall, smack in the middle of DC’s downtown dining and entertainment hub. If anything, it added to an experience that, at the very least, puts a crack in your complacency.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon by David Grann\n\nIt’s perhaps stating the obvious, but even an adaptation with the quality (and sheer girth) of a Martin Scorsese feature film was never going to grasp everything David Grann accomplishes in his account of the Osage murders of the 1920s and beyond. While Scorsese delves deep into White complicity, often seeking to convict the viewer as much as the perpetrators, Grann’s book charts not only the murders themselves but also how solving them validated the nascent Federal Bureau of Investigation. Sadly, thanks to a third act in which he catches up with descendants of the victims and survivors of that time, Grann also suggests that what we know about the murders barely scratches the surface. Even kicking the case up the chain couldn’t stop the rot.\n\nThe Nosebleed (Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company)\n\n“Identity” is a term always at risk of being rendered meaningless by overuse. Playing with that is what made Aya Ogawa’s The Nosebleed, in which she and four other actors play versions of Ogawa herself, such a joy to watch. The Nosebleed is framed as an exploration of failure and parent-child relationships, including that between Ogawa and her father and Ogawa and her son, yet it is also assumes that there is no singular self that art—perhaps even life—can ever truly capture, especially when our relationships are in flux. As I wrote in my review for the Washington City Paper, that Ogawa cast a group diverse in races and genders furthermore proves that plays can still pose those challenges even while welcoming more bodies to the stage.\n\nSex Education (Netflix)\n\nMy fiancée is a longtime fan of Sex Education and put this show on our docket to watch together early in the relationship. We finally got around to bingeing it just in time for the fourth and final season, and it did not disappoint. Few works of art cover the breadth and depth of sexual pleasure, proclivities, and dysfunctions, and few shows cover any topic with sensitivity and respect for diversity. One thing I especially appreciate is how often the show returned to relationships, all of them complex but not all of them sexual. Otis and Eric’s ebbing and flowing friendship, for example, was a welcome constant. We love a show that celebrates platonic love amidst romance (looking at you, Insecure).\n\nSuccession (HBO)\n\nExquisite. It’s the word I most often associate with Succession, a Shakespearean tragicomedy unfolding in the cutthroat world of legacy media and the ultra-rich. As with The Bear, there is no shortage of more qualified criticism of this masterpiece, but also no shame in restating its praises. One of the great gifts—or curses—of Succession is how it makes you feel for the spoiled, elitist, manipulative siblings vying to take over their father’s throne, even as they stab each other in the back and enable naked fascism while purporting to be above it. Case in point: when shithead Roman (Kieran Culkin), the family’s resident edge lord, crumbles during his father’s funeral. Devastating.\n\nTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin\n\nIt was a sweet relief when my fiancée decided to buy a copy of Zevin’s much-loved novel for herself. Not only did it save me more months of waiting for my library eBook to come in, it also means there’s always a chance I could return to this sweeping exploration of friendship, creativity, and the unique relationship that blossoms (and rages) between creative partners. There is so much said and unsaid between gaming geniuses Sam and Sadie, and their coolheaded counterbalance Marx, and it all unfolds against an artform that, like them, grows in assuredness and complexity. Like The Bear, it made me long to get lost in making theatre again.\n\nOther Highlights\n\nBooks: The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver, Glory by NoViolet Bulawayo, The Witch of Lime Street by David Jaher. Theatre: Jennifer, Who is Leaving at Round House Theatre (my review), Here There Are Blueberries at Shakespeare Theatre Company (my review), Selling Kabul at Signature Theatre (my review), Falsettos at Rep Stage (my review). Video Games: Elden Ring (FromSoftware), Monster Train (Shiny Shoe), Slay the Spire (Mega Crit). Television: Atlanta (FX), Gilmore Girls (WB), Barry (HBO).\n\nLast year’s reading list was as eclectic as the one before it. I returned to personal favorites like The Lord of the Rings, ticked off classics like Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, and dug into the back catalog of authors who had previously struck a chord with me, like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. As ever, there were books that were more admirable than enjoyable (Marlon James’s dizzying A Brief History of Seven Killings probably deserves a second look) and some that were a bit of letdown (maybe John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces deserves a second look, too). The ones you see here are the ones that really hit the spot in one way or another, presented in the order in which I read them. If you’re interested, or bored, you can check out my 2021 list, too.\n\nThe Fifth Season by N.K. Jemisin\n\nJemisin’s Broken Earth Trilogy is a towering achievement in science fiction, and I devoured it all this past spring. The saga rings with Big Themes—racial castes, colonialism, eugenics, environmental disaster—but The Fifth Season plants a heart firmly at the core, ensuring that even when the final installment threatens to go off the rails, you can’t help but stay glued to the page. It also benefits from a little narrative sleight of hand that not only rewards a careful reader but drives home just how tenuous one’s grasp of self can be, especially in an increasingly inhospitable world.\n\nAll’s Well by Mona Awad\n\nAwad’s darkly comic tale about a university theatre professor who finds a mysterious and nefarious way to overcome her chronic pain while chasing formers glories is one of two books I read about the seedy underbelly of theatre programs, the other being Susan Choi’s Trust Exercise. The pair merit their own blog post, but for now, it’s enough to say that while Awad’s mix of mystery and magic is sometimes overly opaque, a drumbeat of desperation makes the reader ache for the poor professor and dread what she might do next. It helps that I’m pretty familiar with Shakespeare’s All’s Well That Ends Well (I played the obnoxious Bertram in college), not to mention the petty contests that really give a Drama Department its name.\n\nAmerican Gods by Neil Gaiman\n\nConfession: I am woefully unschooled in the work of Neil Gaiman. When I read Good Omens a couple of years ago, I was mostly there for Terry Pratchett. With American Gods, I finally got a look at why Gaiman commands a following as deep as it is broad. His sprawling story of a lost man wandering a world populated by decaying deities, malevolent modern powers, and twisted Americana had exactly the balance of mundane and mythical that I love. That it all draws from wells of truth—true beliefs, true places—makes it that much more affecting.\n\nThe Yiddish Policeman’s Union by Michael Chabon\n\nAfter last year’s disappointing Summerland, I got the Chabon treat I was hoping for with this wry detective caper set in an alternate reality in which Jews were given a frosty slice of Alaska to call home after the horrors of World War II. Like American Gods, Chabon’s Yiddish Policeman’s Union works on many levels: a thriller with a wisecracking gumshoe at its tale; a fantasia that cuts deep on matters of race, ethnicity, and religion; a bittersweet ode to lost hope and second chances. It’s simultaneously not as peculiar as its setting might imply and yet just as absorbing as you hope any alternate reality could be.\n\nThe Sympathizer by Viet Thanh Nguyen\n\nAs I wrote last year of Charles Yu’s Interior Chinatown, there is something arresting about being addressed by a book. Nguyen’s opus doesn’t work quite the same way—the main character’s sprawling confessional is written to someone known only as “Commandant,” rather than to “You”—but it’s still achingly intimate, even through its bravado. Nguyen’s anti-hero, a Viet Cong double agent who follows the general he has been spying on to the United States, is trapped in a knot of competing ideologies that grows tighter as the novel unfolds. It’s hard not to sympathize with the agent, even amidst his many compromises and crimes.\n\nI Like to Watch by Emily Nussbaum\n\nWhile all the books on this list moved me in some way, only Nussbaum’s prompted me to take on a new role, namely that of a DC theatre critic (check the bylines in the Washington City Paper and DC Theatre Arts). Nussbaum is a venerated TV critic whose thoughtful reviews and illuminating profiles chart some of the biggest developments in the medium. While Nussbaum’s aesthetic insights are significant, it’s the way she tags TV’s role in shaping and reflecting society that really sticks out. Her rambling but absorbing essay on coming to terms with Woody Allen is a must-read.\n\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot Diaz\n\nMy girlfriend has been pushing me to read this personal favorite of hers for years and I finally get why. Diaz traces the sad, desperate struggle of a bona fide nerd and the woman he loves across the United States and the Dominican Republic, trapping them through the Dominican’s political upheaval and an alleged curse that seems to doom Oscar from the start. Effusively narrated (and meticulously footnoted) by Oscar’s friend, Oscar Wao is the kind of book that rises above by virtue of how it is told.\n\nChocolate City: A History of Race and Democracy in the Nation’s Capital by Chris Myers Asch and George Derek Musgrove\n\nAsch and Musgrove’s book has been on my unofficial list for a long time—I even considered snagging a copy from Chelsea School, where I was teaching with Young Playwrights’ Theater throughout the spring semester. It was worth the wait, too. The District’s complex politics, characterized by racial and class conflict and a long, frustrating march toward home rule, can and has filled countless volumes, but Asch and Musgrove make it remarkably easy to grasp. It helps that DC has always been populated by fascinating figures, many of whom anchor the authors’ exploration of the ways race and power have made Washington, DC both a paragon of the American promise and damning evidence of that promise’s many failures.\n\nUncanny Valley by Anna Weiner\n\nWeiner’s smart memoir charts her path from the relatively staid world of East Coast publishing into the hyperactive, start-up driven world of Silicon Valley, a place where her eye for culture is simultaneously an asset and a liability. While her insights into the tech industry’s insularity and penchant for rewarding egomania and overworking are acute, Weiner’s sensitivity, both toward the people she meets and to her own susceptibility to the Valley’s unique demands, render her work as reflective as it is revelatory. It’s a must-read for anyone trying to find their place in any new realm of work.\n\nPriestdaddy by Patricia Lockwood\n\nSpeaking of incisive yet affecting memoirs, Lockwood’s reminiscence on returning to her childhood home is striking to the point epic. Poet Lockwood became Twitter famous for her off-kilter sensibilities and dry humor, so it might seem totally incongruous that she could be the son of a rebel-turned-priest of a father and a perpetually fearful, ardently Catholic mother. In reality, a religious upbringing, complete with Catholic idiosyncracies and lead by her even more idiosyncratic father, is the perfect soil to a grow a writer capable of wit, gonzo stylings, and heart.\n\nA Visit from the Goon Squad by Jennifer Egan\n\nEven though I wrapped this dazzling Pulitzer-winner on the first day of the year, I am still counting it as one of the standout reads of 2022. Egan’s masterpiece appears on many “best of the decade/century” lists and for good reason. Each chapter follows a different character through a tangled web of aging punk rock impresarios and lost souls, jumping backward and forward in time and cycling through a myriad of styles. It’s an exacting meditation on what time wreaks on memory, relationships, and art, not to mention a technical tour de force from Egan, who is absolutely flexing from the first page to the last.\n\nIt’s been less than 48 hours since the men’s World Cup ended with what some are already calling the greatest final of all time. It’s true, the game was a stone cold classic, so much so that it threatens to obscure other storylines in what is already one of the most controversial editions of a tournament that loves controversy. There’s a lot that’s already been written, which is why I put together this link-heavy recap inspired by two theatre newsletters I receive on a weekly basis: Brian Herrera’s #TheatreClique and Lauren Halvorsen’s Nothing for the Group. It’s far from exhaustive, but it does highlight some of the most significant moments and some of the best articles, podcasts, and shows I came across over the course of the tournament.\n\nFor starters, take time this holiday season to familiarize yourself with decades of FIFA corruption by watching Netflix’s FIFA Uncovered. It’s an important piece of context for this tournament’s biggest issue—Qatar’s unsuitability as a World Cup host thanks to its human rights record and sweltering temperatures—because it demonstrates that this is hardly FIFA’s first time allying with authoritarian governments or granting hosting rights through dubious procedures. For more about Qatar in particular, check out “Welcome to Qatar!” and its follow-up “They Built This City” from Vox’s Today, Explained podcast series, Miguel Delaney’s much-needed reminder about the working conditions amidst the tournament, and a Washington Post explainer on how the tiny country managed to squeeze in the world’s biggest sporting event. Oh, and fans of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver should check out his first, second, and third episodes on FIFA, the last of which is dedicated to Qatar.\n\nQatar’s staging of the World Cup will forever be tied to the other big legacy project that came to a head this month: Lionel Messi’s quest for the one trophy that had eluded him. Messi is the subject of the superb NPR podcast The Last Cup hosted by Jasmine Garsd, who relates her own departure from Argentina to Messi’s complex relationship with his homeland. For some commentators, like ESPN’s Gabriele Marcotti, Messi never really needed the World Cup to cement his place at the sport’s top table, but it’s hard to argue that it doesn’t help. For all Messi’s brilliance, there are larger complications and implications that come to the fore any time the national team and its greats are on the world stage. Erika Denise Edwards, for example, boldly outlines why Argentina’s national team appears to have no Black players, pointing to complex (often oppressive) racial politics in the region. Furthermore, Messi came into the tournament already tied to Qatar’s own (multi-)national project by virtue of his place at Paris St. Germain, a French club owned by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. This will not be the last time the GOAT lends his legacy to a tournament: Messi has already been coopted into conflicting bids for future World Cups, one featuring Argentina and one featuring Saudi Arabia, the latter of which has hired him on as a nationwide spokesperson. As Dave Zirin and Jules Boykoff see it, this tournament was really a win for Qatar and its sportswashing program, which suggests Saudi Arabia might try something similar. The tournament even had time for one final flourish of controversy when Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani of Qatar placed a bisht, a traditional men’s cloak worn as a sign of status and on special occasions, around Messi’s shoulders before he lifted the trophy, a movie that was praised by many in the region but criticized by Western pundits and viewers.\n\nOne of the most intriguing themes that emerged from this World Cup, one that I think will shape the scholarship on this tournament going forward, is the sticky matter of who has the right to criticize whom. FIFA President Gianni Infantino made that very clear in his extraordinary (and extraordinarily bizarre) monologue delivered on the eve of the tournament, in which he not only lambasted Westerners for their hypocritical stances on Qatar but attempted to sympathize with the oppressed through a series of peculiar “I feel”statements—”Today I feel African. Today I feel gay. Today I feel disabled.”—and the dubious notion that he can relate because, after all, he was a red-headed kid with freckles who got bullied. It was a remarkably political speech for the leader of an organization that explicitly bans political speech in the stadium, a subject that came to a head in the clash over the OneLove armband that the captains of several European teams planned to wear in support of LGBTQ+ rights. This fairly innocuous statement was deemed inappropriate by FIFA, who moved the even vaguer “No Discrimination” armbands they had planned for the quarterfinals forward to the group stage. This didn’t stop German players from covering their mouths ahead of their opening match against Japan to indicate that they were being silenced, a gesture that sparked controversy and illuminated the very different worldviews brought to bear on the tournament. The situation got so bad that Denmark even considered leaving FIFA. As usual, despite FIFA’s efforts to contain political speech, gestures had a prominent place in athlete activism: Iran’s team, for example, made headlines when they refused to sing the national anthem, drawing attention to protests back at home, while England continued to take the knee before the start of their matches.\n\nWhile I kept my eyes on the headlines, I also found things to cheer on the pitch. If you know me, then you know I always back the African teams. As Michael Cox’s excellent breakdown shows, after years of fitful progress, this was a banner tournament for African sides: two teams, Morocco and Senegal, got into the second round for only the second time in history; all five African teams won at least one game for the very first time; and major developments in recruitment and tactics yielded big results. Even better, Morocco went on to become the first African semifinalist. Morocco’s status as an African team became a subject of discussion in itself; as Hisham Aïdi fascinating article for Africa is a Country demonstrates, the country has a complicated relationship with both Africa and the Arab world. As Sean Jacobs writes for The New York Times, one of the biggest developments affecting successful teams like Morocco and Senegal was the rise of African coaching talent. These jobs have traditionally gone to European “mercenaries” with European credentials; this shift in hiring suggests the path forward for African teams may start much closer to home.\n\nThe World Cup will be very close to home for North Americans in less than four years’ time when a newly-expanded tournament spreads out across Canada, the United States, and Mexico. Hopefully, it will inspire the same level of political scrutiny as seen in Qatar—the AFL-CIO has already gotten the ball rolling on that. It may also inspire the home nations, including the United States, to build on a mostly successful tournament (Mexico’s first group stage exit in decades being the exception). As ever, much of that comes down to the manager; Bill Connelly provides a measured assessment of what coach Gregg Berhalter has accomplished and what he or the next coach should try next. Ideally, that would include avoiding more internal strife and PR tussles with promising young stars like Giovanni Reyna, the son of ex-USA captain Claudio Reyna, whose attitude nearly had him on the plane home; as Doug McIntyre writes of the incident and its public airing, it’s the kind of situation where no one looks good. It might also include nixing billboard “letters” from fantasy soccer coaching legend Ted Lasso and keeping the asinine “football vs. soccer” debate from rearing its head yet again; hopefully, American soccer culture will have evolved past all that. Of course, we don’t have to wait long for an American team to excel at the World Cup: the women’s edition will be in Australia and New Zealand next year, and the USWNT will be vying for a third consecutive title and record-extending fifth trophy overall. Meanwhile, their activism off the pitch is already reaping benefits: their historic collective bargaining agreement with the men earned them half of the USMNT’s payout for advancing to the second round—at $5.8million, it’s more than they got for winning the 2019 World Cup.\n\nSpare a thought for American coverage, beginning with celebrated journalist Grant Wahl, who made headlines twice for the worst reasons: first, when he was barred from entering one of the stadiums because he was wearing a Pride t-shirt, then when he died very suddenly due to an aortic aneurysm. Wahl’s death resulted in a rush of tributes, including this touching remembrance from former colleague John Wertheim at Sports Illustrated. Wahl inspired the love and respect of a generation, which is much more than can be said of Fox’s World Cup coverage, as this absolutely scorching takedown from Aaron Timms will attest.\n\nI could go on, but I’ll conclude with a couple of points. First, the tournament threw up some great goals (Richarlison’s bicycle kick), great saves (watch Emiliano Martinez’s textbook one-on-one against France at 4:10), and great upsets (Saudi Arabia over Argentina, Japan over Germany, and basically Morocco’s entire run to the semis). It had a lot of what you would want from a World Cup on the pitch, and despite all my hand wringing over whether I should even watch, I’m glad I tuned in. But second, it still should not have happened in Qatar, it still needs to be done better when it comes to the Americas, and fans still have a responsibility to push for justice. Despite some positive developments, Amnesty International is still pressuring FIFA to establish a legacy fund to support workers and the families of those who have already died. If you love the World Cup but hate how it’s made, consider giving them some support. #PayUpFIFA\n\nNOTE: Last summer, I made a private commitment to write a blog post every month for a year. It was partly an effort to actually use this website and partly a way to force myself to write for a general audience. The endeavor has been helpful in both senses but considering I am fudging the rules with this last one, it’s also a reminder that I was never much for publishing regularly. Expect the occasional update from now on.\n\nNext week, I wrap up another round of work with Young Playwrights’ Theater, an organization that has generously given me a regular outlet since I arrived in the DC area. This year’s assignment was at Chelsea School, which serves secondary students with learning and language processing difficulties. The two classes I taught, one for middle-schoolers and one for high-schoolers, were a challenge at times, partly because of my efforts to adapt to the students’ needs and partly because changes in the arrangement made it difficult to plot out a consistent plan for the whole semester. Nevertheless, it’s been a rewarding experience that has reminded me of what being a teaching artist can give to the teacher and the artist.\n\nFor starters, being a good teaching artist is synonymous with being flexible. After over a decade of working with K-12 students of all ages, I have come to expect that no program will unfold within the same parameters week by week. Rarely does a teaching artist come into a school with control over their space, their time, or their attendance. Often they are part of a larger effort to engage students who need stimulation, as was the case at Chelsea. Ultimately, they are there to suit the larger priorities of the school, which is perfectly fine. In fact, it’s good for artists, and teachers, to recognize that many students first encounter the arts as a diversion and most tend to stay in that mode. Whether that speaks to the limits of arts instruction in schools is an issue for another day. For now, it’s enough to say that teaching artists bring something valuable to students when they offer a release from the regular school day and an opportunity to explore other interests.\n\nBeing a teaching artist also gives practitioners a chance to reacquaint themselves with the basics. As a playwright, a lot of the mechanics of a script—exposition, inciting incidents, rising action, objectives and obstacles, etc.—seem like second nature. The truth, of course, is that my practice began somewhere; teaching the fundamentals takes you back to that place and forces you to look at it with fresh eyes. Doing so helps artists and educators at all levels because it reminds us that prior knowledge is the foundation of advanced learning and good scaffolding helps students go to the next level. The time I spent at Chelsea this semester will no doubt pay off if I get to teach the craft at the college level, just like pulling together our two plays—sci-fi epic Against the Dying Light (Part I) and magical coming-of-age adventure Harper Holly and the Mysterious Artifacts—will help my own craft.\n\nAs I take stock of where my work as a teaching artist fits into the academic and professional realms, I see the potential for clearer conversations about what a teaching artist can do. As a staff member at Texas Tech University, I got to collaborate with students in the School of Theatre and Dance’s community engagement course, one of their core requirements. This gave me an opportunity to pass on some of the practical wisdom I garnered from my administrative position and receive some new ideas in return. As I look ahead to my next steps, I am thinking about how to make support like that available to others. Teaching artists play a vital role in the landscape of arts instruction but I imagine they often fall through the cracks between institutions who need them to do a job with minimal supervision. Bridging those gaps and providing specialized instruction ahead of time can only help raise the level for all involved.\n\nDispatch from the Dissertation: Why is This a Soccer Story?\n\nLater this summer, I will have the privilege of traveling to England to conduct some research for chapter two of my dissertation, which focuses on dramatizations and reenactments of the Christmas Truce. The Christmas Truce refers to a series of brief ceasefires—multiple truces, really, not one—that unfolded across the Western Front on Christmas Day of 1914, just a few months into World War I. Allied and German soldiers left the trenches for No Man’s Land, where they exchanged gifts, sang carols, and played impromptu games of soccer. Since then, the Christmas Truce has become one of the most enduring stories from the Great War. It has also become, somewhat strangely, a “soccer story,” particularly over the past twenty years or so. Indeed, by the time the centennial rolled around, Britain was all in on that narrative, dedicating a memorial of a pair of hands shaking in the outside of the ball, hosting various reenactments and commemorative matches across the world, and releasing high-profile dramatizations such as this Saintsbury’s ad and a play called The Christmas Truce, produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company. What was once a peripheral element of a remarkable event is now its primary feature.\n\nOne of the key aspects of this “soccer story” is the mythical notion that soccer briefly “stopped the war” and proved its capacity to transcend basically anything. Even for the most committed soccer fan, this is a stretch. In reality, the Christmas Truce is part of a larger shift in Britain that has seen soccer become an increasingly prominent site of militaristic and nationalistic commemoration, as observed by scholars such as Iain Adams and Daniel Fitzpatrick. This is to say nothing of the commercial possibilities afforded to the likes of Saintsbury’s and Budweiser, the latter of which released a historically dubious video called “World War Truce” as part of its Rise as One series in anticipation of the 2014 World Cup (Budweiser is, of course, one of the World Cup’s biggest sponsors). For my part, I am fascinated by the part performance plays in reifying these myths, whether that be in dramatizations or reenactments. There is something about embodying this narrative that contributes significantly to the larger commemorative project, and I aim to excavate that phenomenon in detail. This case study will make an excellent addition to dissertation, which examines how soccer performances on the pitch and on the stage wrestle with what the sport is supposed to “do.” In one sense, the story of the Christmas Truce is evidence that, in a way, it can do quite a lot.\n\nWaiting for Godot: An Abilene Audience from 2009 Weighs In\n\nIn 2009, I did what any self-respecting small-town theatre student staring down the barrel of graduation would do: I got some friends together and staged Waiting for Godot in our theatre’s underground laboratory space. I figured Beckett’s classic was the kind of show that a conservative town like Abilene, Texas just “needed” to see, and I figured it was a way for me to take the next step as an artist, which is partly why I took on just about every job myself, including the role of director and co-lead Didi. It was ambitious and pretentious—I even insisted we say “GOD-oh,” instead of the much more widely used “guh-DOH”—more than it was artistically successful, but it remains one of the fondest memories of my theatrical life. A lot of that is the fact that my friends and I did it on our own steam: thanks, forever and ever, to Adam Singleton, Spencer Williams, Natalie McBride, Chesna Riley, and everyone else who stepped in and kept my from floating away on my own ego.\n\nLast weekend, I pulled my show folder out of storage at my parents’ house and soaked up the memories. It’s all in there: production photos, notes, character development projects, doodles, program drafts, receipts. It’s a fantastic little archive (yes, I said it) of a special time that I am so thankful I kept. The real standout piece, however, was a set of audience questionnaires that I completely forgot about. It asks a simple but enduring question: who is Godot? I took the liberty of providing some options and the results of the surveys are so distinctly of the time and place. The surveys collected 53 responses (which is perfect considering the play debuted in Paris in 1953). Prominent on my list of options are such oh-so-2009 issues such as Change, the joint-top answer with 9 votes, along with the Stimulus Package (1) and Universal Healthcare (0). Change was tied with Nothing (9), followed by God (7), The Answer (4), Happiness (4), Christ (3), Revolution (3), Other: Meaning (2), Death (1), and a Leader (1). Pozzo, Samuel Beckett, Freedom, Work, and Punishment received 0 votes, although one person did claim Samuel Beckett was God. Apart from the two “Meaning” answers, the Other option had such stellar entries as “Hope”; “The unfulfilled expectations and goals of men, universally and individually”; “No clue”; “Chapel credit”; and “After speaking with Chesna [the dramaturg], I am coming to believe that it is pointless to guess.”\n\nThere were other notes and adjustments to answers here and there, but this is a clear enough picture of a diverse audience response that a) tied the play to issues of the times, b) drew religious connections consistent with their probably beliefs, and c) represents the continuously broad associations made with Godot. Oh, and there’s always someone with chapel credit on their mind. Now, excuse me while I dig up the data from UMD’s 2019 production of The Visit.\n\nOn May 14th, I will make my final appearance as dramaturg for the Teens Behind the Scenes program at The National Theatre during a post-show talkback following a performance of Hairspray. As usual, my task has been to craft a study guide that puts the latest show to cross The National’s stage in context for local high school students and then lead a discussion that draws those students’ attention to significant features of that show. Since day one, I have done my best to balance genuine enthusiasm for the productions with the critical perspective required of me as a scholar. It’s a delicate balance, but searching for it has been a great way to refine my craft. With my last turn around the corner, and with blog ideas a bit lacking lately, I decided to look back on some of the material I prepped for my last round of study guides. Visit The National Theatre’s website to access these guides and more (expect Hairspray‘s out soon) and check out the bibliography at the end of the post for a list of really great sources.\n\nThe Revolution Before Rent\n\nAs is often the case, the touring production of Rent came with its own study guide, and an especially robust one at that. Instead of retreading their material, I decided to put Rent in context with the larger shift in queer and HIV-positive representation in theatre, examine its complex legacy, and write about Lin-Manuel Miranda’s adaptation of Tick, Tick…Boom!, because why not? There were two major challenges in that, the first of which was summarizing the vast, complex history of AIDS-related theatre and activism that played out onstage and in the streets prior to Rent‘s arrival. In my article, I decided to take a relatively expansive approach that accounted for everything from the early AIDS research benefits to the radical protests of ACT UP; from landmark plays like The Normal Heart and Angels in America to incisive comedies like AIDS! The Musical; and from (controversial) leading figures like Larry Kramer to less-heralded performers like the members of Black performance troupe Pomo Afro Homos. The objective was to familiarize students with the type of art and activism that had to be made first before a mainstream story like Rent could arrive on the scene.\n\nThe second challenge was to wrestle with Rent‘s complex legacy while maintaining a place for its enduring popularity. That meant including the “Rent-heads” who lined up around the block to get tickets and author/activist Sarah Schulman, who accused Jonathan Larson of plagiarizing her work and co-opting queer culture. What I attempted to do here was recognize that things have certainly changed since Rent, and among those changes is an increasingly strong (and fair) expectation that stories largely about historically marginalized people should center those people. That is a theme I have returned to again and again in my writing. Still, as others have observed, Rent‘s sustained resonance is largely down to its message of hope in the face of death, a hope that, while sometimes naive, does have its own place. Plus, some of the numbers really do wail, even after all these years.\n\n“A 9/12 Story”: Come From Away\n\nThe show I was least familiar with coming into this season has arguably become my favorite. David Hein and Irene Sankoff’s musical about the townspeople of Gander, Newfoundland who rose to the occasion when thousands of unexpected visitors arrived at their airport on 9/11 is an international hit, and with good reason. It’s moving and funny, it’s heartwarming without being too saccharine, it has a great score, and it demonstrates how a stripped-down, actor-centric aesthetic can thrill you even more the glossiest production. It is also indicative of what the creators call a “9/12 story”: a story that focuses on life after 9/11, rather than the events themselves. What I tried to do in this guide is provide some context for how theatre, performance, and media have responded to the “post-9/11 world” that seems, at times, to have split the country in half. That includes everything from Ayad Akhtar’s brilliant, Pultizer Prize-winning play Disgraced to the virtually mandatory rendition of “God Bless America” that greeted the seventh inning stretch at Yankee games for years. It also meant recognizing that what makes the real-life story of Come From Away memorable is how unique it is. A lot of terrible things happened in the wake of 9/11, but the story of Gander’s response to the crisis is proof that people can come together in extraordinary ways in times of need. The challenge is to take inspiration from such stories and make them the norm, not the exception.\n\nIn addition to glossing post-9/11 theatre and performance, I also dove into the solo “Between Me and the Sky,” sung by a character based on real-life American Airlines captain Beverly Bass. Bass was a genuine trailblazer well before she landed on the Gander tarmac. In addition to being American Airlines first woman captain, she also flew the first flight staffed entirely by women in the airline’s history. She went on to be a much-admired flight instructor and an advocate for women pilots everywhere—and she did it all after pushing through the massive boys’ club that dominated the air for decades.\n\nNegotiating Difference in Hairspray\n\nConfession: I know the score to the 2007 film adaption of Hairspray starring a latex-clad John Travolta much better than I do the Broadway score, and there are numbers in there, namely “New Girl in Town” and “Ladies’ Choice,” that are really indelible to me. That’s partly why one of the most enjoyable parts of prepping this study guide was charting the many iterations of Hairspray, beginning with the 1988 film and continuing all the way to Hairspray Live!, which aired on NBC in 2016: there really is a bit of Hairspray for everyone. It was also a great primer on the practical and interpretive challenges of taking a film from screen to stage and then back again. Even the 2016 rendition, presented with a mix of Broadway and post-Broadway film numbers and with Harvey Fierstein’s Edna thrown in to boot, had to retool itself for a unique medium. That some sense of John Waters’ Baltimore, the hometown that so obviously shaped his worldview, survived in each case is something special.\n\nHaving said all that, listening to Hairspray for the first time in several really primed me to address how the show navigates the politics of difference. That it is very much a White liberal fantasy of inclusion and integration is evident even in a peppy, infectious score that borrows from a range of styles and is sometimes a bit fetishistic of the Black characters. It’s also worth noting, as many scholars have, that the show does blunt a lot of the edges in Waters’ original film. As Waters himself once said, he preferred “scary” drag queens like Divine, the original Edna Turnblad, rather than family-friendly ones, like you see in the show, because they challenged norms much more openly. Furthermore, drawing attention once again to the fact that Tracy is at the center of the play reminds us that the story is very much hers: she is the one who leads the charge to integration and she is the one who scores the conventionally attractive boy at the end. Granted, a lot has changed since the film debuted in 1988 and the musical debuted in 2002; negotiations with difference are far more open, nuanced, and prominent than they were before, even if the results can sometimes be frustratingly similar. As is often pointed out, musicals can be great sources for utopian ideals because they already create a world that could be, rather than a world that is.\n\nBibliography\n\nA lot of great sources, ranging from scholarly monographs to internet thinkpieces, shaped my writing this year.

Theatre in Quarantine (TiQ) has been earning plenty of press during this pandemic for a series of innovative performances that started beaming to the world from a closet—specifically Joshua William Gelb’s closet in New York. Gelb and collaborator Katie Rose McLaughlin compose the pieces using a combination of video editing, motion capture, and good old-fashioned theatricality. The results are streamed live: Gelb performs in real time, while the video effects (everything from changing the orientation of the all-white closet space to masking it with previously shot footage) are all synchronized accordingly. Each piece is a feat of alchemy that, as the creators will attest, can sometimes fail but often succeeds.\n\nUp until this point, audiences could only watch TiQ from the comfort of their own homes. Last week, however, I and a few other lucky souls got to be the first to watch them performance in person. Not that they traded YouTube for a proscenium: instead, a few of us crowded into the department’s light lab and sat in seats behind a series of monitors and cameras turned onto a specially built “closet.” As we watched, Gelb set the stream going, stepped past the monitors, cameras, and lights, and began to perform. In front of us was Gelb working in the closet as if exploring it for the first time: pressing one side and the next, hopping up and down, lifting and stretching to see how far he could climb, huffing and sweating throughout. On the screen, the closet tipped from side to side, fell over, and even shot from one end to the other—all in sync with Gelb. In the middle was a monitor running Isadora, software that, with the help of an Xbox Kinect, maps a series of pre-programmed prompts onto Gelb’s body, cueing the video effects one by one. The results were truly awesome: on the one hand, a vibrant show of an actor’s unvarnished skill; on the other, the “finished” product mediated by a feat of performance-friendly computer engineering. As I said to my colleagues afterwards, it was like having someone show us how they do a magic trick. (Keep an eye out for the video, complete with talkback, archived on HowlRound.)\n\nThroughout the show, I became fascinated with the interplay between Gelb’s physical body and cinematic body. I recalled something I had heard about great puppet performers: that their expressions are grafted onto the faces of their puppets in the eyes of the audience. There was something similar here in that the effort Gelb applied to his performance—the sweat, the sound, the kinetic energy—was grafted onto the video by association. In a way, the two become fused, to the point that when I saw the show again, this time only through video, I felt like I was missing something. As it happens, that interplay is something that very much interests Gelb and McLaughlin and could potentially shape their next ventures. What kind of dramaturgical possibilities come out of that simultaneity? What sort of stories can we tell when audiences are able to pick their perspective or, better yet, look into that middle space and hold the two in tension? Ironically, it’s a kind of doubling act that might only really be possible in person—which is not to say that the two halves alone can’t satisfy viewers in their own way. This is another way that theatre could, with the right labor arrangements, learn from sports: yes, millions watch on TV, but there are still thousands happy to pay for the privilege of being there.\n\nStill, there’s that space in the overlap between physical space and screen that could be something special. I think back a lot on the Zoom production of The Wolves “staged” by Philadelphia Theatre Company and how it significantly changed the way I experienced the play—in a way that, say, a filmed version of an in-person production would not have (hit me up for a PDF of my review in Theatre Journal). In my (albeit limited) experience with digital theatre, the really interesting work is that which shifts the spectator, whether by changing their relationship to a play or quite literally offering them different perspectives simultaneously. These are the kinds of experiences I will be looking out for as digital performance continues to evolve.\n\nA Bobbie of a Different Sort\n\nAfter Stephen Sondheim passed, I introduced my girlfriend to the original cast recording of Company, a personal favorite, on a long car ride. As I wrote in a previous post, the show hits differently when you’re in a committed relationship as opposed to when you are a perpetual third wheel, like the show’s main character. It also hits differently when a woman is cast in that role instead of a man, as in the ongoing Broadway production helmed by Marianne Elliot and starring Katrina Lenk as Bobbie. On the surface, it’s a perfectly straightforward change, barring some necessary adjustments to lines and lyrics. Instead of a Bobby who is beloved by all his couple friends and who perpetually strings along eligible women, you now have a Bobbie doing effectively the same thing with eligible men. Again, though, some things just hit differently. For example, Bobby’s married women friends take a very serious interest in getting him a mate, a quality that reads as tender and motherly in a sort of benign way. When Bobbie’s married male friends do the same thing—in this case, intruding on Bobbie’s imagination while she’s in the middle of getting oral sex—it feels a little perverse and a tad patriarchal.\n\nOf course, staging has an important role to play in that moment, and for all its many qualities, the staging of this Company often undid its best intentions. For starters, the very large (and largely excellent) cast was asked to make a few too many mass entrances and exits—not easy to do discretely, especially on a stage already dominated by boxy rooms representing various apartment spaces around the city. Lenk, meanwhile, who sang the role brilliantly but had a habit of joking in a deranged-sounding voice that maybe should have been directed out of her, was made to bumble from box to box and the occasional open space in between. This effect, along with other characters criss-crossing through her realities, seemed to cast Bobbie in something of a fever dream. In other words, her 35th birthday, a monument made very obvious by large balloons and the number “35” not so discreetly placed throughout the various set pieces, has left Bobbie literally disoriented. While I tend to love dreamlike sequences, the rules of this dream were ill-defined, leaving the protagonist and the production a little messy.\n\nThat Bobbie came off as a bit of a mess is unfortunate because it is, sadly, an obvious choice. Granted, not quite so obvious as the crying baby and ticking clock motif (symbolizing, you know, THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK), a motif that, coupled with Bobbie’s constant bewilderment and habit of drunkenly staring at her phone, suggest she has arrived at this point, unwed and childless, because she can’t get her shit together. This is different from Bobby the man, who typically comes off as a kind of aloof playboy/cipher who just can’t commit. To shape Bobbie the woman in this way is to cast her both within the familiar trope of the “hot mess” and make her a victim of forces seemingly beyond her control, and not in a way that clearly delineates a feminist commentary on the social pressures to couple up and reproduce. This Bobbie just can’t seem to help herself, bless her heart, and that, to me, distracts from the central tension between desire for companionship and fear of losing one’s sense of self that makes this show so special.\n\n(There was still a lot to love about this production. The singing was excellent, Matt Doyle nailed “(Not) Getting Married Today,” I enjoyed Christopher Fitzgerald’s shtick, Jennifer Simard filled in for Patti Lupone nicely, and Claybourne Elder made for an absolute tier-one himbo as Andy, the hot pilot.)\n\nLast month, I taught a three-week “crash course” in the Art of Communication and Presentation, our department’s general education course on public speaking. It was a class I’d had on my radar for a while and despite the compact period, I had a blast with it. It helped that part of my setup was getting the students to speak from their personal experience and studies, that way they were able to bring the content they wanted into the space and I could focus on helping them communicate it effectively. There were a number of standout presentations, but one hit particularly close to home: a brief informative talk on nostalgia and how it engages the “reward centers” in our brains. It was a perfectly timed because it spoke to something I had been stewing on for the whole month, namely the hat-trick of pop culture offerings trading on twenty-plus years of nostalgia: Spider-Man: No Way Home, The Matrix: Resurrections, and the Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts reunion. All three built on franchises that began in the late 1990s/early 2000s and all engaged, in some form or fashion, with what it actually means to be invested in said franchises. Warning: Spoilers abound.\n\nOption 1: Bring It All Together\n\nIt was clear early on that Marvel’s Spider-Man: No Way Home, the third in Tom Holland’s (more or less) standalone stint as the friendly neighborhood web-slinger, was going to loop in some familiar faces from the past. The return of Doctor Octopus, followed by a bevy of other villains from two sets of previous installments, pointed to a clear strategy: use the studio’s multiverse angle to bring all of the previous Sony pictures into the lineup. But the villains, a conveniently Sinister Six in number if not in name, preceded the real pay-off: the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as the Peter Parkers of their own universes. The result is a film that very much lives in the house Into the Spiderverse built: heavy on spectacle, witty in its repartee, and surprisingly good at balancing a vast host of characters (truly, this is the exception that proves the “too many villains spoil the sequel” rule).\n\nAnnoyingly, despite seeing this move from a mile away, the sight of the Spider-Men of yore stepping through the portal and into the “official” realm of Marvel still made me a little giddy. It’s not surprising, really: the Maguire films in particular were a standout of the early superhero era and an easy plug into a new geekdom that was rising in power while I was still in Zambia. It’s hard to believe now but those original films were, along with the X-Men franchise, proof of concept for the unprecedented project Marvel would take on later. The team behind No Way Home knew about that capital and played into it in a few ways. The cheekiest was a series of meme references, my favorite of which is this post’s featured image (I wish I could say I rolled my eyes when Norman Osborne, newly arrived in the MCU, popped this one off, but I didn’t). It was cute, yes, but also very mindful of the internet cache ol’ Web-Head has accumulated over the past twenty years. More poignantly, No Way Home gives each Spider-Man a chance to rectify failures in his own universe. In Maguire-Parker’s case, that’s counseling Holland-Parker against the corrosive powers of hate and vengeance; in Garfield-Parker’s case, it’s pulling off the saving catch that eluded him in his second outing and led to the death of Gwen Stacy. Ultimately, those pay-offs fit nicely into the film’s overall theme of accepting the consequences of one’s actions and accounting for one’s mistakes.\n\nIs the mix of convenient narrative callbacks, internet-friendly in-jokes, and retconning that puts to bed the long-running issues between Marvel and Sony partly cynical and maybe even part of a larger plan to open the door for future installments? You bet. Is it fan service par excellence? Absolutely. Is it done well? I certainly thought so. Of all the pieces I touch on here, Spider-Man: No Way Home knows exactly what it is doing and does it most effectively, partly because it supports all its throwbacks with narrative heft. Say what you will about Marvel and their sure-fire, high-dollar formula, but they know how to fine-tune their product.\n\nOption 2: Call It What It Is\n\nWhile the old superhero movies were great, nothing moved Teenage Jared quite like The Matrix. For all Adult Jared’s jadedness, I was ready to geek out all over again with The Matrix: Resurrections, and “all over again” is appropriate here because that is essentially what the new(ish) team in The Matrix has to do for Neo: re-rescue him from The Matrix and the gooey grasp of the bad machines. This is because Neo has, as we eventually learn, been resurrected (see?) and reinstalled into the Matrix itself. And how do they keep him trapped in his new reality? By making his alter-ego, Thomas Anderson, the celebrated creator of a video game called…The Matrix. Despite his previous successes, Neo – I mean, Thomas Anderson – is dissatisfied with his life. His therapy is going nowhere, his new game Binary is stalling, and he finds himself unable to work up the nerve to approach the lovely Tiffany (who we know as Trinity, also newly-entrapped in the Matrix). When a new set of unplugged freedom fighters breaks through to him, Thomas Anderson – I mean, Neo – has to figure out for himself what is real and what isn’t, even as everything he thought he knew about himself starts to unravel.\n\nBy recuperating Neo and bringing him back out of the Matrix, the franchise essentially allows itself to start at square one and replay some of the greatest hits both literally (through footage from the previous films) and intertextually (Neo and the new Morpheus have a rematch in the dojo that takes on a more explosive tenor). However, Lana Wachowski, flying without original co-creator Lilly Wachowski, uses that retread to make a more pointed commentary about, well, retreads. In this “new” Matrix, the very dense world-building, bendy reality, and innovative camera work that made the original film so iconic is also what seems to make Anderson’s videogame-within-the-film so iconic. One of the major subplots even sees executives at Anderson’s firm comically picking over the best way to reboot the franchise with new and progressively more ridiculous ideas. When the “real” Matrix starts to break down, even some of the emerging anomalies, such as Reloaded‘s The Merovingian, are aware of their role in a larger story and none too happy about. In short, Wachowski puts all the challenges of living up to the past and the reckless need to “innovate” in the service of making the old new front and center, all while hitting familiar emotional and thematic marks.\n\nThe Matrix: Resurrections doesn’t work as seamlessly as Spider-Man: No Way Home. The commentary is heavy-handed at times, the binary-busting rules that humanize rather than vilify the machines are confusing (though they do reinforce the franchise’s cache as a trans allegory), the whole enterprise is constantly teetering on the verge of collapse due to the weight of its own meta-ness, and even the action sequences seem a bit rote. Nevertheless, it takes guts to question the very foundations of the franchise that made you. Then again, in a marketplace so saturated with “the currency of intertextuality” and multi-media franchise building, maybe it’s a safer move than it might seem.\n\nOption 3: Make Nostalgia the Point\n\nAt first glance, the Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts special on HBO Max is sort of an outlier in this post. Nevertheless, because the first film it celebrates debuted two years after The Matrix and one year before the Maguire-led Spider-Man, and because the special itself was released at around the same time as these other nostalgia-wielders, it merits consideration. That’s not because it introduces anything surprising, because it doesn’t, at least not to hardcore Potterheads. Instead, it stages a kind of emotional homecoming for most of the cast members and several of the directors who basically lived the franchise for a significant period of their lives. Origin stories, such as how the main three cast members were found; charming but embarrassing reveals, such as the “love letter” a young Daniel Radcliffe wrote to Helen Bonham Carter; remembrances of cast members past, such as Richard Harris and Alan Rickman—all intermingle with a grateful, intense, sometimes wide-eyed reckoning with the magnitude of their work and the enduring legacy of the franchise built by these artists. The production team even goes to great pains to recreate some of the old sets, or at least something like them, making it all seem like a suitably magical high-school reunion.\n\nIn my view, that high-school reunion feel the special creates is precisely the point of the exercise and precisely the mode of nostalgia the special wants to invoke. By watching the “real” Harry, Ron, Hermione, Sirius, Weasley twins, and even Voldemort reminisce about their Potter memories, the audience is invited to share in the same nostalgia by proxy. It’s like the old adage that podcasts are like sitting on a conversation with people you only wish you were friends: there’s a sense of closeness there, a shared interest and collection of experiences, yet it’s all unfolded for you by more beautiful and articulate professionals. The message seems to be “yes, this is special to us, too!” This is pointed for a couple of reasons. First, because it very consciously celebrates the enduring legacy (and profitability) of the franchise by gesturing to the very same kinds of family ties that many consumers have made through reading the books and watching the films. Second, and this is my own take here, it suggests at some level that it is still okay to like Harry Potter and to treasure the memories. This allows the franchise to pivot beyond the problematic reputation of creator J.K. Rowling, a notable absentee from the special, save for some archival footage. According to Rowling’s reps, the author declined to participate because her previous comments suffice. That may be true, but what is also true is the degree to which large pockets of fans have questioned their attachments to the franchise due to Rowling’s outspoken views on trans women. In short, Rowling has become the kind of troublesome figure who prompts tired “separating the art from the artist” debates and suggests to some fans that they need to apologize for their fandom. What the special does is shift away from the author and toward the communal exercise of bonding over the film. After all, if these professionals can do it, then so can you.\n\nUltimately, all three features brought up complicated feelings. There was genuine pleasure in revisiting the memories I have with these properties. There was criticism of certain story arc, characterizations, and framing devices. There was cynicism about the way nostalgia was being manipulated to suit my desires and shame for the way it worked so all. Most of all, there was a vision of how twenty years’ worth of pop culture memories can be reframed, successfully or unsuccessfully, for a new time while maintaining or even repairing the sanctity of the original. That it happened at such large scales and in such similar timeframes points to both the stakes of these kinds of endeavors and to a sense that, maybe, some sort of corner is being turned. Maybe mash-ups are the next thing—consider, for example, that Marvel’s multiverse is only just getting started. Maybe self-critical re-treads will be the norm—the internet has plenty of fuel for that. Maybe there will be a greater need to protect the legacy of a property by putting a human face to those who made our memories for us—after all, Harry Potter‘s is not the first reunion HBO Max has staged. Whatever the case, there’s a chance I’ll turn up for it, even despite myself and even if it is just for the biochemical rewards.\n\nFirst, a clarification: This is not a list of books published in 2021. It is just a list of 10 standout books that I completed during a personal banner year for pleasure reading. Belatedly taking up reading for fun again was already one of the best things I could have done for myself when the pandemic first began. I had been a voracious reader as a child but fell off the wagon when theatre and graduate school swept in to take up my time and mire me in books that could be enriching but were rarely enjoyable. With newfound time on my hands in 2020, I delved back into texts that offered me nothing but adventure and a chance to satisfy my curiosities. Last year, I kicked it up a notch, taking in 25 books (a drop in the bucket for true bookworms, I know) with nary a benefit to my dissertation, all drawn from a diverse array of authors and genres. There were sci-fi standouts of past and present (Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Cixin Liu’s The Three-Body Problem), entries from American legends (Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye and Joan Didion’s Play It As It Lays), fantasy series installments (two from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher series), and others that are harder to pair up (where to put Carrie Fisher’s Postcards from the Edge and Wayetu Moore’s The Dragon, the Giants, the Women?). Virtually all of them had their merits, though some, like Michael Chabon’s Summerland, became more of a chore as they went on, and others, like Karen Armstrong’s A History of God, might be best used as reference books. All that said, the list below collects the ones that stuck with me the best for one reason or another. Here they are in the order in which I read them.\n\nAmericanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. While Adichie has become a figure of controversy recently, this sprawling novel remains a compelling examination of contemporary African (namely Nigerian) lives at home and abroad. Apart from being totally absorbed in Ifemelu and Obinze’s travails in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively, I found myself gaining (tentative) new understanding of subjects that still remain beyond my ken. The fact that much of the novel is recalled from the chair of an African beauty shop in New Jersey, for example, brings home just how much Ifemelu’s personal journey is, like many women in the African diaspora, bound up in her hair. It’s those kinds of narrative moves that bring in even readers far removed from that lived experience.\n\nMachinehood by S.B. Divya. I have been recommending Divya’s speculative fiction (which I wrote about last year) to most anyone who will listen. Few books can weave together insights on artificial intelligence, a changing global landscape, religious extremism, and the rapidly evolving ways in which we work to such good effect. That it does so much with a diverse cast of characters and a solid dose of action makes it ripe for an HBO adaptation. I look forward to (or maybe dread) seeing how much of Divya’s future comes to pass.\n\nEducated by Tara Westover. Of all the books I read this year, no other had me gasping, shaking my head, or blabbing to my girlfriend more. Westover’s book—which has been criticized and refuted by members of her family—is a page-turner of a memoir that paints a stark picture of life lived on the margins of society. That Westover was able to push through willful ignorance, pseudo-religious zealotry, mental illness, and familial abuse just to get a basic education is remarkable enough, never mind the fact she became a scholar in her own right.\n\nThe Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett. If my life depended on picking the best book I read this year, it would be hard to beat this one. Bennett’s multi-generational tale of two light-skinned Black sisters, one of whom crosses the color barrier to live as a White woman, is exquisitely written and so finely balanced. There is just enough ache in Desiree and Stella’s separation to hold the narrative strands together, just intrigue in Early’s work and Jude’s espionage to titillate the reader, just enough insight into the practical challenges of Reese’s life as a man, just enough time in between sections to show how much and how little has changed, just enough attention to Kennedy’s acting career to suggest it’s all appearances, just enough breadth in Bennett’s sentences to show her lyricism without make it seem like she’s showing off. The fact this book is being adapted for HBO with Issa Rae as an executive producer also turned me on (finally) to Insecure, so it was doubly good to me last year.\n\nInterior Chinatown by Charles Yu. This book has a lot going on formally speaking. It shifts from narrative to script, it delves in and out of Hollywood tropes, and it’s written almost entirely in the second person. That last point, which I wrote more about last year, is important here because it addresses the reader in a way that either suits their experience or doesn’t. It’s a bold tactic to take in a book that is aiming very specifically at problematic racialized representation, and I think it works—not that you should take my word for it.\n\nParable of the Talents by Octavia Butler. It would be easy to cheat and put Butler’s Parable of the Sower here alongside its sequel, but the truth is I found the latter book more compelling. Maybe it’s because Sower (which I wrote about alongside Divya’s Machinehood) hit me hard, and I knew what to expect of Talents. However, a lot of it definitely down to a device I tend to enjoy: multiple, conflicting perspectives. In Talents, Lauren Olamina’s quest to grow Earthseed is contrasted with the Christian devotion of her half-brother Marc and the wounded skepticism of her daughter Asha. Not only does that complicate the reader’s view of Lauren, it also illustrates the challenges any truly revolutionary movement faces.\n\nThe Beatles by Bob Spitz. Spitz’s massive biography is another one I have already written on—and, as I later learned, something of a controversial entry and doesn’t even crack Rolling Stone‘s list of best Beatles books. For all the (mostly minor) factual errors and disregard for John Lennon, I credit Spitz’s work for re-invigorating my love of The Beatles and introducing me to the often understudied early years when they were often less than Fab, not to mention the ruthlessness of the record industry and the genuine dangers of Beatlemania. That they emerged with any kind of sanity, never mind careers, is a testament to their unique powers. Next up: Getting back to Get Back on Disney+.\n\nA Burning by Megha Majumdar. Like I said earlier, I love a book with multiple perspectives, and A Burning weaves together three to great effect in a story about ambition, injustice, and the dual edge of social media in modern India. Each of the three protagonists is compelling in their own way: Jivan for her self-belief in the face of a wrongful conviction of terrorism; Lovely, a hijra (member of a third gender recognized in Hinduism), for her longing for acceptance; and PT Sir for the way he sells his soul piece by piece in his ascent from schoolteacher to minister. The shifts in narrative and verb tense are disorienting at times, but that often enhances the heady rush of a story about three lives that seem to change in an instant.\n\nEvicted by Matthew Desmond. My girlfriend recommended this book to me highly but warned me not to read it around the holidays; I could see why after the first chapter. Desmond’s ethnographic account of renters’ lives in Milwaukee, one of the most segregated cities in the country, is full of heartache, frustration, and disappointment. It is also an incisive indictment of housing and social support systems that empower landlords to take advantage of their tenants and trap people in cycles of destitution and punishment. Each of the people Desmond tracks is richly and sympathetically drawn, and the circumstances that inhibit them are explained with refreshing clarity. We should all be so lucky to contribute research like this.\n\nPiranesi by Susanna Clarke. My last book of the year, which unfolds through a series of journal entries written by a man seemingly trapped in a massive labyrinth, crept into this top ten on the strength of its premise and its theatrical potential. As in Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell, Clarke weaves the magical and the mundane together nicely (with another helping of academic suspicion to boot), and the way the mystery, not to mention Piranesi’s sense of self, unravels is masterfully done. I think it would make a compelling theatrical adaptation, especially what with all the advances in digital technology. Put it down as a future project.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrapped my second round of Texts and Contexts in Western Theatre, a class that is, in many ways, my sweet spot. Historically, the course has asked a little too much: it’s part script analysis, part dramatic literature, and part dramaturgy, all three of which could easily take up a full semester on their own. There’s also the challenge of teaching some version of the canon while at the same time revising that canon for greater diversity. In short, it’s got a lot of the stuff that interests me, quirks included. I was excited to take another stab at it after learning so much during my first go-around. Back then, I spent a lot of time curating the reading list and adapting previous syllabi (big ups to Jonelle Walker, Jenna Gerdsen, and Allison Hedges) for an online environment. This time, I experimented with structures of grading and community expectations, partly by embracing flexibility and student involvement. The results were largely successful and, as always, very revealing. Here are a handful of (non-prescriptive, totally anecdotal) takeaways.\n\nThe Students Responded Well to Flexibility. Last summer, I briefly looked into contract grading, a system that rewards grades primarily according to the amount of work done rather than (potentially arbitrary) rubrics that judge the quality of the work. The systems I looked at never quite suited my needs, but I did adopt a few grading policies that gave students some flexibility and tailored my rubrics to place greater value on meeting each aspect of a prompt. Most assignments had a 24-hour grace period after the due date and a decaying grade that went down by 10% for each 24-hour period afterward until the assignment hit 50%. After that point, students could still turn in the work at any point during the semester. The idea was that they would always get some credit for doing the work, and anyone who was burdened with other life requirements would benefit from some built-in generosity. Amazingly, I can count on one hand the times students turned in work after the 24-hour grace period. Perhaps that’s not a surprise considering I had a small class and considering the student only had to turn in 10 out of 12 writing prompts, with the remaining two prompts counting as extra credit. It’s worth noting, though, that half the students did turn in prompts for extra credit. Again, a small sample size, but I take some encouragement from the fact that 1) students took advantage of the class’s flexibility but rarely to the extent that it harmed their grade and 2) students routinely did more than they were required to do.\n\nStudents Filled in the Gaps When Asked. In addition to investigating contract grading, I had previously heard of instructors (colleagues Lindsey Barr and Jordan Ealey among them) taking time out of class to establish community norms with their students. I liked the idea and decided to set aside two portions of the syllabus to be completed as a group: the Participation expectations and the Discussion guidelines. Together, we spent the first class discussing “good” and “bad” examples of each and filling out the syllabus accordingly. I put “good” and “bad” in quotes on the board because oftentimes conventional participation—regularly speaking, engaging with the full body—is mediated by a variety of factors, including ability and culture. To that end, I decided to grade students individually and offer them a chance to appeal if they thought my participation grades were unfair. To their credit, anyone who got less than full points accepted their grade and, in every case, showed demonstrable improvement afterwards. There are a few caveats for these findings, among them the fact that it is, again, a small class that allows for individual meetings and that the guidelines, while agreed upon by the students, are too general to really quantify in points. Nevertheless, I found the students’ responses to these processes very encouraging and I think it set the groundwork for a collaborative class. Speaking of filling the gaps: students were also quick to point out problems in my quizzes, of which there were several. Seeing as how part of the point of the class is to train careful readers, I counted them catching me as a win…\n\nAssessing Play Selections Gave Me More Things to Think About. In addition to completing some of the community requirements of the syllabus together, I distributed a survey at the top of the course that included four options for each play “slot.” Students were asked to identify which plays they had already read and then participate in a follow-up discussion. The idea was that I would use the results to assess the final play selections and ensure we weren’t retreading overly familiar territory. In truth, I already had a rough outline of what I wanted to teach, but the survey and follow-up talk justified that list. I also got good results in an end-of-semester reflection that asked students to write about a play they found engaging, a play that had trouble with, and their overall assessment of the selection. The results revealed a handful of plays that were consistently popular, one that was consistently confusion or even disliked (sorry, The Rover), and an appreciation for the breadth and diversity of the reading list. Students also had great insight on how to improve comprehension, including by releasing play texts earlier (easy fix) and either spending more time on complex texts or picking texts with difficult language but not so difficult stories (a slightly harder fix if you want to teach Early Modern plays).\n\nNote to Self 1: Scaffolding Doesn’t Work as Well When the Heavy Stuff is Backloaded. One of the main objectives of having almost weekly writing assignments was to get students plenty of practice in responding to and analyzing plays. While their writing improved over time, the students seemed confused about some of the expectations around their summative assessments and overwhelmed by the stack of work they had to complete at the end of the semester. I addressed some of this by creating a bonus mini-lecture about writing reviews, but the larger problem seemed to be that all the big assignments were backloaded to around finals when stress is high and there’s little time to process finer-grain feedback. Thankfully, one of my students alerted me to this problem during our final project consultation, and the rest provided thoughtful feedback on how to resolve it. In the end, I pared down the final project and adjusted some due dates to free up more time. The students roundly appreciated the effort and I appreciated the opportunity to address a flaw in my design.\n\nNote to Self 2: Don’t Have an In-Person Class That Could Have Been a Zoom Meeting. This was my first semester back on campus since March of 2020, and I returned determined to (safely) enjoy it. Having been converted to the “flipped” classroom format while working with Caitlin Marshall on the grant-funded redesign of our introductory course, I had every intention of maximizing class time through discussion, group work, and embodied activities. While I would like to think most of the classes employed those tools to good effect, there were a handful that could’ve just as easily been Zoom calls because they were largely stationary discussions. I say this not to minimize discussion, or Zoom classes, or the differences between talking on the computer and talking in person, or all the spontaneous interactions you get in and around the classroom that you don’t get online, but rather to point out that co-presence alone is often an insufficient use of shared time in the classroom, particularly in theatre education. The past two years have energized digital performance and given new edge to debates about theatre’s “requirement” for being there; I won’t resolve any of those debates, but I will say that being there may be different than being online, but if it is supposed to be something truly special, then it needs to be maximized, not taken for granted.\n\nWhat West Side Story Gets that Tootsie: The Musical Didn’t\n\nLast week, I returned to The National Theatre in Washington, D.C., where I spent the better part of a year combing through the archives preparing a series of historical websites. This time, though, I went as an audience member for Tootsie: The Musical and brought my girlfriend along. Honestly, we would not have gone if the tickets weren’t on the house: I was familiar with accusations of transphobia aimed at the show, and despite my admiration for the film (which is very much of its time and even more worthy of those criticisms), I tend to be wary of movie-to-musical adaptations. Nevertheless, I thought it would be worth enjoying a night at the theatre and thinking through the politics of updating older material to contemporary sensibilities, a subject I wrote on recently with regard to Aaron Sorkin’s To Kill a Mockingbird. The show itself was largely what I expected: cheerfully tongue-in-cheek at moments, kitschy in others, very New York, and never quite able to rid itself of heteronormative anxieties around sex and gender, despite its obvious efforts. If anything, the fact that the show apologizes for itself so profusely, including in a heavy-handed monologue from the best friend character, only made it more grating, especially considering the narrative thrust of the show—angry male actor finds success impersonating a woman and somehow gains a conscience, too—is largely unchanged. It’s maybe a bit hypocritical to say, but sometimes art is better off owning its problematic qualities than offering a limp self-justification.\n\nOne musical that did stick the landing (critically, if not commercially) on its updates was the new West Side Story film, arriving 60 years after the first thanks to the efforts of Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner. West Side Story has always been the subject of controversy: the original Broadway production struggled to get funding because its subject matter and protests against the paper-thin characterizations of the Puerto Rican characters have been levied at it since day one (check the bibliography in the link for sources on the subject). Spielberg and Kushner’s new West Side Story addresses some of that by fleshing out the characters and adjusting some of the numbers; “America,” for example, starts as a playful back and forth between the men and women before evolving into an ecstatic communal number that takes up the streets. Much of the characters’ dialogue is also in Spanish, which is presented without subtitles and, very often, without English translations clumsily shoehorned into other characters’ speech. I don’t know that Latin audiences will every truly feel like they have stakes in West Side Story, but that second choice alone ensures many of them will be spoken to, quite literally, in ways this film’s predecessors did not. Interestingly, while the film does important work in updating the Puerto Rican characters, it also presents the White characters, mainly the Jets, in a more incisive light. Riff and the gang are immediately and deliberately positioned as the aggressors in a rapidly diversifying New York, a place undergoing radical gentrification. The shame they feel about being left behind, a shame that is so often compounded by xenophobia and siphoned into racist violence, is made explicit by Lieutenant Schrank in his very first appearance. These shades of historicization speak to Kushner’s grasp of the social dynamics at play during this period, a grasp that, with all due respect, exceeded that of original librettist Arthur Laurents.\n\nNaturally, the film is still West Side Story. It’s still brash and balletic, it still has some awkward dramaturgical and tonal shifts, and it still runs on the engine of teenage infatuation that will always oversimplify its racial politics. But a lot of what has always been thrilling about the musical remains, and a lot of the changes, from the addition of the Rita Moreno’s Valentina to shifting “Cool” to before the rumble, really work. The vast majority of the performances, with the exception of Ansel Elgort’s voice, work too, and you can expect the cast to be full of Oscar contenders. It may not convince any doubters and it may not fully answer the eternal “why now?” question, but if it has to exist, it exists in arguably the best form it can. It also gets a lot of credit from me for aiming at a more accurate and honest portrayal of the past rather than apologizing for the problematic politics at its center. Sometimes that’s the best you can ask of a “modern” update—that and some truly thrilling dance numbers, filmed with old-school flair an American master in Spielberg, a longtime fan of the original who looks like he’s had a musical in his pocket his whole career.\n\nMy Favorite Sondheim\n\nLike most red-blooded theatre folk, I was moved by the recent death of Stephen Sondheim, the Dean of the American Musical Theatre. I say “moved” because as sad as death is, the passing of a true great often prompts as much celebration and reflection as it does mourning, especially for those of us who only really know greats like Sondheim by his work. It is worth noting that those who did know Sondheim personally were full of praise not only for his artistry but for his mentorship and encouragement. To depart this world after life like that—long, successful, full of friends and students—is something most of us can only dream of.\n\nThere is a lot to celebrate about Sondheim, both in terms of individual works and overall contributions to the form, and far more educated people than me have written far more eloquent tributes than I can. What I will say is that I, like so many, have a favorite. Well, maybe two: I used to show the filmed production of Into the Woods to classes all the time and it will probably be the one I hum the most in my old age. But the one that still resonates with me most is Company. For years that was because I, like Robert, was a perpetual third wheel who never seemed suited for relationships. The fact that my middle name is Robert seemed to make it all the more apt. Now, a year and a half into a serious, loving relationship, it all hits a little differently. I’m still thrilled by the many variations of “Bobby” layered into the opening, the crescendo in “Side by Side by Side,” the technical demands of “Getting Married Today,” the head-bopping fun of “You Could Drive a Person Crazy,” and so on. Now, though, I find myself responding to the ambivalence of “Sorry-Grateful” and the terrified yearning of “Being Alive,” songs I always respected but never quite loved. “Being Alive” is especially remarkable because it captures so much in such simple lyrics. All Robert asks for, over and over again, is someone to want too much of him: to hold him too close, hurt him too deep, need him too much, know him too well, someone who has to be let in, have their feelings spared, who expects him to care, and so on. On the surface, it seems like accepting a dreadful loss of self by entering into a partnership, but the yearning in the music is so poignant that you can feel it overpowering Robert’s fear. That tension is something present-day Jared understands much better than the Jareds of yore.\n\nI like to think the great works reward repeat encounters and grow up along with us. That has certainly be true of Company for me, and I suspect it’s been true of at least one Sondheim musical for every Sondheim fan.\n\nFirst things first, know that you can count me among the people disappointed with season two of Ted Lasso. There’s an old adage that comedy is fast and there was very little fast about this season. That too many jokes were full of air would not be so troublesome if the show had maximized its best feature, namely a willingness to look past the earnestness so many of its characters strive for. The episodes that did go in an entirely different direction, like Coach Beard’s bizarro, post-FA Cup semi-final odyssey, stick out a lot in that landscape, and for all their incongruity, I found myself wanting more of that surreal, form-breaking fun. Ultimately, it seemed like the show, which still had many good moments, was suffering from some growing pains, unsure how to balance its rom-com send-ups with its darker strains of melancomedy. Finding that balance could have done a lot for the theme the show did explore very well: the other side of niceness.\n\nA lot has already been made about the Great Nate Debate, the discourse surrounding kitman-turned-assistant-coach Nate’s transformation from timid nice guy to self-absorbed prick. I won’t spend too much time on the debate here except to say that I found many of the moves heavy-handed (the hair, really?) and sometimes confusing, to the point that, despite all the ways Nate’s darker nature was exposed over the course of the season, his sudden outburst at Ted seemed to come out of the blue. I will say, though, that Nate’s arc is one example of how the show excavates what sometimes hides behind pleasant exteriors. The lesson of Nate’s story is that “niceness” does not always equate to goodness—that even those who seem harmless can harbor selfishness to the point of narcissism. This is not to discount the many ways Nate is belittled throughout the show, but rather to say that sometimes what the “nice guys” lack that the assholes don’t is the balls to do exactly what they want.\n\nIn addition to charting a seemingly new course for Nate, the show also lets some of the characters’ pleasant facades slip. We see, for example, that Ted’s relentless positivity is not impermeable; in fact, it is covering up a very serious problem with trauma that produces, among other things, an aversion to conflict. That he begins to untangle that with Dr. Sharon is appropriate, not just in that it shows her own “professional kindness” in the form of therapy is valuable, but in that Ted is able to help her, too. We discover, in Sharon’s private moments, that for all her grasp of human nature, she is lonely and therefore vulnerable to things going wrong. Here we have two people with an aptitude for making people feel good but who have not translated that same energy into personal fulfillment. Indeed, it suggests that sometimes niceness can be a barrier as much as a doorway. While some characters were enriched by arcs that revealed their fragility, other revelations were somewhat less surprising. My bullshit detector immediately started beeping when Edwin Akufo (all-star VEEP alum Sam Richardson), the billionaire Ghanaian heir apparently intent on dismantling his father’s empire, first arrived in his helicopter and started to woo sweet-natured Sam Obisanye with extravagant purchases and promises. (Never trust a billionaire who buys ambience and uses conspicuous consumption in service of an apparently decolonial project.) That he turned out to be vindictive and crude when denied what he wants puts him in a similar category to the slippery Rupert, another billionaire with charm to spare. Interestingly, Rupert, as we discover, is actually repelled by niceness; as Rebecca’s mother points out, putting on a smile proves that he cannot get under Rebecca’s skin. For him and Akufo, good manners are about mobilizing their power in the most effective and least obvious way; once they do not have the power, niceness no longer serves them.\n\n(Speaking of billionaires and power, it’s here that I should return to my first writing on Ted Lasso and its role in the Americanization of the Beautiful Game. If season two got one thing very right about elite soccer, it is that money calls the shots, to the point of making the game a ball pit for billionaire playboys. If we can accept that there are sometimes darker—or at the very least, cynical and commercial—interests lurking behind hyper-lucrative organizations like the Premier League, we might have to accept that Ted Lasso is being positioned for the same purpose. The fact that the Premier League is going to allow the show to use official materials and highlight packages suggests they know a good marketing opportunity when they see it.)\n\nWhile Ted Lasso revealed what lies beyond niceness, other texts, such as Bertolt Brecht’s play The Caucasian Chalk Circle (stay with me here), reveal the differences articulated between niceness and kindness. As my class and I studied Brecht’s text recently, I found myself thinking back on what professor and devised theatre expert Rich Brown once explained to me and others during a workshop session: that niceness is complimenting a friend’s terrible new haircut to keep up appearances and kindness is telling them the truth because you really care. In short, kindness prioritizes a person’s needs, even to the point of superseding manners and other mores of polite society. Kindness also comes with a certain cost, as Grusha, Brecht’s heroine, discovers when she rescues a noble child named Michael from the flames "
