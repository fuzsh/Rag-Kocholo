        "text": "Civility is an important theoretical category, both for political theory generally and in order to understand and discuss the many issues raised by the Covid-19 crisis, as well exemplified by Matteo Bonotti and Steven Zech's book Recovering Civility during CoViD-19. Bonotti and Zech's examples of issues during Covid-19 related to civility as politeness do, however, indicate more general problem relating to civility, which might amount to a paradox of civility. Furthermore, their discussion of justificatory civility indicates that there may be further aspects of relevance than the usual distinctions between public and non-public reasons from the public reason literature.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is not simply a public health crisis. Policies implemented to contain its spread have had profound social, political and economic consequences, raising deep and pressing questions of ethics and justice. In this collection of essays, experts from the fields of political philosophy and political theory explain what the crisis has revealed about our societies, and how we might move forward to build a better world. Organized around five central themes, the essays consider the impact of COVID-19 on social welfare and vulnerability, economic justice, democratic relations, speech and mis(information), and our ability to imagine and create a more just society in the future.\n\nThis contribution explores the meaning and scope of solidarity with the emergence of the coronavirus discourse as formulated by politicians in order to make sense of the virus. It offers a poststructuralist account drawing on discourse theory together with insights from Levinas and Derrida. This leads to a critical reflection on the prevailing view of solidarity as secondary and derivative to corona policies, because solidarity is often subjugated to hegemonic meanings of efficiency. Instead, the argument is made that solidarity refers to the unique responsibility to which the other as wholly other commands me. This appeal for responsibility, that is presented in the face of the other, is to be assumed in the distance between the rules and the singularity of the situation. Accordingly, solidarity is described as a paradox of dependence (calculability) and independence (beyond calculation), that appears in a moment of undecidability, for it can never be overcome.\n\nThis article challenges and clarifies everyday thought about the idea of civility in society and politics by subjecting it to theoretical analysis. It contributes to research on citizenship, toleration and social cohesion by developing a new synthesis of the presently fragmented literature in contemporary political theory on the concept of civility and its place in liberal democratic politics. It first considers the meaning of civility, identifying some difficulties of definition and elaborating a distinction between civility in conduct and civility in attitude. It then assesses the most prominent debates around civility's value by contrasting arguments that civility serves a vital function in the moderation of democratic conflict with arguments that it threatens the basic values upon which democracy is founded. The article finds that the debate about civility is misconceived and that the literature is diminished by its failure to engage directly with the problem of incivility. In so doing, it establishes the parameters for a new agenda of civility research.\n\nWhat is civility? What does it require of us? What does it do for us? What’s the point of being civil? In musing on how to best answer these questions, this paper draws on the valuable philosophical spadework and astute analyses of Cheshire Calhoun (2000). It offers a new defence of the need to put civility first and to give it high status in our moral considerations. The real reason many are sceptical of regarding civility as a moral virtue is that it puts limits on how we might pursue no-holes-barred, radical moral critique. The tension is obvious: civility bids us to abide by existing social conventions, whereas radical moral critique bids us to be prepared to violate them in strongly calling out and condemning morally objectionable practices. Being civil not only constrains the style in which make such critiques but also, at least on some occasions, being civil might bring us into conflict with what a socially critical moral point of view demands of us. This paper responds to these concerns that acknowledging civility as an important virtue is not incompatible with the sort of authentic moral critique needed to produce morally sound activity, structures and practices.\n\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has put substantial pressure on individuals to adapt and change their behaviours. As the hope of a vaccine remains at least a year away, everyone is urged to take action to slow the spread of the virus. Thus, “flattening the curve” has become vital in preventing medical systems from being overrun, and it relies on massive collective action by citizens to follow specific public health measures such as physical distancing, hand washing, and physical isolation for vulnerable individuals. Despite the recommendations, the public has often been confronted with the reality that some individuals are not respecting them, including elected officials (Aguilar, 2020)."
