        "text": "The Vertical Front-Office Insider Bobby Marks, a 20-year executive with the Nets, offers his thoughts on the offseason plans of NBA teams whose seasons have ended.\n\nTHE PLAN GOING FORWARD\n\nKevin Durant’s free agency\n\nSometimes what you already know trumps the unknown.\n\nFor Kevin Durant, what he has in Oklahoma City is a team that was one win from the NBA Finals. It’s a young roster that will return a starting lineup that includes fellow franchise player Russell Westbrook, along with key bench players. Unlike Golden State, San Antonio or Miami, the Thunder will not have to gut their team to sign Durant.\n\nThunder management needs to focus on the future in its pitch to Durant. With a heavy emphasis on the long-term plan, Oklahoma City has to take the same approach of Golden State or San Antonio when courting Durant.\n\nRemember, this is Durant’s first time going through free agency.\n\nWhen the dust settles, it’s likely Durant will be returning to the Thunder. The question: For how long?\n\nBecause Durant is a year shy of becoming a Tier 3 max player, Oklahoma City could be going through the same process a year from now.\n\nDurant could sign a one-year contract with a player option for a second year and become a free agent again in 2017. That would allow Durant to earn a starting max salary of $35 million.\n\nDurant would also join Westbrook as two of the top free agents in 2017.\n\nDurant’s contract options\n\nOne-year deal then extension\n\nWith OKC\n\n2016-17: $25.8 million\n\nWith OKC With another team\n\n2017-18: $35.7 million $35.7 million\n\n2018-19: $38.4 million $37.7 million\n\n2019-20: $41.1 million $38.9 million\n\n2020-21: $43.8 million $40.6 million\n\n2021-22: $46.5 million\n\nTotals: $205.7 million $152.7 million\n\nWaiting until summer 2017 does come with tremendous risk.\n\nWith a new Collective Bargaining Agreement likely in 2017, there is no guarantee the current rules will be in place a year from now. There is also the risk of injury.\n\nDurant did miss most of the 2014-15 season with a serious foot injury.\n\nThe financial sacrifice of signing a long-term contract in July would be substantial, but sometimes financial security outweighs the risk.\n\nImmediate long-term deal\n\nWith OKC With another team\n\n2016-17: $25.8 million $25.8 million\n\n2017-18: $27.8 million $27.0 million\n\n2018-19: $29.7 million $28.2 million\n\n2019-20: $31.7 million $29.4 million\n\n2020-21: $33.6 million\n\nTotals: $148.8 million $110.5 million\n\nPlan B\n\nUntil the ink on Durant’s contract is dry, Oklahoma City has to operate with a measure of uncertainty.\n\nWith a roster built on previous drafts and trades, Oklahoma City has never been big spenders in free agency. In fact, the Anthony Morrow contract is the biggest free-agent deal Thunder management has signed in recent years.\n\nThe Thunder need to have every possible option at their disposal, including scouring for free agents and exploring trade targets, while taking into account the status of its current roster.\n\nDion Waiters restricted free agency\n\nThe Thunder will need to take into account the full body of work for Dion Waiters and not just his contributions during the playoffs.\n\nWaiters, a restricted free agent, has been inconsistent in his four years in the league and has not shown the ability to be a starter. Waiters, 24, may have found the perfect role on Oklahoma City’s bench.\n\nEven with the cap rising to $92 million, Waiters could find the free-agent market challenging because of the Thunder’s ability to match any offer sheet and Waiters not being among the top 10 available shooting guards.\n\nSteven Adams and Andre Roberson extensions\n\nFree agency for Durant and Westbrook could play a role in what direction the Thunder take with extension talks for Andre Roberson and Steven Adams.\n\nBoth players are entering the final season of their contracts and are eligible for extensions until Oct. 31.\n\nAdams and Roberson, both starters, have steadily developed since being drafted in 2013.\n\nWith low cap holds next July (Adams, $7.5 million; Roberson, $5.4 million), Oklahoma City would be best off keeping its cap flexibility in 2017, especially considering that both players could see their salaries double next year.\n\nTEAM NEEDS\n\nIf Durant and Waiters return, Oklahoma City will only have two roster spots open.\n\nHowever, with Durant and Waiters in the fold, Oklahoma City will be pressed against the luxury tax, making its options limited in free agency.\n\nThe continued development of Cameron Payne and the health of Mitch McGary will be important for the Thunder to address their needs at backup point guard and center.\n\nSUMMER CAP BREAKDOWN\n\nCAP PICTURE\n\nPROJECTED CAP SPACE\n\nThe Thunder, currently with $65 million in guaranteed contracts, are over the cap based on the $37 million in cap holds for Durant and Waiters, and Morrow’s $3.4 million non-guaranteed contract.\n\nIf Durant and Waiters return, the Thunder could be one of the few clubs operating as a luxury-tax team.\n\nThe Thunder could create $22 million in cap space, but that comes with the loss of Durant and not bringing back Waiters.\n\nJUNE DRAFT PICKS\n\nFirst round: To Philadelphia\n\nSecond round: To Denver\n\nFUTURE PICKS\n\nFirst round\n\n2018: To Utah (protected Nos. 1-14)\n\n2019: To Utah (protected Nos. 1-14) if no first in 2018\n\n2020: To Utah (protected Nos. 1-14) if no first in 2019\n\nNote: The Utah pick will turn into two second-round picks in 2020 and 2021 if no first is conveyed by 2020.\n\nKey rights to: Dakari Johnson (second round, pick No. 48, 2015); Semaj Christon (second round, pick No. 55, 2015); Alex Abrines (second round, pick No. 32, 2013); Tomislav Zubcic (second round, pick No. 56, 2012).\n\nPREVIOUS SUMMER AGENDAS: Nets | Pelicans | Timberwolves | Lakers | Knicks | Wizards | Bucks | 76ers | Nuggets | Kings | Bulls | Magic | Suns | Jazz | Grizzlies | Pistons | Mavs | Celtics | Rockets | Clippers | Pacers | Hawks | Hornets | Trail Blazers | Spurs | Heat | Raptors"
