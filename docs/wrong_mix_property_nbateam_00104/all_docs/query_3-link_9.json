        "text": "Three days into March, the Oklahoma City Thunder was mired in its worst stretch of the season – six losses in the eight games following the All-Star break.\n\nOn March 5, the team signed Nazr Mohammed … and proceeded to win 11 of its next 14 games.\n\nCoincidence?\n\n“I'm the greatest leader that there is,” Mohammed joked Saturday. The 38-year-old has played just 10 minutes total this season.\n\n“They were gonna make strides in that direction no matter what. I can't take any credit for it.”\n\nThe 18-year NBA veteran hasn't played much since rejoining the Thunder, but since he showed up, Mohammed has influenced the team's improvement.\n\nSince his first stint with the Thunder in 2010-11, Mohammed has kept close relationships with Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. After Mohammed moved his family to Charlotte in December, he met up with the Thunder when it came to play the Hornets in January.\n\nEven before he signed with the team, he was still watching as many games as he could … including the slump out of the All-Star break. He saw the Thunder wasn't responding well to teams making runs: Losing a 22-point lead on the road to the Clippers. Golden State surging back from a nine-point deficit to beat the Thunder the next night.\n\n“I was definitely watching,” Mohammed said. “After the All-Star break there was some of that.\n\n“I think we came closer as a team in this stretch knowing if they make a run we have more in the tank for them.”\n\nThe first game Mohammed was on the Thunder bench, March 6 in"
