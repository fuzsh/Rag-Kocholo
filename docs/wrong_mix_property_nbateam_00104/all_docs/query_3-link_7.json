        "text": "Nazr Mohammed enjoyed an 18-year career in the NBA, including three seasons as a member of the Thunder.\n\nThe 2005 NBA champion last appeared appeared on the court during the 2015-16 season, spending last year away from the game.\n\nOn Monday, he announced that he joined the Thunder front office in a new role. Mohammed made the announcement on The Players’ Tribune.\n\nAs of November 20, I became a professional evaluation scout/identification and intelligence for the Oklahoma City Thunder. I know it’s a mouthful, but essentially I’m going to get a full education in all of the little details needed to make a front office tick.\n\nMohammed spoke of his personal journey and his fascination with the game of basketball, both on and off the court. While he did acknowledge that he would like to become a general manager one day, he seems equally interested in learning about the things that make basketball organizations successful, from both a business and on-court standpoint.\n\nI’ve been in a championship locker rooms at the collegiate (1996 and 1998 NCAA Champion at Kentucky) and the professional level (2005 NBA champion with the Spurs) so I know what it looks and feels like. I’m really proud of these accomplishments, and now I’m just looking forward to channeling those experiences into this new challenge.\n\nSo I realize now how much I have to learn, and I see my new position as a chance to be a student in the Business of Basketball 101.\n\nAs a player, Mohammed was renowned as being friendly and cerebral, so the new role seems to be right up his alley.\n\nThis will be the last thing I write for a while as I dive fully into this new career. When you see me at an arena from here on out, you’ll know what I’m up to. And I hope you’ll come say, ‘What’s up?’ Ask me about hoops. I’m always down to talk about the game I love.\n\nSimilarly to Kendrick Perkins, Mohammed is beloved by quite a few people around the franchise. If nothing else, it’s refreshing to see another opportunity being afforded to a former player."
