Today we remember the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nHeading into the 2006-07 season, the Spurs must have been pretty content with their line-up. With Tim Duncan, Bruce Bowen, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Brent Barry, Michael Finley and Robert Horry all returning, the Spurs went with experience bringing in Jacques Vaughn and sharp-shooting with the addition of Matt Bonner."
