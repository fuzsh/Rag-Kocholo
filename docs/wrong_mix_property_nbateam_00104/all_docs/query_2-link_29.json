        "text": "For the second time in 19 days, Thunder players poured into Crossings Community Church to honor one of their own.\n\nOn Monday, the team gathered to honor Thunder part-owner Aubrey McClendon, the former CEO of Chesapeake Energy who died March 2 in a single-vehicle crash in northeast Oklahoma City. Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, general manager Sam Presti and numerous members of the organization were on hand, just as they were Feb. 18 for the memorial of Thunder assistant coach Monty Williams' wife, Ingrid, who died following a Feb. 9 multi-car crash.\n\nThe turnout for McClendon was massive. The church went through its 3,000 service programs quickly. Even before the service began at 10 a.m., overflow seating had to be opened for hundreds more to pay their respects.\n\nDion Waiters said Monday he learned more about McClendon's impact on Oklahoma City and how much the 56-year-old was loved.\n\n“I never really knew how much he gave back,” said Waiters, who arrived in Oklahoma City in 2014. “The things I heard and the stories and the things he built around here, they say he really changed (the city). He definitely left his mark.”\n\nThunder coach Billy Donovan, another relative newcomer to Oklahoma City, praised those who spoke about McClendon, including former Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating and American Energy Partners Chief Legal Officer Tom Blaylock. The most touching of the tributes came from McClendon's children, Jack, Will, and Callie.\n\nAmong several family activities, Jack remembered fun times with his dad courtside at Chesapeake Energy Arena.\n\n\"Dad, I will miss going to Thunder games with you and yelling at the refs,\" Jack said. \"... even if they made the correct call.\"\n\nDonovan said: “No question I think everything that was said I got a chance to feel in several times meeting him. I thought it was an incredible testimony by his children and the rest of the people that spoke on his behalf.”\n\nMOHAMMED PLAYED BIG ROLE FOR OKC\n\nNazr Mohammed is back with the Thunder, and he's clearly been brought back to be a presence in the locker room, not in the paint.\n\nIt's been almost four years since his final Thunder game, and sometimes you can forget how much a player helped. Mohammed helped a bunch.\n\nIn 2010-11, Mohammed played 24 games with the Thunder and started seven. He averaged 17.9 minutes, 6.9 points and 4.8 rebounds a game. Those aren't insignificant numbers.\n\nIn fact, Mohammed started his first seven games with the Thunder, while Kendrick Perkins, who also came in a 2011 deadline trade, recovered from injury.\n\nMohammed played in every game of the Denver and Memphis series that postseason. Against the big Grizzlies, Mohammed played 20:06 in a Game 4 victory (seven points, four rebounds) and 22:10 in a Game 5 victory (10 points, six rebounds).\n\nIn Game 7, when coaches are dead serious, Mohammed played 15:15 and totaled six points and six rebounds.\n\nNow, Mohammed is back in OKC, and four teammates remain — Durant, Westbrook, Serge Ibaka and Nick Collison. And while his previous coach, Scott Brooks, is gone, Mohammed has ties with Donovan. Both played college basketball for Rick Pitino. Donovan at Providence, Mohammed at Kentucky, a couple of years after Donovan left Pitino's staff to become head coach at Marshall.\n\nMohammed said of Donovan: “We're like part of the same family. Even though we didn't really know know each other, we knew what each other was about. There's not going to be a better situation for me.”\n\nAUGUSTIN THRIVING IN DENVER\n\nWhen the Thunder sent D.J. Augustin to the Denver Nuggets at the trade deadline, this wasn't expected.\n\nIn nine games with Denver, Augustin is averaging 12.8 points and 54.3 percent from 3-point range in 23.2 minutes per game. On Sunday, Augustin led Denver to a 116-114 overtime win against Dallas, scoring eight of his 12 points in overtime, including two free throws with nine-tenths of a second left. Augustin twice made 3-pointers to tie the game in OT.\n\nAugustin's performance particularly stands out amidst the turnover issues that have plagued the Thunder at the point guard spot. Since Feb. 19, the Thunder is averaging 16.4 turnovers per game, fourth-most in the NBA.\n\nIn that span, Kevin Durant has struggled with turnovers as his minutes running the offense have increased and Cameron Payne has been pushed out of the rotation."
