        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Blake Griffin had 26 points and 16 rebounds, Eric Gordon capped an 18-point effort with a go-ahead 3-pointer with 43.2 seconds left, and the Clippers beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 98-92 on Saturday night.\n\nGriffin, who played his college ball at Oklahoma and was the first overall pick in the 2009 draft, averaged 24 points and 13 rebounds in his three games against the Thunder.\n\nKevin Durant scored 23 points for the Thunder, shooting 10 for 24 overall and 0 for 4 from 3-point range. The last time the Clippers hosted the Thunder, they beat them 107-92 on Nov. 3 for the only victory in their 1-13 start. Durant was 0 for 10 from behind the arc that night and 6 for 24 overall with a season-low 16 points.\n\nThe Clippers handed the Thunder their second straight loss after five consecutive victories. The lead changed hands 10 times in the fourth quarter before Gordon drained his clutch 27-footer over Thabo Sefolosha from an angle to the left of the basket following a timeout. Gordon scored a career-high 41 points against Oklahoma City on Jan. 23, 2009.\n\nRandy Foye helped secure the Clippers’ 30th win of the season with a steal against Russell Westbrook, which Foye turned into a pair of free throws after getting fouled on the ensuing fast break. Westbrook, who played at UCLA, had nine points and eight assists before fouling out.\n\nThe Thunder have lost their first two games this month, equaling their entire total for March, when they were 14-2.\n\nThe technical fouls were flying during the third quarter, as referees Joey Crawford, Sean Wright and Marat Kogut combined to call six of them during a heated and trash-talking 3:40 span in which the Clippers erased a 12-point deficit and tied it at 59 on Griffin’s layup with 3:45 left in the period.\n\nOklahoma City’s Kendrick Perkins received one just four seconds before Westbrook and Coach Scott Brooks each got one simultaneously, following an offensive foul that resulted in Westbrook’s fourth personal with 6:24 left in the third and led to a pair of free throws by Mo Williams.\n\nAbout 3 1/2 minutes later, Griffin and Nick Collison got into a verbal exchange near midcourt, resulting in a double-technical with 2:59 left in the quarter, and Nazr Mohammed was hit with the sixth technical after grabbing Griffin around the midsection as the pride of Oklahoma drove for a layup following a whistle.\n\nThe Thunder came out of the blocks with a 15-4 run and led 49-37 at intermission, as the Clippers matched a season low for an Oklahoma City opponent in the first half. Milwaukee had 37 points against the Thunder before in the first 24 minutes on Nov. 20, losing 82-81.\n\nClippers center Chris Kaman missed his second straight game because of a viral infection. Forward Ryan Gomes missed his first game of the season because of a sore knee. Gomes, one of three Clippers to play in each of the first 76 games along with Griffin and rookie Eric Bledsoe, is second on the team in minutes played behind Griffin."
