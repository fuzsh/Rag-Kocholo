        "text": "Kendrick Perkins was interested in OKC in the past and Nate Robinson obsessed with local fast food.\n\nBy: News On 6\n\nOriginally Published: Feb 26, 2011 6:49 PM CDT\n\nGrant Belcher\n\nOklahoma Sports Staff Writer\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY – One of the things Nate Robinson is most excited about is something that many Oklahomans probably take for granted.\n\nRobinson can’t wait to get his hands on a slush from a Sonic Drive-In.\n\n“I told (my teammates), I’m going to be at Sonic a lot,” Robinson said. “I might have to just invest in one sooner or later.”\n\nSo when asked if a potential sponsorship opportunity from Sonic could be in the works, Robinson seemed excited at the idea.\n\n“I like those little slushies,” he said. “I could get in the car and do that easy. I need to talk to somebody in the headquarters, man, and get some free Sonic.”\n\nThe Thunder’s three new players – Robinson, Kendrick Perkins and Nazr Mohammed – spoke to the Oklahoma City media for the first time after practice on Saturday.\n\nRobinson described his first practice in Oklahoma City the same way other players in the past have described their Thunder experiences: a college atmosphere. Which is not surprising considering that OKC boasts the youngest starting lineup and one of the youngest overall rosters in the league.\n\nRobinson came from the Celtics along with big man Kendrick Perkins in exchange for Jeff Green, Nenad Krstic and a draft pick.\n\nThough Perkins isn’t as bubbly or outgoing as Robinson, he still had some words that Oklahoma City fans will love to hear.\n\n“I do want to be here, and hopefully we can work something out,” he said. “Free Agency is coming up or whatever it might, so I just know Oklahoma City is my first option.”\n\nHe will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season, which had some fans uneasy even though GM Sam Presti said Perkins is part of the long-term plan.\n\nBut Perkins even said that in the past, he had talked to his agent about the possibility of signing with Oklahoma City once he became a free agent, noting that “God works in mysterious ways.”\n\n“I knew my contract was coming to an end, so I asked him, ‘Do you think they would be interested?’ because I knew I could come in and help.”\n\nWhile Perkins had spent his entire eight-year career with the Celtics before the trade, Nazr Mohammed, a 12-year vet, said he has experienced the trade process a time or two.\n\n“I’ve been around a little while so I’ve experienced things like this before,” he said. “It was pretty painless. It’s a great group of guys here. I had heard that before I even got here.”\n\nMohammed noted that his former team, the Charlotte Bobcats, could have easily traded him to another lottery team, but he was happy to land on a contender.\n\n“Everyone knows this is one of the most talented young teams in the league,” he said. “You would have to be under a rock not to know that.”"
