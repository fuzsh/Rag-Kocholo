        "text": "Current team: Miami Heat\n\n2012-13 stats: 10.1 PPG, 3.8 RPG, 1.5 APG\n\nThe road has never been an easy one for former Big 12 Player of the Year. Age may have been a factor for the oft-troubled power forward, as he entered the league in 2008 at just 19 years old, but it's time for this guy to finally grow up. Drug-related violations have given Beasley a terrible reputation among coaches and GMs in the league and, if not for the vocal support of his former Miami Heat teammates, it's very likely that Beasley would've found himself without a job for this coming year, especially when you consider that last season was his worst yet. The pressure is on Beasley to turn it around in his second stint in Miami. Nothing worse than wasted talent.\n\nCurrent team: Toronto Raptors\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.0 PPG, 1.9 RPG, .7 APG\n\nTraded to the Memphis Grizzlies during the mid-point of last season, Austin Daye must've been excited to get a chance to play for a contender after struggling with some lousy Detroit teams since he was drafted in 2009. However, he still has yet to show anyone that the Pistons were the issue, and not him. Daye was drafted because of his crazy length, and three-point shooting ability, but he still hasn't put on enough weight to bang with any of the bigger guys down low, nor developed any other skills to make him a regular rotation player in this league. With Daye, you often hear the word \"potential\" attached to him, but how long can he float on that alone?\n\nCurrent team: Charlotte Bobcats\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.8 PPG, 7.3 RPG, 1.8 BPG\n\nImprovements were made in his sophomore campaign for Bobcats center, Bismack Biyombo, but it also revealed how far he has to go before he becomes a legitimate threat to anyone in the league. Biyombo has strong shot-blocking ability, but he's also undersized, and relies too heavily on his athleticism to make plays. Biyombo has to improve on his fundamentals and post moves if he's hoping to become an All-Star any time soon. And it wouldn't hurt for him to spend some time practicing on the charity stripe. Making only 52 percent of your free throws is pathetic.\n\nCurrent team: Toronto Raptors\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.7 PPG, 1.2 RPG, 2.2 APG\n\nAfter struggling to do much of anything with the Charlotte Bobcats for four seasons, former Texas Longhorn, D.J. Augustin, signed with the Indiana Pacers in the offseason leading up to the 2012-13 season, hoping for a new shot with a young, up-and-coming team. Unfortunately for him, the Pacers found that they were pretty set with their recently-acquired point guard, George Hill. We can't blame them, either. Augustin was serviceable during his time with the Bobcats but can't compare to a taller, more athletic talent like Hill.\n\nAfter spending two seasons as the full-time starter for the Bobcats, Augustin only got the nod five times with the Pacers this past season, and jumped ship for Toronto in the offseason.\n\nCurrent team: Sacramento Kings\n\n2012-13 stats: 7.2 PPG, 1.0 RPG, 1.3 APG\n\nLook, his name is \"Jimmer,\" so none of us should really be surprised that the former BYU superstar has been something of a bust thus far in the NBA. You just don't become an All-Star with a name like that. It's nothing personal. These are just the facts. Aside from that, though, Fredette has also failed to make any sort of improvement during his two years in the league. Though his field goal percentage jumped up a bit in his sophomore campaign, every other salient statistic dropped down for Jimmer during his second year in Sac-Town. His scoring ability was what intrigued so many scouts when he won the 2011 National Player of the Year Award during his senior year with the Cougars, but Fredette has yet to find a way to translate that talent to the L.\n\nCurrent team: Los Angeles Lakers\n\n2012-13 stats: 7.7 PPG, 2.8 RPG, 1.2 APG\n\nWith the fourth pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Syracuse small forward, Wesley Johnson, hoping that the former Big East Player of the Year would be able to form a young, talented nucleus with point guard, Ricky Rubio, and power forward, Kevin Love. Unfortuantely, Johnson has yet to pan out and he was traded to the Suns. This past offseason, Johnson signed with the Lakers, now appearing to be destined for journeyman status for the rest of his career. Chalk this up as yet another example of why David Khan should never be a GM again.\n\nCurrent team: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\n2012-13 stats: 7.3 PPG, 5.5 RPG, 1.1 APG\n\nLike so many of Rick Pitino's former Louisville players, SF/PF, Earl Clark, has struggled to find his place in the NBA after playing some unorthodox roles for the Cardinals during his collegiate career. Though he enjoyed his best season yet with the Lakers last year, don't expect him to further improve upon that progress with his move to Cleveland for the upcoming year. More likely than not, Clark simply benefited from the pace of Mike D'Antoni's offense, and was able to inflate some of his numbers in the process. Under Mike Brown, it's likely that his stats will trend back down toward the figures he was putting up during his forgettable days in Orlando and Phoenix.\n\nCurrent team: Golden State Warriors\n\n2012-13 stats: 8.3 PPG, 5.3 RPG, 1.4 BPG\n\nOh, how the mighty have fallen. Once considered a top center in the league, knee injuries and general decline have made Jermaine O'Neal a shadow of his former self, the All-Star that dominated frontcourts for the Indiana Pacers during much of the 2000s. Since leaving Indiana, O'Neal has jumped around from Toronto to Miami to Boston to Phoenix and now Golden State, where he'll back-up David Lee and Andrew Bogut for the young, hungry Warriors. Given their style of play, the old, plodding O'Neal doesn't seem like a natural fit for the fast-paced, high-octane Dubs and, truthfully, it probably won't end up working out well for either party. We haven't seen anything from O'Neal in years to convince us that he has any of the game that once made him a force. That isn't about to change any time soon.\n\nCurrent team: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.1 PPG, .9 RPG, .7 APG\n\nDerek Fisher brings two important things to any team looking to make a serious playoff push: leadership and the knowledge that comes with winning multiple championships. That's it, though. There's really nothing else. Fisher seems like the most likely player to follow in Jason Kidd's footsteps as a head coach and, honestly, he might be better off just taking some sort of assistant head coaching position right now than dragging his old ass to the court for another season. He'll probably ride just as much pine either way.\n\nCurrent team: New Orleans Hornets\n\n2012-13 stats: 6.2 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 2.1 APG\n\nGranted, Rivers is just coming out of his rookie year, but, man, that was one bad, bad, bad rookie year. Shooting just 37 percent on the season, Rivers failed to make good on all the pre-draft hype that had him listed as a playmaker and a dead-eye shooter for whatever team was lucky enough to pick him up. Instead, the former Duke star now finds himself in desperate need of changing things around for his sophomore campaign. Will we see a new Austin this year?\n\nCurrent team: Portland Trail Blazers\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.8 PPG, 4.5 RPG\n\nIt isn't often that you see a rookie get traded in his first year with a team. So how do you think former Kansas forward, Thomas Robinson, was feeling after it happened to him twice in the span of just over a year? Drafted by the Kings, Robinson was shipped off to Houston by February, and then over to Portland in July, having failed to make much of an impact with either team. To be fair, the move to Portland probably had more to do with the fact that the Rockets needed to clear cap space for Dwight Howard, but how is Robinson supposed to have any sort of confidence going into his sophomore year when he's already on his third team? With LaMarcus Aldridge as a mentor, things could improve quickly for Robinson, but whether that will be enough for him to be a substantial player of any kind remains to be seen.\n\nCurrent team: Phoenix Suns\n\n2012-13 stats: 7.0 PPG, 2.4 RPG, .8 APG\n\nWe'll say this: you have to give Gerald Green a lot of credit for having a career in the NBA at all right now. After scrapping and grinding his way around Europe and China from 2009 to 2011, and then fighting his way up from the D-League during the 2011-2012 season, Green was finally able to get another call from the NBA in February of 2012 when the Nets offered him a 10-day contract.\n\nGreen would end up making the most of the opportunity, and earned himself a contract with the Pacers during the following offseason. However, while we can't say that he wasted his chance with Indiana, he certainly didn't perform up to expectations with the team. If there's one thing that Green can do, it's dunk. But if there are a few things he can't do, it's just about everything else. After coming off the bench for Indiana this past season, Green was traded to the Phoenix Suns in July.\n\nCurrent team: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.2 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 1.4 APG\n\nFor years, Kendrick Perkins' main function has been to serve as a Dwight Howard-stopper. Sure, Perk could give you some other important contributions on the court—rebounding, scoring and blocking well enough to earn himself some regular playing time for Boston and Oklahoma City. With the decline in his game over the past couple years, though, it doesn't seem like he's really worth the money anymore, and, on top of that, Dwight Howard seems more than capable of stopping himself these days. Sorry, Perk, but we say that your days as a regular rotation player are becoming numbered.\n\nCurrent team: Philadelphia 76ers\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.0 PPG, 1.2 RPG, 1.6 APG\n\nEveryone knew that when former Michigan guard, Darius Morris, was forgoing his senior year in order to enter the 2011 Draft, he was leaving too early. Despite the fact that he still hadn't developed a reliable jumper, Morris decided to throw his name in the hat anyway, and was justly rewarded with a second-round selection, and plenty of time on the bench during his first two seasons in the league. Even with the injuries to Steve Nash last season, Morris was unable to make an impact with the Lakers, and the team passed on re-signing him at season's end. Now with the Sixers, Morris finds himself locked in yet another battle for second place with Tony Wroten, as the two compete to back-up Philadelphia's star rookie, Michael Carter-Williams. Shoulda stayed in school, Darius.\n\nCurrent team: Charlotte Bobcats\n\n2012-13 stats: 4.1 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 0.5 APG\n\nSince 2007, power forward Anthony Tolliver has been all over the place in his pursuit to make it in the league, spanning from the D-League to Turkey with a handful of NBA stints in between. Tolliver is now with the Bobcats—his sixth NBA team in just as many years. And there's a reason that he's failed to make a lasting impact on any one club. Aside from his career year with the Warriors in 2009—numbers that were undoubtedly boosted by Don Nelson's smallball offense—Tolliver has been nothing more than space to fill out the back end of a roster, unable to offer teams much of anything besides some good hustle and a handful of baskets and rebounds. The Charlotte Bobcats are just the latest club in Tolliver's revolving door.\n\nCurrent team: Chicago Bulls\n\n2012-13 stats: 2.6 PPG, 3.1 RPG, .5 BPG\n\nHas Nazr Mohammed ever been good? Though he had one, solid season with the Hawks back in 2001, Mohammed's career averages of 6.3 PPG, and 5.0 RPG suggest to us that he's the type of guy who, inexplicably, has managed to drag his career out for a lot longer than he probably deserved. Mohammed has been in the league since 1998. 1998! Has anyone ever been excited about their team signing Nazr? How does a guy like that survive for this long? Oh, wait, he's almost seven feet tall.\n\nCurrent team: Miami Heat\n\n2012-13 stats: 5.2 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 0.5 APG\n\nRashard Lewis made a pretty solid career during his time with Seattle and Orlando but, unfortunately for him, those days have long since passed. Playing back-up in his first season with Miami, Lewis found himself getting buried in the rotation, just like every other player on the Heat who isn't named LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, or Chris Bosh. At this point in his career, Lewis was probably just happy to get himself a ring, but you can't really say that he did much to earn it. Don't expect that to change in his second go-around with LBJ & Co.\n\nCurrent team: Charlotte Bobcats\n\n2012-13 stats: 3.5 PPG, 4.8 RPG, .8 BPG\n\nIt's hard to believe what injuries and aging can do to a player, especially when they play a position that's as hard on one's knees as center or power forward. Brendan Haywood was a starter for years for the Washington Wizards, and he wasn't half-bad either, nearly averaging a double-double during the 2009-10 season. Unfortunately, no one can beat Father Time and, after getting amnestied by the Dallas Mavericks in 2012, Haywood now finds himself with the Charlotte Bobcats, and his skills considerably diminished since his days in D.C. Haywood has to at least be feeling good about the fact that he was able to pick up a ring with the Mavs back in 2011. When you're playing for the Bobcats, you probably have to remind yourself of the good things like that nearly every day.\n\nCurrent team: Sacramento Kings\n\n2012-13 stats: 2.7 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 1.5 APG\n\nHayes made a career out of being a hard-nosed grinder who played much taller than his 6'6\" listed height. In fact, he was so scrappy and relentless that he played center for the Houston Rockets during their 2009 playoff run. It was this fight and versatility that ended up earning Hayes a 4-year, $22.4M contract from the Sacramento Kings back in 2011. However, since his move to Sac-Town, things have only gone downhill for Hayes. Almost every single one of his stats has dropped, and he somehow managed to get less playing time in his second year with the Kings, despite the fact that they finished 28-54. Unless he pulls off a miracle, it's only looking like more of the same for Hayes as he gears up for the 2013-14 season.\n\nCurrent team: Washington Wizards\n\n2012-13 stats: 2.5 PPG, 2.4 RPG, .5 APG\n\nVesely may be doing well in the WAG department, but his on-court performance is downright disgraceful. Vesely saw his numbers dip in every significant statistical category last season, somehow failing to secure more than 20 minutes of playing time per game, despite the fact that the Wizards were one of the worst teams in the league. If the former Serbian League star can't make it with one of the NBA's worst, then it may not be too long before we see him packing his bags and heading back home. Year three comes with the expectations that a player will have shaken off their rookie rust and sophomore slumps to finally produce some big numbers for their team. Don't expect Vesely to be holding up his end of the deal on that one.\n\nCurrent team: Detroit Pistons\n\n2012-13 Stats: 6.8 PPG, 3.5 RPG, .8 APG\n\nEver since Charlie V. joined the Pistons in 2009, the guy has been an absolute disease on the Detroit roster. His five-year, $35M deal has stood out as one of the worst contracts in the league for years now, and his statistical contributions on the court have been lackluster at best. On top of that, Villanueva's body language has been uninspiring, pouty, and disrespectful since he started riding the pine for the Pistons. There's really just no good reason to have this guy on your team. It's beyond us why Joe Dumars hasn't amnestied him yet.\n\nCurrent team: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\n2012-13 stats: 1.9 PPG, 2.3 RPG, .5 APG\n\nAfter starting out his career in Los Angeles, Turiaf became a journeyman in the league, having now played for Golden State, New York, Washington, Miami and the Clippers, before his move to Minnesota for this upcoming season. Never, though, has Turiaf made much of a difference with any of the teams he's landed on. His career high scoring average is a meager 6.6 PPG, and he hasn't even really come close to that in his past three seasons. It's unlikely that things will improve much with the T'Wolves. At this point in his career, Turiaf is just looking to fill out rosters and cash some checks.\n\nCurrent team: Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n2012-13 stats: 2.4 PPG, 3.0 RPG, .9 BPG\n\nComing out of UConn, Hasheem Thabeet was the type of player who seemed destined to be a force in the league down low. After earning Big East Defensive Player of the Year and co-Big East Player of the Year honors, Thabeet was selected No. 2 overall by the Grizzlies, who were hoping to further improve their frontcourt of Marc Gasol and Zach Randolph. Alas, it wasn't meant to be. Thabeet failed to show any of the ability that had allowed him to tally up 152 rejections during his final year at UConn, and instead became the highest drafted player ever to be sent to the D-League when the Grizzlies shipped him to the Dakota Wizards in 2010. After getting traded to the Rockets, and then the Trail Blazers, Thabeet now finds himself with the Oklahoma City Thunder as a back-up to Serge Ibaka.\n\nCurrent team: Philadelphia 76ers\n\n2012-13 Stats: 1.9 PPG, 3.4 RPG, .5 BPG\n\nKwame Brown has been is no stranger to lists like these, as the oft-criticized, former No. 1 overall pick has managed to disappoint every team he's played for since he was drafted out of high school in 2001. Brown continued that trend last season with the Sixers, failing to make much of an impact even on a team that was in desperate need some help in the post. Honestly, even with two bad knees, Bynum still probably could've outplayed Brown last season. Kwame is just that bad.\n\nCurrent team: Miami Heat\n\n2012-13 stats: 1.4 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nJoel Anthony is just a big body and that's it. He plays almost 10 minutes a game to hack the other team's big men. That's what he gets paid for. He doesn't get paid to rebound or block shots, just look at those numbers. We wish we were near seven feet tall because we would be millionaires."
