        "text": "American basketball player (born 1974)\n\nMalik Jabari Rose (born November 23, 1974) is an American former professional basketball player. Rose played 13 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA), winning championships with the San Antonio Spurs in 1999 and 2003.\n\nRose was born on November 23, 1974, in Philadelphia. He attended and graduated from Overbrook High School in Philadelphia, the same high school as Wilt Chamberlain. He graduated from Drexel University with All-American honors after leading the Dragons to their lone NCAA Tournament victory with an upset of the University of Memphis 75-63. At Drexel, Malik averaged over 16 points and 12 rebounds per game throughout his four-year college career. He was a student teacher at Robert E. Lamberton School and Albert M. Greenfield Elementary. In 2011, the 1995-96 men's basketball team, led by Rose, was inducted into the Drexel athletic Hall of Fame.[1]\n\nRose was drafted in 1996 in the second round by the Charlotte Hornets. Rose is the second Drexel basketball player to participate in the NBA, following Michael Anderson. He was signed as a free agent by the San Antonio Spurs in 1997, and quickly became one of their more popular players due to his displays of hustle, defense, and skill despite being undersized. Rose was on the Spurs' NBA championship teams in 1999 and 2003. On February 24, 2005, Rose was traded along with a pair of first-round draft picks to the New York Knicks for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer, much to the dismay of Spurs fans. A highlight during his tenure with the Knicks was a 10-point, 15-rebound and 9-assist performance in a 94–93 win over the Charlotte Bobcats on April 18, 2007,[2] just missing a triple-double. After being relegated to a minor supporting role for the Knicks for four years, Rose was traded from the Knicks to the Oklahoma City Thunder on February 19, 2009 for Chris Wilcox.[3]\n\nOne of Rose's most memorable games occurred during the opening round of the 2002 Playoffs against the Seattle SuperSonics. With star front court players Tim Duncan and David Robinson out, Rose stepped in as a starter. Bringing the Spurs back from a 26-point half-time deficit, the Spurs eventually lost by 12 but not before making a contest of the game. Malik had 28 points and 13 rebounds for the game.[4]\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder renounced the rights to Rose on December 22, 2009.[5]\n\nRose joined the Madison Square Garden Network as a pregame analyst for his former Knicks team for the 2009-2010 season. He was also named the color analyst for the NBA Development League team, the Austin Toros, who broadcast their games on television for the first time.[6]\n\nOn December 20, 2011, Rose was hired as color commentator for the Philadelphia 76ers television broadcasts. Rose served in this role from 2011 to 2015. On November 15, 2014, Rose made his first appearance for NBA TV. Rose made appearances on NBATV during the 2014–15 season on days when it did not conflict with his 76ers schedule.\n\nOn August 12, 2015, Rose was hired as manager of basketball operations for the Atlanta Hawks.[7] On April 11, 2017, Rose was promoted to the general manager of the Erie BayHawks, the Hawks' affiliate in the NBA G League.[8] He was named the G League's Basketball Executive of the Year in his only season with the organization.[9]\n\nIn 2018, Rose was hired as an assistant general manager within the Detroit Pistons' organization and left the BayHawks.[10]\n\nIn the summer of 2020, Rose stepped down from the Pistons front office to take on a job with the NBA front office as vice president of basketball operations. Rose would be named Head of Basketball Operations for the NBA G-League on January 5, 2022 [11]\n\nOutside of basketball, Rose has been involved in the San Antonio community with his charity work and the San Antonio staple 'Malik's Philly's Phamous' restaurant, specializing in Philadelphia's beloved cheesesteak sandwiches & specialty fries.\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high † Won an NBA championship\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1996–97 Charlotte 54 1 9.7 .477 .000 .613 3.0 .6 .5 .3 3.0 1997–98 San Antonio 53 0 8.1 .434 .333 .639 1.7 .4 .4 .1 3.0 1998–99† San Antonio 47 0 12.9 .463 .000 .671 3.9 .6 .9 .5 6.0 1999–00 San Antonio 74 3 18.1 .457 .333 .722 4.5 .6 .5 .7 6.7 2000–01 San Antonio 57 9 21.4 .435 .176 .713 5.4 .8 1.0 .7 7.7 2001–02 San Antonio 82 1 21.0 .463 .083 .720 6.0 .7 .9 .5 9.4 2002–03† San Antonio 79 13 24.5 .459 .400 .791 6.4 1.6 .7 .5 10.4 2003–04 San Antonio 67 13 18.7 .428 .000 .813 4.8 1.0 .5 .4 7.9 2004–05 San Antonio 50 1 17.2 .464 .000 .697 4.5 .8 .6 .2 6.3 2004–05 New York 26 4 23.6 .425 .167 .782 4.4 .7 .6 .3 8.3 2005–06 New York 72 35 15.5 .374 1.000 .781 3.6 .9 .6 .2 4.4 2006–07 New York 65 2 12.5 .398 .250 .808 2.7 1.0 .4 .1 3.0 2007–08 New York 49 3 10.1 .367 .286 .725 2.1 .6 .3 .1 3.5 2008–09 New York 18 0 8.9 .268 .000 .727 1.7 .6 .1 .1 1.7 2008–09 Oklahoma City 20 0 15.7 .378 .000 .800 3.3 1.3 .5 .1 5.0 Career 813 85 16.5 .437 .177 .743 4.1 .8 .6 .4 6.2\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 1997 Charlotte 2 0 6.0 .500 .000 .000 2.5 .5 .0 .0 2.0 1998 San Antonio 5 0 3.6 .667 .000 .500 1.4 .2 .2 .0 2.0 1999† San Antonio 17 0 11.4 .368 .000 .692 2.3 .2 .4 .2 2.7 2000 San Antonio 4 0 20.8 .444 .000 .556 4.8 .3 .5 .8 5.3 2001 San Antonio 13 0 16.5 .418 .333 .850 3.8 .3 .2 .1 4.9 2002 San Antonio 10 3 29.2 .479 .000 .740 7.9 1.4 1.0 .5 12.9 2003† San Antonio 24 0 23.3 .419 .000 .766 5.8 1.0 .7 .5 9.3 2004 San Antonio 7 0 8.3 .250 .000 .500 2.4 .9 .6 .3 1.4 Career 82 3 17.5 .427 .111 .739 4.3 .7 .5 .3 6.2\n\nDrexel Dragons\n\nList of NCAA Division I men's basketball players with 2000 points and 1000 rebounds\n\nList of NCAA Division I men's basketball career rebounding leaders"
