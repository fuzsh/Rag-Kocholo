        "text": "The team and its players are also conscious of its role and influence around the world. That is why Serge Ibaka, Thabo Sefolosha and Hasheem Thabeet, all of whom have roots in Africa, will be traveling to the continent from August 29th-September 1st to take part in the NBA’s Basketball Without Borders program. The event, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, is a basketball camp for 60 of the top 18-and-under players throughout the African continent. In addition to learning the game of basketball, the young participants will be involved in life skills seminars, while the Thunder trio will be working with NBA Cares to give back to communities in need.\n\nKevin Durant leads all NBA players in career commercial appearances with 63 at last count, according to standings calculated by HoopsHype. Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers is second with 42 and Miami’s LeBron James is third with 39. In team rankings, OKC ranks third with 88 total commercials, trailing the Los Angeles Lakers with 125 and the Miami Heat with 91. Russell Westbrook is second among Thunder players with 11 commercials, followed by Serge Ibaka (six), Nick Collison, Kendrick Perkins and Thabo Sefolosha (two each), Kevin Martin and Reggie Jackson (one each).\n\nLin replied “everything” when asked what hurt and what part of his game was affected by the injury, which occurred in a collision with Thunder guard Thabo Sefolosha. “It’s limited me some, but everybody is hurt, everybody is dinged up,” Lin said. “I’ve just got to find a way to get through it, and if I step on the court, I need to be prepared to play and play well. If you’re injured, you can’t be on the floor. If you’re on the floor, you’re OK. That’s kind of the way it is.”\n\nThis went unnoticed during Thursday night’s closer-than-expected contest between the Knicks and the Thunder, but you can bet that the league will be reviewing it in the days that follow. With about 5:20 remaining in the fourth quarter, J.R. Smith takes an aggressive swing with his right elbow to the head of Thabo Sefolosha. Thankfully for everyone involved, he missed. But it was a violent attempt, and the intent was clear."
