        "text": "There is music in Pau Gasol\"™s professional life. It is the staccato thump of a ball on a wooden floor. The harmonic squeal of sneakers. The pianissimo swish of a nothing-but-net shot.\n\nIt is the music of basketball, the background music to his career, so familiar Gasol barely hears it.\n\nThere is another music prominent in Gasol\"™s life that compels his attention. It is the dark, bass sound of authority urging a sinner to repent. A soprano seeking vengeance through the liquid colors of a note seemingly above the reach of the human voice. The furious vibrato of a tenor taking up arms to rescue his beloved.\n\nIt is the music of opera.\n\nThe thumps and squeaks were reverberating last week as Gasol sat on a bench next to one of the courts at the Bulls\"™ practice facility, talking enthusiastically about \"œTosca\" and \"œDon Giovanni\" and \"œThe Magic Flute\" and \"œIl Trovatore.\"\n\nThrough his growing passion for opera, Gasol has built a friendship with renowned tenor Placido Domingo, a fellow Spaniard. Through his desire to share that passion, Gasol has introduced teammates Nazr Mohammed and Nikola Mirotic to the Lyric Opera of Chicago during his first season with the Bulls.\n\nThe opera has become more than music to Gasol. It is an escape to a more harmonious place.\n\n\"œEvery time I go to the opera, I get away from daily, hectic life,\" Gasol said. \"œIt is what I need for balance.\"\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nTENOR PASSION\n\nDomingo was on the telephone from New York. He graciously agreed to speak loud enough to be heard over a college band playing in the background when this conversation took place.\n\nOf course, this is a man whose unamplified voice fills huge opera houses, so there was no difficulty hearing Domingo as he talked about one of his passions, basketball.\n\nIt is the one that led to a friendship with Gasol that began in Los Angeles, where Domingo variously is general director, singer and conductor at the L.A. Opera. It is where Gasol spent the previous 61/2 seasons playing for the Lakers, sometimes with Domingo watching at the Staples Center.\n\n\"œWe enjoyed the two titles he won here, and we were very sad to lose him,\" Domingo said. \"œBut I am very happy he is having one of his best years with the Bulls.\"\n\nGasol was delighted but not surprised when told Domingo knew of his career-high, league-leading 54 double-doubles this season.\n\n\"œHe keeps up,\" Gasol said. \"œHe\"™s a big sports fan. Soccer, Formula 1 and now basketball.\"\n\nDomingo was delighted but not surprised when told Gasol has attended four of the Lyric\"™s eight operatic productions this season, plus both a Lyric rehearsal and performance of the musical \"œCarousel.\" No wonder Lyric management has asked him to be on its magazine cover next season.\n\n\"œIt is obvious he likes it. And it is wonderful he also gives the opportunity to enjoy the opera to his teammates,\" Domingo said.\n\nThe most familiar link between sports and the opera involves a trope based on the image of bulky sopranos in the role of Wagner\"™s Bruennhilde. Voiced on the air by a San Antonio broadcaster to address the Spurs\"™ losing situation in a 1978 playoff series against the Bullets and later repeated by Bullets coach Dick Motta, \"œThe opera ain\"™t over until the fat lady sings\" quickly became a sports aphorism.\n\nThe skinny of what brought together a five-time NBA All-Star power forward and an 11-time Grammy-winning opera star is this: a member of the opera board in Los Angeles also is a devoted fan of the Lakers. (There is a similar link in Chicago.)\n\nGasol and Domingo first met briefly in the Beijing airport a day after the 2008 Olympics ended. Gasol\"™s Spanish national team had just played \"” and lost \"” a scintillating gold-medal game to the United States. Domingo still regrets being unable to attend that game because he was preparing to sing in the Closing Ceremony just hours later.\n\nA few months earlier, after the Feb. 1, 2008 trade that brought Gasol from the Grizzlies to the Lakers, he had received a welcome-to-L.A. package and letter from Domingo with an open invitation to attend an opera.\n\nAt that time, it was one of the few musical genres Gasol, now 34, had never experienced. He took piano lessons for five years, ending at age 13. He listened to everything from classical to hip-hop, with a personal playlist that excludes only country and heavy metal.\n\nAs he went through free agency last summer before signing a three-year deal with the Bulls, Gasol tweeted a picture of a Chopin CD, saying the music had helped him relax. Although untrained vocally, he has crooned with Spanish singers Pau Dones and Rosana Arbelo on a popular Spanish sports radio show and combined last year with Arbelo on a recording of a Christmas song for UNICEF.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\n\"˜TOSCA\"™ FIRST\n\nGasol soon took Domingo up on the invitation. His first opera would be \"œTosca.\" Gasol and his mother sat with Domingo for the L.A. Opera performance.\n\n\"œI could see right away he loved it,\" Domingo said.\n\nIt was, as Gasol pointed out, the perfect introduction to the opera: packed with memorable, lyrical music, rising to a highly dramatic ending when Tosca leaps to her death after just 21/2 hours, which is about the same time it takes to play an NBA game and a virtual overture by operatic standards.\n\n\"œI love the theatrical play, the passion from the singers, the way the stage looks,\" Gasol said.\n\nGasol was struck by the significance of the theatrical aspect after attending a concert version of Handel\"™s \"œTamerlano\" \"” with Domingo singing the lead \"” in Barcelona four years ago. He earlier had seen the full operatic version with Domingo as the lead in Los Angeles.\n\n\"œIt changes the experience,\" Gasol said of an opera performance with just singing. \"œIt\"™s much more complete when everything is well done. The visual stimulation is also important.\"\n\nHe expressed fascination over an L.A. Opera production of Mozart\"™s \"œThe Magic Flute\" in which the sets were video projections rather than physical scenery. Six years ago, Gasol weathered the 5 hours, 50 minutes of Wagner\"™s \"œThe Valkyrie,\" and he still is struck by its controversial staging on an inclined, rotating platform.\n\n\"œTosca\" remains one of Gasol\"™s favorite operas (the others: \"œLa Boheme\" and \"œLa Traviata.\") He saw it for the third time three months ago at the Lyric.\n\nAllan Muchin, co-chairman emeritus of the Lyric board and a longtime friend and business partner of Bulls\"™ Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf, became Gasol\"™s Chicago opera connection when Reinsdorf learned of his new player\"™s interest in going.\n\n\"œI don\"™t think Jerry has ever been to an opera in his life, but he knows who to call,\" Muchin said.\n\nGasol considered the cultural offerings of Chicago when he debated between joining the Bulls or Oklahoma City as a free agent. In an HBO documentary, Thunder star Kevin Durant said of Gasol after his \"œrecruiting\" visit to Oklahoma City: \"œHe\"™s into, like, orchestras and plays.\"\n\n\"œIt wasn\"™t a decisive factor, but it was definitely a component in the decision,\" Gasol said.\n\nHe has been to \"œNewsies\" at the Oriental Theater, an Adam Levine and the Maroon Five concert at the United Center, a Rosana Arbelo concert at the Cervantes Institute. To mark the April feast day of the patron saint of his native Catalonia, Gasol Instagrammed a picture of himself standing next to a painting in the Art Institute of Chicago, \"œSaint George Slaying the Dragon,\" by 15th Century Catalan painter Bernat Martorell.\n\n\"œPau is a multi-layered, refined type of person,\" Mohammed said.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nTIGHT FIT\n\nThere is a scene in the Marx Brothers\"™ classic film, \"œA Night at the Opera,\" when Groucho\"™s closet-sized shipboard room is filled to comically uncomfortable proportions.\n\nGasol understandably finds it less amusing to cram his 7-foot body into a similarly small space for a night (or afternoon) at the opera. The Lyric solves that problem by seating him either in main floor row AA, fronted by a wide aisle, or in a box, where chairs are movable. In L.A., Gasol often used one of Domingo\"™s seats on a side aisle, allowing his legs to stretch sideways.\n\nThen there is the matter of what to do with a 7-footer (and 6-10 buddies like Mohammed or Mirotic) to avoid blocking the view of people behind them.\n\n\"œI am empathetic about the people behind me,\" Gasol said. \"œI find myself kind of sliding down to make it better or I say to the person behind me, \"˜I\"™m going to lean to the right, you just lean to the right, and if you have any issues, let me know.\"™ \"\n\nGasol and Mohammed sat in a box for an afternoon performance of \"œAnna Bolena.\" It was Mohammed\"™s first time at the opera, and he left sounding like a poster child for the recent Lyric promotional poster, \"œOur singers don\"™t need microphones.\"\n\n\"œAt first, I couldn\"™t believe that,\" Mohammed said. \"œIt was like the singer was sitting next to me. I\"™m like, \"˜No speakers? This is just their voices?\"™ \"\n\nFor Gasol, hooked by the power of great soprano voices, it is an added bonus that Chicago\"™s Civic Opera House is only a five-minute drive from his downtown residence, especially compared to the 45-minutes-to-an-hour each way he experienced in Los Angeles. Even with that downside, he made the effort to see several operas a year in L.A., some when Domingo was not in town.\n\nGasol already is marking his calendar for next winter, when Domingo does a concert at the Lyric with soprano Ana Maria Martinez. Gasol met Martinez backstage after seeing her in \"œDon Giovanni.\"\n\nNote to NBA schedule-makers: Please give the Bulls an off day in Chicago Jan. 9. Pau Gasol wants to start 2016 on a high note.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\n\nÂ©2015 Chicago Tribune\n\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n\"”\"”\"”\"”\"”\n\nARCHIVE PHOTOS on Tribune News Service (for help with images, contact 312-222-4194):\n\n_____\n\nTopics: t000002409,t000002424,t000040672,t000040659,t000002440,t000003277,t000003278,t000003183,t000045873,t000045810,t000045804,t000032883,t000040464,t000032881,t000045839,t000045816,t000045806,g000216305,g000065560,g000362661,g000066164,g000065558,g000220524"
