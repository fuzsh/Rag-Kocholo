She wrote, “I long, as does every human being, to be at home wherever I find myself.” Nazr Mohammed didn’t exactly say it quite so elegantly. But in his 14 years journeying around the NBA through seven different cities, there’s always been the heart and spirit of Chicago within him, where he was born and raised, where the strength and resolve of his late father, Tahiru Abdul, was a guiding force for a young man who was not supposed to have a professional career.",
