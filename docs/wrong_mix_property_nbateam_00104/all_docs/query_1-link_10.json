        "text": "Kevin Martin is in his 12th professional season, yet he's only played 17 career playoff games. Eleven of those were back in 2013 during his lone year with the Thunder.\n\nThe memory of that run, Martin says — a 60-win season, the top seed in the West, one of the best point differentials in NBA history and his only career trip to the second round — was at the root of his desire to get back to a contender this season.\n\nSo he worked out a buyout with the floundering Timberwolves and signed on with the Spurs this past week.\n\nBefore Saturday's matchup with the Thunder, Martin reflected on his time in OKC fondly, though quickly brought up Russell Westbrook's knee injury in the first round, which prematurely dashed the Thunder's title hopes.\n\n“That will always be a what if chapter in my career that'll be hard to close,” Martin said. “It was a perfect team, seemed like we had it all. That injury got us. It happens in professional sports.”\n\nWhile Martin was recently available, the Thunder had an open roster spot which eventually went to Nazr Mohammed. But with OKC's wing troubles, Martin seems like a guy who could've potentially helped. Was there any discussions of a reunion?\n\n“Going into my buyout situation, there was only one team I'd do a buyout for and it was here,” Martin said, pointing at the Spurs logo on his new locker.\n\nWAITERS STILL AWAY\n\nThunder reserve guard Dion Waiters missed his third consecutive game on Saturday night. He's back in Philadelphia mourning the death of his younger brother, Demetrius Pinckney, who was shot earlier this week.\n\nWhile a return date for Waiters hasn't been set, the services for his brother are on Sunday, making it possible Waiters is back for Monday's home game against the Blazers.\n\n“I don't know,” Donovan said. “There's a service tomorrow and I want to make sure he's there for his family and when he's able to get back, he'll get back.”\n\nROBERSON UPDATE\n\nThunder starting shooting guard Andre Roberson missed the second half of the Thunder's Friday night loss to the Timberwolves after tweaking his left ankle in the second quarter.\n\nBut after testing it pregame in San Antonio, Roberson returned to the starting lineup.\n\nBROOKS REFLECTS SOME MORE\n\nServing as a panelist at the ongoing Sloan Conference in Boston, former Thunder coach Scott Brooks went on an ESPN podcast with Zach Lowe.\n\nOn it, Brooks discussed a variety of OKC related topics, as he did a few weeks ago on a Yahoo podcast.\n\nAmong them, Brooks looked back at a controversial LeBron James no-call on Kevin Durant late in Game 2 of the 2012 Finals.\n\n“There is no kinda fouled,” Brooks said. “He was fouled. It would've tied it. But that was the game that I criticize myself constantly. Because we were up 1-0, feeling good, just beat the Spurs, so we were on a five-game winning streak against the best teams in basketball. We were feeling good and we relaxed and they jumped on us, up 15 or 18 points in that first half. But we came back, had a chance to tie the game and it would've been overtime and I felt the momentum was on our side at that point.”\n\nBrooks was also asked about potentially overplaying Kendrick Perkins during his time with the Thunder.\n\n“I took a lot of criticism about Perk playing,” Brooks said. “If you're putting together a fantasy basketball team, you don't want Perk on your team. If you're going to put together a team built on chemistry and guys feeling good about themselves, (you do want Perk). He had a positive affect on the coaches, positive affect on our locker room, individual players. Kevin and Russell loved having him on the court. And they're at an age where they needed that big brother to protect them.”\n\nQUOTABLE\n\nMartin of if he's been surprised that the Thunder is still title-less: “There's a lot that goes into winning a championship. With them, it's definitely not talent. You gotta have some luck and a lot of things go your way. Unfortunately, that hasn't gone their way due in most part to injuries.”"
