        "text": "Gerald Wallace has been traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, reports Yahoo!'s Adrian Wojnarowski. The deal broke just after the NBA trade deadline at 3 PM Eastern. Wallace had been tied to Portland much of the final week before the deadline, but rumors suggested the deal had died Thursday morning due to the Charlotte Bobcats requesting Nicolas Batum in the deal.\n\nWojnarowski reports that Charlotte would receive Joel Przybilla and a second-round pick in the deal. Ken Berger of CBSSports.com reported that it was actually two first-round picks headed to Charlotte, in addition to Przybilla. Przybilla's contract expires at season's end, while Wallace is due $21 million over the next two seasons. The Bobcats were involved in a deal sending center Nazr Mohammed to the Oklahoma City Thunder, as well, meaning Przybilla may not be a buyout option, unless Boris Diaw wants to play center.\n\nWallace will likely play power forward in Portland with LaMarcus Aldridge moving up to center at times. The Blazers have Brandon Roy and Wesley Matthews at shooting guard and Nicolas Batum at small forward."
