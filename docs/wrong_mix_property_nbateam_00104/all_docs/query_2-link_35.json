        "text": "American professional basketball player\n\nFor the Utah congressman, see M. Blaine Peterson.\n\nMorris Russell Peterson Jr. (born August 26, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for Michigan State University, where in the 1999–2000 season he led the Spartans to the national title as Big Ten Player of the Year.\n\nBorn in Flint, Michigan, Peterson played collegiate basketball at Michigan State University, and helped lead them to the 2000 NCAA title.\n\nIn his senior year at MSU, Peterson led the team in scoring, field goal percentage, and free throw percentage. He had a team-high 30 double-digit scoring efforts. He was voted Big Ten Player of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten, and he placed as first or second team All-American on five different polls.\n\nHe was selected 21st overall by the Raptors in the 2000 NBA draft, and was a starter in the majority of their games during his first three seasons. On January 17, 2009, MSU retired his number 42 with MSU's other all-time greats before their game against the Illinois Fighting Illini.\n\nDrafted in the first round by the Raptors in 2000, Peterson was a fan favorite from the moment he stepped on the floor. While enjoying some early success in his professional career, Peterson's production faced a steady decline, before stepping up in the wake of the new era of Raptor youngsters being ushered in, taking on a more expansive leadership role and transforming himself into an elite perimeter defender, a clutch performer and consistent scorer. He is known for his three-point shooting, acrobatic shots, defense, and fearless driving to the basket.\n\nOn December 28, 2005, Peterson set a record for career games played as a Raptor, surpassing Alvin Williams with 418 games played. Peterson also leads the NBA in longest consecutive games played, appearing in 371 straight until November 22, 2006, when he missed his first game in over four years.\n\nPeterson posted career highs in points and rebounds averaging 16.8 points and 4.6 rebounds and threw in 2.3 assists per game through 82 games played in the 2005–06 season.\n\nPerhaps the biggest highlight of his career occurred against the Washington Wizards on March 30, 2007 in a game that helped determine the two teams' playoff seeding. The Raptors trailed 109–106 with only 3.8 seconds left and no timeouts remaining. The Wizards' Michael Ruffin intercepted the full-court pass and tried to toss the ball high into the air so that the clock would run out. But the ball slipped from his hands and was not thrown high enough. There was still enough time on the clock as Peterson caught the ball and launched a \"Hail Mary\" three-pointer and sank it to send the game into overtime. Peterson only played 55 seconds in the game, with his first shift beginning with only 9.3 seconds left in the fourth quarter.[1] The Raptors went on to defeat the Wizards, 123–118.[2]\n\nAfter signing Bryan Colangelo, it became apparent that the re-building process of the Raptors would not include Peterson. It was only a matter of time before his contract expired in the summer of 2007 that he would be gone.\n\nOn July 13, 2007, the New Orleans Hornets signed Peterson to a four-year contract, worth $23 million.[3]\n\nOn July 8, 2010, the Hornets traded Peterson along with #11 overall pick in the 2010 draft, Cole Aldrich, to the Oklahoma City Thunder for two 2010 first-round draft picks (#21, Craig Brackins and #26, Quincy Pondexter).[4]\n\nOn February 24, 2011, Peterson was traded to the Charlotte Bobcats along with D.J. White in exchange for Nazr Mohammed.[5] He was waived four days later when his contract was bought out by the Bobcats.[6] Peterson's final NBA game was played on December 12, 2010 in a 106 - 77 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers where he recorded 2 points.\n\nOn January 14, 2015, TSN announced that Peterson would join their broadcast team as an analyst. For the network's package of Toronto Raptors games, Peterson joined TSN's broadcast team of Jack Armstrong, Leo Rautins, Matt Devlin, and Rod Black both in the TSN Studio and on-site at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario. Peterson will also deliver analysis for SportsCentre and appear throughout the network's expanded NCAA coverage, including TSN's wall-to-wall coverage of NCAA March Madness. As of 2017, Peterson is no longer an analyst on TSN.[7]\n\nOn January 23, 2018 Peterson, in a partnership with Viktor Palushaj, opened \"MoPetes Sports Retreat\" just outside of his hometown of Flint in neighboring Flint Township, Michigan. The menu features Michigan inspired dishes such as The Flintstones Combos, Flint-Town Reuben sandwich, the Izzo sub, and The National Champ Philly cheese steak sandwich.[8]\n\nCareer-high: March 31, 2006 Peterson scored a career-best 38 points vs. the Phoenix Suns.\n\nFirst-round draft choice (21st overall) by Toronto in 2000.\n\nRecorded his 800th career three-point field goal April 3, 2005 vs. the Detroit Pistons.\n\nHad a career-high 14 rebounds April 8, 2005.\n\nHeld the longest active streak of games played, with 371, ending in 2006.[9]\n\nHeld Raptors career records for games played (542) and 3-point field goals (801).[10]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2000–01 Toronto 80 49 22.6 .431 .382 .717 3.2 1.3 .8 .2 9.3 2001–02 Toronto 63 56 31.6 .438 .364 .751 3.5 2.4 1.2 .2 14.0 2002–03 Toronto 82 80 36.0 .392 .337 .789 4.4 2.3 1.1 .4 14.1 2003–04 Toronto 82 29 26.2 .405 .371 .809 3.2 1.4 1.1 .2 8.3 2004–05 Toronto 82 61 30.6 .420 .385 .832 4.1 2.1 1.1 .2 12.5 2005–06 Toronto 82* 77 38.3 .436 .395 .820 4.6 2.3 1.3 .2 16.8 2006–07 Toronto 71 12 21.3 .429 .359 .683 3.3 .7 .6 .2 8.9 2007–08 New Orleans 76 76 23.6 .417 .394 .765 2.7 .9 .6 .1 8.0 2008–09 New Orleans 43 9 12.0 .399 .388 .632 2.0 .4 .3 .1 4.4 2009–10 New Orleans 46 39 21.2 .385 .363 .611 2.7 .9 .5 .1 7.1 2010–11 Oklahoma City 4 0 5.8 .400 .000 .000 .8 .3 .0 .0 1.0 Career 711 488 27.2 .418 .373 .773 3.5 1.5 .9 .2 10.7\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2001 Toronto 8 3 13.8 .514 .444 .750 1.5 1.9 .8 .0 5.4 2002 Toronto 5 5 30.8 .367 .118 .800 2.8 2.2 1.0 .6 9.2 2007 Toronto 6 2 30.5 .517 .500 .833 4.5 .3 .3 .3 6.8 2008 New Orleans 12 12 23.1 .485 .471 .667 2.6 .6 .5 .2 7.2 2009 New Orleans 2 0 10.5 .200 .333 .750 1.5 .5 .5 .0 3.0 Career 33 22 22.6 .457 .387 .767 2.6 1.1 .6 .2 6.7"
