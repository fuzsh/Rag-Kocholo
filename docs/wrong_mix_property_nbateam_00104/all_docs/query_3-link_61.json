Most figured they would be back.\n\nInstead, the Thunder traded Harden to the Rockets that summer. Over the coming years, the Thunder's playoff runs were squashed by injuries and the Golden State Warriors in 2016. Durant then left the team for the Warriors in 2016.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nThey may not have known it at the time, but the 2011-12 team had three future MVPs. They remain a great \"what if\" in the NBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere's where the prominent members of the 2011-12 Thunder are today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKevin Durant was the star of the team. The 23-year-old averaged 28 points per game, leading the NBA in scoring for a third straight season while making his third All-Star team.\n\nDurant left the Thunder in 2016 to join the Golden State Warriors. After winning two championships in three years on the \"super-team\" Warriors, Durant joined the Brooklyn Nets this summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRussell Westbrook was the emerging, high-flying star. He made his second All-Star team in 2011-12 and became Durant's co-star and settling in as the team's point guard.\n\nWestbrook stayed with the Thunder for seven more seasons, even as Durant and James Harden left. He won MVP in 2016-17. He is the franchise leader in points. He was traded to the Houston Rockets in the summer of 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Harden was the Thunder's bench leader, and he won Sixth Man of the Year at just 22 years old.\n\nIn one of the most infamous deals in the NBA, Harden was traded to the Houston Rockets in the summer of 2012 after the Thunder opted not to pay him a max on his next contract. He has since become an MVP and finished in the top five of MVP voting four other times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSerge Ibaka was another emerging star for the Thunder. The athletic 22-year-old was becoming a shot-blocking menace and rim protector.\n\nIbaka was eventually traded to the Orlando Magic in 2016 who then traded him to the Toronto Raptors. He won a championship with the Raptors in 2018-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKendrick Perkins was the veteran presence at center, acquired the previous year for Jeff Green in a trade with the Boston Celtics.\n\nPerkins remained with the Thunder until 2015. He bounced around the NBA after, playing limited minutes. He is now an analyst for ESPN.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNick Collison was a big man off the bench for the Thunder. Never one for big numbers, Collison still played an important role for his defense, hustle, and smarts.\n\nCollison retired in 2018 after 14 years in the NBA, all of them with the Thunder. The team retired his jersey in 2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThabo Sefolosha played a critical role as a wing defender.\n\nSefolosha has since hopped around the league. He played on the Utah Jazz in 2018-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDerek Fisher, after years running point for the Lakers, became a reserve veteran for the Thunder.\n\nShortly after playing, Fisher was hired as the head coach of the Knicks, but was fired in 2016. He is now the head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDaequan Cook was a wing who came off the bench for the Thunder.\n\nCook last played in the NBA in 2013. He now plays overseas, most recently in Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReggie Jackson was the Thunder's rookie point guard, but he played limited minutes.\n\nJackson grew into a big role with the Thunder and was eventually traded to the Detroit Pistons, where he still plays today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVeteran big man Nazr Mohammed also came off the bench.\n\nMohammed played 18 seasons in the NBA, retiring in 2016. He is now a scout for the Thunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCole Aldrich was a second-year center playing limited minutes off the bench.\n\nAldrich went on to play for five teams over the next six years. He last played in the NBA in 2017-18. He played in China last season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoyal Ivey was another veteran guard who played sparingly.\n\nIvey played 10 years in the NBA. He is now an assistant coach with the Knicks after coaching with the Thunder.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nScott Brooks was the head coach of the Thunder.\n\nBrooks coached with the Thunder for nine years and posted a 338-207 record. He is now the head coach of the Washington Wizards.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, see where all of the NBA teams rank after a wild offseason...\n\nNBA POWER RANKINGS: Where all 30 teams stand after a wild summer that shook up the league >\n\nRead next\n\nAdvertisement"
