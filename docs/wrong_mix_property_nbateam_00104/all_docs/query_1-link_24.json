        "text": "Oklahoma City Thunder 102, San Antonio Spurs 82\n\nSA lead series 2-1\n\nSome wondered whether the San Antonio Spurs could win 26 straight games and claim the NBA championships. Well, that remote possibility is no more after the Thunder, roared on by a noisy Oklahoma City crowd, comfortably beat the Spurs 102-82 to end the run at a mere 20-straight victories, ten in the playoffs.\n\nThe teams will meet again in Game 4 at the Chesapeake Energy Arena in OKC on Saturday with the series 2-1 in San Antonio's favour and a different complexion on the series.\n\nSan Antonio swept the Utah Jazz and Los Angeles Clippers and took a 2-0 lead into Thursday's game against OKC but were behind by double figures at the half.\n\nThunder's players shared the points around with five reaching double figures: Kevin Durant (22), Thabo Sefolosha (19 plus six steals), James Harden (15), Serge Ibaka (14) and Russell Westbrook (10). And all but Nazr Mohammed came off the bench and contributed.\n\nSefolosha upset the Spurs' well-oiled offense at the start, with four steals in the first three minutes. The Spurs committed a postseason-worst 21 turnovers and scored their least points in any game this season.\n\nTony Parker led the scoring for the Spurs with just 16 points as Oklahoma City were patient in both defense and offense.\n\nTim Duncan had 11 points on 5-for-15 shooting, taking 11 of San Antonio's first 25 shots while Parker was closed down by OKC.\n\nMiami Heat take a 2-0 lead to the Boston Celtics on Friday evening in the Eastern Conference Finals."
