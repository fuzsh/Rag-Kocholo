Earlier today, free agent center Nazr Mohammed tweeted that he hopes to remain a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder next season.

The 33-year old center was traded from the Bobcats to the Thunder in February. Mohammad has been something of a journeyman in his NBA career, having played for the 76ers, Hawks, Knicks, Spurs (who he won a championship with), Pistons, Bobcats, and Thunder in his career. Prior to coming to the NBA, Mohammed won two NCAA championships with the University of Kentucky.

Mohammed averaged 7 points and 5 rebounds on 52.2% shooting during the regular season, but was not nearly as effective in the postseason, averaging only 2.3 points on 41.2% shooting and 40% free throw shooting.
