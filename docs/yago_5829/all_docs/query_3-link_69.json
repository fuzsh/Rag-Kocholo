She was a lifelong member of Concordia Lutheran Church.\n\nOn Nov. 19, 1949, Eleanor married her husband, Thomas Lyden. The two made their home in Boardman, where they raised their children, Tom Lyden and Alene Lyden.\n\nAfter being a homemaker for several years, Eleanor began working for Kmart in Boardman as a department manager. She worked there for 30 years and retired in 1990 to care for her husband, Tom, who passed away in 1991.\n\nEleanor loved her family and was a caring and wonderful wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, aunt, sister and friend. She enjoyed being outdoors. Her favorite activities included gardening, camping and boating. She was affectionately called Gram by many, not only by her family, but by friends.\n\nShe is survived by her grandchildren, Ray (Kristy) McLain Jr. of Boardman; Bryan (Erika) Lyden of Boulder City, Nevada; Andrea Lyden of Seattle, Washington; and great-grandchildren, Haley and Joshua McClain.\n\nBesides her parents, Eleanor was preceded in death by her husband, Thomas; two children, Tom Lyden and Alene Lyden McClain; one brother, George Puhalla; two sisters, Ruth Puhalla and Ethel Schragel; and one brother-in-law, Nick Schragel.\n\nServices will be held at Vaschak-Kirila Funeral Home.
