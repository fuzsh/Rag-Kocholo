Photo: Metro-Goldwyn-Film.\n\t\n\t<b>Eleanor Boardman</b> (1898-1991) was an American stage and silent screen actress, famous for King Vidor's <i>The Crowd</i> (1928). \n\t\n\tBorn in Philadelphia, Eleanor Boardman originally worked on stage, but after temporarily losing her voice in 1922 she entered silent films. She was chosen by Goldwyn Pictures as their &quot;New Face of 1922,&quot; through which she signed a contract with the company. After several successful supporting roles, she played the lead in Rupert Hughes' Souls for Sale (1923), also with Frank Mayo, Richard Dix, and Lew Cody. Boardman plays a runaway wife who ends up in Hollywood and from an extra becomes a star. Her husband (Cody), apparently a dangerous robber and killer of wives, pursues her. The film gives an insight view of Hollywood and many silent stars had cameos in the film.  That same year, Boardman's growing popularity was reflected by her inclusion on the list of WAMPAS Baby Stars. \n\t\n\tEleanor Boardman appeared in more than 30 films during her career, achieving her greatest success in director King Vidor's The Crowd (1928). Her performance in that film is widely recognised as one of the outstanding performances in American silent films. Other memorable titles were e.g. The Circle (Frank Borzage, 1925), Bardelys the Magnificent (King Vidor, 1926) with John Gilbert, and Tell It to the Marines (George W. Hill, 1926) with William Haines and Lon Chaney. After some success in sound films, Boardman retired from acting in 1935 and retreated from Hollywood. Her only subsequent appearance was in an interview filmed for Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's British documentary series Hollywood (1980). From 1926 to 1931 she was married to Vidor and had two daughters with him. In 1940 she married director Harry d'Abadie d'Arrast.\n\t\n\tSource: Wikipedia.\n\t\n\t<b>And, please check out our blog <a href=\"http://filmstarpostcards.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">European Film Star Postcards</a>.</b>",
