        "text": "US Copyright Law protects creative property for almost a full century, but on January 1, 2024 films from the year 1928 moved into the public domain. CCA celebrates these important pieces of cinematic history all day on Monday June 17th with our first ever Public Domain Day!\n\nThe story centers on Johnny Sims (played by James Murray), an idealistic young man who moves with his new wife, Mary (Eleanor Boardman), to a major city, where he hopes to become a major success. Instead, the couple find themselves unable to cope with the harsh realities of life in the modern urban metropolis.\n\nMore akin to the neorealism of European films, director King Vidor’s The Crowd offers a rare morbid view of society far removed from the upbeat, lively fare reflected in many American silent films. Vidor won universal acclaim for his innovative methods of illustrating the harsh, impersonal aspects of urban existence. “The crowd” is seen in the film as a literal force dedicated to breaking down individual stamina and hope. The cinematography by Henry Sharp (much of it shot on location in New York City with hidden cameras) earned enthusiastic praise for his innovative style and amazing camera angles. The studio argued for upbeat changes to the movie, and seven different endings were eventually shot. Vidor managed to prevail with his version of the final cut.\n\nThe Crowd never attained box-office success, though it stands as one of the great American films. Although Murray’s performance was highly acclaimed, his life mirrored his on-screen alter ego’s tragic run of bad luck. Frustrated at not having star-making follow-up roles, he fell on hard times and became an alcoholic. His body was found in the Hudson River in New York City in 1936. Whether his death was accidental or the result of suicide was never determined."
