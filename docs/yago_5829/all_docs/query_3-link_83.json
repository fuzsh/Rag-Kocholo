        "text": "More Borzage… THE CIRCLE is a drawing-room comedy, I guess, set in Hollywood England. A very young Joan Crawford appears briefly (Borzage would go on to have a fling with her, but didn’t everyone?). Eleanor Boardman is top-billed but Creighton Hale is the true lead — without his usual glasses, but with a monocle, which doesn’t have quite the same Harold Lloydian effect. Hale (SEVEN FOOTPRINTS TO SATAN) is the man Kenneth Anger accused of having sex with a goat on screen, but he definitely wasn’t talking about this film. It’s about fidelity and marriage and asserting one’s manhood by fending off one’s wife’s suitors, which isn’t the kind of “romance” that really suits Borzage, so far as I can see.\n\nIt takes Hale the whole movie to stand up to his competitor, and about half the movie to even emerge as the protagonist.\n\nBorzage is distinctive because he was able to pursue a very particular vision and tone, defying reality like Baron Munchausen in pursuit of a dream of love. He had a particular gift for the gestures and expressions of flirtation and first attraction. This delirious romanticism inspires most of his best films, though any strong emotion could serve him well. Looking at love in decay, at the stuff that traditionally happens AFTER the happy ending, is not his bag at all. Which means that the two adulterous couples in the film, who AREN’T supposed to win our good wishes, are somehow more compelling that the leading man’s plight.\n\nVisually, the film is consistently gorgeous, with every exterior a magic hour extravaganza of hazy backlight.\n\nJoan.\n\nTHE CIRCLE, Warner Archive edition, was a gift from a reader but I’m afraid I forget who! Thank you anyway, I got around to watching it eventually!\n\nJust finished writing about THE SQUAW MAN, America’s first feature film and the first movie adaptation of a Broadway play (or is it? No it isn’t: see Comments section). The article will appear elsewhere, it is hoped, and I will tell you about it later.\n\nWhich means I have nothing to say here except to laugh and point at the funny intertitle.\n\nOh, OK. Let’s compare DeMille’s original (available only in its 1918 re-release form, I believe) with his talkie (VERY talkie) remake.\n\nThe first film manages to get its hero, an English toff, Out West in about fifteen minutes, despite pausing for a blaze at sea and some tricky business in New York. The remake takes half an hour to accomplish the same task, and doesn’t even manage the oceanic inferno or the Big Apple stopover.\n\nThe first film stars Red Wing, a full-blooded Winnebago (a tribe with what you might call cinematic implications), whereas the talking picture stars Lupe Velez. Lupe Velez was famous for not being an Indian.\n\nThe second film gets by with intertitles, although admittedly they have that Edisonian quality of sometimes telling you what you’re about to see — a film with its own spoilers — but the remake has as much verbiage as it has prairie, going on for miles in all directions. Everyone has been instructed to talk slow for the nice microphone, so that Warner Baxter (as an English nobleman, pwahahaha) sounds as much like an Indian as Lupe.\n\nIn spite of all this, I do find the remake, ponderous though it is (crude by 1931 standards) slightly more fun, if only because it contains this image —\n\nIn fact, Eleanor Boardman, in her penultimate film, seems to inhabit better compositions than the entire rest of the cast. I must see more of her, starting with Borzage’s THE CIRCLE, recently supplied by a thoughtful Shadowplayer…"
