Eleanor Boardman, actress during the silent film era who was married to director King Vidor, has died. She was 93.

Miss Boardman died Thursday in her sleep at her Santa Barbara home, her stepdaughter, Suzanne Parry, said.

A native of Philadelphia, Miss Boardman won nationwide fame as the “Kodak Girl” on posters that advertised Eastman Kodak photographic products.

Her subsequent Hollywood career, which included few talkies, peaked with her leading role in “The Crowd” in 1928. Vidor directed the silent film.

Miss Boardman also appeared in such silents as “Stranger’s Banquet,” “The Silent Accuser,” “Memory Lane” and “Tell It to the Marines.”

Her brief fling with talkies included such films as “She Goes to War,” “Mamba,” “The Flood” and a remake of “The Squaw Man.”

Miss Boardman in effect retired from the film business in 1931.

She divorced Vidor in 1933. They waged several court battles over the next decade over support and custody of their two daughters. Vidor won custody when Miss Boardman took the girls to live in pre-World War II Europe. But she returned to the United States and regained custody of the children.

Miss Boardman was also married to French director Harry D. D’Arrast.

Survivors include her two daughters, Belinda Vidor Holliday, of Middleton in Northern California, and Antonia Vidor Whitnah, of Carmel, and four grandchildren.

At Miss Boardman’s request, there will be no services.
