The articles were about London's Windmill Theatre, one entitled 'Extracts from the Diary of a Windmill Girl', written by Pat Raphael, and the other on the Film \"Murder at the Windmill.\" You can still read both of these articles by clicking the covers shown here.\n\nBut since then I have added a great deal more on the Windmill Theatre to the site, including a vast amount of programmes, pictures, and articles. Indeed, the Windmill Theatre section of the website is practically a website in itself. The rest of this page acts as an index to the plethora of material on the Windmill Theatre so read on and enjoy.\n\nThe Windmill Theatre first opened on the 22nd of June 1931 with a play by Michael Barringer entitled 'Inquest!', see programme here. But the Windmill is obviously far more famous for Mrs Henderson's creation of 'Revudeville' and her innovative use of the static nude tableau.\n\nStaying open during most of the war years the Theatre also earned itself the now well known phrase... \"We Never Closed\".\n\nIndex to features on the Windmill Theatre\n\nClick to see all the Windmill Reudeville Souvenir Programmes.\n\nAbove - Click for 'The Windmill Sails,' an Article about Mr. Van Damm and the Revudevillegirls, with images from Revudeville 32.\n\nAbove - Click the covers for Five 1950s programmes from The Windmill Theatre's Revudeville era\n\nAbove - A Programme for 'Inquest!' the first production at the newly opened Windmill Theatre in June 1931.

That was the night of the Windmill's farewell performance and when the curtain fell for the last time on London's world famous little theatre, and the stage door locked shut behind its keeper, the Windmill's heart stopped beating. All that was left was the lingering smell of a good cigar, the ghost of a fan dancer, the last faint echoes of laughter and applause, and then darkness. After 32 years the Windmill had breathed its last breath. Or had it? No one could have predicted that half a century later, in the year 2014, the world would still remember with affection the Windmill Theatre with its famous comedians and its legendary Windmill Girls.\n\nFifty years on, in the public's heart, this particular British institution \"Never Closed\". This full colour hardback special edition book commemorates the Windmill on the fifty year anniversary of the theatre's closure. With over 600 illustrations (photographs and ephemera), stories and contributions from ex Windmillite Barry Cryer OBE, Windmill girls and boys who danced on through the blitz and many more, this book will remind those who were there of the phenomenon that was the Windmill, and give those who weren't the feeling of having visited the theatre that famously never closed.\n\nClick to buy the book at Amazon.co.uk.\n\nOther Books on the Windmill Theatre\n\nSheila Van Damm authored a book published by Putnam & Co.Ltd., London in 1957, called 'No Excuses\".

These drawings are in the Tate collection and can be viewed online here.\n\nThe British Film Institute has a copy of the film \"Dawn In Piccadilly\" which was screened at cinemas in the 1960's. Although not availiable to view at the moment the BFI synopsis of the film says it is: 'a nostalgic documentary about the legendary Windmill Theatre in London's West End. Dawn Maxey one of the Windmill Girls, a dance troupe, talks about how she became one of the girls and what she enjoys about it. We see her in rehersal and performing a fan dance. George Martin, speaking from the nearby Pop's Club, introduces the film and gives a survey of the theatre's history. We learn that great entertainers and comedians like Bruce Forsyth and The Goons started their career at the Windmill, where the programmes were a combination of dance and comedy acts.'\n\nIn 1969 the BBC made a television documentary about the Windmill Theatre called 'If it moves it's rude'.
