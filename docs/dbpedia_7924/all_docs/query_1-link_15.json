Hiring feisty impresario Vivian Van Damm to look after the newly renovated Windmill Theatre, the improbable duo presents a bill of non-stop variety acts, but as war looms something more is required to boost morale and box office figures… Enter The Windmill Girls.\n\nCoronation Street and Scott And Bailey star Bennett (Mrs Henderson) is a two-time Olivier Award winner, having picked up a pair of UK theatre’s most prestigious prizes for her performances in hit musicals Hairspray and She Loves Me.\n\nBartholomew’s stage career has spanned more than four decades and has included roles in Into The Woods and Radio Times, while Williams’ credits including creating the role of Truly Scrumptious in the original West End production of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\n\nMrs Henderson presents features music by George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain with lyrics by Don Black."
