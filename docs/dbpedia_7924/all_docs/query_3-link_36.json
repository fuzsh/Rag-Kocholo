        "text": "An early start is the best way to create a solid foundation and strong learning habits. At Tutoring Club, we create a fun environment for children to learn the basics and develop their own unique learning style.\n\nAt this grade level, we focus on developing phonics skills as your student starts their exciting journey toward independent reading. They will connect their newfound language skills to pencil and paper, strengthening their writing skills every step of the way.\n\nFor math, we dive headfirst into numbers and their properties. As students become more comfortable with numerical concepts, they are taught to count and identify patterns. Ultimately, students will apply this knowledge to introductory addition, subtraction, and place value exercises.\n\nLet’s face it—schools and the way kids are taught has changed…A LOT. New methodologies have made it difficult for teachers and parents alike to teach new concepts to students. That’s where we come in—our programs teach concepts in a way that your student can easily understand and take to the classroom.\n\nAt this age, readers are expected to extract and analyze information. Our expert tutors work with students on utilizing root words, context clues, and supporting details to deepen their understanding of the texts.\n\nBeginning with basics like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, students first master foundational math principles and develop number sense—an understanding of place value, rounding, and number patterns. We then introduce more advanced concepts like fractions and decimals, both of which become focal points in future math courses.\n\nTo thrive in middle school, strong study habits and organizational skills are more important than ever. At Tutoring Club, we eliminate all the unwanted stress that comes with more challenging homework assignments and more demanding exams. In addition to developing their study skills, we help them navigate their daily schoolwork– from homework and essays to prepping for that pesky Algebra quiz, our tutors can help your student directly with their assignments from school.\n\nFor students performing below grade-level or for those looking to get ahead with their reading, math, or writing skills, Tutoring Club’s academic programs are a perfect solution. Our curriculum is designed to boost confidence levels and understanding of key concepts, regardless of your student’s current confidence level. These programs allow for students to take their knowledge to new heights and tackle the remainder of middle school with enthusiasm and self-assurance!\n\nThe dense workloads and ever-changing schedules of teenage students can be overwhelming. By serving as an intermediary between parent and student, we eliminate the late nights and unwanted stress that comes with more challenging homework assignments and more demanding examinations. At this stage of an academic career, learning how to study is as important as studying itself. To produce successful competitors in the ‘game’ that is school, we impart both the structure and technique needed to maximize student potential. Checking grades, limiting distractions, and developing strong rapports with teachers are just some of the practices that we instill in our students to make learning a priority, not an afterthought."
