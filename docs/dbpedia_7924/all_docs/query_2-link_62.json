        "text": "You might be looking for: Donna (episode)\n\nDonna Roberta Paulsen is the former Chief Operating Officer of Specter Litt Wheeler Williams and the wife of Harvey Specter, having originally worked as his legal secretary for over twelve years.\n\nShe briefly left him to work for Louis Litt. However, Louis fired her so that she could go back to work for Harvey. Wanting more out of her life, she convinced Harvey to promote her to senior partner despite her lack of legal knowledge or credentials, which Harvey agreed to as he believed the firm could not operate without her. However, Harvey was reminded by Katrina Bennett, Louis Litt and Jessica Pearson that partnership wasn't a title meant to be given to anyone, and was instead given the position of COO instead.\n\nHistory\n\nSeason 1\n\nDonna, early in the series, is established as a sharp-witted woman, often holding her own against Harvey and dissing Louis when he advances on her. She is first seen helping Harvey with the associate recruitment. When Mike Ross barged in through the door while trying to dodge the police, she thought that he was the late applicant and let him in.\n\nDonna has been portrayed as Harvey's trusted secretary, but more is shown about their relationship and also about herself when Harvey gets tangled with D.A. Cameron Dennis' scandal. She gives Jessica Pearson a very important piece of evidence that will help Harvey prove his innocence about Dennis' evidence burying. When asked why, Donna says that she can't let Harvey take the fall for Dennis. When Harvey learns of this, he is very upset with Donna but later apologizes to her.\n\nSeason 2\n\nThis section needs a rewrite\n\nA four year old suit is resurrected from the past by Travis Tanner. The suit lists the original client for damages, and the firm for fraud, accusing Harvey of suppressing smoking gun evidence: a memo that revealed the car manufacturer had knowledge of a defective car hood on their products.\n\nHarvey claims that he didn't receive the file and Donna tells him that she never saw it and if he didn't receive it then that means that nothing came by her desk. Harvey directs Donna to search the original case for the memo to confirm it never came through their firm. After days in the file room, Donna finds the file with her timestamp on it and begins to panic. After catching Donna next to the fax machine twice, Mike confronts her about shredding the file and advises her to tell Harvey the truth or he will.\n\nHarvey, after Mike spilled coffee on an affidavit stating the memo never came through the firm, and almost committing perjury, is informed of the situation. He seeks Donna out immediately, finding her in the women's washroom, and he confronts her about the file. Harvey, expressing relief that she found the file, is immediately devastated when she tells him she just destroyed it to protect him ending in a huge argument.\n\nJessica learns the truth and tells Harvey that Donna will have to be fired. Harvey wanted to be the one to tell Donna, but Jessica values Donna and as this is her firm, she will have the talk with Donna where she tells her how much she is valued but that this situation dictated extreme measures. As Donna leaves the building, Mike and Rachel stand near the elevator and Harvey pushes the elevator button for her and watches her leave.\n\nWhen a mock trial is situated in the Pearson-Hardman when Harvey goes to trial, Mike convinces Donna to come back and testify. When she shows up, Louis Litt pressures her, causing Harvey to jump in.\n\nAt the end of \"Rewind\", Harvey tells Jessica that he will be getting Donna back.\n\nShe returns in \"Asterisk\" and helps Harvey and Jessica figure out Hardman's plan by realizing that Louis has just been promoted to senior partner.\n\nSeason 3\n\nDonna, after being rehired by Pearson Darby, engages in a relationship with British lawyer Stephen Huntley, and after releasing the news of her intimacy with Stephen to Harvey, is initially greeted with an approving response from Harvey. However as the season progresses, we see Harvey's disapproval for Donna's relationship with Stephen, perhaps an implication of Harvey's feelings and past relations with Donna.\n\nDonna, after realizing Stephen's involvement in the Ava Hessington murder case shamefully apologizes to Harvey admitting she was unaware of who Stephen really was and the fact that she had been with a murderer.\n\nSeason 4\n\nDonna was charged from the District Attorney's office, by Terrance Wolf for illegally obtaining maintenance records from the Liberty Rail file room by impersonating an NTSB agent, a serious felony which can result in jail time. This not only nullified the win, but also put Donna in great danger. Eventually the charge was reduced to Intent, after Harvey explained to Wolf that since they will not disclose the documents (which would put them in danger) , no proof of damage exists. Eventually after getting more evidence from Joe Henderson, Harvey was able to force Evan Smith to drop the charges against Donna. The final words in the episode were Harvey telling Donna that he loves her.\n\nSeason 5\n\nTo be added\n\nSeason 6\n\nTo be added\n\nSeason 7\n\nTo be added\n\nSeason 8\n\nTo be added\n\nSeason 9\n\nDonna lies with Harvey in her bed, with Harvey telling Donna that he wished he had come to his senses earlier. As Donna tells them that it's time they got some sleep, Harvey tells her that everything has changed. A few hours later, Harvey and Donna finish leaving phone calls to Mike and Rachel about their night together. As the pair discuss their relationship, they are interrupted by Louis, who arrives at the apartment to deliver some bad news. Harvey and Donna briefly discuss how to hide Harvey's presence before Harvey states that there is no reason to hide their relationship from Louis. As they open the door, Louis sees the two and assumes that they were working all night to handle the Zane situation, which both Harvey and Donna play along with, while making sexual innuendos the whole time. Louis informs them that they need to issue a press release and presents a statement he had drafted which condemns Robert's actions while signifying that the firm is still supporting him. Before he leaves, Louis tells Harvey that he needs to work with Samantha and sign all of Robert's clients before they find legal representation elsewhere. Donna then asks Harvey not to share the news of them being together with anyone else until the Robert matter is handled.\n\nLater that night, Donna receives a phone call with Thomas, who apologizes for not calling her back, stating that he knew she was going to break up with him since they were going from spending nights together to suddenly going for lunch, and that he couldn't bear to hear what she had to say. Donna tells him that he is a good man and the pair amicably end their relationship. Donna later receives a phone call from Harvey that he cannot come over to her apartment tonight, and tells her that he feels bad for lying to Samantha about needing to be alone when he had rushed out of her office. Donna divulges that she just broke up with Thomas, causing Harvey to briefly regret his decision, informing her that he did not know that she was still dating him when he came over. Donna soothes the blow by claiming that while they hadn't officially broken up, Thomas knew that it was over, adding that Harvey did nothing wrong.\n\nFollowing his run-in with Samantha, Harvey heads to Donna's office, notifying her that Samantha knows about them. While Donna understands where Samantha is coming from, Harvey responds that he cannot accept the things Samantha said to him and that he would have punched her if she wasn't a woman. Donna reminds him that Samantha does not like being treated differently for being a woman, and that since Samantha loves to fight, Harvey should box with her and that way they can get it out of their system. Harvey retorts that he is not hitting a woman, while Donna adds that Samantha has military training and that in a fight, she believes Samantha would win. Harvey begins to leave in bewilderment, although Donna adds that they would both like to fight each other and that for Harvey to refuse getting in the ring with her just because she is a woman would be disrespectful of her.\n\nThe next night, Donna goes to Mike and Rachel's old apartment at Harvey's behest, wondering why he invited her there. Harvey discloses that when Mike suddenly left New York, he asked Harvey to rent out the apartment on his behalf; wanting to retain the apartment in case they ever returned, Harvey created a fake tenant and had been paying the rent every month. Harvey tells Donna that a week ago, he wouldn't have slept with her if he knew she was still with Thomas, but that the moment he realized he wanted to be with her, he felt like he was already in a relationship with her. He adds that he thought he was going to lose everything at the hearing, and despite not losing, he felt empty in the aftermath, and that things finally made sense when they got together. He then admits that the name he used for the fake tenant was none other than Rick Sorkin, which Donna remembers is the name of the applicant who didn't show up to Harvey's associate interviews. Harvey tells Donna that he loves that she gets him, and the pair kiss.[1]\n\nThe next morning, Donna and Harvey head to Louis' house, where they see him wearing a Speedo, which Louis refers to as a \"mankini\", claiming that wearing it instead of underwear is extremely supportive. Harvey and Donna refuse the offer and instead try to tell him that they are together and to explain why Harvey spent the night at Donna's apartment, although Louis is oblivious and believes that by together they mean standing together side-by-side and that Harvey had spent the night at Donna's due to plumbing issues. Donna then explicitly states that she and Harvey are in a relationship and that they didn't want to share the news before when the timing was bad, with Harvey adding that they wanted Louis to know, as their partner and friend, although Louis replies that while he is happy to hear their good news, there is also some bad news.\n\nBack at the firm, Donna inquires into how long Faye is going to stay, with Louis responding that it would up to the discretion of the New York State Bar Association. Harvey retorts that there is no way he would accept some outside taking control of his firm, while Alex Williams begins to tell Louis that they could have avoided it, only for Samantha to intercede, claiming that Alex was going to say that they could have avoided this predicament had they removed Robert's name.\n\nAt that moment, Faye walks in, announcing that she wished to meet them and criticizing the firm's management, such as how the firm had two disbarred managing partners in two years, a junior partner who had gone to prison, and that she believes Harvey was an involved party in Mike Ross' fraud. Faye adds that if they want her gone, they would have to show her that they would stop crossing lines and fly straight, revealing that not only does she have the power to fire them, but that she can approve cases, allocate resources and do anything else she sees fit in her capacity as Special Master. Faye announces that her first order of business would be removing Robert Zane's name from the firm name, causing Samantha to reply that she would find dirt on Faye if Faye attempted to do so. Faye responds that this kind of thinking is the exact reason she had to take over their firm and that Samantha has no say in the matter, causing Samantha to retort that she would be leaving the firm. As she storms out, Faye informs the others that their days of operating the firm as they seem fit, likening it to the Wild West, are over.\n\nReturning to her office, Donna is questioned by Katrina how long Faye would be at their firm when Faye herself walks in. Katrina introduces herself to Faye before excusing herself, and Faye asks Donna to schedule an exit interview with Thomas, stating that she finds it hard to accept that a man would fire his law firm after that firm placed his interests high enough to break privilege. Knowing that Thomas would not lie for them again, Donna goes to Harvey's office to notify him of Faye's plan and adding that they need to get rid of Faye, with Harvey replying that they need to find a way to avoid that exit interview.\n\nIn her office, Donna is informed by Harvey that Thomas has agreed to be their client again. Donna wonders if Thomas would arrive to sign the engagement letter as Faye wishes to have the exit interview with him, although she calms down when Harvey informs her that Thomas had given his word. Donna asks Harvey how he can make everything feel better, to which he responds that it is because he is Superman and Donna is Lana Lang. Donna retorts that she is Lois Lane instead, although Harvey quips that she is the best of both as she is a redhead before he leaves, claiming to go save Metropolis, which Donna scoffs at, claiming Harvey does not even know his own phone number. Shortly after, Thomas arrives at Donna's office to sign the engagement letter. He and Donna have a small chat, and Thomas elects to take the letter to Harvey's office to sign there instead of signing it now and giving it to Donna.\n\nLouis returns to the firm after going out for bowling, meeting with Donna in the associates' kitchen. He apologizes for not celebrating in the monumental news of Donna's relationship with Harvey and asks to indulge in conversation, specifically regarding and comparing Harvey's sexual prowess. As Donna leaves and heads to Harvey's office to inform him of what Louis had said to her, Harvey notifies her that Thomas backed out of signing with them as he could not handle Harvey and Donna being together. Knowing that Thomas no longer being a client would lead to Faye going through with the exit interview, Donna tells Harvey that she would tell Faye the truth. Heading to Faye's office, Donna informs Faye that she was in a relationship with Thomas that ended and that this led to Thomas leaving the firm; additionally, Donna adds that having an exit interview with him would reopen the wound and asks Faye if she ever had a relationship she thought would last but ended badly. Faye, sympathizing with the situation due to the circumstance with her husband, thanks Donna for telling her the truth and notifies her that she will no longer be seeking an exit interview with Thomas.\n\nDonna returns to Harvey's office, but as the pair begin discussing and flirting, Gretchen interrupts them and tells them to head to IT right away. There, they find Louis reprimanding Benjamin for ratting his orders out to Faye, and he tells Benjamin that he is fired. Donna refuses to have Benjamin fired and asks for it to be put to a vote, only for Louis to respond that as managing partner, he can fire support staff without the need for a vote and that Harvey would only agree with Donna in a vote because they are in a relationship. Donna replies that Harvey wouldn't do that, but both she and Louis notice that Harvey is hesitant to argue against Benjamin's firing. Faye then appears and tells Louis that Benjamin would not be fired, while Louis leaves after replying that he is not sticking around for Faye to publicly humiliate him for a third time.[2]\n\nThe next morning, Donna is in her office when Harvey enters, asking why they hadn't spent the night together. Donna states that she doesn't like that Harvey agreed with her publicly while personally disagreeing with his stance, and after Harvey replies that he didn't want her to be mad at him, she realizes that he is fearful that she would leave him. Donna reassures him that she would not leave him, especially due to a work-related incident. Harvey reveals that he occasionally watches The Oprah Winfrey Show and discusses maintaining the work-life balance in their relationship when Gretchen interrupts them, notifying them that Faye stripped Louis of his title as managing partner and that they need to go see him. Harvey, however, tells Donna to see Louis alone while he goes to Faye's office to talk to her. Donna heads to Louis' office, noting a worker scraping his title off his office window. She apologizes for the events of the previous night, revealing that she has an older sister who turned her boyfriends into doormats, a fate she does not wish Harvey to befall to, and assures Louis that she would not allow her relationship with Harvey to affect how they treat him.\n\nThe next day, Faye heads to Donna's office, notifying Donna that she is now acting managing partner and that she requires a secretary. Donna initially refuses as she is now COO, claiming that resuming secretarial work would send an unflattering message, although Faye responds that she has heard Donna was the best in the firm and wants Donna to manage her files for her. Donna asks if she would get demoted if she refuses, which Faye affirms. Not wanting to receive a demotion and lose her title as COO, Donna agrees to perform secretarial duties for Faye.\n\nWhile managing Faye's files in her office, Harvey storms in to discuss the threat of being sued by his client, Dan Foley. However, Donna is too busy being Faye's secretary, angering Harvey. Donna stops Harvey from going to Faye, not wanting him to fight her battles, and suggests that they go out for dinner to clear their head and prevent their work troubles from affecting their relationship. Donna heads to the bathroom to apply lipstick when Gretchen walks in, informing her that Faye is looking for her. Donna adds that Faye wishes for her to be her secretary and asks Gretchen to cover for her while she goes out for dinner. Gretchen discloses that she is aware that Donna and Harvey are together and offers to take over Faye's secretarial duties on her behalf. Donna initially refuses, but when Gretchen is adamant on doing so, Donna thanks her and leaves, stating that she owes Gretchen.\n\nAt the restaurant, Harvey discusses Faye at length before the pair realize their dinner was to avoid the Faye situation. The pair find themselves awkward with nothing to say until Harvey divulges that Donna reminds him of Ricky Garfield's mom. Harvey explains to a confused Donna that Ricky Garfield was a kid who had moved into the neighborhood when he was sixteen and that Harvey developed a crush on his mother, a redhead. Donna receives a phone call from Louis, intending to answer it as she promised she would be there for Louis, although Harvey responds that this dinner was meant for the two of them. Donna then elects not to answer the call and the two laugh after Harvey makes a joke, unaware that Louis is watching them.\n\nThe next night, Louis returns home for the night and is confused to hear Donna's laughter. He heads into the kitchen to find Donna and Sheila talking, with Donna attempting to convince Sheila to have Louis stay at the firm. Louis informs her that he has already chosen to remain at the firm, to which Donna replies by suggesting they have a girls' night, much to Louis' delight, who wishes to watch Dirty Dancing with her.[3]\n\nA week later, Donna Paulsen is making Harvey a cup of coffee at his apartment to discuss the fact that she is meeting her father, Jim Paulsen. for breakfast and wants Harvey to tag along so that they can share the news of their relationship together. Harvey points out that Jim isn't a fan of him as he had threatened Jim's livelihood in the past to prevent him from taking Donna's money, along with Jim accusing Harvey of putting Mike ahead of Donna, referencing when Anita Gibbs brought him in to pressure Donna into incriminating Harvey.\n\nDonna returns to the firm to find Faye waiting for her in her office. Faye tells Donna that she's aware that she and Harvey are in a relationship, and citing that 2 out of the 5 people in firm management being in a relationship causes them to have influence over the other and therefore tells Donna that she must give up her power to vote. Donna is aghast and asks why she must give her vote away and not Harvey, with Faye replying that it is because Harvey is a senior partner and a former managing partner. However, Faye offers to accept Harvey's vote in exchange for Donna's if the pair reach an agreement, stipulating that if they do not, she will choose who loses their vote.\n\nDonna then goes to the copy room where she is found by Harvey. Harvey notices that Donna is upset about something when Donna mentions giving up something important to her because of their relationship, although when Harvey inquires into it, Donna tells Harvey it is because of her father, adding that she can't be with someone who can't get along with her father and that Harvey never even told Lily, his mother. Harvey replies that he didn't think he had to, and before she leaves, Donna responds that it is because Lily was not an important part of Harvey's but that her father is.\n\nDonna confronts Faye in her office, not wanting to lose her vote, and explains to Harvey that the two not only influence each other, but balance the other out. However, when Faye replies that individual circumstances do not matter, Donna mentions mentions Faye's ex-husband, believing it is personal for Faye since she and her ex-husband had a conflict of interest at work, adding that she and Harvey aren't them. Faye is angered that Donna mentioned her ex-husband and replies that it isn't a negotiation and that the next day she would revoke one of their votes due to the conflict of interest.\n\nIn Harvey's office, Donna berates Harvey for insulting Jim and thinking he's better than her. Harvey immediately asks Donna what is wrong, stating that while he may have made a mistake with him, he knows that Donna knows that he doesn't think he is better than her. Donna then divulges the truth about Faye planning to revoke her voting power, maddening Harvey. As Harvey attempts to head to Faye's office to protest her actions, Louis walks in, notifying Harvey that he is going to talk to Faye about getting Gretchen back. Harvey tells him that Faye is trying to take Donna's vote away and that he would be talking to Faye right now; when Louis proposes that they go together as a united front, Harvey responds that they do not have enough leverage to demand more than one thing, and that Donna's vote trumps Louis gaining Gretchen back. Louis is angered that Harvey is placing his wants over his, only for Harvey to lash out that Faye's presence is Louis' fault for signing over the firm to her without putting up a fight. This causes Louis to angrily retort that Faye being Special Master is his fault since she only took over their firm due to Robert and Jessica's disbarment, both of which happened because of Harvey, the latter of which because he hired Mike knowing he was a fraud. Louis then storms up while Donna prevents Harvey from lashing out further, explaining that he and Louis got angry because they were insulted, which is exactly what Jim felt.\n\nIn her apartment the next night, Donna finishes leaving a voicemail for Rachel when Harvey walks in, telling her that he and her father were on good terms. Harvey then tells Donna if they are going to be in a relationship, she needs to trust him with the truth and if something is bothering her even if she doesn't want him to act on it. Donna then humorously asks what he means by if they were to be in a relationship, to which Harvey replies that they would be together forever. Donna jokingly takes that as a proposal and stumbles through her words when Harvey mentions that there would be no point officially proposing to her because whatever way he did it would not be the way she would want him to do it, and therefore it didn't matter. Donna then asks Harvey if they're engaged and it is Harvey's turn to stutter, although Lily calls him, saving him from the conversation. He answers the call and tells her that the Jim issue was resolved before putting the call on speakerphone and introducing Donna and Lily to each other. Harvey then attempts to end the call, only for Donna to take the phone and talk to Lily, while Harvey looks at her and smiles.[4]\n\nRelationships\n\nDonna is an excellent networker and was \"tied-in\" to the gossip and under-belly happenings of Pearson Hardman. Her network is extensive and runs through most of New York City. As a result, Donna is regarded somewhat warily by associates and partners alike. However, she is an excellent confidante and a great people person, which allows her to maintain relationships with people that Harvey cannot. She is social, fun, witty, and charming, and people enjoy interacting with her.\n\nHarvey Specter\n\nHarvey Specter is Donna's longtime boss, close friend and husband. Both trust each other implicitly. They first met at the District Attorney's office, where Harvey was Assistant District Attorney (ADA) and she was his secretary; they have been a team ever since. After working for two years at the DA's office, Harvey took Donna with him to Pearson Hardman.\n\nThe two are extremely close. Harvey loves her and trusts her absolutely. He relies upon her and views her as essential to his being. As he told Jessica in \"All In\", Donna is irreplaceable. Donna, in turn, adores Harvey and is incredibly loyal to him, to the point where she would take a bullet for him. Both tend to view each other as two halves to the same whole, and Donna has put Harvey above all other relationships more than once. They take great pleasure in each other's company and enjoy their jokes and verbal sparring. (They have a pre-trial ritual involving a can opener and thumbtacks.) Over the years, they have developed an ease of comfort found only between best friends, and are very good at reading the other. No one knows Harvey better than Donna, and although Harvey generally tends to keep his feelings close to the chest, he is more open and vulnerable with her than he is with anyone else. She is privy to most of the details of his private life--she knows about Harvey's mother and brother, and is fond of Harvey's father. (She is also the one who informed Harvey of his father's death.) Donna is also one of the few people whose opinion Harvey values, and he listens carefully to anything she tells him, even if he does not always acknowledge it at the time. When upset, Harvey sometimes falls back upon establishing the boss-employee boundary--a boundary Donna is smart enough to know when to ignore, recognizing it for the emotionally distancing tactic that it is. She is likely the only person capable of keeping his reckless tendencies in check. Harvey, meanwhile, is equally good at reading Donna, and although Harvey is not essential for the mechanics of Donna's life, she relies heavily upon his unswerving loyalty, devotion, and emotional support. Despite being protective of his privacy, Harvey has let Donna's parents stay at his condo before (after she cried fake tears--a fact he only finds out later), and Donna has the spare key to his condo.\n\nDonna is a gold mine of information for Harvey and listens in to all his conversations in his office (something Harvey does not discourage, since he leaves his intercom on for her). She is excellent at anticipating his needs, and takes great pride in being able to provide Harvey with what he needs without him asking for it. She views her job as to protect and take care of him, and will go to any lengths to do so. This was first proven in \"Rules of the Game\", where she gives Jessica incriminating evidence against Cameron Dennis after Dennis threatens Harvey, and again in \"Break Point\", when she shreds an incriminating memo that she fears will implicate him in a lawsuit.\n\nThe events in \"Break Point\" emotionally strain and confuse their relationship. Travis Tanner resurrects an old lawsuit against Harvey, accusing him of burying evidence and committing fraud. Harvey denies the accusations, stating that he never received the memorandum supposedly in his possession. Donna, however, finds the document in the file room with her date stamp on it. Afraid of the implications against Harvey and seeking to protect him, she hides the truth from him. Harvey nearly commits perjury as a result, and it is only Mike's quick actions that prevent him from doing so. After Mike informs Harvey that Donna found the document, Harvey storms into the ladies' room to confront her. A bitter argument ensues, during which Donna accuses Harvey of keeping things from her and she tells him that she shredded the memo. Feeling furious and betrayed, Harvey tells Donna: \"I'm not going to fire you, Donna--I might KILL you--but I'm not going to fire you.\"\n\nThis makes their relationship extremely tense. Both Harvey and Donna are used to being perfectly in sync with each other, and for the first time in a long time, they are out of step. It frightens and confuses Donna that she could have misread the situation (and Harvey) so badly. Harvey, on the other hand, is swamped by his feelings of fury, hurt, and betrayal, and can see little else. He is hurt and upset that she did not trust him enough to come to him with her problems, and a part of him is frightened that she would go to such lengths to protect him. He is afraid that this is something he cannot fix. These are two people who typically know what to do in any situation, and for the first time, both are at a loss. These feelings are further compounded when Jessica fires Donna--Donna feels hurt and betrayed that Harvey didn't fight for her the same way he fought for Mike, while Harvey is uncertain as to how to fight for Donna. His own personal credo of \"tough, but fair\" creates a conflict within him: on the one hand, he loves Donna and views her as essential to his being; on the other hand, her actions make her termination more than justified. Harvey is at a loss as to what to do, and he is lost without Donna.\n\nWhile Donna manages to go on with her now Harvey-free life in \"All In\" and \"Sucker Punch\", Harvey is incapable of moving on without her. His grief over her departure is so strong that he becomes incredibly reckless, and no one can hold him in check--not even Mike or Jessica. It is only at the end of the episode \"Rewind\" that Harvey informs Jessica in no uncertain terms that he's bringing Donna back, and it is only in \"Asterisk\" that the rift between Donna and Harvey is finally mended.\n\nWhile it is implied late in the first season and throughout the second season that Donna's feelings for Harvey may not be platonic, she informs him in \"Asterisk\" that she \"loves him like a brother or a cousin\" and that she is not in love with him. It is unclear if we can take Donna at her word, however, since she is also an excellent actress and has fooled Harvey before.\n\nDuring the episode \"The Other Time\" which is referenced in \"Asterisk\" it becomes clear during flashbacks that Harvey once tried to pursue Donna, but due to her policy of not mixing work with pleasure, she resisted his advances. However when both Donna and Harvey quit the DA's office Harvey visits Donna and she was already waiting for him with a can of whipped cream. Harvey steps into her apartment and she closes the door and he leaned over to kiss her. Although it's not seen, producer Aaron Korsh confimed in an interview that they slept together during this flashback. Afterwards when Harvey gets a new job at then Pearson Hardman, and he asks Donna to work with him to which she agrees on two conditions: a large signing bonus and never to speak of them sleeping together again. The episode also shows where their loose banter and can opener ritual originate from.\n\nAt the end of Season 4, after working for nearly 13 years together, Donna quits being Harvey's assistant and is now working for Louis. She decided this because her relationship with Harvey is not working for her. Louis also said to her in a conversation that Harvey is unaware how lucky he is to have Donna. Also Norma, Louis's own assistant, passed away. Before leaving she tells Harvey that she loves him.\n\nAfter Mike Ross is arrested in the middle of season 5, Louis fires Donna so that she could become Harvey's secretary again and help him help Mike.\n\nMike Ross\n\nDonna first mistook Mike Ross for Rick Sorkin during the associate interviews Harvey was conducting, and appreciated the witty response he gave her.\n\nDonna has a soft spot for Mike, and often treats him like a little brother. She enjoys teasing him and trading witty banter, but she's also good for a serious conversation when he needs it and occasionally gives him relationship advice. Although Mike is usually on the same page as Harvey in many things, Donna sometimes makes an excellent window between the two men.\n\nRachel Zane\n\nDonna and Rachel are very good friends. They enjoy each other's company and will go to different places together, such as the ballet or out for drinks. Both confide in each other often, whether it is about men or other problems. Donna once told Rachel that she used to have feelings for Harvey. Likewise, Rachel tells Donna about her kiss with Mike and the message she left him. In the episode \"Rewind\", it shows how they became friends. They are close and respect each other.\n\nLouis Litt\n\nLouis is a recently appointed name partner alongside Jessica Pearson and Harvey Specter at Pearson Specter Litt. Louis genuinely likes Donna and finds her beautiful-- he also constantly hopes to steal her away from Harvey Specter. Donna, however, does not return Louis' high regard. She takes great amusement in teasing him (much like Harvey does), and does not trust him. This is because she finds Louis unreliable--his penchant for deviousness and cunning make him untrustworthy.\n\nDespite this, she occasionally enjoys Louis' company. When Louis was looking for a pet cat, she gave Louis her opinion on his profile and helped him search for his future pet online. Both share a love for the theatre, and Louis is constantly trying to bribe Donna with tickets to plays, concerts, etc. in exchange for information or company. They occasionally act out scenes from Shakespeare's plays late at night near the fax machine at Pearson Hardman.\n\nNorma\n\nNorma is Louis' long-suffering legal secretary. Although we never see Norma, these two women seem to be thick as thieves when it comes to gossip. Norma does not seem to be as well-connected as Donna is, but she always gives Donna the latest scoop on Louis' shenanigans. Both Louis and Harvey are creeped out by Norma, which amuses and exasperates Donna to no end.\n\nTrivia\n\nShe is from Cortland, New York. However, she moved to Hartford, Connecticut after her father gambled the family money away.\n\nDonna's grandmother used to own a Maine Coon cat.\n\nDonna has a Bachelor's in Theatre and worked as a part-time waitress and part-time actress before becoming a legal secretary.\n\nDonna is always listening to Harvey's private conversations through the intercom.\n\nShe and Harvey have a pre-trial ritual that involves a can-opener and thumbtacks.\n\nDonna is an excellent actress who \"embodies\" her character.\n\nDonna claims she does not need words to communicate.\n\nDonna likes to play with Raoul from Accounting on Tuesdays when she's bored.\n\nDonna loves Halloween and asks Harvey for Halloween off every July with a sheepish look on her face.\n\nDonna tricked Harvey into letting her parents stay at his condo by faking tears.\n\nDonna's abilities to fake tears include tracking the Demi Moore single tear from either her left eye or her right.\n\nDonna considers herself a \"fax whisperer\", due to her ability to fix the fax machine when it is broken or jammed.\n\nShe once said she had access to Harvey's bank accounts.\n\nAppearances\n\nSuits, Season 1 #01 \"Pilot\" #07 \"Play the Man\" #02 \"Errors and Omissions\" #08 \"Identity Crisis\" #03 \"Inside Track\" #09 \"Undefeated\" #04 \"Dirty Little Secrets\" #10 \"The Shelf Life\" #05 \"Bail Out\" #11 \"Rules of the Game\" #06 \"Tricks of the Trade\" #12 \"Dog Fight\"\n\nSuits, Season 2 #01 \"She Knows\" #09 \"Asterisk\" #02 \"The Choice\" #10 \"High Noon\" #03 \"Meet the New Boss\" #11 \"Blind-Sided\" #04 \"Discovery\" #12 \"Blood in the Water\" #05 \"Break Point\" #13 \"Zane vs. Zane\" #06 \"All In\" #14 \"He's Back\" #07 \"Sucker Punch\" #15 \"Normandy\" #08 \"Rewind\" #16 \"War\"\n\nSuits, Season 3 #01 \"The Arrangement\" #09 \"Bad Faith\" #02 \"I Want You to Want Me\" #10 \"Stay\" #03 \"Unfinished Business\" #11 \"Buried Secrets\" #04 \"Conflict of Interest\" #12 \"Yesterday's Gone\" #05 \"Shadow of a Doubt\" #13 \"Moot Point\" #06 \"The Other Time\" #14 \"Heartburn\" #07 \"She's Mine\" #15 \"Know When to Fold 'Em\" #08 \"Endgame\" #16 \"No Way Out\"\n\nSuits, Season 4 #01 \"One-Two-Three Go...\" #09 \"Gone\" #02 \"Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner\" #10 \"This Is Rome\" #03 \"Two in the Knees\" #11 \"Enough Is Enough\" #04 \"Leveraged\" #12 \"Respect\" #05 \"Pound of Flesh\" #13 \"Fork in the Road\" #06 \"Litt the Hell Up\" #14 \"Derailed\" #07 \"We're Done\" #15 \"Intent\" #08 \"Exposure\" #16 \"Not Just a Pretty Face\"\n\nSuits, Season 5 #01 \"Denial\" #09 \"Uninvited Guests\" #02 \"Compensation\" #10 \"Faith\" #03 \"No Refills\" #11 \"Blowback\" #04 \"No Puedo Hacerlo\" #12 \"Live to Fight\" #05 \"Toe to Toe\" #13 \"God's Green Earth\" #06 \"Privilege\" #14 \"Self Defense\" #07 \"Hitting Home\" #15 \"Tick Tock\" #08 \"Mea Culpa\" #16 \"25th Hour\"\n\nSuits, Season 6 #01 \"To Trouble\" #09 \"The Hand That Feeds You\" #02 \"Accounts Payable\" #10 \"P.S.L.\" #03 \"Back on the Map\" #11 \"She's Gone\" #04 \"Turn\" #12 \"The Painting\" #05 \"Trust\" #13 \"Teeth, Nose, Teeth\" #06 \"Spain\" #14 \"Admission of Guilt\" #07 \"Shake the Trees\" #15 \"Quid Pro Quo\" #08 \"Borrowed Time\" #16 \"Character and Fitness\"\n\nSuits, Season 7 #01 \"Skin in the Game\" #09 \"Shame\" #02 \"The Statue\" #10 \"Donna\" #03 \"Mudmare\" #11 \"Hard Truths\" #04 \"Divide and Conquer\" #12 \"Bad Man\" #05 \"Brooklyn Housing\" #13 \"Inevitable\" #06 \"Home to Roost\" #14 \"Pulling the Goalie\" #07 \"Full Disclosure\" #15 \"Tiny Violin\" #08 \"100\" #16 \"Good-Bye\"\n\nSuits, Season 8 #01 \"Right-Hand Man\" #09 \"Motion to Delay\" #02 \"Pecking Order\" #10 \"Managing Partner\" #03 \"Promises, Promises\" #11 \"Rocky 8\" #04 \"Revenue Per Square Foot\" #12 \"Whale Hunt\" #05 \"Good Mudding\" #13 \"The Greater Good\" #06 \"Cats, Ballet, Harvey Specter\" #14 \"Peas in a Pod\" #07 \"Sour Grapes\" #15 \"Stalking Horse\" #08 \"Coral Gables\" #16 \"Harvey\"\n\nSuits, Season 9 #01 \"Everything's Changed\" #06 \"Whatever It Takes\" #02 \"Special Master\" #07 \"Scenic Route\" #03 \"Windmills\" #08 \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" #04 \"Cairo\" #09 \"Thunder Away\" #05 \"If the Shoe Fits\" #10 \"One Last Con\""
