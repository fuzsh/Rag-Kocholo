        "text": "The Blitz spirit has come to stand for all sorts of displays of resilience in the face of adversity, but there’s surely only one instance when it has meant taking your clothes off. At Soho’s Windmill Theatre during the Second World War, the girls who performed nightly, nude tableaux continued to do so despite — or perhaps even because of — the bombs raining down around them. The Windmill was the only West End theatre to remain open during the war.\n\nThis new musical, based on the 2005 Judi Dench film, is an unashamedly nostalgic celebration of that plucky wartime spirit, even if a girl baring her bosoms can’t help but feel like a somewhat mixed- up statement of defiance against the Luftwaffe. Still, (and as a canny producer has no doubt worked out), if patriotic nudity worked for the Windmill in 1940, there’s a chance it will work for today’s audiences, too.\n\nDirector Terry Johnson takes palpable delight in the real-life story of Mrs Henderson, who bought the Windmill in 1930 and, despite knowing almost nothing about the industry, turned it into a ragingly successful, non-stop revue theatre with the help of her Dutch Jewish manager, Vivian Van Damm. Her introduction of naked tableaux (whereby the girls emulated the nude sculptures to be found at the National Gallery) was designed to get round the era’s strict censorship rules, but here Johnson seizes on it as a perfect demonstration of that singular British mix of smut and coyness when it comes to attitudes towards sex.\n\nThe nudge-nudge, Vaudevillian jokes about bishops and actresses by the Windmill’s warm-up act Arthur (Mark Hadfield) are fine, but getting knocked up by a colleague — as happens to the Windmill’s star turn Maureen — is not.\n\nDon Black’s lyrics, combined with George Fenton and Simon Chamberlain’s gaudy score, are sometimes witty, sometimes syrupy. Yet they capture well the chirpy determination of the crew and cast of The Windmill — and go all out in the second half, when the mood darkens and the devastating impact of the war is fully felt.\n\nJohnson’s cast, in turn, show impressive commitment to a production that often feels like a horribly blunt instrument. Tracie Bennett may not have Dench’s commanding, peppery gleam but she wisely resists making the indomitable Mrs Henderson a caricature, while Ian Bartholomew exudes doughty sincerity as the emotionally conflicted Vivian.\n\nThis is not a subtle evening by any means, but with its mix of wholesome sauce and home fires burning, it’s definitely a stirring one."
