        "text": "By Anna McKeon from the Better Care Network\n\nBack in 2010, I was fed up with living in the United Kingdom.\n\nI wanted an adventure. I wanted to do something more socially orientated – something “worthwhile.”\n\nI did a bit of research and talked to some friends, and ended up finding out about an organization that ran orphanages and educational centers in Kenya, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nThey were looking for Co-Directors, long-stay volunteers who would run one of their centers for at least a year.\n\nThere was no salary, but accommodation and food were provided – and, so the conversation went – you would get first-hand experience running a small non-profit and volunteering at an orphanage.\n\n“This sounds perfect!” I thought.\n\nThe opportunity fit my budget, timeframe, the kind of commitment I wanted to give, and the things I wanted to learn.\n\nMy friends were amazed at what I was doing.\n\n“You’re so brave” was something I heard often.\n\nThe only person who questioned my choice was my Dad. “What skills do you have to be the Co-Director of an orphanage, Anna?”\n\nI shrugged his question off.\n\nI had a lot of great transferable skills. They just needed someone smart and motivated.\n\nAnd I wasn’t prepared to let a small matter of relevant experience stand in the way of my life plans.\n\nSo, I got on a plane and went to Kenya.\n\nA white 29-year-old British girl with no qualifications in child care, child development or international development.\n\nI had no knowledge of Kenya, no knowledge of any languages spoken there, no understanding of the culture.\n\nThe only vaguely relevant experience I had was a one-week teaching-English-as-a-foreign language certificate I had gained 10 years previously.\n\nAnd somehow, I thought this was a good idea.\n\nThe Problem With Orphanage Volunteering\n\nAs you may have guessed this is a cautionary tale. I was completely, completely unprepared for just how bad an idea it really was.\n\nI spent a month in Kenya before I was transferred to another orphanage in Thailand where I spent a further five months.\n\nAlthough I was supposed to be there a year, I left halfway through.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause during the experience I realized I was so under-qualified and unprepared that my best and most responsible recourse was to leave.\n\nI did, however, learn a huge amount in that short time.\n\nTo ensure you don’t make the same mistakes I did volunteering at an orphanage, I’d like to share some of these with you.\n\nHere are the top five lessons that I learned…the hard way.\n\n1. As a volunteer, you MUST have appropriate skills.\n\nIf you don’t, at best, you’ll be pretty useless, and at worst you could be putting yourself and others at risk.\n\nI discovered this when I was faced with a situation where one of the older boys at the orphanage was threatening one of the younger girls with a hunting knife.\n\nShe had accused him of coming into her room at night and sexually assaulting her.\n\nI had no idea how to handle the situation.\n\nThis incident made me wonder what on earth I was doing there. The children didn’t need me. They needed trained staff and social workers who spoke their language.\n\nThere is no place for unskilled volunteers in working with vulnerable children.\n\nThere is no place for unskilled volunteers in working with vulnerable children. #StopOrphanTrips Share on X\n\n2. As a volunteer, you have a responsibility to think of the long-term impact of your actions.\n\nIt’s not just about you.\n\nOnce you complete a project you go back to your home country and your real life, while the children and communities you have engaged with stay put.\n\nI didn’t think about this when I left the UK.\n\nI was so wrapped up in what the experience would be providing me that I didn’t even consider the impact I would have on the children I would be working with.\n\nAs it happened, the children were really sad when I left.\n\nSome were even angry because volunteers tend to make promises they don’t keep like staying in touch or coming back to visit.\n\nI had promised to stay in Kenya for a year and left after a month.\n\nVulnerable children shouldn’t have to deal with that kind of disruption in their lives.\n\n3. You need to find out what you don’t know before you go.\n\nSometimes you don’t know what you don’t know.\n\nThere are many things I knew I didn’t understand when I went to Kenya — such as language and culture — but I was prepared for that and interested in learning; however, there were other things I hadn’t considered, mainly to do with the social and economic causes of why children end up in orphanages and why that’s a problem.\n\nAlso to be considered is why those things meant it was even more of a bad idea for me to be doing what I was doing.\n\nWhat I didn’t know then that I know now is that orphanages should never be a long-term solution for children.\n\nThere is over 60 years of research that demonstrates that growing up in residential care such as orphanages can be harmful to children’s health, development and life chances.\n\nSo orphanages also shouldn’t be used as a solution to larger social issues such as poverty or access to education.\n\nMost of the children at the orphanages I worked at had parents, or some living family members (as is the global norm).\n\nThey were there because they came from marginalized communities. I witnessed two children being separated from their father to come and live in the orphanage so they could go to a better school in the city.\n\nWhile I am a big believer in education, I also believe that a child should have a right to live in a family and have access to education.\n\nThe trauma that I witnessed those children go through in being separated from their parent(s) was real and distressing.\n\nSeparating children from their families should not have to be the only solution for them to be able to access better life chances.\n\nThe more you support orphanages, the more you support this as a solution to challenges facing marginalized communities. We can — and should — do better.\n\nInstead, support organizations who provide rural education, income generation for families, foster care, or provision of social workers.\n\nI pictured what #volunteering would do for me; I forgot to think about those I was helping. Share on X\n\n4. Volunteers can undermine local initiatives for change.\n\nIn the context of the orphanages I worked with, this was very apparent.\n\nThe founder didn’t trust local staff as she thought they would steal from her, hence it was only foreign volunteers who could be in charge of finances and key decision making.\n\nThe children had few role models within their own community to look up to.\n\nOn a larger scale, and what child protection experts are concerned about in many countries around the world, is that volunteers make orphanages look like an attractive option for families.\n\nVolunteers bring money and resources and are often assumed to be well-educated.\n\nTherefore, they are more likely to send their children to orphanages.\n\n5. It doesn’t make sense to support badly-run organizations.\n\nIt’s very common to read volunteer stories where they visit an orphanage and find it half-built, with children in dirty clothes with little food.\n\nThey are moved to help such organizations because they are more “in need.”\n\nThis is an understandable response but actually doesn’t make sense in the long-run.\n\nThe organization I worked for was badly run, and as a result, there wasn’t enough money to give the children nutritious meals or pay for school supplies.\n\nI felt compelled to work 16 hours a day for six months to try and see how things could be improved.\n\nRealistically, I shouldn’t have been working with that organization at all. It would have been much better to give my time and money to a well-run organization that might have been able to give those children better support services.\n\nIn addition, badly run organizations can put people at risk. I saw this both with the children (see Point 1) and with the volunteers.\n\nShortly after I left Kenya all the volunteers at the orphanage were arrested because they were volunteering on the wrong visa.\n\nThey spent a night in jail, had to pay a fine and were then deported.\n\nThe organization did nothing to step in to support these volunteers during that time.\n\n#StopOrphanTrips: volunteers make orphanages look like an attractive option for families. Share on X\n\nWorking For Positive Change\n\nAll of this (and more) is why I am so grateful for the opportunity to work with the Better Care Network and Save the Children UK to support their initiative to discourage volunteering in orphanages.\n\nBetter Volunteering Better Care began in 2014, and is a global movement working with advocates from a range of backgrounds and sectors to raise awareness of these issues.\n\nBetter Volunteering Better Care also seeks to support positive alternatives to orphanage volunteering, as there are lots of (better) ways to support positive change.\n\nFor ideas on responsible volunteering abroad, check out this advice from Next Generation Nepal – an organization working with vulnerable children in Nepal.\n\nWatch these videos from Learning Service and read up on these articles on Globalsl.org.\n\nTo learn more about how to support vulnerable children and families, explore the work of the ChildSafe movement, discover Kinnected’s work in Australia and find out about what Alternative Care Uganda are trying to achieve.\n\nIt’s a little weird to be campaigning to stop people doing something you once did yourself.\n\nSome of my friends have tried to reassure me about my experiences, telling me that “it worked out in the end” and “now you’re trying to put things right.”\n\nTo be frank, I don’t think it works that way.\n\nVulnerable children and communities shouldn’t have been put at risk just so that I could learn a few lessons and start making better choices with my good intentions.\n\nAnd it didn’t really work out in the end – the children I worked with are still in the orphanages, with volunteers still arriving all the time.\n\nI’m no closer to changing that situation than I was five years ago.\n\nWhat I do hope can change, is that more people become aware of the problems with orphanage volunteering before they make the decision to book a trip abroad.\n\nWe’re also calling on volunteer travel organizations to stop offering orphanage placements as part of their product offerings.\n\nWant to help #StopOrphanTrips?
