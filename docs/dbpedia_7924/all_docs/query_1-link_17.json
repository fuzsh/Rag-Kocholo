        "text": "Not really a film so much as an all-singing, all-dancing, all-badly-acting Franklin Mint figurine, as advertised on the back of the Sunday mags. Naughty-But-Nice Nude Showgirl, face lightly smudged with smokey soot, defies Herr Hitler in the show that never closes: Â£19.95, plus P& P - price includes display-setting of picturesque 1940s bomb damage.\n\nLike the Queen Mum touring London's war-torn East End, Judi Dench stars in an insidiously ghastly piece of Blitz-kitsch nostalgia, reeking with chirpiness. She plays Laura Henderson, the real-life rich widow who in 1931 bought the Windmill theatre in London's Soho and, with the help of shrewd professional manager Vivian Van Damm (Bob Hoskins), turned it into a saucy revue in the style of the Parisian Moulin Rouge; the Lord Chamberlain (Christopher Guest) decreed that female nudes were acceptable as long as they did not move, and despite the Luftwaffe, the morale-boosting Windmill never closed.\n\nAll I can say is: come friendly bombs and fall on our native film industry now. London, musical theatre and the war here all look as if they have been conceived by Dennis Potter with a lobotomy. The sentimentalism is icky, the dialogue porridgy and the actors quite often move and speak as if wearing invisible deep-sea diving suits. Poor Bob Hoskins, for some reason, has to use a quasi-posh voice and is the most uncomfortable and unrelaxed I can ever remember seeing him. As the executive producer, however, he has only himself to blame, although I am surprised to see Stephen Frears directing something so tinny.\n\nJudi Dench gives an over-mannered, over-wrought performance on one single note. My dear! She's exasperating! Capricious! Impossible! Yet with her adorable patrician directness and worldly sang-froid she cuts through any amount of hypocrisy and red-tape! Sharply, Mrs Henderson guesses that Van Damm is one of the \"Jewish people\". Van Damm curtly denies it, yet when he has to undress to encourage his bashful Windmill gels to strip off, and gives Mrs Henderson (and us) a flash of full-frontal nudity, she purrs: \"Mr Van Damm - you are Jewish!\" Later we are to see Van Damm privately in tears at headlines about Hitler rounding up Jews in occupied Holland. That would appear to clinch it.\n\nAs for the theatre's other decently reticent minority, pop star Will Young plays a singer, who on being asked by Mrs Henderson if he finds any of the auditioning showgirls attractive, smilingly confides that his tastes do not run thus. This heterodoxy is not however dramatised in any way, and Young merely croons sub-Boyfriend ditties like Christopher Gable's irritating younger brother.\n\nThis film really is chock-a-block with terrible moments, but the worst has to be when Mrs H, addressing a cheering crowd of Tommies, declares that she opened up the theatre because she once found a \"French postcard\" belonging to her late son, killed in 1915. It was the only female flesh he'd ever seen, poor fellow - so she's made it her mission to let the chaps in khaki get an eyeful of the real thing before their end comes. And this speech comes after she's charitably arranged for some Other Ranks type in the audience to get his end away courtesy of her most golden-hearted girl, who then gets sacrificially killed by a bomb. The sheer misjudged awfulness of invoking the fallen of the Great War in support of cheerful smut, the vulgarly ersatz compassion among heritage-style suffering on the Home Front - it made me want to burn my ration card. Keep Smiling London and Keep Your Chin Up, says one poster. This film isn't making that task any easier."
