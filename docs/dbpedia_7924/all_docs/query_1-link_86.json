        "text": "The actress, 78, who has returned to her role in EastEnders, was at the Noel Coward Theatre in London's West End and later joined dancers from the show.\n\nBased on the 2005 film, the true story of London's first legal nude show is set against the backdrop of the Second World War at Soho's Windmill Theatre.\n\nBut while Barbara looks in the pink, her soap character Peggy Mitchell is set to be killed off soon.\n\nExecutive producer of the hit BBC show, Dominic Treadwell-Collins has promised Peggy will leave the long-running soap \"in style\".\n\nSpeaking about his plans for Barbara's exit, Dominic said: \"Barbara is the real guvnor of EastEnders.\n\n\"So when she told me her decision [to leave] back in the summer, we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square.\""
