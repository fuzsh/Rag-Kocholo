        "text": "Bangor University’s neo-gothic main University building provided some of the ‘moody’ exterior for the filming of a new TV series to be broadcast on the Living channel in early 2011.\n\nSinger and actor Will Young is among the actors in ‘Bedlam’, described by the production company as ‘a six-part drama series’ and was in Bangor for the filming.\n\nFilming took place at certain external locations at the University over two days. The exterior shots of the University will be added to other similar locations to create the fictitious ‘Bedlam Heights’ a converted apartment block where the drama takes place.\n\nA spokesperson for the University said; “The filming took place mainly at dusk and at night, and I believe the filming went well. The University was able to cater for the television crew without too much disruption and I believe the crew were impressed by the location. A large number of the crew stayed overnight at the University’s Management Centre.”\n\nFull production company release:\n\nLIVING COMMISSIONS FIRST SCRIPTED DRAMA SERIES FOR 2011 LINE-UP\n\n“BEDLAM” (6x60’)\n\nWill Young, Theo James, Charlotte Salt and Ashley Madekwe to star in contemporary ghostly drama\n\nLONDON (August 16 2010) LIVING, part of the LIVING TV Group, today announced its first foray into scripted drama with its own glossy, haunting six-part drama series – Bedlam. The sexy, ghostly series will star singer and actor Will Young (Mrs Henderson Presents, Skins), Theo James (A Passionate Woman), Charlotte Salt (The Tudors) and Ashley Madekwe (Secret Diary of a Call Girl). Bedlam is produced by Red Production Company (Worried About the Boy, New Street Law, Casanova, Queer As Folk), and will air on LIVING in early 2011.\n\nThe contemporary paranormal series, written and created by Neil Jones, David Allison and Chris Parker, is set around Bedlam Heights – an apartment block converted from a pre-Victorian lunatic asylum and its inhabitants. But the conversion of Bedlam Heights awakens a darker side of the building, with former asylum spirits coming back to take back what they believe to be theirs and seek revenge on those who have wronged them – targeting one set of flat sharers in particular. The terrifying hauntings that follow reveal that sometimes when you scratch away the surface, things aren’t always what they seem.\n\nKate (Charlotte Salt) lives in Bedlam Heights and flat shares with Ryan (Will Young) and Molly (Ashley Madekwe). Kate’s father owns the old family property Bedlam Heights and is renovating the former asylum into flats, with the help of protégé Kate. Kate is overly self-confident but ultimately self-destructive, and is surprised by the appearance of her adopted cousin, Jed (Theo James), who arrives unexpectedly. Jed is unique. Having a history of mental illness, Jed in reality is a troubled man who sees visions of the dead, the past and ghosts. He is sent messages to “Save Kate”, propelling him back into Kate’s life. Gradually Jed uncovers the terrifying secrets held in Bedlam Heights, whilst trying to retain his sanity.\n\nClaudia Rosencrantz, Director of Television, LIVING TV Group said: “We’ve been searching for ages for the right idea to launch LIVING into original drama, and Bedlam is the perfect fit. It’s sexy, stylish and truly scary. It is about very frightening things happening to very beautiful people!”\n\nNicola Shindler, Executive Producer, Red Production Company: “I am very excited to be working on LIVING’s first drama commission. Bedlam is a passion project for Red and we are working towards a modern and original horror series. With thrilling and provocative scripts, ambitious casting and hugely talented directors, we want to make Bedlam sit alongside LIVING’s glossy, assured US imported drama but still have a distinctly British voice.”\n\nTheo James said: “The first episode of the script immediately drew me in. It's a refreshing and exciting take on the genre and I'm really excited to be involved in this brilliant new project. Jed is a complex and dynamic character with a dark and complicated history.”\n\nWill Young said: \"I'm so excited to be part of Bedlam, the scripts are fantastic and original, as are the other actors involved and I can't wait to get my teeth into the role of Ryan.\"\n\nCharlotte Salt said: “I was instantly drawn to this project due to its high energy and originality and I couldn't be more excited to throw myself into the character and her relationships, immersing myself into the dark chilling world of Bedlam...\"\n\nAshley Madekwe said: “I love anything suspense filled and spooky, so I knew I was going to enjoy the scripts before I'd even begun reading. I love being scared by things I watch, so am excited to be part of Bedlam and have my chance to help frighten others!”\n\nBedlam was commissioned by Claudia Rosencrantz. It will be overseen by Head of Commissioning Mark Sammon and former ITV Head of Drama Jenny Reeks, who is consulting for LIVING and who worked on script development with Head of Acquisitions Amy Barham.\n\nCredits for Red Production Company:\n\nExecutive Producer - Nicola Shindler\n\nProducer - Matthew Bird\n\nDirector - John Strickland\n\nDirector - Alrick Riley\n\nProduction Designer - Martyn John\n\nDirector of Photography - Jono Smith\n\nCostume Designer - Theresa Rymer\n\nMake Up - Jessica Taylor\n\nPublication date: 21 September 2010"
