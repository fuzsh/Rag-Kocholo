(Updated May, 2020)\n\nThe Mission of the Department of Nursing at Henderson State University is to prepare baccalaureate and graduate level nurses by providing a professional nursing education in a caring environment.\n\nThe mission of the Henderson State University Undergraduate Nursing Program is to provide both a liberal and professional nursing education to produce safe, generalist nurses. Graduates of this program will demonstrate an understanding of theory as it relates to nursing practice. This program prepares professional nurses to pursue higher education.\n\nThe goals of the four year (8 semester) program leading to the Generic Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree are:\n\n1. Prepare a professional nurse generalist.\n\n2. Educate nurses in holistic concepts of humanity, environment, and health.\n\n3. Prepare a professional nurse who recognizes and uses resources for nursing and health care in the community.\n\n4. Prepare professional nurses who understand the role of research and theory to improve nursing and health care.\n\n5. Provide a foundation for advanced study of nursing.\n\nThe corresponding Student Learning Outcomes for the Generic BSN program are:\n\n1. Demonstrate responsibility and accountability in the role of the professional nurse.\n\n2. Use clinical reasoning to make decisions regarding nursing care.\n\n3. Manage resources necessary to promote and maintain conditions for optimum health.\n\n4. Apply findings from nursing and healthcare research when planning nursing and health care.\n\n5. Select concepts of professional nursing necessary for effective and efficient client care delivery.\n\nAccreditation\n\nThe baccalaureate degree program in nursing at Henderson State University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education http://www.ccneaccreditation.org and approved by the Arkansas State Board of Nursing (ASBON).\n\nProgram Admission for the Generic BSN\n\nStudents admitted to the university declaring a major in Health Science become Academic Advisees. Students become Nursing Majors upon completing prerequisite non-nursing courses and after being admitted into the nursing program. The admission application is available on the Department of Nursing web page.\n\nStudents will be admitted to the Nursing Program in the Spring semester. Students must complete all of the prerequisite science and math courses with a “C” or better and maintain a minimum nursing GPA of 2.70 for admission consideration. Program applications are due February 1st for Fall semester start. Program acceptance is competitive based on Nursing GPA and record of success in prerequisite courses and selective pre-admission assessment tests. Program admissions are provisional pending satisfactory completion of a criminal background check and drug screen. Program admission costs are charged upon acceptance to the program to cover admission processing.\n\nShould a student be absent from the program for more than a semester, a Readmission Application must be submitted using the same schedule as for program admission. Readmission is not assured and is on a space available basis.\n\nStudents holding licensure (LPN/LPTN or RN) in nursing may qualify for advanced placement in the BSN program. Students holding licenses to practice nursing in Arkansas must maintain these as valid and in good standing to retain their status in nursing courses (NSG prefix).\n\nStudents may repeat a maximum of two 3000 or 4000 level nursing courses, one time each. Failure or withdrawing from an additional course will result in permanent removal from the program.\n\nNursing Clinical Course Health and Safety Requirements\n\nClinical nursing courses can result in exposure to infectious illnesses, injuries, or related accidents. Because of this, students are strongly urged to maintain adequate health care coverage and disability insurance. Additionally, in order to meet clinical agency requirements, students must provide evidence of the following upon admission to the program/prior to starting clinical courses (date deadline TBA).\n\nNegative Tuberculin skin test or independent provider’s statement of the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of Tuberculosis in positive reactors\n\n3-shot Hepatitis B series or acceptable titer\n\nProof of Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) immunizations\n\nVaricella immunizations (2 doses) or Positive Titer\n\nInfluenza immunization at beginning of flu season (date to be determined)\n\nProof of Tetanus (Td/Tdap) within past 10 years\n\nAmerican Heart Association CPR for Healthcare Providers\n\nPhysical Examination signed by Healthcare Provider\n\nAdditional documentation required include:\n\nCriminal Background Checks\n\nDrug Testing\n\nChild Maltreatment Training\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, Implications for Nursing Majors\n\nStudents with documented disabilities who are applying for admission to Henderson and to the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program will be welcome according to the guidelines of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990. Reasonable accommodations will be made for students who have a documented disability but who have the abilities to assume the role of the professional nurse. These abilities include verbal and written communication, critical thinking, nursing assessment of physical and psychosocial health status of clients, and performance of nursing procedures including cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Students with disabilities will be evaluated on an individual basis by the faculty of the Department of Nursing as to their potential for success in a career in professional nursing after admission to the program.\n\nStandardized Testing and the RN Licensure Exam for the Generic BSN\n\nStandardized testing constitutes a portion of all clinical specialty courses. In courses where standardized tests are administered, tests will account for no more than 5 - 10% of the total course grade. Nursing course fees pay for standardized tests. Students must reach the expected benchmark by their second (third if applicable) attempt. Failure to do so will result in an automatic failure in the course, regardless of other didactic grades.\n\nAll students in their last semester in the Traditional BSN Nursing Program, in NSG 4709 Adult Nursing III, must take a comprehensive standardized test to determine their readiness and ability to pass the NCLEX-RN examination. Students will be accorded two chances to achieve a passing score on the comprehensive standardized tests. Students who fail to meet the passing score will be awarded an Incomplete (I) grade until the passing score has been achieved.\n\nStudents who fail to pass the comprehensive standardized test on second attempt will be assessed additional fees to cover tests and proctors.\n\nNursing Prerequisite Courses for the Traditional (pre-licensure) BSN\n\nIn addition to the required General Education Core Courses, the following courses are required prior to admission to the Nursing Program:\n\nMajor Requirements for the Generic Bachelor of Science Degree in Nursing\n\nRN TO BSN ONLINE PROGRAM\n\nThe online program offers associate degree nurses a seamless academic transition toward earning their baccalaureate nursing degree from an accredited institution. This online program builds on a foundation of competencies attained by the registered nurse and also offers a strong focus in leadership and management, evidence-based research, nursing theory, gerontology and palliative care, health assessment, and community health.

Through collaborative efforts, the partners desire to provide an integrated course path which facilitates the seamless transition of NPC associate degree registered nurses to the HSU baccalaureate degree program.
