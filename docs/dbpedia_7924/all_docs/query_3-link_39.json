        "text": "http://english.columbia.edu/\n\nDepartmental Office: 602 Philosophy; 212-854-3215\n\nhttp://www.english.columbia.edu\n\nDirector of Undergraduate Studies: Prof. Nicholas Dames, 603 Philosophy; 212-854-4016; nicholas.dames@columbia.edu\n\nThe program in English fosters the ability to read critically and imaginatively, to appreciate the power of language to shape thought and represent the world, and to be sensitive to the ways in which literature is created and achieves its effects. It has several points of departure, grounding the teaching of critical reading in focused attention to the most significant works of English literature, in the study of the historical and social conditions surrounding literary production and reception, and in theoretical reflection on the process of writing and reading and the nature of the literary work.\n\nThe courses the department offers draw on a broad range of methodologies and theoretical approaches, from the formalist to the political to the psychoanalytical (to mention just a few). Ranging from the medieval period to the 21st century, the department teaches major authors alongside popular culture, traditional literary genres alongside verbal forms that cut across media, and canonical British literature alongside postcolonial, global, and trans-Atlantic literatures.\n\nAt once recognizing traditional values in the discipline and reflecting its changing shape, the major points to three organizing principles for the study of literature—history, genre, and geography. Requiring students not only to take a wide variety of courses but also to arrange their thinking about literature on these very different grids, the major gives them broad exposure to the study of the past, an understanding of the range of forms that can shape literary meaning, and an encounter with the various geographical landscapes against which literature in English has been produced.\n\nAdvising\n\nStudents are not assigned specific advisers, but rather each year the faculty members serving on the department’s Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE) are designated undergraduate advisers (see above). Upon declaring a major or concentration in English, students should meet with the director of undergraduate studies or a delegated faculty adviser to discuss the program, especially to ensure that students understand the requirements.\n\nStudents must fill out a Major Requirements Worksheet early in the semester preceding graduation. The worksheet must be reviewed by an adviser and submitted to 602 Philosophy before the registration period for the final semester. The worksheet is available in the English Department or on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/English%20Major%20Worksheet%20Template%20(04%20January%202024).pdf. It is this worksheet—not the Degree Audit Report (DAR)—that determines eligibility for graduation as an English major or concentrator.\n\nCourse Information\n\nLectures\n\nGenerally, lectures are addressed to a broad audience and do not assume previous course work in the area, unless prerequisites are noted in the description. The size of some lectures is limited. Senior majors have preference unless otherwise noted, followed by junior majors, followed by senior and junior non-majors. Students are responsible for checking for any special registration procedures on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings.\n\nSeminars\n\nThe department regards seminars as opportunities for students to do advanced undergraduate work in fields in which they have already had some related course experience. With the exception of some CLEN classes (in which, as comparative courses, much material is read in translation), students’ admission to a seminar presupposes their having taken ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study. During the three weeks preceding the registration period, students should check https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings for application instructions for individual seminars. Applications to seminars are usually due by the end of the week preceding registration. Students should always assume that the instructor’s permission is necessary; those who register without having secured the instructor’s permission are not guaranteed admission.\n\nDepartmental Honors\n\nWriting a senior essay is a precondition, though not a guarantee, for the possible granting of departmental honors. After essays are submitted, faculty sponsors deliver a written report on the essay to the department’s Committee on Undergraduate Education (CUE), with a grade for the independent study and, if merited, a recommendation for honors. CUE considers all the essays, including sponsor recommendations, reviews students’ fall semester grades, and determines which students are to receive departmental honors. Normally no more than 10% of graduating majors receive departmental honors in a given academic year.\n\nThe Degree Audit Reporting System (DARS)\n\nThe DAR is a useful tool for students to monitor their progress toward degree requirements, but it is not an official document for the major or concentration, nor should it replace consultation with departmental advisers. The department’s director of undergraduate studies is the final authority on whether requirements for the major have been met. Furthermore, the DAR may be inaccurate or incomplete for any number of reasons—for example, courses taken elsewhere and approved for credit do not show up on the DAR report as fulfilling a specific requirement.\n\nOnline Information\n\nOther departmental information—faculty office hours, registration instructions, late changes, etc.—is available on the departmental website.\n\nGuidelines for all English and Comparative Literature Majors and Concentrators\n\nDeclaring a Major in English\n\nUpon declaring a major in English, students should meet with either the director of undergraduate studies or a departmental adviser to discuss the program. Students declaring a major should obtain a Major Requirements Worksheet from 602 Philosophy or on-line, which outlines the requirements.\n\nAdditional information, including events and deadlines of particular relevance to undergraduates, is provided at http://english.columbia.edu/undergraduate, the department’s undergraduate homepage. The sidebar on this page provides links to pages with details about undergraduate advising, major and concentration requirements, course options and restrictions, registration procedures, the senior essay, and writing prizes, as well as links to downloadable worksheets for the major and concentration and to course distribution requirement lists, past and present. For detailed information about registration procedures, students should consult https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings, which explains the requirements and enables students to monitor their own progress.\n\nNewly declared majors should contact the undergraduate coordinator in 602 Philosophy Hall and request that their names be added to the department’s electronic mailing list for English majors and concentrators. Because important information now routinely is disseminated through e-mail, it is crucial that students be on this list.\n\nLiterary Texts, Critical Methods\n\nThe introductory course ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study, together with its companion seminar, ENGL UN2001 Approaches to Literary Study Seminar, is required for the English major, minor, or concentration. It should be taken by the end of the sophomore year. Fulfillment of this requirement is a factor in admission to seminars and to some lectures. This once-a-week faculty lecture, accompanied by a seminar led by an advanced graduate student in the department, is intended to introduce students to the study of literature. Students read works from the three major literary modes (lyric, drama, and narrative), drawn from premodern to contemporary literature, and learn interpretative techniques required by these various modes or genres. This course does not fulfill any distribution requirements.\n\nSenior Essay\n\nThe senior essay program is an opportunity for students to explore in depth some literary topic of special interest to them, involving extensive background reading and resulting in an essay (8,000–15,000 words) that constitutes a substantial and original critical or scholarly argument. Students submit proposals in September of their senior year, with acceptance contingent upon the quality of the proposal and the student’s record in the major. Students who are accepted are assigned a faculty sponsor to supervise the project, from its development during the fall semester to its completion in the spring. It is for the spring semester, not the fall, that students officially register for the course, designated as ENGL UN3999 THE SENIOR ESSAY. Senior essays are due in early April.\n\nCourse Options and Restrictions\n\nSpeech courses may not be counted toward the major.\n\nTwo writing courses or two upper-level literature courses taught in a foreign language, or one of each, may count toward the major, though neither type of course fulfills any distribution requirement. Writing courses that may be applied toward the major include those offered through Columbia’s undergraduate Creative Writing Program and through Barnard College.\n\nComparative literature courses sponsored by the department (designated as CLEN) may count toward the major. Those sponsored by other departments (e.g. CLFR - Comp Lit French, CPLS - Comp Lit and Society) are not counted toward the major without permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Literature courses taught in English in language departments do not count toward the major.\n\nNo more than two courses taken during the summer session may be counted toward the major.\n\nCourses offered through the Barnard English Department may count toward the major or concentration. Before taking Barnard courses, students should verify with the director of undergraduate studies whether and how such courses may count toward the major.\n\nFor courses taken abroad or at other American institutions to count toward the major, students must obtain approval of the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nTo register for more than 42 points (including advanced standing credit) in English and comparative literature, a student majoring in English must obtain permission of the director of undergraduate studies.\n\nNo more than five courses taken elsewhere may be applied to the major, four to the concentration.\n\nOne independent study (for at least 3 points) may count toward the major but cannot satisfy any distribution requirements; likewise, the Senior Essay may count toward the major but fulfills no requirements. Students may not count both an Independent Study and the Senior Essay toward the major.\n\nCourses assigned a grade of D may not be counted toward the major.\n\nOnly the first course taken to count toward the major can be taken Pass/D/Fail.\n\nMajor in English\n\nPlease read Guidelines for all English and Comparative Literature Majors and Concentrators above.\n\nTen departmental courses (for a minimum of 30 points) and, in the process, fulfillment of the following requirements. See course information above for details on fulfilling the distribution requirements.\n\nENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study and ENGL UN2001 Approaches to Literary Study Seminar\n\nPeriod distribution: Three courses primarily dealing with periods before 1800, only one of which may be a course in Shakespeare\n\nGenre distribution: One course in each of the following three generic categories:\n\nPoetry\n\nProse fiction/narrative\n\nDrama/film/new media\n\nGeography distribution: One course in each of the following three geographical categories:\n\nBritish\n\nAmerican\n\nComparative/global (comparative literature, postcolonial, global English, trans-Atlantic, diaspora)\n\nCourse Distribution Lists are available in the department and on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings to help students determine which courses fulfill which requirements. A single course can satisfy more than one distribution requirement. For example, a Shakespeare lecture satisfies three requirements at once: not only does it count as one of the three required pre-1800 courses it also, at the same time, fulfills both a genre and a geography distribution requirement (drama and British, respectively). Courses not on the distribution list may count toward the major requirements only with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Two writing courses or upper-level literature courses taught in a foreign language, or one of each, may count toward the ten required courses.\n\nConcentration in English\n\nPlease read Guidelines for all English and Comparative Literature Majors and Concentrators above.\n\nEight departmental courses and, in the process, fulfillment of the following requirements. See course information above for details on fulfilling the distribution requirements.\n\nENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study and ENGL UN2001 Approaches to Literary Study Seminar\n\nPeriod distribution: Two courses dealing with periods before 1800, only one of which may be a course in Shakespeare\n\nGenre distribution: Two courses, each chosen from a different genre category (see above)\n\nGeography distribution: Two courses, each chosen from a different geography category (see above)\n\nSee the Course Distribution Lists, available in the department or on-line at https://english.columbia.edu/content/course-listings, to determine which courses fulfill which requirements. All of the restrictions outlined for the English major also apply for the concentration in English.\n\nComparative Literature Program\n\nStudents who wish to major in comparative literature should consult the Comparative Literature and Society section of this Bulletin.\n\nFall 2024\n\nIntroduction to the Major\n\nENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Students who register for ENGL UN2000 must also register for one of the sections of ENGL UN2001. This course is intended to introduce students to the advanced study of literature, through a weekly pairing of a faculty lecture (ENGL 2000) and small seminar led by an advanced doctoral candidate (ENGL 2001). Students in the course will read works from across literary history, learning the different interpretive techniques appropriate to each of the major genres (poetry, drama, and prose fiction). Students will also encounter the wide variety of critical approaches taken by our faculty and by the discipline at large, and will be encouraged to adapt and combine these approaches as they develop as thinkers, readers, and writers. ENGL 2000/2001 is a requirement for both the English Major and English Minor. While it is not a general prerequisite for other lectures and seminars, it should be taken as early as possible in a student's academic program\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN2000\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 2000 001/15085 F 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n702 Hamilton Hall Erik Gray 4.00 58/75 ENGL 2000 AU1/19310 F 10:10am - 11:25am\n\nOthr Other Erik Gray 4.00 0/5\n\nENGL UN2001 Approaches to Literary Study Seminar. 0.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Students who register for ENGL UN2001 must also register for ENGL UN2000 Approaches to Literary Study lecture.

They mark of a form of deep-time AN record and respond to ecological devastation and abundance. Symbolic of the strange proximity of the divine in numerous different religious and literary traditions, trees figure as alter-egos or doubles for human lives and after-lives (in figures like the trees of life and salvation, trees of wisdom and knowledge, genealogical trees). As prostheses of thought and knowledge, they become synonymous with structure and form, supports for linguistic and other genres of mapping, and markers of organization and reading. As key sources of energy, trees –as we know them today -- are direct correlates with the rise of the Anthropocene. Trees are thus both shadows and shade: that is, they are coerced doubles of the human and as entry ways to an other-world that figure at the limits of our ways of defining thought and language. By foregrounding how deeply embedded trees are in world-wide forms of self-definition and cultural expression, this course proposes a deeper understanding of the way in which the environment is a limit-figure in the humanities’ relation to its “natural” others. This course assumes that the “real” and the “literary” are not opposed to one another, but are intimately co-substantial. To think “climate” or “environment” is not merely a matter of the sciences, rather, it is through looking at how the humanities situates “the tree” as a means of self-definition that we can have a more thorough understanding of our current ecological, political, and social climate. Foregrounding an interdisciplinary approach to literary studies, this course includes material from eco-criticism, philosophy, religion, art history, indigenous and cultural and post-colonial studies. It will begin by coupling medieval literary texts with theoretical works, but will expand (and contract) to other time periods and geographic locales\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3794\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3794 001/14185 T 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n612 Philosophy Hall Patricia Dailey 4.00 20/18\n\nENGL UN2091 Introduction to Old English. 3.00 points.\n\nENGL GU4091 Introduction to Old English will be renumbered to ENGL UN2091 with a graduate section added to ENGL GR6998\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN2091\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 2091 001/14820 T Th 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n703 Hamilton Hall Patricia Dailey 3.00 19/44\n\nENGL UN2791 Mysticism and Medieval Drama. 3.00 points.\n\nENGL GU4791 Mysticism and Medieval Drama will be renumbered to ENGL UN2791 with a graduate section added to ENGL GR6998\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN2791\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 2791 001/14810 T Th 8:40am - 9:55am\n\n602 Hamilton Hall Eleanor Johnson 3.00 54/54 ENGL 2791 AU1/19314 T Th 8:40am - 9:55am\n\nOthr Other Eleanor Johnson 3.00 0/10\n\nENGL UN3873 Troilus and Criseyde. 4.00 points.\n\nThe intellectual goals of the course are to understand the manuscript evidence for the text and to be able to read Chaucer with precision: precision as to the grammatical structure, vocabulary, rhymes, and meter of the text.

This course will cover the histories, comedies, tragedies, and poetry of Shakespeare’s early career. We will examine the cultural and historical conditions that informed Shakespeare’s drama and poetry; in the case of drama, we will also consider the formal constraints and opportunities of the early modern English commercial theater. We will attend to Shakespeare’s biography while considering his work in relation to that of his contemporaries. Ultimately, we will aim to situate the production of Shakespeare’s early career within the highly collaborative, competitive, and experimental theatrical and literary cultures of late sixteenth-century England\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN1335\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 1335 001/14172 M W 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n503 Hamilton Hall James Stephen Shapiro 3.00 55/55\n\nENGL UN2100 Drama Before Shakespeare. 3.00 points.\n\nThis lecture course focuses on the many different forms of drama that emerged in England in the decades before William Shakespeare started writing. The drama of sixteenth-century England found its stages in a bewildering variety of venues: the city streets, boys’ grammar schools, the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the Inns of Court, the royal court, civic halls, private households, and inns. This course will introduce students to a range of plays in all genres (tragedies, comedy, history), and use these plays to explore aspects of Elizabeth theatre, including the playhouses, companies, repertory, playwriting, and the printing of plays. No knowledge of Shakespeare’s plays is required\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN2100\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 2100 001/14175 M W 8:40am - 9:55am\n\n413 Kent Hall Alan Stewart 3.00 21/50\n\nENGL GU4462 Gender and Resistance in Early Modern Literature. 4.00 points.\n\nThis class will focus on early modern literature’s fascination with the relationship between women, gender, and political resistance in the early modern period. The works we will read together engage many of the key political analogies of the period, including those between the household and the state, the marital and the social contract, and rape and tyranny. These texts also present multiple forms of resistance to gendered repression and subordination, and reimagine sexual, social, and political relationships in new and creative ways. Readings will include key classical and biblical intertexts, witchcraft and murder pamphlets, domestic conduct books, defenses of women, poetry (by William Shakespeare, Aemilia Lanyer and Lucy Hutchinson), drama (Othello, The Winter’s Tale, and Gallathea), and fiction (by Margaret Cavendish).

Taking a cue from the sociologist and historian Orlando Patterson, who writes that “freedom is one those of values better experienced than defined,” this seminar will explore the variegated experiences of freedom and its opposites in the literature of British Romanticism. Romanticism unfolds alongside major revolutions in America, France, and Haiti, and we will begin by examining how the differing conceptions of freedom offered in the wake of these revolutions and their receptions galvanized writers and thinkers in Britain. From here, we will probe the expressions, possibilities, implications, and limits of freedom as outlined in various domains: political, individual, aesthetic, economic, philosophical, religious, and beyond. In situating Romanticism alongside developments like revolution, the rise of globalization, and the Atlantic slave trade, we will be particularly interested in confronting how the explosion of claims to freedom in this period emerges together with and in response to the proliferation of enslaved, colonized, and otherwise constrained or hindered bodies. As we read poems, novels, slave narratives, philosophical essays, political tracts and documents, and more, a fundamental question for the course will concern the relation between binary terms: to what extent, and how, do notions of freedom in Romanticism depend on the necessary exclusion of the unfree? Since the Romantic age sees the birth of concepts of freedom still prevalent in our own day, this course will offer an opportunity to reflect critically on the present. To that end, we will take up some contemporary theoretical analyses and critiques of freedom, both directly in relation to Romanticism and reaching beyond\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3994\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3994 001/14191 M 12:10pm - 2:00pm\n\n301m Fayerweather Joseph Albernaz 4.00 0/18\n\n20th and 21st Century\n\nENGL UN3241 African American Literature: The Essay. 4 points.\n\nAccording to literary critic Cheryl A.

Writers from different national traditions have been avidly reading each other, wherever they happen to come from, and they often resist national and regional labels altogether. If you ask the Somali writer Nuruddin Farah whether the precocious child of Maps was inspired by Salman Rushdie´s Midnight´s Children, he will answer (at least he did when I asked him) that he and Rushdie both were inspired by Sterne´s Tristram Shandy and Grass´s The Tin Drum. At the same time, the human experiences around which novelists organize their fiction are often themselves global, explicitly and powerfully but also mysteriously. Our critical language is in some ways just trying to catch up with innovative modes of storytelling that attempt to be responsible to the global scale of interconnectedness on which, as we only rarely manage to realize, we all live. Authors will include some of the following: Gabriel Garcia Márquez, Jamaica Kincaid, W.G.

Our current awareness of oil's scarcity and its myriad costs (whether environmental, political, or social) provides a lens to read for the presence (or absence) of oil in texts in a variety of genres and national traditions. As we begin to imagine a world \"beyond petroleum,\" this course will confront the ways in which oil shapes both the world we know and how we know and imagine the world. Oil will feature in this course in questions of theme (texts \"about\" oil), of literary form (are there common formal conventions of an \"oil novel\"?), of interpretive method (how to read for oil), of transnational circulation (how does \"foreign oil\" link US citizens to other spaces?), and of the materiality (or \"oiliness\") of literary culture (how does the production and circulation of texts, whether print or digital, rely on oil?).\n\nFall 2024: CLEN GU4199\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLEN 4199 001/14169 M W 4:10pm - 5:25pm\n\n310 Fayerweather Jennifer Wenzel 3.00 90/90\n\nENGL UN3712 HENRY JAMES AND EDITH WHARTON. 4.00 points.\n\nJames & Wharton, America's two greatest novelists in the half century after the civil war and the eve of the first world war, were friends and fellow cosmopolitans, at home in the US & Europe, chroniclers of an emerging transatlantic urban modernity traversing New York, London, Paris, Rome, Geneva. Their fiction often portrays glamorous surfaces and intricate social texts that their brilliant heroines --Isabel Archer of The Portrait of a Lady & Lily Bart of The House of Mirth, for example--negotiate with wit and subtlety, confusion and daring, amidst fear and fascination. They find themselves immersed in bruising plots--crafted by society's disciplinary imperatives and by their creators, the latter standing in uneasy complicity with the social order even as they seek its transformation. Giving female protagonists unprecedented boldness and ambition, Wharton & James chart how intense exertion of will and desire collides with \"the customs of the country,\" to cite the title of a great Wharton novel. We will read the three novels mentioned above as well as Wharton's Summer & Ethan Frome and James's \"Daisy Miller,\" Washington Square & The Ambassadors.\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3712\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3712 001/14182 W 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Ross Posnock 4.00 14/18\n\nENGL UN3628 FAULKNER. 4.00 points.\n\nIn this course, we’ll be studying novels, stories, and screenplays from the major phase of William Faulkner’s career, from 1929 to 1946. Our primary topic will be Faulkner’s vision of American history, and especially of American racial history: we’ll be asking what his fictions have to say about the antebellum/“New” South; the Civil War and Reconstruction; the issues of slavery, emancipation, and civil rights; and the many ways in which the conflicts and traumas of the American past continue to shape and burden the American present. But we’ll consider other aspects of Faulkner’s work, too: his contributions to modernist aesthetics, his investigations of psychology and subjectivity, his exploration of class and gender dynamics, his depiction of the natural world, and his understanding of the relationship between literature and the popular arts\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3628\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3628 001/14181 M 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n201 80 Claremont Austin Graham 4.00 17/18\n\nENGL UN3726 Virginia Woolf. 4 points.\n\nSix novels and some non-fictional prose: Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, The Waves, Between the Acts; A Room of One's Own, Three Guineas.

The legal and economic entity of the corporation established new social hierarchies and systems of power, changed the roles of government and families, and wrought new forms of relationships between individuals. American culture demonstrated both an enchantment with the possibilities of a growing economy and a looming anxiety about the systematization of personal relationships. Authors and critics grappled with an American society that seemed to offer unprecedented opportunity for social rise but only within a deeply threatening and impersonal structure. We'll examine the ways that literary and popular culture depicted corporations and the ways that corporate structure influenced literary aesthetics and form.

It depends on your understanding both of politics and of the novel. If politics means parties, elections, and governing, then few novels of high quality would qualify. If on the other hand “the personal is the political,” as the slogan of the women’s movement has it, then almost everything the novel deals with is politics, and few novels would not qualify. This seminar will try to navigate between these extremes, focusing on novels that center on the question of how society is and ought to be constituted. Since this question is often posed ambitiously in so-called “genre fiction” like thrillers and sci-fi, which is not always honored as “literature,” it will include some examples of those genres as well as uncontroversial works of the highest literary value like Melville’s “Benito Cereno,” Ellison’s “Invisible Man,” and Camus’s “The Plague.”\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3805\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3805 001/14187 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n569 Alfred Lerner Hall Bruce Robbins 4.00 18/18\n\nCLEN GU4899 Resistance Literature. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course will explore the historical category of Resistance Literature, its theory and practice, its transnational expansion, and its ongoing relevance today. Originally proposed by Palestinian author and political activist Ghassan Kanafani in 1967, “Resistance Literature” named an activist practice of writing that sought to challenge discriminatory state practices, social policies, power structures and lived injustices, as well as to reshape the ideological frameworks that enabled official political structures of oppression in the institutional forms of colonialism (settler and otherwise), neocolonialism, authoritarianism, apartheid, systemic racisms, ethnonationalisms, gendered exclusions, and religious discrimination. Examining diverse genres such as novels, poetry, plays, memoirs, films, we will analyze the literary and political strategies, motifs, and modes by which authors around the world over the past century have attempted to use their art to resist oppression, to mobilize public opinion, and to advocate for social change. Collectively, we will attempt to identify literary and formal commonalities across these literatures to identify generic characteristics of Resistance Literature that might distinguish it from Literature in general\n\nFall 2024: CLEN GU4899\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLEN 4899 001/14171 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n1102 International Affairs Bldg Joseph R Slaughter 4.00 10/18\n\nENGL GU4932 ESSAYISM. 4.00 points.\n\nIn the second decade of the 21 st century there is more critical attention than ever before on the essay as a literary genre and a cultural practice that crosses media, registers, disciplines, and contexts. The concept of “essayism” was redefined by the Robert Musil in his unfinished modernist novel, The Man Without Qualities (1930) from a style of literature to a form of thinking in writing: “For an essay is not the provisional or incidental expression of a conviction that might on a more favourable occasion be elevated to the status of truth or that might just as easily be recognized as error … ; an essay is the unique and unalterable form that a man’s inner life takes in a decisive thought.” In this course will explore how essays can increase readers’ andwriters’ tolerance for the existential tension and uncertainty we experience both within ourselves as well as in the worlds we inhabit. As Cheryl Wall argues, essays also give their practitioners meaningful work to do with their private musings and public concerns in a form that thrives on intellectual as well as formal experimentation. The course is organized to examine how practitioners across media have enacted essayism in their own work and how theorists have continued to explore its aesthetic effects and ethical power\n\nFall 2024: ENGL GU4932\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 4932 001/14194 T 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n612 Philosophy Hall Nicole Wallack 4.00 4/18\n\nENGL GU4559 August Wilson. 4.00 points.\n\nIn this seminar we will read the complete published plays of August Wilson along with significant unpublished and obscurely published plays, prose, and poetry. The centerpieces of this course will be what Wilson termed his “century cycle” of plays: each work focusing on the circumstances of Black Americans during a decade of the twentieth century. As we consider these historical framings, we also will explore closely on what Wilson identified as the “four B’s” that influenced his art most emphatically: Bessie Smith (sometimes he called this first B the Blues), Amiri Baraka, Romare Bearden, and Jorge Luis Borges. Accordingly, as we consider theoretical questions of cross-disciplinary conversations in art, we will study songs by Bessie Smith (and broad questions of the music and literary form), plays, prose, and poetry of Baraka (particularly in the context of Wilson’s early Black Arts Movement works), the paintings of Bearden, and the poetry and prose (along with a few lectures and transcribed interviews) of Borges. We will use archival resources (online as well as “hard copy” material, some of it at Columbia) to explore Wilson’s pathways as a writer, particularly as they crisscrossed the tracks of his “four B’s.” Along the way we will examine several drawings and paintings (from his University of Pittsburgh archives) as we delve into the rhythmical shapes, textures, and colors he used on paper and canvas as well as in his plays. Visitors to the class will include Wilson’s musical director Dwight Andrews and at least one of his regular actors\n\nFall 2024: ENGL GU4559\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 4559 001/14193 Th 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n612 Philosophy Hall Robert O'Meally 4.00 0/18\n\nSpecial Topics\n\nENGL UN3795 SENIOR ESSAY RESEARCH METHODS. 3.00 points.\n\nThe senior essay research methods seminar, offered in several sections in the fall semester, lays out the basic building blocks of literary and cultural studies. What kinds of questions do literary and cultural critics ask, and what kinds of evidence do they invoke to support their arguments? What formal properties characterize pieces of criticism that we find especially interesting and/or successful? How do critics balance the desire to say something fresh vis-a-vis the desire to say something sensible and true? What mix of traditional and innovative tools will best serve you as a critical writer? Voice, narrative, form, language, history, theory and the practice known as “close reading” will be considered in a selection of exemplary critical readings. Readings will also include “how-to” selections from recent guides including Amitava Kumar’s Every Day I Write the Book, Eric Hayot’s The Elements of Academic Style and Aaron Ritzenberg and Sue Mendelsohn’s How Scholars Write. The methods seminar is designed to prepare those students who choose to write a senior essay to complete a substantial independent project in the subsequent semester. Individual assignments will help you discover, define and refine a topic; design and pursue a realistic yet thrilling research program or set of protocols; practice “close reading” an object (not necessarily verbal or textual) of interest; work with critical sources to develop your skills of description and argument; outline your project; build out several sections of the project in more detail; and come up with a timeline for your spring semester work. In keeping with the iterative nature of scholarly research and writing, the emphasis is more on process than on product, but you will end the semester with a clear plan for your essay itself as well as for the tasks you will execute to achieve that vision the following semester. The methods seminar is required of all students who wish to write a senior essay in their final semester. Students who enroll in the methods seminar and decide not to pursue a senior essay in the spring will still receive credit for the fall course\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3795\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3795 001/14186 M 6:10pm - 8:00pm\n\n707 Hamilton Hall Jenny Davidson 3.00 0/18 ENGL 3795 002/17651 M 6:10pm - 8:00pm\n\n607 Hamilton Hall Joseph Albernaz 3.00 0/18\n\nENTA UN3701 DRAMA, THEATRE AND THEORY. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Instructor's permission.

Two papers, weekly responses, and a class presentation are required.

However, Latinxs have always been more than mere numbers: while some have stayed rooted in traditional homelands, and while others have migrated through far-flung diasporas, all have drawn on and developed distinctive ways of imagining and inhabiting the Americas. In this course, we will explore a wide range of these Latinx lifeways. Through readings in the humanities and social sciences, we will learn how Latinxs have survived amidst and against settler colonialism and racial capitalism. Meanwhile, through the study of literature and art, we will see how Latinxs have resisted and/or reinforced these social systems. With our interdisciplinary and intersectional approach, we will determine why Latinidad has manifested differently in colonial territories (especially Puerto Rico), regional communities (especially the US–Mexico borderlands), and transnational diasporas (of Cubans, of Dominicans, and of a variety of Central Americans). At the same time, we will understand how Latinxs have struggled with shared issues, such as (anti-) Blackness and (anti-)Indigeneity, gender and sexuality, citizenship and (il)legality, and economic and environmental (in)justice. During the semester, we will practice Latinx studies both collectively and individually: to enrich our in-class discussions, each student will complete a reading journal, a five- page paper, a creative project, and a digital timeline\n\nFall 2024: CSER UN3523\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CSER 3523 001/14274 Th 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n420 Hamilton Hall Carlos Nugent 4.00 22/22\n\nENGL UN3891 INTRO TO CLASSICAL RHETORIC. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: the instructor's permission.\n\nPrerequisites: the instructor's permission. (Seminar). This course examines rhetorical theory from its roots in ancient Greece and Rome and reanimates the great debates about language that emerged in times of national expansion and cultural upheaval. We will situate the texts of Plato, Isocrates, Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, and others in their historical contexts to illuminate ongoing conversations about the role of words and images in the negotiation of persuasion, meaning making, and the formation of the public. In the process, we will discover that the arguments of classical rhetoric play out all around us today. Readings from thinkers like Judith Butler, Richard McKeon, Robert Pirsig, and Bruno Latour echo the ancients in their debates about hate speech regulation, the purpose of higher education, and the ability of the sciences to arrive at truth. We will discover that rhetoricians who are writing during eras of unprecedented expansion of democracies, colonization, and empire have a great deal to say about the workings of language in our globalizing, digitizing age.

In dialogues, essays, and letters from antiquity to early modernity, writers have returned to this proposition from Plato’s Phaedo to consider, in turn, what it means for living and dying well. This course will explore some of the most widely read of these works, including by Cicero, Seneca, Jerome, Augustine, Boethius, Petrarch, and Montaigne, with an eye to the continuities and changes in these meanings and their impact on the literary forms that express them.

Presently, nearly 25％ of its inhabitants are of Caribbean descent. In addition, according to a 2021 New York City Office of Immigrants report, five of the top countries of origin of the city's new immigrants were born in a Caribbean country: Dominican Republic (421,920, number 1), Jamaica (165,260, number 3), Guyana (136,180, number 4); Trinidad and Tobago (85,680, number 8), and Haiti (78,250, number 9). In addition, Puerto Ricans, who are colonial migrants, number 1.2 million or 9％ of the city’s population. During the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries, New York City was a pivotal space for Caribbean radical praxis understood here as political action and thought shaped by the Caribbean experiences of enslavement, coloniality, and diaspora. These interventions deeply transformed not only New York but multiple other contexts in Latin America, Africa, and Europe, and a broad range of movements including anti-colonial, anti-racist, feminist, and queer. To better understand the impact of Caribbean radical figures and thought in New York and beyond, we will examine texts from a broad range of writers and thinkers, including Jesús Colón, Julia de Burgos, Hubert Harrison, Alexis June Jordan, Audre Lorde, José Martí, Malcolm X, Manuel Ramos Otero, Clemente Soto Vélez, and Arthur Schomburg\n\nFall 2024: CLEN UN3790\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLEN 3790 001/14168 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n401 Hamilton Hall Frances Negron-Muntaner 4.00 20/18 CLEN 3790 AU1/19318 W 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\nOthr Other Frances Negron-Muntaner 4.00 0/2\n\nENTA UN3708 Reenactment and Performance in 20th ＆ 21st Centuries. 4.00 points.\n\nHas reenactment, or the practice of “restaging a historical or biographical event” reached an end?

This class will ask critical questions regarding reenactment as a performance act that crosses temporal, cultural, and discipline-specific boundaries and polarities. Investigating reenactment’s dynamics, potentials, and failures, we will examine battle reenactments, international theatrical tribunals, Indigenous performance, visits to nuclear disaster sites, autobiographical performance, and method actors.

This introductory course will survey the way this tension, between personal coherence and collective historical experience, formally characterizes Asian American media and literature since the 1970s, in which the form of the personal essay is critically expanded and brought into conflict with the racialized history of Asian American immigrant experience. Beginning with Lisa Lowe’s Immigrant Acts (1994) and Colleen Lye’s America’s Asia (2005), this course will furnish students with an understanding of both the successive exclusion acts applied to different waves of East and Southeast Asian immigration to the United States, as well as the ways these exclusion acts produced, and were produced by, expanding forms of anti-Asian American racism. This framework of economic policy and racial form will then be used as a lens to investigate prominent texts across the Asian American canon (as well as outside of this canon) by authors such as Frank Chin, MaxineHong Kingston, Carlos Bulosan, John Okada, Theresa Cha, Jessica Hagedorn, Wilfrido Nolledo, and Elaine Castillo\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3675\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3675 001/17479 M 12:10pm - 2:00pm\n\n425 Pupin Laboratories Chris Kelly 4.00 5/18\n\nENGL UN3477 New Suns: Worlding in Black Speculative Fiction. 4.00 points.\n\nThis course takes Octavia E.

With literary, sonic, visual, and cinematic examples, including works from Pauline Hopkins, W.E.B. DuBois, Samuel Delany, Wangechi Mutu, Janelle Monae, Sun Ra, Saul Williams, and others, this class considers the contexts of possibility for re/imagining Black pasts, presents and futures. Paying particular attention to how Black speculative fiction creates new worlds, social orders, and entanglements, students will develop readings informed by ecocriticism, science and technology studies, feminist, and queer studies. We will consider the multiple meanings and various uses of speculation and worlding as we encounter and interpret forms of utopian, dystopian, and (post)apocalyptic thinking and practice.

What kinds of questions do literary and cultural critics ask, and what kinds of evidence do they invoke to support their arguments? What formal properties characterize pieces of criticism that we find especially interesting and/or successful? How do critics balance the desire to say something fresh vis-a-vis the desire to say something sensible and true? What mix of traditional and innovative tools will best serve you as a critical writer? Voice, narrative, form, language, history, theory and the practice known as “close reading” will be considered in a selection of exemplary critical readings. Readings will also include “how-to” selections from recent guides including Amitava Kumar’s Every Day I Write the Book, Eric Hayot’s The Elements of Academic Style and Aaron Ritzenberg and Sue Mendelsohn’s How Scholars Write. The methods seminar is designed to prepare those students who choose to write a senior essay to complete a substantial independent project in the subsequent semester. Individual assignments will help you discover, define and refine a topic; design and pursue a realistic yet thrilling research program or set of protocols; practice “close reading” an object (not necessarily verbal or textual) of interest; work with critical sources to develop your skills of description and argument; outline your project; build out several sections of the project in more detail; and come up with a timeline for your spring semester work. In keeping with the iterative nature of scholarly research and writing, the emphasis is more on process than on product, but you will end the semester with a clear plan for your essay itself as well as for the tasks you will execute to achieve that vision the following semester. The methods seminar is required of all students who wish to write a senior essay in their final semester. Students who enroll in the methods seminar and decide not to pursue a senior essay in the spring will still receive credit for the fall course\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3795\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3795 001/14186 M 6:10pm - 8:00pm\n\n707 Hamilton Hall Jenny Davidson 3.00 0/18 ENGL 3795 002/17651 M 6:10pm - 8:00pm\n\n607 Hamilton Hall Joseph Albernaz 3.00 0/18\n\nSpring 2024\n\nIntroduction to the Major\n\nENGL UN3001 LITERARY TEXTS ＆ CRIT METHODS. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Students who register for ENGL UN3001 must also register for one of the sections of ENGL UN3011 Literary Texts, Critical Methods.\n\nPrerequisites: Students who register for ENGL UN3001 must also register for one of the sections of ENGL UN3011 Literary Texts, Critical Methods. This course is intended to introduce students to the advanced study of literature. Students will read works from different genres (poetry, drama, and prose fiction), drawn from the medieval period to the present day, learning the different interpretative techniques required by each. The course also introduces students to a variety of critical schools and approaches, with the aim both of familiarizing them with these methodologies in the work of other critics and of encouraging them to make use of different methods in their own critical writing. This course (together with the companion seminar ENGL UN3011) is a requirement for the English Major and Concentration. It should be taken as early as possible in a students career. Fulfillment of this requirement will be a factor in admission to seminars and to some lectures\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL UN3001\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3001 001/12316 F 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n602 Hamilton Hall Erik Gray 4.00 59/75\n\nMedieval\n\nENGL UN3920 MEDIEVAL ENGLISH TEXTS. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: the instructor's permission.\n\nThe class will read the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in the original Middle English language of its unique surviving copy of circa 1400, and will discuss both the poem's language and the poem's literary meritThe class will read the poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in the original Middle English language of its unique surviving copy of circa 1400, and will discuss both the poem's language and the poem's literary merit\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL UN3920\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3920 001/12354 T 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n612 Philosophy Hall David Yerkes 4.00 13/18\n\nFall 2024: ENGL UN3920\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3920 001/14190 T 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n612 Philosophy Hall David Yerkes 4.00 15/18\n\nRenaissance\n\nENGL UN3336 SHAKESPEARE II. 3.00 points.\n\n(Lecture).

We will give special focus to the fear of female infidelity, the theatrical fascination with the woman’s pregnant body, and the cultural desire to confirm and expose women’s chastity. We will read plays in which women are falsely accused of adultery, in various generic contexts (such as William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline and Much Ado About Nothing), along with plays in which women actually commit infidelity (such as the anonymous Arden of Faversham and Thomas Middleton’s A Chaste Maid in Cheapside). Focusing on a different play each week, we will ask: what does it take, ultimately, to believe women about their fidelity? At the same time, what is the effect of being doubted on women themselves? We will also give consideration to the particular resources of dramatic form, paying attention to moments in plays that coerce spectators themselves into mistaken judgments about women. We will supplement our reading of drama with pamphlets, advice literature, poems, church court cases, and ballads, in order to place these plays within a broader and more varied culture of female surveillance in early modern England. Finally, we will work to recover past strategies of liberation from this surveillance in the plays we read, in women’s writing that warns against male betrayal, and in dramatic and historical instances of female cross-dressing\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL UN3343\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3343 001/12344 M 4:10pm - 6:00pm\n\n327 Uris Hall Lauren Robertson 4.00 14/18\n\n18th and 19th Century\n\nENGL UN3728 American Transcendentalism. 4.00 points.\n\nThe class is an intensive reading of the prose and poetry of Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman and Emily Dickinson. Through detailed analysis of Emerson’s Essays we will try to understand his philosophy as an effort to radically reformulate traditional concepts of identity, thinking, and everyday living, and investigate the politics that guided his philosophical efforts, especially his stance on slavery and his activism against the Cherokee removals. But we will also be interested in his thinking on dreams, visions and mental transports and in order to ask how those experiences come to model his understanding of personal identity and bodily integrity. In Thoreau, we will look closely into ideas about the art of living and his theory of architecture, as well as quotidian practices of dwelling, eating or cooking, as ways to come to terms with one’s own life. We will pay special attention to Thoreau’s understanding of thinking as walking, as well as the question of space vs. time and we will spend a lot of time figuring his theory of living as mourning. With Whitman we will attend to his new poetics and investigate its relation to forms of American Democracy. We will also want to know how the Civil War affected Whitman’s poetics both in terms of its formal strategies and its content. Finally, we will try to understand how ideas and values of transcendentalist philosophy fashion poetry of Emily Dickinson both in its form and its content. We will thus be looking at Dickinson’s famous fascicles but also into such questions as loss, avian and vegetal life and the experience of the embodied more generally\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL UN3728\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3728 001/14880 M 2:10pm - 4:00pm\n\n507 Philosophy Hall Branka Arsic 4.00 15/18\n\nENGL UN3933 Jane Austen. 4.00 points.\n\nPrerequisites: Permission of instructor.\n\nThis seminar offers intensive study of the career of Jane Austen, including important recent criticism.

The movement of Romanticism was born in the ferment of revolution, and developed alongside so many of the familiar features of the modern world—features for which Romanticism provides a vantage point for insight and critique. As we read authors including William Blake, Jane Austen, John Keats, Mary Shelley, and many others, we will situate our discussions around the following key issues: the development of individualism and new formations of community; industrialization and ecology (changes in nature and in the very conception of “nature”); and slavery and abolition\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL GU4400\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 4400 001/12357 T Th 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n503 Hamilton Hall Joseph Albernaz 3.00 17/54\n\nCLEN GU4822 19th Century European Novel. 3 points.\n\nThe European novel in the era of its cultural dominance.

This survey of African American literature focuses on language, history, and culture. What are the contours of African American literary history? How do race, gender, class, and sexuality intersect within the politics of African American culture? What can we expect to learn from these literary works? Why does our literature matter to student of social change? This lecture course will attempt to provide answers to these questions, as we begin with Zora Neale Hurstons Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937) and Richard Wrights Native Son (1940) and end with Melvin Dixons Loves Instruments (1995) with many stops along the way. We will discuss poetry, fiction, drama, and non-fictional prose. Ohter authors include Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Gwendolyn Brooks, Malcom X, Ntzozake Shange, Audre Lorde, and Toni Morrison. There are no prerequisites for this course. The formal assignments are two five-page essays and a final examination.

Thematic and theatrical exploration involve positioning the plays in the context of the trajectories of modernism and postmodernism and examining, in that context, the emblematic use of stage sets and tableaux; the intense scrutiny of families, friendships, and disruptive intruders; the experiments with temporality, multi-linearity, and split staging; the issues raised by performance and the implied playhouse; and the plays' potential as instruments of cultural intervention. Two papers are required, 5-7 pages and 10-12 pages, with weekly brief responses, and a class presentation. Readings include major plays of both writers and key statements on modernism and postmodernism.

This course will explore both the modern literature that was inspired by Garcia Marquez’s example and the literature that led up to this extraordinary moment—for example, the literature dealing with the Holocaust, with the dropping of the atomic bomb, with the Japanese invasion of China in the 1930s, and with the Allied bombing of the German cities. It will also ask how extraordinary this moment in fact was, looked at from the perspective of literature as a whole, by inspecting earlier examples of atrocities committed in classical antiquity, in the Crusades, against Native Americans and (in Tolstoy) against the indigenous inhabitants of the Caucasus. Before the concept of the non-combatant had been defined, could there be a concept of the atrocity? Could a culture accuse itself of misconduct toward the members of some other culture? In posing these and related questions, the course offers itself as a major but untold chapter both in world literature and in the moral history of humankind\n\nSpring 2024: CLEN GU4771\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLEN 4771 001/12314 M W 10:10am - 11:25am\n\n330 Uris Hall Bruce Robbins 3.00 43/60\n\nCLEN GU4201 POETRY OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA. 3.00 points.\n\nThis course will focus on twentieth century poetry written by authors of African descent in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. The readings will allow us to cover some of the most significant poetry written during the major black literary movements of the century, including the Harlem Renaissance, Negritude, and the Black Arts movement. In particular, the course will be designed around a selection of books of poetry by black writers. We will thus spend a substantial amount of time reading each poet in depth, as well as discussing various strategies for constructing a volume of poetry: thematic or chronological arrangements, extended formal structures (suites, series, or montages), historical poetry, attempts to imitate another medium (particularly black music) in writing, etc. We will use the readings to consider approaches to the theorization of a diasporic poetics, as well as to discuss the key issues at stake in the tradition including innovation, the vernacular, and political critique\n\nSpring 2024: CLEN GU4201\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment CLEN 4201 001/12630 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n413 Kent Hall Brent Edwards 3.00 39/60\n\nENGL UN3757 The Lost Generation. 4.00 points.\n\nIn this course we’ll study literature by “The Lost Generation,” the celebrated cohort of U.S. writers who came of age during the First World War and went on to publish their major works during the heady days of The Jazz Age and the doldrums of The Great Depression. The authors we’ll read will include Barnes, Dos Passos, Eliot, Faulkner, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Hughes, Hurston, Larsen, Loos, McKay, and Toomer, and we’ll talk about their relations to the major aesthetic movements of the 1920s and 1930s: Modernism, The Harlem Renaissance, and The Literary Left. Our primary focus, however, will be on how these writers depicted and expressed the alienation of the young during this period. We’ll be learning about a rising generation of Americans who felt out of step with their times and ill-suited to their places, and we’ll be reading books about rootlessness and expatriation, masking and passing, apathy and radicalism, loneliness and misanthropy, repression and derangement, and several other preoccupations of these drifting, wandering, “lost” artists\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL UN3757\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 3757 001/12352 M 10:10am - 12:00pm\n\n707 Hamilton Hall Austin Graham 4.00 13/18\n\nENGL GU4316 WORLD'S END: 20th/21st CENTURY DYSTOPIAN FICTION AND FILM. 3.00 points.\n\nNo future, there’s no future, no future for you…or me…What happens after the end of the future? If England’s dreaming in 1977 looked like a dead-end, how do we dream of futures in a moment so much closer to the reality of worlds’ end? In this class, we will read a range of ambiguous utopias and dystopias (to use a term from Ursula LeGuin) and explore various models of temporality, a range of fantasies of apocalypse and a few visions of futurity. While some critics, like Frederick Jameson, propose that utopia is a “meditation on the impossible,” others like José Muñoz insist that “we must dream and enact new and better pleasures, other ways of being in the world, and ultimately new worlds.” Utopian and dystopian fictions tend to lead us back to the present and force confrontations with the horrors of war, the ravages of capitalist exploitation, the violence of social hierarchies and the ruinous peril of environmental decline. In the films and novels and essays we engage here, we will not be looking for answers to questions about what to do and nor should we expect to find maps to better futures. We will no doubt be confronted with dead ends, blasted landscapes and empty gestures. But we will also find elegant aesthetic expressions of ruination, inspirational confrontations with obliteration, brilliant visions of endings, breaches, bureaucratic domination, human limitation and necro-political chaos. We will search in the narratives of uprisings, zombification, cloning, nuclear disaster, refusal, solidarity, for opportunities to reimagine world, ends, futures, time, place, person, possibility, art, desire, bodies, life and death\n\nSpring 2024: ENGL GU4316\n\nCourse Number Section/Call Number Times/Location Instructor Points Enrollment ENGL 4316 001/12356 M W 2:40pm - 3:55pm\n\n209 Havemeyer Hall Jack Halberstam 3.00 41/60\n\nCLEN GU4550 NARRATIVE AND HUMAN RIGHTS. 3.00 points.\n\n(Lecture). We cant talk about human rights without talking about the forms in which we talk about human rights. This course will study the convergences of the thematics, philosophies, politics, practices, and formal properties of literature and human rights. In particular, it will examine how literary questions of narrative shape (and are shaped by) human rights concerns; how do the forms of stories enable and respond to forms of thought, forms of commitment, forms of being, forms of justice, and forms of violation? How does narrative help us to imagine an international order based on human dignity, rights, and equality? We will read classic literary texts and contemporary writing (both literary and non-literary) and view a number of films and other multimedia projects to think about the relationships between story forms and human rights problematics and practices. Likely literary authors: Roberto Bolaño, Miguel de Cervantes, Assia Djebar, Ariel Dorfman, Slavenka Drakulic, Nuruddin Farah, Janette Turner Hospital, Franz Kafka, Sahar Kalifeh, Sindiwe Magona, Maniza Naqvi, Michael Ondaatje, Alicia Partnoy, Ousmane Sembène, Mark Twain . . . .

(Seminar). As the great imperial powers of Britain, France, and Belgium, among others, ceded self-rule to the colonies they once controlled, formerly colonized subjects engaged in passionate discussion about the shape of their new nations not only in essays and pamphlets but also in fiction, poetry, and theatre. Despite the common goal of independence, the heated debates showed that the postcolonial future was still up for grabs, as the boundary lines between and within nations were once again redrawn. Even such cherished notions as nationalism were disputed, and thinkers like the Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore sounded the alarm about the pitfalls of narrow ethnocentric thinking. Their call for a philosophy of internationalism went against the grain of ethnic and racial particularism, which had begun to take on the character of national myth. The conflict of perspectives showed how deep were the divisions among the various groups vying to define the goals of the postcolonial nation, even as they all sought common cause in liberation from colonial rule. Nowhere was this truer than in India. The land that the British rulers viewed as a test case for the implementation of new social philosophies took it upon itself to probe their implications for the future citizenry of a free, democratic republic. We will read works by Indian writers responding to decolonization and, later, globalization as an invitation to rethink the shape of their societies. Beginning as a movement against imperial control, anti-colonialism also generated new discussions about gender relations, secularism and religious difference, the place of minorities in the nation, the effects of partition on national identity, among other issues. With the help of literary works and historical accounts, this course will explore the challenges of imagining a post-imperial society in a globalized era without reproducing the structures and subjectivities of the colonial state. Writers on the syllabus include Rabindranath Tagore, M.K. Gandhi, B.R. Ambe"
