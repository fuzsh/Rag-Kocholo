        "text": "In 2021, a new visa route was launched for holders of and people eligible for British National (Overseas) (BN(O)) status who are ordinarily resident in Hong Kong or the UK and their family members, in response to China’s imposition of the National Security Law on the people of Hong Kong in July 2020. The UK Government estimates that between 258,000 and 322,000 BN(O) status holders could take up the BN(O) visa route and arrive in the UK over the next five years.\n\nIn February 2022, the Government announced that it is extending the BN(O) visa scheme to younger Hongkongers, enabling individuals aged 18 or over who were born on or after 1 July 1997 and who have at least one BN(O) parent to apply to the route independently of their BN(O) parent. The changes came into effect in October 2022.\n\nUnlike the other immigration and resettlement schemes described above, the Hong Kong BN(O) Welcome Programme is being led by the DLUHC. BN(O) status holders will be expected to be self-sufficient and will have no recourse to public funds (NRPF) on arrival. Where there is exceptional need, they may apply to have this condition removed in order to access welfare support.\n\nThe Hong Kong BN(O) Welcome Programme includes a package of support consisting of 12 virtual, regional ‘welcome hubs' provided by SMPs; the launch of a dedicated hate crime reporting hotline, a national and regional grant scheme which has funded a total of 47 national and regional projects , alongside funding for local authorities for destitution and ESOL support.\n\nThe DLUHC has funded the following Voluntary, Community and Social Enterprise (VCSE) organisations through its Regional VCSE Grant Scheme to deliver regional and national projects that foster the social integration of Hongkongers in UK society, in London, some of which will offer informal ESOL provision:\n\nHKG international\n\nGood Neighbour\n\nChurch England\n\nSutton Vineyard Church\n\nFaithAction (part of LifeLine Community Projects)\n\nHackney Chinese Community Services\n\nLight Foundations\n\nMeridian Wellbeing\n\nVolunteer Centre Sutton\n\nRenaisi\n\nGroundwork London\n\nIslington Chinese Association\n\nHong Kong Business Hub.\n\nThe following national organisations have also been funded by the DLUHC through the national VCSE Grant Scheme in London to support Hong Kong BN(O)s to settle into life in the UK, including educational resources, access to mental health services, help for people to find jobs and start their own businesses, and to meet people in their local communities, as well as a hate crime reporting service for BN(O)s and those of East and Southeast Asian descent. These organisations have been funded by the DLUHC:\n\nHongkongers in Britain (HKB)\n\nProtection Approaches\n\nBarnardo’s\n\nUKHK/Welcome Churches\n\nMigrant Helpline\n\nBritish Future.\n\nAs part of this programme, the Greater London Authority and the LSMP host the region’s ‘Hong Kong Welcome Hub’, alongside managing funding for Local Authorities and community groups to support the integration of Hong Kong BN(O)s in the capital. This has included the following grant funding programmes:\n\nWelcoming Hongkongers Fund\n\nThe Welcoming Hongkongers Fund, which ended in 2022, targeted smaller grassroots groups or organisations run by and/or for Hongkongers, and included a ‘Incubator’ commissioned specifically to provide successful grantees support and networking opportunities to help them make the most out of their grant, build a legacy from their work, and help them to grow further. The successful grantees include:\n\nWelcoming Hongkongers H.O.M.E Project, previously Barnet Hong Kongers\n\nKingston BEATS CIC\n\nProject TEMP\n\nHong Kong Aid\n\nUK Welcomes Refugees\n\nHearth Talk.\n\nThe Local Hong Kong Welcome Fund (2022-23 and 2023-24)\n\nThe Local Hong Kong Welcome Fund aims to support London’s local authorities in fostering the integration of Hongkongers in the capital. Seven grants of up to £30,000 were allocated to successful applicants in June 2022 to fund projects for approximately six months. Funding has been used for delivering information sessions to the Hong Kong community, setting up dedicated resources and staffing to support Hong Kong BN(O)s, and the provision of informal English language provision to the community, among other projects. The following local authorities were successful in securing funding in the first round of the fund:\n\nHaringey\n\nKingston\n\nSutton\n\nRichmond\n\nTower Hamlets\n\nWaltham Forest.\n\nA second round of the fund, the Local Hong Kong Welcome Fund 2023, closed for applications in January 2023 and will fund similar activity.\n\nHong Kong Community Fund (2023-24)\n\nThe fund was launched in February 2023 and aims to support Hongkongers, to make them feel welcomed and build a sense of belonging in their new communities in London. It is targeted at non-established, newly established, or smaller grass root groups or organisations run by and/or for Hongkongers and their partners. Development grants of £1,000-£10,000 and Impact grants of £10,001-£20,000 were made available.\n\nHigher Education Welcome Hong Kong Fund (2023-24)\n\nThe Hong Kong Hub launched the Higher Education (HE) Hong Kong Welcome Fund in 2022. The funding aims to build HE capacity to support the welcome and integration of new arrival students from Hong Kong. Successful grantees will be announced in spring 2023.\n\nThe Government has launched three schemes to accommodate Ukrainians who are escaping the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukraine Family Scheme opened on 4 March 2022. It allows those from Ukraine who are the immediate and extended family members of British nationals, those with Indefinite Leave to Remain, refugees, people with humanitarian protection, or EEA or Swiss citizens to come to the country without having to meet the usual requirements for a family visa. Those joining the Scheme will be granted leave for three years. Immediate family members are defined as a partner, child under 18, parent of a child under 18, fiancé, or proposed civil partner. Extended family member is defined as parent, grandparent, grandchild, adult child, sibling, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew, and cousin, and the immediate family members of these extended family members. If their application to the scheme is successful, leave to remain will be granted for a total of 36 months or 3 years. Access to public funds, work and study are permitted.\n\nThe Homes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme was opened on 18 March 2022 and is targeted at people who do not have family in the UK. It allows Ukrainian nationals and their family members to come to the UK if they have a named sponsor under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme who commits to providing accommodation for at least six months. Unaccompanied children are also eligible for this route, although there are additional requirements. If their application to the scheme is successful, leave to remain will be granted for a total of 36 months or three years. Access to public funds, work and study are permitted.\n\nOn 3 May 2022, the Government launched the Ukraine Extension Scheme, which allows Ukrainian nationals and their immediate family members who are already in the UK on a range of visa types, to apply for leave to stay in the UK for three years. They must have a valid UK visa or have held one that expired on or after 1 January 2022 to be eligible. This route does not lead to settlement. A person who has immigration permission as a partner or child of a Ukrainian national who qualifies under the Ukraine Extension Scheme, who is not themselves a Ukrainian national, can also qualify under the Ukraine Extension Scheme. Individuals on all three schemes will be free to live, work and study in the UK and access public funds.\n\nESOL courses can be accredited (i.e., lead to a qualification) or non-accredited. A number of factors will be considered when deciding whether an accredited or non-accredited course is suitable for a learner, including, for example, their prior schooling and transferrable study skills; exposure to English in their day-to-day life; the time in the academic year; whether there are vacancies in the given class; whether the organisation offers accredited provision; the learner’s availability; ability to travel; issues that may impact on their ability to attend classes regularly and whether they have other needs, such as childcare.\n\nEach type of provision holds value. Although they do not lead to a qualification, non-accredited courses can be very useful for participants to increase their confidence, develop their skills (such as basic literacy), and learn about and meet other people in their local area. They can also help learners to develop the study skills necessary to succeed in formal learning, for example, attending on time, taking notes and completing homework. Accredited courses can be useful for proving proficiency for employment and/or further studies. They can also help learners to get a sense of their progress toward proficiency in English and recognise their achievements.\n\nA typical learner’s ESOL journey will usually be made up of informal, formal, non-accredited and accredited teaching and learning. This process is not always linear. A learner may begin learning in an informal and non-accredited course; progress onto a formal, non-accredited course; and then progress onto a formal, accredited one. A different learner who begins with formal, accredited provision may have to take a break in learning due to illness or the birth of child and return to informal learning, with a view to progress to formal provision once they are able to commit to the attendance requirements or once a class with childcare becomes available. Other learners may need to deprioritise their learning to manage stressful life events, work commitments or bereavement. In these cases, informal, non-accredited drop-in type provision may be most appropriate for them for a period. Where possible, complete breaks in learning for prolonged periods should be avoided as often this can lead to the loss of gains achieved, unless the adult makes a concerted effort to review and practise their language skills regularly and independently.\n\nThe sections below outline the eligibility of people arriving via different resettlement schemes and immigration routes to the main funding streams for ESOL in London currently. Policy and funding changes rapidly in this area. The information below is subject to change but is accurate in February 2023. For more frequent updates, sign up to the GLA’s ESOL Newsletter.\n\nThe following section outlines the main sources of ESOL funding in London. Additional ESOL funding from the Home Office and the DLUHC assumes that full use of existing funding streams for ESOL will be made before additional ESOL funding is claimed. There is a strong emphasis on avoiding duplication of funding from the Adult Education Budget which is the main and most secure source of funding for ESOL. This is because annual under-spends of mainstream ESOL funding imply that there is not enough demand for the allocated funding. In the long-term, this can lead to cuts to mainstream funding.\n\nThe AEB in London funds ESOL provision for approximately 50,000 people with English-language needs at a cost of approximately £53 million per annum and is the main source of funding for ESOL in London. However, it is not the only source of funding. ESOL is also funded via a range of other funding streams and organisations, including the European Social Fund (ESF); the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF); National Lottery Community Fund; Trust for London; and other large and small charitable organisations. Most funding streams are finite and new funding streams occasionally become available. For example, DLUHC’s English for Integration Fund (EFIF) and Controlling Migrant Fund (CMF) came to a close in 2022 after several years. The Refugee Employment Programme for refugees, which contains an ESOL element, is set to begin delivery in mid-2023 until 2025. The UK Shared Prosperity Fund (UKSPF), which does not mention ESOL specifically, but does have a ‘people and skills’ objective, and replaces the ESF which ends in autumn 2023, launched in mid-2022.\n\nEach funding stream, including ESOL funding available through resettlement schemes, has its own set of eligibility criteria. Providers frequently apply their own restrictions on top of the prescribed eligibility requirements to meet organisational or local priorities. Many providers use more than one funding stream to fund the ESOL their organisation offers. This makes the ESOL landscape complex and difficult to navigate for people with English-language needs. However, it also means that if a person is ineligible for one funding stream, they may be able to access provision via another funding stream.\n\nIdentifying existing ESOL provision in the local area\n\nIn any given area, there will usually be both formal and informal ESOL providers. ESOL Advice Services or ESOL Networks in the area may already have carried our mapping, so are a good first port of call. In the absence of an ESOL Advice Service or SPOC in your local area, the GLA hosts maps of all AEB and non-AEB providers in London, and the local authority’s social prescribing or Early Help teams may be able to provide information on the existing informal offer in the borough. It is also worth searching for ‘ESOL’ or ‘English classes’ on the local authority website to ascertain whether mapping has been carried out already.\n\nIt is good practice to approach one provider at a time to prevent places being held in multiple classes for one person, thereby preventing other learners from accessing this provision. This will also reduce the number of times a learner will be asked to sit an initial assessment which can be stressful. You can usually find useful information about each provider’s process on their website. It is worth bearing in mind that the location of initial assessment may not always also be the location of the class the learner is placed on. Many providers, particularly formal ones, will also run provision in outreach venues.\n\nLarger providers, usually formal, will normally run a range of ESOL courses, both in the daytime and evening and are usually able to offer more hours per week than smaller providers. Smaller providers tend to have fewer options related to time of day, level and location. Availability of the offer will vary depending on different factors including when in the academic year the application is made. Many providers have two intakes a year, in Term 1 and Term 2, subject to spaces being available. Informal providers are often able to be more flexible and enrol through all three terms (starting September, January and April). Many providers are closed over the August summer holiday.\n\nSome providers will be able to offer eight or more hours per week as per Home Office requirements for UKRS, ACRS, ARAP and British nationals evacuated from Afghanistan, but others will offer much fewer. Where a learner is identified as being suitable for formal, accredited provision, it may be necessary to enrol adults on more than one course to make up the required number of hours. The total required hours may be made up with formal and informal courses and/or small group or 1:1 tuition. It is important however, not to enrol adults on two or more courses funded by the same funding stream, unless this is explicitly permitted by all providers of the same funding stream involved.\n\nTOP TIP: the GLA publishes a monthly ESOL newsletter with useful information relevant to organisations supporting people with English-language needs, including vacancies in classes and requests for provision.\n\nESOL Single Points of Contact (SPOCs) or Advice Services\n\nThere are a limited number of ESOL SPOCs in London, however, where they do exist, they are a useful first port of call when supporting families to access suitable English-language provision. ESOL SPOCs provide initial assessment of learners’ proficiency levels and needs such as childcare, and work in partnership with the full range of local ESOL providers to find them a suitable course. Some can also support with commissioning dedicated ESOL provision or securing qualified ESOL tutors for 1:1 tuition. The service is usually free of charge. In some areas, digital directories and websites list all the available provision in the given area. SPOCs are also often a good source of data on demand for ESOL in a given locality, which can be useful when considering commissioning provision.\n\nTOP TIP: the GLA hosts a map of AEB ESOL providers and list of local ESOL Advice Services/SPOCs and ESOL Networks on its website.\n\nESOL Networks\n\nSome London boroughs have ESOL networks. These groups are usually made up of organisations and individuals supporting people with English-language needs, and may include formal and informal ESOL providers, as well as Voluntary and Community Sector (VCS) organisations working with people seeking asylum, refugees and migrants. Membership may also include representation from statutory bodies, including the local authority and Clinical Commissioning Group.\n\nThe purpose of groups can vary depending on the make-up; however, they generally work together strategically to alleviate challenges faced by people with English-language needs when trying to settle in the UK, including increasing access to ESOL provision. Networks can also bring operational benefits – for example, co-location, co-design, sharing good practice and resources and other cooperation – which improve the outcomes and the experience of people with English-language needs in a locality or sub-region. ESOL networks are often a good source of information on ESOL provision in the local area, particularly in the absence of ESOL SPOCs. Membership by Refugee Resettlement Coordinators and Community Sponsorship Groups is usually welcome and ensures the experiences of families arriving via resettlement schemes are captured and inform any local strategic approach to ESOL.\n\nTOP TIP: if your local area does not have an ESOL Network, consider establishing one. The Learning and Work Institute have prepared a helpful guide on Establishing and developing local ESOL Partnerships. The National Lottery Community Fund also has a fund for partnerships.\n\nFor adults arriving via UKRS, ARAP, ACRS and eligible Afghan British nationals evacuated from Afghanistan, prior to arrival, the Home Office may be able to indicate whether the family members have English-language needs. Where ESOL will likely be required, it is useful to carry out some mapping work of formal and informal ESOL providers in the local area ahead of time. Arranging an ESOL initial assessment date with a single formal ESOL provider or ESOL Advice Service ahead of arrival can speed up the process. It can be more efficient to communicate directly with the ESOL curriculum manager or head of service rather than general enrolment staff when making arrangements for initial assessment prior to a family’s arrival.\n\nMost providers, unless they offer very informal, mixed-level provision, will be unable to provide information on course days, times and locations until an initial assessment has been completed with the potential learner. This is because the range and number of options depend entirely on the learner’s needs, as established at initial assessment. Informal providers, however, may be able to provide a list of informal ESOL options ahead of the family’s arrival.\n\nTOP TIP: the GLA hosts a map of AEB ESOL providers and list of local ESOL Advice Services/single points of contact (SPOCs) on its website.\n\nTOP TIP: Reset have produced a helpful guide for Community Sponsorship Groups on how to access ESOL provision.\n\nThe next stage is to arrange and attend an initial assessment with a single formal ESOL provider or qualified ESOL tutor for the adult. Unless engaging a qualified tutor directly, the initial assessment will normally take place face-to-face at one of the provider’s venues and the adult may need to be accompanied or supported with the travel route if they are unfamiliar with the area or public transport. Accompanying the adult may also help with any anxiety that may arise from navigating this system and ensure that both they and the ESOL provider understand any arrangements and next steps. Some providers may offer bespoke, on-site initial assessment for groups of learners. An initial assessment will involve establishing an individual’s speaking, listening, reading and writing levels, and key information which impacts on their ability to attend classes such as their physical and mental health needs, childcare needs and availability.\n\nThe assessment of all four skills usually takes place in the same sitting and at the end, the assessor will be able to share the learner’s ESOL level with them and anyone accompanying them. There will be a level for each skill – speaking, listening, reading and writing, and an overall level which decides the level of the course they are deemed suitable for. This usually takes into account their prior education and transferrable study skills. An assessment will also be made about the learner’s readiness for an accredited or non-accredited course and the most appropriate intensity of provision, i.e., number of hours per week.\n\nOnce the individual’s ESOL levels are known, the provider will outline the options available. If the options are not suitable or immediately available, using the information made available via the initial assessment, Refugee Resettlement Coordinators and Education leads at Community Sponsorship Groups will be able to contact other local ESOL providers in turn to check whether they have vacancies at the given level, and which accommodate the learner’s identified needs. It is still likely the learner will be asked to do another initial assessment once suitable provision with vacancies is identified; however, the suggested approach makes it less likely they will be asked to sit these assessments only to find there are no vacancies at the required level or required time of day multiple times.\n\nTravel\n\nIn addition to accompanying the individual to the initial assessment, where the ESOL course takes place at a different venue, it may be necessary to accompany them to their first few classes if they are unfamiliar with the area or public transport. AEB providers can use their Learner Support allocation to support students with travel expenses.\n\nUniversal Credit claimants may also be entitled to travel discounts through the Flexible Support Fund for mandatory provision where such costs are not met by the provider, or for approved non-contracted provision where this is previously agreed with DWP staff. In addition, a 50 per cent discount is available to people in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance, Universal Credit, Incapacity Benefit, Employment Support Allowance or Income Support who have been unemployed for a certain number of weeks. Further information is available on the Transport For London website.\n\nTOP TIP: Where regular DWP appointments fall at the same time as a class, informing the work coach of this clash will often result in the regular appointment being rescheduled to a convenient time. Where required, ESOL tutors are often able to provide the necessary documentation.\n\nDigital support\n\nBoth online and face-to-face ESOL provision usually requires some access to digital devices. Many tutors use smart-phones and applications such as WhatsApp, MS Teams and Zoom to communicate with learners in between lessons. Support both in terms of access to devices, Wi-Fi and 1:1 tutorials on how to use devices, applications, such as MS Teams and platforms, such as Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) may be required. Please see previous section on AEB-funded provision for information on Learner Support which can be used to support learners to access online learning. For Hong Kong BN(O) status holders, where digital equipment is necessary for individuals to access online learning, local authorities may reclaim related costs. However, the limit of £850 for each learner is still applicable.\n\nTOP TIP: Vodaphone’s Charities Connected is a digital inclusion programme which can help people get digitally connected with free SIM cards including 20GB of data.\n\nTOP TIP: The Good Thing Foundation’s Everyone Connected programme supports digitally excluded households without access to the internet.\n\nTOP TIP: BT is offering a £10 monthly fixed broadband tariff for low-income families called BT Home Essentials.\n\nTOP TIP: Visit the BBC’s Give a laptop webpage to find out about other organisation and schemes offering free digital devices.\n\nLearners with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities\n\nThere is a statutory requirement for learning providers to provide assessment and related resources to ensure reasonable adjustments are made to identify and accommodate people with special educational needs and disabilities, including dyslexia. AEB providers should draw on Learning Support210 for this purpose. Please note, Learning Support and Learner Support are distinct allocations. All AEB providers can access Learning Support to support them in making reasonable adjustments to cater for learners with special educational needs and disabilities.\n\nWhere provision is not AEB-funded or the full cost of necessary resources and support cannot be provided through existing funding, for adults arriving via UKRS, ARAP, the ACRS or British nationals evacuated from Afghanistan, a request for exceptional costs may be made to the Home Office. It is essential to secure prior agreement before incurring any costs by contacting the Home Office’s Resettlement Local Authority Payments team: [email protected].\n\nChildren between the age of five and 16 years old are required to be in full-time education. Local authorities have a statutory duty to provide sufficient school places for children of school age. School admission authorities must not refuse to admit a child based on their nationality or immigration status nor remove them from roll on this basis.\n\nUnder the current system, the National Funding Formula (NFF) is used to allocate funding from the Department for Education (DfE) to local authorities. The funding allocations to individual schools are determined by the local authority’s local formula. Up until 2022/23, the EAL factor, which allocates funding for pupils whose first language is other than English for the first three years in the statutory school system, was an optional factor; local authorities could choose whether to use NFF funding for EAL, and whether to allocate funding for EAL pupils for one, two or three years. From 2023-24, EAL is a compulsory factor which all local authorities must allocate to schools, and they can no longer choose only to fund those who entered the statutory school system in the last 1 or 2 years.\n\nSchools can draw on their overall funding to support the language needs of children from reception, up to age 16. This includes any funding that the school receives through the English as an additional language (EAL) factor within the NFF [1]. This funding equates to £565 per eligible primary pupil and £1,530 per eligible secondary pupil in 2022-23 (rising to £580 per eligible primary pupil and £1565 per eligible secondary pupil in 2023-24).\n\nPupil premium is funding that schools receive for pupils from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, i.e., pupils who are from households which have been in receipt of benefits-based free school meals at any point in the last 6 years [2]. Some EAL pupils may be eligible for the pupil premium. This funding is not, however, targeted at EAL pupils per se. Although ‘EAL’ is not specifically mentioned, schools have the flexibility to use pupil premium funding to support pupils’ language development needs. The list of examples provided by the government in its ‘menu of approaches’ includes ‘recruitment and retention of teaching staff’, ‘interventions to support language development, literacy…’, ‘teaching assistant deployment and interventions’, ‘one to one and small group tuition’, ‘extended school time, including summer schools’ and ‘communicating with and supporting parents’ [3]. Schools must publish a statement on their website describing how they use their Pupil Premium Budget, and how this impacts the attainment of disadvantaged pupils.\n\nNeither Pupil Premium nor funding via the NFF EAL factor are an entitlement for individual pupils, and schools are not required to spend all of their allocated grant on eligible pupils. This means the provision and quality of EAL in schools can vary.\n\nFunding for the children of those on the ACRS, ARAP, UKRS schemes and eligible British nationals evacuated from Afghanistan is also available to local authorities for additional education costs: £4,500 in year one for children aged between five and 18 years old; and £2,250 in year one for children aged between three and four years old.221 This funding may be used to provide additional EAL support in schools, where funding available through the Pupil Premium has been claimed in full but is not sufficient to cater for the child’s EAL needs. The local authority is responsible for ensuring that the appropriate level of funding is paid to places of education (incl. schools, academies, free schools and Further Education colleges, as appropriate) who accept Refugees from the relevant age groups.\n\nWhere there are compelling circumstances, additional funding for educational purposes may be requested for children who are 18 years old or younger and who are in full-time education. Such requests are considered on a case-by-case basis, as an exceptional cost. Payments will be made based on the age of the refugee on arrival in the UK. Although there is no dedicated funding for education from year one, tariff funding can be used to provide additional educational support to children alongside adults.\n\nHong Kong BN(O)\n\nNo additional funding has been provided for the educational needs of children of Hong Kong BN(O) status holders. The DLUHC has provided the following guidance in relation to funding for children in their guidance for local authorities:\n\n‘Where a school age child requires English language support, this will be provided by schools, with funding through the National Funding Formula (NFF) for schools, which includes an English as an additional language (EAL) component…. The NFF will distribute a total of £410 million through the EAL factor in the current financial year. Schools have flexibility over how they use their overall funding to support EAL pupils in developing proficiency in English, as they are best placed to understand and respond to the specific needs of their pupils’.\n\nHomes for Ukraine Sponsorship Scheme\n\nLocal authorities have received separate funding since 2022 for the Ukraine education tariff under the following rates: a per child tariff of £3,000 for early years, £6,580 for primary and £8,755 for secondary and payments calculated on a pro-rata basis. Although ‘EAL’ is not specifically mentioned in government guidance, the list of examples provided include ‘specialist teaching’, ‘specialist and bespoke services’ and ‘other reasonable costs associated with the provision of education’. Local authorities will be required to certify that they have passed on the correct amount of funding to schools or, where funding has been spent centrally, that it has been spent in line with these conditions of grant.\n\nCheshire East Lifelong Learning has had an ESOL presence in Crewe, Cheshire for several years. We advertise in local community centres and we have a contact email on our Council’s webpage. However, word of mouth remains the most effective recruitment method. We have our own network of Job Clubs and good working relationships with the Job Centres, so we refer our learners to each other for employability opportunities.\n\nWe were contacted in May this year by three people on Hong Kong BN(Overseas) Visa who had seen our flyers. While they are not eligible for ESFA funding until they have been resident in the UK for three years, we made sure we could help them. We created a new class and they studied for, and passed, accredited reading qualifications in the short time before the summer break.\n\nAfter the break, we welcomed 19 Hongkongers who are on the HK BN(O) scheme. We became aware of the £850 ESOL funding for the Hongkongers on HK BN(O) route in September this year. We applied directly to the DLUHC and will support these learners until they no longer need our support.\n\nAll HK BN(O) learners follow the same programme as mainstream ‘funded’ ESOL learners: interview, initial assessment, class placement, working towards accredited qualifications in ESOL Skills for Life (Reading Writing, Speaking and Listening), and progression to higher levels. We ensure that none of our classes are exclusively of people from one country to provide the variety needed for the best learning experience and lots of opportunities to practise their skills with others from different backgrounds. Classes are two hours weekly and we work to a thirteen-week term with assessments following the end of the terms. Homework is a must for all learners, and it is enthusiastically completed.\n\nWe have 20 HK BN(O) status holders now on roll with five on the waiting list. At the time of writing there are nine women and 11 men on the courses, some are wife and husband. From the introductory interviews (initial assessments) we have seen that their employability skills are rich and varied; we have a quantity surveyor, a product engineer, a mechanic, a construction worker, a scaffolder, a finance specialist, a network engineer, magazine editor and a photographer/YouTuber. We are determined to help them gain the English skills necessary for them to achieve their employment potential.\n\nWe have class WhatsApp groups with regular communication about further learning opportunities, progression routes into employment (CSCS cards for example) and local community events. The group chat also encourages communications within the groups for travelling together and meeting up outside the class. So far, we have not had to turn anyone away. Enquiries are still coming in and for those further away and unable to travel easily to Crewe, we refer them to other providers nearer their homes.\n\nACDA Skills Training is a community-based organisation established in 2009 that is committed to supporting local communities in the West London Boroughs of Ealing, Hounslow, Harrow and Hillingdon.\n\nDue to the pandemic we had to adapt and change the way we support our learners safely. Since April 2020, we have been successfully offering remote and virtual personalised support and training through one-to-one or group sessions over the phone and via video calls – depending on what works best for individuals. We took on 15 new volunteer ESOL tutors to help deliver free virtual ESOL classes. In total we have engaged with and supported over 900 learners remotely who wanted to improve their English-language skills from their own home.\n\nVolunteers were recruited via the local Volunteer Service as well as through the Do-it Website. Every volunteer was screened, and a DBS check undertaken with our organisation covering the costs. A free phone with unlimited minutes and texts was provided to each volunteer so that they could contact learners remotely. We had a formal volunteer agreement in place so that both parties are clear on what the volunteer role involves and what is required from both sides. This ensures that there is no confusion over what is expected from the volunteer. Volunteers really helped us through a difficult time during the pandemic. All volunteers were provided with access to online resources and online learning materials on ESOL and digital skills which were useful not only for the person they were supporting but also for to improve their own skills.\n\nFrom July 2000 to October 2021, we hand delivered 315 free internet tablet devices with internet connectivity to vulnerable and disadvantaged individuals across West London in real need and who were disproportionately disadvantaged as a result of the pandemic. This was made possible through the 'Everyone Connected' initiative funded by Nominet. BBC Children in Need, Vodafone, the Light Bulb Trust and Good Things Foundation. As part of this initiative, we worked closely with several services to help identify vulnerable individuals and families who were eligible and who would really benefit from having access to a device with internet connection.\n\nIn September 2021, we worked with the Afghan Families Project in Ealing by providing recent arrivals with a free internet tablet and internet connectivity. In total 13 recent arrivals from Afghanistan received a tablet device with internet connection. Dedicated assistance and training were also provided through one-to-one or small group sessions either over the phone, by email or text message and via video calls – depending on what worked best for the individual. By having their own internet devices, individuals could also access our ESOL and Digital Skills sessions remotely with a focus on inclusion and opportunity. Device recipients felt empowered and gained confidence and essential skills, which they were able to apply and use immediately.\n\nACDA Skills Training is a community-based organisation established in 2009 that is committed to supporting local communities in the West London Boroughs of Ealing, Hounslow, Harrow and Hillingdon. For five years (2014 to 2019), we acted as a Regional Hub Centre supporting centres across London and parts of the Southeast with delivering a MHCLG funded Pre-Entry ESOL programme called 'English My Way'. From 2019 to 2020, we delivered the MHCLG funded the 'Talking Together' English-language programme in partnership with Time Bank and the 'Creative English' project as a sub-contractor for Faith Action.\n\nPartnership working was essential to the success of our all ESOL programmes not only with helping to recruit potential learners who are likely to benefit the most from our ESOL classes but also with retention as well as with providing a free and safe space to learn. In 2019, we worked in partnership with the Afghanistan and Central Asian Association (ACAA), delivering ESOL classes at their new offices in Feltham. Our Basic English classes started in November 2019 and ended in February 2020. This was funded through the MHCLG via the Creative English programme. Organisations like the ACAA let us use their space to offer free ESOL classes which was extremely convenient for learners as they were able to access the training in a familiar environment.\n\nWe know that many isolated learners are fearful of having to travel far to access a specific learning programme due to their lack of confidence in speaking English and sometimes being unfamiliar with other parts of their local area. With this in mind, having all our classes taking place in local venues i.e. schools, children's and community centres, shopping centres, social housing associations and other community-based locations. This allows learners who are parents to drop off their child at school or at the crèche and then join their ESOL class straight after in another room, as our class times are arranged to accommodate their routines. Classes also finish in time for parents to pick up their child.\n\nAll of these MHCLG-funded English-language programmes were extremely successful in supporting a high proportion of learners with little or no English-language skills not only with improving their English but also with their confidence and by helping them integrate more with people from other communities. During this period, we delivered over 70 Pre-Entry ESOL classes within local community settings in the West London Boroughs of Ealing, Hounslow, Harrow and Hillingdon including in schools, children's and community centres, shopping centres, social housing associations and other community-based locations. Through the English My Way (MHCLG-funded) English programme we supported almost 900 people with approximately 144 learners being identified as being either from the Syrian or Afghan community. In total we engaged with and supported over 1,140 learners from all three MHCLG funded English-language programmes who between them spoke over 50 different languages.\n\nLearning Unlimited (LU) a not-for-profit social enterprise specialising in adult and family learning, ESOL and integration, literacy, numeracy and teacher education.\n\nWe are currently leading on the Communities Language and Integration Project (CLIP) funded by the Asylum Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF), which supports language learning and integration for refugees and non-EU migrants, which now includes those recently arrived from Afghanistan and Hong Kong.\n\nOver the last two years the project has supported over 150 people and their families, many of whom are unable to access AEB funded classes due to not being eligible, having young children, irregular work shift patterns or other reasons.\n\nThe CLIP project offers:\n\nESOL classes with accreditation\n\nonline conversation clubs run by our trained team of volunteers\n\nother workshops and clubs, such as writing, photography and cinema\n\nfamily workshops, trips and activities\n\nsignposting to other relevant training, events and support.\n\nBefore the pandemic we worked in Haringey, Southwark and Lambeth children’s centres and primary schools supporting refugee/migrant parents/carers. When the pandemic struck, we moved our entire programme online, and it predominately remains online to this day.\n\nOur online classes, conversation clubs and workshops are flexible and accessible; people can attend wherever and whenever. There are many who wouldn’t be able to attend face-to-face classes for different reasons including travel, family, safety and work. Our tutors and volunteers now have a lot of experience teaching and supporting on Zoom and have brilliant activities and resources to keep sessions inclusive, fun and interactive. We support people new to Zoom and loan tablets to those who need them.\n\nInitially this wasn’t easy; it was new to us all but particularly difficult for those with low level English, literacy and/or IT skills. Our beginner ESOL classes started by communication and support through WhatsApp. Some of our families had limited or no access to Wi-Fi or screens and we were able to start loaning tablets. This made a big difference to some, enabling learning and connection, reducing isolation during difficult times.\n\nBy September 2020 we had adjusted to this new online world and started a timetable of levelled classes (beginner to advanced) available to all Refugees and non-EU migrants around London, and even further afield. We trained volunteers to run conversation clubs and give 1:1 exam preparation support. We delivered other workshops including supporting parents with home schooling, yoga and writing (culminating in publications of learners’ stories as ESOL readers to support others new to the UK and learning English).\n\nWhat we started then carries on today. We have two classes that have resumed face-to-face in Lambeth and Southwark (with a crèche) which are popular, but the rest continue online. Online learning allows flexibility and accessibility to many who wouldn’t be able to attend face-to-face provision for different reasons.\n\nRegistrations take place on Zoom where we support those new to the platform, explain what we offer, find out about the person, their skills, needs and goals and assess their language levels. In the summer term, we offer accreditation through the English Speaking Board (ESB). In 2021, 95 per cent of our learners chose to take exams, which took place on Zoom, and we were thrilled with our 86 per cent pass rate.\n\nOur three online conversation clubs run on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. They are drop in and everyone is welcome, including family, friends and others in the local community.\n\nRedbridge Institute of Adult Education successfully won a bid to the ESOL for Integration Fund for the third year running. The EFIF project is funded by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) and aims to help residents with low levels of English to integrate into their local communities, access local services and improve social interaction. This project is known locally as English for Every Day.\n\nThrough regular networking with Redbridge Council partnerships, Redbridge Institute came across a number of hotels in the borough that had recently been converted to temporary accommodation for newly arrived people seeking asylum. One of these hotels in the borough accommodates more than 150 people. A majority of the residents have travelled from countries such as Eritrea, Sudan, Iran and Iraq and have been living in London for six months. Some of the residents have made incredibly difficult journeys to reach safety and have arrived via France, Belgium and Germany to name but a few. All residents are waiting to receive their Application Registration Card (ARC) from the Home Office to make their immigration status official.\n\nUpon visiting the hotel, the ESOL team were inundated with requests for ESOL classes by the residents. Interviews and initial assessments were conducted across three separate visits to identify individual needs and English competency levels. So far, 51 learners have started ESOL courses at Redbridge Institute across various locations. Most learners walk for 25 minutes from the hotel to Ilford to attend their courses and this provides a good opportunity for them to familiarise themselves with the local area. As part of the English for Every Day course, learners will tour the local central library and museum and become members. They will also visit local places of interest such as the shopping centre and a local café to apply their speaking skills. The ESOL sessions cover practical tasks such as using local transport, booking an appointment with the doctor and completing application forms. A safe and friendly environment is created to put the learners at ease and writing books and pens are provided to aid learning.\n\nOnce the introductory ESOL course comes to an end, learners will complete a summative assessment to check progress and will then be offered a suitable progression course that suits their needs. Of course, there is no guarantee that the residents will remain in Ilford or East London when they are rehoused but they will be guided by the ESOL Advisory team on their next steps in their learner journey regardless of their destination. The Institute has already seen a change in the learners’ behaviour and mindset. Learners come to class with a positive attitude and determination and leave with a smile. They have been able to meet new people and make new friends within the first few weeks of the programme.\n\nWe would not be able to support these individuals to take their first steps in learning in the UK and integrate into local communities without the EFIF project funds as some are not yet eligible for mainstream ESOL funding. The fund enables us to help these learners to grasp opportunities to settle confidently in the UK and improve their future prospects.\n\nWe work with people who are rough sleeping, which is the most visible and dangerous form of homelessness. The longer someone experiences rough sleeping, the more likely they are to face challenges around trauma, mental health and drug misuse. Many of our members are also in hidden types of homelessness, which means they stay in hostels, squats, B&Bs, in overcrowded accommodation, or ‘concealed’ housing, such as the floors, or sofas of friends and family. We also work with people who may be at risk of homelessness. People in low paid jobs, living in poverty, and poor quality, or insecure housing are more likely to experience homelessness. There are social causes of homelessness, such as a lack of affordable housing, poverty, unemployment and life events which push people into homelessness. Many of our members experiencing homelessness have escaped a violent or abusive relationship. Some people become homeless because they can no longer afford the rent. Our members sometimes go through relationship break down, losing a job, mental or physical health problems, or substance misuse. Being homeless can make any of these problems even harder to resolve.\n\nWhen members come to us their priorities, quite rightly, are their housing and our coaches work very hard on this, getting through a myriad of scenarios. These temporary housing situations create instability for members and signing up to courses is a real difficulty for members as they may not see any point in signing up for a 3-month course if they are going to moved out of the borough at any point. We could also argue that when members are going through such a traumatic time, whether learning is beneficial or is it something to concentrate on during uncertainty. We find that sometimes members are locked out of their local ESOL provision as their current status doesn’t allow for them to access services, for example an asylum seeker who can’t access college courses or members who want to sign up to classes but then go through a labyrinth of links to enrol, during which time motivation is lost. Furthermore, when members have finally found accommodation and we try to link them up with more accessible provision, we often find that classes are full, or they have just missed the start of a new 5/10-week course. This coupled with the scenario of moving into a new area, new accommodation, learning how to pay for bills, council tax etc means that members often forget about the strict enrolment periods that providers have and end up missing out on ESOL classes for a couple of terms until they are fully settled.\n\nWorking in a psychologically informed way, we establish an open, trusting and strength based professional relationships with members. Each Crisis member is allocated a lead worker who holds a holistic approach throughout the member’s journey and conducts sensitive assessments of their needs, including their housing, emotional and mental health, motivation and their aspirations for the future, part of which, is our learning offer. All our learning is member centred, and once we receive a referral from the lead worker, we arrange appointments around times that are suitable for the members. At the appointment, we find out more about the member and explore what they want to achieve within learning. For instance, we have discovered that some of our members would like to obtain a CSCS labourer card, but they did not feel confident they’d be able to pass the exams as English is not their first language. Therefore, we have started delivering a short course during which our ESOL tutor works with members on improving their vocabulary and understanding the CSCS terminology, which then helps members pass the exams, obtain the CSCS card and find employment on construction sites.\n\nCrisis has been providing a comprehensive learning offer to members we work with for years and whilst during the pandemic, we needed to adapt, we were still able to deliver purposeful ESOL provision to our members. Our online classes were mostly delivered via Zoom and WhatsApp. Pre-pandemic we would do a full initial assessment which would involve assessing all the skills, including reading, writing, speaking, and listening, however considering the various obstacles that members faced, we mostly went with a friendly initial chat to assess members, and adapted the learning as we got to know them more. We have taught online groups and 1-2-1 classes using a variety of resources such as BBC Websites, ESOL resources online, and the Voice of America website as well as creating content targeted towards members’ interests or needs.\n\nTo fully adapt to online teaching, we shortened the length of the classes as we recognised Zoom fatigue and understood that members need to conserve their data. We created an interactive online SWAY document as a way of adapting to the need for sharing information online with lead workers and coaches. Teaching online, however, raised some concerns and challenges. Whilst we were able to reach out to some members, it was not possible to reach out to everyone, as many members we worked with were digitally excluded. Being digitally excluded had and will continue to have very real ramifications. Being connected means having virtual and quick access to information, which during the lockdown was important.\n\nHowever, we partnered with Tesco Mobile with the aim of tackling digital exclusion, which meant we were able to engage more members online. Tesco Mobile provided us numerous tablets, smartphones, laptops as well as data to get members connected. We continue working in partnership with Tesco Mobile to provide digital devices, which include laptops and phones alongside data and sim-cards.\n\nWhilst having devices certainly helped, we also offered 1-2-1 support for those who were digitally excluded. This meant adapting learning styles to suit the needs of the members. Some members were not confident using Zoom. In these cases, we were able to offer 1-2-1 ESOL teaching, using WhatsApp, as this conserved data and was accessible to most of our members.\n\nWe set up a local Digital Inclusion Working group to identify and support members who were digitally excluded and enable them to access technology with tailored support from tutors often on a 1-2-1 basis. There were other barriers afterwards, such as adjusting to new learning styles, while living in covid accommodation, which sometimes resulted in not having enough privacy to do the classes or not having enough internet data to attend regular sessions.\n\nHowever, there were benefits too. By providing online teaching we were able to have smaller group sizes. Having larger group can discourage shyer attendees from taking part and limits sharing in discussions, so people might be less inclined to take part. Having smaller groups also meant that the sessions could be more tailored to members’ needs and when members were attending ESOL sessions, they were also developing their IT skills as they were using phones, laptops, and various other software they would not be using in a regular class setting.\n\nWe now provide a blended learning offer – this includes face-to-face learning, as well as delivering small online classes. This allows members who cannot travel to our Skylight building access to our learning offer. We continue to work with our community partners, such as International House, Morley College, and the Bishopsgate Institute to provide a varied learning programme for members. We continue develop our own learning provision and adapt, where necessary, to help our members adjust and thrive in a post-pandemic world.\n\nThe Sheffield Association for the Voluntary Teaching of English (SAVTE) works with ‘English language supports’ who volunteer their time to support others develop their English. Many of our English language supporters are now from the communities in which they offer support. We run conversation groups or one to one provision, where all participants are supported to play a very active role. The contingency hotel work is an exception to this. Both our teachers in contingency hotel are qualified teachers, and they volunteered to fill a gap for those stuck in hotels and wanting ESOL provision. SAVTE works hard to be flexible and respond quickly in cases like this.\n\nAt present SAVTE is operating two volunteer-led English lessons per week in a contingency hotel for people seeking asylum awaiting decision. The hotel houses a diverse group of students, from countries including Eritrea, Sudan, Yemen, Kurdistan, Iran, Vietnam, and Afghanistan, and with a very wide variance in previous experience of English. Some students are fluent in English, have studied extensively in English-language institutions, or previously worked as translators or interpreters; others are just beginning to read Roman letters, or are new to working in any script.\n\nSuch a wide variance in student experience with English presents both challenges and opportunities. Previously, SAVTE operated streamed classes, with some sessions aimed at beginners, others at improvers, and others at confident users of English. Concerns about the omicron variant of COVID-19 in early 2022, however, narrowed the pool of available volunteers, and as a result the two classes currently offered cater to everyone. In any case, attendance at a particular class was self-selected by the students, and many would attend any or all classes that they could. This, plus the precarious and rapidly changeable living circumstances of the students means that there is also considerable variation in attendance from session to session; students leave and arrive all the time.\n\nAs a result, volunteer teachers have to attempt to cater to all levels of ability, which is a particular but rewarding challenge. Exercises such as gap-fills that allow more confident learners to practice or self-teach while volunteers focus on small groups of beginners have proved helpful in these circumstances. The teachers can then present the answers to the exercises to the group as a whole, giving the entire class an opportunity to practice pronunciation and to ask questions about unusual vocabulary. In addition, speaking exercises that pair together more confident speakers with emerging speakers can provide good opportunities for collaborative learning. In many cases, students will sit with or work with others that speak their own first language; this allows them to provide support for one another and taps into the well-researched benefits of embracing a multilingual approach.\n\nOne of the opportunities afforded by having a group with some very experienced speakers of English is that of recruiting teaching volunteers from among the resident people seeking asylum themselves. SAVTE has sought to do this since beginning to operate in the hotel, and at present, in March 2022, one of the classes is taught by a teaching team of one resident volunteer and one outside volunteer. Having a teacher that understands personally the practical and emotional difficulties faced by many of the students has proven invaluable. It can also be of great value to the resident teachers themselves, who are denied the right to work while awaiting their own asylum decision. By teaching English, they can not only help their fellow people seeking asylum but can build on their own work experience and reinforce their skills in English.\n\nAs previously stated, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected SAVTE’s ability to operate in the hotel. The high incidence of the omicron variant of COVID-19 at the beginning of 2022 meant that some outside volunteers were no longer able to teach at the hotel. Limited internet connectivity and access to equipment among residents also makes it difficult to implement a remote learning programme. When lockdowns prevented any outside volunteers getting into the hotel, SAVTE provided materials so that the resident volunteer could keep the classes running. This included a laptop, whiteboard, markers, flipcharts, and worksheets. SAVTE also provided the learners with pens, pencils and notebooks. During this period, one volunteer who was also a person seeking asylum and a resident of the hotel, taught two courses of more than 40 people seeking asylum, of a range of levels.\n\nWaltham Forest College is supporting people seeking asylum and sanctuary including those from Ukraine. Many have been through traumatic experiences and need additional wrap around support including mental health and wellbeing support, financial support and help with accessing and liaising with external agencies. Refugees are mainly from Ukraine whilst the people seeking asylum and sanctuary are from a variety of countries - the largest being from Afghanistan, Eritrea and Sudan. Some of these people have been victims of human trafficking.\n\nThe refugees include 16-18 years old, some of whom are unaccompanied minors. During the last academic year, additional groups were added to be curriculum to support refugees coming into the region, referred to the college through the ESOL Advice Service, the borough’s ESOL Single-Point of Contact (SPOC). Many of these learners were referred late in the academic year and as it is known that the risk to refugees increases if they are not yet formally supported, the College agreed to take additional learners so they could start just before the summer break, rather than wait over eight weeks until the new academic year. This meant the College exceeded the funding tolerance for its devolved AEB budget by around 3% which was unfunded, and the College bore this cost (overall achieved 106% of allocation).\n\nFor the new academic year 2022/23, the numbers appear to be higher still. During the first four weeks of the term, Waltham Forest College enrolled 142 refugees, 35 of who were aged between 16-18 years. Whilst the majority of refugees overall are enrolled on ESOL courses, just under half of 16-18 years old refugees are enrolled on mainstream vocational study programmes in subjects such as electrical installations, Business and Digital. Nineteen of the adult learners are aged over 50 years.\n\nThe increase in Ukraine arrivals together with rising numbers of people seeking asylum and sanctuary and overall ESOL demand has led to significant increases in learner numbers, in excess of those recruited last year. There were 130 (16-18) ESOL learners planned for 2022/23 and the College has already enrolled 182 (140%) of target compared to the curriculum plan. In addition, to meet continued demand, the College is running a short ESOL speaking and listening course for 16-18 year olds in March, with the aim that they will progress onto full time study programmes in September; To date 40% of applicants are people seeking asylum or sanctuary.\n\nAs well as the ongoing support from the College’s welfare and safeguarding team, the Deputy Head of ESOL with responsibility for ESOL study programmes, meets with all ‘at risk’ 16-18 year old ESOL students daily which is having a positive impact on retention, engagement and mitigating risk of other safeguarding and external risks. This has meant he is not available for teaching, and this is being covered by hourly paid staff at additional cost. There were 1083 adult learners planned for the first semester (first half of the year and to date 1267 have been enrolled (117% of target).\n\nSemester two is just about to start. This has a target of 2,625 in the curriculum plan. So far 2,820 adults have enrolled. The College works in partnership with Waltham Forest Council, and community providers in partnership with the ESOL Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The SPOC has asked the College to support with an additional 400 refugees currently staying in a nearby hotel and waiting for a decision on their claim. Consequently, the College, in partnership with the ESOL Advice Service, provided non-funded beginner level ESOL courses to 65 people seeking asylum in October, who were not yet eligible for funding. These classes were held in a local library and the students were all residents of a nearby hotel. Of those, 30 have now progressed onto mainstream courses at the College. As these people seeking asylum only receive £8 per week, the College has supported them with bus fares to college to enrol, and again to start their course. They were then supported by our Welfare team to apply for the hardship fund and given oyster cards and free lunch passes.\n\nIn response to the growing need, the ESOL department within the College has opened a ‘bring and buy shop’ which provides second-hand clothing for our students. These are items largely donated by staff. This is open for an hour at lunch time twice a week and is staffed by volunteer teachers and study programme students. Money raised from the sale of clothes goes to refugee charities. The shop has increased in popularity and although most items are sold for less than £2 it has raised £100 in the last month. The College also continues to fund free breakfasts for all students - the take up for this has increased further this year.\n\nThe ESOL Adult Learning Service at Lambeth College, now known as South Bank Colleges, has been running a pilot over 18 weeks to fully understand the barriers ESOL students experience with learning Maths, and then removing them. The project aimed to support our ESOL Entry 2 and Entry 3 students with learning Maths, and our ESOL staff to unlock their own potential for teaching Maths, to support progression in work and education. We believe that ESOL teachers are best placed to unlock the English language needed to enable ESOL students’ access to Maths.\n\nAlongside ESOL classes and run in alignment with their ESOL timetable to improve accessibility, students took part in a Functional Skills Maths class at Entry 1 and Entry 2. The process we put in place was aimed at building confidence with using Maths every day for staff and students and increasing motivation by connecting the learning with values and outcomes that improve overall life experiences and create meaningful work opportunities. We connected learning with helping students to better manage their everyday finances and supporting their children with homework. This approach has supported us to contribute towards Lambeth’s Skills and Employment Strategy and enhanced our curriculum offer to support increased access to maths.\n\nThe results have been beyond our expectations. The vast majority of students passed first time, and by the end of the pilot, we had a 98% pass rate. We are now in semester 2, where students are progressing onto the next level for both ESOL and Functional Skills Maths. We were able to capture their voices and experiences on video demonstrating the impact on their life and learning from both staff and students. We hope this will support us engage even more ESOL students to learn maths and ESOL teachers to train as Maths teachers, helping us close the gap in skills as well as the shortage of Maths teachers.\n\nWe have successfully begun the process of creating a more inclusive curriculum offer that supports the progression of ESOL learners into mainstream education and assists them with acquiring the skills needed to demonstrate what they are capable of achieving. ESOL students themselves have also been surprised at what they have achieved because many had low confidence in Maths prior to the pilot. We were able to, through this pilot, work with staff and students to overcome some of their insecurities and the assumption that Maths was not for them. Our teachers have also travelled the same journey alongside our students. The college is also running ‘ESOL number’ and ‘ESOL for managing money’ as standalone options through Multiply Funding this year.\n\nEnglish for Action (EFA) is an action-orientated charity that works with over 400 migrants, refugees and asylum seekers per year across London, to build their capacity in challenging systems of structural oppression. EFA provides free English courses utilising a methodology we call participatory ESOL, and trains our students in community organising, to ensure they are ready to take on leadership roles and take direct action on the local, regional, and national issues most important to them.\n\nIn 2019, EFA set up a 'walk and talk' in response to the social isolation during the pandemic. We wanted to run a group activity, where we could enjoy each other's company, but in a relatively safe way, avoiding indoor spaces. The idea is to walk together, enjoy nature and have chats in mini-groups around the topic of the week.\n\nThanks to initial funding from Wandsworth Council we were able to recruit participants for a year-long 'walk and talk' group. We kicked off with 16 keen walkers in September 2021 at Battersea Park. Participants have reported it has been really important for their mental health. The walk and chat with classmates clears their minds and leaves learners feeling more positive. They have also used the opportunity to connect with others and get support. Learners reported they felt more confident speaking English than they had at the start. This was particularly the case for those also attending a classroom-based ESOL class with EFA on another day of the week. We can practise some of the specific grammatical elements that arise in the classroom, and the topics discussed during Walk and Talk reinforce new themes and emerging language. We really notice an improvement in the fluency of spoken English as well as language and vocabulary around speaking about health and mental wellbeing, for example.\n\nOther learners have been inspired to visit Battersea Park more often with friends and family, improving their physical and mental health. Consistency has been key to the success of the activity. Having a routine, meeting in the same place and walking in the same park helps everyone get into the habit of attending. Having tea and coffee at the local cafe in the park which is included in project costs and therefore free for participants, has also been really motivating, especially in the winter. Last summer we went on a group trip and took the boat from Westminster to Greenwich for a day. The Walk and Talk has continued this year and we're seeking funding to take it into a third year.\n\nIn the bustling borough of Islington, the Council's Refugee Resettlement Team has been making waves with their exceptional commitment to working with those with lived experiences of migration and displacement, alongside local communities, and statutory partners, to create a safe and supportive environment. As of March 2023, Home Office statistics revealed that 503 Ukrainian and 161 Afghan individuals had found a new home in this welcoming community.\n\nOne of the key factors in the successes of the team’s many integration-focused initiatives has been its internal organisational partnership and collaboration with the Islington Adult and Community Learning (ACL) service to address the language and employability needs of those new to the borough. The ability to leverage their respective expertise and resources to provide comprehensive support has resulted in the successful piloting of several programmes ensuring newcomers are equipped with the language skills and job readiness training necessary to communicate effectively, access services, and participate actively in their new communities. This partnership marked the beginning of a transformative journey towards creating a more comprehensive, inclusive and supportive environment for newcomers.\n\nAs a result of this collaboration, through a mix of central government integration grants for Afghan Resettlement and Homes for Ukraine, a new role was introduced in September 2023 - English Language Refugee and Migrant Coordinator (ELRMC). In line with our Borough of Sanctuary strategic plan, the role was commissioned by Islington’s NRPF, Refugee and Migrant service with a remit for resettled Afghan refugees, people who have had to flee Ukraine, people with no recourse to public funds and people seeking asylum. The role has teaching, advisory and project management components, including advising the service of existing English language provision for the cohorts of people supported.\n\nThis role has been specifically designed to serve as a crucial link between the Council’s Resettlement Team, ACL, the Camden ESOL Advice Service, and the resettled community, bridging the gap between language needs and resettlement support. The aim has been to provide a tailored approach and dedicated support that caters to specific linguistic needs, so empowering individuals to actively participate in their new communities and pursue their goals with confidence.\n\nSince the inception of the ELRMC role, there has been a noticeable shift in the way language barriers are addressed within the resettlement process. The position has demonstrated a further commitment to support by providing bespoke language classes aimed at making a real difference in the lives of those with no or low literacy skills who would otherwise face additional challenges in attending regular ESOL provision, including ESOL with creche. There has also been the opportunity to offer personalised interventions to equip individuals with the tools they need to succeed in a language-driven world.\n\nAdditional bespoke learning solutions have been generated through the creation of this role which has ensured that clients with limited language proficiency receive language-focused computer training to manage daily tasks like shopping, bill-paying, looking for jobs online, job applications and accessing essential services, so addressing wider digital literacy disparities.\n\nInnovation has also included a partnership with Islington’s Libraries on a monthly reading initiative for resettled families. The aim here has been for not only these families to develop their English language learning skills through stories and crafts, but also, for their children to maintain a connection with their cultural heritage through the introduction of dual-language readers.\n\nThe ELRMC role has brought a multitude of benefits to the table. Having a designated individual focused on language resources, the Resettlement Team can ensure a more tailored and effective approach to meeting the needs of over 70 resettled clients that have been referred through this process. The creation of the ELRMC post is a testament to the commitment of the Resettlement Team to support new residents on their journey towards integration. Moreover, with Islington Council now part the City of Sanctuary network and recognised as an official Borough of Sanctuary it means residents from migrant, refugee and asylum-seeking backgrounds can have their needs more practically addressed though solid political, service and community-based actions."
