        "text": "Forasmuch as it has pleased\n\nAlmighty God of his great mercy,\n\nto take unto himself the soul\n\nof our dear brother here departed...\n\n...we therefore commit his body\n\nto the ground...\n\n...earth to earth,\n\nashes to ashes...\n\n...dust to dust.\n\nSo sorry, my dear Mrs Henderson.\n\nYour husband\n\nwas a great friend to my country.\n\nThat's so kind of you.\n\nPlease join us at the house\n\nfor a small luncheon in his honour.\n\nThank you so much, Leslie...\n\nbut I think I'll take my own car.\n\nMadam.\n\nI know that Robert would want me to be\n\navailable to help you in any way.\n\nThank you so much.\n\n- He was an estimable man.\n\n- Yes. Yes.\n\nAnd a very dangerous\n\nbusiness competitor.\n\nYes.\n\nOh. Please.\n\nExcuse me.\n\nI am bored with widowhood.\n\nMy dear,\n\nyou've just scratched the surface.\n\nI have to smile at everybody.\n\nI've never had to do that.\n\nIn India, there were always people\n\nto look down on.\n\nPeople are simply being sympathetic.\n\nAfter all, you have lost your husband.\n\nI didn't mislay him.\n\nIt was most inconsiderate\n\nof Robert to die.\n\nWhat on earth\n\nam I supposed to do now?\n\nThe first rule of widowhood, my dear -\n\nimportant conversations occur at lunch.\n\nIt's really not so bad.\n\nWidows are allowed hobbies.\n\n- Hobbies?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- Embroidery. Things like that.\n\n- Are you mad?\n\nI graduated to weaving.\n\n- Would you care to see my tapestries?\n\n- I'd rather drink ink.\n\nCommittees are good, of course.\n\nI serve on quite a few.\n\nCharities.\n\nOnce your husband dies,\n\nit's quite permissible to help the poor.\n\nAnd now there's no-one\n\nto stop you buying things.\n\nAlso, of course, there's\n\na great deal of time for lovers.\n\n- Margot, I'm nearly 70.\n\n- That's true.\n\nBut you're also very rich.\n\nThe one cancels out the other.\n\nI don't know anything\n\nabout embroidery.\n\nOw! Oh!\n\nNow, I believe we may call it a refuge.\n\nCertainly we do not want any term\n\nalluding to unwed mothers in the title.\n\nNor do we wish for the public to know\n\nthe purpose of the house.\n\nBut I've told all my friends I'm helping\n\nto build a home for future bastards.\n\nSorry.\n\n- Home, madam?\n\n- I need some fresh air. Let's drive.\n\nYes, madam.\n\nI think I should see Alec.\n\nHello, Alec.\n\nLet's return to London, please.\n\nI'd rather like to visit\n\nold Windmill Street again.\n\nGood day, madam.\n\nOh.\n\n- Mind your back.\n\n- Oh!\n\n- Oh, Laura, what on earth?\n\n- Margo.\n\nRenovations, dear.\n\n- But it's a...\n\n- Theatre.\n\nIt's a theatre. Isn't it delicious?\n\n- I own it.\n\n- Own it?\n\nYou told me now there was no-one\n\nto stop me from buying things,\n\nso I bought a theatre.\n\nI meant bracelets and earrings.\n\nWhat on earth are you going to do\n\nwith a theatre?\n\nWell, I thought music hall, or - what do\n\nthey call it in America - vaudeville?\n\nActually, I haven't thought about it.\n\nOh, dear.\n\nWhat am I going to do with it?\n\nClearly you need someone\n\nto run it for you.\n\nOh, you think?\n\nOh, I knew you'd give me\n\nsensible advice.\n\nBut who?\n\nWell, that's an easy assignment.\n\nI know just the man.\n\nHe's out of work at the moment,\n\nbut he's very good at running theatres.\n\nI can't imagine where she is.\n\nShe was meant to be here\n\n20 minutes ago.\n\nWell...\n\n...that's that, then.\n\nI can't hang around here all morning.\n\nI've an important meeting to go to.\n\n- I'm sorry, old chum...\n\n- Oh, he was terribly ill in the car.\n\nNerves, I imagine. Little sweet!\n\nHello, Leslie.\n\n- Hello.\n\nWhoon earth are you?\n\n- This is Vivian Van Damm.\n\n- Don't be silly.\n\nThat's not a British name.\n\nIn actual fact,\n\nmy father's a lawyer in Bishopsgate.\n\nAlthough some of his ancestors\n\nare from Holland.\n\n- Oh, dear God, you're Jewish!\n\n- As it happens, I'm not.\n\nWell, of course you are, dear.\n\nJust look at yourself.\n\nThe show business is filled with Jewish\n\npeople, isn't it? One must make do.\n\nWe haven't met. I'm Laura Henderson.\n\nYes, I imagined you were.\n\nYou're 20 minutes late,\n\nand you're rude.\n\n- Perhaps he's the wrong man.\n\n- No, I don't think so.\n\nWhere are you going?\n\nLeslie, where is he off to? Do stop him.\n\nI'm here tooffer you a position!\n\nYou can't offer me a position\n\nif I'm walking out on you.\n\nBut that's why I'm offering it, dear.\n\nYou've got gumption.\n\nOh, don't you adore that word?\n\nAnd you're smoking a cigar.\n\nAnyone who runs my theatre\n\nmust smoke a cigar.\n\nIt's so manly. And so...\n\nWhat?\n\nJewish.\n\nI have a theatre.\n\nI have a theatre.\n\nIt's just sitting there,\n\nwaiting for a brilliant manager\n\nto come and turn it into\n\na commercial proposition.\n\nA manager who might bring\n\nsome enjoyment and amusement\n\nback into the West End.\n\nA manager with vision and courage.\n\nAnd if that isn't you,\n\nthen my intuition has failed me.\n\nSo, by all means, hurry off,\n\nMr Damm Van.\n\nVan Damm.\n\nOh, if you insist, dear. If you insist.\n\nWhose idea was it to gut the building?\n\n- Mine.\n\n- Well, well.\n\nThere should be a sign saying\n\nWindmill Theatre. Up there. See?\n\nYou're going to retain the name?\n\nWell, I find it helps your driver\n\nif the theatre is named after the street.\n\nWhat do you know\n\nabout the theatre business?\n\nAlmost nothing.\n\nI have to have total control\n\nof the production side. Is that clear?\n\nAll artistic decisions are mine.\n\nYou may voice an opinion, if you must,\n\nbut I have the final say.\n\n- Understood?\n\n- Of course.\n\nI think we'll make a splendid team.\n\nLet's go and sit down\n\nin that charming little caf.\n\nI'm sure its business will improve\n\nwhen our musical revue opens.\n\nWho said we were doing\n\na musical revue?\n\nWell, I assumed.\n\nAll those decisions are mine.\n\nRemember?\n\nThat's perfect. Just there.\n\nHigher.\n\nNo. No, no, no. Come back.\n\nCome back to the middle.\n\nHigher.\n\nHigher.\n\nFine. I've had an idea. Let's go inside.\n\nIt is a radical idea.\n\nOh, jolly good. What is it?\n\nNon-stop performances.\n\n- Non-stop?\n\n- Yes.\n\nInstead of two shows a day,\n\nwe run our show all day long.\n\nFive or six performances a day,\n\none after another.\n\nIt's never been done in England before.\n\nEvery theatre here\n\nis exactly like every other theatre.\n\nNo-one is attempting anything new.\n\nIt's good to stir things up,\n\ndon't you think?\n\nWe'd be a sensation.\n\nI've no idea what you're on about,\n\nbut I do admire passion.\n\nYes, well... what else is there?\n\nHow much will this experiment cost?\n\nI mean,\n\nwhat do I stand to lose if it fails?\n\nWell, anything up to er... 10,000.\n\nWhat fun!\n\nI'm in a sporting mood today,\n\nMr Van Damm. It must be the weather.\n\n- And what'll we do?\n\n- A musical revue.\n\nWhat will we call it?\n\nWell, I thought Revudeville.\n\nOh, yes!\n\nThat's lovely.\n\nLadies and gentlemen...\n\n...I've invited you here this evening\n\nto sip a bit of sherry -\n\nI'm told cocktail parties\n\nare out-of-date -\n\nand to announce\n\nthe most amusing news.\n\nThe Windmill Theatre\n\nwill open on February 3rd,\n\nwith the most revolutionary programme\n\never seen in England.\n\nIn this enterprise, I shall be carrying on\n\nthe work of my late husband,\n\nwho spent a great deal of time\n\nand money helping stage people,\n\nespecially those in the field of variety.\n\n- Is that true?\n\n- She's making it up.\n\nOh.\n\nAs you well know,\n\nthese are difficult times,\n\nso many of our delightful"
