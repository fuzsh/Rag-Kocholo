        "text": "Weinstein, who co-founded Miramax Films, says Dench was turned down for interviews by NBC’s Today show, and ABC’s Good Morning America and The View.\n\n“They said that she didn’t fit their demographics,” the outspoken movie mogul told this week’s edition of New York magazine.\n\n“I told that to my mother, who was pretty ... offended,” he said. “I mean, what do they think, 25-year-old people can’t watch 70-year-old people? The insanity of youth. It also assumes none of us like our families.”\n\nThe International House of Publicity, which promoted Mrs Henderson Presents, declined to comment.\n\nBill Geddie, executive producer of The View, said Dame Judi had appeared a number of times on the show, including to promote Shakespeare in Love.\n\nThe British star won an Oscar for her performance in the 1998 film.\n\n“I was never pitched Dame Judi Dench to appear on The View in support of Mrs Henderson Presents, and we would welcome her back to the show anytime we have an opening,” Geddie said.\n\nBridgette Maney, a spokeswoman for Good Morning America, released a statement that neither confirmed nor denied that Dame Judi was turned down.\n\n“Good Morning America welcomes a wide array of guests to the program each and every day. Judi Dench is a screen legend,” the statement said.\n\nA spokesman for the Today show did not respond to a request for comment."
