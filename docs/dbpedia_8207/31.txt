Arsenal have missed out on Champions League qualification for the first time in 20 years after they were pipped to a top four place by Liverpool and Manchester City on the final day.

The Gunners needed to beat Everton and hope that either the Reds dropped points against Middlesbrough or for City to suffer a heavy defeat at Watford.

But Liverpool secured a 3-0 win and City strolled to a 5-0 victory at Vicarage Road, rendering the Gunners' 3-1 triumph over Everton irrelevant.

That meant that Arsene Wenger's side finish the season in fifth place.

This is the first time that the Gunners have missed out on the top four since the 1995-96 season, when Bruce Rioch was in charge at Highbury.

Next season will be the first time that Arsenal will not play in the Champions League since the 1997/98 season, when the Premier League had only two places in Europe's premier club competition.

The Gunners' fifth place finish marks the worst Premier League season under Arsene Wenger, who has been the subject of a barrage of criticism and fan protests this season.

They will now enter the Europa League at the group stage next season.

Liverpool return to the Champions League for the first time since the 2014/15 season and will only the second time in eight years, while City will be playing in the Champions League for the sixth season in a row.
