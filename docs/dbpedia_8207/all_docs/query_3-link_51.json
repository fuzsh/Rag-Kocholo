        "text": "Liverpool's club record haul of 97 points would have won them the title on 25 different seasons since the Premier League began back in 1992.\n\nBut their 29-year wait to be crowned domestic kings will now enter a third decade after Manchester City pipped them to the post in the most remarkable Premier League season of all time.\n\nOnly twice has a team bettered their tally - that was City last season when they recorded 100 points and now this year too.\n\nPep Guardiola's side are champions once again after they produced an emphatic turnaround at the AMEX Stadium to beat Brighton 4-1.\n\nIt meant they edged Liverpool out by just one point - despite the Reds only losing one game all season, back in January to City.\n\nAnfield enjoyed premature celebrations early on during the final day of the season, thanks to Sadio Mane's early goal over Wolves - and Glenn Murray's shock opening goal against City.\n\nBut the champions responded superbly and managed to cut short Liverpool's hopes of a second miracle on Merseyside this week as Sergio Aguero and Aymeric Laporte put them ahead at half-time.\n\nRiyad Mahrez and Ilkay Gundogan wrapped things up for City as Liverpool were left to ponder what might have been after finishing runners-up for only the fourth time in Premier League history.\n\nLiverpool last won the league back in 1990 and their agonising wait for a 19th title continues.\n\nKlopp's side will now look to finish their memorable campaign on a high when they take on Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League Final in Madrid on June 1.\n\nThere was some consolation for Liverpool, however, with two-goal hero Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah sharing the Golden Boot award with Arsenal's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after scoring 22 goals this season.\n\nTHE SEASONS IN WHICH LIVERPOOL WOULD HAVE WON THE TITLE"
