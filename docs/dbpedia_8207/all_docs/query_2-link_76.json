        "text": "Alex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nSince its launch in 1992, the Premier League has played host to several thrilling rivalries.\n\nWhich have been the best battles in this Premier League era?\n\nManchester United inevitably dominate this list, having finished in the top three in every season since 1992-93, as champions 13 times and as runners-up six times.\n\nThe criteria for ranking the rivalries is that the teams had to have finished in the top two places together in the Premier League table for two seasons or more.\n\nMichael Regan/Getty Images\n\nAfter Manchester City were taken over by Sheikh Mansour and his incredible wealth in 2008 it was inevitable they would eventually pose a threat to their neighbours Manchester United.\n\nBy the 2011-12 season City had assembled a highly impressive squad that under Roberto Mancini put together a real challenge for the title.\n\nOn the final day of the season City simply needed to beat Queens Park Rangers at home to win the title, but as they entered injury time found themselves trailing 2-1.\n\nThis would mean United, who were winning 1-0 at Sunderland would take the title, and when their game ended at the Stadium of Light for a matter of minutes, they were indeed the champions-elect.\n\nBut back at the Etihad Stadium, late goals from Edin Dzeko and Sergio Aguero wrestled the title away from United in the Premier League’s most dramatic ever climax to a season.\n\nThe following season City put up a poor defence of their title and United, buoyed by the signing of Robin van Persie, reasserted their authority to win the title with an 11-point margin over their city rivals.\n\nClive Brunskill/Getty Images\n\nAt the birth of the Premier League, Manchester United’s most serious competition was provided by Blackburn Rovers.\n\nBlackburn were promoted to the top flight for the first time in 26 years in 1992 and finished a credible fourth in their first season in the Premier League.\n\nThe following season it was Kenny Dalglish’s side fuelled by Alan Shearer’s goals who most threatened United’s defence of the Premier League title.\n\nRovers handed United a rare defeat at Ewood Park in April 1994, but Sir Alex Ferguson’s side still finished the season eight points ahead of them.\n\nIn the 1994-95 season United and Blackburn fought out an epic battle for the title, which went all the way down to the final day of the season.\n\nBlackburn would lose 2-1 to Liverpool at Anfield, but United’s failure to get more than a 1-1 draw at West Ham meant Blackburn took their first title in 79 years by a single point.\n\nAlex Livesey/Getty Images\n\nBetween 2004-05 and 2010-11 Manchester United and Chelsea dominated the Premier League.\n\nThe arrival of Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2004 signalled the start of this new rivalry.\n\nIn his first season Mourinho immediately toppled reigning champions Arsenal, but in his second season it was United who provided the opposition and finished as runners-up to Chelsea.\n\nIt was thought Mourinho—backed by Roman Abramovich’s seemingly bottomless pot of money—would prove to be unbeatable, but United stormed back with the youthful talents of Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo to win a hat-trick of titles between 2007 and 2009.\n\nChelsea had finished as runners-up to United in 2007 and in 2008 under Avram Grant’s charge before reclaiming the title in 2010 under Carlo Ancelotti by a single point over United.\n\nIn the 2010-11 campaign United and Chelsea competed for the title again before Sir Alex Ferguson’s men finished nine points ahead of the south London side."
