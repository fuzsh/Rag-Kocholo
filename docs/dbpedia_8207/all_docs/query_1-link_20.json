        "text": "Boise, Idaho (Via US Youth Soccer) – Two days of play remain at the 2015 US Youth Soccer Region IV Championships after qarterfinal matches were completed today. Of the 238 teams that began the tournament, the dreams of 56 remain alive in the Under-12 through Under-18 Boys and Girls age groups.\n\nUnder-19 Girls FC Nova National (ID) became the first US Youth Soccer Region IV champion from the state of Idaho by defeating FRAM (CA-S) 5-1 in the finals. FC Nova National will be the first Idaho team to advance to the National Championships since Boise Nationals Italia (ID) advanced as a Region IV Representative in 2013.\n\nThe Under-19 Boys final will be a rematch of the opening game at the 2014 US Youth Soccer National Championships as Scottsdale 96 Blackhawks Burke (AZ) will take on defending regional and national champions, Santa Barbara SC White (CA-S).\n\nTwo local Idaho teams advanced to the semifinals as Under-14 Girls FC Nova (ID) defeated CUFC Elite 4-2, and Under-18 Girls BNSC Premier (ID) beat NM Rush 97 (NM) 2-1.\n\nUnder-13 Girls So Cal Blues Baker (CA-S) continued its quest for a second straight region title with a 6-0 win over Scottsdale Soccer 02 Blackhawks (AZ) as Isabella DAquila scores a hat trick. Joining So Cal in the semifinals will be Washington Premier 01 (WA), Eagles SC (CA-S) and Capital FC Timbers 2001 (OR)\n\nUnder-16 Girls feature a match between the two most recent region champions in Pride Predators 99 (CO and Eastside FC 98 Red (WA). Both teams qualified to the National Championships via the US Youth Soccer National League, but this year both teams’ last shot at qualifying to the National Championships were through winning the Region IV Championships. Eastside kept those hopes alive with a 2-1 victory in overtime. Pride’s Brianna Alger broke the scoreless stalemate in the 29th minute, and Olivia Van Der Jagt launched a left-footed rocket into the top corner in response. Ultimately it was Laura Roberts who scored the game-winner in overtime.\n\nUnder-17 Boys Santa Barbara SC White (CA-S) defeated BNSC Liverpool (ID) 5-2 as the team seeks out a fifth regional title. Joining Santa Barbara will be Scottsdale Soccer 98 Burke (AZ), South San Jose PAC Indios (CA-N) and DMS 11 Academy (CA-S).\n\nUnder-18 LVSA 97 Red (NV) advances to the semifinals with a 2-0 win over CCV Stars 97 Black (AZ) thanks to goals from Jackson Dietrich and Tristian Blackmon. LVSA will join Albion SC White South (CA-S), Westside Timbers 96 Copa (OR) and 2013 regional champ FC Golden State White (CA-S) in the semifinals/\n\nThe US Youth Soccer National Championship Series (State, Regional and National Championships) creates a unique environment where any team is open to compete, but only those that earn their way can progress to the next stage until the National Champion is decided. That environment attracts scouts from universities, professional teams and U.S. Soccer National Teams looking for players that can move on to the next level of play.\n\nNotes on today’s games\n\nUnder-13 Boys\n\nLVSA 02 Red narrowly defeated Maui United Soccer Club 2002 (HI) 2-1 to advance to the semifinals. Andy Gonzales put LVSA up 1-0 just eight minutes into the match, but Aikalaokekainalu Chappell returned the favor in the 30th minute to tie things up. Gonzales was at it again in the 48th minute to put LVSA up for good 2-1.\n\nAfter scoring six goals in the final group match, PacNW Maroon (WA) continued its scoring momentum into the quarterfinals with a 5-3 win over NM Rush 02 (NM). Rush had its hands full with PacNW’s Alec Diaz, who scored four goals in the match to put him with seven in the tournament. Wylie Trujillo, Aidan Semelsberger and Joshua Rael attempted to bring Rush within striking distance, but Diaz’s performance, along with a goal from Callan Hercules proved too much for the New Mexico side.\n\nPateadores LA 01 won a closely contested match against Westside Timbers 01 Copa (OR) 1-0 to advance to the next round. Allan Jarquin scored the only goal of the match, and the Pateadores defense put forth its first shutout of the tournament.\n\nEC Real Galaxy FC 01 (CA-N) spoiled the possibility of having two Pateadores teams in the semifinals with a 1-0 win over Pateadores IER PDA (CA-S). Abraham Montano scored the match’s only goal, and the Galaxy defense shut out a Pateadores team that scored 16 goals in three group matches.\n\nUnder-14 Boys\n\nSJ Earthquakes PDA 01 (CA-N) managed to hold off a late surge against West Coast FC Armour (CA-S) to claim a 3-2 victory. SJ Earthquakes appeared to be in cruise control after getting out to a 3-0 lead thanks to goals from Ricardo Ibarra, Miguel Najar Miranda and Fabian Rodriguez. However, West Coast refused to go away as two late goals made things very interesting. Blake Bowen scored for West Coast in the 67th, and Alexis Vasquez brought SJ Earthquakes’ lead to just one, but 2014 region finalists were able to prevent an equalizer to advance to the semifinals.\n\nMatching up against SJ Earthquakes will be HSC Bulls Academy I 01 (HI), who defeated Heat FC 01 (NV) 3-1. Gabriel Trujillo got Heat out to an early lead with a goal in the ninth minute, but Justin Takada equalized for HSC just three minutes later. Max Moonier gave HSC the lead in the 23rd minute, and Nichols La Manna added a third shortly before halftime, and neither team was able to find the back of the net in the second half.\n\nRio Rapids SC 01 (NM) secured a spot in the semifinals with a 3-1 victory over FC Alliance 00A (WA). FC Alliance got out to an early 1-0 courtesy of Manuel Segura Sandova’s sixth minute goal, but Rio Rapids was able to knot things at one with Skylor Rose’s goal in the 35th minute. Things looked to be heading to overtime until Jayson Baca broke the tie in the 69th minute, and Rose added his second a minute later to guarantee a spot in the semifinals.\n\nSparta 01 JK rounds out the semifinals field due to a 2-0 win over Tanque Verde 01 Blue (AZ). Two goals in the final minutes fueled the victory as Brandon Cervantes scored in the 68th minute, and Fabian Gonzalez Limones doubled Sparta’s lead in the final minute.\n\nUnder-15 Girls\n\nLa Roca Premier PO defeated Rush 00 (HI) 8-1 in a match that included U.S. Under-17 National Team player Olivia Wade netting a hat trick to give her seven on the tournament.\n\nPalo Alto 00 Blue (CA-N) needed overtime to defeat Sparta United 00 Premier (UT) 2-0. Nicole Salz and Laura Fuentes scored within six minutes of each other in overtime to punch a ticket to the semifinals.\n\nAlbion SC White (CA-S) used three second half goals against LV Neon 00 Academy (NV) to propel itself into the semfinals as Abigail Bates, Diamond Quinn and Raemi DeWent all found the back of the net after the 60th minute.\n\nUnder-16 Boys\n\nSeattle United 98 Copa (WA) earned a trip to the semifinals with a 3-1 win over West Coast Wyss (CA-S). All four goals were scored after the 60th minute as Ian Mejia began the scoring for Seattle United in the 62nd minute, only for West Coast to respond with Michael Oakson’s goal three minutes later. Mejia again broke the tie in the 73rdminute, and Samuel Agosti added an insurance goal for Seattle.\n\nScottsdale Blackhawks 99 Davidson (AZ) avenged last year’s 1-0 regionals loss by edging out La Roca TJ (UT) with a 1-0 victory to nab a spot in the semifinals. Aidan Williams scored the game’s only goal in the 14th minute, and a Blackhawks defense that only surrendered one goal in group play shut out the Utah side.\n\nSanta Clara Sporting 98 Green (CA-N) defeated USA 99 Premier (UT) 3-1 in a battle of 2014 region semifinalists. Oscar Garcia’s ninth minute strike gave USA the early lead, but a first half brace from Alejandro Barajas gave Sporting the lead heading into halftime. Joshua Marquez tacked on an insurance goal in the 58th minute to finalize the 3-1 win.\n\nSanta Clara’s semifinals opponent, Albion SC Garton (CA-S) also had to overcome a deficit in order to advance to the next round as Albion defeated Rio Rapids SC 99 (NM) 2-1. Charles Touche scored for Rio Rapids right before halftime, but shortly after the intermission Albion’s David Chavarin found the equalizer. Ziad Badr’s 66th minute goal would be game-winner as Albion will take on Santa Clara in a clash of California teams in the semifinals.\n\nUnder-17Girls\n\nLa Roca Premier (UT) continued the state’s impressive tournament with a 4-0 win over Northwest Nationals 97 Red (WA) thanks to a Haley Stafford brace and goals from Regyn Youngberg and Paige Stevens.\n\nArizona Arsenal 98 Premier Teal (AZ) defeated West Coast Wild (CA-N) 3-1 to reserve a spot in the semifinals. Ashlyn Lovell and Hannah Householder scored for Arsenal right before halftime, but Autumn Smithers reduced Arsenal’s lead to 1 with a goal in the 76th minute. Householder then added her second goal of the match in the 87thminute to secure the win.\n\nLegends FC 97 (CA-S) and 98 Celtic FC Premier (UT) both put forth convincing quarterfinal performances as Legends defeated ETFC Roma (OR) 6-0, and Celtic defeated NM Rush 98 (NM) 8-0. The teams will square off tomorrow in the semifinals.\n\nUnder-18 Girls\n\nLa Roca PO (UT) put forth a strong performance in a 4-0 win vs CDA Sting Premier (ID). Four different La Roca players scored as Eden Jacobsen, Morgan Tatton, Natalie Reynolds and Averie Collins all found the back of the net for the Utah squad.\n\nLa Roca’s semifinals opponent, Eastside FC 96 Red (WA) used a 73rd minute goal from Megan Barwick to propel the Washington team to a 1-0 victory over Players 97 Elite (NV).\n\nAfter qualifying to the quarterfinals yesterday via a kicks from the mark tiebreaker, BNSC Premier (ID) defeated NM Rush 97 (NM) 2-1 to move to the semifinals. Elena Gurule got Rush off to a dream start with a goal in the first minute, but BNSC’s Bailey Watson retaliated with a goal of her own in the ninth minute. The 1-1 score would hold until the 56nd minute when Sierra Smith gave the local side a 2-1 lead that it would hold on to.\n\nBNSC will take on another New Mexico team as Rio Rapids SC 97 (NM) earned the final spot in the semifinals with a 2-1 win over Santa Clara Sporting 96 Green (CA-N). Overcoming early deficits has turned into a theme for semifinals teas as Sporting took the lead with Ashley Kirchick’s goal in the 25th minute. Jordyn Lacy would be the hero for Rio Rapids as her second half brace gave Rio Rapids the late lead, and ultimately a spot in the semifinals.\n\nUnder-19 Boys\n\nScottsdale 96 Blackhawks Burke (AZ) continued their quest to return to the National Championships with a 2-0 win over Santa Clara Sporting 95 Green (CA-N). Jose Carlos Fierro Pineda began the scoring in the 13th minute, and Grant Galan added a late equalizer to secure a date with defending region and national champs Santa Barbara SC White (CA-S), who had a little bit of trouble making it back to a second straight region final.\n\nWestside Timbers 95 Copa (OR) struck first in the 11th minute when Alejandro Segovia sent a left-footed laser into the near post. The score would remain 1-0 all the way until the 73rd minute when 2014 National Championships Golden Ball winner, Geoffrey Acheampong’s free-kick found fellow 2014 National Championships Best XI player, and Top Drawer Soccer Freshman of the Year, Abu Danladi for the point blank goal. Overtime would be required, and both teams found the back of the net as Timbers’ Julio Miranded finished off a back-heeled pass in the first overtime period, but again it was Santa Barbara’s Acheampong responding this time by finishing off a free-kick that bounced around in the box. The match would need kicks from the mark to decide a winner, and after two-straight saves from Santa Barbara keeper Eric Kam, Achempong cemented his team’s trip to the finals by chipping his shot past the keeper.\n\nUnder-19 Girls Final FC Nova National (ID) vs FRAM (CA-S)\n\nFRAM’s Allison Arriola began the scoring just one minute into the match, but after Grace Hancock responded just two minutes later for the Idaho squad, it was all FC Nova National as an Allegra Weeks brace combined with goals from Margaret Saras and Hallie Widner gave FC Nova National the 5-1 victory and a trip to the National Championships.\n\nThe US Youth Soccer National Championships will consist of US Youth Soccer Regional Champions in the Under-13 through Under-19 Boys and Girls age groups as well as the US Youth Soccer National League qualifiers in the Under-15 through Under-18 Boys and Girls age groups to complete the field of 96 teams.\n\nDaily reports and complete results from the tournament are available on http://championships. usyouthsoccer.org.
