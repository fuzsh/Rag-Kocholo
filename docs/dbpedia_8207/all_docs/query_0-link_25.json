        "text": "Arsenal are one of the most successful clubs in English football with a strong global fanbase. Founded in 1886, the club is nicknamed The Gunners.\n\nThe North London club has won 13 English top-flight league titles, only behind Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (19). After the inception of the Premier League in 1992, Arsenal won three league titles - in 1997-98, 2001-02 and 2003-04 - all under French manager Arsene Wenger.\n\nThe Gunners also hold the record for the longest run of unbeaten league matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004). This included all 38 matches of their title-winning 2003–04 season. This campaign is remembered as the club’s ‘Invincibles’ year.\n\nArsenal, under manager Mikel Arteta, finished second in the English Premier League 2023 season - their best finish since 2004.\n\nArsenal’s first Premier League title in 1997-98\n\nArsenal won their first Premier League title during the 1997-98 season. This was their first league title under Arsene Wenger and the club’s first in seven years. It also marked the 100th season of competitive football played by Arsenal.\n\nArsenal started the season well but a run of three defeats in four matches between November and December left the team in sixth position and virtually out of championship contention.\n\nTrailing 12 points behind reigning champions Manchester United at the end of February, Arsenal stitched together a winning streak of 10 matches to win the title with two games to spare. Denis Bergkamp, Marc Overmars and Ian Wright together notched up 38 league goals in that season.\n\nArsenal’s Premier League title in 2001-02\n\nArsenal ended Manchester United’s run of three successive EPL titles by winning the 2001-02 season. The Gunners beat second-placed Liverpool by seven points. They were unbeaten away from home that season and managed the unique feat of scoring in every league game. Thierry Henry became the top goalscorer in the league after netting 24 goals during the season.\n\nArsenal’s Premier League title in 2003-04 - The Invincibles season\n\nArsenal last won the Premier League in 2003-04 and it was truly a special season, not just for the club but English football as a whole. The Gunners registered 26 wins and 12 draws to go through the season undefeated and won the title by 11 points.\n\nIt is famously known as the year of ‘the Invincibles’. No other team has managed to win the EPL title after staying unbeaten for an entire season.\n\nThe Arsene Wenger-managed club were awarded a Gold trophy - the only team to ever win one - instead of the usual silverware. Thierry Henry, with 30 goals, won the Premier League Golden Boot that season.\n\nArsenal in Premier League: Results by each year"
