        "text": "The beginning\n\nIn their first year as a club, Wisbech Town FC joined the Peterborough and Lynn leagues and without an official ground, matches were played at Wisbech Park. Under the captaincy of F. Cole, the club enjoyed quite a successful season and by commendable consistency in the lesser of the two leagues in which they were competing, they won the Lynn League with 17 points from ten matches and the Walsoken and Wisbech Charity Cup from Lynn Swifts. Two trophies to grace the club sideboard was not at all a bad performance for their first season.\n\nIt was obvious from that first season that Wisbech Town F.C. were going to be a force in Fenland football for many years to come.\n\nWisbech Town F.C. 1920/21. Newspaper Archive\n\nIn the club’s second year, matches were played at Rectory Field. In the season 1922-3, Wisbech Town FC rented a field in Harecroft Road belonging to local landowner Mr Overland. A grandstand was erected to enable more people to watch matches and this stand was still in use by the club up to 1990.\n\nThe first of five Peterborough League championships was won in Season 1924/25, the team winning their last eleven games. This season saw the first occasion when Wisbech caused an F.A. Cup upset – beating the Southern Amateur League side Cambridge Town on their own ground by two goals to one.\n\nIn season 1927/28 and the following season the Club again won the Peterborough League, and were now being recognised as a ’power’ in East Anglian football.\n\nIn early January 1928 the Grandstand at Harecroft Road was damaged in a terrific storm and thanks to Mr. Horace Friend, a true supporter of the Club, the stand was re-erected to its original length, and in addition a glass side was fitted to windward, and the seats were boarded up as a protection against draughts. These improvements were much appreciated and one hopes that all users of the stand who have not yet made their contribution to the fund will do so without delay.\n\nPhoto of the grand stand roof from a newspaper report. Newspaper Archive\n\nIt was decided by the Wisbech Town Football Club Committee to change the Clubs “Change Colours” from Black & White stripes to Green jerseys. It was the custom then for the home team to change if the colours clashed.\n\nLeading goalscorers for Wisbech in the 1920’s were Cyril Wright with 151 to his credit followed by Ted Cozens with 94. Most appearances came from full-back Joe brown with 258.\n\nWisbech Town FC in 1928-9. Wisbech & Fenland Museum\n\nThe 1930s were an amazing decade for the team, seeing in many changes from the start. The 1930- 31 season Wisbech Town FC came 5th in the table in the Peterborough League., but for the very first time, the team reached the First Round proper of the F.A. Amateur Cup. They played at home against a London side, Hayes to a record-breaking ground capacity of 2500 supporters, but lost 1- 6. At this time the team were known as 'The Poppies', due to the distinctive red and white kit, this name was chosen over ‘the Strawberry Pickers’ and the ‘Canners’, influenced by Wisbech's industries.\n\nThe Cambs Challenge Cup was won for the first time this season with an 8 – 2 win over R.A.F. Duxford.\n\nThe Wisbech Town FC Supporters Club was established on 30 September 1930 and is still going strong today. Football is very much part of our community with supporters at the heart of the club.\n\nThe following season, 1931/32 the Peterborough League was won yet again and a “Cup Double” – the Hinchingbrooke Cup, a 6 – 3 win over St. Neots and a 5 - 2 win over Spalding United to take the Clegg Cup. The afore-mentioned Cup was a very prestigious competition to win and the trophy itself was mentioned as being second only in value to the F.A. Cup.\n\nWinners of the Hinchingbrooke Cup in 1932-3. Wisbech & Fenland Museum\n\nWisbech Town FC reached the 2nd round of the F.A. Amateur Cup during the 1932-3 season and won four trophies: the Peterborough League title, the Hinchingbrooke Cup, Peterborough Senior Cup and the Wisbech Charity Cup. A record breaking 218 goals were scored this season. Two players, Eddie Youles and Bert Titmarsh scored 119 of the goals between them.\n\nBert Titmarsh is the record goalscorer for Wisbech Town with 245 goals in total from 278 appearances.\n\nIn 1935 the club was elevated from an amateur side to playing semi-professional football and became Wisbech Town Football Club Ltd. The Company subscribers were from the local area and included fruit growers, bulb growers, a Cold Storage Director, farmers, as well as clerks, a Railway Foreman and a School master.\n\nEntry was made into the United Counties League and a Secretary-Coach-Player was appointed. Ex-West Ham player Sam Jennings was appointed in August and the first team was soon getting fit for the new season aided by professional players such as Eddie Earle, Reg Blackham and Jack Jenkinson.\n\nA good start to the season was tempered by the fact that Jennings had no say on the selection of the team, which was being done by a committee formed from the Directors. Some of the team selections amazed the supporters as the committee picked their favourites, even the local Press sympathised with Jennings’ position which unfortunately became untenable.\n\nThird in the United Counties League was an achievement considering the upheaval in mid-season with the local Press giving an opinion that second-place could have been attained if Jennings had stayed,\n\nEddie Earle with the assistance of Bert Barker took over the management the following season, Earle insisting on having the final say on selection of the team.\n\nThe first trophy as a semi-professional club came when the ‘Poppies’ won the United Counties League Cup, held over from last season due to fixture congestion. On Saturday, November 21st, at Harecroft Road, Wisbech defeated Biggleswade Town by three goals to two in the final. However, the club’s tenure on the trophy only lasted three weeks as Stamford won a first round match in early December.\n\nFourth place in the United Counties League was attained in 1936/37. The club also entered the East Midlands League, which was a supplementary competition to the UCL and finished mid-table.\n\nMr. Horace Friend donated a cup to be played for and assist the North Cambs Hospital. Lynn Town were the first opposition and a record ‘gate’ of 3,045 watched as Wisbech town became the first holders of the trophy with a 4 – 0 win over their long-time rivals.\n\nWisbech Town 1936/37 with the North Cambs Hospital Cup. Newspaper Archive\n\nThere being no radio or TV coverage in those days, whenever the Town played away both local newspaper offices windows would be surrounded by eager supporters waiting for the result to be posted in the window.\n\nA crowd waiting outside the Wisbech Standard Offices in Nene Quay awaiting the Town’s result to be posted up. Newspaper Archive\n\nA well-known and popular figure in Wisbech, former St. Augustine’s forward and County player Algy Newitt took over as Manager, with Bert Barker as assistant.\n\nAnother season of contrasting fortunes on the pitch, the best run so far in the F.A. Cup. Reaching the Fourth Qualifying Round for the first time, losing to Lowestoft Town in a match the ‘Poppies’ dominated, but lost to a dubious penalty. In the United Counties League fourth place once again in a campaign typified by the teams start, one point from the first five matches, then a nine goals to one win at St. Neots. One could never be sure how the team would play!\n\nThere was also mediocre performance’s in the East Midlands League through the season; one unfortunate result was a ten goals to four defeat away at Wellingborough.\n\nHowever, Watford sent a strong team to play the Town for the North Cambs Hospital Cup, a ‘gate’ of 2,000 watched the Football League side win by three goals to nil. Another result of note was a two goals to nil win over Lynn Town at The Walks in a Charity Cup Final in May.\n\nWisbech Town First XI v Watford 1938/39 Wisbech Town on left. Watford on right. Newspaper Archive\n\nBy the end of the 1930's everything began to change with war beginning in Europe. The 1938-9 season was the last full season before the outbreak of World War II.\n\nCrawford Whyte, a full-back from Clapton Orient, was appointed player-manager and efforts are to be made to build a team that will challenge keenly for the championship.\n\nPre-season training had gone well and there was a feeling of real optimism about the new season which was justified with a sensational start which saw mighty Rushden Town humbled at Harecroft Road by four goals to one. The “Russians” even left a player who failed to board their bus, a wing-half by the name of Bland, who had to hitch-hike the forty odd miles home. The following Saturday Wisbech travelled to Rushden for the return East Midlands League fixture, another sensation, Wisbech returned victorious by five goals to one.\n\nAll was looking good for a splendid season; however, the outbreak of War brought an end to the UCL Competition. Wisbech Town and Spalding United were refused admission due to travelling restrictions to a War-time League, which was a fifty-mile radius of Northampton. This league eventually closed down the following January. The East Midlands League also closed down. The Town applied for admission to the Midland League, but this was also refused.\n\nSo the Club embarked on a series of friendly matches and one match result of note was three goals to one win over an Army XI who had eight West Ham first-team players in the side.\n\nEventually admission was gained to the East Anglian Emergency League and the Reserves joined the Peterborough War League. On October 21st the Player – manager left to become an Army P.T. Instructor, he had become a popular figure in the short time he was with the club and had fully justified the Director’s faith in his abilities. Only one team was run from December onwards due to players joining the Armed Forces.\n\nThe player making the most appearance in the 1930’s was a very popular school teacher – Bob Harriman with 280 appearances for the first eleven.\n\nFor Season 1940/41, the club benefited by the introduction of several Football League players who were serving in the Forces and based locally. The East Anglian Emergency League was entered, the team finishing as runners-up to Cambridge Town. The Peterborough War League did not run.\n\nThe East Anglian Cup Final was reached losing by two goals to three to Ford Sports. At the end of May, a Norwich City XI were beaten by nine goals to one in the Hospital Cup. The season went on and as late as June 14th, an RAF XI were beaten by nine goals to nil in a friendly match. Only one match was played the next season before it was decided to end proceedings until hostilities ceased.\n\nAfter the war\n\nThe season’s after the Second World War can rightfully be called the “Glory Years” as the Wisbech Town Football Club enjoyed apparelled success.\n\nThree United Counties League Championships and once runners-up put the “Poppies” on the national football map as the Club prospered. And in this first season after the conflict the Club reached the First Round Proper of the F.A. Cup for the very first time.\n\nIn the qualifying rounds, Newmarket Town were the visitor’s in October that year and went away losing 5 – 0, Wild scored four, Hanley the fifth. Wild later signed for Manchester United. Cambridge Town were next and in a bad-tempered game Wisbech won 3 – 1, Hanley, Pownall and an own goal, the first for the Club in 17 years of playing in the competition.\n\nSouthern League side Colchester United were the fourth qualifying round opposition and in front of 2,748 spectators they could not match the home side who scored five goals without reply. Pownall 2, Cory 2 & Roberts scored for Wisbech. Communications at that time were not back to normal and the result did not reach F.A. Headquarters in time for the Draw for the First Round. Assuming that the team from a higher status league had won the tie, the F.A. paired Colchester United with Ipswich Town in the First Round. Matters were soon resolved and Wisbech entertained the Division Three (South) club on November 17th 1945. Before a crowd of 4,302 spectators, Wisbech lost the first “leg” by three goals to nil. This was the first game of the season that the team had failed to score. The result was a great disappointment to all Wisbechian’s as well as to the many hundreds who came from all parts of the district. However, Gate and Grandstand receipts for the match soared to the new record of £351 5s 6d (£351- 27½p).\n\nThis was the only season the Rounds Proper were played over two legs up to the semi-final stages, so on November 24th the Club met Ipswich Town at Portman Road; 10,598 spectators watched the home side score five without reply.\n\nDespite the lack of away support the “Poppies” finished in third place in the United Counties League and on Saturday October 27th the clubs record score of 18 goals to one was achieved at Harecroft Road over once-mighty Rushden Town, goalscorers in this match were Archie Livingstone 7, Hanley 4, Pownall 3, Roberts 2, Cory and Ken Melton.\n\nIn Season 1946/47 the Club appointed ex-Oldham player Bert Blackshaw as Player/manager at a wage of £4 - 00 a week and the team made a tremendous start to their United Counties League campaign, winning the first six matches with a goal difference of 29 for to 7 against. The first defeat was a single goal reverse at Desborough. The return fixture was the following week and revenge was enacted to the tune of seven goals to nil. The Christmas games with Lynn Town were both convincingly won. However, the Linnets took Wisbech to three games in the United Counties League Cup before losing at The Walks before a then record gate of 5,201. Town lost by four goals to one away to Rushden Town in the Final. The F.A. Cup was not entered this season.\n\nIn September land in Lerowe Road was purchased for £2,000 for a new football ground and work started in preparation for the next season.\n\nThe winter of 1947 was particularly harsh and with many postponements the season was extended until early June and the race for the championship was between Wisbech and Kettering Town Reserves. On May 30th Kettering Reserves beat Holbeach United by eighteen goals to nil which meant that Wisbech had to win by three clear goals in their last match of the season to be played the following Saturday against Eynesbury Rovers.\n\nWisbech won the championship after winning by five goals to nil in the last-ever first team game at Harecroft Road before a ‘gate’ of 1,628.\n\nWisbech Town 1946/47.

Fenland Park is the name agreed.\n\nSefton Park, The Fenland Stadium amongst others, had been put forward for the name for the new ground, as work went on throughout the close season to get the pitch and a perimeter fence ready for the first game. The removal of the Grandstand, dressing rooms and other equipment from Harecroft Road had cost the football club over £600 and there had been doubts expressed as to the legality of the Grandstand removal. Plans exist for a new Grandstand with dressing rooms underneath to be built on the opposite side of the ground but a licence to build the structure was refused by the Ministry of War.\n\nThe opening match went ahead without due ceremony on Saturday August 30th against Leicester City “A” for whom Hines opened the scoring in the 28th minute before a ‘gate’ of 2,644.\n\nThe first Wisbech goal was scored by Manager Bert Blackshaw in the 42nd minute. A three – two defeat was Wisbech Towns only home defeat of the season as they stormed to the United Counties League title in great style.

In a hectic last four weeks the first team played sixteen games including a benefit match against Norwich City for Bert Blackshaw, who decided to relinquish his player-manager role after breaking his leg in a match at Spalding on April 15th. Over 6,000 spectators paid tribute at this match and Bert remained in the town becoming well known as a physiotherapist at the North Cambs Hospital.\n\nOn hearing that it would be doubtful if he would ever play again, Bert Blackshaw donated his football boots to Heinz Tamborski who scored two goals playing with them in the return match with Spalding United.\n\nThe Final of the East Anglian Cup was reached losing by a single goal away at Chelmsford.

The previous season he had been playing for Peterborough United.\n\nOnce again the Championship of the United Counties League was won. An eight-match un-beaten run at the end of the season ensured enough points to stay ahead of challengers Rushden Town and Corby Town.\n\nIn the East Anglian Cup Wisbech Town were drawn to play Ipswich Town. Mindful of how well the Fenmen had played when the two clubs met a few seasons ago in the F.A. Cup, Ipswich Town sent a strong team including six first-team players to Fenland Park where the result was a three goals each draw.\n\nAt Portman Road, Ipswich Town won by five goals to four in an exciting match.

When the decision had to made, the Midland League, which had been the goal for several years didn’t appear likely to take entrants for the next season, so the Directors decided to enter the Eastern Counties League to whose management the club had to guarantee membership for two seasons. Their application to join the ECL was approved as early as April 2nd; however, the club had not resigned from the United Counties League, planning to play another first eleven in that league.\n\nIronically, with the furore this decision was to have next season, if the Club Directors had decided to apply for Midland League membership, they most probably would have been elected, as there were three vacancies. Scunthorpe United and Shrewsbury Town were elected to the Football League and Ransome & Marles decided not to seek re-election.\n\nThe Fenmen started off their 1950/51 campaign in the new surroundings of the Eastern Counties League with a splendid six goals to one win against Yarmouth Town. Four days later, the first game in the United Counties League was played, a one – all draw at Fenland Park against neighbours March Town.\n\nBy now the UCL management committee were not amused as the team that played against March Town was obviously the Reserves, so they referred the matter to the Football Association. The Reserves next fixture was away at Bourne Town, which was played, the game becoming a friendly encounter. In Wisbech Town’s mitigation, it was revealed that the club had twenty-one professional players on the books and were seeking more; and were expecting to do well in the United Counties League.\n\nDespite petitions from Wisbech, the F.A. found Wisbech Town F.C. guilty of not withdrawing the first eleven from the UCL; a fine of £100 was imposed, later reduced to £25 after an appeal and the Reserves were placed in the Peterborough Premier. Also March Town received compensation for the loss of a home fixture.\n\nOne club’s representative, commenting on the decision made, stated that the Wisbech Club were attempting to better themselves, and the UCL should be proud of the Club’s efforts and it was a shame that Wisbech were not on the fixture list as most clubs had good attendances when they met the Fenmen.\n\nThe ground record up to then of 6,781 spectators in early December witnessed a two goals to one win over Lynn Town in the Eastern Counties League Cup. It was in this competition that the Fenmen reached the final, played at The Walks against Chelmsford City Reserves and only an injury-time equaliser by the Essex side prevented the trophy from making its way to Wisbech. The replay the following Tuesday at Fenland Park also ended in a stalemate with confusion as to whether extra time was to be played or not. Agreement had been reached before the kick-off to no extra time but the spectators were not informed, and with no vacant dates available. It was agreed to play the second replay at Chelmsford at the start of next season.\n\nA view of the Popular Side at Fenland Park before the Fenmen Stand was erected.

Lynn also defeated the Fenmen by two goals to nil at The Walks in the F.A. Cup. British Rail ran an excursion train for this match; the cost of a return ticket was 1/9d.\n\nHowever, a single goal from Johnny Hutchinson was enough to take the Eastern Counties League Cup at the third attempt, winning away in the third match against a Chelmsford City Reserve side that included seven first-team players. After a near-faultless performance, goalkeeper Jack Cole was deservedly carried shoulder-high of the pitch by his delighted team-matches.\n\n1951 - 52 players from 1940s- 50s scrapbook.

The duo's resignation came after a boardroom row, which, as reported in the local Press, according to Malpass gave them “no choice but to quit.” At the meeting club Chairman “Sonny” Roseberry walked out after a disagreement with Malpass, and that argument would be remembered in a few years time.\n\nMel Harnwell returned to take over as player-manager but a disastrous start to the season saw him dismissed by the end of August.\n\nDave Clarke took over and started to rebuild the team and a mid-table position was the end result. However, Boardroom rows an internal wrangling forced one of the Fenmen’s most experienced and valuable players to leave the club.\n\nThe only trophy won was the Culey Cup, a win over local rivals Kings Lynn in November. However, the Linnets did get revenge at the end of the season, being the first winners of the Kinsella Cup, the Fenmen by then under new manager Barry Wilson, who had been manager at Holbeach United & Parson Drove and had played for Wisbech Town “A” in the early sixties.\n\nA much better 1981/82 season for the Fenmen. A good run in the F.A. Cup ended at the fourth qualifying round stage away at Bedford Town and this was the first season that the club entered the F.A. Vase, the first match, away at Brantham only attracted 60 spectators and was the lowest gate until beaten by S & L Corby in season 2010/11 when only 41 spectators paid to watch the game. The Fenmen lost away at Midland Combination side Knowle by two goals to one in the second round. This game was postponed five times through snow and ice and was eventually played on New Year’s Day and on a terrible pitch, fog swirling throughout the game, the few Wisbech supporters who made the trip struggled to see both goals, the winner going to the home side through a penalty in the last minute.\n\nFifth place in the Town & Country League and a two goals to nil triumph over March Town in the final of the Cambs Invitation Cup rounded of the season in good style.\n\nIn the 1982-83 season, Roy McManus was appointed as caretaker player-manager.

Over 2,700 spectators crammed into Fenland Park gave the ground a real big time atmosphere. Officials and police were attending to their jobs. The Press were there in force. It was like the well planned funeral in George Eliot's famous novel Middlemarch. A leading character planned his own funeral meticulously. The only thing he forgot was that he would not be there to see it go according to plan. Wisbech had everything planned. They simply forgot to play the game. Yet they took the lead then allowed the visitors to equalise before half-time; and in the second half the visitors looked the better side.\n\nThe second leg at Halesowen saw one of the finest fighting performances by the Fenmen most observers had witnessed in years. After the disappointment of the previous week's semi‑final first leg at Fenland Park, which ended all square at 1‑1, the odds were stacked against Wisbech.\n\nWhen they saw the dreadful state of the Halesowen pitch, they must have felt Wembley slipping from their grasp.\n\nJust 45 seconds after kick off, Wisbech were a goal behind.\n\nFrom that position they recovered and two hours later were still in the competition after a two – all draw.

Fan favourite, Stuart Hicks, then 20, ended the season with a move into professional football joining Fourth Division Colchester United.

Whilst all this was going on the First XI reached the F.A. Challenge Cup First Round Proper for the first time since 1965. To the Eastern League Officers annoyance, the Media treated the suspension as a joke, the “Sandwich Saga” not only gave the Club notoriety, but column inches in the National Press. The Management, Officers and Directors of the Club resigned; an E.G.M. of the Shareholders was called in February and a new Board of Directors were elected under the Chairmanship of Eddie Anderson.

It had been thirty years since the Fenmen last appeared in the Rounds Proper of the F.A. Cup.\n\nNot the best of starts on the day as the team coach broke down on the way to the game, however, the Fenmen opened the scoring with a goal from Steve McLaughlin, whose need for dentil repairs was evident on the BBC’s “Match of the Day” TV programme, but found the Isthmian League team far to strong and finished losing by five goals to one.In the Eastern League, with all the turmoil at the Club, it was no surprise that a mid-table final position was attained.\n\nSeason 1996/97 - the new Board of Directors stated their intention of the Club gaining promotion to the Southern League and to this end extra terracing was installed at Fenland Park, along with a refurbishment of the floodlights. A suite of offices and hospitality rooms were built to meet Southern League requirements and named the “Bert Roseberry Suite” after the long-serving director.On the field the team finished in second place in the Eastern League, a twelve – match winning run at the end of the season earned promotion to the Southern League.

Gary Childs became the club’s first full-time manager.\n\nOnce again the Fenmen hit the headlines in the F.A. Cup. Given a bye until the fourth qualifying round the team did well to draw 1 - 1 away at Gloucester City. Everybody who attended the replay at Fenland Park will still recite details of that match which started with Gloucester 2 – 0 and coasting at half-time. Wisbech then had a man sent off and the ten-men tore Gloucester apart. A penalty missed and three goals saw the Fenmen through to the First Round Proper.\n\nA win at Billericay was followed by a home tie against Bristol Rovers in the Second Round Proper; this was the Clubs second appearance in that Round, the first being in 1957/58. A good performance in front of 3,593 spectators, but the full-time professionals scored twice in the second half to end the Fenmen’s dreams.\n\nAlso in this season, Wisbech Town F.C. launched their first ever website which connected the team to supporters all over the world. In Wisbech, the players were conncting with the local community, coaching students out of mainstream education from Years 10 and 11 as part of a programme of learning and skills development. One student went on to gain essential work experience through a placement at the club and another joined the women's team.\n\nThe Fenmen ended the season in fifth place in the League. As a result of soaring popularity and success, revenue rose above the VAT threshold for the first time and the club had to register to pay VAT.\n\nPlayer manager Gary Childs left in November 1998 and former Chelsea, Peterborough United and West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper, Tony Godden became manager. In February 1999 an Academy for young players in partnership with College of West Anglia was set up. There was cup success locally, the Kinsella Cup was won over King’s Lynn and the Addenbrookes Cup over Cambridge United and the team season 14th place in the Dr Martens League.\n\nIn the last year of the decade, Wisbech Town FC joined the Dr Martens Southern League East Division. Darren Bloodworth took over as manager. Again, the team enjoyed local cup success winning the Addenbrookes Hospital Cup over Cambridge United.\n\nIn November the club made a dramatic appeal for funds to keep going.\n\nWisbech Town F.C. Club Chairman and Director issue a plea for public support. Newspaper Archive\n\nClub chairman Alf Bishop, who will stand down at the annual meet­ing before the end of the year, admit­ted on Wednesday: \"We have run out of ideas. We don't know where we can get the money to carry on.\"\n\nThe club's situation will be explained in detail at a public meet­ing next Friday, November 12, when, according to a club statement: \"All views and suggestions will be wel­comed and all avenues explored with a view to maintaining the status quo.\" The football club has \"pruned all the expenditure possible\" according to Mr Bishop, with the budget for players being half what it was when the team made its Dr Martens League debut last season.\n\nCompany secretary and director Roger Green said: \"We are looking for a Godsend. We want to stay in the league we are in, because we've got the best crop of young players we've had here for 20 years and an excep­tional young manager.\n\n\"We are asking whether the public, and businesses in this area, want a first class non-league club, because that is what we are. We have done everything we can. We now need help, and quickly.\"\n\nMr Green said the club did not want to take out a loan because: \"That could be a millstone round our necks for 25 years.\"\n\nTony Godden was appointed manager midway through last season and, acting under financial restrictions, was successfully able to carry out his duties in difficult circumstances. Having reviewed the situation for the forthcoming season, Mr. Godden has reluctantly decided to tender his resignation to take immediate effect. Wisbech Town FC appreciated his contribution during a time in which, with severely reduced costs, the club accrued virtually the same number of points as had been gained from the same number of games prior to his appointment, but with severely reduced costs.\n\nThe club understood the reasons for his decision and wished him well in his footballing career.\n\nOn July 1st Darren Bloodworth has been charged with the task of leading Wisbech Town through what promises to be a difficult season in a new Division.\n\nThe club reacted quickly to manager Tony Godden’s resignation on Tuesday by turning to the reserve team manager, who immediately accepted the challenge of taking the Fenmen into the South/East Division of the Dr. Martens League.\n\nFootball Secretary John Petch released a statement which said the club was “delighted to make the announcement.” He said the club had noted “the drive, ambition and enthusiasm” of Bloodworth. Both parties have agreed he will take the job on a trial basis with the situation being reviewed at Christmas. The statement said the move had been made quickly so the new man could “set about the task of bringing new players to the club.”\n\n2000s\n\nThe 2000s saw many highs, lows and new developments: a move to a new stadium, playing in Europe and a news story featuring World Cup 1990 and Euro 96 star Paul Gascoigne.\n\nDuring the 2000-1 season, the new position of Director of Football was introduced at the club and Ian Stringfellow was appointed player-manager. The team went on tour to Valthermond in the Netherlands to take part in a tournament with European teams and came fourth in the competition and received a gift of Delft pottery for taking part.\n\nThe following season, 2001/02 in January saw much‑travelled Ian Benjamin as the new manager of Wisbech Town, the fourth man to hold the post this season.\n\nThe 40‑year‑old whose last job was at Jewson Premier Club Soham, was a unanimous choice of the club's board of directors, who conducted interviews with three applicants on Tuesday. He becomes manager number nine in the past four years at Fenland Park, not including caretaker managers.\n\nBenjamin succeeds Pat Clarke, who had been manager since September but who quit at the beginning of January for personal reasons. One of the other applicants was Pat O'Keefe, who had been caretaker since then but has not been able to pull Wisbech out of the lower reaches of the Dr. Martens Eastern Division.\n\nBenjamin, who lives in Kettering and whose wife is from Wisbech, lists Sheffield United, West Brom, Peterborough, Northampton, Cambridge United, Southend, Exeter, Chester, Luton, Brentford and Wigan as his professional clubs in a career which saw him make almost 500 league appearances. He was appointed Soham manager in May, 2001, having had a spell with Warboys before handing over to former Wisbech boss Ian Jones in November, 2000.\n\nUnfortunately ‘Benj’ couldn’t prevent the Fenmen holding the rest of the Division up, although whether or they would be relegated was all on the last match away to Dartford. The Fenmen were on top near the end and going all out for the winning goal which would see them stay up. A couple of ‘wonder saves’ from the Dartford ‘keeper and then a breakaway in injury time saw the home side snatch the winner.\n\nThe Fenmen were relegated to the Eastern Counties League for Season 2002/03. And the team had a 17-match unbeaten run which gave them sixth place in the final table. Also a good F.A. Cup run ended in the fourth qualifying round at home to Harrogate Town who won by two goals to nil in front of a ‘gate’ of 1,061 – the last occasion of a four figure attendance at Fenland Park.\n\nIn the press, rumours the club may have to sell Fenland Park due to pending insolvency began to build but were swiftly quashed in February with an official statement from the club.\n\nRoy McManus and club legend, Jackie Gallagher, took over as voluntary managers. The 2003-4 season was a stark contrast to the previous and the club’s financial situation was deteriorating. The Fenmen finished 14th in the league and won the Kinsella Cup.\n\nThe 2004-5 season saw another change in management when Ian “Jigger” Jones took up the role of Manager. In October, this season, a hoax news story circulated that World Cup 1990 and Euro 96 star Paul Gascoigne had expressed an interest in taking over the club. The source of the hoax was found to be a 17-year-old in nearby Doddington. Such was the voracity of the rumour, Paul Gascoigne had to address the rumours publicly.\n\nFrom the “Wisbech Standard”\n\nFORMER England midfielder Paul Gascoigne may be on his way to Wisbech Town Football Club as player/manager \"to do a Roman Abramovich\".\n\nHis agent has told the Fenland club that Gascoigne is looking for a club to invest in at grassroots level to see how far he can take it.\n\nAnd while not having the money of the Russian billionaire, who took over Chelsea, Gascoigne has received a massive cash boost with sales of his newly published autobiography.\n\nGascoigne, who quit Boston United after two months this week, now lives in Spalding and earlier this week stopped by for an informal look at the Wisbech club.\n\nNext Tuesday, he plans to put his interest on an official footing, having arranged to meet Wisbech chairman Barry Carter.\n\nThe baffled chairman has spent the week fielding calls from Gascoigne's agent confirming the player's interest in Wisbech.\n\n\"The first call came right out of the blue,\" said Mr Carter. \"But since then there has been at least five other calls from his agent expressing his interest.\"\n\nMr Carter was told that Wisbech was one of several clubs Gascoigne was looking at but he liked Wisbech and the area. Mr Carter admitted: \"Of course, when I got the call it was a bit of a shock. And, so far, I've no idea exactly what Paul is looking for.\n\n\"We'll just have to wait and see. His agent said Paul wanted to do a 'Roman Abramovich' and invest in a club.\"\n\nWith Wisbech due to sell their ground for development and move to a new stadium, Mr Carter believes the Fenmen may offer a perfect home for someone of Gascoigne's ability.\n\n\"Not so much as a player, but definitely as a celebrity,\" said Mr Carter.\n\nGascoigne, who is looking to extend his career on the coaching side, is currently completing an FA coaching course.\n\nThe former Newcastle, Tottenham, Lazio and Rangers player, won 57 England caps and was a star of the 1990 World Cup and Euro 1996.\n\nTwo years on from when there were whispers of a possible sale of Fenland Park in the press and around the town, in May 2005, the club issued a statement to confirm that the sale of Fenland Park had been agreed.\n\nThe 2005-06 season saw Dick Creasy take the reins. The club went on to finish fourth in the Jewson Eastern Premier League. In a contrast to the previous season, the 2006-7 season only saw four home wins but the team managed to finish eleventh in the league table and to the fourth qualifying round of the F.A. Cup. A win over Mildenhall then three away games against clubs at a higher level, Bury Town, Redditch and Solihull Borough were all beaten and only a dubious penalty in the fourth qualifying round away at Fleetwood Town gave them the impetus to score two more.\n\nA new site was found for the club, however, considerable opposition to the proposed development halted progress.\n\nThe 2007-08 season ushered in the return of Ian ‘Jigger’ Jones as manager, with Mel Mattless as assistant. A ‘whole club’ policy is introduced with the aim of encouraging local talent and providing opportunities for young people locally in the Youth, Reserve and First team and this still stands today and is at the very heart of the ethos of Wisbech Town FC. Following a difficult start to the season, Roy McManus and Steve Appleby took over as a management duo and the season ended with the club in a mid-table position. Also in this year, the club was granted planning permission for a new ground off Lynn Road, just into the Wisbech/ Norfolk border.\n\nThe 2008-09 the season started out at Fenland Park and then moved to the Nest at Outwell while work on the new ground commenced. Gary Setchell was appointed manager this season and the team finished 16th in the Ridgeons League.\n\nThe last game at Fenland Park took place on Monday September 15th 2008, a testimonial game for long-serving player Mark Jimson against Kings Lynn. A ‘gate’ of 350, the highest of the season, watched a no-score draw and the next day Wisbech Town vacated the ground.\n\n“In the years to come, many a tear may be shed remembering certain matches or players, but this wonderful ground has been the catalyst for many strong friendships to evolve over the years between supporters and this should never be forgotten.\n\n“Page after page could be printed giving all the names of those who have given their time, expertise and finance to the club over the years.\n\n“From the Supporters Club, such a dominant force in the 1950’s, to the present helpers; all have or are working to provide entertainment in a world completely changed from those austere days in 1947.”\n\n“To all those people – a sincere thank you.”\n\n“Goodbye Fenland Park, old friend, you will be missed.”\n\nDuring the 2009-10 season, the club received grant funding to cover a significant portion of the costs of building the new stadium at Lynn Road from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund, which is a grant scheme funded by the Premier League administered by the Football Foundation. Dick Creasey took on a caretaker manager role when Gary Setchell left, a run of ten matches unbeaten meant the team finished the season fifth in the league and expectation was high for the new decade.\n\nWisbech Town 2009/10.
