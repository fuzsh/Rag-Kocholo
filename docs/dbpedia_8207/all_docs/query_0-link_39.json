        "text": "The Premier League trophy returned to the Etihad Stadium last season, with Manchester City crowned champions following Arsenal’s implosion in form over the final few weeks of the campaign.\n\nCity’s victory saw their name added to the Premier League roll of honour in what was the 30th anniversary season of the competition being founded back in 1992.\n\nAnd City are unsurprisingly involved in the title race once again this season, alongside the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal.\n\nAnd so with more history set to be made this season, let’s take a look at the full list of previous winners in the Premier League.\n\nWhich clubs have won the Premier League?\n\nSince the Premier League was formed, seven different clubs have won the title.\n\nManchester United are the most successful club in the competition’s history with 13 Premier League titles to their name.\n\nUnited won the first two editions of the Premier League in 1992/93 and 1993/94, and they then went on to win eight of the first 11 seasons as they dominated throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s.\n\nTheir last title triumph arrived in 2012/13, which was Sir Alex Ferguson’s final season in the Old Trafford hot seat.\n\nNoisy neighbours Manchester City are the second most decorated team in the Premier League with seven titles.\n\nTheir first came in the most dramatic of circumstances, with Sergio Aguero scoring a last minute goal in the final game of the 2011/12 season to wrestle the title away from United’s clutches on goal difference.\n\nThe biggest winning margin in Premier League history is the 19 points Pep Guardiola’s men finished ahead of Manchester United in 2017/18.\n\nCity have won the last three titles since 2020/21- a feat matched only twice by Manchester United between 1999-2001 and 2007-2009.\n\nChelsea, meanwhile, have lifted the trophy five times under Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Antonio Conte.\n\nArsene Wenger guided Arsenal to three titles around the turn of the millenium, with their victory in 2003/04 the only time a team has won the Premier League without losing a single game.\n\nThe Premier League awarded Arsenal a golden league trophy in recognition of their incredible invincible campaign.\n\nLiverpool finally clinched their first Premier League title in 2019/20 with 99 points under Jurgen Klopp, whilst Blackburn Rovers were surprise winners of the competition in 1994/95 with the help of striker Alan Shearer and manager Kenny Dalglish.\n\nBut perhaps the most incredible moment in Premier League history was when Leicester stunned the football world to win in 2015/2016.\n\nHaving only narrowly avoided relegation the previous season, Claudio Ranieri led the 5000-1 Foxes to the league title, finishing 10 points ahead of second-placed Arsenal with stars such as N’Golo Kante, Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez.\n\nMORE : Donny van de Beek speaks out on ‘new chapter’ after Manchester United exit\n\nMORE : The highest-paid players in the Premier League from Kevin De Bruyne to Mohamed Salah\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram\n\nShare your views in the comments below"
