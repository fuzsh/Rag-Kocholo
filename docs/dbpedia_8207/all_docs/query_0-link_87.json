        "text": "1992/93\n\nThe biggest spenders: Blackburn\n\nThe spend: £8.46m\n\nThe signings: Alan Shearer, Duncan Shearer, Kevin Gallacher, Frank Talia, Patrik Andersson, Stuart Ripley, Graeme Le Saux, Nicky Marker, Simon Ireland, Wayne Burnett, Henning Berg, Lee Makel, Tim Sherwood\n\nThe biggest signing: Alan Shearer (£3.4m, Southampton)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\nManchester United won the inaugural Premier League title after a seasonal spend of £2.3m, comprised of fees for Eric Cantona (£1.2m), Dion Dublin (£1m) and the great Pat McGibbon (£100k). Blackburn, Tottenham (£4.7m), Liverpool (£4.4m) and Sheffield Wednesday (£2.4m) all spent more.\n\n1993/94\n\nThe biggest spenders: Blackburn\n\nThe spend: £8.5m\n\nThe signings: Tim Flowers, David Batty, Ian Pearce, Paul Warhurst, Paul Harford, Andy Morrison\n\nThe biggest signing: David Batty (£2.75m, Leeds)\n\nThe finish: 2nd\n\nBlackburn benefited from Jack Walker’s millions once more, although third-placed Newcastle (£5.1m) pushed them close. Rovers would have spent even more in summer 1993 had Manchester United not beaten them to the British-record signing of Roy Keane (£3.75m). That was the only signing Alex Ferguson’s champions made in their successful first title defence.\n\n1994/95\n\nThe biggest spenders: Everton\n\nThe spend: £10.9m\n\nThe signings: Earl Barrett, Duncan Ferguson, David Burrows, Daniel Amokachi, Vinny Samways\n\nThe biggest signing: Duncan Ferguson (£4m, Rangers)\n\nThe finish: 15th\n\nAnd you assumed Blackburn would complete this most obscure of hat-tricks. Kenny Dalglish spent £6.5m on Chris Sutton and Jeff Kenna to finally deliver the Premier League title to Ewood Park, but they were blown out of the water by Everton. The Toffees are proof that money does not guarantee success: they spent more than anyone in the 1994/95 season, only to finish 15th.\n\n1995/96\n\nThe biggest spenders: Newcastle\n\nThe spend: £24.5m\n\nThe signings: Shaka Hislop, Les Ferdinand, David Batty, David Ginola, Warren Barton, Darren Huckerby, Faustino Asprilla\n\nThe biggest signing: Faustino Asprilla (£6.7m, Parma)\n\nThe finish: 2nd\n\nNewcastle there, spending more money on more players 22 years ago than they do now. Faustino Asprilla arrived in February 1996 and infamously (did not) cost the Magpies the title, while Les Ferdinand (£4m) and David Ginola (£2.5m) also joined the party. Everton (£11.9m) splashed the cash again, this time finishing sixth, while Arsenal (£12.25m) and Liverpool (£13m) came fifth and third respectively. Manchester United signed two players all season, both goalkeepers in Nick Culkin and Tony Coton. Wimbledon (£125k) were the only club to spend less (£750k) than the champions.\n\n1996/97\n\nThe biggest spenders: Newcastle\n\nThe spend: £17.5m\n\nThe signings: Alan Shearer, Des Hamilton\n\nThe biggest signing: Alan Shearer (£15m, Blackburn)\n\nThe finish: 2nd\n\nOnly two players joined as Newcastle attempted to make the final step from runners-up to champions, but one of them was the most expensive in the world. A five-year-old Mohamed Salah scoffed and raised an eyebrow at Shearer’s return of 25 Premier League goals as the Magpies again missed out to Manchester United (£7.6m), who spent less than Aston Villa (£12.7m) and relegated Middlesbrough (£11.2m).\n\n1997/98\n\nThe biggest spenders: Newcastle\n\nThe spend: £24.65m\n\nThe signings: Paddy Kelly, Shay Given, Temuri Ketsbaia, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Stuart Pearce, Alessandro Pistone, Brian Pinas, John Barnes, Ian Rush, Carlos Gonzalez, Ralf Keidel, Paul Dalglish, David Terrier, Andreas Andersson, Andy Griffin, Gary Speed, James Coppinger, Paul Robinson, Stephen Glass, Nikos Dabizas\n\nThe biggest signing: Gary Speed (£5.5m, Everton)\n\nThe finish: 13th\n\nThat’s a lot of players. It’s also a lot of money. Newcastle used to be so fun when it came to transfers. Arsenal pushed them closest in that respect, spending £16.75m en route to their first Premier League title.\n\n1998/99\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester United\n\nThe spend: £29.35m\n\nThe signings: Jaap Stam, Russell Best, Jesper Blomqvist, John O’Shea, Dwight Yorke, Bojan Djordjic\n\nThe biggest signing: Dwight Yorke (£12.6m, Aston Villa)\n\nThe finish: 1st\n\nIt took until the seventh season of Premier League football for the campaign’s highest spenders to emerge as champions. Newcastle (£27.55m) obviously spent all of the money again, only to finish 13th again. Neat trick.\n\n1999/2000\n\nThe biggest spenders: Liverpool\n\nThe spend: £35.9m\n\nThe signings: Sami Hyypiä, Titi Camara, Sander Westerveld, Stéphane Henchoz, Dietmar Hamann, Vladimír Šmicer, Emile Heskey, Erik Meijer, Jon Newby\n\nThe biggest signing: Emile Heskey (£11m, Leicester)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\nAfter going briefly transfer mad the previous season, champions Manchester United (£10m) scaled their business back considerably. Coventry (£16.45m) spent more.\n\n2000/01\n\nThe biggest spenders: Leeds\n\nThe spend: £48.7m\n\nThe signings: Olivier Dacourt, Mark Viduka, Dominic Matteo, Jacob Burns, Rio Ferdinand, Robbie Keane\n\nThe biggest signing: Rio Ferdinand (£18m, West Ham)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\nArsenal spent £35m to finish second, while Chelsea stumped up a bill of £34.1m to come sixth. A world-record fee for a defender of £18m could not lift Leeds any higher than fourth, 12 points behind Manchester United. The Red Devils spent £8.7m on Fabien Barthez in May 2000, and nothing more.\n\n2001/02\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester United\n\nThe spend: £58.6m\n\nThe signings: Roy Carroll, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Juan Sebastián Verón, Laurent Blanc, Diego Forlán, Luke Steele\n\nThe biggest signing: Juan Sebastián Verón (£29.1m, Lazio)\n\nThe finish: 3rd\n\nManchester United spent more money than anyone, but Arsenal (£29.15m) won the Premier League title. Who came second behind United in terms of money spent? Fulham (£32.3m), obviously.\n\n2002/03\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester United\n\nThe spend: £30.6m\n\nThe signings: Rio Ferdinand, Ricardo\n\nThe biggest signing: Rio Ferdinand (£29.1m)\n\nThe finish: 1st\n\nManchester United spent £30.6m to finish first. Manchester City spent £30.25m to finish ninth.\n\n2003/04\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £121.5m\n\nThe signings: Jürgen Macho, Marco Ambrosio, Glen Johnson, Geremi, Wayne Bridge, Damien Duff, Joe Cole, Juan Sebastián Verón, Adrian Mutu, Alexey Smertin, Hernán Crespo, Neil Sullivan, Claude Makélélé, Scott Parker\n\nThe biggest signing: Damien Duff (£17m, Blackburn)\n\nThe finish: 2nd\n\nOh look, Chelsea have some money. Arsenal invincibled their way to the title off the back of a £1.75m summer spend – although they spent a further £10.5m on José Antonio Reyes in January and £3m on Robin van Persie in April.\n\n2004/05\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £94.45m\n\nThe signings: Paulo Ferreira, Petr Čech, Arjen Robben, Mateja Kežman, Didier Drogba, Tiago, Ricardo Carvalho, Nuno Morais, Jiří Jarošík\n\nThe biggest signing: Didier Drogba (£24m, Marseille)\n\nThe finish: 1st\n\nIf at first you don’t quite succeed, spend another metric sh*t ton and employ a better manager.\n\n2005/06\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £54.4m\n\nThe signings: Asier del Horno, Lassana Diarra, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Michael Essien, Maniche\n\nThe biggest signing: Michael Essien (£24.4m, Lyon)\n\nThe finish: 1st\n\nLiverpool celebrated becoming European champions in the most frugal way possible: by spending £27.35m, and making Peter Crouch (£7m) their most expensive buy of the summer. Newcastle enjoyed some ’90s nostalgia by parting with £38.3m.\n\n2006/07\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £56.5m\n\nThe signings: Michael Ballack, Salomon Kalou, Andriy Shevchenko, John Obi Mikel, Khalid Boulahrouz, Ashley Cole\n\nThe biggest signing: Andriy Shevchenko (£30.8m)\n\nThe finish: 2nd\n\nChelsea definitely spent more money than 18 Premier League clubs in 2006/07. But no-one has a bloody clue how much Pards spent on Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano at West Ham.\n\n2007/08\n\nThe biggest spenders: Liverpool\n\nThe spend: £69.3m\n\nThe signings: Andriy Voronin, Yossi Benayoun, Fernando Torres, Ryan Babel, Lucas, Charles Itandje, Krisztián Németh, Nikolay Mihaylov, Emiliano Insúa, Ryan Crowther, Sebastián Leto, Damien Plessis, Martin Škrtel, Javier Mascherano\n\nThe biggest signing: Fernando Torres (£20m, Atletico Madrid)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\nOn only two occasions have Liverpool been the highest spenders in a single Premier League season. Tottenham (£57.5m) also loosened the purse strings a little, while Manchester United won the title and Champions League on the back of a £51.8m squad investment.\n\n2008/09\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £119.35m\n\nThe signings: Jô, Tal Ben Haim, Vincent Kompany, Shaun Wright-Phillips, Pablo Zabaleta, Gláuber, Robinho, Wayne Bridge, Craig Bellamy, Nigel de Jong, Shay Given\n\nThe biggest signing: Robinho (£32.5m, Real Madrid)\n\nThe finish: 10th\n\nWith Liverpool (£38.3m), Manchester United (£37.75m), Arsenal (£32.5m) and Chelsea (£24.6m) all electing to leave the transfer window ajar, Manchester City decided to sneak in. The aforementioned quartet obviously comprised the top four, while City finished tenth.\n\n2009/10\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £125.5m\n\nThe signings: Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Stuart Taylor, Carlos Tevez, Emmanuel Adebayor, Kolo Touré, Sylvinho, Joleon Lescott, Patrick Vieira, Adam Johnson\n\nThe biggest signing: Carlos Tevez (£25.5m, MSI)\n\nThe finish: 5th\n\nManchester City broke the £100m barrier for the second season running. The next closest club in terms of seasonal transfer spend was Aston Villa (£35m), followed by Sunderland (£34.5m). And just look at them now. Chelsea spent £26m on their way to the title, £18m of which went on Yuri Zhirkov.\n\n2010/11\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £152m\n\nThe signings: Jérôme Boateng, Yaya Touré, David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov, Mario Balotelli, James Milner, Edin Džeko\n\nThe biggest signing: Edin Džeko (£27m, Wolfsburg)\n\nThe finish: 3rd\n\nChelsea spent £100.8m in an attempt to defend their Premier League title. Manchester United spent £23.8m to wrestle it from their grasp. To repeat: money doesn’t guarantee success.\n\n2011/12\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £79.2m\n\nThe signings: Thibaut Courtois, Oriol Romeu, Romelu Lukaku, Juan Mata, Ulises Davila, Raul Meireles, Sam Hutchinson, Kenneth Omeruo, Gary Cahill, Lucas Piazon, Patrick Bamford, Kevin de Bruyne\n\nThe biggest signing: Juan Mata (£23.5m, Valencia)\n\nThe finish: 6th\n\nIt may have delivered an underwhelming Premier League season, but the consolation was a Champions League title and FA Cup. Manchester City won the title with a £76m spend.\n\n2012/13\n\nThe biggest spenders: Chelsea\n\nThe spend: £86.1m\n\nThe signings: Lamisha Musonda, Charly Musonda, Tika Musonda, Andreas Christensen, Marko Marin, Eden Hazard, Thorgan Hazard, Oscar, César Azpilicueta, Victor Moses, Wallace, Demba Ba\n\nThe biggest signing: Eden Hazard (£32m, Lille)\n\nThe finish: 3rd\n\nA similar spend, another European trophy, and a slightly improved Premier League finish. All thanks to Rafael Benitez.\n\n2013/14\n\nThe biggest spenders: Tottenham\n\nThe spend: £109m\n\nThe signings: Paulinho, Nacer Chadli, Roberto Soldado, Étienne Capoue, Vlad Chiricheș, Christian Eriksen, Érik Lamela\n\nThe biggest signing: Érik Lamela (£30m, Roma)\n\nThe finish: 6th\n\n“Look at Tottenham … [when] you spend over £100m you’d expect to be challenging for the league.” Brendan’s words, not ours. Tottenham outspent Chelsea by a mere £500k, but neither could keep the pace of Manchester City (£90.9m) or Liverpool (£44.8m).\n\n2014/15\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester United\n\nThe spend: £147.2m\n\nThe signings: Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Vanja Milinković-Savić, Marcos Rojo, Ángel di María, Daley Blind, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Víctor Valdés, Sadiq El Fitouri\n\nThe biggest signing: Ángel di María (£59.7m, Real Madrid)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\n“Look at Tottenham…[when] you spend over £100m you’d expect to be challenging for the league.” Brendan’s words, not ours. Liverpool (£117m) might have expected more than sixth place. Manchester United (£147.2m) were the only club to spend more, and soared into fourth. Chelsea’s £108.6m spend delivered a title.\n\n2015/16\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £149.6m\n\nThe signings: Kevin de Bruyne, Raheem Sterling, Nicolás Otamendi, Patrick Roberts, Fabian Delph, Enes Ünal, Anthony Caceres, Florian Lejeune, Rubén Sobrino, Luke Brattan\n\nThe biggest signing: Kevin de Bruyne (£55m, Wolfsburg)\n\nThe finish: 4th\n\nHa ha.\n\n2016/17\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £171.5m\n\nThe signings: Ilkay Gündoğan, Nolito, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Leroy Sané, Marlos Moreno, John Stones, Claudio Bravo, Gabriel Jesus\n\nThe biggest signing: John Stones (£47.5m, Everton)\n\nThe finish: 3rd\n\n“This season it’s very important to understand that it’s not always about who spends more money who wins,” said Antonio Conte last April. Chelsea taught the Manchester clubs a lesson, winning the title after spending a pittance (£117.2m) in comparison to City and United (£145.3m).\n\n2017/18\n\nThe biggest spenders: Manchester City\n\nThe spend: £278.7m\n\nThe signings: Bernardo Silva, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Douglas Luiz, Danilo, Benjamin Mendy, Olarenwaju Kayode, Aymeric Laporte, Jack Harrison\n\nThe biggest signing: Aymeric Laporte (£57m, Athletic Bilbao)\n\nThe finish: 1st\n\nThe three biggest spenders in the Premier League this season are Manchester City, Chelsea (£237.9m) and Everton (£197.6m). That is truly the most mixed of bags. This was only the fifth season out of 26 in which the club that spent the most money won the title. Go figure."
