        "text": "Arsenal v Manchester United is always one of the first fixtures you look for in any Premier League season, with the pair responsible for winning 17 of the 26 Premier League titles since 1992.\n\nIt's always huge, and - although that might not be the case this time around - it has quite often been crucial to deciding the destiny of the trophy.\n\nBut sometimes, well... sometimes it can go wrong.\n\nSometimes some odd players sneak into one of the biggest games in English football.\n\nSo sit back and enjoy our worst XI to have appeared in a Arsenal v United fixture in the Premier League.\n\nRemember some of these jokers?\n\nNick Culkin\n\nThis is harsh, but goalkeeper Nick Culkin makes the team purely for comedy reasons more so than anything else.\n\nAt Highbury in August 1999, United keeper Raimond van der Gouw was forced off injured in stoppage time.\n\nCulkin came on for his Premier League debut, booted a free-kick up the pitch and the referee blew for full-time. He never played in the Premier League again.\n\nStill though, United won 2-1. Win bonus!\n\nJohn Curtis\n\nIt's another harsh call as he had a good career in the lower leagues, but John Curtis makes it for the randomness of his appearance in an Old Trafford game in 1998.\n\nHe was part of the defence which failed to track Marc Overmars, who fired a crucial winner for the Gunners on their way to the double.\n\nIgors Stepanovs\n\nWe've picked three centre-backs simply because Arsenal have given us an embarrassment of awfulness in the position.\n\nAnd Igors Stepanovs takes pride of place in the back three for his Bambi on Ice of a performance in the 6-1 defeat at Old Trafford in February 2001, when the Gunners conceded five before half-time.\n\nJohan Djourou\n\nThe Swiss defender Johan Djourou wasn't the worst player for Arsenal, but THAT 8-2 defeat simply has to feature pretty heavily here.\n\nAlongside Laurent Koscielny, Djourou held together the back four much like a colander holds together water as Arsene Wenger suffered his worst defeat as Gunners boss in 2011.\n\nSebastien Squillaci\n\nSebastien Squillaci was a weird signing for Arsenal, wasn't he?\n\nThe French defender featured 22 times in the Premier League in the 2010/11 season, but one of those was in a 1-0 defeat at Old Trafford in which Park Ji-Sung nipped in ahead of him to head the winner.\n\nArmand Traore\n\nAgain we're back to the 8-2 game, which featured Gunners left-back Armand Traore galloping up and down the Old Trafford touchline like a man unaware of the concept of defending.\n\nHe actually offered a fair bit in attack, but when you concede eight goals that's hardly a compliment.\n\nEric Djemba-Djemba\n\nAh, hello Eric. We've been expecting you.\n\nA staple on United's worst ever players list, the midfielder played in a 1-1 draw at Highbury in March 2004.\n\nHe didn't do anything particularly awful, but it's safe to say that he wouldn't have done anything particularly good either.\n\nHenri Lansbury\n\nLike some of the United picks it's another harsh call for a good player, who can be seen at Aston Villa these days.\n\nBut he makes it purely for the fact that he was turned to from the bench for the final seven minutes of the 8-2 defeat in 2011, with the score at 7-2, as Wenger no doubt told him to \"go on mate, make a difference.\"\n\nHe never played for the Gunners in the league again.\n\nGlenn Helder\n\nYeah, Glenn Helder. Remember him?\n\nThe Dutch winger played for the Gunners in both United v Arsenal clashes in the 1995/96 season. Doing not very much in either.\n\nOne of Wenger's first acts as Gunners manager was to ship out the winger and eventually replace him with Marc Overmars.\n\nA pretty good decision.\n\nJimmy Carter\n\nAfter flopping at Liverpool, it was something of a surprise that Jimmy Carter joined Arsenal just before the start of the Premier League era.\n\nThe winger with the presidential name played in two United v Arsenal clashes in the early years of the Premier League, both goalless draws.\n\nWhich kind of sums him up.\n\nMarouane Chamakh\n\nThe December 2010 match which we referenced when discussing Squillaci above wasn't a classic, but it could have been so different had Marouane Chamakh not wasted a couple of gilt-edged chances.\n\nThe Moroccan missed a simple header and saw another effort blocked by Nemanja Vidic when he had to score.\n\nAt this point in the season he had scored seven Premier League goals.\n\nHe finished the season with... seven.\n\nWell, that was pretty gruesome wasn't it?\n\nHere's how they'd line up:\n\nLuckily we'll be seeing none of this rubbish at the Emirates on Saturdayâ€¦"
