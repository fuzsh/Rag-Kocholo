        "text": "Manchester United face old rivals Liverpool in the FA Cup for only the seventh time in the last 30 years.\n\nJurgen Klopp’s men visit Old Trafford in the better form and as the strong favourites as they look to book their place in the Wembley semi-final and keep their dream of lifting four trophies alive.\n\nThis competition represents United’s last hope of silverware this season and could well play a major role in whether Erik ten Hag remains in his post as manager beyond the summer.\n\nWe’ve taken a closer look at the last six times that Manchester United and Liverpool have faced off in the FA Cup – featuring the omen that the home side has won on each and every occasion. The last FA Cup away win in this fixture was all the way back in 1960, with Bobby Charlton’s United triumphing 3-1 at Anfield.\n\n1995-96: Final\n\nManchester United 1-0 Liverpool\n\nSir Alex Ferguson’s side were utterly dominant in the early years of the Premier League, winning four of the first five titles after the English top flight’s snazzy rebrand in 1992.\n\nThey demonstrated their quality in the FA Cup, too, completing a second domestic double in three years by dismantling Liverpool with a professional 1-0 win in the Wembley final.\n\nThe occasion will always be remembered for the cream suits that Liverpool’s ‘spice boys’ rocked up in, while United simply turned up and got the job done, winning it late through an iconic Eric Cantona half volley.\n\nQUIZ: Can you name every team to reach the FA Cup final since 1990?\n\n1998-99: Fourth Round\n\nManchester United 2-1 Liverpool\n\nThey weren’t to know it at the time, but Liverpool had an opportunity to scupper United’s famous treble midway through that historic 1998-99 campaign.\n\nAnd they came agonisingly close, too. Michael Owen put Liverpool ahead in the third minute at Old Trafford and they held onto that lead until the 88th.\n\nBut United plugged away and eventually got their reward in the closing stages with a mini dress rehearsal of their Camp Nou fightback four months later. Dwight Yorke levelled things up in the 88th minute and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer won it in injury-time.\n\nFerguson’s men later made it past Fulham, Chelsea, Arsenal and eventually Newcastle in the final.\n\n2005-06: Fifth Round\n\nLiverpool 1-0 Manchester United\n\nIt would be a while before Rafael Benitez would build a Liverpool side capable of challenging the likes of Chelsea and United for the Premier League title, but the Spanish coach made an instant impact when it came to big-game performances.\n\nThat was the story, of course, of their Champions League win the season before – Benitez’s first at the helm. In year two, he led them to the FA Cup, registering Liverpool’s first FA Cup win over Manchester United in 85 years en route to that Cardiff final against West Ham.\n\nPeter Crouch’s early header was the match-winner for a Liverpool side that produced a strong and dominant display at Anfield. United suffered a miserable afternoon, losing Rio Ferdinand to a hamstring injury before kick-off before Alan Smith suffered a freak broken leg blocking a free-kick in the closing stages.\n\n2010-11: Third Round\n\nManchester United 1-0 Liverpool\n\nThe season prior to this, Manchester United were dumped out of the FA Cup by losing 1-0 at home to Leeds United, who were down in League One at the time. It was the first time that Ferguson had suffered a third-round exit and his first defeat to a team from a lower division.\n\nSo 12 months on, when United were drawn against Liverpool, he made sure they weren’t going to suffer another painful elimination to another of their most hated rivals.\n\nKenny Dalglish had just made an emotional return as Liverpool manager, but his afternoon could’ve got better. The hosts were awarded a penalty just 30 seconds in, and Ryan Giggs’ spot-kick was the only goal of the game, in which Steven Gerrard was shown a red card for a rash challenge on Michael Carrick.\n\nREAD: Recalling Man Utd 3-2 Liverpool, the wildest FA Youth Cup game ever\n\n2011-12: Fourth Round\n\nLiverpool 2-1 Manchester United\n\nFor the second time in as many seasons, United were drawn against Liverpool in the early stages of the competition.\n\nKenny Dalglish’s side came out on top at Anfield, with fox in the box Dirk Kuyt winning it late on after Park Ji Sung cancelled out Daniel Agger’s early opener.\n\nLiverpool went on to reach both domestic cup finals that season. They beat Cardiff on penalties in the League Cup before losing 2-1 to Chelsea in the FA Cup.\n\nUnited, meanwhile, got their revenge at Old Trafford a fortnight later, beating Liverpool 2-1 at Old Trafford in the Premier League.\n\n2020-21: Fourth Round\n\nManchester United 3-2 Liverpool\n\nThere were no spectators allowed in at Old Trafford during the Covid-19-hit 2020-21 campaign, but the two sides played out a thrilling contest in the empty stadium.\n\nLiverpool were the reigning English champions but they suffered a miserable campaign to retain the title after suffering a defensive injury crisis – as evidenced by playing Rhys Williams and Fabinho as their centre-backs for this cup clash.\n\nBut they made a decent fist of it here. Mohamed Salah did what he invariably does against United and scored twice, but Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side won out with goals from Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford and Bruno Fernandes.\n\nUnited went on to lose to Leicester in the quarters, and neither side lifted any silverware that season, although they did both finish in the top four to qualify for the Champions League – one of only two times that’s happened in the 10 seasons since Ferguson retired.\n\nREAD NEXT: Comparing Liverpool and Man Utd’s illustrious trophy cabinets"
