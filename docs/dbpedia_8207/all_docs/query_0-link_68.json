        "text": "It’s widely accepted that Sir Alex Ferguson achieved his greatest goal of ‘knocking Liverpool off their perch’ but was that just in the league alone?\n\nThe legendary manager won a record 13 Premier League titles while gazumping their rivals in the north west, moving from 18-7 down in the record books to 20-18 up before his 2013 departure.\n\nSince then, though, there’s been a rebirth, with Liverpool taking one back in 2019/20, while United’s decade stint in the wilderness has allowed others to catch up.\n\nUnited have won just four major trophies in the eleven years since Ferguson’s departure, while ‘noisy neighbours’ Manchester City have been dominating.\n\nChelsea and Arsenal have also been picking up plenty of silverware too, while there’s even been a Premier League and FA Cup for Leicester.\n\nBut where do all those teams rank when it comes to the most decorated English sides? Well talkSPORT is here to find out…\n\n10th - Blackburn Rovers - 10 major honours\n\n6x FA Cup, 3x league champions, 1x League Cup\n\nBlackburn are perhaps best known as the pub quiz answer for Premier League champions with their 1995 title under Kenny Dalglish, but that wasn’t a one off.\n\nBefore the rebranding of the top flight, Rovers already had two titles to their name, in 1912 and 1914.\n\nAchieving much of their success around the turn of the century, they also racked up three-straight FA Cups from 1884 to 1886, and added another pair in 1891 and 1928.\n\nCurrently stuck in the Championship, Blackburn still have had more recent success than many, winning the League Cup in 2002 by beating Tottenham in the final.\n\n9th - Newcastle United - 11 major honours\n\n6x FA Cup, 4x league champions, 1x Fairs Cup\n\nNewcastle are able to bat away some of the criticism some new-monied teams face due to the size of their fanbase and their history, but it’s been a while since they landed a trophy.\n\nThat’s not for the want of trying, though, with them twice runners-up in the league and FA Cup in the 90s, they went close again last season, losing the League Cup final to Manchester United.\n\nHowever, it’s been a while since their last major honour, the Fairs Cup in 1969, with their league and cup success even further back than that.\n\n8th - Everton - 15 major honours\n\n9x league champions, 5x FA Cup, 1x Cup Winners Cup\n\nYounger football fans may not be aware, but Everton were a footballing powerhouse before the turn of the century. It’s not been the easiest of times since their last trophy win in 1995, but before that silverware was somewhat of a formality.\n\nOnly three teams have more league titles than the Toffees nine, with their last two in the ‘80s, while they also took a Cup Winners Cup on top of their six FA Cups.\n\n7th - Tottenham - 17 major honours\n\n8x FA Cup, 4x League Cup, 2x league champions, 2x UEFA Cup/Europa League, 1x Cup Winners Cup\n\nPossibly the most common stick used to beat any English side is the ‘no trophies’ one directed at Spurs, whose last silverware came with the 2008 League Cup.\n\nThe London side have gone close since for the highest of honours, finishing runners-up in both the Premier League and Champions League in recent years, however, they remained trophyless during the Harry Kane era.\n\nDespite going close in a number of competitions, Spurs haven’t done so in the FA Cup, which used to be one of their favourite competitions, with only Arsenal and Manchester United boasting more wins than their eight.\n\nThere’s also the topic of European success, with Spurs following up a 1963 Cup Winners Cup victory with two UEFA Cup triumphs.\n\n6th - Aston Villa - 20 major honours\n\n7x league champions, 7x FA Cup, 5x League Cup, 1x Champions League/European Cup\n\nEveryone’s been surprised by Aston Villa’s ascent into the top four under Unai Emery, but history suggests they deserve to be there as much as anyone.\n\nOne of only six English Champions League winners, Villa fans can proudly boast about their 1982 success, but much more on top of that.\n\nWinning the Premier League and FA Cup a combined 14 times, it shows how good Villa were before the turn of the century that their last major honour was all the way back in 1996.\n\n5th - Chelsea - 25 major honours\n\n8x FA Cup, 6x league champions, 5x League Cup, 2x Champions League/European Cup, 2x UEFA Cup/Europa League, 2x Cup Winners Cup\n\nChelsea fans have to deal with regular jibes about their history starting with Roman Abramovich’s purchase of the club in 2004, but if that were true they wouldn’t be anywhere near as high on this list.\n\nWhile it’s true much of their success has come in recent years, particularly their four European titles, they won seven of their honours before being financially boosted.\n\nIn fact, the Blues have had only four trophyless campaigns since 2004, and even with their struggles this season, it’s hard to imagine they won’t get back to winning ways soon.\n\n4th - Manchester City - 26 major honours\n\n9x league champions, 8x League Cup, 7x FA Cup, 1x Champions League, 1x Cup Winners Cup\n\nMuch like Chelsea fans, City supporters can nod to an illustrious history whenever they get any jokes about recent success, with their first European title coming in 1970.\n\nThey also had eight other honours before their 2011 Abu Dhabi takeover, but things have taken off ever since.\n\nThat’s with particular thanks to Pep Guardiola’s 12 titles, with the Spaniard landing an historic treble last season, and it looks almost certain he will add to that this term.\n\n3rd - Arsenal - 31 major honours\n\n14x FA Cup, 13x league champions, 2x League Cup, 1x Cup Winners Cup, 1x Fairs Cup\n\nKicking off the podium is Arsenal on a huge 31 honours, but their list is interestingly far more concise.\n\nThat’s because the Gunners have been dominant in both the league and FA Cup, with no club bettering their 14 lifts of the latter trophy.\n\nArsene Wenger took seven of those FA Cup wins and three league triumphs, but even with the club out-of-sorts after the legendary Frenchman’s departure, they still maintained their Wembley form.\n\nThe only thing missing from Arsenal’s trophy cabinet is the top tier of European football with the Champions League, but they still have two major continental honours to their name.\n\n2nd - Manchester United - 43 major honours\n\n20x league champions, 12x FA Cup, 6x League Cup, 3x Champions League/European Cup, 1x UEFA Cup/Europa League, 1x Cup Winners Cup\n\nIn the runners-up spot is Manchester United, despite their record 20 league titles one side remains ahead of them. Ferguson’s legacy lives on with an unparalleled 25 trophies at Old Trafford, but it’s not just about the iconic Scot.\n\nUnited were at the very top of football in the 1950s, and incredibly recovered from the horror of the Munich air disaster to win more leagues and a European Cup in the 1960s.\n\nThat incredible legacy set the club up as one of the biggest sports teams in the world, allowing Ferguson to continue the club’s tradition of dominating domestically.\n\n1st - Liverpool - 46 major honours\n\n19x league champions, 10x League Cup, 8x FA Cup, 6x Champions League/European Cup, 3x UEFA Cup/Europa League\n\nA League Cup success at Wembley makes Liverpool England’s most recent champions but also explains part of their record success.\n\nNot only have the Reds won more League Cups than any other side, but they’ve also won more Champions Leagues or European Cups than any of their English rivals."
