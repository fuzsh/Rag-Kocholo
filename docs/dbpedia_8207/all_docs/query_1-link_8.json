        "text": "Believe it or not, there was a time when Anfield was the home of the Blues and not the Reds!\n\nEverton were one of the first members of the Football League but when they were evicted from Anfield in 1892, stadium owner John Houlding was left with an empty ground and no team to play in it.\n\nSo Houlding decided to form his own team and, on 3 June 1892, Liverpool Football Club was born.\n\nLiverpool won their first ever League Championship in 1901.\n\nA run of nine wins and three draws from their final twelve matches saw the Reds crowned champions.\n\nThe team were given a heroes welcome when they returned to the city with the trophy and captain Alex Raisbeck was carried through the streets on the shoulders of fans!\n\nIn December 1959, Bill Shankly was appointed as the manager of Liverpool FC.\n\nThe Scotsman's impact was instant and he transformed the club into one of the strongest teams in Europe.\n\nMany believe Shankly is the greatest manager in the history of the Reds, and he is almost as well remembered for his quotes, such as \"If Everton were playing at the bottom of the garden, I'd pull the curtains\", as he is for his trophy successes!\n\nIt may be hard to believe but Liverpool have not always played in an all-red kit.\n\nIn fact, it wasn't until 1964 when manager Bill Shankly decided to replace the white shorts and socks with red ones as he felt an all-red kit strip would make his players look more scary to the opposition!\n\nSo, in December 1964 Liverpool wore all-red for the first time in a European Cup match with Anderlecht, changing the image of football forever.\n\nOver 20,000 Scousers made their way to Rome to watch Liverpool lift their first ever European Cup.\n\nJust like the UEFA Cup final of 1973, Borussia Monchengladbach were the opponents once again, but this time the result was never in doubt.\n\nMonchengladbach cancelled out Terry McDermott's opening strike, however second-half goals from Tommy Smith and Phil Neal meant the European Cup was heading for Anfield as Bob Paisley's Reds ran out 3-1 winners.\n\nAfter 44 years as a player, coach and manager of Liverpool, Bob Paisley retired.\n\nPaisley won an astonishing three European Cups, six league titles, three League Cups, one UEFA Cup, one European Super Cup and five Charity Shields during his time as Reds boss making him the most successful manager in the history of the club.\n\nHe became part of the Liverpool board after his retirement but sadly passed away in 1996.\n\nLiverpool claimed a league and FA Cup double in Kenny Dalglish's first-season as player-manager.\n\nThe Reds won eight of their last nine games to see off the challenge of neighbours Everton and clinch their 16th League Championship - and it was Dalglish who scored the goal that secured the title with a winning strike against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on the final day.\n\nThe following week, Liverpool beat Everton 3-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley to leave the Blues feeling even more miserable!\n\nLiverpool won an astonishing three trophies in one season, collecting the FA, UEFA and League Cups.\n\nBirmingham were defeated in the League Cup final before two late Michael Owen goals defeated Arsenal in the FA Cup, but the best was yet to come as the Reds beat Spanish club Alaves 5-4 in a crazy game in Dortmund.\n\nChampions League qualification was also secured on the final day of the season to bring an unbelievable campaign to an end for manager Gerard Houllier.\n\nLiverpool claimed their fifth European Cup after a memorable triumph over AC Milan.\n\nThe Reds had overcome all odds to reach the final, but were losing 3-0 by half-time. However, an incredible second-half saw goals from Gerrard, Smicer and Alonso drew Liverpool level before they went on to win the cup on penalties.\n\nAn unforgettable homecoming followed and the trophy returned to Anfield, where it would remain as Liverpool had won it for keeps!\n\nBrendan Rodgers was announced as Liverpool manager following the departure of Kenny Dalglish.\n\nThe Northern Irishman had learnt from some of the finest coaches in world football, including Jose Mourinho during his spell at Chelsea.\n\nThe Reds' new boss managed at Reading and Swansea before arriving at Anfield."
