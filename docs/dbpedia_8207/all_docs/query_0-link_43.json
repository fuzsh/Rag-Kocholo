        "text": "Robbie Keane’s six-month sojourn at Liverpool FC isn’t fondly remembered by either player or supporters. The boyhood Reds’ fan was over the moon when he joined the club from Tottenham Hotspur in the summer of 2008. However, he struggled for form and didn’t seem to fit into Rafa Benitez’s plans.\n\nKeane would score just seven times in all competitions for Liverpool FC but this was his best moment against Arsenal. With Fernando Torres injured, the Irishman started a match which Benitez wasn’t in the stadium for. Arsenal were 1-0 up when Keane’s moment arrived. Daniel Agger thumped a ball over the top of the Arsenal backline and Keane caught them cold. He watched the ball drop out of the December skyline and caught it superbly to smash a shot past Manuel Almunia.\n\nIt was a goal that meant a lot to Keane and the draw ensured LFC finished Christmas 2008 as the number one side. He would only be at the club for another five weeks. A return ticket to Tottenham beckoned in February 2009."
