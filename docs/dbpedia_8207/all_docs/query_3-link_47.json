        "text": "NEITHER Manchester United nor Chelsea will be in the draw for the Champions League group stages.\n\nIt will be the first time since the 1995-96 that both miss out.\n\nSince that time, this is only United’s second season without Champions League football — and it’s Chelsea’s first since 2002-03.\n\nBut what was the world of football like back then?\n\nSunSport takes you back.\n\nBlackburn were the kings of the Premier League at a time when only one country from each nation went into the Champions League — and were England’s sole representatives in the Europe’s premier competition.\n\nKenny Dalglish had become only the third manger in English football to win the title with two different teams, thanks in large part to the goals of Alan Shearer.\n\nRovers clinched the championship on a dramatic final day when, despite losing at Anfield, United’s draw at West Ham meant they were uncatchable.\n\nThe Red Devils were also shocked in the FA Cup final when Paul Rideout’s header won the trophy for Joe Royle’s Everton.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson reacted to the disappointed by selling stalwarts Mark Hughes, Paul Ince and Andrei Kanchelskis without bringing in any replacements.\n\nApparently, he believe United could still win trophies with a team built around a crop of youngsters which had won the Youth Cup in 1992.\n\nRyan Giggs, Paul Scholes, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Gary and Phil Neville would go on to form the core of a team which would dominate English football for the best part of a decade.\n\nJurgen Klinsmann was named FWA Player of the Year despite Shearer’s heroics — while the England man won the PFA award.\n\nA Steve McManaman double was enough for Liverpool to beat Bolton 2-1 in the League Cup final.\n\nOn the continent, it was Louis van Gaal who reigned supreme.\n\nHis young Ajax side — which included the likes of Clarence Seedorf, Marc Overmars, Jari Litmanen, and Edwin van der Sar — swept all before them to a win the Champions League.\n\nThey were also won the Dutch title without losing a match.\n\nRomario was the reigning Fifa World Player of the Year — while Barcelona strike partner, Hristo Stoichkov had finally won the Ballon d’Or.\n\nThe controversial Bulgarian had finished runner-up to Roberto Baggio a year earlier and claimed he should have been honoured.\n\nGeorge Weah would become the first African winner of both awards in January, however.\n\nReal Zaragoza beat Arsenal 2-1 in Cup Winners’ Cup final when David Seaman couldn’t keep out Nayim’s last-gasp effort from just inside the Gunners’ half.\n\nAnd a Parma team led by an attacking duo of Gianfranco Zola and Faustino Asprilla beat Juventus 2-1 over two legs in the Uefa Cup final.\n\nReal Madrid — who were chasing a first European Cup crown for 30 years — beat Deportivo to the La Liga title.\n\nBarcelona finished below Real Betis in fourth.\n\nReal Madrid’s Ivan Zamorano was the league’s top goal scorer with 28 — but 18-year-old Raul looked a good prospect and just finished his debut campaign with nine goals in 28 appearances.\n\nJuventus won Serie A for the 23rd time as they finished ten points ahead of Lazio.\n\nA front trio of Fabrizio Ravanelli, Gianluca Vialli and Alessandro Del Piero proved too much for their rivals.\n\nBut it was newly-promoted Fiorentina who produced the division’s leading goal scorer in Gabriel Batistuta.\n\nMilan, who had been beaten by Ajax in the previous season’s Champions League final finished in fourth place.\n\nThe Rossoneri — who were managed by Fabio Capello — still boated the world’s most-expensive player in Gianluigi Lentini.\n\nThough, the £13million-signing from Torino’s career had nosedived after a serious car crash in the summer of 1993.\n\nWhile Andy Cole had been overtaken by Dennis Bergkamp as the most expensive player in British football history.\n\nBorussia Dortmund won the first of their back-to-back Bundesliga titles which would culminate in a first-ever European Cup crown.\n\nBayern Munich — who had been beat by Ajax in the Champions League semi-finals — finished a measly sixth.\n\nCeltic, who have been Scottish champions for each of the past five seasons, finished fourth in 1995 — behind Motherwell and Hibernian.\n\nRangers, unsurprisingly, were No.1."
