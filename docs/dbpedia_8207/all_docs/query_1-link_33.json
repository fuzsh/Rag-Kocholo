        "text": "Also on this day, Eugene Edward Robertson is born in St. Louis. A 3rd baseman, Gene Robertson played in the major leagues from 1919 to 1928, including winning the 1928 World Series with the Yankees. He finished his career with a .280 batting average, and lived until 1981.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1900: Woolwich Arsenal host East London club West Ham United, and win 1-0.\n\nAlso on this day, Albert J. Trace is born in Chicago. A musician who played minor-league baseball, he wrote songs with his brother Ben Trace, including \"You Call Everybody Darlin'\" and \"If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake.\" He died in 1993.\n\nDecember 25, 1901, 120 years ago:Woolwich Arsenal host Lancashire club Blackpool. The game ends in a 0-0 draw.\n\nDecember 25, 1902:Woolwich Arsenal travel to Staffordshire, and lose 2-1 to Burton United.\n\nDecember 25, 1903: Woolwich Arsenal host Yorkshire club Bradford City, and win 4-1. At the conclusion of the 1903-04 season, Arsenal will be promoted to the Football League Division One for the 1st time.\n\nDecember 25, 1905: Washburn University of Topeka, Kansas, plays Fairmount College, now known as Wichita State University, in Wichita. This game marked an agreed-upon first experiment with the forward pass and the 10-yard requirement for 1st downs. The game ended in a 0-0 tie.\n\nToday, Washburn play in NCAA Division II. Wichita State played in NCAA Division I-A, but suspended its program after the 1985 season.\n\nAlso on this day, Woolwich Arsenal host the defending Football League Champions, North-East club Newcastle United, and win 4-3.\n\nDecember 25, 1906: Woolwich Arsenal host the defending Champions of the Scottish Football League, Celtic of Glasgow, and lose 2-0 in front of 15,000 fans, a big crowd for that era.\n\nDecember 25, 1907:Woolwich Arsenal again host Newcastle United, again the defending Champions, and play to a 2-2 draw.\n\nAlso on this day, John Ross Rosenblatt is born in Omaha, Nebraska. Good enough in baseball to win a scholarship to the University of Iowa, he had to drop out to support his family. He went on to play semipro ball in Omaha for 20 years, played in a 1927 exhibition game with Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, and, in another, batted against Satchel Paige.\n\nIn 1948, Omaha elected him City Commissioner, and he got a stadium built. The College World Series would be held at his stadium, named for him in 1964, from 1950 until 2010, when a replacement was built. In 1954 and again in 1957, he was elected Mayor. Although Jewish, he was called \"the supreme gentleman\" by the city's Archbishop, Gerald T. Bergan. He lived until 1979.\n\nDecember 25, 1908:Woolwich Arsenal visit Leicester Fosse, the club now known as Leicester City, and draw 1-1. In those days, it was a common practice for teams to play each other at one's ground on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, and then travel to the other's ground to play again on December 26, Boxing Day. This was the 1st time that Arsenal did it, and they won the rematch in Plumstead, 2-1.\n\nAlso on this Day, William Benjamin Chapman is born in Nashville. A left fielder, he debuted for the Yankees in 1930, helped them win the World Series in 1932, played in the 1st 4 All-Star Games from 1933 to 1936, and led the American League in stolen bases in 1931, '32, '33 and '37.\n\nBy the last of those years, he was with the Washington Senators, as the dark side of his personality had surfaced. When the Nazis took over Germany in 1933, he took it as a sign that it was okay to yell anti-Semitic slurs and throw fascist salutes at Jewish fans, of which there were plenty in New York City, and, at the time, particularly in The Bronx. That season, sliding into 2nd base, he intentionally spiked Senators 2nd baseman Buddy Myer -- of Jewish descent but not raised in the faith. Myer fought back, and it grew into a 20-minute brawl, and both men were suspended for 5 games and fined $100.\n\nIt wasn't just bigotry that was wrong with him: In 1935, his 1st wife, Mary Elizabeth, filed for divorce, claiming what we would now call domestic abuse. In 1936, his hitting declining and Joe DiMaggio having arrived, Chapman was traded to Washington -- Myer's team. If there were any further incidents between them, they were not publicized. Ironically, one of the players the Yankees got in the trade was Jake Powell, who also turned out to be a nasty bigot.\n\nChapman managed in the minor leagues in 1942, but punched an umpire, and was suspended for the entire 1943 season. In 1944, with World War II having taken so many players, the 35-year-old Chapman was signed by the Brooklyn Dodgers -- which would retroactively become another irony. They traded him to the Philadelphia Phillies in 1945, and they named him their manager, and he continued to play until 1946, finishing with a lifetime batting average of .302.\n\nBut in 1947, when the Phillies went to Brooklyn to play the Dodgers, Chapman launched a fusillade of racial epithets at the Dodgers' new signing, Jackie Robinson. At the time, the press wouldn't get specific, only saying that it was bad enough that even the Southerners on the Dodgers rallied around Jackie.\n\nThe 1950 film The Jackie Robinson Story, with Jackie playing himself, showed a sanitized version of events. But the 2013 film 42 shows Alan Tudyk playing Chapman, and may well have set a record for the most utterances of \"the N-word\" by a white actor in movie history. (Tudyk's career has not suffered for this.)\n\nThe Commissioner of Baseball, Kentucky native (and former Governor and Senator) Albert B. \"Happy\" Chandler, warned the Phillies that there had better not be any incidents during the Dodgers' upcoming roadtrip to Philadelphia. It was suggested that a photograph be taken of Chapman and Robinson shaking hands. Chapman refused, so they posed together holding a bat. There were no further incidents.\n\nChapman was fired in the middle of the 1948 season -- not for the kind of person he was, but for losing. Only once more did he wear a major league uniform, as a coach with the Cincinnati Reds in 1952.\n\nInterviewed by Ray Robinson (a journalist working on a biography of Chapman's long-ago teammate, Lou Gehrig) in 1993, shortly before his death, he expressed regret over his actions, and pointed out that his son was coaching an integrated high school football team in Alabama: \"Look, I'm real proud I've raised my son different. And he gets along well with them. They like him. That's a nice thing, don't you think?\"\n\nAlso on this day, Joe Gregg Moore is born in Gause, Texas, outside Houston. A left fielder, \"Jo-Jo\" Moore played for the New York Giants from 1930 to 1941, helping them win 3 National League Pennants and the 1933 World Series. He was a 6-time All-Star, and retired with a lifetime batting average of .298. He lived until 2001.\n\nAlso on this day, Albert Cohen (no middle name) is born in Brooklyn, and grows up in Rockville Centre, Long Island. An outfielder, \"Alta\" Cohen was an All-Star in the minor leagues, but didn't play much in the majors, spending parts of the 1931 and 1932 seasons with the Brooklyn Dodgers, and the 1933 season with the Philadelphia Phillies. He became a businessman in Essex County, New Jersey, and lived until 2003.\n\nDecember 25, 1909: Woolwich Arsenal, by now in a financial meltdown that will see them just barely saved from going out of business in the Spring, again host Newcastle United, finishing up what is still the most productive decade in their history, and lose 3-0.\n\nAlso on this day, Bryan Morel Grant Jr. is born in Atlanta. Only 5-foot-4, and thus known as \"Bitsy\" Grant, he still became one of the top tennis players of the 1930s. His upset wins earned him the nickname \"Itsy Bitsy the Giant Killer.\"\n\nHe never won a major: The closest he came was in the Semifinals of the U.S. Open in 1935 and 1936. He was elected to the International Tennis and Georgia Sports Halls of Fame, and died in 1986.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1911, 110 years ago: Not that most people then rooting for Woolwich Arsenal cared about who the opponent was, but the Gunners lose 5-0 to Tottenham at White Hart Lane, in front of a huge crowd for the time, 47,000. The next day, the clubs meet again at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal win 3-1.\n\nAlso on this day, the 4,000-seat Patrick Arena opens in Victoria, the capital of the Province of British Columbia, with the 1st artificial ice surface in Western Canada. It is built by brothers Frank and Lester Patrick, who owned, ran and played for the Victoria Senators of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The team would later be known as the Victoria Aristocrats and the Victoria Cougars.\n\nIn 1925, by then members of the Western Canada Hockey League, the Cougars beat the NHL Champion Montreal Canadiens, and won the Stanley Cup. They remain the last non-NHL team, and the last team from British Columbia, to win the Cup.\n\nFrank sold his share of the team to Lester, and led the Vancouver Millionaires to the 1915 Stanley Cup, still the only one won by a Vancouver team. In 1926, Lester became the general manager and head coach of the expansion New York Rangers. Neither was involved with the arena bearing their family name anymore.\n\nOn November 11, 1929, it burned down -- usually considered to be arson. It would take until 1949 for a new Victoria Memorial Arena to be built (not on the same site) and for professional hockey in Victoria to be restored. In 2005, \"The Barn on Blanshard\" was replaced on the same site by a new arena, the 7,000-seat Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre. It is home to the Victoria Royals of the Western Hockey League.\n\nAlso on this day, Lon Worth Evans is born in Fort Worth, Texas. A 2-way tackle, he won a Southwest Conference Chamionship with Texas Christian University in 1932, and an NFL Championship with the Green Bay Packers in 1936. The Packers elected him to their team Hall of Fame, and he lived until 1992.\n\nDecember 25, 1912: Arsenal host Nottingham club Notts County, and draw 0-0. The 1912-13 season will be, competitively speaking, the worst in Arsenal's history, the only time they will ever be relegated to the 2nd division. Team owner Henry Norris, a real estate tycoon and a Member of Parliament, decided that the location in Southeast London, then having poor transportation links, was a problem.\n\nSo he bought land in Islington, in North London, and built a new stadium, officially named the Arsenal Stadium, but nicknamed Highbury after the neighborhood. It was much easier to reach for clubs both inside and outside London. Alas, it would begin life outside the top flight.\n\nIn 1987, the Docklands Light Railway began service, including to the area that was once home to Arsenal. That didn't help the team. But in 1913, the Highbury area included a stop on the London Underground's Piccadilly Line.\n\nIn 1932, Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman convinced the company then running the Underground (what we would call a subway system) to rename the station closest to the stadium \"Arsenal.\" The old tiles reading \"GILLESPIE ROAD\" can still be seen on the wall of the station, and motormen who are fans of arch-rival Tottenham Hotspur will, inevitably, use the train's public-address system to identify the station as \"Gillespie Road\" instead of Arsenal.\n\nTo this day, Arsenal are the only London-area team to have a stop named for them. With Tottenham having built a new stadium, there is a proposal to rename the White Hart Lane national railway station \"Tottenham Hotspur,\" but it has not been acted upon.\n\nAlso on this day, Quincy Thomas Trouppe is born in Dublin, Georgia. A catcher, he was an 8-time Negro League All-Star, playing from 1930 to 1948, before finally being accepted into white baseball. He only played 6 games in the major leagues, all in 1952 for the Cleveland Indians, at age 39.\n\nBut one of those games deserves to be remembered: On May 3, Sam Jones came in to relieve for the Indians, and Quincy Trouppe was catching. This made them the 1st all-black battery in American League history, 3 years after Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe of the Brooklyn Dodgers had done it in the National League. Trouppe was elected to the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and lived until 1993.\n\nDecember 25, 1913: Woolwich Arsenal travel to Yorkshire and beat Bradford Park Avenue (not to be confused with Bradford City) 3-2. At the conclusion of the season, Norris, noting that the club no longer plays in Woolwich, drops the locality from the name, and it becomes simply \"Arsenal Football Club.\" Many fans will continue to call the club what they've been calling it: \"The Arsenal.\" Many still do refer to it as such, writing and typing, Capital T, Capital A.\n\nDecember 25, 1914: Upon hearing German soldiers sing Christmas carols in their trench on the Western Front of what was then called The Great War (later World War I), the British soldiers start to do so in theirs. Soon, the men on both sides come out of their trenches, and stop treating each other as enemies for a few hours, exchanging food, drinks, and trinkets. It becomes known as the Christmas Truce.\n\nLegend has it that there was even a soccer game. Sorry, forgot to \"speak English\" there: A football match. It's not clear which side produced the ball, but according to most accounts that discuss the match, the Germans beat the English, 3-2.\n\nThis is the 1st time that Englishmen would be defeated by Germans at their national game. There have been many more. But, as England manager Alf Ramsey pointed out before the 1966 World Cup Final, twice in the 20th Century, the English (well, the British, and their allies) would beat the Germans at their national game (war), and on their soil no less.\n\nMilitary historian Andrew Robertshaw (a technical advisor for the film version of the World War I story War Horse) says such a truce would have been unthinkable a year later: \"This was before the poisoned gas, before aerial bombardment. By the end of 1915, both sides were far too bitter for this to happen again.\"\n\nIn 1997, Garth Brooks and Joe Henry wrote a song titled \"Belleau Wood\" for Brooks' album Sevens. It describes a Christmas truce between American and German soldiers at Belleau Wood in 1917. But this is fiction, as the battle of Belleau Wood took place in June 1918, in Aisne, Picardy, France.\n\nThe Football League did not suspend operations until the conclusion of the 1914-15 season. On Christmas, Arsenal began a home-and-home series, defeating Leicester Fosse away 4-1 on the 25th, and 6-0 at home on the 26th.\n\nDecember 25, 1915: With rosters depleted by the war, Arsenal travel to Upton Park in East London for what is, essentially, a reserve match, and lose 8-2 to West Ham United.\n\nDecember 25, 1916: Arsenal travel to the Park Royal Ground in West London, then the stadium of Queens Park Rangers. They beat QPR 3-2.\n\nDecember 25, 1917: Arsenal travel to Craven Cottage in West London, home of Fulham, and play to a 1-1 draw.\n\nDecember 25, 1918: The war finally over, but the League deciding not to re-establish play until the following season (September 1919), Arsenal travel to East London, and lose 3-2 to Clapton Orient, the club now known as Leyton Orient.\n\nIt's a big day for Arsenal for another reason, although no one will know it for nearly 50 years. Bertram Mee (no middle name) is born in Bulwell, Nottinghamshire. A winger, he played for Mansfield Town and Southampton, but his playing career was cut short by injury.\n\nThis had also been the case for Arsenal players Tom Whittaker and Billy Milne, and Bertie Mee followed the path that each of those men took, taking what he'd learned in treating his injury and putting it to work as a physiotherapist, becoming Arsenal's, and in 1966 becoming Arsenal's manager. But before going to Arsenal, World War II intervened, and he entered the Royal Army Medical Corps.\n\nHe rose to the rank of Sergeant, but after succeeding Milne as physiotherapist in 1960 and being named manager in 1966, he remained a Sergeant through and through. He instilled discipline in an Arsenal side that was nearly relegated in 1966, a team that was not only terrible, but was perhaps the least interesting in London, what with Tottenham and West Ham having won major trophies in the decade, and Chelsea, Fulham and Queens Park Rangers all having gotten favorable notices in the media for their play.\n\nIn 1966-67, he handled the personnel management and the discipline, while assistant manager Dave Sexton trained the offense. After that season, Sexton was named manager at Chelsea, but former star right back Don Howe, another whose career ended too soon by injury, was named assistant manager, and he straightened out the defense. Arsenal reached the Final of the League Cup in 1968 and 1969, won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1970, and then, with a few adjustments due to injury that turned out to be very fortuitous, won both the Football League and the FA Cup -- \"The Double\" -- in 1971.\n\nIn 1972, with Howe having left for the manager's job at West Bromwich Albion, Arsenal finished 5th in a tight 5-team race, and lost the FA Cup Final. In 1973, they finished a close 2nd and lost the FA Cup Semifinal. Unfortunately, Mee saw every challenge to his authority, even minor ones, as betrayal, and acted the Sergeant too often. And he started a tradition followed by Terry Neill in 1980, George Graham in 1991, and Arsène Wenger in 2005: Breaking up a great Arsenal team too soon. Both of these problems manifested themselves in his sale of Captain Frank McLintock after the 1973 season.\n\nArsenal fell apart, and nearly got relegated in the 1975 and 1976 seasons, barely staying up both times. Mee was finally let go. He later served as Graham Taylor's assistant at Watford, and lived until 2001. He won 241 games as Arsenal manager, a record that stood until surpassed by Wenger in 2006.\n\nAlso on this day, Ermal Glenn Allen is born in Kyles Ford, Tennessee, on the State Line with Kentucky. He was All-Conference in basketball at the University of Kentucky. He was also a quarterback there, and was a member of the Cleveland Browns, backing up Otto Graham on their 1947 team that won the All-America Football Conference title.\n\nHe later coached at Kentucky under Bear Bryant, and on the Dallas Cowboys under Tom Landry, serving on the staff that won Super Bowls VI and XII. A member of the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame, he died in 1988.\n\nDecember 25, 1919: Arsenal, back in League play and promoted back to Division One, travel to Derbyshire, and lose 3-2 to Derby County. The next day, the teams meet at Highbury, and Arsenal win 1-0.\n\nAlso on this day, Cliftonhill Stadium opens in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It is the home of Albion Rovers Football Club. They have won Scottish soccer's 2nd division in 1934, its 3rd in 1989, and its 4th in 2015. But they have rarely been in the 1st division, under any name. They have never won the Scottish Cup, but in that 1st season, 1919-20, they got to the Final. They have won 8 Lanarkshire Cups, but the last was in 1987.\n\nToday, it is known as The Reigart Stadium for sponsorship purposes, and only the 1,572-seat Airdrie Stand remains open. Currently, Rovers are in the Scottish League Two, Scotland's 4th division. In the 1997-98 and 1998-99 seasons, Hamilton Academical F.C. groundshared at Cliftonhill, while their Douglas Park was rebuilt.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1920: Arsenal go to Goodison Park in Liverpool, and beat Everton 4-2.\n\nAlso, the National Hockey League, in its 4th season, plays a game on Christmas Day for the 1st time. The Toronto St. Patricks beat the Montreal Canadiens, 5-4 at the Mutual Street Arena in Toronto. True to their name, the St. Patricks wear green. In 1927, having been bought by hyper-patriotic Canadian Conn Smythe, their name will be changed to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and their solid color to blue.\n\nDecember 25, 1921, 100 years ago: Melvin Anthony Maceau is born in Milwaukee. A center, Mel Maceau played for the Cleveland Browns, and helped them win the All-America Football Conference in 1946, 1947 and 1948, the last of these an undefeated season. He was cut before the 1949 season, when the Browns again won the AAFC title, before joining the NFL. He died in 1981.\n\nAlso on this day, Richard James Barwegen is born in Chicago. A guard, Dick Barwegan (somewhere down the line, he changed the spelling) starred at Purdue University, and made 4 Pro Bowls with the Chicago Bears and the Baltimore Colts. He died in 1966, and was posthumously named to the NFL's 1940s All-Decade Team and the 100 Greatest Chicago Bears, in commemoration of the Bears' 100th Season in 2019. However, he is not yet in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nDecember 25, 1922: Arsenal go to Burnden Park in Bolton, Lancashire, and lose to Bolton Wanderers 4-1.\n\nAlso on this day, Julius Neal Watlington is born in Yanceyville, North Carolina. A catcher, he arrived in professional baseball in 1941, then went off to World War II, and was wounded and received a Purple Heart. He appeared in 21 major league games, all with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1953, and remained at the Triple-A level until retiring after the 1958 season. He died on December 29, 2019, 4 days after his 97th birthday.\n\nAlso on this day, Stephen Wojciechowski (no middle name) is born in Fort William, Ontario, now part of Thunder Bay. A right wing, playing under the name of Steve Wochy, he played 49 games for the Detroit Red Wings in the 1944-45 season, and 5 in 1946-47. He continued playing professional hockey until 1955, helping the Cleveland Barons win the Calder Cup, the Championship of the American Hockey League, in 1951 and '53.\n\nAt 99, he is the oldest living former NHL player, and the last to have played in the NHL during World War II.\n\nAlso on this day, Félix Loustau (no middle name) is born in Avellaneda, in the state of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A left wing, he starred on the Buenos Aires soccer team River Plate. With Juan Carlos Muñoz, José Manuel Moreno, Adolfo Pedernera and Ángel Amadeo Labruna, he formed a 5-man forward line known as La Máquina, \"the Machine.\" They won Argentine league titles in 1941, 1942, 1945 and 1947.\n\nLoustau also helped Argentina win the Copa América, South America's continental championship for national teams, in 1945, 1946 and 1947. He died in 2003. Muñoz was the last survivor of La Máquina, living until 2009.\n\nDecember 25, 1923: James Gamble Nippert dies from blood poisoning, the result of an injury he suffered a month earlier playing football at the University of Cincinnati, in a win over arch-rival Miami University of Ohio. The son of a judge, and of an heir to the Procter & Gamble fortune, he had survived serving in World War I, only to face this fate. He was only 23 years old.\n\nUC's stadium, built the following year, is named for him. His brother Louis Nippert would later own the Cincinnati Reds.\n\nDecember 25, 1924: The Los Angeles Christmas Festival is held at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. A football game is played, and the hosts, the University of Southern California, defeat the University of Missouri, winners of the Big Six Conference (which would eventually evolve into the Big Twelve), 20-7. Due to the expense of putting it all together, the Festival and its game would not be repeated.\n\nTwo games were played in the NHL. The Montreal Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins, 5-0 at the Mount Royal Arena in Montreal. And the Hamilton Tigers beat the Toronto St. Patricks, 8-1 at the Barton Street Arena in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nAlso on this day, Arsenal go to St. Andrews Stadium in Birmingham, and lose to Birmingham City 2-1.\n\nDecember 25, 1925: Arsenal host Notts County at Highbury, and win 3-0.\n\nOn a postseason tour, designed to make as much money as possible in the wake of superstar running back Red Grange having revolutionized the NFL, the Chicago Bears play a team known as the Coral Gables Collegians, made up of former University of Miami players. The Bears win, 7-0, on the UM campus in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables, Florida.\n\nAlso on this day, the Final of the South American Championship (forerunner of soccer's Copa América) is played at Estadio Ministro Brin y Senguel in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Brazil scored 2 goals in 3 minutes to take the lead, but Argentina scored in the 41st and 55th minutes to achieve a draw, which was all they needed to win the tournament.\n\nAlso on this day, Ned Franklin Garver is born in Ney, Ohio, outside Toledo. In 1951, he went 20-12 pitching for the St. Louis Browns, the team that became the Baltimore Orioles 3 years later. This was quite a feat, considering that the Browns went 52-102 that year. Garver was the starting pitcher for the American League in that year's All-Star Game in Detroit.\n\nPitching in the major leagues from 1948 to 1961, with mostly bad teams, Garver finished with a career record of 129-157. But he must have had some talent, above and beyond his remarkable 1951 season, because the great Ted Williams said, \"He could throw anything up there and get me out.\" He died on February 26, 2017, age 91.\n\nAlso on this day, Samuel Patterson Smyth Pollock is born in Montreal. Hired by the Montreal Canadiens' front office in 1959, he was general manager from 1963 to 1978, helping to build 12 Stanley Cup winners. He is in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and died in 2007.\n\nDecember 25, 1926: Two games are played in the NHL. The Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Toronto St. Patricks, 3-2 at the Duquesne Gardens in Pittsburgh. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Detroit Cougars, 2-0 at the Chicago Coliseum.\n\nThe Pirates, named for the baseball team in town, moved in 1930, becoming the Philadelphia Quakers, and folded after 1 more season. The Cougars became the Detroit Falcons in 1930 and the Detroit Red Wings in 1932. The Chicago franchise, like the Wings and the Pirates founded for this season, would spell \"Black Hawks\" as 2 words until 1986, when their founding charter was found, and it was discovered that they'd officially been registered with the NHL with \"Blackhawks\" written as 1 word. It's been \"Blackhawks\" ever since.\n\nAlso on this day, Richard Wesley Manville is born in Des Moines, Iowa. A man brilliant enough to earn degrees from both Harvard and Yale, Dick Manville was also a major league pitcher -- briefly. He pitched 1 game, 2 innings, for the Boston Braves in 1950; and 11 games for the Chicago Cubs in 1952. He died in 2019, at age 93.\n\nDecember 25, 1927: The New York Rangers beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 2-0 at the old Madison Square Garden.\n\nAlso on this day, Jacob Nelson Fox is born in St. Thomas, Pennsylvania. Nellie Fox, a diminutive but crafty 2nd baseman, had his Number 2 retired by the Chicago White Sox, whom he led to an American League Pennant in 1959, resulting in his being named the AL's Most Valuable Player. Yankee pitching legend Whitey Ford called him the toughest out he ever faced, and author, radio show host and White Sox fan Jean Shepherd called him his favorite player of all time.\n\nAlong with his contemporaries Phil Rizzuto, Gil Hodges and Richie Ashburn, and the younger Ron Santo, Fox was one of those guys that everyone hoped would one day get into the Baseball Hall of Fame, but wondered why it was taking so long. Rizzuto lived long enough to make it, in 1994. So did Ashburn, in 1995. Fox didn't, dying of skin cancer in 1975 and getting elected in 1997. Santo didn't, either, dying in 2010 and being elected in 2012. Hodges died in 1972, and his supporters are still waiting.\n\nAlso on this day, Leo Roman Kubiak is born in Toledo, Ohio. He played professional baseball, but didn't make the major leagues. He did make them in basketball, playing for the Waterloo Hawks of Iowa from 1948 to 1950. He is one of the last surviving players from the founding days of the NBA.\n\nDecember 25, 1928: Arsenal play their 1st Christmas Day match under manager Herbert Chapman. They lose 5-2, away to Blackburn Rovers.\n\nThere were 3 NHL games played. The New York Americans beat the New York Rangers, 1-0 at the old Madison Square Garden. (Officially, it was a home game for the Rangers.) Charley McVeigh won it for the Amerks with 3:36 left in regulation.\n\nThe Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 2-1 at the brand-new Boston Garden. And the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Montreal Maroons, 4-1 at the Mutual Street Arena.\n\nAlso on this day, Michael John Blyzka is born outside Detroit in Hamtramck, Michigan. A pitcher, he played for the last St. Louis Browns team in 1953, and moved with them to play for the 1st Baltimore Orioles team in 1954.\n\nAfter that season, he was part of the biggest trade in baseball history, 17 players, going to the Yankees, along with Don Larsen and Bob Turley. But he never played for the Yankees, or any other team again. He died in 2004.\n\nDecember 25, 1929: Arsenal, on the way to their 1st major trophy (the 1930 FA Cup), travel to Fratton Park, and beat Hampshire team Portsmouth 1-0 on a goal by their diminutive but prolific inside left Alex James.\n\nAlso, the Boston Bruins beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 6-2 at the Boston Garden.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1930: Arsenal travel to Manchester, and beat Manchester City at Maine Road, 4-1. Goals by Joe Hulme, David Jack, Jack Lambert (no relation to the later Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker of the same name), and a penalty by Cliff Bastin. This is the start of a 3-game stretch where Arsenal score 14 goals, on the way to their 1st League title in April 1931.\n\nThere were 4 NHL games played. The New York Rangers beat the Ottawa Senators, 4-1 at the Ottawa Auditorium. The New York Americans beat the Montreal Maroons, 2-1 at the old Madison Square Garden. The Boston Bruins beat the Philadelphia Quakers, 8-0 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Falcons beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 10-1 at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit.\n\nAlso on this day, Emanoul Aghassian is born in Salma, in the Persian Empire, present-day Iran. He represented Iran as a boxer in the Olympics of 1948 in London and 1952 in Helsinki, Finland. After the 1952 Games, he and his brother Samuel moved to Chicago. Emanoul changed his name to the more American-sounding Mike Agassi. He later took a job at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas, where he raised his children, including his son Andre Agassi.\n\nAndre not only won \"the career Grand Slam,\" winning 4 Australian Opens, 2 U.S. Opens, and Wimbledon and the French Open once each, but, in Atlanta in 1996, won what had eluded his father: An Olympic Gold Medal. Mike died this past September 24, at age 90.\n\nDecember 25, 1931, 90 years ago:Arsenal travel to Yorkshire, and lose to Sheffield United 4-1 at Bramall Lane. They go on to a dubious near-Double, finishing 2nd in the League and losing the FA Cup Final.\n\nThe New York Rangers put coal in the stockings of their Madison Square Garden tenants, beating the New York Americans 6-0.\n\nAlso on this day, Charles Grice Driesell is born in Norfolk, Virginia. Although naturally lefthanded, he was nicknamed for country singer William \"Lefty\" Frizzell, a star in his youth. He played basketball at Duke University before that became a big deal, then became a coach, starting at his alma mater in Norfolk, Granby High School.\n\nIn 1960, he got his 1st college job, at Davidson College in Davidson, North Carolina, getting them to what we would now call the NCAA Sweet Sixteen in 1966 and the Elite Eight in 1968. That got the attention of the University of Maryland, and they hired him in 1969.\n\nOn July 12, 1973, Lefty Driesell and 2 friends were surf fishing in Bethany Beach, Delaware, when they saw a fire at a resort building. They rushed to shore, and Driesell broke down a door and rescued at least 10 children. It would be another half an hour before the firemen arrived. He said he wasn't a hero: \"It was just lucky that we were fishing right in front of the houses.\"\n\nHe built a pretty good coaching record in College Park, too. He reached the Sweet Sixteen 5 times, and the Elite Eight in 1973 and 1975. He won them Atlantic Coast Conference Championships in the regular season in 1975 and 1980, and in the Tournament in 1984, led by a powerful sophomore forward named Len Bias. Other star players of his included Tom McMillen, Len Elmore, John Lucas, Albert King and Buck Williams.\n\nIn 1986, Bias had a chance to be taken as the Number 1 pick in the NBA Draft. He wasn't: Brad Daugherty of North Carolina was, by the Cleveland Cavaliers. But the Boston Celtics had traded up for the Number 2 pick, and chose Bias. When asked about him, Driesell said, \"Leonard's only vice is ice cream.\" This turned out not to be the case. It was also revealed, after Bias' cocaine-induced death, that he'd used up his eligibility. The scandal forced Driesell to resign.\n\nHe returned to the coaching ranks in 1988, with James Madison University of Harrisonburg, Virginia. He led them to 5 Conference Championships. He closed his career at Georgia State University, and led them to 4 Conference Championships. In so doing, he became the 1st coach to win more than 100 games at 4 different NCAA Division I schools. His final record, from 1960 to 2003, was 786-394. He is still alive, a member of the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame, and was just elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nDecember 25, 1932: The New York Rangers beat the Montreal Maroons, 2-0 at the old Madison Square Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 4-0 at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit.\n\nDecember 25, 1933: Having won the League the season before, Arsenal travel to Yorkshire, and beat Leeds United 1-0 at Elland Road. Bastin scores. Despite Chapman's death 2 weeks after Christmas, they win the League again under interim manager Joe Shaw.\n\nThe New York Rangers beat the Montreal Maroons, 3-0 at Madison Square Garden. And the Ottawa Senators beat the Detroit Red Wings, 6-3 at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit.\n\nAlso on this day, Frederick Sasakamoose is born in Ahtahkakoop, Saskatchewan. A center, on February 27, 1954, Fred Saskamoose, of the Cree tribe, became the 1st indigenous Canadian to play in the National Hockey League. But he only played 11 NHL games, all that season, and all with the Chicago Blackhawks -- appropriately enough, also named for a Native chief.\n\nHe continued playing in the minor leagues until 1960, went into coaching, and served for 6 years as Chief of a Cree reservation: \"Chief Running Deer.\" He was named to the Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame and the Order of Canada, and died on November 24, 2020, at 86.\n\nAlso on this day, Benjamin Basil Heatley is born in Kenilworth, Warwickshire, England. On June 13, 1964, Basil Heatley won the Polytechnic Marathon in London, running it in 2 hours, 13 minutes, 55 seconds to break the world record for the marathon. But he would only win a Silver Medal in the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, as the man whose record he broke, 1960 Olympic Gold Medalist Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia, reclaimed the Gold and the record. Heatley died in 2019, at age 85.\n\nDecember 25, 1934: Now managed by George Allison, Arsenal defeat Lancashire club Preston North End 5-3, at Highbury. Hulme scores 2, Bastin 1, Ray Bowden 1, and they also get the benefit of an own goal by Preston. The next day, Preston get revenge, 2-1 at their home ground of Deepdale. Arsenal go on to make it 3 straight League titles.\n\nIn the 1st season of the Football League, 1888-89, Preston went unbeaten, winning 18 games, drawing 4 and losing none. They also won the FA Cup, making the 1st \"Double.\" An unbeaten League season would not happen again until Arsenal in 2003-04: As broadcaster Alan Parry said, \"They were, quite literally, unbeatable: Played 38, won 24, drawn 12, lost exactly none!\"\n\nFour games were played in the NHL: At The Garden, the Rangers beat the Americans, 3-1. The Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Montreal Canadiens, 6-2 at the Montreal Forum. The Montreal Maroons beat the Boston Bruins, 5-3 at the Boston Garden. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1 at the Olympia Stadium in Detroit.\n\nAlso on this day, Santa Anita Park opens in Los Angeles. Still the West Coast's premier thoroughbred horse racing track, it annually hosts the Santa Anita Derby, one of the warmup races for the Triple Crown. It has also hosted the Breeders' Cup more times than any other track, 10: 1986, 1993, 2003, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019.\n\nIt's yet another location which, due to its proximity to Hollywood, has frequently served as a filming location for its usual subject: The Marx Brothers' A Day at the Races and the original version of A Star Is Born in 1937, and The Story of Seabiscuit in 1949. Seabiscuit had famously won his last race there, the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap. The ill-fated 2012 TV series Luck was also filmed there.\n\nIt also includes statues of several horses, including Seabiscuit, John Henry and Zenyatta; and jockeys such as Johnny Longden, Bill Shoemaker and Laffit Pincay Jr.\n\nAlso on this day, Charles Alfonzo Beamon is born in Oakland, California. He attended McClymonds High School at the same time as Bill Russell, Frank Robinson and Curt Flood. He was a September callup for the Baltimore Orioles in 1956, '57 and '58, going 3-3. He died in 2016. His son Charlie Beamon Jr. played 1st base in the major leagues from 1978 to 1981.\n\nDecember 25, 1935:Liverpool win at Highbury, 2-1. Arsenal go on to win the 1936 FA Cup.\n\nTwo games were played in the NHL. The New York Rangers beat the Boston Bruins, 3-2 at the Boston Garden. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-0 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nDecember 25, 1936: Arsenal host Preston, and win 4-1, on goals by Jackie Milne, Alf Kirchen, and 2 by Ted Drake.\n\nThe Chicago Black Hawks and the Detroit Red Wings couldn't find a winner, playing to a 1-1 tie at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nDecember 25, 1937: Three games were played in the NHL. The Boston Bruins beat the New York Americans, 1-0 at Madison Square Garden. The Canadiens beat the Maroons, 2-0 at the Montreal Forum. At the end of the 1937-38 season, the Maroons folded, unable to keep going during the Great Depression. And the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs played to a tie, 1-1 at Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nAlso on this day, Bronko Nagurski Jr. is born in International Falls, Minnesota. That was his legal name, unlike his father, who was born Bronislau Nagurski. An offensive tackle, he played at Notre Dame, and then 7 seasons with the Canadian Football League's Hamilton Tiger-Cats. (That makes more sense than you might think: International Falls is a border town, across the Rainy River from Fort Frances, Ontario, and closer to Thunder Bay and Winnipeg than it is to Minneapolis.)\n\nHe was a 3-time CFL All-Star, and helped the Ticats win the 1963 and 1965 Grey Cups. He died in 2011.\n\nAlso on this day, Oleg Georgievich Grigoryev is born in Moscow. He won the Gold Medal in the bantamweight division of Olympic boxing in Rome in 1960, the same tournament in which Cassius Clay (later Muhammad Ali) won in the middleweight division. He is still alive.\n\nDecember 25, 1938: Three games were played in the NHL. The New York Americans beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 5-1 at Madison Square Garden. The New York Rangers beat the Boston Bruins, 1-0 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Canadiens, 4-1 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Jack Edwin Hamilton is born in Burlington, Iowa. He went 32-40 in 8 seasons as a major league pitcher, including for the Mets in 1966 and 1967. However, the Mets traded him to the California Angels, and on August 18, 1967, he hit Tony Conigliaro of the Boston Red Sox in the head, ruining his career.\n\nIt was not intentional: He had no reputation for hitting batters, and hit only 1 other batter during the course of the season. Also, someone had thrown a smoke bomb onto the field a few minutes earlier, and the smoke hadn't fully cleared, making it harder to see the ball during a night game.\n\nHamilton never recovered from the stigma of having hit Tony C, and retired after 2 more seasons. He later ran restaurants in his native Iowa, and in Branson, Missouri, where he died in 2018, at age 79.\n\nAlso on this day, Joseph Jean-Noel Yves Picard in Montréal, Québec. A defenseman, he won the Stanley Cup with the 1965 Montreal Canadiens, and reached the Stanley Cup Finals 3 more times, with the 1968, 1969 and 1970 St. Louis Blues.\n\nHe is best remembered for his unsuccessful attempt to trip Bobby Orr of the Boston Bruins up in overtime of Game 4 of the 1970 Finals, allowing Orr to score the Cup-winning goal, and putting Picard into perhaps the most famous photograph in the history of hockey.\n\nNoel Picard was a member of 2 1st-year NHL expansion teams, the 1967-68 Blues and the 1972-73 Atlanta Flames. He later became a broadcaster for the Blues, and ran a restaurant in the suburbs of St. Louis. He died in 2017.\n\nDecember 25, 1939: With World War II underway, the Football League has again suspended operations, and won't start again until the 1946-47 season (although the Football Association will play a full FA Cup tournament in 1945-46). Arsenal host East London team Clapton Orient, and win 3-0. Kirchen, Jack Crayston and Reg Lewis score the goals. Clapton Orient is now known as Leyton Orient, nicknamed just \"Orient,\" or \"The O's.\"\n\nThree games were played in the NHL. The New York Rangers beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 4-1 at Madison Square Garden. The Boston Bruins beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 6-3 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Canadiens, 3-1 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Alex Smith (as far as I can tell, his full name) is born in Cowie, Stirlingshire, Scotland. A forward who never won a trophy as a player, he had more success as a manager, winning the Scottish Cup with St. Mirren in 1987 and Aberdeen in 1990, also winning the Scottish League Cup in 1990. He last managed in 2017, on an interim basis with Falkirk.\n\nAlso on this day, Everett Ben Krug is born in Los Angeles. A career backup catcher, \"Chris\" Krug played for the Chicago Cubs when Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers pitched a perfect game against them on September 9, 1965. He was also an original San Diego Padre in 1969, but that was his last season in the major leagues. He is still alive.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1940: South Side Park burns down in Chicago. As far as anyone knows, the fire is not purposely set. It was the 1st home of the American League's Chicago White Sox (1901 to 1910), and of the Negro Leagues' Chicago American Giants (1910 to 1940). The American Giants won 7 Pennants while playing there, the White Sox 2.\n\nThere were 3 games played in the NHL. The New York Rangers played the Chicago Black Hawks to a tie, 3-3 at Madison Square Garden. The New York Americans lost to the Boston Bruins, 8-1 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-2 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, under the wartime conditions of depleted rosters, Tommy Lawton plays for Everton against Liverpool at Anfield in the morning. Liverpool win, 3-1. Then he is asked to play as a guest player for Merseyside club Tranmere Rovers at nearby Cheshire club Crewe Alexandra in the afternoon. As he recalled, \"The Tranmere people came into the dressing room, and asked if anyone wanted to play, as they were two men short. I said, 'Go on, I'll help you out.' And I did.\"\n\nHe didn't help much: Crewe won the match, 2-1. Still, on Christmas Day 1940, Lawton played a full 90 minutes in the afternoon, after having already done so in the morning. Given the heavy leather balls and ragged pitches (especially in Winter) of the era, this may qualify as a Christmas miracle.\n\nJust 4 days after Christmas, the Luftwaffe bombed the Rolls-Royce factory in Crewe, which had been making Spitfire planes for the Royal Air Force.\n\nAlso on this day, Arsenal lose 4-2 away to West Ham United. They finished 4th in the Southern Regional, the Hammers 2nd, and Crystal Palace of Southeast London won.\n\nDecember 25, 1941, 80 years ago: Arsenal host Fulham and win 2-0, on goals by Kirchen and Lewis. Although both men's best years happened during The War (always Capital T, Capital W), Lewis would score twice to win Arsenal the 1950 FA Cup Final.\n\nIn the NHL, the New York Rangers beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 5-2 at Madison Square Garden. And the Brooklyn Americans -- desperate to hang on, the other New York team rebranded as \"Brooklyn,\" though they were still playing at The Garden -- lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 3-2 in overtime at the Olympia Stadium. And the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Boston Bruins, 2-0 at Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nAlso on this day, David Wayne Parks is born outside Dallas in Muenster, Texas. He starred as an end at Texas Tech, and was the 1st pick in the 1964 NFL Draft, the 1st receiver so honored, by the San Francisco 49ers. In 1965, he led the NFL in receptions, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns, the \"receiving triple crown.\"\n\nHe played pro ball until 1974, making 3 Pro Bowls, catching 360 passes for 5,619 yards and 44 touchdowns. He is in the College Football and Texas Sports Halls of Fame. He went on to work in law enforcement, and invented a garden tool, the Speedy Weedy. He died on August 7, 2019.\n\nAlso on this day, Noël Le Graët is born in Bourbriac, Côtes-d'Armor, France. Since 2011, he has been President of the French Football Federation (FFF), the governing body of French soccer. Under his leadership, France has advanced to the Final of Euro 2016, losing to Portugal, and won the 2018 World Cup, beating Croatia in the Final.\n\nDecember 25, 1942:Arsenal travel to Stamford Bridge in West London, and lose 5-2 to Chelsea.\n\nIn the NHL, the New York Rangers beat the Detroit Red Wings, 3-1 at the Olympia Stadium. And the Montreal Canadiens and the Chicago Black Hawks played to a 2-2 tie at the Montreal Forum.\n\nAlso on this day, Françoise Dürr is born in Algiers, in what was then French Algeria. \"Frankie\" was one of the top women's tennis players of the late 1960s and early 1970s, particularly in doubles. In singles, she won the 1967 French Open. She is still alive.\n\nDecember 25, 1943:Arsenal travel to The Den in South London, and beat Millwall 5-1. Lewis scores twice. Goals are also scored by Drake, Denis Compton and Bobby Flavell.\n\nThe brothers Leslie and Denis Compton were accomplished athletes, both of whom played soccer for Arsenal (Les was better at that sport) and cricket for Middlesex County Cricket Club (Denis was better at that one).\n\nIn the NHL, the New York Rangers beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 5-3 at Maple Leaf Gardens. The Montreal Canadiens beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 5-1 at the Montreal Forum. And the Boston Bruins and the Detroit Red Wings played to a 4-4 tie at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Howard James Twilley Jr. is born in Houston. In 1965, playing wide receiver for the University of Tulsa, he was runner-up to USC running back Mike Garrett for the Heisman Trophy. He became an original 1966 Miami Dolphin, and was the only one to make it to their undefeated 1972 team that won Super Bowl VII, also winning Super Bowl VIII.\n\nHe later ran a string of Athlete's Foot sporting-goods stores, and then an investment firm, and is in the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. He is still alive.\n\nAlso on this day, Dennis Eugene Musgraves is born in Indianapolis. A pitcher, he made 5 major league appearances, all in July 1965 for the Mets. He had no decisions, but had a 0.56 ERA. This begs the question: As bad as the Mets were, why didn't they give him more of a chance? He stayed in pro ball until 1971, and is still alive.\n\nDecember 25, 1944:Arsenal travel to Griffin Park in West London, and draw 1-1 with Brentford.\n\nOnly 1 game was played in the NHL: The Detroit Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 6-4 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Rodney Jarvis Sherman is born outside Los Angeles in Pasadena, California. A receiver, Rod Sherman played with the Oakland Raiders when they won the 1967 AFL Championship. He was an original Cincinnati Bengal in 1968, and also played for the Denver Broncos and Los Angeles Rams. He is still alive.\n\nAlso on this day, Jair Ventura Filho is born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Known as Jairzinho and nicknamed O Furacão (The Hurricane), he starred with hometown club Botafogo and the Brazilian national soccer team, and won World Cups for his country in 1962 and 1970. He is still alive, and currently manages a Rio-based team in the lower divisions of Brazil's league system.\n\nDecember 25, 1945: With World War II over and victory belonging to the Allies, Arsenal travel to Wales, and lose 2-1 to Newport County at Rodney Parade in Newport.\n\nOne game was played in the NHL: The Detroit Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 6-3 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Kenneth Michael Stabler is born in Foley, Alabama. \"The Snake\" was backup quarterback to Joe Namath at the University of Alabama in their 1964 National Championship season, then led them to another title in 1965. He guided the Oakland Raiders to victory in Super Bowl XI in 1977.\n\nHe once said, \"There's nothing wrong with reading a playbook by the light of a jukebox.\" The writer Jack London, also a noted party animal in Oakland, once wrote, \"I would rather be ashes than dust. I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than be stifled by dry rot. I would rather be a superb meteor than a sleepy, permanent planet.\" Someone once read those words to Stabler, and asked him what he thought they meant. Stabler paused a moment, then said, \"Throw deep.\" He may have been reckless, but he was smart.\n\nSomehow, in spite of all his carousing, Ken Stabler lived until 2015 -- but not long enough to be elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which elected him in a sympathy vote right after his death. He was already a member of the Alabama and Bay Area Sports Halls of Fame.\n\nDecember 25, 1946, 75 years ago: The Buffalo Bisons of the National Basketball League announce that they're moving to the \"Tri-Cities\" of Rock Island and Moline, Illinois, and Davenport, Iowa, and becoming the Tri-Cities Blackhawks. Later, Bettendorf, Iowa will be added to the region's traditional name, making it the \"Quad Cities.\"\n\nThe Blackhawks -- like the Chicago hockey team, named for the famous early 19th Century Native chief of the region -- play in Moline for 5 years, but in 1951, they moved again, becoming the Milwaukee Hawks. In 1955, they became the St. Louis Hawks, reaching 4 NBA Finals including winning the 1958 NBA Championship. In 1968, despite having won a Division title, they moved again, becoming the Atlanta Hawks. Given their attendance problems lately, they may have to move again.\n\nAll 6 NHL teams were in action. The New York Rangers beat the Montreal Canadiens, 2-0 at Madison Square Garden. The Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 5-3 at the Boston Garden. And the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, Arsenal host Portsmouth, and win 2-1 on goals by Jimmy Logie and Ronnie Rooke. Rooke was 35, old for a forward and very old for a good one. But in 1947-48, the season in which he turned 36, he scored 33 goals to help Arsenal win the League.\n\nThat total remains the most any Arsenal player has scored in a post-World War II season, and only 2 Arsenal players since have scored 30 in a League season: Thierry Henry in 2003-04 and Robin van Persie in 2011-12. Rooke did not live to see either achievement, dying in 1985.\n\nAlso on this day, Lawrence Richard Csonka is born in Stow, Ohio, outside Akron. One of many star running backs at Syracuse University, he rushed for 8,081 yards and 64 touchdowns for the Miami Dolphins. He was a 3-time All-Pro, helped the Dolphins to an undefeated season in 1972, capped by Super Bowl VII, and was the MVP of Super Bowl VIII.\n\nHe left the Dolphins to play in the World Football League, but that didn't work out. He came to the New York Giants, but that didn't work out, either, culminating in the 1978 play known as \"The Miracle of the Meadowlands.\" He came back to the Dolphins for 1 more season and retired. He has been elected to the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame. The Dolphins retired his Number 39. He is still alive.\n\nAlso on this day, Gene William Lamont is born in Rockford, Illinois. A catcher, he reached the postseason with the 1972 Detroit Tigers, but was never more than a backup. He is now best remembered as a coach, frequently working under Jim Leyland.\n\nHe reached the postseason as a coach with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1990 and '91, as manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1993 (and was named American League Manager of the Year), the Houston Astros in 2004, and the Tigers in 2006, '09, '11, '12, '13 and '14. He has also managed the Pirates, and now works in the Kansas City Royals' front office.\n\nAlso on this day, John Boyle (no middle name) is born in Motherwell, Scotland. A midfielder, he reached the 1967 FA Cup Final with West London team Chelsea, but lost; and was injured for their 1970 FA Cup Final win. But he got a winner's medal for their 1971 win in the European Cup Winners' Cup.\n\nHe later came to America, and both played for and managed the Tampa Bay Rowdies, winning the NASL Championship as a player in 1975, Tampa Bay's 1st title in any sport. He is still alive.\n\nDecember 25, 1947:Arsenal, now managed by former player and physiotherapist Tom Whittaker, beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield, on 2 goals by Rooke and 1 by Don Roper. As I said, Arsenal go on to win the 1948 League title.\n\nAlso, for the 1st time, the Basketball Association of America, the league that will merge with the NBL in 1949 to form the National Basketball Association, begins a tradition of playing on Christmas Day. The New York Knicks beat the Providence Steamrollers, 89-75 at the old Madison Square Garden. And the Washington Capitols beat the St. Louis Bombers, 73-56 at the St. Louis Arena.\n\nThe entire NHL was in action, and the road team won every game. The New York Rangers beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-0 at the Olympia Stadium. The Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Montreal Canadiens, 3-0 at the Montreal Forum. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 6-1 at the Boston Garden.\n\nDecember 25, 1948: Arsenal host East Midlands team Derby County, and the teams play to a 3-3 draw.\n\nFive games were played in the BAA. The Chicago Stags beat the New York Knicks, 70-64 at the old Madison Square Garden. The Philadelphia Warriors beat the Boston Celtics, 80-77 at the Philadelphia Arena. The Baltimore Bullets beat the Providence Steamrollers, 88-83 at the Rhode Island Arena in Providence. The Washington Capitols beat the Fort Wayne Pistons, 88-74 at the Uline Arena in Washington (now the Washington Coliseum). And the Rochester Royals beat the St. Louis Bombers, 90-82 at the Edgerton Park Arena in Rochester.\n\nThe entire NHL was in action. The New York Rangers beat the Montreal Canadiens, 2-0 at the Montreal Forum. The Boston Bruins beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 2-1 at the Boston Garden. And the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1 at Maple Leaf Gardens.\n\nAlso on this day, Joel Natalino Santana is born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, his middle name coming from his birth on Christmas (Natal in Portuguese). A centreback, he starred for hometown team Vasco da Gama, winning the national league (Campeonato Brasileiro) in 1974.\n\nHe moved around a lot as a manager, leading Al Wasl to the league title in the United Arab Emirates in 1982, 1983 and 1985. He returned home and won Brazilian State Championships for Vasco in 1992 and 1993, Bahia in 1994, for Rio team Fluminense (or \"Flu\") in 1995, for Flu's arch-rivals Flamengo (or \"Fla\") in 1996, for Rio team Botafogo in 1997, for Bahia again in 1999, Vitória in 2003, Fla again in 2008, and Botafogo again in 2010.\n\nBut his biggest achievement was leading Vasco to the league title in 2000, making him one of the few managers in any country to win a league title for the same team as a player and a manager. He now manages an amateur team in the Los Angeles suburbs.\n\nDecember 25, 1949: There are 7 games played in the NBA. The Philadelphia Warriors beat the Baltimore Bullets, 64-63 at the Baltimore Coliseum. The Syracuse Nationals beat the Indiana-based Anderson Packers, 94-88 at the State Fair Coliseum in Syracuse. The Rochester Royals beat the Boston Celtics, 88-79 at the Edgerton Park Arena.\n\nIn the West, the Minneapolis Lakers beat the Fort Wayne Pistons, 72-58 at the Minneapolis Auditorium. The Washington Capitols beat the St. Louis Bombers, 81-68 at the St. Louis Arena. The Waterloo Hawks beat the Indianapolis Olympians, 97-93 at the Hippodrome in Waterloo, Iowa. And the Sheboygan Red Skins beat the Denver Nuggets, 76-72 at the Auditorium Arena in Denver. (These Nuggets went out of business at the end of the 1949-50 season. The ABA's Denver Rockets would rename themselves the Nuggets in 1974.)\n\nIn the NHL, the New York Rangers beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-1 at Madison Square Garden. The Boston Bruins and the Chicago Black Hawks play to a tie, 4-4 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Montreal Canadiens, 4-2 at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAfter this, the NHL's 2 Canadian-based teams, Montreal and Toronto, would resist playing on Christmas Day. The 4 American-based teams, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago, would not.\n\n*\n\nDecember 25, 1950: Arsenal host Stoke City and their legendary midfielder, Stanley Matthews, the man known as the Wizard of Dribble. Stoke win 3-0.\n\nFive NBA games were played. The New York Knicks beat the Philadelphia Warriors, 86-84 in overtime at the Philadelphia Arena. The Syracuse Nationals beat the Fort Wayne Pistons, 81-69 at the State Fair Coliseum in Syracuse. The Rochester Royals beat the Boston Celtics, 90-77 at the Edgerton Park Arena. The Tri-Cities Blackhawks beat the Baltimore Bullets, 87-72 at the Wharton Field House in Moline, Illinois. And the Minneapolis Lakers beat the Washington Capitols, 93-79 at the Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nThere were 2 games in the NHL. The New York Rangers lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 4-1 at the Olympia Stadium. And the Boston Bruins beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 7-4 at the Boston Garden.\n\nAlso on this day, Jesus Manuel Marcano Trillo is born in Caripito, Venezuela. A child born on December 25, and named Jesus? Not just Jesus, but Jesus Manuel -- as in short for \"Emmanuel,\" meaning \"God with us\"? He's better known as Manny Trillo, the 2nd baseman of the 1980 World Champion Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nAlso on this day, Kyle Rote Jr. is born in Dallas. The son of Southern Methodist University (SMU) running back Kyle Rote, soon to become a pro star with the Giants, Kyle Jr. played the original football. He starred for the Dallas Tornadoes, becoming one of the earliest American-born soccer players to be widely known. Indeed, he was the 1st American-born, and the 1st American-trained, player to lead the North American Soccer League in scoring for a season, in 1973.\n\nHowever, he only played 5 games for the national team. He also won ABC's Superstars competition 3 times in 4 years in the late 1970s. He now runs an athletes' agent service.\n\nDecember 25, 1951, 70 years ago:Arsenal host Portsmouth, and win 4-1 on goals by Lewis, Logie, Freddie Cox and Peter Goring.\n\nFour games were played in the NBA, including a doubleheader at Madison Square Garden. In the opener, the Syracuse Nationals beat the Milwaukee Hawks, 70-65.

The New York Rangers lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 2-1 at the Olympia Stadium. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 6-2 at the Boston Garden.\n\nAlso on this day, David Roy Kryskow is born in Edmonton. A left wing, he had a rollercoaster career. In his 1st season in the NHL, 1973, he helped the Blackhawks reach the Stanley Cup Finals. But they chose not to protect him in the expansion draft, and so he played for the team with the worst single-season record in NHL history, the expansion 1974-75 Washington Capitals.\n\nJust 3 years later, he won the World Hockey Association Championship with the Winnipeg Jets. That was his last major league season. He is still alive.\n\nDecember 25, 1952:Arsenal beat Bolton Wanderers 6-4 at Burnden Park. The goals are scored by Logie, Roper, Ray Daniel, Arthur Milton, and 2 by Cliff Holton. Milton, who lived until 2007, was the last survivor of the 12 men to have played for England at the senior level in both soccer and cricket. The Compton Brothers had also done so. Arsenal would win the 1953 League title, in the closest race in the League's history.\n\nFive games were played in the NBA. The New York Knicks beat the Boston Celtics, 97-84 at Madison Square Garden. The Rochester Royals beat the Philadelphia Warriors, 93-78 at the Philadelphia Civic Center.

And the Minneapolis Lakers beat the Indianapolis Olympians, 90-73 at the Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nIn the NHL, the New York Rangers beat the Boston Bruins, 2-1 at the Boston Garden. And the Chicago Black Hawks and the Detroit Red Wings played to a 3-3 tie at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nDecember 25, 1953: Patrick \"Patsy\" Donovan dies at age 88. The native of Queenstown, County Cork, Ireland was one of the top baseball players of his time, the 1890s and 1910s. A right fielder, he batted .307 for his career, collecting 2,253 hits, playing mainly for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals. He led the National League in stolen bases in 1900.\n\nHe also managed both teams, as well as the Brooklyn Dodgers and Boston Red Sox. But the only Pennant he was involved in was in his rookie year, with the Dodgers (or, as they were then known -- I swear, I am not making this up, it came from several of their players having gotten married in a single off-season -- the Bridegrooms) in 1890.\n\nThere were 4 games played in the NBA. The New York Knicks beat the Syracuse Nationals, 89-80 at Madison Square Garden. The Rochester Royals beat the Philadelphia Warriors, 73-65 at the Philadelphia Civic Center. The Fort Wayne Pistons beat the Boston Celtics, 108-79 at the Allen County Coliseum in Fort Wayne.\n\nAnd the Baltimore Bullets beat the Minneapolis Lakers, 88-78 at the St. Paul Auditorium. The Minneapolis Auditorium wasn't available on the day, not even to a team that had already won the city 5 league titles (1 NBL, 4 NBA).\n\nOnly 1 game was played in the NHL: The Boston Bruins beat the Chicago Black Hawks, 4-1 at the Boston Garden.\n\nDecember 25, 1954: Arsenal host Chelsea at Highbury, and win 1-0 on a goal by 1940 Merseyside hero Tommy Lawton, now playing out the string at age 36.\n\nBut Chelsea will go on to win the League title for the 1st time in their 50-year history -- the only time they will do so until 2005, when corrupt Russian energy boss Roman Abramovich has taken them over. They win this 1955 title with the 1st man ever to win the League as both a non-managing player and a non-playing manager. And he's an Arsenal man: Ted Drake.\n\nFour games were played in the NBA. The New York Knicks beat the Syracuse Nationals, 109-101 at the old Madison Square Garden. The Rochester Royals beat the Fort Wayne Pistons, 80-73 at the Edgerton Park Arena in Rochester. The Boston Celtics beat the Milwaukee Hawks, 108-99 at the Milwaukee Exposition and Convention Center Arena, a.k.a. The MECCA. And the Minneapolis Lakers beat the Philadelphia Warriors, 99-91 at the Minneapolis Auditorium.\n\nIf it seems like those scores are higher than they had been, that's because 1954-55 was the 1st season with the 24-second shot clock, the best Christmas present the NBA could have received.\n\nFor the 1st time in 5 years, the entire NHL played on Christmas. The New York Rangers lost to the Montreal Canadiens, 4-1 at the Montreal Forum. The Boston Bruins and the Chicago Black Hawks played to a 3-3 tie at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings beat the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-2 at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto.\n\nDecember 25, 1955: There were 3 games played in the NBA.

The Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 4-2 at the Boston Garden. And the Detroit Red Wings and the Toronto Maple Leafs played to a 1-1 tie at the Olympia Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day, William Andrews (no middle name) is born in Thomasville, Georgia. A running back, he made 4 straight Pro Bowls for the Atlanta Falcons, his home-State team, starting in 1980. But in training camp in 1984, he wrecked his knee, and missed the next 2 seasons, and possibly ended his chances of making the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nHe came back in 1986, but he wasn't the same, and retired. The Falcons retired his Number 31, and he has been elected to the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDecember 25, 1956: Arsenal play Chelsea to a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Whittaker had died earlier in the year, and the club had gone into a long decline that wouldn't be reversed for 10 years.\n\nThis remains the last game that Arsenal have played on a Christmas Day. By the 1970s, England's Football Association would stop allowing Football League games to be played on Christmas Day. To this day, however, they are still played on the day after, a.k.a. Boxing Day, often by neighboring rivals to save on travel costs.\n\nThere were 4 games played in the NBA, including a doubleheader at Madison Square Garden. The Philadelphia Warriors beat the Boston Celtics, 89-82, followed by the Knicks losing to the St. Louis Hawks, 107-105 in overtime. So, instead of the usual 48 minutes of pro basketball, Garden patrons got 101 minutes, and they got to see the defending NBA Champions (the Warriors) and the teams that would end up playing in that season's Finals, and in 4 of the next 5 Finals (the Celtics would beat the Hawks in 1957, '60 and '61, while the Hawks would beat the Celtics in '58).\n\nThe Rochester Royals beat the Syracuse Nationals, 98-93 at the Rochester Community War Memorial Arena.

This would be the last season for the Royals in Rochester, as they moved to Cincinnati in 1957; and the last for the Pistons in Fort Wayne, as they moved to Detroit.\n\nOnce again, the NHL's Canadian teams backed out of playing on Christmas Day, and the American teams played. The New York Rangers lost to the Detroit Red Wings, 8-1 at the Olympia Stadium. And the Chicago Black Hawks beat the Boston Bruins, 4-2 at the Boston Garden.\n\nAlso on this day, Charles William Lea is born in Orléans, France. That's right, not New Orleans, but its namesake in the old country. However, he did grow up in a classic Southern city, Memphis. A pitcher, he threw a no-hitter for the Montreal Expos on May 10, 1981, and helped them reach the ostseason for the 1st time. He was an All-Star in 1984.\n\nBut, like William Andrews, injuries caused him to miss 2 full seasons, in his case 1985 and 1986. He pitched for the Expos in 1987 and the Minnesota Twins in 1988, and then retired with a 62-48 record. He was elected to the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame, and died of a heart attack in 2011, only 54 years old.\n\nDecember 25, 1957: Three games are played in the NBA.

However, they sold him to Bedfordshire team Luton Town in 1991-92, and when Leeds won the League that year, Kamara didn't get a winner's medal.\n\nHe managed Yorkshire team Bradford City, and got them promoted from the 3rd to the 2nd division in 1996. He has since gone into the broadcasting side of soccer.\n\nDecember 25, 1958: Three games are played in the NBA.

A Baseball Hall-of-Famer and by far the all-time leader in stolen bases, Rickey is a legend. Just ask him.\n\nAlso on this day, Hanford Dixon (no middle name) is born in Mobile, Alabama. The All-Pro cornerback for the Cleveland Browns would bark like a dog at his teammates to get them psyched up, and fans in the bleachers at Cleveland Municipal Stadium would start barking along with him. Soon, he started calling that section the Dawg Pound, and they would respond by wearing dog masks and throwing dog biscuits. He is a member of the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDecember 25, 1959: Four games are played in the NBA. The New York Knicks lose to the Boston Celtics, 123-119 at Madison Square Garden.

And the St. Louis Hawks beat the Minneapolis Lakers, 112-96 at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis. The 1959-60 season will be the last season in \"The Land of 10,000 Lakes\" for the Lakers, as they move to Los Angeles, where lakes are few and far between.\n\nTwo games were played in the NHL. Again, it was the Canadian teams that backed out. The New York Rangers beat the Detroit Red Wings, 5-2 at the Olympia Stadium.

And the Chicago Black Hawks and the Toronto Maple Leafs played to a 3-3 tie at the Chicago Stadium.\n\nIn the opener of a doubleheader at Madison Square Garden, the Chicago Packers beat the Detroit Pistons, 118-97. You read that right: \"The Chicago Packers.\" This was their 1st season, and this was probably its highlight. After the season, probably to avoid the confusion of seeing the name of the NFL team that Chicagoans hated the most, they changed their name to the Chicago Zephyrs. It didn't attract many more fans, and for the 1963-64 season, they moved, becoming the Baltimore Bullets. They became the Washington Bullets in 1973, and the Washington Wizards in 1997.\n\nIn the nightcap of the Garden doubleheader, the New York Knicks beat the Philadelphia Warriors, 136-135 in double overtime. Wilt Chamberlain scored 59 points for the visitors, Richie Guerin 40 for the hosts. After the season, the Warriors were sold, and moved to San Francisco.

A center fielder, he reached the postseason with the 2004 and '05 Houston Astros, and the 2007 Colorado Rockies, playing in the 2005 and '07 World Series. In 2008, with the Rockies, he led the National League in stolen bases.\n\nBut he was one of these players who simply didn't get on base often enough to make his speed a useful weapon. He last appeared in Major League Baseball since 2010, with the Washington Nationals, but kept his career going through 2019, by playing in the Mexican and Dominican leagues.\n\nDecember 25, 1982: The 1st Aloha Bowl is played at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu, Hawaii. The University of Washington, then ranked Number 9 in the nation, defeats the University of Maryland, then Number 16, 21-20.\n\nHonolulu had previously hosted the Poi Bowl from 1936 to 1939, and the Pineapple Bowl from 1940 to 1952, but those games were held on New Year's Day. The Aloha Bowl would be held on Christmas Day, and would feature a man in a Santa Claus suit parachuting onto the field to present the referee with the game ball. In 1991, the ABC sitcom Coach would feature a 2-part episode about the show's fictional Minnesota State University playing in the Pineapple Bowl on Christmas Day.\n\nIn 1998, 1999 and 2000, Aloha Stadium hosted a doubleheader, with the Aloha Bowl preceded by the Oahu Bowl. But that game quickly folded. The last Aloha Bowl was played in 2000. It was a commercial failure: Of the 19 games played, only the 1989 edition was a sellout of the 50,000-seat Aloha Stadium.\n\nHaving quickly gone from hosting 2 bowl games in 2000 to none in 2001, Hawaii tried again. The Hawai'i Bowl was established in 2002, and was played on Christmas Day that year and the next, but has usually been played on Christmas Eve since. This year, it will be played on Christmas Eve, between teams yet to be determined from the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Mountain West Conference, at the Clarence T. C. Ching Athletics Complex, on the University of Hawaii campus. A combination of poor construction and 46 years of tropical weather have led to the closing of Aloha Stadium.\n\nIn the NBA, 3 of the usual 4 teams were at home. Bernard King scored 32 to lead the Nets over the Knicks, 112-110 in overtime. The Bullets got 37 from Greg Ballard, but lost to the Atlanta Hawks, 97-91. The Suns were on the road this time, but beat the Utah Jazz, 111-101 at the Salt Palace in Salt Lake City. And the Blazers beat the Sonics, 95-88.\n\nAlso on this day, Shawn Cornelius Andrews is born in Camden, Arkansas. A guard, he starred at the University of Arkansas, made 2 Pro Bowls with the Philadelphia Eagles, and played in Super Bowl XXXIX. He is a member of the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame and the Eagles' 75th Anniversary Team. He played with the Giants in 2010, but a back injury soon ended his career.\n\nHis brother Stacy Andrews was an Eagle teammate in 2009, and closed his career helping the Giants win Super Bowl XLVI.\n\nDecember 25, 1983: The Knicks beat the Nets at The Garden, 112-110 at The Garden. And the Blazers beat the Lakers, 141-121 at the Portland Memorial Coliseum.\n\nDecember 25, 1984: For about a year now, the best basketball player in the world has not been Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, or Magic Johnson, or Larry Bird, or Julius Erving, and certainly not newly-minted NBA rookie Michael Jordan. It's been Bernard King. On this Christmas Day, he came down the chimney at Madison Square Garden and scored 60 points, a record for the 1968 Garden. In spite of this performance for the Knicks, the Nets beat them, 120-114. Micheal Ray Richardson scored 36 for New Jersey.\n\nSadly, 'Nard will see his reign come to an end on March 23, 1985, with a terrible knee injury in Kansas City. It ends up being the 1st of 12 straight games the Knicks, already plagued with injuries, lost the end the season. Then they got the 1st pick in the 1985 NBA Draft, and selected Patrick Ewing.\n\nElsewhere, the Cleveland Cavaliers beat the Atlanta Hawks, 109-106 in Richfield; the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Detroit Pistons, 109-108 at the Silverdome; and the Portland Trail Blazers beat the Golden State Warriors, 106-97 at the Portland Memorial Coliseum.\n\nAlso on this day, Jack Balmer dies in Liverpool at age 68. A forward, he helped Liverpool F.C. win the Football League title in 1947.\n\nAlso on this day, Limas Lee Sweed Jr. is born outside Houston in Brenham, Texas. A receiver, he was with the University of Texas when it won the 2005 National Championship, and the Pittsburgh Steelers when they won Super Bowl XLIII. He last played in 2012, with the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders.\n\nAlso on this day, Alastair Nathan Cook is born in Gloucester, England. I don't know what makes a cricket player great, but Cook holds the records for most caps (appearances) and most caps as Captain for the England national team. He was named International Cricket Council Player of the Year in 2011. He is 5th on the all-time list for most runs in Test cricket, with 12,472. (Sachin Tendulkar of India holds the record, with 15,921.)\n\nHe currently plays for Essex County Cricket. That's Essex County in England, not in New Jersey. England does have a city named Newark, but, unlike in New Jersey, it isn't in the County of Essex, but in the County of Nottinghamshire. However, he retired from international cricket before the 2019 Cricket World Cup, and was not a member of the England team that won it.\n\nDecember 25, 1985: Dave Zinkoff dies following heart surgery in Philadelphia. He was 75. He was the public address announcer for the Philadelphia Warriors from the founding of the NBA in 19476 until they moved in 1962, and for their replacements, the Philadelphia 76ers, from their arrival in 1963 until his death. In 1986, in place of a uniform number to retire, the 76ers raised "
