        "text": "Home 1994/96\n\nNike made quite a few changes to the Arsenal home shirt after taking over from adidas at the start of the 1994 season.\n\nOpting for a white shirt collar and a zigzag pattern on the shirt, the American company elected against using the blue trim on the previous home design, as well as reducing the amount of white on the sleeves.\n\nWorn by: Tony Adams, Ian Wright, John Jensen.\n\nAway 1994/95\n\nArsenal's first Nike away shirt was rather different with the club tending to go for a yellow change strip.\n\nThe navy and turquoise kit was based on the club's home design and had the same zigzag pattern and hooped socks.\n\nWorn by: Lee Dixon, Ray Parlour, Glenn Helder.\n\nThird 1994/96\n\nNike also introduced a third shirt for the 1994/95 season but it was only ever worn twice.\n\nWorn for the very first time against Liverpool in the Coca-Cola Cup that campaign, the shirt actually wasn't made available to buy.\n\nThe yellow jersey once again followed exactly the same design as the club's home and away shirts, although it was worn with the away shorts and socks.\n\nWorn by: Paul Merson, Kevin Campbell, Alan Smith.\n\nAway 1995/96\n\nThe Gunners had a rather striking away shirt for the 1995/96 season as they once again went with the navy and turquoise colours used in the previous campaign.\n\nHowever, this time the shirt featured a rather bold version of the zig zag pattern that was used on the previous designs.\n\nThere was also a change on the shorts and socks as a large Gothic 'A' replaced the club crest.\n\nWorn by: David Platt, Nigel Winterburn, Martin Keown.\n\nHome 1996/98\n\nOne thing Nike changed for their second Arsenal home strip was the sleeves.\n\nWith only a little bit of white on their previous design, the American company went with all white sleeves ahead of the 1996 season.\n\nThe shirt also saw a change in the Nike logo with only the famous swoosh used.\n\nWorn by: Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Christopher Wreh.\n\nAway 1996/97\n\nArsenal's home shirt for the 1996/97 campaign replicated the home shirt but in yellow and navy blue.\n\nAgain using the Gothic 'A' on the shorts and socks instead of the club crest, the club went with rather plain socks instead of the previous hooped design.\n\nWorn by: Stephan Hughes, Remi Garde, Andy Linighan.\n\nAway 1997/99\n\nArsenal fans will remember the club's next away shirt from the famous 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford towards the end of the 1997/98 season.\n\nMarc Overmars' goal proved crucial as the club went on to lift the Premier League title for the very first time.\n\nThe club's latest yellow away shirt was rather different as Nike went for varying sizes of navy bands on the chest and arms.\n\nInstead of using the Gothic 'A' as Nike had done previously, they went for a cannon logo on the shorts.\n\nWorn by: Nicolas Anelka, Matthew Upson, Gilles Grimandi.\n\nHome 1998/00\n\nNike decided to shake things up for the club's next home design with navy blue making a comeback on the shirt.\n\nNavy trim featured on the shirt and collar, with the same on the shorts and socks.\n\nThe Gunners had the home shirt for two seasons but the club's long partnership with JVC came to an end after the 1998/99 campaign with Dreamcast taking over.\n\nWorn by: Emmanuel Petit, Freddie Ljungberg, Luis Boa Morte.\n\nThird 1998/99\n\nArsenal needed a third shirt for the 1998/99 season with the club having a kit clash against RC Lens due to their red and yellow stripes.\n\nNike produced a navy top and it was only used the once as the team lost 1-0 in the Champions League at Wembley.\n\nJust like the third shirt that was used between 1994 and 1996, it was never produced so fans could buy one.\n\nWorn by: Steve Bould, Ray Parlour, Christopher Wreh.\n\nAway 1999/01\n\nThe Gunners were once again decked out in a yellow change strip for the 1999/00 and 2000/01 seasons.\n\nThe shirt, which featured a unique V-neck, had navy blue on the bottom of the sleeves and down the side of the jersey.\n\nIt was the first Arsenal shirt to feature SEGA as the sponsor with Dreamcast featuring on the home kits.\n\nWorn by: Thierry Henry, Sylvinho, Stefan Malz.\n\nHome 2000/02\n\nNike ensured that navy remained on their next Arsenal home kit with piping running from the shoulders down the sleeves.\n\nThe design, which many will remember from their title triumph in 2002, also featured a red collar as opposed to the usual white one.\n\nWorn by: Lauren, Edu, Robert Pires.\n\nThird 2000/02\n\nThe Gunners were once again given a navy third kit that was almost identical to the 1998/99 shirt worn against RC Lens.\n\nHowever, this one was slightly different as it featured yellow on the shirt and it was also worn with yellow socks.\n\nWorn by: Lee Dixon, Oleg Luzhny, Nelson Vivas.\n\nAway 2001/02\n\n\"WILTOOOOOOORRRD!\"\n\nOne of the club's most iconic away shirts due to the famous 1-0 win over Manchester United in May 2002 that sealed the league title.\n\nWhile some were unhappy with Nike moving away from the traditional yellow change shirt, everyone has fond memories of it due to that balmy night at Old Trafford.\n\nWorn by: Sylvain Wiltord, Sol Campbell, Francis Jeffers.\n\nHome 2002/04\n\nA home shirt best remembered for the Invincibles after Arsene Wenger's side went through the 2003/04 season unbeaten in the league as they won the title.\n\nThere was no navy blue on this shirt as the Nike went with the club's traditional red body and white sleeves.\n\nWorn by: Pascal Cygan, Gilberto Silva, Jermaine Pennant.\n\nAway 2002/03\n\nNike once again went with another bold away kit for the 2002/03 season.\n\nUsing the same template as the home shirt, the top was predominantly navy but it had a rather striking light blue front.\n\nFamously worn at Upton Park in August 2002 when Thierry Henry scored a breathtaking goal against West Ham.\n\nWorn by: Ashley Cole, Kolo Toure, Giovanni van Bronckhorst.\n\nAway 2003/04\n\nArsenal were back in yellow in 2003 with Nike opting to go for a rather bright design with blue collar and cuffs.\n\nA shirt best known for Robert Pires' goal against Liverpool at Anfield and the club going the league season unbeaten.\n\nWorn by: Jeremie Aliadiere, Gael Clichy, Jose Antonio Reyes.\n\nHome 2004/05\n\nA kit not too dissimilar to the previous home one, the design featured yellow piping on the body of the shirt and the socks.\n\nWorn in the memorable win over Middlesbrough at the start of the 2004/05 season with the club's unbeaten record almost coming to a shock end.\n\nWorn by: Cesc Fabregas, Robin van Persie, Mathieu Flamini.\n\nAway 2004/05\n\nThe Gunners were back in navy after the eye-catching yellow shirt the previous season.\n\nBased on the same template as the home shirt, the navy design also featured yellow piping on the front.\n\nWorn by: Philippe Senderos, Patrick Vieira, Justin Hoyte.\n\nHome 2005/06\n\nArsenal bid farewell to Highbury in 2006 as they got set to move to their new home only a short distance away.\n\nNike received plaudits after a launching a special redcurrant shirt as worn during the very first season at their famous home back in 1913.\n\nWorn by: Emmanuel Adebayor, Alexander Hleb, Emmanuel Eboue.\n\nAway 2005/07\n\nYellow made a return in 2005, although it wasn't as bright as their shirt from the 2003/04 season.\n\nWith O2 as the sponsor in the 2005/06 season, Fly Emirates were on the front the next campaign due to the club's mega deal with the company following their move from Highbury.\n\nWorn by: Alex Song, Julio Baptista, Abou Diaby.\n\nHome 2006/08\n\nArsenal were back in their traditional colours in 2006 with Nike producing a rather sleek design.\n\nThe red and white shirt was completed by gold piping running down the sides.\n\nWorn by: Eduardo, Denilson, Johan Djourou.\n\nAway 2007/08\n\nThe famous white shirt as worn by Cesc Fabregas when he found the net from distance against AC Milan in the Champions League in 2008.\n\nThe top was worn with burgundy shorts and hooped socks.\n\nWorn by: Bacary Sagna, Lassana Diarra, William Gallas.\n\nThird 2007/08\n\nThe Gunners also had a third kit for the 2007/08 season that proved very popular.\n\nNike did something different for Arsenal and went with a navy and burgundy hooped kit that was finished with gold trim.\n\nWas worn in the Champions League defeat away against Sevilla and a Carling Cup quarter-final win away at Blackburn Rovers.\n\nWorn by: Armand Traore, Gilberto Silva, Mark Randall.\n\nHome 2008/10\n\nOne of the things that fans didn't like about the 2008/10 home shirt was the lack of white on the sleeves.\n\nIn a rather surprising move, Nike elected to go with predominantly red sleeves with only a bit of white on the top, while white also featured down the sides of the shirt.\n\nWorn by: Mikael Silvestre, Samir Nasri, Nicklas Bendtner.\n\nAway 2008/09\n\nWorn during the famous 4-4 draw away at Liverpool in 2009 as Andrey Arshavin scored all of his side's goals.\n\nIt was the perfect yellow away shirt for many as it also had navy blue sleeves and shorts with a hint of red.\n\nWorn by: Andrey Arshavin, Tomas Rosicky, Carlos Vela.\n\nAway 2009/10\n\nArsene Wenger's side were back in a blue away shirt for the first time since the 2004/05 season with a rather smart design.\n\nThe navy shirt, which featured a collar for the first time in a few years, also had light blue pinstripes.\n\nWorn by: Thomas Vermaelen, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs.\n\nThird 2009/10\n\nThe club's third kit for the 2009/10 was an exact replica of the away shirt but in white with dark grey shorts.\n\nFans will be remember it from the Champions League defeat against Barcelona at the Nou Camp.\n\nWorn by: Sol Campbell, Fran Merida, Robin van Persie.\n\nHome 2010/11\n\nNike made a couple of alterations to Arsenal's next home shirt with the club going back to their traditional white sleeves.\n\nThe shirt also featured a round collar in white, with the team also wearing plain white socks instead of having a hint of red on them.\n\nMany will remember the 2010/11 home shirt from the incredible 4-4 draw against Newcastle United when the team somehow surrendered a four-goal lead.\n\nWorn by: Marouane Chamakh, Sebastien Squillaci, Craig Eastmond.\n\nAway 2010/11\n\nThe pinstripes from the previous away and third shirts remained as the Gunners returned to a yellow shirt.\n\nWhereas previous yellow tops featured a more traditional blue, this had a burgundy collar and cuffs and the shorts were also the same colour.\n\nWorn by: Laurent Koscielny, Jack Wilshere, Jay Emmanuel-Thomas.\n\nHome 2011/12\n\nThe Gunners had a brand new home shirt the following season with the club celebrating their 125th anniversary.\n\nThe kit featured a bespoke crest but apart from that it was very similar to the previous design minus a couple of adjustments.\n\nThis was also the shirt worn by Thierry Henry as he marked his second debut for the club with a goal against Leeds United in the FA Cup.\n\nWorn by: Per Mertesacker, Park Chu-young, Andre Santos.\n\nAway 2011/12\n\nA shirt best known for all the wrong reasons.\n\nWhereas the gold shirt from the 2001/02 campaign will be remembered for securing the league title at Old Trafford, Arsenal's blue number ten years on will always bring back awful memories of the 8-2 drubbing against Manchester United.\n\nNot the club's best away shirt, although certainly an improvement for many on the previous season's kit.\n\nWorn by: Carl Jenkinson, Mikel Arteta, Thierry Henry.\n\nHome 2012/14\n\nThe last Arsenal home shirt worn for more than one season.\n\nNavy blue made a return to the shirt on the collar and cuffs, with the sleeves also featuring a red band.\n\nIt proved to be Nike's final home kit with the club signing a deal with Puma.\n\nWorn by: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Olivier Giroud, Lukas Podolski.\n\nAway 2012/13\n\nA leading contender for the Gunners' worst ever away strip.\n\nWho knows what was going through the heads of the kit designers as purple and black just aren't Arsenal colours.\n\nWorn in the humiliating League Cup quarter-final defeat against League Two side Bradford City.\n\nWorn by: Nacho Monreal, Francis Coquelin, Gervinho.\n\nAway 2013/14\n\nNike certainly got Arsenal fans back on their side with their next away kit as yellow made a triumphant return.\n\nIt was almost an exact copy of the famous 2003/04 shirt with the only real difference the blue and yellow socks.\n\nIt proved to be a big winner.\n\nWorn by: Santi Cazorla, Mathieu Flamini, Yaya Sanogo.\n\nHome 2014/15\n\nThe 2014/15 season saw Arsenal in Puma kits with the club signing a big deal after two decades with Nike.\n\nThere was to be no blue on their new shirts with the German company electing to go with the club's traditional colours.\n\nHowever, instead of going with a plain red body, Puma added a bit of white just below the shoulders.\n\nWorn by: Mathieu Debuchy, Gabriel, Calum Chambers.\n\nAway 2014/15\n\nThe club's first Puma away kit proved to be a winner as they opted for the classic yellow and blue shirt.\n\nIt was a darker blue than the previous away shirt and it featured a bit of red piping down the sides.\n\nWorn by: Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Joe Campbell.\n\nThird 2014/15\n\nArsenal now had three kits for the season after signing up with Puma at the start of the campaign.\n\nTheir first third kit was in colours the club have had previously with a navy and light blue number.\n\nSupporters will remember it from the FA Cup win over Manchester United on the way to the club lifting the famous trophy for the second successive year.\n\nWorn by: Hector Bellerin, Kieran Gibbs, Danny Welbeck.\n\nHome 2015/16\n\nArsenal's next home shirt with Puma featured plenty of white as the sportswear giant made a few alterations.\n\nThe new top had a grandad collar with a button and it also featured a tinge of gold.\n\nWorn by: Mohamed Elneny, Alex Iwobi, Chuba Akpom.\n\nAway 2015/16\n\nGold made a return as Arsenal's secondary colour for the first time since the famous 2001/02 season.\n\nThe predominantly gold top with navy sleeves also featured a diamond pattern on the front and reverse.\n\nWorn by: Nacho Monreal, Olivier Giroud, Theo Walcott.\n\nThird 2015/16\n\nArsenal were once again given a third kit by Puma and it was rather bold.\n\nThe navy design came with a striking graphic print on the lower half with gold, white and light blue vertical stripes.\n\nPlenty of fans will remember it from another Champions League defeat in Munich.\n\nWorn by: Per Mertesacker, Santi Cazorla, Jeff Reine-Adelaide.\n\nHome 2016/17\n\nThere wasn't an awful lot different from the previous year's kit with Arsenal's new home shirt.\n\nThe grandad collar had gone and there was more white on the shoulders, with a dark red vertical stripe running down from the neck to the base of the top.\n\nWorn by: Rob Holding, Granit Xhaka, Lucas Perez.\n\nAway 2016/17\n\nYellow once again made a return after the previous gold shirt.\n\nHowever, instead of going with the usual navy blue as Nike had done in previous years, Puma elected to use grey on the sleeves and shorts.\n\nWorn by: Shkodran Mustafi, Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey.\n\nThird 2016/17\n\nArsenal once again had a navy third kit for the 2016/17 season but this time Puma decided to team it up with fluorescent green.\n\nIt was certainly bright given that the sportswear giant chose to go with fluorescent green shorts and socks.\n\nIt was the shirt Mesut Ozil wore when he scored his stunning goal against Ludogorets in the Champions League.\n\nWorn by: Theo Walcott, Alex Iwobi, Mesut Ozil.\n\nThird 2017/18\n\nA shirt fans will want to very much forget due to their wretched record when wearing it.\n\nInstead of the usual navy blue that Arsenal tend to go with for an away strip, Puma went with a bright blue third shirt.\n\nIt was worn in the 4-0 hammering at Liverpool in August 2017.\n\nWorn by: Konstantinos Mavropanos, Jack Wilshere, Danny Welbeck.\n\nHome 2018/19\n\nArsenal fans have certainly had plenty to say about the club's final Puma home shirt before the deal with adidas gets underway.\n\nThe sportswear giant have once again gone with white shoulders and the red pattern on the sleeves hasn't exactly gone down well.\n\nWorn by: Sokratis, Lucas Torreira, Matteo Guendouzi\n\nAway 2018/19\n\nThe tried and tested navy blue shirt made its return again for the club's away kit.\n\nThis top features a burgundy strip running horizontally across the middle of the shirt and around the sleeves.\n\nPuma also mixed it up with the shorts as they went with a combination of navy and burgundy.\n\nWorn by: Stephan Lichtsteiner, Carl Jenkinson, Mohamed Elneny.\n\nThird 2018/19\n\nThe Gunners were given a turquoise shirt for the first time in the Premier League era by Puma.\n\nNot a colour associated with Arsenal, the bright shirt, which features a shirt collar, also features two navy stripes around the sleeves.\n\nWorn by: Laurent Koscielny, Rob Holding, Emile Smith Rowe."
