        "text": "July 22 marks 10 years since Dennis Bergkamp's testimonial, so in this article, first published in and with stats correct as of February 2014, we're taking a look at the great man's Arsenal career in numbers.\n\nDennis Bergkamp has gone down in history of one the Club's greatest players of all time, having scored 120 goals from 423 appearances over 11 trophy-laden seasons with Arsenal.\n\nAfter joining from Inter Milan in June 1995, Bergkamp, then 26, made his Gunners debut on the opening day of the 1995/96 season - a 1-1 draw with Middlesbrough at Highbury on August 20, 1995. For the last 20 minutes of the game, after Ray Parlour was subbed, Bergkamp was the youngest player in the side.\n\nIncidentally, Bergkampâ€™s first ever game for Arsenal was a pre-season friendly, against Kristianstads in Sweden on July 26, and the Dutchman scored a six-minute hat-trick in an 8-1 win.\n\nHis first competitive goal for the Club came 17 minutes into his eighth game - a fine volley in front of the Clock End in a 4-2 Premier League win over Southampton on September 23, 1995. He added a stunning second on 68 minutes.\n\nIn all Bergkamp finished with 16 goals in his debut season, from 41 games - including 11 in 33 league games - second only to Ian Wright that term.\n\nHe only beat that goalscoring tally once during the following 10 years at Arsenal (1997/98) and never started more games in a season than he did in that debut campaign.\n\nOn average Bergkamp played 38.5 games a season for Arsenal (never fewer than 30) and scored 10.9 goals. He started 345 of his 423 games, and appeared in six different competitions.\n\nDuring his 11-year Arsenal career he won 10 major honours (three league titles, four FA Cups and three Charity Shields) and a host of individual awards. Chief among them were the Football Writers' Association and Professional Footballers Association Player of the Year awards in 1998, and two Premier League Goal of the Season awards.\n\nBergkamp's Premier League record was P315 W186 D79 L50, so he took more than two points a game on average with a win rate of 59 per cent.\n\nBergkamp scored 69 (58 per cent) of his 120 goals at home, 50 away and one on neutral ground - but his actual strike rates for home and away games were very similar, claiming one in every 3.46 games on the road, and one every 3.39 at home.\n\nOnly nine players in history scored more goals at Highbury than Bergkamp (68) though one of these counts as an 'away' goal as the FA Cup match against Farnborough in 2003 was classed as away fixture. He also scored twice at Wembley in what were officially home games in the Champions League.\n\nFamously Bergkamp has a fear of flying, so he only travelled to six European away games with the Gunners (not including Chelsea away in 2003/04) and although he didn't score in any of those games, Arsenal remained unbeaten in all six, including a draw at the Nou Camp.\n\nThe vast majority (73) of Bergkamp's 87 Premier League goals came via his right boot (84 per cent) and he scored three headers. He netted 15 times from outside the area in the league (17 per cent of the total).\n\nBergkamp scored his 120 goals against 49 different teams - his favourite opponent was Middlesbrough, against whom he scored eight times.\n\nHe joined Arsenal's '100 Club' on January 4, 2003 when he scored against Oxford United in the North Bank goal at Highbury.\n\nBergkamp scored 13 braces and one unforgettable hat-trick - away to Leicester City in 1997/98.\n\nThe Dutchman particularly liked the winter period - his most prolific months were January and February (18 goals each), followed by March (16).\n\nWhereas those months may be notable for the quantity of goals he scored, in terms of pure quality, August 1997 will always stand out. That month Bergkamp was voted first, second and third in Match of the Day's Goal of the Month competition - a unique feat.\n\nBergkamp retired as the Club's 10th all-time leading scorer (he's now 11th in the list) with 120 goals to his name, but he also contributed an impressive number of assists.\n\nIn fact the former Ajax forward assisted 94 Premier League goals for Arsenal, which is 20 more than the next most for the Club in the competition (Thierry Henry). It's also the third most in Premier League history, behind Ryan Giggs (162) and Frank Lampard (101), who both played at least 250 more games.\n\nAlthough it took him eight games to find the net for Arsenal, Bergkamp gave his first assist in just his second game - a 2-0 win over Everton at Goodison Park on August 23, 1995. He played a superb through-ball for Ian Wright to run onto and score late in the match.\n\nOverall Bergkamp scored or assisted once every 122 minutes during his Premier League career on average, and is second only to Henry in terms of combined Premier League assists and goals for Arsenal.\n\nIncidentally, in the history of the Premier League, Mesut Ozil has the best assists to games ratio of any player at any club, with one every 2.63 games (minimum 10 appearances)."
