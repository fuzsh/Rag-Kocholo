        "text": "By Steve Wolfe : 06/10/2010 : Comments (92) :\n\nUnless you're an alien, you can't but help being aware of Liverpool Football Club's position of late. It's been in all aspects of the media, be it radio Merseyside/national radio, a la TalkSport etc.. to red-top and so-called reputable papers, both of the weekly and weekend ilk. Stelling and his cohorts constantly debate the merits of the situation, and we are always being reminded via the Sky Sports update bar, of the latest from Anfield.\n\nSo in essence we cannot get away from it, so maybe that could be an excuse for \"us\" blues, as to why we have become OBSESSED with laughing/taking the piss out of our lovable neighbours.\n\nLet me firstly stress that I am an avid match going blue, who most certainly has a healthy dislike for our \"rivals\" so to speak... but this is bordering on embarrassment from what I am witnessing of late. Am I the only sane one amongst my fellow blues? Be it mates, acquaintances, forums posters,etc.. who can see, just how the fuck can we be taking the piss??\n\nWe are level on points with them, 3rd and 4th from bottom respectively, we both have had record-breaking bad starts, and yet Evertonians have the audacity to \"have a go\" at the loveable kopites!! If we had just won the league, or even a cup, or were riding high as early Premier League leaders, I could understand... but, let's face it, we are just as shite as them.\n\nWith regards to their current plight, they are indeed in the financial crapper; however, it's all relative, and if you compare it to our financial situation, ours is worse ? much worse; they may have more debt, but theirs is more sustainable ? they are, after all, a globally well supported team (unlike ourselves) with a multitude of revenue streams to call upon (unlike ourselves). But, more importantly than that, they have a large fan base that actually care about their club's well fare (unlike ours).\n\nLook at the following questions, Blues, and ask yourself what the answer would be:\n\n1) If the \"yanks\" would have offered to take them to Kirkby in exactly the same deal as ours, what would have been the reaction from their fans?\n\n2) If they had to sell their best prot�g� arguably in their history, to a rival team on the drip, what would have their reaction been?\n\n3) If they had been lied to by \"one of their own\", who happened to be the Chairman, on a multitude of occasions, about a variety of reasons (stadium would fail the 2010 safety certificate; Fortress Sports Fund cheque in the post; looking for investment; but at the public enquiry Elstone said no board members would sell their shares; watch this space; no-one wants to buy football clubs, wouldn't sell for less than �50 million, the �30 million is ring-fenced etc .....the list goes on)... what would their reaction be?\n\n4) If their chairman/board changed AGM/EGM rules so that no individual shareholders had a say or the right to question the major shareholders in any way, what would their reaction be?\n\n5) If they had had three failed ground moves in the last 15 years or so, and had wasted millions in doing so, What would their reaction be?\n\n6) If they had won one trophy in the last 20 years or so, what would their reaction be?\n\nLet's face it, our ? or might I say YOUR ambition has sunk that low, that you take the piss out of them! Let's get OUR own house in order first!\n\nSay what you like about them, they care enough to moan, whinge, whine, protest etc to get what's best for their club. But we are just so apathetic, we get walked all over by our own board and have done for decades, and yet we just take it.\n\nLaugh at kopites? ... Laugh at ourselves!!!\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission. Comments are the responsibility of the poster.
