        "text": "This article discusses the conceptualization of network in Manuel Castells’ theory of network society and its relation to network analysis. Networks assumed a significant role in Castells’ opus magnum, The Information Age trilogy, in the latter half of the 1990s. He became possibly the most prominent figure globally in adopting network terminology in social theory, but at the same time he made hardly any empirical or methodological contribution to network analysis. This article sheds light on this issue by analyzing how the network logic embraced by Castells defines the social, economic, and political relations in his theory of network society, and how such aspects of his theory relate to social network analysis. It is shown that Castells’ institutional network concept is derived from the increased relevance of networks as the emerging form of social organization, epitomized by the idea of global networks of instrumental exchanges. He did not shed light on the internal dynamics of networks, but was nevertheless able to use network as a powerful metaphor that aptly portrayed his idea of the new social morphology of informational capitalism.\n\nThis paper discusses the conceptualization of network in Manuel Castells’ theory of network society. Castells’ early academic works were built on the structural analysis of capitalism and social movements in response to the contradictions of capitalist society, without any explicit connection to network analysis. Networks gradually appeared in Castells’ works in the late 1980s, when he became interested in the configuration of the relationships between technology, economy, and society. The culmination of this phase was his opus magnum, The Information Age trilogy, which introduced network as a key concept of his macro theory, even though he remained laconic about the concept itself. This is paradoxical, for Castells became possibly the most prominent figure globally in adopting network terminology in macro sociological theory, but at the same time made hardly any empirical, theoretical or methodological contribution to social network analysis or network theory in general. This implies that ‘network’ in Castells’ social theory is not an analytical concept but rather a powerful metaphor that served to capture his idea of the new social morphology of late capitalism.\n\nIn one way or another, we are all in this room responsible for having given to the notion of network an immense, and some could say, a hegemonic extension. Either because some of you have created the hardware or software infrastructure that has added digital networks to the already existing water, sewage, road, rail, telegraph, telephone networks, or because others, through media studies, sociology, history, political sciences, and even philosophy and brain science, have tried to capture what is so original in the new networky world generated by those new socio-technical assemblages. The reason I have welcomed the kind invitation of Professor Manuel Castells is that, because of the very extension of network (as a thing of the world as well as a concept), the time has come to check what it really means and maybe to shift somewhat its ambition and modify its real import. When a notion has become enshrined into a work of art like James Cameron’s “Avatar” with the planet Pandora itself ...\n\nThis article discusses the conceptualization of network in Manuel Castells’ theory of network society. Networks appeared in Castells’ works in the late 1980s, when he became interested in the configuration of the relationships between technology, economy, and society. The culmination of this phase was his opus magnum, The Information Age trilogy, which introduced network as a key concept of his macro theory, even though he remained laconic about the concept itself. This is paradoxical, for Castells became possibly the most prominent figure globally in adopting network terminology in macro sociological theory, but at the same time made hardly any empirical, theoretical or methodological contribution to social network analysis or network theory in general. This implies that ‘network’ in Castells’ social theory is based on institutional network analysis. Moreover, it is not an analytical concept but rather a powerful metaphor that served to capture his idea of the new social morphology of informational capitalism.\n\nIn The Rise of the Network Society (1996; second edition 2010), Manuel Castells elaborated on what is well-known today, namely the notion of a society marked by networks of electronically mediated communication networks, as well as networks undergirding economic exchanges worldwide. In this article a dissonance issuing from a feature of the network society is explored, namely what Castells calls the 'transformation of space and time in the human experience'. In this context he distinguishes between 'the space of places' and 'the space of flows', where the former refers to the historically familiar sense of space as a material precondition of social interaction, and of architectural modulation into 'place', and the latter to a novel form of spatiality, related to social interaction that has been fundamentally modified by advanced communication technologies, and is characterized by simultaneity, regardless of physical distance. This, in turn is related to what Castells labels 'timeless time', which is noticeable where customary time sequences are blurred in certain contemporary practices, such as virtually instantaneous financial transactions, 'instant wars' and virtual communication. This contrasts with ordinary, 'human' time as well as evolutionary 'glacial time' – a notion operative in the ecological movement, and one which increasingly clashes with the demands of 'timeless time' in the network society. The article reconstructs Castells's comprehensive vision, and points to the relevance of the conflict between these respective notions of space and time for contemporary communication practices. It also engages critically with the social implications of the dominant modes of space and time."
