Rob Holding admits Arsenal have 'let their fans down a few times' this season as Mikel Arteta's side languish in eighth place with just two matches remaining.

Holding says he and his team-mates 'owe' their supporters 'a lot' and promises to 'wrap up some wins and give them something to look forward to going into next season'.

However, Arsenal - who are set to play Crystal Palace and Brighton in their final two games - are in danger of failing to qualify for Europe for the first time since 1995.

Speaking to the official Arsenal website, Holding said: 'We owe the fans a lot after this season.

'We've let them down a few times, so if we can wrap up some points, wrap up some wins and give them something to look forward to going into next season.'

Arsenal on the brink of missing out on European football for the first time since the 1995-96 season after a dismal campaign this year.

The Gunners suffered a defeat over two legs against Villarreal, seeing them crash out of the Europa League.

They are also sitting in eighth place in the Premier League, after struggling to perform this season.

As a result, it seems likely that they will repeat the unfortunate history of the 1995-96 season.

Arsenal did, however, overcome fourth place Chelsea on Wednesday - beating Thomas Tuchel's side 1-0 at Stamford Bridge.

Speaking of his and his team-mates' performance in the game, Holding said: Holding added: 'I managed to block everything, head everything that came my way. We just sort of defended first and then anything we could do with the ball, we did.

'It's nice to get a double over Chelsea for the season. We got a good one at home and then it's nice to grind out a result here.'

Arsenal will be eager to claim three points when they get back underway against Crystal Palace on Wednesday - having previously beaten them 3-1 on Boxing Day.
