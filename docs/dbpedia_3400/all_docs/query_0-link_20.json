        "meta_description": "Abstract. Anthropogenic emissions are dominant contributors to air pollution.\nConsequently, mitigation policies have been attempted since the 1990s in\nEurope to reduce pollution by anthropogenic emissions. To evaluate the\neffectiveness of these mitigation policies, the German Ultrafine Aerosol\nNetwork (GUAN) was established in 2008, focusing on black carbon (BC) and\nsub-micrometre aerosol particles. In this study, long-term trends of\natmospheric particle number concentrations (PNCs) and equivalent BC (eBC)\nmass concentration over a 10-year period (2009â2018) were determined for 16\nGUAN sites ranging from roadside to high Alpine environments. Overall,\nstatistically significant decreasing trends are found for most of these\nparameters and environments in Germany. The annual relative slope of eBC\nmass concentration varies between â13.1â% and â1.7â% per year. The\nslopes of the PNCs vary from â17.2â% to â1.7â%, â7.8â% to â1.1\n%, and â11.1â% to â1.2â% per year for 10â30, 30â200, and\n200â800ânm size ranges, respectively. The reductions in various\nanthropogenic emissions are found to be the dominant factors responsible for\nthe decreasing trends of eBC mass concentration and PNCs. The diurnal and\nseasonal variations in the trends clearly show the effects of the mitigation\npolicies for road transport and residential emissions. The influences of\nother factors such as air masses, precipitation, and temperature were also\nexamined and found to be less important or negligible. This study proves\nthat a combination of emission mitigation policies can effectively improve\nthe air quality on large spatial scales. It also suggests that a long-term\naerosol measurement network at multi-type sites is an efficient and\nnecessary tool for evaluating emission mitigation policies.",

We found that organic components of these particles play a more important role in aerosol-moisture interactions than previously expected. This discovery is important as such interactions impact radiation and climate. Current climate models might need better representations of the moisture-absorbing properties of organic aerosols.\n\nAerosol hygroscopicity over the South-East Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season: Part I – From the perspective of scattering enhancement\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Junying Sun, Ye Kuang, Paola Formenti, and Steven Howell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing airborne measurements over the South-East Atlantic, our study explored how aerosols—tiny atmospheric particles—interact with moisture over the ocean, especially during the biomass burning season. We noticed unique patterns in their behavior at different altitudes and introduced a predictive model for this moisture interaction.

Numerical models are vital tools to understanding atmospheric particle evolution, which, however, suffer from large biases in simulating particle numbers. Here we improve the model chemical processes governing particle sizes and compositions. The improved model reveals substantial contributions of newly formed particles to climate through effects on cloud condensation nuclei.\n\nCharacterization of dust-related new particle formation events based on long-term measurement in the North China Plain\n\nXiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Huizheng Che, Yangmei Zhang, Chunhong Zhou, Ke Gui, Wanyun Xu, Quan Liu, Junting Zhong, Can Xia, Xinyao Hu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Shuo Liu, Jiayuan Lu, Aoyuan Yu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

As a consequence of the uptake of precursor gases on mineral dust, the physical and chemical properties of submicron particles, as well as the ability to be cloud condensation nuclei, can be changed.\n\nMeasurement report: Rapid decline of aerosol absorption coefficient and aerosol optical property effects on radiative forcing in an urban area of Beijing from 2018 to 2021\n\nXinyao Hu, Junying Sun, Can Xia, Xiaojing Shen, Yangmei Zhang, Quan Liu, Zhaodong Liu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Aoyuan Yu, Jiayuan Lu, Shuo Liu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos.

An ABL-TopoIndex is defined from a topography analysis around the stations. This new index allows ranking stations as a function of the ABL influence due to topography or help to choose a new site to sample FT. The ABL-TopoIndex is validated by aerosol optical properties and number concentration measured at 29 high altitude stations of five continents.\n\nSpatial distribution and occurrence probability of regional new particle formation events in eastern China\n\nXiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Adam Kristensson, Xiaoye Zhang, Yangmei Zhang, Lu Zhang, Ruxia Fan, Xuefei Qi, Qianli Ma, and Huaigang Zhou\n\nAtmos.

Classification methods work best at sites with stable, homogenous aerosol at particularly polluted and dust-prone continental and marine sites. Classification methods are poor at remote marine and Arctic sites. Using these methods to extrapolate aerosol type from optical properties can help determine aerosol radiative forcing and improve aerosol satellite retrieval algorithms.\n\nPan-Eurasian Experiment (PEEX): towards a holistic understanding of the feedbacks and interactions in the landâatmosphereâoceanâsociety continuum in the northern Eurasian region\n\nHanna K.

Our result suggests that the hydrophilic MgCl2 coating in fresh SSA likely intrigued the heterogeneous reactions at the beginning of SSA and acidic gases in the Arctic. The content of organic matter increased in the aged SSA compared with the fresh SSA, which suggests organic acids (beside inorganic acids) participate in the ageing of SSA in the Arctic.\n\nObservations of relative humidity effects on aerosol light scattering in the Yangtze River Delta of China\n\nL.

The results show the scattering coefficient and backscattering coefficient increased by 58 and 25% as relative humidity (RH) increased from 40 to 85%, while the hemispheric backscatter fraction decreased by 21%. Aerosol hygroscopic growth caused a 47% increase in calculated aerosol direct radiative forcing at 85% RH compared to the forcing at 40% RH. Nitrate played a vital role.\n\nChemical composition and mass size distribution of PM1 at an elevated site in central east China\n\nY. M. Zhang, X. Y. Zhang, J. Y. Sun, G. Y. Hu, X. J. Shen, Y. Q.

Features of PM1 at four seasons, during different kinds of episodes including NPF, polluted, PBL, LFT and in-cloud, were discussed. The characterizations of PM1 at seven clusters of air masses were also analyzed. BBOA, CCOA and oxidized organic aerosols were resolved by AMS-PMF (positive matrix function). Almost half of OA were oxidized, and BBOA is 34% of OA in summer; CCOA is 22% of OA in winter as well.\n\nColumn aerosol optical properties and aerosol radiative forcing during a serious haze-fog month over North China Plain in 2013 based on ground-based sunphotometer measurements\n\nH.

Days are clustered into four categories based on NPF intensity. Differences in particle size, precursor gases, and pollution levels are found. High NPF intensities increased Aitken mode particle concentrations at both sites, while volcanic influence selectively diminished NPF intensity at CHC but not EAC. This study highlights NPF dynamics in the Andes.\n\nHigh-resolution physicochemical dataset of atmospheric aerosols over the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings\n\nJianzhong Xu, Xinghua Zhang, Wenhui Zhao, Lixiang Zhai, Miao Zhong, Jinsen Shi, Junying Sun, Yanmei Liu, Conghui Xie, Yulong Tan, Kemei Li, Xinlei Ge, Qi Zhang, and Shichang Kang\n\nEarth Syst.

Using A-LIFE data, we studied the change in mineral dust optical properties due to mixing with anthropogenic aerosols. We found that increasing pollution affects dust optical properties which has implications for identifying dust events and understanding their climate effects. We also show that optical properties of Saharan and Arabian dust are similar when comparing cases with equal pollution content.\n\nAtmospheric Black Carbon in the metropolitan area of La Paz and El Alto, Bolivia: concentration levels and emission sources\n\nValeria MardoÃ±ez-Balderrama, GriÅ¡a MoÄnik, Marco Pandolfi, Robin Modini, Fernando Velarde, Laura Renzi, Angela Marinoni, Jean-Luc Jaffrezo, Isabel Moreno R., Diego Aliaga, Federico Bianchi, Claudia Mohr, Martin Gysel-Beer, Patrick Ginot, Radovan Krejci, Alfred Widensohler, GaÃ«lle Uzu, Marcos Andrade, and Paolo Laj\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-770,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-770, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLevels of black carbon (BC) are scarcely reported in the southern hemisphere, especially in high-altitude conditions. This study provides insight on the concentration level, variability, and optical properties of BC in the cities of La Paz and El Alto, and at the station GAW Chacaltaya Mountain station. Two methods of source apportionment of absorption were tested and compared showing traffic as the main contributor to absorption in the urban area, additionally to biomass and open waste burning.\n\nThe behaviour of charged particles (ions) during new particle formation events in urban Leipzig (Germany)\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C. S. Beddows, Zongbo Shi, Avinash Kumar, Matti Rissanen, Miikka Dal Maso, Peter Mettke, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, and Roy M. Harrison\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-742,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-742, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIons enhance the formation and growth rates of new particles, affecting the earths radiation budget. Despite these effects, there is little published data exploring the sources of ions in the urban environment and their role in new particle formation (NPF). Here we show that natural ion sources dominate in urban environments, while traffic is a secondary source. Ions contribute up to 12.7 % of the formation rate of particles, indicating that they are important for forming urban PM.\n\nMeasurement report: Hygroscopicity of size-selected aerosol particles in the heavily polluted urban atmosphere of Delhi: impacts of chloride aerosol\n\nAnil Kumar Mandariya, Ajit Ahlawat, Mohammed Haneef, Nisar Ali Baig, Kanan Patel, Joshua Apte, Lea Hildebrandt Ruiz, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Gazala Habib\n\nAtmos.

Here, we report that the high volume fraction contribution of ammonium chloride to aerosol governs the high aerosol hygroscopicity and associated liquid water content based on the experimental data. The episodically high ammonium chloride present in Delhi's atmosphere could lead to haze and fog formation under high relative humidity in the region.\n\nTropical tropospheric aerosol sources and chemical composition observed at high altitude in the Bolivian Andes\n\nC.

Chacaltaya (5380 m a.s.l., Bolivian Andes). Minimum concentrations occur in the rainy season with maxima in the dry and transition seasons. The origins of the aerosol are located in a radius of hundreds of kilometers: nearby urban and rural areas, natural biogenic emissions, vegetation burning from Amazonia and Chaco, Pacific Ocean emissions, soil dust, and Peruvian volcanism.\n\nOptical properties and simple forcing efficiency of the organic aerosols and black carbon emitted by residential wood burning in rural central Europe\n\nAndrea Cuesta-Mosquera, Kristina Glojek, GriÅ¡a MoÄnik, Luka Drinovec, Asta GregoriÄ, Martin Rigler, Matej Ogrin, Baseerat Romshoo, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Dominik van Pinxteren, Hartmut Herrmann, Alfred Wiedensohler, Mira PÃ¶hlker, and Thomas MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos.

The authors investigate the optical and physical properties that connect the aerosol emissions with climate by evaluating atmospheric radiative impacts via simple-forcing calculations. The study contributes to reducing the lack of information on the understanding of the optical properties of air pollution from anthropogenic sources.\n\nAnalysis of atmospheric particle growth based on vapor concentrations measured at the high-altitude GAW station Chacaltaya in the Bolivian Andes\n\nArto Heitto, Cheng Wu, Diego Aliaga, Luis Blacutt, Xuemeng Chen, Yvette Gramlich, Liine Heikkinen, Wei Huang, Radovan Krejci, Paolo Laj, Isabel Moreno, Karine Sellegri, Fernando Velarde, Kay Weinhold, Alfred Wiedensohler, Qiaozhi Zha, Federico Bianchi, Marcos Andrade, Kari E.

Major contributors to the simulated growth were low-volatility organic compounds (LVOCs). Also, sulfuric acid had major role when volcanic activity was occurring in the area. This study provides insight on nanoparticle growth at this high-altitude Southern Hemispheric site and hence contributes to building knowledge of early growth of atmospheric particles.\n\nInsights into the sources of ultrafine particle numbers at six European urban sites obtained by investigating COVID–19 lockdowns\n\nAlex Rowell, James Brean, David C.

The various sources responded differently to the changes in emissions associated with Covid lockdowns, and the reasons are investigated. While traffic emissions generally decreased, particles formed from reactions of atmospheric gases decreased in some cities, but increased in others.\n\nMeasurement report: Contribution of atmospheric new particle formation to ultrafine particle concentration, cloud condensation nuclei and radiative forcing: Results from five-year observations in Central Europe\n\nJia Sun, Markus Hermann, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Wolfram Birmili, Yifan Yang, Thomas Tuch, Harald Flentje, BjÃ¶rn Briel, Ludwig Ries, Cedric Couret, Michael Elsasser, Ralf Sohmer, Klaus Wirtz, Frank Meinhardt, Maik SchÃ¼tze, Olaf Bath, Bryan Hellack, Veli-Matti Kerminen, Markku Kulmala, Nan Ma, and Alfred Wiedensohler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2359,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2359, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigated the characteristics of new particle formation (NPF) for various environments from urban background to high Alpine, and the impacts of NPF on cloud condensation nuclei and aerosol radiative forcing. The NPF features differ between site categories, implying the crucial role of local environments such as degree of emissions and meteorological conditions. The results also underscore the importance of the local environments when assessing the impact of NPF on climate in models.\n\nEvaluation of a Partector Pro for atmospheric particle number size distribution and number concentration measurements at an urban background site\n\nChristof Asbach, Ana Maria Todea, and Heinz Kaminski\n\nAerosol Research, 2, 1–12, https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-1-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/ar-2-1-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe performance of the handheld Partector Pro has been evaluated against a reference mobility particle size spectrometer (MPSS) for 70 days at an urban background site. The number concentrations measured with the Partector Pro were in excellent and the number size distributions in reasonable agreement with the MPSS. The Partector Pro is thus a promising candidate for the widespread measurement of ultrafine particle concentrations as, for example, requested by WHO, at reasonable costs.\n\nA 20-year (1998–2017) global sea surface dimethyl sulfide gridded dataset with daily resolution\n\nShengqian Zhou, Ying Chen, Shan Huang, Xianda Gong, Guipeng Yang, Honghai Zhang, Hartmut Herrmann, Alfred Wiedensohler, Laurent Poulain, Yan Zhang, Fanghui Wang, Zongjun Xu, and Ke Yan\n\nEarth Syst.

Leveraging machine learning techniques, we constructed a long-term global sea surface DMS gridded dataset with daily resolution. Compared to previous datasets, our new dataset holds promise for improving atmospheric chemistry modeling and advancing our comprehension of the climate effects associated with oceanic DMS.\n\nMeasurement report: Size-resolved mass concentration of equivalent black carbon-containing particles larger than 700 nm and their role in radiation\n\nWeilun Zhao, Ying Li, Gang Zhao, Song Guo, Nan Ma, Shuya Hu, and Chunsheng Zhao\n\nAtmos. Chem.

In this study, BC-containing particles larger than 700 nm (BC>700) were measured, highlighting their importance to total BC mass and absorption. The contribution of BC>700 to the BC direct radiative effect was estimated, highlighting the necessity to consider the whole size range of BC-containing particles in the model estimation of BC radiative effects.\n\nProminent role of organics in aerosol liquid water content over the south-eastern Atlantic during biomass burning season\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Junying Sun, Ye Kuang, and Paola Formenti\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2319,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2319, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur study examined the interaction between atmospheric particles and moisture over the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning seasons in Africa. We found that organic components of these particles play a more important role in aerosol-moisture interactions than previously expected. This discovery is important as such interactions impact radiation and climate. Current climate models might need better representations of the moisture-absorbing properties of organic aerosols.\n\nLocal comparisons of tropospheric ozone: vertical soundings at two neighbouring stations in southern Bavaria\n\nThomas Trickl, Martin Adelwart, Dina Khordakova, Ludwig Ries, Christian Rolf, Michael Sprenger, Wolfgang Steinbrecht, and Hannes Vogelmann\n\nAtmos.

Highly quantitative ozone measurements have been made at monitoring stations. However, deficits have been reported for vertical sounding systems. Here, we report a thorough intercomparison effort between a differential-absorption lidar system and two types of balloon-borne ozone sondes, also using ozone sensors at nearby mountain sites as references. The sondes agree very well with the lidar after offset corrections.\n\nAerosol hygroscopicity over the South-East Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season: Part I – From the perspective of scattering enhancement\n\nLu Zhang, Michal Segal-Rozenhaimer, Haochi Che, Caroline Dang, Junying Sun, Ye Kuang, Paola Formenti, and Steven Howell\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2199, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing airborne measurements over the South-East Atlantic, our study explored how aerosols—tiny atmospheric particles—interact with moisture over the ocean, especially during the biomass burning season. We noticed unique patterns in their behavior at different altitudes and introduced a predictive model for this moisture interaction. Our results aid our understanding of aerosol-moisture interactions and benefit the research of aerosol radiative effect in this climatically significant region.\n\nSubstantially positive contributions of new particle formation to cloud condensation nuclei under low supersaturation in China based on numerical model improvements\n\nChupeng Zhang, Shangfei Hai, Yang Gao, Yuhang Wang, Shaoqing Zhang, Lifang Sheng, Bin Zhao, Shuxiao Wang, Jingkun Jiang, Xin Huang, Xiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Aura Lupascu, Manish Shrivastava, Jerome D.

The sources of particulate matter (PM) in this conurbation were not previously investigated. This study identified 11 main sources of PM, of which dust and vehicular emissions stand out as the main ones. The influence of regional biomass combustion and local waste combustion was also observed, with the latter being a major source of hazardous compounds.\n\nImpact of 2020 COVID-19 lockdowns on particulate air pollution across Europe\n\nJean-Philippe Putaud, Enrico Pisoni, Alexander Mangold, Christoph Hueglin, Jean Sciare, Michael Pikridas, Chrysanthos Savvides, Jakub Ondracek, Saliou Mbengue, Alfred Wiedensohler, Kay Weinhold, Maik Merkel, Laurent Poulain, Dominik van Pinxteren, Hartmut Herrmann, Andreas Massling, Claus Nordstroem, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Cristina Reche, NoemÃ­ PÃ©rez, Sonia Castillo, Mar Sorribas, Jose Antonio Adame, Tuukka Petaja, Katrianne Lehtipalo, Jarkko Niemi, VÃ©ronique Riffault, Joel F. de Brito, Augustin Colette, Olivier Favez, Jean-Eudes Petit, ValÃ©rie Gros, Maria I.

COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 were used to assess the impact of the reduction in human mobility on air pollution across Europe by comparing measurement data with values that would be expected if no lockdown had occurred. We show that lockdown measures did not lead to consistent decreases in the concentrations of fine particulate matter suspended in the air, and we investigate why.\n\nThe export of African mineral dust across the Atlantic and its impact over the Amazon Basin\n\nXurong Wang, Qiaoqiao Wang, Maria Prass, Christopher PÃ¶hlker, Daniel Moran-Zuloaga, Paulo Artaxo, Jianwei Gu, Ning Yang, Xiajie Yang, Jiangchuan Tao, Juan Hong, Nan Ma, Yafang Cheng, Hang Su, and Meinrat O.

We analyse the stratospheric influence on the long-term series of ozone and carbon monoxide measured on the Zugspitze in the Bavarian Alps (2962 m a.s.l.). Since the 1970s, there has been a pronounced ozone rise that has been ascribed to an increase in STT. We determine the stratospheric influence from the observational data alone (humidity and 7Be).\n\nCharacterization of dust-related new particle formation events based on long-term measurement in the North China Plain\n\nXiaojing Shen, Junying Sun, Huizheng Che, Yangmei Zhang, Chunhong Zhou, Ke Gui, Wanyun Xu, Quan Liu, Junting Zhong, Can Xia, Xinyao Hu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Shuo Liu, Jiayuan Lu, Aoyuan Yu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 8241–8257, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8241-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-8241-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNew particle formation (NPF) events occur when the dust episodes' fade is analysed based on long-term measurement of particle number size distribution. Analysis shows that the observed formation and growth rates are approximately 50 % of and 30 % lower than those of other NPF events. As a consequence of the uptake of precursor gases on mineral dust, the physical and chemical properties of submicron particles, as well as the ability to be cloud condensation nuclei, can be changed.\n\nA 1-year aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) source analysis of organic aerosol particle contributions from anthropogenic sources after long-range transport at the TROPOS research station Melpitz\n\nSamira Atabakhsh, Laurent Poulain, Gang Chen, Francesco Canonaco, AndrÃ© S. H. PrÃ©vÃ´t, Mira PÃ¶hlker, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Hartmut Herrmann\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 6963–6988, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6963-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-6963-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe study focuses on the aerosol chemical variations found in the rural-background station of Melpitz based on ACSM and MAAP measurements. Source apportionment on both organic aerosol (OA) and black carbon (eBC) was performed, and source seasonality was also linked to air mass trajectories. Overall, three anthropogenic sources were identified in OA and eBC plus two additional aged OA. Our results demonstrate the influence of transported coal-combustion-related OA even during summer time.\n\nA multiple-charging correction algorithm for a broad-supersaturation scanning cloud condensation nuclei (BS2-CCN) system\n\nNajin Kim, Hang Su, Nan Ma, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, and Yafang Cheng\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 16, 2771–2780, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2771-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-16-2771-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe propose a multiple-charging correction algorithm for a broad-supersaturation scanning cloud condensation nuclei (BS2-CCN) system which can obtain high time-resolution aerosol hygroscopicity and CCN activity. The correction algorithm aims at deriving the activation fraction's true value for each particle size. The meaningful differences between corrected and original Îº values (single hygroscopicity parameter) emphasize the correction algorithm's importance for ambient aerosol measurement.\n\nModelling wintertime sea-spray aerosols under Arctic haze conditions\n\nEleftherios Ioannidis, Kathy S. Law, Jean-Christophe Raut, Louis Marelle, Tatsuo Onishi, Rachel M. Kirpes, Lucia M. Upchurch, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Andreas Massling, Henrik Skov, Patricia K. Quinn, and Kerri A. Pratt\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5641–5678, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5641-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRemote and local anthropogenic emissions contribute to wintertime Arctic haze, with enhanced aerosol concentrations, but natural sources, which also contribute, are less well studied. Here, modelled wintertime sea-spray aerosols are improved in WRF-Chem over the wider Arctic by including updated wind speed and temperature-dependent treatments. As a result, anthropogenic nitrate aerosols are also improved. Open leads are confirmed to be the main source of sea-spray aerosols over northern Alaska.\n\nMeasurement Report: Wintertime new particle formation in the rural area of the North China Plain â influencing factors and possible formation mechanism\n\nJuan Hong, Min Tang, Qiaoqiao Wang, Nan Ma, Shaowen Zhu, Shaobin Zhang, Xihao Pan, Linhong Xie, Guo Li, Uwe Kuhn, Chao Yan, Jiangchuan Tao, Ye Kuang, Yao He, Wanyun Xu, Runlong Cai, Yaqing Zhou, Zhibin Wang, Guangsheng Zhou, Bin Yuan, Yafang Cheng, and Hang Su\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5699–5713, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5699-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5699-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA comprehensive investigation of the characteristics of new particle formation (NPF) events was conducted at a rural site on the North China Plain (NCP), China, during the wintertime of 2018 by covering the particle number size distribution down to sub–3 nm. Potential mechanisms for NPF under the current environment were explored, followed by a further discussion on the factors governing the occurrence of NPF at this rural site compared with other regions (e.g., urban areas) in the NCP region.\n\nMeasurement report: Rapid decline of aerosol absorption coefficient and aerosol optical property effects on radiative forcing in an urban area of Beijing from 2018 to 2021\n\nXinyao Hu, Junying Sun, Can Xia, Xiaojing Shen, Yangmei Zhang, Quan Liu, Zhaodong Liu, Sinan Zhang, Jialing Wang, Aoyuan Yu, Jiayuan Lu, Shuo Liu, and Xiaoye Zhang\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 5517–5531, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5517-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-5517-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe simultaneous measurements under dry conditions of aerosol optical properties were conducted at three wavelengths for PM1 and PM10 in urban Beijing from 2018 to 2021. Considerable reductions in aerosol absorption coefficient and increased single scattering albedo demonstrated that absorbing aerosols were more effectively controlled than scattering aerosols due to pollution control measures. The aerosol radiative effect and the transport's impact on aerosol optical properties were analysed.\n\nSize-dependent hygroscopicity of levoglucosan and D-glucose aerosol nanoparticles\n\nTing Lei, Hang Su, Nan Ma, Ulrich PÃ¶schl, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Yafang Cheng\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 4763–4774, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4763-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-4763-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the hygroscopic behavior of levoglucosan and D-glucose nanoparticles using a nano-HTDMA. There is a weak size dependence of the hygroscopic growth factor of levoglucosan and D-glucose with diameters down to 20 nm, while a strong size dependence of the hygroscopic growth factor of D-glucose has been clearly observed in the size range 6 to 20 nm. The use of the DKA method leads to good agreement with the hygroscopic growth factor of glucose nanoparticles with diameters down to 6 nm.\n\nCharacterization of ultrafine particles and the occurrence of new particle formation events in an urban and coastal site of the Mediterranean area\n\nAdelaide Dinoi, Daniel Gulli, Kay Weinhold, Ivano Ammoscato, Claudia R. Calidonna, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Daniele Contini\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 2167–2181, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2167-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-2167-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, particle number size distribution analysis was performed with the purpose of characterizing new particle formation (NPF) events occurring in two areas of southern Italy over 5 years of measurements. The identification of NPF events produced different results in terms of frequency and seasonality. Some of the main variables involved in the process, the local atmospheric conditions in which the events occurred, and the role of the air masses were discussed and compared.\n\nMeasurement report: Long-range transport and the fate of dimethyl sulfide oxidation products in the free troposphere derived from observations at the high-altitude research station Chacaltaya (5240 m a.s.l.) in the Bolivian Andes\n\nWiebke Scholz, Jiali Shen, Diego Aliaga, Cheng Wu, Samara Carbone, Isabel Moreno, Qiaozhi Zha, Wei Huang, Liine Heikkinen, Jean Luc Jaffrezo, Gaelle Uzu, Eva Partoll, Markus Leiminger, Fernando Velarde, Paolo Laj, Patrick Ginot, Paolo Artaxo, Alfred Wiedensohler, Markku Kulmala, Claudia Mohr, Marcos Andrade, Victoria Sinclair, Federico Bianchi, and Armin Hansel\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 23, 895–920, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-895-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-23-895-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS), emitted from the ocean, is the most abundant biogenic sulfur emission into the atmosphere. OH radicals, among others, can oxidize DMS to sulfuric and methanesulfonic acid, which are relevant for aerosol formation. We quantified DMS and nearly all DMS oxidation products with novel mass spectrometric instruments for gas and particle phase at the high mountain station Chacaltaya (5240 m a.s.l.) in the Bolivian Andes in free tropospheric air after long-range transport.\n\nA full year of aerosol size distribution data from the central Arctic under an extreme positive Arctic Oscillation: insights from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition\n\nMatthew Boyer, Diego Aliaga, Jakob Boyd Pernov, HÃ©lÃ¨ne Angot, Lauriane L.

We evaluate measurements of aerosol particles, which can influence climate, over the central Arctic Ocean for a full year and compare the data to land-based measurement stations across the Arctic. Our measurements show that the central Arctic has similarities to but also distinct differences from the stations further south. We note that this may change as the Arctic warms and sea ice continues to decline.\n\nAerosol activation characteristics and prediction at the central European ACTRIS research station of Melpitz, Germany\n\nYuan Wang, Silvia Henning, Laurent Poulain, Chunsong Lu, Frank Stratmann, Yuying Wang, Shengjie Niu, Mira L. PÃ¶hlker, Hartmut Herrmann, and Alfred Wiedensohler\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 15943–15962, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15943-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-15943-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAerosol particle activation affects cloud, precipitation, radiation, and thus the global climate. Its long-term measurements are important but still scarce. In this study, more than 4 years of measurements at a central European station were analyzed. The overall characteristics and seasonal changes of aerosol particle activation are summarized. The power-law fit between particle hygroscopicity factor and diameter was recommended for predicting cloud condensation nuclei number concentration.\n\nImportance of size representation and morphology in modelling optical properties of black carbon: comparison between laboratory measurements and model simulations\n\nBaseerat Romshoo, Mira PÃ¶hlker, Alfred Wiedensohler, Sascha Pfeifer, Jorge Saturno, Andreas Nowak, Krzysztof Ciupek, Paul Quincey, Konstantina Vasilatou, Michaela N. Ess, Maria Gini, Konstantinos Eleftheriadis, Chris Robins, FranÃ§ois Gaie-Levrel, and Thomas MÃ¼ller\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This study investigates different modelling techniques for the optical properties of BC by comparing them to laboratory measurements. We provide experimental support for emphasizing the use of appropriate size representation (polydisperse size method) and morphological representation (aggregate morphology) for optical modelling and parameterization scheme development of BC.\n\nCAMP: an instrumented platform for balloon-borne aerosol particle studies in the lower atmosphere\n\nChristian Pilz, Sebastian DÃ¼sing, Birgit Wehner, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Holger Siebert, Jens VoigtlÃ¤nder, and Michael Lonardi\n\nAtmos. Meas.

This study presents a newly developed platform called CAMP with four aerosol instruments for balloon-borne measurements in the Arctic. Laboratory characterizations and evaluations of the instruments and results of a first field deployment are shown. A case study highlights CAMP's capabilities and the importance of airborne aerosol studies for interpretation of ground-based observations.\n\nNew method to determine black carbon mass size distribution\n\nWeilun Zhao, Gang Zhao, Ying Li, Song Guo, Nan Ma, Lizi Tang, Zirui Zhang, and Chunsheng Zhao\n\nAtmos. Meas. Tech., 15, 6807–6817, https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6807-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/amt-15-6807-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA new method to determine black carbon mass size distribution (BCMSD) was proposed using the size-resolved absorption coefficient measured by an aerodynamic aerosol classifier in tandem with an aethalometer. This new method fills the gap in the high-time-resolution measurement of BCMSD ranging from upper submicron particle sizes to larger than 1 Âµm. This method can be applied to field measurement of BCMSD extensively for better understanding BC aging and better estimating the BC climate effect.\n\nComparison of particle number size distribution trends in ground measurements and climate models\n\nVille Leinonen, Harri Kokkola, Taina Yli-Juuti, Tero Mielonen, Thomas KÃ¼hn, Tuomo Nieminen, Simo Heikkinen, Tuuli Miinalainen, Tommi Bergman, Ken Carslaw, Stefano Decesari, Markus Fiebig, Tareq Hussein, Niku KivekÃ¤s, Radovan Krejci, Markku Kulmala, Ari Leskinen, Andreas Massling, Nikos Mihalopoulos, Jane P.

Scott, Henrik Skov, Erik Swietlicki, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Annele Virtanen, and Santtu Mikkonen\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 22, 12873–12905, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12873-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-22-12873-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe provide the first extensive comparison of detailed aerosol size distribution trends between in situ observations from Europe and five different earth system models. We investigated aerosol modes (nucleation, Aitken, and accumulation) separately and were able to show the differences between measured and modeled trends and especially their seasonal patterns. The differences in model results are likely due to complex effects of several processes instead of certain specific model features.\n\nImpact of water uptake and mixing state on submicron particle deposition in the human respiratory tract (HRT) based on explicit hygroscopicity measurements at HRT-like conditions\n\nRuiqi Man, Zhijun Wu, Taomou Zong, Aristeidis Voliotis, Yanting Qiu, Johannes GrÃ¶Ã, Dominik van Pinxteren, Limin Zeng, Hartmut Herrmann, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Min Hu\n\nAtmos. Chem.

We found that particle hygroscopic growth led to a reduction (~24 %) in the total dose. The deposition rate of hygroscopic particles was higher in the daytime, while hydrophobic particles exhibited a higher rate at night and during rush hours. The results will deepen the understanding of the impact of hygroscopicity and the mixing state on deposition patterns in the lungs.\n\nSynergetic use of IASI profile and TROPOMI total-column level 2 methane retrieval products\n\nMatthias Schneider, Benjamin Ertl, Qiansi Tu, Christopher J.

We apply the method to IASI vertical profile and TROPOMI total column space-borne methane observations and thus gain sensitivity for the tropospheric methane partial columns, which is not achievable by the individual use of TROPOMI and IASI. These synergetic effects are evaluated theoretically and empirically by inter-comparisons to independent references of TCCON, AirCore, and GAW.\n\nInfluence of emission size distribution and nucleation on number concentrations over Greater Paris\n\nKarine Sartelet, Youngseob Kim, Florian Couvidat, Maik Merkel, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Jean Sciare, and Alfred Wiedensohler\n\nAtmos.

Number concentrations are simulated over Greater Paris using different nucleation parameterisations (binary, ternary involving sulfuric acid and ammonia, and heteromolecular involving sulfuric acid and extremely low-volatility organics, ELVOCs). The comparisons show that ternary nucleation may not be a dominant process for new particle formation in cities, but they stress the role of ELVOCs.\n\nHigh-resolution physicochemical dataset of atmospheric aerosols over the Tibetan Plateau and its surroundings\n\nXinghua Zhang, Wenhui Zhao, Lixiang Zhai, Miao Zhong, Jinsen Shi, Junying Sun, Yanmei Liu, Conghui Xie, Yulong Tan, Kemei Li, Xinlei Ge, Qi Zhang, Shichang Kang, and Jianzhong Xu\n\nEarth Syst.

The instrument is calibrated with NO2 and polydisperse nigrosin, resulting in very low uncertainties of the absorption coefficients: 4 % at 532 nm and 6 % at 1064 nm. The instrumentâs performance makes the PTAAM-2Î» a strong candidate for reference measurements of the aerosol absorption coefficient.\n\nThe chemical composition and mixing state of BC-containing particles and the implications on light absorption enhancement\n\nJiaxing Sun, Yele Sun, Conghui Xie, Weiqi Xu, Chun Chen, Zhe Wang, Lei Li, Xubing Du, Fugui Huang, Yan Li, Zhijie Li, Xiaole Pan, Nan Ma, Wanyun Xu, Pingqing Fu, and Zifa Wang\n\nAtmos.

BC was dominantly mixed with organic carbon, nitrate, and sulfate, and the mixing state evolved significantly as a function of relative humidity (RH) at both sites. The absorption enhancement depended strongly on coated secondary inorganic aerosol and was up to ~1.3–1.4 during aging processes.\n\nImpact of particle size, refractive index, and shape on the determination of the particle scattering coefficient â an optical closure study evaluating different nephelometer angular truncation and illumination corrections\n\nMarilena Teri, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Josef Gasteiger, Sara Valentini, Helmuth Horvath, Roberta Vecchi, Paulus Bauer, Adrian Walser, and Bernadett Weinzierl\n\nAtmos.

The performance of portable instruments such as NanoScan SMPS, and GRIMM Mini WRAS spectrometer measuring the particle number size distribution in the range from 10 to 200 nm were investigated. The influence of different aerosol types and maintenance activities on these instruments were explored. The results show that these portable instruments are suitable for mobile UFP measurements for source identification.\n\nThe impact of temperature inversions on black carbon and particle mass concentrations in a mountainous area\n\nKristina Glojek, GriÅ¡a MoÄnik, Honey Dawn C.

We found that measured black carbon (eBC) and particulate matter (PM) in rural shallow terrain depressions with residential wood burning could be much greater than predicted by models. The exceeding levels are a cause for concern since similar conditions can be expected in numerous hilly and mountainous regions across Europe, where approximately 20 % of the total population lives.\n\nOn the application and grid-size sensitivity of the urban dispersion model CAIRDIO v2.0 under real city weather conditions\n\nMichael Weger, Holger Baars, Henriette Gebauer, Maik Merkel, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Bernd Heinold\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 3315–3345, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3315-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-3315-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNumerical models are an important tool to assess the air quality in cities, as they can provide near-continouos data in time and space. In this paper, air pollution for an entire city is simulated at a high spatial resolution of 40 m. At this spatial scale, the effects of buildings on the atmosphere, like channeling or blocking of the air flow, are directly represented by diffuse obstacles in the used model CAIRDIO. For model validation, measurements from air-monitoring sites are used.\n\nUnderstanding aerosol microphysical properties from 10 years of data collected at Cabo Verde based on an unsupervised machine learning classification\n\nXianda Gong, Heike Wex, Thomas MÃ¼ller, Silvia Henning, Jens VoigtlÃ¤nder, Alfred Wiedensohler, and Frank Stratmann\n\nAtmos.

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm, K-means, was implemented to study the aerosol types. Cloud condensation nuclei number concentrations during dust periods were 2.5 times higher than marine periods. The long-term data sets, together with the aerosol classification, can be used as a basis to improve understanding of annual cycles of aerosol, and aerosol-cloud interactions in the North Atlantic.\n\nMeasurement report: On the difference in aerosol hygroscopicity between high and low relative humidity conditions in the North China Plain\n\nJingnan Shi, Juan Hong, Nan Ma, Qingwei Luo, Yao He, Hanbing Xu, Haobo Tan, Qiaoqiao Wang, Jiangchuan Tao, Yaqing Zhou, Shuang Han, Long Peng, Linhong Xie, Guangsheng Zhou, Wanyun Xu, Yele Sun, Yafang Cheng, and Hang Su\n\nAtmos.

We observed differences in aerosol hygroscopicity during two distinct episodes with different primary emissions and secondary aerosol formation processes. These results provide an improved understanding of the complex influence of sources and aerosol evolution processes on their hygroscopicity.\n\nHygroscopicity of organic compounds as a function of organic functionality, water solubility, molecular weight, and oxidation level\n\nShuang Han, Juan Hong, Qingwei Luo, Hanbing Xu, Haobo Tan, Qiaoqiao Wang, Jiangchuan Tao, Yaqing Zhou, Long Peng, Yao He, Jingnan Shi, Nan Ma, Yafang Cheng, and Hang Su\n\nAtmos.

Particle effective density exhibits a high-frequency bimodal distribution, and two density modes exhibit opposite trends with increasing particle size. SIA and BC mass fractions are key factors of particle effective density, and a value of 0.6 g cm−3 is appropriate to represent BC effective density in bulk particles.\n\nSeasonality of the particle number concentration and size distribution: a global analysis retrieved from the network of Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) near-surface observatories\n\nClÃ©mence Rose, Martine Collaud Coen, Elisabeth Andrews, Yong Lin, Isaline Bossert, Cathrine Lund Myhre, Thomas Tuch, Alfred Wiedensohler, Markus Fiebig, Pasi Aalto, AndrÃ©s Alastuey, Elisabeth Alonso-Blanco, Marcos Andrade, BegoÃ±a ArtÃ­Ã±ano, Todor Arsov, Urs Baltensperger, Susanne Bastian, Olaf Bath, Johan Paul Beukes, Benjamin T.

Based on two measurement campaigns in the rural background of central Europe, different measurement approaches were compared with each other, such as modeling based on Mie theory and direct in situ or remote sensing measurements. Among others, it was shown that the aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio is relative humidity dependent, and refinement with respect to the model input parameters is needed.\n\nIdentifying source regions of air masses sampled at the tropical high-altitude site of Chacaltaya using WRF-FLEXPART and cluster analysis\n\nDiego Aliaga, Victoria A.

Three-quarters of the measured air has not been influenced by the surface in the previous 4 d. However, it is rare that, at any given time, the sampled air has not been influenced at all by the surface, and often the sampled air has multiple origins. The influence of the surface is more prevalent during day than night. Furthermore, during the 6-month study, one-third of the air masses originated from Amazonia.\n\nCalibration and evaluation of a broad supersaturation scanning (BS2) cloud condensation nuclei counter for rapid measurement of particle hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity\n\nNajin Kim, Yafang Cheng, Nan Ma, Mira L.

We describe how the BS2-CCN system can be effectively calibrated and which factors can affect the calibration curve. Intercomparison experiments between typical DMA-CCN and BS2-CCN measurements to evaluate the BS2-CCN system showed high correlation and good agreement.\n\nA global study of hygroscopicity-driven light-scattering enhancement in the context of other in situ aerosol optical properties\n\nGloria Titos, MarÃ­a A.

It is shown that the relative change in BC radiative forcing can be larger than 50 % as a function of changing fractal dimension and organic content. A comprehensive parameterization scheme for coated BC optical properties is developed with applications for modelling, ambient, and laboratory-based BC studies.\n\nOccurrence of new particle formation events in Siberian and Finnish boreal forest\n\nHelmi Uusitalo, Jenni Kontkanen, Ilona Ylivinkka, Ekaterina Ezhova, Anastasiia Demakova, Mikhail Arshinov, Boris Denisovich Belan, Denis Davydov, Nan Ma, Tuukka PetÃ¤jÃ¤, Alfred Wiedensohler, Markku Kulmala, and Tuomo Nieminen\n\nAtmos.

We applied eight different absorbing-aerosol measurement methods in a field campaign at the Arctic Pallas station. The filter-based techniques were found to be the most sensitive to detect the minuscule amounts of black carbon present, showing a 40 % agreement between them. Our results help to reduce uncertainties in absorbing aerosol measurements.\n\nTerrestrial or marine â indications towards the origin of ice-nucleating particles during melt season in the European Arctic up to 83.7Â° N\n\nMarkus Hartmann, Xianda Gong, Simonas Kecorius, Manuela van Pinxteren, Teresa Vogl, AndrÃ© Welti, Heike Wex, Sebastian Zeppenfeld, Hartmut Herrmann, Alfred Wiedensohler, an"
