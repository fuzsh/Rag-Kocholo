        "text": "Elizabeth Barrett Browning (born March 6, 1806, near Durham, Durham county, England—died June 29, 1861, Florence, Italy) was an English poet whose reputation rests chiefly upon her love poems, Sonnets from the Portuguese and Aurora Leigh, the latter now considered an early feminist text. Her husband was Robert Browning.\n\nElizabeth was the eldest child of Edward Barrett Moulton (later Edward Moulton Barrett). Most of her girlhood was spent at a country house within sight of the Malvern Hills, in Worcestershire, where she was extraordinarily happy. At the age of 15, however, she fell seriously ill, probably as the result of a spinal injury, and her health was permanently affected.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry\n\nIn 1832 the family moved to Sidmouth, Devon, and in 1836 they moved to London, where in 1838 they took up residence at 50 Wimpole Street. In London she contributed to several periodicals, and her first collection, The Seraphim and Other Poems, appeared in 1838. For reasons of health, she spent the next three years in Torquay, Devon. After the death by drowning of her brother, Edward, she developed an almost morbid terror of meeting anyone apart from a small circle of intimates. Her name, however, was well known in literary circles, and in 1844 her second volume of poetry, Poems, by Elizabeth Barrett Barrett, was enthusiastically received.\n\nIn January 1845 she received from the poet Robert Browning a letter that begins with “I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,” and culminates with “I do, as I say, love these books with all my heart—and I love you too.” In early summer the two met. Their courtship (whose daily progress is recorded in their letters) was kept a close secret from Elizabeth’s despotic father, of whom she stood in some fear. Sonnets from the Portuguese (1850) records her reluctance to marry, but their wedding had taken place on September 12, 1846. Her father knew nothing of it, and Elizabeth continued to live at home for a week.\n\nThe Brownings then left for Pisa. (When Barrett died in 1857, Elizabeth was still unforgiven.) While in Pisa she wrote The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim’s Point (Boston, 1848; London, 1849), a protest against slavery in the United States. The couple then settled in Florence, where their only child, Robert Wiedemann Barrett, was born in 1849.\n\nIn 1851 and in 1855 the couple visited London. During the second visit, Elizabeth Barrett Browning completed her most ambitious work, Aurora Leigh (1857), a long blank-verse poem telling the complicated and melodramatic love story of a young girl and a misguided philanthropist. This work did not impress most critics, though it was a huge popular success."
