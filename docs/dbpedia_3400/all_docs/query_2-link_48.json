        "meta_description": "Josef Pokorny, 79, resident of Chelmsford, MA for 46 years, passed peacefully on March 20, 2018, at the LifeCare Center, Billerica, MA with his wife, Elisabeth, at his side.  Josef was born in Gyorsentivan, Hungary on November 23, 1938.  He was the eldest son of Jozsef Pokorny and Erzsebet (Czifrik) Pokorny.  He grew up in Budaors, Hungary, until leaving his beloved country in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution.  As an 18 year old refugee, Josef fled to Austria, then on to Germany where he met the love of his life, Elisabeth Wiedemann. They married in August 1962 and came to the United States in November 1962 sponsored by his uncle, Miklos Czifrik.  They lived in Maynard, MA for eight years, eventually settling in Chelmsford, MA in 1971.  Josef was employed as a tool and die design engineer for forty years working at various positions in Germany and in the Merrimack Valley.  He received his Tool & Die diploma in Goppingen, Germany.  He later received his Mechanical Engineering certificate from La Salle University.  He truly loved his work and his passion for designing continued long after his retirement.  He loved tinkering in his garage and fixing anything brought to him, loving the challenge of repairing the broken.  Josef played semi-pro soccer in Europe and shared his talents with the Chelmsford Youth Soccer Association as a volunteer coach and referee throughout the 70’s and early 80’s. He loved all sports and was an avid Boston fan.  He especially enjoyed supporting his grandchildren at their sporting events.  He was an active member of the German Club of Walpole, MA and enjoyed sharing his Hungarian culture, traditions, music, dance and food, especially Elisabeth’s Hungarian goulash with many friends.  He loved fishing, chess, and was always up for a game.  Josef loved people and his social ways gained him many friends over the years.  He was a communicant of St. Mary’s Church and had a deep faith in God. Josef was a caring, understanding, and loving husband, father and grandfather.  He will be missed by all that knew him.  In addition to his wife Elisabeth, Josef leaves three daughters Gabriele Stritch and her husband James of Berlin, CT; Christine Cambrils of Hudson, NH; Elizabeth Maurais and her husband Gerald of Hopedale, MA; two brothers, Imre Pokorny of Goppingen, Germany; Laszlo Pokorny of Budaors, Hungary; a sister, Ilona Berecz of Budaors, Hungary.  He was the proud grandfather of Kevin, Tyler, Aaron, Paul, Rita and Carrie.  He was predeceased by his parents and sister, Erzsebet Beluscsak.  Relatives and friends may call at the BLAKE CHELMSFORD FUNERAL HOME, 24 Worthen St., Chelmsford,  on Sunday, March 25 from 2-5  pm. His funeral Mass will be celebrated on Monday, March 26, at 11:00 am at St. Mary’s Church, 25 North Road, Chelmsford, MA.  Interment will follow at St. Joseph’s Cemetery, Chelmsford.    In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in his memory to the Alzheimer’s Association MA/NH, 309 Waverley Oaks Rd., Waltham, MA 02452 or Chelmsford Elder Services, 75 Groton Rd., North Chelmsford, MA 01863.",

I am particularly grateful for contacting the Air Force honor guard. Not many of my father's friends, and some relatives, knew he was a service member.\n\nSincerely, Alan (Jr)\n\nJuly 2024\n\nThank you for making a difficut time more bearable. The services you provided were exceptional. My family could tell that our loved one was in good hands right from the start.\n\nThe property was pristine and the rooms were welcoming. The staff was understanding and helpful.\n\nFrom our family to yours, We thank you from the bottom of our heart.\n\nWith Gratitude, the Family of Kelly Mithcell August 2022\n\nI would like to thank the staff of Blake’s Funeral Home for helping to make a difficult time a little bit easier.\n\nYour staff is very warm and always went the extra mile to pay attention to details. When I had questions someone always got back to me promptly.\n\nOn behalf of my family thank you so much for all the help and guidance throughout the whole process.\n\nKirsten Capowski\n\nApril 2022\n\nBlake Funeral Home helped us through a traumatic time with compassion, grace, and attention to detail.\n\nJennifer H. really went the extra mile sorting things out and seeing that all was taken care of.

From that\n\nfirst phone call, everyone we spoke to was kind and professional and went out of their way to make this as stress free as possible.\n\nElizabeth Amodeo, our Funeral Director walked us through the process with compassion and patience. No question\n\nwent unanswered and every phone call was returned. When we walked in for the wake everything was beautiful.\n\nThank you for making our experience as painless as possible.\n\nThe Buckley/Dillon Family\n\nJuly 3, 2021\n\nPaul and Jennifer,\n\nOn behalf of my family, I would like to thank you for the kindness and professionalism you and your staff displayed throughout the week in support of my mother’s funeral. Your guidance, advice, and attention to detail were first-rate. You eased our anxieties by assisting us with writing the obituary, selecting a prayer card, selecting a casket, ordering flowers, answering numerous questions, guiding the viewing & funeral services at the Transfiguration Greek Orthodox Church and final interment at the Chelmsford Cemetery.\n\nEverything went perfectly. My mom looked great. The church service and interment went flawlessly. The added touches like providing tissues, mints, and water bottles in the pews, or when one of your drivers provided his jacket to my dad to stay warm at the cemetery, were noticed and very much appreciated.\n\nYou made this day extra special. I know my mother was watching and is extremely pleased.\"\n\nGod bless,\n\nErnie S. and family\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nHello,\n\nI recently attended a wake and service at Blake Chelmsford Funeral Home. I just wanted to tell you that I can honestly say that Blake did such an amazing job with everything. All the details were handled so well. The gentleman from Blake staff who spoke on behalf of the funeral home and for the family was so genuine and displayed understanding, kindness and compassion when he spoke. His heartfelt words were just what we needed, all the way down to reading \"Footprints\". Thank you for making such a horrible, sad time a little easier.\n\nRegards,\n\nEllen A.\n\nApril 2017\n\nI want to tell Paul Hardy how much I appreciated the care, concern and professional way Ralph’s funeral was handled, and the staff was very supportive and handled all the details, relieving me of having to check on anything….I just had to show up with our families.\n\nSince it was a traumatic time, despite the fact we knew we were losing him, the long months of his failing had drained much of my energy caring for him….so being welcomed into the Blake Home family and staff and their taking over, made the entire experience so much easier.\n\nThank you all for everything,\n\nBarbara R.\n\nJuly 2018"
