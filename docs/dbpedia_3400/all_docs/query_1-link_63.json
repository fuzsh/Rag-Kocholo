        "text": "Early Life in Scotland\n\nElizabeth Borthwick, was born on 5 August 1814 and baptised in Glasgow, Scotland. The Old Parish Records for Glasgow, headed August 1814, contain the following entry: :\n\nBorthwick. William Borthwick Clerk & Helen Paterson a Law'l Dau'r Elisabeth born 5th. Witn's Thomas Strathern & Rob't Jackson.\n\nWe don't yet know who these witnesses were or whether they were connected in any way with our Borthwick family.\n\nElizabeth was the second child of this name born to William Murray Borthwick and Helen Paterson. Another Elizabeth had been born in Denny, Stirling, Scotland on 27 December 1810, but died in April 1812 when she was only 15 months old. She was buried in the Churchyard at Symington, Lanark, where her great-grandparents, Thomas Paterson & Marion Kay, her mother's grandparents, were then buried.\n\nIn 1814, the year this second Elizabeth was born, the family seems to have been living in Glasgow as William Murray Borthwick appears in a Glasgow Post Office Directory in that year:\n\nBorthwick W M , Star Office; house, 27 Gibson street.\n\nAs yet we don't know anything about the \"Star Office\" (insurance or newspaper?) and haven't traced 27 Gibson St. In about 1817 the family moved to Hamilton and later Edinburgh, until about 1829, then I've lost them until they left the UK and sailed to Australia in 1833. Elizabeth's education must have taken place in Scotland. She was 18 years old when the family arrived in Sydney, Australia on the \"Lady East\" in November 1833.\n\nSettling in Australia\n\nAs an 18 year old Elizabeth, like her older sister Theressa, may have found employment outside her home when she first arrived in Australia. If so, we do not have any idea what she might have done. Her father worked for two years for William Cox of Hobartville and then two years for Colonel Dumaresq.\n\nElizabeth would have been about 25 years old when the family moved to Inverell in the late 1830s. Did she go with them or stay in the New England or Hunter valley?\n\nWhen Elizabeth was 24 years old she had a daughter, Helen Paterson Borthwick, born out of wedlock on 1 September 1837. (A \"merrybegotten child\" as they said in the Parish registers of the 1700s and 1800s.)\n\nIt is not certain at this stage whether Helen was born in Sydney, the Hunter Valley or the New England. In 1847 when she was baptised, the church was told that Helen's father was \"George Batchelor, Settler of Ellangowan\". One of Helen Paterson Borthwick's great-grandsons has searched for George Batchelor without success so if any reader has any advice or leads about finding him we would be very pleased to hear from you.\n\nMarriage to Michael Daisey, 1844\n\nThe Hunter Valley Parish Registers record that on 20 June 1844 Elizabeth Borthwick of Scone, spinster, married Michael \"Deasy\" of Scone, bachelor, at St Luke's Church of England, Scone. The Official was John Morse AM, Chaplain of Scone.\n\nNo occupation is given for Michael Deasy. Witnesses to the marriage were Elizabeth's sister Jane Borthwick, of Scone, and her brother Thomas Paterson Borthwick. It is not known what Jane was doing at Scone at this time. Their parents had moved to Inverell in the late 1830s. At least some members of the Borthwick family had been settlers at Murrurundi and \"Maryland\" New England in 1839. (The place called \"Maryland\" has not yet been located. It may have been Maryland near Tenterfield and Stanthorpe.)\n\nThere will be another page on this site for Thomas Paterson Borthwick but he held a licence for The Fitzroy Hotel, Singleton in 1853, 1854 and 1856.\n\nHelen was seven years old at the time of her mother's marriage and it is said that Michael Daisey brought her up as his own child, although she did not change her surname. It seems that the family lived at or near \"Auburn Vale\" for some time as William Murray Borthwick refers to his son-in-law Michael Daisey being there in a letter written to the Commissioner for Lands in August 1946, and in 1849 Michael and Elizabeth's first son was born at Gum Flat near Inverell.\n\nHis descendants understand that Michael Daisy came to Australia in 1834 and that the Daisy / Daisey family originally came from Sutherland in Scotland and moved to Ireland. We don't yet know, however, what ship Michael Daisey arrived on or what he did when he first embarked in this country.\n\nNor do we know exactly when and where Michael Daisey was born. His birth year was given as follows: Age at 1st marriage was 30 = born circa 1814. Age at 2nd marriage was 52 = born circa 1815. Age at death was 67 = b. circa 1815.\n\nFrederick Morrison, MA, MD, in Aldine's History of Queensland, Volume II, 1888, p.530, says the following about Michael Daisey:\n\nThe late Michael Daisey, as one of the early pioneers, may fairly claim a place of recognition in this work. He was in every sense of the word a self-made man, and well made at that. He was born in Ireland in the year 1815, and arrived in New South Wales about 1836, and was employed by the late Peter McIntyre, in whose service he saw some rough life, overlanding, etc. He soon acquired a good knowledge of stock generally and their management. He, with two others, came from Maitland to the New England district, and took up the well known runs of Byron and Auburn Vale. In 1858 he went into the Maranoa district to inspect Coogoon, which he purchased from the late Sir J. P. Bell. The following year he took sheep and cattle there, and formed the station on which he carried on successfully until the year 1873, when he sold it. He became a landowner and resident of the West Moreton district in 1861, and resided there until his death in 1881. The Coogoon run is situated in what was known as the \"Never Never\" country, Talavera being on the one side and Mount Abundance on the other.\n\nThe sources for this information are not given however, making research difficult.\n\nIt is said that Michael Daisy acquired pastoral experience in the Maitland area before acquiring two runs in the New England area of NSW. (\"The Changing Years. History of Shire of Waroo\", G O Armstrong ....Bendemere Shire History...?) He is not listed in \"Squatting in Crown Lands in NSW\" and it is thought that the New England properties may be references to \"Byron Station\", a run claimed and then leased by Peter McIntyre, and \"Auburn Vale\", claimed and then leased by William Murray Borthwick. A Michael Dacy (Daisy) was one of nine free men employed on Byron Plains in 1840. (Elizabeth Wiedemann, World of Its Own, Inverell Shire Council and Devill Publicity, 1981, p.39.) It is believed that Peter McIntyre taught him about the pastoral scene. Instead of taking pay he took cattle and before long had enough to start on his own.\n\nA \"Michael Deasy\", who was of Blairmore at the time, had been witness to the wedding of Charles Singleton and Mary Keating on 10 September 1840. (Hunter Valley Parish Register) It is not known whether this is the Michael Deasy who married Elizabeth Borthwick but Charles and Mary became the parents of of Joseph Singleton, who in 1862 became Elizabeth Daisey's son-in-law. Did Michael Daisey have anything to do with the introduction of Helen and Joseph?\n\nDaisey descendants believe that Michael's first property was near Tamworth. \"Daisey's Crossing\" over the Balonne River between \"Talavera\" and \"Newstead\" apparently still exists.\n\nMichael Daisey and Elizabeth Borthwick probably moved to Queensland around the time of John William Daisey's birth in 1849.\n\nIf as stated on his death certificate Michael Daisey had been in Qld. for 47 years this would mean he went to Qld. in 1834. We know this isn't correct so it would seem that the 47 years refers to his period in the colonies, hence the assumption that he arrived in Australia in 1834.\n\nIn NSW the properties with which Michael had been connected were Byron Station (Peter McIntyre's run), Auburn Vale (William Murray Borthwick's run) and the place near Tamworth (unnamed).\n\nThe following are some of the Queensland properties with which Michael Daisey is said to have been connected:\n\nWhetstone. Extract from Moreton Bay Courier Saturday 12th June 1852. 'Squatters in The Northern Districts' Licensed occupants of Crown Lands in the Moreton Bay District and paying assesments on stock there depastured: Darling Downs District : - Michael Daisey, 'Whetstone'. - Hodgson & Davidson, 'Eton Vale'.\n\nCoogoon. Descendants advise that the Daiseys bought \"Coogoon\" in Queensland from Sir Peter Joshua Bell in 1856. (This property is also referred to in the records as Cagoon, Cogoon and Cagoone.) However an extract from Moreton Bay Courier Saturday 9 October 1852 refers to Michael Daisey being at Coogoon at that date. \"Prospecting for Gold' by R Shannon, Warick, 24th Sept. 1852.\n\nI minutely inspected McDougall's \"Oakey Creek\" (far-famed I believe), but owing to the great want for water, could not make the trial wished for. Horses heads were next pointed to Fleming's Public House, Devines, and Michael Daisy's \"Cagoon\".\n\nWas Michael a squatter or a purchaser? or perhaps one and then the other?\n\nMichael Daisey stocked Cagoon with sheep and cattle but sold the property after serious cattle stealing problems. (\"The Changing Years. History of Shire of Warooo\", G O Armstrong ....Bendemere Shire History...? from DG)\n\nIn 1862-71 Michael Daisey was recorded as Leaseholder of a Pastural License at Coogoon Creek. (Is this different to the property \"Coogoon\"?) So it seems that he must have sold the property sometime after that. The Electoral Roll for the district of Maranoa 1863 (is not in alphabetical order) records \"Daisy, Michael, Coogoon Leaseholder Coogoon Creek\".\n\nMoogoon. (Also referred to as Magoon and even Moongone!) This property is above Surat on the Balonne River. It eventually became part of the \"Warkon\" holding. (Warkon passed through the hands of five different owners between 1850 and 1875.)\n\nAn extract from the Moreton Bay Courier Saturday 15th October 1853 indicates that it was transferred to Michael Daisey in that year:\n\nTransfers of Runs.\n\nDarling Downs Alex Campbell, \"Whetstone\"' & \"Swithland\" , to P Devine.\n\nKettle & Spinks, \"'Moogoon\", to Michael Daisey.\n\nOn the 1864-65 Roll of Electors in the Drayton & Toowoomba Electorate 121 is listed \"Michael Daisy, Moongone,freehold\".\n\nLittle Pocket. 1867-70: Michael Daisey was freeholder at Little Pocket, West Moreton Div.\n\nMurella. In 1870 Michael Daisy bought \"Murella\" from Peter Joshua Bell.\n\nOther properties he acquired, each of 16,000 acres, were \"Coolaba\", \"Uraller\", and \"Dunwoodie\".\n\nIf any reader knows anything about these properties or their history I would be delighted to hear from you. Please email me!\n\nMichael and Elizabeth Daisey had a son named John William on 18 June 1849. (He is recorded as Daisy on the Pioneers index.) His birth was registered in NSW and apparently also at Ipswich, Qld. However John William Daisy's baptism was registered at Armidale, Church of England, 18492694 V35.\n\nThe second son of Michael Daisey and Elizabeth Borthwick was Thomas James Daisey who was born in 1855 and died in 1856.\n\nI will write much more about John William Daisey and his family but for the moment will quote Frederick Morrison, MA, MD, Aldine's History of Queensland, Volume II, 1888:\n\nJohn William Daisey, JP, was born at Gum Flat, near Inverell New South Wales, in 1849, but left there when an infant and came to McIntyre Brook. When eleven years old he came to Ipswich with his parents and attended Mr Thomas Fraser's private school for about 6 years. On leaving that institution, he entered the Ipswich Grammar School, where he remained until 1867, at which time he was sent by his father to his station, to gain experience in station management. As soon as he was considered competent he took the management of Coogoon, where he remained till that station was sold in 1873. After about two years hard struggle against dry seasons & bad country, he came to his present station, Murilla, bought by his father, in the Maranoa District & remained as manager of that station up to the time of his father's death, when he came to Ipswich to look after his father's estate & the important enterprise of breeding of choice draught stock & the cultivation of their feed. He soon afterwoods started a sawmill at Mudgaraha, near Nerang, with a partner, and spent ï¿½13,000 in the enterprise, and now has the satisfaction of knowing that he possesses one of the best mills in Southern Queensland; then he went into coal-mining, bought largely of shares in the \"Bore Hole\" and Cooniana, which enterprise was not very profitable as the supply of coal seemed to be greater than the demand. He still carries on the breeding of heavy draught stock, for which he has taken several prizes at pastoral and agricultural shows.\n\n[Note: Mudgaraha is Mudgeeraba, where there were three sawmills on the Springbrook Rd, off the Nerang/Currumbin Rd, in 1976.]\n\nJohn Daisey married and had a young family (see below) but died very suddenly after a heart attack on the day he turned 40 years old. He didn't leave a will and it is thought that soon afterwards the Queensland branch of the Bank of England collapsed, leaving the family with significant financial problems. Many of their properties and assets had to be sold.\n\nMichael and Elizabeth had retired to \"Bremer Lodge\" in Ipswich when it was time for their son John to enter Ipswich Grammar School. On 5 December 1865 Elizabeth Daisey died at Bremer Lodge, aged only 51, leaving Michael and their surviving son, John William, aged 16.\n\nTwo years later Michael Daisey remarried. His new wife was Annie Hodgson. Michael and Annie did not have any children of their own but she became a second mother to John William and a much-loved \"Auntie Daisey\" to his children and grandchildren. The marriage was announced in the Queensland Times of 3 Sep 1867:\n\nMarriage: At residence of father of the bride by special license by Rev W Hill, Michael Daisey Esq. of Bremer Lodge formerly of Co. Cork Ireland, to Annie, eldest daughter of William Hodgson Esq. of Jessie Vale, a native of Cumberland England.\n\nIt seems that Bremer Lodge was also the venue for weddings as an extract from Queensland Times, 5 September 1868 (printed under Deaths!) reads: On 20th Aug at Bremer Lodge, the residence of Michael Daisey, by Rev J Gardiner, Frederick Ellis to Amelia Curtis.\n\nAnother Daisey / Hodgson marriage took place in 1875 when John married his step-mother's sister, Sarah Jane Hodgson. The marriage notice was in the Queensland Times of 19 June 1875:\n\nAt residence of bride's father by Rev Lloyd C Williams, Rector of St Luke's, Ipswich, John William, son of Michael Daisey, to Sarah Jane, the youngest daughter of William Hodgson of Brayton, Dugandan.\n\nJohn and Sarah had seven children, of whom lived to adulthood. In brief they were: Jane Elizabeth Daisey, Michael William Daisey, Annie Hodgson Daisey, Sarah Jane (Cissy) Daisey, John Fletcher Daisey, Elizabeth Clara (Clara) Daisey and Edith Mary Daisey.\n\nDescendant surnames include: BAMBRICK, BRADY, CARSBURG, CHANDLER, DAVIS, FLACK, GREENFIELD, KEMP, LAMBART, LEUTCHFORD, McINDOE, STOKES, TIBBITS, WEBER, WILLIAMS and WILLIMOTT. If you are connected to any of these families I would love to hear from you. Please email me!\n\nDeath of Michael Daisey\n\nMichael Daisey's Death Notice was published in the Queensland Times, on 31 May 1881, and in the Brisbane Courier of 7 June 1881:\n\nDAISEY, Mr Michael - On 28 May at Iffley, Ipswich, Michael Daisey, age 66 years.\n\n1879-81: Transfers of real estate by death. Claimants Anne Daisey and John William Daisey, grazier, both of Ipswich. Will drawn 18 October 1873, No 990.\n\nThere will be more:\n\nThere is a great deal more to be researched and written about the Daisey and Singleton families.
