        "text": "View printable version of answers to this question\n\nOverview\n\nDefinitions of Long-Term Care:\n\nIn the World Report on Ageing and Health published in 2015 by the World Health Organization, Long-Term Care was defined as “the activities undertaken by others to ensure that people with, or at risk of, a significant ongoing loss of intrinsic capacity can maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms and human dignity”. This definition supports the idea of a system to enable people to live their best lives, irrespective of their disabilities and health conditions.\n\nLong-term care “systems”\n\nIn practice, long-term care covers a wide range of services and activities that can take place in various settings, including the beneficiary’s home, their neighbourhood, hospices, residential settings and day-care facilities.\n\nLong-term care benefits, services and activities typically span multiple government departments (health, social welfare, labour, housing) and levels (national, regional, local, community and family), which leads to fragmentation of responsibility, difficulties in coordination and, from the point of view of the persons who could benefit from services, benefits and activities, barriers to access.\n\nIn this section we aim to provide a very brief overview of long-term care systems around the world, at national or sub-national level. The term system is used as in the WHO World report on Ageing and Health, to refer to: all caregivers and settings where care is provided, as well as the governance and support services that can help them in their roles. This definition includes care provided in the formal and informal sector, paid and unpaid, publicly and privately provided and delivered, in people’s own homes, in the community and in institutional settings.\n\nThis is a comprehensive definition of long-term care covering care and support in the community and in congregate (“institutional”) settings, by formal care providers and by unpaid carers, and for younger and older adults. Some of the definitions used in the reports from the different countries may vary in terms of the groups and types of care included.\n\nIt is important to emphasise that experiences of a “long-term care system” (and care outcomes) differ, not only depending on which country/region they live in, but also by their local context (which is why there is growing use of the term “care ecosystem” see for example Dessers & Mohr, 2020), and of their own individual and family circumstances.\n\nReferences:\n\nDessers, E. and Mohr, B. J. (2020) ‘An ecosystem perspective on care coordination: Lessons from the field’, International Journal of Care Coordination, 23(1), pp. 5–8. doi: 10.1177/2053434519896523.\n\nInternational reports and sources\n\nOECD countries\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) publishes regularly international reports and data on long-term care (click here).\n\nWHO data\n\nSome data on long-term care, for example on the numbers of countries that have a long-term care policy/plan/strategy is also available from the WHO’s Ageing Data portal (click here).\n\nEuropean countries\n\nFor European countries, the European Centre for Disease prevention and control (ECDC), also publishes data on the numbers of people in Long-Term Care Facilities (ECDC), and on number of beds (click here) There are country reports from EU countries (2018) on EU website: (click here).\n\nLatin American and Caribbean countries\n\nthe Interamerican Development Bank has developed the Panorama of Aging and Long-Term Care, gathering indicators, publications and case studies to support policy development (click here).\n\nAustralia\n\nWhat is understood as Long-Term Care in Australia?\n\nIn Australia the term ‘long term care’ is seldom used. ‘Aged care’ is the more common term.\n\nUnlike many other countries older Australians needing support and people with disabilities aged under 65 are funded and supported under two distinct Australian government policies and funding arrangements: Aged Care and the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS).\n\nAged Care\n\nThe two main forms of government-subsidised aged care (LTC) are residential aged care and home care.\n\nThe Australian government is the primary funder and regulator of the long-term care system. The government subsidises both home care and residential care for people of all ages who have been assessed as needing care and support. There are four main types of services under aged care: the Commonwealth Home Support Programme (CHSP) Home Care Packages (HCP), residential care and flexible care. More than 1.2 million people received aged care services during 2017–2018. 77% received support in their home or other community-based settings. Of Australians over the age of 65, 7% accessed residential aged care, 22% accessed some form of support or care at home, and 71% lived at home without accessing government-subsidised aged care services (sources: Care, Dignity and Respect report; Aged Care and COVID-19 report).\n\nThe National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS)\n\nThe NDIS, implemented from 2013 to 2020, has established a needs-based system of care and support for people with disability with ‘permanent and significant’ disability, with assessment of need based on level of impairment. The NDIS provides individualised support for approximately 500,000 people across Australia (Hamilton et al forthcoming).\n\nAustria\n\nAustria is a federal state and was one of the ‘early movers’ when it came to acknowledge long-term care (LTC) as a social risk that calls for solidarity and societal support for people in need of long-term care. With the introduction of the LTC allowance scheme in 1993, Austria followed its tradition as a continental, conservative welfare regime in which cash benefits dominate over the provision of social services. At the same time, the country deviated from this pathway as funding of the LTC allowances (attendance allowance) has been stipulated through general taxes rather than as a fifth pillar of the social insurance system.\n\nWith this original reform, competences between the federal state and the nine provinces were reshuffled in that the federal government became responsible for financing all cash benefits, including support for informal carers, while the provincial governments remained in charge to procure community care services and residential facilities. Indeed, home care services are almost entirely provided by private non-profit organisations (based on a long-standing tradition), while about 50% of residential facilities are managed by public entities, 25% by non-profit organisations, while the share of private for-profit providers has been increasing and is currently also at about 25%. To date, there are about 75,000 places in care homes, about 7,000 places in alternative housing and short-term facilities, while about 150,000 persons are using one or the other home care service throughout the year (Statistics Austria, 2021). As there are about 470,000 beneficiaries of the LTC allowance, it becomes evident that the large majority of people in need of care is being cared for at home with support by an informal carer, mainly by wives, daughters and step-daughters. In total, it has been estimated that there are about 801,000 Austrians involved in caring for a loved one at home, while 146,000 are supporting a family member who is living in a care home, i.e. more than 10% of the population (Nagl-Cupal et al., 2018).\n\nA survey found that many Austrians experienced barriers to accessing care services, with availability of services being a major factor, as well as cost. Compared to other countries in the European Union, Austrians reported more concerns about the availability of residential care. This lack of availability of services translate in over-reliance on informal support and low confidence on the ability of the system to address future care needs (Ilinca et al., 2022)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, a specific feature of the Austrian LTC system has developed over the past 25 years in terms of a partial replacement (or supplementation) of family care by live-in personal carers, mainly from neighbouring Eastern European countries. Although live-in migrant care is a widespread phenomenon across Europe, the so-called ‘24-hour care’ model in Austria has a special status with dedicated legal regulations and funding since 2007 (Schmidt et al., 2016). ‘Personal carers’ are registered as self-employed at the Austrian Chamber of Commerce, although most of them are also dependent on specialised brokering agencies in their home country or in Austria (Aulenbacher et al., 2020). Due to the geographic situation as well as to unemployment and wage differentials in neighbouring countries, the share of older people in need of care relying on migrant live-in carers has increased significantly over the past 15 years. To date, more than 66,000 personal carers accompany about 33,000 Austrians in need of care in their own households (ca. 7% of total beneficiaries of the LTC allowance).\n\nThis phenomenon contributes to additional complexity in the already fragmented structural framework of LTC in Austria. The lack of coordination among different LTC settings, and in particular between these and the acute health sector, has been a constant criticism over the past decades, and related caveats became even more evident since the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and related measures such as travel restrictions and the closing of borders (Leichsenring et al., 2021).\n\nCurrent initiatives are striving to address shortcomings in information, communication and coordination by means of a pilot project to establish 150 community nurses at municipal level. However, the imminent shortage of workforce in the LTC sector and related challenges of sustainable funding are calling for urgent and more far-reaching reforms. There are currently about 60,000 professionals working in the various settings of LTC. It has been forecasted that a minimum of 30,000 additional professionals would be necessary until 2030 to replace retiring staff and to satisfy the growing demand of formal care (Rappold & Juraszovich, 2019).\n\nReferences\n\nAulenbacher, B., Leiblfinger, M. & Prieler, V.

The Government covers the costs of care for people who fit the “Three No’s” category: no ability to work, no income and no family. Relying on families as the main source of care is increasingly under question given demographic and social changes resulting in smaller and geographically dispersed families. In response to this, the government has increased its focus on developing a formal long-term care system, initially through encouraging the rapid development of a private institutional care sector, setting targets for numbers of beds. This took place before developing regulation and quality assurance mechanisms and has led to the lack of development of community-based care. There are shortages of trained care professionals. There have been pilots of social long-term care insurance in 16 cities since 2016, with strong policy interest on these as a mechanism for long-term care financing. For a good overview read Feng et al. (2020).\n\nCzech Republic\n\nInformal care constitutes a major part of care provided to older and dependent people. It is estimated that roughly 52% to 75% of care is provided by relatives, at home. The introduction of care allowance in 2007 has been the most significant change in the social services system since the 1990s, and the allowance has been used to compensate informal carers. Formal LTC is based on a two-tiered system of regulation, funding, and services provision—separate for the health sector and for the social services sector and some private provision of LTC services have been developing, including a rise of unregistered LTC services (Sowa-Kofta et al., 2017).\n\nReferences:\n\nSowa-Kofta, A., Wija, P. (2017). Czech Republic: Emerging policy developments in long-term care. CEQUA country report.\n\nDenmark\n\nThe Long-Term Care (LTC) system in Denmark is a universal and primarily public system. Access to LTC services is at no cost for home-based care, and with a means-tested co-payment for residential care. The LTC system has strong public and political support. It is a highly decentralized system, organised, and financed at the municipal level. Provision is mixed, with public and for-profit providers providing home care, and in the residential sector, non-profit providers also operate.\n\nThere is historically a strong emphasis on community-based care, integration, prevention and professionalization of care staff (WHO, 2019). The development of long-term care for older people has in Denmark been heavily influenced by the various reports from the National Commission on Ageing in the 1980s. The policy recommendation was here not least to encourage the increasing use of private resources, such as the involvement of voluntary organizations, but also referred to ensuring self-care (hjælp-til- selvhjælp) in old age, and in this way encourage a more preventive and rehabilitative approach. The reports also introduced principles of continuity and normalization, meaning that regardless of need for care the provision of care should aim at ensuring the continuation of the older person’s preferred way of living. From the 1990s onwards, marketisation and, more implicit, privatisation has been encouraged (Rostgaard, 2007).\n\nIn 2015, reablement was introduced in the legislation and must be offered instead of conventional home care is the older person is assessed to have so-called potential for this intervention (Rostgaard et al, 2023).\n\nThe main law regulating social service provision and, implicitly, LTC provision is the Social Services Act, which passed in 1998. The Social Services Act emphasizes the users’ right to influence social service provision and enshrines the highly decentralized nature of the system, putting municipalities in a key position to shape long-term care. As health care provisions are under the scope of the Health Care Act, there is political awareness of the problems of coordinating interventions and time-consuming double documentation. At present (2022), work is therefore carried out to reform the legislation and combine the two laws under one, a Senior Citizens’ Act.\n\nIn recent years there has been a decrease in the number of people who receive home care services, which resulted in unmet need and more burden placed on unpaid carers (WHO, 2019; Rostgaard, 2022 et al).\n\nReferences:\n\nRostgaard, T., Tuntland, H. and Parsons, J., (eds.)

Over 90% of the older population (75+) live in their own home, with the majority receiving no formal care (~75%), some receive regular home care, or informal care. Less than 10% of the older population receives some kind of 24-hour sheltered housing or institutional care (source: https://drive.google.com/file/d/19z_e5j7bcPxUYh2qLBa6VwrVDVnWilv7/view).\n\nFrance\n\nCurrently, there are 7,502 residential long-term care facilities welcoming 610,000 residents. Of these, 50% are public, 31% are not-for-profits and 24% are for-profit. There are 2,294 supported living settings. Hospitals also offer long-term care units, where there were 32,790 patients recorded in end-2015. There are approximately 886,000 people in receipt of domiciliary care, most of which are older people. Nursing and polyvalent domiciliary care services provide services to 125,7000 service users, and domiciliary care services provide care to 760,000 people (source: https://www2.assemblee-nationale.fr/static/15/pdf/rapport/i3633.pdf).\n\nIn 2015 there were 1.25M beneficiaries of the personal autonomy allowance for people over 60 in need of assistance with activities of daily living. (8% of over-60s)\n\nThe domiciliary care sector is extremely fragmented, with one department (local authority) having over 100 agencies. Financing is unprofitable. The difference between hourly rates under the personal autonomy allowance and minimum hourly rates to cover costs were of 2.2€/hour in 2017.\n\nHealth policies are implemented by the Regional health agencies at the regional level (ARS, created in 2009). Social policies are under the responsibility of the local authorities at the local decentralized level. There is a joint responsibility for tariff setting and financing of operations in care homes. ARS do not have oversight of domiciliary care, except where a nursing component is involved.\n\nGermany\n\nIn 1995/96, a statutory Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) Scheme has been established in Germany. LTCI is mandatory to the population. Approximately 88% of the population is insured by the social LTCIs, 11% by private funds (Blümel et al., 2020). LTC benefits based on the LTCI are not means-tested.\n\nIn 2019, there were about 4.13 million beneficiaries of the LTCI that have been allocated into care grades 1 to 5. Out of these, approximately 0.91 million people were living in residential care homes, while most people receive care and support at home (80%). Those living in their own home may choose between cash and in kind-benefits from LTCI. More than 60% receive cash benefits to be supported by informal carers only while almost 30% choose in kind-benefits, partly mixed with cash-benefits, to use also formal care. Approximately 80% of people with LTC needs living at home have a level 2 and 3 care need (Destatis, 2020).\n\nReferences\n\nBlümel, M., Spranger, A., Achstetter, K., Maresso, A. & Busse, R.

However, people who have no children or cannot have their support have difficulties accessing care should they need it (Deku et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nDeku, C. S., Forkuor, J.

There are also service and day care centres to support people who live in their own homes. Responsibility for home health is with the home health district and responsibility for social services with the municipalities. Residential and nursing homes are provided by both public (usually municipal) providers and private non-profit and for-profit providers, the state pays the greatest share or the cost of running care homes.\n\nIn 2011-12, 21% of older people aged 80 or more were living in institutional facilities and 43% were receiving home home help, the share of older people in institutional facilities is higher than in other Nordic countries and this has been attributed to an incentive for the municipalities to shift costs to the state.\n\nReferences:\n\nSigurveig H.

Families (particularly women) are the main source of care, as well as untrained care workers such as “home attenders”. It is common to live in multigenerational households which providers opportunities for the rotation of carers and sharing of tasks, however, there are growing number of nuclear families, suggesting that this model of care will become less important over time (Rajagopalan et al., 2020).\n\nThere are some formal care services available, mostly provided by private and not-for-profit organisations, these include residential care, day care centres, geriatric care in some government and private hospitals and services by non-governmental organisations (Ponnuswami et al., 2017).\n\nThere are several policies and public programmes that aim to promote the welfare of older people and people with disabilities providing the legal framework. Social Welfare is implemented by the States, which means that there are important variations in the implementation of measures to support older and disabled people (UNESCAP, 2016).\n\nReferences:\n\nPonnuswami I. and Rajasekaran R.

There are more public resources available for residential care than for home care services. By December 2018, 581 nursing homes in Ireland registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority offered 31,250 places for people with care needs. More than 460 of the homes are operated by private or voluntary (not-for-profit) providers), supporting 25,000 people. Ireland also has some ‘psychiatry of later life units’. Most of the residents are 65 years and older. Publicly funded support for home care can be obtained following a needs assessment conducted by a healthcare professional. So far financial means are not taken into consideration. Most home care services are provided by private providers, but these providers are contracted by the State. The role of the public sector in the delivery of home care is relatively small (Pierce et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nPierce, M., Keogh, F., O’Shea, E. (2020). ‘The impact of COVID-19 on people who use and provide long-term care in Ireland and mitigating measures.’ Country report available at LTCcovid.org, International Long-Term Care Policy Network, CPEC-LSE, 13 May 2020\n\nIsrael\n\nIsrael has a fragmented LTC system with the National Insurance (NI), the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Welfare and Social Affairs, holding different yet overlapping responsibilities for publicly funded LTC (source: Taub Centre).\n\nNotably, Israel was one of the first countries to introduce publically financed LTC insurance. Still, it is not universal and is of partial coverage for the mild and severely disabled older people. Most of the LTC treatment in Israel is community-based. At the beginning of 2020, some 220,830 older people received publicly funded LTC services at home (source: National Insurance Institute of Israel).\n\nItaly\n\nThe public system of LTC in Italy is underdeveloped and characterised by a high degree of institutional fragmentation, as sources of funding, governance and managerial responsibilities of public services are spread over local (municipal), regional and national authorities, with different methods according to the institutional models of each region (Gabriele et al., 2014). This fragmentation relates to the fact that the LTC sector originates from multiple legislative interventions over a period of more than 30 years. Unpaid carers as well as care assistants privately hired by households, represent the bulk of LTC provision (Fosti et al., 2021). There is no official data on the number of unpaid family carers, but estimates from 2018 suggest that about 2.8 million people aged 18-64 were involved in caregiving for their older or disabled relatives (ISTAT, 2019). Also the total number of home care assistants (privately employed, primarily migrant care workers) is unknown, but it has been estimated that this involves over 1 million people (Fosti et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n\nBarbarella F, Casanova G, Chiatti C and Laura G (2018), ‘Italy: emerging policy developments in the long-term care sector’.

An article that set out to map long-term care in Jamaica found that care is largely provided by informal carers (both unpaid and paid). There is a high prevalence of unregulated care homes and limited formal home and community-based services. NGOs and places of worship are an important part of the few community-based services available (Goviat et al., 2021).\n\nReferences:\n\nGovia I, Robinson JN, Amour R, Stubbs M, Lorenz-Dant K, Comas-Herrera A, Knapp M.

Japan’s LTCI—which is administered by municipal governments—is operated independently of the medical insurance system and subsidizes non-medical benefits-in-kind including residential (long-term and short-term) day care services and home care services, as well as the cost of home adjustments to enable older citizens to live in their homes safely. When an insured person requires services, the municipal government evaluates and determines the level of care to be covered by LTCI. Insured persons then contract any service provider of choice within the municipality and pay a 10% co-payment. The remaining 90% of the service cost is reimbursed directly to the service providers by the municipal LTCI (Estévez-Abe and Ide 2021a).\n\nThe Japanese publicly-funded LTC system consists of residential and non-residential care sectors. The Japanese LTCI subsidizes day care services and home care services in addition to residential care services. Unlike many European countries, the Japanese LTC system does not offer cash benefits to people in need of care (Estévez-Abe and Ide, 2021b). Families do not receive any compensation for providing care and support to their relatives and there is almost no reliance on informal paid care by natives or migrants (Estévez-Abe and Caponio 2022).\n\nResidential LTC facilities are broadly divided into quasi-public facilities and for-profit facilities. The LTCI subsidizes the cost of care provided in all quasi-public facilities and a sub-section of for-profit facilities (Estévez-Abe and Ide 2021a, 2021b). The quasi-public facilities include: (i) Special nursing homes; (ii) Long-term care health facilities; (iii) LTC medical facilities; (iv) Sanatorium medical facilities; (v) Social welfare facilities for older citizens. The first category of facilities provides non-medical nursing care for older people who require highest level of LTC. The second category are facilities that provide nursing care to older people who are undergoing rehabilitation with the goal of returning home. Although the official goal is that patients do not stay in these facilities for more than 3 months, many of them stay for more than 6 months. The third and fourth categories are hospitals for elderly patients requiring nursing care in addition to medical care. (The third category will be phased out and integrated into the fourth type.) The fifth category are residential social welfare facilities for older people who find it difficult to live at home due to non-age-related disabilities, lack of economic means and/or family support. Traditionally, the non-profit sector has dominated this particular LTC sector because of the quasi-public nature of the services.\n\nThe LTCI only subsidizes the cost of care provided in for-profit facilities that are specifically licensed by municipal governments (Estévez-Abe and Ide 2021a). In light of its rapidly aging population, the Japanese government is giving financial incentives to for-profit eldercare facilities to convert to proper nursing homes (Aramaki 2020).\n\nUsing the data presented in Estévez-Abe and Ide (2021a) and the population data from the Japanese government (Stat.go.jp) we can estimate that there were roughly 26 LTC beds for every 1,000 people aged 65 and older in 2017 when we adopt the narrowest definition of LTCF—that is, excluding the second and third categories mentioned earlier (OECD estimates it to be 24.1, see OECD 2019 Figure11.26). When we include all five categories of LTCFs, the number of beds increases to 38. When we further include the number of beds in for-profit eldercare homes not licensed to provide nursing care, the number goes up to 57.\n\nIn Japan, the non-residential care sector is significantly bigger than the residential sector. In 2014, 7.8% of those aged 65 or older used day care in Japan. According to Maeda (2020), 4 million older persons used day care facilities in 2019. This roughly translates to 11% of the population aged 65 and older.\n\nReferences:\n\nAramaki, Seiya. 2020. “The content of the latest revision of fee schedule for for-profit nursing homes.” https://kaigo.jp/column/entry/497/ accessed on March 16, 2022.\n\nEstévez-Abe M and Hiroo I (2021a) “COVID-19 and Long-Term Care Policy for Older People in Japan,” Journal of Aging & Social Policy, 33:4-5, 444-458, DOI: 10.1080/08959420.2021.1924342\n\nEstévez-Abe, Margarita and Hiroo Ide.

In 2015, the 15-state financed social care institutions provided LTC social services for 5,353 clients; 86 local government and other organization social care centres provided LTC social services for 6,134 clients. Additionally, there were 83 such institutions in the country provided by local government in 2010, and the number increased to 86 institutions by 2015 (Calite-Bordane, 2017).\n\nReferences:\n\nCalite-Bordane, D.

In the case of Public Private Partnership (PPP) agreements for private and church-run insitutions, 3 separate admission/assessement/care criteria and contractual obligations are therefore employed in lieu of the differing Ministries. The Ministry for Health is responsible for offering services to circa 314 older persons through the PPP scheme; the Ministry for Senior Citizens and Active Ageing offers a service to approximately 3148 older persons through state run and private and church-run care homes employing the PPP agreement; and the Ministry of Gozo provides a service to around 53 older persons, through the PPP scheme, within a church-run care home, (source: https://ltccovid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LTC-covid-situation-in-Malta-6-June-2020.pdf).\n\nNo information is available on the websites for the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Gozo in respect of the eligibility criteria, assessment, successive admission of older persons to the long-term care sector, as well as to contractual obligations for the service user and service provider, with no reference to service delivery within care homes, (source: https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20of%20Malta/Ministries%20and%20Entities/Pages/Ministries%202020/health.aspx), (source: https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20of%20Malta/Ministries%20and%20Entities/Pages/Ministries%20Nov%202020/Gozo.aspx).\n\nThe Ministry for Senior Citizens and Active Ageing, through the Active Ageing and Community Care (AACC), is responsible for the state run homes and other care homes employing the PPP scheme, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/active-ageing-and-community-care/?lang=en). Service delivery within the long-term care sector at AACC, is mainly centred around the levels of care the older person would be in need of as of the time of assessment, as follows, (a) Level 1 care, where long-term care services with only minimal basic care is provided and (b) Level2 care, where the level of care required for the older person and as indicated by the Interdisciplinary Assessment Team goes beyond the minimal basic care, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LN-151-2018.pdf).\n\nOlder persons, (a) over the age of 60 years, (b) live with dementia, (c) require long-term care, and (d) can no longer live within their own home environment are eligible to apply for the state run (and PPP) long-term care services, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/residential-care/?lang=en).\n\nOnce an application for long-term care is compiled by the older person and/or next of kin/guardian, the Multidisciplinary Team, analyses aspects of the older person’s (a) Medical Report that would have been filled by the General Practioner, (b) social and wel-being, (c) cognitive difficulties, (d) mobility and dependency levels and (e) support network, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/residential-care/?lang=en). Through this assessment, the Team decides on the level of care required, considering also the priority and urgency of the case in respect of the admission to long-term care, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/residential-care/?lang=en).\n\nSaint Vincent de Paul (SVP) long term-care facility is on other state facility falling within the remit of the Ministry for Senior Citizens and Active Ageing, but autonmous from the AACC mentioned earlier, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/st-vincent-de-paul-long-term-care-facility/?lang=en). With a population of circa 1500 older persons, SVP offers high dependency chronic care services for the older person, through the Level 2 care tier referred to previously, (source: https://activeageing.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LN-151-2018.pdf), (source: https://ltccovid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LTC-covid-situation-in-Malta-6-June-2020.pdf).\n\nThe Maltese long-term care system also offers private self-funded care by the older person herself/himself through a number of private run organisations, (source: https://www.caremalta.com/our-homes/), (source: https://simblijacarehome.com/why-simblija/), (source: https://casa-antonia.com.mt/), (source: https://goldencare.com.mt/). These care homes advertise service provision to ‘patients’ falling within the medium to high dependency category, as well as older persons requiring respite care, or to older persons needing help to perform normal activities of daily living because of cognitive difficulties or loss of muscular strength or control).\n\nA number of small church-run institutions for older priests and religious (around 9, source: https://ltccovid.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/LTC-covid-situation-in-Malta-6-June-2020.pdf ) are scattered across both islands of Malta and Gozo. No information on the Archidiocese of Malta or the Diocese of Gozo websites is available in respect of assessment and admission criteria or to the level of care offered to the older priests and religious.\n\nNetherlands\n\nSince 2015, LTC is governed through three separate legal acts: the Long-term Care Act (WLZ 2014), the Social Support Act (WMO 2015) and the Health Expenses Act (Zvw 2008). As a result, there are different rules and funding streams for care-related (LTC insurance), social support related (municipalities) and health and nursing related (health insurance) services. LTC is needs assessed, access to institutional care is not means-tested, however residents have to contribute to their board and lodging- co-payments depend on their income (Bruquetas-Callejo and Böcker, 2021).\n\nReferences:\n\nBruquetas-Callejo, M., Böcker, A.

Some home care as well as residential care services are however also available through health and social care sector and more recently day care centres have gained prominence in providing support for people with LTC needs (Golinowska et al. 2017).\n\nThe rate of long-term care beds in Poland is low, even though it has increased from 65 877 in 2011 to 76 090 in 2019 (source: Statista: Poland long-term care beds). There geographical distribution is uneven: in 2019, nearly one-fifth of counties had no access to long-term residential care. About 2.7 % of older people are in institutional care settings and 3.4 % use home care services. Some families draw on migrant carers, mostly from Ukraine, who tend to provide round-the-clock care (source: 2021: Ageing policies – access to services in different EU Member States).\n\nReferences:\n\nGolinowska, S., Sowa-Kofta, A.

There are concerns that the current system leads to over-institutionalisation and duplication of provision and that not enough support is in place for unpaid carers.\n\nReferences:\n\nLopes, S., Mateus, C. & Hernandez-Quevedo, C.

The LTCI covers residential, domiciliary and community-based care. By the end of 2018, approximately 9% of the population aged 65 and older were eligible for LCTI coverage (source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01634372.2020.1797977).\n\nA shortage of qualified home-based care services in South Korea means that most older people have no choice but to depend heavily on residential institutional care. From 2012 to 2017, the number of long-term residential care facility beds per thousand people aged 65 years old and over significantly increased from 51.1 to 60.9, and the number of beds in long-term care hospitals was 36.7 per thousand people, the highest among OECD countries (source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01634372.2020.1797977).\n\nLong-term care hospitals (LTCHs) under the national health insurance play a role in long-term care provision; the average length of stay at such hospitals was about 168 days per year in 2016 Lengthy hospitalizations are likely a result of residential institutional care being financially supported by the national health insurance (NHI) and Long-Term Care Insurance (LTCI) (source: The-Long-Term-Care-COVID19-situation-in-South-Korea-7-May-2020.pdf).\n\nRomania\n\nThe Romanian long-term care system is rooted in Law 17/2000 on Social Assistance for Older People, the first national legal act to regulate the provision of support services for older individuals with care needs. Subsequent legislation in 2003 and 2006 defined basic organization and functioning norms for home-based and residential care delivery at national level. In 2011, Law 292/2011 on the Social Assistance Framework defined the characteristics and the boundaries of Romania’s long-term care system, establishing eligibility criteria, the settings in which long-term care can be provided and the care services included in the service package. Since 2006, responsibilities for social service planning, financing and provision were transferred to local authorities, lead to increased fragmentation in care delivery and to large disparities in the geographical distribution and availability of services.\n\nThe Romanian LTC system emphasizes cash benefits to the detriment of service provision, which remain severely undersized with respect to care needs and distributed across the territory. Particularly weak is the provision of home and community based care, leading to increased demand for residential care services, in turn insufficiently developed to appropriately respond to population needs. As a result, the long-term care system overwhelmingly relies on the provision of care by family member and other informal caregivers.\n\nWhile data on LTC coverage are insufficient and of poor quality, available evidence indicates long-term care coverage to be very low with respect to most European countries.\n\nReferences:\n\nWorld Health Organization (2020) Romania.

The approach is nested with an overarching Action Plan for Successful Ageing, as part of a policy shift towards a population health approach.\n\nSingapore’s LTC policies are based on the principle of ‘Many helping hands’ that calls for individuals, families, communities, civil society, the private sector, and government to all play a role in ensuring the wellbeing of older people.\n\nThe system is designed with the aims of maximising prevention, promoting individual and family responsibility and reduce inefficiencies, with LTC as part of a wider integrated system covering public health, primary care, acute care, rehabilitation and long-term and palliative care.\n\nSources:\n\nAsian Development Bank (2021) Singapore’s Long-Term Care System. Adapting to Population Ageing.\n\nSpain\n\nAccording to the Spanish Constitution, responsibility for Long-Term Care in Spain is mainly at the regional level (Autonomous Communities), although provincial and local authorities also have a role in care provision. Each autonomous community has legislated and designed its own care and social services systems.\n\nThe 2006 ‘Dependency Act’ (law 39/2006) aimed to create new public national care coverage as the ‘fourth pillar of the welfare state’. The Act aims to guarantee the rights of citizens to personal autonomy and care to people in a situation of dependency, through the creation of the System for Autonomy and Dependency Care (SAAD). This is carried out with the collaboration and participation of all public administrations, and the central government guarantees minimum common rights for all citizens in any part of the territory of the Spanish State.\n\nThe Act established two types of long-term care benefits: 1) in-kind services, and 2) economic benefits, and gives priority to the former. All benefits and services established in the law are integrated into the social services provided through the autonomous regions (Guillen et al. 2017).\n\nThe catalogue of services and economic benefits of the Law is as follows:\n\nServices :\n\na) Services for the prevention of situations of dependency and those for the promotion of personal autonomy .\n\nb) Telecare Service.\n\nc) Home Help Service (help with home tasks and personal care);:\n\nAttention to the needs of the home.\n\nPersonal care.\n\nd) Day and Night Centre Service :\n\nDay Centres for the older people.\n\nDay Centres for those under 65 years of age .\n\nSpecialized Day Care Centres.\n\nNight Centres.\n\ne) Residential Care Service :\n\nResidential care for the older people in a situation of dependency .\n\nCare centres for people in a situation of dependency, due to the different types of disability.\n\nEconomic benefits :\n\na) Cash benefits linked to the service.\n\nb) Economic provision of personal assistance.\n\nc) Cash benefits for care in the family environment.\n\nThe economic services and benefits that the autonomous communities may recognize for people in a situation of dependency in their territory, are integrated into the network of social services of each autonomous community.\n\nReferences:\n\nMontserrat Guillen, Ramon Alemany, Manuela Alcañiz, Mercedes Ayuso, Catalina Bolancé, Helena Chuliá, Ana M.

Home and community-based care services that support aging in place for elders with limitations in\n\nADL and IADL are rare; residential care is not appropriate in terms of available services or eligibility. Informal care at home is often provided by family members, usually, a female relative. Untrained domestic workers are sometimes hired as caregivers.\n\nSweden\n\nIn 2019, over 160 000 of older people were provided with services and care in their own home and around 82 000 were provided with institutional care. A wave of closures of municipal institutional beds since the 2000s has resulted in a reduction of nearly 40% of all municipal places (source: Johansson and Schön, 2021).\n\nReferences:\n\nJohansson L. and Schön, P.

Although a social insurance system was planned, public LTC in Taiwan is funded through taxes. In 2017 the government launched LTC 2.0, a new policy aiming to develop a universal LTC system with an emphasis on home and community-based care and better integrated with the health care system, particularly with primary preventive care and home-based hospital care following hospital discharge (Hsu and Chen, 2019).\n\nReferences:\n\nHsu HC and Chen CF (2019) LTC 2.0: The 2017 reform of home- and community-based long-term care in Taiwan.

Until recently, long-term care infrastructure has been scarce; Turkey has a familialist welfare system with the majority of the elderly population being taken care of by their families (in particular, by female family members) (Oglak et al., 2017). In fact, the Turkish Civil Code involves intergenerational obligations for family members to look after dependents. However, to some extent this system is beginning to erode, and as such that has been an expansion of LTC services in the past two decades. (Akkan & Canbazer, 2020).\n\nA fraction of older people in Turley (0.4%) live in care homes. Of these, 61% are in public nursing homes and the remainder in private ones. Private entities were only allowed to open nursing homes from 2008, but since then the sector has been rapidly expanding. In 2020, 247 of the 426 nursing homes were private, and 179 public. Apart from these care homes, the state also provides community-based care facilities, care and rehabilitation centres (which may also be run by private entities), and day-centres (Akkan & Canbazer, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nAkkan, B.

Formal long-term care in England is provided by a complex system involving organisations in charge of health, social care, housing and other services. There is an important distinction between means-tested social care (non-medical services aimed at supporting people with LTC needs with their daily living activities) and health care services, which are free at the point of use and funded from general taxation.\n\nFormal care services include home-based care services, personal assistants, residential/institutional care, day care and professional services such as social work, occupational therapy and aids and adaptations. Most publicly funded services are commissioned at local level, but, as a large share of the population who use long-term care is not covered by the public system, a large share of care is purchased directly from private providers.\n\nThere is strong consensus on the urgent need to reform the social care system in England.\n\nReferences:\n\nComas-Herrera, A., Glanz, A., Curry, N., Deeny, S., Hatton, C., Hemmings, N., Humphries, R., Lorenz-Dant, K., Oung, C., Rajan, S., Suarez-Gonzalez, A.

The Health Foundation, the Institute for Fiscal Studies, The King’s Fund and the Nuffield Trust\n\nScotland (UK)\n\nIn Scotland, Long-Term Care is known as social care. This care can take the form of care services delivered in a person’s own home, for example personal care support and meals services, or care provided in the community, for example day care and social work support, to care provided within a care home. Public Health Scotland estimated that in the financial year 2018/19, at least 245,650 people of all ages received social care services. Of those, over 77% were aged 65 and over.\n\nData from the Care Inspectorate Scotland show that at 31st March 2020 there were 1,083 registered adult care homes in Scotland, of which 817 catered for older people. Public Health Scotland (formerly Information Services Division Scotland) data from the Scottish Adult Care Home Census show that in 2017, there were 40,926 registered care home places for adults. This figure has decreased from 42,653 in 2007. Over the period 2007-2017, the number of registered places for older people has remained relatively stable at around 38,200 throughout the period. The pandemic has highlighted the data deficiencies within the care home sector The latest data available for Scotland from a report by Public Health Scotland show that in March 2017 there were 35,989 adult care home residents in Scotland (Source: Care Home Census for Adults in Scotland).\n\nFor the last two decades, Scottish policy has favoured care provision in individuals’ own homes rather than in care homes. According to the Care Inspectorate data as of 31st March 2019, there were 1,046 registered adult care at home providers in Scotland. A Public Health Scotland report on social care statistics in Scotland estimated that 91,810 people in Scotland received home care for all or some of the year ending 31 March 2019. The same report estimated that at the end of that period, 63% of adults with long-term care needs received personal care at home. Personal care is care associated with personal hygiene, feeding, toileting and appearance. In 2017-18, 47,070 people aged 65+ were receiving personal care funded by the Scottish Government in their own homes (An Official Statistics publication for Scotland).\n\nUnited States\n\nIn the United States, there are five major types of LTC services: adult day centre, home health agencies, nursing homes, hospices, and residential living facilities. As of 2016, there were approximately 15,300 nursing homes and 28,900 residential care (‘assisted living’) facilities. Approximately 24 in every 1,000 people aged 65+ use nursing homes, and 15 in every 1,000 people aged 65+ live in residential care. 75 in every 1000 people aged 65+ use home health agencies for at-home services (source: Vital and Health Statistics).\n\nVietnam\n\nThe rapidly growing ageing population in Vietnam poses a significant challenge to the social welfare system. There is particular concern about the high prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are the dominant cause of death, in the over-50 population (source: Global Burden of Diseases Project).\n\nThere is currently no legal policy on long-term care. Some policies relating to older people have been enacted; mostly relating to their healthcare. For example, The Elderly Law (2009), which emphasises the role of primary healthcare and access to quality healthcare services for these members of the population. It also highlights the role and responsibility of families, communities, and broader society in caring for elderly people (Van et al., 2021). Indeed, most senior citizens in Vietnam live with and are cared for by their families; hence the common phrase, tu dai dong duong (four generations under one roof).\n\nHowever, some people have complex needs that require support beyond what family members can provide, or indeed do not have families to provide such long-term care (in part due to children modernising and moving to cities for work). There are some institutions that are run by the government that cater for the elderly, the disabled, and orphans – such as social protection centres. However, these are only available to social assistance beneficiaries; for the elderly, this covers people over age 85 without social insurance or pension, and lonely or poor older people (Dung et al., 2020). According to a recent report by The Vietnam National Committee on Aging (VNCA), only around 10,000 elderly people in Vietnam live in public social protection centres (out of approximately 11 million older persons nationwide). This means that there is great demand for private institutional care.\n\nIndeed, there are some long-term care facilities provided by the private sector and by mass organisations, such as The Red Cross (the latter being run by volunteers). Religious groups also provide some nursing homes – which are free of charge to those in need. Privately run nursing homes are mainly aimed at wealthier members of the population who are able to afford the steep $400-$1000/month fee (VNCA). It should also be noted that the supply of private nursing homes in Vietnam is expanding relatively slowly, as loans for construction are difficult to obtain and there are no incentives (tax concessions) provided for setting them up (Dung et al., 2020).\n\nThere are significant gaps in the provision of care in Vietnam: nursing homes are mainly found in larger cities, there are a limited number of social protection centres (which are inefficient and do not satisfy all needs), and, in light of a limited government budget, high co-payments are mostly out of pocket (Van et al., 2021).\n\nCare Preferences\n\nIn their 2012 study, Van Hoi et al assessed willingness to use and pay for different models of care for community-dwelling elderly in rural Vietnam. They found the most requested service was use of mobile team care, and that using a nursing centre was intended by the fewest respondents, although households were found to be more willing to pay for elderly day care and nursing centres than older participants. Willingness to use services decreased as potential fees rose.\n\nReferences:\n\nDung, V., Thi Mai Lan, N., Thu Trang, V., Xuan Cu, T., Minh Thien, L., Sy Thu, N., Dinh Man, P., Minh Long, D., Trong Ngo, P., & Minh Nguyet, L.

The latter number is expected to grow to 1.5 billion by 2050, when older people would represent 16% of the global population. The number of people aged 80 and over is expected to grow from 143 million in 2019, to 426.4 in 2050, with the largest increases projected for Northern Africa, and Western Asia (source: UN: World Population Ageing).\n\nPopulation ageing and LTC demand\n\nIn the absence of global estimates on the numbers of people who receive care from others and are supported by LTC services, increases in the numbers of older people are often used to approximate expected increases in need for care. This is because, while there are many reasons why people rely on care and support that are not linked to age, as people reach older ages, they are more likely to need some support from others in their daily lives.\n\nMoreover, despite some evidence of compression of disability at old ages, the review of evidence on whether increasing life expectancies in Europe translate into more years lived in better or worse health, showed mixed results, with considerable differences between countries (Rechel et al. 2020). Consequently, as the proportion and total number of older people increases, health and care systems in many countries are expected to face increased demand for care and support (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation; 2021 Long-term care in the EU).\n\nReferences:\n\nRechel, R.

In 2019, 15.9% of Australia’s population were over the age of 65 and 2% of the population is over the age of 85. Australians are living longer than ever before. The number of Australians aged 85 years and over is expected to increase from 515,700 in 2018–2019 to more than 1.5 million by 2058 (sources: Statista; Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety).\n\nAustria\n\nIn 2016 Austria had a population of 8.6 million, of whom 0.81 million required help from others to carry out activities of daily life (European Commission, 2019). Furthermore, 18.2% of the Austrian population (1.5 million people) are aged 65 years and older, with demographic ageing being observed particularly in rural areas. Approximately 20% of Austrians with LTC needs live in one of the 930 care homes. These homes, on average, can house about 80 people (Leichsenring et al. 2021).\n\nReferences:\n\nEuropean Commission (2019) Joint Report on Health Care and Long-Term Care Systems & Fiscal Sustainability, Retrieved from: Country Documents 2019 Update (europa.eu)\n\nLeichsenring, K., Schmidt, A.E., Staflinger, H.

There are 948,062 people over the age of 65 and 118,479 people over the age of 85 (source: https://bcstats.shinyapps.io/popApp/).\n\nChile\n\nIn 2017 there were nearly 3,500,000 people aged 60 or over in Chile, of whom 14.2% (489,000) had some degree of functional dependency (Browne et al., 2020).\n\nReferences\n\nBrowne J, Fasce G, Pineda I, Villalobos P (2020) Policy responses to COVID-19 in Long-Term Care facilities in Chile.

The total increase this year was 7.8 thousand inhabitants, the lowest in the last decade, while the decrease was 19.1 thousand, which was the largest in the last 100 years.\n\nThe population in the three main age groups in 2020 developed in the same direction as in previous years. The child population (0–14 years) grew by 9.5 thousand persons to 1.72 million year-on-year and thus represented 16.1% of the total population. The number of older people (aged 65 and above), which has been growing since the mid-1980s, has grown by a further 26.7 thousand to 2.16 million, and for the first time in its history its share in the population has exceeded 20% of the total residents. The increase in the share of people aged 65+ in the population of the Czech Republic was due to strong vintages – people born in the second half of the 1940s, and a long-term increase in life expectancy. However, for both children and seniors, the growth rate in 2020 was the lowest in the last ten years. The number of people of working age (15–64 years) has a declining trend in the last twelve years, in 2020 it decreased by 28.4 thousand to 6.82 million people, which was 63.8% of the total population.\n\nFrom 2011 to the end of 2020, the average age of the Czech population increased by less than two years to 42.6 years. The index of economic dependence, which indicates the number of persons in the non-productive age (0–19 years and 65+ years) per 100 persons in the economically productive age (20–64 years), increased from 55 to 69 in the given period.\n\nIn 2020, mortality was fundamentally affected by the epidemic situation associated with the occurrence of covid-19. During the year, almost 129.3 thousand people died, which was 15.1% more than in 2019, while in previous years the annual declines were below 3.5%. The greatest impact of the epidemic in 2020 was observed in the age groups 75-79 and 80-84, where the number of deaths increased by more than one-fifth year-on-year – in each group by more than 3,000, and in the highest group 100+ there was an increase of two-fifths .\n\nIn 2020, diseases of the circulatory system caused the deaths of 36.5% of all men who died and 43.1% of women who died, their lower proportion being affected by the fact that a large proportion of the total number of deaths were attributed to covid-19. The second place in men and women has long been occupied by neoplasms, whose share in the total number of deaths has been relatively stable in the last decade at around 28% for men and 23% for women. In third place was placed in 2020 by a group called “Codes for special purposes”, which was filled in the Czech Republic only by covid-19. A total of 10,539 people died of the disease (8.2% of all deaths), of which 5,938 were men (8.9% of all men who died) and 4,601 women (7.3% of women who died). The fourth most common cause of death (with a share of 7.0% in men and 5.8% in women) in 2020 was respiratory diseases. Fifth, endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, which make up more than four-fifths of diabetes mellitus, ranked fifth overall. Other causes include external causes – injuries, traffic accidents, diseases of the digestive and nervous systems (Source: https://www.czso.cz/csu/czso/aktualni-populacni-vyvoj-v-kostce).\n\nDenmark\n\nIn 2021, Denmark had a population of just under 6 million; 19.4% of the population were over 65, with 4.1% over 80 and 1.9% over 85 (source: https://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik). These numbers are expected to rise significantly, and according to calculations from Statistics Denmark, by 2053, 10% of the population will be over 80 (source: https://www.sst.dk/da/viden/aeldre). The ageing of the population has been driven by increases in life expectancy which has otherwise been low in comparison to other Nordic countries. In 2021, women could expect to live until the age of 83 years and men until 80 (source: https://www.dst.dk/en/Statistik/emner/borgere/befolkning/middellevetid).\n\nFinland\n\nThe current population of Finland is 5,546,270. As of 2019, the number of people aged 70 and over was 874,314. Finland is a rapidly aging country, with the number of people over 70 growing by 100,000 in just three years (source: https://findikaattori.fi/en/14).\n\nFrance\n\nFrance has a population of 67.1 million (2018). In 2018 19.6% of the population were aged 65 years and older (13.1 million people) (source: Statistics France).\n\nGermany\n\nGeneral population\n\nBy the end of 2021, Germany had a population of 83.2 million (Destatis, 2022).\n\nPopulation 65 years and above\n\nIn 2018, 22% of the population (17.9 million people) were aged 65 years and older (Lorenz-Dant, 2020). Furthermore, population age is not distributed evenly across the country. In 2017, the share of population in the age of 65 years and older was higher in the Länder of eastern Germany (24%) than western Germany (21%) (Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung, 2021).\n\nPeople with long-term care needs\n\nAccording to the German Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), in 2019 there were 4.1 million people with long-term care needs, 62% women (Destatis, 2020) . Given the uneven distribution of older people across the country outlined above, a difference can also be observed between the share of people living in residential care. Out of 100,000 residents living in the eastern states, there are 488,2 persons in need of long-term care compared to 394,0 in the western states (Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung, 2021).\n\nReferences\n\nBundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (2021) INKAR – Indikatoren und Karten zur Raum- und Stadtentwicklung.

For those 75 years and older, the percentage jumps to more than 65% (source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513388).\n\nIsrael\n\nIn 2015, the total population of Israel was 8.46 million, of whom 939,000-11%- were aged 65 and over. One in four households in the country included a person aged 65 or more (source: Brookdale Report).\n\nItaly\n\nIn 2020, 23.2 % of the total population in Italy was 65 years and older, the share of older people in the Italian society has been growing constantly in recent years. According to 2019 data, the country was considered to have the largest percentage of elderly population in Europe. This share is projected to rise up to 34% by 2045.\n\nIn 2019, 32.5% of people aged 65 and above reported living with chronic diseases, rising up to 47.7% among those abed 85 and over. 1 million persons aged 65+ require care or support devices.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has one of the largest populations of older adults in the world. In 2020, 28.4% of the population was over the age of 65 (source: https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/handbook/pdf/2020all.pdf#page=23).\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe population of Malaysia is roughly 32.4 million (World Bank). Since 2014, the share of the population over age 65 has been increasing; it went from 5.6% in 2014 to 7% in 2020. Malaysia therefore faces the prospect of an aging population; this may happen by 2030 (Statista).\n\nThe National Policy Order for Older Persons (2011) defines an older person in Malaysia as someone aged 60 years or older (Hasmuk et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nHasmuk K, Sallehuddin H, Tan MP, Cheah WK, Rahimah I, Chai ST (2020) The Long-Term Care COVID-19 Situation in Malaysia available at LTCcovid.org, International Long-Term Care Policy Network, CPEC-LSE, 2 October 2020.\n\nMalta\n\nThere was a 0.3% increase in Malta’s population from 2019 to 2020; the estimated population of residents of Malta and Gozo standing at 516,100 at the end of 2020. People aged 65 and over amounted to 18.9% of the population, and 2,223 females and 984 males were aged 90 years and over. There was a 10.7% increase in the resident deaths in 2020 from 2019 largely, owing directly or indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, 4,084 resident deaths were registered, of these, 66% were people aged 75 or over, deaths among this group increased by 12.5% of deaths compared to 2019 (source: https://nso.gov.mt/en/News_Releases/Documents/2021/07/News2021_122.pdf).\n\nMalta, together with other Southern European, is part of the oldest region in the world where 21% of the population is aged 65 years and over (source: https://www.prb.org/resources/countries-with-the-oldest-populations-in-the-world/).\n\nMauritius\n\nThe Government of Mauritius foresees rising rates of dementia and disability and increased overall demand for long-term care. It is planning for a 52% increase in publicly funded residential bed capacity by 2030 (source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513388).\n\nNetherlands\n\nThe population of The Netherlands is around 17.4 million (source: World Bank) and the median age is 43.3 years (source: Worldometres).\n\nIn 2021, 20.5% of the total population of The Netherlands was over age 65 and just under 5% was over 80 (source: Statista).\n\nPakistan\n\nThe population of Pakistan is 220.9 million, making it the sixth most populous country in the world, although it is projected to become the third most populous country by 2050. Pakistan has a predominantly young population, but in line with global trends, the elderly population in Pakistan is rising. In 2020, the population over age 60 was 6.7 million people; this is expected to rise to 40.6 million by 2050 (United Nations). In part, this is due to increasing life expectancy in Pakistan (although this is still low by global standards) (The Global Economy).\n\nPakistan is a developing country, with significant economic difficulties, lack of a health insurance coverage system, and low levels of savings among older people. This poses real challenges for the elderly population. Retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women, although many do not stop working at this age. Due to frail provision of pensions, most people work until their final days, and/or rely on their next generation to provide for them during retirement (Jalal et al, 2014).\n\nReferences:\n\nJalal, S., Younis, M.Z. 2014.

This proportion is projected to almost 43% by 2060 (source: The-Long-Term-Care-COVID19-situation-in-South-Korea-7-May-2020.pdf).\n\nRomania\n\nThe total population of Romania in 2019 was 19.4 million inhabitants, registering a decline of 0.4 million with respect to 2015, as result of low natality and external migration.\n\nThe age structure of the Romanian population bears the characteristic marks of a rapid demographic ageing process. While the total population has declines over the past 5 years, the group aged 65 and over has increased by 225.2 thousand persons over the same period, to reach 19.7% of the total population in 2019.\n\nCurrent projections point to a continued decline over the next decades, with an expected total population of 17.7 million in 2030 and 15.5 million by 2050 (Source: Proiectarea populaiei României pe regiuni de dezvoltare i judee, la orizontul 2070).\n\nSingapore\n\nIn 2021 there are 5.4 million people living in Singapore, of whom 3.9 million are residents (comprising 3.5 million Singapore citizens and 488,700 permanent residents).\n\nSingapore’s population is ageing rapidly, in the population aged 65 and over was 639,000 (15.9%) out of its 4 million resident population. This is expected to rise to 23.8% of the population of residents by 2030.\n\nSources: Department of Statistics Singapore\n\nSlovakia\n\nIn 2021 Slovakia had population of 5.45 million people, of whom 17.1% were aged 65 and over. While in 2011, the pre-productive age population (0-14 years) had a higher share compared with the older population (65+ years), in 2021 it is the opposite. In 2021, compared to 2011, there was a slight increase in the share of the population in the pre-productive age (0-14 years) from 15.3 % to 15.9 %, but at the same time we can observe a significant increase in the population in older ages, whose share was 12.7 % in 2011 and increased to 17.1 % in 2021. The share of the working age population (15-64 years) decreased from 72.0 % in 2011 to 67,0 % in 2021. (Source: Slovak statistical office, 2021).\n\nSouth Africa\n\nIn South Africa, 35% of people between the ages of 65 years and 75 years require some assistance with daily activities. For those 75 years and older, the percentage increases to 45% (source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513388).\n\nSpain\n\nThe population in Spain, as in the rest of Western societies, is going through a marked and continuous process of ageing of its population, due to social, health and cultural factors. According to the latest data from the INE (Institute of National Statistics. Data provisional as of July 1, 2021), Spain has a total population of 47,326,687 people, of which 9,444,037 are aged 65 or older (which represents 19.95% of the total); with 1,597,298 people aged 85 or older (3.38%). In addition, this ageing is noticeable in women, who account for 56.48% of the total number of people aged 65 or over, and 65.79% of people aged 85 or over.\n\nIn addition, and in relation to the population at risk of relying upon care from others, it is estimated that there is a total of 6,044,675 people (that is, 12.77% of the total population) who can be considered as “potentially dependent” (based on factors such as age or recognized disability).\n\nOn the other hand, there is a gradual decrease in women of childbearing age and, if current demographic trends continue, the population loss in the next decade will be concentrated in the age groups of 30-49 years, with this group decreasing by 2.8 million (Martínez-Buján, et al, 2021).\n\nReferences\n\nMartínez-Buján, R.; Jabbaz, M. and Soronellas, M.

Like most European regions, Catalonia has an ageing population, with 18,9% of the population aged 65 or older, and 6% of the population aged 80 or older. These figures follow an increasing tendency over the last decades and are expected to continue to do so (22,3% of the population is expected to be aged 65 or older in 2030 according to mid-range scenario projections). (Source: https://www.idescat.cat/pub/?id=aec&n=253&t=2010)\n\nSri Lanka\n\nIn 2019, approximately 15.9% of the population of Sri Lanka was older than 60 years of age, with 9.2% aged 60–69 years, 5.1% aged 70–79 years, and 1.6% over 80 years of age. Projections suggest that these proportions will increase, more than doubling between 2030 and 2050; 60% will be women. This also represents a significant increase in absolute numbers. The “old-age dependency ratio” is projected to rise steadily, from 20% in 2015 to 43% in 2050 (source: Country Diagnostic Study on Long-Term Care in Sri Lanka (adb.org).\n\nSweden\n\nThe current population (2022) in Sweden is 10.3 million (source: World Bank). In 2019, 1% of the population were 90 years or older, 5.2% were 80 years or older, and 20% were 65 years and older (source: Statista). Like many other states globally, Sweden faces a rapidly ageing population. The share of the population aged 80 and over is projected to grow by the most (a 50% from 2018) by 2028 (source: Statistics Sweden). Life expectancy in Sweden is one of the highest in the world (source: Sweden.se).\n\nThailand\n\nThe Thai population was 69,625,582 in 2019, life expectancy at birth was 73.12 years for men and 80.62 years for women in 2019. The number of older persons is expected to increase from 11.3 million (16.7% of the Thai population) in 2017 to 22.9 million (33% of the Thai population) by 2040 (source: Country Diagnostic Study on Long-Term Care in Thailand (adb.org)).\n\nTurkey\n\nThe current population of Turkey is 84,339,067 (World Bank). Turkey still has a relatively young population, but the fertility rate has been steadily falling, while the percentage of the population over age 65 has been rising (Statista). The increasingly ageing population is resulting in swiftly increasing health expenditure and long-term care service needs (Oglak et al., 2017). The majority of the aging population is between ages 65 and 74 (Daily Sabah).\n\nReferences:\n\nOglak, S., Canatan, A., Tufan, I., Acar, S., & Avci, N. (2017).

The median population age in England was 40.2 years. The share of the population aged 65 years and over was 18.5% and the share aged 85 and over was 2.5% (Source: ONS).\n\nNorthern Ireland (UK)\n\nIn mid-2020 the total population in Northern Ireland was 1,896,000, which represents 2.8% of the total population of the United Kingdom. The median population age was 39.2. The share of the population aged 65 and more was 16.9% and share aged 85 and over was 2.1% (Source: Population estimates for the UK).\n\nScotland (UK)\n\nIn mid-2020, the total population of Scotland was 5,466,000, representing 8.1% of the total population of the United Kingdom. The media population age was 42.1 years. The share of population aged 65 or over was 19.3% and the share aged 85 or over was 2.3% (Source: ONS).\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe total population in the United Kingdom in mid-2020 was 67,081,000. The median population age is 40.4, with 18.6% aged 65 and over, and 2.5% 85 and over (Source: ONS: Population estimates for the UK).\n\nWales (UK)\n\nIn mid-2020 the total population of Wales was 3,170,000, which represents 4.7% of the total population in the United Kingdom. The median age of the population was 42.4. The share of the population aged 65 and over was 21.1% and the share aged 85 and over was 2.7 (Source: Population estimates for the UK).\n\nUnited States\n\nAs of 2019, approximately 16.5% of Americans were aged 65 and older, constituting more than 54 million people in a population of 320+ million (source: https://www.census.gov/topics/population/older-aging.html). Moreover, the number of people aged 65 and older is expected to double in the next 40 years (source: https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/us-population-aging).\n\nVietnam\n\nVietnam is a lower-middle income country in Southeast Asia with a population of just over 97 million people (source: World Bank). Since 1999, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over has been increasing, representing 7.9% of the total population by 2020 (source: World Bank). Meanwhile, the younger population (aged 14 and below) has been decreasing. These trends are predicted to persist (source: Vietnam Population Census); thus Vietnam is undergoing a demographic transition and is predicted to be an aging population by 2040 (source: United Nations). Vietnam is also one of the fastest aging countries globally (source: WHO). The growing elderly population in Vietnam poses a challenge to the social welfare system; the World Bank have therefore stressed the importance of developing relevant and timely health and social care solutions to ensure country capacity.\n\nPeople in Vietnam are considered who are 60 years and older are considered “elderly”. The majority (more than 70%) of older people live in rural areas. There are more females than males in the aging population in Vietnam; an imbalance which is also higher in rural than urban areas. A minority (5.8%) of older people live alone (with most of these individuals being women in rural areas), and few (11.5%) live only with a spouse. Most older people in Vietnam are household heads and live with a child. As such, children and grandchildren are the main caregivers (Van Hoi et al., 2012). More recently, however, increasing employment opportunities in urban centres have resulted in temporary migration of the younger generations, leaving the more elderly members of the population on their own and with less emotional and physical support from family (Van Hoi et al., 2012).\n\nReferences:\n\nVan Hoi, L., Thi Kim Tien, N., Van Tien, N., Van Dung, D., Thi Kim Chuc, N., Goran Sahlen, K., & Lindholm, L.

Strong governance in Long-Term Care requires that the roles and responsibilities of the actors and institutions involved are clear, that there are structures and mechanisms for coordination and engagement with stakeholders (Allen et al. 2011; ADB Briefs).\n\nNational governance arrangements\n\nSome countries have created specific agencies or ministries with responsibility for LTC to develop national policies and strategies to support the implementation of LTC laws and policies. This may be independent or based within a another ministry such as Ministry of Health (e.g. Singapore, Australia) or ministry of Labour and Social Policy (e.g. in Poland). In some countries several ministries are responsible for parts of LTC policies (e.g. Turkey). Whilst many strategies are developed at the national level, in some countries (e.g. Spain), they are developed from the subnational/municipal level and, in some cases, may be later pulled into a national policies. Moreover, LTC policies and strategies can be stand-alone or integrated into other policies. For example, in Japan, the policy framework for LTC is outlined in LTC insurance acts.\n\nIntegration\n\nLTC governance often involves a wide range of stakeholders, including national and regional across multiple sectors (e.g. health, public health and social care, housing, transport etc). Coordination between different stakeholders at different levels is key to effective governance, although most LTC systems are poorly coordinated (see Section 1.06 for more details on care coordination). In fact the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that fragmented responsibilities for long-term care in most countries resulted in difficulties in the adoption and implementation of measures to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic.\n\nReferences:\n\nAllen K et al.

Country profiles Publications Office of the EU (europa.eu)\n\nAfrican Union\n\nThe Executive Council of the African Union recently adopted a Common African Position on Long-Term Care Systems for Africa. Despite this progress, few regional or national frameworks exist to guide more specific action. Focused debate has been largely absent, reflecting the low policy and political priority accorded to long-term care, combined with a belief that the issue has little impact on economic development. With the exception of a few countries, little organized service capacity or national coordination exists. Rather, the provision of long-term care rests overwhelmingly with family members, which is fuelled by a belief among some that western models of organized long-term care pose a threat to African values (source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513388).\n\nThe African Union has drafted several policy frameworks relevant to long-term care. These include the AU Policy Framework and Plan of Action on Ageing; the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Older Persons in Africa; and the Common African Position on Long-term Care Systems for Africa. At the national level, several countries including Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Uganda, and the United Republic of Tanzania have adopted consistent overarching ageing policies or national legislation relevant to older people, such as the Older Persons Acts of South Africa and Zimbabwe. However, with few exceptions, national policies and legislation overlook significant aspects of sustainable systems of long-term care. In general, they do not provide a framework or roadmap for integrating long-term care across a range of settings and often do not examine the cultural norms and expectations inherent in substantial family involvement in long-term care provision. In addition, they do not specify mechanisms for preparing and supporting caregivers and rarely specify how to ensure a sustainable financing mechanism and workforce supply as the older population grows. Few of the frameworks address how to improve access and affordability for poor and marginalized groups (source: https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241513388).\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralia is a federation and LTC is primarily the responsibility of the federal (Commonwealth) government which sets LTC policy, provides funding, oversights quality standards etc. Within the states, while funded by the Commonwealth and having to comply with Commonwealth standards, there are some nursing homes run by state governments (e.g. Victoria runs 178 nursing homes) and some home care is provided by local government (e.g. in Victoria).\n\nThere is central oversight from the Australian government, as it is responsible for regulating and funding the majority of aged care services. However, state and territorial governments also have jurisdiction over the provision of aged care, which increases the complexity of the system and leads to a division of power.\n\nThe Australian Department of Health is responsible for the development and implementation of aged care policy, including advising the Australian Government, funding, and administration. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is responsible for aged care regulation. State and Territory Governments, along with the private sector, are responsible for the delivery and management of health care, including aged care.\n\nThe Australian government’s Department of Health created the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety in 2018 to evaluate the current Aged Care sector and to provide recommendations for reform. A group of experts in this commission have identified several weaknesses of the sector and have issued their final report (Royal Commission, 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nRoyal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety (2020) Aged care and COVID-19: a special report. Commonwealth of Australia. https://agedcare.royalcommission.gov.au/sites/default/files/2020-12/aged-care-and-covid-19-a-special-report.pdf\n\nAustria\n\nGovernance of LTC system in Austria is relatively fragmented, in that the responsibility is divided amongst the federal government and the federal states in several ways. The federal government is in charge of the care allowance benefit, while the regional governments are responsible for the provision of care services (Fink, 2018). These responsibilities by the federal states include providing LTC services (i.e. in-kind benefits), planning the number of beds/spots for care, and regulating tariffs and subsidies. In terms of home care services, the federal states are responsible for regulating the framework conditions as it relates to funding, collective bargaining agreements for services and out-of-pocket payments by users. Although the federal states are responsible by law for the provision of long-term care services for older adults in Austria, in practice, the responsibility for carrying out these services is shared with several entities, such as the municipalities, non-profit organisations and private operators (Rechnungshof Österreich, 2020).\n\nReferences\n\nFink, M.
