        "text": "Elizabeth Anna Harper, 97 years old, passed to her eternal life on Monday, February 19, 2024, in Lubbock, Texas.\n\nElizabeth was born September 22, 1926, at home in Graslitz, Czechoslovakia. Her mother, Anna Fischer Spinnler and her father, Franz Wenzel Spinnler, and her sister Marie Spinnler precede her in death.\n\nElizabeth went to school until the age of twelve when in 1938 Czechoslovakia was invaded by the Germans. Elizabeth was in school when there was a commotion outside and all the kids went to the window and there was Hitler driving by in his convertible with his arm raised in salute. She said this is something that she would never forget.\n\nDuring the war Elizabeth was forced to work in an ammunition factory and a farm. She said it was a hard time for young and old people, especially because there was little food. In Bernstein a. Wald she worked on a farm for six months and then she was transferred to Nuremberg to work in the ammunition factory for another six months. There she lived in barracks and got used to running to bomb shelters when they heard the American planes overhead and the sirens. She and most of the girls took off from there escaping however they could, by bus, train, or whatever they could get into and got back to Graslitz.\n\nIn 1945 when the war was over the German Red Cross helped her father find her and her family. They ended up working on a farm in the American sector in Bavaria. This is where she met and married her first husband, Sammuel Juan Alvarado who was an M.P in the United States Airforce. They had two sons Sammuel Karl Alvarado, born in Freising Germany in 1947, and Helmuth Wenzel Alvarado, born at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas in 1952. During this time Elizabeth lived with her mother-in-law as Sam was fighting in the Korean war. This is when she learned her second language, Spanish. Sadly, Sam was killed in service and Elizabeth became a widow.\n\nElizabeth had a love for life, meeting new people and socializing. Whether dancing, playing games, or listening to music, she loved to have fun. It was in El Paso in 1956 while at the NCO Club playing Bingo with Oma Lupe, Liz met David Harper. And on July 1, 1957, they were married.\n\nDave and Liz were stationed all over and gave birth to their other three children while serving. William Edward Harper born in Munich Germany in 1960, Micheal Jospeh Harper in 1961 in Columbia, South Carolina, and Deborah Ann Harper in 1962 in Columbus, Georgia. In 1969 the family moved to San Diego where Dave retired from the military and went to work at his brother, Uncle Al’s radiator shop while Liz stayed home and raised the kids. Elizabeth worked a few jobs such as in the school cafeteria and selling Bibles, but her real work was raising kids and watching football.\n\nElizabeth became a huge Charger’s fan and the family had season tickets to games. She was the kind of fan who went to the airport to send the team off for their playoff games. Elizabeth remained a die-hard fan and you could always find her tuned in for a game no matter her age. She loved football and European football and had plans to attend the world cup in 2026.\n\nElizabeth loved to travel back to her homeland and visit her sister and her niece, Erika, and her husband Manfred. She enjoyed and loved her grand nieces and their kids, and her great, great, nephews.\n\nIn 1976 Elizabeth became a widow again but continued to be a strong role model and support for her family. She took the three teenagers to Europe in 1978 and they are still talking about that trip to date.\n\nElizabeth remained in San Diego up until 2003 when she moved to Medow Lakes, Texas to be closer to family. She lived there until 2013 when she became one of the founding residents at Raider Ranch in Lubbock, Texas. Elizabeth loved living at Raider Ranch and enjoyed the trips to casinos, dances, all the social events, and being close to her six grandchildren and their activities. Liz lived and thrived at Raider Ranch up until May of 2023 when she moved to an assisted living facility.\n\nElizabeth was a devout Catholic and loved her church and her Lord and Savior, Jesus. She prayed without ceasing for her children, grandchildren, and other family members. She kept plenty of Holy Water around and would give you a blessing as well as blessing herself. Elizabeth believed in sharing her faith and was a faithful servant all the days of her life.\n\nElizabeth is survived by all her children and the following grandchildren, William D. Harper, Joseph Harper, Walter Stoltz, Andrea Sills, Matthew Harper, Tatum Harper, Christopher Harper, David Harper, Elizabeth Harper, Brandon Harper; and great-grandchildren, Marin Sills, Harry Sills, Loralei Sills, Avalon Harper, William A. Harper, Cohen Stoltz, Watson Stoltz, Aubrey Harper, Kailey Harper, Lexy Harper, Kylie Harper, Adalyn Harper. She is also survived by numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nA service to celebrate the life of Elizabeth Anna Harper will be held at Lake Ridge Chapel and Memorial Designers on Monday, February 26, 2024, at 2:00PM. The final internment will be held on Monday, March 18th, 2024, at 11:30AM, at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, CA.\n\nThe family wishes to thank the UMC Hospice team, especially Nurse Kaitlyn and care provider Talya. Per the family’s request please send any gifts or memorials to UMC Hospice."
