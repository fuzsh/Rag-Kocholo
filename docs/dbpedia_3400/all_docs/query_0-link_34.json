        "text": "One summer’s day in 1898, an uncle wrote his nephew about the latter’s upcoming trip abroad. It was furniture he wanted. The episode might be otherwise unremarkable were that uncle not the grand duke of Baden, that nephew the king of Prussia, and that furniture the Ark of the Covenant. This relic from Hebrew antiquity, a wooden chest covered in gold, reportedly contained the work of Moses – and with it a key to preserving bible, church, and crown.\n\nWhen the Baden duke wrote the Prussian king, the impetus had come from a Swedish surveyor and archivist by the name of Henning Melander (1858–1933). Earlier that spring, the Swede had published a series of articles in the Zionist weekly Die Welt, beneath the title ‘Could the Ark of the Covenant Be Found Again?’.1 Melander not only answered yes but even cast himself as just the man for the job. He was convinced this sacred artifact still lay there for the taking, buried long ago in Jerusalem by the prophet Jeremiah. More than serve a practical purpose or as an aesthetic decoration, the chest encapsulated the cultural, or rather religious, heritage of Mosaic Israel. Evoking J.W. Goethe’s (1749–1832) sense of morphology, from his letter to J.G. Herder (1744–1802), Melander asserted, ‘The whole of Israel is concentrated in the Ark of the Covenant, as the plant contains the whole tree in itself’, which included ‘the archive kept safe with it’.2\n\nBut he convinced more than himself. The article by Melander entered the ducal hands together with Theodor Herzl’s 1896 Judenstaat (Jewish State), a foundational document of Zionism. It was an eccentric priest who put them there: William Henry Hechler (1845–1931), chaplain to the British embassy in Vienna and champion for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. In fact, this German-born Anglican had helped put Melander’s article in Die Welt in the first place, a journal founded by Herzl (1860–1904). The reverend had also placed his own work in the pages of its very first issue, wherein he expressed his conviction that ‘a “Jewish state” must rise again in Palestine’, all the more ‘with the agreement and kind help of the European princes’.3 Hechler formed one half of a Zionist odd couple with Herzl. The committed Christian showed no less dedication to the goal than the secular Jew – but far more devotion to the precise geography. Certainly well-connected, if not always well-respected, the Christian Zionist helped leverage his political connections for the cause.\n\nHerzl and Hechler worked partly in tandem, partly at cross purposes as they chased those princes around Europe in search of political backing.4 They found it in Friedrich i of Baden (1826–1907), at least for a time. In July of 1898, after a couple years’ imploring and cajoling, the Zionist duo prevailed upon Friedrich i to write to Wilhelm ii (1859–1941), the Prussian king and German emperor. Broaching Jewish settlements in Palestine, Herzl’s plea for an audience, and Hechler’s theo-archaeological ambitions, the nobleman reported on the clergyman, ‘He also revealed to me the secret of the “Ark of the Covenant” and said: all the hopes for recovering it would turn on you.’5 In this missive to his imperial nephew, the royal uncle included the ‘scientific, thorough work’ printed in Die Zeit – checked by ‘German and British theologians’ and championed by Hechler – which discussed ‘theologically, historically’ the quest for the holy grail that was the holy ark. He opined, ‘The historical interest in the course of the peregrination of the Ark of the Covenant up to the place it now lies is, in fact, very meaningful – but of course the act of discovery would be full of meaning as a historical moment in the entire world’.6 The duke also forwarded a suggestion for the German emperor to obtain from the Ottoman sultan, Abdul Hamid ii (1842–1918), the area in question for ‘antiquarian research’ – though, crucially, without divulging ‘the goal of the research’ since he ‘would otherwise probably not be inclined to comply’.\n\nFriedrich knew how to zig and zag between religious and political aspirations – or to differentiate, as Herzl recalled him saying, ‘world-historical’ and ‘theological’ perspectives.7 (Such a distinction also featured between Hechler and Herzl themselves.) He well understood Wilhelm’s ambitions of empire as well as the potential expediency of Jews. Amidst the global jostling and jockeying of European powers, the idea emerged that Jewish emigration could warrant declaration of a protectorate for German Jews in Palestine at the expected fall of the Ottoman empire.8 Yet finding Moses’ chest might also bring a badge to the emperor’s. And Wilhelm was known to like shiny things. In this century of imperial rivalry and national display, museums in Europe were quickly filling up, often through depredation from colonial pursuits. No doubt, the Ark of the Covenant would look handsome in Berlin, next to the recently plundered metopes from the Pergamon Altar.\n\nBy finding Moses’ box, Hechler hoped to close Pandora’s, to contain the demons of historical criticism. Just as the divine cloud had surrounded Moses on Mount Sinai in the biblical account, so now clouds of doubt had been encircling him again in the minds of modern thinkers. Like other presumably historical figures – Homer, Plato, Jesus – the arrows of philology had been assailing the balloon of this Hebrew prophet over the century, both the unity of his writings and the historicity of the man.10 In the case of Moses, it was well over a century, at least as far back as Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677). Whether as figment or as fraud, he had become suspect, together with his legacy: from his religious laws to his political constitution to his historical deeds. Discovering the ark, with the tablets of stone and manuscripts of Moses, could, hoped Hechler, bring certainty to the Christian faith – and glory to the German empire. Herzl and Hechler, however, would only find disappointment: in spade and crown alike.\n\nIf this motley crew hoped to find the corpus of Moses buried away in Southwest Asia, its spirit was on full display in Central Europe already, or rather still. Images of Moses and/or his Ten Commandments adorned public buildings across the Germanies. Some had stood for centuries, like the Decalogue scenes painted by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553) on the townhall of Wittenberg, Saxony, in the early 1500s, the statue of Moses erected on the Bremen Rathaus about a century later, or the figure carved into wooden paneling of the Friedenssaal in the city hall of Münster sometime in between. Others were of more recent vintage, such as on a ceiling in the guildhall of Monheim, Bavaria: the residence of a ‘court Jew’ built in the 1730s yet sold to the city upon expulsion of Jewish people not too long thereafter. Still other likenesses had been recently restored, including the Rathaus façade in Lindau, Swabia, during the 1880s. Yet Moses had made more recent appearances as well. A mural in the Neues Museum of Berlin, by Wilhelm von Kaulbach (1804–1874), starred him along with other lawgivers ancient and modern: Solon (ca. 630–560 bce), Charlemagne (ca. 747–814), and Frederick the Great (1712–1786) (Figure 1).\n\nIn 1904, he would also ornament the renovated Grossratssaal of Basel, Switzerland. Alongside such civic sightings, Mosaic manifestations could long no less be spotted on sacred sites as well, from the Mosesbrunnen beside the Minster in Bern – built in 1544 and rebuilt 250 years later – to the graven image of him sculpted for the Berlin cathedral in the 1890s (Figure 2).11\n\nYet the narrative of Moses as pioneering lawgiver lived on – be it bruised, maimed, or reincarnated – even as the nature of that law (civil or religious), its significance (historical or normative), and its scope (universal or particular) remained very much contested. Although Spinoza killed the author Moses, and Voltaire (1694–1778) assassinated his moral character, Rousseau (1712–1778) could still laud the effects of his legislation.15 Many followed Montesquieu (1689–1755), whose On the Spirit of Law relativized such historic legislation by appealing to the words of Solon and God themselves that conceded to having given imperfect laws, which then furnished a ‘sponge that wipes out all the difficulties that are to be found in the law of Moses’.16 Nonetheless, this title role of historic legislator remained a point of departure and return.\n\nDespite these conceptual shifts, older – even ancient – practices perdured in processing Mosaic law. In his monumental Mosaisches Recht, or Mosaic Jurisprudence, Johann David Michaelis (1717–1791) declared, ‘whoever wants to look at the laws [Gesetze] with the eye of a Montesquieu, for him it is indispensable to know the legal systems [Rechte] of other peoples: the further in time and place, the better’.17 For Michaelis and many more, Athens had much to do with Jerusalem: ‘Everything that can move us to devote our hard work to Greek law will also recommend the Mosaic law to us as remarkable’.18 Or was it Jerusalem and Cairo? Already the Geography of Strabo (ca. 62–24 bce) portrayed Moses as an Egyptian priest: this antique sketch associating law in Bible and religion in Egypt was transformed into a bright mural in the Enlightenment.19\n\nThe study of comparative lawgiving represented a time-honored tradition. Ever since antiquity, Moses was made to stand shoulder to shoulder with – or head and shoulders above – other peoples’ lawgivers. In his Library of History, Diodorus of Sicily (1st cent. bce) placed Moses, with his god ‘Iao’ and his people the Jews, in a lineup of divine lawgivers: alongside Hermes through Menes in Egypt, Zeus through Minos in Crete, Apollo through Lycurgus for the Spartans, the Good Spirit through Zarathustra for the Aryans, and Hestia through Zalmoxis for the Getae.20 The obscure late-antique work known as Lex Dei or Mosaicarum et Romanarum legum collatio (The Law of God or Compilation of the Mosaic and Roman Laws), a more technical, less topical comparison, even juxtaposed extracts from the Hebrew scriptures with some from Roman legal writing.21 Attracting savants since the sixteenth century, this collection underwent its foundational editing by Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) in 1890. Albert Montefiore Hyamson (1875–1954), a British civil servant and Zionist leader, commenced his English translation and revision of that edition because of ‘the prospect of an interesting comparison between two great [legal] systems’ but had to confess ‘this promise was illusory’.22 He was not the last to find interest – or illusions – in comparing the code of Moses to more worldly systems of law.\n\nA historic lawgiver and the founder of a nation, of an ancient Hebrew people, Moses therefore occupied a central place as a both a father of Judaism and a framer of European civilization, two of his major roles – by turns in tension, in harmony, or in parallel – within much wider, longer cultural history.23 Throughout the long nineteenth century, Mosaic patrimony came to the fore especially in debates over the legacy of Judaism in the West, over what the Christian nations of modern Europe owed to an ancient Semitic people of the Middle East. Moses loomed equally large as Jewish Europeans contemplated questions of tradition, identity, and assimilation. From the poet Heinrich Heine (1797–1856) to novelist Franz Kafka (1883–1924) to composer Arnold Schoenberg (1874–1951), Germanophone Jews in particular often framed their reflections on Jewishness and its relationship to modern European cultures by exploring the figure of Moses.24 Psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) devoted no small amount of attention to him too, which itself has attracted much analysis.25 In like manner, the philosopher Hermann Cohen (1842–1918) reflected on the authority of Mosaic law as guarantor of human morality and defender of pure monotheism.26\n\nHowever, Moses was not just built into the architecture of modern Europe, both real and ideal. His law was even built into its legal structures. Michael Carhart writes, accordingly, ‘As law codes were revised in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, frequently parts or even all of the law of Moses were incorporated into local legal systems, and most regions of Europe at least rendered the Ten Commandments as a basic part of the regional law’.27 However, revision could also turn into rejection, as was the case from at least the later seventeenth century onward. Transforming age-old theological questions about not only the particularity and universality of Jewish law but also natural vis-à-vis revealed or ‘positive’ religion, a wide array of discussions both between and among Jews and Christians reassessed the normativity of ancient Mosaic law in modern European society. Many among the Christians converged with a larger movement, in the words of Nils H. Roemer, ‘to decenter Judaism’s elevated role in world history’.28 Between the Christians, not a few Protestants deployed certain stereotypes of Judaism – as hidebound legalism – to polemicize against Catholicism: availing themselves of ancient Jewish law to assail contemporary Catholics as legalistic, irrational, and unmodern. Long disputes ensued as to which laws, if any, were still binding and why.\n\nClaims and convictions, like their consequences, could cut across confessions. Some of those discussions were theoretical in nature, ranging from reason and revelation to ethics and the nature of religion. As criticism of the Old Testament grew at the end of the eighteenth century to match that of the New, much Enlightenment thought was dispensing with adiaphora in order to save the faith.29 New frames thus formed around an older question, one Christine Hayes articulates in the title of her astute study on antiquity as ‘what’s divine about divine law?’30 In his inaugural lecture at Jena of 1789 – the year before a title change in his position from history to philosophy – Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805) attributed much enlightened thought to ‘Mosaic religion’, insofar as the teaching of a single god undergirded the concept of reason. Founded on truth and founding a state, argued Schiller, the Mosaic legislation fostered happiness among the Hebrews and laid a solid foundation for future enlightenment.31 Around the same time, G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831) became convinced that the moral theory of Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) had essentially interiorized the ‘positive’ law of Moses.32 So too the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment, supported a comparable move to internalize and privatize traditional practice. As Leora Batnitzky has shown, this trajectory imagined ‘that Judaism, and especially Jewish law, is not political but instead concerns the intellectual and spiritual dimensions of human experience’ – which allowed for its construction as a ‘religion’ structurally analogous to Christianity.33 As the reform movement in Judaism gained steam, the medieval philosopher Maimonides (ca. 1138–1204) became a chief source in debates on the binding nature of Jewish law.34\n\nOther discussions were historical, driven by recasting, as the old pun went, the Mosaic Bible into a biblical mosaic. While critical analysis of biblical literature narrowed the textual inventory ascribable to Moses (or even to deep antiquity), the move to historicize and/or particularize Mosaic law expanded, whether the intention was to salvage or to spurn it. The lion’s share of literature on biblical learning in this period tends to focus on Protestant scholarship, in the matrix of theology, philology, and history. Yet Jews, no less than Christians, were confronted by the concomitant conundrums. Jewish writers generated an equally broad set of solutions when faced with such historicist thinking.35 In his voluminous work on Jewish antiquity, Isaak Markus Jost (1793–1860), for instance, accepted a distinction between ‘Mosaism’ and ‘Judaism’, between biblical and postbiblical Jewish history: a theologically freighted, often pernicious periodization long deployed in Protestant polemic. However, he argued against the implementation of Mosaic law in that earlier era, calling it more theory than practice, and argued for the realization of its monotheistic and moral dimensions only in the latter epoch, which amounted to a rise – not a fall – in the legacy of Moses.36 Later, Benno Jacob (1862–1945) conceded critical arguments against Mosaic authorship, in his popular book Die Thora Moses (The Torah of Moses), but still claimed ‘the spirit of Moses’ gave unity to the Pentateuch and thus warranted continued reference to ‘the Torah of Moses’, even more if than two hands wrote under the name.37\n\nStill other discussions were political, or rather overtly so. Concerns with the normativity of biblical legislation did not, of course, arise for the first time in this period. Perennial questions had long looked to the Mosaic law and an imagined Hebrew republic for matters juridical and legal, governmental and national. As Adam Sutcliffe has written of the early modern period, ‘The most politically contested field of Hebraism, and the most useful area for supporters of republicanism, was Jewish law.’38 Eric Nelson has further emphasized how rabbinic texts, not the biblical alone, served as sources for such political thought.39 Yet the long nineteenth century, as an age of reform, revolution, and emancipation, brought new possibilities and challenges – and with them new questions and answers. In 1788, Abbé Grégoire (1750–1831) transferred ideas – of Moses Mendelssohn (1729–1786) most of all – from Germany to France, and from Jewish to Christian thought, when he distinguished ‘in Mosaic law, between what lies essentially in the religious realm and what is only the object of civil and criminal jurisprudence, for the two are separable’.40 But not everyone considered politics so separable from religion within the Mosaic writings. In a venomous series of lectures, Heinrich Leo (1799–1878) moved seamlessly from textual and historical arguments against the ‘Mosaic’ part of Mosaic law – what he deemed a devious project of later Jewish priestcraft, hiding behind the authority of Moses – into a diatribe against hierarchy (as in rule by priests), theocracy, and democracy, even pairing Robespierre (1748–1794) with Pharisees and portraying him as ‘the consequence’ of such priestly rule: a rule always empty of feeling and full of fanaticism.41 Just as Pharisaism enabled a superior Christianity to emerge, he argued, so also Catholicism allowed a higher Protestantism to form. If politics and religion were inseparable in the law of Moses itself, they were no less indivisible in discussions of that inseparability.\n\nAlthough the name of the Hebrew legislator appeared on both lists, his ‘legislative act on Sinai’ underwent reinterpretation: ‘only regarded as symbolically inspired by God’. But if the law of Moses had become a dead letter to some, for many his legacy lived on – so many, in fact, that a German emperor felt compelled to intervene in a perilous theological, and political, debate.\n\nWith its citation of prophets, Jesus, and Luther, the kaiser’s intervention suggests two other aspects of Moses in modernity.43 On the one hand, the Pentateuch was often read through the Prophets, especially by Christians. Some such interpreters latched onto a selection of prooftexts – like the passage in Isaiah 1 where God asks, ‘What need have I of all your sacrifices?’ (jps) – to claim the law had already been rejected, by God or the prophets themselves, even before Christianity superseded Judaism. The commentary by Ferdinand Wilhelm Weber (1836–1879), a Protestant pastor and active missionary to Jews, went in this direction: ‘So little delight does the LOrd have in the nature of this people’s worship, then, that he wants to put an end to it himself.’44 The hermeneutical navigation here, of course, came from a particular reading of Paul (ca. 5–64 ce) and, further still, of Paul as read by Martin Luther (1483–1546): with a theological animosity to law.45 On the other hand, the framing of Mosaic law was largely limited to the Bible, not the Talmud. Few Christians engaged with rabbinic materials, and those who did usually depended on translations and anthologies like that by Weber, who sought to define a ‘theology’ for ancient Judaism.46 Many more simply disliked, even disparaged, the rabbis and their battery of discussions on halacha. Hermann L. Strack (1848–1922), the theologian and orientalist, was thus a rare Christian expert in rabbinics – enough to merit the respect of Jewish scholars – though not a rarity in his dedication to converting Jews.47 In consequence, the question of Mosaic law was mostly confined to the (Christian) Bible.\n\nTrue to its title, this volume focuses on the figure of Moses to examine diverse representations and appropriations of biblical law across the German lands from the late eighteenth to early twentieth centuries. Its chapters chart how reflections on that ancient law shaped debates on modern structures – legal, political, religious, scholarly – and how contemporary concerns impacted, conversely, the apprehension of Mosaic law. Did Moses copy Hammurabi? Why would sacred legislation have any place in a modern state? Must Jews be forever bound by ancient law? How radical were the politics of Moses? In doing so, these chapters foreground the entanglements of secular and religious, of past and present, and of biblical, classical, and orientalist traditions – all against such background as legal reformation, administrative integration, colonial extraction, and civil emancipation. The selection of sources, sites, and speakers further shows how ‘German’ discourse remained inextricable from durable, if at times disavowed, connections across and beyond Europe.\n\nPart 1, ‘Representations of the Past’, focuses on historical constructions of Moses and biblical law. In ‘The Early Speech of Nations: Biblical Poetry and the Emergence of Germanic Myth’, Ofri Ilany investigates the juxtaposition of things Hebraic and things Germanic: from language, literature, and law to religion, people, and custom. Positioning figures like Johann Gottfried Herder, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock (1724–1803), and Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette (1780–1849) within a wider, deeper galaxy of intellectual culture, he documents the promotion (or demotion) of sacred scripture into the national heritage of an ancient, primitive people: no longer a legal code, moral guide, history book, or doctrinal system but now primarily a cultural artifact. Herder did much to recast Moses as a people’s poet, a nation’s founder. ‘Which lawgiver could claim to have an effect deeper on his people’s customs [Sitten] than Moses?’, Herder once asked, in a source this chapter cites. ‘Not even Lycurgus can be compared to him; and now if he summed up the effect of his existence into words, it became – a song.’48 Ilany argues for entanglement between the study of Hebrew national epics and the creation of German national mythology: both were deeply concerned with naturalism, poesy, and originality. His analysis uncovers how ideas of poetic nations governed understandings of the Bible and how conceptions of the ancient Hebrews, in turn, shaped notions of other peoples’ pasts. But if sacred scripture morphed into a cultural inscription, reading it proved no easier – and no less contentious.\n\n‘I am speaking here not of the historical but of the mythical Moses,’ Heymann Steinthal (1823–1899) specified in 1862, ‘and hope the reader will be inclined to distinguish these two just as much as with the historical and legendary Charlemagne.’ The Jewish philosopher, psychologist, and philologist continued: ‘Now the mythical Moses is, in essence, comparable with Prometheus.’49 Like Steinthal in this passage, whom she herself discusses in her essay, Carlotta Santini moves from things Germanic to things Greek, examining how Bible and Homer underwent analysis in the new science of myth, circa 1800. With ‘The Rise of Jewish Mythology: Biblical Exegesis and the Scientific Study of Myth’, Santini follows the cross-pollination across fields now seen as fenced off. Alongside Ilany, Santini traces a transformation from the Bible as holy writ of God to wholly written by humans: be it composed or collected by Moses, compiled in his name or created by the people as collective. In this trajectory from sacred scripture to national monument, she also offers readings, from a different perspective, on Michaelis, Robert Lowth (1710–1787), Christian Gottlob Heyne (1729–1812), and Herder – the same Herder who once declared, ‘What Homer is to the Greeks, Moses is to the Hebrews’.50\n\nHowever, Santini’s study of biblical and classical studies centers on mythology as both subject and object, as discipline and material, following the fate of this approach as it found advocates and adversaries. She presents Lowth treating Moses and Homer together to consider myth in both and, conversely, Heyne moving from the authority of the Bible to validate the inquiry into myth, which in turn validated it as a hermeneutical lens. Along the way, her chapter discerns tensions in collaboration, demonstrating the difficulty of interpreting ancient myths as well as modern mythologists. She exposes difference in rhetorical or generic parameters between Heyne and Martin Gottfried Hermann (1755–1822) and disagreement over interpretation of the first book of Moses between the editor Johann Philipp Gabler (1753–1826) and author Johann Gottfried Eichhorn (1752–1827). Eichhorn’s ideas, she argues, then entered Völkerpsychologie (‘folk psychology’) through Friedrich August Carus (1770–1807). Half a century before Steinthal invoked Prometheus, Carus had produced a psychology of ancient Hebrews, which appraised the Mosaic writings as sources and further assessed the ‘psychological formation’ (psychologische Bildung) of Moses and his contemporaries.51 The chapter sketches other contours, including attempts to discover laws that governed myth, laws of human cultural development, and laws of interpretation. Identifying where writers were not willing to go and what they were unwilling to relinquish, she advances her core argument: scholarship on mythic material still carries within it a theology that molded the study of myth as a discipline. According to Santini, the rise of mythology as a science meant the Bible had to undergo such analysis or risk losing its status as a legitimate object of study, with ‘religion’ then deposed as a superior form of consciousness. Therefore, confessional convictions that once held faith and science together still exercise a bonding power in mythology today.\n\nMoses for the Hebrews, Confucius for the Chinese, Jesus for the Christians, Muhammad for the Muslims: these pairings appeared in the entry for ‘legislator’ in a major French lexicon of the period. ‘Religion is the first law of any society which begins; therefore, those who founded religions have been called legislators’, the author, an attorney general, registered before adding political and civil laws: and with them the exemplary lawgivers Lycurgus and Solon for Greece (i.e. for Sparta and Athens, respectively) and Napoleon (1769–1821) for France.52 If the dictionary had gone through a third edition, in the final third of the century, that entry could not have omitted Hammurabi for the Babylonians. In his essay ‘Moses or Hammurabi? Law, Morality & Modernity in Ancient Near Eastern Studies,’ Felix Wiedemann shifts from the pairing of Jerusalem with Athens or Berlin to that of Jerusalem with Babylon. Like Ilany, Wiedemann pursues constructions of the ancient Hebrews as a more natural, more primitive people – at a lower stage of ‘civilisation’ – as well as conceptions of Jewish heritage in European culture. So too his chapter complements Santini’s in addressing the obstacles that emerged when the books of Moses were set alongside texts from other ancient peoples: but here Moses sits alongside Hammurabi, instead of Homer. This essay depicts several ways in which comparison opened fault lines within fields and fissures within confessions. As with myth, so too law could shake up or shore up the faith.\n\nWiedemann shows how the code of Hammurabi could be too close for comfort. Both biblical and Babylonian legislation entailed comparable content, commensurate claims of divine origins, and corresponding human lawgivers. Concentrating less on new ways of reading than new sets of data, Wiedemann traces an international arms race – or rather race of hands – in the deciphering, transcribing, editing, and processing of sources, and he tracks a series of interpretative contests that not only included German, Austrian, and Swiss or even British, French, and American scholars but also incorporated Jews, Catholics, and Protestants, involved rabbis and pastors, and encompassed ivory tower and public square alike. His central argument insists the controversies over the Mosaic and Hammurabic codes represented no mere chapter in the saga of the Babel-Bibel-Streit but constituted a story in its own right. Wiedemann’s essay situates this discourse within wider debates on the origins of civilisation and foundations of law as well as discussions over which ancient people proved to be the greatest – or at least the greatest contributor to ‘modern European culture’. With an eye on the labile relationship between archaeology and exegesis as well as the anxieties about autonomy (independent innovation, not diffusion), antiquity (older being better), and authenticity (original over copy), Wiedemann trains his sights on Sittlichkeit, which he considers a ‘key concept’ in this period, one that blurred morality, culture, and law. His analysis further reveals that the debate took as its starting point the confrontation between a sacred Moses and a secular Hammurabi, with the former conflating morality and law and the latter distinguishing the two. In the end, Wiedemann explains how much of these debates about the past proved to be, in fact, about the present: from law and religion to ethics and even capitalism.\n\nHad he written several decades later, Moritz Duschak (1815–1890) would have had to tackle those Babylonians. But in 1869, the Moravian rabbi, like the attorney’s entry in the Dictionnaire de la conversation et de la lecture cited above, could still ignore them as he sought to systematise Jewish law. In Das mosaisch-talmudische Strafrecht. Ein Beitrag zur historischen Rechtswissenschaft (Mosaic-Talmudic Criminal Law: A Contribution to Historical Legal Studies), Duschak argued that the rabbis had\n\nnot only sought to harmonise, in a distinctive way, the few Mosaic legal provisions with the expanded legal ideas and experiences among the Jews themselves but also borrowed a great deal from the legislations of other peoples, Persians, Greeks, and Romans – albeit with wise concealment of the origin – and merged it with Jewish law.53\n\nNot yet excavated, much less codified into the inventory of inescapable cultural comparisons, the Code of Hammurabi did not make his list.\n\nThirty years onward, a different eye looked at criminal law in comparative perspective. That eye belonged to Theodor Mommsen, and it looked to specialists in other fields of legal history – jurists and philologists – during work on the Roman case, for a title in the ‘Systematic Handbook of German Legal Studies’.54 While it did not make contact with the ancient empires of Mesopotamia either, that line of sight had become more difficult to maintain. After Mommsen’s death, contributors to the 1905 Zum ältesten Strafrecht der Kulturvölker (On the Oldest Criminal Law of the Civilized Peoples) wanted to add other ‘peoples of culture’ for publication – the Babylonians, Parsees, Slavs – but the decision rested with preserving Mommsen’s own parameters.55 Two aspects stand out. First, the volume included dedicated discussions of Greek, Roman, Germanic, Indian, Arabic, and Islamic law – but not Jewish. (Jews as well as Christians authored entries for the book.) As clarified in the foreword, an initial print run had credited, inter alia, Theodor Nöldeke (1836–1930) for ‘Arabic’, Julius Wellhausen (1844–1918) for ‘Arabic-Jewish’, and Ignaz Goldziher (1850–1921) for ‘Muslim’ criminal law.56 The final publication of Wellhausen’s entry, however, bore the title ‘Arabic-Israelite’. It therefore bound ancient Israel to pre-Islamic Arabs: on the apparent assumption of a common substrate to peoples, in this case, both primitive and Semitic.57 Second, this construction divided Torah and Talmud, thereby fracturing the Jewish legal tradition. In specifying ‘Israelite’, the title highlighted one part of Jewish history while blurring later (and especially for Christians, theologically freighted and polemically charged) periods of ancient Judaism. Meanwhile, the content of the chapter, insofar as it concerned Jewish antiquity, referred squarely to the Old Testament. In this way, Jewish law was compressed into the biblical and conflated with pre-Islamic Arabic.\n\nBut what some would separate, others joined together. Duschak’s book was a sort of sequel. In 1864, he had undertaken a similar effort for civil law, hoping to ensure that guidelines on marriage did not conflict with moral, religious ones. There too, he treated the body of Jewish law, exegesis, and commentary as a single corpus, reflected in the very title Das mosaisch-talmudische Eherecht (Mosaic-Talmudic Marital Law), and here again arose questions of history and its consequences. Duschak was less concerned with the autonomy or authenticity of Jewish tradition than with its stability and integrity and thus posed two contentious queries for Jews: ‘Is the Mosaic-Talmudic marriage law a doctrine that was once established, concluded, not to be altered or modified? Who would claim this?’.58\n\nPart 2 of Moses among the Moderns, under the heading ‘Transformations in the Present’, considers some who asked and answered such questions as those by Duschak. Shifting from past to present, from descriptive to normative, the chapters concentrate on contemporary appropriations of Mosaic law. This part begins with ‘Gesetz als Gegensatz: The Modern Halachic Language Game’ by Irene Zwiep. So as Santini, she scrutinizes Heymann Steinthal and Völkerpsychologie; along with Ilany, the author investigates themes of a Hebraic national legacy and a Judaic contribution to European culture; and with Wiedemann, Zwiep inquires into law, ethics, morality, and Sittlichkeit. Yet she turns away from the discourse on Mosaic law as dominated by Christians and populated by concerns with systems of belief, trust in historical claims, and faith in revealed doctrine. Instead, her analysis pivots on changes to the framing of Mosaic law – in its distinction, identification, and delineation – among Jewish thinkers.\n\nZwiep explores dynamic reassessments of Jewish communal law, or halacha, amid great change in legal corpora, practices, and systems and in arrangements of church, state, and society. As her essay argues, the foundational rules and principles of Jewish legal practice may have remained stable, but the perception and observance of Jewish law changed dramatically. Indeed, the traditional integration of law, devotion, and morality spelled trouble for Judaism in a new order that claimed a separation of church and state and a distinction between moral religion and national legislation. With this inherent combination of law and religion featuring as both essence and embarrassment for Judaism, a range of thinkers engaged in what she calls a ‘halachic language game’, deploying old vocabulary into new contexts. On the one hand, her chapter discerns a trend among Jewish thinkers to amplify the Hebrew Bible as ethical and to dampen the legal corpus as esoteric. On the other hand, Zwiep’s essay detects internal differentiation, distinguishing three interpretative trajectories for reframing halacha. If Moses Mendelssohn and Hirschel Lewin (1721–1800) had cast it as a Jewish canon law outside competition with the state legal apparatus, Moritz Lazarus (1824–1903) followed Steinthal to depict it as collective morality that imitated a divine holiness, while Zacharias Frankel (1801–1875) portrayed it as Jewish jurisprudence, not only on par with Roman and German traditions but also a form of rational legislation. Examining a Judaism divided by external, Western categories of religion, law, and morality, Zwiep contends that religious practice ultimately became internalized, moralized, and thereby anesthetized, with traditional Jewish law discarded as a viable normative system. The lawgiving Moses thus seemed to be less modern – more time-bound – than the moralizing one.\n\nIn ‘The Truth Shall Abide: Samson Raphael Hirsch and Abraham Geiger on the Binding Nature of Torah’, Judith Frishman focuses on two stars within this discursive firmament mapped by Zwiep. Her chapter, too, attends to notions of Sittlichkeit and Kantian morality, to historicising and mythological readings of the Bible, and to questions of law vis-à-vis the authentically, essentially, irreducibly, or unalterably Jewish. Frishman homes in on an internal debate at the heart of modern Judaism, between orthodoxy and reform. Through her close reading of a critical exchange between Hirsch (1808–1888) and Geiger (1810–1874), she demonstrates how both liberalising and traditionalising movements conceptualized obedience to Jewish law. That exchange grappled with how to read text and uphold tradition amidst an assimilating Jewish bourgeoisie and a reforming rabbinate, and its positions were often articulated in epistolary and dialogic form and mostly siloed in specifically Jewish channels. Her essay details the attempt to grapple with competing claims both between and among philosophy, theology, and history: to synthesize or stabilize, to suspend or suppress them. It also charts the effort to measure the interpretative significance of historical development and to adjudicate the analytical suitability of other methods for understanding the Torah: whether seemingly universal, ‘scientific’ modalities of reading were applicable to particular ancient texts. In doing so, Frishman traces the emergence of questions on election, whether this meant a people chosen or a people choosing obedience. Ultimately, her analysis targets debates over what it means to be true to the teachings of Moses.\n\n‘Law, generally speaking, to the average man is dull reading’, wrote a man from Babylon (on Long Island) in 1906, ‘and we need not be afraid to admit that this universal rule holds good with regard to the Law of Moses’.59 But jurists, just like exegetes, are not normal people. For many, that reading was gripping. Lawyers from London to Leipzig thus offered their own studies of Mosaic law, including the barrister Harold M. Wiener (1875–1929), who sought ‘to apply the ordinary methods of legal study to the solution of Biblical problems’.60 Well into the twentieth century, American law reviews – in Ann Arbor, New Orleans, and elsewhere – devoted space to articles on biblical law, as did The Green Bag: An Entertaining Magazine for Lawyers, based in Boston.61 So too journals for legal studies affiliated with both Cambridge universities, lse, and the French society for comparative law found room to publish book reviews on Mosaic legislation.62\n\nLegislators in Parliament, however, long betrayed a special interest in biblical law – especially on the matter of marrying sisters. With ‘“A Law for Jews and Not for Christians”? Mosaic Law and the Deceased Wife’s Sister Debate in Victorian Britain’, Michael Ledger-Lomas finds the fingerprints of Moses in the making of modern law. Following Frishman, he highlights Christian views of Judaism wed – in a spirit of supersessionism – to the notion of dead letters, and with Wiedemann his chapter underscores how Christians could disavow biblical law yet feel no small discomfort when discovering similar laws and stories in other ancient cultures. In line with Santini and Ilany, Ledger-Lomas shows Michaelis to have been enormously influential even beyond the German lands: here, in questions of the value and validity of Mosaic jurisprudence. His essay, like Zwiep’s, underscores efforts by Jews to reconsider the place of Jewish law in a modern (Christian) state.\n\nYet departing from past work on the economic, social, and sexual spheres of marriage as well as the colonial dimensions to legal reform, Ledger-Lomas arrives at scriptural foundations. Spotlighting the interpretation and interpreters of biblical sources, he illuminates the textual basis of protracted debates on marriage and the family and elucidates the political cartography of those theological positions. Those debates, he argues, reveal a still more basic disagreement over the evaluation and application of Mosaic law. As his chapter expounds, moreover, the British discussion was tied to the German one, not only through the work of Michaelis or an enquête among professors of Hebrew but also via attention to marriage law abroad. Germans, like Jews, became beacons and bogeymen by turns. As Ledger-Lomas brings to light, marriage reformers could overcome their anxiety about German theology to find friends of convenience in biblical critics and Jewish commentators when certain arguments or expertise lent the right support. However, he also illustrates how figures on both sides of the issue in Britain found common ground: in different forms of anti-Judaism. Ultimately, his essay maps a feedback loop between ideas of marriage in the modern state and ideas of how to interpret and apply the law of Moses.\n\n‘Jews were not Socialists at heart’, Theodor Herzl recalled telling the Prussian secretary of state, strategically. Herzl, remembering something he had read, elaborated: ‘Through the Decalogue Moses created an individualistic form of society. And the Jews … are and will remain individualists’.63 As Carolin Kosuch shows, not everyone agreed. In ‘Moses and the Left: Traces of the Torah in Modern Jewish Anarchist Thought’, Kosuch traces the transformation of Mosaic law in radical political thought among German Jews. If together with Zwiep she considers Mendelssohn’s view of Judaism as a rational religion of tolerance and humanity, she focuses like Frishman on responses to embourgeoisement and acculturation of German Jews and considers alongside Ledger-Lomas the politics involved in appropriating the Mosaic law.\n\nKosuch’s chapter explores a post-Mendelssohn world, moving from a state project of Jewish emancipation and assimilation to a political project to turn the world upside down. She disentangles the artistic, anarchist, and socialist strands all intertwined in the political theory of Gustav Landauer (1870–1919) and Erich Mühsam (1878–1934). Charting different responses to the problems of modernity and reactions to the place of Judaism in it, her chapter maps the interweaving of enlightened and romantic ideas in an age of formal legal equality for Jews. Kosuch considers why these two thinkers turned to anarchism and how, precisely as Jews and radicals, Landauer and Mühsam encountered tensions on both sides: raised in bourgeois Jewish families yet active in the mostly non-Jewish proletarian circles of their politics. However, their anarchistic ideas, she contends, entailed a reframing of central figures in the Jewish canon, including Moses. By fusing Mendelssohn and Romanticism, Herder and Haskalah, Landauer and Mühsam fashioned a new interpretative framework for Jewish law and particularity: as a duty to act – to ameliorate humanity and to consummate a new, true equality. This attempt at an anarchist reconfiguring of Jewish tradition, Kosuch further argues, constituted a dual form of resistance: to the Protestant bourgeoise as well as to their acculturated Jewish milieu.\n\nThe core of this volume comes from a workshop – international, interdisciplinary, intergenerational – entitled ‘Mosaic Law among the Moderns: Constructions of Biblical Law in 19th-Century Germany’ and hosted in Cambridge during the summer of 2019. Presenters and respondents from Germany and Belgium, Israel and Italy, as well as the US, UK, and Netherlands, engaged in thought-provoking papers and lively conversation for three days’ time. That exchange was especially enriched by its diversity: in career stage, including predocs, postdocs, and professors, as in field, ranging from history and classics to studies religious, German, and Jewish. The delay between presentation and publication resulted from the usual holdups – major and minor, individual and collective – for such collaborative undertakings as well as the rather unusual one: namely a global pandemic.\n\nMany of the chapters in Moses among the Moderns originated in that Cambridge conference, appearing here in revised form: those by Irene Zwiep, Felix Wiedemann, Carolin Kosuch, and Judith Frishman. Two others from that event have seen replacement. As Ofri Ilany’s original presentation was committed elsewhere, he wrote a new piece specifically for this volume.64 Suzanne L. Marchand delivered a striking keynote presentation under the title ‘Greek Freedom and Mosaic Law in 19th-Century Germany’, laying out what Greek freedom meant to German thinkers in this period (a geistige Freiheit to imagine, learn, and create and to escape clerical and feudal legalism as well as aristocracy; a bürgerliche Freiheit, with citizens free to serve the state; a völkische Freiheit, championing individual tribes or peoples from domination by other, larger empires or states) – and in contrast to ‘oriental’ despotism, including the idea of Greek laws as universal and modern, with Mosaic law cast as ‘oriental’ and particular, a survival unfit for a new age. Instead of that paper, Marchand has contributed a retrospective on the volume as a whole, helping to weave the strands together.\n\nTwo other papers were delivered at the workshop but owing to other commitments could not, understandably, be revised for publication here. Both expanded the scope in transnational and colonial history. With ‘Which Law for the Colonial Empire? Rule of Law and (Christian) Religion in German Colonialism’, Nicola Camilleri (University of Padua) compared the tension between cultural and religious difference among inhabitants of the German empire and of colonial rule, on the one hand, and in the Italian colonial context, on the other. One tentative yet tantalizing result of the discussion was how legal history related to religion in the metropole transformed yet extended to the colonies: how procedures for marriage between Catholics and Protestants informed the same for citizens and subjects outside the borders in Europe. Annelies Lannoy (Ghent University) presented ‘The Law and the Republic: Maurice Vernes and Aristide Astruc on the History of Mosaic Law and its Instruction in the Ecole Laïque’. After surveying the Protestant Vernes’s (1845–1923) historical work on biblical law and political writings on the importance of the Old Testament for French secular education, Lannoy traced his strategic alliance with Rabbi Astruc (1831–1905) to integrate the history of religion – specifically Jewish history – into curricular programming. She thus illuminated biblical scholarship across national and confessional borders in the matrix of state and secularity. Furthermore, a third was set to expand the confessional, linguistic, and geographic perspective. Cristiana Facchini (University of Bologna) was meant to deliver ‘Monitoring German Scholarship on the Bible: Jesuit and Catholic Counter-Narratives (1850s–1900s)’. Through the journal La Civiltà Cattolica, founded in 1850, the paper planned to map Jesuit interpretation of German Protestant interpretation from the foundation of the journal to the modernist crisis (1907), focusing on the relationship between the nation state and the transnational Catholic community of faith. Unfortunately, Facchini had to withdraw from the program shortly before the workshop.\n\nIn addition to the papers revised or replaced for this volume, three were solicited to supplement the publication in breadth and depth. Carlotta Santini thus added her original contribution to include perspectives from German classics, while Michael Ledger-Lomas expanded the scope to interactions with German biblical studies in the British context. Yet another was planned to address Mosaic law in the historiography of Muhammad and formative Islam. David Moshfegh (ie University, Madrid) kindly agreed to write a chapter entitled ‘Semitic Religion, Theocracy, and Islamwissenschaft’, centered on Goldziher, Wellhausen, Nöldeke, and William Robertson Smith (1846–1894). This plan did not come to fruition, however.\n\nThis account of the prehistory to Moses among the Moderns aims not only to elucidate its becoming – the possibilities and actualities – or to illuminate latent ideas from unrecorded conversations or unrealized intentions. Rather, it also seeks to cast light on future pathways for work on the cultural history of Moses and reception of biblical law. In this way, it should signpost the roads travelled, those not taken, and those to be taken even further.\n\nWhen Moses breathed his last on Mount Nebo – in the same region Hechler would hope to find the Ark of the Covenant and therein his very own writings – Joshua led the Israelites onward, to new vistas, new horizons. So too others should now lead the way to add further pieces to this Mosaic mosaic, to this reception of Moses and his many roles: in cultural, intellectual, and religious history, across the German lands, throughout the nineteenth century – and beyond (Cover Image; Figure 3).\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nGenerous support for work on this essay came from the Flemish Research Council (fwo).
