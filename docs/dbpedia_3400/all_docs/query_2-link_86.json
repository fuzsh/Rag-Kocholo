        "text": "What is NY for you?\n\nNYC is where I was born and raised, so it is home to me. Almost every corner of this City has a memory for me stretching back to my childhood. Sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it here, but it is always where I feel I belong the most.\n\nThat links you with Italy?\n\nMuch of my family still lives in Italy, including my beloved cousin, Tommaso, who is like my older brother. My best friends are also all Italian. I like to say that NYC is my quantity of life, Italy is my quality of life. I love to come to Italy to recharge.\n\nIn the Frette movie you chilling doing exercise and reading, do the same in real life … in addition to cooking?\n\nYes, I spend a lot of time reading, writing, exercising, and also cooking. I just finished my 1st cookbook so my kitchen is always full of food, notes, pots, pans, and dishes. I love feeding people and entertaining close friends and family around a meal.\n\nYou said you didn’t want to be a model, so you decided to do be a food blogger in the future?\n\nI never intended to become a model, but I am very grateful that it came into my life. Modeling helped me to travel, see the world, become financially independent. I have nothing but love for the fashion and beauty community, which have shown me so much generosity and support, and taught me so much. But by the time I had been modeling for over 10 years, it was time to move on. Ever since I was a small child, I was always passionate about the environment and sustainability, but I never could figure out where I fit in.\n\nFrom 2008-2010, I studied to get a Masters degree and discovered that food was a great way to engage and talk about issues that matter to me. I love that food is something everyone on the Planet can relate to – we all need food to survive. I write about food in the hopes to spark larger conversations, not just to talk about the food itself.\n\nYou grew up in NY and have traveled the world, what is your favorite comfort food? Italian, French, thai, Mexican, Japanese …\n\nItalian food, of course!\n\nAnd your favorite dessert?\n\nI am not a huge dessert person, I am much more “hungry” for salty things like french fries. But if I had to choose a favorite dessert, I would say mochi ice cream – a relatively recent discovery.\n\nI saw the last recipe you posted on your cooking blog Impatient Foodie is a recipe of grandfather Roberto … where does your passion for food come from?\n\nAs I mentioned, my passion has always been the environment and sustainability. However, I was never able to find my place in those worlds. I don’t see myself as a politician, or someone who could run an NGO, or a lobbyist, or an environmental lawyer. Through my Master program, I came to see that food is the way I can interact with issues that matter to me. Food touches everything that keeps me awake at night – human rights, carbon release and sequestration, water usage, the fossil fuel industry, animal rights, ocean heath, and beyond. Becoming more aware about how my food choices and consumer habits had an impact on all of those things was a real wake up call for me and inspired my passion for food.\n\nHow we can love food and at the same time have an enviable line as yours? Give up something, do lots of physical activity?\n\nI do love to be active. I have to do something active every day, or I go a little crazy. Whether that means going for a run, or maybe a swim, or doing a yoga class… just some kind of movement. New Yorkers are also known to walk A LOT. Sometimes I walk 5-7 miles a day and I don’t even realize it. I do eat a lot, but I don’t eat a lot of sugar. I do crave things like fries and I let myself have them, but then I’ll make an adjustment somewhere else in the day to accommodate. For example, I’ll have fries with lunch, but then I’ll make the adjustment not to have pasta for dinner. Maybe I’ll have a salad instead, or grilled vegetables with a little bit of stracchino or pesto. It’s all about moderation and balance, I think.\n\nDo you had fun shooting this short movie with Frette?\n\nYes, it was really fun – turns out that I love doing shoots at home!\n\nTell me your beauty secrets and how you relax.\n\nI have very sensitive skin and after YEARS of trying different products, I finally found one that works for me – Arbonne. Their products are truly gentle and have a strict ingredient policy that I appreciate. To relax, I love to watch movies in bed or read. I also have really gotten into meditation this year and try and do that at least once a day. I started at 10 minutes of meditation a day. Now if I can swing it, I’ll meditate for 45 minutes to 1 hour (something I never thought I’d be able to do!)\n\nAnd a dream that came true?\n\nWhite water rafting and camping in Idaho this summer with my father this summer was the absolute perfect trip and a real dream come true."
