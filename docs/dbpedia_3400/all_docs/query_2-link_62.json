        "text": "Paul D. Wiedemann, of Middletown, DE, formerly of Clinton, NJ, passed away on Thursday, October 27, 2022, at the age of 81. Paul was born in The Bronx, NY on April 5, 1941, to the late Paul F. Wiedemann and Elizabeth Wiedemann.\n\nPaul met his wife, Patricia Bartels, while working at Colgate Palmolive Company in Manhattan, prior to joining the United States Army. His tour of duty in the United States Army was from 1961-1967 as an MP in the 533rd MP Company stationed in Kaiserslautern, Germany during the Cuban crisis. Later on, he was promoted to Provost Marshall Investigator. Paul returned home from Germany in 1962 and married Patricia in Dobbs Ferry, NY. He and Patricia then returned to Germany to complete his tour of duty. While in Germany, their son, Paul Richard was born.\n\nOnce his tour of duty was complete, he started a career in sales, which he found exciting and fulfilling. His career involved several moves including New York, Maryland, California, New Jersey, and ultimately residing in Middletown, DE. Former colleagues and dear friends affectionately referred to him as The Doc, for if you had a problem, see The Doc, as he has the prescription. He was a known business problem solver. Paul’s last employment for 24 years was at Chevron/Ortho Information Services where he became National Accounts Manager. He was responsible for major book accounts, such as Walden, B. Dalton, Crown Books, Random House Publishing, in addition to Wal-Mart, Lowes, Costco, Home Depot, and other big box garden/home improvement supply outlets.\n\nPaul would often say, “We make a living by what we earn, but a life by what we give”. While residing in New Jersey he volunteered at food pantries in Flemington and High Bridge. When moving to Delaware, in its early stage of growth he volunteered with various committees at Springmill, a 55+ active community. One of the committees that brought him great satisfaction was being the chairperson of the Charity Committee. The efforts of the committee and those who donated provided much relief to people in need, and included such organizations as the Jean Birch MOT Senior Center, The Neighborhood House, American Legion Post 25, along with other worthy charities from the local area.\n\nAside from volunteering, Paul enjoyed finance, and political involvement as a lifetime Republican. In his leisure time, he looked forward to dining at great restaurants.\n\nPaul is survived by his loving wife of 60 years, Patricia; son, Paul R. Wiedemann and his wife, Marzanna of Belvidere, NJ; daughter, Donna C. Blanton and her husband Christopher of Bridgewater, NJ; and 5 grandchildren, Sarah, Chloe, Lindsey, Ashley, and Paul John.\n\nA funeral mass will be held at St. Bernard of Clairvaux Church, 500 Rt. 22, Bridgewater, NJ on Saturday, November 19, 2022 at 10:00am. A private memorial service will be held at Spicer-Mullikin Funeral Home, 275 E. Main Street, Middletown, DE on December 9, 2022 with interment to follow at Delaware Memorial Veterans Cemetery."
