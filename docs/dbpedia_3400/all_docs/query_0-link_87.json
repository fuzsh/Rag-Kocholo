        "text": "\"My Name Was Martha\"\n\nChapter 1\n\nTHE POEM ITSELF:\n\nTEXT AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe manuscript of Martha Moulsworth's \"Memorandum\" occurs in a commonplace book (Osborn MS fb 150) currently housed in the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Although the pages on which the poem appears are unnumbered, the work occurs near the end of the manuscript volume. The poem is preceded by many blank pages, although most of the other texts included in this commonplace book are political in nature. Moulsworth's poem is written in a neat, relatively clear hand from the early seventeenth century. Whether the handwriting is her own is uncertain. [NOTE TO THE ON-LINE EDITION: THE HAND IS PROBABLY THAT OF A SCRIBE.] In the following transcription, line numbers have been added in square brackets. Brackets have also been used to set off the various marginal notes that run alongside the manuscript version of the poem itself; these notes were apparently composed by Moulsworth. In the transcript, punctuation and spelling have been left unchanged, and in the few places where a word is missing, crossed out, or corrected, these facts have been appropriately indicated.\n\nThe symbol (†) beginning a line indicates the presence of a note pertaining to that line in the \"Textual Notes\" section, pp. 9-12.\n\nNouember the 10th 1632 †The Memorandum of Martha Moulsworth Widdowe The tenth day of the winter month Nouember A day which I must duely still remember did open first theis eis, and shewed this light† Now on thatt day* vppon thatt daie I write [ORIGINAL MARGINAL NOTE TO LINE 4:]\n\nNouember 10th 1632 This season fitly willinglie combines [5 the birth day of my selfe, & of theis lynes† The tyme the clocke, the yearly stroke is one thatt clocke by ffiftie fiue retourns hath gonn How ffew, how many warnings itt will giue he only knowes in whome we are, & liue [10 [my muse is a tell\n\nclocke, & echoeth[?]\n\neuerie stroke wth\n\na coupled ryme\n\nso many tymes\n\nviz 55\n\nActs 17 28 &[?] In carnall state of sin originall I did nott stay one whole day naturall The seale of grace in Sacramentall water so soone had I, so soone become the daughter of earthly parents, & of heauenlie ffather [15 † some christen late for state, the wiser rather. † My Name was Martha, Martha tooke much payne\n\n[ORIGINAL MARGINAL NOTE IN MANUSCRIPT NEXT TO LINE 17:]\n\nLuke 10: 14† our Sauiour christ hir guesse [sic] to entertayne God gyue me grace my Inward house to dight† that he with me may supp, & stay all night [20 [ORIGINAL MARGINAL NOTE IN MANUSCRIPT NEXT TO LINE 20:]\n\nReuel: 3.20: My ffather was a Man of spottles ffame [ORIGINAL MARGINAL NOTE IN MANUSCRIPT NEXT TO LINE 21:]\n\nLuke 24.29 of gentle Birth, & Dorsett was his name He had, & left lands of his owne possession† he was of Leuies tribe by his proffession his Mother oxford knowenge well his worth [25 † arayd in scarlett Robe did send him fforth.

This is one of the few cases in the MS where the handwriting has proven difficult to decipher. Clearly the word is a verb, and \"echoeth\" best fits the handwriting and makes the most sense in context. \"Tell clocke\": according to the OED, one who \"tells the clock,\" meaning \"to count the hours as shown by a clock; hence, to pass one's time idly.\" The final part of the Biblical citation is also unclear and thus concludes with an added question mark in boldface. Probably the phrasing intended was \"&c\" (i.e., \"etc.\"). That is, Moulsworth clearly alludes to Acts 17: 28, but she may also find the following few verses relevant to her meaning: \"For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.... he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained\" (Acts 17: 28-31). Interestingly, one of those who responded to Paul's call in this instance was \"a woman named Damaris\" (Acts 17:34).\n\n16: \"for state\": with a view toward public dignity, pomp, and ceremony; \"rather\": earlier\n\n17: Moulsworth seems to have misremembered or miscopied the location of the reference to Martha, which should be Luke 10: 41. In context the passage reads as follows: \"Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman, named Martha, received him into her house. And she had a sister, called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet, and heard his word. But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her, therefore, that she help me. And Jesus answered, and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou\n\nart careful and troubled about many things. But one thing is needful, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her\" (Luke 10: 38-42). St. Martha was traditionally considered the \"prototype of the busy housewife.\" See J.C.J. Metford, Dictionary of Christian Lore and Legend (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1983),168.\n\n18: \"guesse\": guest.\n\n20: \"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me\" (Revelation 3: 20). The next scriptural citation also seems relevant to this line: \"But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them\" (Luke 24: 29).\n\n24: \"Leuies tribe\": among the ancient Hebrews, the Levites were a religious caste descended from Levi, son of Jacob. They held no portion of land in Canaan (Deuteronomy 18). Perhaps this fact is relevant to Moulsworth's claim in 1. 23 about her father's lands. Presumably he was a clergyman of some sort.

I understand also that an English bill is depending before you in the Court of Exchequer preferred by one William Gerrard against Moulsworth and Southworth, which I am informed is but matter of molestation, because the suit is not brought against them by due form of law.... As I am not willing to entreat for any favour if they have evil demeaned themselves, so am I unwilling they should endure unjust molestation for their employment in my farm, or be hindered from his Majesty's service.... I knowing well what is fit to be recommended to persons in your place, who are to proceed upon proofs and not allegations, do only in general show you my desire to have them favoured as far as is reasonable.\" Well before he married Martha, then, Moulsworth seems to have been a man who enjoyed some influence and connections.

His holiday falls on 26 December.\n\n81-82: 28 October. \"Apart from appearing in lists of the Apostles and being present at Pentecost, Simon receives scant attention in the [New Testament], but legend links his later exploits with those of St. Jude.

J. S. Brewer, 6 vols.

They continued: \"Therefore, in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? For they all had her. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God. For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like the angels of God in heaven\" (Matthew 21: 23, 28-30).\n\n105: \"a threefold cord is not quickly broken\" (Ecclesiastes 4: 12).\n\n107: For the proverb \"seldom comes the better,\" which was widely current in the sixteenth century, see Morris Palmer Tilley, A Dictionary of the Proverbs in England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1950), 46.\n\nTHE POEM AS WORK OF ART\n\nThe importance of Martha Moulsworth's \"Memorandum\" as an historical document should be obvious: as one of the few early modern texts in which a woman speaks for and of herself, the poem would be of interest even if it possessed little poetic merit.1 Fortunately, however, Moulsworth's poem possesses considerable value in its own right, as a work of art—as a thoughtful demonstration of linguistic skill, thematic coherence, and structural design. Moulsworth seems to have wanted to do more than set down the main events of her life; she obviously wanted to impose on those events (or to find in them) a significant shape and meaning.2 The mere fact that the poem is so obviously patterned in its larger structure—with fifty-five couplets to complement Moulsworth's fifty-five years—invites attention to other patterns of meaning, other indications of design. As it happens, such design and patterns abound; Moulsworth was obviously a highly self-conscious, conscientious writer who sought quite deliberately to exploit many of the rhetorical resources of her language.3 Her poem's texture is thick with assonance, alliteration, word-play, meaningful ambiguities, and other devices of sound and meaning. It reveals a fondness both for balanced syntactical units and for sudden, ironic juxtapositions. Indeed, sustaining and recovering balance are two of the poem's most important implicit themes; the work displays both artistic and emotional equilibrium.4 In fact, the first sort of balance helps reinforce and convey the second; the maturity and wisdom of Moulsworth's tone and attitude are at once reflected and created through the careful craft with which her poem is put together. Moulsworth plays with words, but she rarely does so in ways that seem simply self-indulgent. In her poem as in all accomplished works, artistic skill both registers and reinforces meaning. Only a close reading of the \"Memorandum\" can begin to do justice to its aesthetic complexity.\n\nTime—its passage, pains, joys, and redemption—is one of the most obvious organizing themes of Moulsworth's poem. She calls attention to this theme through repeated references to days, months, years, and seasons, and she continually alludes to Biblical and secular history to provide a larger perspective on her own\n\nexperience.5 Certainly the theme of time is powerfully emphasized in the poem's opening line, a line typical of Moulsworth's larger work in both its subject and its style. The poem's very first words stress a specific date, a specific moment in the present in a work later preoccupied with the past and future. Characteristically, Moulsworth accentuates the importance of this particular moment through balanced syntax, using one adjective-noun phrase (\"tenth day\") to balance and reinforce another (\"winter month\"; l. 1). Pairing the phrases gives each a force it would separately lack, and, as will be seen, this kind of syntactical equilibrium is utterly typical of Moulsworth's style throughout the poem. The tactic appears again, for instance, not only in the repetition of \"day\" in l. 2, but also in l. 3, where Moulsworth explains how this date did not only \"open first theis eis,\" but also \"shewed this light.\" Just as the birthday of the author coincides with the creation of the poem, so the beginning of mental perception coincides with the moment of physical revelation. In a poem so much concerned with death, Moulsworth begins by emphasizing literal and figurative life—the birth of the body as well as the awakening of the senses and consciousness. Yet this emphasis on new beginnings is also framed by the opening reference to \"winter\"—the first of many references to the seasons, but also a reference that reinforces the poem's stress on endings, on the conclusions of natural cycles. The birth of both Moulsworth and her poem in \"the winter month Nouember\" is at once literally true and richly symbolic; her life began in the midst of a season associated with death, and the poem that sums up that life takes shape in both a literal and a figurative winter.\n\nBalanced pairings continue to be important features of the poem's first few lines. Such pairings not only emphasize the sense of equilibrium so important to the poem's larger mood, but they also highlight the distinctive importance of each pair's elements. Pairing the words invites us to notice their differences as well as their similarities, so that each word achieves maximum impact. This is true of such pairings as \"fitly willinglie\" in l. 5, \"my selfe\" and \"theis lynes\" in l. 6, \"clocke\" and \"stroke\" in l. 7, \"ffew\" and \"many\" in l. 9, and especially \"are\" and \"liue\" in l. 10. That last pairing stresses God's role as both creator and sustainer—the Being Who permits our being and Who also undergirds our continued existence. It hardly seems an accident that\n\nMoulsworth's first reference to God occurs in l. 10, since ten was a number traditionally associated with perfection and order.6 Numerological patterning is obviously important to this poem, in which fifty-five couplets parallel the author's fifty-five years. Thus it seems highly appropriate that Moulsworth's first reference to God, and her particular emphasis on his powers of creation and sustenance, should occur in a line numerically suited to both subjects.\n\nSuch numerical patterning is only one of many ways in which Moulsworth seeks to impose an order on the story of her life—or rather, to discern the shapes and orders her life implies. The balanced structure of the poem contributes to its mood of calm equilibrium, and certainly another of the work's prominent features also suggests this notion of a life lived within a larger scheme of significance. This feature involves the poem's many explicit Biblical allusions. In using these, Moulsworth is hardly subtle; in fact, she does everything possible to call attention to them, not only echoing specific Biblical phrasing but also providing precise marginal citations of book, chapter, and verse. The first of these, in l. 10, aptly coincides with the first explicit reference to God; the allusion to Acts 17: 28 reminds us that \"in him we live, and move, and have our being.\" By invoking the Bible so insistently and repeatedly, Moulsworth reinforces an idea she has already strongly implied—that as she is the author of her poem, so God is the author of her life. Just as she fashions a text from her existence, so the full meaning of her existence is continually illuminated by the text (the Bible) already fashioned by God. Moulsworth proves herself an intent and diligent reader of the scriptures, but her poem also suggests the ways in which the scriptures have already read—or made sense of—her life. Part of the calm, calming effect of Moulsworth's poem derives precisely from this sense that she does not need so much to impose an order on her biography as to discover and elucidate the order it already implies.7\n\nTypical of Moulsworth's use of balanced juxtapositions is the shift that occurs between lines 10 and 11. No sooner does she remind us that she is one of God's \"offspring\" (Acts 17: 29) than she immediately also reminds us that she was scarred from birth by \"sin originall\" (l. 11). Typically, the line emphasizing her fallen condition is itself balanced, with the adjective-noun phrase\n\n\"carnall state\" paired off against the noun-adjective phrase \"sin originall.\" Typically, too, Moulsworth immediately balances the reference to original sin with a reference to holy baptism; it was thanks to baptism that she \"did nott stay one whole day naturall\" but achieved the \"seale of grace in Sacramentall. water\" (ll. 12-13). The quick shift from the emphasis on sin to the even more emphatic stress on redemption parallels the quickness with which Moulsworth's parents acted to have her baptized, and this speed is itself stressed through the balanced repetition of \"soone\" in l. 14. By the same token, such balance is stressed again in l. 15, in which she refers to herself as the daughter \"of earthly parents, & of heauenlie ffather.\" Similarly careful phrasing is evident in the next line, in which \"state\" echoes \"late\" to reinforce, perhaps, the concern with external display that Moulsworth implicitly criticizes (l. 16). Here as elsewhere in the poem, she distinguishes her own experiences and the motives that shaped them from those of others, but she does so in an understated way that exemplifies self-content rather than contempt or pride.\n\nIn this as in so many ways, her poem displays the balance it extols. Such balance, for instance, is also exhibited by the way this six-line section of the poem closes. Line 16 juxtaposes the notions of \"late\" with early (\"rather\") christening, but by explicitly emphasizing christening, the line also implicitly balances the stress in l. 11 on the \"carnall state of sin originall.\" Moreover, line 16 suggests both a concern with death and an answer to it, and death, of course, will soon prove one of the poem's most prominent themes. Here that theme is merely implied; later it is much more obviously emphasized. For the moment, however, Moulsworth is cunningly subtle in the ways she broaches the notion. Typical, for example, is the understated but nonetheless somewhat startling use of the past tense in l. 17, where the author first brings her earthly identity into the text itself: \"My Name was Martha.\" By referring to herself in the past tense, especially before she has even properly narrated the story of her life, she already implies a distanced perspective on that life and an acceptance of her eventual death, but also a desire to speak to posterity, to leave behind some token of her existence. Through the simple word \"was,\" Moulsworth communicates a remarkably complex set of attitudes and emotions. One word helps create one of the most af-\n\nfecting and poignant moments of her poem, since the very line that introduces her by name also anticipates her prospective demise.\n\nThe careful craft of Moulsworth's poem is evident again in her reference to her namesake, the Biblical Martha. She reminds us how \"much payne\" that Martha took to prepare her home for a visit by Christ, \"her guesse\" (and, in another nice example of balanced phrasing, \"our Sauiour\" [ll. 17-18]). Moulsworth might at first seem proud of her predecessor, suggesting their similarity by implying their mutual devotion to God. Yet the allusion ultimately suggests a firm but understated distinction between their conduct. Thus when the Biblical Martha criticized Mary for neglecting her housework, Christ himself reminded Martha of the need to focus on the more important work of personal salvation. Moulsworth tries to internalize this lesson, asking that \"God gyue me grace my Inward house to dight / that he Wth me may supp, & stay all night\" (ll. 19-20). Her balance here is typical: God must first give the grace that will permit Moulsworth to prepare herself for him. Here as elsewhere in her poem, she expresses an ideal of mutual, reciprocal love. Moreover, the balanced pairing of \"supp, & stay\" similarly epitomizes her style: she desires not simply a dinner guest but a lodger, someone who will not simply be fed but who will feed, someone who will stay with her throughout the long \"night\" of her present loneliness, her future death, and her ultimate existence in eternity.8 What might at first have seemed a proud allusion to the Biblical Martha becomes instead a reminder, both to Moulsworth and her readers, to emphasize inner rather than external preparations. Yet while the Biblical Martha had explicitly criticized Mary, Moulsworth nicely refrains from openly chastising the Biblical Martha. Instead, she practices the very lesson Christ preached, focusing on her own spiritual relations with him rather than on unimportant externals or on faulting others. Her subtle invocation and use of the scriptures relating to Martha typify the thematic and stylistic finesse of her entire poem.\n\nHaving just beseeched the assistance of her heavenly father, Moulsworth now describes the character and assistance of the earthly father who so greatly influenced her life. In her typically balanced way, she describes him as a man both \"of spottles ffame\" and \"of gentle Birth\" (ll. 21-22), but here again the\n\npaired phrases emphasize an important distinction. Moulsworth clearly privileges her father's virtue and moral worth over the accidental circumstance of his birth into the gentry. Obviously she values his social standing, but she emphasizes that his reputation depended more on his own \"spottles\" character than on his family's rank. Indeed, the very phrase \"spottles ffame\" suggests the balance Moulsworth so frequently achieves: her father's internal worth (or spotlessness) led to his external, public recognition. Similar balance is achieved by juxtaposing verbs when Moulsworth reports that her father \"had, & left lands of his owne possession\" (l. 23). The pairing once again implies his social status (by referring to the lands he inherited), but it also once again highlights his own talent and character, since he supervised those lands well enough to leave them to his descendants. Moulsworth's father was thus both fortunate and skilled; he owed his prosperity both to lucky circumstances and to wise management. (See Addendum.)\n\nYet in addition to being practical and pragmatic, he was also a man of spiritual and intellectual wisdom, and these are the qualities Moulsworth especially stresses. She tells us that \"he was of Leuies tribe by his profession\" (l. 24)—that is, some sort of clergyman. (See Addendum.) The reference to \"Leuie's tribe\" is not a rhetorical indulgence; rather, it allows Moulsworth to emphasize with subtle wit her father's status as a landowner, since the Biblical Levites were a tribe unique in being landless. Here as elsewhere, Moulsworth does not simply cite the Bible in any thoughtless, mechanical fashion; rather, she uses her allusions to give her own phrasing added resonance and meaning. But it is not only the Bible that Moulsworth cleverly echoes; she also glances back at previous phrasing from her own poem. Thus 1. 25 opens by describing her father's connection to Oxford University, which is called \"his Mother.\" Both the phrase and its placement look back to 1. 21, which had opened by referring to \"My ffather.\" Just as Moulsworth was nurtured and taught by a literal male, so her father was trained and encouraged by a figurative female, an alma mater which, \"knowenge well his worth / arayd in scarlett Robe did send him fforth\" (ll. 25-26). Then, in a shift highlighted by typically parallel phrasing, this reference to Moulsworth's father being sent forth by Oxford is immediately followed by a reference to Moulsworth herself being \"brought vpp\" by him (l. 27).\n\nBoth the shift and the parallel epitomize the poem's consistent emphasis on balance.\n\nThe fact that Moulsworth fails to mention her mother or any siblings only accentuates her crucial relations with her father. Perhaps her mother died before Moulsworth could develop much memory of her, and perhaps the same was true of any brothers or sisters. (See Addendum.) Or perhaps Moulsworth was an only child whose mother had little influence on her life. Obviously these and other possibilities are purely speculative. The important fact for Moulsworth's poem, however, is that she stresses the connection with her father. This emphasis is obviously relevant to the whole poem's thematic stress on her relations with males. Clearly the first of these relations, with her father, had an extraordinary impact on her life and her sense of self. It is typical, again, of the poem's equilibrium that her father, nurtured by \"his Mother oxford,\" then himself nurtured the intellectual and moral development of his daughter, who then in turn calls for the founding of a new university to nurture other women. Behind the entire poem lies an ideal of reciprocal respect and mutual love, and certainly such love seems to have characterized her link with her father. Thus it hardly seems an accident that she mentions first that he trained her up \"in godlie pietie\" (l. 27), since this phrase suggests their mutual obligations to the heavenly father they shared. Such religious values precede and make possible the more narrowly personal and social characteristics stressed in the next line, where Moulsworth mentions the \"modest chearefullnes, & sad [steadfast] sobrietie\" her father inculcated (l. 28). Here again balance is important, not only in the pairing of the two nouns but also in the way, for instance, that \"modest\" modifies \"chearefullnes.\" A sense of poise characterizes Moulsworth's poem as much as it seems to have characterized her view and habits of life.\n\nEqually characteristic, however, is the sudden juxtaposition stressed by the abrupt opening of l. 28, where Moulsworth emphasizes that her father encouraged not \"onlie\" such traditionally feminine virtues as piety, chearfulness, and sobriety. Rather, \"Beyond my sex and kind / he did Wth learning Lattin decke [my] mind\" (l. 30). (See Addendum.) The abruptness of this shift is underlined by the equally abrupt opening of l. 31: \"And whie nott so?\" This phrase simultaneously echoes the opening of l. 28 (\"Nor onlie so\") while\n\nalso balancing Moulsworth's earlier tone of modesty and deference. Appropriately enough, her challenging question illustrates precisely the intellectual independence her father sought to instill. (See Addendum.) Paradoxically, the poem reaches one of its most obvious emotional high points in this passage defending women's access to the world of reason—a fact that indicates just how much Moulsworth valued the right to learn.9 However, the balance that characterizes the entire poem immediately reasserts itself in the following clauses, which humorously defuse the anger possibly implied by the preceding question. By claiming that, after all, \"the muses ffemalls are / and therfore of Vs ffemales take some care\" (ll. 31-32), Moulsworth shifts from a defensive, accusatory question to a good-natured joke. Yet the joke has a poignant edge, since it implicitly acknowledges that the figures supposedly most concerned with feminine achievement are, after all, merely mythical.\n\nPerhaps this is why the very next lines shift tone once more, switching from the playful reference to the muses to a much more serious protest and proposal: \"Two Vniuersities we haue of men / o thatt we had but one of women then\" (ll. 33-34). After first toying with the notion of depending on the imaginary muses, Moulsworth now gets down to hard practicalities. Typically, here again her tone is balanced. She keeps her proposal modest: just \"one\" school for women is all she requests. Typically, too, her request balances strong emotion (\"o\") with a reasoned conclusion (\"then\"). Moulsworth proposes an innovation that would have seemed quite radical at the time, but her initial tone seems modestly moderate. Line 34 can be read as an expression of both suppressed anger and genuine anguish, but in either case the emotion is ballasted by the logic emphasized by the concluding word, \"then.\" That word implicitly appeals both to her readers' reason and to their sense of justice, and l. 34 seems all the more effective for being so carefully balanced, for holding so many tones in tension.\n\nIn a characteristic shift, the tone of the immediately succeeding lines is less restrained and more obviously assertive. The parallels in phrasing between ll. 34 and 35 (\"o thatt ... then\"; \"O then thatt\") only emphasize their different moods. Moulsworth now confidently proclaims that a university for women would certainly excel both \"in witt, and tongs\"—a typically balanced\n\nphrase suggesting both native intelligence (wit) and its expression in language. Indeed, she claims that a women's university would \"surpasse / All art of men thatt is, or euer was\" (l. 36). This is a surprisingly sweeping assertion that suggests both strong assurance and clear frustration. If Moulsworth's language seems a bit boastful or immodest, that fact partly reflects her belief that women have been denied the right to prove their full potential. What might seem arrogant instead suggests a willingness to be challenged, to be put to the test, to be given the opportunity to compete on fair and equal terms. The very feistiness of Moulsworth's tone suggests her eagerness for a chance to submit to exacting standards. Her assertion does not reject the \"art of men\" but in fact affirms its value. Moulsworth merely insists that women should have the right to test their strengths in free and open competition. Therefore, what might seem boastfulness instead attempts merely to challenge the preexisting, complacent arrogance of men who simply assume their superiority.10 By making such a provocatively sweeping claim for feminine ability, Moulsworth dares males to put her claim to the test. Then, even if her assertion of superiority proves false, she has still won the larger and most important point: the right to equal education.\n\nThe balanced construction of Moulsworth's poem is evident again in the shift to l. 37: \"But I of Lattin haue no cause to boast.\" Moulsworth checks any pride possibly conveyed by l. 36, but she does so in a way that suggests that her pride there was more in the potential of her sex than in her personal accomplishments. Line 37 suddenly drops us from an audaciously imagined future to an unfortunately actual present. Yet Moulsworth's suddenly more modest tone itself seems complicated as soon as we realize that her linguistic shortcomings resulted not from lack of talent but from lack of encouragement. Thanks to \"want of vse,\" she \"longe agoe ... lost\" her command of Latin. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this passage is its relative freedom from either self-pity or rancor. Moulsworth simply states a fact, and her words are all the more stinging for being so restrained. Her wry marginal comment (\"Lattin is not the most marketable mariadge mettall\") balances wit, resentment, humor, and pain, and this complicated mix of tones enters the poem itself in ll. 39-40: \"Had I no other portion to my dowre / I might have stood a virgin to this houre.\" The humor of these lines cannot disguise the frustra-\n\ntion they also imply; Moulsworth manages to create a tone combining resignation, acceptance, protest, and wit. The very creation of her poem is part of an effort to elude the limits she describes.\n\nMoulsworth's three-fold repetition of the word \"virgin\" in ll. 40-42 typifies her clever creativity. Her fanciful reference to the powerful but imaginary \"virgin Muses\" (l. 41) is framed by the all too practical references in ll. 40 and 42, which remind us that in early modern culture, a \"virgin\" was first and foremost an unattached and thus relatively powerless woman. Although Moulsworth professes \"love\" for the \"virgin Muses\" (l. 41), she also realizes that too exclusive a devotion to them would have left her \"a virgin to this houre\" (l. 40). It is hardly surprising, then, that she claims to \"haue longe since Bid virgin life ffarewell\" (l. 42). Both lines, with their emphasis on the passage of time, reinforce one of the poem's most important larger themes. In addition, however, the word \"ffarewell\" suggests both relief at having escaped the real limits imposed on early modem spinsters and, perhaps, also a frank enjoyment of marital relations.\n\nMoulsworth's attitude toward married life exhibits the same balanced combination of idealism and practicality that typifies her entire poem. She expresses affection for the \"virgin Muses\" while also accepting the need to marry. Indeed, just as ll. 40-42 thrice emphasize the word \"virgin,\" so the succeeding three lines thrice emphasize her three marriages—a detail that once again exemplifies the poem's balanced construction. In fact, similar balance also exists within and between the latter three lines. Thus l. 43 emphasizes the considered action of Moulsworth's \"Right hand,\" which \"did holly wedlocke plight,\" while l. 44 emphasizes her \"Left\" hand as the object of her husbands' considered actions, since it three times \"with pledged ringe was dight\" (l. 44). The parallel phrasing of these lines symbolizes the ideal concord and harmony of a successful marriage, and such harmony is suggested again in the symmetrical syntax of l. 45: \"three husbands me, & I haue them enioyde.\" Much is implied by the emphasized verb; \"enioyde\" simultaneously suggests physical, emotional, and spiritual satisfaction, and thus in all three senses it looks back to the earlier implications of having bade \"virgin life ffarewell\" (l. 42). Moulsworth's poem manages to suggest that marriage was at once a culturally prescribed role and a source of\n\ngenuine personal pleasure. The balanced phrasing of l. 45 is then in turn immediately echoed in l. 46 (\"Nor I by them, nor they by me annoyde\"), which is itself symmetrically constructed. Here as elsewhere, equilibrium reigns.\" 11\n\nSuch balance is also apparent, for instance, in ll. 47-48. The first line describes Moulsworth's three husbands as \"all louely, lovinge all, some more, some lesse.\" Whereas \"louely\" demonstrates Moulsworth's complex appreciation of her husbands' attractions, both of body and of character, \"lovinge\" suggests in turn the affection they displayed. Yet no sooner does she offer this \"all\"-embracing compliment than she immediately modifies it with the phrase \"some more, some lesse.\" Thus each half of l. 47 is itself balanced, and then both halves are immediately balanced against one another. The result is a complex assessment of her husbands—an assessment that extols their virtues while also hinting at their shortcomings. Moulsworth combines charity and truth, idealism and realism, and here as elsewhere her measured language enhances her credibility. Her tone seems neither cynical nor naive, and her love seems all the more genuine by seeming so mature. Yet the depth of her love is no sooner established than the death of her loved ones is abruptly announced (l. 48). Even here, however, balanced phrasing imposes a shape on loss. Moulsworth immediately shifts from announcing the absence of her husbands (they are \"gonn\") to stressing her continued affection for them: \"their loue, & memorie I blesse.\" Thus the line ends by emphasizing not so much the loss of love as its transformation.\n\nHaving briefly sketched the history of her married life, Moulsworth now proceeds to fill in the details. Not until she was twenty-one years old, she tells us, did she \"bind\" herself in marriage (l. 50). Her intriguing verb suggests both agency and passivity, the simultaneous exercise and loss of freedom. Thus even in her use of single words, Moulsworth manages a complex balancing act. Balance is also evident in the very next line, which begins with Moulsworth seemingly admitting, \"My springe was late\" (l. 51). Immediately, however, this apparent concession is withdrawn: it turns out that this is only the subjective opinion of \"some ... thatt sooner loue.\" What seems to begin as a valid generalization soon stands revealed as the merely parochial and self-interested judgment of others. Both the structure and tone of this line typify Moulsworth's subtle self-assertion and self-con-\n\nfidence. In fact, the next line, beginning with the assertive contradiction \"butt,\" immediately refutes potential critics: \"backward springs doe oft the kindest proue\" (l. 52). Here as elsewhere Moulsworth demonstrates a quiet firmness. Just as she had earlier anticipated and answered presumably male criticism of her childhood learning (l. 31), so here she responds to presumably female criticism of her delay in marrying. Moreover, her double emphasis on spring in ll. 51-52 ties into the whole poem's encompassing emphasis on the progress of time and on the seasons of life. Few words in this poem seem wasted; in one way or another, everything fits.\n\nThe thematic emphasis on time already implied by the double references to \"spring\" becomes explicit in l. 53: \"My first knott held fiue yeares, & eight months more.\" Such precision typifies Moulsworth's concern with mutability, and this keen awareness of time passing adds weight to her larger concern with eternity. Once again balance prevails: Moulsworth seems to have lived her life fully aware of its duration and various stages, but also with a sure sense that its moments were unfolding as part of a larger scheme. She refers very precisely to the exact lengths of her successive marriages and periods of mourning, but her precision hardly indicates self-obsession. Rather, it seems a way of paying tribute to the loved ones with whom she shared her time—time she seems not to have regarded as trivial or unimportant. The repeated references to marriage and mourning contribute to the poem's larger rhythms of relation and separation, birth and death, love and longing. Our sense of this rhythm is intensified, for instance, by the fact that two couplets are allotted to each of Moulsworth's first two husbands, and that each of those couplets is itself divided into lines dealing first with marriage and then with widowhood. However, having established this balanced couplet rhythm in dealing with her first two husbands, Moulsworth breaks it in dealing with her third.\n\nMoulsworth's first pair of marriages are called respectively a \"knott\" and a \"bond\" (ll. 53; 55), and her husbands are not described, but rather are just mentioned. These patterns change, however, when she comes to discuss her latest, longest, and presumably last marriage; here the emphasis immediately shifts both to her own choice (\"The third I tooke\"; emphasis added) and to her final husband's traits (\"a louely man, & kind\"; l. 57).\n\nBy describing his traits as she does, she echoes the distinction first asserted in l. 47 between character and behavior, between the sort of persons her husbands were and the ways they treated her (\"louely, lovinge\"). However, by calling her third husband \"louely,\" she also prepares for the immediately ensuing line: \"such comlines in age we seldome ffind\" (l. 58). Here Moulsworth demonstrates a typically balanced view: she implies her appreciation of her husband's appearance and of his personality. Such phrasing reinforces the sensual implications of her earlier claim that she had been \"enioyde\" by her three husbands and had also enjoyed them (l. 45). Her emphasis on her third husband's good looks seems especially poignant since we know that she writes as a widow, now denied the physical presence she still affectionately remembers. Her emphasis on his \"comlines\" suggests a frank enjoyment of the body in a poem that elsewhere stresses the spirit. Such phrasing typifies the practical, this-worldly element of Moulsworth's character—an element that makes both her poem and her persona seem so completely balanced and sound.\n\nMoulsworth's frank concern with worldly accoutrements is similarly evident in her next lines, which emphasize her third husband's lineage and social standing: \"ffrom Mortimers he drewe his pedigre / their Arms he bore, not bought wth Heraulds fee\" (ll. 59-60). Clearly this passage expresses some pride in her connection with this man of rank, and clearly, too, Moulsworth is at pains to stress the legitimacy of his (and her) social standing. As in her earlier references to her father's \"gentle Birth\" and \"lands of his owne possession\" (ll. 22-23), so here Moulsworth writes not simply as a woman but as a woman of some privilege and status. She rejects some aspects of the patriarchal social system (as when she criticizes the limits it imposes not only on women's learning but also on the value of such learning), but she also shares many of the assumptions that underlie patriarchal thinking.12 To say this is not to criticize her; she never pretends to be a social radical. Even her call for educational equality does not fundamentally challenge traditional values; instead, it asks only that women also be allowed to imbibe and display such values. It would be naive, anachronistic, and unfair (not to mention pointless) to judge Moulsworth's seventeenth century \"feminism\" by the standards of a latter day. Her conservative attitudes about questions of class combine with her more assertive attitudes\n\nabout the rights of women, and the combination illustrates, again, the complicated equilibrium that her poem everywhere exhibits. It is possible, of course, to see such equilibrium as unsteady and rife with contradictions, but it seems best to understand the poem's balance before deconstructing it.\n\nSuch balance is obviously intended and evident, for instance, in the immediately following lines: \"third wife I was to him, as he to me / third husband was, in nomber we agree\" (ll. 61-62). These lines are balanced both in syntax and in sound (especially in the strong \"e\" sounds stressed in each line's final syllables), and the reiterated emphasis on the idea of \"nomber\" clearly fits one of the poem's larger patterns. This emphasis is underscored again, for instance, in the next line's reference to the \"eleuen years, & eight months\" that Moulsworth was able to share with her third husband. She aptly describes this period as his \"autume\" (l. 64), since it not only ended in his death but also encompassed the natural later stages of his life. With nice subtlety, she omits any reference to winter when describing the passing of his physical life; instead, she prefers to assert that \"a second spring to soone awaie it hasted\" (l. 64). Her phrasing here nicely looks back to 1. 51, where she acknowledged that her own \"springe\" had been \"late.\" The echo only makes her later phrasing all the more poignant. By describing her husband's death as his \"spring,\" she clearly alludes with Christian confidence to the notion of dying as a second birth, a renewal or resurrection; yet by immediately asserting that his death happened \"to soone,\" she typically balances spiritual confidence with a restrained, wistful expression of pain or regret. The reference to his \"second spring\" thus seems not an easy, pious clicHé but rather a means of coping with her loss.13\n\nNo sooner does she mention that loss than she shifts, in typical fashion, to a celebration of him and of their union: \"was neuer man so Buxome to his wife / wth him I led an easie darlings life\" (ll. 65-66). If the first half of this couplet stresses her husband's conduct, the second emphasizes the pleasure Moulsworth herself derived from his behavior. By calling him \"Buxome\" she manages to suggest both his authority (his graciousness and indulgence) and his voluntary restraint (his humility and compliance with her own desires). Thus even her use of single adjectives displays the equilibrium so typical of her poem. The line that im-\n\nmediately follows may seem to violate such balance, since it seems to emphasize self-assertion (\"I had my will in house, in purse in Store\"; l. 67). However, this line also implicitly acknowledges the limits, the circumscribed boundaries, of Moulsworth's domain. Her husband allowed her a great deal of authority within the confines of her domestic role, and in this case, at least, Moulsworth seems to have been content with the status dictated by her sexual identity: \"what would a women old or yong haue more?\" (l. 67). Thus the very passage in which she might seem to assert herself also suggests the limits to her self-assertion.14 In addition, of course, the phrasing \"old or yong\" exhibits another kind of balance even as it reinforces the poem's larger concern with the passage of time.\n\nThat concern with time is reiterated once more in the next couplet: \"Two years Almost outwearinge since he died / And yett, & yett my tears ffor him nott dried\" (ll. 69-70; emphasis added). Here the reference to her husband's death is no longer fanciful or figurative (as in l. 64's \"a second spring\"). Rather, Moulsworth's language is now as blunt and unsparing as the mortality she describes. The double emphasis on \"yett\" not only lends l. 70 a nice syntactical balance, but it also powerfully underscores both Moulsworth's sense of pain and her surprise that her pain continues to be so intense. Her immediate shift from death to birth (\"I by the ffirst, & last some Issue had\"; l. 71) exemplifies the kind of balanced juxtapositions her poem so often displays, and in fact it seems a nice coincidence that even her child-bearing should have been evenly distributed between her \"ffirst, & last\" marriages.\n\nHowever, no sooner does she tell us about her children than she informs us of their loss: \"butt roote, & ffruite is dead, Wch makes me sad\" (l. 72). A single death is emphasized in ll. 69-70, only to be followed immediately by references to multiple births (l. 71), and then those references are themselves immediately juxtaposed with references to the multiple deaths of both \"roote, & ffruite\" (l. 72). This last phrase clearly looks back to the equally balanced \"ffirst, & last\" in the preceding line, yet Moulsworth uses the internal rhyme of \"roote\" with \"ffruite\" to achieve not only balanced sound but also obvious irony. The rhyme emphasizes the extent of her current isolation; not until this point do we discover that she is not simply a widow, but a childless widow at\n\nthat.15 Given this fact, her claim that the deaths of her husbands and children make her \"sad\" seems deliberately restrained rather than inept or trite. The word \"sad,\" of course, reminds us of the earlier passage describing how her father had attempted to instill in her a \"sad sobrietie\" (l. 28), and certainly, in alluding to her present isolation, Moulsworth must exercise the emotional self-control her father seems to have prized.\n\nOne indication of such self-control appears in the poem's following passage, one of the longest in the work (ll. 73-97). In this section, Moulsworth details the actual deaths of her husbands and connects their passings to larger religious patterns and to broader Christian themes. Thus, she no sooner expresses her sadness at the way death has touched her life than she also attempts to place her experience in a larger context that will help give it significance and thereby lessen her pain. She begins with the seemingly paradoxical observation, \"My husbands all on holly dayes did die\" (l. 73)—a fact she seems not to have considered coincidental or meaningless, and one that also fits well with her poem's whole thematic emphasis on precise points of time. To a modern secular reader, the deaths of all three of her husbands on sacred days might seem merely ironic, but Moulsworth seems to have considered it not only consoling but also symbolic of the ways in which events in God's universe are not random, chaotic, or pointless. This notion is immediately reinforced in the next line, with its typically balanced rhetoric: \"Such day, such waie, they to the Saints did hye\" (l. 74). The stress on death in the preceding line is followed immediately by an emphasis on resurrection, on salvation, on an escape to a better life. That emphasis, in turn, is then immediately balanced by a line that stresses quotidian experience (\"This life is worke-day euen att the Best\"; l. 75), but then that line itself is followed by another with an off-setting theme: \"butt christian death, [is] an holly day of Rest\" (l. 76).\n\nThe oscillating, qualifying pattern evident in ll. 73-76 typifies the way Moulsworth's whole poem works, its whole emphasis on balanced pairs. This emphasis is clear not only in the structures of lines but in the treatment of individual words and phrases, Thus, \"worke-day\" (l. 75) is clearly balanced by \"holly day\" (l. 76), and in fact the very reference to \"worke-day\" is itself framed by two references to \"holly dayes\" (in ll. 73 and 76)\n\nthat help place quotidian events in a properly diminished perspective. Similarly, the adjective in the two-word phrase \"This life\" (l. 75) already implies a heavenly alternative, just as the adjective in \"christian death\" already modifies and lessens the importance of the noun. Even the opening of l. 76, with its strong emphasis on the conjunction \"butt,\" looks back to the similar opening of l. 72 (\"butt roote, & ffruite is dead\"). In the second instance, however, the sudden shift signaled by \"butt\" introduces consolation, not distress. Such equilibrium typifies both the larger structure and the smallest details of Moulsworth's poem.\n\nThis sort of balance is evident again, for instance, in the clever repetition and alliteration embedded in l. 77 (\"the ffirst, the ffirst of Martirs did befall\"), in the related alliteration of l. 78 \"(St Stevens ffeast to him was ffuneral\"), and in the combined repetition, variation, and alliteration of the ensuing couplet (\"the morrowe after christ our fflesh did take / this husband did his mortall fflesh fforsake\"; ll. 79-80). Given Moulsworth's intense interest in providential and poetic patterning, it hardly seems coincidental that she should stress that her \"second\" husband died \"on a double sainted day,\" and that he \"tooke his happy way\" both \"to Jude, & Symon\" (ll. 81-82). Her reference to \"an auncient Story\" (l. 83) about St. Simon establishing English Christianity may at first seem digressive, but it allows her to contrast this questionable legend with the certainty of \"holy writt\" (l. 85). She thus demonstrates some intellectual sophistication even as she underscores her firm faith, and by emphasizing the need of each Christian to \"Mayntayne, & ffight for\" the faith (l. 86), she contrasts the remote past with the immediate present and juxtaposes the broadly general with the specifically personal. Her recounting of her husbands' deaths thus evolves into a meditation on her own and others' mortality. In her typically balanced way, she assures us that those who \"liue, & die\" while maintaining the Christian faith \"may well / hope wth the Saints eternally to dwell\" (ll. 87-88). On the one hand, this last phrasing looks back to l. 74, which had stressed how all her husbands \"to the Saints did hye.\" However, ll. 87-88 also isolate her accounts of her first and second husbands' deaths, setting off the description of her most recent bereavement. In death as in life, her third husband is subtly distinguished from his predecessors. Moulsworth's account of his passing and of his posthumous fate is\n\nfar more elaborate, vivid, and emotional than her description of her first two husbands' passings.\n\nWhen Moulsworth describes her third husband's death as having occurred \"in that season wch doth bringe / vppon dead Winters cold, a lyvlie Springe\" (ll. 91-92), she effectively plays on a pattern of seasonal imagery that has been building since the poem's very first line. Clearly, too, such phrasing contributes to the even broader theme of passing time that helps organize her entire work. In a similar fashion, juxtaposing the adjectives \"dead\" and \"lyvelie\" typifies the poem's balanced phrasing, and all of these traits come together in the equally balanced rhetoric that prophesies a coming moment of literally physical resurrection:\n\nHis Bodie winteringe in the lodge of death\n\nShall ffeele A springe, Wth budd of life, & Breath\n\nAnd Rise in incorruption, glorie, power\n\n[corrin: 15: 42\n\nLike to the Bodie of our Sauiour\n\nWhereas Moulsworth had earlier spoken merely of her own \"hope\" someday \"wth the Saints eternally to dwell\" (l. 88), she speaks here with far more certainty and assurance in imagining her husband's revival. Her parallel phrasing emphasizes the three verbs \"winteringe,\" \"ffeele,\" and \"Rise,\" the two clauses \"lodge of death\" and \"budd of life,\" the alliterative nouns \"budd\" and \"Breath,\" and the three triumphant nouns \"incorruption,\" \"glorie,\" and \"power.\" In addition, this whole passage is framed by references first to her husband's \"Bodie\" and then to the \"Bodie of our Sauiour,\" so that a projected future resurrection is guaranteed by reference to one already past. Moulsworth's confident handling of poetic details seems to underscore the spiritual confidence she explicitly professes. Although this passage is one of the most obviously heart-felt in the whole poem, it is also one of the most artful and controlled.16\n\nCharacteristically, Moulsworth immediately juxtaposes this moment of high personal emotion with a shift in subject and in tone. She switches from firm confidence in her third husband's\n\nbodily resurrection to uneasy uncertainty about her exact relations with him or her other spouses in the afterlife:\n\nIn vayne itt were, prophane itt were ffor me\n\nWth Sadness to aske wch of theis, three\n\n[Matt: 22.18\n\nI shall call husband in ye Resurrection\n\nSuch questioning would be \"vayne\" in the double sense of being futile and presumptuous, and Moulsworth underscores the point by rhyming \"vayne\" with \"prophane\" to suggest a pride that is also impious or irreverent. Yet this expression of patient humility is balanced by the confidence and assurance implied by \"shall\"—a word that suggests understated trust that Moulswourth, too, will participate in the general \"Resurrection\" (l. 99). Yet such trust implies less a confidence in her own merit than a faith in God's mercy.\n\nMoulsworth's confidence in divine grace seems evident, again, in the way she automatically assumes that \"then shall all in glorious perfection / Like to th'immortal heauenlie Angells hue\" (ll. 100-01). She almost seems to take for granted her future perfection (a point nicely implied by the conjunction \"ffor\" [l. 100], which gives the notion an air of inevitability). However, this trust in her own eternal happiness in fact expresses her confidence in God's love and forgiveness of \"all\": just as Moulsworth seems to have regarded herself as blessed in her relations with the important men in her life, so she also seems to have imagined God as another nurturing, loving male. Her serene survey of her past reflects her assured anticipation of her future. She seems to have regarded her life with quiet satisfaction because she also seems to have felt little fear of death. Given her constant preoccupation with numbers and patterning, it hardly seems surprising that her celebration of a future \"glorious perfection\" should be voiced in l. 100. The number 100 had, of course, long been associated with plenitude and completion;17 the fact that Moulsworth prophesies the achievement of spiritual perfection in her poem's one hundredth line only suggests again how she tries to emulate God's sense of order in a literary creation of her own.\n\nAs that creation winds to its close, Moulsworth subtly echoes phrasing from earlier in the poem; this tactic gives her poem an\n\neven greater sense of symmetry and completion than it might otherwise have had. Thus her reference to \"th'immortall heauenlie Angells\" (l. 101) looks back to l. 80, which had mentioned how her first husband \"did his mortall fflesh fforsake.\" Similarly, when Moulsworth says of the angels that they \"wedlocks bonds doe neither take nor giue\" (l. 102), she reminds us simultaneously of earlier references to her second marriage (\"My second bond\"; l. 55) and to her third husband (\"The third I tooke\"; l. 57). By the same token, the very balance of the phrase \"neither take nor giue\" typifies the symmetries that so strongly characterize Moulsworth's entire poem, and when she refers to the possibility of \"knittinge\" a potential \"fourth knott\" (l. 104), she not only plays with the similar sounds of verb and noun but also glances back at her very first marriage (\"My first knott\"; l. 53). Moreover, the double emphasis on \"knittinge\" and \"knott\" nicely prepares for the Biblical allusion called up by the immediately ensuing reference to \"A threefold cord\" (l. 105), just as the somewhat mysterious reference to \"Another Auncient storie\" (l. 106) reminds us obviously and deliberately of the earlier reference to \"an auncient Story\" (in l. 83). In all these ways, Moulsworth demonstrates an explicit attention to her poem's developing structure—an awareness already strongly implied. The poem's pervasive sense of equilibrium is manifested not only in its individual lines, sounds, and phrases, but also in the final shape it displays.18\n\nAs has just been shown, part of that shape involves the way the poem circles back on itself, picking up earlier words, themes, and tactics and giving them one last airing. Thus her closing reference to \"Widowehood\" (l. 108) looks back directly to the title with which her poem began (\"The Memorandum of Martha Moulsworth / Widowe\"), just as her concluding reference to \"the Virgins life\" (l. 109) directly echoes the phrasing of l. 42 (\"I haue longe since Bid virgin life ffarewell\"). Similarly, it hardly seems surprising that a poem punctuated by powerful questions (as in ll. 31 and 68) should also close with one (\"whie should I / then putt my Widowehood in jeopardy?\"; ll. 107-08). If Moulsworth's first question had displayed frustration at the lack of proper schooling for women (\"And whie nott so?\"; l. 31), and if her second had in contrast displayed satisfaction at her treatment by her third husband (\"what would a women old or yong haue more?\"; l. 68), her third displays a different kind of satisfaction alto-\n\ngether. As both her life and her poem worked toward their endings, Moulsworth seems to have felt content with the autonomy her widowhood allowed her. Whereas her first and second questions seem to have been directed outward (first at male and then at female readers), her third query seems to have been directed mainly at herself, and perhaps secondarily at society in general. Although a question in the strict grammatical sense, line 108 has the effect of resolving doubts rather than of raising them.\n\nIt seems fitting that a poem so much concerned with recounting the past should end by emphasizing the present and future—what Moulsworth nicely calls \"the Meane tyme\"; l. 103. In the course of her poem, this poet expresses both loss and hope, both regret and anticipation, but her final note is me of contentment, of acceptance of the here and now (\"the Virgins life is gold, as Clarks vs tell / the Widowes siluar, I loue siluar well\"; ll. 109-10). How appropriate it is that her work should end with a few last balanced oppositions (between gold and silver, between virginity and widowhood, and between the opinions of others and an opinion of her own). Yet how appropriate, too, that the poem's very last words should stress the resolution of such opposites. It hardly seems surprising that these last words express such equanimity and self-assurance, such subtle self-assertion. Nor does it surprise us that Moulsworth ends by emphasizing not simply \"loue,\" but a love and self-respect so firmly felt. She finishes her poem as she seems to have lived her life—in a spirit not of resignation but of acceptance. She does not simply acquiesce in her fate; instead, she willingly embraces it. In her final words as in her entire poem, she conveys a tone of perfect balance.\n\nIt is difficult to finish Moulsworth's poem without feeling respect for both its artistry and its author. The work displays both craft and freshness, both conscientious design and simple dignity. Its tone is complex but never chaotic or confused, and Moulsworth's achievement—as a poet and person—seems all the more impressive considering the constraints she faced as a writer who was also a woman. However, one needn't apologize for the poetic quality of her work: it stands as a worthy and accomplished text, firmly embedded in concrete historical contexts which it nevertheless in many ways transcends.19\n\nNotes\n\n1. Germaine Greer notes that numerous \"women who versified in their youth destroyed the evidence when they came to riper years and lost their privacy by marrying.\" See her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod: An Anthology of Seventeenth-Century Women's Verse, ed. Germaine Greer, Susan Hastings, Jeslyn Medoff, and Melinda Sansone (New York: Farrar Straus Giroux, 1989), 6. The destruction of women's verse makes Moulsworth's poem all the more valuable, and it is additionally interesting that Moulsworth wrote her poem at the end of her life, after the deaths of her husbands, during a time when she presumably enjoyed greater personal autonomy.\n\n2. Similarly, Sara Mendelson notes that \"a common trait displayed by female diarists was the urge to impose some comprehensible order upon the fortuitous incidents that made up their lives\"; see her essay \"Stuart Women's Diaries and Occasional Memoirs,\" 186.\n\n3. In The Paradise of Women, Betty Travitsky notes that the only discernible difference between Renaissance women's prose and poetry is that sometimes the latter displays a \"more conscious striving for artistic effect\" (18). Certainly this seems true of Moulsworth's \"Memorandum.\"\n\n4. In The Paradise of Women, Betty Travitsky reports that most of the religious poetry written by the women she has studied is \"intensely partisan,\" a fact that makes Moulsworth's balanced, generally tranquil tone all the more noteworthy.\n\n5. Germaine Greer notes that the \"pious of both sexes were often required to keep a spiritual diary,\" and one way of viewing Moulsworth's poem might be to see it almost as a surnmation or epitome of her spiritual life. See Greer's \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, 12.\n\n6. See, for instance, J.C.J. Metford, Dictionary of Christian Lore and Legend (New York: Thames and Hudson, 1983), 240.\n\n7. Sara Mendelson notes that the \"providential interpretation of life's accidents which moulded contemporary spiritual diaries\" could help \"transform an outwardly dull and unhappy life into scenes of high drama, punctuated by hairbreadth escapes\n\nfrom death or damnation.... Many of these daily balance sheets seem to have had a cathartic as well as an interpretive function.... Sometimes this confessional purpose of the diary could lead to exaggerated expressions of guilt for minute lapses, so that the author could be sure she had settled her spiritual account for the day.\" See \"Stuart Women's Diaries and Occasional Memoirs,\" 186-87. Moulsworth's poem, of course, is not a diary, but its tone of calm assurance and lack of spiritual hyperbole are nevertheless two of its most striking features.\n\n8. It may be worth noting at this point Mendelson's observation that some Stuart women's diaries reveal \"an emotional involvement with God which goes far beyond the allegorical relationship that clerics presumably had in mind. Among certain women with no husband or an extremely unsatisfactory one, some sort of erotic transference seems to have taken place.\" See \"Stuart Women's Diaries and Occasional Memoirs,\" 195. Moulsworth's phrasing might be read as suggesting a hint—but only a hint—of such transference; here as elsewhere her phrasing is understated and subtly suggestive.\n\n9. In The Paradise of Women, Betty Travitsky suggests that secular manuscript writings by women may indicate a \"high degree of interest\" in writing and a \"hard-won erudition\" (90).\n\n10. Linda Woodbridge notes that in fact formal defenses of women were more numerous in the Renaissance than outright attacks, although she tends to regard both defenses and attacks as mainly literary gamesmanship; see Women and the English Renaissance: Literature and the Nature of Womankind, 1540-1620 (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1984), 44; 111; 129. Moulsworth's poem suggests that some women, at least, took the controversy seriously. For a collection of highly relevant texts, see Katherine Usher Henderson and Barbara F. McManus, eds., Half Humankind: Contexts and Texts of the Controversy about Women in England, 1540-1640 (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1985). See also Joan Larson Klein, ed., Daughters, Wives, and Widows: Writings by Men about Women and Marriage in England, 1500-1640 (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1992).\n\n11. Helen Wilcox notes that Lady Anne Halkett's memoirs were structured around her own relations with the three different\n\nmen to whom she was romantically attached. See her essay \"Private Writing and Public Function: Autobiographical Texts by Renaissance Englishwomen,\" in Gloriana's Face: Women, Public and Private, in the English Renaissance, ed. S.P. Cerasano and Marion Wynne-Davies (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1992), 47-62; for the fact about Halkett, see 50.\n\n12. For a similar case, see Angeline Goreau's comment on Anna Maria van Schurman (1607-78), a Dutch woman who in 1641 \"published a treatise arguing that women ought to be allowed a classical education.\" Still, Goreau concludes her discussion by noting that van Schurman \"is an interesting example of the way in which a woman could challenge certain social restrictions that applied to her sex, and yet defend equally restrictive assumptions at the same time-either explicitly or implicitly.\" See The Whole Duty of a Woman: Female Writers in Seventeenth Century England (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1985), 164-65. For a similar point concerning Shakespeare's presentation of women, see Linda Woodbridge, Women and the English Renaissance, 216-17. See also the concluding argument by Margaret George in her book Women in the First Capitalist Society: Experiences in Seventeenth-Century England (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 254.\n\n13. In her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, Germaine Greer comments that the \"attempt to versify on religious themes was a discipline intended to focus concentration on well-worn pious truisms\" (12). Part of the interest of Moulsworth's poem is that she manages to make such truisms seem vital, both to herself and to her readers.\n\n14. Helen Wilcox reports that \"generally Renaissance women risked a distinctly unwanted reputation by entering the public sphere, particularly in areas less well sanctioned for feminine activity than charity and nursing.\" She notes, however, that it \"was quite common for a woman tomanage the financial and even legal affairs of a household. ...\" See \"Private Writing and Public Function,\" 53.\n\n15. In her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, Germaine Greer reports that \"perhaps 45 per cent of middle- and upper-class women died before reaching the age of fifty and more than half of them of complications of pregnancy\" (11). These data make the\n\nfact that Moulsworth survived all her husbands and children seem even more striking.\n\n16. In her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, Germaine Greer comments that among \"the genres a literate gentlewoman might be expected to master was the farewell to her husband about to be widowed. Such a poem was intended to display deep love and fortitude, with control and resignation mimetically conveyed by lucid, balanced syntax uncontorted by demands of rhyme or metre\" (11). Moulsworth's poem displays many of the qualities Greer specifies, yet her work is a \"farewell\" to her husbands written by a widow who has survived them all.\n\n17. See, for instance, George Ferguson, Signs and Symbols in Christian Art (New York: Oxford University Press, 1954), 278.\n\n18. In her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, Germaine Greer cautiously suggests that certain \"syntactic patterns\" tend to characterize much of the verse written by early modem women. These include \"endless chains of clauses which may be related back and forwards with equal justification, rather than a hierarchy of main clauses with obvious subordinates\" (9). Meaningful ambiguity is sometimes a feature of Moulsworth's phrasing, but in general she seems to have been quite concerned with the clarity of her poem's structure.\n\n19. In her \"Introduction\" to Kissing the Rod, Germaine Greer comments that much religious poetry by early modern women \"was intended to remain private; most of the women who versified as part of a religious exercise had no interest in communicating their individual experience to outsiders; the poems ... are usually laborious and dull\" (13). Moulsworth may or may not have hoped that her poem would be published; some of her phrasing (such as the call for equal education) certainly suggests an interest in influencing readers. In any case, Greer's final comment gives us a standard for assessing the literary merit of Moulsworth's poem, which seems accomplished and thoughtful rather than \"laborious and dull.\"\n\nChapter 2\n\nHISTORICAL CONTEXTS\n\nA standard claim concerning Renaissance women is that their lives were structured chiefly by their relations with men. According to this claim, early modem women generally moved through a predetermined pattern of social roles—living first as daughters, then as wives, and finally often as widows. Even variations from this pattern helped confirm the norm: a spinster, after all, was simply an unmarried woman; a nun was a bride of Christ. One virtue of studying the lives of Renaissance women in terms of this larger pattern is that the pattern itself is not an anachronistic imposition. It seems, in fact, to have been a standard way for early modern women themselves to understand and express their own experiences.1 Certainly this seems true of Martha Moulsworth. Her highly structured poem is organized quite clearly in terms of her successive roles as daughter, wife, and widow, yet her poem also indicates the actual complexity of such roles and how they might be subject to change or even challenge.2\n\nIn Moulsworth's case, the challenge, of course, mainly involves the issue of womens' education; her poem is one of our earliest records indicating that \"ordinary\" women themselves were beginning to chafe at and protest against the limits on their right to leam.3 The fact that Moulsworth's protest seems not to have been widely known, and that it was never issued in print, hardly diminishes its importance. Indeed, the relative privacy of Moulsworth's vigorous objections may suggest not only the subtle ways in which intelligent opinion was beginning to evolve, but also both the constraints on and movement toward new habits of thought and behavior. Fascinating as a complex work of art, Moulsworth's poem is equally interesting as a complicated reac-\n\ntion to—and expression of—the various roles that women could play in early modem culture. By looking at Moulsworth's poem against the background of recent scholarship dealing with issues of women's education, and by examining her poem in light of Renaissance attitudes toward daughters, wives, and widows, we can better appreciate the special interest of her \"Memorandum\" as both a work of art and an historical document.\n\nI. Women and Education\n\nIt is easy—perhaps too easy—to generalize about Renaissance attitudes toward women. \"The Renaissance\" itself, of course, is merely a handy label for an enormously long and complex period that not only witnessed many debates, but that has also generated many more disputes among the scholars who have subsequently studied it. In fact, the subject of women was itself a frequently debated topic during the Renaissance, and this is only one reason why we should be careful about making broad or sweeping claims about the period's \"typical\" views. In the end, Renaissance culture consisted of individual persons whose individual attitudes were likely to have been shaped by particular experiences.4 Moulsworth herself is one such case, and perhaps the most sensible way to approach her poem historically is to view it against the spectrum of possible ideas and behavior available to her. Then we will be in a better position to appreciate the special features of her \"Memorandum\" and its part in the complex mosaic of Renaissance life.\n\nFor most readers, the most interesting aspect of Moulsworth's \"Memorandum\" is likely to seem its explicit call for higher education for women:\n\nTwo Vniuersities we haue of men\n\no thatt we had but one of women then\n\nO then thatt would in witt, and tongs surpasse\n\nAll art of men thatt is, or euer was. (ll. 32-36)\n\nHistorical investigation suggests that Moulsworth's call was indeed unusual. Standard histories of Renaissance women cite various views from the period about the goals and limits of women's education, but the phenomenon of an English woman her-\n\nself calling so early and unambiguously for women's universities seems to have been rare if not unique. In 1639, it is true, a book entitled The Complete Woman generated controversy by arguing strongly that women were just as capable as men of being educated. Translated from a French work written by Jacques Du Bosc (first published in 1632 as L'Honneste Femme), The Complete Woman was never reprinted in England. Joan Larson Klein suggests that this was \"in part perhaps because of the uncertainties of civil war, in part perhaps because of the controversy it generated over its elevation of women to a position of equality with men\" (257). According to Klein, Du Bosc's book \"certainly appeals more to twentieth-century sensibilities than does any other [Renaissance] conduct book\" she cites (258), yet even Du Bosc seems silent on the subject of university training for women. Moulsworth, then, would seem to enjoy the distinction of being one of the first English females to tackle this topic—and to tackle it so bluntly—in a poem.5 Both her \"Memorandum\" and Du Bosc's book seem part of the same general mind-set, the same general movement of thought, but Moulsworth's poem is all the more intriguing for having been written by an English woman herself at such an early date.6\n\nMoulsworth, of course, was neither writing nor thinking in a vacuum. As Ralph A. Houlbrooke notes,\n\nFrom the sixteenth century onwards, a succession of writers, in England as elsewhere, claimed that women's mental abilities, properly developed, were the equal of men's. Women themselves complained of their exclusion from education, devised by men in order to secure their own continued domination, in both The Woman's Sharpe Revenge of 1640 and in Hannah Woolley's The Gentlewoman's Companion (1675). The conservative feminist Mary Astell argued in A Serious Proposal to the Ladies (1697) that women's improvement was frustrated by bad education, custom, and the low and wrong aims proposed to them, especially the attraction of men as an end in itself. Better-educated women would indeed be more interesting companions for their husbands, but above all better fitted for their paramount responsibility, the religious education of their children. So while she sought to free women from the tyranny of fashion and custom, Astell insisted that the family was their\n\nproper sphere; they had no business with \"the Pulpit, the Bar or St. Stephen's Chapel . . . .\" (99)\n\nThus, as Houlbrooke and many other scholars make clear, Moulsworth was not alone in chafing at the educational limits imposed on women.7 Significantly, however, all the sources Houlbrooke cites post-date Moulsworth's poem, and the gaps in time are often quite long. Moreover, even the \"feminists\" Houlbrooke does quote make claims that seem modest compared to Moulsworth's call for a female university, and in fact Houlbrooke concludes by remarking that \"Despite their reiterated demand for better female education, none of the English feminist writers of our period [1450-1700] proposed a major extension of woman's role\" (99). Moulsworth, then, would seem to be the exception who proves the rule. Her claim that the achievements of university-educated women \"would in witt, and tongs surpasse / All art of men thatt is, or euer was\" (ll. 32-36) seems remarkably forthright and sweeping; she seems to have set no limit on how fully women might develop their minds if given half a chance.8\n\nReason's Disciples, Hilda L. Smith's study of seventeenth-century English feminists, also suggests the unusual significance of Moulsworth's call for higher education. Moulsworth is nowhere mentioned in Smith's book, yet Smith provides valuable evidence that helps us appreciate the importance of Moulsworth's poem. Although almost all most of Smith's \"feminists\" come from the latter half of the century, she argues that one of their core beliefs was the assumption \"that women were men's intellectual equals whose potential had been thwarted by exclusion from institutions of higher learning\" (4), and she shows that a few of these post-Restoration feminists \"argued for the establishment of a woman's college, advanced secondary schools for girls, and the furtherance of learning by women in their own homes\" (4). Like Houlbrooke, she also emphasizes the importance of Mary Astell—noting, for instance, that in 1694 (Houlbrooke had said 1697), Astell's Serious Proposal to the Ladies \"continued the demand\" (made by a few other recent writers) \"for quality education for women, even calling for the establishment of a women's college\" (14). Astell's public declaration was indeed important, even if her proposals were rather modest (as Houlbrooke claims). Yet Moulsworth's \"Memorandum\" preceded Astell's book by more than sixty years. The point is not to deny Astell any credit, but rather to indicate\n\nthat the ideas she expressed may have begun to take root, perhaps even in a fairly radical fashion, among ordinary women decades earlier than has previously been assumed.\n\nSmith argues, in fact, that it was the \"gap in educational opportunities between men and women [that] most angered the feminists. The educational opportunities were limited for women at both ends of the social scale\" (20).9 Although some women established informal contacts with university scholars, \"it would simply have been unthinkable for them to have attended institutions of higher education as students\" (Hilda Smith 21). However, as Moulsworth's poem clearly indicates, the idea of university education for women was indeed quite thinkable—if still very impractical—fairly early in the century, and at least one relatively ordinary woman had thought about the topic quite seriously. As a matter of fact, the data Smith presents may help to explain why Moulsworth and other women were becoming increasingly frustrated with the limits imposed on their right to learn. Smith contends that while the educational status of Englishwomen remained relatively stagnant, \"educational opportunities for Englishmen were expanding in expanding in two different directions during the early and mid-seventeenth century\" (21). She reports that there was \"signficant growth in numbers of university students,\" and that this growth \"took place both among poorer students ... and among the children of the gentry\" (21). Indeed, \"the number of students gaining first degrees grew sixfold between the 1520s and the 1620s, the period of fastest growth in Oxford's entire history, and advanced degrees increased proportionately\" (22).10 From such facts Smith concludes that although \"feminists born after 1660 did not experience these patterns of change, they were equally or even more conscious of the central social truth they represented: universities were open to men who had less ability and were from lower social strata than many of the women who were systematically denied an advanced education\" (23). Because Smith focuses mainly on feminists from later in the century, she suggests that the \"largest growth in the numbers of men entering the universities and the greatest educational agitation occurred before the seventeenth-century feminists wrote\" (22). Yet this statement now seems too categorical: Moulsworth's previously unpublished poem provides us with the response of an intelligent woman whose life coincided rather precisely with Smith's pe-\n\nriod of \"educational agitation.\" Indeed, Moulsworth lived specifically during the era of the unprecedented expansion of educational opportunities for men that Smith describes. Mary Astell, in the last decade of the century, may have been one of the first English women to call publicly for equal access to higher education, but Martha Moulsworth, at least as early as 1632, seems to have been one of the first not only to entertain the idea seriously, but also to give it vigorous expression.11\n\nOf course, by 1632 the topic of women's education had been a much-discussed matter for many decades, owing in large part to the influence of the English humanists of the early sixteenth century.12 Most histories of Renaissance English women note the impact of humanist thought, although they often disagree about its precise effects. Thus Retha M. Warnicke, in her classic study of Women of the English Renaissance and Reformation, notes that Thomas More, \"Because he established a school in his home for his three daughters, one son, and other youth, ... is usually recognized as the first Englishman to extend humanist training to women\" (17). More's daughter Margaret became \"the perfect female humanist: a devoted daughter, a virtuous and obedient wife, an educator of her children, and [an] esteemed scholar\" (25) who even published a work under her own name (albeit a translation from her father's friend Erasmus). Although by doing so \"she had already exceeded even her father's view of the proper bounds of women's activity\" (25), Margaret More provided an obvious precedent for the intellectual aspirations of a woman like Martha Moulsworth.\n\nII. Women as Daughters\n\nThe close attachments that both Margaret More and Martha Moulsworth felt to their fathers, and the real interest both fathers seem to have taken in their daughters' educations, are particularly intriguing. In fact, it was almost inevitably to her father that a girl with serious educational ambitions would have to turn for guidance. Or rather, it was almost inevitably upon her father's largesse that such a girl would have to depend. Moulsworth's intelligence is impressive, but it might never have been nurtured had she been born to a different father. Thus, even\n\nwhen transcending the traditional limits imposed on females, women such as Moulsworth inevitably depended on men. The deep appreciation Moulsworth expresses for her father seems genuine, but it also suggests the limits of her freedom as a woman.13 She probably would never have attained anything approaching her potential without his assistance or acquiescence. (See Addendum.)\n\nThe precedent Thomas More established in educating his daughters seems to have been followed by other Renaissance fathers. Warnicke argues that Henry VIII, \"who was lauded as the patron of humanism from his succession to the throne, took a personal interest in the education of [Princess] Mary, his only legitimate child at that time\" (33). Similarly, Warnicke also notes that \"it was largely the male relatives of the second generation of women humanists who hired their instructors and who made most of the decisions concerning the content of their academic training\" (107-08). Mothers, in fact, often ignored or opposed their daughters' education (Warnicke 108), perhaps because they felt threatened by it. This fact may help explain why Moulsworth nowhere mentions her own mother, whom she might have been expected to extol. (See Addendum.) Moreover, the precedent established by More and other male humanists may even have provided a direct inspiration to Moulsworth's father—who was, after all, himself a learned man presumably familiar with humanist ideals. If More had won prestige for having raised a learned daughter, perhaps Moulsworth's father shared similar aspirations. In any event, the achievements of both Martha Moulsworth and Margaret More depended not only on innate talent but on good fortune—particularly on the good fortune of having been born into a comfortable family headed by a thoughtful and generous male.14 Moulsworth, of course, clearly recognizes and acknowledges her luck. Her devotion to her father is plain, but it also poignantly testifies to the particularly dependent status women endured in Renaissance culture. Without her father's influence and inspiration, we might never have had her poem. (See Addendum.) Paradoxically, it was partly thanks to the impact of such males that male dominance began to wane. Moulsworth's father at once reinforced, exemplified, and helped undermine and modify his culture's patriarchal traditions.\n\nIn this and in other ways, Moulsworth's experiences illustrate many trends discussed by Elaine V. Beilin in her book Re-\n\ndeeming Eve: Women Writers of the English Renaissance. Beilin argues, for instance, that \"Tudor theorists were at best ambivalent and at worst prohibitive when considering how women might use their education\" (3). Chastity was the womanly virtue most often stressed by humanist educators, particularly by the highly influential Juan Luis Vives. In Beilin's words,\n\nInstead of the free exploration of his world that would lead a man to develop judgment and the virtues suitable for public life and action, a woman would receive pieces of information about the world, filtered through her preceptor whose goal was to make her a chaste wife, mother, and if it so happened, widow.15\n\nMoulsworth's life obviously fits this pattern in many ways, but her strong call (even near the end of such a \"chaste\" life) for equal access to education indicates some real dissatisfaction with such enforced cultural norms. In her own small way, Moulsworth exemplifies the fear felt by many Renaissance opponents of women's education, who claimed (according to Beilin) \"that once a woman began to learn, men would no longer be able to choose her reading lists or prevent her from preferring the pen to the needle\" (11). Although Moulsworth had enjoyed only a brief taste of the kind of classical education the humanists championed (albeit mainly for men), she never forgot its savor. By treating his young daughter with some measure of intellectual respect, Moulsworth's father had helped awaken appetites that never quite died. (See Addendum.) Those yearnings eventually led even so chaste a wife, mother, and widow to express genuine exasperation with the limits she had had to endure.\n\nOn the whole, however, Moulsworth's poem demonstrates (and perhaps was even intended to demonstrate) the standard humanist claim that a certain level of education could only enhance a woman's virtue and companionability. Richard Hyrde, for instance, had argued in favor of teaching women classical languages precisely on the grounds that \"such studies would improve any mind, male or female, and that whereas a woman's mind might wander into evil while only her fingers were busy with sewing, if she learned Greek and Latin, her mind would be fully occupied with good\" (Beilin 15).16 Indeed, Moulsworth's \"Memorandum\" almost seems designed to preempt potential\n\ncharges that an intellectually sophisticated woman would prove anything less than virtuous; Moulsworth protests against the limits placed on women's right to learn, yet she simultaneously exemplifies the companionable ideals that caused some humanists to defend female learning. Her interest in acquiring classical languages goes hand-in-hand with her deep interest in reading scripture, and in this sense she epitomizes the religious emphasis so characteristic of other women writers of this period.17 Beilin notes, for instance, that between 1545 and 1560, fifteen published works of religious prose were either written or translated by women, and she argues that\n\nwhen these few women assumed the roles of teacher, preacher, and witness to the faith, they created the vital link between women's traditional spirituality and their developing literary vocation. The very existence of these works indicates the increasing importance for women of recording their religious experiences and beliefs themselves. (48)\n\nMoulsworth fits this pattern: the self-expression her poem embodies could be justified, in part, because it also expressed the religious values sanctioned by her culture.18 She speaks for herself, but she also speaks for a patriarchal religious system—a system she seems genuinely to have embraced. Just as Moulsworth's relationship with her indulgent earthly father gave her an access to learning denied to many other girls, so her obedience to her heavenly father permitted her to speak as she might not otherwise have done. Her Christianity thus both limited and permitted her mental development and self-expression. Christian doctrine subordinated women in many ways, but it also offered them an authoritative voice and a claim to spiritual (if not social) equality.19 In fact, Beilin's claims about the writings of the female religious authors she discusses might just as easily apply to Moulsworth's poem:\n\nThe scriptural basis of women's writing in this period manifests itself both in the content and the style of their works. Like Anne Askew and other Reformers, they think Biblically, and their writing modulates, often imperceptibly, between Biblical quotations or references and their own words. Almost without exception, they write in the\n\n\"Protestant plain style,\" an unornamented, Biblical English aimed at a universal audience. In some cases, their vivid, colloquial expression suggests that these writers would gladly have joined their brethern in the pulpit. (51)\n\nAlthough Moulsworth's style is not exactly plain (in fact, she seems to have striven consciously for complicated artistic effects), nonetheless her manner is neither fervent nor pompous; she writes with the restraint and authority of a person confident that her basic beliefs give her a right to speak. She seems intent on demonstrating that an educated woman would not threaten but would in fact strongly endorse the fundamental values of her culture. Moreover, the fact that she shows herself so committed to Christian ideals would presumably have helped create sympathy for her desire for access to even greater knowledge.20 Moulsworth's argument on behalf of a women's university may sound radical (and in some senses it obviously was), but there seems little doubt that the school she envisions would not fundamentally challenge the larger religious assumptions of her time. In this sense, her \"Memorandum\" offers both an explicit call for, and an implicit demonstration of, the merits of feminine learning. Her poem quietly but firmly refutes anyone who might claim that women were intellectually handicapped or unsophisticated, even as it affirms many of the most cherished values of her culture.
