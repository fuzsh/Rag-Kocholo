        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY – A U.S. District Court judge on Monday sentenced former Quest companies chief financial officer David E. Grose to 16 years in prison after he misappropriated $1 million of the companies’ funds and helped former CEO Jerry Cash embezzle $10 million.\n\nGrose, 58, also will have to pay $1 million in restitution to Quest Energy Partners and its successor PostRock Energy Corp.\n\nIn a written statement read aloud by his attorney, Grose maintained his actions as Quest CFO were not improper and the fraudulent wire transfers of company funds he made were for legitimate business purposes.\n\n“I would not have jeopardized my position or my family’s well-being for something like this,” Grose said in the statement, read in court by attorney Mack Martin. “I never did anything with the intent of fraud.”\n\nGrose passed Monday’s sentencing hearing as he had much of the lengthy court proceedings in his case – with his head down and reading glasses on, scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Stephen P. Friot chastised Grose from the bench before imposing the sentence on Monday morning, calling Grose’s explanation for his actions “unbelievable in every way” and “wholly unpersuasive.”\n\nAmong Grose’s misdeeds, the CFO accepted more than $800,000 in kickbacks from a Quest vendor over a period of several years, an act Friot said was “one of the most telling aspects of the case.”\n\nGrose used about $400,000 of the kickback money to purchase a home in Edmond.\n\n“You were essentially using your position at a publicly traded company to steal with both hands,” Friot said.\n\nU.S. Attorney Sanford Coats argued Grose’s “sheer greed and audacity” warranted a lengthy prison sentence.\n\n“Mr. Grose literally conducted a crime spree, only he used a pen and a computer instead of a mask and a gun,” Coats said. “He has done nothing at all to accept responsibility for his crimes.”\n\nUnder federal sentencing guidelines, Grose was eligible to serve up to 60 years in prison.\n\nA federal jury in March found Grose guilty of wire fraud charges after he stole $1 million from the Quest companies to invest in a hydrogen fuel cell company.\n\nGrose also helped Cash embezzle $10 million from Quest over several years, arranging for repeated wire transfers from Quest to a bank account controlled by Cash in a check-kiting scheme.\n\nCash was sentenced on Nov. 12 to serve nine years in prison for filing a false earnings report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Friot also ordered Cash to pay Quest and PostRock $5 million in restitution, above and beyond the $7 million he has already repaid.\n\nA third former Quest executive, former purchasing director Brent Mueller, also was convicted for helping cover up Grose’s embezzlement. Mueller was sentenced in May to two years in prison and ordered to pay a $1 million fine.\n\nAlso on Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange approved a $10.01 million class-action settlement for Quest shareholders. The settlement involves several lawsuits shareholders filed against Quest and the companies’ officers after Cash’s and Grose’s misdeeds were discovered and made public, causing shares in the company to lose most of their value."
