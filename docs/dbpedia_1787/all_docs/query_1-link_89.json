        "text": "Grose played 59 sets and had 221 kills, 107 digs, 57 aces, 15 total blocks and a hitting percentage of .248 and he helped the Nipmuc Regional coop team post a 9-4 record. The 6-foot-1, 160-pound junior attends Blackstone Valley Tech. His most memorable moment of the season was defeating Medfield, 37-35, in the first set of their match. “It was a super intense game and a really good win for our team,” he said. Grose played volleyball for the Central team in the Bay State Games. He was named his team’s rookie of the year as a freshman and received honorable mention for the T&G Hometeam All-Star team as a sophomore. Grose enjoys volunteering, fishing and robotics. He plans to study aerospace engineering in college, but hasn’t decided where yet. He is the son of David Grose of Milford."
