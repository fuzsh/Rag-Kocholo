        "text": "Lowell C. Grose of New Boston, passed away on February 13th at the age of 99 ½. He was preceded in death by his parents Leonard and Anna Grose and his beloved Lois.\n\nLowell spent most of his work life in the sales department at Detroit Steel, retiring in 1975. Subsequently, he worked as office manager for Belleville Coal and Ohio Asphalt. Once Lois retired in 1982, their life became very busy indeed - golfing, playing cards with many friends and family, Shawnee State basketball and of course any Golden Bear activities that came along.\n\nLowell served his country in WWII in the 811th Army Ordnance Unit and was posted to England and France from 1942 to 1946. In his younger years he was an active member of Valley United Methodist Church and a Mason for over 70 years.\n\nThe Groses traveled extensively over the years, but the one constant in Lowell’s life was his love of his southern Ohio home. His life can truly be summed up as a life well lived and a life well loved.\n\nSurvivors include his daughters, Lisa (Mike) Stinziano and Lori (Bob) Chrisman. “Papa Honey” was also survived by his grandchildren, Michaelena and Michael (Caroline) Stinziano and great-grandchildren, Cooper, Riley and Gianna.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 1:00 p.m. on Friday, February 17th, at the BRANT FUNERAL HOME IN SCIOTOVILLE with Reverend Ralph Clay officiating. Interment will be in Memorial Burial Park with military honors by the James Dickey Post of the American Legion.\n\nThe family will receive guests at BRANT’S from 10:00 a.m. until Noon on Friday and a masonic service will be conducted by the Western Sun Masonic Lodge at Noon.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made in Lowell's name to the Shawnee State University Development Foundation for the Friends of Shawnee Scholarship. Memorials can be mailed to SSUDF, 940 2nd Street, Portsmouth, OH 45662. Please make check out to SSUDF and include Lowell's name when making the donation. Memorials can also be mad at givetossu.com."
