        "text": "EAST LANSING — First, Mel Tucker called him “Jello.” Which makes sense for Angelo Grose.\n\nBut \"Sugar Weasel\"?\n\nThat was a nickname the Michigan State football sophomore never had before his coach hung it on him. And he was just as confused as anyone over what it meant — at first.\n\n“When he first said (it), I was like, 'Sugar Weasel'?” Grose said Wednesday. “And I just got to thinking, ‘Ah, all right, honey badger, sugar weasel. It's the same thing.’”\n\nDEPTH CHART: MSU gives hints, including new spot for Connor Heyward\n\nDespite some scurrilous definitions for the term floating around the internet, Tucker is complimenting and comparing his young defensive back to former LSU (and current Kansas City Chiefs) star Tyrann Mathieu, aka the Honey Badger. A versatile and tenacious force who delivers big hits on defense and makes electric plays when he gets the ball.\n\nThe type of football player coaches and teammates embrace.\n\n“He doesn't like this when I say it, but he's actually kind of like my little brother,” senior Xavier Henderson said of Grose. “And I don't try to like 'Little Bro' him, you know what I mean, but he's like my little brother. And I got his back for life.”\n\nGrose, who is transitioning from nickel back to playing free safety beside Henderson this season, picked up plenty of nicknames as a four-year player at Mansfield High in Ohio. “Lo,” after the last syllable in his first name. “The Great 8,” after his high school jersey number. And one his coach, Chioke Bradley, had with a similar familial feel to Henderson’s moniker for Grose.\n\nSon.\n\nVOICE OF EXPERIENCE: How MSU players are locked in on Mel Tucker's raspy voice\n\n“I've always felt like the relationship Angelo and I’ve had, I look at it him like a son, that's why I call him son,” said Bradley, who played football at Bowling Green and has coached at Mansfield for 14 years. “The type of kid and player he is, you pick up nicknames like none other. We had a plethora of them.”\n\nBradley let out a big laugh Thursday by phone when he heard the new one Tucker gave to Grose, then began to gush about a player who also picked up the nickname “The Mutant” because of his freakish athleticism and ability to be a high-level contributor on defense, special teams and offense for the Tygers.\n\nGrose finished as runner up for Mr. Football Ohio his senior year and and earned the Division III defensive player of the year by making 112 tackles on defense. He also played wide receiver and running back along with some quarterback while also fielding both punts and kicks, finishing with 1,038 receiving yards and 23 TDs combined on offense and special teams.\n\n“We just never had anybody like that, and I've been coaching here for 14 years,” Bradley said. “I've never seen anybody with skill and savviness like he has. He knew what everybody was supposed to be doing. And he made sure everybody was doing what they were supposed to be doing, he knew where he needed to fit in terms of any of the fits on offense or defense. He knew where he needed to help out at, who needed what help, who didn't need as much.\n\n“He knew when to be — it’s tough to put in words. It's almost like he was everybody's crutch. Whenever you needed a crutch, Angelo was there. Even when you didn't know he was there, he was there. He showed up. I'd never seen it before ever.”\n\nAnd as Mansfield’s third option as place-kicker, Grose dabbled during practice on long field goals. Bradley remembered him nagging the coach to let him kick in a game, so he sent Grose out for a 50-yard attempt against Bedford High in suburban Cleveland.\n\nGrose nailed it. And it didn’t shock Bradley whatsoever. Everything Grose did as a kid, Bradley said, he was good at.\n\nHe had been a star soccer player and wrestler growing up before abandoning those to focus on football and basketball. And when it came to track, Grose won the Boys 14U pentathlon at the national AAU Junior Olympics in 2016 as a freshman. Then during his junior year at Mansfield, the final year he was on the track and field team, Grose competed in the long jump at one meet and delivered one of the most amazing feats Bradley says he’d ever seen.\n\n“He never touched the sand, he landed all the way out of the long jump pit. Have you ever seen that?” said Bradley, who said it ended up being well over 25 feet — the national boys high school record is 26-10, according to trackandfieldnews.com. “He jumped so far that he landed on the track and almost blew his knee out. But he only jumped once (that day), because we wouldn't let him jump again. That was his first jump, and it was his last jump.”\n\nAnd a jump that actually allowed Grose to make the leap from a mid-major recruiting target to a Power Five prospect when Bradley began sending tape to coaches around the country. And Grose took up Mark Dantonio on his dream offer by committing to the Spartans after initially picking Cincinnati.\n\nThen Dantonio left a month after Grose enrolled. If he had concerns, Bradley said he never expressed them to him. He felt Grose picked MSU because he grew up loving watching the Spartans.\n\n“I just took everything in,” Grose said of the coaching change. “It was like, we're here to play football at the end of the day. So whoever's coaching is coaching. Let's play.”\n\nAnd it also didn’t shock Bradley to see Grose become an immediate contributor and favorite of Tucker last season as a freshman. The 5-foot-10, 185-pound Grose impressed MSU’s new staff and played in all seven games. That included starting the final four at nickel back in Tucker’s 4-2-5 secondary, finishing with 23 tackles, two pass breakups, a forced fumble and a QB hurry.\n\n“Yeah, Jello, Jello is that's my guy,” Tucker said at Big Ten media day last month. “I call him the Sugar Weasel — he's a relentless competitor, he has tremendous range, he's got very good instincts, and he lives football. Football is important to him. He's a good teammate. He's not afraid to come up and strike an individual and knock him back. He's a physical player. And he's a guy that has a high football IQ, and he learns quickly. He usually doesn't make the same mistake twice.”\n\nMORE FROM SOLARI: Mel Tucker landing talent, now he must show he can mold it\n\nThat pushed Tucker to swap roles in the offseason with Grose and junior Michael Dowell, who started twice last year at the free safety role his brother David once occupied. Henderson said Grose emerged from last season’s upset win over Northwestern with “a little bit of confidence” that continued to grow with his playing time. And the strong safety added defensive backs coach Harlon Barnett has developed “a lot of trust” in his adopted sibling.\n\n“Angelo's tough as nails,” Henderson said. “He tackles — he'll tackle anything that comes his way. We saw that his first camp, and I was like 'Oh, this kid can play.' He's just a natural football player, and I love having him back there. He tells me he loves having me back there because I'm giving Angelo to call, and he says he doesn't have to worry about anything because I'm telling him what to do. And now he gets to tell other people what to do, the new dudes, because he's learning it himself now.”\n\nThat new role also puts Grose in more of a position to be a vocal leader on the wide side of the field. He said he now must make more calls for the rest of the secondary, something he feels he is continuing to learn during camp leading up to the Sept. 3 opener at Northwestern.\n\n“Basically (Tucker) just came in and it was like, 'We feel like you'll be better at free safety.' And I was like, 'Let's do it, let's go.' I've been there ever since,” he said. “I feel like I'm transitioning well.”\n\nTucker said he believes Grose’s ability to play multiple positions in the secondary helps, particularly as he was initially recruited by Dantonio’s staff as a cornerback. Bradley also played Grose at blitzing outside linebacker in Mansfield’s 3-4 defense as a freshman and sophomore. He got 18 sacks there before moving into the Tygers’ secondary.\n\nBACK IN CAMP: Five looming questions as Spartans enter Year 2 under Mel Tucker\n\n“He's going to provide range in our back end, and he also has cover ability,” Tucker said. “And you need to have that at the safety position because of all the three to four wide receiver sets. If you ever want to play tight coverage and play man to man and be able to get off of it on third down and things like that, your safeties have to be able to cover. Not just off, but they have to be able to press. He brings tremendous flexibility to the back end.”\n\nTucker’s new nickname for Grose has stuck. “Pretty much everybody calls me that now,” he said. And he likes it, since he says he tries to pattern his game after Mathieu.\n\nBut to his high school coach Bradley, he’ll always keep his own special nickname for Grose. Even if he may start calling him “Sugar Weasel” every now and again along with “son.”\n\n“He’s my favorite football player of all-time, and I’ve been in the game pretty much my whole life,” Bradley said. “He’s the best I’ve ever seen.”"
