        "text": "Did you know that being physically #active can reduce your cancer risk by helping you to keep a #healthy weight? Why not set yourself a new challenge this summer and sign up to your local Race for Life event? With hundreds of 3k, 5k, 10k and Pretty Muddy events organised by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) taking place across the UK, there‚Äôs a race for everyone! Whether you‚Äôre #walking or #running your way around the course, or taking on the Pretty Muddy obstacles, the one thing that matters is that you‚Äôre helping to beat #cancer. https://lnkd.in/egR2ja4B\n\nDonna, an ovarian cancer survivor, shares how celebrating every small victory helped her through her recovery. By accepting her limitations and setting up realistic expectations of what she can do, she restarted her favorite hobby: hiking. üö∂‚ôÄÔ∏è Read more about it here: #cancerpatient #cancercare #cancersurvivor #cancersurvivorship #postcancerlife #livingwithcancer #lifewithcancer #cancersupport #cancerrecovery #aftercancer #aftercancercare\n\nI just got my annual mammogram earlier this month because the American Cancer Society reminded me that women over age 40 should be screened annually. I encourage each of you to consider the cancer screenings you need in 2024 and get your appointments scheduled for the new year now! Remember, regular screening increases the chances of detecting certain cancers early, before cancer has a chance to spread. It is a simple action we can each choose to create a healthier future for ourselves and the ones we love! Learn more about cancer screening guidelines at: https://lnkd.in/gecKFU2m\n\nVOICES of Black Women is a pivotal long-term study led by the American Cancer Society to better understand health conditions like cancer and strive for enhanced overall well-being among Black women. I'm so proud to support the American Cancer Society's vision to end cancer as we know it, for everyone. Learn more about VOICES: https://voices.cancer.org/"
