        "text": "Appreciation of and participation in the visual arts has helped bring enjoyment to a year wrought with frustration, stress and isolation.\n\nThat’s the perspective and experience that some of Monroe County’s artists shared as they reflected on the value of creative expression during the past pandemic year.\n\n“Even though we’re not ‘essential,’ in a strange way, we are,” artist and art instructor Betzi Lievens of Lambertville said.\n\n“Art is a creativity and an outlet,” said Lori Goins, whose work as a youth services technician at Ellis Library and Reference Center includes creating story time art projects for children.\n\nDavid Grose of Carleton, who years ago turned painting into his retirement hobby, said art is relaxing. “It gets my mid off all the negatives. This is almost like therapy for me.”\n\nAnd Gathered Creations, an art studio and gift shop in Temperance, actually opened during the pandemic, with its services including art classes in a small group format. “People are connecting. People are resonating with it,” said Mike Fisher, one of the family business owners.\n\nHere’s what those artistic people say about their perspectives and experiences of the past year.\n\nCommissioned works inspired by news events\n\nBetzi Lievens has been a professional artist for the past 15 to 16 years, known for her portraits and large scale abstract work.\n\nOne of the impacts of the pandemic is that in August, she closed her art shop at the Olde Schoolhouse Commons in Lambertville. Lievens said it was difficult to maintain social distancing expectations in her location there. In the meantime, she has learned that some of her former students are no longer pursuing art studies; and are selling their supplies.\n\nBut Lievens has been incredibly busy with her art clients in the past year and is handling a flood of commissioned art requests.\n\n“People were reaching out to me,” she said.\n\nFor example, she has been painting images by request of Supreme Court Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died in September. She has made so many that her children, age 3 and 5, can identify depictions of the late justice. Every single Ginsburg painting has sold.\n\nAnother frequent commission request involved images of Dr. Anthony Stephen Fauci, who became a household name with his expertise on the COVID-19 coronavirus.\n\nAnother sign of the times involved commissioned requests for something appropriate to the background of a Zoom video conference call.\n\nAnd she noticed how many people who bought an art piece from her years ago, reaching out once again for artwork to perk up the indoor spaces where they have been spending so much time.\n\n‘There’s no wrong answer’\n\nThe Monroe County Library System closed its doors to the public in mid-March 2020; and currently is open by appointment with many programs in remote format. Lori Goins said it was not long afterward the initial closing when librarians heard from parents that it was hard to think of things that children could do while following social distancing guidelines.\n\nGoins normally leads the preschool story times on Wednesday; she also has worked with playgroup and special needs audiences at the library. Her take-home projects aimed at students in grades preschool through grade 6 started with STEM – Science, Technology, Engineering and Math – concepts.\n\nThen she pursued other topics for take-home assignments, always tying back to literature themes and a suggested book list.\n\nHer art supply kits include inexpensive materials such as cotton balls or newsprint. The kits are free to library patrons; on a first-come, first-served basis. About 25 are prepared every week. On the rare occasion when they are not all claimed, she sends the leftover materials to a local day care enter.\n\nThe families “have really enjoyed it,” she said.\n\nIn order to inspire creativity, Goins never shows a picture of a finished project ahead of time. She will instead pose an open-ended challenge such as “Can you create a house for a bear?”\n\nThe value of art, she said, is “there is no wrong answer.”\n\nWaiting for normalcy to return\n\n“The pandemic is horrible, horrible,” David Grose said about the past year.\n\nGrose, who is 84, picked up painting as a retirement interest. His college degree was in journalism and he made a career working at Ford Motor Co.; it wasn’t until his work life ended that he took art classes. Artistic talent tends to run in his family, he added. His grandfather painted as a hobby; his mother sketched as a hobby.\n\nThe pandemic impact that he and his wife particularly noticed was the inability to travel. While some visits were to meet up with family; travel also provided inspiration for his artworks. A visit to Scotland a few years ago resulted in castle themes for some of his paintings. He’s also fond of the streetscape scenes depicting a visit they made to New Orleans. In order to “see” those scenes again, he relies on sketches and photos that he made on site; or looks up favorite places on the Internet.\n\nArt shows that he would normally participate in did not happen during the past year. For example, he already had two pieces of Michigan flora and fauna paintings completed for the River Raisin National Battlefield Park’s 2020 show when it was canceled. When the call for entries opens for the next show, he’ll get those two pieces registered.\n\nWith more time at home, Grose found himself actually painting more often.\n\nTo adapt to the unusual times, Grose decided to focus on miniature paintings that are about 4 inches in size. This size is small enough to display several pieces at a gift shop table.\n\nOne of the themes he selected for miniatures was Greenfield Village buildings, which he hopes will be popular in Michigan gift shops.\n\n‘Art is so healing’\n\nMike and Lynette Fisher opened Gathered Creations in support of and to follow the interest of their daughter Jocelyne. She had shown an interest in art from a young age; and it was a passion that she returned to while recovering from medical complications relating to cancer.\n\nThe Fishers had already seen first-hand that Jocy enjoyed returning to creative art with her niche in glass fusing. Now they are picking up on similar conversations among their customers and students, regardless of their age or chosen medium.\n\n“Art is so healing. We’ve seen that over and over,” Mike Fisher said."
