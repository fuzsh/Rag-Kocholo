        "text": "“This case is a great example of how being featured as the Fugitive of the Week can tip the scales of social pressure and make an otherwise unwilling participant in the justice system reconsider their non-compliance,” Grillo said. “Having someone take responsibility by turning themselves in is ideal for their safety, public safety, and the safety of the law enforcement officers that are searching for them.”\n\nThe original story is below.\n\n“Grose is wanted out of Grafton County Superior Court for failing to appear on a June 6 ‘drug court’ hearing — the underlying charge concerns a 2018 drug possession case,” Grillo said, “and an outstanding failure to appear arrest warrant out of Biddeford, Maine, for a DUI charge. Grose is also a Tier 2 Sex Offender with a duty to register for life pursuant to a 1991 charge out of Grafton County for felonious sexual assault on a juvenile victim.”\n\nGrose, he said, had “an extensive criminal history in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine,” including assaultive behavior, sex crimes, drug activity, theft, resisting arrest, and escape charges.\n\nGrose is a felon due to a felonious sexual assault conviction in November 1991 after an incident in Grafton County in August 1990. He was committed to the house of corrections and was on probation for two years. Grose filed a motion to reduce the sentence in December 2003, but it was denied.\n\nGrose was charged with felony escape in November 1996, after an incident in Stewartstown, but the charge was nolle prossed two years later. In 2001, he was charged with both felony and misdemeanor issuing bad checks charges in Enfield. As part of a plea deal, he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charge while the felony charge was dropped.\n\nIn Lebanon, in May 2017, Grose was arrested on drug possession charges and pleaded guilty to a single count in October 2018. He pleaded guilty to two violation of probation or parole counts in February 2021. A warrant was issued for his arrest on June 7 after a sanctions order was issued.\n\nFour sex offender registration charges were issued against him in April 2019 after incidents in Lebanon. Two were dismissed eight months later, but Grose pleaded guilty to two other felony counts in February 2021. Also, he pleaded guilty to a felony criminal mischief charge in February 2021 after an incident in Haverhill in May 2020. A sanctions order was issued against him on May 3. Also in Haverhill, in January 2021, he was charged with two felony counts of delivery weapon, contraband, etc., and pleaded guilty in on Feb. 11.\n\nAccording to superior court records, an arrest warrant was issued against Grose for failure to appear in Grafton County Superior Court on felony habitual offender and driving under the influence charges after an incident in Lebanon on June 5."
