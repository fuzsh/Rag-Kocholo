        "text": "Cape Cod’s vast outer coast, named The Great Beach by Henry David Thoreau, is little changed since the Pilgrim’s first landfall almost 350 years ago. Today a plane can skim its fifty miles in a matter of seconds, and in the summer bathing areas are so crowded with cars and people they take on a continental flavor. But the long, desolate, windswept stretches can still be found, and the National Park Service has been taking steps to preserve the original character of the beach and its rolling dunes back from the water, designating it a National Seashore.\n\nThis book title, The Great Beach, ISBN: 9780393009835, by John Hay, David Grose, published by W. W. Norton & Company (June 17, 1980) is available in paperback. Our minimum order quantity is 25 copies. All standard bulk book orders ship FREE in the continental USA and delivered in 4-10 business days.\n\nUnlike Amazon and other retailers who may also offer The Great Beach books on their website, we specialize in large quantities and provide personal service, from trusted, experienced, friendly people in Portland, Oregon.
