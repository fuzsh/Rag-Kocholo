        "text": "What do you know about European fintech unicorns? How about a few interesting facts about them? 💶There are 121 fintech unicorns in the Europe by now. Altogether they are worth $445 B. 🌍Most of them were established in the United Kingdom, the further fintechs come mostly from France, Netherlands and Germany. 👯Two thirds of all fintech unicorns were established by 2 or 3 founders. 20% first saw the light of the day with just one founder. 4 or more founders are in case of fintech unicorns very rare. 🧑🏫61% of founders holds a master’s degree of even achieved higher educational level. 📚Over 50% of founders are serial founders. #kbsmartsolutions #fintech #poradvpohybu #startupynasbavi #startupekosystem #dealroom Source: The making of a fintech unicorn founder study published by Dealroom and Armstrong Internation from June 2024.\n\nOver the last 10 years, investors poured more than $370B into fintech startups across the globe. As a result, the sector is comprised of many companies operating at scale — and with plenty of room to grow. In our recent State of Fintech report, the F-Prime team took stock of the sector’s progress over the last decade, identifying the companies that have reached (or are about to reach) enterprise scale. However, much of that value remains locked away in private markets. So when will the fintech floodgates reopen? And who will lead the charge? Read Abdul Abdirahman in our latest edition of Fintech Prime Time (link in the comments) to get our take. #fintech #vc\n\nVery happy to announce our lead investment into Triple!!! Triple with its two founders Mario Navarro and Ibai Iturricha is set to become the clear market leader in transaction-data-enrichment (both in terms of accuracy and coverage). Hence we are very happy and proud to be able to support the whole team! Why does transaction-data-enrichment matter? 1. For customers: Users can now easily identify whether a transaction is valid or not - based on the additional data such as correct merchant name, logo, geo-location etc. 2. For fintechs and banks: massively reduce chargebacks, improve user experience and open up for new use cases (early fraud detection, subscription management, carbon footprint calculation etc.) #fintech #ai #startups Miriam Wohlfarth Dr. Ulrich Schmitt Olivier Rihs Daniel Mönch Sandro Macciacchini Andreas Schneider 🌱 Ewan Jones Bettina Hoffet Ivan Sharogh Muneton Gil David Schnider Krzysztof Bialkowski Krisztián Gyepes\n\nGideon Valkin Launches Debut Fund to Back Europe’s Fintech Mafias Building the Next-Generation of Tech Giants “Europe’s time has arrived,” says Gideon Valkin. “A new power network of founding teams has emerged out of Europe’s first generation of industry-defining companies. These teams are using their lessons and experiences to solve tomorrow’s most pressing and important problems across fintech, AI, climate-tech and enterprise software. They deserve investors who understand these problems, believe in their ambitious vision and have the knowledge and know-how to truly support them.” https://lnkd.in/eWbPQBBi Entrée Capital RTP Global Taavet+Sten Cherry Ventures Filip Felician Dames Christian Meermann Sophia Bendz David Haber Andreessen Horowitz Firat Ileri Hummingbird Ventures #fintech #finance #banking #paytech #payments #fintechnews #paymentsnews\n\nPortfolio news 🚀 Pluto.markets (YC W22) brings on new chairman Claus Nielsen - who writes: \"With 15 years of experience leading Saxo Bank’s markets division and witnessing the evolution of the FinTech sector, I’m convinced that now’s the time to push investing into the next paradigm. This entails fixing legacy infrastructure inefficiencies, launching a wider range of assets, making it cheaper and building a superior user experience. But disrupting a highly capital intensive and extremely regulated industry is near impossible. Multiple startups have tried building a new app on the same old piece of infrastructure. This doesn’t work. In order to be truly disruptive, one must build a bank from scratch. The Pluto team is doing exactly this, which reminds me of the early days at Saxo Bank.\" Excited to see how Claus and the Pluto.markets (YC W22) can achieve together! Thanks to FX News Group and Gerald Segal for covering this great match 🙌 https://lnkd.in/dQqXKmBv\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for fintech (or any) start-ups is finding a problem that customers feel so deeply that they will line up to get a solution. Former Head of Product at Paypal Wallet, Janette Chung shares some valuable insights in a recent interview - she discusses the importance of identifying \"old vs. new\" problems, fighting confirmation bias, and incorporating diverse thinking. #fintech #startups #productmarketfit #diversethinking At the Verdant Frontiers Fintech Fund, we invest in African fintech start-ups and also roll up our sleeves to help accelerate product-market fit.\n\nThe fintech landscape is tough, but I believe there's light ahead! Despite the sector's challenges, I remain optimistic. In my discussion with Jan Thomas from Startup Insider last week, we dived deep into our latest fintech report and discussed signs of revival in the fintech sector. Success stories like Solaris SE, Klarna, and our latest investment, bezahl.de (NX Technologies GmbH), show once again that resilience, humility, and focus are key factors in overcoming tough times. It's about the perseverance of not just founders but also us investors. Let's not get distracted by emerging trends but keep our eyes on the goal—building outstanding businesses!
