        "text": "As I have mentioned, for the first time and one of the first recorded, everyone at Compton’s Cafeteria riot that night unite to fight back against police discrimination. 50 years ago, LGBTQ community of the Tenderloin District has been abused and targeted by the San Francisco Police Department with unlawful arrest (violating the city’s anti-cross dressing). The film ends on a high note. Even though time has changed, however, they still suffer and face discrimination. But, it shows the transformation of transgender activism in just two short years.\n\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by people who were apart of the LGBT community against the police raid that happened on the morning of July 28,1969, at the Stonewall Inn, located in Manhattan, New York City. It’s believed that Sylvia Rivera, a trans woman, was the first one who rightfully threw the first brick. These events are widely considered to be the single most important event leading to the LGBT liberation movement and the current fight for LGBT rights in America.\n\nAfter reading “Rev. Sekou on Today’s Civil Rights Leaders: ‘I Take My Orders From 23-Year-Old Queer Women” and “The Soapbox: On the Stonewall Rebellion’s Trans History”, it’s very interesting to see what has and hasn’t changed in terms of who the public sees as the “leaders” of a movement. The piece on the Stonewall Riots and how they are remembered and represented in media (as lead by white, cis, gay men) reminded me of the comment Rev. Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou made on the demographic that the “majority of the black leadership” has tended to be. When remembering the Stonewall Riots, many people either choose to ignore or are not aware of the queer, trans, black women who were on the front lines. And although Rev. Sekou brings forth the knowledge\n\nResearch Question: My research question involves the history of the LGBTQ community’s relationship with law enforcement, particularly around the time when the community had little to no support or protection under the jurisdiction of the United States. I am expanding my knowledge on the Stonewall Riot’s coverage within the media to discover if the framing of the protesters as militant was used to rally support behind a police force with a heteronormative agenda, in order to point out the biases that would have been overlooked in the original coverage of this event.\n\nIf I were to ask you what was the Stonewall riots and when did they take place, could you tell me? Well, no need because that is the exact reason why I’m writing this paper. In order to better inform you, my peers of what happened, where they took place, and why they are so important to American history. The 1960’s were not a welcoming time for those who fell into the LGBT community, ally or not. So those in the community who were affected came together and turned Inns into a place of refuge. Therefore, the Stonewall Riots were an important event in American History because it brought to the attention of the people; social injustices, police corruption, and sparked a social movement for peace and rights for all.\n\nMembers of the gay community were heavily discriminated against because of their sexuality and because heterosexual people had no tolerance for them and their “lifestyle”. When the actual raid on the Stonewall Inn occurred some patrons at the bar became hostile and resisted the police. The police in turn became violent and began to threaten and even hurt some of the people in the bar that refused to show identification or have their gender checked. Both the members of the gay community and the New York police that came to raid Stonewall are to blame for the riots that broke out. The gay patrons of the bar had a right to fight against hate and discrimination, but the police could only fight back because the riots were violent towards them. In the end, the members of the gay community had more of a reason to riot than the police had to injure and arrest them during the riots.\n\nEven though the Stonewall Riots happened 49 years ago, the boom of influence it made is still ringing in the ears of humanity today. 49 years prior, the victims of discrimination were asking for change, and today, activists for the LGBTQ+ community are still asking for change, but in a new and more inclusive\n\nMany people from the United States hold the belief that being gay is something that has always been considered to be okay. They believe that it is just a given. Despite people’s current beliefs on the subject, for a very long time, it was something that was widely believed to be taboo. In the past, people were imprisoned due to their sexuality. Regardless, throughout the decades, people have pushed for the widespread acceptance of people who are part of the LGBT community. Today, homophobia still exists in some parts of the United States, but we have come a long way since the early 1900s.\n\nThe Stonewall Inn was a gay bar in New York City and it was the starting place of the Gay Liberation Movement. In the 1970s gay men and lesbians started wanting equality because they faced lots of legal discrimination. They didn’t have equal rights because they couldn’t even have consensual sex with their partners and it was illegal in almost all states. So in 1969 police raided the Stonewall Inn and gay men fought the police and proclaimed “Gay Power.” This event caused riots between the New York City police and all the gay residents.\n\nMinorities have always been underrepresented by every media outlet, whether that be film, literature, pop culture, etc., and that furthers stereotypes. Something that has always and will continue to be a device of discord in human nature is that of wanting to be heard, no matter how disastrous that might become. This has been shown by multiple events throughout the entire Gay Rights movement, most notably the birth of the movement which are, the Stonewall Riots, “These riots were highly influential to establishing a foothold, however it was a peaceful protest, despite the name. Stonewall Riots was the forerunner for LGBT movements and begin gay rights groups June 28, 1969, In the early hours of June 28, 1969, a group of gay customers at a\n\nThere are certainly various points in history that can be construed as trailblazing for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community. One event in particular, however, sparked awareness and a call to action that previously could never have been conceptualized in the United States. This unforgettable incident, the Stonewall riots of 1969, altered the public’s view of the gay community and arguably jumpstarted the next revolution in an entirely new civil rights movement.\n\nThe author lists recent protests held by the trans community over a movie that places a cisgender, white, gay male at the center of the revolutionary Stonewall Riots, despite the widespread fact and acknowledgement that trans-women of color were the revolutionaries of the riots. The Stonewall Riots were the pivotal moment in the on-going movement towards equality for the LGBT communities. During the riots that took place in the 60’s, queer men and women worked alongside trans and gender nonconforming people for the purpose of making the LGBT voice heard across not only America, but world. The conjoined efforts of both the trans and gay communities are what have led us to the legalization of gay marriage this past year. Together, both communities have created so much progress. Wouldn’t dividing ourselves into separate communities effectively stop us from continuing this progress towards\n\nBefore continuing onto an analysis of how the Stonewall Riots happened and what came of them, one must first take a closer look at the events and opinions that came before and brought upon the anger and frustration that many LGBT individuals felt on that fateful night. According to many historians, the years before Stonewall were considered a “dark age” for LGBT individuals, where their very existence was\n\nStonewall is known as the riot that kickstarted the movement for gay rights in America in 1969. Throughout the 1960’s the gay community was targeted for their homosexual activities because this went against the common beliefs of the people. Most of the population had the Christian belief that being interested in the same sex was against God’s will. This caused discrimination throughout the nation between members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender plus (LGBT+) community and the rest of the country. Due to this discrimination, many LGBT+ members felt like their rights were being violated by the government. On June 28, 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in Manhattan, New York City, the community decided to fight back for their rights. They\n\nOver the past decade, important and relevant movies has been made about the historical and cultural touchstones after world war 2. For instance: Americas history, the Vietnam war, John F. Kennedy, the women’s liberation and fight for equality. But there has been one glaring historical event, both in terms of importance of your culture and society. That is The Civil Rights movement – possibly the most influential social and political event in the 20th century, both in America and in the rest of the world. Until 2013 these paramount events had not been adapted for the screen. The movie “The Butler” - which I will write my essay about – gives an insight of the events that would later on change the world. Not only does the text interpret the events of The Civil Rights Movement, it also shows the labyrinth of getting a"
