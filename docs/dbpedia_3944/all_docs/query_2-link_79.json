        "text": "To mark Pride Month, Emer Long from our Psychology Department celebrates the LGBTQI+ community and explores why we need to talk about LGBTQI+ mental health.\n\nPride Month is an opportunity to celebrate the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer/Questioning, and Intersex (LGBTQI+) community. It is a time to celebrate their experiences, their contributions, and the impact they have had on history, nationally and internationally.\n\nPride is celebrated each June in honour of the 1969 Stonewall Uprising, led by Marsha P. Johnson, an African-American transgender woman. This was a seminal event in LGBTQI+ history, which marked a turning point in the community’s activism.\n\nThroughout Pride Month, we celebrate how far LGBTQI+ rights and acceptance has come, while also holding space to reflect and bring awareness on how much more there is yet to achieve. From its inception, Pride was, and is, a call for greater rights, equity, and safety for the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIts underlying sentiment is universal:\n\nthe freedom to be our authentic selves without shame or fear, and the right to equal treatment and representation, is a right held by all and given without prejudice.\n\nLGBTQI+ mental health: An Irish perspective\n\nLGBTQI+ mental health: An Irish perspective\n\nFindings from the Supporting LGBT Lives Study demonstrate the continued challenges faced by the LGBT+ community in Ireland. This study highlighted that 80% of LGBT+ people have been verbally abused because of their identity, 40% had been threatened with physical violence, and 25% had been physically assaulted.\n\nGiven these experiences, it is unsurprising that the study also highlighted that LGBT+ people were four times more likely to experience severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress than non-LGBT+ people.\n\nThe impact on mental health and wellbeing was further noted: 27% of LGBT+ people have self-harmed at some point in their lives, with 85% having done so more than once. The study reported that 60% of LGBT+ people had considered suicide at some point and 18% had attempted suicide.\n\nFrom a wellbeing perspective, the report also noted that 81% of participants were now comfortable with their LGBT+ identity and the majority reported good self-esteem and satisfaction with their lives. Over two thirds of people had come out to all of their immediate family and friends and 96% were out to at least one person.\n\nContributions to LGBTQI+ mental health difficulties\n\nContributions to LGBTQI+ mental health difficulties\n\nSimply being a member of the LGBTQI+ community does not result in mental health difficulties, and not all mental health difficulties experienced by the LGBTQI+ community are due to their gender and sexual identities. Understanding the root and cause of suffering or challenges allows us to take an active role in easing them.\n\nThe mental health difficulties faced by the LGBTQI+ community can, in part, be linked to the factors below.\n\nMinority stress\n\nMinority stressors are the unique and additional stressful events that are specific to minority groups, such as the LGBTQI+ community. These put people are a higher risk of developing mental health difficulties. These experiences are unique (not experienced by non-stigmatized groups), chronic (related to social and cultural structures), and socially based (built and reinforced within social processes, institutions, and structures).\n\nFive types of minority stress that impact on the LGBTQI+ community are:\n\nvictimization\n\ndiscrimination\n\nheteronormative cultural norms (or a culture where heterosexuality – or romantic or sexual attraction between people of the opposite sex - is assumed as a given)\n\nstereotyping and prejudice\n\nsystematic bias.\n\nHate crimes\n\nMembers of the LGBTQI+ community are at a greater risk of experiencing hate crimes compared to people who are heterosexual and cisgender (someone who identifies as the gender they were assigned at birth). Transgender, or trans, people are the most at risk.\n\nThe ILGA-European report on Transphobic Hate Crime found that trans people are three times more likely to experience hate crimes than lesbians and gay men.\n\nOther factors\n\nOther factors which can impact on LGBTQI+ mental health include:\n\nverbal, emotional, or physical abuse or harassment\n\ndiscrimination in and barriers to accessing healthcare, employment, and housing\n\nabsence of specialised LGBTQI+ services\n\na lack of knowledge about LGBTQI+ specific needs and experiences from healthcare providers.\n\nBeing an ally\n\nBeing an ally\n\nKnowing the possible reasons behind the higher rates of mental health difficulties among the LGBTQI+ community allows us to consider how we, as individuals and a society, can support people in the community to live mentally healthy lives.\n\nMost LGBTQI+ people are very resilient and will flourish with the support of allies, such as families, friends, and communities. An ally is someone who stands up for, supports, and encourages those around them. When used in the LGBTQI+ community, an “ally” refers to someone who supports the rights of LGBTQI+ people and promotes equity.\n\nImportantly, allyship does not begin and end during Pride. Instead, it is rooted in our everyday actions.\n\nBelow are some examples.\n\nCheck your assumptions\n\nIt’s important not to assume that everyone in our lives, whether it be family members, friends, coworkers and so on, are heterosexual and cisgender. Don’t assume another person’s gender or pronouns (the terms they use to refer to themselves, which reflect their identity).\n\nNoticing our tendencies towards assumptions, and mindfully challenging these, can help us to create a culture of “inviting in”, rather than an expectation on LGBTQI+ people to “come out”.\n\nUsing more inclusive language helps to create a welcoming atmosphere. For instance, rather than asking someone about their boyfriend/girlfriend or husband/wife, ask about their partner.\n\nBe open\n\nPart of being an effective ally means accepting that you won’t know everything, but are open to learning. Being supportive of LGBTQI+ loved ones and friends means taking the time to develop a true understanding of how they experience the world.\n\nTake the time to listen. Remember, it is normal to worry about “saying the wrong thing”, but approaching conversations about sexuality and gender respectfully goes a long way.\n\nTake the time to educate yourself. Seek out LGBTQI+ trainings, writings, and information to familiarise yourself with LGBTQI+ terminology, history, and the ongoing struggles the community continues to face. It is important we are active in this learning and that we do not expect the LGBTQI+ people in our lives to be our sole educators.\n\nStand up and speak out\n\nIf you hear someone make homophobic, biphobic, or transphobic “jokes” or comments, name it. Truthfully, this can be challenging, especially when those making such comments are family, friends, or colleagues. It is important to make your voice heard and, although not always easy, these are the situations where being an ally can really count.\n\nBeing an ally means being an ally to all LGBTQI+ people. This includes LGBTQI+ people of colour, older LGBTQI+ adults, transgender and nonbinary people, disabled LGBTQI+ people, and LGBTQI+ people in other minority cultures, whose voices and experiences are doubly silenced for a variety of reasons.\n\nBe visible\n\nAlthough Pride Month is awash with big parades and celebrations, with swathes of rainbow flags as far as the eye can see, it is also the other 11 months of the year where being a visible LGBTQI+ ally matters.\n\nLGBTQI+ people can experience significant challenges when accessing mental health services. The My LGBTQI+ Voice Matters research highlighted fear of judgment, lack of understanding, or previous negative experiences with services as barriers for LGBTQI+ people. Having visible signs of openness and of allyship in our communities and workplaces (for example, flags, pins, or lanyards) can help to create an atmosphere of welcome, safeness, and acceptance of all sexual orientations and gender expressions."
