        "text": "Every June, Kaiser Permanente celebrates Pride Month, along with many people and organizations in our communities, to show support for the LGBTQ+ community. This year, Kaiser Permanente’s theme for Pride Month is Love Unites.\n\n“The theme reflects our organization’s commitment to the LGBTQ+ community and its allies,” said Joshua Kennedy, a Kaiser Permanente Labor Management Partnership trainer in Washington and co-chair for the Kaiser Permanente Pride business resource group. “There were several other themes considered, but Love Unites was the overwhelming favorite.”\n\nPride Month honors the 1969 Stonewall riots, widely considered the transformative event that led to the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. Members of the LGBTQ+ community and their allies hold memorials for people killed in hate crimes and those who died of AIDS. And parades are held across the country to call attention to the continued need for equal rights, opportunities, and acceptance.\n\nWe’re incorporating the Love Unites theme into our parade floats in Pride celebrations across our markets — including San Francisco, San Diego, and Portland, Oregon. You’ll also see the Love Unites theme used in banners and signs in our facilities, featured in television and print advertisements, and shared on social media."
