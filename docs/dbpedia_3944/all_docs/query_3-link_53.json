We reflect on the progress we have made so far in pursuit of equality, justice, and inclusion. We recommit ourselves to do more to support LGBTQI+ rights at home and around the world. For generations, LGBTQI+ Americans have summoned the courage to live authentically and proudly — even when it meant putting their lives and livelihoods at risk. In 1969 at the Stonewall Inn in New York, brave LGBTQI+ individuals protested the violence and marginalization they faced, boosting a civil rights movement for the liberation of LGBTQI+ people that has transformed our Nation. Since then, courageous LGBTQI+ Americans continue to inspire and bring hope to all people seeking a life true to who they are. LGBTQI+ people also continue to enrich every aspect of American life as educators, entertainers, entrepreneurs, athletes, actors, artists, scientists, scholars, diplomats, doctors, service members, veterans, and so much more.\" Read the full proclamation\n\nThe Library of Congress\n\n“June is Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Pride Month. This month-long celebration demonstrates how LGBTQ Americans have strengthened our country, by using their talent and creativity to help create awareness and goodwill. The first Pride March in New York City was held on June 28, 1970, on the one year anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising. More\n\nThe legacy of LGBTQ individuals is being discovered by interested readers and seasoned researchers perusing unparalleled global collections. The acquisition of historic material and the ongoing program of copyright deposits will continue to enrich the Library’s holdings of LGBTQ materials.\n\nThe collections of the Library of Congress contain many books, posters, sound recordings, manuscripts and other material produced by, about and for the LGBTQ community. The contributions of this community are preserved as part of our nation’s history, and include noted artistic works, musical compositions and contemporary novels. The Library’s American collections range from the iconic poetry of Walt Whitman through the manuscripts of the founder of LGBTQ activism in Washington, D.C., Frank Kameny.\n\nThe Library of Congress is the largest single repository of world knowledge in a single place. In addition to having the mission of acquiring and preserving this exponentially growing body of knowledge, the Library is responsible for making all of its vast collection accessible to all.”\n\nSmithsonian Sparks: Marsha Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and the History of Pride Month\n\n\"Marsha P. Johnson, a self-identified drag queen and a prominent gay liberation activist, is one of the most well-known participants in the Stonewall uprising. After Stonewall, her activism continued—she joined the Gay Liberation Front, ACT UP, and cofounded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Sylvia Rivera. (Johnson also referred to herself as a “transvestite,” and never used “transgender” to describe her gender identity, since the term was popularized after her death in 1992.) Rivera was also involved in Stonewall, and the experience led her to campaign with the Gay Activist Alliance (GAA) for a city nondiscrimination law. But Rivera, who was a transgender woman and Latina, faced discrimination from established gay rights organizations like the GAA that were predominantly led by white men. The GAA's leadership often rejected the role transgender people—many of them people of color—played in Stonewall. Together, Rivera and Johnson started STAR House for LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness, with a focus on supporting people of color.\"\n\nThe National Parks Service Celebrates Pride Month\n\n\"The world changes in direct proportion to the number of people willing to be honest about their lives.\" -- Armistead Maupin\n\n\"As America’s storytellers, the National Park Service (NPS) is committed to telling the history of all Americans in all of its diversity and complexity. For many years, the rich histories of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer Americans have been erased through punishing laws and general prejudice—appearing sporadically in police proceedings, medical reports, military hearings, and immigration records.\n\nYet, for many LGBTQ groups, preserving and interpreting their past has been an important part of building communities and mutual support. Because of their efforts, we can find LGBTQ histories across the United States—from private residences, hotels, bars, and government agencies to hospitals, parks, and community centers. From the mujerado of the Acoma and Laguna tribes to the drag queens of the Stonewall riots, discover their stories in our nation’s parks, homes, and historic sites.\" Read more\n\nUS Department of Veterans Health: Recognizing LGBTQ+ Veterans During Pride Month\n\n\"Throughout much of the military's history, LGBTQ+ Veterans had to hide their identities while serving in the military. This sometimes led to stress, alcohol problems, depression, and other challenges. Hear how some of them began to live openly and regain their self-esteem with the support of their communities and VA professionals.\"\n\nGLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation)\n\n\"GLAAD rewrites the script for LGBTQ acceptance. As a dynamic media force, GLAAD tackles tough issues to shape the narrative and provoke dialogue that leads to cultural change. GLAAD protects all that has been accomplished and creates a world where everyone can live the life they love....[GLAAD was founded in 1985] In response to the New York Post's grossly defamatory and sensationalized HIV and AIDS coverage, a small group of journalists and writers form GLAAD. The first reported meeting is November 14, 1985 and later that year, almost 1,000 people protest outside of the New York Post.\" Learn more\n\nUnited States Federal Courts Celebrate Pride Month\n\nSince 1999, when a presidential proclamation cited June as Pride Month, Americans have recounted and recognized the struggles and achievements of a community striving for equality and inclusion. Many consider the Stonewall Uprising that made the news on June 28, 1969, as the tipping point in the rights movement that has impacted lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer individuals and their communities as well as the broader society.\n\nLearn about the federal judge who led the way for others in the judiciary.\n\nYouth.Gov\n\n\"Sexual orientation and gender identity/expression are important aspects of a young person’s identity. Understanding and expressing sexual orientation and gender and developing related identities are typical development tasks that vary across children and youth. For example, some youth may be unsure of their sexual orientation, whereas others have been clear about it since childhood and have expressed it since a young age.1 Expressing and exploring gender identity and roles is a part of normal development. 2 The process of understanding and expressing one’s sexual orientation and gender identity is unique to each individual. It is not a one-time event and personal, cultural, and social factors may influence how one expresses their sexual orientation and gender identity.3\" Learn more\n\nThe Gay Rights Movement\n\n\"The gay rights movement in the United States has seen huge progress in the last century, and especially the last two decades. Laws prohibiting homosexual activity have been struck down; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals can now serve openly in the military. And same-sex couples can now legally get married and adopt children in all 50 states. But it has been a long and bumpy road for gay rights proponents, who are still advocating for employment, housing and transgender rights.\" Learn more\n\nThe Stonewall Riots (1969)\n\n\"The Stonewall Riots, also called the Stonewall Uprising, began in the early hours of June 28, 1969 when New York City police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay club located in Greenwich Village in New York City. The raid sparked a riot among bar patrons and neighborhood residents as police roughly hauled employees and patrons out of the bar, leading to six days of protests and violent clashes with law enforcement outside the bar on Christopher Street, in neighboring streets and in nearby Christopher Park. The Stonewall Riots served as a catalyst for the gay rights movement in the United States and around the world.\"\n\nAIDS Crisis Timeline\n\n\"In the late 1970's and early 1980's, a virus that had previously appeared sporadically around the world began to spread throughout the United States. Originally identified as a “gay disease” because gay men were one of the primary groups afflicted, HIV and the syndrome it causes, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, were unknown in 1981 but had become household terms and the number one threat to public health by the late 1980's. ...HIV/AIDS activists, medical professionals, artists and a number of people with AIDS who went public with their diagnoses despite the stigma surrounding the disease eventually spurred a massive response from the U.S. government and the international health community.\" Read more\n\nResearch\n\nBecoming Gay: The Formation and Meaning of LGBTQ Political Identity\n\nGay Liberation Movement New Mexico; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nHonesty, Privacy and Shame: When Gay People Talk About Other Gay People to Nongay People\n\nHealth, Well-Being, and Experiences of Discrimination for Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual People\n\nThe Health and Well-Being of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth in New Mexico\n\nUncommon Knowledge: A History of Queer New Mexico, 1920's-1980's\n\n\"All is not dead here in the desert\": The Development of Albuquerque's Organized Gay Community\n\nChanging Hearts and Minds: The Politics of Sentimentality and The Cultural Production of the Gay Family in New Mexicos Same-Sex Marriage Debate\n\nWomen, Gender & Sexuality Studies at UNM\n\nCross National IdentityTransformation: Becoming a Gay \"Asian-American\" Man\n\nSanta Fe Lesbian and Gay Pride, 1990's; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nA Retrospective Study of Gay Gifted, Young Adult Males' Perceptions of Giftedness and Suicide\n\nThe Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Rights in New Mexico, 1993-2004; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nLesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) Healthcare in Undergraduate Medical Education: Assessment and Focused Intervention for Medical Students Transitioning to Wards\n\n(Lie)alectics and the Discursive Dequeerification of Political Spaces Based on Religious Freedoms: A Critical Rhetorical Analysis of the Mormon and Gay Website\n\nGay Rights, New Mexico; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nHistory of the University of New Mexico’s Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Queer (LGBTQ) Resource Center\n\nGender Role Beliefs and Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men in Chile and the U.S.\n\nLambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, 1999-2006; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nProject Straight Talk, 1978-1984; New Mexico Archives Online\n\nthe.
