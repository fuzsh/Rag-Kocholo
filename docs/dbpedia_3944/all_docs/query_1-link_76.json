        "text": "51 years ago in the early hours of 28 June 1969, in a Manhattan bar known as Stonewall Inn, a group of LGBT people decided to stand up to police harassment. The event sparked a global rights movement and half a century on we pay tribute to those whose actions have changed the course of LGBTIQ+ rights around the world including Australia.\n\nThe Stonewall riots weren’t the first time that LGBT+ people stood up against police abuse — before New York, there was a riot at other venues in Los Angeles and in San Francisco. But Stonewall is the most well-known and led to the creation of what we now know as Pride. Pride has always been a political event since its inception. Even though it might seem like a party, protests have always been part of its goal as a movement against unjust systems.\n\nThe central figures of the uprising were transgender people of colour. We are grateful for the trans and transgender people of colour who have fought to make the world a better place for LGBTIQ+ communities around the world."
