        "text": "Hello – my name is Nina Harris! This summer I had the incredible opportunity of working as a summer intern in the Marketing and Development Department at Bucks County Housing Group with Amanda McGill and Dominic DiFrancesco.\n\nI am part of the Foundations Community Partnership SYC internship program and have had the great fortune of working with BCHG as well as taking a class in service learning with 12 other peers working at different non-profits. I am currently a rising sophomore at Cornell University and plan to major in Economics.\n\nDuring my time at Bucks County Housing Group, I assisted in social media posts shared on Instagram, Facebook, X, and LinkedIn. We worked on using these platforms to increase community engagement and share BCHG’s mission and impact. I also worked with Dom in creating informational videos on all of BCHG’s programs that will be released over the course of the year. It was such a fun process getting to be creative when outlining and creating these videos and they came out even better than imagined!\n\nThis summer, I also played a role in organizing our second annual Brewery Fundraiser being held at Neshaminy Creek Brewing Company on August 3rd. I assisted in reaching out to local businesses and musicians to organize sponsors and performers for our event. It was an inspiring process to see individuals and organizations being willing to donate their time and resources to help support BCHG’s mission and I am excited to attend the event soon!\n\nAt BCHG, I also worked in our donor database and handled in-person donations. Since our fiscal year ends in June, I had the opportunity to analyze all the data from our fiscal year, find important trends, compare our growth from the 22-23 fiscal year, and present my findings to Amanda. It was a great opportunity to learn how to work with financial data and display it in an organized manner.\n\nLastly, once a week I worked at our two food pantry locations in Penndel and Doylestown. I watered our community gardens, organized food donations, and assisted in distributions. It was incredibly rewarding to see BCHG’s impact in action and I am very grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such passionate volunteers and staff who truly care about helping the community each and every day.\n\nThank you to everyone at Bucks County Housing Group for being so welcoming and making this such an amazing experience. I am very thankful especially to Amanda McGill for her mentorship, dedication, and genuine support for my success at BCHG and beyond, and to Dom DiFrancesco for being such a kind and talented co-intern! I am extremely grateful for my time at BCHG and this experience has furthered my interest in future work in the nonprofit sector and finding ways to make a positive impact on my community!\n\nThis summer, our staff has been hard at work creating fun and unique events for our Supportive Housing Program locations. We want to highlight three incredible activities that have helped to foster a strong sense of community for our residents.\n\nBucks 4-H Community Bonding\n\nTo kick-start our summer events, we partnered with Bucks 4-H in early June to host an event at SHP Doylestown. Families came out to enjoy a beautiful day outside filled with fun activities. Kids expressed their creativity with crafts, participated in fun games, and strengthened their leadership and collaboration skills through teamwork-building exercises. It was truly fantastic to see families come together, relax, and enjoy the day of community bonding.\n\nWorkforce of Wheels Career Day\n\nLater in June, Workforce on Wheels Career Link visited SHP Doylestown. Career Link provided our Doylestown residents with the necessary technology and guidance to help build their resumes and apply for job opportunities. Job security is essential in feeling positive about the future, and we are very grateful that Career Link created such a welcoming space for everyone to come together and work towards their goals. We are proud to be empowering the community through such incredible workshops and look forward to working with Workforce on Wheels again in the future.\n\nWild Things Preserve Visit\n\nLater on, in early July, we had a magical visit from Wild Things Preserve! Animals like snakes, ducks, parrots, and reptiles were met with pure excitement from the kids throughout the afternoon. They were able to feed, pet, and hold the animals while also learning more about their habitats and backgrounds. Everyone truly had a blast and it was an incredible and educational afternoon.\n\nThese events would not be possible without our wonderful staff, volunteers, and families who are passionate about building a welcoming and empowering community. We also want to thank our incredible community partners – Bucks 4-H, Workforce on Wheels, and Wild Things Preserve – for making these events even more special. It is incredible how these fun and productive days have been so successful in building strong connections and we look forward to more events like this in the future!\n\nShare our mission by following along!\n\nInstagram: @buckscountyhousinggroup\n\nFacebook: Bucks County Housing Group\n\nTwitter: @housing4all\n\nImportance of Community Gardens\n\nAs the summer months approach, we want to highlight the importance of community gardens in providing fresh produce to many residents within Bucks County. With around 7.3% of Bucks County’s population food insecure and food donations dwindling in the summer months, community gardens increasingly need to help bridge this gap.\n\nCommunity gardens help to provide fresh produce to low-income households. This allows families to have access to healthier food options to incorporate into their daily diet, creating the opportunity to make nutrient-dense meals and procure necessary vitamins and minerals that might not have been accessible before. Community gardens are essential for creating an opportunity where fresh food is abundant and easily attainable for everyone.\n\nAlong with helping reduce food insecurity within the county, gardens also help strengthen social connections. Volunteers are able to come together and work towards a good cause while exercising and spending time outside. Working hard to help the garden thrive fosters a strong sense of connection between volunteers and community causes.\n\nBCHG’s Commitment to Gardens\n\nBecause of all the incredible benefits of community gardens, Bucks County Housing Group is proud to support three of their own this summer. With locations at our Doylestown, Penndel, and Robert Morris sites, BCHG strives to create a space that cultivates community connection. We are currently growing tomatoes, squash, and herbs that will soon be ready to harvest. We then distribute this produce to our food pantries and residents to enjoy!\n\nOur gardens are essential in helping us accomplish our mission to close the door on hunger and homelessness. By providing fresh food to community members, especially in the summer when food donations tend to run low, our gardens allow us to alleviate the difficulties caused by food insecurity and provide community support for low-income households within Bucks County.\n\nWe always appreciate our volunteers who help make this mission possible. If you are interested in volunteering at any of our garden or pantry sites email amcgill@bchg.org!\n\nAlso, you can be a part of the BCHG community by following along!\n\nInstagram: @buckscountyhousinggroup\n\nFacebook: Bucks County Housing Group\n\nTwitter: @housing4all\n\nWritten By: Nina Harris\n\nIntroduction\n\nHappy Pride! June is Pride Month, dedicated to celebrating the LGBTQIA+ community and honoring the progress made towards equality and acceptance. Pride originated from the Stonewall riots of June 1969. These were spontaneous demonstrations by LGBTQIA+ community members in response to a police raid at the Stonewall Inn in New York City. These riots marked a turning point in the LGBTQIA+ rights movement. They galvanized activism and led to the formation of numerous advocacy groups. Over the decades, Pride Month has grown into an international celebration. It now includes parades, festivals, and events promoting LGBTQIA+ visibility and rights.\n\nThis month also reminds us of the ongoing struggle for LGBTQIA+ rights. It highlights the importance of solidarity and visibility. Amidst the celebrations, it’s crucial to reflect on the persistent challenges faced by the queer community. Disproportionate rates of hunger and homelessness are key issues. These issues underscore the broader socioeconomic disparities that continue to affect LGBTQIA+ individuals, making it essential to address and support their needs comprehensively.\n\nThe Issue, at a glance\n\nDespite strides in LGBTQIA+ rights, significant disparities persist in essential areas like food and housing security. According to a 2021 study by the Human Rights Campaign, LGBTQIA+ individuals are twice as likely to experience homelessness compared to their heterosexual, cisgender counterparts. A 2020 study from the Williams Institute supports this, finding that 17% of sexual minority adults report lifetime homelessness, and less than 50% of LGBTQIA+ adults own homes compared to 70% of heterosexual, cisgender adults Furthermore, disparities in homeownership are pronounced among LGBTQIA+ racial minorities and transgender individuals.\n\nLGBTQIA+ youth are particularly vulnerable; up to 40% of homeless youth identifying as LGBTQIA+. This can stem for a lack of support at home and a refusal to house a member of the LGBTQ+ community. However, discrimination exists in the housing market as well. Refusal to rent or sell to same-sex couples, realtors refusing to show houses to transgender individuals, and rejections same-sex partners in leases all occur. These discriminatory practices exacerbate housing insecurity within the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nSimilarly, food insecurity is prevalent among LGBTQIA+ individuals. The fact that LGBTQ+ individuals are twice as likely to receive SNAP benefits reflects this disparity. A 2021 revealed 13% of LGBTQIA+ adults report insufficient food at home, almost double non-LGBTQIA+ adults. Additionally, a 2019 study by the Oregon Food Bank revealed that 27% of LGBTQIA+ individuals reported insufficient funds for food within the past year. This is 10% higher compared to 17% of their straight or cisgender counterparts. Additionally, over 22% of LGBTQIA+ adults live in poverty, making them twice as likely as the general population to experience hunger. Economic challenges, including workplace discrimination, contribute to this disparity. Nearly 50% of LGBTQ+ individuals remain closeted at work out of fear of negative treatment or professional repercussions.\n\nDespite these challenges, LGBTQIA+ individuals are less likely to seek assistance from food banks due to fear of rejection or discrimination. Approximately 14% avoid faith-based food pantries, further highlighting the barriers faced by the community in accessing essential resources.\n\nAlthough the above information merely grazes the surface of the issue, we hope it’s sufficient to illuminate the necessity of dialogue around it.\n\nOur Mission\n\nUnfortunately, accessing housing support and food pantries is not always free from discrimination. The reality that many have faced rejection or prejudice when seeking assistance roots this apprehension. With that in mind, Bucks County Housing Group is committed to providing a safe and supportive environment, offering services without discrimination based on gender, sexual identity, or any other identity features. Our goal is that everyone can access the help they need, such as housing initiatives—supportive housing, rapid rehousing, and housing counseling—and food programs — pantries, mobile markets, and community gardens — without fear of bias or exclusion. Join us in creating a community where everyone feels safe and supported. Help ensure that all can access the resources they need to thrive.\n\nVolunteer\n\nDonate\n\nHold A Drive\n\nShare our mission by following along!\n\nInstagram: @buckscountyhousinggroup\n\nFacebook: Bucks County Housing Group\n\nTwitter: @housing4all\n\nWritten By: Dominic DiFrancesco\n\nThis past Mother’s Day, Bucks County Housing Group hosted a heartwarming and creative event at our Robert Morris Apartment site. Our Craft Day brought together children from our various housing programs to celebrate the special women in their lives with personalized, hand-painted flower pots.\n\nThe diversity in designs mirrored the diversity of our community, showcasing the unique relationships and stories each child shares with their mother or mother figure. The Craft Day was more than just an art activity. It was a celebration of family and the enduring bond between mothers and their children. It provided an opportunity for the children to give back to the women who mean the most to them.\n\nHosted by our Community Building Program, part of our Social Services department, this event was the latest in our array of holiday events at our Robert Morris Apartments. Our Community Building Program provided craft materials, snacks, supervision, and the event space so our program’s children could create, socialize, and have fun. The staff and volunteers worked diligently to ensure an awesome afternoon for all. We’re so lucky to have them on the BCHG team.\n\nEvents like these are at the heart of BCHG’s mission. We strive to not only provide housing but also to create a supportive and nurturing environment where families can thrive. Our Community Building Program bridges the support gap by providing experiences like these that so many of us take for granted. Craft Day was a testament to this commitment, offering a space where children could express their creativity, build confidence, and experience the joy of giving.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt thanks to the volunteers, staff, and families who made this day possible. Your support and enthusiasm are what make BCHG a place where love and creativity can flourish. Here’s to many more days of crafting, community, and celebration!\n\nShare our mission by following along!\n\nInstagram: @buckscountyhousinggroup\n\nFacebook: Bucks County Housing Group\n\nTwitter: @housing4all\n\nWritten By: Dominic DiFrancesco\n\nHonoring Women’s Impact on Housing Equality\n\nMarch is a time to celebrate Women’s History Month, a period dedicated to recognizing the countless contributions and achievements of women throughout history. From pioneering activists to groundbreaking leaders, women have played an integral role in shaping societies and advancing various causes, including the fight for housing equality.\n\nAt Bucks County Housing Group (BCHG), we take this opportunity to reflect on the remarkable women who have made significant strides in advocating for affordable housing, challenging systemic barriers, and empowering communities. As we honor their legacies, we also acknowledge the ongoing efforts to address housing disparities and ensure equitable access for all.\n\nThroughout history, women have been at the forefront of housing activism, championing the rights of marginalized communities and demanding social change. Figures like Jane Addams, known for her pioneering work in establishing settlement houses in the late 19th century, provided vital resources and support to impoverished families, particularly women and children, in urban areas. Addams’ tireless efforts laid the foundation for future initiatives aimed at addressing housing insecurity and promoting social welfare.\n\nIn more recent times, women continue to lead the charge in advocating for affordable housing and combating homelessness. Individuals like Dorothy Mae Richardson, who founded the first Black-led public housing cooperative in the United States, exemplify the resilience and determination of women in creating sustainable housing solutions for underserved communities. Their vision and dedication serve as inspiration for organizations like BCHG as we strive to foster inclusive and resilient neighborhoods.\n\nMoreover, Women’s History Month provides an opportunity to recognize the intersectional nature of housing inequality and the disproportionate impact it has on women, particularly women of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those with disabilities. These marginalized groups often face compounded barriers to accessing safe and affordable housing, stemming from systemic discrimination and socioeconomic disparities.\n\nBCHG’s Work\n\nIn response, BCHG remains committed to advancing equity and inclusivity within our housing programs, ensuring that all individuals have the opportunity to thrive. Through initiatives focused on advocacy, education, and community outreach, we work to dismantle institutional barriers and create pathways to stable housing for those in need.\n\nAs we celebrate Women’s History Month, let us not only honor the trailblazing women who have paved the way for progress but also reaffirm our commitment to building a future where housing justice is a reality for all. By acknowledging the intersectional experiences of women and amplifying their voices in the fight for equitable housing, we can create a more just and compassionate society for generations to come.\n\nJoin us in commemorating Women’s History Month and standing in solidarity with women everywhere as we continue the journey towards housing equality and social justice.\n\nTogether, we can make a difference.\n\nAs we commemorate Black History Month, it’s crucial to reflect not only on the achievements and contributions of Black individuals, but also on the systemic challenges they continue to face. In Bucks County, there exists a stark reality: disparities in access to adequate food and housing disproportionately affect the Black community. At Bucks County Housing Group (BCHG), we believe it’s imperative to confront these issues head-on and work toward equitable solutions.\n\nDisparate Impacts on the Black Community\n\nFood insecurity is a pressing concern for many Black households in Bucks County. According to Feeding America, 15% of Bucks County’s food-insecure population is Black. At BCHG, we recognize the urgency of addressing these underlying systemic issues through initiatives like community food drives, partnerships with other nonprofits, and advocating for policies that promote food equity.\n\nSimilarly, housing insecurity remains a significant challenge for the Black community in Bucks County. Discriminatory practices, historical disinvestment, and economic barriers have perpetuated housing disparities, resulting in higher rates of homelessness among Black residents. (National Alliance to End Homelessness) As an organization dedicated to providing affordable housing solutions, BCHG is committed to expanding access to safe and stable housing for all members of our community. Through affordable housing developments, rental assistance programs, and advocacy efforts, we strive to address the root causes of housing instability and create pathways to homeownership for marginalized populations.\n\nOur Commitment\n\nIn commemorating Black History Month, we must not only celebrate the resilience and contributions of Black individuals but also acknowledge and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate inequities in our society. At BCHG, we are committed to fostering a community where everyone has access to nutritious food, safe housing, and opportunities for economic advancement. By working together with community partners and stakeholders, we can build a more just and inclusive Bucks County where every individual, regardless of race or background, can thrive. This Black History Month, let us recommit ourselves to the pursuit of equity and justice for all.\n\nBucks County Housing Group Partners with PA Department of Human Services to Promote 988 Hotline\n\nThe 988 Hotline\n\nIn a world where mental health struggles are increasingly prevalent, access to immediate support is crucial. Bucks County Housing Group (BCHG) has taken a significant step in addressing this need by partnering with the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to promote the 988 mental health hotline. This collaboration underscores our commitment to supporting the mental well-being of the community we serve.\n\nBCHG recognizes the interconnectedness of stable housing and mental health. As an organization dedicated to providing housing assistance, food, and support services to individuals and families in need, we see the need for mental health resources for our clients. Many of the individuals that we serve face various challenges, including mental health issues. Having access to reliable support is essential. The 988 hotline provides an immediate access point to those in need of mental health services.\n\nThe 988 hotline is crucial for those experiencing mental health emergencies. By dialing 988, individuals can connect with trained professionals who can provide guidance, support, and resources to help them navigate their situation. Support is always free and confidential.\n\nOur Partnership\n\nOur partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services aims to raise awareness about the 988 hotline within the community. Through our digital campaign, we are working to ensure that individuals in Bucks County are aware of this vital resource.\n\nOne of the key objectives of this partnership is to destigmatize mental health issues and encourage individuals to seek help when needed. By promoting the 988 hotline, we are sending a powerful message that mental health support is available, accessible, and free of judgment. Suicide prevention and crisis support are essential for safe, healthy communities. We must work together to normalize asking for help.\n\nMoreover, this partnership aligns with BCHG’s broader mission of empowering individuals and families to achieve self-sufficiency and stability. By providing access to mental health resources, we are not only addressing immediate crises but also supporting the long-term well-being of the community.\n\nThe significance of this partnership extends beyond just raising awareness. It embodies the collaborative efforts needed to address complex societal challenges. Through working together, BCHG and the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services are leveraging our resources and expertise to make a meaningful difference in the lives of those struggling with mental health issues.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we work together to raise awareness about the 988 hotline, partnerships like this serve as models for community-driven initiatives to promote mental health support. By coming together, organizations can amplify their impact and create a more supportive environment for individuals facing mental health challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, Bucks County Housing Group’s partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services to promote the 988 mental health hotline exemplifies the proactive approach needed to address mental health issues in our communities. By raising awareness, reducing stigma, and providing access to immediate support, BCHG is playing a vital role in supporting the mental well-being of the individuals and families it serves. This partnership serves as a testament to the power of collaboration in creating positive change and ensuring that mental health remains a priority for all. Your mental health matters.\n\nHow It Will Impact Pennsylvanians, And What You Can Do About It\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIf Congress fails to act by January 19, WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) will face a budget shortfall that could result in 2 million eligible families nationwide being turned away from the program. (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) As an organization dedicated to providing essential services to vulnerable communities, BCHG is deeply concerned about the potential ramifications of the budget shortfall on the individuals and families utilizing our food program.\n\nThe WIC Program and The Budget Shortfall:\n\nWIC is a crucial federal assistance program that provides nutrition education, healthy food, and support to low-income pregnant women, new mothers, and young children. (USDA) Currently, the WIC program serves about half of all infants born in the United States. Unfortunately, the budget that Congress is currently considering will fund the program at a $1 billion shortfall. The shortfall will cost the same amount as funding six months of benefits to all pregnant women and infants participating in WIC. (USDA) Individual states will likely create waitlists to join the program as a result of the shortfall, and several eligible families will be turned away from receiving the assistance they need.\n\nWhat this Means for Pennsylvania:\n\nThe WIC budget shortfall is projected to impact 51,000 Pennsylvanians by September 2024. (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities) To avoid such a stark impact, the USDA may choose to reallocate funding from their other programs toward WIC, but there is no guarantee that this will be feasible. There will likely also be a long-lasting impact on the perception of the WIC program. Turning eligible participants away due to inadequate funding will likely discourage people from applying in the future.\n\nImpact on Our Food Pantries:\n\nOur pantries and mobile markets are vital resources for those in need, offering a safe and reliable source of food in times of economic hardship. The potential increase in demand due to the WIC budget shortfall will place additional strain on these essential services. We anticipate welcoming new families to our pantries and mobile markets as a result of the shortfall. Demand for produce, milk, eggs, baby formula, and diapers will also likely increase. Finally, we anticipate an increase in the need for families who are already utilizing our programs. The level of support WIC will provide to those already on their programs is uncertain, so their need for food from our programs may increase.\n\nHow You Can Help:\n\nContact Your Representatives:\n\nUse the form here to contact your elected representatives. Be an advocate for policies that prioritize the well-being of pregnant women, new mothers, and young children.\n\nSpread the Word:\n\nShare this blog, our website, and our social media with your network to help spread awareness about the WIC budget shortfall. as well as the resources that BCHG provides to combat food and housing security.\n\nDonate to BCHG:\n\nMonetary support and food donations make a significant difference in our ability to meet increased demand at our food pantries. Support our mission by donating to our cause to help us prepare for the influx of patrons at our pantries.\n\nVolunteer Your Time:\n\nOffer your time and skills to assist at BCHG’s food pantries or other programs. Volunteering is a hands-on way to contribute to the community and support vulnerable individuals and families.\n\nOrganize Food Drives:\n\nCoordinate food drives with local businesses, schools, and community groups. Collecting non-perishable items can help ensure that our food pantries remain well-stocked to meet the growing demand.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe WIC budget shortfall is a challenge that will require collective action and community support. By raising awareness, advocating for policy change, and contributing to organizations like ours, we can make a positive impact on the lives of those facing food insecurity. Together, let’s ensure that every individual has access to the nutrition and support they need for a healthy future.\n\nWritten By: Amanda McGill\n\nReflecting on 2023 and Looking Ahead to the New Year\n\nWelcome to BCHG‘s 2023 Wrapped: Our Year in Review!
