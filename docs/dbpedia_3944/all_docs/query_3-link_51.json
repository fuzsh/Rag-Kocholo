We will acquaint ourselves with the theories of Method Acting and examine the ways in which these three icons of the screen embodied, molded and advanced the technique in their roles in such films as \"On the Waterfront,\" \"The Hustler,\" \"The Godfather,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" \"The Verdict\" and \"Raging Bull.\"\n\n*FILM 370U Comic Book Films (4)\n\nToday, it is impossible to ignore cinema's heavy reliance on comics. From superheroes to Spartan warriors, comics have moved from the fringes of pop culture to the center of mainstream film production. We take a look at the historical, textual, and cultural context of the larger comic universe that has overtaken Hollywood as the leading movie genre. We will study the similarities between the two mediums, and what makes each medium unique.\n\n*FILM 370U Contemporary Documentary (4)\n\nWith its growing popularity, new funding models, and ever-increasing technological possibilities, “documentary film” has become more prolific and democratic than ever. This course will look at documentary films made in the past 10 years and consider their relationship to both the larger history of non-fiction filmmaking and to other filmic forms. From recent critical hits such as 'Leviathan' or 'The Act of Killing' to cutting edge interactive and live/performed works, this course will look at the latest trends and sub-genres in documentary filmmaking and consider the ethical, historical, and aesthetic methodologies that inform them.\n\n*FILM 370U Contemporary Korean Cinema (4)\n\nThis course examines contemporary South Korean cinema created after the mid-90s. It aims to help students understand its historical, political, industrial, and aesthetic contexts as well as its relationships with other film cultures such as Hollywood, Hong Kong cinema, and Japanese cinema. By doing so, students will be able to appreciate Korean film genres, auteurs, styles, and historical and national allegory. It welcomes all students to this class including those with no prior knowledge of South Korea or exposure to South Korean film. This class will count towards the Film major's International Cinema requirement.\n\n*FILM 370U Film and Fascism (4)\n\nWhat is the relationship between political regimes and mass cultural forms of entertainment like the cinema? In this course, we will look at periods of great political turmoil in three different countries and analyze the roles played by film. In what ways did cinema give shape to political conflict? In what ways did it fuel turmoil or, alternatively, offer implicit solutions? We look at America during the period of Jim Crow or racial fascism, Germany under the Nazis, and China during the Mao years. We conclude by asking what our study can tell us about contemporary American cinema and the political conflicts the country faces today.\n\n*FILM 370U Film Noir 1940 to 1960 (4)\n\nThis course examines film noir from the twenty-year period considered to be the classic or first wave of film noir in the United States. Although critics, scholars, filmmakers and audiences have not developed a consensus about term film noir, we will consider it in relation to genre, ideology, aesthetics, and the representation of social difference. We will also investigate several recurring themes: suspicion of legal authority, the intersection of sexuality and violence, and the social displacement of individuals marked as other. Films shown for the course might include The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, The Killers, The Night of the Hunter, Gun Crazy, In a Lonely Place, and Touch of Evil.\n\n*FILM 370U Film Noir from 1960 (4)\n\nThis course examines film noir and neo-noir as concepts that, after the studio era, are referenced explicitly by filmmakers and audiences. We will consider film noir in relation to genre, ideology, aesthetics, and the representation of social difference in the post-studio era. Our study will include several recurring themes: suspicion of legal authority; the intersection of gender, sexuality, and violence; and the social displacement of individuals marked as \"other\" by notions of race, ethnicity, and region. Films shown for the course might include The Long Goodbye, Chinatown, Blue Velvet, The Grifters, L.A. Confidential, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Man Who Wasn't There, Memento, and Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.\n\n*FILM 370U Girlhood on Film (4)\n\nThis course will provide a broad survey of films and scholarship which center the perspectives, experiences and thoughts of girls. Taking a global focus, this course will cover films that explore the social, political and emotional experiences of girls from a range of racial, ethnic, class and gender experiences. Using the work of film and cultural scholars, historians and poets, students will study the formal and social context of films in addition to breaking down the visual, narrative and ethical strategies they employ. Neither this syllabus nor this course are intended to provide a complete overview of the filmmakers, films or scholarship related to girlhood on film. Rather, this course will attempt to center the experiences of girls from the global majority in an effort to raise larger questions about gender discrimination, labor politics, migration, queerness, reproductive rights and land sovereignty. As this is a film course, students will also be expected to explore and consider cinematic form, genre, memory, history and representation. This seminar will be discussion driven. The major focus of the class will be on the discussion and in-class analysis of the assigned films and readings. All students should come on time and prepared, having completed and thought about assigned watching and readings prior to class time.\n\n*FILM 370U Graphic Novels (4)\n\nComics share many features with films. They resemble movie storyboards, and both genres ask us to think about the space “in between”— between moments, between the visual and the verbal, and between images and time. In this course, we will read both comics and graphic novels (essentially comic books that tell one long, self-contained story) to examine their cinematic qualities but also to appreciate what is unique to this art form. Rather than focusing on the usual superhero history of comics, we will read an eclectic variety of books centered on the theme of “growing up.” For several, we’ll have the opportunity to compare the printed story to its film adaptation.\n\n*FILM 370U History of Stop Motion Animation (4)\n\nThis course will chart the history of stop motion animation, from the earliest experiments and the earliest surviving feature length animated film, Lotte Reiniger’s shadow puppet film The Adventures of Prince Achmed, to the contemporary boom in stop motion features. Along with an examination of the technological innovations and artistry of the pioneers of clay, puppets, cut outs, and object animation, we will examine the historical and social importance of the works, treating animation not as films for children, but as a medium for expression and artistry. We will study the groundbreaking creations of Willis O'Brian like King Kong, and the legacy of Ray Harryhausen's many creatures in Jason and the Argonauts, Clash of the Titans and others. Holiday classics like Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and The Nightmare Before Christmas will be studied alongside experimental and avant garde work from France, Japan, Chile, and Czech master Jan Svankmajer. The legacy of groundbreaking animator Helena Dayton Smith will frame the work of Caroline Leaf, Suzie Templeton and Kirsten Lepore. We will look at Britain’s long history of productions, from one of the very first animated films ever made, to the Wallace and Gromit films of Aardman Studios, Wes Anderson’s Fantastic Mr. Fox and the Brothers Quay. We will discuss the pioneers of special effects, such as Phil Tippet’s work for Star Wars alongside intimate character studies like Charlie Kauffman’s Anomalisa. And we will also focus on the special place Portland holds in the history of stop motion animation, from the work of Will Vinton to the current films from Laika studios, the recent releases of Henry Selick's Wendell and Wild, and Gulliermo del Toro's Pinocchio. Please note, although this is an online course, it will coincide with the upcoming Guillermo del Toro Pinocchio exhibit at the Portland Art Museum, and we will plan a visit if possible.\n\n*FILM 370U New Wave Cinemas (4)\n\nIn this course we examine key elements, themes and problems associated with the New Wave movement. The late 1950s/early 1960s saw the emergence of several groups of young, movie-obsessed, iconoclastic artists and critics who made conscious efforts to develop a new film aesthetic – one that rejected what they saw as the pretension and sentimentality of mainstream cinema. We will become familiar with the most famous of these movements, the French New Wave (La Nouvelle Vague), and with contemporaneous movements in Japan and Czechoslovakia. This transnational perspective will help us to understand how and why some themes became relevant in multiple contexts, and also how geo-political and cultural differences resulted in varied treatments of similar issues. “New Wave” has continued to be used as a blanket term to describe film aesthetics concerned with upsetting the status quo. We’ll conclude by looking at how the New Wave phenomenon continued as an influence in the late 20th century, and use it to question some of the ways scholars have studied and categorized film history.\n\n*FILM 370U Pacific Northwest on Screen (4)\n\nWhat images and stories come to mind when you think of the Pacific Northwest? Mountains and primeval forests? Quirky, rain and beer soaked cities? Reese Witherspoon “finding herself” in the “Wild”? Narcoleptic hustlers and drugstore cowboys?

This is an interdisciplinary course that will combine film studies with cultural studies and cultural geography in order to understand the values, identities and power relations that have been historically attached to this landscape and geographic region. In addition to looking at how place is represented in individual films, we’ll consider the influence of globalization, and production and distribution practices.\n\nFILM 374 Topics in Screenwriting (4)\n\nCourse in screenwriting involving short and long form screenplays, the analysis of narrative structure for the screen, and the practical application screenwriting techniques.

By the end of Hong Kong’s existence in 2020 as an autonomous city-state, “Hong Konger” had become an identity that signaled Hong Kong’s “adulthood” as no longer a British foster child but also not the offspring of the People’s Republic of China. Similarly, in Taiwan over the last decade, an identity has emerged that blends indigenous, Taiwanese, and mainland immigrant populations into one, thereby proposing that history itself, rather than ethnicity or language, defines Taiwan. With the aid of secondary readings, we will build an understanding of the two cinematic canons by asking how the aesthetic choices of our films shape their larger meaning. What do the directors’ decisions regarding narrative structure, point of view, use of language and dialects, cinematography, editing, and sound tell us about each film’s exploration of history, power, and identity? We will watch films by directors Fruit Chan, Wong Kar Wai, Ann Hui, Hou Hsiao Hsien, Edward Yang, Zero Chou, and others.

Prerequisites: FILM 131 and and FILM 132, in which you must earn a minimum C+ grade; Film major.\n\n*FILM 487 Contemporary Eastern European and Russian Cinema (4)\n\nFrom the Czech New Wave to Tarkovsky's poetic works (Solaris, Stalker) to the award-winning Ida and the devastating recent films of Andrei Zvyagintsev (Leviathan, Loveless), the Soviet Bloc and the ex-Soviet Bloc have been home to some of the most important filmmaking of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. This course begins in the 60s with the Czech New Wave and then explores Hungarian (Jansco, Szabo) and Polish (Wajda, Kieslowski) cinema, and ends in Russia by moving from Tarkovsky through Sokurov to Zvyaginstev. Topics will include: the aesthetic of the long take (\"sculpting in time\"), magical realism and surrealism, black comedy and satire, and the fraught history of cinematic representations of Eastern European and Russian involvement in the Holocaust.

To answer these questions, this course examines a diversity of complex issues related to gender and sexuality in digital culture within the global community as well as the U.S. culture. Students will read cutting- edge scholarship and investigate the ways in which digital technology forms and re-forms gender and sexuality from feminist and queer perspectives. Prerequisites: FILM 131 and and FILM 132, in which you must earn a minimum C+ grade; Film major.\n\n*FILM 487 High Economic Growth Cinema of Japan (4)\n\nThis course addresses the intersection of consumption and political-economy through film during the heyday of Japan’s High Economic Growth Period. Addressing films produced between 1955 to the early 1970s this course will consider the nature of popular film production in the waning days of Japan’s studio system. Through a variety of genres; yakuza, gangster, jidaigeki, musical, comedy, and thrillers we will seek to analyze films that were commercial successes in an era often noted for auteurs and “new waves” that played to festivals and art houses. What were the politics of the mainstream? Who were the notable figures in front of and behind the camera? What factors led to the downfall of the studio system precisely when Japan’s economy was skyrocketing? Screenings in Japanese w/English subtitles. Prerequisites: FILM 131 and and FILM 132, in which you must earn a minimum C+ grade; Film major.\n\n*FILM 487 Japanese Cinema + Media Survey (4)\n\nThis course surveys major developments in Japanese film history examining how patterns of distribution, exhibition, and reception have influenced film aesthetics and film style over the last century.
