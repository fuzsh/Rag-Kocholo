        "text": "Are you familiar with the Lawrence v. Texas Supreme Court ruling? If not, you should be. Just over two decades ago, in 2003, the decision decriminalized homosexual activity across the United States! This landmark ruling was a paramount step toward equality for LGBTQ+ individuals and made progress in reducing stigma and discrimination. It also helped lay the groundwork for further legal advancements like the legalization of same-sex marriage – which was legalized across the US in 2015. These are very significant and affirming judgments that recognize the dignity and rights of the LGBTQ+ community, who deserve privacy, respect, and freedom. While we can celebrate our progress, it’s important to remain committed to fighting for equal rights for all. Learn more here: https://lnkd.in/dw2nHV4h.\n\nJoin me today in signing The Human Rights Campaign “Come Out Against Hate” pledge. LGBTQIA+ 🏳️🌈🏳️⚧️💕✨ visibility and allyship is more important now than ever before in our nation’s 🇺🇸 and world’s 🌍 history. I will elevate LGBTQIA+ voices and not be complacent: the facts, the statistics, the data, the scientific publications do not lie: the collateral damage is thousands upon thousands upon thousands of young LGBTQIA+ human lives at stake here. I want to state this as clearly as possible to any LGBTQIA+ person: You are valuable, you are worthwhile, you are special, you are amazing, and you are perfect just as you are right now in this very moment, and also who you are becoming and growing into with each and every passing day - do not let a single soul tell you otherwise 🤗💞🏳️🌈🏳️⚧️🌈✨ Read the following The Trevor Project documentation of the studies: ❗️41% of LGBTQIA+ young people seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. ❗️56% of LGBTQIA+ youth who wanted mental health care in the past year were not able to get the resources they need. ❗️A majority of young LGBTQIA+ people are being bullied and harassed at school ❗️Nearly 1 in 3 LGBTQIA+ young people said their mental health was poor most of the time or always due to anti-LGBTQIA+ policies and legislation https://lnkd.in/eVjkcEmG This is going to be a full on team effort. Let’s fight this climate of hate with love💞, together. #LGBTQIA #LGBTQ #LGBTQEquality #LGBTQRIGHTS #allyship #inclusion #representation #DEIB #Diversity The Trevor Project The Human Rights Campaign\n\nAcross many of the anti-LGBTQ+ attacks that have surged through legislatures in recent years is the tactic of preemption – which limits the authority of local governments and lawmakers to pass measures protecting LGBTQ+ individuals and families. From anti-transgender medical care bans to efforts to censor inclusive curriculum to bans on drag performance, abusive preemption runs through the heart of this barrage – and together, we must resist these efforts. Read how in a new white paper we just published in partnership with A Better Balance and Equality Federation: https://lnkd.in/e4Wzbf45 #PreemptingProgress\n\nNavigating the later stages of life can be intricate, especially when you're part of a community that faces substantial discrimination. For LGBTQ+ individuals, these challenges are all too real. While concerns about discrimination might cast a shadow, remember that you hold rights that can be upheld and protected. By understanding these rights and enlisting the guidance of a skilled attorney, you can ensure that your later years unfold according to your wishes. Explore the article below to delve into the strategies that safeguard your rights and create a legacy free from discrimination's grasp. 👇 https://bit.ly/45qTg3X #lgbtqrights #edlerlaw #estateplanning\n\nDoes #PrideMonth help raise enough awareness about LBGTQ+ issues? 69% of the readers of our publisher Yahoo said ‘No’ and we also agree that waving the rainbow flag just for one month a year is definitely not enough. Is it important to dedicate an entire month to the achievements and challenges of the LGBTQ+ community? Yes. Is it equally important to address these things the rest of the year? Also yes. LGBTQ+ issues go beyond Pride Month. Because as we see in the results of the surveys, the rights and freedoms of LGBTQ+ people are still not a given and in many people’s opinion are once again under threat. It is therefore important to show awareness and support beyond Pride Month. Because in reality, every month is Pride Month.\n\nIt's International Pronouns Day!! Very proud of the work #OCPride have done over the past year to generate awareness and action regarding the use of pronouns, and why they are so important for the LGBTQ+ community. Top Tips: ✔ Update your email signature block, and LinkedIn details to display your pronouns ✔ Introduce yourself by including your pronouns after your name, when speaking to somebody for the first time ✔ If you're unsure of somebody's pronouns, just ask. And if referring to them, but they're not around for you to ask, use 'they' Remember, you may think your pronouns may be obvious, but this is not the case for everyone. Pronouns create a space where people are encouraged and safe to share their true identity. The world could use a few more safe spaces. #LGBTQ #Pronouns #Inclusion"
