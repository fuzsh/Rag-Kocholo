In short, when you bring diverse perspectives to a problem, you uncover more surprising and innovative solutions than you do when everyone looks the same and has similar life experiences.\n\nWe hire talented, unique individuals of many backgrounds and cultures, who are encouraged to be their authentic selves—and who support their team members to do the same."
