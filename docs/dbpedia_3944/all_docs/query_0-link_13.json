        "text": "Dear Friends and Neighbors,\n\nJune is here, brimming with sunshine, vibrant energy, and a sense of new beginnings. The month invites us to celebrate our rich history, embrace the present, and look forward to a brighter future infused with pride for our communities’ achievements.\n\nJune began by honoring a pivotal moment in history – the 80th Anniversary of D-Day on June 6th. On that day in 1944, Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy, demonstrating unparalleled bravery and sacrifice in the fight for freedom. If you didn’t get the chance, I hope you’ll take a moment to view at least part of the beautiful and moving ceremony. Let’s always remember the veterans who served, especially those who gave their lives to secure the freedom and peace we too often take for granted.\n\nJune is also Pride Month, a time for jubilant celebration and a time to celebrate and support the LGBTQ community. June includes the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots of June 28, 1969, a pivotal event that sparked the modern fight for what we now know as LGBTQ rights. Throughout the month of June, parades, events, and activities will fill the streets with color and celebration. Although Orange County Pride happens in October, LGBTQ Center OC is offering a range of Pride-related events all month long. Did you know LGBTQ Center OC, which was first established in 1971, is one of the oldest LGBTQ community centers in the entire country?\n\nJune 14th is National Flag Day, offering a moment to reflect on the adoption, in 1777, of the Stars and Stripes as our national symbol. Our flag continues to represent the enduring ideals of freedom, justice, and unity, and I hope you’ll display it proudly as a reminder of the resilience and spirit that define our country.\n\nJune 19th marks Juneteenth, a pivotal day in American history. In the final days of the Civil War, news of the Emancipation Proclamation moved slowly and relied on the advance of Union troops. It wasn’t until June 19th, 1865, that the last enslaved African Americans in Texas finally received news of their freedom. Juneteenth has been officially celebrated in California since 2003 and became a federal holiday in 2021. The day is a celebration of Black American culture, heritage, and progress. There will be events all around Orange County, including Irvine, Anaheim, and Buena Park, in support of Black-owned businesses and deepening our understanding of the ongoing journey toward equality and justice.\n\nThe Summer Solstice, which takes place on June 20th (at 1:50pm, to be precise), is the perfect time to enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, boating, or just basking in the sun. It’s also a great chance to enjoy everything our National Parks have to offer, something you can do for free on June 19th, when all National Parks are providing free entrance! No better opportunity to embrace the beauty of California and the joy that summer brings.\n\nAs you navigate June, I hope you’ll embrace a spirit of unity, reflection, and celebration. Each day gives us a chance to learn and come together as a community. Stay safe and cool during the hot days, and if you see us out and about, stop by and say hello!\n\nAll the best,\n\nJosh Newman\n\nSenator, 29th District\n\nDistrict Updates\n\nSaddleback College Commencement\n\nThis graduation season, I had the privilege of delivering the keynote address at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. The ceremony recognized 3,456 graduates from Saddleback, who collectively earned 4,920 associate degrees and 2,956 certificates of achievement. Of the graduates, 1,833 graduated with honors and 177 are age 55 and older.\n\nIn addition to those earning degrees and certificates, more than 3,500 of these proud Saddleback students will be transferring to four-year colleges and universities in the fall all across the nation.\n\nYou can watch the full ceremony here. Congratulations to all the graduates. Go Bobcats!\n\nBuena Park Memorial Day Remembrance Service\n\nOn Memorial Day last month, I was honored to speak as part of Buena Park’s Memorial Day Remembrance. This moving annual service at the Civic Center honored the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.\n\nThe event was a touching tribute to our fallen service members. It featured presentations by the American Legion Post 354 and Elks Lodge 2046 and beautiful musical offerings from The Accidentals.\n\nIt was a reminder that the holiday isn’t just a day off work but a tribute to the incredibly brave and patriotic men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to preserve our freedoms and protect our nation.\n\nInformation Panel with Pakistani Ambassador\n\nEarly in May, I had the opportunity to join a panel put on by the Pakistani Ambassador to the United States, His Excellency Masood Khan. The panel, which was hosted by Council of Pakistan Chair Dr. Imran Sharief, was to initiate conversations between the U.S. and Pakistan. It focused on how to build stronger diplomatic ties at the federal, state, and local levels. We also discussed energy, technology, agriculture, and mineral extraction.\n\nI thank the Ambassador for hosting the panel and the continued conversations about ways our two countries can work together, and want to also convey my gratitude to Dr. and Mrs. Sharief for their typically gracious hospitality and civic leadership.\n\nMaking Spirits Bright Toy Drive Committee Planning\n\nIn May, I met with the “Making Spirits Bright” toy drive committee. This wonderful group hosts an annual charitable giving program to collect and donate toys for military families stationed at Marine Air Ground Task Force Training Command and Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, located in San Bernardino in the Mojave Desert.\n\nThanks to the energy and generosity of the members of the committee—Dr. Hong Diana Zhao, Lee Mao, Sonja Reed, Kathleen Newe, and Theresa Lee (L to R)—over the past five years, the program has expanded exponentially, from 125 gifts the first year to an astonishing nearly 2,300 gifts this past year for the children of service members stationed at one of the country’s most remote military outposts. As they look toward next Christmas, they continue to expand their efforts to include raising money and collecting food and other resources for service members and their families.\n\nI look forward to seeing their already impressive positive impact continue to grow as they build relationships with non-profits and other military and veteran organizations to provide support to our military families.\n\nBrea Olinda High School Charcuterie Contest\n\nAt Brea Olinda High School, former Teacher-of-the-year Nadia Fox’s French 3 students took a break from their textbooks to explore French cuisine and culture. Organized in teams, these energetic and enthusiastic students worked collaboratively to bring their uniquely themed creations to life.\n\nI was joined in the judging of their charcuterie creations by District Superintendent Brinda Leon and Brea Olinda Principal Josh Porter. It was a close competition and even more challenging to pick our winners. Students impressed with their creativity, teamwork, and demonstrating their knowledge and appreciation for French cuisine and culture.\n\nUC Irvine College of Health Sciences Q&A\n\nIn May, I met with a group of student pharmacists at UC Irvine College of Health Sciences to discuss my bill, SB 362, which banned the assignment of quotas in California pharmacies. The bill, which was authored in partnership with the California Pharmacists Association, was the first of its kind in the nation and continues to protect both pharmacists and consumers.\n\nSince its passage, California pharmacies are no longer allowed to impose quotas on prescription or pharmacy services, enabling pharmacists to decide how much time they need to fill prescriptions or assist customers and thereby better serve the healthcare needs of the clients in their care. Pharmacists are, after all, a vital part of our healthcare system, and I’m happy to continue working to implement common-sense policies that prioritize the safety of all California consumers.\n\nCalifornia Council for Adult Education State Conference\n\nOn May 10, I was privileged to speak as part of the California Council for Adult Education's state conference. The conference included diverse presentations on topics ranging from online curriculum integration to workforce preparation. Continuing education offers immense benefits in unlocking the human capital of new arrivals, augmenting skills, and building financial literacy for all Californians.\n\nSenate District 29's Citizen of the Month: Stirley Jones, Track & Field Head Coach at Yorba Linda Hight School\n\nI’m very proud to be able to recognize Stirley Jones as Senate District 29’s Citizen of the Month. For more than nine very distinguished years, Coach Jones has dedicated himself to nurturing student-athletes as a track and field coach at Yorba Linda High School, including as head coach. His guidance has led Mustang student-athletes to remarkable achievements, including top-10 finishes at the CIF Finals, breaking school records, and competing in state championships.\n\nAdding to his accomplishments, the number of Yorba Linda seniors advancing to collegiate-level track and field has grown from two at the beginning of the school year to seven students by the end of track season.\n\nStirley, who is himself an accomplished athlete, was inspired to begin coaching high school students when he noticed many students, particularly from underserved communities, weren’t getting opportunities to advance to the collegiate level. His coaching philosophy focuses on building self-confidence in each of his student-athletes to help them overcome barriers that could limit their performance and ultimately realize their full potential.\n\nBeyond coaching, Stirley is hard at work training for the upcoming 2024 Paralympic Games in Paris, where he will represent Team USA as a Track and Field Paralympian. Despite being diagnosed with Keratoconus, a corneal thinning disorder that causes visual distortion, Stirley remains steadfast in his commitment to coaching his students and competing nationwide. He strives to make sports more inclusive by sharing his story, serving as a role model, and encouraging more students to feel welcomed and supported in playing the sport they choose.\n\nI’m grateful for Stirley’s commitment to supporting our student-athletes. Please join me in congratulating him on this well-deserved honor and wishing him luck at the upcoming 2024 Paralympic Games!\n\nSenate District's 29's Restaurant of the Month: I Got My Sound Chicken\n\nIn keeping with the May celebration of AAPI Heritage Month, I’m pleased to announce I Got My Sound Chicken in Fullerton as Senate District 29’s Restaurant of the Month.\n\nLee Sang Yoon embarked on his culinary journey as a young man in Seoul, South Korea. He made a living as a musician and dancer while also working in food service and professional kitchens. Eventually, Mr. Lee, as he prefers, opened his own business, one which has since grown into 18 restaurants across Korea in a category known there as “School Food.”\n\nPaying homage to his musical roots, Mr. Lee ventured into the world of fried chicken and opened the first I Got My Sound Chicken location in South Korea four years ago. With the opening of its second location in Fullerton, a remarkable 6,000 miles away, Mr. Lee has joined our district’s vibrant culinary landscape.\n\nThe restaurant features personalized décor by Mr. Lee, with classic radios, disco balls, vinyl record-themed wallpaper, and a floor-height pyeong-sang-style communal seating area that evokes the traditional pavilions of rural Korea. Its marinades use ingredients like seaweed, soy, and mala spice, with a unique Korean-Japanese fusion.\n\nIt’s my great pleasure to honor I Got My Sound Chicken as Senate District 29’s latest “Restaurant of the Month.\"\n\nStaff Highlights\n\nFrom Nathan Bass, serving the cities of Fullerton, Placentia, and Rowland Heights:\n\nStudents at Fullerton School District have been hard at work over the past year designing, funding, and constructing a tiny home on the Nicolas Junior High School campus in Fullerton. Measuring just over 700 square feet, the home was built as a temporary shelter for in-district families at risk of homelessness.\n\nI attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the home in late June to celebrate its completion and learn more about the multidisciplinary effort to raise it from the ground.\n\nIn a time where the median home price in Orange County is reaching $1 million and studies show at least a third of area families are struggling to get by, efforts like this to create shelters and support resources for families experiencing homelessness are becoming ever more important.\n\nThe completion of this visionary tiny home project by Fullerton School District is a powerful affirmation of the local commitment to building a community where all families can achieve housing security and economic hardship does not hamper access to quality educational opportunities.\n\nFrom Christiane Salamat, serving the cities of Chino Hills, Diamond Bar, Walnut, and Industry:\n\nIt was a privilege to attend the grand opening of Easterseals Southern California’s new Autism Therapy Services Center in Covina this month.\n\nFor over a century, Easterseals has provided essential, on-the-ground services for individuals with disabilities throughout the nation. This new facility in the heart of the San Gabriel Valley will allow the organization to expand its outreach and further bolster those services, with a special focus on resources for children with autism.\n\nFrom diagnostic services to different forms of therapy, it was wonderful to get a glimpse of the holistic support Easterseals provides to our local youth with disabilities.\n\nFrom Sheen Sidhu, serving the cities of Buena Park, Yorba LInda, and Brea:\n\nEach year, the Yorba Linda Woman’s Club (YLWC) presents the graduating class of high school seniors with scholarship awards that mark their upcoming commencement and extraordinary achievements throughout their high school careers.\n\nYLWC awarded $45,000 across multiple categories, such as student scholarships, teacher grants, and art contest prizes. This year’s graduating class demonstrated incredible talent and skill, and it was a privilege to recognize them for their hard work over the last four years. It was exciting to learn of each student’s plans after graduation, whether pursuing a business degree, earning a cosmetology license, or taking a gap year to travel.\n\nCongratulations to the Class of 2024! I look forward to seeing all the wonderful things you will accomplish and achieve.\n\nFrom Christopher Kent, serving the cities of West Covina, La Habra, and Cypress:\n\nThis month, I visited the Boys & Girls Clubs of Greater Anaheim-Cypress Clubhouse with our district intern, Victoria. During our visit, the center was preparing for their annual Teen Short Film Festival, which featured the creative work of several youth members who created, filmed, and edited short films dedicated to this year’s theme of “Mental Health Awareness.”\n\nServing thousands of families in the Orange County region, the center offers a wide range of essential resources, including therapy and counseling, after-school services, food distribution, college and career readiness courses, as well as many other impactful programs.\n\nVictoria and I had the opportunity to tour their newest facility, the Bandai Teen Center, which provides a space for teens to work, learn, and play. The Teen Center opened in 2019 after receiving a generous donation from the video game publisher Bandai Namco America Inc. (formerly headquartered in Cypress). The center was filled with students who just finished school, and we saw them utilizing all the different resources and activities the Boys & Girls Clubs have to offer.\n\nThank you to interim CEO Erika Gary and Director of Program Development Jeri Barber for inviting us to tour the facility. We wish the Boys & Girls Clubs the very best as they kick off their summer camps and programming!\n\nFrom Kimberly Rangel, serving the cities of Anaheim, Stanton, and La Palma:\n\nIn May, I had the distinct pleasure of attending the grand opening of three Project Homekey housing communities in the City of Stanton. Following the success of Project Roomkey, Project Homekey became a statewide effort to support our unhoused population by converting motels into permanent and supportive housing.\n\nThe newest additions to Project Homekey are the Aurora Vista, Clara Vista, and Iluma Apartments, which feature 153 units, all in the City of Stanton! In addition to housing, residents will have access to resource officers and informational workshops on finances, budgeting, and much more.\n\nAttendees of the grand opening had the privilege of hearing from a resident speaker, who courageously shared her experience with homelessness and expressed her feelings of relief now that she has a space that is safe and her own. Attendees also had the opportunity to tour the apartments and community spaces.\n\nCongratulations to the City of Stanton staff and residents for believing in this critical effort, and my best wishes on your continued success and service.\n\nDistrict Resources\n\nSUN Bucks is a program designed to help California families purchase groceries for their school-age children during the summer months when school meals aren’t available.\n\nEligible children are automatically enrolled based on existing school and social services data, with each child receiving $120 on an EBT card ($40 per month for June, July, and August). These funds can be used at most grocery stores, farmers’ markets, and other authorized retailers to purchase food items such as fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, and whole grains."
