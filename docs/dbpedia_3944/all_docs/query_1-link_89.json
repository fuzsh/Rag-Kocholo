        "text": "Did you know that what we now know as Pride Month started back in 1969, with the Stonewall uprising?\n\nWhy is it called the Stonewall Uprising?\n\nAlso known as the Stonewall Riots or the Stonewall Rebellion, it is named after the events at the Stonewall Inn in New York on 28th June 1969.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nAfter a violent police raid in the early morning hours of 28th June, the patrons, staff, and neighbourhood surrounding the Stonewall Inn fought back by way of protesting.\n\nThis wasn't the first time police raided the bar - it was a common experience for many patrons of LGBTQ-friendly venues at the time.\n\nOver the following days, rioting and protests took place, with activist groups demanding the right to live freely and openly regarding their sexual orientation.\n\nWhy did it happen?\n\nThere had been growing tension between the LGBTQIA+ community and the police for decades.\n\nFor the patrons of the bar, all they wanted was to be able to live authentically as themselves. They were not able to do so simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\nStonewall Legacy\n\nThe fight for LGBTQIA+ rights was already burning in the background at the time of the Uprising, with Stonewall adding fuel to the flames and bringing the fight to the forefront.\n\nLGBTQIA+ rights groups were founded in the light of Stonewall, and the first anniversary of the Uprising saw America's first gay pride parade take place in Manhattan.\n\nWe celebrate Pride Month to celebrate the diversity of love, and people being able to live authentically and remember those who have fought and continue to fight against oppression.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about the Stonewall Uprising, you can click here.\n\nThe UK charity Stonewall has some excellent information and resources."
