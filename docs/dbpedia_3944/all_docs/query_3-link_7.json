        "text": "When the world got its first look at the “Stonewall” trailer in August, reaction was swift and withering with some even calling for LGBT people to boycott the film, a dramatization of the 1969 New York riots that were a turning point for gay rights.\n\nThe film was assailed, from snarky social media posts (“Ah yes! That wonderful point in gay history where super models got really angry”) to outright vitriol. Pat Cordova-Goff, who identifies as a “transwomyn of color” is calling for a boycott with the Gay-Straight Alliance Network. “Do not throw money at the capitalistic industry that fails to recognize true s/heros. Do not support a film that erases our history. Do not watch ‘Stonewall,’” she writes.\n\nThe beefs are essentially that historical events have been “whitewashed,” that trans characters are pushed to the sidelines and played by non-trans actors and that, as Tim Teeman wrote for the Daily Beast, “everyone appears to have been bused in from laughably predictable central casting.” The events are centered around a fictional character named Danny, a white Midwestern teen kicked out of his home for being gay. Ironically, few have pointed out that Jeremy Irvine, the 25-year-old “War Horse” actor who plays him, is straight.\n\nIrvine, director Roland Emmerich and writer Jon Robin Baitz (all white, the latter two gay) have defended the film, which opens on Friday, Sept. 25 (it’s screening at area theaters such as Landmark E Street Cinema, ArcLight Bethesda, Angelika Film Center and more). They counter that most of the criticism is based on the trailer, not the film itself, that the true events of the riots are shrouded in myth and that any dramatization uses artistic license to varying degrees. Legendary gay writer Larry Kramer defended the filmmakers.\n\nEmmerich, widely known for helming major films like “Independence Day” (1996), “Godzilla” (1998) and the Mel Gibson vehicle “The Patriot” (2000), is already at work on his next project. The German-born auteur spoke to the Blade by phone from his Los Angeles home. His comments have been slightly edited for length.\n\nWASHINGTON BLADE: What was the genesis of “Stonewall”?\n\nROLAND EMMERICH: Actually a producer friend of mine, Michael Fossat, proposed it to me. I was kind of like, “I don’t know, with so many great gay directors, why should I do a gay movie?” But then I started checking it out and read a lot and at the same time I took a tour of the Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Center and saw the homeless youth program and I realized that 40 percent of homeless youth are LGBT. Compared to the overall population, that’s actually quite a big number and so slowly I kind of started thinking that maybe this is something for me. We started looking for a writer and I read this terrific play by Robbie Baitz and it kind of came together. First we wrote a script and then we took it from there.\n\nBLADE: The trailer got a lot of criticism. Did it give the wrong impression of the film or were people too quick to judge the film based on it?\n\nEMMERICH: I like the trailer. We premiered it at the GLAAD awards and it got a standing ovation. Nobody had any criticism of it there. It’s very unfortunate that some people kind of felt it was kind of some sort of whitewashing, but it isn’t. The film itself uses a white character as a catalyst but the film itself is actually quite ethnically diverse. It has, you know, like all facets of the LGBT community both historic and invented. I didn’t comment on it much because I really felt I didn’t want to comment on criticism of the trailer.\n\nBLADE: I’m not a filmmaker. What dramatic purpose does it serve to have a character such as Danny to center the action around? Why was that a device you wanted to utilize?\n\nEMMERICH: Well, a friend of mine told me his story and that interested me a lot because it’s still a story that happens today with kids getting thrown out of their homes for being gay. These are often quaint kind of middle-class homes and then they end up on the street and I just felt that would be a unique approach because these stories show that you can be in that situation and hold on to your dignity and your dream and not lose them in the process. So it was a coming-of-age story with kids, which I could imagine very well. Also, the overall theme was one of unrequited love. When you look at the movie, it’s a lot about people who love somebody and it’s not that the other person doesn’t love them, but they cannot be together and yet at the end they all come together and create something great. That was overall, dramatically, I’d say, when I started with Robbie, you first talk about the approach you want to take. We are also big (J.D.) Salinger fans and he was a big writer in the ‘60s, you know. So that was a type of an influence, and it all came together from there. When you do your research on this, you realize there’s not really one standout character in these riots. I loved the idea that it was this group of homeless kids that we know about who were part of it. Just an overall riot of many people who had just had it. You know how riots happen. It was actually really sparked by a lesbian who resisted arrest. That’s what really threw everything into high gear.\n\nBLADE: Theoretically could the film have worked with somebody like Marsha P. Johnson as the protagonist? Could you have gotten a green light with that approach?\n\nEMMERICH: Well we never did get a green light. I gave my own green light. I love the Marsha P. Johnson character. I have friends who are trans women, but it felt to me like I’m a white male, I’m openly gay and we can have all forms of sexuality in this film, but I think it’s good to use somebody very close to yourself, you know, and find truth in that. We also didn’t want to make the Jonny Beauchamp character (Ray, a composite) as just Sylvia Rivera because she was the one who said she was at the Stonewall that night. I didn’t want to invent stuff around Sylvia. She was not a club kid and didn’t really have any relationship like that. So all this kind of came together through discussions and we used a lot of historical characters but also with these invented characters. I thought it was a better approach, at least for me, to show the feel this time had. We talked to some Stonewall veterans and we only found white guys, you know? I think actually there was one who wanted to call me but then this person died shortly after.\n\nBLADE: How was the shoot?\n\nEMMERICH: Well it was odd because we wanted to make it first on location in New York but it was too expensive and we found they’d never let us do what we wanted to do there. … New York is a very expensive town. So we ended up doing it in Montreal where we were able to use some Canadian actors and get a huge tax rebate. Once we decided to film it there, everything came together nicely. We had a very nice shoot, like 42 days, and it was one, big, happy family.\n\nBLADE: Was it hard to get it financed?\n\nEMMERICH: It was about $17 million and we got like $4 million back in tax rebates and the rest we did as a pre-sale to Germany and other countries. A friend of mine and I put in the rest. We went to all my usual contacts and they all said, “Oh, this is too niche, there’s no real big name in it,” and blah, blah, blah.\n\nBLADE: Are the Hollywood bean counters squeamish about gay themes or is there a legit point in the math?\n\nEMMERICH: No, they’re not. When somebody like, you know, Sean Penn takes on Harvey Milk, they’re all there because they know that’s an actor who can win an Oscar. So there’s more incentive to do films like that where the actor can be the incentive. They also say things like, “Why is he making a movie like that, why is he not making one of his big movies where we can make a lot of money?” And I’m saying, “I will make those movies, but I want to make other movies too.” I like these smaller projects sometimes, like “Anonymous.” Nobody wanted me to do that one either, but it’s fine.\n\nBLADE: What’s it like making a small film like “Stonewall” versus a big-budget action spectacle like “Independence Day?” Do the headaches increase with the scope as one might expect or not necessarily?\n\nEMMERICH: I think it is more complex making a film like “Independence Day” because you’re dealing with a little bit more complex techniques, like shooting half the movie on bluescreen, where it’s very, very tough to keep the actors involved. “Stonewall” was a very different method, a very old-fashioned method actually, where we actually built the street and everything, then in the back we had some photographic backgrounds and maybe only one or two scenes were bluescreen, the march and one other scene. It was a very gritty atmosphere on the set and I think the actors get something out of that. … I got a lot of knowledge working on those big movies that I could use in “Stonewall,” you know? I just kind of know how to make things realistic looking when they’re not.\n\nBLADE: Sometimes controversy works in your favor. Will it help you here?\n\nEMMERICH: Maybe it brought more attention to the film. I don’t know if people would have known about it otherwise. Now at least the gay people know. Sometimes a controversy works against you and sometimes it works for you. We won’t know till it comes out. It’s an interesting dynamic. Nobody knows what will happen but you never know this with any movie what will happen. I’m quite content. I’m already making my next movie. I’m very proud of the movie we did and everybody who was involved.\n\nBLADE: How much straight support will the movie need to be successful?\n\nEMMERICH: That will be a very interesting thing. … When we tested the movie, it actually tested better with straight people than gay because straight people don’t have all this sense of they think they know what it was about. Gay people think, “Oh, it was because Judy Garland died,” and they think they know the story, where as straight audiences don’t think like that. They think, “What was the story like and how did I get into the story and what did I learn?” They were actually amazed at how emotional they got in the story. I hope for a wider audience but it’s also not a big release. It’s like a 100-print release, so it’s perfect for me. We’ll see what happens.\n\nBLADE: Have you been out your entire career?\n\nEMMERICH: At the beginning in Germany I wasn’t out because I never wanted to become the gay director and it was kind of a typical thing in Germany, if you were out it was like you were a gay director and you only did gay movies, so I didn’t think it was good to come out. It was also a different time. Then I came to America and, of course, my friends knew, but at a certain point I realized I’m making big movies, I can be out, so I came out. This was like maybe 20 years ago, which was a bit late. I’m 59 turning 60, so it was a little different time. For me, “Stonewall” represents this mythical moment. I went to Christopher Street the first time I was in New York and stood in front of the Stonewall and it was always kind of like Germany to me. A little bit of this coming out, this proud moment because of what happened there.\n\nWe often hear the term lobbyist associated with negative connotations. Think oil and gas initiatives that often seek to curtail environmental protections to further their industries. Consider “big pharma,” which is often vilified for keeping healthcare costs high. However, there are lobbyists fighting for our rights – not just LGBTQ rights, but human rights as well. Brad Howard, founder and president of the Corcoran Street Group (CSG) is one such out, gay lobbyist advocating for equality and equity.\n\nTo start, Howard shares his definition of a lobbyist, which transcends the stereotype that the term originates with politicos literally waiting in D.C. hotel lobbies hoping to hobnob with politicians to foster their interests, often with cash in hand.\n\n“Understanding how government works can be incredibly difficult, even to those on the inside,” he shared. “Lobbying is a constitutionally protected right explicitly guaranteed in the First Amendment – the right to petition our government. At its most basic level, lobbying is essentially contacting a public official to express your opinion or ask them to take a certain action. So, if you have ever emailed or called your city council rep or Member of Congress – or even tagged them on social media – you lobbied.”\n\nHoward, who came to Washington from a conservative background in Arkansas, had a journey from working with Republican leaders and causes to being more libertarian before eventually joining with the Blue Dog Democrats. This is quite a change for a young man who founded a teenage GOP group in high school, chaired the college Republicans group at Hendrix University, and became vice chair of Arkansas College Republicans.\n\nSo, how did a nice conservative Christian Republican whose parents voted for Ross Perot instead of Bill Clinton from the Bible Belt end up as a gay lobbyist?\n\n“I was subconsciously rejecting any attempt to live my life the way someone told me to … a Libertarian streak if you will,” Howard said. “I was always pro-choice and pro-marriage equality as I didn’t want the government anywhere near me. Throughout all of this, I was starting to understand that I was gay and what that meant for my future in politics, it was bleak. Then the Bush-Cheney campaign in 2004 started pushing constitutional amendments banning gay marriage in states across the country to drive evangelical turnout. That ran counter to my politics – to the basic principle of promoting individual liberty. So I left the party then and graduated college as an independent in 2006 with the goal of moving to Washington as quickly as possible.”\n\nBy 2007 he was living in Washington, D.C., interning for Simon Rosenberg’s New Democrat Network, and pursuing a master’s from American University. Coming out for Howard happened on the first day he entered college, quite a “daunting and scary” task summed up by him as: “I have blue eyes. I love playing cards. I’m a terrible, but very confident karaoke singer. Oh, by the way, I’m gay.”\n\nThe “it’s part of me, but not my whole identity,” is often expressed by those on the – shall we say – cusp of coming out. He cites a Foundry United Methodist pastor’s message as impetus for coming out as a defining part of his identity.\n\n“That seed of shame you feel for being gay – that was not planted there by God; it was planted there by the church, and I’m sorry,” here he’s referring to a sermon by Pastor Ginger Gaines-Cerelli. “I can’t describe what it [felt] like to be 33 years old and have your world completely upended like that. It wasn’t just the statement, which answered a question that had long haunted me; it was also the apology. I didn’t even know that I needed an apology, but I did, and it worked.”\n\nBefore starting CSG, he worked at a bipartisan lobbyist group and was mentored by former Chief of Senate Staff Bob Van Heuvelen. Howard describes his mentor’s approach to lobbying as guided by a strong moral compass, and seeing people as people, not transactions.\n\nThe way it should be: Since corporations are not people.\n\nHoward also sits on the board of directors for Q Street, as treasurer. Q Street is an LGBTQ lobbyist organization. Yesenia Henninger, the out queer president of Q Street since January of this year – and board member for five years – explains in further detail what her group does to foster queer rights.\n\n“Q Street is the nonprofit, nonpartisan, professional association of LGBTQ lobbyists and public policy advocates. Q Street was formed to be the bridge between LGBTQ advocacy organizations, LGBTQ+ lobbyists on K Street,” District lingo for queer lobbyists, “and our colleagues and allies on Capitol Hill. Q Street has more than 3,000 recipients of our monthly newsletter, hundreds of attendees at our receptions, and our monthly luncheons have featured speakers such as Members of Congress, campaign managers, activists, plaintiffs in the most important LGBTQ+ Supreme Court cases of our time, and the Secretary of the Army. Q Street hosts nearly 25 receptions, lunches, and professional development events every year. Our goal is to provide the best networking opportunities and professional development trainings so our members continue to grow within the ranks of their field.”\n\nAccording to Henninger there has been a growing population of queer lobbyists since the Obama years. Marriage equality, an impetus for Howard to perhaps “come out politically” equally spurred their growth. After Obama, this presence fought to maintain rights gained. This is amazing growth considering at one time people working for our equity did so in an almost secretive fashion.\n\nAn aside here, Sean Strub the founder of POZ Magazine, wrote a powerful book in 2014 called “Body Counts: A Memoir of Politics, Sex, AIDS and Survival,” which chronicles advocacy in D.C. in the years after Stonewall.\n\nThe majority of these K Street lobbyists are in their 30s and 40s. Although Henninger shares there are more junior and more senior-ranking lobbyists in terms of age or career.\n\nWhat do they do? Is it office-to-event, sleep, repeat? Henninger explained that a queer lobbyist’s lifestyle varies depending on the issue area they focus on. Her organization has lobbyists working in policy as well as members who focus on energy and transportation issues, and topics all across the spectrum.\n\n“The lobbyists and advocates whose roles require them to engage in political activity may also have different lifestyles than those that do not. They likely have fundraisers (sometimes one, sometimes multiple) that they attend after work with Members of Congress or other politicians. However, we also have many public policy advocate members who spend their day talking to Members of Congress, or administration officials, trying to achieve their policy goals that do not have any fundraiser-related obligations. Q Street hopes to provide a great space for our members to network with one another and unite their social and professional experiences in the district.”\n\nWe are all aware what is at stake in the upcoming presidential election in what can only sadly be described as a deeply divided nation. What role will LGBTQ lobbyists play, I asked Brad Howard.\n\n“If you vote third party, if you leave the race blank, or if you stay home, you are helping to elect Donald Trump,” he said. “You are not punishing Joe Biden, you are punishing the millions of Americans, the millions of aspiring Americans who face deportation, millions of women who depend on access to reproductive health, and so many transgender young people who need protection – all of these people will be punished in a Trump presidency. And, Joe Biden is going to need a Democratic Congress – or we’ll need a Democratic Congress to stop Donald Trump. So to me, the most pro-LGBTQ+ thing you can do this election is to vote Democrat…because the choices have never been clearer.”\n\nVisit Corcoran Street Group and Q Street to learn more about their work.\n\nTwo buildings, one romance, and 25 years later, the Purple Parrot is busy as ever.\n\nIf the tropical purple paint covering the outside with rainbow flags and walls covered with love notes, affirmations, and drunk wishes scribbled on dollar bills don’t indicate it already, the Purple Parrot is an institution in Rehoboth. The gay-owned and operated fixture is celebrating its 25th anniversary this year.\n\nThe Blade sat down with owners Hugh Fuller and Troy Roberts of the Rehoboth establishment to discuss the past 25 years and plans for the future.\n\nFuller and Roberts, both gay, have been working together since before the Parrot was even an idea. Fuller was a co-owner of the Iguana, another restaurant and bar in the town.\n\n“I was in the Iguana first with another business partner,” Fuller said. “I was going to get out and move up to Pennsylvania with him [Roberts]. He decided that he was going to come down and said, ‘Well, what if I go in with you at the Iguana and we do it together?’ And I was like, ‘Alright,’ so we did, and it just snowballed from there. We were always in the restaurant business together from the beginning.”\n\n“Yeah, that was really luck, too,” Roberts began. “Because-”\n\n“Because Grindr wasn’t around then!” Fuller interjected, laughing as Roberts began to roll his eyes and smile.\n\n“I had a small place up in York,” Roberts continued. “Selling that kind of gave us some money to buy the other guy out. We just had friends supporting us and helping us along the way and it just kind of worked.”\n\n“Kind of worked” would be an understatement. The pair moved on from the Iguana and opened the Parrot. Then, after opening the Parrot, they decided to shift locations to a larger location down the street to accommodate the growing demand. Then in 2010, the Parrot expanded again, adding the land behind the Rehoboth Avenue location, which provided an additional 950 square feet as well as giving patrons access to Wilmington Avenue.\n\nThe bar and restaurant, which serves American cuisine with a beach flair, has always focused on being a welcoming space to all regardless of sexuality, gender, race, nationality, or identity. This, the duo explains, is one of the reasons why the restaurant has had such a lasting impact on the Rehoboth restaurant and gay communities.\n\n“Back in the ‘90s when we first opened up, the amount of straight crossdressers that would come were like, ‘Oh, are we allowed to come in? Are we welcomed into a place like that?’ And we were like ‘Everybody that walks on this planet is welcome here!’” Fuller said. “Those are the kinds of things, you know, where people just felt comfortable. They would get stared at out on the street, but inside they would walk around and feel like they were in their own skin. It was just really cool to see.”\n\nThe feeling of acceptance has been a crucial part of the Parrot’s success.\n\n“I got an email a couple of days ago — probably two weeks ago about a woman bringing her daughter down,” Roberts said. “She’s 16 and was bullied through school — hard times, depression, tried to harm herself a couple of times. It was just really sweet that she reached out and she’s like, ‘My daughter was a completely different person when I brought her into your bar. Everybody treated her nice — the bartenders, the waitstaff, I mean, everybody was friendly. She just doesn’t experience that often being an out 16-year-old lesbian. We just can’t even thank you enough.’ It’s those kinds of things that we get often.”\n\n“[The mother] mainly wrote it because we put the Pride flag on the Parrot’s Facebook wall,” Fuller added.\n\nThe colorful lights, disco balls, and staggering number of dollar bills stapled to the walls highlight that the Rehoboth community has embraced the Parrot. It’s not uncommon to see a group of gay patrons sitting at the bar in bathing suits sipping on orange crushes and talking about their day at Poodle Beach while a bachelorette party belts out Lady Gaga on karaoke night in the room next door. That is the vibe Fuller and Roberts have curated — a fun and friendly tropical oasis in the middle of Rehoboth Avenue.\n\nA crucial element of this curated vibe, the pair point out, is treating employees and guests with respect. When asked what they have learned that helped them be so successful over the past 25 years, Fuller and Roberts said the same thing.\n\n“Patience, organization, and treating people well,” Roberts said.” I think that’s probably one of the bigger of the three — you treat them well and they treat you well. I think it’s just a mutual respect.”\n\n“It took me about 30 years to learn that it’s not just all about work,” Fuller said. “I used to bust my butt in there all the time and the focus was [on] the restaurant. I know [Roberts] said patience, I would say mine was being patient too because I learned going in that it’s easier to deal with your employees without shouting at them. It took me a little while to get through that.”\n\nHe added that compensating staff fairly was also one of their keys to success.\n\n“Before we take a nickel out of our business, we put $1 back into our employees’ pockets,” Fuller said. We want the business to survive and it has been incredible.”\n\nFuller added that this sentiment, of having patience and treating everyone with respect, goes both ways — it applies to the Parrot’s patrons as well.\n\n“If you leave the Parrot angry, it’s your own decision,” Fuller explained. “If we don’t make you happy there, it’s because you’re choosing not to be happy. We will go out of our way to correct anything and everything that we can. So if you leave [unhappy], it’s not because we couldn’t do it. It’s because you didn’t want us to.”\n\nThe two discussed their history together — anyone who has them interact can see their spirited energy and appreciation for each other.\n\n“Troy and I used to be a couple when we first opened, and we were together for about 10 years,” Fuller said. “And then we kind of went our separate ways, but the restaurant kept us in very close contact. Sometimes I think we’re probably closer than most couples are because of the way that the restaurant has us tied together.”\n\n“Even during the worst of it, we never stopped communicating on a daily basis,” Roberts added. “Obviously, you can tell by his personality why that all went south,” he said laughing.\n\n“Well, you can tell by the way that he looks why it went south.” Fuller jabbed back, also laughing.\n\n“Hey!” Roberts replied.\n\n“I wasn’t gonna continue dating my grandfather!” Fuller joked.\n\nDespite the end of their romantic relationship, there was still clear evidence of perpetual good energy between the business partners. The two then started to reminisce about the past 25 years and the struggles and successes they overcame to reach this milestone.\n\nThe pair mentioned the two biggest struggles they have faced in the past quarter century. One was when Rehoboth Avenue was dug up for the Streetscape improvement project, and the second was the 2008 recession.\n\n“We were refinancing our houses several times to keep it afloat there for a little while,” Fuller said.\n\n“But hey, we got nice sidewalks now!” Roberts added. “So that’s good.”\n\nIt’s not just the customers who grew up with the Parrot; so did the staff.\n\n“I mean one of the kids who bussed for us is now our dentist,” Fuller said.\n\n“One of the busboys from the Iguana days, he’s our dentist now,” Roberts explained. “They actually started dating in high school while working together at the Iguana. One of them followed us to the Parrot and her daughter just worked for us two summers ago as a host. He’s our dentist, and they’re still local. We just sold him a house over in Lewes, because we’re both Realtors on the side. When you look back at that, you’re like, ‘Oh, my God, you were just a kid. And now you have a kid graduating college!’ It goes fast.”\n\nIt seems that many of the staff have a soft spot for the Parrot, and for good reason. An important aspect of keeping their employees happy is supporting them. At first, it was trips to Disney World with some of the servers and renting out the local waterpark to give kids time to enjoy the summer. Then it became Christmas bonuses, which are not common in the food service industry.\n\nThe Parrot helped raise more than $10,000 for one of their employees dealing with fallout from the war in Ukraine.\n\n“One of our bartenders being from Ukraine, when all that went down, amazingly, how he was able to bring a lot of his family over,” Roberts said. “And until they actually got grounded, he had places for them to stay all lined up.”\n\n“The reason that he was able to get them over is because we did a fundraiser at the restaurant and our customers raised over $10,000 to help sponsor his family and one of our other employees’ families,” Fuller said. “They brought them all the way up through Mexico and into the country and now they’re here with citizenship cards and working for us. We got them houses and apartments too.”\n\n“We don’t care what they are, whether they’re straight, Black, Chinese, Mexican. It’s like the Benetton of Rehoboth in here,” Fuller added. “It’s the United Nations. We support everybody and we’re not afraid to show our support for everybody.”\n\nIn addition to reminiscing about some of the good things the restaurant has done for its employees, they both talked about notable guests of the Parrot.\n\n“My mind went right to the guys from Manhattan, who would always come down,” Roberts said when asked if any guests have stuck out to him over the past 25 years. “They just happened to find us. They had never been to Rehoboth before. They walked into the original Parrot and had every single year after that until two of them passed away. It just became like a yearly week, then it turned into two weeks, and then it turned into two times a year. And it was all just because they came to one bar, and had so much fun. They would sit there all day, all night, go home take a nap, and come back for dinner. And it was just their place.”\n\nThey have faced some objections from those who were not as receptive to their tolerance of different people.\n\n“We get the same hate that everybody else does — the same hate that the city got when they put the rainbow crossings in and the flag up,” Fuller said. “I was just telling Troy about a conversation I had yesterday with a guy. The front of our business for Pride month has flags on it and says ‘Happy Pride.’ And he said, ‘I was going to come in here but I see you’re supporting the gay community with your rainbow flags.’ And I said ‘Yes.’ And he goes, ‘Well, I don’t see why you don’t have flags for veterans.’ And I said,’ Well, as a veteran, I can tell you that we don’t serve to be recognized, we serve to protect and to give you guys your freedom. It’s not something that we want recognition for. But there is a flag, the American flag, that flies over the top of our business every day to represent the veterans of this country.’”\n\nDespite the opinions of some who are less than welcoming of the LGBTQ community, the Purple Parrot will always be a safe space to celebrate, the two affirmed. And celebrate they will.\n\nThe Parrot already hosted one party to celebrate the milestone of the bar early in the summer, but will throw an even bigger bash at the end of the season to commemorate the history and hard work that has gone into making the Parrot ‘fly.’\n\n“On May fifth we had a big party,” Fuller said. “We’ll have another one at the end of the summer in September. We did one at the beginning and then we’re going to do a really big one at the end of the summer. The first celebration, that weekend, turned out to be a little rainy, and misty so it wasn’t as big as it could have been. It was packed inside but it wasn’t packed outside like it normally is. We usually do a full cookout barbecue, all that stuff and we’ll do that again at the end of the summer. We’ll have another one of those with DJs. I am not sure about a drag show, but we’ll probably have something because the girls are trying to get something together. We don’t want to spoil anything but there will be a surprise.”\n\nWhen asked to give their final thoughts on owning and running one of Rehoboth’s most successful businesses as gay men, the two made it clear that it has to be a safe and welcoming space for all for it to succeed.\n\n“I think you have to be all-inclusive,” Roberts said. “I don’t think in today’s world you can just really limit it to the gay community. You have to be gay-friendly, and accepting as well. And I think that helps because it gets non-gays in there and everybody just starts to get along. It becomes more accepted and then becomes the norm.”\n\nFuller agreed but emphasized being true to one’s character in collaboration with being inclusive is the key to their success.\n\n“Being gay isn’t who we are, you know, it’s what we are,” Fuller said. “You can’t be afraid to be you. … If you’re going to open up a business, you want to make sure you lean on the community, because the community is going to be your biggest support. And that’s how we definitely lean on the gay community.”\n\nThe Purple Parrot is located at 134 Rehoboth Ave. in Rehoboth Beach and is open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. and is open from 9 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Sundays.

The goal of the job is to inform the public with no bias, but this is difficult, if not impossible, to do in practice. Everything from your upbringing to the books you read can impact how you view and cover the world. But sometimes these factors can help shine a light on an underrepresented community or issue.\n\nTwo broadcast journalists in Salisbury, Md., are using the subtle, yet impactful choice of sharing their queer identities to strengthen their reporting and connection to the community.\n\nHannah Cechini, who is non-binary, and Rob Petree, who is gay, co-host the 5:30-6:30 p.m. newscast for WMDT 47. They are the only known anchor team that are not only both queer, but also open out about their identities on air and, as Petree put it, “always use [their] platform and power that [we] have to fight for what’s right.”\n\nCechini’s passion for journalism played an important role in the discovery of their gender identity. They knew they were meant to be in the newsroom before they figured out they were non-binary.\n\n“I was doing this job before I started to identify as non-binary,” Cechini told the Blade. “I’d always watch the evening news with my dad growing up and thought it was the coolest thing. And throughout high school, I worked on the school paper.”\n\nAfter graduating from Suffolk University in Boston, Cechini’s passion for journalism only grew as they began to work in the world of news media, eventually ending up in Salisbury. As they honed their writing, editing, and anchoring skills at WMDT, Cechini also started to take an introspective look into their gender identity.\n\nA little more than two years ago Cechini came out as non-binary to their coworkers in the newsroom and was met with support all around. “It was definitely smoother than I anticipated,” they said.\n\n“It is very freeing to be able to do this job as a non-binary person because I haven’t really seen much of that representation myself.”\n\nPetree, on the other hand, knew he was gay right around the same time he became interested in news media, at age 14. He started working for his high school news show and used it as a way to be open about his sexuality rather than hide it.\n\n“I broke into broadcasting doing the morning announcements,” he said. “I did the weather and started doing a segment called issues and insights,” Petree said, explaining his introduction to the news. Eventually, students would ask him questions about his sexuality after seeing him on the school TV. “It had gotten to the point in school, that if you’re going to come up and ask me if I’m gay, well shit, I’m going to tell you!”\n\nTo him, this was the exact reason he had come out. Petree wanted to motivate others to live honestly.\n\n“There are a lot of people who will spend most of their lives not being out so if they can see someone like me, who’s out and proud doing his thing, so to speak, then maybe that’s the inspiration for them,” Petree said. “To search their own soul, find out who they are, and live their full life.”\n\nPetree explained that he got his start in a space that was not always welcoming to his queerness. This tested the delicate balance between being a journalist and holding your identity close.\n\n“I’ve always been out and it was a challenge because I got my start in conservative talk radio,” Petree said. “I’m going to be honest, some of the things I heard from people I’ve worked with, from the callers to the radio stations were absolutely abhorrent. But I never let it discourage me. It made me work that much harder.”\n\nCechini highlighted the same sentiment when explaining why it’s important to have out LGBTQ figures in news media. They want to show everyone that it is possible to be openly queer and successful.\n\n“I just think that representation matters because if ‘Joe,’ who’s never seen a transgender person before, sees a transgender person or a non-binary person, doing a job that they’ve only ever seen straight cis people doing before, it kind of creates that understanding or bridges that gap,” Cechini said. “It’s like, ‘OK, maybe they’re not that different from me.’ And that facilitates being able to connect among different communities.”\n\nBoth Cechini and Petree agree that having a queer coworker has made their bond stronger.\n\n“It’s great to have someone else next to me who I can relate to and work alongside,” Petree said. “And they’re a joy to work with, they really are. There is a tremendous amount of things that we relate to together — like we both share and have the same affinity for Lady Gaga,” he said laughing. “Although they’re more of a Lady Gaga fan than I am.”\n\n“Hannah is a tremendous journalist who really goes out of their way to make sure that the stories that they do are on point 100% of the time,” he added. “They’ve been great to work with and to learn from and to grow alongside. I’m very happy to have them as my co-anchor.”\n\nCechini explained that the relationship between two co-anchors can make or break a newscast, and having Petree as their partner on air is a major part of the show’s success.\n\n“Co-anchoring is not just the relationship that you have on camera,” Cechini said. “It’s really, really important to have a good relationship with your co-anchor off-camera as well because you have to have a level of trust between you.”\n\nCechini continued, saying that this relationship is crucial to working together, especially when things don’t go as planned.\n\n“Not everything always goes to script,” they said. “Sometimes you have to be able to work together without even really talking to each other and just kind of know what to do. When you have a relationship like that with someone who identifies similarly to you or has had similar life experience, I think that just only strengthens that [relationship].”\n\nAlthough they have had similar experiences being from the LGBTQ community, Petree said it was a change for him to use “they/them” pronouns on air.\n\n“Prior to working with Hannah, I’ve never worked with a non-binary individual who went by the pronouns ‘they/them,’” Petree said. “It was new for me to not use traditional pronouns on air, but I can say that I have never misgendered them on air and never will. You get conditioned to using traditional pronouns and it’s easy to make that mistake, but I never have.”\n\nAt the end of the day, they both explained, it is about doing the job right. For the duo, a part of that is understanding the diversity of people and issues in the community.\n\n“When you come from a more marginalized community, I think that kind of helps to inform you a little better as a journalist because you have a better understanding of what it’s like to be ‘the other guy,’” Cechini said.\n\n“Our talent and our drive for journalism speaks for itself,” Petree said. “And that resonates with people. Have we shown ourselves to be an inspiration to the LGBTQ+ community here in Delmarva? Yes, we have. And that’s something that I’m proud of.”\n\nThe primetime nightly newscast with Hannah Cechini and Rob Petree airs weeknights from 5:30-6:30 p.m. on ABC affiliate WMDT 47."
