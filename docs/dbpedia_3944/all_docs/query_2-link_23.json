        "text": "In the early hours of June 28, 1969, the New York Police Department unwittingly helped start the modern LGBTQ+ rights movement. At the time, clubs with gay or lesbian patrons weren’t allowed to serve alcohol, but the Stonewall Inn still served booze to their customers, which gave police cause to raid the bar. The clientele pushed back, and 13 people were arrested. LGBTQ+ people and their allies protested for days. Among the crowd was transgender activist Marsha P. Johnson, who later founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), an organization that provided resources for LGBTQ+ youth and sex workers.\n\nAfter the events at Stonewall—which the NYPD eventually apologized for in 2019—more and more people pushed for LGBTQ+ equality. Activists organized the first LGBTQ+ marches in the United States and worldwide, giving rise to annual Pride parades. In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association no longer considered being gay or lesbian a mental illness, and the first openly lesbian politicians were elected in the following year. Currently, openly gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer candidates occupy political offices at most levels of government, including in the U.S. House of Representatives, Senate, and state governorships.\n\nThere is still more to be done, but since Stonewall, the government has passed laws banning discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the Supreme Court declared same-sex marriage legal. More than two dozen countries have passed legislation giving marriage rights to everyone.\n\nIn the military, it took decades for gay, lesbian, and bisexual service members to win the right to enlist. And it wasn’t until 2011 that LGBTQ+ troops could openly serve in the United States armed forces. While the Obama administration repealed the ban on transgender troops in 2016, former President Donald Trump effectively reinstated it in 2019 (though the ban was overturned by the Biden administration in 2021).\n\nTo find out more about LGBTQ+ history, Stacker combed through news reports and used data from GLSEN to compile over 50 years of LGBTQ+ progress. Read on to see the evolution of this movement, from then to now.\n\nYou may also like: Looking back at 50 years of pride festivals\n\nDrew Angerer // Getty Images\n\n1969: Stonewall Riots\n\nAnger erupted after New York City police arrested 13 people during a raid at the Stonewall Inn, a bar and safe space for the LGBTQ+ community. Advocates protested for days, even though police took action—even turning fire hoses onto the crowd. Many say the event catalyzed the modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement.\n\nEvening Standard // Getty Images\n\n1969: Gay Liberation Front forms\n\nThe events of Stonewall led to the creation of the GLF, a group that organized the Christopher Street Liberation Day in New York in 1970—now considered the first Pride parade. It started with only a few hundred people, but by the time the group reached Central Park, thousands were marching for LGBTQ+ equality.\n\nrbkomar // Shutterstock\n\n1972: Sweden allows people to legally change gender\n\nIn 1972, Sweden became the first country to give people the right to legally change their gender on identifying documents. However, people needed to be over 18 years old, unmarried, and sterilized; the country didn’t remove the mandatory sterilization law until 2013. In some U.S. states, people still need to undergo gender-reassignment surgery to legally change their gender.\n\nLSE Library // Flickr\n\n1972: UK has first Pride parade\n\nThe United Kingdom held the country’s first LGBTQ+ Pride parade on July 1, 1972. Britain’s GLF organized the event, and about 700 people showed up to march. Their slogan was simple: “Gay is good.”\n\nLEE SNIDER PHOTO IMAGES // Shutterstock\n\n1973: Lambda Legal forms\n\nThe Lambda Legal organization was formed to offer legal support for LGBTQ+ equality, but first, they had to represent themselves to fight for the right to exist in New York. In the ’70s, the group fought for LGBTQ+ rights on the college and national levels. In 1983, they were successful in the first HIV/AIDS discrimination case in the U.S.\n\nYou may also like: How top Democratic candidates compare on major issues\n\nUS Department of Labor // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1973: Homosexuality is no longer classified as a mental illness\n\nUntil the early ’70s, physicians could diagnose someone in a same-sex relationship as mentally ill. But in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association removed “homosexuality” from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or the DSM-II).\n\nJiaqian AirplaneFan // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1974: First openly lesbian officials elected\n\nKathy Kozachenko and Elaine Noble became the nation’s first openly lesbian or gay elected officials in 1974. Kozachenko won a seat on the Ann Arbor City Council in Michigan, while Noble held a position in the Massachusetts General Assembly.\n\nJIM WATSON/AFP // Getty Images\n\n1977: First openly gay man elected\n\nHarvey Milk made history when he won a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, becoming the first openly gay male politician elected in a major city. Before he was assassinated a year later, Milk helped pass city ordinances to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nSpencer Platt // Getty Images\n\n1978: The rainbow flag is created\n\nIn 1978, Harvey Milk’s friend Gilbert Baker brought his 30-by-60-foot rainbow flag to an LGBTQ+ rights rally in San Francisco. Afterward, it became an enduring symbol of pride for the LGBTQ+ community. According to The Washington Post, Baker sometimes referred to himself as “the Betsy Ross of gay liberation.” He died in 2017 at the age of 65.\n\nTony Webster // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1979: First national LGBTQ+ march\n\nThousands of people marched for equality in the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights. They gathered together to end discrimination based on sexual orientation, including within the federal government.\n\nYou may also like: 50 ways the news industry has changed in the last 50 years\n\nAndrzej Wójtowicz // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1981: Norway enacts anti-discrimination laws\n\nIn 1981, Norway amended its laws to include protections for LGBTQ+ people. The legislation stated that business owners couldn’t discriminate against customers based on sexual orientation nor deny them access to public events. Hate speech was also prohibited.\n\nfelipe caparros // Shutterstock\n\n1981: Gay men affected with ‘rare cancer’\n\nIn 1981, the New York Times reported 41 gay men had been afflicted with a “rare cancer.” Doctors originally thought HIV/AIDS was a skin cancer known as Kaposi’s sarcoma. A year later, though, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) started calling the illness “acquired immune deficiency syndrome,” or AIDS.\n\nPixabay\n\n1982: Wisconsin passes LGBTQ+ anti-discrimination law\n\nIn 1981, Rep. David Clarenbach (D-Wis.) brought forth a measure to protect LGBTQ+ people from employment discrimination in public and private sectors, making Wisconsin the first in the U.S. to pass a statewide law against such discrimination. The law also banned landlords from denying housing based on sexual orientation.\n\nAlisonW // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1983: BiPOL forms\n\nBiPOL, the first bisexual political group, started in San Francisco in 1983. They helped put on the Bisexual Rights Rally a year later, which took place outside the Democratic National Convention.\n\nMICHEL CLEMENT/AFP // Getty Images\n\n1984: HIV discovered\n\nAfter ruling out cancer, researchers in France and the United States discovered that a retrovirus caused AIDS. Scientists hoped a vaccine would be available by the late ’80s, but it wasn’t until 2012 that the FDA approved PrEP, the first drug to help prevent the transmission of HIV. In 2019, two men were “cured” of AIDS after blood stem cell transplants. More than 35 million people have died of AIDS or related illnesses.\n\nYou may also like: A timeline of WWII, the most devastating conflict in history\n\nPixabay\n\n1986: Bowers v. Hardwick\n\nAfter Michael Hardwick failed to show up for a court summons for public drinking, a police officer went to his house. That’s when he and a male friend were arrested for having consensual sex, which was illegal between two people of the same gender. The case, Bowers v. Hardwick, went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the state. The Court didn’t strike down sodomy laws until 2003.\n\nWangkun Jia // Shutterstock\n\n1986: New York passes anti-discrimination bill\n\nAfter more than a decade of debate, New York City passed an anti-discrimination bill in 1986: Sexual orientation couldn’t be the basis of discrimination in employment, housing, or public accommodations.\n\nRick // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1987: UK opens first HIV/AIDS clinic\n\nThe HIV/AIDS crisis continued into the late ’80s. In 1987, Princess Diana dispelled the myth that the disease could be transmitted by touch: without gloves, she shook the hand of an infected man at the opening of the United Kingdom’s first HIV/AIDS unit at the London Middlesex Hospital.\n\nTasos Katopodis // Getty Images\n\n1987: Barney Frank comes out as gay\n\nAlthough his straight allies and colleagues cautioned him against it, U.S. Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) revealed his sexual orientation in 1987, making him the second openly gay congressman. Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.) reluctantly came out in 1983. Frank announced his retirement in 2011.\n\nElvert Barnes // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1987: ACT UP\n\nThe AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) helped change the way people thought about the disease. Their slogan was simple but effective: “Silence = death.” Many say that the group jump-started a movement that led to the creation of HIV/AIDS drugs.\n\nYou may also like: Defining historical moments from the year you were born\n\nElvert Barnes // Wikimedia Commons\n\n1988: National Coming Out Day starts\n\nA year after the second March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights, a group of activists founded National Coming Out Day (October 11), which aims to help LGBTQ+ people live openly.\n\nKELD NAVNTOFT/AFP // Getty Images\n\n1989: Denmark legalizes same-sex unions\n\nDemark recognized same-sex domestic partnerships in 1989, which extended the rights of marriage to gay and lesbians couples.

The administration didn’t want to allow her LGBTQ+ group but the Equal Access Act meant the school couldn’t legally prevent them from meeting. Instead, Salt Lake City’s Board of Education banned all high school clubs. Students sued the school, and a federal judge ruled in their favor.\n\nSAUL LOEB/AFP // Getty Images\n\n1997: Ellen DeGeneres comes out\n\nEllen DeGeneres told the world she was a lesbian on the cover of Time magazine.

Before the ban in 2017, it was estimated 2,450 service members were transgender, with about 0.1% of the total force seeking gender-related treatments. The Trump administration deemed gender-affirming care too expensive for the military to budget when in actuality it would only increase military spending by 0.04% to 0.13%.\n\nAlina Kruk // Shutterstock\n\n2021: Gender-affirming care for minors is blocked—then overturned\n\nA law passed in Arkansas banned physicians in the state from providing gender-affirming health care to minors—even with parental consent. Trans children in the state were immediately unable to access trans-related health care, health care which has been proven to lower the risk of suicide among transgender youth. In July 2021, following a court case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) spurred by protests and activists, the bill was overturned and gender-affirming care was once again accessible for minors.\n\nAcross the pond, in December 2020, the U.K.’s High Court ruled transgender children under the age of 16 could not consent to receive trans-affirming health care. Trans youth seeking medical treatment needed to consult a judge before receiving care. The National Health Service (NHS) appealed the decision and won in September 2021. Roughly 2,400 children a year in the U.K. seek gender-affirming health care through the NHS, making this overturned case paramount for a significant number of minors.\n\nFABRICE COFFRINIAFP // Getty Images\n\n2021: Switzerland and Japan make strides toward marriage equality\n\nIn September 2021, a two-thirds majority in Switzerland voted to legalize gay marriage in a referendum vote. This referendum also extended family rights for same-gender couples, allowing them to adopt children and permitting couples of two women to have children through sperm donation. The new ruling will be enforced in July 2022. Switzerland is one of the last Western European countries to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\nIn Japan, the country inched closer to marriage equality in a ruling which claimed to bar same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. Gay marriage is not yet legal in Japan, but this ruling will likely set a precedent for future legislation.\n\nIrfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\n2022: Hundreds of anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in US states\n\nAs of May 2022, over 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced in 36 states across the U.S. in 2022, some of which have become law in eight states. In Florida, one such measure—dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill by critics—prohibits elementary school teachers from educating students in grades K-3 about sexual orientation or gender identity. Another law in Alabama that criminalizes gender-affirming medical care for trans youth was partially blocked by a judge in May. A significant number of these bills specifically target transgender people.\n\nGetty Images\n\n2022: First openly lesbian women elected governor\n\nThe U.S. has never had an openly lesbian woman hold the office of governor; however, during the November 2022 midterms, not one but two openly lesbian women won gubernatorial elections in their respective states.\n\nMaura Healey of Massachusetts is both the first woman as well as the first openly lesbian woman to be elected governor in Massachusetts.
