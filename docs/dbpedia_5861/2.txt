Officials of the Kentucky Derby Museum at Churchill Downs say they’d be honored if Barbaro were buried in a garden along with four other Derby winners.

The horse’s final resting place could be just a few hundred yards from the scene of his greatest triumph in the Kentucky Derby.

The grave sites of 1983 winner Sunny’s Halo, 1961 Derby champion Carry Back, 1955 winner Swaps and 1933 champion Brokers Tip are on the museum grounds.

Barbaro owners Gretchen and Roy Jackson said Monday that a final decision on where Barbaro would be buried had not been made
