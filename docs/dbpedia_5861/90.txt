Situated in front of the Kentucky Derby Museum is a 1,500-pound sculpture of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro with his ashes buried beneath it. The memorial is an attraction for those who visit Churchill Downs, with many people taking pictures next to Barbaro's statue.

The museum grounds is also the final resting place for five other Derby winning horses. Kentucky is home to many of the Derby's deceased champions: 28 in total, including eight Triple Crown winners. And you can visit many of them.

Here is where every winner is buried:

Kentucky Derby Museum

Barbaro: After winning the Kentucky Derby by 6 ½ lengths in 2006, he shattered his leg at the Preakness and died about seven months later from complications with laminitis.

Brokers Tip: His only career win was the 1933 Kentucky Derby in what is famously referred to as the “Fighting Finish Derby” due to the actions of his jockey, Don Meade, and Head Play’s jockey, Herb Fisher, that caused both to receive 30-day suspensions. He was donated to the University of California-Davis and died there in 1953, but his remains rest at Churchill Downs.

Carry Back: He won the 1961 Kentucky Derby, was a Belmont Stakes win away from the Triple Crown and was named that year's Champion Three-Year-Old. He died in 1983.

Dust Commander: He won the 1970 Derby and went on to win eight races in 42 starts. He later sired 1975 Preakness winner Master Derby and died in 1991. Dust Commander's remains were lost for a time before his skeleton was found in Paris, Kentucky, and shipped to Churchill Downs in 2013.

Sunny’s Halo: He was the second Canadian-born horse to win the Kentucky Derby, accomplishing the feat in 1983, and the first to total more than $1 million during his 3-year-old season. Inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 1986, Sunny’s Halo sired 36 stakes winners and was euthanized in 2003 after he was unable to stand up.

Swaps: The 1955 Kentucky Derby winner was named the United States Horse of the Year in 1956. The California-bred horse won 19 races in 25 starts and died in 1972.
