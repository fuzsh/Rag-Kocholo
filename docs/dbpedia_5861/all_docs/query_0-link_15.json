        "text": "KENNETT SQUARE, Pa. â€” Barbaro's final resting place could be just a few hundred yards from the scene of his greatest triumph, in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nOfficials at the Kentucky Derby Museum, located on the grounds of Churchill Downs, said Tuesday they'd be \"honored\" if Barbaro were buried in a garden along with four other Derby winners.\n\n\"We've expressed to them how honored we'd be to have Barbaro here,\" Lynn Ashton, executive director of the museum, said. \"We feel like we're bringing horses back to be honored.\"\n\nThe grave sites of Derby winners Sunny's Halo (1983), Carry Back (1961), Swaps (1955) and Brokers Tip (1933) are located outside on the museum grounds.\n\nOwners Gretchen and Roy Jackson said Monday a final decision on where Barbaro would be buried had not been made. Other possibilities include the Kentucky Horse Farm in Lexington, Ky., and the Jacksons' Lael Farm, just a few miles away from the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center.\n\nThe Jacksons did not immediately return phone calls Tuesday morning.\n\nBarbaro was euthanized Monday after complications from his gruesome breakdown at last year's Preakness, ending an eight-month ordeal."
