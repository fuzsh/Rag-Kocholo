        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. – The Super Bowl of horse racing, the Kentucky Derby, is the longest continuously held sporting event in the United States. It was first run in 1875, and it truly is a spectacle to behold. More than a week removed from the festivities, I’ve had time to reflect on this year’s experience.\n\nSome things I learned since last year.\n\n1. Pack heavy. Before you leave for Louisville, check the weather report. If there is even a hint of rain in the forecast, be prepared to accessorize your Saturday best with ponchos, rain boots, waterproof pants, and so on. Before the race even started, there were plenty of women in sundresses, with bare feet and covered from head to toe with rainwater and mud. The sight left some to wonder, “Didn’t they know it was supposed to rain?” Some fans scrambled for cover to protect their pricey Derby hats, while some used plastic bags (and many still kept them on their heads afterward). It wasn’t the best-looking audience at Churchill Downs on the first Saturday in May, but after Orb thundered down the homestretch to secure an elusive victory for his trainer and his owners, it was a captivated one nonetheless.\n\n2. Visit the backside. The excitement on the backside during Derby week is something that is hard to put into words; it’s best to see it and feel it for yourself. Every trainer, every owner, every exercise rider, every bettor still has hope, and every horse, all major players in the prep races, still has a certain swagger. Although if you watch and listen closely, some have more than others. In what other sport can you get so close to the athletes that you can see them sweat, breathe, push, excel, cool down? Of course, with security heightened, getting on the backside is not easy. For those who aren’t owners, trainers, news media, employees or friends of the aforementioned, there is Dawn at the Downs, which for $35, is the best value at Churchill Downs all week. Visitors can enjoy breakfast in Millionaires Row while watching the workouts and listening to a host provide insight. For those looking for an even more casual experience, workouts can be viewed from the rail and sections 116-117 for free.\n\n3. Splurge on a hotel. Finding a hotel room during Derby week is no easy feat, and no matter where you stay, expect to pay premium prices. But if you’re already breaking out the wallet, why not spend a little more to stay close to the activity? Hotels on Crittenden Drive and Phillips Lane are within walking distance to the track, and when traffic draws to a standstill later in the week, you’re going to appreciate that. Many hotels have shuttles, and buses are available from Louisville’s Papa John’s Stadium. Downtown is not far away, and a few historic hotels, the Brown Hotel and the Galt House, offer a premium experience. This is not these hotels’ first horse race, either. They know how to do it right: vanloads of roses grace the lobbies, along with hat and souvenir vendors, bluegrass bands, julep makers, you name it. Spotting owners and trainers is any easy task — they are right there soaking it all in, too. And when you check out, you get an application for the opportunity to do it all over again next year. (See next item.)\n\n4. Book early, then arrive early. For as expensive as hotels can be, it’s possible to get decent rates earlier in the week, so why not come a few days earlier? There are so many events going on around Louisville — races, galas, horse appearances, farm tours, food tastings, movie premieres, etc. — that it is best to take a few extra days to fit in as many activities as you can. And don’t forget to buy your tickets to the race early. They sell fast and go for about double the face value on resale sites. For those on a budget, $25 buys you a general admission ticket for Oaks day; $40 gets you in for the Derby. But if you’re already splurging, might as well try to get seats, maybe even ones under cover. This year’s Derby was the perfect example of how priceless those can be.\n\n5. Party hard. There are so many galas during Derby week, it’s hard to settle on just one, though with the prices of many of these events for charity, you might have to. Still they are as big a part of the Derby tradition as roses, hats and mint juleps. A few of the best are the Taste of the Derby on Thursday, which is a foodie’s dream as racetracks from all over the country and Canada are represented by top chefs from that area. In fact, many contestants from the show “Top Chef” are on hand. After the crowd is sated, a high-energy band — this year it was the seven-piece Memphis Soul Revue — closes out the evening. On Friday, a more traditional Southern gala can be found in Unbridled Eve at the Galt House. A red carpet, cocktail hour, formal dinner, two auctions and entertainment from country singers make this a popular event. From there, you can head to the grandaddy of all Derby parties, the Barnstable Brown Gala, founded by the Wrigley’s Doublemint twins Patricia Barnstable Brown and Priscilla Barnstable. Celebrities flock to Barnstable Brown’s Highlands neighborhood mansion, but good luck getting through those iron gates. Chances are you’ll be stuck with the gawkers on the street, taking in the high-priced, high-energy, high-spectacle affair from afar. Unquestionably the after-hours destination of the moment is the Maxim & Maker’s 46 Fillies and Stallions party, where stars and other guests can take pictures with Maxim models and whip-toting dancers dressed as jockeys. This year, the V.I.P. area was bursting at the seams with sports stars like Shaquille O’Neal, Scottie Pippen, Aaron Rodgers, Robert Griffin III and more. Just don’t stay out too late, you’ve got a big day Saturday.\n\n6. Go to horse country. Take a scenic trip on I-64 to Lexington to see the superstars of Oaks and Derbys past. The lush hills of the bluegrass, dotted with wooden and limestone fences, are a sight to behold, topped only by the majestic creatures that inhabit them. Farms where past racing champions like Big Brown and Zenyatta hold new jobs as stallions and broodmares usually hold open houses throughout the week. For horse lovers, being able to see these incredible athletes and their offspring up close is hard to top.\n\n7. Sip some bourbon. While you’re there, hit the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. Woodford Reserve, Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark are the unquestionable kings of the trail, but smaller distilleries like Four Roses offer exceptional experiences as well. A tour of the Spanish-mission-style buildings at Four Roses, which is celebrating its 125th anniversary this year, produces wonders for all five senses. Afterward, enjoy a tasting of the products and peruse a shop where you can purchase gifts, and, well, bourbon. Bourbon-laced chocolates and a mix for mint juleps are popular items.\n\n8. Souvenir shop. There is perhaps no Derby souvenir as iconic as the Derby glass. With names of all previous winners of the Run for the Roses, these glasses, which come with a mint julep for the price of $11, are both an item to cherish and jog your memory. Oaks day has its own drink, the Lily, which also comes in a souvenir glass. However, the more drinks consumed, the more the chances of dropping those glasses increase. Throughout the Churchill grounds on Friday and Saturday, the sounds of glass shattering and people cheering afterward could be heard. It’s best to get your glass early and put it away for safe keeping. If that doesn’t happen, here’s a secret: a trailer pulls up in front of the Kentucky Derby Museum early Sunday and sells leftover merchandise at a discount. Be prepared to wait in line, though."
