The popular Derby nickname “Run for the Roses,” coined by sports columnist Bill Corum in 1925, is reflected in the blanket of red roses draped over the victorious horse after the race, a tradition that dates to at least 1932. The tradition of playing Stephen Foster’s “My Old Kentucky Home” as the horses enter the track also dates to the 1930s.\n\nMarvin Drager Jamie Nicholson"
