        "text": "The Kentucky Derby may be famously known as the fastest two minutes in sports, but this iconic annual event in Louisville is anything but fleeting. The race itself may be the pinnacle moment, but the Kentucky Derby Festival begins two weeks before the horses line up with their jockeys on the track at Churchill Downs.\n\nWhile buying tickets to the derby will secure you a spot in the stands, it’s really the days leading up to the race that count. With so many things to do in Louisville during Derby Week, you may not even realize that the race is the highlight of the season. We’ve been traveling to the Kentucky Derby for many years and want to share all our favorite things about Louisville during the Kentucky Derby.\n\nWhat It Means to ‘Derby It Up’\n\nIn Louisville, the Kentucky Derby is more than an iconic sporting event — it’s an entire season, one that is considered by locals to be the most electric and exciting time of the year. To “Derby It Up” means that you are ready to immerse yourself in the sights and sounds of the city as it gears up for the most colorful and cosmopolitan sporting event in the United States. The race itself may be over in just a few brief moments, but the spirit of the Derby lives on throughout the entire year — and it’s never more alive than during Derby Week!\n\nGetting in the Spirit of Derby Week\n\nGetting in the Spirit with our Clients\n\nLocals and visitors alike enjoy getting into the spirit of the pomp and pageantry of Derby Week in Louisville. Before you begin building your itinerary and scoping out the best things to do in Louisville on Derby Weekend, you will want to prepare accordingly.\n\nFirst, start by shopping for your Derby outfit. The Kentucky Derby is considered by many to be more than just a horse race — it’s also a real-time fashion show, in which attendees strive to wear their brightest colors and largest, most spectacular hats. If you don’t think you will be able to pack that fabulous fascinator in your suitcase, don’t worry — you can always shop at one of the local Louisville hat shops throughout the week.\n\nLauren in her Hat at the Derby\n\nPro Tip: Don’t forget about your personal comfort during Derby week! Yes, crafting a memorable and remarkable outfit is fun, but you may also want to bring a rain poncho or a pair of flip-flops to change into — just in case!\n\nIn addition to readying your ensemble for race day, you can also spend time learning more about the culture and traditions surrounding this event. On the surface, the race that brings more than 150,000 people to Churchill Downs each year seems like a show of pageantry filled with plume-topped hats, stealthy jockeys and mint juleps, but in reality, this is an iconic event steeped in tradition and community pride.\n\n“The Kentucky Derby is just a ton of fun: getting fancy, drinking mint juleps and taking in the atmosphere around the event. I just love the tradition of picking out my hat to go with my Derby outfit! It’s a great way to start the trip: settle into downtown Louisville and start shopping for the perfect, locally designed hat or fascinator to get into the spirit of the Derby and join in on the pageantry.”\n\nLauren Lehotsky, Roadtrips Kentucky Derby Host\n\nExplore the History and Traditions of Louisville\n\nFounded in 1778, the city of Louisville sparkles with historic pride, particularly during Derby Week. When you arrive before Derby Weekend, you will find that it’s easy to add a dose of culture and history to your itinerary. We recommend that you make time to visit one or more of these attractions in the days leading up to the big race.\n\nVisit the Kentucky Derby Museum\n\nIn 2024, the Kentucky Derby will celebrate its 150th race, making this one of the most exciting times to experience all of the best things to do in Louisville during Derby Week. The Kentucky Derby Museum should be at the top of your Louisville bucket list, as this attraction provides insight into the history of this event and the impact it has had on the community at large. It is important to note that the Derby Museum is closed Thursday through Saturday of Derby week.\n\nThese are some of the must-see exhibits at the museum:\n\nInspired: Building Churchill Downs\n\nBlack Heritage in Racing\n\nInternational Horseshoeing Hall of Fame\n\nSecretariat: America’s Horse\n\nThis year, in particular, will be an exciting time to visit the museum. In honor of the sesquicentennial anniversary of the race, several new exhibits will open up in 2024, such as the Riders Up exhibit and the See & Be Seen: 150 Years of Derby Fashion exhibit. Not to mention, the museum will be selling official Derby 150 merchandise.\n\nExplore the Louisville Slugger Museum\n\nLouisville Slugger Museum\n\nThe Kentucky Derby may be the most well-known Louisville sporting event, but the city has also had a remarkable impact on the sport of baseball. It was here in Louisville that some of the strongest, most powerful baseball bats were built. At the Louisville Slugger Museum, you can embark on an interactive tour that allows you to see how the local timber is transformed into an unimaginably potent baseball bat. Plus, at the end, you can get your own mini-bat to take home, giving you an easy souvenir to remember your trip by.\n\nTour the Local Horse Farms\n\nThe horses who line up on the racetrack at the Kentucky Derby are not there by luck. These are some of the most elegant, powerful and graceful animals in their species, thanks to the efforts of refined and responsible horse farmers in the region and throughout the country. Before you head to the race itself, be sure to take some time to tour the local horse farms and learn more about the art and science of breeding, raising and training horses to become champions.\n\nSurround Yourself in that Derby Week Vibe in NuLu\n\nBourbon Tasting with our Clients\n\nNew Louisville — an entertainment district in the heart of the city’s downtown area that is affectionately referred to as NuLu by the locals — is the place to see and be seen during Derby Week. Having recently become known as one of the best gathering spots in the city, NuLu has a burgeoning arts and culture scene that is downright irresistible. Our Louisville travel experts can’t get enough of the eclectic art galleries and swanky boutiques that define the atmosphere in this vibrant corner of the city.\n\nBourbon Trail Tour\n\nWhat would a trip to Louisville be without a monumental adventure on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. We’ll arrange an expert guide to help you discover bourbon country, where you’ll learn about the popular beverage’s history and what makes it such an important part of the culture. Don’t worry, you’ll also get to enjoy tastings at two premier distilleries.\n\nBackside Stables Tour\n\nWe’ve arranged this very special tour to help our guests celebrate Derby’s 150th anniversary. This exclusive Backside Stables tour will give you an up close and personal experience with the horses of the Kentucky Derby and the Kentucky Oaks. Your knowledgeable guide will escort you as you meet jockeys and trainers and watch the ponies workout on the track. You’ll even have the opportunity to enter select stables.\n\nCheck These Must-See Louisville Attractions Off Your Bucket List\n\nAs the largest city in Kentucky, Louisville is known for its high-energy atmosphere and fun-loving dynamic — and that mood is significantly amplified in the days and weeks leading up to the Derby. When you arrive in town for this legendary sporting event, you will find that there’s no shortage of things to do in Louisville. You can easily fill up your itinerary by incorporating these top Louisville attractions into your daily schedules:\n\nVisit the Muhammad Ali Center\n\nSportsmanship has long been intertwined with greatness and justice in the city of Louisville, which is proud to be the hometown of Muhammad Ali. The Muhammad Ali Center pays homage to the legendary boxer who was committed to the cause of social justice, and it’s a must-do for anyone who is visiting for the first time.\n\nThe permanent exhibits at this dynamic museum focus on the life and impact of Muhammad Ali. Favorites among visitors include the All Ali, All the Time exhibit, in which Ali’s most famous fights play on a loop in a theater, and the Six Core Principles, an immersive exhibit that gives guests an opportunity to reflect on the principles that guided Ali throughout his life. There’s also a hands-on training center, where you can test out your own boxing skills and see if you have what it takes to become the greatest version of yourself.\n\nGlide Through the Louisville Mega Cavern\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the Louisville Mega Cavern was a massive limestone quarry — and one of the best kept secrets in the region. However, around the turn of the 21st century, the cavern became a high-security storage facility, adding to the storied tale of this man-made wonder.\n\nToday, though, this cavern is actually most famous for being the top attraction in Louisville. While geologists often hail the cavern as the safest place to be in the state, visitors often find themselves on the edge of their seats as they experience the thrills that this cavern has to offer.\n\nBefore you begin sipping Mint Juleps at Churchill Downs, you will want to be sure to embark on a zip-lining adventure in the cavern. The Mega Zip adventure is the only zip line in the world that is located entirely underground. This guided experience lasts for more than 2 hours, and takes you across six zip lines that weave through never-before-seen-sections of the cave. It is a year-round attraction that is open to participants over the age of 7, and between 55 and 285 pounds.\n\nExperience the Beauty and Grandeur of the Conrad-Caldwell House Museum\n\nConrad-Caldwell House\n\nElegance and sophistication reign supreme, particularly in Louisville throughout late April and early May. If you are looking for one of the best things to do in Louisville Derby Weekend, then the Conrad-Caldwell House Museum should be at the top of your list. This Victorian-era home represents the best of an era gone by, reflecting the beauty and refinement of the early years of the 20th century and showcasing a critical chapter in Louisville’s history.\n\nBuilt in 1895, the Conrad-Caldwell House is a prime example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture. Seeming more like a castle than a home, this house-turned-museum sits as an anchor of one of the largest and most well-preserved Victorian-era neighborhoods in the country. There are both self-guided and guided tours available, allowing you to learn more about the architecture of the home, the families who resided there and the impact the property has had on the city at large.\n\nDine at the Most Delicious Local Restaurants in Louisville\n\nThe Louisville dining scene effortlessly blends the charm of Southern comfort food with the refined tastes of luxury that people have come to expect during Derby Week. When you book a trip to the Kentucky Derby, our pre-travel specialists can assist you with personalized recommendations for your stay so you can soak up all the flavor of Derby season.\n\nThese are a few of the restaurants that we always recommend to Louisville travelers:\n\nStart Your Day the Right Way at Wild Eggs\n\nWild Eggs has long been known as a local hotspot, and it’s always our pick when we want to have a nourishing breakfast or a lavish brunch. Opening its doors during the week at 6:30 a.m. and at 7 a.m. on the weekends, this place is perfect for early risers. It gets busy fast though, especially during Derby Week, so we always recommend getting there as early as possible. If you do have to wait, don’t worry — it will be worth it. And no matter what meal you choose, be sure to top it off with a glass of their freshly-squeezed orange juice.\n\nSlice Into a Simmering Steak at Jeff Ruby’s\n\nJeff Ruby’s Louisville\n\nWith an art deco theme and a sophisticated vibe, Jeff Ruby’s offers an upscale dining experience in Louisville that offers all of the pomp and pageantry you crave without any of the stuffiness you might expect at a premier local steakhouse. The atmosphere is lively — and even a bit raucous at times — but it perfectly aligns with the spirit of Derbying it Up! Naturally, we recommend that you enjoy the steak when you dine at Jeff Ruby’s. We recommend Jeff Ruby’s for those arriving in Louisville early, as this popular spot books up well in advance for Derby week.\n\nSoak Up the Smokehouse Atmosphere at Doc Crow’s\n\nFor all of the smoky flavor of the south, head straight to Doc Crow’s, a self-described Southern smokehouse and raw bar. This location is known for its casual atmosphere and mouth-watering food, and you can’t beat the extensive bourbon list that will complement all of the selections on the menu. We always find ourselves recommending the shrimp po-boy, but of course, you can’t go wrong with the smokehouse sampler if you are truly looking to enjoy all things BBQ.\n\nCelebrate In Style at 610 Magnolia\n\nDerby Week is nothing if not impressive, and the best way to experience all of the shimmer and shine of the season is to indulge in a fine dining experience at 610 Magnolia. Run by celebrity chef Edward Lee, this restaurant offers a 4-course or 6-course tasting menu that can be accompanied by wine or bourbon pairings. Reservations are required, and they fill up well in advance of Derby Week, so if you are looking to dine here you may want to secure your spot as soon as possible.\n\nImmerse Yourself in the Glitz and Glamour at the Best Derby Parties\n\nThe prestige of the Kentucky Derby appeals to the elite — bringing celebrities and influential figures from around the world to the heart of Louisville. For many of these exclusive parties and events, you may need to know someone in order to gain entrance, and fortunately, the pre-travel specialists at Roadtrips offer the exclusive connections that you need.\n\nThese are just a few of the Derby Week parties where the champagne will be flowing as music fills the air:\n\nMint Julep Sunset Social\n\nGet an early start on Derby weekend at this lively and fun experience. Spend Thursday night at Hermitage Farm where you’ll enjoy a perfectly timed sunset tour of this beautiful property. Afterwards, take advantage of the build-your-own mint julep bar before indulging in a memorable farm-to-table dinner featuring southern cuisine.\n\nTaste of Derby\n\nTaste of Derby\n\nRub elbows with VIPs of the horse racing world at this upscale social evening. You’ll be treated to exquisite Kentucky flavors courtesy of master chefs as they participate in a live cooking showdown. Great wine pairings and live music complement the experience. Our team will arrange transportation to and from the venue.\n\nBarnstable Brown Gala\n\nIt’s the quintessential Derby Party: The Barnstable Brown Gala. With its history and penchant for attracting the biggest names in entertainment, this is one of the most famous parties in the country. This black-tie gala is the place to see and be seen on Derby Eve.\n\nKick-Off Derby Weekend at the Kentucky Oaks\n\nKentucky Oaks 2023\n\nDerby first-timers might be surprised to find out that the Kentucky Derby isn’t the only horse race of the weekend. In fact, the weekend kicks off each year with the Kentucky Oaks race. This race is held annually the day before the Kentucky Derby, and it is considered to be the premier racing event for 3-year-old fillies. The winner of the race is traditionally donned with a cascading garland of lilies, earning the race the nickname of “Lilies for Fillies.”\n\nWhile you will need to have your larger-than-life hat ready for the Kentucky Derby race, the attire for this event has a more charitable endeavor. Guests at the Kentucky Oaks arrive in every shade of pink in order to raise awareness for breast cancer research. Whether you want to wear a pair of pink sunglasses or arrive in your brightest Barbiecore outfit, you will feel good knowing that you are getting into the spirit of raising funds to help support women’s health issues.\n\nDetails for the 2024 event have yet to be announced, but you can count on an exciting day of racing in the lead up to the Kentucky Derby the next day.\n\nSip on Mint Juleps\n\nMint Julep\n\nPerhaps the most sought-after accessory at the Kentucky Derby — aside from hats and fascinators — is the mint julep. As the official cocktail of Derby Weekend, this refreshing beverage is a Derby Day essential. Over the course of the weekend, bartenders will pour more than 100,000 mint juleps, which are an expert blend of bourbon, mint and sugar syrup.\n\nWhile there are mint juleps to try at nearly every restaurant in Louisville, you can indulge in a particularly exhilarating beverage by purchasing a $1,000 mint julep for charity. The drink is made from premium ingredients, so it’s truly the best of the best, and you’ll feel good knowing that you are supporting a local cause as you indulge in this ultimate trackside luxury.\n\nDon Your Brightest, Boldest Hat and Prepare for the Derby Hat Parade\n\nThe Derby Hat Parade may not be an official event with a pre-planned route, but it’s still one of the highlights of Derby Weekend, and a tradition that you simply must partake in. As legend has it, the hat that you wear is supposed to bring you good luck with the races, so if you are planning to place a bet, you won’t want to forget this important accessory. Go big, go bold and make any statement that you want — your hat is the star of the show at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nEnjoy “The Run for the Roses”\n\nNaturally, the excitement of Derby Week culminates on the first Saturday in May each year, which is day that “The Run for the Roses” finally takes place. Whether it’s your first trip to the Derby or you are a seasoned expert, you may find it a bit overwhelming to navigate the crowds of more than 150,000 attendees. Fortunately, our pre-travel specialists are at your service to make your experience as seamless as possible and can provide personalized recommendations based on your preferences. You can find more insider tips in our guide, Kentucky Derby Tips for First Timers.\n\nIn order to make the most out of your Derby Day, we recommend you:\n\nBring cash with you. You can’t place a bet on your credit card.\n\nPack a snack — outside food is allowed.\n\nDownload the Churchill Downs Racetrack app in advance\n\nThe race may go by in the blink of an eye, but the unparalleled experiences that you enjoy in Louisville throughout Derby Season will stick with you for a lifetime. These are the kind of monumental events that memories are made of, and they are well worth the investment of your time and resources.\n\nBecome Part of the Tradition of the Kentucky Derby — Book Your Trip Today"
