Gently stick a toothpick into each ball.\n\nStep 2:\n\nTake your yardstick or dowel, and attach the Earth model to one end with a binder clip.\n\nStep 3:\n\nMeasure 30 inches away from the Earth ball using your yardstick or measuring tape, and attach the Moon ball there with the other binder clip. Your model now represents the average distance between the Earth and Moon if they were this size.\n\nStep 4:\n\nTake your model outside on a sunny day, or have someone shine a flashlight toward you.\n\nHold the model so the stick points toward the Sun or flashlight, with the Moon ball closer to the light, and try to line up the Earth ball so that the Moon’s tiny shadow lands on it.\n\nDon't worry if it takes time to do this. It’s difficult!\n\nThink About It!\n\nEven though the real Earth and Moon feel pretty big to us, they are much smaller than the space between them, and they very rarely line up with the Sun exactly.\n\nThat’s why we only see eclipses a few times per year.\n\nMaterials Needed:\n\nOne large ball, like a beach ball or basketball\n\nOne small ball, like a tennis ball\n\nA bright light source, like the Sun or a flashlight\n\nStep 1:\n\nChoose who will hold the Earth (the large ball) and who will hold the Moon (the small ball).\n\nStep 2:\n\nHave the person holding the Earth stand in one place while the person holding the Moon takes three big steps away from the Earth.\n\nStep 3:\n\nHold up the Moon in front of the light source and make a shadow on the Earth. You've just created an eclipse!\n\nStep 4:\n\nMove the Moon's shadow so it moves across the Earth. You've just created a model of the solar eclipse path!\n\nThink About It!\n\nWhat did you notice about the shadow of the Moon on the Earth? Does it cover the whole Earth or just part of it?\n\nModified from a NISENet Solar Eclipse activity"
