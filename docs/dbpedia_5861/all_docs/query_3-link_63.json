        "text": "The 149th running of the Kentucky Derby is Saturday.\n\nYou know, this it was first run in 1875.\n\nAnd there are things about the Derby's history you might not know.\n\nThe track wasn't always called Churchill Downs.\n\nIt was originally called the Louisville Jockey Club.\n\nBut many of the traditions we've come to know and love the hats, the roses, the mint juleps are traditions that date back to those first derby races more than a century ago.\n\nWe caught up with Rachel Collier, director of communication for the Kentucky Derby Museum, to give us a little bit of a history lesson.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby is the longest continuously running sporting event in the United States.\n\nIt has never not run since 1875.\n\nSo there is a gentleman by the name of Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr.\n\nHe is the founder of Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHis name, if it sounds familiar, that's Clark.\n\nAnd there he was related.\n\nHis great uncle was George Rogers Clark, founder of Louisville.\n\nIn 1875, the very first Kentucky Derby, we had just a field of 15 horses.\n\nThere was a crowd of 10,000 people.\n\nAnd the first winner of the Kentucky Derby is a horse named Aristides.\n\nHe was written by a black jockey named Oliver Louis.\n\nAnd in 1902, the track was on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nAnd there was a group of investors who came in, and one of them was named Matt Wynn.\n\nMatt Wynn was a marketing genius, and he wanted to make this race world renowned.\n\nAnd he did it.\n\nHe did it in several ways.\n\nHe would recruit the top horses and convince people you need to bring your horse here and race your horse in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nAnd we got really lucky.\n\nIn 1913, we had a horse named Donna Rail who won.\n\nHe was the longest longshot to win the Kentucky Derby and still is to this day.\n\nThe next year we had a horse by the name of Old Rosebud when old Rosebud set a record.\n\nSo that was another thrill.\n\nAnd then finally, in 1915, Matt Wynn recruited a horse, a filly named Regret.\n\nShe whips, the boys, start to finish.\n\nShe led that race and she won by two lengths.\n\nAnd it was just as Matt Wynn predicted crazy media coverage.\n\nThose three years in a row were pivotal moments for the Kentucky Derby, and Matt Wynn took it a step further.\n\nAnd through the years, he developed many of the traditions that we still know today.\n\nThe garland of roses that is blanketed upon the winner of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nHe also started the tradition of the mint julep collectible glasses.\n\nHe also started the tradition of the Gold Cup.\n\nAnd it is a solid gold trophy that is awarded to the winner each year.\n\nWhen you really look at what the Kentucky Derby has survived through, it is pretty incredible.\n\nIt has never not run.\n\nWe've always had it.\n\nIt survived a world war.\n\nIt ran in June that year, didn't run the first Saturday May, but it ran in June.\n\nIt has survived the Great Depression Prohibition era.\n\nOf course, we have people sneaking in booze.\n\nWe know that it survived a pandemic, which we all saw.\n\nWe had that September derby, but we were bound and determined to have that or we weren't going to ruin that tradition of not having it run.\n\nAnd then finally, in 2022, it was bridge strike was the horse and the victory that everyone needed.\n\nHe was the horse that didn't even belong in the Derby.\n\nThere was a last minute scratch.\n\nHe came into the field.\n\nWow, what a thrilling victory to watch him win.\n\nAnd it was a story that people are still talking about.\n\nYou think about over 100 years of stories, whether it's the horse, the story, the trainer, the jockey has a neat story, and then everybody who's attending or watching it has a story about the bet that they made or the bet that they lost or that they liked a horse because of the name.\n\nA lot of people have a really specific or special memory tied to a Kentucky Derby that they've watched or one that just stands out to them.\n\nNow, before you watch the Derby Saturday, join Kelsey Starks and Chip Holston for Inside the Kentucky Derby.\n\nFind out more about the Derby's history and traditions.\n\nThat's Friday night at nine Eastern, eight Central right here on K.T.."
