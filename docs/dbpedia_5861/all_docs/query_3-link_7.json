        "text": "Jenny Pfanenstiel of Formé Millinery Announced as\n\nOfficial Milliner of the Kentucky Derby Museum\n\nInternational, award-winning couture milliner, sculptor, author and educator\n\nbrings one-of-kind hats and expertise to Museum\n\nLOUISVILLE, Ky. (Feb. 24, 2017) - The Kentucky Derby Museum is pleased to announce Louisville milliner Jenny Pfanenstiel of Formé Millinery as the Official Milliner of the Kentucky Derby Museum. Pfanenstiel is an award-winning milliner, specializing in using age-old techniques that date back over 100 years, as a true couture milliner once did. She describes her unique creations for men, women and children as \"sculptures\" for the head.\n\nMost recently, Pfanenstiel created an inauguration hat for Karen Pence, wife of Vice President Mike Pence as well as for his sister-in-law, Denise. She's also designed hats for a wide-array of top celebrities including Former First Lady Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Madonna, just to name a few.\n\nHer work has been featured in specialty boutiques around the world, on the app, Covet Fashion and in publications such as Vogue, Country Living and Southwest In-Flight Magazine as well as on several national media outlets. This Derby season she worked with Vineyard Vines on a co-branded Derby fascinator collaboration. She is also a hat designer for McCalls Patterns, with her flat hat patterns available in local craft stores.\n\nIn addition to designing and creating hats, Pfanenstiel is also an author and educator. Her first book, \"The Making of a Milliner\" was published in 2015. She is dedicated to teaching the art of couture millinery and currently holds group and private workshops around the world. She eventually plans to open the Formé School of Millinery.\n\n\"I am truly humbled to have been asked to be The Official Milliner of the Kentucky Derby Museum. To partner with an organization that focuses on preserving the history of the Kentucky Derby, is quite an honor,\" Pfanenstiel said. \"I look forward to not only creating Derby-style hats and fascinators and all of the wonderful experiences that come with this partnership, but also contributing my time throughout the year, to help educate others on the history of hats at the Kentucky Derby, through their educational programs that are offered.\"\n\nPfanenstiel currently has one of her signature hats on display in the Museum's \"It's My Derby\" hat exhibit. A select number of her hats are available for purchase in the Museum's gift shop.\n\nShe will also be on hand to lend her expertise on Kentucky Derby hat styling during the Museum's upcoming Big Brims and Fancy Trims Hat Sample Sale on Thursday, April 6th.\n\nFor more on Jenny Pfanenstiel and Formé Millinery, including hats for sale, visit here.\n\nEditor's Note: Pronunciation guide: Jenny Pfanenstiel (fan-en-steel), Formé (Four-may) Millinery"
