        "text": "It’s Derby week, y’all, with Mother’s Day celebrations closing fast, right behind. The Kentucky Derby is always the first Saturday in May. Mother’s Day is always the second Sunday in May. Since this year May 1 falls on a Sunday, there you go: the first full weekend in May looks like a Superfecta for memory-making Kentucky fun.\n\nMother’s Day became an official holiday in 1914 when President Woodrow Wilson signed a proclamation designating the second Sunday in May a day to honor our nation’s mothers. That was thirty-nine years after the first Kentucky Derby, when Aristides and African American jockey Oliver Lewis crossed the line two lengths ahead of Volcano.\n\nWith that, the Sport of Kings was born! Have fun with it this week—but, if you want to stay far clear of the doghouse, make sure the Queen of Your Household is priority number one.\n\nIf you are not from Kentucky, you may be asking: What is burgoo? Burgoo is a hearty, somewhat spicy stew made with a variety of meats, vegetables, and seasonings. The origin of burgoo is unclear. It is likely the stew was created as a warm and hearty meal of whatever meats, vegetables, and seasonings were available at the time. The meats that were originally used in burgoo may seem a little peculiar today: They included venison, raccoon, squirrel, rabbit, possum, and fowl—in other words, whatever a person was able to kill and add to the pot. Today, the meat is much tamer: It is likely to be some mixture of pork, lamb, chicken, and beef. The ingredients were usually cooked in water along with seasonings very slowly for hours over an open fire in large cast iron pots and constantly stirred with large paddles usually made for the job. The time and effort required to make the concoction meant it had be prepared in large amounts to serve huge crowds.\n\nIn Kentucky during the early 1800s, the dish became associated with the agriculture industry when it was served at livestock sales. From there, it was a natural transition to be served at horse racing events where folks gathered to socialize, compete, and buy and sell horses.\n\nThroughout Kentucky, there were individuals who became known for their skill at making burgoo. Their recipes, each of which was different, were highly protected secrets handed down in families. One of the earliest legendary burgoo makers was Gus Jaubert, a saloon operator in Lexington, who at one time prepared 6,000 gallons of burgoo for a Louisville Civil War veterans’ reunion in 1895. Frankfort's Buffalo Trace distillery hired Jaubert to cook for its employees. Two of his big iron burgoo kettles are still on view at the distillery's Burgoo House. Before long Jaubert became known as “the Father of Burgoo” and was catering events across the state. Another noted burgoo maker was J. T. Looney, a grocer from Lexington, who became known as the “Burgoo King.” Mr. Looney was so popular that a racehorse was named for him: Burgoo King, who went on to win the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 1932.\n\nWhen the Kentucky Derby was established in 1875, burgoo naturally made its way as a popular food option at the racetrack. Today, burgoo is an important part of the racing tradition at the Derby and at the Keeneland Racecourse in Lexington, where some of the qualifying races for the Derby are held. Since the 1930s, Keeneland has been serving the same recipe for Kentucky burgoo that is cooked for hours in an enormous kettle. The burgoo is so popular that Keeneland goes through between ninety and 100 gallons of the stew each week.\n\nOuita Michel, a popular restaurant owner in Central Kentucky who supports the local food movement, has been quoted as saying that “Burgoo is essential to Derby not because the meat is particularly flavorful or the presentation is uniquely ornate; it’s a dish that’s filled with so much memory.” She also noted, “It’s been made by so many different groups of people. That multidimensional story is what makes it special and an essential part of who we are in Kentucky.”\n\nSince Burgoo continues to be an integral part of the horse racing experience in Kentucky, make sure to enjoy a bowl when you’re at the track. If hosting a Derby party, why not make a batch of burgoo for your guests? Make sure to offer cornbread, saltine crackers, or oyster-type crackers as a side. The key is to let the mixture cook for several hours. Keeneland’s version of burgoo that has been served at the track for years is set out below. Grab a bowl with your guests and join in on the singing of “My Old Kentucky Home” as the horses parade to the post.\n\nRecipe for Keeneland Burgoo\n\nServing Size: 10–12\n\nIngredients:\n\n1 cup celery, diced\n\n1 cup carrots, diced\n\n1 cup onion, diced\n\n3 lbs. stew meat, cubed\n\n1 tsp. ground thyme\n\n1 tsp. ground sage\n\n1 tsp. granulated garlic\n\n1 tsp. ground oregano\n\n1 (12 oz.) can diced tomatoes in juice\n\n3 lbs. frozen mixed vegetables (corn, lima beans, green beans)\n\n1 (7 oz.) can tomato puree\n\n1 (7 oz.) can tomato sauce\n\n1 lb. frozen okra, sliced\n\n1 tbsp. beef base\n\n1 tsp.

Spread Formation: Tailgating and Home Recipes From College Football Greats!\n\nRecipe by Keeneland Racecourse executive chef Ed Boutilier. Adapted from Spread Formation.\n\nWhat I did not quite prepare for was the mountain of material culture the song has generated, the variety of objects that bear its stamp, ranging from predictable postcards and generations of songbooks to postage stamps, doorbells, bracelets, barware, garden flags, fried chicken boxes, bedding, and much, much more.\n\nMy biography of the song argues that “My Old Kentucky Home” was never just a song. It was from the outset about a man being sold for cash downriver from Kentucky to die in the sugarcane fields of the Deep South—a blackface minstrel tune featuring the trade in human beings. It says a great deal about this nation’s ability to ignore uncomfortable aspects of its history that this same song offered white Americans a soothing cocktail of sentiment and nostalgia for old times, papering over the realities of slavery and Jim Crow. (Click here to listen to singers performing the 1853 tune.) “My Old Kentucky Home” became a kind of sonic monument—white America’s song to itself.\n\nMusic enters us, becomes part of our breath, and this song is sung en masse each year at the Kentucky Derby by 150,000-plus spectators. It rings out on state occasions and at University of Kentucky basketball and football games (which one might mistake for state occasions). Over the years, I have grappled with the ways this haunted melody became ensconced in actual homes, morphing onto things that were touched and held close, ornaments caressed by millions of hands and eyes and lips. These may seem banal, but I believe they too make deep impressions.\n\nI couldn’t fit these items into the pages of my book. They could easily fill a small museum, and perhaps the Frazier will one day undertake an exhibition. But I wonder: what is missed when the story of “My Old Kentucky Home” is told without accounting for its physical manifestation in everyday lives and its presence in the consumer culture? How has the song’s meaning been shaped by the way it has been acquired, possessed, collected, and worn?\n\nThe economy of its creation and dissemination involved Foster, perhaps the first American professional songwriter, being paid two pennies (about eight percent) as a royalty on each copy of official sheet music of “My Old Kentucky Home” that was sold. (Nobody could control pirated editions.) Scholars estimate nearly 70,000 copies were bought in the first decade, but that was not enough to keep him afloat. Foster, thirty-seven, died in Bellevue Hospital in New York City during the Civil War with thirty-eight cents to his name. Of course, his music publishers made a great deal more money off the song, as did the blackface minstrels who performed it to audiences across the country and the globe.\n\nKentucky didn’t make much of the melody at all until fifty years later, when Jim Crow segregation was taking hold in the nation. The largest physical manifestation of the song surely was the Kentucky building at the St. Louis World’s Fair of 1904, which deployed the tune as a brand to attract people and their money. Foster’s music floated out of the wide open doorways every hour of every day. Thousands of visitors left with printed copies of the melody as keepsakes. Souvenir buttons invited everyone to feel they owned at least a symbolic piece of the place: “Ky. Home—World’s Fair—‘It’s Part Mine.’”\n\nKentucky seemed to give freely of itself and its hospitality, and more people visited the state’s building that showcased its culture and economic promise than any other outside Missouri’s. White America was embracing (or at least tolerating) racial segregation, racial terror, and disfranchisement. It was time to let Civil War bygones be bygones and get back to business. A familiar sentimental song that invoked a Kentucky plantation set the ideal mood. “My Old Kentucky Home,” one observer noted at the time, brought a poor state “more publicity than any other one thing.”\n\nTwo decades later, Foster and his song were officially enshrined when the Old Kentucky Home opened as a tourist attraction in Bardstown. Visitors from everywhere came to see “the home” that (according to myth) gave rise to this “immortal melody.” And they could take a piece of the myth home with them in the form of ashtrays, matchbooks, and compact makeup cases like one a friend sent me after a visit to an antique mall. Someone held it in her palm and used it to feel more beautiful before clicking closed its pink enamel cover and slipping it into her purse.\n\nThe Kentucky Historical Society has metal shelving reaching into the rafters to hold bits of the state’s physical patrimony. One item is a framed counted cross stitch pattern from 1980. The song’s original lyrics, “The sun shines bright on the old Kentucky home / ‘Tis summer, the darkies are gay” waft above the iconic brick Bardstown house sewn in red. The song was literally stitched into the thoughts and feelings of the person who completed the pattern.\n\nFoster hailed from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and one of the most fruitful sources for my book about his song was the University of Pittsburgh. Over the course of a decade, the Indianapolis pharmaceutical executive J. K. Lilly spent millions collecting and disseminating everything he could find about the songwriter. He called it “Fosteriana” and gifted the collection to the school in Foster’s home city. I spent weeks at “Foster Hall” at a library table groaning with everything from letters to letter openers, drinking glasses to magical glass lantern slides that projected the “story” of “My Old Kentucky Home.” But my hands nearly shook when I pulled from a box a pastel-colored plate dated 1941.\n\nThe chorus to “My Old Kentucky Home” goes like this:\n\nWeep no more, my lady,\n\nOh! weep no more today!\n\nWe will sing one song\n\nFor the old Kentucky Home,\n\nFor the old Kentucky Home, far away.\n\nThe figure of the “lady” hovered in my mind from my earliest memories of the song. Who was she, I wondered? When my husband first came to Kentucky at Derby time, he was struck by the hoop-skirted women who greeted air travelers with baskets of Bourbon-laced bonbons. The antebellum atmosphere seemed to stretch across the weekend, with that lady of the chorus as a sort of center pole.\n\nA logical reading of Foster’s lyric might suggest that the “lady” was the enslaved man’s beloved back in Kentucky, and he sings to her, from the Deep South where he will die in the fields, of bygone days when they were together. This might sound sympathetic, but blackface only laughed at Black “ladies”—who were cross-dressing white men in cork. Another interpretation might suggest that the “lady” was the “mistress” of the plantation, someone who dressed like the women in the Louisville airport. But intimacy between a Black man and a white woman was an even more mine-filled potentiality than a “lady” who was enslaved.\n\nEnter artist Willoughby Ions of Richmond. In 1941, she created a hand-painted series of Stephen Foster dinnerware, which sold in an upscale Manhattan department store. For “My Old Kentucky Home,” she depicted a white “lady” in a garden or grove, with a big house in the background. She cries into her handkerchief. A Black man kneels at her feet, pleading with her to “weep no more.”\n\nThe shorthand of an object conveyed what few were willing to express in so many words: that a white songwriter’s imagined depiction of a man sold away from his family to die was never really about the people it purported to be concerned with. It was about the satisfactions, hierarchies, and sentiments of the race that created and staged and bought the song.\n\nWho ate off these plates? Did they hang in peoples’ homes? Someone dusted, soaped, and dried them over years. The plate’s charming style reveals a brutal reality about “My Old Kentucky Home” and gender and race in America. It unlocks the ugliness of what for generations was expected of Black people when it came to white feelings.\n\nChosen for the Mother’s Day issue of Frazier Weekly, the Mollie letter proves the state motto of Kentucky—“United We Stand, Divided We Fall”—has always applied to Kentuckians and their mothers.\n\nOn May 23, 1862, a loving daughter in Georgetown, Kentucky, named Mollie wrote this letter to her mother, whose address is not known. “My Dear Mother,” it begins. “How I miss our mails! After hearing nothing for many days, at last the long-expected letter came, and my heart was made inexpressibly lighter, except that its made me very homesick and kept me crying for a half hour.”\n\nIn the letter, which spans eight pages, Mollie describes her day-to-day life and social visits from her close friends. She also goes into detail about how much she misses her mother, although her mother has only been away visiting family for a couple of months. Mollie talks to her mother about decisions she must make regarding a number of things, such as job opportunities. She says she may not be invited back to the schoolhouse after the school year ends and that she does not enjoy children, so being a governess would not be a good fit, either. She is also uncertain about a gentleman who is courting her friend, and reports that her friend has nothing good to say about the man, but still wants her to think well of him.\n\n“My candle is sinking and my eyelids too,” the letter concludes. “Good night dear mother when I get home again I will always stay with you. [Enjoy?] yourself see you can. And still love your loving Daughter Mollie.”\n\nMollie wrote this letter prior to pivotal moments in the Civil War: The war had broken out in April 1861, and Confederate forces had occupied towns in Kentucky since September 1861; but it would be another two months until July 15, 1862, the day Confederate Gen. John Hunt Morgan would raid Georgetown, where Mollie lived. Had the stress of the war not affected Mollie yet, or was she trying to continue to live a normal life during this hard time? These are questions whose answers we don’t have.\n\nWhat we can understand, however, is the close relationship between these two Kentuckians—and the love they shared.\n\nOne way we love to engage with kids is through their own interests. That’s why we created the camp Across the Universe (I hope my fellow Millennial parents appreciate the name!). This is a fun week of celebrating fans, fandoms, and the history behind them. We all learned that we don’t talk about Bruno, but did you know that the magical realism found in movies like Encanto can be traced back to the literary genre perfected in Latin America? What are the real legends upon which Percy Jackson is based? Do you have what it takes to be the Swedish Chef? You can find the answers to these questions and more during this camp, which we will be offering twice this summer: June 27–July 1 and July 18–22. This year promises to be extra fun, as we curated our themes based on feedback from our winter break campers.\n\nThis is always a best seller, so register today!\n\nCue another amazing Frazier gift idea!\n\nBook Club Member Perks for our May Title:\n\nALL members are welcome to participate in this program.\n\nEarly access to purchase the book.*\n\nBook available at a special discounted price.\n\nMembers and (1) guest may be included in your RSVP.\n\nCasual visit to a portion of our meeting by the author.\n\nReserved priority seating to the reading and Q & A following our meeting.\n\nBe one of the first in line to get your copy signed by the author following the Q & A.\n\nAdvance notice of our June title announcement.\n\nFor each monthly meeting you attend, you will get a chance to win a door prize at the end of the Summer program.\n\n*Access given once we receive your RSVP.
