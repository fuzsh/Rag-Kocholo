        "text": "Barbaro's final resting place may still end up at the scene of his greatest victory in the Kentucky Derby, or close to the farm where he was born.\n\nSix weeks after Barbaro was euthanized because of complications from catastrophic injuries in the Preakness, owners Gretchen and Roy Jackson on Monday were still considering where to bring the ashes of their beloved colt.\n\n\"We are still not definite about Barbaro's final resting spot,\" Gretchen Jackson said.\n\nJust after Barbaro's death, the directors of the Kentucky Derby Museum and the Kentucky Horse Park, near Lexington, offered their facilities as a final home for the Derby winner.\n\nThe Derby Museum is at Churchill Downs in Louisville, just a few hundred yards from the Derby finish line. Derby winners Carry Back, Sunny's Halo, Brokers Tip and Swaps are buried on the museum grounds.\n\nThe Jacksons have said they would take their time before making a decision, and also were considering a memorial for Barbaro in Pennsylvania, where the owners live and where the colt was cared for at the University of Pennsylvania's New Bolton Center in Kennett Square.\n\nWith the Derby less than eight weeks away, the museum has been featuring a video presentation of Barbaro's 2006 win several times a day.\n\n\"Derby stories are told here every day,\" museum executive director Lynn Ashton said Monday. \"He would be coming home to where he won the greatest race, the Kentucky Derby, and people would come to honor him.\"\n\nAmong the great thoroughbreds buried at the 1,200-acre Horse Park are Man O' War, War Admiral, Forego and Bold Forbes.\n\n\"Either one of us, the Horse Park or the museum, would do anything to honor the memory of Barbaro as the Jacksons see fit,\" Kentucky Horse Park executive director John Nicholson said. \"If that includes the ability of a large number of fans to have access, then either the Horse Park or the museum would be a good place.\"\n\nThe park is not far from Springmint Farm (formerly Sanborn Chase) in Nicholasville, Ky., where Barbaro romped from April 2003 until October 2004. Barbaro's father, Dynaformer, still stands at stud at Three Chimneys Farm near Midway, Ky., and his mother, La Ville Rouge, is at Mill Ridge Farm near Lexington."
