        "text": "Updated Sunday, Feb. 4, 2024, to reflect the results of the 2024 GRAMMYs, officially known as the 66th Annual GRAMMY Awards.\n\nWith a total of 86 categories celebrating the best of pop, rock, R&B, jazz, rap, Latin, classical, Musical Theater, and more, thousands of music creators have been recognized by the GRAMMYs since its inception in 1957.\n\nThe prestige of one GRAMMY win can catapult an artist's career to the next level, but there are some who have amassed more than 10, 20 and even 30 career GRAMMY wins. Ever wonder who these elite GRAMMY winners are? Look no further. We've compiled a list of the top GRAMMY winners of all time.\n\nBeyoncé, 32\n\nBeyoncé made history at the 2023 GRAMMYs by becoming the artist with the most GRAMMY wins — ever — when she won the GRAMMY for Best Dance/Electronic Music Album for her 2022 album, Renaissance. Beyoncé now counts 32 total GRAMMY wins.\n\nGeorg Solti, 31\n\nThe late conductor Georg Solti holds the record for the most GRAMMY wins in the Classical Field. Solti's last win was for Best Opera Recording for Wagner: Die Meistersinger Von Nurnberg from 1997.\n\nQuincy Jones, 28\n\nQuincy Jones' GRAMMY career as an artist/arranger/producer spans more than 10 Fields, from Children's to Jazz, Pop, Rap, R&B, and more. He is also one of only 15 artists to receive the GRAMMY Legend Award.\n\nAlison Krauss, 27\n\nAlison Krauss holds the distinction as the woman artist with the most GRAMMY Awards in the Country Field. Krauss shares 14 of her wins with her backing band of nearly 30 years, Union Station.\n\nChick Corea, 27\n\nMusician/composer Chick Corea is currently the artist with the most jazz GRAMMY wins, counting 27 GRAMMY Awards as a solo artist. Corea's Latin jazz piano stylings, compositions and arrangements have also earned him four Latin GRAMMY Awards.\n\nJohn Williams, 26\n\nJohn Williams has cashed in on cinema soundtrack classics such as Jaws, Star Wars and Schindler's List for a place among the GRAMMY elite. Of his 26 GRAMMY wins, Williams has earned 12 in the Music For Visual Media Field and six for his work on the Star Wars franchise. His most recent win came at the 60th GRAMMYs for Best Arrangement, Instrumental Or A Cappella for \"Escapades For Alto Saxophone And Orchestra from Catch Me If You Can.\n\nPierre Boulez, 26\n\nPierre Boulez earned his GRAMMYs primarily conducting the work of renowned 20th century composers such as Bela Bartók, Alban Berg and Claude Debussy. Boulez received the Recording Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015.\n\nVladimir Horowitz, 25\n\nThe late virtuoso pianist/composer Vladimir Horowitz earned GRAMMYs in every decade from the 1960s to the 1990s. He was also awarded a Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990 and has five recordings in the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame.\n\nStevie Wonder, 25\n\nNo stranger to the GRAMMY stage, Stevie Wonder is the only artist in GRAMMY history to win five or more awards on three separate nights. His career and GRAMMY history were celebrated on the television special \"Stevie Wonder: Songs In The Key Of Life — An All-Star GRAMMY Salute\" in 2015.\n\nDavid Frost, 25\n\nA giant in the Classical Field, renowned producer David Frost has won the coveted Classical Producer Of The Year GRAMMY seven times. He's also won four GRAMMYs each in the Best Classical Engineered Recording and Best Opera Recording categories over the years. Most recently, he took home three GRAMMYs at the 2024 GRAMMYs: Best Opera Recording, Best Engineered Album Classical, and Best Classical Instrumental Solo.\n\nJay-Z, 24\n\nTied with Kanye West for the most GRAMMY wins by a rap artist, Jay-Z has wins in each of the four Rap Field categories. Hova's blueprint for GRAMMY success includes collaborations with other artists such as Beyoncé (\"Drunk In Love\"), Rihanna (\"Umbrella\") and Justin Timberlake (\"Holy Grail\").\n\nKanye West, 24\n\nKanye West is neck-and-neck with Jay Z for top GRAMMY-winning rap artist, but he has often competed against himself. For example, he had two nominations (and a win) each for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song for 2012, Best Rap Album for 2011, and Best Rap Song and Best Pop Performance By A Duo Or Group for 2007.\n\nU2, 22\n\nLed by frontman Bono, U2 hold the record for most GRAMMY wins by a rock act. Their most recent wins came in 2005, including Album Of The Year for How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb.\n\nVince Gill, 22\n\nSinger/songwriter Vince Gill has earned 20 of his GRAMMY wins in the Country Field, the most of any artist. He earned his first GRAMMY outside of the Country Field in 2017 for Best American Roots Song for writing the Time Jumpers' \"Kid Sister.\" He also holds the distinction of garnering the most GRAMMYs in the 1990s (14), winning one or more GRAMMYs in every year of the decade.\n\nSerban Ghenea, 21\n\nA leading mix engineer, Serban Ghenea is a 21-time GRAMMY winner and three-time Latin GRAMMY winner. Throughout his extensive career, he’s mixed some of the biggest songs from legendary artists across a vast array of genres, including songs by Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, Beyoncé, Justin Timberlake, Usher, Bjork, Faith Hill, Carrie Underwood, Beck, and many others. As of January 2024, Ghenea has mixed over 225 No. 1 singles and albums, including hits for Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars, Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Britney Spears, Black Eyes Peas, and many more.\n\nHenry Mancini, 20\n\nThe composer behind TV and film themes such as \"Peter Gunn\" and \"The Pink Panther Theme,\" the late Henry Mancini made early GRAMMY history with a then-record five wins in one night for 1961. Mancini's popular \"Moon River\" and later \"Days Of Wine And Roses\" each won both Record and Song Of The Year.\n\nPat Metheny, 20\n\nPat Metheny is all that jazz. The guitarist earned his first GRAMMY for Best Jazz Fusion Performance, Vocal Or Instrumental for Offramp for 1982. He has earned GRAMMYs in four consecutive decades since, most recently in 2012 as the Pat Metheny Unity Band for Unity Band for Best Jazz Instrumental Album.\n\nAl Schmitt, 20\n\nWorking on projects by artists Ray Charles, Natalie Cole, Chick Corea, and Paul McCartney, among others, Al Schmitt won his 20 GRAMMYs as an engineer/mixer. Schmitt has also earned two Latin GRAMMYs and he received the Recording Academy Trustees Award in 2006.\n\nBruce Springsteen, 20\n\nIn addition to GRAMMY wins in every decade from the '80s through '00s, Bruce Springsteen has seen his albums Born To Run and Born In The U.S.A. inducted into the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame. In 2013 the quintessential rocker was honored as the MusiCares Person of the Year.\n\nTony Bennett, 19\n\nAn artist who truly seems to get better with age, Tony Bennett has won nine of his 18 career GRAMMYs since 2002. Including his 2015 win with Bill Charlap for The Silver Lining: The Songs Of Jerome Kern, Bennett has earned Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album honors 13 times, the most in the category's history.\n\nYo-Yo Ma, 19\n\nCellist Yo-Yo Ma has strung together 18 GRAMMY wins, earning his first in 1984 for Bach: The Unaccompanied Cello Suites. Since then he's won GRAMMYs in the Folk and World Music Fields, the latter of which came for 2016 for the Best World Music Album-winning project with his Silk Road Ensemble, Sing Me Home.\n\nAretha Franklin, 18\n\nAretha Franklin reigns as the queen of R&B. She has 18 GRAMMY wins to date, five recordings in the GRAMMY Hall Of Fame, a Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award (1994) and a GRAMMY Legend Award (1991).\n\nPaul McCartney, 18\n\nWinning Best New Artist with the Beatles for 1964, Paul McCartney has gone on to earn 18 career GRAMMYs as an artist, composer and arranger. While most of McCartney's GRAMMY history lies in pop and rock, he earned two 58th GRAMMY nominations for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance for Kanye West's \"All Day\" with Theophilus London and Allan Kingdom.\n\nJimmy Sturr, 18\n\nOut of the 25 GRAMMYs ever awarded for polka, Jimmy Sturr earned 18 of them, including 13 wins for Best Polka Album. He will likely remain the highest GRAMMY-winning polka artist in history (given the discontinuation of the category), and was \"Born To Polka.\"\n\nIt’s been ten years since you broke out with the massive hit \"Johnny.\" Back then, African pop music was relatively unknown in America. Since then, African artists have gained global recognition. Do you see yourself as a pioneer for the current Afropop movement?\n\nI agree with you 100 percent, there is no way you authentically go through the history of, you know, building a bridge between Africa and the rest of the world via music without mentioning a song like \"Johnny.\" It's definitely an honor for me to be the vessel that delivers such amazing music to the world. Of course, there were people way before me who also did the same thing. We're talking about Fela [Kuti]. We're talking about King Sunny Ade. At the end of the day, yes, music is metamorphosing into so much more. And definitely, I'm a pioneer [laughs].\n\nYou have a strong sense of storytelling, especially in your music videos. \"Johnny\" has an entire storyline about a news reporter investigating a womanizer. How important is that kind of storytelling to your music?\n\nStorytelling is a big part of my artistry, because I feel everybody loves a good story. I find that even when I'm writing most times in the studio, there's always a picture I'm trying to paint, and it only makes sense for the visuals to kind of match that most of the time. Except sometimes we decide to make it a performance video because I just feel like dancing.\n\nWhat’s the most memorable video you’ve ever done?\n\nEvery one of my videos has taken a lot of pain, sweat, and even some tears. But I think \"Johnny\" is such a masterpiece, because it resonated with the entire world, and Africa especially. And it pretty much helped me to stay on my way through the industry, because it became my identity. That song and that video was the platform for the brand and everything that I am today. you know, so that is definitely the most memorable, in a good way.\n\nYou've traveled to and performed in America several times in your career. What's your overall impression?\n\nI think I've done four or five American tours. And yo, America is so big [laughs]. My first American tour had me in shambles, because of the flights. I didn't realize that to go from one city to another, I might have to connect once or twice depending on how far I'm going. So the flights had me in shambles, but the energy of the people? Oh my days, lit! America is definitely one of my favorite places. I’m always reminding my agents to make sure that they include American cities on my tours, which is why even for the album listening parties for Rebel Queen, we did the first one in Paris, then London, and then we had to come to New York as well. And then just yesterday, we had one in Lagos as well.\n\nSince you first became popular, a lot of Afrobeats artists have gained a following abroad like Burna Boy and WizKid. It seems as though, at least looking at the artists that break outside of Africa, that the genre is still very male-dominated. Do you agree with that? And do you think there’s potential for more female artists to break out internationally?\n\nHonestly, when I started out, the odds were really way more against women than they are right now, in that, there were female artists sprouting maybe once every two years, or once every year, and barely hanging around long enough. But now, the story is different. And I give kudos to all the women before me and all the women with me. Yes, in a male dominated society, it seems as though my male counterparts get their roses and their flowers for a second. And you know, once in a while someone comes back and remembers, \"Oh, there's Yemi Alade.\" Do you know what I mean?\n\nI was speaking to someone earlier today and I was saying, I think what surprises me the most is that, I feel like there are no expectations of female artists. So like, if we do or we don't, people are just moving on. But I'm not the one to play victim, never. Despite the odds, you see that the females continue to be resilient, because we know. I know deep within that my existence is definitely of value to so many people out there.\n\nWhat do you think of the upcoming generation of talent like Tems and Ayra Starr and Tyla, who recently won the first GRAMMY Award for Best African Music Performance for \"Water?\"\n\nExceptional, exceptional artists. As you just mentioned, they're doing amazingly well. And, you know, these women are unique in their own ways. And I want to just say that I believe it's just the starting point for them. There's so much to come. And there's so many other females that are still en route to greatness.\n\nHow have you seen the music industry in Africa evolve? And what sorts of challenges do you think African musicians face today?\n\nI personally feel like, with all the momentum that Afrobeats has got, we need authentic platforms that can actually check the streaming numbers that are coming in for music, especially within Africa. Because at the moment it’s mostly Apple, Spotify, etc. But there are other platforms here in Africa that most Africans use, and they have more of a database compared to Apple and Spotify. We've come to a point where we need to have more credible numbers, because there's millions of people streaming music in Africa that are not on those platforms.\n\nSo you think that these local platforms need to be counted alongside Apple and Spotify?\n\n100 percent. In Nigeria there’s two: Audiomack and Boomplay. Boomplay is a big deal.\n\nYou’re going on a decade in the industry. In all that time, what's one moment or one achievement that gives you the greatest sense of accomplishment? What are you most proud of in your career?\n\nThat’s a big question…I think I have an idea, because there've been so many moments in my life and in my career that have aligned with my dreams coming true. Number one is each time that I'm approached by a complete stranger and the stranger tells me \"Oh my God, Yemi. You don't know what your music has done for me. Your music has gotten me through so much grief.\" Some people walk up to me and tell me that they just had the biggest struggle in their life and they listen to my music, and it always sends them into a realm of joy and happiness. Honestly, I feel accomplished in those moments, because when I record my music, I always say, the thing I'm trying to spread through my music the most is love, joy and happiness. So to have people testify to that, it means to me that the magic is complete, that my job is actually effective. So that makes me feel very accomplished.\n\nOn a personal note, an accomplishment that I am most grateful to is the fact that I'm always able to comfortably take care of my family. It's something that I would never play down. You know, I'm just grateful to God for that.\n\nAnd lastly, aside from winning a GRAMMY through Angelique Kidjo — you know, I've met a lot of amazing people, and Beyoncé is one of them. So at the end of the day, it's a full circle moment for me. I'm just enjoying the ride.\n\nYou know, it’s funny you mentioned Beyoncé, I was just about to ask you what it was like to work with her.\n\nOh my days — wow, working with her, it was such an experience for myself and my team. It was like, we're literally awake, walking in the dreams that we have dreamt for so long.The process of her team contacting us was a bit weird, because my management didn't realize that Parkwood [Entertainment] was a real company, that they were emailing them and talking about Beyoncé. They assumed that it was some kind of scam artist. But when they had sent it to me, I was like \"What? Parkwood? Who doesn’t know Parkwood is Beyoncé?\"\n\nSo it turned out that it was for real, and we went to L.A. where the studio was, and I lost my voice for 24 hours — I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t sing. I just soaked up all the vitamin C's and hot teas and Throat Coats I could get. I managed to regain a little bit of my voice back and that's what I was able to record that day. That was a miracle for me. But one of the most memorable moments was actually meeting her in person. After the album, Lion King, came out, the movie was being premiered in London, and I happened to be in London at that time. We had met her in person, we met Jay Z. It was such a full circle moment. Honestly, that lady has really touched my life in a way that I will never forget. Because she could have lived her life without doing what she did, but she decided to reach out to people she felt were pillars of African music and pay homage to Africa. And I'm happy to have been part of that moment.\n\nWhat’s it like living in Los Angeles after growing up in the Bay Area?\n\nI moved to L.A. when I was about 17. I had already left the house. I left the house at 14, and by the time I was almost 18 it was the appropriate time for me to situate in a new place. L.A. and the Bay are like cousins. Do we have differences? Absolutely, things that are fundamental to us, but when you leave California, you can really see that we're just like a big family.\n\nHad you been dreaming of L.A. as a place where you could pursue art? Were you already set on that goal?\n\nIt was the closest place that a young, very broke person could go and work in music. I'm sure there were other places with musical homes, musical cities, but if all I had to do was get on a $15 bus and go find someone to stay with in L.A., I was gonna do it for sure.\n\nThat’s the same ambition that I feel drives this new record, which is just so dense and full of surprises. That includes the lovely retro radio intro to \"GrooveTheory,\" where you move from this ‘60s pop feel to the present. That’s such a smart way to foreground your evolution.\n\nI think the second that we made that song and then turned it into [\"GrooveTheory\"], I was like, This feels like it encompasses where I'm headed, this whole new sound.\n\nOnce that radio dials in and it comes in with R&B elements, it's producing where I'm headed, but also remembering that my core hasn't changed. Especially the energy of what I'm saying in the song, like, \"I'm kind of crazy,\" it's introducing this energy difference on this album. I feel like that's the biggest change, and that's what's so prevalent in this whole rollout. Energetically, I'm on a whole different type of time.\n\nYou can sense it. 'Crash' feels really rooted in self-expression and personal growth, and when you listen to it as a whole, it really does seem like an evolution story. Beyond just the genre and style, how do you feel the way that you've expressed your true self has shifted over the years?\n\nThank you! That's been the feedback I've gotten from pretty much everyone who's listened, and I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't this. I have realized the public's understanding of me and the general consensus for so long, and I also realized how multi-faceted I am to people.\n\nPeople get really confused when I express all the sides of my personality. They’re either, like, \"Okay, she makes really sweet love songs,\" or \"We've seen you be political, we've seen you come out, we've seen you be a family member.\" And then there's a lot of people who are, like, \"I feel like she's f—ing crazy. I've seen her in multiple relationships. I've seen her be angry. I've seen her get online and cuss people out.\"\n\nI want this next batch of music to feel like the most fiery parts of me. I want it to feel like the most present and energetic parts of me. I don't want anything to feel somber. I don't want anything to feel reminiscent. I think a lot of my albums in the past have been me looking back, and sitting in that feeling and detailing it. I just wanted [this album] to feel right here, right now, which is why the title came about. A crash isn't anything from the past. It isn't the anxiety of what's about to happen. It's the height of the moment. It's right now.\n\nThat’s unfortunately a story you hear too often about artists of color — that essentialization, where you can only be seen as one thing. R&B often gets hit with those same issues. Throughout your career you’ve stood up to those expectations, and \"Better Not\" on this album is such a good example of that. It’s a left turn, a stylistic contrast and an open conversation with the listener. You cleverly fuse that intentionality with a voice that’s stronger than ever.\n\nIn the past, I have had moments where I would make the song and [start recording], and there would be so many versions of each song on different microphones, recorded in different places.\n\n\"Let me try vocal production. Let me try to go back and work with this version again.\" I went back and did vocal production with Oak Felder, who did all the vocal production on SweetSexySavage. When I come back to some of my favorite vocal production moments, it was moments like \"Distraction\" or \"Advice\" or \"Escape\" — songs on my very first album — and I wanted to get that feeling again. Where it's lush where it needs to be, but also that I really mean what I'm saying.\n\nThat started with the approach in the songwriting. Once I had the songs and I had to go back and deliver them, I had enough time to listen and listen, to learn the songs and identify with them. We would make music all day and then go out, and we would be in this sprinter van on the way to going out, and, like, bang, the songs we just made, the energy was just different. It allowed me to be present in a different way where my voice is able to show up like that.\n\nLearn more: R&B Isn't Dead: Listen To 51 Songs By Summer Walker, Josh Levi & More Artists Who Are Pushing The Genre Forward\n\nWhich again ties perfectly to crashing into the present. As someone from South Africa, I love that the other guests that you included represent different cultural viewpoints. You worked with Young Miko from Puerto Rico, Omah Lay from Nigeria. Having that musical dialogue is so powerful.\n\nWe had so many conversations about how America's in the backseat often when it comes to music. We have our moments, and it's fantastic, like Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter. There's a culture that is super American, that is Black, that historically needs to be dived into. It needs to be shown that we do have something here.\n\nSo many people that don't speak Spanish bang Bad Bunny all day. Amapiano’s taking over; Tyla’s going up. It's really not here. So that wasn't a conscious choice. It's just what we've all been listening to, what we've been loving.\n\nRead more: 11 Women Pushing Amapiano To Global Heights: Uncle Waffles, Nkosazana Daughter, & More\n\nSpeaking of guests, I wanted to ask about your daughter, whose voice is on \"Deep.\" Was she just in the studio and you got her singing?\n\nSo those vocals on that, that’s actually my little sister and my goddaughter. And [my daughter] was in the room and she started singing along. She has perfect pitch; she's always freestyling or singing or making something up.\n\nI was like, \"You want to just go sing on it?\" What's on there is her first take. Literally. She did it the first time, all the way through, perfectly. I was like, \"Well, that's it, guys. I can retire.\"\n\nThat track is so lush. It feels so alive. Were you working with a full band?\n\n[Producer] Jack Rochon, who I did a lot of the music with, he just is a freaking genius music whiz. Honestly, he's one of the most humble people that I know, and deserves credit for how amazing a lot of this album is.\n\nTalking about touchstones, there's a Prince energy to the title track. Did you have any new inspirations or influences for this record?\n\nThank you! My main focus for this album came from going on tour for my last one and making such a pretty, sweet, intimate album, and then playing some of the biggest venues of my career. At some point I had to rearrange the setlist to add in a lot of the album before that one, because it was just more energy on the stage. By week two of tour, the setlist had completely changed. I knew that I was playing venues on this next tour that I've dreamt about, places that I can't fathom that I'm playing, like Barclays Center.\n\nI do a lot of things for, like, my inner child, and this is such a move for my inner child. Like, You're about to go play Barclays. Do you want to look back and say, ‘I rocked out and played Barclays’? I'm a person who headbangs on stage. I stage dive. I wanted to create an album that would ring through a venue like that. I want people to be engaged again. I'm not looking for the lighters and the somber, holding each other — which will occur regardless, because it's a me show.\n\nBut I really wanted people to be in their bodies, and their heart’s exploding and the ground’s shaking. So that's what we accomplished. I wanted to have fun. This album is so fun to me. It’s a place of fire in my heart.\n\nIt took me a second to get the word play on \"Eight.\" I loved the track, and then suddenly I was like, 'Oh… I knew there was something raunchy going on here.'\n\n[*Laughs.*] \"Eight\" was super fun, and shoutout to the boys that I did it with, because they made it everything for me.\n\nI didn't come up with the wordplay. My boys did. Like, \"This is how you talk!\" I was like, \"It is! This is perfect.\" Once I got in to fix things, add things, add my own spin, and finish writing, my favorite part was that it sounds like a Brandy song. She's my favorite.\n\nI also wanted to ask about the Nina Sky sample on \"After Hours.\"\n\nThat was mine. I was like, \"What can we flip that when it comes on, my generation loses their mind?\" And for me, every single time that Nina Sky comes on in the club, everybody's like \"Woo!\" And then you see how many songs were made from that same sample, and they're all songs that make us lose our minds.\n\nI went into the room with the producers, and I was like, \"So, I want to flip this, but I want you to make it to where it doesn't become one of those where the whole thing is just a sample.\"\n\nSimilarly, \"Lose My Wife\" balances breeziness with high emotional stakes. Is finding a balance like that just natural for someone so capable of juxtaposition?\n\nThe second that we established that [the record] felt like Vegas, I knew what components were missing from the energy of how I feel the second my car crosses the line into the city of Las Vegas. I knew I was missing that feeling of the next morning when you realize you went on this high and you come down. I wanted to create these scenarios that weren't necessarily applicable to me, but captured that emotion. I've been there before, and I want people to be like, Damn, I've been there before. I know this feeling.\n\nI recorded that song at 4 in the morning with a sinus infection. The second that we finished it, everybody was like, \"You can never re-sing that. Don't try to make another version, you're not gonna be able to sound like that again.\" All the chatter in the background of that song is really everybody who was in the studio that stayed up to just hang out. We had the tequila out, it was perfect. That was probably one of my favorite moments of making the album."
