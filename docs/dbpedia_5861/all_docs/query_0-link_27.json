        "text": "Dust Commander’s remains, which had been located in an unmarked grave, were given a more fitting resting place\n\n(Courtesy of John Asher via Twitter)\n\nDust Commander, the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner who died nearly 22 years ago,\n\nwas re-interred at the Derby Museum’s garden in a Monday morning ceremony.\n\nHis Derby-winning connections — trainer Don Combs, jockey Mike Manganello\n\nand owner Verna Lehmann — were in attendance as the son of Bold Commander was\n\ngiven a fitting tribute in his new resting place.\n\nDust Commander’s remains had been buried in an unmarked location on a Paris,\n\nKentucky, farm that later changed ownership and the property was divided.\n\nFor many years, the Lehmann family has been searching for Dust Commander’s\n\nburial site.\n\nHardy Dungan, the husband of Verna Lehmann’s granddaughter, is a local\n\nveterinarian and forensic scientist who has been assisting Lehmann in her quest.\n\nDr. Hardy and Cristal Dungan are the co-founders of the newly-organized\n\nThoroughbred Breeders Museum, Inc. (TBM) in Paris, Kentucky.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby Museum and the Thoroughbred Breeders Museum, in a joint\n\ncollaborative effort, located Dust Commander’s grave. The family uncovered his\n\nremains on Friday at Woodline Farm.\n\nBoth museums worked with Sparks Enterprise landscaping to exhume and\n\ntransport his remains. The skeleton of Dust Commander was placed in a\n\nhandcrafted box and brought to the Kentucky Derby Museum."
