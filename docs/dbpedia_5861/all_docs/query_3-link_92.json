        "text": "The Derby Festival Princesses have been a part of the Louisville Derby season for more than 65 years, but as the newest coterie tells our Tabnie Dozier, they are more than pretty faces. These are accomplished women seeking to engage the community and elevate future generations of girls.\n\nWritten by Tabnie Dozier | Photographed on location at Angel’s Envy Distillery by Kylene White\n\n“You define the crown; you don’t let the crown define you,” Mahshad Taheri explains. “And as a first-generation, Iranian-immigrant college student, this program gives me the opportunity to be a role model for those of Middle Eastern and African descent.”\n\nMashhad is one of five women selected this year to wear the tiaras and work the schedule of the Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Court of princesses. It is a role steeped in tradition and, yes, a little pageantry, but the glamour of the title and the complimentary wardrobes that each princess receives (from Dillard’s) shouldn’t distract from the focus on community service. Public outreach is, and always has been, at the core of the Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Court. The first princess was crowned in 1957, the second year of the festival. Her name was Jacklyn Love Marxer, a teacher at Mill Creek Elementary, who was sponsored by Dixie Highway Junior Chamber of Commerce. Her first official appearance was at the “And They’re Off” luncheon. The role has evolved over the years, with princesses becoming more local ambassadors than the social hostesses they were viewed as in the early years. Candidates are put through a rigorous interview process and those who make it to the royal court must maintain a 3.0 GPA, be exceptionally poised and demonstrate involvement within their college campuses and the community at large.\n\nWhile many of the women who wear the crown this year are Kentucky natives, Mahshad’s family moved from Iran to Louisville in 2014 and she has a unique take on the significance of the inclusive spirit of the Kentucky Derby Festival events. The Pegasus Parade quickly turned into a local event that she looked forward to attending annually, and she is excited to be able to have an official part in its pageantry. “It’s incredible to be able to be there, representing this local tradition as an immigrant,” she says. “It makes me feel like I have truly become part of this community. For me, this role of being a princess means being a bold, strong woman who uses her gifts, talents, and intelligence to improve the quality of other’s lives. It means trying your best at everything you do, never giving up, being true to yourself and being honest with others. It is truly humbling.”\n\nOne of her first events as a princess this year truly put that testament into action. The 21-year-old University of Louisville senior met some students of Afghanistan descent who spoke her native Farsi language. Mahshad knows what it was like to move to a foreign country and be teased for having a thick accent. She says she’s honored to be a princess of Color, adding, “I would tell little Mahshad and other young girls, ‘Don’t give up. Keep your grades up and get involved in the community.’ That’s the one thing I wish I would’ve done sooner.”\n\nAll of the young women selected as members of the royal court have demonstrated dedication to their local community and to serving and supporting others. But as 21-year-old University of Kentucky junior Mallory Hudson laments, many mistakenly focus on looks, rather than on the depth of knowledge and ambition that these women possess: “I encourage people to see past the pretty, sparkly crown and get to know us as people, because we really are community ambassadors who want to connect, who want to hear your stories and who want to promote the amazing things that the KDF is doing.”\n\nMallory loves that the program doesn’t foster competition between the princesses but, instead, promotes a spirit of unity and community. “We’re all community role models, we all have amazing accomplishments that we’re proud of and we all want to get out in the Louisville community and the Kentucky community and make a difference,” she says. “So, the pretty princess is a stereotype that I’d like to smash about the Kentucky Derby Festival Royal Court. We are here to uplift each other and we’re so excited to be empowered by one another and we hope to pass that empowerment to others in the community as well.”\n\nTwenty-one-year old Hayley Benson, a University of Louisville junior, has dreamed of being on the court since she was 17. “I don’t do pageants; that was never my intent,” she says. “It’s really about women wanting to make a change.” She says she was drawn to the program when she saw how past princesses presented themselves in public. “What really got me in was my speaking about my passion for medicine,” she says. “I spoke about how not many (women) STEM majors are being seen and how I’m also an advocate for other young girls who are like me and I want to show them that you can be smart and that you belong in these spaces. I love the fact that I’m a Black woman in STEM and that I’m pursuing a higher education in medicine and that I am an advocate for women of color, especially when it comes to maternal health.”\n\n“We, as a group, are so much more than the crowns that you see in public,” Mallory adds. Fellow princess Hayley agrees, “It wasn’t easy. I didn’t just wake up out of bed confident enough to speak in front of these judges and show my real self. So, I would just tell any younger girl that you can really put your mind to anything and accomplish anything as long as you consistently work towards it.”\n\nLauren Carter, a 22-year-old University of Kentucky Marketing and Management senior, is also the founder of Stop Throwing Stones: A Kindness Movement, which has spread stones painted with positive notes throughout Lexington and Louisville. “I’m so honored to be on such a diverse court of women this year,” she says. What she loves about the kindness movement she created is the fact that it touches so many lives in unexpected ways: “People can pick up the stones, read them, know that they’re worthy, know that they don’t have to give up and they can take it with them or put it back for someone else to view.” She knows the critical benefits of spreading joy all too well, as she reveals her past struggles, “I was subject to cyber-bullying growing up,” she says. “I was a chubbier child, so I was made fun of. It is not acceptable and that’s something I want somebody else to know – that you can get through it, because I did.”\n\nValerie Tran explains that the focus on finding women of substance starts early on in the application process. “When you’re filling out the application and going through the interview process, that’s what it’s all focused around: What do you stand for? How do you serve your community? And I’m really big on serving under-represented communities on campus and in the city of Louisville.” A 22-year-old senior at UofL, Valerie is the co-founder of the Homeland Project, a non-profit on campus that is focused on supporting local immigrants.\n\nValerie’s parents left Vietnam for Louisville before she and her younger brother were born. “I’m so grateful that they sacrificed so much and really built something out of nothing,” she says. “They’d tell me stories of all the struggles they had to endure coming over here. You don’t know the language. You’re basically living in poverty, living in community centers.” The biggest barrier when moving across the globe is often language, hence her passion surrounding her non-profit. “We have student volunteers and they talk to the immigrant community and help them learn English because learning English formally and learning to speak conversationally is so different,” she explains.\n\nTo say she is honored to represent Asian Americans and her Vietnamese roots just scratches the surface of her joy. “I remember when we went public with this year’s royal court, so many people from my community – the Vietnamese community – were commenting and they were saying that so many young girls are going to look up to you and it just makes me feel so emotional,” she says. “It feels so surreal for me to finally be in that position. I am very proud.”\n\n“It’s just so special to be connected to a legacy now and forever,” adds Mallory. Future doctor Hayley adds, “Since I’m choosing a career in medicine, I’m dedicating myself to becoming a life-long learner and for this royal court, I feel the same. I feel as though I’m learning to become a leader and to really become more open-minded and receive more points of view from the Bluegrass State.”\n\nMahshad is channeling her spiritual beliefs, having lost her dad two years ago to carbon monoxide poisoning while he was on a visit to Iran. “I’m pre-dental and he was a dentist back home, so I feel like now it means even more,” she says. “It feels like I can remember him through that. I think he would be proud of what I have accomplished.”\n\nAll five of the women consider this role an honor and an opportunity to represent their state in their own unique way. “I definitely feel that I’m a mentor and an ambassador for the Commonwealth,” says Lauren. “I am really trying to keep my focus on that throughout this experience.” Each of them aspires to modernize the role that does include wearing a glittering tiara but also relies on their intelligence, poise and professionalism to navigate a full spectrum of events that involves meeting people ranging from visiting dignitaries to elementary school students. Says Mallory, “My hope is that if we do our jobs well, people can start to see past the crowns and see the hard work, determination and achievements it took to earn them.”\n\n—\n\nIf you want to know more: Leading up to their appearance at Churchill Downs on Derby Day, these ladies have a packed schedule of 70-plus events including Thunder Over Louisville, Tour de Lou and the annual Fillies Derby Ball to name a few.
