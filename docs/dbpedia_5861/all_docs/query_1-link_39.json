        "text": "Golf's most famous fictional greenskeeper is coming to the Outback Steakhouse Pro-Am in two weeks. Actor and comedian Bill Murray, who played Carl Spackler in Caddyshack, will compete in the Champions Tour event at the TPC of Tampa Bay, Feb. 16-18. Murray, an avid golfer who has been prominent on the pro-am circuit, is expected to play with Tour player Scott Simpson, his longtime partner at the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, where the two will compete next week.\n\nThe Outback tournament puts pros with amateurs for the first two rounds, with the top 16 teams advancing to the final round, when all of the pros compete for the title. Other celebrities who have committed are Huey Lewis, Joe Theismann, Derrick Brooks, Ronde Barber, Jim Courier and Ray Knight. For more information, see Ticket Window on page 2C.\n\nHORSE RACING\n\nBarbaro may lie in rest at Derby site\n\nBarbaro's final resting place could be just a few hundred yards from the scene of his greatest triumph in the Kentucky Derby. Officials at the Kentucky Derby Museum, located on the grounds of Churchill Downs, said they would be \"honored'' if Barbaro was buried in a garden on the grounds. \"We feel like we're bringing horses back to be honored,\" said Lynn Ashton, executive director of the museum. The gravesites of Derby winners Sunny's Halo (1983), Carry Back (1961), Swaps (1955) and Brokers Tip (1933) are located at the museum. Owners Gretchen and Roy Jackson said a decision on Barbaro's burial site had not been made.\n\nHIGH SCHOOLS\n\nMarve to Miami?\n\nPlant quarterback Robert Marve is expected to commit to the University of Miami during a news conference at 4 p.m. today at the football field house. \"I'm looking for a team that really believes in me,\" Marve told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. \"I think I've found that.\" Marve, who led Plant to a state title, backed off an oral commitment to Alabama after Mike Shula was fired in November. Marve was noncommital when reached Tuesday evening.\n\nTimes staff writer\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\n\"When I came to school, it wasn't South Beach then. You didn't come out here unless you were lost or you were looking for cocaine.\"\n\nNFL player Warren Sapp, on si.com, talking about his favorite hangout.\n\nSUPER BOWL XLI\n\nSunday - 6 p.m. - Ch. 10 - Dolphin Stadium, Miami - Line: Colts by 7\n\ntampabay.com\n\nRecruiting central\n\nCheck out videos of some of the Tampa Bay area's top college football prospects on our new recruiting page, links.tampabay.com."
