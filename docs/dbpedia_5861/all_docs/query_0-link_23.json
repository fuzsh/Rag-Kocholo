        "text": "That's progress! In 1954 Roger Bannister became the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. His time -- 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. When Bannister ran his historic race, I love how the stadium announcer added drama to the event by teasing the crowd by delaying his announcement of Bannister's race time for as long as possible: \"Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event nine, the one mile: first, number forty one, R. G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges, Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting and track record, and which‚Äîsubject to ratification‚Äîwill be a new English Native, British National, All-Comers, European, British Empire and World Record. The time was three...\" The roar of the crowd drowned out the rest of the announcement! Interestingly, after all those years of runners attempting to run a sub four minute mile, Bannister's record stood for only 46 days before being broken by a runner named John Landy. But I think the most interesting part of the four minute mile story is that in 2023, there were 165 NCAA runners who ran sub four minute miles. That's progress! Business is the same as the runner's story. We need to learn more, be more efficient, and continue to do better, and be better, than we were the year before. And sometimes we need someone to show us what is possible! #leadership #progress\n\nIt is a struggle. And COVID certainly didn't help, but rather slowed everything down. But I am finally starting to see that we are no longer this bunch of weirdos approaching the business side of a sports club in a totally different way than anyone else. I see more and more signs that clubs are starting to realise that their premium customers and business partners are not just fans with more money. They are a totally different segment that should be catered for differently. They have a different customer journey and different touch points. they have totally different expectations. If you want to optimise your dealings with this segment, redesigning your processes and IT infrastructure is not just an option. It is a must. Sometimes you have to realise that the path you took so many years ago is no longer heading in the direction you had in mind. It is never too late to take a different path, but it becomes more and more difficult the longer you wait.... Thanks Gordon Kaye to shine some light on the challenges and frustrations and for highlighting that sometimes you just have to take 1 step back to take a leap forward!\n\nEver wondered what it takes to craft a rugby player into an exceptional defender?
