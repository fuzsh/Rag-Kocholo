        "text": "Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode A.P. Indy and 5,000 other winners, and Tom Kelly, who trained 65 stakes winners, were inducted into racing's Hall of Fame today along with three legendary horses of the past: Cavalcade, Personal Ensign and Alysheba.\n\nIt was a day when memories were revived and races rerun before a crowd of 2,000 racing officials and tourists who filled a huge tent next to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. It is a stately brick building across Union Avenue from the 126-year-old Saratoga Race Course, and during the last 38 years the hall has become the home of racing history with niches honoring 69 jockeys, 66 trainers and 138 horses.\n\nDelahoussaye, who is 41, was introduced for the award by his fellow jockey Chris McCarron, who said: \"I've been riding against him every day since 1979, and he's a fierce competitor.\" But Delahoussaye was inducted as \"the patient jockey\" from Louisiana who rode more than 30,000 mounts in 26 years, with 5,000 winners and more than $119 million in purses. He was also the fourth jockey in history to win the Kentucky Derby two years in a row: in 1982 on Gato del Sol and in 1983 on Sunny's Halo. Deft Touch With Shippers\n\n\"And if A.P. Indy hadn't got hurt last year,\" he said today, \"you would have seen another Kentucky Derby winner. I also think you would have seen another Triple Crown winner.\"\n\nKelly, who is 74 years old, won two Purple Hearts during World War II and then became a horse trainer in 1945. Operating mainly between New York and Florida, he gained a reputation for shipping horses from their home base to win major races at other tracks. He saddled 65 stakes winners who won a total of 175 races, and he is now the trainer for the Blue Goose Stable.\n\nHe has three sons -- Tim, Pat and Larry -- who followed him into racing and who now also train horses. And he is the brother and the uncle to several more trainers, all of whom surrounded him on what Kelly called \"the happiest day of my life.\" Twice a Champion\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
