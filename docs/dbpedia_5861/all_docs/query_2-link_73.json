        "text": "Not-so-FAQ’s about Jeff:\n\nWhere are you from?\n\n* In chronological order: California, Washington, Virginia, Louisiana\n\nWhat courses have you taught?\n\n* English I, AP Language and Composition, Technical Writing, Civics, English III.\n\nWhat were you doing before working in education?\n\n* I worked as an A&R rep for a record label for a good part of a decade and spent a couple years working as a project manager for a company that composed music for national advertising campaigns. Lots of writing. Lots of reading. Lots of communicating.\n\nWhy New Harmony?\n\n* New Harmony’s approach to education resonates with me on a deep level, and I am inspired by the school’s innovation and fearlessness in creating authentic learning opportunities for students.\n\nAre there any NHH projects that you are particularly proud of?\n\n* Yes! Plug time. Check out the New Harmony High Podcast here and here — it’s one of my favorite things ever. Also, check out the book of dystopian flash fiction stories that our students published in partnership with 826 New Orleans here — it’s called Once Upon a Time in a City Called New Orleans. It is also one of my favorite things ever.\n\nAre there any other books you’ve been thinking about a lot lately?\n\n* In no particular order: Teaching a Stone to Talk – Dillard, Salvage the Bones – Ward, Parable of the Sower – Butler, East of Eden – Steinbeck, The River Why – Duncan, Gilead – Robinson, and Infinite Jest – Wallace. I would love to talk to you at length about all of these books.\n\nWhat are you interested in?\n\n* Family, birding, reading, music, backpacking, the natural world, podcasts, field recordings, yard beautification, talking to Fernando about insects, and trying to fix things around the house (see: usually unsuccessfully).\n\nAre there any birds you’ve been thinking about a lot lately?\n\n* Actually, yes! In alphabetical order: Belted Kingfishers, California Quail, Harpy Eagles, Ivory-Billed Woodpeckers (or lack thereof), Loggerhead Shrike, Painted Buntings, and Roseate Spoonbills.\n\nDid you interview yourself for this bio?\n\n* Maybe.\n\nDespite being a Louisiana licensed attorney, she prefers that environmental education life. Ms. Cifuentes earned her J.D. from LSU, and her B.S. in Environmental Economics and Policy from UC, Berkeley where she lived in housing cooperatives and learned valuable home maintenance skills. Ms. Cifuentes is all about exposing her students to elements of the natural world and fostering better stewards. A confirmed urbanite, she enjoys finding the right balance between natural and built environments.\n\nWhen not conducting wild scientific experiments, Ms. Cifuentes can be found cuddling with canines or at Lowes looking for items to improve her nearly 200 year old Creole Cottage or if it’s Friday night at the Saenger for a musical theater performance, finally!"
