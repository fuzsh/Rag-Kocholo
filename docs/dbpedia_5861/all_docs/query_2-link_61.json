        "text": "GH RECAP THURSDAY, AUGUST 8th\n\nAt General Hospital, Kristina dreams about holding her baby girl. She wakes up from the dream, feels her belly, and begins to cry. Alexis comes in, and Kristina tells her mom about her dream. She sobs that the only way she‚Äôll ever get to see or hold her baby is in her dreams.\n\nFelicia stops by and tells Kristina and Alexis how sorry she is for them and their family. As a patient advocate, she wants to offer therapy, grief counseling, group sessions, or anything else Kristina might need. Felicia knows from experience that there is no timeline for handling grief, but leaning on family helps.\n\nFelicia leaves, and Alexis asks Kristina what she can do for her. Kristina doesn‚Äôt know how to feel now that her baby is gone. She realizes that‚Äôs the first time she said, ‚Äùmy baby‚Äù, but she was her mother. Kristina cries that she was the only one who truly knew her, she knew what every kick meant, and when she did or didn‚Äôt like something she ate. She sobs that she was real and she was my baby. Kristina breaks down.\n\nIn the hall, Portia is glad Trina came to see her and says they‚Äôll visit this conversation later. Trina goes to walk away when suddenly an officer wheels Heather out of the elevator. Heather sees Trina and calls her name, but Portia runs over and warns Heather to stay away from her daughter. Heather only wanted to apologize. Portia says she is only here for a follow-up, and she will do whatever it takes to keep her off the streets. She asks the officer to take Heather to her room.\n\nWhen Heather is wheeled off, Trina asks her mother, ‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù Portia says her only concern is protecting her. Trina tells her mom that Heather is handcuffed and escorted by a guard, so she can‚Äôt do anything. Trina says her mom can‚Äôt afford to lose it on a patient as co-chief of staff, even if it‚Äôs Heather. Portia says she is glad that Laura backed off, but she won‚Äôt let some lawyer swoop in and make a name for themselves by putting Heather back on the street. Trina begs her mom to let this go. Portia says if she wants to help, then stay away from Heather.\n\nScott informs the guard outside of Heather‚Äôs room that he is her attorney and bullies his way in. Heather tells Scott it‚Äôs always good to see him, but they both know he‚Äôs not her attorney. He chirps, ‚ÄúNot yet!‚Äù He admits he did some research, that this cobalt poisoning is real, and that she got a bum sentence. He knows she did wild things back in her day, but she was never serial killer crazy. He says she didn‚Äôt accidentally give herself cobalt poisoning like she did LSD, and she wasn‚Äôt in her right mind when she killed those people. He wants to help her, and she asks why. He says they are family as they share Franco. Heather can‚Äôt believe he played the dead son card and wants to know what is in this for him.\n\nScott states the company that made her implant has deep pockets, so they should sue them. Heather asks what good money will do in prison. He says that‚Äôs why they demand a new trial. He says if she‚Äôs acquitted, then she‚Äôll be free and have a big fat bank account. He notes she still has life left in her, so doesn‚Äôt she want to spend it with her grandson? He paints her as the victim of this corporation, and he can see in her eyes that she‚Äôs interested. He asks her to let him get her out, and then they‚Äôll go after a big piece of corporate pie. She agrees to think about it.\n\nIn Donna‚Äôs room, she says her throat hurts and wants a popsicle. She asks her parents if she‚Äôs in trouble for taking Daddy‚Äôs vitamins. They tell her she‚Äôs not, but she‚Äôs not to take anyone else‚Äôs medication or anything medicine unless they give it to her.\n\nDonna asks if she can go home. Carly says they‚Äôll be going home soon, but explains that Kristina is here, so her dad is going to stay. Donna thinks they should get Kristina a popsicle, or two, one for her and one for the baby. Carly gives Sonny a look.\n\nLater, Donna, Carly and Sonny are up and headed toward the elevator when Jason steps out. Jason offers them a ride home, but Carly asks Jason to stay with Sonny, as she can take Donna home.\n\nSonny tells Jason that he and Carly knew what was wrong with him the whole time, and he wishes he had listened. Jason says his instincts kicked in, and he‚Äôs much better now, he can see it in his eyes. Sonny says he is, but he wants to know who switched his meds. Jason shares the photos of Ava with Sonny, which appear to show her pushing Kristina out the window. Sonny assumes Ava is the one who switched his meds, so Jason asks what he wants him to do. Sonny tells him to visit Ava and see if she has anything to say. Jason understands and departs.\n\nSonny soon finds Alexis outside of Kristina‚Äôs room. Alexis says Kristina is devastated, so they must be their best for her. He knows he‚Äôs been all over the place lately, but he‚Äôs getting help. Sonny tells Alexis that Ava is responsible for this, and he has proof. He tells her about the photos. Alexis fumes, asks Sonny to care for Kristina, and steps out for air.\n\nBy the nurses‚Äô station, Felicia overhears Portia telling a nurse she wants to get Heather out of there as soon as possible. Felicia confronts her and thinks that rushing care is not in the best interest of the patient. Portia says she gives all patients proper care and points out that she doubts Felicia would have advocated for Ryan when he was a patient here. She also reminds Felicia that she is co-chief of staff and walks away.\n\nBack in Heather‚Äôs room, Scott is gone, and she‚Äôs trying to sleep when the guard tells her she has another visitor. She‚Äôs surprised when Trina walks in. Trina says she is here to hear what Heather has to say. Heather tells her that she‚Äôs sorry, which she knows doesn‚Äôt matter to her because people are dead. However, having this hip replaced made her wake up from a nightmare. Now, though, she‚Äôs found herself in another nightmare as she has to live with what she did and that people are dead.\n\nTrina says she has heard her apology and hopes her no longer being homicidal sticks. She goes to leave, but Heather stops her. She again cries that she is sorry for what she did to her, and also what Esme did to her. She says that Ryan exploited Esme and her love for Spencer. Trina stops her and states Esme wasn‚Äôt in love with Spencer, she used him. Trina won‚Äôt forgive Esme or Heather. Heather asks why she came to see her. Trina states she won‚Äôt let her and Esme have power over her anymore. However, she wants Heather to have her day in court, and she prays that justice will be served and that no one will be hurt by her again. Heather says she also prays she doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone again. Trina tells her they all deserve some peace and walks out. Heather breaks down.\n\nScott runs into Alexis in the hall and says he heard about Kristina. He asks if she‚Äôs okay. Alexis asks if he wants to know or his murderous client. She lets him know that Kristina is devastated and broken over the loss of her child. Scott switches the subject and says while he has her, he thought that she might want to work with him on Heather‚Äôs case. Alexis blurts out, ‚ÄúAre you insane? Why would you ask me that now? There is no way in hell I‚Äôd help Heather Webber!‚Äù She storms off.\n\nIn her cell, Ava calls for a guard, as she wants to call Agent John Cates. She gets no answer.\n\nCates is summoned to Anna‚Äôs office and asks what she wants. Anna asks what the nature of his relationship with Ava Jerome is. He states she is a friend and that his personal life is none of her business. Anna says it is when a crime has been committed. She fills him in on Ava pushing a pregnant Kristina out the window and that her baby didn‚Äôt survive.\n\nCates says he has nothing else to say. Anna wonders if he doesn‚Äôt care about this innocent life because it‚Äôs Sonny‚Äôs grandchild. He calls this a tragedy, but he still has no comment. She speculates he sees Ava as an ally in taking Sonny down. She informs him that the list of people who have wrecked their lives and careers trying to jail Sonny is very long, and he‚Äôs adding his name to it. Cates tells Anna she should be helping him, not fighting him, but he won‚Äôt let her stop him from taking Sonny down.\n\nCates goes down to holding to visit Ava and asks if she is responsible for Kristina going through the window. Ava swears it was an accident and that Kristina tripped. However, that won‚Äôt stop everyone from blaming her. Ava says Sonny is coming for her, and maybe him too. She informs him that Kristina tripped over his duffle bag. Ava reveals she hid it, but the police found it. She also knows it will only get worse when Sonny realizes he‚Äôs been on placebos.\n\nAva informs Cates that Sonny went to see Kevin, and he found an issue with his meds. Kevin revealed this when he came to check on her. She says someone paid the pharmacist to switch his meds, and he wouldn‚Äôt tell her who it was. She knows Sonny will go after him, so she begs Cates to find the pharmacist and warn him to run. Cates asks why if she has nothing to hide. Ava cries she went to his office several times, and Sonny will assume she put him up to this. Cates promises that he won‚Äôt let Sonny hurt her. He says Sonny‚Äôs days of tormenting people are about to come to an end. He storms out.\n\nLater, Jason shows up to see Ava. She assumes he‚Äôs back working with Sonny and is here to kill her. She swears that what happened with Kristina was an accident, and she wouldn‚Äôt harm Kristina, let alone push her through her hotel room window. Jason says they have proof she did. Ava knows about the photos and states that photos can be faked. She calls Sonny erratic and says he‚Äôll do anything to get rid of her. Jason reveals they know about the placebos and accuses her of being the one who switched Sonny‚Äôs meds out, just as she did with Morgan.\n\nAva admits she found out the meds were switched out, but it wasn‚Äôt her. She says Sonny has a very powerful enemy who knows his weaknesses. Jason wants a name. She says they both know how this works, she‚Äôs expendable the minute she hands over a name. That name is the only thing that will keep her alive.\n\nBack up in her office, Anna gets a call from Carly. Carly asks her to come to her house and she needs to report a crime.\n\nAnna soon arrives at Carly‚Äôs. Carly fills her in on what happened with Donna and that it turned out the pills she swallowed were placebos. Anna asks if Sonny knows. Carly says he does, and Carly believes he‚Äôs been taking placebos since New Year‚Äôs Eve. Anna notes that explains his erratic behavior but doesn‚Äôt excuse what he‚Äôs done. Carly says she believes Ava tampered with the pills as she did the same thing to Morgan. Anna says there was never proof legally of what Ava did, and it doesn‚Äôt prove Ava did this to Sonny either. Carly says Ava lived with Sonny for months, she had access to Sonny‚Äôs meds, and was keeping him from his own family. Anna asks how much Sonny knows about this because right now, the life in danger could be Ava‚Äôs.\n\nBack at the hospital, Sonny checks on a sleeping Kristina and kisses her forehead. When she wakes up, he apologizes and asks if there is anything he can do for her. She says, ‚ÄúMake Ava pay.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, Cates bursts into the pharmacist‚Äôs office and identifies himself. He tells the man, ‚ÄúYou need to come with me.‚Äù\n\nNext on General Hospital,\n\nDrew has good news for someone.\n\nLaura gives Heather her word.\n\nKevin tells Alexis that she can‚Äôt do it all alone.\n\nMichael meets with Nina and wants to show his appreciation for all she‚Äôs done for Willow.\n\nKristina asks Sonny when Ava will finally pay for all she‚Äôs done."
