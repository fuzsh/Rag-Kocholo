Miller III Department of Physics & Astronomy. Before coming to JHU, I was a Carnegie-Princeton Fellow at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science and the Astrophysical Sciences Department of Princeton University, a Kavli Fellow at the MIT Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, and a senior data scientist at LinkedIn.\n\nI attended the Pennsylvania State University as an undergraduate where I studied mathematics and astronomy and astrophysics in the Eberly College of Science and Schreyer Honors College. I picked up a master's degree from Stanford University in a program called Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics (now called ICME) with a concentration in statistics. While there, I worked at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology. I earned my PhD from the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department at UC Santa Cruz, where I studied halo substructure and Milky Way formation as well as exoplanets and planet formation. I've also worked at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory and at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\nI was born and raised in the 47th least-sunny, 3rd rainiest, and 2nd snowiest city in the continental US -- Erie, Pennsylvania -- where I attended McDowell High School. After growing up with this and living in New England & Baltimore, I look back fondly on my time in sunny California.\n\nI can't complain, but sometimes I still do. Life's been good to me so far..."
