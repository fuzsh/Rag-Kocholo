        "text": "About Joe Hirsch\n\nDuring a career that carried him from the eras of Citation and Native Dancer to the dawn of the 21st century, Joe Hirsch received every conceivable honor that could have been bestowed upon someone who considered himself merely lucky to be able to write about the sport he loved.\n\nA New Yorker by birth, Hirsch made his mark as both a tireless reporter of thoroughbred racing for Daily Racing Form and a peerless ambassador of the game. His signature work occurred each spring when he followed the quest for the American classics in his “Derby Doings” for the Form, but beyond that the entire racing world was his oyster. He was instrumental in the creation of the Arlington Million in 1981, a midsummer classic for older runners that reached out to the best stables of Europe. Likewise, Hirsch was there at the dawn of the Japan Cup, the Breeders’ Cup, and the Dubai World Cup, stamping each event with the imprimatur of his formidable reputation.\n\nA grateful racing industry gave Hirsch both an Eclipse Award for Outstanding Newspaper Writing (1978) and the Award of Merit (1992) for a lifetime of service. His British colleagues recognized Hirsch’s international reach with the Lord Derby Award from the Horserace Writers and Reporters Association of Great Britain (1981). Hirsch won the Big Sport of Turfdom Award (1983), The Jockey Club Medal (1989), and was the 1994 Honor Guest at the Thoroughbred Club of America’s testimonial dinner. The National Turf Writers Association, which was founded by Hirsch in 1959, honored him with the Walter Haight Award for excellence in turf writing (1984), the Joe Palmer Award for meritorious service to racing (1994), and the Mr. Fitz Award for typifying the spirit of horse racing (1998).\n\nThe Joe Hirsch Media Roll of Honor at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame is not the only institution that bears the imprint of Hirsch’s name. Press boxes at Saratoga Race Course and Churchill Downs have been named for him, along with the Joe Hirsch Breeders’ Cup Writing Award, the Joe Hirsch Scholarship of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, Joe Hirsch Turf Classic Invitational, and a major grass race run each fall at Belmont Park. Hirsch retired from Daily Racing Form in 2003 and died in 2009 in New York, at the age of 80.\n\nThe National Museum of Racing’s Joe Hirsch Media Roll of Honor was established in 2010 to recognize individuals whose careers have been dedicated to, or substantially involved in, writing about thoroughbred racing (non-fiction), and who distinguished themselves as journalists. The criteria has since been expanded to allow the inclusion of other forms of media.\n\nThe Honor Roll\n\nSteven Crist (2010)\n\nSteven Crist went from his Harvard graduating class of 1978 directly to work as a copy boy for the New York Times. Since pari-mutuel betting already was Crist’s passion, the leap in 1981 to the horse racing beat for the native New Yorker was only logical. Crist covered the cream of the sport’s races and personalities for the Times until 1990, when he left to help establish the Racing Times, a publication designed to challenge the primacy of the Daily Racing Form. The Racing Times made a mark but folded in less than a year upon the death of its publisher, financier Robert Maxwell. After a detour into racetrack management as a vice-president with the New York Racing Association, Crist became one of the principals in the 1998 purchase and virtual reinvention of the Racing Form as publisher, columnist, and eventually publisher emeritus. Crist is the author of five books, including \"The Horse Traders,\" \"Betting On Myself,\" and \"Offtrack,\" a collection of short stories. His numerous writing honors include the Walter Haight Award from the National Turf Writers Association and the Red Smith Kentucky Derby Writing Award. In January of 2017, Crist was presented an Eclipse Award of Merit for his lifetime achievements and contributions to racing.\n\nCharles Hatton (2010)\n\nCharles Hatton (1905 - 1975) was heralded far and wide as the first turfwriter whose prose elevated the daily coverage of horse racing to a lofty literary plane. Born in Indiana, Hatton worked for his hometown New Albany Ledger, the Louisville Courier-Journal, and The Blood-Horse magazine before joining The Morning Telegraph — forerunner to the Daily Racing Form — in early 1930. Hatton arrived at the New York-based publication just in time to cover the exploits of Bel Air Stable’s Gallant Fox, who swept the 1930 Preakness, Kentucky Derby, and Belmont Stakes in stylish fashion. Inspired by the feat, as well as the quality of Gallant Fox, Hatton took to print to urge the three-race series borrow from the British model and be dubbed an American “Triple Crown.” Although Hatton was best known for the Racing Form column he wrote until 1975, his most lasting impact may have come from the comprehensive “Year in Review” and “Profiles of Best Horses” he wrote annually for the American Racing Manual. In 1974, Hatton received a Special Eclipse Award for his contributions as a chronicler of thoroughbred racing.\n\nWilliam Nack (2010)\n\nIn an eclectic, colorful career that has spanned the eras of Secretariat to Zenyatta, William Nack (1941 - 2018) wrote about everything from politics and the environment to all manner of sporting endeavors. His kinship to thoroughbred racing began in his native Chicago, where he worked as a teenager for Hall of Fame trainer William Molter and laid hands upon Horse of the Year Round Table. After a tour with the Army and service in Vietnam, Nack went to work for Newsday, covering a variety of beats before landing the job as lead turf writer and, later, general sports columnist. In 1978, Nack joined the staff of Sports Illustrated as investigative reporter and feature writer. He won six Eclipse Awards for turf writing while at the magazine, and a seventh Eclipse as a freelancer for GQ after his retirement from Sports Illustrated, in 2001. Nack wrote three books, including a collection of selected works in \"My Turf: Horses, Boxers, Blood Money and the Sporting Life,\" and biographies of Secretariat and Ruffian that were made into feature films. Among Nack’s other honors are the Walter Haight Award from the National Turf Writers Association, the Alfred G. Vanderbilt Lifetime Achievement Award from Thoroughbred Charities of America, and the A.J. Liebling Award from the Boxing Writers Association of America.\n\nWalter “Red” Smith (2010)\n\nRed Smith (1905 - 1982), one of America’s preeminent sportswriters, was a Wisconsin native who worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel, the St. Louis Journal, and the Philadelphia Record before joining the New York Herald Tribune in 1945. The Herald Tribune folded in 1966, after which Smith found a prestigious home for his syndicated column with the New York Times. In 1976, Smith solidified his place in journalism history by becoming only the second sportswriter to win the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary. Although the entire world of sports was his beat, Smith held an abiding affinity for thoroughbred racing. The five collections of Smith’s finest columns are replete with racing stories, and horse racing returned the compliment, honoring Smith with an Eclipse Award for newspaper writing in 1973 and the Walter Haight Award for career excellence in 1977, not to mention the naming of a race at Belmont Park called the Red Smith Handicap. In his final column, filed for the Times shortly before his death, Smith tipped his love of racing once again by singling out Bill Shoemaker as one of the greatest athletes he’d ever met.\n\nRuss Harris (2011)\n\nRuss Harris (1923 - 2016) began his journalism career at the Canton Repository in his native Ohio following service in World War II. He became involved in turf writing and handicapping in 1957 at the Akron Beacon Journal, where he made his selections under the nom de plume Phil Dancer (an homage to his favorite horse, Native Dancer). Harris moved on to the Miami Herald and also worked summers for Daily Racing Form in Chicago, which led to stints as a official racing steward at Hawthorne, Arlington, and Washington Park. His next stop was the Philadelphia Inquirer, and then the New York Daily News, where Harris did double duty as a prolific racing writer as well as a popular public handicapper, including his greatest handicapping achievement on May 8, 1981, when he selected the winners of all nine races on the card at Belmont Park. Harris continued to put his opinions on the line through 2008, when he was the leading public handicapper during the Saratoga meet. In 2003, Harris was honored by his colleagues in the National Turf Writers and Association with the Walter Haight Award. Away from the track Harris spent time as a teacher, and in 1999, at age 75, he earned his Ph.D. from Lehigh University.\n\nJoe Palmer (2011)\n\nJoe Palmer (1904 - 1952) graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1927 and taught English composition and literature there from 1928 to 1932, then later at the University of Michigan before being hired as an associate editor at The BloodHorse. While at the publication, Palmer wrote Names in Pedigrees (1939) and was responsible for most of the work in Horses in the Blue Grass (1940) and The Thoroughbred Horses (1942). In addition, Palmer wrote the text for the 1944 through 1951 editions of the historically indispensible American Race Horses. In 1946, Palmer was hired as the racing writer for the New York Herald Tribune and became widely known for his syndicated column, “Views of the Turf.” During this period, Palmer also could be heard over the Columbia Broadcasting System as the radio network’s Turf Analyst. In 1953, a collection of Palmer’s columns was published under the title This Was Racing, edited by Red Smith, who wrote of his late colleague, “No man who wrote had more grace and charm.” The reverence in which Palmer was held by his peers is reflected in the naming of the Joe Palmer Award for Meritorious Service to Racing, which has been presented annually by the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters Association since 1964.\n\nJay Hovdey (2012)\n\nJay Hovdey, a native of California, is a graduate of Arizona State University who joined the Los Angeles office of the Daily Racing Form as an editor in 1976. During a subsequent freelance career his work appeared in Reader’s Digest, the New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times, and such thoroughbred racing publications as the Thoroughbred Times, the Horseman’s Journal, Spur, and Pacemaker International. After a period as national correspondent and columnist for the Racing Times and then The BloodHorse, Hovdey rejoined Daily Racing Form in 1998 as executive columnist. He is the author of four books on horse racing, including Whittingham: A Thoroughbred Racing Legend, Cigar: America’s Horse and Long Rein: Tales from the World of Horse Racing, and was a staff writer for the HBO dramatic racetrack series Luck. Hovdey has won five Eclipse Awards, Canada’s Sovereign Award, and is a two-time winner of both the David F. Woods Award for coverage of the Preakness Stakes and the Joe Hirsch Award for coverage of the Breeders’ Cup. In 1995, Hovdey was honored by the National Turf Writers Association with the Walter Haight Award for career excellence.\n\nWhitney Tower (2012)\n\nWhitney Tower (1923 - 1999) was a graduate of Harvard University who flew reconnaissance missions over North Africa during World War II before commencing a career in sportswriting with the Cincinnati Enquirer in 1948. He joined Sports Illustrated in 1954 as its lead writer on thoroughbred racing coverage and turf editor, where he teamed with the legendary jockey Eddie Arcaro on the seminal five-part series, “The Art of Race Riding,” published in 1957. In 1976, Tower left Sports Illustrated to help establish the high-end sports magazine Classic. He served as both racing writer and editor and won two Eclipse Awards for his own work in the magazine during the publication’s short-lived but highly-praised run. Tower, whose great-great-grandfather was thoroughbred racing pioneer Cornelius Vanderbilt, subsequently served for eight years as the president of the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs and then its chairman for another 10 years. In addition to his Eclipse Awards, Tower received the Thoroughbred Racing Association’s award for magazine writing 1967, and collaborated on the historical work, “Saratoga: The Place and the People.”\n\nAndrew Beyer (2013)\n\nAndrew Beyer cultivated an interest in handicapping thoroughbreds while attending Harvard University in the 1960s and ended up spending much of his time at the races at nearby Suffolk Downs. His early career as a sportswriter took a significant turn in 1970 when he began writing a horse racing column for the Washington Daily News. At the same time, Beyer was developing and refining a handicapping system based on speed figures that burst upon the scene in 1975 with the publication of his first book, Picking Winners. In 1978, Beyer joined the Washington Post as horse racing columnist, a vantage point from which he offered insightful commentary and analysis on all aspects of the racing business until his retirement from the staff in 2004. Beyer continued to write columns for the Post and other publications, such as the Daily Racing Form, while maintaining control over the Beyer Speed Figures product that made him a household name in gambling circles and fundamentally changed the way in which a thoroughbred’s performances were analyzed. In 1998, Beyer was honored by the National Turf Writers Association with the Walter Haight Award for career excellence. In January of 2017, Beyer was presented an Eclipse Award of Merit for his lifetime achievements and contributions to racing.\n\nKent Hollingsworth (2013)\n\nKent Hollingsworth (1930 - 1999) was best known as both the editor and passionate editorial voice of The BloodHorse magazine from 1963 until 1986, whose weekly column “What’s Going on Here?” addressed the most significant industry issues of the day. A graduate of University of Kentucky, Hollingsworth did a tour in the Army and then went to work in 1954 as a news photographer and general sports writer for the Lexington Herald, while also filing weekly reports on Kentucky sports as a regional correspondent for Sports Illustrated. Hollingsworth served as both editor and contributing writer for \"The Great Ones,\" a collection of profiles of elite racehorses published in 1970. Following his tenure at The BloodHorse, Hollingsworth taught equine law at the University of Louisville as a Distinguished Lecturer in the Equine Industry Program, and wrote for the Racing Times and Thoroughbred Times.

T. Ryall (2013)\n\nGeorge F.T. Ryall (1887 - 1979) was known to readers of The New Yorker for more than half a century for his meticulous reporting on Thoroughbred racing under the pen name “Audax Minor.” Born in Toronto, Canada, and educated in England, Ryall began his career in journalism as a general assignment reporter for the London Exchange-Telegraph. After emigrating to New York, Ryall was in the right place at the right time to join the staff of the fledgling magazine that bore the city’s name. However, since he was still writing for the World at the time, Ryall adopted a pen name for his articles in The New Yorker (“Audax” was likewise an alias for a famous British writer). Ryall’s column “The Race Track” appeared in The New Yorker from 1926 until 1978, making him the longest running correspondent in a stable of writers that included John Updike, Roger Angell and John Hersey. Ryall also wrote for such publications as The Blood-Horse, Town & Country, The Sportsman and Country Life. In 1973, he received the Walter Haight Award from the National Turf Writers Association for lifetime achievement.\n\nJennie Rees (2014)\n\nJennie Rees covered horse racing for the Louisville Courier-Journal from 1983 through her retirement in 2015 and won Eclipse Awards in four different decades, four as an individual for writing and a fourth as the lead journalist for the Courier-Journal’s 2008 multimedia Eclipse-winning package on horse safety.

At age 19, the French racing journal France Courses gave him national exposure by publishing one of his cartoons of a jockey. Bellocq signed the drawing as “Peb,” a signature that became his lifelong moniker. Bellocq relocated to the United States and in 1955 accepted an offer to work as the staff cartoonist for the Morning Telegraph and its sister paper, the Daily Racing Form, a job he held until December 2008. Along with his work for the Form, Bellocq has been commissioned by numerous racetracks to produce vibrant murals capturing the flavor of the sport. His large-scale cartoon collages became fixtures at tracks such as Churchill Downs, Del Mar, Arlington, Oaklawn, Aqueduct, and The Meadowlands. Bellocq has also produced several books; his first, published in 1957, consisted of 150 cartoons and was titled “Peb’s Equine Comedy.” Bellocq also illustrated the 1969 Joe Hirsch book “A Treasury of Questions and Answers from the Morning Telegraph and Daily Racing Form.” Bellocq has received numerous awards for his work. In 1980, he received an Eclipse Award for his contributions to racing and he was presented The Jockey Club Medal in 2016. Bellocq also received the National Cartoonists Society 1991 Sports Cartoon Award and their 1999 Newspaper Illustration Award.\n\nWilliam Leggett (2020)\n\nWilliam Leggett (1931 - 1996), a native of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., became one of racing’s most celebrated and respected writers during his 30-year career at Sports Illustrated. Leggett earned a degree from Seton Hall University then had a brief stint in the Army before being hired by Sports Illustrated as a researcher and football writer. His role increased to also include covering baseball, college and professional basketball, and both thoroughbred and harness racing. He was eventually named Turf Editor for Sports Illustrated. Leggett, who spent time as president of both the National Turf Writers Association and the New York Turf Writers Association, won an Eclipse Award for his racing writing in 1979. After retiring from Sports Illustrated in 1986, Leggett continued his coverage of the sport as the New York correspondent for Thoroughbred Times and as a columnist for The Saratogian’s racing supplement, The Pink Sheet.\n\nWalter Haight (2021)\n\nWalter Haight (1899 - 1968), a native of Washington, D.C., joined The Washington Post in 1924, embarking on a prolific 44-year run with the paper. He started with The Post as a general assignment reporter and began covering thoroughbred racing for the paper in 1932. He reported on his first Kentucky Derby that year, beginning a streak of 37 consecutive years writing about the event. Haight was The Post’s racing writer and editor for 36 years and held the honorary No. 1 seat in the Churchill Downs press box for his longevity covering the Run for the Roses. A charter member and president of the Maryland Racing Writers Association and a vice president of the National Turf Writers Association, Haight has a career excellence award named in his honor annually presented by the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters Association. Upon his death in 1968, The BloodHorse said Haight “wrote with glee, for he saw the humor and the drama in the game” of racing. The publication described him as a “jolly man” who reveled in his role as “Aesop of the press box. Some of his funniest stories never made it into print. He could relate to the intricate machinations of past-posting a bookie, or the heart-breaking collapse of a four-horse parlay, with an admixture of merry pathos that kept listeners enthralled for hours.”\n\nJack Mann (2021)\n\nJack Mann (1925 - 2000), a New York City native, began his writing career in 1940 while in high school for the weekly Long Islander. He attended Columbia University for a year on the GI Bill and served with the Marine Corps from 1943 to 1946 in the North Pacific during and immediately after World War II. In 1947, he returned to newspapers as a reporter and editor of two Long Island weeklies, then joined Newsday, first as a reporter, then as assistant city editor, then as sports editor. Specializing in coverage of horse racing and baseball, Mann wrote for Newsday (1952 to 1962); The Detroit Free Press (1962 to 1963); The New York Herald-Tribune (1963 to 1965); Sports Illustrated (1965 to 1967); The Miami Herald (1968 to 1970); The Washington Daily News (1970 to 1971); The Washington Star (1971 to 1972); The Baltimore Evening Sun (1980 to 1990); and The Racing Times (1991 to 1992), among others.

A graduate of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, Broun joined the staff of the New York tabloid PM as a sportswriter in 1940. His journalism career was put on pause by World War II, during which time he served in the Army. Following his service, Broun returned to PM and also wrote for its successor, the New York Star, covering a variety of sports, including horse racing. In 1966, Broun was hired by CBS and began providing color commentary for the Triple Crown series alongside Jack Whitaker. He also became a fixture on the CBS Evening News and later worked for ABC. Known for his prominent mustache, colorful sports jackets, command of language, and distinctive commentary, Broun was a fixture in racing both in print and television. Writing in the New York Times in 1994, Broun said of thoroughbred racing: “To be great, a horse must have metaphorical wings. In mythology we punished wax-winged Icarus for flying too close to the sun, but in recognition of the nobility of their singlemindedness, mythology has let the chariot horses of Apollo traverse the sky. Race horses do not chaffer over money, get into bar fights or endorse horse blankets and aluminum shoes. They combine strength, grace, beauty and speed as perhaps no other link in the Darwinian chain can manage (cheetahs have funny-looking shoulders).” Prior to Secretariat’s 1973 Belmont Stakes, Broun wrote: “There were times when he didn’t seem so much on tiptoe as flying slightly above the earth, like one of those horses ancient Greek gods used to ride when in a hurry to get back to Olympus.”\n\nBernard Stanley \"Bert\" Morgan (2022)\n\nBert Morgan (1904 - 1986), a native of England who arrived in the United States with his parents at the age of seven, was one of the most prominent and respected photographers of thoroughbred racing and American society in the 20th century. He photographed his first horse race — the famous 1923 international match race between Zev and Papyrus at Belmont Park — while still a teenager. By 1930, Morgan was the official photographer for the Social Spectator and the Metropolitan Opera of New York City. In the 1930s, he began photographing the racing action and social scene at Hialeah Park in Florida. In 1940, Morgan was hired as the official photographer for the tracks in New York (later the New York Racing Association), a position he held until 1961, when he left NYRA to make Florida his year-round home. Known for photographing the races from vantage points and chronicling celebrities and other prominent members of society at the tracks, Morgan’s work appeared in national publications such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Town and Country in addition to numerous newspapers and wire services, including The Associated Press. Morgan’s son, Richard Morgan (1935 ̶ 2012), joined him in 1956 and formed Bert and Richard Morgan Studio. The father and son worked together until Bert’s death in 1986. Morgan’s photos are among the most important archived works in American racing. The Keeneland Library acquired more than 300,000 of his negatives in the 1960s and the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame also owns numerous Morgan negatives and prints. Morgan, who photographed 55 editions of the Kentucky Derby, was the inaugural recipient of the George B. Featherstone Photojournalism Award for Excellence in Equine Photography from the Thoroughbred Record in 1984. His photography has been featured in numerous books, including Horse Racing: The Golden Age of the Track and Seabiscuit, among others.\n\nDamon Runyon (2022)\n\nDamon Runyon (1880 - 1946), a native of Manhattan, Kansas, enlisted in the Army at the age of 18, participating in the Spanish-American War. While in the service, he wrote for the Manila Freedom and Soldier’s Letter. Following the war, he began working for newspapers in Colorado, specializing in sports coverage. Runyon moved on to New York City in 1910, and for the next decade covered professional baseball and boxing for the New York American. Looking for a change of pace from the baseball beat, Runyon traveled to Saratoga Race Course in 1922 and quickly became one of thoroughbred racing’s most impactful writers. In addition to the races, Runyon provided unique perspective on the jockeys, trainers, owners, gamblers, and gangsters who frequented the tracks, many of whom evolved into dramatized characters in Runyon’s fiction such as the Arnold Rothstein-inspired Nathan Detroit in “Guys and Dolls.” Twenty of Runyon’s stories, including “Guys and Dolls,” became films. Others of note are “Lady for a Day,” “Little Miss Marker,” “The Lemon Drop Kid,” “A Slight Case of Murder,” and “Money from Home.” Runyon covered racing through 1936 before moving on to other beats and focusing more on his fiction. Of that year’s Preakness, which was the final major race he covered, Runyon wrote: “We discovered something else about Pimlico that we never knew before. We always tore for the train as soon as the big race was over and our copy out of the way, so we never knew what happened thereafter. Saturday, we remained to the very last and learned that the bugler sounds Taps to indicate the end of the meeting, and the band once more plays Maryland, My Maryland. It’s a great place, that Pimlico, the last of the old, old places.”\n\nJohn L. Hervey (2023)\n\nJohn L. Hervey (1870 - 1947), a native of Jefferson, Ohio, began writing about thoroughbred and standardbred racing around the age of 16. Raised in a horseman’s family, Hervey developed a considerable knowledge of horse breeding. While still a teenager, Hervey put that knowledge to good use when he was hired by William Fasig to work in his sales organization — the Tipton Company of Cleveland, later becoming the famous Fasig-Tipton Company — and soon he was writing articles for a variety of turf journals. Through his connection with Fasig, Hervey became editor of The Trotting Horse in 1892. He also provided racing coverage for the Chicago Tribune in the 1890s and became one of Daily Racing Form’s first contributors. He remained an occasional correspondent for the Form until his death. In 1912, Hervey became editor for The Thoroughbred Record. It was during this period that Hervey, who used the pen name “Salvator” in honor of the Hall of Fame racehorse, became widely regarded as one of America’s foremost authorities on all aspects of racing and breeding. Other publications Hervey wrote for included The Blood-Horse, Breeder and Sportsman, The Harness Horse, Hoof Beats, and The Thoroughbred of California, among others. The Jockey Club hired Hervey to research and document American racing’s history in a multi-edition work, Racing in America. Hervey wrote three volumes in the series, the periods 1665 to 1865 (split into two books) and 1922 to 1936. He was also commissioned to write several volumes of the annual book American Race Horses, which was originally sponsored by Alfred G. Vanderbilt. In 1947, Hervey was contracted by the Trotting Horse Club of America, Inc., to author the book The American Trotter. Hervey, who died in December 1947, was so well thought of in harness racing that he was posthumously inducted into the Harness Racing Hall of Fame in 1962. The John Hervey Awards for excellence in harness racing journalism are named in his honor.\n\nDick Jerardi (2023)\n\nDick Jerardi grew up in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland with a journalism degree and a minor in history. He began authoring freelance articles about horse racing for the Baltimore News American and was the racing writer for Sports First, a Baltimore paper dedicated exclusively to sports that lasted just a year beginning in 1983. In February 1985, Jerardi was hired as the horse racing writer for the Philadelphia Daily News and became a fixture on the national scene. He covered every Triple Crown race from 1987 through 2017 and nearly every Breeders’ Cup during the same period while writing more than 7,000 stories for the paper during 33 years there — mostly about horse racing — with time covering other sports. In 2006, Jerardi won the Eclipse Award for his series on Barbaro. He has won the Red Smith Award for Kentucky Derby coverage five times and is a three-time winner of the Joe Hirsch Award for best Breeders’ Cup story. He was honored for the best Preakness story in 2004. In 2007, Jerardi was chosen by the National Turf Writers and Broadcasters as the winner of the Walter Haight Award for career excellence in turf writing. He also wrote a weekly column for Daily Racing Form for 20 years and was a charter member of the Beyer Speed Figure team which was first assembled in the mid-1980s and continues to this day with the Beyers appearing in the Form for the past three decades.\n\nPaul Moran (2023)\n\nMoran (1947 - 2013) was born in Buffalo, N.Y., and graduated from the University at Buffalo. He served in Vietnam and the Middle East as a sergeant in the Air Force before beginning a distinguished career in sports journalism, primarily known for his prowess as a racing writer. Moran covered his first Triple Crown races in 1973 during Secretariat’s historic run and continued to cover the series without interruption for the next 35 years. Moran worked for the Fort Lauderdale Sun Sentinel from 1975 to 1985 then joined the staff at Newsday on Long Island, N.Y., where he worked until 2008. Moran won two Eclipse Awards while at Newsday. His 1985 Eclipse was for a profile on Daily Racing Form columnist Joe Hirsch. Five years later, Moran was honored with his second Eclipse for his piece about the tragic breakdown of Hall of Fame filly Go for Wand. He also won the Red Smith Award for his Kentucky Derby coverage, as well as the Associated Press Sports Editors Award from the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1990 and the Distinguished Sports Writing Award from the New York Newspaper Publishers Association in 1992. Moran served on the board of directors of the National Turf Writers Association from 1987 to 1990 and was president of the New York Turf Writers Association from 1990 to 1992.
