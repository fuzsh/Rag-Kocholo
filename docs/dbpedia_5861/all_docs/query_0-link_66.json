        "text": "tags: Barbaro, horse racing, thoroughbreds, horses, leg injuries, churchill downs\n\nRoy and Gretchen Jackson, the owners of the gallant racehorse, Barbaro, who was euthanized one year ago today, have decided to inter his cremains at Churchill Downs in Kentucky, where he won the Kentucky Derby in May 2006.\n\nBarbaro, who shattered his right hind leg during the running of the Preakness Stakes in late May 2006, battled eight months for his life in a Pennsylvania veterinary hospital. The bay colored colt was eventually euthanized after developing laminitis, which is an incurable inflammation of the digital laminae in a horse's feet.\n\n\"In the year that has just preceded, we have spent much time thinking about Barbaro's memorial and where it would be best placed,\" Roy Jackson said in a news release. \"Churchill Downs became the obvious site for us. It was here that he ran his best race. It was here where we spent our most memorable day as horse owners and breeders. It was here where his racing fans could visit daily, and it was here at Churchill Downs where he was cordially invited to rest.\"\n\nAlthough four Kentucky Derby winners [Sunny's Halo (1983), Carry Back (1961), Swaps (1955) and Broker's Tip (1933)] are buried at the nearby Kentucky Derby Museum, Barbaro will be the first horse to ever be buried at Churchill Downs. Visitors can get to Barbaro's gravesite without going inside either Churchill Downs or the Kentucky Derby Museum.\n\n\"Churchill Downs is deeply honored to be selected as the final resting place for Barbaro, who first captured our hearts with his impressive win in the 132nd Kentucky Derby and who demonstrated strength and determination in his long battle to overcome both injury and illness,'' said Steve Sexton, president of Churchill Downs and executive vice president of Churchill Downs Inc.\n\nBarbaro's cremains will be interred in a garden outside Gate 1. A bronze statue of Barbaro, commissioned by the Jacksons, will be loaned to Churchill Downs and will stand at the site after its completion in 2009.\n\nHundreds of thousands of dollars have been raised in Barbaro's name to help find a cure for laminitis.\n\nSource"
