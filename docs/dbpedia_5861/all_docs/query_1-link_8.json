        "text": "The weather has been beautiful today, around 10 degrees warmer than past Octobers, and what better way to take advantage of it than to visit our resident Thoroughbred, Twinspired, out in the garden stable. The sun was dancing in and out of the trees and Twinspired had found a shaded area near the fence to catch some ZZZ’s. He would come in and out of his nap to look around and make sure his buddy Winston, our miniature horse, was still nearby - and to make sure he wasn’t eating all the hay to himself. It was a picture-perfect scene and I had my camera ready to share.\n\nIn around a month, Twinspired will be heading home and a new resident Thoroughbred, Populist Politics, will take his place. Come visit the gorgeous gray stallion Twinspired before he heads out, but don’t worry if you miss your chance to see him, he’s been known to revisit us at the Kentucky Derby Museum.\n\nWhile you’re out in the garden terrace, make sure to pay your respects to the five famous Kentucky Derby winners whose final resting place is here - Brokers Tip (1933), Swaps (1955), Carry Back (1961), Dust Commander (1970) and Sunny’s Halo (1983). Second place 2008 Derby finishing filly Eight Belles is interred in the garden under a Magnolia tree planted in her honor. The Museum’s Oaks Terrace Garden is peaceful and serene, offering a place to reflect on the legacy of the Kentucky Derby while be surrounded by history itself."
