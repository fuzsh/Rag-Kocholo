Keith Mason, the son of Ann and Wayne Mason of Snellville, is the co-managing partner of a syndicate which will have two horses running in the Derby on Saturday. Mason and Larry Connolly of Atlanta are co-founders of the West Paces Racing partnership group.\n\nIt’s unusual for an Atlanta syndicate to have not one, but two horses in the Kentucky Derby. The partnership’s two horses are Dornoch and Society Man. The odds on Thursday were 20:1 on Dornoch, who will be running out of the No. 1 slot, while the odds on Society Man are 50:1, running out of the 20th post.\n\nThe favorite horses are Fierceness at 5-2 (17th slot), and Sierra Leone at 3-1, but running out of the No. 2 post, which has proven to be a jinx position.\n\nA story this week in the Saporta Report gave the background on the two Atlantans getting involved with horse racing. Quoting Maria Saporta, she wrote: “Mason started going to the Kentucky Derby in 1990 when he was campaign manager for Zell Miller’s successful gubernatorial race….Connolly, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., was exposed to horse racing at Belmont Park and Saratoga.\n\n“This interest in horses led, in 2013, for Mason and Connolly getting into the syndication of horse racing.”\n\nInterestingly, it was another Atlantan, the late Cot Campbell, a sports writer and later an advertising executive, who in 1969, put together his first ownership syndicate, which allowed people from all walks of life to buy as little as 2.5 percent of a thoroughbred. He won more than 80 stakes races, including Preakness and Belmont. Along with Jack Burton, Campbell formed Burton-Campbell, one of Atlanta’s leading advertising agencies.\n\nIn 2013, Mason bought a piece in the Donegal partnership, which owned Keen Ice, a promising horse. When Connolly joined Mason at Keeneland in 2014, he expressed an interest in joining Donegal. By the fall of 2014, Mason and Connolly were at Churchill Downs when they saw Keen Ice win his first race as a 2-year-old. A crazy ride had begun. In 2015, Keen Ice finished 7th in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nSyndicating horses is not cheap. West Paces has different levels of a minimum buy-in for partners depending on age. Under 40, the minimum is $25,000. Under 50, the minimum is $50,000. For those over 50, the minimum is $100,000. The pair tell people buying into a syndicate to “kiss their money goodbye.” Currently, West Paces owns a part of 23 horses (one 5-year-old, two 4-year-olds, twelve 3-year-olds, and eight 2-year-olds).\n\nSaporta writes of the syndicate co-founders: “No matter what happens on May 4, Mason called the Kentucky Derby ‘the greatest two minutes in sports.’ It’s a huge rush. I call it a major passion.”\n\n“It makes you feel alive,” Connolly says. “I love feeling excited before a race.” He adds: “But for a moneyball outfit to have two horses in the Kentucky Derby in one year rarely happens.”\n\nHave a comment?

The issue is the number of illegals the bill would let in, and is the reason conservatives did not like the bill.\n\nThe Hispanic community is not happy with the huge flow of illegals. It is taking jobs from them and keeping wages low. The border is open to lots of drugs and other issues.\n\nFunds that could help our current Hispanic community are being taken away.\n\nWe are talking to the Hispanic community and they want the border tightened down. So I would say Jack is out of touch with the Hispanic community. A lot of citizens do not believe the media anymore. They see the real world!\n\n– Sammy Baker, Lawrenceville\n\nItem about obtaining a GGC degree was powerful!\n\nEditor, the Forum:\n\nYour recent article regarding Nickolas Brown was powerful. The story of his persistence and commitment is a great example of what can be accomplished when a goal is set with a “damn the torpedoes“ attitude.\n\n– John Moore, Duluth\n\nSend us your thoughts: We encourage you to send us your letters and thoughts on issues raised in GwinnettForum.

Additionally, there will be upgraded restrooms, locker rooms, administrative offices and a reception area. The center will also include an upper-level balcony with a two-way walking track. Outside, there will be a new drop-off area and parking for 73 vehicles.\n\nIn addition to the gym expansion, several other projects are underway at Lenora Park. Recently, the multipurpose field was converted from natural to synthetic turf, making it the 17th and final field to make this transition in the Gwinnett Parks and Recreation system.\n\nOther projects include a new press box and maintenance compound, additional lighted outdoor basketball courts, six lighted pickleball courts and improvements to the dog park with new agility equipment and shade features.\n\nConstruction on the community recreation center begins this year, with gymnasium renovations set to start in early 2025. Gwinnett County is using approximately $10 million in SPLOST funds for the community recreation center and gymnasium expansion project.\n\nYou can earn $440 if you become a poll worker\n\nGet involved in the electoral process and give back to your community!

She still carries memories from her birth country, like climbing to the top of the mango tree in her grandmother’s yard for ripe mangos, and how blue and clear the ocean water is and how white the sand is on its beach. “I remember seeing horses on the beach and being able to play, eat, and swim with my mom and her friends,” says Osei.\n\nWhen Osei was one year old, her father, Frank, moved to the U.S. to make a better life for his family. He at one point had three jobs at once. Four years later, he sent for Osei and her mother, Esther, and the family settled in Lawrenceville. “Today, my dad is a delivery driver. His hard work and dedication inspired me to be the hardworking person I am today,” she says.\n\nOsei said she had no plans to attend a four-year college after graduating from Peachtree Ridge High School in 2019. “At graduation, I felt like a complete failure, surrounded by peers who were attending big-named schools. I felt so inadequate. I was filled with self-doubt and a huge wave of uncertainty about my future.”\n\nHer plans changed on the night of her senior prom when she saw a homeless man on the street. The juxtaposition of her — dressed to the nines and celebrating what’s historically one of the best nights of a young American’s life — and a homeless person sharing the same space, sparked something in her. “I decided I was going to commit my life to making meaningful impacts in the lives of others, right then and there,” she says.\n\nShe was drawn to GGC’s small class sizes, affordability, and the fact that it’s less than a ten-minute drive from her home in Lawrenceville. She started her GGC journey in August 2019. “I decided to make my time at GGC count,” she says. “I pushed myself by joining organizations. The first one that really took me out of my comfort zone was the Student Government Association (SGA).” Osei was so inspired she applied for the senate secretary position and served for half a term.\n\nAfter SGA, she helped revamp her department’s sociology club. She gathered a few other like-minded students and they re-named it the Grizzly Organization for Human Services. In her two consecutive years as president, the club went from having five members to almost 30. “We’ve done book drives, donated to the GGC care pantry, volunteered at the GGC micro-farm, donated care packages to Northside Hospital, and we volunteer every month with Families 4 Families, a foster care agency,” says Osei. “Getting involved on campus really made my time at GGC worthwhile. I’m so glad I decided to get a bit uncomfortable and venture out. I’ve grown more than I thought as a student and a person!”\n\nOsei will receive a degree in human services with a concentration in social work and a minor in sociology. She plans to attend graduate school to earn a master’s in clinical social work.\n\nOsei will be among more than 900 students who will graduate at GGC’s spring 2024 commencement, taking place at 10 a.m. May 9 at Gas South District in Duluth.\n\nPeach State foundation awards scholarships for 2024\n\nThe Peach State Federal Credit Union C.A.R.E.S. Foundation announces the scholarship and educational grant recipients for 2024.

Harris, Stone Mountain: Hard Times can be called a philosophical treatise on the need for balance when educating children and how the seeds of deception and misery are sown when this does not occur. The primary characters are the Gradgrind family, including Thomas Gradgrind, a school board Superintendent, son Tom and daughter Louisa. The Bounderby family includes Josiah Bounderby, a businessman who turns out to be a fraud, Sissy Jupe who is abandoned by her father and is taken in by the Gradgrinds. Set in post-industrial England, the novel contains three chapter headings: Sowing, Reaping and Garnering. Written in Dickens’ unique style, the novel grows on the reader who will match the cadence of the language, which will bring the era back in all its complexity. A title to ponder, Hard Times is a novel about poverty of spirit and its intendant unfortunate results.\n\nAn invitation: what books, restaurants, movies or web sites have you enjoyed recently?

Opposed to U.S. political leadership and dissatisfied with American culture, student activists held demonstrations across the state and experimented with lifestyle changes in the hope of effecting fundamental change in American life.\n\nThe student movement, also called the New Left because it represented the latest manifestation of left-leaning political activism, gained converts on campuses across the nation throughout the decade. In Georgia several schools maintained chapters of national and regional student organizations, such as Students for a Democratic Society and the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC). Georgia student leaders often looked to the national New Left for guidance and inspiration. Georgia student activists who joined the civil rights and student movements routinely risked arrest and physical harm, as well as alienation from their more conservative friends and families.\n\nThe civil rights movement motivated many of Georgia’s New Left leaders to become involved in political activism. Morehouse College student Lonnie King, inspired by restaurant sit-ins in Greensboro, N.C., organized a protest campaign by drawing three student leaders from each of Atlanta’s six historically Black colleges and universities: Atlanta University and Clark College, the Interdenominational Theological Center, Morehouse, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College, and talking to the schools’ presidents. The resulting coalition, called the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights (COAHR), organized ten sit-ins by 200 students in downtown Atlanta on March 15, 1960. (In fear of such demonstrations, the Georgia legislature had recently made sit-ins a misdemeanor.)\n\nThe Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) continued the sit-ins with COAHR in October, and Martin Luther King Jr. was arrested along with other protestors on October 19. Because, in part, of the economic stress brought on by such protests, Atlanta outlawed segregation in public facilities in the fall of 1961.\n\nIn 1964, Emory University student Gene Guerrero became the first chairman of SSOC; he turned to activism after being arrested at a 1963 civil rights sit-in in Atlanta.\n\nThe University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens possessed a dedicated community of activists during the 1960s. In April 1968 ,students conducted a three-day sit-in at the Academic Building to protest the unequal treatment of female students. (The dress code and curfew rules were stricter for women than for men, and women, unlike men, were banned from living off campus and from drinking.) In the wake of the killing of four students by National Guardsmen at Kent State University in Ohio in May 1970, 3,000 students demonstrated on the UGA campus, leading the Board of Regents to close all schools in the University System of Georgia for two days. UGA did not escape the growing commitment to violence that characterized the national New Left in the late 1960s. On five separate occasions from 1968 to 1972, student activists attempted unsuccessfully to burn down the military building on campus.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nTo view the Georgia Encyclopedia article online, go to https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org\n\nMYSTERY PHOTO\n\nConcentrate broadly about today’s Mystery\n\nOur readers should think broadly about this edition’s Mystery Photo. That’s all we’ll say. Just tell us where it is and what the photo is about. Send entries to ebrack2@gmail.com, including your hometown.\n\nOf the last mystery, Susan McBrayer, Sugar Hill, wrote: “This was a good one! It could have been so many things – Spiderman movie, rappelling enthusiast, lunatic, etc.I had to do some digging around but – final answer – this is a person rappelling down the side of the 21c Museum Hotel in Durham, N.C. This took place April 20 and was the fourth Over the Edge fundraiser to raise money for Duke Children’s Hospital. Rappellers were either people who raised at least $1,000 for the hospital, people who did pediatric research, business people who had sponsored the event or educators. Turns out, this rappelling off buildings is a very popular fundraising method.”\n\nGeorge Graf of Palmyra, Va. took a different approach: “This building was once the historic Hill Building of the Durham Bank andTrust Company. It stands in what local folks call the old CCB or Sun Trust Building. The 18-story hotel was designed by the same architects who designed the Empire State Building. On the left side of your photo you can see the iconic Fuchsia Penguins of 21c Museum Hotel. In early 2023 one of the penguins was stolen, but was later recovered.” The photo came from Molly Minnear of Atlanta.\n\nOthers pinpointing the location included Allan Peel of San Antonio, Tex. and Jay Altman of Columbia, S.C.\n\nSHARE A MYSTERY PHOTO: If you have a photo that you believe will stump readers, send it along (but make sure to tell us what it is because it may stump us too!)
