        "text": "Hailed as \"The Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports,\" the historic 2018 Kentucky Derby did not disappoint. Undefeated chestnut colt Justify won the victor's blanket of roses by 2 and a half lengths, barreling down mud and rain to snap a 136-year record.\n\nThink your top performers and clients would be interested in watching next year's action in person while enjoying the VIP treatment?\n\nRead on for details of one of the world's most prestigious stakes races and how to build your own unforgettable trip to Churchill Downs in 2019.\n\n144 Years of Roses\n\nThe Kentucky Derby, held at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. on the first Saturday of each May, is a Grade I stakes race for 3-year-old thoroughbred horses. The race has been held each year since 1875, even during both World Wars. It is also known as \"The Run for the Roses\" in honor of the blanket of roses draped ceremonially over the winner.\n\nAs the first leg of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, the Derby is followed by the Preakness Stakes, then the Belmont Stakes, in the ensuing months. To claim the title of the Triple Crown, the horse must win all three races. This feat has only occurred 12 times in history, including the victory of American Pharaoh in 2015.\n\nOf all stakes races, attendance at the Kentucky Derby ranks first in North America, drawing over 155,000 fans each year.\n\nJustify Breaks \"Apollo's Curse\"\n\nIt's hard to put the scope and electricity of this year's Derby into words.\n\nFirst was the historic nature of Justify's win: Though it was the sixth year in a row that the odds-on favorite won the Derby, Justify became the first horse since 1882 to win without racing until age 3. To put that in perspective, the New York Times reports this was the year President Franklin D. Roosevelt was born, the electrical age began in Lower Manhattan - and the chestnut gelding Apollo won by a half-length.\n\nTo beat the so-called curse, Justify was trained by Bob Baffert, the same trainer who won the Triple Crown in 2015. By winning the Derby in just over 2 minutes and 4 seconds, Justify earned his jockey, trainer and owners a handsome $1,432,000 prize. Good Magic placed second, while Audible took third. Justify's rider was Mike Smith, 52, the second-oldest jockey ever to win the Derby. Smith has won once before, beating 50-1 odds on Giacomo in 2005.\n\nIn less than two weeks, Smith and Justify will compete again in the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nAnother incredible Derby headline came courtesy of one very lucky spectator in Selma, Texas. The unidentified woman has attended the Derby for years and picked her winners very carefully, choosing not only Justify to win the Derby, but each of the winners in four races leading up to the main event. With long shots up to 39-to-1 odds, she turned an unlikely $18 worth of wagers into an unprecedented $1.2 million payout.\n\nSee History Unfold in 2019\n\nNext year's Derby race is all set for Saturday, May 4, 2019 at Churchill Downs, with the Oaks race on Friday, May 3.\n\nYou can sit and watch the telecast at home, or you can witness the pandemonium in person. Imagine breaking out your finest hat or bow tie, sipping a mint julep, then cheering on your chosen horse over the roar of thundering hooves...\n\nWhich do you think would leave a greater impression on those most important to your business?\n\nWinspire can help you leverage the allure of the Kentucky Derby into an irresistible incentive.
