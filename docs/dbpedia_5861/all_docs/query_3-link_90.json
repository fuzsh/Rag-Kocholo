        "text": "Sharing a first-timers weekend guide for Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nLouisville has been on my list of places to visit forever.\n\nNot just for the bourbon (although definitely for the bourbon!), but for the classic attractions and the amazing things happening in the city’s dining scene alike.\n\nThe problem?\n\nFlights from Charlotte are typically outside of my budget for a weekend trip, and Louisville is just too far to make the drive over – even a long weekend.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links and hosted experiences, however, all opinions are my own.\n\nEnter: a rare drop in ticket prices on American Airlines out of Charlotte, perfectly timed for a weekend visit. Michael and I moved quickly to snap up a roundtrip fare, and soon we were off!\n\nNow that we’re back, I’m ready to share the highlights with you so you can easily prepare for your first visit to Louisville (basically: this is the guide I wish I’d had when I was planning our trip!). So pack your bags and read on to start planning your Louisville weekend getaway:\n\nABOUT LOUISVILLE\n\nWhat do Muhammad Ali, the Kentucky Derby, UPS Air Cargo, Louisville Slugger baseball bats, and Kentucky Fried Chicken all have in common? They all have called Louisville home.\n\nColonel George Rogers Clark (father of William Clark, of Lewis and Clark fame) is credited as the founder of Louisville, and the city was chartered in 1780. Named in honor of King Louis XVI of France, Louisville’s strategic location ahead of the Falls on the Ohio River contributed to its early growth as a bustling river port. Throughout the 19th century, Louisville thrived as a center for trade, industry, and transportation, becoming the tenth largest city at the time of the 1850 Census thanks to its diverse economy and entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nThough the city’s growth has since slowed, today Louisville is the perfect size for a weekend getaway. Visitors will find a combination of attractions and experiences that can’t be found anywhere else in the world. From world-class bourbon distilleries to iconic museums to just plain great food, there’s something for everyone to enjoy in this dynamic city.\n\n—\n\nFive things you may not know about Louisville\n\nSure, you may know about Louisville’s baseball and bourbon history, but did you know that the city helped fuel disco fever? The company that once produced 90% of the world’s disco balls is still stayin’ alive in the Original Highlands neighborhood.\n\nLouisville is home to the Belle of Louisville, the only remaining authentic steamboat from the packet boat era.\n\nThomas Edison called Louisville home, working the night shift at Western Union.\n\nThe Big Four Bridge connects Louisville to Clarksville, Indiana, just across the river. Once a former railroad bridge, now it’s solely for cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nFrederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect behind New York’s Central Park, designed many of Louisville’s city parks.\n\n—\n\nWith a little history under your belt, I think you’re ready to explore all the city has to offer:\n\nWHAT TO SEE + DO IN LOUISVILLE\n\nBourbon, baseball, and horses - things that at first don't appear to mix, but the city blends them together beautifully to form its distinctive personality\n\nTour a Bourbon Distillery\n\nA visit to Louisville wouldn’t be complete without a distillery tour, and lucky for all of us, Angel’s Envy Distillery is located right downtown. This family-founded distillery follows the strict requirements of bourbon production (mash bill with at least 51% corn, aging in new charred oak barrels, distilling at the proper proof, etc.), but adds a unique twist at the end by finishing their whiskeys in Port barrels – and they’ve managed to create an engaging visitor tour to walk us through the process step by step.\n\nThe Signature Tour begins with an introduction to the brand before heading in to see where the action takes place. Over the course of the next hour, visitors get to follow bourbon’s journey from unmilled grain to its final form before sampling the finished product in a guided tasting. I’m still relatively new to bourbon, but I found a deeper appreciation for its complex nature, surprisingly thanks in part to the chocolate pairing (yes, really). Reservations are highly recommended, and closed-toe shoes are essential.\n\n→Angel's Envy Distillery // 500 E Main St, Louisville, KY 40202\n\n—\n\nVisit the Kentucky Derby Museum\n\nWhether or not you’re into horse racing, a visit to the Kentucky Derby Museum is integral to your experience in Louisville as it offers a glimpse into the city’s history and culture. Start your visit by taking in the 360° short film “The Greatest Race”, which offers an immersive look at the race and places you right in the middle of the action during the most exciting two minutes in sports. Afterward, a guide will lead you out into the stands to offer a close-up view of the racetrack. Our tour was abbreviated due to single-digit temperatures, but our guide did an amazing job nevertheless.\n\nWith all of this as context, the museum is yours to explore. Avid fans will enjoy the in-depth look at past races and the impressive collection of memorabilia, and kids of all ages will enjoy the interactive racing exhibits and placing their bets (despite all odds, Michael came out way ahead – see the photo above). Allow 1-2 hours for this experience, or longer if you’re easily intrigued. Advanced reservations recommended.\n\n→Kentucky Derby Museum // 704 Central Ave, Louisville, KY 40208\n\n—\n\nTour the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory\n\nBatter up! Yet another only-in-Louisville museum is the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, bringing America’s favorite pastime to life. A guided factory tour offers a real-time glimpse at the production of the brand’s iconic wooden bats, and the museum grants visitors plenty of opportunities to hold history in their hands. You’ll witness firsthand how specialized machines transform cylindrical wooden billets into smooth, hearty baseball bats to players’ precise specifications, and at the end of it all, you’ll get to bring home your very own Louisville Slugger (in miniature!) as a souvenir. Note: if you’re flying with a carry-on, the museum will ship your bat to your home for just $10.\n\n→Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory // 800 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202\n\n—\n\nLouisville’s Local Shops + Boutiques\n\nI didn’t know what to expect from Louisville’s shopping scene, but as it turns out, it’s pretty fantastic. If you like shopping for locally-made goods, head to Grady Goods (art and unique souvenirs), Clayton & Crume (gorgeous leather bags and accessories), and Cry Baby General Store (custom chain stitching). If you prefer to do the making, Louisville Fiber Supply carries some amazing brands of yarn and other fiber supplies. Big fan of vintage? Fat Rabbit Thrift & Vintage and The Nitty Gritty are next-door neighbors with racks full of treasure.

The food scene is worth the price of a plane ticket alone.\n\nYou’ll find classic dishes at Louisville’s beloved, white tablecloth institutions like Jack Fry’s and The Lobby Bar at The Brown Hotel; international flavors with a twist at Dragon King’s Daughter, Full Arepa, and Mayan Cafe; and hearty good eats at spots like Gralehaus, Pizza Lupo, and V-Grits. It’s far too much to properly cover here, which is why this topic was granted its very own blog post. Head to my round-up of Eight Can’t-Miss Restaurants in Louisville, Kentucky, to learn more (warning – don’t click that link if you’re hungry!).\n\n→Dragon King's Daughter // 1543 Bardstown Rd, Louisville, KY 40205 →Full Arepa // 1001 Logan St, Louisville, KY 40204 →Gralehaus // 1001 Baxter Ave, Louisville, KY 40204 →Jack Fry's // 1007 Bardstown Rd, Louisville, KY 40204 →The Lobby Bar at The Brown Hotel // 335 W Broadway, Louisville, KY 40202 →Mayan Cafe // 813 E Market St, Louisville, KY 40206 →Pizza Lupo // 1540 Frankfort Ave, Louisville, KY 40206 →V-Grits // 1001 Logan St, Louisville, KY 40204\n\n—\n\nLouisville Bars + Breweries\n\nConsidering Louisville is ideally situated on the Bourbon Trail, it makes sense that the city offers visitors plenty in the way of libations. Cocktail bars reign over the land here, and though my list of ones to visit was long, I had to narrow things down a bit for the sake of my liver and wallet. Two true cocktail bars I visited and recommend are Neat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop for its lengthy list of spirits and cozy atmosphere, and the bar at Proof On Main for innovative cocktails and being seen (and well, a mighty great view if I do say so too).\n\nMy friends traveling on a budget will be glad to find High Horse, a funky dive bar in Butchertown. Think good music, good energy, and great prices on solid drinks. And you can take the girl out of Charlotte, but you can’t take the Charlotte out of the girl – Louisville has a thriving brewery scene and if you like visiting breweries, these two should be on your list: Pivot Brewing Company and West Sixth Brewing. Though both are technically based out of Lexington, their Louisville taprooms feel right at home in their neighborhoods.\n\n→High Horse // 1032 Story Ave, Louisville, KY 40206 →Neat Bourbon Bar & Bottle Shop // 1139 Bardstown Rd, Louisville, KY 40204 →Pivot Brewing Company // 1753 Bardstown Rd, Louisville, KY 40205 →Proof On Main // 702 W Main St, Louisville, KY 40202 →West Sixth Brewing // 817 E Market St Suite 101, Louisville, KY 40206\n\n—\n\nLouisville Coffee Shops\n\nIf you’re anything like me, coffee shops are essential to a great weekend getaway. I mean, how else are we supposed to stay up late enjoying Louisville’s nightlife and manage to make it to all of our stops on our itinerary the next day? Have no fear, as I have three great coffee shop recommendations for your visit (and they all have multiple locations in the area!):\n\nQuills Coffee, for excellent espresso beverages in a chic space\n\nSunergos Coffee, for perfectly roasted and brewed coffee with a truly local feel\n\nPlease & Thank You, for great coffee with the best cookie in the state, according to USA Today (and they ship, which is dangerous…)\n\n→Please & Thank You // Multiple Locations →Quills Coffee // Multiple Locations →Sunergos Coffee // Multiple Locations\n\n—\n\nLouisville Bakeries\n\nHow can I follow up that last recommendation with anything other than more sweets and treats?\n\nSmør Nordic Bakeri is only open for a blink of an eye on Fridays and Saturdays – meaning, if you’re planning a great weekend in Louisville, you need to kick things off with a visit (that’s a pretty easy thing for travelers to do since it’s near the airport!). All of your classic Nordic baked goods are here, from kringla to kladdkaka to bullar. Stock up, or face waiting until next week for your next Smør fix.\n\nBy the time I finally made it to Blue Dog Bakery & Cafe, I had already seen their bread listed on many Louisville menus, and I knew a visit was in my future. Walking up to the counter, you’ll be greeted with beautifully laminated pastries, ready to sprinkle you with their tasty, buttery flakes. Don’t skip the kouign amann!\n\nGood bagels are fairly elusive in my city, so when I find a spot that is rumored to have good bagels, I have to visit. Payne Street Bake House is a must for early morning bagels, and heads up – they don’t skimp on the cream cheese!\n\n→Blue Dog Bakery & Cafe // 2868 Frankfort Ave, Louisville, KY 40206 →Payne Street Bake House // 225 S Spring St, Louisville, KY 40206 →Smør Nordic Bakeri // 1001 Trevilian Way, Louisville, KY 40213\n\nWHERE TO STAY IN LOUISVILLE\n\nWhen visiting Louisville for a short time, it's a good idea to stay close to it all\n\nMoxy Louisville Downtown\n\nFor a short getaway, Moxy Louisville Downtown offers excellent value to travelers. This contemporary hotel flips the traditional hotel concept of a small lobby and larger rooms on its head, prioritizing giving guests a variety of common areas to mix and mingle. The lobby is so much more than a check-in counter – it’s also a bar (don’t forget your free drink token at check-in!), a taco window, a grab-and-go convenience shop, a game room, and more.\n\nUpstairs are pocket-sized studio rooms designed to maximize the small square footage: Instead of a standard enclosed bathroom, the shower and sink are separated from the sleeping area by way of a word search-inspired curtain. Rather than a bulky closet, hooks are provided on the wall, and cubby space is accessible underneath the bed. In place of an iron and ironing board, a handheld steamer is offered. All of these thoughtful touches are a great reminder that we don’t necessarily need much when we travel.\n\nOverall, our experience at Moxy felt worth the price, particularly as ample free street parking was available during our visit to help keep costs down. If I had to offer any feedback, it would be that a little more attention is needed to cleanliness in low-traffic areas of the room; when I pulled my suitcase and clothing out from the cubby under the bed to get dressed, everything was covered in dust. I also personally don’t love having the shower and sink in my room when I’m staying with a travel partner as it can disrupt sleep (if you’re sharing a room here, you definitely want to know your travel companion well!). These, combined with the small layout, would make me consider staying somewhere else if I was visiting for more than two or three nights – but on the whole, it was a positive experience. I particularly appreciated the homages to the destination throughout the hotel, the friendly welcome from staff, a comfortable lobby, and the availability of a water dispenser in the gym (this is such a specific amenity but I love it so much!), and would consider staying again for a short visit.\n\n→Moxy Louisville Downtown // 100 W Washington St, Louisville, KY 40202\n\nWITH MORE TIME IN LOUISVILLE\n\nMore time in Louisville?

As it sits with one foot in the Midwest, and one foot in the South, Louisville is also an ideal city to loop into your regional road trip (Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Nashville are all within a three-hour drive). But no matter how you arrive, you should weigh your decision to rent a car beforehand.\n\nIn January, having a car in Louisville was an asset (the less time spent waiting on a rideshare in freezing temperatures, the better!), but during big event weekends, I could see it becoming more of a hindrance than a benefit. The city is fairly compact, so if you’re staying downtown and are willing to build out a neighborhood-based itinerary, you could potentially save money by skipping the rental and opting to spend a little more time in transit. Of course, if you’re in Louisville strictly for the bourbon, hand over the keys and take a rideshare or bourbon tour with transport!\n\nWhen is the best time to visit Louisville? Well, that depends on what you’re after. Foodies will want to time their visit during Louisville Restaurant Week, horse racing fans have to visit during Derby in May, and everyone else can take their pick from Louisville’s robust calendar of annual events. Don’t have an event in mind? Well, you can always take advantage of a cheap flight (like we did!) or base your trip on the forecast.\n\nLike the rest of the region, the most comfortable time to visit is early spring or autumn, when pleasantly chilly nights give way to bouts of sunshine during the day. My January visit coincided with the season’s first snowfall, and personally, I like to head further north during the summer to escape the heat and humidity. But, as you’ll hear me quote over and over, “There’s no such thing as bad weather – only bad clothing,” so just come to Louisville when you’re able.\n\nAs for the other type of comfort, I found locals to be warm, welcoming, and always ready to strike up a conversation – so budget a little extra time at each stop!\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS ON MAKING YOUR FIRST TRIP TO LOUISVILLE A SUCCESS\n\nWell, this might be our first visit to Louisville, but there’s no way it’s going to be our last. With great food and drink, plenty to see and do, and a cool riverfront setting, it’s a city I hope to return to over and over again. I grew pretty smitten with Louisville in just one weekend, and I think you will too.\n\nSee you there soon? Cheers, friends!\n\n—\n\nQuestions for you\n\nDo you have a favorite bourbon?\n\nWhich Louisville spot are you most excited to visit?\n\nEnjoyed this post? You may also like:"
