        "text": "Good spellers and serious horseplayers both received a jolt today when a colt misnamed Deputed Testamony scored a 2 3/4-length victory in the 108th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course and Sunny's Halo finished sixth as the 11-to-10 favorite.\n\nDeputed Testamony hugged the rail from start to finish under Donald A. Miller Jr. and kept going when all the others floundered on the sloppy track in the stretch. Desert Wine, who led for the first mile, finished second, 4 lengths ahead of High Honors. Marfa finished another 1 3/4 lengths back in fourth and a head in front of Play Fellow. It was another 2 3/4 lengths back to Sunny's Halo, who won the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago but lost today by more than 11 lengths.\n\nDeputed Testamony, coupled in the betting with Parfaitement, a stablemate who faded to finish eighth, paid $31 for $2 to win at the mutuel windows and covered the mile and three-sixteenths in 1:55 2/5. At New York City Offtrack Betting shops, where Deputed Testamony ran as a single betting interest, $2 bettors reaped $75.60 on the winner.\n\nThis was not an artful Preakness. Instead it was an uninspiring race in which Deputed Testamony appeared to win through racing luck and by default over a track made messy by rain that hampered most of the runners.\n\nDeputed Testamony is owned in partnership by Francis P. Sears, a Boston stockbroker, and Bonita Farm, a breeding operation near here that is owned by the Boniface family, which includes J. William Boniface, the winning trainer.\n\nBoniface's father, William, was a longtime horse-racing reporter and editor with the Baltimore Sunpapers. Deputed Testamony was born at Bonita and, in fact, spent all week stabled there instead of at the track. He was vanned to Pimlico at 11:30 this morning, only six hours before post time.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
