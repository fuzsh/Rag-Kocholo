        "text": "Dr. Sarah Dolder is a board-certified dermatologist dedicated to excellence in comprehensive dermatological care, with a specific focus on acne and other inflammatory skin conditions, skin cancer, cosmetic dermatology, and photorejuvenation.\n\nSarah was born and raised in Australia. She attended the University of Melbourne, earning her Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery with Honors. She also completed her Bachelor of Medical Science at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. After moving to New York, Dr. Dolder completed her Dermatology Residency at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and continues to help train the next generation of dermatologist as Clinical Instructor of Dermatology at Columbia University.\n\nShe has been published in several journals and presents regularly at international Dermatology conferences. A fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, the American Society of Cosmetic Dermatology & Aesthetic Surgery, and a member of the American Medical Association, she stays current with the latest cutting-edge research.\n\nWith a fiercely loyal client list and a proven track record, Sarah earned a reputation as a top dermatologist in New York City. Now, Dr. Dolder is excited to bring her modern and integrative approach to skincare and wellness to Greenwich, Connecticut, where she lives with her husband and three children.\n\nI started this practice after spending 13 years building my career in New York City, but my love for dermatology began much earlier on a sunny beach on the opposite side of the globe.\n\nBecoming a doctor was a dream of mine since I was a little girl growing up in Australia – a place where zinc noses and broad-brimmed hats were part of our school uniform. Having spent nearly every weekend on the beach, I learned the harmful impact sun has on our skin. As I matured, I became fascinated with both preventing and reversing the sun’s effects. I’ve built a career exploring advanced science and the ways in which lifestyle factors into overall skin health.\n\nI believe that with modern science and technology there is no reason anyone should have to “live with” an uncomfortable or damaging dermatological condition.\n\nIn addition to my career as a leading Dermatologist and medical educator, I’m also a wife and mother. Raising three children, one with severe food allergies, has opened my eyes wide to the role that diet, exercise and mindfulness plays in our overall health and wellness. That’s why my clinical philosophy is best summarized as “more than skin deep.” I am always eager and happy to share what I learn with my patients and invite you to follow along and join the discussion on my ​Brilliant Blog.\n\nI want to thank the people of Greenwich for welcoming Greenwich Point Dermatology to the community, and I look forward to seeing you walk through our door.\n\nYours in good health,\n\nSarah Dolder, MD\n\nDr. Jacqueline Berliner is double board certified in Dermatology and Mohs Micrographic Surgery .
