        "text": "Dublin, Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The \"Global and China Electronic Rearview Mirror Industry Report, 2024\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.\n\nResearch on electronic rearview mirrors: electronic internal rearview mirrors are growing rapidly, and electronic external rearview mirrors are facing growing pains\n\nThe report summarizes the development status, loading situation, supplier product layout, and supply chain layout of global and Chinese electronic rearview mirrors, and forecasts the future development trend of electronic rearview mirrors.\n\nStreaming media rearview mirror: assembly volume is growing rapidly, and market landscape of TOP 5 has changed\n\nIn 2023, the assembly volume of new passenger car electronic rearview mirrors hit 491,000 units, an increase of 54.8% year-on-year. From January to April 2024, the assembly volume of streaming media rearview mirrors was 159,000 units, an increase of 33.8% year-on-year.\n\nFrom the perspective of suppliers, Yuanfeng Technology is still in the leading position in the industry, but CR5 decreases from January to April 2024, and market competition intensifies. From January to April 2024, compared with 2023, the TOP 5 market pattern of electronic internal rearview mirrors changed, with Yuanfeng and Gentex still ranking among the top two. OFILM replaced Huayang in the third place, and FinDreams Technology entered the top five.\n\nYuanfeng Technology's fifth-generation streaming media rearview mirror products have improved in imaging time, image delay, overexposure, lens halo interference, and rearview mirror image distortion compared with the fourth-generation streaming media rearview mirror products. The specific comparison is as follows:\n\nInstallation of CMS is less than expected, facing growth troubles\n\nAt present, users encounter the following problems when using electronic exterior mirrors:\n\nScreen position needs to be adapted: The position of electronic external rearview mirror screen setting is lower than that of the physical rearview mirror. Users need to adjust the habit of looking at rearview mirror, and the field of vision needs to be lowered, which takes some time to adapt. Focusing the screen back and forth can cause eye discomfort: the electronic rearview mirror screen is closer to the eye and is an optical screen. When the user reflexively looks at the physical external rearview mirror, the angle of head and the focus position of the eye need to be readjusted.\n\nThe screen field of view is slightly narrow: the screen of electronic rearview mirror is too small, the field of view of rearview mirror is a little narrow, and the electronic rearview mirror cannot change the angle at any time and cannot change with the field of view. It is difficult to accurately determine the distance of the rear car in electronic rearview mirror: Looking at electronic rearview mirror, the rear vehicle looks obviously far away, but when actually looking back, the vehicle is close to the side of the body, the distance is inaccurate, and the user will have uncertainty when changing lanes.\n\nIn addition, the high price of electronic external rearview mirror itself is also an important factor affecting its development. At present, existing models have HUD with digital rearview mirror image function, which can project the blind spot image on both sides of the body on HUD, realizing low-cost function of CMS. Users do not need to pay any fees to use 'similar electronic rearview mirror' function. If CMS supplier cannot solve the above problems when using, and the CMS is not recognized by users, the electronic rearview mirror may be replaced by display terminal of this 'similar electronic rearview mirror' function.\n\nFaced with this situation, CMS suppliers need to improve user experience of CMS products and reduce CMS costs. In terms of cost reduction, Yuanfeng Technology has launched CMS products that support independent ECUs and reused ADAS architectures, which can be more easily adapted to vehicle development, and ADAS cameras reuse can also reduce CMS costs.\n\nFrom the user experience of product, the placement of CMS display is an important part that affects user's driving experience. Common installation positions of CMS display are both sides of instrument, both sides of joint screen, left and right A pillars, and left and right door panels. From the perspective of product layout, the installation position of CMS display should comprehensively consider the integration of cockpit shape and convenience of driver's observation. The best position should be to allow driver to complete the field of vision observation without turning his head as much as possible.\n\nSince China began allowing CMS on the road on July 1, 2023, there have been only 6 mass-produced models equipped with CMS in passenger cars, far below market expectations. At present, some OEMs are also planning CMS models, which are expected to usher in significant growth from 2025 to 2026.\n\nThere will be an intermediate transition product form of electronic exterior rearview mirrors in the future\n\nUnder the situation that CMS has not yet installed in volume, the appearance of CMS intermediate transition product form may be a new trend. It is undeniable that CMS has great advantages over traditional rearview mirrors in scenarios such as rain and fog, and the impact of bad road lighting environments. But for the current users who dare not rely solely on electronic rearview mirrors, can there be a form in which CMS coexists with traditional rearview mirrors, or can traditional rearview mirrors be retained and existing products be used to achieve CMS functions? At present, Li Auto and IM have realized the form of 'similar electronic exterior rearview mirror' function by using existing products.\n\nTaking Li Auto as an example, in May 2024, Li Auto's latest OTA 5.2 added HUD digital rearview mirror imaging function. This system directly calls the surround/side view camera, projects the blind spot images on both sides of car on HUD while the driver toggles steering lever, and can issue a blind spot alarm in time through HUD blind spot image. Although there is a large gap in image display clarity compared to CMS, the low-cost function of CMS is realized.\n\nDevelopment Trends of Electronic Rearview Mirrors\n\nIntelligent Cockpit Platform Adds CMS Display Solution\n\nFuture Layout Modes of Monitors\n\nThe Combination of CMS and Cockpit Domain Controller Is the Future Development Direction\n\nCMS Is Combined with ADAS/Autonomous Driving, and CMS is Expected to Reuse ADS Camera\n\nThe Usage of CMS in Passenger Cars is Lower Than Expected. Can CMS Transition Products Be Realized?\n\nImproving the Reliability of CMS Products and Providing a Good User Experience Are the Key to Breaking the Deadlock\n\nReducing CMS Costs Urgently Needs to Integrate the CMS Industry Chain to Improve Industrial Supporting\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\nOverview of Electronic Rearview Mirror Industry\n\nOverview of Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror Market and Application Solutions\n\nOverview of Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror and Market\n\nApplication Cases of Electronic Interior Rearview Mirrors by OEMs\n\nElectronic Interior Rearview Mirror Solutions of Tier1s\n\nGentex\n\nYuanfeng Technology\n\nADAYO Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror Solution\n\nFicosa Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror Solution\n\nMagna Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror Solution\n\nJingwei HiRain Electronic Interior Rearview Mirror Solution\n\nOverview and Application Cases of Camera Monitoring System (CMS)\n\nOverview of CMS\n\nOEMs' Application Layout of Passenger Car CMS\n\nGeely Lotus\n\nChangan Avatr\n\nBEIJING\n\nSAIC Maxus\n\nDongfeng Motor\n\nBYD\n\nHonda\n\nHyundai's CMS Application Case: New IONlQ5\n\nApplication Case for BAIC BJEV CMS Planning: Stelato S9\n\nApplication Case for Chery CMS Planning Concept Car: Chery iCAR X25\n\nApplication Case for Geely CMS Planning Concept Car : Galaxy Starship\n\nSummary of Other OEM' CMS Concept Cars\n\nOEMs' Application Layout of Commercial Vehicle CMS\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nVolvo\n\nFAW Jiefang\n\nYutong\n\nIveco CMS Application Case: New Generation S-Way\n\nKenworth CMS Application Case: SuperTruck 2\n\nFoton Daimler CMS Application Case: The New Auman Galaxy\n\nGeely Farizon CMS Application Case: Xinghan H\n\nShaanxi Automobile CMS Application Case: Shaanxi Automobile Delong X6000\n\nJAC Heavy Truck CMS Application Case: GALLOP K7\n\nDeepway CMS Application Case: Deepway Star\n\nHybot CMS Application Case: H49\n\nQingling Motors CMS Application Case: Light Truck EVM600\n\nWeichai New Energy Commercial Vehicle CMS Application Case: LandKing EHPro Light Truck\n\nNewrizon CMS Application Case: Newrizon iC1 Pure Electric Light Truck\n\nBYD Commercial Vehicle CMS Application Case: BD11 Pure Electric Double-decker Coach\n\nCamera Monitoring System (CMS) Solutions of Tier1s\n\nSection 1 Passenger Car Camera Monitoring System (CMS) Solutions of Tier1s\n\nFicosa\n\nMagna\n\nTokai Rika\n\nADAYO\n\nDesay SV\n\nHefei Jiangcheng\n\nJingwei Hirain\n\nTianhan Technology\n\nVoyager Technology\n\nAutocruis\n\nShanghai G-Pulse\n\nYuanfeng Technology\n\nGentex's Passenger Car CMS Solution\n\nOFILM's Passenger Car CMS Solution\n\nNingbo Huaxiang's Passenger Car CMS Solution\n\nHAXC's Passenger Car CMS Solution\n\nSection 2 Commercial Vehicle Camera Monitoring System (CMS) Solutions of Tier1s\n\nStoneridge\n\nMEKRA Lang\n\nShanghai Voyager Technology\n\nshanghai Yuxing Electronics\n\nSenptec\n\nRongsheng Technology\n\nTianhan Technology\n\nADAYO's CMS Solutions for Commercial Vehicles\n\nGuangzhou Minth's CMS Solutions for Commercial Vehicles\n\nAZIMUT's CMS Solutions for Commercial Vehicles\n\nCommercial Vehicle CMS Solution and Application Case\n\nCamera Monitoring System (CMS) Supply Chain Solutions\n\nSection 1 Camera\n\nOFILM\n\nSUNNY SMARTLEAD\n\nSENSING\n\nAiptek's CMS and Camera Module Solutions\n\nCMS Camera Module Solutions of TS-Precision Technology\n\nSUNWING's CMS Camera Module Solutions\n\nSection 2 Display\n\nBOE Varitronix\n\nTianma Microelectronics\n\nHolitech\n\nCMS Display Solutions and Application Cases of Samsung Display\n\nCMS Display Solutions of Other Companies\n\nSection 3 Chip\n\nCMS Chip Technology Solutions\n\nAmbarella\n\nAMD Xilinx\n\nBlack Sesame Technologies\n\nAXERA\n\nORITEK\n\nQualcomm\n\nCMS Chip Solutions\n\nCMS Chip Solutions of SigmaStar\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/coaivk\n\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.com\n\nResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.
