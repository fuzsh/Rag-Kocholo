        "text": "The 150th Kentucky Derby is finally here! There are few things more iconic than the Run for the Roses and this banner year promises to be one for the history books.\n\nChurchill Downs Racetrack is ushering in the massive anniversary with the opening of its new $200M paddock, which is the first thing people will see when they step through the gates.

And be sure to download our Kentucky Derby 150 betting guide!\n\nHappy Derby, y'all!\n\nMystik Dan, trained by Kenny McPeek, has officially won the historic 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nIn a photo finish, the horse — who entered the $5 million, Grade 1 race with 18-1 odds — covered the 1 1/4 miles in 2:03.34.\n\nBehind Mystik Dann were Sierra Leone and Forever Young. It was the first nose margin in a Derby since Grindstone beat Cavonnier in 1996. Sierra Leone also nosed out Forever Young — the Japanese contender — by a nose for second place.\n\nThe $5 million purse was the richest in Kentucky Derby history, surpassing the $3 million purse from 2019-23. The winner earned $3.1 million.\n\nShortly after the race, Mystik Dan trainer Kenny McPeek called jockey Brian Hernandez Jr. \"one of the most underrated riders\" during the NBC broadcast. \"But, not anymore,\" he said.\n\nIt's official: 156,710 people are in attendance for the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby, according to a post on X, formerly Twitter, from Churchill Downs communications director Darren Rogers.\n\nThe total makes it the most attended Derby since 2018. According to previous Courier Journal reporting, 157,813 people were in attendance that year.\n\n5:30 p.m.: 21c's Steve Wilson: 'This is the time when we can really show off Kentucky'\n\nSteve Wilson, owner of 21c Museum Hotel in Louisville, was sporting an iconic suit for the 150th Run for the Roses, made by Louisville designer Gunnar Deatherage, a previous contestant on “Project Runway.”\n\nThe suit features a lining that depicts drawings of past Derbies. The sleeves are decorated in a 3D floral design made from recycled bottles, Wilson said.\n\nAfter the Derby, the suit will be sent to the Kentucky Derby Museum where it will be on display.\n\nWilson, who was seated in the Churchill Downs Racetrack Mansion, said he loves the Derby because it’s an experience that makes people happy.\n\n“This is the time when we can really show off Kentucky,” Wilson said. “This is the moment. I love Kentucky, I want it to be an iconic travel destination, you can taste good food, good bourbon and see good horses.”\n\n- Olivia Evans\n\n5:15 p.m.: Culver Military Academy Black Horse Troop prepares to show the colors for the national anthem\n\nThe Culver Military Academy Black Horse Troop walked the backside of Churchill Downs before the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby.The troop, which is made up of junior and senior boys, will do the color guard for the national anthem.Yesterday, the Culver Military Academy girl’s troop presented the color guard before Oaks.\n\n- Stephanie Kuzydym\n\nLooming high above the packed infield and the grandstand, celebrities took in Derby Day races from exclusive suites and clubs accessible only to the ultra-wealthy and well-connected.\n\nIn a tour of several of those exclusive areas, Courier Journal reporters spotted people influential in the worlds of politics, sports and entertainment.\n\nAt the Turf Club Terrace, country rock icon Kid Rock could be seen mixing with guests while first wearing a pink suit and later, a black tank top. His outfit was rounded out by a gold and a bedazzled belt of a steer’s skull.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers could also be seen inside the Turf Club wearing a navy suit over a white shirt and sunglasses.\n\nIn a burst of yellow, legendary singer, songwriter and producer Smokey Robinson arrived in the club with his sunshine-colored entourage. Heads turned as they poured into the terrace flanked by security guards.\n\nActress Sheryl Lee Ralph, who stars in the ABC comedy “Abbott Elementary,” took her seat alongside a wall of windows overlooking the race track.\n\nShe was joined by country music singer Mickey Guyton.\n\nUniversity of Louisville football coach Jeff Brohm was also at the Turf Club, as well as UofL’s new men’s basketball coach Pat Kelsey.\n\nU.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey was inside a suite at the Finish Line Suites.\n\nEach suite, which can hold up to 40 guests, starts at $295,000 per year for Oaks and Derby for a “multi-year agreement,” according to the Churchill Downs website.\n\n- Eleanor McCrary and Josh Wood\n\n4:15 p.m.: Derby City Gaming Downtown hosts Derby viewing party\n\nFans of the Kentucky Derby that can’t make it to Churchill Downs can watch the race at Derby City Gaming Downtown on Saturday.\n\nDerby City Gaming Downtown, 401 W. Market St., is showing the races on a big screen and people can bet, drink, eat and have fun.\n\nFor $50, people get $25 in free play for slots machines, two free drinks and a 150th Kentucky Derby Program.\n\nNikki Hines, food and beverage supervisor at Derby City Gaming Downtown, said as of 4 p.m., there were 30 spots available for people that want to take advantage of the viewing experience.\n\nJakob Ayer, marketing operation supervisor for Derby City Gaming, said there will also be two photo booths between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.\n\n- Ana Rocío Álvarez Bríñez\n\nIn an interview with The Courier Journal ahead of the 150th Kentucky Derby, Louisville Congressman Morgan McGarvey said the event's use of “My Old Kentucky Home,” a 19th-century song inspired by the abolitionist novel “Uncle Tom’s Cabin” that has, in recent years, faced controversy from critics over racist roots, should be reconsidered.\n\n3:45 p.m.: U of L coaches make their Kentucky Derby picks\n\nUniversity of Louisville football coach Jeff Brohm and University of Louisville men's basketball coach Pat Kelsey shared their Derby horse picks in an interview with The Courier Journal ahead of the race.\n\n\"Well, this year for the Derby — I haven't been in a few years - I'm going to go with Dornoch,\" Brohm said. \"I think it's going to start strong and finish strong and come by with a victory.\"\n\nHis second choice is Mystik Dan.\n\nKelsey, who was just named the new Louisville men's basketball coach in March, has a different selection.\n\n\"I'm heavy on Sierra Leone,\" said Kelsey. \"I like Domestic Product and Just A Touch.\"\n\nKelsey added that he is already excited about next basketball season and is filling the roster now. Kelsey can already \"feel the energy in the city.\"\n\n- Eleanor McCrary\n\nEmmitt Smith’s outfit was adorned with some family flair. The interior of his light blue plaid suit jacket included photos of his children, mother and father. “They’re with me today,” he told on the Courier Journal on the 150th Kentucky Derby red carpet.\n\nSmith, known as a NFL legend, has made the Derby a bit of a tradition, and shared a sense of admiration for the preparation from horses, trainers and jockeys that goes into a huge race.\n\n“All the training comes together today,” he said. “And today we get to see some of the finest animals on the planet run around this track.”\n\n3:21 p.m.: Rep. Morgan McGarvey makes Kentucky Derby 150 pick\n\nU.S. Rep. Morgan McGarvey's Derby race pick is close to his family's heart.\n\n\"This one for us is all emotion this year,\" he explained, glancing at his wife, Chris. Her grandmother was an “incredible woman” named Marie. Chris and the McGarvey’s daughter have the middle name “Marie,” he said.\n\n\"So for us this year, the easy pick is Honor Marie.\"\n\nThe McGarveys are enjoying the 150th Derby at the Finish Line Suites. He also attended Kentucky Oaks, and said some of his friends on the U.S House Committee on Ways and Means gave him money to place bets.\n\n\"I went along with it,” he said, laughing. “None of us won.\"\n\n- Eleanor McCrary\n\nIt’s never too early to start planning for next year’s Kentucky Derby.\n\nAccording to a post on X, formerly Twitter, tickets for the 151st Run for the Roses, which will be on May 3, 2025, are available now.\n\nPeople can pre-register for Derby and Oaks tickets at https://www.kentuckyderby.com/sign-up/.\n\n3:15 p.m.: 'I just want people to come and experience our great city and all the traditions'\n\nGia Combs, Miss Cosmos United States 2023 and a former Kentucky Derby Queen, and her mother, former University of Louisville basketball player Valerie Combs, were near the Clubhouse Gate just before Race 9 on the 150th Kentucky Derby Day.\n\n“With this being 150, I just want people to come and experience our great city and all the traditions,” she said. “It’s great to welcome people who have never been here before.”\n\nThey’d just come from their Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority brunch with their friend Sharon Swisher, who was in town from San Antonio, and had watched more than 30 Kentucky Derby races at Churchill Down.\n\n“I wouldn’t have missed this one for anything,” Swisher said. “Each Derby has a different vibe and a different feeling … There is nothing in the world like this.”\n\n- Maggie Menderski\n\n2:10 p.m.: Wynonna Judd arrives to sing National Anthem\n\nWynonna Judd stepped into Churchill Downs wearing a full white suit and top hat, ready to perform the national anthem ahead of the big race.\n\n“I’m so excited,” Judd, who grew up in Ashland, told the Courier Journal on Friday during the Barnstable Brown Derby Eve Gala. “This is the 150th year. So, they knew who to pick in terms of patriotic and being a proud Kentuckian. It’s just number 1 on my list.”\n\nThe performance is scheduled for 5 p.m. and will be broadcast on NBC.\n\nPrevious singers of the national anthem at the Derby include Martina McBride, Rascal Flatts and Jo Dee Messina.\n\n- Amanda Hancock\n\n2 p.m.: 'So much more than I expected'\n\nRoberta Tengerdy of Sarasota, Florida, had come to the 150th Kentucky Derby as part of a girls trip. Her husband, Tom, hadn’t come along, but he was very present in her first Run for the Roses. He’d helped design her whole look. He’d gone to Hobby Lobby and bought an assortment of ribbons and flowers to embellish her hat. He fastened more than a two dozen flowers on the underside of the brim, and he’d bedazzled a cigar box style purse with pictures of cherubs, small flowers, pom poms and beading. Since he couldn’t come to the Derby with her, he tucked two roses — one for each of them — inside the interior pocket of her purse.Tengerdy was enjoying the view from the upper deck of the new paddock just before the seventh race of the day. The whole morning had just been wonderful, she said.“It’s just more than I could have ever imagined,” Tengerdy said of the experience. “I don’t know what I imagined, but it’s just so much more than I expected.”\n\n- Maggie Menderski\n\n1:35 p.m.: Health professionals on hand for Derby 150\n\nDominic Morales started his Kentucky Derby Day hours before the first horses ran in Race 1.\n\nMorales is one of half a dozen Norton Sports Health athletic trainers serving as trackside medical professionals available on race day.\n\nThis is the first year athletic trainers and physicians are required, as part of a regulation by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority. HISA is the agency that oversees the health and safety of horses with uniform rules across the thoroughbred racing industry.\n\nAthletic trainers, considered the health care professionals of sports sidelines, are at Churchill Downs to support the health care of jockeys, as well as also Derby 150 attendees. There are three first aid tents — in the clubhouse, the executive gate and the infield at the fourth turn — for basic first-aid care.\n\nMorales, a former collegiate AT, as well as Tiffany Haub, contributed in the creation of Churchill Down's emergency action plan, or what to do in the event of an emergency, which the world saw in action when Damar Hamlin collapsed during a Monday Night Football game in January 2023.\n\n- Stephanie Kuzydym\n\n1:20 p.m.: Travis Kelce spotted in crowd at Churchill Downs\n\nSuper Bowl Champion Travis Kelce is officially at Churchill Downs for the 150th Kentucky Derby — but so far there's no sign of global superstar girlfriend Taylor Swift.\n\nShortly after 1 p.m. Saturday, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end was seen arriving at the track, wearing a lightly-striped white suit, navy floral tie and coordinating navy hat, complete with a feather. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, a photo shows Kelce amid a sea of attendees.\n\nThere had been speculation for months over whether the NFL star and “Shake It Off” singer would saddle up and attend the \"Most Exciting Two Minutes in Sports.\"\n\n- Amanda Hancock\n\n1:10 p.m.: A crowing achievement for Derby 150\n\nChris Lowber is one of many people who went all out for 150 years of Derby. As Lowber walked around the infield, he wore a cardboard replica of the Twin Spires on top of his head to celebrate this year’s anniversary.\n\nIt isn't his first Kentucky Derby though and said he's been to many as a Louisville resident. Lowber said that he’s worn this replica for many years because he wants to embrace the festivities and celebrations.\n\nThe cardboard replica also features artwork from Lowbers’ students, and he said it took almost 10 hours to complete the piece. When asked how he wears the replica on his head all day, Lowber assured that he takes breaks.\n\nLike many Derby attendees, Lowber is placing his bet on tonight’s big race and hopes that Forever Young takes the Triple Crown.\n\n- Hannah Pinski\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was spotted at Churchill Downs for at least his third time at the historic track.\n\nThe Texas Republican previously attended the Kentucky Derby in 2016 after dropping out of that year’s presidential race. And he was back the next year with his wife, Heidi.\n\nIn a post on X, formerly Twitter, Cruz called the Derby “a great American tradition.”\n\n- Bailey Loosemore\n\n12:50 p.m.: 'It's just incredible'\n\nKen and Sandy Kunkel traveled to the Kentucky Derby to celebrate Ken’s 70th Birthday with Sandy’s wine group “The Swirl Girls.”“Thank you so much for coming to the party,” their group said, anytime someone spotted his birthday sash and wished Ken a “Happy Birthday!” He said he couldn’t ask for anything more for his birthday, but a kiss from his wife — who promptly gave him a smooch just outside the Clubhouse Gate. Ken felt “spoiled” for having such a wonderful birthday.\n\n“It’s the 150th and today is my 70th birthday,” he beamed, while holding a mint julep cup. “It’s just incredible.”\n\n- Maggie Menderski\n\n12:30 p.m.: Firefighter Bryce Carden honored at track\n\nTwo months after he helped rescue a woman from her truck as it dangled from the George Clark Memorial Bridge, Louisville firefighter Bryce Carden was honored at Churchill Downs ahead of the 150th Kentucky Derby.\n\nCarden was invited to the race as a special guest of WDRB-TV, which produced a presentation that played from the track's video boards Saturday morning.\n\nCarden is a member of Rescue Company 2, which responded to the bridge call around noon March 1. Authorities say Trevor Branham of Jeffersonville was driving a Chevrolet truck at an excessive speed and \"weaving in and out of traffic\" when he struck several vehicles on the bridge, including the tractor trailer that broke through the guardrail and hung over the Ohio River for about 40 minutes before its driver was rescued.\n\nWatch WDRB's presentation for Carden here.\n\n- Bailey Loosemore\n\nChurchill Downs Incorporated and NBC Sports on Saturday announced an extension of their partnership that will see the Kentucky Derby televised by NBC through 2032.\n\nNBC Sports first televised the Kentucky Derby in 2001.\n\n“As we celebrate the 150th running of the Kentucky Derby, Churchill Downs is proud to extend the relationship with NBC Sports,” Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen said. “As our media partner for the last 23 years, NBC has artfully captured the most exciting two minutes in sports and the spectacle of the senses that surrounds it.”\n\nThe extension includes multi-platform rights to the Kentucky Derby, Kentucky Oaks and Derby and Oaks Day programming, which will be presented on NBC, Peacock, USA Network and other NBCUniversal platforms.\n\nNational coverage of Saturday’s Kentucky Derby will begin at 2:30 p.m. on NBC and Peacock.\n\n- Jason Frakes\n\nDozens of famous faces are expected to walk the red carpet at Churchill Downs Saturday ahead of race time. Follow along with our reporters in the field.\n\nAlex Cooper, host for the “Call Her Daddy” podcast, and Alix Earle, the podcast host for “Hot Mess,” talked to Kentucky Derby attendees on the Infield’s main stage on Saturday morning. The two programs operate under the “Unwell” podcast network, and a few dozen people gathered around the stage to listen to their Q&A.\n\nIt was the first time coming to Derby for the two high-profile influencers and have been here throughout the week to interact with fans. Earl also attended the Sports Illustrated Revel at the Races party on Friday.\n\nEarle said she’s placing her bet on Sierra Leone as the Triple Crown winner, while Cooper said she still didn’t know where she would be placing her bets.\n\n- Hanna Pinski\n\nAndrea Canning of \"Dateline NBC\" was the first celebrity to walk the red carpet Saturday ahead of the big race. Canning said she loved the intimacy of the Barnstable Brown Derby Eve Gala on Friday night and wanted to get to Churchill Downs early Saturday to look at all the fashion.\n\n\"There have been some hits and misses but overall, the fashion is amazing,“ she said. “I am definitely investigating the fashion, not so much the horse racing.”\n\n- Kirby Adams\n\nDenise Bautista, of New Smyrna Beach, Florida, wore dress and purse made of fabric roses and a necklace featuring the Kentucky Derby symbol, as she stood in the Woodford Reserve Paddock Plaza just before the first race on Saturday. The Kentucky Derby has been around for more than half the history of this country, she explained, genuinely thrilled to be back beneath the iconic Twin Spires for this historic moment.\n\n\"You see first timers and old timers, and everybody has that look of just ‘oh my God, we’re here,’” she said. \"There’s nothing else like this in the country.\"\n\nA few years ago, Bautista lucked into Kentucky Derby tickets just two weeks before the event. She had always planned to go at least once in her life, but what she didn’t plan for was falling in love with Kentucky. This year marks her fourth Kentucky Derby. She and her husband have enjoyed Louisville, the bourbon culture and the Kentucky Derby so much over the past few years that they’re hoping to buy a home here.\n\nShe had traveled to Kentucky three other times this year to participate in festivities leading up to the 150 milestone.\n\n“If you miss some of that, you’re missing the warm-up to the event,” she said. “I love it, I actually talked him into it this year, we’re going to start looking for a place out here.”\n\n- Maggie Menderski\n\nSierra Leone was predicted to be the winner of the 150th Kentucky Derby during a special edition of Puppy Predictors on NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" on Friday.\n\nHost and comedian Jimmy Fallon, who will appear at Churchill Downs Saturday to help Ford give away a vehicle to a lucky fan, had to review slow camera footage since the race was tight between two puppies representing contenders Sierra Leone and Dornoch.\n\nEven though he was not the winner, Resilience, who Fallon described as “the longshot,” stole the comedian’s heart.\n\n“That is the most chill puppy I’ve ever seen in my life,” Fallon said of the pup. “I love you, Resilience.”\n\nCheck out the video here:\n\nJust hours ahead of the race, the National Weather Service in Louisville predicts Louisville has a 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly after 1 p.m and patchy fog before 10 a.m. Otherwise, skies will be mostly cloudy, with a high near 80 degrees. Calm wind becoming southwest 5 to 7 mph in the afternoon, according to the seven-day forecast.\n\nSaturday night has a 30% chance of showers and thunderstorms, mainly before 8 p.m. The area is expected to be partly cloudy, with a low around 64 degrees and a southwest wind around 6 mph.\n\nWhat to know about the 150th Kentucky Derby"
