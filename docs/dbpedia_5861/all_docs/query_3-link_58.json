        "text": "Among the many reasons to love the Kentucky Derby is the fashion. Whether you’re into fashion or not, the Kentucky Derby outfits play a big part in the atmosphere surrounding the race. Kentucky Derby fashion has become almost synonymous with the race itself, and year after year, thousands of Derby-goers meticulously plan their Kentucky Derby attire from head to toe.\n\nPlanning your Derby outfit is a fun part of the event’s tradition. In fact, Kentucky Derby outfits are often as talked about as the horse racing. With the Kentucky Derby taking place in the spring, it’s the perfect excuse to get dressed up in the latest spring fashions. Wondering what the attire requirements are or if there’s a Kentucky Derby dress code on race day? We’ve compiled some information below to help you out.\n\nHats\n\nOn Derby Day, the hats tend to be the focus. From elaborate wide brimmed headpieces to petite fascinators and from fedoras to top hats, there are plenty of fashionable options. In fact, many people plan their Derby outfits around their hat. If you fly into Louisville during Derby week, you’re likely to notice an abundance of hat boxes on the flight or being carried around in the airport. Some people even ship their hats to their hotel ahead of time. Many of the high-end hotels have pop-up hat boutiques where you can pick out the perfect hat when you arrive or add some extra flair to the one you brought.\n\nSpring Dresses and Seersucker Suits\n\nThere aren’t many sporting events where you actually get dressed to the nines but you’ll find plenty spectators get dressed up to witness the fastest two minutes in sports. Many will coordinate their hat with spring dresses or smart casual suits; Kentucky Derby dresses and suits are often in bright shades or pastel colors. If you’ve ever wanted to take a fashion risk with a bold outfit, Derby is a perfect opportunity. Seersucker suits are everywhere but you can’t go wrong with a classic navy blazer either.\n\nIn addition to the much-talked-about Kentucky Derby hats, bold jewelry or other accessories often complete the look. Derby weekend is an ideal time to dust off the cufflinks and that bowtie you never wear. Shoes are important too; you’ll be on your feet a lot during the day so it’s important to either wear something comfortable or bring a more comfortable option to change into later.\n\nThe Most Important Thing to Wear on Derby Day\n\nChoosing an outfit for the Kentucky Derby that shows off your personality is all part of the fun. While we love checking out all the unique and creative attire, there is one thing we recommend everyone wear on Derby Day: sunscreen! Sun protection is also a good reason to choose a wide-brimmed hat to complete your ensemble.\n\nOne last thing to consider is the weather forecast for the day. Be sure to come prepared for the conditions. In the off chance it’s a cool day, bringing extra layers is a good idea. If rain is a possibility, ponchos, rain boots, water-proof mascara and a rain cover for your hat may come in handy. Umbrellas are not permitted at the Kentucky Derby.\n\nIf you’re in Louisville for the Kentucky Derby, you may find yourself overwhelmed with all the things to see and do during the city’s biggest and most anticipated event. After many years of attending this unique event, we’ve nailed down our best pieces of advice for anyone planning to go for the first time. Much of it has been covered above already, here are a few more thoughts on how to get the most out of your Derby experience.\n\nCheck out the Paddock Area\n\nThis large, open space is a place to see and be seen, and while visitors can’t go in, they can get surprisingly close to the horses as they’re paraded through the paddock pre-race. It’s also a great location to photograph the spectacular hats and colorful outfits of the spectators.\n\nIn 2024, Derby-goers will have the opportunity for a unique paddock experience. The venue’s paddock area is currently undergoing a $200 million renovation and the spectacular new paddock experience is expected to be revealed as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations.\n\nCelebrities\n\nAs one of the top sporting events in the world, the Kentucky Derby always seems to attract a number of big names from the entertainment industry. For those hoping for a celebrity sighting, check out the Derby Red Carpet (usually found near the VIP gate) where many celebrities will walk on their way up to their seats. If you want to get even closer to the celebs, you may want to consider attending the Barnstable Brown Gala, the most exclusive event of the weekend.\n\nVIP Seating Options\n\nSpeaking of VIP seating, those seats aren’t just for celebrities. If you want the ultimate Derby experience, we can arrange for a spot for you in one of the premium viewing areas including Millionaires Row, the Stakes Room, and the new Homestretch Club. If you simply want to make sure you have a covered seat to protect you from the elements, our team can advise on which sections will best suit your needs.\n\nFood and Drink\n\nNo visit to Louisville would be complete without two things: sipping a mint julep and having a hot brown: an open-faced sandwich with sliced turkey, bacon and mornay sauce. As far as we’re concerned, there’s no better place to try your first mint julep than at Churchill Downs during the Kentucky Derby. As for the Hot Brown, we suggest trying the original at the historic Brown Hotel, one of our luxury properties.\n\nLouisville has a great selection of wonderful restaurants to indulge in during Derby week though you’ll want to plan early. Popular eateries book up well in advance of Derby week. If you’d like some recommendations, we go into detail on some of our favorite Louisville restaurants here.\n\nExperience Thurby\n\nA popular event with locals, Thursday at Churchill Downs (aptly named Thurby) offers a different experience than Friday or Saturday. There are races, of course, and there are also musical performances and other entertainment acts. Thurby also provides guests with a great opportunity to explore Churchill Downs before the main event on Saturday.\n\nPlan Early\n\nIf you are hoping to attend the Kentucky Derby, we encourage you to plan early. We are seeing increased interest in this event and travelers are booking earlier than usual. Booking early gives you the best opportunity to secure your preferred Derby seating and accommodations.\n\nThe upcoming Kentucky Derby will be run on May 3, 2025.
