STEP stands for Short Term Exchange Program. It is where during the summer, a high school student from here is matched up with a student from over there. The students take turns, traveling from their home country to stay with the other's family for 2-4 week stretch. Elsa is from La FlÃ¨che France and has been staying with Wren and her family for the past two weeks. She has been shown the marvelous sights around La Crosse and been with the family on their trip to Grand Marais Minnesota. In a couple weeks it will be Wren's turn to stay with Elsa's family in France and experience their culture. We applaud these young women for their courage to step out of the box to find adventure and new experiences. As Mark Twain so famously said- \"Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all oneâs lifetime.â\n\nThe evening of Sunday June 9th, was special for the Holmen Area Rotary Club. We met with the Rotary Friendship Exchange group from Poland at Halfway Creek Park for barbeque and to get acquainted. Barry Ploessl broke more than a sweat cooking his epic brisket, ribs and pulled pork for everyone to nosh on. It was amazing! The group got into town on Friday and it was like Ferris Buehler's day off, as they did literally everything the last three days- Guadalupe Shrine, Mississippi Queen Dinner excursion, water skiing, pontoon boat float, International Garden tour, Rotary Lights tour, Rotary on the Go Mobile Clinic presentation, Pettibone lunch, Moxies, Elmaro Winery, Catfish Days Parade, the Trempealeau Hotel, (There's more but I am forgetting some of it) and then a barbecue with the club. I hope we didn't break any of them. At the end of the meal a representative from each one of the four clubs present stood up and gave a short description of what their club has been working on in their communities. Representing Poland was Rotary Club of Szczecin, Rotary Club of Poznan, Rotary Club of Bydgoszcz Stare Miasto and Rotary Club of Olsztyn Varmia. A common theme throughout was the war in Ukraine and how the clubs were responding to the great need of the recent refugees now living with them. A very special group and we are glad to have met them. It is with a heavy heart we say \"till next time'\" to our new friends as they fly back home.\n\nAt Wednesday, June 28th's Holmen Area Rotary Club's Annual year end picnic, members reflected on last year's successes, transferred leadership to the new president and heard about what the next year might bring.

My family went through a hard time when my mother was sick and our community wrapped their hands around us and made sure we had a Christmas. Iâll never forget the feeling of coming home to garbage bags of presents on our doorstep.\n\nRecently I let my Holmen Rotary Club know of my want to do this I had 10 volunteers come up to me to help. Next, I reached out to Aubrey & Karen at the HACC and they quickly joined forces with our club and made all of this come together. I have shed a few thankful tears over this.\n\nIf you have it in your heart to help get these families what they need this Christmas please see below.\n\n*Stop into the HACC during open hours and grab a tag or two.\n\nMon - Thurs 7:00- 4:30 and Fri 7:00-3:00\n\n*Bring back the gift by Dec. 12th with your tag attached and leave your gift unwrapped under the tree.

The units are being given out to Holmen Ace Hardware & Rental, Be Fit Gym, The Holmen Area Community Center, Features Holmen and Drugan's Castle Mound Golf Course. Kelly Dunn, HARC Project Coordinator kicked off the event by explaining the program and how it came about. Dr. Carrie Travis followed up, explaining how her graduating nursing students from Winona State became involved, canvasing the community, updating the Pulse Point AED App and making recommendations as to possible AED sites. Patrick Corran, the La Crosse Fire Department's Community Risk Educator stood up and expressed appreciation for the AED efforts and stressed the importance of having AEDs readily available. Dr. Cheri Olson, Chair of the 7 Rivers Cardiac Arrest Preparedness and Education (CAPE) built on Patrick's message, stating that there are over 300,000 heart attacks a year and is one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. If someone has a heart attack and there is no AED available there is only a 5-10% chance of survival. But in areas with AEDs available and systems in place to speed treatment the survival rate rises to 40-50%. Every minute delay in responding to a heart attack leads to a 10% decline in recovery rate. Dr. Olson shared that her life had been saved in 2008 by a quick response and an AED. One of CAPE's missions is education and they will be participating with the Holmen Community Center on May 25th and 26th in basic CPR and how to utilize an AED. There are four more units for the Holmen Area are to be awarded in May. Applications need to be in to HARC by 5/1\n\nDid you know that each year the Holmen Area Rotary Club provides Scholarships to graduating seniors of Holmen High School?

According to the Pulse Point App there are 20 AEDs located in Holmen Area schools, some churches and other area businesses. The Holmen Area Rotary Club has established a new grant program that would significantly reduce the cost of buying an AED. The goal is to encourage more businesses to have one of these life saving devices available at their place of business. The Holmen Area Rotary Club is partnering with a group of Nursing Students from Winona State University to assist in updating current AED location information and encourage businesses to install an AED into their facilities. Businesses located in the Holmen School District can indicate their interest in obtaining a AED by 5/1/2022. If selected to receive an AED, they would receive a unit, a wall cabinet and signage at no cost from by the Holmen Area Rotary Club.\n\nMore info go to https://holmenarearotary.org/page/aed-grant-program\n\nIt would be a good idea to load the Pulsepoint App into your phone so that you can home into the closest AED in an emergency.

They were here to update the club on the current status of the Rotary on the Go project. Rotary on the Go is a collaborative effort by 10 of the local Rotary clubs to expand St Clare's health services by providing them with a mobile clinic. St Clare Health Mission utilizes volunteers to provide health care to the working poor, homeless, immigrants and uninsured. Basically, the population that has fallen through the cracks. They operate a free clinic on Ferry Street in La Crosse but not everyone who needs care can get there. With local Rotary donations, community participation, international partners and the magic of matching funds, the clubs were able to raise the $240K needed to purchase a rolling clinic with 2 exam rooms and all the amenities to provide remote care. The clinic is being constructed and is estimated to be ready come May 2022. The plan is to utilize the clinic in remote areas of Trempealeau, Monroe, Vernon and Houston County. This expanded avenue of care provides future opportunities for Rotary involvement as the project will require drivers, durable medical equipment, interpreters and medical professionals. And there will be continued operating costs to keep it rolling. The clubs that are involved are Holmen Area Rotary Club, Rotary Club of Caledonia, La Crescent Rotary Club, Rotary Club of La Crosse-After Hours, Rotary Club of La Crosse - Valley View, Onalaska Hilltopper Rotary Club, Rotary Club of La Crosse East, Rotary Club of La Crosse Downtown, Sparta Rotary and Rotary Club of Onalaska.

Thursday October 8th, Alex Goodman and Adam Fleis delivered the remaining beds to their intended recipients. The excitement from the Children and Familyâs when they showed up was incredible. The euphoria of giving fills a void that is so desperately needed right now.\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club started this project the middle of last year. The School District of Holmen identified children in need of a bed and provided this list to the Holmen Area Rotary Club. The club stepped up and using club manpower, donated funds, materials and district grants to provide a total of 42 beds for those community children in need. The beds were a mix of bunk, twin and queen size beds depending on the need. Queen size beds were required in some instances where the room size did not allow two twin beds. Each bed included a custom built headboard, frame, new box spring and mattress combo, linens, blanket and a pillow. A special thank you to those area vendors that helped with the effort - to the folks at King Furniture in Holmen for supplying the box springs and mattresses at their cost, for Ameridown and Beer By Bike Brigade for providing the pillows and Wisconsin Building Supply for a portion of the lumber used for the headboards. The special Rotary emblem was burned into the headboards by Tulips and Treasures out of Arcadia.\n\nThough the initial project has been completed, the need continues and HARC will revisit this issue in the coming months and assess where it can help.\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club took advantage of the sunny weekend weather and spent Saturday morning picking up trash along Holmen Drive. Twice a year, the HARC comes out and picks up litter along route 35 from the 53 interchange, south to Schnick road. The Holmen High School Interact Club also showed up in force and we were done in no time. Thank you to all who took time out of their weekend to make Holmen a better place!\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club put together a small team to build beds. The beds consist of a unique headboard, frame, new mattress, bedding and a pillow. The beds are destined for children in the Holmen area that do not have one. The list of those in need is provided by the\n\nSchool District of Holmen. Delivery date for the beds is yet to be determined.\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club was glad to host Rotary District 6250 Governor Bill Pritchard at their August 12th meeting. Bill is a Holmen native and this was his 285th club visit. Bill went on to explain the theme for the year \"Rotary Opens Opportunities\". With today's Covid challenges we have been forced to change how we do things. This has not been all bad. Take the ZOOM meeting for instance, Rotary meetings are now accessible to folks that weren't able to make it before. Even holding room and ZOOM hybrid meetings open the door to new participants. Membership has still remained strong and increased in some ways. Dealing with the virus has made us become more creative in solving problems, like how the HARC Service Auction went from a room full of people to an online format. His suggestion was to now dust off the club's strategic plan and ask; \"Why do we exist?\" and \" What do you do?\" given the changing environment. Bill also talked about After Hours member David Knutson, who was the ultimate Rotarian. David would not say no whenever the need for serve arose He believed that saying YES to service leads to a happy life. Bill had asked all the clubs in the district to identify the member that most exemplified David's Rotary spirit. HARC's Executive committee chose Scott Ryan as the YES recipient. Scott generously donates his time, was a past president, is uber involved in the youth exchange program, RYLA and Interact. Scott received a plaque with the Ben Franklin quote \" What good shall I do this day?\" Congratulations Scott!

We enjoyed meeting all the people in the Onalaska/Holmen area who came . Holmen Rotarians Judy, Art, and Vicki (and many others who served) had a great time! A big thank you! to all that helped, Town and Country Title and those that came out to dine with others on this thanksgiving.\n\nSaturday November 2nd was an incredible day. So many things going on.

Way to go La Crosse Area Rotary's.\n\n'2 little monkeys , jumping on the bed' - Well, first you have to have a bed! The Holmen Area Rotary Club was doing their part in putting together beds for children that currently have no bed to sleep in. The Holmen School District identified those children in need and Rotary responded. The beds come with custom headboard, mattress and box spring, pillows and bedding. The materials and funds to pull it off came from donations, Wisconsin Building Supply, Holmen Rotary Funds, a Rotary Foundation grant and Holmen's Hope.Just a preview of our incredible day! On Saturday, a Rotary crew delivered 19 beds to families in the Holmen school district! The tears of joy, the hugs, high fives and genuine gratitude was amazing!\n\nCapping off an amazing day of giving!!! Beds for kids who don't have them, Food for people who need it!

Don't despair. Now you can pump them with air at Holmen's new bike repair stations. The Holmen Area Rotary Club has donated 2 self contained repair stations that have recently been installed in the Village of Holmen parks. Each stand features an air pump with gauge, bike stand, screwdrivers, metric hex wrenches and special open end wrenches to fix most ride related maladies. One has been installed at the start of the Half-way Creek bicycle trail, right behind the Holmen Library and the other one has been installed in Deerwood Park next to the ball diamonds. Ride On!\n\nToday, September 25th, the Holmen Area Rotary Club received a Rotary Foundation grant of $5000 towards their bed project. The School District of Holmen has identified 35 children in the district in need of a bed to sleep in. HARC, with the help of Wisconsin Building Supply are planning to build the required bed frames. To complete the project with mattresses and bedding, money from the grant along with donations from Holmen's Hope and others will allow the project to be completed.

Accepting the grant from Rotary Foundation members Liz Evans and Laura Milner are HARC members Alex Goodman and Adam Fleis.\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club recently received 2 awards at the Avenues of Service Dinner at the new La Crescent Area Event Center last Tuesday evening. Every year, the nine regional La Crosse Area Rotary Clubs get together and acknowledge the clubs in the area that have created programs that have excelled at moving Rotary's goals forward. Holmen Area Rotary was awarded the Club Service trophy for their successful Service Auction and another trophy for Vocational Service with their STRIVE student mentoring program. Judy McHugh, fundraising chair accepted the award for the Service Auction and Scott Ryan, Youth Coordinator accepted the trophy for STRIVE. The individual club Rotarian of the Year Award recipients were also honored. Holmen's own Scott Marshall was present for the tribute. Thank you! to the members that have put in the time and effort to create these most excellent award winning programs.\n\nThe August 17th Holmen Kornfest Parade was a blast. HARC busted out the spinning wheel float sporting new paint (thanks Scott and Kathy!) and banners. There had to be a few thousand people lining the parade route. A couple of bushels of candy were handed out to the kids. (couldn't throw it this year ). This slowed down the walkers that then had to do a Kornfest 1.5K fun run to get back to the float and restock. The kids were like piranha - give one piece out and you were swarmed by others wanting some too. And you didn't want to disappoint any. Along the route hairy faced folk were accosted with Battle of the Beards information for HARCs upcoming beard fest November 30th.\n\nInfo on the Holmen Community Garden was passed out to get people interested in coming out. Best time too, as the harvest is peaking. At the end of the parade route both the candy and the parade walkers were totally exhausted. A really fun event, with smiles and laughs all around.\n\nAt the July 17th HARC meeting, the club met this year's Short Term Exchange Students. The Rotary Short term exchange program joins interested youth in a low intensity exchange situation that is part vacation-part education. The student is paired up with another individual from a distant country. The home student's family hosts the distant student for 3-4 weeks and then the home student travels to the distant student's home for 3-4 weeks. Students have a chance to share their culture and also learn about how other people around the world live, work and play. The Short Term Exchange Program gives the students a little taste of what the year long Youth Exchange Program may be like. Programs like this make the world smaller with every exchange.\n\nThis years participants are Holmen Interacters Hailey Bruegger and Chloe Lichucki who are sharing their homes with Laia Aibar Vidal from Miranda de Ebro Spain and Maria Blanco from Barcelona Spain. They were coming to the end of the home visit and would be traveling soon to Spain for the second portion of the program. Their description of what they had done the past couple of weeks sounded like a version of Ferris Buehlers Day Off, with lots to do and plenty of adventure. Welcome to America Laia and Maria!\n\nAt today's HARC meeting we said so long to Kajus Bjorkroth, the club's 2018-2019 inbound youth exchange student. Kajus has been with us here in the states for almost 11 months. Kajus will be heading to Grand Rapids over the weekend to a gathering of all inbound and next semester's outbound students. Then it is back to Pargas Finland to see if his folks will still recognize him. We are all much richer to have experienced Kajus's fun loving wit and stoic Nordic presence. We wish him well and safe travels!\n\nA short video of a recent Clean Water project in Peru. Holmen Rotary participated with Rotary Club of Lakewood Ranch and several other clubs to help bring clean, safe water to this community. Please check out the video to see how a small amount of money from our club helped make a big difference in the lives of the 100 families in Ivan Vasquez community. It's well worth the 90 seconds out of your day.\n\nThe Holmen Area Rotary Club's April 4th Thursday Night Service Auction was unforgettable! Dynamic MC Dustin Luecke and fast talking Auctioneer Alex Goodman kept every one on the edge of their chairs and the laughs coming as they peddled the unique services the club was offering. For the live auction, members offered everything from a summer of lawn mowing, sailboat excursions, plane rides, meals on wheels, custom jewelry, custom smoked meats, paddlewheel party packages, internet marketing service, signed football helmet, car cleaning, Limo Service to a whiskey and cigar extravaganza. The Gourmet Cakes did not disappoint this year and were deeelicious!\n\nThere were plenty of activities besides the live auction to keep folks occupied. 20 bucks bought you 20 chances to win one of the many interesting and valuable baskets. Or for just 20 bucks you could have won over $1300 in Holmen Business gift certificates. For a measly $10 bucks you had 7 chances to throw a ring over a bottle of Dom or MGD, depending on your skill (or luck). And for $5 you could get into a 50/50 raffle to win a quick $130. The food was fantastic and plentiful and the drinks cold and tasty. The live auction ended by selling handmade friendship bracelets created by Justin Bodin. All proceeds from the bracelet sale will go to Casa Hogar Orphanage in Peru. Thank you to all that came out and supported the Holmen Area Rotary Club! We hope to see you next year! If you could not make it this year you missed a very fun event. We hope to see you too!"
