        "text": "The pedigree\n\nDarren grew up in the bluegrass of Kentucky, so creating his art is more than just a production; it’s a way of putting a little of himself and his love for his home state into every client’s piece. Much like the pedigrees of the amazing horses themselves, Darren’s story runs deep with the rolling hills and horse farms of the commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\nThe Pomp\n\nThere are few sporting events in the world quite like the races, where culture and personality combine in individual fashion. From the elegant to the audacious, there is something to be found at the track for everyone. It is our pleasure to play a part in helping each person demonstrate their love for the horses in their own unique and individual way.\n\nTHE preservation\n\nWe are convinced of the value of remembering, whether you’re remembering the attending of an event or your own horse’s trip to the winner’s circle. We are honored to have the opportunity to work closely with our clients to create custom pieces, turning their unique vision into a piece of fine jewelry that they can truly treasure for a lifetime.\n\nDarren started painting at a young age, taking the natural environment as his subject. This formed an important foundation for the jewelry artist he would become. To this day, he initiates each new work with a sketch to capture the full sense of depth and perspective. He also incorporates sculptural elements consisting of multiple pieces finely formed and finished into a strikingly dynamic whole.\n\nHis work has been bought by discerning clients from around the world, and is featured in the Kentucky Derby Museum, in Louisville, KY as well as at The Keeneland Store, in Lexington KY.\n\nRecently, Darren was honored as a finalist for his high quality workmanship in the Keeneland Masters of Craft Awards!\n\nContact Us\n\nAt Darren K. Moore, we don’t have an answering service or a staff on the phones. When you call or email us, you’ll hear back from either Darren or Julie. Please be patient with us as we are responding in the order we receive inquiries, but know that we can’t wait to hear your story and how we can help create something to remember it by! Please call 877-238-2546 today. Or by email: info@darrenkmoore.com\n\nIt takes a team to make great art. Darren is joined in his work and his life by his wife Julie. Julie manages many aspects of the work, and clients often have direct contact with her. Their caring and commitment together has earned a loyal following of enthusiasts who appreciate the beauty and sincerity of everything they offer."
