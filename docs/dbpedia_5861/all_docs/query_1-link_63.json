        "text": "It’s officially August, which means big things over here at Veronica Vale Art: On August 5th, I celebrated 4 years of business! I can hardly believe that four years has passed since that nerve-wracking first launch, but I’m eternally grateful for the fun, adventurous journey its led to. Thank you all so much for making this dream of being a full-time artist possible.\n\nAs summer unfolds, I am filled with inspiration as I envision the perfect settings for my artwork. This reflection has deepened my appreciation for the stunning spaces my pieces already adorn. I’m excited to share a new collection of in situ photographs, showcasing my art in its beautiful new homes since the last “Art in Situ” update.\n\nI’m excited to announce a new retail location for my work: FireLight Book and Candle in beautiful Blowing Rock, NC. This beautiful new storefront in downtown Blowing Rock sells bestselling books and hand poured, small batch candles in a gorgeously curated, cozy setting right off of Main St. I’m proud to have a few of my original paintings and limited edition prints for sale in this storefront.\n\nWell, it’s official: this baby is good luck! Thank you so much, Blowing Rock Chamber of Commerce, for this Award of Distinction at July's Art in the Park in Blowing Rock, NC. I’m feeling so honored and encouraged by the recognition and reception my work has received this year.\n\nThank you, Haleigh Nicole Photography, for the Blue Ridge mountain maternity shoot of our dreams. As an artist myself, I’m all the more appreciative of the time, energy, and skill that goes into a creative business. I see these photos as works of art that my family will cherish for a lifetime, reminding us of all of the love and excitement we felt in anticipation of meeting our baby boy.\n\nIt’s always a privilege to get to show my work in beautiful Blowing Rock, NC. This time, it was an especial honor thanks to an award from Blowing Rock’s Art in the Park. Winning this award was the cherry on top of a gorgeous day: from beautiful, sunny weather, bustling streets, and high end fine art.\n\nThe Sidewalk Art Show in Roanoke, VA is consistently one of our favorite events of the year, and for good reason. The Taubman Museum of Art in this beautiful mountain city hosts one of the most fun, uplifting art fairs we’ve had the honor to exhibit in. The people here in Roanoke are always so kind, friendly, and welcoming, and it’s such a delight to strengthen those connections year after year.\n\nAs the recipient of the Paul Ostaseski Memorial Award at the 2022 Sidewalk Art Show, I was asked to present my work, process, inspiration, and studio to the Taubman Museum of Art, in a conversation facilitated by their Executive Director Cindy Petersen. You can now watch this presentation along with the Q&A from the Taubman Museum’s board and patrons here.\n\nArtsplosure in Raleigh, NC always has a way of feeling like a homecoming for me. Now in 2024, I was honored to exhibit at Artsplosure once again. Seeing the reception that my new work has received by so many new and returning collectors, I’m feeling all the more grateful for your continued support and the space and encouragement you’ve given me to continuously change and evolve.\n\nDreamy and ethereal, soft and sweet, these works represent my own personal journey in this stage of life - one that I hope will pull at a universal string within us all and resonate with you specifically, my beloved collector. Find all 14 original paintings and 4 new limited edition prints now in the Shop.\n\nOur first art fair of 2024, Spring Daze Arts Festival in Cary, NC, was everything we could have hoped it to be: beautiful weather, great crowds, a fun atmosphere, and a real and apparent love and enthusiasm for the arts. I was so excited to see two original works and countless open and limited edition prints find their homes in the Triangle.\n\nAs we welcome the Spring season, I've been captivated by visions of where my art might find its perfect setting. This reflection has deepened my gratitude for the beautiful spaces my work already graces. Here, I've gathered a selection of my favorite in situ photographs showcasing my art in its dreamlike homes since the last addition of “Art in Situ.”\n\nBeen working on our little masterpiece, arriving August 2024 ✨ Earlier this year, I took a short break to rest and recover from the busy year, but what I didn’t reveal was that I was also secretly resting from my first trimester of pregnancy! This past December, my husband and I found out we were pregnant with our first child, and we’ve been buzzing with delight and excitement ever since.\n\nReblogged from CanvasRebel: We recently reconnected with Veronica Vale and are excited to share our conversation. Hi Veronica, thanks for joining us today. Earning a full time living from one’s creative career can be incredibly difficult. can you share some of the key parts of your journey and any important advice or lessons that might help creatives who haven’t been able to yet?\n\nI offer my heartfelt gratitude to my collectors for not only welcoming my work into their lives and homes, but for also graciously sending in these in situ pictures. It gives me such renewed purpose in the studio, knowing that each piece that I pour my heart into will be cherished in some perfect space for years to come.\n\nThis was the year of so many new beginnings and experiences, and I can’t wait to keep that momentum flowing into the new year. These reflections on the year can be so valuable. I hope this New Year, you take some time for quiet reflection to be proud of and content with all you have done and all you have become. Wishing you all a happy, hopeful, self-compassionate New Year!\n\nIf you, too, are already dreaming of the next occasion to celebrate the ones you love, then this Holiday Gift Guide is for you. I’ve curated a few of my favorite art gifts to surprise your loved ones with this holiday season, from precious stocking stuffers to big, heartwarming presents for under the tree. Thank you, sincerely, for shopping small, shopping local, and supporting artists like me.\n\nThe MBA Art Show in Nashville, TN last weekend was our first indoor art show, and it was run so beautifully, we were blown away. The organizers were so friendly, organized, and professional, it made the whole weekend feel like an art retreat. This was only our second time in Nashville and it reminded us what a fun, beautiful city it is. Now we’re all the more eager to return!\n\nWe 🤍 Ardmore Art Walk! Every year, Ardmore Art Walk reminds us why we love our home so much. This year, it felt like home more than ever before. That’s because, not only is Ardmore Art Walk the event that inspired me to pursue art fairs full-time a little over two years ago, but it’s now the event that allowed me to exhibit alongside my mother for the first time ever.\n\nLet me introduce you to my inspiration in life and art: my momma. My parents’ home is overflowing with the brilliant works of art my mom has created throughout the years. It’s always caused me heartache that the world has never seen them. So this year, it was time to change that…\n\nThis past weekend’s RiverArtsFest in Memphis, Tennessee was the furthest from home we’ve traveled for an art fair, and what an adventure it was! Setting up along the Mississippi River with the aqua water at our backs and Beale Street a few blocks over, we felt like we were in a whole other world. We were delighted by the beauty of the Mid-South and the high caliber art of the RiverArtsFest.\n\nI’m still swooning over the Bethesda Row Arts Festival! At this October’s Bethesda Row Arts Festival, we met so many wonderful new collectors, artists, and friends. My fellow artists were as kind and talented as could be and the collectors that we met were some of the lovelies, most art-educated people we’ve encountered.\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to exhibit in many beautiful places, but the Neptune Festival Art Show in Virginia Beach, VA just might take the cake. Spending the weekend by the sea, dolphin spotting and sailboat watching feels enough in and of itself. I’m so delighted that four original pieces found their homes here at the beach as well as so many fine art prints.\n\nThank you to everyone who came out to this year’s Festival in the Park and showed us once again why it’s one of our favorite events of the year! I’m so grateful to each and every one of you for inviting my work into your homes. 11 original paintings found their homes in the Queen City as well as countless prints.\n\nThis September’s Art Crush was like a downtown block party of art, music, and yummy food. I’ve loved seeing how The Arts District of Winston Salem is revitalizing the downtown arts scene with Art Crush every third Friday of the month, breathing new life into the Arts District with talented fellow vendors and enthusiastic patrons.\n\nWe already had high hopes for this weekend, but Cary exceeded them, making this year’s Lazy Daze Arts & Crafts Festival one of our best art fairs yet! Thank you so much to our new Cary collectors for your fine art purchases, print sales, kind words, and infectiously cheerful energy.\n\nI’m thrilled to introduce a brand new body of work, “Daydreams.” Each work is created with acrylic paint, gold leaf, and a high gloss epoxy resin top coat to keep your spirits sky high and your head in the clouds. These three new soft, atmospheric works are just the beginning of a new style and direction for my work, and I couldn’t be more excited about all the dreamy possibilities.\n\nThis summer, I spent much of my time in the Blue Ridge Mountains for my Edgewood Cottage Artist Residency and for three Blowing Rock Art in the Park events. My time spent there resulted in a plethora of reference photos, experiences, and memories to draw on for more new paintings celebrating the High Country. Find the new additions to the series here in the Blog or in the Shop now.\n\nWell, that’s a wrap on our Blowing Rock summer, and what a summer it was! Having an excuse to camp up in the mountains made this summer’s Art in the Park events and Edgewood Cottage Artist Residency worth it in and of itself. Now taking into consideration all of our new collectors, connections, and friends, and I’d say this was one of our best summers yet.\n\nThis past weekend, on August 5th, I celebrated three years of being a full-time artist! Reflecting on this milestone, I wanted to share a few lessons I’ve learned along the way. So for any other aspiring artists, creatives, and dreamers, here are the top 3 lessons I’ve learned in 3 years as a full-time artist:"
