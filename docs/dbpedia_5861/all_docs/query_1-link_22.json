        "text": "That's progress! In 1954 Roger Bannister became the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. His time -- 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. When Bannister ran his historic race, I love how the stadium announcer added drama to the event by teasing the crowd by delaying his announcement of Bannister's race time for as long as possible: \"Ladies and gentlemen, here is the result of event nine, the one mile: first, number forty one, R. G. Bannister, Amateur Athletic Association and formerly of Exeter and Merton Colleges, Oxford, with a time which is a new meeting and track record, and which‚Äîsubject to ratification‚Äîwill be a new English Native, British National, All-Comers, European, British Empire and World Record. The time was three...\" The roar of the crowd drowned out the rest of the announcement! Interestingly, after all those years of runners attempting to run a sub four minute mile, Bannister's record stood for only 46 days before being broken by a runner named John Landy. But I think the most interesting part of the four minute mile story is that in 2023, there were 165 NCAA runners who ran sub four minute miles. That's progress! Business is the same as the runner's story. We need to learn more, be more efficient, and continue to do better, and be better, than we were the year before. And sometimes we need someone to show us what is possible! #leadership #progress\n\nGuess what I spotted at Dunedin airport? The Black Jersey What does this Jersey mean? It depends who you ask I imagine To teams that play the All Blacks they probably know that they‚Äôre going to be in for a battle To NZ rugby players it‚Äôs what most aspire to become, to put that black jersey on or perhaps to create a legacy or to honour that legacy of all the greats that played before them and leave it in a better place once they have moved on. The one thing that everyone can learn from is the standards that the All Blacks set is a continual drive for excellence and that winning is everything. In an age where participation is rewarded without the pressure to get a result, have we become to soft and accepting of ‚Äú AVERAGE or PARTICIPATION MEDALS?‚Äù You either create a focus on winning or a focus on participation. Which one do you prefer? Is the focus on winning to outdated? Be great to get your comments. Do you agree? #sales #salestraining #salestrainer\n\nEver wondered what it takes to craft a rugby player into an exceptional defender? How tough is the journey to mold an outstanding defender on the rugby field? What are the secret ingredients that forge a great tackler, capable of shutting down opponents with precision and finesse? How quickly can we turn the tide and elevate their defensive competence? The truth may surprise you. While the task may seem daunting, the roadmap to defensive excellence unveils itself through strategic steps and targeted training. If the art of crafting formidable defenders intrigues you drop us a direct message with your thoughts, questions, or even struggles you might be facing.

I say lose but in fact we didn‚Äôt even show up. Surely they must have wanted it and done all the prep and I know they can play brilliant football as I‚Äôve seen it at times throughout the season. So how come on this day when it really mattered, with so much at stake did they fail. They are professionals and this is their game so how could it go so miraculously wrong. Was it nerves and the occasion? Could they sense the pressure and the tension from the crowd? Did they actually want it enough? Where was the sense of team? What did the manager, their leader, say to them at half time? I had hoped that we would come out looking a much better side after a team talk but we didn‚Äôt. Should he have made earlier changes when they just didn‚Äôt settle into a rhythm before there was no time to make a comeback? I am sure many will be analysing, and questioning and working out what happened and I guess now that‚Äôs all we can do. Accept the defeat, learn the lessons and make the difference next season. At work, my team and I are focussed on being accountable, being consistent, sweating the small stuff, and when things go wrong, learning from failure. Oh and most importantly, working together as a team! Hopefully next season Bolton will learn the lessons; focus on the team, be consistent week in week out, stop dropping those easy points and secure automatic promotion so we are not left with one game and so much riding on it.
