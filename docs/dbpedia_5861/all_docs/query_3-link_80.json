        "text": "Looking back: Eight Belles honored at memorial ceremony at Churchill Downs\n\nNote: Delaware horse Eight Belles was euthanized at the Kentucky Derby in 2008 after breaking both front legs. This story ran in The News Journal on Saturday, Sept. 6, 2008.\n\nThoroughbred owner Rick Porter of Wilmington expects emotions will be running high on Sunday during a memorial ceremony for Eight Belles in the Kentucky Derby Museum Garden just outside Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.\n\nThe memorial will begin at 2 p.m.\n\nEight Belles, owned by Porter and trained by Larry Jones, collapsed as she was galloping out after finishing second to Big Brown in the Kentucky Derby on May 3. The filly, ridden by Delaware Park jockey Gabriel Saez, broke both front ankles and was euthanized on the track.\n\nPorter, his wife Betsy, Jones, his wife and assistant trainer Cindy Jones, and Corey York, the personal groom for Eight Belles, will attend the ceremony.\n\nPorter, his wife Betsy, Jones, his wife and assistant trainer Cindy Jones, and Corey York, the personal groom for Eight Belles, will attend the ceremony.\n\nPorter said he thinks about Eight Belles every day.\n\n\"Whether you are having something like this for a human or a horse, it's obviously going to be emotional,\" he said. \"Her ashes have actually been interred in a little casket we had made.\"\n\nThe Porter family will unveil a plaque, donated by Churchill Downs, honoring the champion 3-year-old. The plaque will be mounted under a magnolia tree where the filly's remains have been interred.\n\n\"She is actually buried right as you walk out of the museum,\" said Porter.\n\nPorter and Jones will speak at the ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony will end as a local bell choir performs \"Candle in the Wind.\"\n\nWith her runner-up finish, she became just the 10th filly to finish among the top three in the Derby.\n\nEight Belles broke her maiden with her only win as a 2-year-old on Oct. 30, 2007, at Delaware Park. She also had two seconds and a third in five starts in 2007.\n\n\"Eight Belles seemed to give me a look at the Keeneland sales that begged me to be her owner,\" said Porter, who purchased Eight Belles for $375,000 at the sale. \"We will never forget her kind disposition. Now, she will rest in a place of honor and her story will be shared with visitors from around the world at the Kentucky Derby Museum.\"\n\nPorter said he has heard people from as far away as Europe will attend the memorial.\n\nPorter said Churchill Downs plans to videotape the ceremony and post it on YouTube.\n\n\"It's still a very sad story, but we are grateful to Churchill Downs for making this possible,\" said Porter. \"Eight Belles is the only horse buried there that is not a Derby winner.\"\n\nEight Belles won all four of her starts in 2008 before the Derby, including the Grade II Fantasy and the Grade III Honeybee at Oaklawn Park (Ark.).\n\nThe Thoroughbred Charities of America (TCA) established an Eight Belles Memorial Fund shortly after the Derby. Donations, made in her name, will go toward the retraining of thoroughbreds for secondary careers and research into catastrophic breakdowns.\n\nTo donate, call (859) 312-5531.
