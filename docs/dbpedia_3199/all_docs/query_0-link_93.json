        "text": "Ernest Alexander Howatt MacKinnon (98), after living a fulfilled life, passed peacefully on July 18, 2024 in New Smyrna Beach, FL. Affectionally known as Ernie, he was a pillar of stoicism and strength to his family and to all those who knew him.\n\nErnest was born January 23, 1926 in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada and grew up in Prince Edward Island, Canada. In his youth, he moved with his mother to New York and then returned to Canada to study engineering at the Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, Canada. He enlisted in the United States Army to serve in World War II in 1946. He was a proud member of the 11th Airborne Division stationed in Yamoto, Japan, and was in the parachute division that jumped out of C-47s. On his tours of Japan during rest, Ernest skied the mountains of Hokkaido.\n\nAfter honorable discharge from the Army in 1949, he returned to the US and held various jobs at Bulova Watch, Ford Instrument, Sperry Rand, and worked on the space program contracts for Northrup Grumman. Ernest founded his own business in the 1960s as a government engineering design and supplier.\n\nErnest married the love of his life on June 24, 1960 and became a loving and doting father to Maureen and Kevin. Throughout their many years of marriage, Ernest and Marie traveled extensively throughout the US and Europe, and especially cherished visiting their extended relatives in Scotland. After living in New Windsor, NY, Ernest and Marie moved to New Smyrna Beach, FL and found the loving Sea Woods community.\n\nThroughout his remarkable journey, Ernest was an engaged and active leader in his community. He served as a Free Mason in Queens, NY. He was also a member of the US Ski Association, the Metropolitan Ski Council of New York, and served as President of the Sea Woods HOA in New Smyrna Beach, Fl.\n\nFavorite memories of Ernest include ski trips with his grandchildren, the many times Ernest and Marie welcomed family and neighbors into their Mineola, NY home, and how dashing he would look in his tartan kilt. He was especially gifted in his ability of humbly sharing stories of his life and work. Where Ernest really shined was on the dance floor dancing with Marie and family lovingly called them “Fred and Ginger”. The smooth eloquence in which Ernest danced, skied, and skated mirrored the way he lived his life.\n\nErnest is survived by his beloved wife, Marie (Chaplain) MacKinnon, Maureen Gregory, daughter-in-law Gayle MacKinnon, his 6 grandchildren, Tracey and son-in-law Joe Lennon, Lisa MacKinnon, Amanda and son-in-law Nathan Carpenter, KG MacKinnon, Sara and son-in-law Steve Walling, James Gregory, his nine great-grandchildren, and extended family members. He is predeceased by his mother Evelyn Howatt and his father Ernest M. MacKinnon, his son, Kevin MacKinnon, and son-in-law Donald Gregory.\n\nTo honor his life and legacy, family and friends are invited to his Celebration of Life on Friday, August 16, 2024 from 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM with a service beginning at 11:30 AM at Van Emburgh-Sneider-Pernice Funderal Home, 109 Darlington Ave, Ramsey, NJ."
