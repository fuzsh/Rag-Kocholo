His wife, Ethel, lived at 1034 Gilford Street (or at 1038 Gilford Street) for much of the time from 1918 to 1939.\n\nJames Charlton Donald was born on May 3, 1867, in Norwich, Ontario. His father was Rev. William Donald (1835-1899) (one source says he was born in 1838). James’s mother was Mary Ella Charlton (1842-1930).\n\nIn 1871, James was living with his parents in Port Hope, Ontario. In 1881, he and his parents were in Pictou, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn the late 1880s the family moved to California, where William Donald was a clergyman in the Pacific coast town of Carpinteria.\n\nBy 1892, James was in San Francisco, California. He was a reporter for the San Francisco Call newspaper.\n\nOn April 17, 1895, in San Francisco, James married Ethel Moore. She was born in San Francisco on October 11, 1871. Her father was Robert Moore. Her mother was Francis Amelia Pidwell. (Robert Moore and Francis Pidwell were married in Victoria, British Columbia, on February 19, 1861.)\n\nAfter the honeymoon, James and Ethel returned to San Francisco, where they lived at 2028 Steiner Street.\n\nBy 1896, James was with the Associated Press in San Francisco.\n\nIn 1899, James and Ethel moved from San Francisco to Vancouver.\n\nJames and Ethel were in Vancouver at the time of the 1901 Canada census. They lived at the following addresses in Vancouver.\n\n1902 1600 Robson Street 1903 to 1906 1373 Robson Street 1907 to 1911 and 1913 1034 Gilford Street\n\nFrom 1902 to 1904, James was the city editor of the Vancouver Province newspaper.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1911, he was in a real estate business with Robert Andrew Corbet (1870-1928).\n\nIn 1912 and 1913, James had his own real estate business.\n\nHe belonged to the Vancouver Club, the Jericho Country Club, and the A.F. & A.M. (Ancient Free and Accepted Masons).\n\nOn the morning of October 16, 1913, James walked from his house at 1034 Gilford Street to Simpson’s boathouse on English Bay. He got into a small boat and started to row across the bay to the golf club at Jericho Beach. He never arrived. In the afternoon, two men found James’s boat floating in the bay. His coat and hat were in the boat, along with only one oar. The police and James’s friends looked in the waters of English Bay, but they could not find any trace of him.\n\nA tugboat captain discovered James’s body floating on the bay six weeks later, on November 30, 1913. The coroner concluded that James’s death resulted from accidental drowning. James was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nEthel did not appear in the Vancouver directories from 1914 to 1917. For some of this time she was in California.\n\nIn 1918 she was at 1034 Gilford Street. (At some point around 1923, 1038 Gilford Street appeared in the directories along with 1034 Gilford. It appears that the house was divided into two suites, resulting in two addresses: 1034 Gilford and 1038 Gilford.)\n\n1920 to 1923 number 20, 920 Bidwell Street (listed as Mrs. G.

Donald) 1932 to 1939 1034 Gilford Street (listed as 1038 Gilford Street from 1933 to 1939) 1940 number 4, 1108 Nicola Street\n\nIn 1914 and 1927, Ethel appeared in the Vancouver society directories.\n\nFor a time, Ethel was a social correspondent for The Province newspaper. She belonged to the Jericho Country Club and the Georgian Club.\n\nEthel died in Vancouver on January 15, 1941. She was buried in Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver.\n\nJames and Ethel had a daughter.\n\nMarcia Dorothea Donald\n\nMarcia Dorothea Donald was born in Los Angeles, California, on February 4, 1913.\n\nFor a time she worked as a stenographer.\n\nOn June 10, 1939, she married David William Davidson, who was a salesman. He was born in Calgary, Alberta, in 1913. His father was David Frederick Davidson (1881-1955). His mother was Ivah Seeton Schwartz (1883-1935).\n\nDavid William Davidson had studied at the University of Alberta. He moved to Vancouver, where he worked for Parsons, Brown Limited.\n\nIn 1939, David joined the Seaforth Highlanders. He served extensively in Europe during the Second World War.\n\nDuring the war, Marcia served with the Canadian Red Cross in London, England.\n\nAfter the war, David and Marcia returned to Vancouver. David became the sales manager for Parsons, Brown.\n\nIn 1955, David was the manager of the real estate department of Yorkshire Corporation\n\nDavid died in 1995. He was buried in the Union Cemetery in Calgary, Alberta. Marcia was an executor of David’s estate.\n\nMarcia died in Kamloops, British Columbia on November 28, 2008.\n\nSources\n\nWilliam Donald (father of James Charlton Donald)\n\nWilliam Donald, http://www.ancestry.com.au/genealogy/records/william-donald_31967186: “Born in Rattray, Perth, Scotland on 17 Jan 1835 to James Donald and Catherine McIntosh.

The wedding of Miss Ethel Moore, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moore, and James CharIton Donald, the popular journalist, took place at St. Paul’s Episcopal Church last Wednesday evening. The edifice, which was not large enough to accommodate all the guests who had assembled to witness the ceremony, was artistically decorated with yellow roses and eschscholtzias. As the organist played the Tannhauser wedding march the bridal party entered, led by Miss Margaret Granley, a five-year-old niece of the bride, who acted as page, and was followed by the ushers — Frederick W. Searby, W. Kimball Briggs, S. E. Tucker and Frederick S. Myrtle. Then came the maid of J honor, Miss Gertrude Moore, sister of the bride, and lastly the bride, leaning on the arm of her father.\n\nThe bride’s gown was of ivory en train. The corsage was high and trimmed with chiffons of white lace and real orange-blossoms from the orange-grove of her father near Riverside. The maid of honor was attired in a yellow silk trimmed with ribbons and lace. She carried yellow roses. Mrs. Moore, mother of the bride, wore an elaborate red Irish poplin gown en train and trimmed with lace. The mother of the groom wore a black silk with long train and cream lace collar. Her ornaments were pearls. The ceremony was performed by Rev. W. J Maxwell Reilly, rector of the church, and when he had pronounced the blessing Frank Coffin sang the matrimonial hymn of the Episcopal church. At the conclusion of the ceremony Mendelssohn’s Wedding March was played as the party left the church and proceeded to the residence of the bride’s parents, 2620 Sacramento street, where a reception was held. The bride and groom left Thursday on a wedding trip through Southern California, and on their return will reside at 2028 Steiner street.”\n\nSan Francisco Call, Volume 77, Number 153, 12 May 1895, page 21; http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18950512.2.218&srpos=1&e=——-en–20–1–txt-txIN-%22james+charlton+donald%22——-1: “Mr. and Mrs. James Charlton Donald will be at home on the second and fourth Sundays, at 2028 Steiner street.”\n\n“California Great Registers, 1866-1910,” database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VYDZ-XDQ : 26 November 2014), James Charlton Donald, 1896; citing Voter Registration, 2028 Steiner, San Francisco, California, United States, county clerk offices, California; FHL microfilm 977,258.\n\n“Around the Corridors,” San Francisco Call, Volume 86, Number 125, 3 October 1899, page 6; http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18991003.2.74&srpos=9&e=–1880—1930–en–20-SFC-1–txt-txIN-%22j+c+donald%22——-1: “J.

Donald Believed to Have Fallen Out of His Rowboat Yesterday,” Vancouver Province, October 17, 1913, page 34:\n\n“Mr. J.C. Donald, a well-known broker, was drowned yesterday in English Bay, having apparently fallen out of a rowboat while on his way to the Country Club at Jericho Beach to play golf. He left his home, 1034 Gilford street, at 9:30 o’clock with a laugh in his heart and a joke on his lips, went to Simpson’s boathouse, chatted pleasantly for a moment with several workmen who were painting a pier and started across the bay. At 2 o’clock the boat was found by Messrs. William Burchell and Robert Nickerson. It was then floating about a mile off Kitsilano. In it were Mr. Donald’s coat, containing some personal papers, and his hat. One oar was also missing. It looks as if one oar had “caught a crab”—failed to hold the water and also slipped out of the rowlock—causing the oarsman in trying to recover it, to fall overboard. This theory is strengthened by the fact that Mr. Donald was not an experienced oarsman. He could not swim.\n\nMr. Donald leaves a wife and one child a year old. He was a brother-in-law of Major J.S. Tait and Mr. Walter E. Graveley. He was a member of the Vancouver and Country clubs and especially amongst a large acquaintance of business men was well-known and very popular.\n\nBorn in Nova Scotia 43 years ago, Mr. Donald lived quite a number of years in the United States. He was a newspaperman in San Francisco, first on the Examiner and later was day editor for the Associated Press. He came to Vancouver ten years ago, was with the World Newspaper for a few months and later joined the editorial staff of The Province. A year or two later he formed a partnership with Mr. R.A. Corbet, and continued under the firm name of Corbet & Donald until a couple of years ago.”\n\n“Fear Drowning is Untimely End of J.C.
