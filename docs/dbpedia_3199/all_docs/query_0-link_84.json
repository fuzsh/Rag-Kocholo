        "text": "Donald History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nScotland\n\nIreland\n\nThe Donald family history stretches back to the clans of the Dalriadan kingdom on the sea-swept Hebrides islands and mountainous western coast of Scotland. The name Donald is derived from a powerful ruler. The name Donald is derived from the Gaelic name Domhnull, or MacDhomhnuill, and the Celtic name Dubnovalos, all of which mean \"world ruler\" or \"world-mighty\". The name ranks second only to John in its popularity as a personal name in Scotland.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Donald family\n\nThe surname Donald was first found in Galloway (Gaelic: Gall-ghaidhealaibh), an area of southwestern Scotland, now part of the Council Area of Dumfries and Galloway, that formerly consisted of the counties of Wigtown (West Galloway) and Kirkcudbright (East Galloway), where they held a family seat from very ancient times, some say well before the Norman Conquest and the arrival of Duke William at Hastings in 1066 A.D.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Donald family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Donald research.

Translation, particularly from Gaelic to English, was little better. For these reasons, early Scottish names are rife with spelling variations. In various documents Donald has been spelled Donald, Donaldson, Doneld, Donnald, Donnaldson and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Donald family\n\nNotable amongst the Clan from early times was\n\nAdam Donald (1703-1780), called 'the prophet of Bethelnie,' born at the hamlet of that name, twenty miles north of Aberdeen, in 1703. \" Notwithstanding his extraordinary stature and build, which cause...\n\nJames Donaldson (fl. 1713), was a Scottish miscellaneous writer, a native of Scotland, was a gentleman in straitened circumstances who sought to obtain patronage by the publication of various pieces i...\n\nWalter Donaldson (fl. 1620), was a Scottish philosophical writer, a native of Aberdeen, born about 1575.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Per mare, per terras\n\nMotto Translation: By sea, by land.\n\nCitations +\n\n\"What are the 5,000 Most Common Last Names in the U.S.?\".
