        "text": "The Man, The Myth, The Legend, Victoria’s Biggest Sports Fan, My Town, My Team, Buddy Ryan, Donny Brooks, Dobs, Dobbie, Don, Donald, Mr. Dobbie, Papa, Dad, and Pops are some of the names you would hear this amazing man be addressed as. He was many things to many people.\n\nDonald was born in Calgary Alberta as the only child to James and Lillian (Burrell) Dobbie, and raised in both Pincher Creek and Turner Valley, Alberta. He was known as the keeper of the family secrets because of the endless hours he spent researching and updating the genealogy records on both sides of his family. He took pride in remembering important dates (he would check his Palm Pilot daily to confirm and made sure to acknowledge them by calling everyone on their birthdays and anniversaries.\n\nIn 1951 he started being referred to as Dobbie by the men and women he served with in the Royal Canadian Airforce. He wasn’t the fighter pilot character that came to mind when you read this, but he was the financial guru that kept Air Commands Finances balanced to the penny and made sure that everyone was paid correctly and on time. His 30-year career began with him enrolling in Medicine Hat, AB as an Aircraftsman 2nd Class, serving in Aylmer, ONT, Edmonton, AB, Paris, France, Metz, France, Calgary, AB, El Arish, Egypt (UNEF), back to Calgary, AB, Dayton, Ohio, USA (where his 1st child Cheryl Jean was born), Ottawa, Ontario (where his 2nd child Brent James was born), Winnipeg, Manitoba and lastly in Victoria, BC at CFB Esquimalt where he retired from the Air Force as a Master Warrant Officer in 1981.\n\nNot ready to retire completely, Don accepted a position with the Department of Regional Economic Expansion within the Federal Government in Victoria but was transferred to Vancouver very shortly after when the office in Victoria closed. This was very difficult for Don as family always came first and this meant that he was separated from his kids who remained on the island. He continued to be a very active and involved father travelling back to Victoria and entertaining his kids in Vancouver every chance he could.\n\nShortly after Don retired for good and following the birth of his first grandchild, Madison (“The first born of my first born”) he decided it was time to move back to Victoria.\n\nDobs was a natural athlete in his youth playing hockey, baseball, curling, volleyball, and golf all of which he continued playing while enlisted in the military. He played on championship teams overseas and, on home base so it was only natural when after retirement he morphed into “Victoria’s Biggest Sports Fan”.\n\nIf you were ever a regular spectator at any of the sports played at the University of Victoria (UVic) you were sure to recognize Mr. Dobbie. He could be found courtside in McKinnon Gym watching basketball, on the wooden stands cheering on the rugby team and up the bleachers at the stadium content in his UVic hoodie and jacket intently watching soccer (both the women and the men and especially when Cousin Erin was playing). In 2012, the Dobbie Family Athletic Award was created to give a financial award to an undergraduate or graduate student who competes on a University of Victoria Vikes varsity team.\n\nHe held seasons tickets for the Victoria Salsa, Victoria Salmon Kings and the Victoria Royals for many years. He knew the players stats, all pertinent information and always wished the players a good game before they hit the ice. He was such a beloved fan of the Salmon Kings that they invited him to be in a commercial for their “My Town, My Team” campaign which earned him that same nickname.\n\nHe had a favourite seat in every arena and that was no different for the Victoria Shamrocks lacrosse games. He attended every game with his daughter and liked to sit with the friends he had made through the years. He eventually became a season ticket holder to the Intermediate Shamrocks and then the Jr’s as his grandson Brayden played his way up through the ranks.\n\nPapa supported his kids and grandkids in all their sports or activities. He supported Cher in theatre, all her fundraising and community events and even watched intently as she graduated from Charm School (she is still traumatized to this day). He was a regular at all of Brent’s hockey, baseball and basketball games and was well known by all the players, coaches, and parents. He has always been loved and highly regarded by both of his kids’ friends and was always prepared with a few good jokes when he would accompany Brent after a game or event and there were able to share special moments together with the Stanley and Mann Cups and the Super Bowl trophy.\n\nPapa was a well-known spectator at all his grandchildren’s activities. He was present at everything from PACE productions, Christmas concerts, to sporting events and graduations. Madison, Brayden, Mackenzie, and Dawson knew that their Papa loved and supported everything they were involved in. He helped shuttle kids to practices and to and from school when a hand was needed and is known affectionally as Papa to all his grandkids’ friends.\n\nThe last few weeks have been very difficult for all of us. Dad always bounced back from every illness and hospital stay, but we knew somehow that this time was different, and we would soon be saying goodbye. Brayden travelled home from Kentucky to fulfill Dad’s wish of seeing him and meeting his girlfriend Rachael in person and together, Madison, Mackenzie, Dawson, and were able to spend some quality time with him and left no word unsaid.\n\nAt 12:30 am on March 27th he left this world the way he wanted to; with Cher curled up with him, and Brent beside him and each of them holding a hand.\n\nThank you to the staff at Alexander Mackie Lodge, the staff on 6N at VGH (especially HCA Jen who always went over and above for Dad), Tom and Leslie Redhead and Tom and Sue Glendinning for travelling to spend some time with Dad. Family was everything to him and he was so thrilled to have visited with you. Special mention to Al Tabor who was a best friend to Dad from the time they enlisted on the same day with one person separating them to the very last day of his life.\n\nA memorial /family day barbecue will be held this summer but, in the meantime, raise a Coors Light or an A&W root beer in his honour. In lieu of flowers, if you so wish; please direct donations in Dad’s name to the Dobbie Family Athletic Award, University of Victoria Development Office, PO Box 1700, Stn CSC, Victoria, BC, V8W 2Y2 or the Children’s Health Foundation of Vancouver Island @ 345 Wale Road, Victoria, BC V9B6X2.\n\nCondolences may offered to the family below."
