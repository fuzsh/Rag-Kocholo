        "text": "[sibling(s) unknown]\n\nDescendants\n\nProfile last modified 8 Aug 2021 | Created 29 Mar 2017\n\nThis page has been accessed 435 times.\n\nBiography\n\nI estimated James Donald was born before 1762 . Per his college records, his father's name was James Donald from Cluny - See Note 6. He attended Marischal College from 1778 to 1782 and graduated with a Master of Arts degree. While attending the college he received Garden's bursary (scholarship) for all the years he was there plus for the last two years, the Gray's bursary. See Source 2 below.\n\nJames Donald applied for the post of School Master in January 1790, having been recommended to the Board of Governors by Rev. Sherriffs. He was already employed at Robert Gordon’s Hospital as an assistant to Mr Duncan the Writing Master. James Donald’s application was preferred over that of another applicant and the 25 January 1790 was set for his interview and trial before the Governors. He was examined in English Language, Arithmetic, Writing and other branches of education and found to be suitably qualified. He was duly appointed to the post and, after taking the oath, was introduced that same day to the pupils as their Master. See source section - Gordon's Hospital Governors Minutes below.' I am not sure what James did between the time he graduated from college in 1782 and became a Schoolmaster at Robert Gordon's Hospital in 1790 but perhaps was Schoolmaster at another location. Am still pursuing this as a possibility. However, with the notation about being employed as an assistant to Mr Duncan, then perhaps that was his employment once he graduated in 1782 until he sent in his application in 1790, certainly possible I guess.\n\nHis salary, while a Schoolmaster at Gordon's, was 26 pounds 5 Shillings for the period 01 Nov 1793 until 01 Nov 1794.\n\nJames, a Schoolmaster in Aberdeen, married Charlotte McKinzie 12 Jul 1806 in Aberdeen[1]. On 17 July 1806, 5 days after he married, he submitted to the Treasurer of the Hospital the following letter: I hereby intimate to you as Treasurer of Robert Gordon’s Hospital that I am soon to quit my situation as one of the School Masters of said Hospital. I cannot, however, do this without expressing my gratitude to the Governors and Treasurer for their uniform kindness and indulgence to me during the long period that I have held that office. I am, Sir, Yours with respect, Signed James Donald'\n\nI am suspecting James resigned from Robert Gordon's Hospital because of perhaps already being offered the position of Schoolmaster at the Parochrial School at St. Andrews in Morayshire. Purely speculation but surely he would not quit his position, after having just gotten married and a wife to support without another job prospect.\n\nIn the Elgin Presbytery Kirk Session Minutes of 21 Oct 1806, James Donald is mentioned as being the Schoolmaster at St Andrews, Lhandbryde, and a Student of Divinity. He had produced documents as to his regular attendance at the Divinity Hall when he was a student at Marischal College. The minutes also mention James was certified at Kings College 14 Jul 1806 and \"his conversation and conduct is suitable as a candidate of the Holy Ministry \" per W. L. Brown S.S. F. P. On 02 Dec 1806, again in the Elgin Presbytery Minutes, it was noted James had produced ample testimonials at the previous meeting and he wanted to expedite his trials and be licensed to be a Preacher of the Gospel. The presbytery had examined his knowledge of Greek and Latin languages as well as his proficiency in Theological knowledge and was well satisfied so they are going to recommend him to the Synod.\n\nOn 31 Aug 1807 James delivered a lecture on the 21st Psalm at the Elgin Presbytery Session. Also on this date he delivered a Homily. On 27 Jan 1808 James was licensed to preach the Gospel.\n\nYou can see the picture of the old St Andrews school where James taught. This picture was taken 18 May 2021 by a dear friend Susan Munro who went there especially for me. Unfortunately the school is in disrepair. Someone has taken all the old wood flooring as well as the wooden panels on the walls. A shame it could have been perhaps restored to it's original beauty and used by the local community as a gathering or small event place.\n\nThe picture of the well maintained home is where James and Charlotte lived. This picture was also taken by Susan.\n\nJames was proposed for Trials on 21 Oct 1806 and licensed to be a Preacher of the Gospel on 21 Jan 1808. He was the Parochial Schoolmaster at St Andrews-Lhandbryde in Morayshire from 1806 and died there in February 1832 - see Note 8. In 1808, his salary was £1/15/5d and two bolls of bear- See Note 7. He was ordained in 1827. His wife Charlotte is shown as a widow when she wrote her will and she died 23 May 1834.\n\nNotes\n\n1. Charlotte's will mentions an executor named William Donald, a Farmer in Kintore. Perhaps he is a relative of her deceased husband James Donald. Suspect he is James' brother William who is married to Agnes Norval.\n\n2. Charlotte's Inventory mentions \"to price of books sold the Reverend James Donald in Kintore\"...again, perhaps a relation of deceased husband James.Suspect he is James' nephew, son of William Donald and Agnes Norval.\n\n3. A book, The History of the Province of Moray by Lachlan Shaw, has an entry for St Andrews in Elgin stating James Donald, a Teacher, received \"200 merks, 16b. bear from Heritors, and a Mortification of 25 merks. This money came from the Carnegie of Spynie and the Earl of Moray.\n\n4. Kirk Session Minutes for St Andrews-Lhandbryde look up by a SPECIAL person named Bruce who was queried by another SPECIAL person Susan Munro..my relative through marriage. As a side note, I have been searching for James for 12 years and Susan, through her perseverance, tracked down this information. I am pinning a Genealogist virtual medal on her!\n\n5. I suspect (based on some related facts) James was born 1761 in Cluny and probably to James Donald and Agnes Ross but I do not yet have the facts to prove this.\n\n6. The Marischal College records do show this James' father was named James from Cluny.\n\n7. A Boll is a Dry Measure of varying weight depending on the product and locality - anywhere between 2 to 7 bushels. According to the Scottish National Dictionary a boll of oats is about 6 Imperial bushels. According to Scotlands People, a boll of barley, oats or malt is equal to 53 litres. 1 boll equals 4 firlots. And, apparently bear is another name for barley per Wikipedia. So...part of James' salary in 1808 was paid in food, about 106 litres of barley. Wikipedia also states a firlot, a dry measure for grain, is equal to 4 pecks. So..if a boll equals 4 firlots and a firlot equals 4 pecks, James received 16 pecks of barley.\n\n8. In March 1832 there was a severe outbreak of Cholera in Lhanbryde and neighboring areas of the parish so I wonder if that could have possibly extended to James' area and perhaps the cause of James' death a month earlier. Or, it may just be a coincidence. James would have been at least 70 years of age in 1832.\n\n9. I \"suspect\" William Donald, mentioned in Charlotte's will, is James' brother.\n\n10. I \"suspect\" James and William's parents are EITHER James Donald and Margaret Reid OR James Donald and Agnes Ross (leaning towards this couple), both from Cluny. Rationale is time frame, father James being from Cluny and having a brother William was just a bonus.\n\nSources\n\n1. Abt 1762 birth year based on start of college year (1778) minus 16 years.\n\n2. 1778-1782 Marischal College list of graduates from the online site of the University of Aberdeen. Information about his time a Marischal, his bursaries and his salary at St Andrews was provided by Heather Kennedy from the Wolfson Reading Room at the University of Aberdeen. She found lots of great information and was a tremendous source and the catalyst for my contact with Robert Gordon's Hospital.\n\n3. 1790-1806 entries in records researched by by Tom Cumming, Achivist for Gordon's Hospital records. The length of time a schoolmaster and beating out another applicant (Governors Minutes), his yearly salary (Annual Accounts Register from the 1790's), his letter of resignation(from the Governmors Minutes) THANK YOU Tom. He supplied me with so much valuable information - superb job Tom.\n\n4. 1806 marriage record from the parish of Aberdeen obtained from Scotlands People.\n\n5. 1806 marriage information from the Family Search site.\n\n6. 1806 certified at Kings College from the Elgin Presbytery Kirk Session Minutes at Scotlands People.\n\n7. 1806 proposed for trials and 1808 license date are noted in the booklet entitled \"The Lands and People of Moray - Part 10\" by Bruce B Bishop, obtained from the ANESFHS.\n\n8. 1807-1808 Elgin Presbytery Minutes regarding James presenting at the Session and also being licensed to preach. Minutes from Scotlands People.\n\n9. 1832 death year from a lookup in the Kirk Session Minutes for the St Andrews-Lhandbryde parish. He is buried in the Lhanbryde Cemetery (formerly Calcots) but his tombstone has not survived so he is not listed in the ANESFHS published MI booklet.\n\n10. Feb 1832 death date is also listed in the booklet titled \"The Lands and People of Moray- Part 10\" by Bruce B. Bishop, although I believe the source was the above source - the Kirk Session Minutes.\n\n11. The Schoolmaster Salaries are also noted in booklet \"The Lands and People of Moray - Part 9\" by Bruce B Bishop, obtained from the ANESFHS.\n\n12. 1834 death of wife Charlotte per her will and inventory from Scotlands People.\n\n13. The countless hours spent pouring over microfiche records, quite difficult to read, the tramping through graveyards, the phone calls and emails sent to various groups and people are too innumerable to even list. The credit all goes to Susan Munro who I should have thanked publicly much earlier. Without her, much of what is known and written would not be possible.\n\n↑ \"Scotland Marriages, 1561-1910,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XTJ6-NYN : 10 February 2018), Jas.
