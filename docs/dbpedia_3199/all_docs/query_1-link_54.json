        "text": "Click here to sign up to our free newsletters!\n\nA Moray man has been jailed for cutting the face of his sleeping victim with a pair of scissors.\n\nThe victim fell asleep on a sofa inside a Elgin house.\n\nHe's said to have woken to find lacerations on his face which required 11 stitches.\n\nInverness Sheriff Court heard that the victim had no memory of how his injuries were inflicted,\n\nPolice were informed and a search of the property in Forbes Court uncovered a pair of scissors with blood on the tips.\n\nFiscal depute Susan Love stated that forensic analysis also found the DNA of 24-year-old James Donald on the handles.\n\nDonald, of Mid Street, Keith, admitted the assault which occurred on November 4, 2020.\n\nDefence solicitor Stephen Carty asked for his client not to be jailed.\n\nMr Carty said: \"He has been on a 7pm to 7am curfew since 2020 and has complied with that.\n\n\"His explanation is that at the time he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs â€“ and in the company of individuals he should not have been.\n\n\"The complainer's name had been mentioned in relation to a theft and he went there about it.\n\n\"He picked up the scissors to use as a threat but matters took a turn for the worse and he struck him once.\n\n\"He does not recall much more.\n\n\"After becoming aware that the police were looking for him, he went to speak to them.\n\n\"He has had custodial sentences in the past but he is a different individual now to what he was back then.\n\n\"He is settling down with his partner and she has a significant influence on him.\n\n\"In addition, he's has been doing voluntary work with a stonemason and is hopeful of getting an apprenticeship.\"\n\nDonald, who's also lived in Elgin and Lossiemouth, was jailed for 13 months.\n\nPassing sentence, Sheriff Eilidh Macdonald said: \"This is a significant, violent act.\n\n\"There is no clear explanation how it came about, but you have previous convictions for violent offending.\n\n\"There is no alternative to a prison sentence for carrying out a violent attack with a weapon.\""
