        "text": "About\n\nPickOne is a creative company owned and operated by myself, James Donald. Currently based in Edinburgh, I trained at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design in Dundee and set up PickOne in 1997.\n\nI am primarily a weaver using Scottish based materials including lamb's wool, Shetland wool and other locally-sourced fibres. Through diversification I do from time to time have other related products for sale.\n\nFor a number of years I have developed a teaching practice in weave and currently run weekend weave workshops as well as evening classes. PickOne is also developing an open-access studio in which weavers can hire equipment, specifically a 32-shaft Megado with two beams plus studio space on a month by month basis."
