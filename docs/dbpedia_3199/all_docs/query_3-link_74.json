        "text": "James Donald Smith, 85, passed away peacefully at his home on November 12, 2023. He was a beloved Catholic, Husband, Father, Grandfather, Partner and a respected businessman.\n\nJames (Jim) was preceded in death by his wife of 50 years Delores Smith. He is survived by his three daughters and son-in-laws; Kelly and Vaughn, Karie and Winton, and Karla and Man and his five grandchildren Kale, Kyra, Cameron, Karson and Sena.\n\nHe was blessed to share many years with Dorothy Parker and her four children; Patti, Mici Yvette, Richard, Micheal, Laurie and their extended families.\n\nJim was born in Thomas, South Dakota where his mother of 103, brother Rick and his wife Karen still reside.\n\nAs a young Civil Engineer Jim moved his family to Santa Fe, New Mexico where he worked with the NM Department of Transportation for many years. Once settled in Albuquerque, he continued to contribute to the engineering community by not only designing many of the state highways and local roads but also designing the Juan Tabo Dam for AMAFCA; lead engineer and design member of Tanoan Communities; an active member in Albuquerque Economic Development; and eventually retiring at the age of 80 as Vice President and Senior Engineer with Souder, Miller & Associates. Jim believed in New Mexico and serving the community but his greatest legacy was kindness, patience, encouragement and integrity that he practiced daily."
