        "text": "Emigrants from Scotland and their descendants\n\nEthnic group\n\nThe Scottish diaspora consists of Scottish people who emigrated from Scotland and their descendants. The diaspora is concentrated in countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, England, New Zealand, Ireland and to a lesser extent Argentina, Chile, and Brazil. The Scottish disapora has been estimated by the Scottish Government to be between 28 and 40 million people worldwide.[1] Other estimates have ranged as high as 80 million.[17]\n\nAccording to Marjory Harper (2003) of the University of Aberdeen, Scottish emigrants and their descendants have maintained connections to Scotland though formal and informal means including \"church, school and Scottish society\" and \"place names, correspondence, family and community networks, and chain migration\".[18] Rogers Brubaker (2005) wrote that immigrants from Scotland have regarded the ancestral homeland as \"an authoritative source of value, identity and loyalty\".[19] According to Lauren Brancaz (2016) of the Centre for Breton and Celtic Research: \"Scottish culture has not been contained within the borders of Scotland. It has lived on in the minds of migrants who have remained attached to it\".[20]\n\nAmericas\n\n[edit]\n\nArgentina\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Argentines\n\nA Scottish Argentine population has existed at least since 1825.[21] There are an estimated 100,000 Argentines of Scottish ancestry, the most of any country outside the English-speaking world.[22] Scottish Argentines have been incorrectly referred to as English.[23]\n\nBrazil\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Brazilians\n\nCanada\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Canadians\n\nSee also: Canadian Gaelic\n\nScottish people have a long history in Canada, dating back several centuries. Many towns, rivers and mountains have been named in honour of Scottish explorers and traders such as Mackenzie Bay and the major city of Calgary, Alberta, is named after a Scottish beach. Most notably, the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia is Latin for New Scotland. Once Scots formed the vanguard of the movement of Europeans across the continent. In more modern times, emigrants from Scotland have played a leading role in the social, political and economic history of Canada, being prominent in banking, labour unions, and politics.[24]\n\nThe first documented Scottish settlement in the Americas was of Nova Scotia (New Scotland) in 1629. On 29 September 1621, the charter for the foundation of a colony was granted by James VI of Scotland to Sir William Alexander.[25] Between 1622 and 1628, Sir William launched four attempts to send colonists to Nova Scotia; all failed for various reasons. A successful occupation of Nova Scotia was finally achieved in 1629. The colony's charter, in law, made Nova Scotia (defined as all land between Newfoundland and New England) a part of mainland Scotland. The Scots have influenced the cultural mix of Nova Scotia for centuries and constitute the largest ethnic group in the province, at 29.3% of its population. Many Scottish immigrants were monoglot Scottish Gaelic speakers from the Gàidhealtachd (Scottish Highlands). Canadian Gaelic was spoken as the first language in much of \"Anglophone\" Canada, such as Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and Glengarry County in Ontario. Gaelic was the third most commonly spoken language in Canada.[26]\n\nAs the third-largest ethnic group in Canada and amongst the first Europeans to settle in the country, Scottish people have made a large impact on Canadian culture since colonial times. According to the 2011 Census of Canada, the number of Canadians claiming full or partial Scottish descent is 4,714,970,[27] or 15.10% of the nation's total population.\n\nChile\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Chileans\n\nA large proportion of Scottish Chileans are sheep farmers in the Magallanes region of the far south of the country, and the city of Punta Arenas has a large Scottish foundation dating back to the 18th century. A famous Scot, Thomas, Lord Cochrane (later 10th Earl of Dundonald) formed the Chilean Navy to help liberate Chile from Spain in the independence period. Chile developed a strong diplomatic relationship with Great Britain and invited more British settlers to the country in the 19th century.\n\nThe Chilean government land deals invited settlement from Scotland and Wales in its southern provinces in the 1840s and 1850s. The number of Scottish Chileans is still higher in Patagonia and Magallanes regions. The Mackay School, in Viña del Mar is an example of a school set up by Scottish Chileans. The Scottish and other British Chileans are primarily found in higher education as well in economic management and the country's cultural life.\n\nUnited States\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Americans\n\nScottish ancestry in the United States, 1700–2013 Year Ethnic group Population % of total population Ref. 1700 est. Scottish 7,526 3.0% [28][29] 1755 est. Scottish & Scots-Irish 4.0% & 7.0% (11.0%) [28] 1775 est. Scottish & Scots-Irish 6.6% & 7.8% (14.4%) [30] 1790 est.

In 1700, the total population of the American colonies was 250,888 of whom 223,071 (89%) were white and 3.0% were ethnically Scottish.[28][29] In the 2000 census, 4.8 million Americans[37] self-reported Scottish ancestry, 1.7% of the total US population. Another 4.3 million self-reported Scots-Irish ancestry, for a total of 9.2 million Americans self-reporting some kind of Scottish descent.\n\nThe 2008 US Census 2008 American Community Survey figures showed approximately 5.8 million Americans self-identified as being of Scottish ancestry, and another 3.5 million Scots-Irish, for 9.3 million total.[38] In the 2013 American Community Survey, 5.3 ;million identified as Scottish and another nearly 3 million as of Scots-Irish descent, for about 8.3 million total.[39]\n\nSelf-reported numbers are regarded by demographers as massive under-counts, because Scottish ancestry is known to be disproportionately under-reported among the majority of mixed ancestry,[40] and because areas where people reported \"American\" ancestry were the places where, historically, Scottish and Scots-Irish Protestants settled in North America (that is: along the North American coast, Appalachia, and the Southeastern United States). The number of actual Americans of Scottish descent today is estimated to be 20 to 25 million[41][42][43][44] (up to 8.3% of the total US population), and Scots-Irish, 27 to 30 million[45][46] (up to 10% of the total US population), the subgroups overlapping and not always distinguishable because of their shared ancestral surnames.\n\nLarge-scale emigration from Scotland to America began in the 1700s after the Battle of Culloden, when the Clan structures were broken up. Anti-Catholic persecution[47][48] and the Highland Clearances also obliged many Scottish Gaels to emigrate. The Scots went in search of a better life and settled in the thirteen colonies, mainly around South Carolina and Virginia.\n\nThe majority of Scots-Irish originally came from Lowland Scotland and the Scottish Borders before migrating to the province of Ulster in Ireland mostly in the 17th century (see Plantation of Ulster) and from there, beginning about five generations later, to North America in large numbers during the 18th century.\n\nLater Scottish Americans descended from 19th-century Scottish immigrants tend to be concentrated in the West, while others in New England are the descendants of immigrants from the Maritime Provinces of Canada, especially in the 1920s.\n\nAmericans who identify themselves as of Scottish descent outnumber the population of Scotland, where 4,459,071 or 88.09% of people identified as ethnic Scottish in the 2000 Census.[37][49] There are many US-based Scottish clan societies and other heritage organizations (such as the Saint Andrews societies, Caledonian societies, An Comunn Gàidhealach America, Slighe nan Gàidheal), through which \"Scottish migrants have remained attached to their homeland\".[50]\n\nAsia-Pacific\n\n[edit]\n\nAustralia\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish Australians\n\nScottish ancestry in Australia, 1986–2011 (Census) Year Population Percent of pop. Ref 1986 740,522 4.7% [51] 2001 540,046 2.9% [51] 2006 1,501,200 7.6% [52][53] 2011 1,792,622 8.3% [53][54]\n\nA steady rate of Scottish immigration continued into the 20th century, with substantial numbers of Scots continued to arrive after 1945.[55][page needed] From 1900 until the 1950s, Scots favoured New South Wales, as well as Western Australia and Southern Australia.[citation needed] A strong cultural Scottish presence is evident in the Highland games, dance, Tartan day celebrations, Clan and Gaelic speaking societies found throughout modern Australia.\n\nAccording to the 2011 Australian census 130,204 Australian residents were born in Scotland,[56] while 1,792,600 claimed Scottish ancestry, either alone or in combination with another ancestry.[6] This is the fourth most commonly nominated ancestry and represents over 8.9% of the total population of Australia.\n\nNew Zealand\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Scottish New Zealanders\n\nScottish migration to New Zealand dates back to the earliest period of European colonisation, with a large proportion of Pākehā New Zealanders being of Scottish descent.[57] However, identification as \"British\" or \"European\" New Zealanders can sometimes obscure their origin. Many Scottish New Zealanders also have Māori or other non-European ancestry.\n\nThe majority of Scottish immigrants settled in the South Island. All over New Zealand, the Scots developed different means to bridge the old homeland and the new. Many Caledonian societies were formed, well over 100 by the early twentieth century, who helped maintain Scottish culture and traditions. From the 1860s, these societies organised annual Caledonian Games throughout New Zealand. The games were sports meets that brought together Scottish settlers and the wider New Zealand public. In so doing, the games gave Scots a path to cultural integration as Scottish New Zealanders.[58]\n\nThe Lay Association of the Free Church of Scotland founded Dunedin at the head of Otago Harbour in 1848 as the principal town of its Scottish settlement. The name comes from Dùn Èideann, the Scottish Gaelic name for Edinburgh, the Scottish capital.[59] Charles Kettle, the city's surveyor, instructed to emulate the characteristics of Edinburgh, produced a striking, \"Romantic\" design. [60] The result was both grand and quirky streets as the builders struggled and sometimes failed to construct his bold vision across the challenging landscape. Captain William Cargill, a veteran of the war against Napoleon, was the secular leader. The Reverend Thomas Burns, a nephew of the poet Robert Burns, was the spiritual guide.\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1570–1630, some 6,000 Scots served as mercenary soldiers of Denmark.\n\nEngland\n\n[edit]\n\nAs England is Scotland's only land neighbour, there has been significant Scottish migration to England since the Union of the Crowns in 1603. London now has two Church of Scotland congregations, the ScotsCare charity (formerly the Royal Scottish Corporation), and Scottish social clubs. Corby has a significant Scottish population due to its historic steel industry.[citation needed]\n\nFrance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1570–1630, some 11,000 Scots served as mercenary soldiers of France.\n\nWilliam Davidson (c. 1593–c. 1669) was an authority on medicine, pharmacy and chemistry in France, court doctor of the French king, and the first native of the British Isles to become a professor of chemistry in France.[62]\n\nIreland\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Ulster Scots people\n\nSee also: Plantations of Ireland and Gallowglass\n\nThe Ulster-Scots, commonly known as Scots-Irish outside of Ireland, are an ethnic group in Ireland, found mostly in the Ulster region and to a lesser extent in the rest of Ireland. Their ancestors were mostly Protestant Lowland Scottish migrants, the largest numbers coming from Galloway, Lanarkshire, Stirlingshire, and Ayrshire, although some came from the Scottish Borders region, and others from further north in the Scottish Lowlands (Perthshire and the North East) and also to a lesser extent from the Highlands.\n\nThese Scots migrated to Ireland in large numbers both as a result of the government-sanctioned Plantation of Ulster and the previous and contemporary settlement of Scots in Antrim and Down by James Hamilton, Hugh Montgomery, and Lord Randal MacDonnell; the former a planned process of colonisation beginning in 1610 which took place under the auspices of King James I on land confiscated from members of the Gaelic nobility of Ireland who fled Ulster, and the latter a private scheme beginning in 1606, but also authorised by King James. These arrivals joined other Scots already in the area from centuries of smaller-scale immigration by Scottish gallowglass mercenaries and their families.\n\nUlster-Scots emigrated onwards from Ireland in significant numbers to what is now the United States and to all corners of the then-worldwide British Empire; Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, British India, and to a lesser extent Argentina and Chile. Scotch-Irish (or Scots-Irish) is a traditional term for Ulster-Scots in North America.\n\nLithuania\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Scots, forming a significant diaspora in Poland (see Poland section below), rarely settled in the Lithuanian part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, however, they conducted trade there, and there were Scottish communities in Kėdainiai and Słuck.[64] Out of gratitude for the opportunity to settle in Kėdainiai, the Scottish burghers funded scholarships for students from Lithuania at the University of Edinburgh.[65]\n\nPoland\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom as far back as the mid-16th century, historical records document the presence of Scots trading, serving as mercenary soldiers, and settling in Poland.[66] The vast majority were traders, from wealthy merchants to the thousands of pedlars who ensured that the term szot became synonymous in the Polish language with \"tinker\".[67][page needed] A \"Scotch Pedlar's Pack in Poland\" became a proverbial expression. It usually consisted of cloths, woollen goods and linen kerchiefs (head coverings). Itinerants also sold tin utensils and ironware such as scissors and knives. By 1562 the community was sizeable enough that the Scots, along with the Italians, were recognized by the Sejm as traders whose activities were harming Polish cities; in 1566, they were banned from roaming and peddling their wares.[68]\n\nHowever, from the 1570s onward, it was recognized that such bans were ineffectual. A heavy tax was placed upon them instead. Thomas Chamberlayne, an English eyewitness, described them disapprovingly in a 1610 letter to Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury, stating that \"[t]hese Scotts for the most parte are height landers [i.e. highlanders] men of noe credit, a Company of pedeling knaves...\"[69] Linked to some degree of persecution and their role in the Danzig uprising, protection (and by extension, a form of control) was offered by King Stephen Báthory in the Royal Grant of 1576, assigning Scottish immigrants to a district in Kraków. By the first half of the 17th century, the affairs of the Scottish community were regulated by twelve Brotherhoods with seats across various Polish cities; this included a tribunal that met to adjudicate disputes in the Royal city of Toruń.[67][page needed] In 1603, the office of the Scottish General (Generał Szkocki) was created to collect taxes and organize the judiciary over all Scots in Poland, with Captain Abraham Young appointed by King Sigismund III Vasa as the first superior.\n\nScottish mercenary soldiers first served in large numbers in the late 1570s. Many were former traders. According to Spytko Wawrzyniec Jordan, one of King Stephen Báthory's captains, they were former pedlars who, \"having abandoned or sold their booths ... buckle on their sword and shoulder their musket; they are infantry of unusual quality, although they look shabby to us ... 2000 Scots are better than 6000 of our own infantry.\"[71] It is possible that the shift from peddling to military occupations was connected to the implementation of heavy taxation on pedlars in the 1570s. Scottish mercenary soldiers were recruited specifically by King Stephen Báthory following his experience with them in forces raised by Danzig against him in 1577.[67][page needed] Báthory commented favourably upon the Scots and expressed a wish for them to be recruited in campaigns that he was planning against Muscovy. A steady stream of Scots soldiers served the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from this point forward.\n\nRecords from 1592 mention Scots settlers granted citizenship of Kraków, and give their employment as trader or merchant. Fees for citizenship ranged from 12 Polish florins to a musket and gunpowder, or an undertaking to marry within a year and a day of acquiring a holding.\n\nBy the 17th century, an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 Scots lived in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[72] Many came from Dundee and Aberdeen.[citation needed] The largest Scottish communities could be found in Gdańsk, Kraków, Lublin, Lwów, Poznań, Warsaw and Zamość, and sizeable numbers of Scots also lived in Brzeziny, Bydgoszcz, Człopa, Krosno, Łobżenica, Raciąż, Sieradz, Sierpc, Tarnów, Tuchola, Wałcz, Warta and Zakroczym. Small communities also existed in Biały Bór, Borek Wielkopolski, Brody, Chojnice, Czarne, Człuchów, Gniew, Gostyń, Iłża, Jedlińsk, Koronowo, Opole Lubelskie, Puck, Skoki, Starogard, Szamotuły, Szydłowiec, Świecie and Węgrów.[75][76][77] Settlers from Aberdeenshire were mainly Episcopalians or Catholics, but there were also large numbers of Calvinists. As well as Scottish traders, there were also many Scottish soldiers in Poland. In 1656, a number of Scottish highlanders travelled to Poland, serving under the King of Sweden in his war against it.\n\nThe Scots integrated well and many acquired great wealth. They contributed to many charitable institutions in the host country, but did not forget their homeland; for example, in 1701 when collections were made for the restoration fund of the Marischal College, Aberdeen, Scottish settlers in Poland gave generously.[citation needed]\n\nMany royal grants and privileges were granted to Scottish merchants until the 18th century, at which time the settlers began to merge more and more into the native population. Charles Edward Stuart (\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\") was half Polish, since he was the son of James Francis Edward Stuart, the \"Old Pretender\", and Maria Clementina Sobieska, granddaughter of John III Sobieski, king of Poland.[78][79][failed verification][80] In 1691, the City of Warsaw elected the Scottish immigrant Aleksander Czamer (Alexander Chalmers) as its mayor.[81]\n\nThere are places named after the Scottish settlers in Poland, i.e. Stare Szkoty (\"Old Scots\"), a former suburb of Gdańsk, today a neighborhood within the city limits, inhabited by Scots since the 15th and 16th centuries, and the village of Szkocja (\"Scotland\"), founded in 1823.[83][84]\n\nIn 1879, Scottish specialists were brought to Warsaw to run a newly established hornware factory of Polish industrialist Ludwik Józef Krasiński [pl].[85]\n\nIn the 2011 Polish census, 632 people declared Scottish nationality.[86]\n\nNotable people include:\n\nJames Murray (c. 1500s – c. 1600s), naval captain and shipbuilder\n\nRobert Abercromby (1536–1613), Jesuit missionary, lecturer at the Collegium Hosianum in Braniewo\n\nWilliam Bruce (c. 1560–after 1613), professor and lecturer at the Zamoyski Academy in Zamość, later diplomat of King James VI of Scotland.\n\nWilliam Davidson (c. 1593–c. 1669), court doctor of King John II Casimir Vasa of Poland[62]\n\nRobert Gilbert Porteous [pl] (c. 1600–1661), wealthiest merchant of 17th-century Krosno\n\nPatrick Gordon (1635–1699), student of the Collegium Hosianum, officer in the Polish Army\n\nAlexander Chalmers (1645–1703), merchant, jurist, city mayor in Warsaw\n\nSweden\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1570–1630, some 30,000 Scots served as mercenary soldiers of Sweden.\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nScotland portal\n\nEnglish-speaking world\n\nEuropean diaspora\n\nCeltic diaspora (disambiguation)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nFeduszka, Jacek (2009). \"Szkoci i Anglicy w Zamościu w XVI-XVIII wieku\".
