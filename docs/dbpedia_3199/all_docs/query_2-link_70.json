        "text": "This thesis examines the connection between the personal and political ideologies of King James VI of Scotland, his involvement in the two mass witch panics which took place during 1590-1 and 1597, and the writing of his treatise, Daemonologie, all of which occurred at a time of religious, social and political turmoil during the late sixteenth century. King James believed in the theory of divine right, and that he was accountable only to God. This belief led to conflict between James and his Kirk, with the Presbyterian ministers overtly questioning his ability to rule effectively. The witch-hunts which occurred in 1590-1 reflect James’ reaction to this conflict, and illustrate his ability to manipulate the existing events in order to further his own aims; namely to reinforce his divine right to rule, as well as assert the legitimacy of his throne. James’ treatise, Daemonologie, which is unique in that it is the only work of its kind written by an early modern European monarch, reflects both his involvement in the witch trials, as well as his views regarding kingship. Ultimately, James’ involvement in the trials and the writing of Daemonologie served to affirm his authority by underlining his belief in his God-given right to rule, and legitimized his unstable regime by reinforcing his authority over both the Kirk and his government. During the course of this research, numerous sixteenth-century documents, including personal correspondence, trial records and contemporary accounts were examined in order to determine the many intricacies connecting James, the witch trials, and Daemonologie, as well as the complex nature of their relationship. This thesis is organized chronologically, with individual sections highlighting the events which gave rise to the witch panics, the political climate at the time, the trials, and Daemonologie itself.\n\nA few months ago, a witchmark was found in the rafters of Knole House in Kent. It was put there by workers in 1606, just after the Gunpowder Plot, to protect the King James from witchcraft during his visit to the house. My paper investigates the complex intersection between witchcraft, drama, and politics that this witchmark represents. I start by briefly charting the history of magic and witchcraft in Early Modern plays, starting with the first generation of the professional playwrights in the 1580s, through its flowering in the first decade of the 17th Century and its decline in the 1620s and 1630s. I argue that with the ascension of James in 1603, who becomes king already freighted with a long association with witchcraft, there is palpable shift in the content of such plays from fantastic magic to specifically demonic witchcraft, specifically looking at Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and Shakespeare’s Macbeth as examples of the change. I tie the performance of witches on Early Modern stage into James’ marriage to Anne of Denmark, his activity in the witch trials that resulted from that marriage, and his own performance of heterosexuality and fitness for the English throne. I continue by evaluating each of these social forces according to the definition of performativity provided by Richard Schechner and using Victor Tuner’s ides of Deep Play, focusing particularly on his notions of restored actions, self-conscious activities and play.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to inquire into the common strand linking these two tragedies together, namely witchcraft as it was perceived in the early seventeenth century, in an attempt to gain some measure of insight into the then-conflicting Catholic and Protestant conceptions of evil and its degree of dominion in the world. As both poets wrote their tragedies under the reign of King James I (formerly King James VI of Scotland), a monarch renowned both for his erudition and his obsession with witchcraft, it seems likely that both would have made themselves familiar with James's 1597 tract Daemonologie, and drawn upon it to some extent for their own excursions into the realm of the diabolical. For this reason, our examination of Macbeth and Faustus will be made in close alignment with the King's treatise, in order to provide us with some sense of the presiding religious atmosphere under which they were composed.\n\nChristopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus powerfully epitomises the uncertainties and contradictions of the religious upheavals of the sixteenth century. While obsession with the Devil reached a high-water mark with the large-scale witchcraft persecutions of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, representatives of the Radical Reformation, such as Anabaptists, Libertines, or the Family of Love, began to question the existence of the Devil as part of a rigorous rejection of idolatry. Elizabethan drama in general, and Doctor Faustus in particular, likewise entertained a fraught relationship with its own, visual mode of representation which was not free from contemporary anxieties about visual representation. This paper argues that by putting devils center stage, Marlowe exposes them to widespread anxieties concerning the visual representation of the supernatural, which further highlights the play’s heterodox, spiritualising tendencies. However, while the devils’ role in Faustus’s downfall is constantly undermined in the A-text, the B-text is at pains to restore their credibility. Finally, such a revision of demonic agency in the play also holds important clues for a new assessment of the play’s treatment of predestination and how it relates to contemporary orthodoxy.\n\nThis article compares and contrasts England’s first three Witchcraft Acts (1542, 1563, and 1604) with demonological treatises published by English theologians and clerics between 1580 and 1627 with the intention of highlighting the different ways both types of texts defined witches and their actions. This research focuses on cunning folk as healers to emphasize the disparity of interests and aims that underpinned the representation of witchcraft in civil law and religious treatises concerning that issue. I suggest that during Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, discussions about the definition of witchcraft became one of the battlefields where those who thought the English Reformation had achieved its ends and those who propelled a more thorough disciplining of the population to create a godly society collided. I argue that demonological works served, among other purposes, to express grievances about the official religious policy"
