        "text": "Humza Yousaf, the former first minister of Scotland, has revealed the recent days of violent riots have left him unsure whether his family has a future in the UK.\n\nMr Yousaf - the first ethnic minority leader of a devolved government and the first Muslim to lead a major UK party when he became SNP leader and Scotland's first minister in March 2023 - described the past week of unrest as \"utterly horrendous\".\n\nViolent disorder has taken place in cities across England and in Northern Ireland following the killings of three young girls in Southport last week.\n\nThe unrest has been fuelled by misinformation online relating to the attacker.\n\nPolice forces across the country are braced for further disturbances, with reports of at least 30 more gatherings due to take place on Wednesday evening.\n\nUK riots latest:\n\nThousands of extra police mobilised ahead of 30 far-right protests\n\nSpeaking to The News Agents podcast, Mr Yousaf said: \"I'm about as Scottish as they come.\n\n\"Born in Scotland, raised in Scotland, educated in Scotland, just welcomed my third child here in Scotland, was the leader of the Scottish government for just over a year, leader of the Scottish National Party.\n\n\"You cut me open, I'm as about as Scottish as you come.\n\n\"But the truth of the matter is, I don't know whether the future for me and my wife and my three children is going to be here in Scotland or the United Kingdom, or indeed in Europe and the West, because I have for some time really worried about the rise of Islamophobia.\"\n\nMr Yousaf, who resigned as first minister in May, said the rise of the far-right was \"driven by Islamophobia in Europe, the UK and the West\".\n\nHe said rioters were \"going after people who are black, who are Asian, who are Muslim, and that, again, comes back to some of the language that's been used far too often in our politics about people not adopting our values\".\n\nMr Yousaf, the MSP for Glasgow Pollok, said he has no idea where his family would go, adding that \"Scotland is the country I love\".\n\nHe said: \"I don't want to go, let me just make that abundantly clear.\"\n\nMr Yousaf said Scotland is not immune from racism or Islamophobia, but added the UK has a \"pretty positive story to tell on multiculturalism\".\n\nHe cited his own turn as first minister, as well as Rishi Sunak - a British Hindu prime minister, and Sadiq Khan - Muslim mayor of London.\n\nMr Yousaf added: \"So, we actually have a strong history and heritage of multiculturalism over the years, but that is quite literally, actually in some parts of the UK, going up in flames.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has condemned the violence and has vowed to do \"whatever it takes to bring these thugs to justice\".\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney met with members of Scotland's Muslim community at Edinburgh Central Mosque earlier this week.\n\nHe branded the violence across other parts of the UK as \"completely unacceptable\" and said it would not be tolerated in Scotland.\n\nThe first minister added: \"There is no place in Scotland for hatred of any kind, and each of us has a responsibility to confront racism and religious prejudice wherever and whenever it appears.\n\n\"People will always try to divide us - and it is imperative in these moments that we come together even stronger to stand defiant.\"\n\nRead more:\n\nHow the far-right hijacked Southport protests\n\nSnapshot of people in court over UK riots\n\nPolice Scotland said it is providing reassurance to communities through enhanced patrols and direct engagement.\n\nAssistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie added: \"We will continue to monitor the situation to ensure any potential for violence or disorder in Scotland is identified quickly and responded to immediately.\n\n\"We are aware of a number of planned protests, and counter-protests, over the coming weeks, which will be policed appropriately.\""
