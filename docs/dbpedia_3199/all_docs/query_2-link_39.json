        "text": "Background information\n\nHow to search statutory death records\n\nThe content of statutory death records\n\n- 1855 register entries\n\n- Examples of statutory death records\n\n- Register of Corrected Entries\n\nBackground information\n\nThe statutory register of deaths dates from 1 January 1855 when compulsory, civil registration was introduced in Scotland. The records are indexed by personal name.\n\nIf you need a death certificate for official or legal purposes please go to Certificates and copies for guidance about online ordering. You have to register and login to use this service.\n\nIf you want to obtain copies for research there are options to view, save and print digital images of 1855-1973 entries and to order official paper certificates of those from 1974 onwards. The 50 year cut-off for viewing images of statutory death records online is in accordance with the National Records of Scotland's policy on protecting the privacy of individuals.\n\nDeaths is a record type in the advanced search category statutory registers and includes the Minor Records of deaths overseas. It covers the following:\n\nStatutory register of deaths (from 1855)\n\nAir register (from 1948) - deaths in any part of the world on British-registered aircraft where it appears that the deceased person was usually resident in Scotland\n\nConsular returns (from 1914) - certified copies of registrations by British consuls relating to persons of Scottish descent or birth\n\nRegister of births, deaths and marriages in foreign counties (1860-1965) - deaths of Scots with entries made on the basis of information supplied and after consideration of the evidence of each event\n\nHigh Commissioners' returns (from 1964) - records from certain Commonwealth countries relating to persons of Scottish descent or birth plus some earlier returns for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Ghana\n\nConsular and foreign records combined series (from 1975)\n\nMarine register (from 1855) - deaths in any part of the world on British-registered merchant vessels at sea where it appears that the deceased person was usually resident in Scotland\n\nService records (from 1881)\n\nArmy returns (1881-1959) - of Scottish persons at military stations abroad\n\nServices Departments' registers (from 1 April 1959) - deaths outside the United Kingdom relating to persons ordinarily resident in Scotland who were serving in, or employed by, HM Forces including families of members of the Forces\n\nWar registers (from 1899)\n\nDeaths of Scottish soldiers in the South African War (1899-1902)\n\nDeaths of Scottish persons serving as warrant officers, non-commissioned officers or men in the Army or as petty officers or men in the Royal Navy during the First World War (1914-1918)\n\nIncomplete returns of the deaths of Scottish members of the Armed Forces during the Second World War (1939-1945)\n\nPrinted lists of soldiers who died in the Great War, parts 1 to 80 - entries for Scottish soldiers have been indexed.\n\nFurther details are provided in the Minor Records catalogue on the National Records of Scotland website.\n\nAppendix 3 of the catalogue refers to the official printed lists for the First World War with the Scottish regiments highlighted in bold.\n\nAppendix 4 of the catalogue gives details of the cause of death associated with the codes included in the registers for Royal Navy and Royal Marines war deaths.\n\nFind out more about returns of deaths at sea (1902-1905) and the records of deaths of seamen serving on British vessels (1909-1974) in the feature article Deaths of Scottish Seafarers.\n\nHow to search statutory death records\n\nGo to advanced search - statutory registers - deaths. You have to add search data to the following index fields:\n\nSurname - please note that women are indexed under their maiden surname and any married surname(s)\n\nForename\n\nOther surname - enter a woman's maiden surname or a previous married surname to narrow your search. The index cannot distinguish between name types, for example, a search for a married woman named Brown with maiden surname Smith returns entries for a married woman Smith with maiden surname Brown. If the maiden and married surnames are the same search on surname and leave this field blank.\n\nMother’s maiden surname - this wasn't included in the statutory index of deaths until 1974. The information is being added retrospectively starting with the early years although you may find it in some later entries as a result of individual record updates. If you enter a name in this field and the information hasn't been included in the index the record will not be found.\n\nGender\n\nYear range - records are indexed by year of registration not year of death\n\nAge at death - not included in some 1855-1865 index entries, where it is shown as 'U', but is being added retrospectively\n\nBirth year\n\nCounty or city or Minor Records\n\nRegistration district - the drop-down menu displays all districts in Scotland unless a county or city has been selected; and registers and returns if Minor Records has been selected. Please note that not all districts are valid for all years. If a search returns no results for a specific district, try widening the search to 'All Districts' for the county. Find out more in our Parishes and districts guide.\n\nThe search form includes tips for each field with links to more detailed research guides where appropriate. You can sort search results by any field except Ref which combines the registration district and entry numbers.\n\nThe content of statutory death records\n\nMost register entries contain the following information:\n\nForename and surname\n\nRank, profession or occupation - if you find an unknown term check the glossary - occupations for further information\n\nWhether single, married or widowed\n\nDate, time and place of death\n\nGender\n\nAge at death (except 1855-1865) - ages for these years are being added retrospectively\n\nForename, surname and rank or profession of father\n\nForename and maiden surname of mother\n\nCause of death and duration of final illness - if you find an unknown term check the glossary - medical terms for further information\n\nName of medical attendant who certified the death\n\nSignature and qualification of informant and their residence (if not the place of death)\n\nWhen and where registered and signature of registrar\n\nPlace of burial, name of undertaker and when the doctor last saw the deceased alive (1855-1860)\n\n1855 register entries\n\nIn 1855, the first year of civil registration additional information was recorded:\n\nDeceased's place of birth\n\nHow long in the district or parish\n\nChildren in order of birth, their names and ages\n\nAs a result entries cover two pages and are especially valuable to researchers. This example shows entries 211 to 213 from the 1855 statutory register of deaths for the Royal Burgh of Dumfries in the county of Dumfries.\n\nImage\n\n1855 statutory register of deaths for Dumfries (National Records of Scotland, 1855/821/211-213)\n\nExamples of statutory death records\n\nThis example shows entries four to six in the 1901 statutory register of deaths for the district of Carloway in the county of Ross (registration district reference 86B). They record the deaths of three lighthouse keepers - James Ducat Principal, Thomas Marshall second Assistant and Donald MacArthur, Occasional Keeper - who disappeared from the Flannan Islands in December 1900. Their deaths were registered in February 1901 and the date of death is given as 15 December 1900. The entries are indexed under 1901 - the year of registration not the year of death. The words 'no medical attendant' have been crossed out in column six of each entry and the registrar has annotated the left-hand margin of the page with references to these clerical errors.\n\nImage\n\nStatutory register of deaths for Carloway (National Records of Scotland, 1901/86B/4-6)\n\nOther examples of statutory death records are:\n\nEntry for Robert Louis Stevenson, author, in the foreign register of deaths (National Records of Scotland, 1894/161/FN/23) shown in colour at the top of this page\n\nEntry for William Murdoch, First Officer on RMS Titanic, in the feature article Scots on the Titanic\n\nEntries for Mary Jane Pritchard (showing the original cause of death) and that of her husband, Edward William Pritchard, who was found guilty of her murder are included in The Glasgow poisoner\n\nEntries for Scots who died on the 'Lusitania', in a fishing-boat accident or when on board are included in Deaths of Scottish Seafarers.\n\nRegister of Corrected Entries\n\nThe Register of Corrected Entries (RCE) - the Register of Corrections Etc from 1966 - records additional authorised information about the death following registration. This usually means further details about cause of death in cases of sudden, accidental and violent deaths. An RCE reference is inserted beside the original entry in the statutory register of deaths. Images of entries with an RCE include a link to the RCE page which is free to view.\n\nIn the example for the Flannan Islands lighthouse keepers above there are RCE references beside each entry. This detail from the RCE page for James Ducat shows that the cause of death was probably drowning as his body had not been recovered. The mystery of what happened to the three men has never been solved.\n\nImage\n\nDetail from RCE page relating to the death of James Ducat (National Records of Scotland, 1901/86B/4)\n\nHere are more examples of RCEs which relate to:\n\nDeaths of David Neish, schoolmaster and registrar, and his daughter Isabella are included in The Tay Bridge Disaster\n\nDeaths of Jessie Gordon, John Gordon and John Sinclair following a fire in a mining village on 6 March 1921 in Housing Shale Miners at Oakbank, Kirknewton\n\nDeath of Jane Taylor in The Glasgow Poisoner about the case of her son-in-law, Edward William Pritchard, who was found guilty of her murder.\n\nIf you order an official certificate of a death entry with an RCE it will be typed with any corrections or insertions applied.\n\nYou may find corrections on a register entry along with notes in the margins of the page indicating which column(s) has been amended and the registrar's initials - as in the example above. These are known as clerical errors and are not RCEs."
