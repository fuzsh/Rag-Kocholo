        "text": "James Donald was described as “the clever Vale of Leven forward” during his time at the club in 1916. He started his career at Vale Allandale, before moving to Vale of Leven. During his time at the Alexandria based club, James played a couple of trial matches for the Jags, the first in the Glasgow and District Midweek League against Kilmarnock at Firhill on 4 March 1913, the away side winning by 3 goals to nil. His second and final contest in Thistle colours was at the end of the 1914-15 season, when he played against Celtic in the Glasgow Charity Cup Final at Firhill. The match ended 1-1, but Celtic won 4-3 on corners. James played in the outside right position in both matches. A report in the Daily Record of 20 January 1916 stated that James had joined the Army Service Corps. After the war, James returned to Vale of Leven, and subsequently went on to play for Nithsdale Wanderers.\n\nOn account of his service during WWI, James is included in our feature piece, The Partick Thistle returned →."
