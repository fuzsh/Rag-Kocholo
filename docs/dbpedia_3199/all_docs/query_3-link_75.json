        "text": "James Donald Austell, 85 of Moncks Corner, SC, the epitome of a true Southern gentleman, passed peacefully in his sleep with his family at his side. Born on December 19, 1938 in Paint Rock Valley, Alabama, Donald was the son of Joseph Austell and Mary Austell Mullins. He is preceded in death by his parents and grandson James Donald Austell III. He is survived by his wife of twenty years, Paige Baxley Austell; brother Thomas Mullins (Betty) and sister Cesta Mullins Ford; daughters Jane Donna Wilkins and Cathy O’Brien; son James Austell Jr.; 11 grandchildren; 19 great grandchildren; and five stepchildren.\n\nAt the age of eight, Donald’s family moved to the Park Circle area of North Charleston. Don had a love for all sports, but he mostly enjoyed and excelled in Golden Gloves boxing. In high school, he learned to shag at the Folly Beach pier and continued his love for our state dance as a member of The Charleston Shag Club and The Islander Shag Club. He graduated from North Charleston High and was named “Best Dressed” by his classmates. After graduation, he was employed by Westvaco until he became an electrician at the Charleston Naval Yard where he rose to the job of Supervisor of Shipbuilding. Don completed his career after the shipyard closed in New Orleans, but the charm of the Lowcountry was just too strong. Don retired in 1994 and moved back home. His love of people led to a retirement job working as a student concern specialist in CCSD for 12 years. His job allowed him to be a mentor to many students at St. Andrew’s, James Island, and North Charleston High School.\n\nDonald always felt the need to serve his community. He was a little league baseball coach, served in the SC Army National Guard, a lifetime member of The Charleston Elks Lodge #242, served two terms on Hanahan City Council, two terms on the Berkeley Country Club Board of Directors, and a Clemson IPTAY representative for countless years.\n\nHis love for all things Clemson, shagging, golf, and traveling the United States made his marriage a match made in heaven. One of his good friends said, “Don has a special gift to make anyone feel like they are the most important person in the room,” and he did just that until his final breath.\n\nThe Celebration of Life will be at Berkeley Country Club in Moncks Corner, SC on Tuesday, February 13, 2024 from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM. In lieu of flowers, please make a donation to either the Alzheimer’s Association or the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nFuneral Arrangements have been entrusted to Palmetto Cremation Society, 5638 N. Rhett Ave., North Charleston, SC, 29406, 843-722-2555."
