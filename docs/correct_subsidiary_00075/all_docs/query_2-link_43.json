The purpose^ of disseminating these courses was to make curriculum materials (tevelcpted by the military more accessible to vocational educators in the civilian setting . The course materials were acquired , evaluated by project staff and practitioners ;in the field, and prepared for dissemination. Materials which were specific to the military were deleted, copyrighted materials were either emitted \"or appro- val for their use was Qbtained. TheSe course packages contain curriculum resource materials which can be adapted to support vocational instruction and curriculum development. v the National Center Mission Statement The National Center for Research in Vocational Education's mission is to increase the ability of diverse agencies, institutions,, and organizations to solve educational prob- lems relating to individual career planning, preparation, and progression. The National Center fulfills its mission by: • Generating knowledge through research • Developing educational programs and products • Evaluating individual program needs and outcomes * Installing educational programs and products Operating information systems and services * Conducting readership .development and training prograr FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT.

This project, funded by the U.S. Office of Education, includes the identification and acquisition of curriculum materials in print form from the Coast Guard, Air Force, Army, Marine Corps and Navy. Access to military curriculum materials is provided through a \"Jotat Memorandum of Jnderstanding\" betweenjthe U.S. Office of Education ^nd the Department ofOefense. The acquired materials are reviewed by staff and subject matter specialises, and courses deemed applicable to vocational* and tech- nical education are selectedifor dissemination. The National Center for Research in Vocational Education is the U.S. Office of Education's designated representative to acquire the materials and conduct the project activities. Project Staff: . Wesley E. Budke, Ph.D., Director National Center Clearinghouse Shirley A. Chase; Ph.D. p^\"*ct Director ERIC One hundred twenty courses on microfiche (thirteen in paper form) and descriptions of each have been provided to the vocational Curriculum Coordination Centers and other instructional materials agencies for dissemi- nation/' Course materials include programmed instruction, curriculum outlines, instructor guides, student workbooks apd technical manuals.
