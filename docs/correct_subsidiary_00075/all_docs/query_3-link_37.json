This volume contains a large variety of papers written by his former students and colleagues. They provide testimony to the global influence of the teaching and research of professor Chang. I had the good fortune to have him as a graduate student in the early sixties. He did research towards a doctor of philosophy degree in Applied Physics at Harvard University. He was a co-author on a half-dozen papers concerned with the fundamentals of second harmonic generation of light in a variety of materials. They verified the basic laws of nonlinear reflection and refraction. Richard's promise as a graduate student has been amply fulfilled by his subsequent as a professor of applied physics at Yale University. This volume represents a well-deserved testimony to his scientific legacy.\n\nNicolaas Bloembergen University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA\n\nThis page is intentionally lefl blank\n\n7\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis Festschrift is a collection of articles contributed by former students and colleagues of an eminent scholar on a special occasion: Richard Kounai Chang on his retirement from Yale University on June 12, 2008. Richard’s extensive experimental and theoretical research spanning four decades defined the frontiers of what can be learnt using linear and nonlinear optical techniques in surface science, electrochemistry and colloids, microparticles and bioaerosols, microcavities and nanostructures. Chang’s approach to multidisciplinary research is reflected in the Yale University Center for Laser Diagnostics (CLD), which he founded in 1976. CLD is a testament to the importance and cross fertilization of interdisciplinary research with faculty members from Applied Physics, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. Chang himself was a professor of Applied Physics, Physics and Electrical Engineering. For his distinguished academic achievements, Yale University honored him with the Henry Ford II Chair Professor for Applied Physics. For his lasting contributions to optics, laser diagnostics, and chemistry of aerosols, droplets and microparticles, The American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) honored him with the David Sinclair Award. Colleagues have noted that, professor Chang’s work is inventive, seminal, and very often beautiful. We, his former students, are most indebted for the inspiration this great scholar gave us. Richard, our deeply respected teacher and a close friend, lit the path for us and also travels with us. We are most fortunate to see first-hand how this incredible gentleman brings out the very best in academic research and in life. This volume is only in a crystallizing glimpse of Richard Kounai Chang’s scientific legacy, and his global influence to the people, whom he has come to interact with in both scientific and personal ways. Chang started his academic life working with Nobel Laureate Professor Nicolaas Bloembergen during the early sixties. His thesis work on second harmonic generation (SHG) from surfaces of centrosymmetric media verified the basic laws of nonlinear reflection and refraction, and provided basis for later development of important nonlinear spectroscopic tools for surface and interface studies. In 1966, he joined the Department of Applied Physics at Yale University, where he continued his nonlinear optics research in a variety of materials. His early work on nonlinear optical processes in surfaces led to his later role in spearheading the development of such technologically relevant nonlinear spectroscopic tools using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) and other nonlinear processes for electro-\n\n8\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nchemistry and colloidal science. His early work on SERS is seminal for what we now call nanoplasmonics. Chang pioneered the study of nonlinear optics in micrometer-sized droplets, which elegantly confine light in the droplet circumference as sharp morphology-dependent resonances (MDRs) or what are now commonly known as whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). Chang’s group was the first to observe in the WGMs of microdroplets optical processes such as lasing, stimulated Raman scattering, sum-frequency generation and stimulated Brillouin scattering. Chang’s group was also among the first to explore a large variety of linear and nonlinear effects in microdroplets and microcylinders including elastic scattering, fluorescence, spontaneous Raman scattering, coherent Raman mixing, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), multiorder Stokes emission, laser induced-plasma breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), explosive vaporization and twophoton pumped lasing. These early work formed the basis of using WGMs for sensitive laser-based microparticle sizing and diagnostic of chemical and biochemical compositions in microparticles, and also stimulated much research interest in optical processes in microcavities. In the last decade, Chang’s group has worked intensively on developing linear and nonlinear spectroscopy for microparticles. His unparalleled insights into linear and nonlinear optical processes in microparticles have led to development of techniques to rapidly interrogate and sort on the fly, particle by particle, biological agents such as anthrax from other ambient respirable airborne particles. Richard initiated this research well before the September 11 attacks, which now forms the basis for some of the most promising defenses against biological weapons. Chang’s group has also been studying lasing micropillars of different cavity shapes in polymers and compound semiconductors. This work has opened new avenues for microcavities, namely controlling the optical coupling via cavity shape deformations and optimizing the optical and electrical pumping configurations by selectively exciting the WGMs. Recently, Chang’s group introduced the microspiral resonators, which demonstrated unidirectional lasing in InGaN quantum-well (QW) microlasers, thus breaking the clockwise and counter-clockwise symmetry. Colleagues have noted how beautifully simple the microspiral resonator concept is, and how important that microstructure will be in the nascent development of electrophotonic integrated circuits (EPICs). The Festschrift has contributions from academia, national laboratories and industries, across disciplines and countries. We include work from Richard’s native Hong Kong China, to his blooming in the United States, as well as Canada, Germany, Israel, Korea, Russia, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. The contributors span departments and schools of Applied Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Biophotonics, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Chemical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Electronic and Computer\n\nPreface\n\n9\n\nEngineering, Materials Science, Mechanical Engineering, Information Technology, Optics, Photonics, Physics and Physical Chemistry. In the light of the broad variety and global coverage of Richard’s influence, including a chapter by everyone is a huge, if not an impossible, task. We therefore seek to reflect a representative set of Richard’s many research contributions in this collection, while recognizing this might only do partial justice to his scientific legacy and the many people, who were part of this journey.\n\nPart I Nonlinear Optics & Spectroscopy includes chapters 1 - 4. Chapter 1 by Y. Ron Shen of the University of California, Berkeley, on the topic of Nonlinear optical spectroscopy for interfaces highlights earlier pioneering work of Richard Chang on laying the foundation for development of second-harmonic generation and sum-frequency generation as surface-specific spectroscopic tools. Chapter 2 by Andreas Otto of Heinrich-Heine-Universität Düsseldorf on the topic of Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) of carbon dioxide on cold-deposited copper films discusses the SERS and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy spectra of carbon dioxide on cold-deposited copper films, and reveals an electronic effect at a minority of surface sites. Chapter 3 by Alfred Leipertz and Thomas Seeger of Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, on the topic of Combustion diagnostics by pure rotational coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering (CARS) reviews pure rotational CARS fundamentals and their technological applications to combustion diagnostics, flame research and practical combustion systems. Chapter 4 by Marshall Long of Yale University on the topic of Imaging flames reviews the use of laser light scattering mechanisms in multiparameter imaging experiments for quantitative study of flames and comparison with combustion models.\n\nPart II Linear & Nonlinear Optics in Microparticles includes chapters 5 - 8. Chapter 5 by E. James Davis of University of Washington, Seattle, on the topic of Elastic and inelastic light scattering from levitated microparticles reviews numerous applications of laser light scattering measurements from single levitated solid-state microspheres or microdroplets to basic studies of physical, chemical, and optical properties in microparticles and droplets. Morphology-dependent resonances (MDRs) are applied to study the size and refractive index of droplets, microspheres and coated spheres. The application of inelastic scattering to biological particles detection is also discussed.\n\n10\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nChapter 6 by Claudiu Dem, Michael Schmitt, Wolfgang Kiefer and Jürgen Popp of Friedrich-Schiller University Jena, University Würzburg and Institute of Photonic Technology, Jena, on the topic of Physical chemistry and biophysics of single trapped microparticles reviews work on combined inelastic / elastic (Raman-Mie) light scattering studies of single microparticles trapped by optical / electrodynamical forces and their applications to several microchemical reactions and on elastic scattering on a femtosecond timescale. The use of MDRs-induced peaks in the Raman spectra as a diagnostic probe of the microparticles physical properties and dynamics of chemical reactions is discussed. A few pharmaceutical applications are highlighted. Chapter 7 by Alfred S. Kwok of Pomona College on the topic of Cavity-enhanced emission in fluorescent microspheres revisits some of Richard Chang’s first MDR experiments. MDRs in the lasing spectra of dye-coated polystyrene microspheres and the fluorescence spectra in quantum dot-coated microspheres are discussed. Chapter 8 by Mikhail V. Jouravlev of Pohang University of Science and Technology and Gershon Kurizki of Weizmann Institute of Science on the topic of Theory of Raman amplification in microspheres presents the unified theory of spontaneous and stimulated Raman scattering in microspherical cavities. The reduction of the threshold intensity and the increase of the gain upon input and output resonances near MDRs are analyzed based on the coupling of the internal partial waves in nonlinear cavities.\n\nPart III Linear & Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Bioaerosols includes chapters 9 - 11. Chapter 9 by Hermes C. Huang of Yale University and Yong-Le Pan, Steven C. Hill and Ronald G. Pinnick of the U.S. Army Research Laboratory on the topic of Fluorescencebased classification with selective collection and identification of individual airborne bioaerosol particles reviews the development of techniques for bioaerosol detection and characterization spearheaded by Richard Chang’s group and collaborators at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory over the last decade. The chapter focuses on the development of the Single-Particle Fluorescence Spectrometer (SPFS) for real-time, in-situ monitoring, classification, sorting and collection of bioaerosols.

RON SHEN Physics Department, University of California Berkeley, California 94720 USA [email protected]\n\nEarlier pioneering work of Richard Chang set the foundation for the development of secondharmonic generation and sum-frequency generation as surface-specific spectroscopic tools that have created many new opportunities for research in surface science.\n\nNonlinear optical spectroscopy has created many exciting new opportunities for material studies. One of the areas it has had strong impact on is surface science. We discuss here the development of second-harmonic and sum-frequency generation as surface analytical tools.1 They have become in recent years the most powerful and versatile spectroscopic probes for surface and interface studies. As second-order nonlinear optical processes, they are forbidden in media with inversion symmetry under the electric-dipole approximation, but at the surface or interface, the inversion symmetry is broken and the processes become allowed. Dominated by surface contribution, the processes can then be used as surface-specific probes. More generally, surface and bulk have different structural symmetry, and it is possible to have the two contributions to the nonlinear optical processes deduced separately. There are a number of advantages using second harmonic generation (SHG) and sumfrequency generation (SFG) as surface probes.1 They are surface-specific, and have submonolayer sensitivity. Being coherent optical processes, they generate an output that is highly directional and easily distinguishable from the non-coherent background such as fluorescence, and can be used for in situ, remote sensing studies. The techniques are nondetrimental as long as the input laser intensities are below the laser damage threshold. As laser spectroscopy, they are capable of having very high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. Most important of all is that the techniques are applicable to all interfaces as long as the interfaces are accessible by both input and output light. The last point makes the techniques most versatile in comparison with other surface probes. As a result, SHG and SFG have found many unique applications. Among them are studies of buried interfaces, surface structures of neat materials such as polymers and liquids, molecular\n\n20\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nadsorption and reactions under ambient conditions, surface dynamics, and surface microscopy. All these are important areas of surface science, but have hardly been explored because of limitation of conventional surface probes. Investigation of SHG and SFG from surfaces can be traced back to the earlier work of Richard Chang as a graduate student in Professor Bloembergen’s lab. His work2 on SHG in reflection from Si and Ge surfaces, and Brown and coworkers’ work3 on SHG in reflection from silver surfaces constitute the first study of SHG from media with inversion symmetry. They had in mind the use of SHG to probe surface nonlinearity,4 but unfortunately their results were complicated by surface contamination and lack of good understanding of surface contributions to SHG at the time. In a subsequent paper, however, Bloembergen, Chang, et al.5 developed the macroscopic theory of SHG from a medium with inversion symmetry. It assumes a three-layer model with the surface or interface treated as a thin layer with optical constants different from the bulk. This is still the model we follow today to understand surface SHG and SFG.\n\nω ω\n\nω\n\nω Fig. 1. Schematic of the beam geometry with respect to the sample in a sum-frequency spectroscopic measurement.\n\nFrom the three-layer model with the beam geometry sketched in Fig. 1, one can show that the sum-frequency output of photons per pulse generated from the system by the overlapping input beams at ω1 and ω2 is given by6\n\nSi (ω = ω1 + ω 2 ) ~\n\nwith\n\n8π 3ω (2) 2 | Fii (ω ) χ eff ,ijk F jj (ω1 ) Fkk (ω 2 ) | I1 (ω1 ) I 2 (ω 2 ) AT hc 3\n\nt\n\nt\n\n(1)\n\nt\n\nχ eff(2) = χ S(2) + i χ B(2) / ∆k\n\n(2) Here, I1(ω1) and I2(ω2) are intensities of input beams at ω1 and ω2, respectively, from medium 1, Fαα (ωi ) is the transmission Fresnel coefficient at ωi , A and T the beam t t overlapping area and time at the interface, χ S(2) and χ B(2) are the surface and bulk susceptibilities of the interfacial layer and medium 2, respectively, assuming the bulk nonlinear susceptibility of medium 1 is negligible, and ∆k is the phase mismatch for the SFG process in medium 2. Note that SHG is a special case of SFG with ω1= ω2. From Eqs. (1) and (2), it is seen that because ∆k ~105/cm for SFG in reflection (much smaller in transmission) and | χ S(2) | ~ 10-7 | χ B(2) | in esu units, if | χ B(2) | is allowed, the bulk contribution often dominates, but if | χ B(2) | is not allowed, then | χ S(2) | could be dominant and SFG become surface-specific. This is often the case for bulk media with inversion symmetry in which second-order nonlinear optical processes are forbidden by symmetry.1\n\nNonlinear Optical Spectroscopy for Interfaces\n\n21\n\nA crude estimate using typical values of | χ S(2) | ~ 10−15 esu for a surface monolayer, and I1 ~ I 2 ~ 10 GW/cm 2 for 10-ps inputs of 100 J/pulse focused to an overlapping area of A ~ 0.1 mm 2 in Eq. (1) yields a surface SFG signal of 104 photons/pulse, which should be readily detectable. This shows that SFG can be very sensitive as a surface analytical tool. Moreover, the existence of several independent, nonvanishing tensor elements of χ S(2),ijk that can be separately deduced from SFG measurements with different input/output polarization combinations allows us to obtain information on interfacial structure and molecular arrangement. Here, we use the neat water/vapor interface as an example to illustrate how SFG can serve as a powerful surface spectroscopic tool. Water interfaces play key roles in many relevant physical, chemical, and biological processes. Understanding of these processes requires knowledge of water interfacial structures at the molecular level.7 Orientations and bonding arrangement of water molecules at an interface are expected to be very different than in the bulk, and they determine the interfacial properties and hence the interfacial processes. Such information can be obtained from the vibrational spectra of water interfaces. To date, however, SFG is the only technique that can provide such spectra. Vapor-water interfaces have attracted much interest not only because they are important in environmental science,8 but also because they serve as standard references for all water interfaces.\n\n(a)\n\nWavenumber ( cm-1 )\n\n(b)\n\nWavenumber ( cm-1 ) (2) (2) 2 Fig. 2. Sum-frequency vibrational spectra of water/vapor interface. (a) | χS,eff | and (b)Im χS versus input IR frequency. (Reproduced from Refs. 10 and 13).\n\n22\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nWhat we can learn from the spectrum in Fig. 2a and other spectra with different input/output polarization combinations for the same water interface is that the interfacial water structure appears as a highly disordered, strongly fluctuating, largely tetrahedral Hbonding network with some molecules having local ice-like bonding structure. The surface has an overall structure more ordered than the bulk, as expected from surface tension. One would, however, like to learn more about the interface from the spectrum such as which water species contribute to which spectral region and how they react to ions or adsorbates appearing at the interface. This would require more detailed characterization of surface resonances contributing to the spectrum. In analogy to Im ε (ω ) that describes an absorption or emission spectrum, we need to have the spectrum of Im χ S(2) (instead of | χ S(2) |2 ) in order to directly characterize surface resonances. For water interfaces, we have (2) | χ S(2) |2 =| χ NR +∫\n\nIm χ\n\n(2) S\n\n= Im ∫\n\nAq (ω q ) ρ (ω q )dω q\n\nω 2 − ω q + iΓ q\n\nAq (ω q ) ρ (ω q )dω q\n\nω 2 − ω q + iΓ q\n\n|2 (3)\n\n∝ Aq (ω q ) ρ (ω q )\n\nAs seen from the above equations, it is not possible to obtain Im χ S(2) from | χ S(2) |2 . Measurements of both | χ S(2) |2 and the phase φ of χ S(2) are necessary to acquire the complete information on χ S(2) and deduce Im χ S(2) . This is generally true for all coherent nonlinear wave-mixing processes as first recognized by Chang et al.12 They set up the first nonlinear interferometric experiment to measure the phase of a nonlinear susceptibility for SHG from a nonlinear crystal. Phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopic measurement on neatwater/vapor interface was recently carried out.13 It provided the Im χ S(2) spectrum for the interface displayed in Fig. 2b. Knowing that the dangling OH peak describes O→H pointing out of the water, we can easily identify the positive ice-like band comes mainly from DDAA water species straddling DDA and DAA molecules in the topmost layer with upward ice-like donor H-bonds. The more loosely bonded DDAA species with net polar orientations of O→H pointing toward the water bulk contributes to the negative liquid-like band up to ~3500 cm-1, and the DDA and DAA species with O→H pointing toward water are mainly responsible for the part of the negative band above 3500 cm-1. The latter assignment was deduced from the observation that this part of the spectrum did not change when ions emerge at the interface; the surface field created by the ions could reorient the more loosely bonded DDAA molecules and change their spectrum accordingly, but not the DDA and DAA molecules because they could not experience the strong surface field. Extension of the measurement to water/vapor interfaces of various acid, base, and salt solutions has yielded much better understanding of how ions would appear at a water interface and affect the water interfacial structure.14 SF spectroscopy with ultrashort pulses in a pump/probe scheme also allows us to investigate in situ ultrafast surface dynamics. Here again, we use water/vapor interfaces\n\n23\n\nNonlinear Optical Spectroscopy for Interfaces\n\nas an example.15 There is strong interest in the science community in learning how vibrational excitation energy at a water interface decays away. Obviously, we need a surface-specific probe to monitor the decay of the surface excitation. In the reported experiment,14 an infrared femtosecond pump pulse was directed onto a water/silica interface. It excited a narrow range of OH stretch vibrations of water molecules both at the interface and in the bulk. Significant population transfer from the ground state to the vibrational excited state of the pumped molecules could occur with a sufficiently strong pump, and created a spectral hole in the vibrational spectrum of the water molecules. Evolution of the spectral hole in time provided information on the relaxation of the excitation. Since the interest was on surface vibrational dynamics, time-dependent SF vibrational spectroscopy with femtosecond pulses was employed as a probe to discriminate surface against the bulk. It monitored only how the OH stretch spectrum of the water interface changed with time after the pump pulse even though bulk excitation was also present. The result showed that spectral diffusion first broadened the spectral hole appreciably in less than 100 fs after the pump, vibrational relaxation from the excited state then happened with a time constant of ~300 fs, and finally the deposited energy appeared as heat to increase the local water temperature in ~700 ps. This relaxation pathway is qualitatively similar to that of vibrational excitation in bulk water,16 and is probably the generic characteristic of vibrational excitation/relaxation processes in a hydrogen-bonding network. Applications of SHG and SFG as surface analytical tools are not restricted to bulk media with inversion symmetry. Because surface and bulk generally have different structural symmetry, it is possible to use specific geometry and input/output polarization combinations to suppress the bulk contribution and make the surface contribution dominant.17 We take crystalline α−quartz as an example.18 SHG and SFG are allowed in quartz.18 The nonvanishing nonlinear susceptibility elements of the bulk (2) (2) are χ)B(2),aaa = − χ B(2),abb = − χ B(2),bba = − χ B(2),bab , χ B,abc = −χB,bac , χ B(2),acb = − χ B(2),bca and χ B(2),cab = − χ B(2),cba , where ) ) ) ) (a , b , c ) refer )to the coordinates with c along the 3-fold axis, a along the 2) crystalline ) ) fold axis, and a , b ⊥ c . For the (0001) surface (with c along the surface normal), the (2) (2) nonvanishing elements of the surface nonlinear susceptibility are χ S(2),ccc , χ S ,aac = χ S ,bbc , χ S(2),aca = χ S(2),bcb ≈ χ S(2),caa = χ S(2),cbb . If the input beams are in an incident plane rotated by Φ away from the a axis, then it can be readily seen from Eq. (2) that for SSP (denoting S-, S-, and P-polarizations for SF, visible, and infrared fields, respectively) and PPP polarization (2) combinations, χeff has the form (2) (2) (2) χSSP ,eff = Lyy (ωSF )Lyy (ωvis )[Lzz (ωIR)sinθIRχS,aac + Lxx (ωIR )cosθIRiχB,aaa cos3Φ/ ∆k] (2) (2) χ PPP , eff ≈ − Lxx (ω SF ) Lxx (ω vis ) Lzz (ω IR ) cos θ SF cos θ vis sin θ IR χ S , aac\n\n+ Lzz (ω SF ) Lzz (ωvis ) Lzz (ω IR )sin θ SF sin θ vis sin θ IR χ S(2),ccc\n\n+ Lxx (ω SF ) Lxx (ωvis ) Lxx (ω IR ) cosθ SF cos θ vis cosθ IR i χ t (2)\n\n(2) B , aaa\n\n(4)\n\ncos 3Φ / ∆k\n\nIf Φ is set to make cos3Φ vanish, then only χ S contributes to χ eff(2) . Shown in Fig. 3 are the SSP spectra of the α–quartz (0001) surface. It is seen that the bulk phonon mode at\n\n24\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nFig. 3. SSP sum-frequency vibrational spectra of α-quartz(0001) taken at φ = 30o and 31.8o (curves are guides to eyes). (Reproduced from Ref. 18).\n\n1064 cm-1 is strongly suppressed when Φ changes from 31.80 to 300, while the surface phonon modes at 880 cm-1 (Si-O-Si) and 980 cm-1 (Si-OH) remain unchanged. This illustrates how the surface spectra of a non-centrosymmetric crystal can be obtained. There are many areas of research surface-specific second-harmonic and sumfrequency spectroscopy have hardly explored. Bio-interfaces, electrochemical interfaces, nanostructure interfaces, and interfacial catalytic reactions are among the most important ones. Further development of the techniques is also anticipated as their applications become more wide spread.\n\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the NSF Science and Technology Center of Advanced Materials for Purification of Water with Systems (Water CAMPWS; CTS-0120978), and by the Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC03-76SF00098.\n\nReferences 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9.\n\nY.

The SERS spectra of CO2 on copper films deposited at 40 K display neutral species at SERS active sites with bands not observed by Raman spectroscopy of CO2 gas, but identical to the loss bands of gaseous CO2 in electron energy loss spectroscopy. The absence of one component of the Fermi doublet of CO2 in SERS proves that the local electromagnetic field enhancement at SERS active sites cannot deliver signals above the noise level. The activated anionic CO2- is observed by transient electron transfer from the anionic molecule to the copper metal at a subgroup of SERS active sites, which are annealed below 200 K. The IRRAS spectra show only the expected infrared (IR) active modes of neutral CO2 representing the “majority species” of adsorbed CO2.\n\n1. Introduction Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) was first introduced to a wider public by a book edited by Richard K. Chang and Thomas E. Furtak1 and a review article by Richard K. Chang.2 SERS has not developed in a straightforward way. To give two examples, from the early days and from present days: I remember that I attended the Conference on the optical properties of thin films, Southampton, 24.-26.9. 1973. A chairman allowed someone not belonging to the conference before the session started to point out an important new discovery. As it was in Southampton it is probable that the strange intruder was Martin Fleischmann. I cannot recall what the topic was (maybe the contents of Ref. 3?). Only after D.L. Jeanmaire and R.P. Van Duyne published their famous paper4 (received by the publisher 7. Oct.1976) the first “SERS rush” started. Triggered by two papers by Katrin Kneipp and her collaborators5,6 and by Ref. 7 the “Single molecule SERS rush“ started. The state of the field in 2007 has been described in Ref. 8. The fantastic high enhancement factors quoted have been questioned recently.9,10\n\n28\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nThe resonance Raman effect is no prerequisite of single molecule SERS11,12 Single molecule SERS on single colloidal particles has been reported in Ref. 13. Tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy of adsorbates at single crystal noble metal surfaces in ultra high vacuum does now reach single molecule sensitivity.14 SERS has also come a long way to discuss the mechanisms involved. Here I cite Martin Moskovits:15 “The electromagnetic theory of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), despite its simplicity, can account for all major SERS observations. However, the electromagnetic model does not account for all that is learned through SERS. Molecular resonances, charge-transfer transitions and other processes such as ballistic electrons transiently probing the region where the molecule resides and then modulating electronic processes of the metal as a result certainly contribute to the rich information SERS reports; and by virtue of the fact that these contributions will vary from molecule to molecule, they will constitute the most interesting aspects reported by SERS.” The most interesting developments beyond classical metal optics come from the theory of small clusters. The low laser frequency (chemical), transient charge transfer (CT) and electromagnetic (EM) local field enhancement of the vibrational bands of pyridine at vertex-site and in the middle of a (111) facet (S-complex) of an Ag20 cluster have been calculated by Schatz and coworkers.16 At laser frequencies fitting to the charge transfer energies, surprising high enhancements have been found. A somewhat different calculation for pyridine in an S-complex of a Ag20 cluster comes to the same conclusion.17 Zhao et al.18 presented a detailed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) investigation of the absorption and Raman spectra of a pyrazine molecule located at the junction between two Ag20 clusters. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering enhancements of the order of 106 have been found for the junction system, which are similar to enhancements of 105 found for individual silver nanoparticles. Surprisingly, the chemical enhancement was found to account for as much as 105, suggesting that this mechanism might be more important than previously believed, in particular for nanoparticle aggregates. Moreover, TDDFT calculations suggested that unlike larger nanoparticles, the junction between small Ag20 tetrahedral clusters does not provide an electromagnetic “hot spot.” DJ Wu et al19 employed density functional theory (DFT) to obtain information about surface bonding and adsorption by calculating and analyzing the relative intensity of SERS spectra of pyridine on noble and transition metals. The transient charge transfer model has been described recently in Ref. 20, the shift of the resonance frequencies and the selection rules of SERS at electrodes as function electrode potential for instance in Ref. 21. Based on the standard Kramers-Heisenberg equation and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, Ref. 22 shows that SERS can be considered as a single effect, drawing on up to three resonances, plasmon, charge transfer, and molecular resonance. In spite of this, the analytical practitioner of SERS understandably longs for the pure EM-enhancer, with the same sensitivity for all different adsorbents and a good EM theory as a guide for the nano-fabrication of the substrates. A very promising candidate for reproducible EM nano-enhancers are Metal Films Over uniform and densely packed\n\nSERS of Carbon Dioxide on Cold-deposited Copper Films\n\n29\n\nNano-spheres (MFON, M=Ag, Au), developed in the Van Duyne-group. In the next section I will point out their relation with the “chemical effects.” 2. AgFON and their relation to the “chemical effect” 2.1. AgFON in ultra high vacuum (UHV) (Ref. 23) This paper Ref. 23 concludes: “Room temperature annealing does not irreversibly destroy the SERS enhancement capability of this surface, thereby permitting for repeated use in UHV experiments. The AgFON surface morphology and localized surface plasmon resonance frequencies, as monitored by UV-VIS extinction, change as the AgFON surface temperatures increases from 300 to 548 K, and the SERS activity corresponds with these changes. Because the AgFON surface is thermally stable at room temperature and retains high SERS-activity following temperature annealing to 573K, it is unlikely that adatoms or adatom clusters play a significant role as adsorption sites supporting the chemical enhancement mechanism. Rather, one can conclude that the electromagnetic enhancement mechanism is the most likely origin of the SER spectra from benzene, pyridine, and C60 adsorbed on AgFON surfaces.”\n\nFig. 1. Regeneration of the AgFON surface. (A) SER spectra of 5L of pyridine on a new AgFON surface. (B) AgFON surface which has been Ar+-ion sputtered for 3h at 1keV, annealed to 573K for 2 h, and then redeposited with 120-nm of silver. Spectra were taken with 18mW of λex = 514.5nm for 200s.\n\nFrom Fig. 2B in Litorja et al.’s article23 follows an EM enhancement G of about 21375 (log G = 4.32) for the breathing vibration of pyridine on AgFON. This is the same order of magnitude as the EM enhancement of the Raman scattering of the benzene breathing vibration of one monolayer of benzene adsorbed on well isolated silver islands on randomly distributed SiO2 posts (“stochastic post structure”) on large areas, produced by an early and efficient nano-technique.24 These silver islands, probably prolate spheroids, were deposited at room temperature and yielded log GEM about 4.0, see Fig. 10 in Ref. 25 or Fig.10 in Ref. 26. The isolated prolate silver islands still show an extra chemical enhancement of about log Gchem = 0.5. This extra enhancement was assigned to\n\n30\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nadsorption at sites of atomic roughness, so-called SERS active sites.27 The remnants of the chemical effect at surface defects (SERS active sites) are observed in Fig. 1 (which is Fig. 11 in Ref. 23) as a “non-annealable” shoulder at 1002 cm-1 assigned to defects by Litorja et al. The number of surface defects has not been estimated in Ref. 23. If one assumes surface defect coverage of for instance 5%, the true enhancement of the 1002 cm-1 band with respect to the majority band at 992 cm-1 would be about a factor of 10. One should mention that the results of the absolute values of the enhancement are exact because the condensed film thickness is much smaller than the focalisation length of the sample illumination. The sticking coefficient at low temperatures is one, as investigated in Ref. 28. The stability of SERS active sites is very different on different Cu samples. On colddeposited Cu films they are annealed at about 250 K27 and on 80-nm Cu films on rough CaF2 films they are annealed between 300 K and 350 K.29 When Cu island films were prepared on 2-3-nm aluminum oxide films on top of bulk polished Cu supports the SERS active sites were still present after annealing up to 400 K.29 At higher temperatures the aluminum-oxide films broke down. In summary the results on AgFON surfaces in UHV23 are in line with our previous reports on the electronic effect at SERS active sites. These remarkable results of Van Duyne group just come from a surface, where the SERS signal is dominated by EM enhancement, because the concentration of SERS active sites is low. 2.2. AgFON electrodes Ref. 30 states: “Tremendous stability to extremely negative potential excursions is observed for MFON electrodes as compared to standard metal oxidation reduction cycle (MORC) roughened electrodes. Consequently, irreversible loss of SERS intensity at negative potentials is not observed on these MFON electrodes. We conclude that MFON electrodes present a significant advantage over MORC electrodes because SERS enhancement is not lost upon excursion to extremely negative potentials. This work demonstrates that the MFON substrate, while easily prepared and temporally stable, offers unprecedented stability and reproducibility for electrochemical SERS experiments. Furthermore, one can conclude that irreversible loss is not a distinguishing characteristic of electrochemical SERS and consequently cannot be used as evidence to support the chemical enhancement mechanism.” Nevertheless a chemical effect is observed in the spectra from AgFON sample, see Fig. 2 (which is Fig. 9 from Ref. 30).\n\nSERS of Carbon Dioxide on Cold-deposited Copper Films\n\n31\n\nFig. 2. Potential dependence of SER spectra of 50-mV pyridine in 0.1MKCl on AgFON. (A) -0.3 V, (B) –0.5 V, (C) –0.7 V, (D) -0.9 V, (E) –1.1 V, and (F) –1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Laser excitation was 4-mW 632.8 nm, scan rate 1 Angstrom/s, 1-s dwell time.\n\nAt first sight one may believe that the intensity of the breathing vibration of pyridine at about 1006 cm-1 does not depend on the potential of the AgFON electrode, but of course it does when one considers the scale bars. A “chemical effect” by dynamic charge transfer in the case of pyridine on copper electrodes was demonstrated in Ref. 31. It was also observed for pyridine at Cu single crystal electrodes with an attenuated total reflection (ATR) method. Smooth Cu single crystal electrodes were exposed to an “external EM enhancement,”32 given by the surface plasmon polariton resonance in so called Otto-attenuated total reflection (ATR) configuration.33 There is a strong and reversible dependence of the SERS signal on the electrode potential (see Fig. 3).\n\n32\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nFig. 3. Intensity potential profiles of the Raman intensities of Cu in 0.01-M pyridine +0.1M KClO4 for four different crystallographic orientations. Given are the peak intensities of the breathing vibration of pyridine (ν1 at ca 1010 cm-1). The lines are Gaussian fits as a guide to the eye. The arrows give direction of the scan. From Ref. 32.\n\nThe enhancement values for the Cu(100) crystalline samples with respect to a monolayer of pyridine on an ideal flat Cu sample with only the “external enhancement” by the ATR–coupling is about 3. Accordingly, the overall enhancement for the Cu(110) vicinal face at –1100 mV is of the order of 50. The change of pyridine coverage in the potential range displayed in Fig. 3 is small as inferred from electrochemical capacity measurements. Consequently one must assign the intensity variation as function of the potential in Fig. 3 to the electronic enhancement by transient charge transfer. There is no irreversible “cathodic quenching.” Maybe there are also constant EM enhancements, depending on the orientation of the samples. The Raman bands on the Cu single crystals were tentatively assigned to defects (SERS active sites).32 For CO2 however, the vibrational selectivity of SERS provides clear evidence for an electronic mechanism. Here we discuss previous SERS results34,35 in a new way using recent electron energy loss36,37 and infrared spectroscopic results. A short version of these results has appeared in Ref. 38.\n\nSERS of Carbon Dioxide on Cold-deposited Copper Films\n\n33\n\n3. SERS of CO2 at cold-deposited Cu films At first glance one would expect nothing exciting for the neutral linear molecule O-C-O. For gas phase CO2, infrared spectroscopy yields the double degenerate O-C-O bending mode at 667 cm-1 and the antisymmetric CO stretch vibration at 2349 cm-1 Raman spectroscopy yields only the Fermi resonance doublet39 composed by the symmetric C-O stretch vibration and the second harmonic O-C-O bending mode.40 The lower frequency component (in gas phase at 1286 cm-1) will be denoted FRI, the higher frequency component (in gas phase at 1388 cm-1) FRII, see Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4. Qualitative picture of the Fermi resonance in CO2, following the quantum mechanical wave functions in Ref. 40.\n\nThe linear neutral CO2 can be transformed under special circumstances into a metastable bent anionic form,41 see Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 5.

Only the IR active modes of CO2 are observed. The double degenerate bending mode is split and the antisymmetric CO-stretch mode has a non-symmetric line shape depending on exposure, probably caused by the disordered Cu surface. The broad structure near 2100 cm-1 is caused by CO contamination.\n\n768\n\n1368\n\n1182\n\n2323\n\n4.0L\n\nIRRAS T=44K\n\n2346\n\n665\n\n653\n\nCO2 650\n\nintensity [a.u.]\n\n1.2L\n\nSERS\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500 -1 wavenumber [cm ]\n\n2323\n\nT=40K 8.0L\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\nFig. 6.

All peak positions are given in Table 1.\n\nThe SERS results in Fig. 6 are explained on the basis of the results in Fig. 7.34 The Fermi dyad is seen in the Raman spectrum of condensed solid CO2 in Fig. 7a. It is conspicuous, that only the higher wave number component FRII contributes to the SERS spectra of CO2 on cold-deposited Cu (Figs. 6 and 7c,d). For CO2 on cold-deposited K, see Fig. 7b and Table 1, only the anionic species is observed, because the low work function of potassium favors the permanent electron transfer to CO2. The anionic species is also observed on cold-deposited Cu (Fig. 7c), but not when the Cu film was first annealed at 200 K before exposure at 40 K (Fig. 7d). For CO2 on cold-deposited Ag,35 one observes the bending mode and FRII, but no bands of the anionic CO2 species. The appearance of the bending mode of linear, neutral CO2 can be understood by using group theory and the model in,22 whereas all the other observations cannot be explained in this way (J R Lombardi, private communications).\n\n36\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nTable 1.

Now a consistent electronic enhancement mechanism is indicated by comparison with the inelastic cross sections of electron scattering by gaseous CO2 in the energy range of\n\nSERS of Carbon Dioxide on Cold-deposited Copper Films\n\n37\n\nFig. 9. Overview of the elastic (no loss) and vibrational inelastic electron scattering cross sections in gaseous CO2 at a scattering angle of 135°. (100) signifies the symmetric stretch, (010) the bending mode and (001) the antisymmetric stretch. The energy scale refers to the primary energy.\n\n0-5 eV, including the 2Πu shape resonance at 2 - 5 eV36,37 and the so-called virtual state 2Σ of anionic CO2- below 1 eV48 in Fig. 9 (from Ref. 37). The cross sections of the Fermi doublet components below 1 eV display at decreasing electron energy an increase for FRII and a negligible contribution of FRI. This experimental result has been corroborated by theory.49,48 The selection rules in the 2Πu shape resonance and the virtual state 2Σ forbid the excitation of the antisymmetric stretch mode. The relatively strong cross section of the antisymmetric stretch mode (see Fig. 9) at low electron energies is probably caused by a comparatively long-range electron interaction with the dynamic electric dipole of the antisymmetric stretch mode. This interaction is shielded at the surface. The SERS spectra can easily be explained with the electronic energy scheme in Fig. 10.\n\n38\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nFig. 10. Electron energy diagram above the Fermi level of Cu. The work function of Cu(111) is 5.0 eV, fixing the vacuum level, e.g. the level of zero kinetic electron energy in the CO2 gas phase. The anionic electronic levels of the adsorbed CO2 are relaxed by the attraction of the shielding hole at the metal surface. The most likely energy of the intermediate electron involved in temporary transfer to CO2 (indicated as “hot electron”) is the Fermi energy plus laser photon energy of 1.92 eV. All energies are up to scale.\n\nThe value of about 3.5 eV of the Coulomb relaxation in Fig. 10 has been inferred from two-photon-emission spectroscopy50 of CO on Cu(111) and the resonant low energy electron scattering in CO gas.51 Within the coherent Raman process the “hot electron” created by laser photon annihilation will temporarily occupy the virtual state 2Σ of the directly adsorbed CO2 species and excite the various vibrational bands according to the cross sections in Fig. 9 at energies below 0.5 eV. These are the bending mode and the higher frequency mode FRII. This explains the SERS spectrum of CO2 on Cu in Fig. 6, especially the observation of the bending mode which is not Raman active for free CO2 and of only the higher frequency band FRII of the Fermi dyad. Strong EM enhancement should show both FRI and FRII. But the near absence of the FRI component in SERS proves that the local EM field enhancement cannot deliver signals above the noise level. The exclusive contribution of EM enhancement may cause the weak appearance of the narrow line Fermi doublet in Fig. 8a at high exposure. But even this is not granted, as demonstrated by a special electronic effect for the modes of C2H4 adsorbed in first layer on Cu(111) facets.52 The SERS spectrum of CO2 on Cu films cold-condensed at 40 K (Figs. 6, 7c) contains a second couple of lines, which coincide with the positions of the CO2- bands observed on potassium, see Fig. 7b. These bands indicate the existence of the bent form\n\nSERS of Carbon Dioxide on Cold-deposited Copper Films\n\n39\n\nof anionic CO2–, now permanently charged with one electron, see Fig. 5. The bending and symmetric stretching mode of the anionic form are observed by the transient transfer of the extra electron from CO2- to the metal, because these two nuclear motions are involved in the configuration change towards the linear molecular form of neutral CO2. This direction of photo-induced charge transfer is similar to the mechanism found in SERS of CN– on silver electrodes.53,54 When a cold-deposited Cu film, cryocondensed at 40 K, annealed at 200 K, re-cooled to 40 K, is exposed to CO2, then the anionic CO2– is no more observed, only the bending modes and FRII of neutral CO2 persist, see Fig. 7d. Apparently, the adsorption sites on Cu where CO2 is activated to its anionic shape are annealed below 200 K. Apparently, these “chemically active sites” form a subgroup of the “SERS active sites.”38 The fact, that the infrared active bending and symmetric stretch modes of anionic CO2- is not observed in IRRAS (see Fig. 6) corroborates the assignment of the bonding of these species to a minority of surface sites. This resembles the case of NO exposure of colddeposited Cu:43 SERS provides high spectroscopic sensitivity and is focusing on the “chemical active sites” covered with N2; N2–δ, N2O, Oads., but shows no NO, whereas with IRRAS only adsorbed NO was observed. The model of transient charge transfer at sites of atomic scale roughness is supported by the observation of Raman active bands in IRRAS of ethene on cold-deposited copper films. Recently, it was demonstrated, that submonolayers of Cu on Cu(111) yielded the Raman bands of ethane, the IR bands did not appear at the low exposures employed.55,56 The advantage of IRRAS with respect to Raman spectroscopy is the relatively easy observation of molecular monolayers on smooth single crystalline surfaces without any enhancement. Further progress on understanding the atomic structure of SERS-active sites may be expected by a combination of IRRAS and scanning tunneling microscopy. 4. Conclusions Silver films over Nanospheres (AgFON), produced for instance in Van Duyne group are stable electromagnetic (EM) enhancers both in UHV and in electrolytes. Nevertheless they show some characteristics of the “chemical effect.” The structure of cold-deposited copper films is not well known, but these films display a wealth of effects, which are beyond an explanation by local metal optics (“EM enhancement”). Adsorption sites of atomic scale roughness with dynamic charge transfer between metal and an adsorbed molecule, so called “SERS active sites” on copper islands are stable up to at least 400 K. The comparison of infrared and Raman spectra of the same cold-deposited metaladsorbate system confirm the existence of SERS active sites. If infrared reflectionabsorption spectroscopy of smooth Cu single crystal surfaces with a cold-deposited submonolayer of Cu would be combined with scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the structure of SERS active sites might be unraveled. CO2 on Cu is a very good system to study the SERS mechanisms. All spectral SERS features of neutral CO2 on SERS active sites of cold-deposited Cu involve transient electron transfer from Cu to a temporary virtual 2Σ state of anionic CO2. This can be proven by a comparison of the SERS spectra with low electron energy loss spectra of gaseous CO2. The EM enhancement alone is not\n\n40\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nstrong enough to deliver a Raman band of the Fermi doublet component FRI from CO2 species not adsorbed at SERS active sites. On Cu films deposited at 40 K also a stable form of anionic CO2– is observed by SERS, involving transient electron transfer from anionic CO2– to Cu. The adsorption sites of the stable anionic CO2 are lost by annealing the film to 200 K, whereas SERS of neutral CO2 is still observed after re-cooling to 40 K. IRRAS observes only the infrared active modes of the majority species of neutral CO2 adsorbed on cold-deposited Cu, whereas SERS is focusing on a minority of surface sites on the atomically rough Cu surface.

The field of application covers basic studies on diagnostics development and on flame research as well as its use in technical combustion systems, e.g., for the determination of the gas-phase temperature in the vaporizing spray of a gasoline direct injection (GDI) injector or for the simultaneous measurement of gas temperature and exhaust-gas-recirculation rate (EGR rate) in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine. An overview is given on the fundamentals of the technique and on its most important technical applications.\n\n1. Introduction Laser diagnostics forms a powerful tool for the characterization of combustion processes. There are several different options to find access to the required measurement information, e.g., by using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for temperature and minor species concentration measurements1-5 οr by linear Raman scattering for the determination of temperature and major species concentrations6-10 to mention just a few of them. These techniques are mostly restricted to applications in a relatively clean combustion environment. For real technical combustion processes the signals are often disturbed or even covered by other sources of radiation, e.g., soot emissions or different kinds of background radiation. Here the application of nonlinear optical methods is advantageous as they provide signals with higher intensities which are emitted laser-like into one particular room direction.11 The most often used nonlinear spectroscopic technique is coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) where three laser beams are directed into the region of interest inside the combustion field by forming a particular angle configuration between the beams generating by their interaction a fourth beam,\n\n46\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nwhich is emitted into a fixed direction due to momentum conservation between the four beams involved.12 Depending on the molecular energy levels probed pure rotational CARS (RCARS) or rotational-vibrational CARS (VCARS) signals are generated when probing Raman transitions between rotational energy levels within one vibrational state or between rotational energy levels of different vibrational states, respectively. These signals contain the required measurement information.\n\nFig. 1. Single-pulse RCARS spectrum taken in a 10-ns laser pulse: (a) the non-resonant signal of the Ar reference and (b) the normalized RCARS spectrum of N2 in a flame (copyright permission obtained).13\n\nVCARS is a well established technique for temperature and concentration measurements14-24 and is advantageous to RCARS at higher temperatures.25,26 RCARS provides more accurate results at lower temperatures25-28 and was for the first time used for temperature measurements at room temperature in 1981 at Yale University29 and in flames some time later in the same laboratory (see Fig. 1 where a single-shot hightemperature RCARS spectrum is shown13). When used simultaneously with coherent Stokes Raman scattering (CSRS) which is possible for RCARS and RCSRS, the same measurement information is contained in both signals and can be extracted from both signals simultaneously (see Fig. 2).30 Since these days forming the starting point of RCARS investigations several different developments have been done improving the signal separation,31,32 the Raman linewidth information,33,34 the measurement accuracy35,36 and the stray light suppression.37-40 Due to these improvements measurements can nowadays also be executed in technical environments which have not been accessible before, e.g., in highly sooting flames,41-43 inside evaporating engine sprays38,44,45 and inside internal combustion engines.40,46,47 After a brief treatment of the theoretical background of CARS, with particular emphasis on polarization resolved RCARS,38,48 its application in these not so easily accessible combustion systems is described.\n\nCombustion Diagnostics by Pure Rotational CARS\n\n47\n\nFig. 2. Simultaneous detection of RCARS and RCSRS: (a) pure nitrogen and (b) air (copyright permission obtained).30\n\n2. The CARS process 2.1. Theoretical background The CARS signal is generated as the result of the interaction between generally three focused laser beams of frequency ω1, ω2 and ω3 and the molecules in the sample. In their common overlap region two monochromatic laser beams coherently excite a Raman transition ω1,2=ω1-ω2 and the ω3 beam is mixed in, resulting in an oscillating polarization of frequency ωCARS=ω1-ω2+ω3, the CARS signal. This process is shown in the energy level diagram displayed in Fig. 3.\n\npump laser\n\nStokes laser\n\nω1\n\nω2\n\nω 1,2\n\npump laser\n\nCARS signal\n\nω3\n\nω CARS\n\nRaman resonance\n\nFig. 3. Energy level diagram of the CARS process.\n\nIn order to gain quantitative information out of a CARS spectrum, it is in most cases necessary to calculate accurately the details of the spectrum. The theoretical basis is described in several review papers and books,49-56 therefore only a short description is given here. The interaction of an incident electromagnetic field with an ensemble of\n\n48\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nv molecules can be described by the induced polarization P , which is expressed by a v Taylor series in powers of the electric field E :\n\nv v vv vvv P = χ 1 E + χ 2 EE + χ 3 EEE + ...\n\n(1)\n\nThe susceptibility χ is a tensor quantity. The first term, the linear susceptibility χ1 describes two photon processes like Rayleigh scattering or spontaneous Raman scattering. For gases, which are isotropic, and thereby display inversion symmetry, the even-order polarization terms vanish in Eqn. (1). The first non-vanishing nonlinear term is the third-order susceptibility χ3, which is responsible for four-wave mixing (FWM) processes like CARS:\n\nv r Pµ3 (r , t ) = ε0\n\n∞ ∞ ∞\n\n∫ ∫ ∫χ\n\n3\n\nv r v r v r (−ωµ , ω1 , ω2 , ω3 ) ⋅ E (r , ω1 ) ⋅ E (r , ω2 ) ⋅ E (r ,ω3 ) ⋅\n\n−∞−∞−∞\n\n⋅ exp(−iωµt )dω1dω2 dω3\n\n(2)\n\nThe third-order susceptibility χ3 is a fourth-rank tensor which has 81 separate elements. For an isotropic medium 21 of these are non-zero, and for arbitrary frequencies of the incoming lasers three elements are independent. There are four types of non-zero tensor elements: 3 3 3 χ xxxx = χ yyyy = χ zzzz 3 3 3 3 3 χ yyzz = χ zzyy = χ zzxx = χ xxzz = χ xxyy 3 3 3 3 3 χ yzyz = χ zyzy = χ zxzx = χ xzxz = χ xyxy 3 3 3 3 3 = χ zyyz = χ zxxz = χ xzzx = χ xyyx χ yzzy\n\n  3 = χ yyxx  , 3 = χ yxyx   3 = χ yxxy \n\n(3)\n\nwhich are related by 3 3 3 3 χ xxxx = χ xxyy + χ xyxy + χ xyyx\n\n(4)\n\nBeside this the propagation of light through a medium is described by the wave equation:\n\nv r v r ω2 v r ∇ × ∇E(r , ω) − 2 E(r , ω) = µ0 ⋅ ω2 ⋅ P(r , ω) c\n\n(5)\n\nwhich can be derived from Maxwell´s equations, where c is the speed of light and µo the permeability in vacuum. Solving this equation by using Eqn. (2), the intensity of the\n\n49\n\nCombustion Diagnostics by Pure Rotational CARS\n\ngenerated CARS signal can be calculated. Assuming for simplicity a CARS process with the polarization of the laser beams being all parallel and the incident electromagnetic waves as plane waves, then the intensity of the CARS signal can be expressed by:\n\nn3 ⋅ c ⋅ ε0 2 ⋅ E(ωCARS ) 2 2 2 2 ωCARS 3 2  sin(∆k ⋅ L / 2)  = 2 ⋅ 3 ⋅ χ ⋅ I ⋅ I ⋅ I ⋅ L ⋅   xxxx 1 2 3 n1 ⋅ n2 ⋅ nCARS ⋅ c4  ∆k ⋅ L / 2 \n\nI (ωCARS ) =\n\n(6)\n\nFrom this equation it can be seen that the intensity is proportional to the intensities of the generating fields and to the square of the interaction length L. The CARS signal intensity also depends on the degree of phase mismatch:\n\nv v v v v ∆k =k1 − k 2 + k 3 − kCARS\n\n(7)\n\nThe wave vectors of the interacting four waves are denoted with ki . Perfect phase matching is achieved for ∆k = 0 . There are different perfect phase-matching schemes which can be used in a typical RCARS experiment: planar and folded BOXCARS. Both configurations are explained in Fig. 4.\n\nk1\n\nk3\n\nk2\n\nkCARS\n\nplanar BOXCARSgeometry\n\nk1\n\nk3\n\nk2\n\nkCARS\n\nfolded BOXCARSgeometry\n\nFig. 4. Phase-matching geometries used for RCARS.\n\nNeglecting one- and two-photon resonances and using the isolated line approximation the third-order non-linear susceptibility is given by the sum of a non-resonant (χ3NR) and a resonant part (χ3R): 3 3 χ xxxx = χ NR + χ R3\n\n3 3 = χ NR +∑ χ xxxx if\n\n∆ N if  d σ if c4 ⋅ ⋅  4 4 ⋅ h ⋅ ω 2 (ω if − ω 1 + ω 2 − i ⋅ Γif )  d Ω\n\n  ,\n\n(8)\n\n50\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nwhere Γif represents the collisional Raman linewidth and (dσif/dΩ) the differential Raman cross section. The temperature and concentration dependence is mainly contained in the population difference between two molecular states ∆Nif. In thermodynamic equilibrium the number of molecules in a particular vibrational and rotational level is given by the Boltzmann distribution. Typical RCARS spectra of air in dependence of temperature and pressure can be seen in Fig. 5.\n\nFig. 5. Pure rotational CARS spectra of air for different pressures and temperatures. The deviation between the best fit and experimental data is displayed as the curve located below each spectrum.28\n\n2.2. Rotational CARS There exist two variants of pure rotational CARS: conventional rotational CARS (CRCARS) and dual-broadband rotational CARS (DB-RCARS). The principal approaches for both cases are shown in Fig. 6. In both approaches the probed molecules are coherently excited by pairs of photons of frequency ω1 and ω2 with a frequency difference exactly equal to the rotational Raman frequency shift ω1,2 of the transition. A third photon of frequency ω3 is then scattered off the resonance to generate the CARS signal at the frequency ωCARS. In C-RCARS a narrowband laser, typically a frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (λ=532nm) is used for the transitions corresponding to the frequencies ω1 and ω3. The Stokes transitions (ω2) are driven by a broadband dye-laser operating with the dye Coumarin. In DB-RCARS two broadband dye lasers, e. g., being\n\nCombustion Diagnostics by Pure Rotational CARS\n\n51\n\noperated with the dyes DCM or Rhodamine, are used for the transitions corresponding to the frequencies ω1 and ω2, whereas a narrowband frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser is usually used for the transition corresponding to the frequency ω3. In both cases the rotational CARS signal contains all anti-Stokes frequencies since broadband dye lasers are used. This offers the possibility to achieve time resolution in the measurements being limited by the pulse width of the lasers which is typically a few ns.\n\nFig. 6. Energy level diagram of the conventional RCARS and the DB-RCARS process.\n\nIn DB-CARS spectra a spectral averaging effect occurs because each rotational Raman resonance is driven by multiple photon pairs. Therefore the influence of the statistical mode fluctuations on the shape of the DB-CARS spectrum is significantly reduced which leads to an improved precision25,27,57 in comparison to C-RCARS where only one photon pair drives each resonance. Beside this for DB-RCARS the dye can be arbitrarily chosen. Usually DCM is used which is a stable dye with a wavelength centered at 630 nm and spectrally well separated from the DB-RCARS signal. As a result a planar BOXCARS configuration can be used, because in this case the CARS signal can be separated from the dye laser by a spectral filter. This is not possible for C-RCARS since the wavelength of all three laser beams are located spectrally very close to the rotational CARS signal. Then a more complex folded BOXCARS geometry is necessary in order to avoid stray light in the detection system. 2.3. Polarization CARS The most efficient generation of the CARS signal is achieved with the polarization of the three laser beams being oriented parallel to each other. Nevertheless it can be necessary to use different polarizations for the laser beams. This can be motivated by a more efficient stray light reduction or a total suppression of the non-resonant background.38,48 As shown in Eqn. (1) and (6) the CARS intensity scales with the square of the third-order susceptibility. Owyoung has demonstrated that the elements of this tensor can be expressed in terms of two nuclear response functions and a non-resonant contribution σ.58 In the case of DB-RCARS applied to the gas phase in combustion processes the tensor elements can be reduced to:38,48\n\n52\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\n1 24 1 = 24 1 = 24 1 = 24\n\nχ 3xxyy =\n\n⋅ ( σ − 3 ⋅ a ( ω1 − ω 2 ) )\n\nχ 3xyxy\n\n( σ + 2 ⋅ a ( ω1 − ω 2 ) )\n\nχ 3xyyx 3 χ 1111\n\n( σ − 3 ⋅ a ( ω1 − ω 2 ) ) ( 3 ⋅ σ − 4 ⋅ a ( ω1 − ω 2 ) )\n\n(9)\n\nFor a single rotational Raman transition the response function a can be written in the form:\n\n 2  a( ωk − ω2 ) = K JJ ′ − ⋅ bJJ ′ ⋅ ( γ′) 2   45   1 (2 J + 1) K JJ ′ =  N J − ⋅ N J ′  ⋅ (ω AS − ωk + ω2 − iΓ) −1 h (2 J ′ + 1) \n\n(10)\n\nwhere, γ´ is the anisotropic part of the Raman polarizability, and bJJ´: the Plazek-Teller coefficient. Typical polarization arrangements keep the dye laser (ω1, ω2) polarization unchanged and only the Nd:YAG laser polarization (ω3, θ3) is changed. This leads to the fact, that the polarization of the resonant (θR) and the non-resonant part (θΝR) of the CARS signal can be determined only by the polarization of the Nd: YAG laser (θ3):\n\n1 tan θ 3 3 1 = − tan θ 3 2\n\ntan θ NR = tan θ R\n\n(11)\n\nThen, in order to suppress most of the elastically scattered stray light a polarization analyzer in the signal path has to be perpendicular to the Nd: YAG laser polarization. In this case minimal loss of the resonant CARS signal is obtained for the Nd: YAG laser polarization θ3 set to 45° with the analyzer set to -45°.38 A total suppression of the non-resonant part of the CARS signal can be achieved by a polarization analyzer perpendicular to χNR. Then maximum signal detection is achieved for the Nd:YAG laser polarization θ3 set to 60° with the analyzer set to -60°.48\n\nCombustion Diagnostics by Pure Rotational CARS\n\n53\n\n3. Measurements in sooting flames Fuel combustion, which is one of the major energy conversion processes, is connected with the production of pollutants such as soot and nitric oxides. Soot formation and oxidation, which are in the focus of the investigation reported here, are sensitive to the local combustion conditions, since the preparticle soot inception chemistry is relatively slow.59 The local temperature, residence time, and mixture fraction have been identified as important variables in soot production, in addition to the chemical structure of the fuel. Therefore quantitative information about the phenomenology of soot formation i.e. the dependence of soot formation on fuel, mixture composition, temperature, pressure, additives, or turbulence, requires experiments over a large range of the operation parameters under well defined conditions. Generally, for nitrogen vibrational CARS thermometry a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser emitting at 532 nm is used along with a broadband dye laser, resulting in a CARS signal wavelength of 473 nm. Unfortunately the emission of laser produced C2 radicals occurs in the same spectral region and disturbs the signal by interferences especially in fuel-rich, sooting flames,60 as can be seen in Fig. 7. These interferences can be a severe problem resulting in erroneous temperature evaluation. One possibility to solve this problem is to use a dual-pump vibrational CARS setup, but for strongly sooting flames, it is still difficult to find interference-free spectral regions.61-63 In such an environment it may be useful to apply the rotational CARS technique where the signal is generated around 532 nm to avoid spectral distortion from soot fragments.31,42\n\nFig. 7. Emission spectrum of C2 taken from a sooting flame. In addition the spectral regions of the different CARS approaches are marked.\n\nAs an example measurements taken in a non-premixed laminar bluff-body flame operated with methane at atmospheric pressure are shown. The burner consists of two coaxial tubes of 18 and 56 mm diameter and 820 mm length. The inner tube supplies the combustion gases and the outer tube is used to stabilize the flame. A photo of this flame is shown in Fig. 8a where also the frame is displayed for the presentation of the results in Fig. 9.\n\n54\n\nOptical Processes in Microparticles and Nanostructures\n\nFig. 8. Single-shot DB-RCARS spectrum taken from a non-premixed sooting methane diffusion flame with a bluff body.\n\nFor the dual-broadband RCARS setup a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser is used as pump source for a broadband dye laser and simultaneously as the narrow-band source for the CARS process by splitting of a fraction of 30 mJ. A solution of DCM in methanol was used in the dye laser. The dye laser beam was split into equal beams of 25 mJ each, with a bandwidth of about 200 cm-1, centered around 635 nm. The three beams were arranged in a planar BOXCARS configuration with a 300-mm focusing lens and a probe volume of diameter 0.1 mm and length 1.5 mm was achieved. The signal"
