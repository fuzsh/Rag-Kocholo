        "text": "PALM DESERT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--SocialEyes, a new company focused on socializing video, today announced its new social video service is now available in beta. SocialEyes introduces the concept of social video by providing a new multimedia video experience that instantly connects you to your friends and groups of people who share your interests. SocialEyes’ first public demonstration will take place during the DEMO Spring conference for emerging technology, and SocialEyes is available immediately in beta at www.socialeyes.com or apps.facebook.com/socialeyes.\n\nSocialEyes is a rich communications service based on actual personal profiles using Facebook Connect, allowing users to engage in multiple video conversations, chat via instant message and share information and links with multiple friends simultaneously. Users can also record, send or receive video messages, whether or not the other party is currently online or not, and a feed makes it easy to keep track of what’s happening on SocialEyes.\n\nSocialEyes Groups connects people based on specific topics. Users can join or start as many groups as they like so they can easily connect to like-minded individuals around common interests, hobbies, Facebook networks, families or anything else. It’s easy to join a group by searching for a topic or joining one of the recommended groups. With SocialEyes, you can create private groups for your personal networks or join a public group and meet new people. SocialEyes offers more ways to stay in touch with or meet like-minded people than ever before.\n\n“SocialEyes takes the social networking experience to the next level by enabling people to connect with their networks and meet interesting people who share common interests through face-to-face communication or via video messages,” said Rob Williams, co-founder and CEO, SocialEyes. “We feel that this product will strengthen the social connections between people and their interaction with their networks.”\n\n“SocialEyes is a category-defining product,” said Rob Glaser, co-founder and Chairman, SocialEyes. “It brings together four powerful elements for the first time – the Facebook Social Graph, no-download Flash Video, a group system that lets people easily connect with other people in meaningful ways, and a twitter-like feed – to create a brand new kind of social video experience.”\n\nSocialEyes was founded by Rob Williams and Rob Glaser, two Internet multimedia entrepreneurs and pioneers. Rob Williams started his career at Microsoft, then co-founded and served as CTO at Avogadro, and then served in executive positions at Openwave and RealNetworks. Rob Glaser also started his career at Microsoft, then in 1994 founded RealNetworks, was CEO there from February 1994 through January 2010, and currently serves as Chairman.\n\nBeginning today, people are welcome to join the free public beta by visiting www.socialeyes.com or apps.facebook.com/socialeyes. With SocialEyes, no download or setup is required, users just simply login with their Facebook account and are instantly in touch with friends and find conversations with people to join all over the world.\n\n“The Internet has brought us all closer, but SocialEyes takes social networking to a whole new level by connecting you face-to-face with people, not usernames,” said Matt Marshall, executive producer of DEMO. “It completely changes the way we communicate with and meet new people.\"\n\nSocialEyes has raised $5.1 million in capital – $600,000 from an angel round of investment and a Series A round of $4.5 million that was led by Ignition Partners and including participation by Maynard Webb. Ignition’s Brad Silverberg serves on SocialEyes’ board of directors along with Rob Williams and Rob Glaser.\n\nSocialEyes’ live stage presentation at DEMO Spring will be available at www.demo.com within 24 hours.\n\nAbout SocialEyes\n\nSocialEyes is a new social video service that instantly connects you to your friends and groups of people who share your interests. The multimedia experience allows you to engage in multiple video conversations, chat via instant message and share information and links with multiple people simultaneously.
