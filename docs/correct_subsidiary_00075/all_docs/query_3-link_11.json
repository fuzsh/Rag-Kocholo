        "text": "May 19, 2002\n\nECI in talks to merge Inovia with Nokia unit\n\nIsraeli telecommunications equipment provider ECI Telecom (Nasdaq:ECIL) is in talks to merge its subsidiary Inovia Telecoms with a division of Finnish giant Nokia (NYSE:NOK), TheMarker has learned. No comment could be obtained from ECI.\n\nThe deal, for cash and shares, will leave ECI and Nokia with 50:50 control over the merged unit.\n\nInovia, previously ECI's access division, specializes in DSL technology used by communications companies to supply broadband, video-on-demand, point-to-multipoint and other advanced services.\n\nGo to top\n\nAmdocs, Comverse in line to buy Logica messaging unit\n\nBritish-based multinational Logica (LSE:LOG) may sell its cellular messages transfer unit. Potential buyers lining up include Israeli companies Amdocs (NYSE:DOX) and Comverse Technology (Nasdaq:CMVT), according to the Bloomberg wire service.\n\nThe Bloomberg report is based on assessments by British analysts.\n\nLogica has been the worst-performing stock on London's FTSE index this year. It has lost 77% of its value in six months.\n\nGo to top\n\nMay 18, 2002\n\nVerint Systems announces IPO of 4.5m shares\n\nVerint Systems (NASDAQ:VRNT), a provider of analytic solutions for communications interception, digital video security and surveillance, and enterprise business intelligence, today announced its initial public offering of 4,500,000 shares of its common stock.\n\nThe company, a subsidiary of Comverse Technology (Nasdaq:CMVT), received an initial public offering price of $16 per share.\n\nGo to top\n\nBVR Systems reports razor-thin profit on steady revenues\n\nDefense training and simulation systems maker BVR Systems (Nasdaq:BVRS) reported revenues of $10.03 million for first quarter 2002 compared with revenues of $10.25 million for the first quarter of 2001.\n\nNet income for the quarter came to $8,000 or $0.00 per share compared with a net loss of $0.8 million or $0.08 per share for the same period in 2001.\n\nFirst quarter operating profit was $0.4 million, compared with an operating loss of $0.6 million for the same quarter last year. First quarter gross profit was $2.5 million compared with a gross profit of $1.3 million for the first quarter of the previous year.\n\nGo to top\n\nLevel 8 Systems announces 86% Q1 revenue drop from parallel\n\neBusiness integration software Level 8 Systems (Nasdaq:LVEL) announced an 86% decline in quarterly revenues from for first quarter of 2001, to $1.1 million. First quarter revenues represent a 35% decline from the previous quarter, the company said.\n\nThe decline in revenues from the parallel quarter reflects the impact of the sale of most of the Messaging and Application Engineering products in late 2001, the company explained.\n\nGo to top\n\nMay 17, 2002\n\nStock slides as SEC's probe of Lumenis becomes formal\n\nIsraeli laser medical device maker Lumenis (Nasdaq: LUME) said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's informal investigation of the company has been upgraded to a formal one.\n\nIts shares fell more than 22% to $3.55 in late afternoon trading on Nasdaq one day after disclosing in its quarterly report that it is handing over documents and information dating back to Jan. 1, 1998, concerning its relationship with distributors.\n\nThe SEC also has asked the company to explain previously disclosed charges and write-downs.\n\nGo to top\n\nMay 16, 2002\n\nTeva gets FDA OK for Torsemide\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries (Nasdaq, TASE:TEVA) received final FDA approval to market Torsemide tablets to treat hypertension and edema. It plans to kick off marketing next month. The tablets are the generic equivalent of Roche's (ROCZg.VX) Demadex, which had annual sales of $90 million in 2001.\n\nGo to top\n\nCapital gains lift Supersol Q1 profit 34% against parallel\n\nSuper-Sol (NYSE:SAE) reported a 34% leap in first-quarter net profit to about NIS 54 million, compared with NIS 41 million in the parallel quarter of 2001. The leap is partly due to an NIS 24 million capital gain from selling its holdings in Avnet, one of the partners in a Petah Tikva mall, among other properties.\n\nGo to top\n\nOrckit to trade in Tel Aviv from May 21\n\nOrckit Communications (Nasdaq:ORCT) will begin trading in Tel Aviv from May 21, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange said on Wednesday. Orckit is the fourth company since the start of the year to dual list on Tel Aviv and the 18th since Israel's parliament approved an easing of dual-listing requirements in late 2000.\n\nGo to top\n\nMay 15, 2002\n\nGoldman cuts Israel's Nice 2002 EPS\n\nGoldman Sachs lowered its 2002 earnings estimate for Nice Systems (Nasdaq:NICE) based on limited visibility on earnings for the rest of the year. In a report a day after Nice's Q1 results, analyst Elan Zivotofsky cut his 2002 EPS forecast to one cent from 15 cents and revenues to $155 million from $157 million. He also maintained his Market Perform rating.\n\nGo to top\n\nBlue Square Q1 net up 30%\n\nBlue Square Israel (NYSE:BSI) announced that revenues for the first quarter of 2002 increased by 1.6% to NIS 1,379.2 million (US $295.5 million) from NIS 1,357.7 million in the first quarter of 2001. The increase is due to the company's addition of selling space, the effect of which was weakened somewhat by Israel's difficult economic environment together with competition both from the company's own stores and those of its competitors.\n\nGo to top\n\nGilat sticks to tradition, misses Q1 revenue projections\n\nGilat Satellite Networks (Nasdaq:GILTF) reported Q1 revenues of $72 million, 28% lower than in the parallel quarter and 19% below Q4 2001. Nor did Gilat meet its own projections from the end of last quarter, when it forecast revenue of $80 million.\n\nGo to top\n\nMay 14, 2002\n\nLumenis posts Q1 loss, warns of weak 2002\n\nMedical-devices maker Lumenis (Nasdaq:LUME) reported a first-quarter loss of $643,000, or 2 cents per diluted share, and said it does not expect sales growth to resume until next year. In the parallel it netted $4.2 million, or 14 cents per diluted share. Lumenis said does not expect sales growth to resume until next year."
