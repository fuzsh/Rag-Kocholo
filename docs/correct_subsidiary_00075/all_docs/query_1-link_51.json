The book does not assume any prior knowledge of the subject except at the secondary school level. It does however, assume some familiarity with the mathematical techniques used, in particular vector analysis and differential equations. These and other mathematical techniques used are collectively introduced and discussed in ‘Mathematical Preliminaries’ at the beginning of the book. The book grew out of a need felt by us of a textbook which covers the entire range of topics in electromagnetism which are usually taught both in introductory and in more advanced courses at Indian universities. There are books available in the market which serve as excellent introductory textbooks. Some even have a comprehensive treatment for more advance level courses. Our aim is to span the entire range covered by such books and make the subject interesting, clear and instructive.\n\nSalient Features of the Book -\n\nCharges in motion have been discussed\n\n90 Solved examples within the chapters 120 Objective type questions 388 Exercise problems 314 Illustrations\n\nStructure of the Book The book consists of 12 chapters and one appendix. Each chapter begins with Learning Objectives – a set of concepts, which are elaborated in the respective chapter. The book begins with a preliminary chapter on mathematics which lays the foundation for the subsequent chapters in the book. Topics like vector analysis and vector calculus, differential equations, complex variables, matrices and special functions have been summarised in this chapter . Chapter 1 discrete and continuous charge distributions, Differential form of Coulomb’s law, Gauss’s law and Simple applications of Gauss’s law have been discussed. Chapter 2 intro\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nof examples. is explained in Chapter 3. Solution of Laplace and Poisson equations in the presence of dielectrics theories of dielectric phenomena have been eleborated in this chapter. Chapter 4 concept of capacitance of conductors, typical calculations of capacitances and laws for combination of capacitances have also been covered. Electric currents are introduced in Chapter 5 and the basic laws governing the currents are stated. and proved. Calculation of varying currents in RC circuit is discussed. Chapter 6 introduces the magnetic effects of currents and the basic laws in that context. Hall effect sources have been discussed. Magnetic vector potential has been introduced and laws restated in terms of the potentials. Chapter 7 theories of various forms of magnetism are discussed. Boundary value problems in the presence of ferromagnetic materials are discussed with some typical examples. Concept of magnetic circuits is introduced with some illustrative examples using the concept. Phenomena of electromagnetic induction and the laws thereof are discussed in Chapter 8. The concept\n\nChapter 9 is devoted to the analysis of circuits with time dependent currents. Alternating currents (AC) have been discussed in detail. Apart from the concepts of complex impedances and analysis of typical AC circuits, Phenomenon of resonance and quality factor in resonant circuits and performance of AC transformers have been discussed. Chapter 10 discusses the shortcoming of Ampere’s law, and Maxwell’s introduction of displacement current. The complete set of Maxwell’s equations both in free space and in the presence of matter are included. Wave solutions of Maxwell’s equations are worked out and their properties discussed. Chapter 11 discusses applications of Maxwell’s equations for calculations of electric and magnetic antenna are worked out as application of Maxwell’s equations. Chapter 12 is devoted to the special theory of relativity. The essentials of the theory—Lorentz transformations, relative nature of space and time are elaborated. Obvious consequence like length contraction, time dilation, relativistic energy and mass equivalence are presented. The transformation In addition, each chapter has several solved examples to illustrate the use of the concepts and relevant\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\ntechniques. Important key words have been highlighted in bold and the important equations have been in standard textbooks but are important for understanding. Such topics have been marked with the symbol ‘*’ in the headings. Advanced topics have also been included at the end of the chapter. These topics, though interesting and important, are not usually part of any regular curricula but will equip students with the desired edge and thereby generate interest. At the end of each chapter, we have collated what we consider the key points that need to be reiterated about the topic. To help students assimilate the material in the text, there are ten multiple choice or short answer conceptual questions at the end of each chapter. For students to learn the art of problem solving, many unsolved problems have been added at the end of each chapter.\n\nWeb Supplement Interesting web supplements are available at http://www.mhhe.com/mahajan/emet1\n\nAcknowledgements are too numerous to be acknowledged individually.

Examples of scalars are mass, temperature, electric charge, etc. A scalar ﬁeld is a physical quantity that varies from point to point and at each point, its value is speciﬁed by its magnitude at that point. An example of the scalar ﬁeld is the gravitational or electric potential. It varies from point to point in general and at every point, one only needs to know the magnitude of the potential to completely specify it.\n\n0.1.2 Vectors Vectors Vectors are physical quantities that are described by their magnitude and direction. They are usually represented with an arrow over them (a) or in bold face (a). In three dimensions, vectors can be represented by a sum of projections on any three mutually orthogonal vectors of unit magnitude. These mutually orthogonal vectors of unit magnitude are called basis vectors. The most common basis in ˆ jˆ Cartesian coordinates are unit vectors along the x, y and z directions and these are represented by i, and kˆ respectively. Thus, a typical vectorA can be represented by A\n\nAx iˆ\n\nAy jˆ\n\nAz kˆ\n\npoint out the main topics to be discussed in the chapter.\n\n(0.1)\n\nwhere Ax , Ay , Az are the x, y, z components of A and are really the projections of A on the three axis.

To learn about how forces due to several point charges add vectorially to give the net force and to use this fact for continuous charge distributions. To understand the concept of an electric ﬁeld and how it leads to a local description of the electrostatic phenomenon. To learn how to calculate electric ﬁeld due to various charge conﬁgurations. To understand the concept of electric lines of force and electric ﬂux. To learn about Gauss’s law and its use in determining the electric ﬁeld for situations with symmetry.\n\nLet us summarise what we have learnt about the boundary conditions in the presence of a conductor, whether charged or not: A conductor is throughout at the same potential including its surfaces which therefore are equipotential surfaces. The surfaces may carry surface charges. The electric ﬁeld at the surface is always normal to the surface at every point. In the presence of any hollow cavity in a conductor, there is no electric ﬁeld in the cavity if there are no free charges in the cavity and the surface of the cavity carries no surface charge. If a hollow cavity contains free charges, there is an electric ﬁeld in the cavity and there are surface charges in the cavity. The electric ﬁeld at the surface of the cavity is normal to the surface at every point on the surface and the conductor throughout is at the same potential.\n\nGuided Tour for Better Learning\n\nxvi\n\nExamples are interspersed throughout each chapter to clarify and illustrate the concepts and principles.\n\nEXAMPLE 1.2 AB is a line charge of length L which is uniformly charged and carries a total charge Q.

Although the novel was a satire on Victorian England, it was a pioneering effort in actually conceiving of worlds in dimensions different from the ordinary three dimensions of space that we are familiar with. In 1979, Canadian computer scientist A.K. Dewdney published a monograph called ‘Two dimensional Science & Technology’ in which he considered how the various laws of physics would be in a two dimensional universe. Let us try and see how electrostatics as we know, will look like, if the universe was ﬂat, i.e., instead of three dimensions, we only had 2. To understand how fundamentally different things are in this ﬁctional universe, we need to ﬁrst deﬁne certain mathematical objects, which, as we shall see, behave very differently to their three dimensional counterparts.\n\nAdvanced Topics cover concepts and principles which are not part of regular curricula but will equip students with the desired edge and thereby generate interest.\n\nSummary at the end sums up all the topics discussed in the respective chapter.\n\nA type of material called ‘conductors’ have a special property that they have electrons in it that are almost ‘free’ and respond to electric ﬁelds by moving. The movement of such electrons inside a conductor make it special. There is no electric ﬁeld inside it and the entire conductor is at the same potential when placed in an external steady electric ﬁeld. The movement of free electrons results in the steady state with free charges being present only at the surface of a conductor. If there is a cavity inside a conductor without any charge being placed there from outside, there is no electric ﬁeld there. The potential there is the same as the bulk conductor which encloses it. All free charges lie on the outer surface of such a conductor. When a single conductor is there carrying a charge, its potential is proportional to its charge. When several charge carrying conductors are present, their potentials are linearly related to the charges through the ‘coefﬁcients ’ of potential. Conversely, the coefﬁcients relating the charges to the potentials form a ‘capacitance matrix’.\n\nContents\n\nxviii\n\nConceptual Questions follow after the summary in every chapter to allow students to evaluate their level of understanding of concepts.\n\nThis is just a double Fourier series and therefore, �a � b 0\n\nV (x, y) sin\n\nmπ x nπy sin dxdy a b\n\nAm,n\n\nab sinh(km,n c) 4\n\n0\n\nand therefore, Am,n\n\n4 ab sinh(km,n c)\n\n�a � b 0\n\nV (x, y) sin\n\nmπ x nπy sin dxdy a b\n\n0\n\nThe Laplace equation, as we remarked in separable in eleven coordinate systems.

An α particle is shot through the exact centre of a hydrogen nucleus along a line perpendicular to the line, joining the two hydrogen nuclei (each with charge e) in the molecule as shown in the Fig. 1.23. The distance between the nuclei is b. Assume that the speed of the α particle is very high and so the nuclei do not move and also assume that the electric ﬁeld due to the electron cloud surrounding each of the hydrogen atoms in the molecule is negligible.

Then the third side is the vector that is the sum of the two vectors. The direction of the sum is in the opposite sense of the two vectors as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nr B\n\nr\n\nr\n\nA+B\n\nr A\n\nFig. 1\n\nVector addition\n\nz\n\nz\n\nr A\n\nAzk$\n\nk$ i$\n\nj$\n\ny\n\ny Ax j$\n\nx\n\nx (a)\n\nFig. 2\n\nAy j$ (b)\n\nˆ jˆ , kˆ in the Cartesian system of coordinates, (b) The components of a (a) Unit vectors i, ˆ ˆ vector A along i, j , kˆ\n\nA point P in Cartesian coordinates is represented by (x, y, z). We deﬁne a position vector as the directed distance from the origin O to P . Thus, rP = x iˆ + y jˆ + zkˆ (2) The displacement vector is the displacement from one point to another. Hence, rP Q = (xQ − xP )iˆ + (yQ − yP )jˆ + (zQ − zP )kˆ\n\n(3)\n\nThe unit vector along any vector is simply given by ˆ = A A |A|\n\n(4)\n\nchap0\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n10:47\n\n3\n\nMathematical Preliminaries\n\nwhere |A| =\n\nz\n\nA2x + A2y + A2z\n\nis the magnitude of the vector.\n\nP (x1, y1, z1)\n\nIn terms of the components, the sum or difference of two vectors is easily determined to be A = Ax iˆ + Ay jˆ + Az kˆ B = Bx iˆ + By jˆ + Bz kˆ A ± B = (Ax ± Bx )iˆ + (Ay ± By )jˆ + (Az ± Bz )kˆ\n\nr\n\nr\n\nz = z1 O\n\ny\n\nx = x1 A vector ﬁeld is a physical quantity which varies from point to point and at every point is completely speciﬁed y = y1 x by its magnitude and direction at that point. For example, Fig. 3 Position vector r the gravitational or electric ﬁeld is an example of a vector ﬁeld. To specify these ﬁelds, one not only needs to know the magnitude of the gravitational or electric ﬁeld at that point but also the direction.\n\n1c Dot Dotor orScalar ScalarProduct Product We can deﬁne two kinds of products of vectors. The dot or scalar product is deﬁned as A · B = B · A = |A||B| cos θ\n\n(5)\n\nwhere θ is the angle between A and B This allows us to immediately see that iˆ · iˆ = jˆ · jˆ = kˆ · kˆ = 1 ˆi · jˆ = iˆ · kˆ = jˆ · kˆ = 0 and hence, A · B = Ax Bx + Ay By + Az Bz\n\n(6)\n\nWe can also easily see that associativity and distributivity are valid. Thus, A · (B + C) = A · B + A · C\n\n(7)\n\n(k A) · B = k(A · B) = A · (k B)\n\n(8)\n\nand for a scalar k,\n\n1d Cross Crossor orVector VectorProduct Product For two vectors, A and B, we can also deﬁne a vector product as A × B = |A|B| sin θ eˆ\n\n(9)\n\nchap0\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n10:47\n\n4\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nwhere θ is the angle between A and B and eˆ is a unit vector in the direction perpendicular to both A and B in the direction that is given by the right-hand rule. One can then see, using this deﬁnition that iˆ × iˆ = jˆ × jˆ = kˆ × kˆ = 0 and ˆ iˆ × kˆ = −jˆ , jˆ × kˆ = +i iˆ × jˆ = k, With these, one can ﬁnd an expression for A × B as iˆ A×B =\n\nAx Bx\n\njˆ kˆ Ay Az By Bz\n\n(10)\n\nClearly A × B = −B × A For three vectors, one can deﬁne two kinds of products. One, A · (B × C) is called the triple scalar product. One can easily see that A · B × C = B · C × A = C · A × B = −A · C × B Also, writing the vectors in terms of their Cartesian components and using the deﬁnitions of dot and cross product given above, one can see that A·B ×C =\n\nAx Ay Az Bx By Bz Cx Cy Cz\n\n(11)\n\nIt can also be shown that the triple scalar product has a geometrical representation. It is simply the volume of the parallelepiped deﬁned by the vectors A, B, C. One can also see that A × (B × C) = B(A · C) − C(A · B)\n\n(12)\n\nan identity which is very useful.\n\n2 COORDINATE SYSTEMS 2a Cartesian CartesianCoordinates Coordinates We are familiar with the Cartesian coordinate system where a point is deﬁned by (x, y, z).

Thus, A = Ax iˆ + Ay jˆ + Az kˆ ˆ jˆ , kˆ are the unit vectors along x, y, z respectively. where i,\n\nchap0\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n10:47\n\nMathematical Preliminaries\n\n5\n\nThe range of coordinates is −∞ < x < ∞ −∞ < y < ∞ −∞ < z < ∞ The elements of length, area and volume are easily deﬁned in Cartesian coordinates as dl = dx iˆ + dy jˆ + dzkˆ dS = dydziˆ + dxdzjˆ + dxdy kˆ\n\ndV = dxdydz\n\n(13)\n\nThese are also displayed in Fig. 4.\n\nFig. 4 Differential element of length, area and volume in Cartesian coordinates\n\n2b Circular CircularCylindrical CylindricalCoordinates Coordinates The circular cylindrical coordinate system (ρ, φ, z) is very convenient when dealing with problems with cylindrical symmetry.

In more complicated circuits with capacitors, the loop analysis with currents is no longer applicable and hence we need to develop other methods as the example shows.\n\nEXAMPLE 5.9 In the circuit in Fig. 5.38, obtain the current in the capacitor branch when the switch S is switched on at time t = 0.\n\nSolution\n\nFig. 5.38\n\nExample 5.9\n\nThis is a two-loop network with a capacitor, as shown in Fig. 5.38. To solve it, consider removing the capacitor and working out the Thevenin equivalent of the remaining network indicated with a dashed line above. The Thevenin equivalent circuit, as shown in Fig. 5.39 below is The Thevenin voltage, which is the voltage across R2 is simply 2(0.5) VTh = = 0.18 V (2 + 3 + 0.5)\n\nchap5\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n252\n\n17:23\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nRTh\n\n+\n\nVTh\n\nFig. 5.39\n\nC\n\nExample 5.9: Thevenin equivalent circuit\n\nThe short-circuit current ISC , which is the value of I when the capacitor is replaced by a zero resistance conductor is ISC = 0.4 A Since the parallel combination of R2 and 0 will ensure that no current will pass through R2 , we get VTh RTh = = 0.45 ISC The Thevenin equivalent circuit is thus, the usual one loop circuit with a capacitor charging. The potential difference across the plates of the capacitor, (the potential difference being zero at t = 0) is Vd = VTh (1 − e\n\n−R\n\nt Th C\n\n)\n\nand the current is I = −C\n\nVTh − R t C dVd − t =− e Th = 0.4e RTh C dt RTh\n\nThe example above could be dealt with using Thevenin’s theorem since there was only one capacitor in the circuit. For cases involving capacitors in more than one branch of the circuit this method will not work, nor will the general network analysis using Kirchhoff’s laws. The mathematical methods needed to solve such circuits with DC sources are more complicated and beyond the scope of this book.\n\nPROBLEM 5.16 Consider the circuit in Fig. 5.40.

Find the charge on the capacitor as a function of time, assuming we have reset the clock to t = 0 at the time when we have removed the batteries. Compute also the energy dissipated in the resistors.\n\n5.10 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY * Earth’s atmosphere is one enormous laboratory of electrical phenomena, both static electrical phenomena as well as electrical currents. Since there are enormous variations in density, electrical conductivity and other parameters as we go up in the atmosphere starting from the surface of the earth, atmosphere has been divided into various layers. Characteristic phenomena happen in the various layers depending upon their electrical properties. The boundaries of these layers are not very sharp and are shown in Fig. 5.41 Exosphere\n\nGoes up till about 10000 km\n\n~ 500 to 1000 km Thermosphere\n\n~ 85 km Mesosphere\n\n~ 45 km\n\nStratosphere\n\n~ 12 km\n\nTroposphere Surface of the earth\n\nFig. 5.41\n\nVarious layers of the earth's atmosphere with approximate and average heights of the various layers. The ionised part of the atmosphere, called the ionosphere, starts from the bottom of the thermosphere and goes on in its upper layer well into the exosphere\n\nThe most visible atmospheric electrical phenomena occur in the troposphere where most of the atmospheric air is present. Lightning is the most spectacular phenomenon that occurs in this layer. The molecules of the air get electrically charged by a variety of processes like friction between masses of air, radiation from outside the atmosphere and other processes. The charge in the air can be of either sign but is mostly positive with the molecules losing electrons. These charges in the atmosphere induce opposite charges in the earth so that between them and the surface of the earth there is always an electric\n\nchap5\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n254\n\n17:23\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld is enormous, something like 100 V/m. Air being non-conducting, in normal circumstances, this ﬁeld causes no currents. However, there are occasions when the water vapour in the atmosphere condenses into water droplets. These water droplets, much denser than air, get charged as they moves through the atmosphere. Coalescing of two or more droplets results in bigger droplets. Sometimes thus, we get a condensed accumulation of electric charges in these drops and that creates very high electric ﬁeld between the water drops and the earth’s surface. Every material has a limit such that when an applied electric ﬁeld in that medium exceeds the limit, there is electrical breakdown of the medium and current ﬂows through it. ‘Lightning’ is one such phenomenon when there is an electrical breakdown of the atmosphere resulting in huge currents ﬂowing between the atmosphere and the earth for a short time till the charges gets neutralised. The potential difference when lightning occurs can be very high like 108 volts and the total current runs into thousand of amperes. It is also true that the ﬂow of current between the atmosphere is not restricted to lightning events but occurs under fair weather conditions too. The average fair weather current has been estimated at about 103 Amperes. This arises mostly as an average combined effect of thousands of small lightning ﬂashes that occurs which mostly are not spectacular and go unnoticed. The layer above the troposphere is the stratosphere which is home to the so-called ozone-layer. The stratosphere does not have any direct electrical phenomenon associated with it. But this layer is primarily responsible for absorbing the harmful ultraviolet components of solar radiation thus making life on the surface of the earth possible. Presence of the ozone layer is a delicate balance between its formation from oxygen and breakup. Man-made emissions of ﬂuorocarbon compounds disturb this delicate balance. Indications are that the ozone layer is already depleting which will lead to catastrophic consequences if allowed to go unchecked. The next higher layer, the mesosphere has too thin a density of air to absorb the sun’s radiation or show any signiﬁcant electrical activity. The air there however, is able to offer substantial viscous resistance to incoming meteorites which sometimes burn up there, leaving tell-tale trails visible from the surface of the earth. The next layer, the thermosphere contains the ionosphere, where free charged particles exist and thus, considerable electrical activity takes place. The ionisation of neutral atoms and molecules in the ionosphere is caused by very energetic ultraviolet rays which are a part of the solar radiation. The phenomenon of ‘aurora’ in the polar regions of the earth is a phenomenon of electrical discharge from the ionosphere. But the most signiﬁcant phenomenon in the ionosphere occurs in relation to propagation of electromagnetic waves through it. Because of the sizable concentration of charged particles, it becomes transparent to high frequency electromagnetic waves. Radio waves are reﬂected by it but shorter waves used extensively in modern times for telecommunications pass though it.\n\n• Electric charges in motion constitute an electric current. Electric current is described by a current density j (r).\n\nchap5\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n17:23\n\nElectric Currents\n\n255\n\n• For steady currents, conservation of charge implies that the divergence of the current density vanishes. • To maintain an electric current in a conductor, a potential difference needs to be maintained across the ends of the conductor. This is usually supplied by a battery or a source which normally converts chemical energy to electrical energy. • The current density in a conductor and the electric ﬁeld are related by Ohm’s Law. The proportionality constant is called the conductivity of the material. • Circuits or combinations of resistors and batteries can be analysed using Kirchhoff’s Laws, which are basically statements of Conservation of Charge and Conservation of Energy as applied to the circuits. • For complicated circuits or networks, Thevenin and Norton’s theorems can be used. • Circuits with capacitors have a time-dependent current. The time constant is related to the product of resistance and capacitance.\n\n1. An ideal battery is hooked to a light bulb with wires.

To be able to understand the concept of magnetic vector potential and its relationship to the magnetic ﬁeld.\n\n6.1 MAGNETIC FORCE ON A CURRENT CARRYING CONDUCTOR The history of magnetism is fairly old—naturally occurring substances called lodestones (which today we refer to as permanent magnets) were the ﬁrst materials in which magnetic forces were observed. Till the early nineteenth century, the study of magnetism was separate from the study of electrical phenomenon and it was only in 1820 that H. Oersted and Ampere discovered the connection between these two phenomena. They discovered that magnetic forces are exerted over electric currents and also between two current carrying conductors. The work of these scientists as also of many others after them, led to a uniﬁed study of electromagnetism in which the electrical and magnetic phenomena are united. Current carrying conductors experience a force when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. Consider a conductor carrying a steady current I along its length in a magnetic ﬁeld B. Then the force on an element dl of the conductor due to the magnetic ﬁeld is given by dF = I (dl × B)\n\n(6.1)\n\nThe force law is illustrated using the right-hand rule in Fig. 6.1. In SI units, since the units of force, current and length are deﬁned, this equation also deﬁnes the SI unit of magnetic ﬁeld B which is called a Tesla, after the Serbian-American inventor Nikolai Tesla (1856–1943).\n\n261\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n262\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nThis empirical result for the force on a current carrying element in a magnetic ﬁeld also allows us to determine the force experienced by a charge in a magnetic ﬁeld. Recall that current is nothing but a ﬂow of charge. Let λ be the charge density in the conductor which is carrying a current I . Then an element dl of the conductor carries a charge of dq = λdl The velocity, v of the charge is related to the current by Fig. 6.1 Right-hand rule for magnetic force on a current. The three fingers are at right angles to each other\n\nvdq = I dl Using Eq. (6.1), we get the force on the moving charge to be dF = dq(v × B)\n\n(6.2)\n\nThus, on any charge Q, in an electric and magnetic ﬁeld, the total force will be the vector sum of the electric force (given by Coulomb’s Law) and the magnetic force as in Eq. (6.2) F = Q E + (v × B)\n\n(6.3)\n\nThis force is called the Lorentz force on the charge Q. It is interesting that the two kinds of forces have very different properties. Consider the displacement dr of the charge in an electric and magnetic ﬁeld. The work done, by deﬁnition will be dW = −F · dr = −Q(E · dr) − Q\n\ndr × B · dr dt\n\n= Qdφ\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere dφ is the electric potential difference across the displacement d r and the second term vanishes because of the properties of the vector triple product. This is a very interesting result. Motion of a charge in an electric ﬁeld entails doing some work which, as we have seen before, is related to the difference in the electric potential of the electric ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld on the other hand, does not do any work on a charged particle in motion since the force exerted by the magnetic ﬁeld is always perpendicular to the displacement. From Chapter 2, we also know that the conservative nature of the electric ﬁeld or the fact that the work done is independent of the path taken, allows us to deﬁne a scalar potential which is related to the electric ﬁeld by the gradient operator. For a magnetic ﬁeld, this is not the case. We cannot deﬁne a scalar potential in the usual way. Later in this chapter, we will introduce a different kind of potential called the vector potential related to the magnetic ﬁeld.\n\n6.2 MOTION OF CHARGED PARTICLES IN ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS The motion of a charged particle in electric and magnetic ﬁelds depends on the magnitude and orientation of the two ﬁelds. For a general conﬁguration, this motion would be fairly complicated.

Then the equation of motion of a charge Q can be written as d 2r m 2 = F = QE dt For the special case of the electric ﬁeld in the z-direction, we have thus d 2y d 2x m 2 =m 2 =0 dt dt d 2z m 2 = QE (6.5) dt These equations are second order, ordinary differential equations and thus can be solved if we know the initial position and velocity. Let the initial conditions on the position and velocity be r(0) = (x(0), y(0), z(0)) v(0) = (vx (0), vy (0), vz (0)) Then the solution to Eq. (6.5) is x(t) = x(0) + vx (0)t y(t) = y(0) + vy (0)t QE 2 t (6.6) 2m This is the general solution to the equations of motion for this conﬁguration of the electric ﬁeld. Let us take a speciﬁc initial condition of the particle being at the origin at t = 0, i.e., r(0) = 0. We also take the initial velocity to be in the x − z plane, i.e., vy (0) = 0. With these initial conditions, we see that z(t) = z(0) + vz (0)t +\n\nx(t) = vx (0)t y(t) = 0 QE 2 t 2m This is a trajectory of a parabola (Fig. 6.2(a)) as expected. The particle’s motion in the direction with no force (x-direction) is without any acceleration. In the z-direction, the electric force causes the acceleration. The motion is like a particle projected with a velocity in a uniform gravitational ﬁeld. The motion of the particle continues to be conﬁned to the x − z plane. z(t) = vz (0)t +\n\nWe next consider the case of a charged particle in a constant magnetic ﬁeld.\n\n6.2.2 Motion MotionininaaConstant ConstantMagnetic MagneticField Field A constant magnetic ﬁeld will exert a force on a charged particle given by Eq.

To solve the x and y equations of motion, we deﬁne a new variable x+ ≡ x(t) + iy(t) In terms of x+ , the equations become d 2 x+ QB dx+ = −i dt 2 m dt If we deﬁne ω≡\n\nQB m\n\n(6.11)\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n265\n\nthen the equation reads d 2 x+ dx+ = −iω dt 2 dt\n\n(6.12)\n\nThe quantity ω = QB has dimensions of frequency and is called the Larmor frequency. We will see m later that this combination of charge, mass and magnetic ﬁeld arises in many situations. Equation (6.12) is easily solved and we get dx+ = Ce−iωt dt where C is a constant which can be complex. Writing\n\n(6.13)\n\nC = |C|eiδ we get dx+ = |C|e−iωt+iδ dt\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhich has a solution x+ (t) =\n\n|C|e−iωt+iδ +D −iω\n\n(6.15)\n\nwhere D is an integration constant. In general, once again, the integration constant D can be complex. We write D = Dr + iDi Substituting this in Eq. (6.15) and taking the real and imaginary parts of this equation, we get |C| x(t) = − sin(−ωt + δ) + Di (6.16) ω and |C| y(t) = cos(−ωt + δ) + Dr (6.17) ω There are, as expected four integration constants since each of the two equations for x and y are second order differential equations. We have chosen these constants to be |C|, δ, Dr and Di , which are of course related to the initial values of position and velocity in the x and y directions. To determine the integration constants, we need to impose initial conditions. We take the the particle to be at the origin at t = 0 i.e. x(0) = y(0) = z(0) = 0. Then |C| x(t) = − (6.18) [sin(−ωt + δ) − sin δ] ω and |C| y(t) = + (6.19) [cos(−ωt + δ) − cos δ] ω From Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19), we can see that dx(t) = |C| cos(−ωt + δ) (6.20) dt\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 7, 2012\n\n266 and\n\n11:46\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\ndy(t) = |C| sin(−ωt + δ) dt\n\n(6.21)\n\nThese equations can be inverted and we can get the integration constant |C| and δ in terms of the initial . . velocity components x (0), y (0). 1 . . |C| = x (0)2 + y (0)2 2 ≡ v⊥ (0) (6.22) and\n\n. y (0) tan δ = . x (0)\n\n(6.23)\n\nwhere we have deﬁned a velocity v⊥ as the velocity in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. In our case, the magnetic ﬁeld is in the z direction, so v⊥ is in the x − y plane or 1 . . v⊥ (0) = x (0)2 + y (0)2 2 . . This solves the problem completely. Now knowing the initial velocities, x (0), y (0), we can obtain the values of the position r(t) of the particle at any time. The solution, Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19) have some interesting properties. Note that the time average values of x(t) and y(t) from Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19) are |C| x= sin δ (6.24) ω and |C| y=+ cos δ (6.25) ω It is clear from Eqs. (6.18) and (6.19) that x(t) and y(t) oscillate around x and y such that |C|2 (x(t) − x)2 + (y(t) − y)2 = 2 ω mv⊥ (0) 2 = (6.26) |Q|B In the x − y plane then, the particle moves in a circular orbit. However, there is an initial velocity in the z direction and that velocity remains unchanged causing a uniform motion in the z direction. Thus, . the trajectory of the particle, is in the form of a helix. The axis is the line z = z(0)t, x = x, y = y with the helical spiral around this line having a radius of a=\n\nmv⊥ (0) |Q|B\n\n(6.27)\n\nThis radius is called the Larmor radius. Figure 6.2(b) is the sketch of this helix for δ = 0. Note that for very high values of B, the Larmor radius shrinks to zero. The charged particle almost follows the magnetic ﬁeld lines, which in our case is along the z-direction. If the initial velocity of the charged . particle is orthogonal to the magnetic ﬁeld, i.e., in this case z(0) = 0, then the helix collapses to a circle in the x − y plane. The particle then goes around in a closed, circular trajectory in the x − y plane. We consider two examples of motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic ﬁelds.\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n267\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\nEXAMPLE 6.1 An proton with speed v = 3.0 × 106 ms−1 enters the gap between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor, midway between the plates with its velocity parallel to the plates. The plates have a separation d = 1 cm, the potential difference between the plates is V+ − V− = 100 V and the length of the plates AB = CD = 30 cm. A ﬂuorescent screen is placed at a distance D0 from the further end of the plates. Determine the distance below the midpoint of the screen where the proton strikes the screen. Assume that the ﬁeld is restricted to inside the capacitor and is normal to the plates.

Hence, the velocity in the direction of the initial velocity remains unchanged. This implies that the proton takes a time AB 0.3 t1 = = secs = 10−7 secs v 3 × 106 to traverse the capacitor. The electric ﬁeld between the plates is 100 V = = 104 V/m d 0.01 In the direction of the electric ﬁeld, the proton experiences an acceleration of 1.6 × 10−19 × 104 eE = = 1012 ms−2 a= m 1.6 × 10−27 E=\n\nThe initial velocity in the direction of the electric ﬁeld is zero and hence, after a time t1 , the displacement due to this acceleration will be 1 eE 2 d1 = t = 0.5 cm 2 m 1 and the transverse velocity in this direction will be eE v1 = t1 = 105 ms−1 m\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n268\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nAt time t1 , the proton is at the position F as shown. After this point, there is no electric ﬁeld and hence there is no transverse acceleration on the proton. The longitudinal (in the direction of the initial velocity) velocity continues to be v. Hence, the time taken for the proton to reach the screen would be D0 t2 = = 10−7 sec v Thus, the additional displacement caused in the transverse direction is simply eE d2 = v1 t2 = t1 t2 = 1.0 cm m Thus, the total displacement of the proton from its initial path in the transverse direction when it hits the screen is d1 + d2 = 1.5 cm\n\nEXAMPLE 6.2 ABCDEFGH is a cube of side L and KL is a slit of width d in the face EFGH such that EK = KF = GL = LH = L2 − d2 .

Determine what fraction of incident particles pass through the slit. Given that L = 10 cm, B = 10−1 T, d = 2 cm, m = 1.6 × 10−19 kg, v = 3 × 106 ms−1 and q = 1.6 × 10−11 C.\n\nr B\n\nB\n\nD\n\nA F K C\n\nG\n\nE\n\nr B\n\nL H\n\nFig. 6.4 Example 6.2\n\nSolution Let E be the origin with EH, EF and EA as the x, y and z axes respectively. Consider a particle at a height z0 above the bottom face, that is the face with the slit. The magnetic ﬁeld in the y direction will make the particle bend into an arc of radius mv R= = 0.3 m qB in the y − z plane. The particles at the point of entry into the face ABCD have coordinates (x0 , 0, z0 ) and their velocities are in the y-direction. Due to the Lorentz force, Eq. (6.3), the x-coordinate will\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n269\n\nremain unchanged but the particles will bend downwards. The centre of the arc will be at a distance R below z0 . The trajectory for this particle therefore, is given by y 2 + (z − z0 + R)2 = R 2 When it hits the bottom face at z = 0, the y coordinate is given by y02 = R 2 − (R − z0 )2 = 2Rz0 − z02 The only particle which will pass through the slit will be whose y-coordinate satisﬁes L−d L+d ≤ y0 ≤ 2 2 Thus, the values of z0 for which the particles will pass through the slit will be z0L ≤ z0 ≤ z0R where 2 2z0L R − z0L =\n\n(L − d)2 4\n\n2 = 2z0R R − z0R\n\n(L + d)2 4\n\nand\n\nPutting in the numbers and solving, we get z0L = 0.27 cm and z0R = 0.61 cm Only particles in the strip 0.61 − 0.27 = 0.34 cm on the face ACHE will pass through the slit. This represents a fraction 0.34 = 0.034 10 or 3.4% of the particles incident on the face.\n\nPROBLEM 6.1 A deuteron is travelling in a straight line along the x-direction with a speed 2 × 107 m/sec.

The trajectories, a parabola in the electric ﬁeld case and a helical path in the magnetic ﬁeld case arise from the different nature of the two forces. The next obvious question we need to address is the behaviour of the particle in the presence of both, magnetic and electric ﬁelds. We already know, that in the presence of both electric and magnetic ﬁelds, the motion of the charged particle is governed by the Lorentz Force Equation (Eq. 6.3). Using this force equation in the equations of motion, we can in principle, solve to get the trajectory of the particle. However, for ﬁelds with arbitrary magnitudes and orientations, the equations cannot be solved. For certain special cases, the force equation can be solved and some interesting trajectories obtained. Let us ﬁrst consider the case with uniform E and B ﬁelds present in the region y > 0. Further, let the ﬁelds be orthogonal to each other, that is, crossed. Let the electric ﬁeld be along the z-axis, i.e., E = E zˆ ˆ A charged particle of charge +q and mass m, is and the magnetic ﬁeld along the x-axis, i.e., B = B x. initially at the origin r(0) = 0 with a velocity v = v0 yˆ in the y direction. Assume EB > v0 so that the particle starts going up at t = 0. The analysis for the case EB < v0 is similar. The equation of motion for the particle is given by F = q(v × B + E) which when resolved into components with the given ﬁelds, gives us d 2z dy m 2 = qE − qB dt dt m\n\n(6.28)\n\nd 2y dz = qB dt 2 dt\n\n(6.29)\n\nd 2x =0 dt 2\n\n(6.30)\n\nm\n\nNotice that at t = 0, the particle is at the origin and the velocity in the x-direction is zero. Thus, Eq. (6.30) shows that x(t) = 0 for all t. The motion thus is restricted to the y − z plane. Deﬁning E y =y− t (6.31) B we can combine Eqs. (6.28) and (6.29) to get d 2 (z + iy ) iqB d(z + iy ) = (6.32) dt 2 m dt\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n271\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\nThis equation can be solved immediately to get iqBt d(z + iy ) = A1 e m (6.33) dt where A1 is an integration constant. To determine the integration constant, we use the initial conditions given. At t = 0, dy d(z + iy ) =i =i dt dt\n\ndy E − dt B\n\n= i v0 −\n\nE B\n\nand thus, A1 = −i\n\nE − v0 B\n\nNow integrating Eq. (6.33), we get iA1 i qBt e m + A2 (6.34) qB/m where A2 is the second integration constant. Since at t = 0, the particle is at the origin, we get iA1 A2 = qB/m z + iy = −\n\nand thus, z + iy =\n\niqBt iA1 1 − e− m qB/m\n\n(6.35)\n\nSeparating real and imaginary parts and writing qB =ω m the Larmor frequency, we get z=\n\nE B\n\n− v0 (1 − cos ωt) ω\n\n(6.36)\n\nand y=\n\nE t− B\n\nE − v0 B\n\nsin ωt ω\n\n(6.37)\n\nThe velocity along the y-direction is thus, E E . (6.38) y= − − v0 cos ωt B B If one takes the average of this, we get u = EB . This is called the drift velocity. Thus, while y increases 2 E −v linearly as u, z oscillates between 0 and ( B 0 ) . This kind of trajectory is shown in Fig. 6.5. Taking ω\n\nR=\n\nE/B − v0 ω\n\nEquations (6.36) and (6.37) can be written as (z − R)2 + y −\n\nE t B\n\n2\n\n= R2\n\n(6.39)\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n272\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nThis is an equation of a circle but one with its centre which changes with time. The coordinates of the centre are E 0, t, R B Thus, in a crossed electric and magnetic ﬁeld, the particle traces a path which is called a cycloid. z\n\nr E\n\ny\n\nr B x\n\nFig. 6.5\n\nTrajectory of a charged particle when the electric and magnetic fields are orthogonal to each other. The particle is initially at the origin. The trajectory shown is for EB > v0 . For E < v0 the trajectory will go down at the origin and curve upwards B\n\nLet us now see what the trajectories are for some special values of the parameters. Note that for v0 = EB , Eqs. (6.36) and (6.37) give us z(t) = 0 while y increases linearly with time with its initial speed v0 . This fact is used in a device called the velocity selector. Consider a beam of particles with a distribution of velocities in the y-direction, entering a region of crossed E and B ﬁelds at y = 0. Particles with EB > v0 will trace out a cycloid path with positive z and those with EB < v0 a path with negative z. Particles with EB = v0 will not be affected at all. Hence, if a barrier parallel to the x − z plane is introduced at some value of y, with a small aperture at x = z = 0 then only those particle with EB = v will pass through the aperture. This device can thus select particles with a particular velocity out of a beam of particles with a distribution of velocities. Our analysis above has one limitation—the trajectory of the particle is a cycloid, no matter what the value of EB is. In particular, if EB > c, the velocity of light, our analysis implies that the average speed of the particle is more than c. This is in violation of the principle of special relativity. Clearly, the non-relativistic equations of motion used by us are not valid when one is dealing with velocities close to the speed of light. A more detailed analysis shows that the results above are valid only when EB is much less than the speed of light.\n\n6.2.4 The TheCyclotron Cyclotron The interaction of charged particles with electric and magnetic ﬁelds and their motion in them is used in several devices. In particular, particle accelerators are based on this interaction. The ﬁrst such accelerator was the cyclotron which was built by E.O.Lawrence and M.S. Livingstone in the early 1930s. It has been\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n273\n\nextensively used to study elementary particles and their properties and interactions. Though particle accelerators have advanced technologically signiﬁcantly since the time the cyclotron was invented, it is instructive to study the cyclotron since its principles are used even in more advanced accelerators. The basic principle of the cyclotron is that a charged particle is accelerated in an electric ﬁeld. This by itself was known and had been used for a long time, in, for instance, X-ray tubes, etc. The ingenuity in the cyclotron design was to use the interaction of the charged particle with a magnetic ﬁeld. Recall that the magnetic ﬁeld does not increase the kinetic energy of the particle but only changes the direction of motion. Using a combination of electric ﬁelds (to accelerate the charged particles) and magnetic ﬁelds in a ingenious way, Lawrence was able to build a compact accelerator which could accelerate particles to high energies. Let us see how this was done.\n\nFig. 6.6\n\nThe Cyclotron: The magnetic field in the cavities is vertical and a varying electric field is applied in the gaps. The electric field is suitably timed so as to accelerate the charged particles when they enter the gap\n\nThe device consists of two D-shaped cavities placed horizontally with their straight edges separated by a gap. A vertical, steady magnetic ﬁeld is applied such that the D-shaped cavities have a uniform magnetic ﬁeld in them which is at right angles to their plane surfaces. Charged particles are injected at the centre of the gap between the D shaped cavities. The initial velocity, v0 of the charged particles is in the horizontal direction, i.e., in the plane of the D-shaped cavities. The perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld exerts a force which is also in the horizontal direction, but orthogonal to the direction of the initial velocity. F = qvB\n\n(6.40)\n\nThe charged particles, under the inﬂuence of this magnetic force start moving in a circular trajectory with radius R such that the magnetic force provides the centripetal force for the circular motion. mv 2 qvB = R mv R= (6.41) qB where m is the mass of the particle. The time taken, T 1 by the particle to complete one semicircle in 2 one of the D shaped cavities is thus, πR πm T1 = = (6.42) 2 v qB\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n274\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nNote that this is independent of v and R. As the particle enters the gap between the D-shaped cavities, it is accelerated by an electric ﬁeld of the appropriate sign as shown in the Fig. 6.6. The particle is accelerated while it is traveling in the gap (the only region where there is an electric ﬁeld) and renters the other D-shaped cavity but this time with a higher energy and velocity than with which it had emerged from the other D-shaped cavity. It reaches the other end of the cavity, traveling in a semi circular path because of the action of the magnetic ﬁeld, exactly after a time T 1 though it has a 2 higher energy and velocity! The particle is travelling in a direction opposite to its initial velocity when it emerges out of the D-shaped cavity in to the gap once again. So the direction of the electric ﬁeld is reversed and it once again accelerates the particle. The electric ﬁeld thus has to have the correct frequency to coincide the change in its direction exactly with the entry of the particle in the gap. This process continues and with each round, the particle moves in a circular path with larger and larger R since R ∝ v. It ultimately emerges out of the cavity with an energy much higher than its initial energy. This simple picture that is presented above was the basic principle of the original cyclotron. It was soon realised that this picture is only valid in a certain domain. The crucial thing in the principle is that the frequency of the electric ﬁeld (which is required to accelerate the particles in the gap) is independent of the velocity and radius of the particle or its path. This is clear from Eq. (6.42). However, this expression is valid only in the non-relativistic domain. When the particle velocities are comparable to c, the speed of light, this equation is not valid. Hence, the electric ﬁeld frequency required for repeated acceleration is dependent on the energy of the particle when the particles reach velocities comparable to c. This is possible with another device, called a synchrotron which was developed soon after the cyclotron. After the development of the cyclotron, many different kinds of particle accelerators have been developed with increasing energies. These extremely high energies are required to probe the structure of matter at smaller and smaller distances. Currently, the highest energy accelerating machine is called the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva. It can accelerate protons such that their energies are almost 7,500 times their rest mass energy. The basic principle remains the same in all these accelerators— particles are accelerated in an electric ﬁeld and their trajectories are modiﬁed using a magnetic ﬁeld.\n\n6.2.5 Motion MotionofofCharged ChargedParticles ParticlesininNon-uniform Non-uniformMagnetic MagneticFields Fields We have studied the motion of charged particles in uniform magnetic ﬁelds. However, the magnetic ﬁelds encountered in most situations are not uniform and hence the analysis developed above is strictly not valid. The solution to the problem of the motion of a charged particle in a general non-uniform magnetic ﬁeld is a very complicated one and we shall not be considering it. However, there are certain kinds of ﬁelds, which, though non-uniform, allow us to use the above analysis in an approximate way. One such situation is where the magnetic ﬁeld is non-uniform but only over distance scales which are much larger than the Larmor radius (Eq. (6.27)). In this case, some of the analysis can be used in an approximate fashion over small regions where the ﬁeld can be considered to be uniform. One such example is when the magnetic ﬁeld lines converge towards a particular direction as shown in the Fig. 6.7. The magnetic ﬁeld that we consider has a dominant z-component and a much smaller x-component. Further, the ﬁeld increases as z increases. A charged particle having a velocity vz along z and v ⊥ =\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n275\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\nr B\n\nx\n\nx\n\nz\n\nz\n\nA\n\ny\n\ny\n\n(a)\n\nFig. 6.7\n\n(b)\n\n(a) Non-uniform field.

This is because locally, the particle will experience a uniform ﬁeld since the ﬁeld is changing (is ⊥ non-uniform) over a distance much larger than the Larmor radius (a = mv ). The radius of the helix is |q|B r=\n\nm|v⊥ | qBz\n\nwhere Bz is the component of the magnetic ﬁeld along the z direction. The particle at the point A in the Fig. 6.7 will also move along the z-direction with velocity vz .

The z-direction is coming out of the plane of the paper as is the longitudinal magnetic field. The direction of the magnetic force q(v × B) due to the transverse components of B is along the −z direction and hence it slows down the velocity along z-direction\n\nIf the ﬁeld was constant, along the z-direction, the positively charged particle would trace a trajectory whose projection on the x − y plane is as shown in Fig. 6.8. However, the ﬁeld is not uniform and has a transverse component. The force on the particle due to this transverse component will be along\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n276\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nthe −z-direction and hence if the particle had an initial velocity vz along the z-direction, this would decrease as the particle moves along the z-direction. Now, since the energy of the particle cannot change in a magnetic ﬁeld, any change in vz will be compensated by a corresponding change in v⊥ . In this case, as vz decreases, v⊥ will increase and as the particle moves forward in the z-direction, it would slow down. The Larmor radius mv⊥ a= qBz will decrease and the helical path will start to look like what is shown in Fig. 6.7(b). In the conﬁguration of the magnetic ﬁeld shown, if the pattern of the magnetic ﬁeld extends along the z-axis sufﬁciently, there will come a time when vz vanishes. The deceleration along z-axis will still be there and that means the particle will start moving backwards from that point. The trajectory of the particle will thus retrace back from that point. Such a magnetic ﬁeld thus acts like a ‘magnetic mirror’. A more interesting conﬁguration for the magnetic ﬁeld would be like Fig. 6.9 where the Bz starts tapering off also in the negative z-direction at some value of z. The motion of the particle in the left half of the ﬁeld would be the same as the right half reﬂected in the x − y plane. The particle on its way back after reﬂection from the right end enters the left half ultimately, where it again gets reﬂected at some point in the left half. This to and fro motion obviously continues indeﬁnitely. Such a device is called a ‘magnetic bottle’ which essentially conﬁnes charged particles within a ﬁnite volume.\n\nr B\n\nFig. 6.9\n\nMagnetic confinement bottle. The magnetic field becomes stronger as one goes from the centre towards the right or left. The charged particles execute a helical motion as they go to and fro from one end to the other\n\nAurora and Van Allen Belts The conﬁnement of charged particles in certain kinds of magnetic ﬁelds also occurs in nature. For instance, the magnetic ﬁeld of the earth, shown in Fig. 6.10 is an example of a non-uniform ﬁeld. The ﬁeld is the strongest near the magnetic poles and falls as we go far from them. This ﬁeld conﬁguration is very similar to the one we have studied above and so, in a similar manner the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld will trap charged particles.\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n277\n\nThe source of the charged particles is mostly the Sun, which spews them out constantly in the form of solar wind. Most of these particles, on encountering the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld are deﬂected away from the earth, but some of these do get trapped. This trapping leads to some spectacular natural phenomena. The formation of Auroras at the poles (Aurora Borealis near the northern pole and Aurora Australis near the South Pole) is one such phenomenon. The trapped particles near the poles, where the ﬁeld is the strongest, collide with the molecules in the atmosphere and produce radiation which is what is seen as the northern or southern lights at very high latitudes.\n\nFig. 6.10 Particle confinement in the earth's magnetic field. The shaded portions are the Van Allen belts. The inner one is about 500–6000 kilometres above the earth while the outer one is about 15000–30000 kilometres above At much higher altitudes, the trapped particles lead to the formation of regions called Van Allen belts. These torus-shaped regions, at very high altitudes were discovered in the 1958 by James Van Allen in rocket-based surveys of the atmosphere. Interestingly, similar regions of trapped charged particles have been discovered around other planets in the solar system.\n\n6.3 HALL EFFECT The Hall effect, discovered by E.J.Hall in 1879 is a direct manifestation of the forces on charged particles in motion by magnetic ﬁelds. Its importance lies in the fact that the experimental measurements done by Hall to measure the tiny effect preceded the discovery of the electron by almost a decade or more. Let us consider a conductor placed in a magnetic ﬁeld. An electric current is passed through the conductor in a direction which is perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. Now, as we have seen, current is basically the ﬂow of charge. The charge carriers in motion, will experience a magnetic force in the presence of the magnetic ﬁeld. This force, given by Eq. (6.3) would be perpendicular to both the direction of the current and the magnetic ﬁeld. The charge carriers will move under the inﬂuence of the force. However,\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n278\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nthe motion would be short-lived. This is because the charge carriers would soon reach the edges of the conductor and accumulate there being unable to cross the barrier presented to them. This accumulation of charge on one side of the conductor would create an electric ﬁeld which would be in a direction which is opposite to the magnetic force (not the magnetic ﬁeld which is perpendicular to the force). At equilibrium, the electric force caused by the ﬁeld due to the accumulated charges and the magnetic force would balance each other and there would be no further movement of the charge carriers in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic ﬁeld. The presence of the electric ﬁeld due to the accumulated charge carriers on one side of the conductor will obviously lead to the a voltage perpendicular to the direction of the current. This voltage was measured by Hall and is called Hall Voltage. The Hall effect is shown in Fig. 6.11. z\n\nBz\n\ny\n\n+ + + +\n\nx\n\nEy\n\n+ + + + Jx\n\n+\n\nFig. 6.11\n\nHall effect: An electric field in the x-direction in the conductor creates a current density jx in the x-direction. Bz is a uniform magnetic field in the z-direction over the conductor. Charges are piled up at the two edges in the y direction creating an electric field Ey as shown. At equilibrium current in the y-direction, jy is zero\n\nThe Hall effect as described above can be easily understood in terms of the free electron or Drude’s model for conduction of electric current in conductors. Recall that according to this model, conduction in most conductors is due to the negatively charged electrons carrying a charge −e where e > 0. If n is the number density of these electrons and v is their drift velocity along the x-axis due to an applied electric ﬁeld (or voltage), then the current density is in the x-direction and is given by jx = σ Ex\n\n(6.43)\n\nwhere σ is the conductivity and is given by ne2 τ m Here m is the mass of the electron and τ is the collision time. σ =\n\nNow the charges in motion along the x-direction will experience a force due to the magnetic ﬁeld ˆ This force will be B = Bz k. F = (−e)(v × B) ˆ = (−e)(vx iˆ × Bz k)\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n279\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n= evBz jˆ\n\n(6.44)\n\nAs we have seen above, this force will result in an accumulation of charges at the edges in the y-direction. Hence, an electric ﬁeld Ey will be created in the y-direction which will result in a force on the electrons given by FE = (−e)Ey At equilibrium, the two forces, both of which are in the y-direction must add to zero. So we have (−e)Ey + evBz = 0\n\n(6.45)\n\nEy = vBz\n\n(6.46)\n\nor\n\nBut v=−\n\njx ne\n\nand so we have jx Bz (6.47) ne The Hall voltage is given by VH = dEy , where d is the width of the sample in the y-direction. We can deﬁne a quantity called the Hall coefﬁcient, RH as Ey RH = (6.48) jx B z Then Eq. (6.47) can be written as Ey = −\n\nRH = −\n\n1 ne\n\n(6.49)\n\nThis result is very surprising: the Hall coefﬁcient (Eq. (6.48)), which can be experimentally measured by measuring magnetic ﬁeld strength Bz , current and voltage, provides information on the charge carrier, density n! For negatively charged carriers n is a negative number. Since this derivation of the Hall coefﬁcient is based on the classical Drude model of electrical conduction, experimental veriﬁcation of Eq. (6.49) can be used to test the model. Experimentally, it is seen that Eq. (6.49) is not quite accurate except in some metals and for very low magnetic ﬁeld strengths. This should not be surprising since the model on which it is based is classical in nature while the correct way of explaining conduction is based on quantum theory. We now give an example which gives some idea of the magnitude of the Hall coefﬁcient.\n\nEXAMPLE 6.3 A conductor, of rectangular shape has the dimensions as shown in Fig. 6.12. The voltage across AD is 10 mV and the conductivity of the material is σ = 6 × 107 /ohm m. A current I ﬂows in the direction as shown in the conductor. The conductor is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld of magnitude 1 Tesla in the direction as shown in the ﬁgure. Calculate the Hall voltage and Hall coefﬁcient given that the carrier density is 8 × 1028 m−3 .\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n280\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nC\n\nB\n\nG\n\nF\n\nr J D\n\nA E\n\nr B\n\nH\n\nFig. 6.12 Example 6.3 AB = 20 cm, AE = 1 mm, AD = 1 m\n\nSolution The electric ﬁeld can be calculated from the voltage across AD as 10−3 V = 10−3 V/m 1 m With this ﬁeld, the current density can be determined E=\n\nj = σ E = 6 × 107 × 10−3 = 6 × 104 A/m2 and the Hall coefﬁcient RH = −\n\n1 ∼ −8 × 10−11 m3 /C 8 × 1028 × 1.6 × 10−19\n\nThe electric ﬁeld in the direction AB is Ey = |RH j B| = 8 × 10−14 × 6 × 104 × 1 = 4.8 × 10−9 V/m And hence, the Hall voltage is VH = Ey × 0.2 = 0.96 × 10−9 V\n\n6.4 FORCE ON A CURRENT CARRYING LOOP 6.4.1 Force Forceand andTorque Torqueon onaaCurrent CurrentCarrying CarryingLoop LoopininaaUniform UniformField Field We have seen how a current carrying conductor, when placed in a magnetic ﬁeld experiences a force. If the current carrying conductor is in the form of a loop, then the geometry of the loop makes the interaction with the magnetic ﬁeld more complicated. We will ﬁrst see what happens in the case the loop is a rectangular loop and then generalise to a general geometry. Consider a planar loop OP QR carrying a current I . As shown in Fig. 6.13, we take the plane of the loop to be the x − y plane and O as the origin. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld B = Bx iˆ + By jˆ + Bz kˆ is present throughout. Consider two inﬁnitesimal elements of the loop, each of length dl on the two opposite arms, OP and QR of the loop. The current ﬂowing in these two elements, I , is equal but in opposite directions and the forces on these elements are dF1 = I dl(iˆ × B)\n\n(6.50)\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\nFig. 6.13\n\n281\n\nA rectangular loop in a uniform magnetic field B. 1 and 2 are infinitesimal elements located − → at S and T having positions OS = r 1 and OT = r 2 . T S is parallel to jˆ\n\nand dF2 = I dl(−iˆ × B)\n\n(6.51)\n\nIt is obvious that these forces add up to zero. Now we can break up the entire loop into such pairs of elements with equal and opposite currents and thus the net force on the loop in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld is zero. However, since the loop is an extended object with equal and opposite forces acting on different parts, this will lead to a torque. For the two elements above, the torques are d τ1 = I dl r 1 × (iˆ × B) (6.52) and d τ2 = −I dl r 2 × (iˆ × B)\n\n(6.53)\n\nBut (r 1 − r 2 ) = −W jˆ where W jˆ is the line T S joining T to S. Thus, the sum of these two torques is simply d τ = d τ1 + d τ2 = −I dlW jˆ × (i × B) = −I dlW By iˆ\n\n(6.54)\n\nAdding up all the torques on inﬁnitesimal elements along OP and QR, we get τ1 = −I LW By iˆ\n\n(6.55)\n\nWe can do a similar exercise for the two arms OR and PQ and get τ2 = I LW Bx jˆ\n\n(6.56)\n\nThus, the total torque on the loop is ˆ τ = τ1 + τ2 = I LW (Bx jˆ − By i)\n\n(6.57)\n\nWe can now deﬁne the area vector of the loop. This is a vector whose magnitude is the area of the loop and direction is the outward normal. A = W Lkˆ\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n282\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nWith this, the total torque on the loop can be written in a compact form as τ = I (A × B)\n\n(6.58)\n\nWe further deﬁne a quantity called the magnetic dipole moment associated with the current carrying loop. μ = IA In terms of the dipole moment, the total torque thus, becomes τ = (μ × B)\n\n(6.59)\n\nThe fact that the total torque on a current carrying loop is dependent on the dipole moment of the loop seems to indicate that this result, though derived for a rectangular loop, might be valid for an arbitrary shape. This is indeed the case. To see this, consider a loop as in Fig. 6.14. We divide the loop into a large number of rectangular loops which in the limit are inﬁnite in number. The arms next to the boundary carry a current I while the inner rectangles have a current I going one way and the same current going in the opposite direction. Thus, the only arms where there is a net current are the outermost arms which in the limit of the number of rectangles going to inﬁnity become the boundary of the loop of arbitrary shape. For each of the inner rectangles, the result for the net torque applies. The normal to all the loops (which is the direction of the area vector) is in the same direction. Thus, the torque due to the rectangles adds up and we get the torque as in Eq. (6.59) except that now the area entering the dipole moment is the area of the loop.\n\nFig. 6.14 A loop of arbitrary shape divided into rectangles. In the limit of the number of rectangles becoming infinite, the outermost arms form the loop and the net current in all but the outermost arms is zero\n\nIt is interesting to note that the expression for the torque on a magnetic dipole is very similar to the torque on an electric dipole, with the magnetic ﬁeld replaced by the electric ﬁeld and the magnetic dipole moment by the electric dipole moment. The magnetic dipole is made of a current carrying loop while an electric dipole was made of two equal and opposite charges separated by a distance. Whether we can conceive of magnetic dipoles in a similar fashion, i.e., made up of two equal and opposite magnetic ‘charges’, is something we shall explore in later chapters.\n\n6.4.2 Moving MovingCoil CoilGalvanometer Galvanometer We have seen in Section 6.4.1 that a current carrying loop in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld experiences no net force. Instead, it experiences a torque which is given by Eq. (6.59). Recall that the magnetic moment of a loop is directly proportional to the current in the loop. These two facts can be used to construct\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\n283\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\ndevices which detect or measure currents in circuits. Any such device, which is used to measure or detect a current is called a galvanometer. The most common type of galvanometer is the moving coil galvanometer. The basic construction of a moving coil galvanometer is shown in Figs. 6.15 and 6.16. Scale Pointer\n\nCoil Permanent magnet\n\nFig. 6.15\n\nSpring\n\nThe basic construction of a pivot type moving coil galvanometer\n\nThe source of the magnetic ﬁeld is usually a permanent magnet. A current carrying coil C, which typically consists of several turns of insulated copper wire is wound on a rectangular frame. The coil is either suspended with a conducting wire or strip or mounted on a pivot with a spring, so that it can rotate in the region between the poles of the permanent magnet freely. In the case of a suspended coil, a small mirror is attached to the suspension wire while in the case of a mounted coil, a pointer is attached to the coil itself.\n\nMirror Coil\n\nPermanent magnet\n\nWhen a current I passes through the coil, it experiences a deﬂecting torque which is given by τ = N I Bab sin θ\n\n(6.60)\n\nFig. 6.16 The basic construction of a suspended type moving coil galvanometer\n\nwhere N is the number of turns of wire in the coil, a and b are the length and breadth of the rectangular coil and θ is the angle between the normal to the coil and the magnetic ﬁeld. In the case of the arrangement in the moving coil galvanometer, this angle is always 90◦ . Now under the inﬂuence of this deﬂecting torque, the coil, which is free to rotate, starts rotating. As soon as the coil rotates, the suspension wire or the spring exerts a restoring torque which is proportional to the angle of rotation. At some point, the deﬂecting and the restoring torques are equal and the coil comes to a rest at an angle φ to the initial equilibrium position. In the case of the suspension wire, this angle of deﬂection is usually measured by the motion of a beam of light which shines on the mirror attached to the suspension wire. The incident\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n284\n\n16:11\n\nElectricity, Magnetism and Electromagnetic Theory\n\nlight on the mirror gets deﬂected by an angle 2φ and this deﬂection is usually observed on a scale placed at a distance of 1 meter from the galvanometer. In the case of the pivoted coil, this deﬂection is directly measured by the motion of the pointer which moves through an angle φ. When the coil comes to rest under the inﬂuence of two opposing torques, the deﬂecting torque caused by the interaction of the magnetic ﬁeld and the current and the restoring torque caused by the elasticity of the suspension wire, we see that N I abB = κφ (6.61) where κ is the restoring torque per unit angle of the wire or the spring. Thus, we see that by measuring φ and knowing all the other parameters, one can measure the current passing through the galvanometer coil.\n\n6.4.3 Ballistic BallisticGalvanometer Galvanometer A galvanometer, as we saw above is an instrument which is frequently used to measure or detect currents. Since current is simply the rate of ﬂow of charge, it seems natural that one should be able to use the same instrument, with suitable modiﬁcations for measurement of charge. Recall that Q=\n\nI dt\n\nand so, if we can make an integrator with a moving coil galvanometer described in the previous subsection, we should be able to measure the charge. Such a device is called a Ballistic Galvanometer. Basically, a ballistic galvanometer is really a modiﬁed moving coil galvanometer where the moving part (in this case the coil) has a large moment of inertia. This ensures that the time period for oscillation is large and measurements can be made easily. We now describe the working of a basic ballistic galvanometer. A moving coil of N turns placed in a magnetic ﬁeld and suspended by a suspension wire will experience a deﬂecting torque when a current I is passed through it given by Eq. (6.60) with θ = π/2 as we saw above. Recall that the torque for rotational motion is like force for linear motion. Hence, we have T\n\nangular momentum =\n\nT\n\nτ dt = 0\n\nN I ABdt = N ABQ\n\n(6.62)\n\n0\n\nBut the angular momentum for the coil is also given by Im ω where Im is the moment of inertia and ω is the frequency of oscillation. Thus, we have N BAQ = Im ω\n\n(6.63)\n\n1 I ω2 . If κ 2 m\n\nand the kinetic energy of the coil is is the restoring couple per unit deﬂection, then the work done in twisting the suspension through an angle φ is given by φ\n\nκφdφ =\n\n1 2 κφ 2\n\n(6.64)\n\n0\n\nThis work done should be equal to the kinetic energy of the coil 1 1 Im ω2 = κφ 2 2 2 κ 2 2 ω = φ Im\n\n(6.65)\n\nchap6\n\nSamples\n\nMay 2, 2012\n\n16:11\n\nMagnetic Forces and Fields\n\n285\n\nBut from Eq. (6.63), ω2 = and so, we have\n\nB 2 N 2 A2 Q2 Im2\n\nB 2 N 2 A2 Q2 κ 2 = φ 2 Im Im Q2 =\n\nκ2 Im 2 φ B 2 N 2 A2 κ\n\n(6.66)\n\nThe time period of oscillation T is given by T = 2π\n\nIm κ\n\nand therefore, Q=\n\nκT φ 2π BN A\n\n(6.67)\n\nThus, we have a relationship between the charge passing through the galvanometer and the deﬂection angle φ in terms of the galvanometer parameters. The theory presented above is obviously for an idealised galvanometer—one in which the coil executes undamped simple harmonic motion. In reality, there is always some damping present in the system. These are primarily due to air damping and a form of damping called electromagnetic d"
