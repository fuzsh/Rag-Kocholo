        "text": "The Magic Flute was Mozart's final opera, and is the composer at his crowd-pleasing, inventive best. The libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder features princes and princesses, evil queens and killer serpents, demons and spirits. It transports audiences to a far-off land.\n\nWe've been performing the opera for more than six decades, and it's offered plenty of artists the opportunity to let their imaginations run wild. Our productions have all been beautiful, surprising and out of this world.\n\nDirector Kate Gaul and her fabulous creative team will be the next to put their own unique spin on The Magic Flute in a new production at Sydney Opera House this summer.\n\nIn the lead up, we're celebrating our rich history with The Magic Flute, from our first ever season, to a Royal visit, to Mozart on the beach!\n\n1956\n\nIn 1956, our company was born with a tour of four Mozart operas. Then known as the Elizabethan Trust Opera Company, we started with a season in Adelaide, before touring to Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth.\n\nAmong the four operas was a whimsical version of The Magic Flute, by Viennese-born director Stefan Haag, who was associated with Opera Australia until 1969. The production was set in a fantastical land that drew a lot of inspiration from Ancient Egypt, and included plenty of special effects. The Queen of the Night, played by Betty Prentice, made her entrance upon a flying cloud from the side of the stage (although there were performances when the cloud refused to cooperate and make its full journey, leaving the singer hanging in the air). The production was revived in 1959 and then 1968, and was notorious for its technical challenges.\n\nIt also featured projections (a novelty in opera at the time), including 35 slides for 13 scenes, designed and painted by Desmonde Downing. Special projectors were to be delivered from Vienna for the production, but they were held up in customs and reached Adelaide only five days before the premiere.\n\nThe cast also included Max Worthley as Tamino, Geoffrey Chard (who last appeared with the company in 1996 after a long stretch of leading roles) as Papageno, Marjorie Conley (Chardâs wife) as Pamina, and Stanley Clarkson as Sarastro. They were conducted by Joseph Post.\n\n1973\n\nThe opening of the Sydney Opera House was a pivotal moment in our companyâs history. As part of our first season in the venue, we commissioned a new production of The Magic Flute by British opera legend, John Copley. He created a straight-forward but frequently funny rendering of the piece, with costumes and sets by John Stoddart, an Australian designer who was having enormous success in Europe at the time. Stoddart would go on to design many of our most loved productions, most recently the 2012 production of Die Tote Stadt.\n\nSir Charles Mackerras conducted a cast that included Anson Austin as Tamino, Joan Carden as Pamina, and Donald Shanks as Sarastro. Queen Elizabeth II attended the first performance of the production on 22 October, two days after she officially opened the Sydney Opera House.\n\nThe production was revived regularly for the next decade and became an audience favourite.\n\n1986\n\nSwedish opera director GÃ¶ran JÃ¤rvefelt was already considered a Mozart specialist when he came to Australia to direct a new production of The Magic Flute, filling in for Elijah Moshinsky, who dropped out to take on other projects.\n\nJÃ¤rvefelt wanted to create a version that found the humanity of the story, focusing on the journeys of the two young couples: Pamina and Tamino, and Papagena and Papageno. Swedish singer HÃ¥kan HagegÃ¥rd sang Papageno, a role he had previously performed in Ingmar Bergmannâs 1975 film of the opera, with Gran Wilson as Tamino, and Amanda Thane as Pamina.\n\nRichard Bonynge conducted the production, and while its creation wasnât always the smoothest process â Moffatt Oxenbould, former Opera Australia Artistic Director, recalls that Bonynge and JÃ¤rvefelt were in constant conflict over the staging â it was celebrated by critics as a sensitive and surprisingly moving version of the opera. It remained in our repertoire for almost two decades, until 2005.\n\n1996\n\nIn 1996, we launched a touring venture â known as OzOpera â with a new production of The Magic Flute. OzOpera was imagined as a way of bringing popular operas to non-traditional venues and its spirit lives on in our extensive National Tour and Schools Tour programs.\n\nFor the inaugural production, we approached recent NIDA directing graduate Greg McLean and designer Liane Wilcher. They drew inspiration from carnivals, circuses and Australiana, creating a production that could be easily adapted for all sorts of venues. The production used an English translation and the music was overseen by Richard Gill.\n\nMcLean would go on to write and direct the terrifying outback horror film Wolf Creek. Weâre confident that his experiences of touring Australia with our company did not serve as inspiration for his gory hit film.\n\n2006\n\nFor our 50th anniversary season, we reimagined The Magic Flute (again), in a nod to our first ever season. Australian-born opera director David Freeman was enlisted to bring a fresh perspective to the piece, joining forces with Australiaâs leading physical theatre ensemble, Legs on the Wall, to create a magical, high-flying version of this mythical story. Debra Batton, who was then Artistic Director of Legs on the Wall, created fabulous movement for each of the characters as the production's choreographer.\n\nDan Potraâs designs were original and imaginative, with the Queen of the Night making her entrance on a floating crescent moon (which thankfully proved less technically fraught than the floating cloud in our 1956 production). Amelia Farrugia scaled the heights of Mozartâs score as the Queen of the Night, with Emma Matthews as Pamina, Jaewoo Kim as Tamino, and Warwick Fyfe as Papageno. The cast was conducted by Opera Australia Music Director, Richard Hickox.\n\n2006\n\nNot only did we have a new mainstage production of The Magic Flute in 2006, but we also took Mozart's operatic adventure into schools.\n\nOur Schools Tour, which started in 1998, brings specially adapted, 50-minute operatic performances into assembly halls and classrooms around the country. The Magic Flute was the perfect piece for younger audiences, and was adapted with plenty of laughs and an appropriate level of silliness by director Christine Anketell.\n\nThe production has been regularly on the road since it premiered, and last toured in New South Wales in 2018.\n\n2012\n\nWith her globe-conquering 1997 stage version of The Lion King, Julie Taymor became one of the worldâs most influential theatre directors. She brought her extraordinary imagination to Mozart in this production, which premiered at the Metropolitan Opera in 2005 and made its Australian debut at the Sydney Opera House in 2012 with conductor Jonathan Darlington.\n\nTaymor, whose use of puppetry became famous through The Lion King, employed dazzling, oversized puppets and props to create a visually spectacular, family-friendly affair. The production was performed in English and features some judicious edits to ensure the action rolls forward and the focus is on the operaâs protagonists.\n\nAt the centre of the opera was a giant rotating Perspex palace, with a nine-metre serpent puppet and towering polar bears trawling about the stage.\n\nThe premiere season featured Nicole Car and Mariana Hong as Pamina, Andrew Brunsdon and John Longmuir as Tamino, Andrew Jones and Luke Gabbedy as Papageno, Emma Pearson, Suzanne Shakespeare and Angela Brun as Queen of the Night, and David Parkin as Sarastro.\n\n2014\n\nIn 2014, The Magic Flute was back on the road in a new production directed by Michael Gow. With a new English adaptation, Gow set the action in 1930s Egypt, drawing inspiration from action adventure movies like the Indiana Jones series and The Mummy.\n\nThe cast included Stacey Alleaume and Emma Castelli as Pamina, Nicholas Jones and Jonathan Abernethy as Tamino, Andrew Moran and Christopher Hillier as Papageno, and Regina Daniel and Hannah Dahlenburg as Queen of the Night.\n\nAs part of our national tour, we staged a more elaborate version of the production on Coolangatta Beach on the Gold Coast, our first Opera on the Beach, complete with a community chorus, a troupe of local surf lifesavers, and fireworks."
