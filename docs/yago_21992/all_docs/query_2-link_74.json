        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: After Kenneth Branagh set Jodie Comer to star in his next director outing The Last Disturbance of Madeline Hynde, the Oscar winner has rounded out the rest of his ensemble. Patricia Arquette, Michael Sheen, Tom Bateman, Vicky McClure, Michael Balogun, Kristina Tonteri-Young and Karla Crome have joined a cast that also includes Aiysha Hart and Gemma Whelan. Production is underway in the UK.\n\nThe independently financed film is being described as a contemporary psychological thriller, but the logline is being kept under wraps. Branagh reunites with his Belfast producers Tamar Thomas, Laura Berwick and Becca Kovacik, along with Matthew Jenkins and Maximum Effort’s Ashley Fox and Johnny Pariseau.\n\nBranagh most recently co-starred in Christopher Nolan’s Oscar Best Picture-winning Oppenheimer. He recently wrapped production starring in Mayday opposite Ryan Reynolds for Apple Original Films and Skydance, and later this year will return to the stage for King Lear opening at the Shed in New York, starring and co-directing with Rob Ashford & Lucy Skilbeck.\n\nBranagh is represented by WME, Berwick & Kovacik and Gochman Law Group, and Arquette is represented by 3 Arts Entertainment, Gersh, and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman. Sheen is represented by Roxane Vacca Management, CAA and Link Entertainment. Bateman is represented by CAA, United Agents in the UK and attorney Patti Felker.\n\nMcClure is represented by Kate Buckley at 42 and Pip Gill Entertainment. Balogun is represented by Bhumi Ambasna at The Artists Partnership. Tonteri-Young is represented by Dan Copeland at Independent Talent Group in the UK and Artists First and Buchwald in the U.S. Crome is represented by B-Side Management in the UK and Canopy Media Partners. Hart is represented by Curtis Brown. Whelan is represented by Alexander Cooke / Hamilton Hodell."
