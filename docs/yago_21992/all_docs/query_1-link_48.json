        "text": "Synopsis\n\nSarastro, as Narrator, invites us into the timeless tale of love and wisdom, which begins with the entry of a young prince, Tamino. He is being pursued by a monster. Overcome with terror, Tamino faints. At that moment, Three Ladies appear. They vanquish the monster, then inspect the unconscious Tamino. Their boss, the Queen of the Night, is looking for the right guy to take on a mission, and he could be the one.\n\nThe Ladies exit, leaving Tamino alone. Just as he begins to come to, a birdcatcher appears, introduces himself as Papageno, and speaks of his quest for love. He also tells Tamino that he is the one who vanquished the monster. Just then, the Three Ladies return. They punish Papageno for his lie by sealing his mouth shut.\n\nActing on orders from the Queen of the Night, the Ladies produce a portrait of her daughter. They tell Tamino the girl has been abducted by “the evil Sarastro.” Tamino is deeply moved by the tale of the grieving mother and her helpless daughter – not to mention the portrait of beautiful Pamina.\n\nTamino’s reverie is interrupted by the arrival of the Queen of the Night, who describes her daughter’s abduction and commands Tamino to save her. As the Queen makes a dramatic exit, Papageno begs the Ladies to restore his speech, which they do. A mysterious creature brings forth magical talismans for Tamino and Papageno.\n\nEveryone scatters, looking for Pamina. Monastatos appears. He is a new member of Sarastro’s brotherhood, and he has been charged with taking care of Pamina, but she has fled. Not long after he disappears, continuing his search, Pamina herself appears. Papageno immediately recognizes the girl from the portrait. He explains that he is part of a five-person search party and tells Pamina that no one is more eager to find her than Prince Tamino, who had fallen in love at the first glimpse of her portrait. Pamina and Papageno sing together of their longing for love. When they are surprised by Monastatos, Papageno, thinking quickly, uses his magic bells to charm Monastatos. Just then, the voices of the brotherhood rise up around them.\n\nSarastro enters the story. Pamina confesses that she tried to run away because she was afraid of Monastatos. Sarastro explains that he abducted Pamina for her own good and warns her that her Mother is dangerous. Just then, Monastatos drags Tamino in. Time stops for Pamina and Tamino, who see their destiny in each other. Monastatos suggests harsh punishment for the trespassers and is surprised when Sarastro punishes him instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen of the Night has stolen into the Narrator’s seat. As she leafs through the book, she is infuriated to see how Sarastro is framing the story. She remembers how her husband left her and disappeared into Sarastro’s community. She fears she will never see her daughter, Pamina, again.\n\nSarastro believes Tamino is destined to vanquish darkness and ignorance, once and for all. But first, he must undergo a series of trials. If Tamino proves himself worthy, he will have Pamina as reward. The priests offer Tamino and Papageno a series of riddling instructions, admonishing them to speak to no one but each other. Tamino vows to follow their instructions, no matter the cost. The Three Ladies burst into the scene and urge Papageno and Tamino to flee with them, but Tamino is determined to follow the path described by Sarastro and his brotherhood.\n\nMeanwhile, Monastatos, frustrated by his lack of success with women, corners Pamina. The Queen of the Night comes to her daughter’s rescue, but then hands Pamina a knife and demands that she kill Sarastro. When Pamina hesitates, the Queen threatens her daughter with death.\n\nBefore Pamina can respond, her mother is gone. Pamina is relieved to see Tamino and Papageno, but when Tamino, determined to follow the priests’ instructions, refuses to speak to Pamina, her joy turns to confusion and despair. Papageno, too, is losing hope of ever finding a true love. Both Pamina and Papageno question whether life is worth living.\n\nThe Three Ladies, newly inspired by the example of Sarastro and his community, prevent Pamina from committing suicide: they lead Pamina to Tamino, and the pair successfully completes the trials together. Next the Ladies turn their attention to Papageno, revealing his perfect mate: Papagena. The Queen and Monastatos make a last, unsuccessful effort to destroy Sarastro’s rule, but they are easily turned away. All who remain celebrate the triumph of wisdom and love.\n\nExplore the Magic Flute\n\nNick Richardson\n\nIs it a fairytale? A romance? A cautionary tale? No matter how you classify it, The Magic Flute remains a lasting favorite of Mozart’s many masterpieces. The opera stages the struggle between forces of darkness and light. As they pursue their destinies, each character must resist base temptations and aspire to the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment: truth, logic, and reason.\n\nBut whose story is “the truth”? The Festival’s production this year – a storybook framework with shifting narrators – brings that idea to the fore. It’s a fitting approach in a time when America questions the truth in its own history, media, and political structures. Though truth may be relative, one thing is certain: once the storybook cracks open, you’re in for a thrilling ride.\n\nTrue love, royalty, and magical creatures await you on the lawn at The Glimmerglass Festival.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nFurther Reading on the Web\n\nNo phones are allowed in theaters, but that doesn’t mean you can’t take the opera with you. In 2020, mobile game developers Opusludus released The Flute based on the first scene of the opera. Players help Prince Tamino take down dragons and other creatures on his quest to rescue Princess Pamina. Mozart’s score serves as the soundtrack. Read about the game on Classic FM, and download the game for iOS or Android.\n\nNear-death, impoverished, and sickly – the end of Mozart’s life was not a fairytale, and yet he still managed to write a masterpiece. The San Francisco Symphony shares Mozart’s backstory leading up to him composing The Magic Flute.\n\nNicolas Cage’s hunt for National Treasure has nothing on these music scholars! Discover the references to Freemasonry in Mozart’s score and Emanuel Schikaneder’s libretto, as explained here by Opera Grand Rapids.\n\nReady for a change of scenery? Jonathan Dean, dramaturg at Seattle Opera, tracks the shift from Neoclassical to Romantic visual and scenic arts through set designs from early productions of The Magic Flute.\n\nAudio and Video Resources\n\nFilm buffs, rejoice! Film adaptations of The Magic Flute abound. Ingmar Bergman’s Swedish-language made-for-TV movie is a light-hearted departure from his typical dark, psychological subject matter. Kenneth Branagh’s 2006 release sets The Magic Flute in a town of rubble during World War I. Tamino is a soldier, Papageno takes care of the canaries sent into trenches to detect gas, and the fate of the world is in their hands. Currently in post-production is a modern take in which a young music student finds a forgotten passageway into the world of The Magic Flute. (Expected premiere at the end of 2022.)\n\nPop goes The Magic Flute! Mozart’s score is featured in movies, television, and even cartoons. Indulge in all of the pop culture references to Flute in this blog post from Seattle Opera.\n\nA TED Talk for opera lovers! This TED-Ed animation introduces you to the opera’s plot, themes, and some neat music analysis.\n\nFor the Bookworm\n\nFlute fanatics will enjoy British musicologist Michael Freyhan’s The Authentic Magic Flute Libretto: Mozart’s Autograph or the First Full-Score Edition? He details the differences between the two versions, traces how the first full-score edition became the standard, and makes a case for restoring Mozart’s autograph as the definitive text.\n\nIn Mozart and the Enlightenment: Truth, Virtue and Beauty in Mozart’s Operas, Nicholas Till explores how Mozart’s operas are informed by ideas and discoveries of the Enlightenment, drawing on writings by Richardson, Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, Goethe, Schiller, and Blake, among others.\n\nDavid J. Buch presents a thorough study of sources and influences on magical elements in opera in Magic Flutes and Enchanted Forests: The Supernatural in Eighteenth-Century Music Theater. His sites of study range from the Opéra-Comique to London’s Queen’s Theatre to Vienna’s Theater auf der Wieden (where The Magic Flute had its world premiere).\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nThe Magic Flute: A Hero’s Journey\n\nA long time ago, in an opera far, far away…\n\nWhat do Star Wars and The Magic Flute have in common? They are both archetypal “hero’s journeys” or “monomyths.” In these stories, the protagonist leaves home to go on an epic quest in a world unknown. They face challenges that lead to an ultimate battle. Emerging victorious and transformed, the hero returns home with a new worldview. You might have studied this in your high school English class with the Odyssey. (If this doesn’t ring a bell, consider the bildungsroman, a specific type of hero’s journey focused on the character’s coming of age. Think The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger or Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse.)\n\nIn The Magic Flute, we start with Tamino – our Luke – already on his quest for Enlightenment. Like Luke, Tamino knows there’s something more out there in the galaxy. The ideals of the Enlightenment are the ways of the Jedi of the 1700s; truth, reason, logic, and science will help Tamino reach a higher level of self-realization – of oneness with The Force.\n\nOf course, Tamino can’t complete this quest alone. Every hero’s journey needs a comedic sidekick. This character is a foil to the protagonist. He enhances the hero’s noble qualities and represents the common man at risk should the hero not succeed. Enter the beloved bird-catcher Papageno. Papageno’s only quest in life is to find a wife and a snack. Against his will, he is partnered with Tamino to help him reach his destiny.\n\nWe can compare Papageno to C-3PO or R2-D2, for they both provide comedy and allow the viewer to enter the world of the story. C-3PO asks clarifying questions and remarks on the action (usually in shock) so that the viewer knows how to feel about different events. In our production, Papageno is more analogous to Jar Jar Binks – a little daft.\n\nSo, with Papageno in tow, who stands in Tamino’s way? Tamino thinks it’s Sarastro, who kidnapped his destined lover, Princess Pamina. That’s what the Queen of the Night wants him to believe. She tries to entice Tamino to defeat Sarastro in exchange for Pamina’s hand.\n\nPlot twist: It’s actually the Queen of the Night who is the Anakin/Vader of this story. Once good, the Queen of the Night has succumbed to the Dark Side. Sure, Sarastro kidnapped Pamina, but only to protect her from her evil mother. The audience learns this at the same time as Tamino and Papageno, putting the “drama” in dramatic irony.\n\nSarastro helps Tamino distinguish between light and dark, as Yoda teaches Luke. Before Tamino and Luke can face their foes, they must both face trials that challenge their skills and their commitment to the light side. Only after completing this “training” are they equipped to save the world and reap their rewards. Sarastro saves Tamino from the powers of darkness, Tamino saves Pamina from the Queen, and Papageno is rewarded with a wife of his own. With darkness now vanquished, everyone basks in the glow of Enlightenment. Cue the dancing Ewoks.\n\nIf Star Wars isn’t your fandom, you can find the hero’s journey in many other books and movies. The hero’s journey is a common narrative trope (though maybe without Mozart and Schikaneder’s plot twist). Compare the plot elements of Flute with The Lord of the Rings, the Harry Potter series, The Wizard of Oz, or even Rocky or The Emperor’s New Groove. You can take a hero’s journey in a boxing ring in Philadelphia or in a galaxy far, far away.\n\n(Ready for your own hero’s journey? Play as Tamino in The Flute, a mobile game based on the first scene of the opera. Take down dragons and other creatures on your quest to save Princess Pamina. You can download the game for iOS or Android.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nYou Staged The Magic Flute How?!\n\nThink the Star Wars parallels are a stretch? Think again. The Norwegian National Opera set their 2015 production of Flute squarely in George Lucas’s universe, and the production photos will make your jaw drop. Texas State University and Biola University have also taken an intergalactic approach to the opera.\n\nOther fun and wild spins on The Magic Flute include Pacific Opera Project’s Nintendo-inspired production with Tamino as Link and Pamina as Zelda. (Don’t worry, Mario and Peach are also on stage as Papageno and Papagena.) Get a taste of “SuperFlute” with this clip, then settle in to watch the whole production with commentary from Artistic Director Josh Shaw.\n\nTheatre technicians will love the projections in this production from Komische Oper Berlin and British arts company 1927. Staged against a giant blank wall, the opera comes to life through projected animations that combine the aesthetics of black-and-white silent films with 1930s German Expressionism. It first premiered in Berlin in 2012 and has since been staged by opera companies around the world over the last decade.\n\nThe Magic Flute has also been adapted for film. The classic is Ingrid Bergman’s Swedish-language made-for-TV movie, a light-hearted departure from his typical dark, psychological subject matter. Kenneth Branagh’s 2006 direction sets The Magic Flute in a town of rubble during World War I. Tamino is a soldier, and Papageno is at war too, but still among the birds. He takes care of the canaries sent into trenches to detect gas attacks. Premiering in Europe at the end of 2022 is a modern take in which a young music student at Mozart’s conservatory in Austria finds a forgotten passageway into the world of The Magic Flute. An American release date has yet to be announced.\n\nPhoto: Karli Cadel\n\nThe Podcast\n\nMagic Flute Recipe"
