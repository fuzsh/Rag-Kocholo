        "text": "Bergman must have reached a new, serene assurance to have tackled this sensuous, luxuriant opera that has bewildered so many stage directors, and to have brought it off so unaffectedly. It's a whole unfussy production with the bloom still on it.\n\nFull Review | Oct 20, 2023\n\nThe Magic Flute is a fascinating look into Bergman's thoughts on the pretense of theater and film and the shared DNA between the two.\n\nFull Review | Jan 7, 2021\n\nParadoxically, Bergman has completely re-imagined The Magic Flute as a cinematic work, despite how blatantly theatrical it is in virtually every imaginable respect.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Dec 11, 2020\n\nThe film doesn't offer much. It's a true version, with some glimmers of irony and good humor, always in between cinema and theater. [Full Review in Spanish]\n\nFull Review | Jul 17, 2019\n\nIf anything, The Magic Flute gives viewers the clearest window into Bergman's fascination with the otherworldly, as the project allowed him to realize his childhood dream of filming his favorite opera.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 8/10 | Jun 3, 2019\n\nIngmar Bergman's revived 1975 version of Mozart's opera makes an uncharacteristically playful film for him about what is essentially a custody battle fought on a metaphysical level.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Aug 27, 2018\n\nWhile the Mozart purist may take issue with Bergman's conception of The Magic Flute, no one can deny the technical perfection with which the film has been mounted.\n\nFull Review | Jul 11, 2018\n\nIngmar Bergman has never before made a movie so warm, happy and innocent... It's as if all this joy has been building up inside him during the great decade of metaphysical films beginning with Persona.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Jul 9, 2018\n\nIt's the most fun you'll have at an opera this side of Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny. No wonder the audience - glimpsed in individual tightly framed shots - seem enraptured.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Mar 21, 2018\n\nIngmar Bergman's version of Mozart's The Magic Flute isn't his most cinematic work - it's a film version of an opera and was originally shown on Swedish TV. Nonetheless, there are elements here which echo his other films.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Mar 14, 2018\n\nWhat Bergman does is to convey the actual magic of theater at its best.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | May 20, 2009\n\nUsing the opera's timeless whimsy and inventiveness, the movie replicates a performance on the stage that is so good that it almost makes you forget the participants' ABBA-like hairstyles.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Dec 7, 2007"
