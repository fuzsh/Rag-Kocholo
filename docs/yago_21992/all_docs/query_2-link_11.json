        "text": "This generation of filmgoers mostly probably thinks of Irish actor-director Kenneth Branagh as Agatha Christie’s mustachioed detective Hercule Poirot in Murder on the Orient Express (2017), Death on the Nile (2022) and the upcoming A Haunting in Venice.\n\nBut there is so much more to Branagh’s career. As a director, he’s dabbled in multiple genres, including fantasy (The Magic Flute, 2000), action (Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, 2014), science fiction (Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, 1994), thriller (Sleuth, 2007), comedy (Peter’s Friends, 1992) and superhero (Thor, 2011).\n\nBranaghs career as an actor has been equally as diverse. He’s acted in legal thrillers (The Gingerbread Man, 1998), Westerns (Wild Wild West, 1999), romantic thrillers (Dead Again, 1981), animation (The Road to El Dorado, 2000), fantasy pics (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, 2002) and dramedies (The Boat That Rocked, 2009).\n\nAnd then there’s Shakespeare. There’s always Shakespeare. Branagh has a self-professed love of the Bard. He’s acted in and directed seven films based on the playwright’s works: Henry V (1989), Much Ado About Nothing (1993), Othello (1995), Hamlet (1996), Love’s Labour’s Lost (2000), As You Like It (2006) and All Is True (2018).\n\n“People often ask me, ‘Why do you keep doing Shakespeare?’ Well, because it’s meaningful to me,” Branagh was quoted as saying. “That to do it well — or even just to work on it — I find very life-enhancing. I don’t have any kind of conventional religious belief and I find Shakespeare’s a tremendous source of inspiration, because there’s no situation that I’ve come up against that somehow hasn’t been described in those plays. … It’s like a wonderful dog that gives you much more than you’ll ever give it.”\n\nBranagh collaborated in four films with Emma Thompson, to whom he was married from 1989-95: Henry V, Dead Again, Peter’s Friends and Much Ado About Nothing, as well as in TV movie Look Back in Anger (1989) and TV series Fortunes of War (1987).\n\nAnd along the way, he’s as worked with such award-winning actors and actresses as Colin Firth, Denzel Washington, Christian Bale, Helena Bonham-Carter, Laurence Fishburne, Robert De Niro, Julie Christie, Robert Downey Jr., William Hurt, Will Smith, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt.\n\nThe work as been rewarding — well, at least awarding. Branagh has won an Academy Award, four BAFTAs, two Emmys, a Golden Globe and an Olivier Award.\n\nTake a trip with us through Branagh’s diverse and fascinating career."
