        "text": "Share this Article:\n\nJodie Comer is to headline a brand new thriller from Kenneth Branagh, The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde.\n\nKenneth Branagh is moving back to the world of thrillers for his next film as director, with the news that he’s picked his next project.\n\nThe Oscar-winner is set to direct The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde, described as a new psychological thriller for which he’s also written the screenplay for.\n\nJodie Comer will be taking in the lead role in the new film, that Branagh has put together as an independent project, just as he and his team did with the Oscar-winning Belfast. The movie is due to start filming in the UK in August of this year, and presumably will be ready for our eyes in 2025. No further casting, outside of Comer’s involvement, has thus far been revealed.\n\nHe’s already wrapped on his next film, in which he’s taking an acting role only. That’s the movie Mayday, that he’s been filming opposite Ryan Reynolds. That particular production is directed by the Game Night team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein. No release date has thus far been announced for that, and we’re assuming it’ll be heading to the Apple TV+ service.\n\nNo plot details have been announced for The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde either. It does bring back to mind when Kenneth Branagh went to America to direct his second movie, the hugely underrated Dead Again, that’s still worth digging out.\n\nWhen we hear more about the plot or release details of The Last Disturbance Of Madeline Hynde, we’ll keep you posted. In the meantime, Kenneth Branagh has got to get things filmed, as he’s back on stage later this year in New York, in a new production of King Lear. He’s set to co-direct that as well.\n\nBusy times, then. We await further details on this assortment of projects over the coming months."
