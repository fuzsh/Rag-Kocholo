        "text": "As a central figure of the cinematic Shakespeare renaissance of the 1990s, Kenneth Branagh stands as the most recognizable popular artist associated with contemporary Bard-on-Film endeavors. According to Trevor Nunn, \"It has become possible for many people to think in terms of filming Shakespeare almost entirely because of the achievement of Kenneth Branagh\" (17). For others, Branagh is branded as a bombastic, precocious adaptor of Shakespeare whose hubris is at the core of his middle-brow oeuvre. Regardless, Branagh's four Shakespeare films have permeated popular culture, from cineplexes to classrooms. To fully comprehend the position of Shakespeare within popular culture, it is essential to consider the contributions of Branagh as film director. But to grasp his cinema—and his relationship to Shakespeare—we must also look further than \"Dirty Harry\" and the buffoonish Benedick and explore his lesser known, non-Bardic films.\n\nIn Crowl's accessible and lucid approach, Branagh's films—both Shakespearean and others—are presented as compelling commentaries on the role of the artist, theatre practitioner, and filmmaker at the turn of the twenty-first century. The author positions his analysis by recognizing the influence of classic Hollywood film upon Branagh's work, specifically the conscious employment of cinematic genres. Crowl further elaborates on the notion of the construction of community (both in artistic practice and dramatic theme) as previously detailed by scholars Douglas Lanier and Courtney Lehmann.\n\nFollowing a short overview of Branagh's biography and theatre, film, and television work, Crowl devotes a chapter to each film. Through his analysis he recognizes that Branagh's work can be divided into two distinct groups. Branagh's personal films, such as Henry V (1989), Peter's Friends (1992), A Midwinter's Tale (1995), and Love's Labour's Lost (2000), are characterized by sharing a \"company ethos in substance and style,\" with a focus on \"the group experience [rather] than on the individual\" (12). Branagh's other films, Dead Again (1991), Much Ado About Nothing (1993), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1994), and Hamlet (1996), \"expand into wider landscapes and, while still tied to the communal experience, they open up avenues for more idiosyncratic personal exploration\" (13). The work concludes with an engaging interview with Branagh conducted by the author in 2005.\n\nTo appreciate his cinema, one must recognize that \"Branagh isn't interested in repeating himself or in making tasteful, restrained 'British' films. He's in love with American movies and the men who made them\" (39). As a working-class Belfast boy transplanted to Reading at age ten, Branagh was nourished on a steady feast of Welles and Hitchcock rather than Shakespeare. He admits that \"my cinematic vocabulary was established in [Hitchcock's Rebecca and Spellbound] and to this day when I direct Shakespeare in the theatre, many of the references I give are to these movies\" (51). Through this approach, Branagh's films emerge as hybrids of Shakespearean notions combined with trademarks of Hollywood genres. Henry V is viewed as a post–Vietnam War / post-Falklands film concerning \"homecoming,\" while Much Ado About Nothing reflects Hepburn-Tracy comedies, and Hamlet serves as a David Lean / Richard Attenborough \"intelligent\" epic. Through comparative approaches within the chapters, Crowl consolidates Branagh's cinematic process and aesthetic, characterizing it by such elements as \"rehearsal periods before shooting, actor-centered production decisions, bold camera moves, long takes, and rich, romantic, or pop film scores . . . and [a] stunning opening scene or shot meant to immediately grab and provoke [the] viewer's attention\" (70).\n\nAlthough Branagh's Hamlet \"is the most ambitious and audacious Shakespeare film ever made\" (129), it is Much Ado About Nothing that exemplifies his cinematic and artistic vision. With a soaring score, bold cinematography, Hollywood performers, and recognition of the screwball-comedy genre, Branagh's Much Ado serves to \"boldly announce the arrival of a fresh approach to translating Shakespeare into the language of popular film\" (77), while also heralding \"Shakespeare-on-film's liberation from the high modernist aesthetic and its art-house audience\" (78). Crowl concludes..."
