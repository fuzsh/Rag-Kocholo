        "text": "If you know the films of Sir Kenneth Branagh there is something familiar about Cinderella's ballroom dance scene, when the Prince swirls her round in a glow of colour and light, all captured in bold, sweeping camera movements.\n\nBranagh used a similar visual style in his big-budget 1994 film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, in which he also starred as the overambitious scientist.\n\nThat film performed poorly at the US box office and marked a period in the relative wilderness for the hitherto golden boy of British theatre and film.\n\nThe experience may also explain Branagh's return to form as a first-league Hollywood director 21 years later, with his live-action Cinderella now a major box office hit.\n\nHe was always on sure ground with critically acclaimed cinematic treatments of classic Shakespeare and more recently opera such as The Magic Flute (2006).\n\nTransferring that depth to mass-market family entertainment has been key to his breakthrough, starting with Thor in 2011.\n\nBranagh went out to LA to pitch to direct Thor, the Marvel film that transformed the fortunes of the comic-book-based studio.\n\nNot an obvious choice, he convinced them to let him inject Shakespearean grandeur and acting into Thor's Norse mythological world.\n\nLike an Elizabethan actor-manager he draws on an evolving \"company\" of great and diverse stage actors (Anthony Hopkins as Odin in Thor, Derek Jacobi as the ageing King and Nonso Alozie in Cinderella) prepared to put in deep preparation.\n\nHe has compared Tom Hiddleston's Loki in the Thor films with Cate Blanchett's femme-fatale stepmother.\n\nBranagh is clearly a master, not the slave, of the computer-generated imagery (CGI) effects demanded of both superheroes and Cinderella's impressive transformations.\n\nIt is a lesson learnt perhaps from the CGI-mad disaster of Wild, Wild West (1999), in which he played the scenery-chewing villain.\n\nCrucially, Branagh is hungry for mainstream success, making a straight action film Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014) to prove it.\n\nAs he told The Scotsman, external recently: \"I wanted the chance to do something in a form where more people would see it.\"\n\nCinderella, shot on real film stock, looks sumptuous, but Branagh has had to defend it against accusations from some critics that the movie is too old-fashioned and does not do enough to challenge the passive endurance of abuse in the traditional story.\n\nAt the Berlin Festival premiere of the film he said Cinderella has \"a strength of character, external that is sort of a form of non-violent resistance\".\n\nDisagreement with Disney over the darker version conceived by the original signed director Mark Romanek is reported to be the reason the American left, external the project in 2013.\n\nDisney's Maleficent (2014), a live-action retelling of the 1959 Sleeping Beauty from the wicked fairy's point of view, suggested a desire to play with darkness, though many critics felt it fell short of its promise.\n\nHowever, Maleficent did well with audiences and, in the light of Cinderella's similar success, Branagh's upbeat approach appears to be the template for the live-action remake projects ahead.\n\nRival Universal studios is thought to be going back to its own classic catalogue for remakes. It has had mixed success with dark fairytale reboots.\n\nSnow White and the Huntsman (2012) fared much better than Hansel and Gretel: Witchhunters (2013) or Jack The Giant Slayer (2013).\n\nUniversal turns out to have been ahead of the game though, with its remake of The Mummy (1999).\n\nNow it is thought that Dracula and Frankenstein may well be brought back to life.\n\nIn a way, it is all thanks to Branagh, who has proved that with courage as a superpower and a little Disney magic anyone can be transformed into Hollywood royalty."
