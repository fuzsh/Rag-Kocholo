        "text": "After a screening of Ken's own Much Ado About Nothing at the Queen's Film Theatre, the director and star took part in an extensive Q&A session, hosted by Adrian Wootton, CEO of Film London and the British Film Commission. Ken spoke to the young audience present for an hour discussing his career and the influence Shakespeare has had on him, hoping to inspire a new generation of passionate filmmakers and Shakespeare fans.\n\nYou can watch highlights of Ken's Q&A session in the video above.\n\nAfter our young people focused event, Ken later took part in a second event, in which a screening of another of his Shakespeare films (Henry V) was screened for the public and followed by another Q&A session - this one broadcast live by Film London to multiple cinemas around the country - further spreading the inspiring words of one of film's most passionate Shakespeare enthusiasts.\n\nOur wide-reaching Shakespeare 400 celebrations are a fantastic means of engaging young people with the Bard's classic texts in new and dynamic ways, and we're thrilled that Ken was able to take part and directly reach out and inspire so many.\n\nAs part of Shakespeare 400, we're also running a new programme to stimulate filmmaking in the classroom, and to help teachers engage pupils with Shakespeare's texts through practical filmmaking. Visit our Shakespeare page now for further details on this and for a whole host of Shakespeare-related articles, films and resources to help you celebrate Shakespeare 400 in your club or school."
