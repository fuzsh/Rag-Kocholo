An international co-production between France and the United Kingdom, it was produced by Idéale Audience and in association with UK's Peter Moores Foundation.\n\nInterpretation\n\n[edit]\n\nAs part of the 250th anniversary celebration of Mozart's birthday, a new film version of The Magic Flute, set during World War I, was made, directed by Kenneth Branagh, with a translation by Stephen Fry.[1] The film was presented at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2006, at the Venice Film Festival on 8 September of that year, and released in Switzerland on 5 April 2007.\n\nThe film, with a soundtrack performed by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe conducted by James Conlon, is the first motion picture version of the opera specifically intended for cinemas. Ingmar Bergman's 1975 film version was made for Swedish television and only later released to theatres. Branagh's version was shot in Super 35 and released in anamorphic widescreen, while Bergman's was filmed in Academy ratio for television sets of the 1970s. The story, which has been updated to a World War I setting, follows the structure of the original opera libretto. Tamino is sent by the Queen of the Night to rescue her daughter Pamina after Sarastro has apparently kidnapped her. His sidekick is Papageno, a man who uses underground pigeons to check for poison gas. Sarastro, in charge of a field hospital, is Pamina's father.\n\nA DVD of the film was released in France in August 2007 with a bonus soundtrack CD (lasting around 79 minutes) and a \"Making of\" featurette (50 minutes).[2] The film has also been released on DVD in the Netherlands (in a three-disc set), Finland, Argentina, and Japan.\n\nRevolver Entertainment gave the film a theatrical release in the United States in June 2013, seven years after its premiere in Europe.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBranagh consulted with Conlon over casting choices. René Pape, who portrayed Sarastro in several stage productions, is the best-known singer among the ensemble.[3]\n\nJoseph Kaiser as Tamino\n\nBenjamin Jay Davis as Papageno\n\nAmy Carson as Pamina\n\nRené Pape as Sarastro\n\nLyubov Petrova as Queen of the Night\n\nTom Randle as Monostatos\n\nSilvia Moi as Papagena\n\nLiz Smith as Old Papagena\n\nTeuta Koco, Louise Callinan, Kim-Marie Woodhouse as The Three Ladies\n\nWilliam Dutton, Luke Lampard and Jamie Manton as The Three Boys\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was made on an estimated budget of $27 million.[1] On 11 June 2013, seven years after its premiere, the film was finally released on a Region 1 DVD in the United States.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nVariety's Derek Elley gave the film a mixed review.[4] Total Film mistakenly blamed Mozart for the \"silliness of the story\".[5]\n\nIn 2009, three years after the release of the film, Roger Lanser received a Cinematographer of the Year Award from the Australian Cinematographers Society for his work on The Magic Flute.[6]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
