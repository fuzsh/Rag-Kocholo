        "text": "Rewatched this Metropolitan Opera production before lending it to someone to whom I suggested, after seeing Amadeus (1984) on the weekend, that this might be a better entry point to Mozart than his Requiem.\n\nJulie Taymor’s 2006 production is Mozart-lite but, as you would expect from the director of the Broadway production of The Lion King (1997), the production is spectacular. The quick insert of the dad who has to come down to the rail at the edge of the orchestra pit to retrieve his two small children who have crept down for a closer look speaks volumes about why the company has revived it several times for end of year holiday performances. You can also see the influence of Taymor’s time in…\n\nThis Julie Taymor-directed, English-language production of (part of) Mozart’s famous opera was lent to me by the great Mike Kennedy after we saw Amadeus and I expressed curiosity in Mozart’s work, with which I am only familiar in broad strokes. Thanks Mike! I promise that we’ll watch the Bruce La Bruce movie you lent us soon!\n\nAs for the Met opera itself: gorgeously designed. Taymor seems to intimately understand the natural suspension of disbelief that comes with theatre and so fills her production with analogue spectacle that dazzles all the more for its visible construction. There is something living within even the most bizarre creatures, a spontaneity that transcends the calculation and organisation of this huge expensive looking theatrical space.…\n\nBelieve the hype!\n\nNathan Gunn as Papageno is a tremendous all-rounder, complementing his vocal performance with comedy, dance, and athleticism that makes almost every opera performance I've ever seen seem lifeless in comparison. Erika Miklosa's Queen of the Night blows the house down, just as much with her face and physicality as with her voice. Matthew Polenzani's Tamino and Ying Huang's Pamina are pretty good — those are tougher roles to get an audience to believe in, although they don't have to be quite this stiff. I did find the stiffness effective in the silent-treatment scene, at least, when they are both suffering separately. René Pape always strikes me as slightly smug anyway, which is actually perfect for Sarastro. I'm…"
