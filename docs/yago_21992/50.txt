Many movie lovers have seen Ingmar Bergman’s magical 1975 version of “The Magic Flute.” But few have had a chance to check out Kenneth Branagh‘s 2006 take on the most popular Mozart opera. Well, that one is coming to theaters for the first time in the U.S. on June 9th. Emerging Networks will present the film with a libretto adapted by Stephen Fry and music arranged and conducted by James Conlon in 150 theaters on Sunday June 9th and Tuesday June 11th.

Actor-director Branagh’s film transplants Mozart’s 1791 fantasy opera to the eve of the First World War, starring Joseph Kaiser as Tamino and Amy Carson as the daughter of the Queen of the Night.

Select theaters will also get a live Q-and-A session with Branagh via webcast from London after the film’s Sunday screening. (Individual theaters and show times here.)

Branagh starred as Sir Laurence Olivier in “My Week with Marilyn,” which earned him a supporting actor Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor and marked his fifth career nod, making him one of the first to receive five nominations and after directing “Thor,” Branagh takes on the newest installment of Tom Clancy’s “Jack Ryan” franchise for Paramount, in which he will co-star alongside Chris Pine and Keira Knightley. Branagh is also currently in pre-production to direct a live-action version of Disney’s “Cinderella,” starring Lily James in the title role and “Game of Thrones” star Richard Madden as the Prince.

“The Magic Flute” is a Revolver Entertainment release, a French-English co-production between Idéale Audience and The Peter Moores Foundation, produced by Pierre-Olivier Bardet and Simon Moseley.
