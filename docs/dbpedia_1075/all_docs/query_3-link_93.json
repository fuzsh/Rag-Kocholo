He tells us why they’re making the program available.\n\nhttp://kiwaradio.com/files/ISU_NCC1.mp3\n\nHe says at this point the program is not available anywhere else in the state.\n\nhttp://kiwaradio.com/files/ISU_NCC2.mp3\n\nHe says the Regents Resource Center was designed to help northwest Iowans be more connected with the state universities.\n\nhttp://kiwaradio.com/files/ISU_NCC3.mp3\n\nIf you’d like to hear more about the program, you can contact Northwest Iowa Community College or Western Iowa Tech."
