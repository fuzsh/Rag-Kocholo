        "text": "View an album of images from the awards banquet\n\nAt the Celebration of Ministry awards banquet, 39 people from the School for Lay Ministry were awarded for their 2017 graduation.\n\nFrom Cornell College where Lynn Calvert is the dean, the graduates were: Margaret Adams, Uyntha Duncan, Patty Ferrel, Steven Grace, Jessica Lake, Eileen McPherson, Sue Ney, Jolyn Richards, Kristine Rodney, Steve Schmudde Harry Stimson, Deb Streff, and Christine Werling-Witkoske.\n\nFrom Morningside College, the graduates were: Miles Brown, Kelsey Callens, Amanda Gerodias, Mary Green-Warnstadt, and LeAnn Robine.\n\nFrom Simpson College where John Rothlisberger is the Dean were: Bruce Baker, Mary Baker, Kris Baumgart, Martha Chancellor, Linda Datwyler, Bill Howell, Katherine Howell, Charity Johnson, Kathy Kirby, Kathi Mitchell, Billy Nuzum, Sandy Oswald, Mary Patterson, Karla Wheeler.\n\nAnd from the Simpson College Hispanic Class where Rev. Alejandro Alfara-Santiz is the Dean were: Norma Cabezas, Eileen McPherson, Alfredo Mendoza, Rosa Mendoza, Martha Olague, J. Omar Paz, Maria Roldan.\n\nThe School for Lay Ministry (SLM) program was created some years ago as a program to facilitate the growth of Iowa United Methodist Churches and their Christian ministry by providing an alternative, supplemental source of educated leadership to local congregations and communities. The SLM identifies, trains\n\nand nurtures lay persons who meet entrance criteria and who have the desire to serve in, through and beyond the church in various ministries.\n\nSome of the goals of the SLM are to provide trained and motivated laity to contribute to the fulfillment of the mission of the Annual Conference to prepare leaders of the church for the transformation of the world; lay persons to serve with ordained clergy in complementary ministries of various kinds; spiritually nurturing experiences for persons wishing to further their faith pilgrimage and explore their Christian vocation; and lay leadership to assist with programs and ministries pursuing Christ’s mission.\n\nTwelve class sessions are designed to provide a comprehensive background and training for students. These classes are taught by recognized leaders who give the knowledge and background needed to serve in many fields. The topics for the 12 sessions during the three years are:\n\nIntroduction to Lay Ministry & Spirituality\n\nWorship\n\nCare & Nurturing\n\nProclamation & Sharing the Faith\n\nStewardship, Christian Ethics & Conflict\n\nDeveloping Theological Perspectives\n\nNurturing through Christian Education\n\nMission & Social Concerns\n\nChurch History\n\nChurch Leadership, Doctrine & Polity\n\nMethods of Biblical Interpretation\n\nStrategizing for Church Growth\n\nA Spanish speaking class is also offered at the Simpson location.\n\nSome of the ways graduates of the SLM are serving with ordained clergy in Iowa include ministering with local churches in leadership capacities, volunteer management, Christian education, care-giving ministries, program staff positions, visitation ministries, youth programming and District ministries and\n\nmission.\n\nBeje Clark Award\n\nThe Beje Clark Award was bestowed upon Rev. Lee A. Schott. Rev. Schott, as pastor of Women at the Well United Methodist Church at the Women’s Correctional Institution (prison) in Mitchellville, ministers to the inmates in supportive and compassionate care to help restore these women to wholeness and community. Many of the women are mothers separated from their children, have drug addictions, and mental illness. To all she offers grace and love, enabling them to find healing and hope during the most stressful times of their lives. In addition, she takes her ministry beyond the prison walls to challenge the injustices many of these women are facing and to educate and challenge United Methodist Churches to join in the search for justice for these women, by changing their attitudes about the women—from criminals to victims and children of God.\n\nRev. Lee Schott during the past year has taken the following actions beyond the prison to encourage the church to join her in the work of restorative justice:\n\nOrganized and led two “Right Next Door” Conferences at Aldersgate UMC in Urbandale and Collegiate UMC Ames to help local church pastors and laity learn to see the women of her church as brothers and sisters in Christ, understand their needs, and help restore them to their communities.\n\nOrganized and led a conversation on Mental Illness and Caring for the Mentally Ill at Immanuel UMC in Des Moines. A large majority of the women at Mitchellville prison had mental illness and had not been getting care before they went to prison.\n\nAdvocated on behalf of the women at the state legislature, sharing her experience and reminding legislators of the needs of these women.\n\nPreached at other United Methodist Churches and shared the need for restorative justice for the women she pastors and all the women in the prison. Her passionate preaching encourages others to reach out in love and seek justice for the women."
