        "text": "“With great power comes great responsibility.” That adage from the Spiderman comics can find its origin back to at least the Book of Luke: “To whom much is given, much will be required.” Whatever the source, it’s a principle that needs immediate application within our country.\n\nWe face challenges at home and abroad. At the end of this year, existing surveillance authorities involving domestic and international communication will expire. Also expiring at the end of the year is the ability to sell or renew flood insurance or make payments on claims. Authorization of the Federal Aviation Administration also stops in less than three months.\n\nInternationally, Russia continues to hold onto land seized from Ukraine. Hamas has indiscriminately slaughtered Americans, Israelis, and others. China continues to conduct provocative actions directed toward its neighbors. Coups have occurred across Africa, and refugees are fleeing unrest in Africa, Europe, and South America.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has not approved a budget for the next fiscal year. That’s actually the norm. In the past 50 years, the federal government has passed appropriations bills on time only four times, the last in 1997. Congress was able to pass a temporary spending bill that lasts only 47 days, literally with hours to spare.\n\nThe practical effect of that is increased costs since government agencies can’t contract beyond that 47 days. The political impact was that the Speaker of the House was removed from his position.\n\nHaving failed to get enough votes to pass other ways of keeping the government open, the Speaker allowed a measure that got support from the other party. That apparently was an unpardonable sin. Meanwhile, serial liar George Santos remains in the House and gold ingot collector/cash collector Robert Menendez remains in the Senate.\n\nThe Constitution gives the U.S. Senate authority to provide advice and consent to officers of the executive branch, to include ambassadors. The Senate rules empower one senator to hold up those appointments. They don’t have to publicly disclose who is holding or why. Senators have increasingly used that power.\n\nOne senator has held up the appointments of over 300 senior military officers for months. It would take the Senate 31 days if they 24 hours a day, seven days a week to approve them individually. If applied to all appointments, the Senate would be unable to operate.\n\nOther senators have held up ambassadorial appointments having nothing to do with the qualification of the nominee. This has resulted in the United States not having an ambassador in Oman even though she was unanimously approved by committee. The nominee for ambassador to Kuwait and the State Department director for Counterterrorism were both nominated in 2022, renominated in 2023 and passed committee in April of this year but await confirmation.\n\nIt is difficult to effectively implement policy, establish the relationships needed for success, and build the teams to provide effective collaboration when individuals or small groups are preventing that. If the policies, relationships, and collaboration don’t work, those obstructing the process then blame the executive branch.\n\nThe examples of individuals or small groups above is like the Polish Commonwealth’s practice of the liberum veto. This allowed an individual member of Poland’s legislature to stop any legislation. Internal chaos and aggressive neighbors set the conditions for Poland ceasing to exist by the 1790’s.\n\nOur situation is not that dire. With very narrow partisan control of the two chambers of Congress, neither side will get most of what they want. You should be skeptical of anyone who says otherwise. Winston Churchill told an American audience in 1943 that “the price of greatness is responsibility.” We don’t need comic book heroes to be great. We need people in positions of authority to take responsibility.\n\nA Sioux City resident, Steve Warnstadt is government affairs coordinator for Western Iowa Tech Community College. He is a former Democratic state senator and retired Army National Guard brigadier general. He and his wife, Mary, are the parents of one son and one daughter."
