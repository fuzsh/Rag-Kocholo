        "text": "Alessandra Mata\n\nAdvocate\n\nAlessandra is an amazing human with a story to share.\n\nAlex Watters\n\nAdvocate\n\nAfter graduating 2004, Alex Watters was excited to begin the next stage of his life by attending Morningside University. However, in September 2004, Watters had an accident that fractured his C5 vertebrae, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. After six months of rehab at Craig Hospital, he was able to return to Morningside University and complete his degree. He then went on to Creighton University, where he earned his Masters's in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution. Following that, he interned in Washington DC, at the US Department of Education in conjunction with the American Association of People with Disabilities. After returning to Iowa, Alex went on to work for various campaigns before ultimately running for office himself. Alex serves as a city council member for Sioux City, Iowa, and returned to work for Morningside University in 2013. He is currently the Director of Alumni Engagement for Morningside and continues to be an advocate for four people with disabilities.\n\nRevathi Vongsiprasom\n\nDean of Inclusion\n\nRevathi is a first-generation American. In 2020, Revathi became one of the youngest deans in the nation when she was appointed Associate Dean of Inclusion at Western Iowa Tech Community College; the first of this position at any Iowa Community College. She also serves as the only immigration attorney in Sioux City, Iowa. As a child of immigrants who came to the US in search of better opportunities for their families, Revathi assists her clients in achieving their piece of the American Dream. Revathi believes we are a reflection of our ascribed and chosen communities, and these experiences continue to shape our world today."
