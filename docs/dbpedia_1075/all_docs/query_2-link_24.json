        "text": "DES MOINES, IA - Today, Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart announced his endorsement of Pete Buttigieg for president.\n\nâI am proud to endorse Pete Buttigieg for president,â said Mayor Hart. âWhen Pete was elected mayor in 2011, a national magazine called South Bend one of Americaâs âdying cities.â Pete brought his community together to transform their city for the 21st century. Weâre working to do the same in Waterloo. Pete is running to bring the same transformative approach he brought to his city to our countryâand Iâm proud to stand alongside him in that effort. As our nation moves forward, we cannot continue to ignore communities like ours, and I know that Pete wonât forget places like Waterloo because he comes from one.â\n\nâIn his time as the mayor of Waterloo, Mayor Hart has been a bridge builder ââ uniting the city around solutions to the challenges theyâve been facing for decades, said Buttigieg. âI am honored to have Mayor Hartâs support and his endorsement. I look forward to Mayor Hart joining me on the campaign trail across Iowa in the coming weeks.â\n\nHart made history in 2015 when he was elected as the first African American mayor of Waterloo. He previously served for eight years on the city council and is a Waterloo native. In September, Hart introduced Pete in Waterloo on his first all-access bus tour of Iowa. Despite a rainstorm, Pete drew the largest crowd of any candidate in Waterloo this caucus cycle.\n\nHart joins Mayor Matt Bemrich of Fort Dodge, Mayors Pro-Tem Paul Adams of Mason City and Mitch Gross of Coralville, Congressman Dave Loebsack State Representatives Kristin Sunde and Brian Meyer, State Senators Tony Bisignano and Bill Dotzler, former State Representative Deb Berry, and over 115 other Democratic elected officials and activists in Iowa backing Pete for president.\n\nThe endorsement comes as Pete continues his 22nd trip to Iowa this year. Iowans continue to show up in record numbers to hear Pete speak in every corner of the state. This caucus cycle he has drawn the largest crowds of any candidate in Algona, Ankeny, Atlantic, Boone, Burlington, Centerville, Charles City, Creston, Davenport, Decorah, Denison, Des Moines, Dubuque, Elkader, Fort Dodge, Fort Madison, Indianola, Iowa Falls, Keokuk, Knoxville, Maquoketa, Mason City, Mount Vernon, Newton, Ottumwa, Perry, Shenandoah, Spencer, Tipton, Washington, Waterloo, Webster City, West Des Moines and Winterset.\n\n###\n\nPete for America\n\nFor Immediate Release:\n\nJanuary 9, 2020\n\nContact:\n\nBen Halle\n\nSean Manning\n\nCongressman Dave Loebsack endorses Pete Buttigieg for President\n\nLoebsack is the longest actively serving Democratic Member of Congress in Iowa\n\nDES MOINES, IA ââ Today, seven-term Congressman Dave Loebsack (IA-02) announced his endorsement of Pete Buttigieg for president.\n\n\"I'm proud to announce that I'm endorsing Pete Buttigieg to be the next president of the United States,â said Congressman Dave Loebsack. âPete offers a new kind of leadership that we desperately need ââ he's a midwestern mayor, a veteran, and is from a new generation. Iowans and our country face great challenges like climate change, increasing health care costs, and an economy that isn't working for the majority of Americans. They can't be solved with the same political warfare that is on display in Washington. Pete is the candidate that can heal our divides, restore decency to the presidency, and bring this country together. When I introduced Pete to a crowd of more than 1,000 Iowans in Mount Vernon in December, it was clear that his campaign is already inspiring a sense of hope and optimism. With Pete in the Oval Office, I believe our nation will unite and move forward together.\"\n\nâAs an educator and a public servant, Dave Loebsack has dedicated his lifeâs work to creating opportunities and making life better for Iowans. Congressman Loebsack has never let the partisan fighting in Washington get in the way of delivering on the priorities of his constituents,â said Buttigieg. âI am honored to have Congressman Loebsackâs endorsement, and I look forward to him joining me on the trail to work together to heal the deep divisions in this country while also addressing the most urgent issues facing us.â\n\nLoebsack represents Iowaâs crucial second congressional district, which includes much of the Eastern and Southern Iowa ââ including Iowa City. Despite Donald Trump winning the 2nd congressional district in 2016, Congressman Loebsack won reelection.\n\nThis evening Loebsack will introduce Pete at his town hall in Des Moines. In December, he also introduced Pete at a town hall in Mount Vernon to a crowd of over 1,000. The town hall was the largest event held by a single candidate in Linn County this caucus cycle.\n\nLoebsack is serving his seventh term in the House of Representatives and sits on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Rural Caucus. Since being elected by the Second District, Loebsack has been a relentless advocate for Iowans, addressing critical issues that are facing hard-working, Iowa families.\n\nCongressman Dave Loebsack grew up in poverty and was raised by a single parent in Sioux City, where he attended East High School. After graduation, Loebsack attended Iowa State University, where he earned a Bachelorâs and a Masterâs Degree. Loebsack then went on to earn a PhD from the University of California, Davis before moving back to Iowa and becoming a teacher at Cornell College in Mt. Vernon.\n\nLoebsack joins State Representatives Kristin Sunde and Brian Meyer, State Senators Tony Bisignano and Bill Dotzler, former State Rep. Deb Berry, and over 115 other Democratic elected officials and activists in Iowa backing Pete for president.\n\nThe endorsement comes as Pete makes his 22nd trip to Iowa this year.

His healthcare plan is key for me making my decision. Offering great, affordable plans to the public and if someone wants to keep their private or union mandated insurance, theyâre allowed to. I always ask people âHow many times in your life have you known the American people to enjoy being forced into a government ran program?â The simple answer is never.â\n\nJessica Reynolds, Story County Attorney:\n\nâItâs time for a new generation of leadership in Washington.

His practical local government experience will benefit our entire nation.â\n\nMyrt Bowers, 2019 Linn County Democrats Hall of Fame inductee:\n\nâAt a time of great division in our country where urgent challenges ââ both at home and abroad ââ wait on our doorstep, we need a president with the vision and values to unite us to find solutions. Pete Buttigieg will be that president.â\n\nLinda Murken, Story County Supervisor:\n\nâAs a mayor, Pete has been there when tough decisions needed to be made - not as one member of many in a legislature voting on a bill, but as the one to whom problems come for final decisions. His leadership experience in local government and the military will serve him well as our President. He has the maturity and steadiness needed to lead us in restoring civility and rationality to lead our country.â\n\nDennis Cole, former Chair of Page County Democrats:\n\nâPete Buttigieg has the intelligence and experience to be President on Day One.

He knows the critical challenges and opportunities facing our nation and he articulately communicates new ideas and solutions we need to get our country back on track .Heâs proven these abilities time and time again which is why he is so widely respected. During this very scary time in the U.S., we need Pete to take on and defeat Trump.â\n\nTim Bottaro, former Chair of Woodbury County Democrats:\n\nâWe need a leader who can not only defeat Trump but also to lead us out of this tumultuous moment and into a new and more unified era. Now more than ever, I believe that leader is Pete Buttigieg.â\n\nReverend Richard Hendricks, Davenport, IA:\n\nâPete Buttigieg is the ideal candidate to take us from these dark times into a new era of civility combined with bold ideas to make our democracy work for everyone.

Last week, a dozen Democratic leaders endorsed Pete, including Polk County Supervisor Matt McCoy and Jean Lloyd-Jones, the first woman ever nominated by a major party to the U.S. Senate in Iowa. And earlier this week, the campaign announced that nearly 60 mayors across the country endorsed Pete.\n\nBelow are the Iowa leaders that announced their endorsement of Pete:\n\nRyan Arndorfer, Mayor, Britt, IA\n\nLaura Hubka, Chair of Howard County Democrats\n\nRegenia Bailey, former Mayor of Iowa City, former Iowa City City Council Member, Founding Executive of Iowa Womenâs Foundation\n\nJohn Hale, former Fort Dodge City Council Member and former Volunteer President AARP Iowa\n\nTerri Hale, board of directors for One Iowa\n\nRich Eychaner, business owner, former commissioner on the Iowa Civil Rights Commission, co-founder of Iowa Safe Schools and the Iowa Pride Network\n\nGeorge Appleby, retired attorney, Long-time Democratic activist, Des Moines City Attorney, Assistant County Attorney.\n\nMary Riche, social worker and member of the Iowa Chapter of National Social Workers Ethics Committee\n\nLaura Sands, former Liaison for Health, Education and Workforce for US Senator Tom Harkin, Polk County\n\nMarilyn Staples, former President of the League of Women Voters of Des Moines, former Board Member of Grandview College, Iowa Womenâs Hall of Fame Member\n\nSheila Burton, Precinct captain for Obama in 2008 and 2012, precinct captain for Hillary Clinton\n\nCatherine Dietz-Kilen, attorney and Board Member of Planned Parenthood affiliate in Iowa and The Interfaith Alliance of Iowa\n\nThe endorsements show increasing energy behind the Pete for America campaign as they ramp up organizing efforts. On Labor Day, Pete opened the campaignâs first two field offices in Cedar Rapids and Iowa City ââ with over 1,100 people attending. These field office openings are part of an effort to open 20 field offices in the 20 days leading up to the Polk County Steak Fry. Additionally, the campaign announced that they have nearly 100 staff on the ground in Iowa alone. After the Steak Fry, Pete will head out on a four-day, open-press bus tour across central and eastern Iowa.\n\nThis trip marks Peteâs ninth trip to the state since the beginning of July. Each trip has demonstrated an undeniable enthusiasm for Peteâs campaign in Iowa. Pete was the only candidate who received a standing ovation at the Progress Iowa Corn Feed. At the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding, Pete received âthe loudest applause before, during and after he went on stage.â Iowa Starting Line called Peteâs State Fair visit âone of the most successful of the field,â he took the stage at the Soapbox to chants of âwe want Pete,â and received the second most votes in WHOâs Cast Your Kernel poll. During his seven-stop swing through southeast Iowa, Pete attracted over 2,300 people to his events with âthe drawing power of a rock and roll star.â\n\nRyan Arndorfer, Mayor, Britt, Iowa:\n\nâCongressional politicians tend to focus on ideologies and theories, while civic leaders are more pragmatic. Mayors, like Pete, are practical problem solvers. The paralysis and inaction in federal government simply isnât acceptable in city government. Potholes have to be filled, trains have to run, and our kids need clean drinking water and safe places to play. Mayor Pete understands reaching outcomes on behalf of those he represents is leadership. His leadership in South Bend has been inspiring: rebuilding a dying industrial district, growing the cityâs population, raising household incomes, and creating a municipal identification card for immigrant residents. As a fellow millennial, Iâve witnessed what happens when leaders in a younger generation step forward to lead. And, as a fellow Midwestern mayor, I recognize how Pete Buttigieg is uniquely qualified to move our country forward. He possesses the ability to end partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill while casting a positive vision for our countryâs future.â\n\nLaura Hubka, Chair of the Howard County Democrats, US Navy retired: âWhat brought me to Pete was the fact that he pulls us all together to meet somewhere in the middle. He is listening. Something we haven't been seeing or hearing in politics for a very long time. To me, he brings calm and a sense of security. He is tough, concise and honest.â John Hale, former Fort Dodge City Council Member and former Volunteer President AARP Iowa: \"There is a real urgency to get this nation and world back on track. Americans are tired of gridlock and finger-pointing in D.C., division throughout the nation, and growing turmoil in the world. We need someone in the White House who can inspire, who is respected, who can be trusted, and who can bring people together to accomplish great things. Mayor Pete is that someone.\"\n\nTerri Hale, member of the board of directors for One Iowa: âWe need the voice of the next generation to help create a better future, and Pete has the intelligence, eloquence and decency to bring people from all generations together to get things done. He has the composure and intelligence to keep up with the rapid fire pace of change in our world today. He is a Midwestern, middle-class mayor and war veteran from a new generation. Pete brings a sense of urgency and bold, fresh plans to address the critical problems we are facing. Pete is someone we can be proud to call president.â\n\nRich Eychaner, businessman and former commissioner on the Iowa Civil Rights Commission: âIâm enthusiastically supporting Mayor Pete Buttigieg for president because he brings unique character traits to this election: Maturity; a calmness under pressure; an astute evaluation of issues; unparalleled ability communicating values, ideas and plans; detailed knowledge of international and domestic issues; Midwestern values of civility, hard work and listening; a deep respect for and belief in the citizens of our country; and an optimism that Americaâs best days are still to come. Our country needs Pete Buttigieg as our president and I have every confidence he will secure the nomination and win the election, and serve our nation admirably as our 46th president, repairing much of the damage caused by the current president.â\n\nMary Riche, social worker and member of the Iowa Chapter of National Social Workers Ethics Committee: âI am a feminist. And I will caucus for Pete. Proudly. Enthusiastically. With passion for his values that I share. With confidence in his vision of the future of this country. And... with a big ole grin from ear to ear because I believe he is tapping into and capturing a spirit and energy that will be unstoppable from today through November, 2020.â\n\nGeorge Appleby, retired attorney, Long-time Democratic activist: âMayor Pete is a politician of such intelligence, talent and vitality that as president he will restore the dignity of American institutions and lead us forward to our rightful leadership role in the world.â\n\nMarilyn Staples, former President of the League of Women Voters of Des Moines: âI am impressed by his character, his intellect and his ability to govern.â\n\nSheila Burton, Precinct captain for Obama in 2008 and 2012, precinct captain for Hillary Clinton: âI support Pete Buttigieg because it is time for a generational change. He has a proven ability to govern, articulates solid solutions for the people - and has the experience to restore respect for the United States.â"
