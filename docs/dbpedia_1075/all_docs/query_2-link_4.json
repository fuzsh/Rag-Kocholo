        "text": "During the winter of 1777-78, roughly 12,000 American soldiers, along with 400 women and children, huddled in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Temperature changes, rain and snowfall, and cramped conditions contributed to the spread of diseases that led to the deaths of roughly 2,000 souls. With British troops occupying the nearby capital of Philadelphia, there would have been cause for despair. Instead, the National Park Service writes that the soldiers, while “exhausted and ill-supplied,” were “cautiously optimistic about the future.”\n\nThe previous winter had also been challenging. Faced with cold weather and the end of one-year enlistments, there were doubts about the revolution’s future. In his tract “The Crisis,” Thomas Paine wrote, “Let it be told to the future world, that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country . . . came forth to meet and repulse it.”\n\nI share these stories, among the many that could be told, as we approach Independence Day. The opportunities and freedoms that we have are the result of sacrifices made in the past. It happened because of patriots who understood that with freedom comes responsibility. That there is a common cause among free people, one that understands a purpose greater than oneself. It was reflected in the final words of the Declaration of Independence, where the signers “mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.”\n\nSo, it’s appropriate to celebrate with fireworks on the Fourth of July. The same is true for cookouts, family outings, and music. It’s just as important to remember all that went into our opportunity to engage in these activities.\n\nThere are valid reasons to question our ability to continue this greater purpose. Taking the time to vote is not as challenging as six months of training and enduring the variable weather and disease of Valley Forge. Still, only eight percent of Iowa voters participated in the most recent primary. There are also plenty of examples of leaders putting their personal interests ahead of the people they serve.\n\nYet, it also doesn’t take much to identify examples of service above self. We may just need reminders. America has had voluntary military service for 51 years. After 2001, young Americans willingly took an oath to serve with a high likelihood of seeing combat.\n\nBut we have been seeing other examples closer to home. When tornadoes struck several communities in May, people responded to help those impacted. As I write, people are reaching out to assist those impacted by flooding. Ordinary citizens, non-profit organizations, and government entities are working tirelessly to support fellow citizens.\n\nCountless people are putting their humanity and concern for others first. No one is asking the political affiliation of those affected, nor their religion or other factors that too often become a way for us to identify each other. We need to do more of that. Not just during disasters.\n\nPatriotism isn’t just about willingness to serve in uniform; but it is more than just waving the flag. A greater reflection of patriotism is the love for your fellow citizens and looking out for their well-being so we can be stronger together.\n\nThe army that camped at Valley Forge was diverse ethnically, linguistically, religiously, ideologically, racially, and in gender. Faced with challenges, they became better organized and developed greater cohesion. Many of their differences remained, but they were put aside in order to fight the common threat. We ought to do the same so that future generations enjoy the fruits of freedom that we presently celebrate.\n\nA Sioux City resident, Steve Warnstadt is government affairs coordinator for Western Iowa Tech Community College. He is a former Democratic state senator and retired Army National Guard brigadier general. He and his wife, Mary, are the parents of one son and one daughter."
