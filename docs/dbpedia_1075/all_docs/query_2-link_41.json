        "text": "DES MOINES n A bill soon to be introduced in the Iowa Senate would help members of the armed forces buy or remodel a home.\n\nIt is one of several proposed benefits discussed Wednesday, as pro-veteran groups held their annual lobbying day at the Statehouse.\n\nThe housing bill, sponsored by Sen. Steve Warnstadt, D-Sioux City, would provide matching money to help active-duty service members and their families.\n\n\"We can make home ownership, and improved home ownership, one of the real opportunities and options for service members who have been making so many sacrifices,\" Warnstadt said.\n\nHe said the matching money would be available up to $5,000, though he added that the amount may change before he offers the bill. The money would come from existing state housing programs.\n\nThe idea has the support of Sen. Jeff Angelo, R-Creston, co-chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, where the bill initially will be considered.\n\n\"It certainly is appropriate in these times of conflict,\" he said, referring to the high number of Iowans on active duty in the military.\n\nVeterans were all over the Statehouse Wednesday, meeting with legislators and reporters to argue that Iowa spends too little on benefits for veterans and current military personnel.\n\n\"The state of Wisconsin has â€¦ so many state benefits that they have a manual. The state of Iowa could put our benefits on about a half a sheet of paper,\" said Brett McLain, Story County director of veterans affairs.\n\nHe said Iowa should offer educational assistance and other training opportunities to encourage veterans to live in the state.\n\nAmong the other items requested were money for a state veterans cemetery and veterans' retirement homes.\n\nWarnstadt said his proposal is an inexpensive, but valuable, way for Iowa to improve its benefits.\n\n\"We have deployed several thousands of Iowans overseas and one of the things we would like to do is provide an adequate thank you, not just for the service members, but for the family members of those service members who have made some of those sacrifices,\" he said.\n\nDan Gearino can be reached at 515-243-0138.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
