Typically, workers who voluntarily leave their jobs aren’t eligible for jobless benefits.\n\nSen. Steve Warnstadt, D-Sioux City, said often a spouse who is left behind during a deployment finds it difficult to keep a job and care for a family, and frequently must move closer to relatives for help.\n\nOpponent argued the measure was anti-business because the fund from which jobless benefits are paid is financed by a tax on businesses based on their employment history.\n\nCulver has indicated he supports the measures and likely will sign it.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
