        "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa, March 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AT&T* today unveiled its Iowa wireless network investment plans for 2010, which include the addition of more than 10 new cell sites and the upgrade of nearly 160 additional cell sites to 3G throughout the state.\n\nThe planned wireless network enhancement strategy is part of AT&T's 2010 wireline and wireless capital investment, which is expected to be in the $18 billion to $19 billion range companywide, an increase of between 5 and 10 percent over 2009. This planned amount also includes an increase of about $2 billion in capital expenditures for wireless and backhaul related to AT&T's wireless network. This planned level of investment is framed by the expectation that regulatory and legislative decisions relating to the telecom sector will continue to be sensitive to investment.\n\n\"Investment in the state's broadband networks is critical to keeping Iowa competitive and providing our citizens with the best technology,\" said Iowa State Sen. Steve Warnstadt, chair of the Senate Commerce Committee. \"Expanding and enhancing the mobile broadband network extends the benefits of broadband access to many consumers who are relying more and more on wireless technology to access the Internet.\"\n\nFrom 2007 through 2009, AT&T's total capital investment in its Iowa wireless and wireline networks was nearly $55 million. From 2007 through 2009, AT&T's wireless network investment in Iowa was more than $25 million. In May 2009, AT&T announced plans to acquire wireless assets, including former Alltel assets, from Verizon Wireless subject to regulatory approval. A total of three Iowa service areas are part of that territory.\n\n\"These investments in smart networks are enabling the innovation of today and tomorrow that will enhance economic growth and stimulate jobs,\" said Beth Canuteson, Director, External Affairs, AT&T Iowa. \"We commend the work of our state legislature and the other leaders of our state who are creating a positive economic environment that provides opportunities for companies to continue to invest aggressively in Iowa.\"\n\nInternet usage growth has brought tremendous benefits for consumers, but requires tremendous investments in infrastructure. This significant investment in infrastructure and jobs is possible due to policy that enables companies to compete and offer the innovative services that consumers are increasingly demanding. AT&T has been working with policy makers to support a national broadband plan that enables broadband adoption and ensures broadband access to every American by 2014.\n\nWireless data traffic on the AT&T network has grown more than 5,000 percent over the past three years, largely attributed to today's advanced smartphones that are generating dramatically increasing volumes of network traffic. In fact, roughly 40 percent of AT&T's postpaid customer base uses a smartphone today, representing twice the number of smartphone customers than any other U.S. provider.\n\n\"We're seeing advanced smartphones driving up to 10 times the amount of usage of other devices on average,\" said Hardmon Williams, vice president and general manager for AT&T Mobility and Consumer Markets in Iowa. \"Despite these unprecedented increases in wireless data traffic, AT&T's network investments and upgrades have enabled us to continue to deliver the nation's fastest 3G network.\"\n\nAT&T recently completed a software upgrade at 3G cell sites nationwide that prepares the nation's fastest 3G network for even faster speeds. The deployment of High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA) 7.2 technology is the first of multiple initiatives in AT&T's network enhancement strategy designed to provide customers with an enhanced mobile broadband experience, both today and well into the future.\n\nFaster 3G speeds are scheduled to become available this year and in 2011 as AT&T combines the new technology with our second initiative to dramatically increase the number of high-speed backhaul connections to cell sites, primarily with fiber-optic connections, adding capacity from cell sites to the AT&T backbone network.\n\nThe backhaul upgrades are also a key step in the evolution toward next-generation LTE mobile broadband technology. AT&T is designing its new backhaul deployments to accommodate both faster 3G and future LTE deployments. AT&T currently plans to begin trials of LTE technology this year, and to begin LTE deployment in 2011, matching industry time lines for broader availability of compelling devices and supporting network equipment.\n\nAT&T's 3G mobile broadband network is based on the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) family of technologies that includes GSM and UMTS, the most open and widely used wireless network platforms in the world. AT&T offers 3G data roaming in more than 115 countries, as well as voice calling in more than 220 countries. The technology also provides customers the ability to talk and surf the Internet at the same time.\n\nAT&T is also an industry leader in Wi-Fi with the nation's largest Wi-Fi network, which complements its wired broadband and wireless 3G networks, offering Wi-Fi connectivity in more than 20,000 U.S. hotspots - including retail stores and restaurants from coast-to-coast. A full list of AT&T Wi-Fi locations is available at www.attwifi.com.\n\nFor more information about AT&T's wireless coverage in Iowa, or anywhere in the United States, consumers can go to http://www.wireless.att.com/coverageviewer/.
