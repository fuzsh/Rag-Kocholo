If youâ€™re wondering what to expect during your first few days at college, weâ€™ve compiled the essential information to help you get off to a flying start.

Then read on...â€¦ I was talking to a team of supply chain consultants today and made me want to point out that, as an advisory board member, the University has deep expertise to support our sector development with a superb online MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. Maybe even more excitingly the new DAIM CoE (Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Modelling) has launched an MSc in AI (already taking cohorts that are fully subscribed) and I would encourage my innovation network to check this out! #lifelonglearning #innovation #ai\n\nOn both the Common Application and the University of California application there is a section to list and describe your accomplishments, including summer activities. If it is on the application, it is safe to assume that it is important in the admissions process. Younger students still forming their interests should have the most leverage to explore rather than select something that â€˜looks goodâ€™ on a college application. You do not have to travel or spend a ton of money for your summer to have an impact. Here is a list of possibilities. Read on here: https://lnkd.in/gyVCNefd\n\nAugust 1 in Student Affairs: A Time for Reflection and Renewal As summer draws to a close and we prepare for the new academic year, keep the following in mind: 1. Itâ€™s perfectly okay if you didnâ€™t complete every project you set out to tackle this summer. 2. Itâ€™s perfectly okay if you feel behind in your preparations. 3. Itâ€™s perfectly okay if you feel as if you need a bit more time to get ready before students return. Extend yourself some grace. The attitude and energy we bring to our work with students will far outweigh the summer projects left unfinished. This summer has been challenging for many of us, with the complexities of FAFSA, enrollment numbers, maintenance upgrades, and more. If no one else has told you yet, youâ€™ve done a great job this summer. #August1 #StudentAffairs #HigherEducation #Leadership #Students\n\nReflecting on my career so far, some of my most cherished memories involve traversing the roads of the United States. My mission was clear: to engage with high school students and introduce them to the unparalleled academic experience at the University of St Andrews. From bustling urban institutions to serene rural campuses, in the high schools in America I had the privilege of meeting with students, hearing their aspirations, and presenting them with an opportunity to broaden their horizons. To those in similar roles today: Recognise the magnitude of your task. Every presentation, every conversation, and every brochure handed out has the potential to shape a student's future. The weight of that responsibility is significant, but so too is the reward. As you travel and speak, remember that you are not merely a representative of an institution, but a communicator of opportunity. The chance to influence the academic trajectory of so many eager minds is rare, so seize it, relish it, and above all, understand its profound importance. To my contemporaries in this endeavour: Continue the commendable work. Your influence is far-reaching and deeply impactful. I miss it dearly. #highereducation #students"
