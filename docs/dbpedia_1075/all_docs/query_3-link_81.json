        "text": "Debby K. Jantz was born June 30, 1952, Sioux City, IA, the daughter of Theodore R. and Iona M. (Mahin) Schumacher. She grew up in the Correctionville, IA area graduating from Correctionville High School in 1970. Following high school she worked in Sioux City, IA as a legal secretary.\n\nOn September 1, 1995, Debby married Steve Jantz in Kingsley, IA. The couple made their home for the last 27 years in Kingsley. Together they enjoyed attending their kids’, grandkids’, and even great grandkids’ events. They spent countless hours in the bleachers traveling near and far. They also enjoyed golfing and the friendships made on the course. According to Debby, 3 clubs were really all you need for a round of golf! Debby enjoyed baking and especially loved making and sharing holiday goodies. It wasn’t uncommon to find over 20 different recipes being baked with the kids and grandkids for Christmas. Debby also loved watching British sitcoms, reading, puzzles & spending time with her sisters and family. She loved spending time in her garden and tending to her flowers. Debby was somehow able to find pleasure in simple moments- even pulling weeds. Debby’s favorite times were spent visiting with her friends, family and most of all spoiling her grandchildren.\n\nShe will be lovingly remembered by her husband, Steve Jantz of Kingsley; two daughters: Stacy (Lee) Campbell of Pierson and Darcy (Chad) Kuchel of Kingsley; two sons: John Susie of Kingsley and Tim (Abbie) Susie of Kingsley; Grandchildren: Kendra, Tyler, Austin, Kaylee, Payton, Paige, Drake, Jagger, Weston and Beau; two great-grandchildren: Paisley and Ada; sisters: Betty Fitch of Correctionville, IA and Shirley Goodburn of Estero, Florida, brother: Gary (Ann) Schumacher of Correctionville, IA; and many nieces, nephews, extended family and friends.\n\nDebby was preceded in death by her parents, infant son Mark, and sisters Kay Dorn and Colleen Mammen.\n\nIn the words of Sophia, Blanche, Dorothy and Rose, “Stay golden.”"
