        "text": "DES MOINES — Just a few months ago, Maj. Gen. Ron Dardis described the Iowa National Guard as stretched and stressed from its deployments overseas but stronger than it had been in generations.\n\nNo one knew then that more than 4,000 Guard members would be called into action to help the state fight back floodwaters and provide security to flood-ravaged communities.\n\nIn the days since widespread flooding hit Iowa, Guard members have helped sandbag threatened cities and performed a number of essential missions as the state responded to the natural disaster. In Illinois, close to 1,400 members of the Illinois National Guard have been activated to battle floodwaters along the Mississippi River.\n\nRussell Bierl, retired colonel with the Iowa Army National Guard and the director of the Iowa Gold Star Military Museum, said the floods of 2008 will go down as one of the largest activations in the Iowa Guard’s history.\n\nThe Guard has responded to other major flooding in the past, Bierl said, including the floods of 1993 and the flooding of the Mississippi River in 1965.\n\nBut this time, Bierl has noticed that many of the Guard members responding to the floods wear combat patches to show they’ve served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nA guard member for 36 years, Bierl has seen a growing recognition and appreciation for the Guard’s work, especially after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n“People are proud of their service men and women from Iowa, and it’s showing,” Bierl said.\n\nSteve Warnstadt, a state senator and Guard member from Sioux City, said the foreign deployments helped prepare members for the flood response in Iowa. Warnstadt was one of those called in to help with flooding efforts.\n\n“I think members of the National Guard were more than happy to respond because they knew they were needed and knew they could do the job,” he said.\n\nThe Guard’s first mission is to be ready for combat, followed by helping protect the lives of Iowans and preserve property, said Iowa National Guard spokesman Greg Hapgood.\n\nOf the roughly 9,400 members in Iowa, about 850 currently are on active duty, with most serving in Iraq and Kosovo, he said.\n\nHapgood said the Guard first asked for volunteers for flood relief efforts but then began asking members to report for duty once they began to realize the scope of the flooding disaster.\n\n“Those soldiers and airmen just have an incredible amount of pride to be right here in their home state, side by side with their neighbors and fellow Iowans lending a hand, making sure that they were safe, and also protecting really key infrastructure here in the state,” Hapgood said.\n\nUsing rapid deployment techniques, the Guard in a single day was able to triple the number of soldiers and airmen on the ground in Cedar Rapids, Hapgood said.\n\nThere the Guard protected the city’s police headquarters, transported electrical equipment to help generate emergency power and assisted in the evacuation of a hospital. Additionally, they worked with teams helping clear neighborhoods so residents could return to their homes.\n\nHapgood stresses how important the support from families and Guard members’ regular employers is as they are deployed overseas or activated to help out in an Iowa disaster.\n\nIowans have shown their appreciation, especially in Washington, Iowa, where someone offered to do Guard members’ laundry, Hapgood said. In other places, people offer food and drinks and open their homes to Guard members.\n\n“People are unbelievable,” Hapgood said.\n\nCharlotte Eby can be reached at (515) 243-0138 or chareby@aol.com.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
