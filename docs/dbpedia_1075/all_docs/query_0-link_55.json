        "text": "SIOUX CITY (KTIV) - It wasn’t just the Republicans caucusing in Iowa, though they’re the only ones reporting results Monday night. Iowa Democrats also gathered at caucus sites across the state to discuss party business.\n\nAlthough most eyes were focused on the GOP side of things on caucus night that didn’t stop the Woodbury County Democrats from organizing in what they call a grassroots effort to try and build Democrat leadership up from local government levels all the way to national government.\n\n“This year we have tried to have a more inclusive caucus by having a two-part process for the grassroots organizing in-person on caucus night as well as the mail-in preference cards which is still ongoing,” said Dave Dawson, Woodbury County Democratic Chair.\n\nThose mail-in cards can be requested all the way up until Feb. 19 using the Iowa Democrats website here. Even though no results came out Monday for the Democratic party, officials were pleased with the participation especially considering the conditions.\n\n“Given how cold it was and given the lack of expectations and not much focus on what’s going on with the presidential side with the Democrats it was really good turnout,” said Dave Steve Warnstadt, a Woodbury County Democrat.\n\nOfficials also pointed out they saw a good amount of people from key precincts which they think is a good sign for the future of the democratic party and more specifically the results of the Caucus that will be available on March 5.\n\n“I was excited to those who showed up tonight, to get more Democrats involved to elect more democrats from the local level to the state legislature, the county board of supervisors and also at the national level,” said Dawson."
