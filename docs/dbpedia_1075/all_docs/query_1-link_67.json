Example letter:\n\nI urge you to take up the cause of lowering healthcare costs to the citizens of Iowa. As you may already know, the antiquated Certificate of Need Laws artifitially inflate healthcare costs. 14 states across the country have already abolished their CON Laws in order to lower healthcare costs, and the Hospitals are still thriving in these states. Thank you for your efforts toward preserving our nation's future.\n\nSincererly"
