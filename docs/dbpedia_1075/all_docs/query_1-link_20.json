        "text": "State Senator Steve Warnstadt of Sioux City is traveling across Iowa to highlight the progress made on supporting members of the armed services and veterans by the State Legislature. Warnstadt is a member of the Senate Veterans Committee. He is also a veteran of the First Gulf War, a member of the American Legion and the VFW. He is a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard.\n\nWarnstadt's travels are in advance of Memorial Day, Monday, May 26. He visited Waukon Thursday, May 15, accompanied by Democratic candidate for State Senate Mary Jo Wilhelm, who currently serves on the Howard County Board of Supervisors.\n\n\"Memorial Day is a good time to examine the Iowa Legislature's record on issues affecting veterans, and the men and women serving today,\" Warnstadt said. \"Overall, Iowa does pretty well, especially compared to other states.\"\n\nThe legislation Warnstadt highlighted includes:\n\n House File 2065, which makes sure Iowa citizen soldiers can return to their jobs with the same seniority, status and pay they would have had if not called to duty.\n\n Senate File 2214, which makes sure that service members who have custody and physical care of their children prior to deploying will retain that custody when they return home. Their military service cannot be used against them in a child custody hearing.\n\n Senate File 2289, which increases the state dollars that children of deceased service members can receive to attend college and expands eligibility for this benefit.\n\n Senate File 2124, which expands the ways veterans can benefit from the Veterans Trust Fund to include durable medical equipment (such as wheelchairs) and ambulance and emergency room services.\n\n House File 2359, which creates four new lottery games to help support the Veterans Trust Fund. It's estimated that the games will add more than three million dollars per year to this trust fund.\n\n Senate File 2134, which requires each Iowa county to have qualified veterans service officers and set minimum hours of operation. The bill includes funding for certification of veterans service officers.\n\n\"We also provided $20 million to expand and improve facilities at the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown. This money, when added to federal matching funds and previous state allocations, means the total investment will be $100 million,\" said Warnstadt. \"The result will be a state-of-the-art facility that will be one of the best in the country and enhance the quality health care, security and sense of community that those who served our nation deserve. I want to thank all members of the Iowa Legislature who joined in this effort, and I especially want to thank the Iowa veterans who brought important needs to our attention and started the ball rolling. I want people to know that we are not just talking about supporting veterans, we are working hard to get the benefits to our veterans that they deserve.\""
