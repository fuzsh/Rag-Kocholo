        "text": "(SIOUX CITY, IA) After four terms as an Iowa state representative and two as a state senator, Steve Warnstadt's political career in Des Moines ended when the final gavel fell on the 2010 session. The District 1 lawmaker talks about his time in office.\n\nWhen the 2010 legislative session wrapped up Tuesday, it was the shortest in nearly 40 years at just 79 days.\n\n\"I think we made a number of reductions, we went through some government reorganization that will help streamline government but we did have to make some cuts in areas that we really didn't want to have to make,\" says Steve Warnstadt, State Senate District 1.\n\nThe huge challenge of balancing the state budget wasn't the only issue on the table. Warnstadt says veterans affairs, service member protection and health care topped the list of successes.\n\n\"We were able to actually find money to help Sioux City hospitals deal with unreimbursed care,\" says Warnstadt.\n\nWarnstadt never planned on making public office a life long occupation.\n\n\"I planned on doing the teaching route. But I wanted to help shape history rather than just teach it,\" says Warnstadt.\n\nBut following in the family footsteps of public service, Warnstadt served Siouxland for 16 years.\n\n\"It's time to move on with a young family and I want to spend some more time with them and develop a true career,\" says Warnstadt.\n\nNow the race is on to fill his seat in November, with Democrat Rick Mullin on the ballot.\n\n\"With five open seats, it's going to be a very politically contentious year this fall and we'll see how that shakes out,\" says Warnstadt.\n\nWarnstadt is still undecided about his future career plans but for the next few months he'll continue recruiting and retention work for the Iowa National Guard as the state prepares to deploy 3,500 soldiers this fall.\n\nReported by Erika Thomas.
