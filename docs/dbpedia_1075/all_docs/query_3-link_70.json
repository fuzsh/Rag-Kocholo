JASON CROW of colorado in the house of representatives Tuesday, August 31, 2021 Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, as a combat veteran who served three tours of duty, both in Afghanistan and Iraq, I understand the danger and lasting implications of war. We mourn for the U.S. servicemembers killed in the August 26 attack in Kabul. These service members were engaged in a mission to save the lives of others, and we should never forget their service and sacrifice. As we grieve with the rest of America, we must commit to evacuating U.S. citizens and our Afghan partners, regardless of the August 31st deadline. I recognize this operation is not without risk, but I believe it is both a moral and national security imperative to see this evacuation to completion. Therefore, I include in the Record the following letter signed by 600 veterans on the importance of continued evacuation efforts. I look forward to our continued work to bring our brave service members, U.S. citizens, and Afghan partners to safety. Veterans' Letter to President Biden on Afghanistan August 25, 2021. President Joe Biden, The White House, Washington, DC. Dear Mr. President: As veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces, we are writing to express our strong and unwavering support for the ongoing evacuation efforts for U.S. citizens and our Afghan allies being led by the United States at the Hamid Karzai International Airport. Throughout our military service, we have seen firsthand the importance of not just the interpreters who worked alongside our troops on the battlefield, but also the thousands of Afghans who directly supported our American mission through U.S.-funded NGOs, contractors, and other implementers. These civilian operations--led by the Afghans working on U.S. funded projects--have been vital for U.S. national security and for empowering millions of women and girls. The grave danger now faced by these Afghan allies and their families cannot be overstated. We are also deeply worried that this group of Afghans-- individuals who qualify for Priority 2 refugee status--could be largely left behind by the current U.S. military evacuation efforts. We fear that the U.S. will fail in its moral duty to protect these individuals who stood directly with America. Therefore, we write with three specific and urgent requests for your Administration: 1. Prioritize U.S.-led evacuations for potential and qualifying Priority 2 applicants and their families for evacuation efforts alongside potential Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants and U.S. citizens. 2. Extend the evacuation mission past August 31, 2021--not just for U.S. citizens--but for all our Afghan allies that worked alongside us in the military and U.S. civilian missions, assuming everyone cannot be evacuated by the deadline. 3. Ensure safe corridors for evacuees to access the Kabul airport. Thank you for your attention and leadership to help get all our Afghan allies to safety. As we all know, time is of the essence.
