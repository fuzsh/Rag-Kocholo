        "text": "Great image of the University of Hull. Interested in Supply Chains and AI? Then read on...‚Ä¶ I was talking to a team of supply chain consultants today and made me want to point out that, as an advisory board member, the University has deep expertise to support our sector development with a superb online MSc in Logistics and Supply Chain Management. Maybe even more excitingly the new DAIM CoE (Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and Modelling) has launched an MSc in AI (already taking cohorts that are fully subscribed) and I would encourage my innovation network to check this out! #lifelonglearning #innovation #ai\n\nOn both the Common Application and the University of California application there is a section to list and describe your accomplishments, including summer activities. If it is on the application, it is safe to assume that it is important in the admissions process. Younger students still forming their interests should have the most leverage to explore rather than select something that ‚Äòlooks good‚Äô on a college application. You do not have to travel or spend a ton of money for your summer to have an impact. Here is a list of possibilities. Read on here: https://lnkd.in/gyVCNefd\n\nüéì Today, on National First-Generation College Student Day, I want to celebrate the incredible journey that many of us have embarked on. As a proud #firstgenerationcollegestudent - someone who went from a community college (at Cerritos College) to getting a BA degree from California State University, Los Angeles, an MA from Fuller Theological Seminary and a doctorate (at Biola University) and now seeking a second master's degree (at University of California, Irvine - The Paul Merage School of Business) - I know firsthand the challenges we face, but also the #determination that drives us forward. üë®üèΩüéì Being the first in your family to attend #college is a testament to your #resilience and #ambition. It's a path filled with uncertainty, but it's also a path that opens doors to new #opportunities and paves the way for future generations. In other words, first gen college students will set a new direction for generations to come. Remember, your unique experiences and perspectives as a first-gen student are valuable assets. Embrace them, because they set you apart in a world that values #diversity and #inclusion. Let's continue #breakingbarriers, defying expectations, and showing the world what we're capable of. We do this for our familia. We do this for our comunidad. Our success is their success. ‚úäüèΩ To all the first-gen students out there, you are an inspiration! Keep reaching for the stars and inspiring others to follow in your footsteps. ¬°Pa ‚Äòlante, mi gente! üëäüèΩ #FirstGenPride #NationalFirstGenDay #EducationMatters #educatedlatinos\n\nReflecting on my career so far, some of my most cherished memories involve traversing the roads of the United States. My mission was clear: to engage with high school students and introduce them to the unparalleled academic experience at the University of St Andrews. From bustling urban institutions to serene rural campuses, in the high schools in America I had the privilege of meeting with students, hearing their aspirations, and presenting them with an opportunity to broaden their horizons. To those in similar roles today: Recognise the magnitude of your task. Every presentation, every conversation, and every brochure handed out has the potential to shape a student's future. The weight of that responsibility is significant, but so too is the reward. As you travel and speak, remember that you are not merely a representative of an institution, but a communicator of opportunity. The chance to influence the academic trajectory of so many eager minds is rare, so seize it, relish it, and above all, understand its profound importance. To my contemporaries in this endeavour: Continue the commendable work. Your influence is far-reaching and deeply impactful. I miss it dearly. #highereducation #students"
