Sheldon, Iowa — There’s going to be a new way to get a degree in agricultural studies from Iowa State University — and it only involves two semesters in Ames.

Iowa State is partnering with Western Iowa Technical Community College in Sioux City and Northwest Iowa Community College in Sheldon to offer a

more flexible way to earn a Bachelor of Science degree in agricultural studies.

Steve Warnstadt is the coordinator of the Northwest Iowa Regents Resource Center, which allows the two community colleges to be in constant connection with the three Iowa universities. He tells us why they’re making the program available.

He says the Regents Resource Center was designed to help northwest Iowans be more connected with the state universities.
