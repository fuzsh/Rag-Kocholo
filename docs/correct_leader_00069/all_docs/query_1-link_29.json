The president said the appointment as Ambassador to Japan of such an eminent statesman as former Vice President Walter Mondale underscored the importance he attaches to this relationship.\n\nTurning to economic issues, Prime Minister Hosokawa pledged to uphold the commitments in the Economic Framework Agreement reached in Tokyo in July and to re-double efforts to achieve progress under that agreement. President Clinton emphasized the need to begin negotiations in September on government procurement, autos, auto parts and insurance.\n\nThe two leaders looked forward to meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation gathering in Seattle in November, and discussed the possibility of arranging an earlier meeting on the occasion of the UN General Assembly in late September. They also shared condolances on the flood disasters suffered in the two countries.\n\n-0-"
