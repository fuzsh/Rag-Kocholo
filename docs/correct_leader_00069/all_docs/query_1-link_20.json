        "text": "A total of 24 landscape maps of the four seasons of Eigen-in, a sub-temple of Kennin-ji Temple, are released.\n\nAt the Pola Museum Annex (Ginza, Chuo-ku, Tokyo), Morihiro Hosokawa's exhibition \"The Four Seasons of Kyoraku\" will be held from Friday, September 15, 2023 to Sunday, October 15, 2023.\n\nAfter retiring from politics at the age of 60, Morihiro Hosokawa began creative activities such as pottery, calligraphy, and oil painting. In recent years, he has been involved in the production of many large-scale wall paintings, such as the \"Fusuma of East and West\" partition paintings for Jionden, Yakushiji Temple in Nara, and the \"Unryu-zu\" fusuma paintings in Ryoan-ji Temple, Kyoto.\n\nIn this exhibition, we will display the \"Fusuma paintings of the four seasons landscape\" dedicated to Eigen-in, a sub-temple of Kenninji Temple in Kyoto in 2014. The 24 fusuma paintings, consisting of “Chiin,'' “Keisei,'' “Shuki,'' and “Chosetsu,'' are mainly ink paintings of the distant views of Kyoto in each of the four seasons. It is sometimes drawn with a light color tone. This is Hosokawa's early work in fusuma painting, and it will be the first time in about 10 years that it will be exhibited outside. Originally they were placed in separate rooms, but one of the highlights of this exhibition is that you can see all 24 of them. In addition, I will introduce lacquer painting works that I have been producing for the past few years, using lotus, flowers, and insects as motifs.\n\n《Exhibition Overview》\n\nExhibition name: Morihiro Hosokawa Exhibition “The Four Seasons of Keiraku”\n\nDate: September 15, 2023 (Friday) – October 15, 2023 (Sunday) * Open every day during the exhibition Hours: 11:00 – 19:00 (admission until 18:30)\n\nAdmission: Free Venue: Pola Museum Annex (Pola Ginza Building 3F, 1-7-7 Ginza, Chuo-ku, 104-0061)\n\nAccess: Tokyo Metro Ginza 1-chome Station Exit 7 / 6 minute walk from Tokyo Metro Ginza Station Exit A9 Organizer: Pola Orbis Holdings Co., Ltd.
