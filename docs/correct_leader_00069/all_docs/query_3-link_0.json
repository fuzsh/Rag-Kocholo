        "text": "Hosokawa Morihiro (born January 14, 1938, Kyushu, Japan) is the founder of the reform political party Japan New Party (Nihon Shintō) and was the prime minister of Japan in 1993–94.\n\nHosokawa’s maternal grandfather, Konoe Fumimaro, was prime minister of Japan in 1937–39 and 1940–41. After graduating from Sophia University, Tokyo, Hosokawa joined the staff of the liberal newspaper Asahi Shimbun in 1963. In 1969 he ran for a seat in the lower house of the Japanese parliament. He lost that race, but two years later, with strong support from the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP), he was elected to the less powerful upper house, where he served for 12 years.\n\nElected governor of Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu island in 1983, Hosokawa pursued an aggressive economic policy and strengthened environmental laws but was often frustrated by the powerful bureaucracy of the central government. In 1992, calling for electoral reform and an end to political corruption and one-party rule, he formed the Japan New Party (JNP) as a conservative alternative to the LDP. The JNP quickly gained strength, helped by the graft scandals and internal dissension that plagued the LDP. In 1993 a coalition of seven dissident LDP factions and opposition parties in the House of Representatives elected Hosokawa prime minister; he thus became the first non-LDP premier of Japan since 1955."
