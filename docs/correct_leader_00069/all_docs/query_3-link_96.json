        "text": "I just realised I’ve been sitting on an Iceland 2009 map for ages and never got round to doing a writeup for it, which is a shame because it’s a fairly interesting election and I probably could’ve and should’ve a long time ago.\n\nThe 2009 election remains the high watermark for the left-wing Social Democratic Alliance (SDA), though their current poll numbers are very healthy and there’s a possibility they could surpass that if they hold steady by the next election, and to date mark the only time since its founding that the Independence Party has not been the biggest party in the Althing. The reason for these big reversals in fortune was, of course, the severe consequences of the Great Recession in Iceland.\n\nThe Independence Party had been in power continuously since 1991, first in coalition with the old Social Democratic Party from 1991 to 1995, then with Iceland’s other major party the Progressive Party up until 2006, and then with the SDA (which had formed in 2000 after the three separate social democratic parties presented a joint list in 1999) after the Progressives pulled out of the coalition. Initially this had seen the SDA’s until-then meteoric growth take a hit, with the party losing seats at the 2007 election, not helped by the fact it had long been seen as too soft-left by a faction that proceeded to leave to form the green socialist Left-Green Movement, but the Independence Party would proceed to spectacularly self-destruct in the brief parliamentary term that followed.\n\nSee, between 1991 and 2004, the Independence Party’s leader, Davið Oddsson, had served as Prime Minister and enacted a swathe of privatisation and tax cut plans. While he had resigned due to a combination of an agreement with the Independence Party limiting his time left in office and a failed bill trying to establish restrictions on media company ownership that President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson had vetoed, he served Minister for Foreign Affairs for a year and then became Governor of the Central Bank of Iceland. Under his watch, and arguably because of his government’s policies, the Central Bank would prove impotent when the Great Recession caused a crisis of confidence in three of Iceland’s biggest banks, Glitnir, Kaupthing and Landsbanki.\n\nThese banks had been expanding internationally, and now had assets 11 times the size of Iceland’s GDP and accrued the country 7 times that in external debt; the most obvious way this manifested was in the Icesave dispute where the UK and Netherlands claimed Iceland owed them the insurance for deposits investors there had made into Landsbanki before it folded. All three of the banks were taken into government ownership and renamed to try to distance them from the mismanagement which had led to their collapse, a humiliating development for the Independence Party, and most of their international operations were cut back, causing a decline in foreign involvement in Iceland’s economy; famously, a year later McDonald’s closed its last Icelandic branch, and the last ever cheeseburger brought there was turned into an exhibition piece by the buyer.\n\nThe public response to this is perhaps best summed up by a phrase popularised by comedian and later Mayor of Rekjavik Jón Gnarr in a comedy sketch on the end-of-year comedy special Áramótaskaupið– ‘Helvítis fokking fokk!!’, which apparently roughly translates as ‘What the fuckity fucking fuck!!’ and is officially my favourite slogan in the history of politics. In the winter of 2008-9, all hell broke loose with protestors demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Geir Haarde and for new elections to be called immediately; the protests were the biggest in Iceland’s history, and the police using tear gas on the protestors was an even worse look for the government. Another act of public disobedience, where people banged pots and pans to disrupt the Althing’s first meeting of the year, gave the protests their popular nickname- the ‘Kitchenware Revolution’.\n\nIn late January, Geir agreed to resign, citing his recent diagnosis of oesophageal cancer and definitely nothing else, and Ólafur invited the SDA’s Social Affairs Minister Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir to form a coalition with the Left-Greens. Jóhanna was one of the only government ministers whose conduct the public approved of, and had a good working relationship with the Left-Greens even though they didn’t command a majority in the Althing combined, which stood the two left-wing parties in good stead for the election Jóhanna proceeded to call.\n\nThat election would see the combined left win a majority in the Althing for the first time in history, with the Independence Party losing nearly 13 percentage points and 9 of its 25 seats (it likely only avoided losing more thanks to interim chairman, and later PM and Centre Party leader Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, accepting the public demand for an early election). The Left-Greens even topped the poll in the Northeast constituency where its leader Steingrímur J. Sigfússon is based. The newly-formed Citizens’ Movement also won 4 seats, a sign of how the Kitchenware Revolution would give rise to minor parties in Iceland for quite some time to come.\n\nWhile the new government would be famously radical in many areas, notably including Jóhanna’s status as the world’s first LGBTQ person elected as a head of state, its ban on strip clubs and its invocation of the Landsdómur (national court) for the first time ever to try to convict Geir for misconduct during the financial crisis, it ended up falling short in many others. Davið Oddsson faced few consequences, becoming editor of the Morgunblaðið newspaper in September 2009, a post he holds to this day; attempts at a new citizen-drafted constitution proved heavily protracted; and the SDA’s efforts to bring Iceland into the EU were stymied by opposition from across the political spectrum, especially with the Icesave dispute damaging trust in European cooperation.\n\nThe SDA-Left-Green government would ultimately leave office after a landslide defeat in 2013 having run out of time to push for many of their reforms and lost popularity over their handling of others, with a new Independence-Progressive coalition being formed which unceremoniously threw out the constitutional plans and attempts to join the EU.\n\nMax mentioning Saarland in his recent Germany posts made me remember I had a map of the\n\nelections in the Saar Protectorate lying around.\n\nDuring its time as an independent nation, the Saarland was effectively in a disputed position internationally between France and West Germany, but with an initial bias towards France due to the whole 'Nazi annexation' thing, a trade agreement with the country, and the fact pro-German parties weren't allowed to run at first. The dominant party in the 1947 and 1952 elections was the Christian People's Party of the Saarland (Christliche Volkspartei des Saarlandes, CVP), which won majorities in those elections. This was in no small part due to its leader Johannes Hoffmann, who had been an anti-Nazi dissident after the Saarland's annexation, and its stance as ideologically very similar to the CDU without being pro-German.\n\nOther parties in the Saarland at the time included the Social Democratic Party of the Saarland (Sozialdemokratische Partei des Saarlandes, SPS), a social democratic party obviously close to the SPD but with the same ambiguous position on the Saarland's foreign policy as the CVP, even having Cabinet positions at times; the Democratic Party of the Saarland (Demokratische Partei Saar, DPS), the local branch of the FDP which was initially also sympathetic to France but then became home to a lot of ex-Nazi Party members who wanted the Saarland to rejoin Germany, for which the party was banned in 1951 (I get the impression it was for the German revanchism and not the former Nazism, depressingly); and the Communist Party of the Saarland (Kommunistische Partei Saar, KP), who (shock!) were communists, though notably they were actually the only party whose members voted against ratifying the Constitution.\n\nI mentioned before how Hoffmann was ideologically very similar to the CDU, but where his ideology differed (and differed from France, in fact) was in foreign policy. He argued for Saarland to establish a separatist position where it would become a unifying European buffer state of sorts. To this end, as the Saar's Prime Minister he advocated for the Saar Statute that would make it independent with the trade agreement with France continuing.\n\nHowever, public opposition to the Statute and the continued French cooperation it represented had grown significantly, not helped by the chaotic policies of the Fourth Republic in contrast to West Germany's emerging prosperity. The 1952 election saw 24.5% of the vote going to blank ballots for the banned pro-German parties, and in turn Hoffmann and his rule became an enemy of the movement too; in the October 1955 referendum on the Saar Statute, the No campaign used the slogan 'Der Dicke muss weg' (literally 'The fat guy has to go').\n\nIndeed, that referendum saw a strong vote against the Statute (I would include a map of it here but the results are reported on district boundaries rather than the three constituencies the Lantag elections were done on, so I'll do that once I've got a good basemap for it) that led Hoffmann to resign and new elections to be called. This time, pro-German parties were allowed to run, including the CDU and DSP (the SPD by another name- I think I can trust they don't need introducing!), as well as the DPS, which had became very popular after the ban on it was lifted due to its steadfast support for the nationalist movement and came just 1.2% behind the CDU. The Heimatbund alliance of these three pro-German parties took a combined 63.9% of the vote and 33 (rising to 34 after electoral appeals) of the 50 seats in the Landtag.\n\nWith public opinion in Saarland now clearly majority pro-German unification, the French and West German governments negotiated the Saar Treaty, allowing Saarland to become a German state in exchange for channellizing the Moselle and teaching French as the first foreign language of the province. This was agreed in October 1956, and on the 1st January 1957 Saarland joined West Germany. Interestingly, DPS leader Heinrich Schneider would be elected as the first member of the Bundestag for Saarbrücken at the election later that year, the second-to-last time to date that the FDP has won a constituency seat.\n\nConsidering I made a whole Czechoslovakia TL on the Other Place, I may as well map the first election in the independent Czech Republic.\n\nFollowing the Velvet Divorce, the Czech Republic continued on with its National Council elected in 1992 as the legislature, with the first election held three years later. The two Václavs- Havel, the President and leader of the Civic Forum independence movement and previously a signatory of Charter 77, and Klaus, the first independent Czech Prime Minister- had a pretty spotty working relationship, as Klaus wanted to introduce a more intensive neoliberal policy. Nevertheless, Klaus's party, the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and Havel's, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), were in coalition with the refounded version of the pre-coup People's Party (now known as the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party, KDU-ČSL).\n\nThe left were finally starting to get a more coherent strategy, as the Czechoslovak Party of Social Democrats (ČSSD) led by Miloš Zeman led a vigorous campaign that involved a national road trip on an old bus named 'Zemák' (which apparently means 'countryman', 'potato' and 'Zeman's Karosa (the make of the bus)'- Zeman's personal brand is weirdly heavily tied into buses, to the point that Czech Wikipedia has a whole article about the various buses called Zemák he's used in his campaigns). Meanwhile, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSČM) had had control of it taken over by the anti-revisionist wing, further strengthening the ČSSD as a left-wing alternative.\n\nBecause of the continued strength of the Rally for the Republic - Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSČ), neither the left nor the right held enough seats to form a majority government, with the ODS-led coalition 2 seats short of one. This led to the ČSSD having to tolerate the government, which gradually led to it returning to government over the course of the next brief term, and contributed quite a bit to the corruption endemic in modern Czech politics.\n\nOne little thing of note about the electoral system is that the 1996 and 1998 elections didn't have a constituency for overseas voters. As far as I can tell (the most immediate explanation I could find was genuinely on the Japanese Wikipedia of all places, so I may have misunderstood), it instead had a second round of seat allocation, based on taking the votes for the main parties above the 5% threshold that didn't contribute to netting seats and allocating them in one national constituency.\n\nThe 1996-98 session of the Chamber of Deputies saw the unstable ODS-led governing coalition collapse partly due to economic decline and partly because of a scandal in which it was revealed that two people claimed to be the ODS’s biggest sponsors were pseudonyms for Milan Šrejber, who privatised the Třinec Iron and Steel Works. Just to twist the knife further for the ODS, it was revealed in November 1997 that the party had a secret Swiss bank account, which made any attempts to fix the apparent embezzlement look pretty farcical.\n\nThe ODA and KDU-ČSL withdrew all support for the government in response, and the ODS’s Interior Minister Jan Ruml challenged Václav Klaus for the party leadership. You might have expected him to win, but Klaus had strengthened his position with the ODS rank and file with the fact that he was in Sarajevo at the time, and coined the nickname ‘Sarajevském atentátu’ (‘Sarajevo assassinations’) for his treatment among his supporters; it’s likely that his being at the Bosnian front also helped his image of being both a strong leader and disconnected from the ODS’s corruption. Nethertheless, Klaus stood down in favour of Czech National Bank governor Josef Tošovský, who led a caretaker government until new elections could be held in the summer of 1998.\n\nConsequently, Klaus defeated Ruml in the leadership contest easily. Ruml’s faction then left the ODS to form the Freedom Union (US), which initially surged in the polls, helped by the ODS being tarnished and the ODA choosing not to contest the election. However, the US would soon be drowned out thanks to their support for the Tošovský government and the ODS recovering some of their popularity thanks to Klaus’s continued leadership- there was little difference in the US and ODS policy platforms, but the ODS stressing the personally popular Klaus benefitted the party despite its scandals.\n\nHowever, the favourites for the 1998 election were definitely the ČSSD; as part of his continued obsession with buses, Miloš Zeman personally requested Tony Blair provide him with a pair of Routemasters to campaign with. The party also benefitted from a pledge to fight corruption (Zeman tied himself to the Mani Pulite anti-corruption campaign in Italy) and halt privatization, though its recycling of slogans from 1996 was perhaps less inspiring.\n\nThe results saw a comfortable victory for the ČSSD, but a much better performance for the ODS than expected. After securing President Havel’s support to form a government, Zeman reached out to the KDU-ČSL and US for a government, but Ruml refused to work with Zeman even if the KDU-ČSL leader Josef Lux was allowed to become PM instead.\n\nAs a result, Zeman opened talks with Klaus to arrange what was known as the ‘Treaty on creating a stable political environment in the Czech Republic’, or more commonly the ‘Opposition Agreement’ (Czech: Opoziční smlouva). This committed the ČSSD and ODS to cooperating to keep each other in government, with the opposition party being granted the chairmanship of the houses of parliament and the control bodies in exchange for forfeiting the right to call a motion of no confidence in the government, as well as agreeing to bipartisan foreign and domestic affairs ‘with preferential consideration of stability, prosperity and the position of the Czech Republic in the world’.\n\nAs you might guess, this basically meant the ČSSD got to enter government in exchange for accepting the post-neoliberal consensus and committing the Czech Republic to international cooperation. And of course it led to absolutely no more corruption in Czech politics ever."
