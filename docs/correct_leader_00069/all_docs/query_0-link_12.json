        "text": "(born 1938). A political reformer who broke with the country’s traditional ruling party, Hosokawa Morihiro served as prime minister of Japan in 1993–94. Early in his political career, he was supported by the powerful Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which had dominated Japanese politics for decades. Hosokawa eventually became opposed to one-party rule. He founded the conservative Japan New Party as an alternative to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nHosokawa was born on January 14, 1938, in Kyushu, Japan. He was the grandson of Konoe Fumimaro, who had twice served as prime minister of Japan before World War II. Hosokawa attended Sophia University, graduating in 1963. Intent on a career in journalism, he took a job with the liberal newspaper Asahi shimbun. His run in 1969 for election to the lower house of the Diet (parliament) was unsuccessful. However, in 1971, with strong support from the ruling LDP, Hosokawa was elected to the less powerful upper house. He went on to serve in the upper house of the Diet for 12 years.\n\nIn 1983 Hosokawa was elected governor of Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu island. While serving as governor, he pursued an aggressive economic policy and strengthened environmental laws. He was often frustrated, however, by the powerful bureaucracy of the central government. In 1992 Hosokawa formed the Japan New Party. He called for reform of the electoral system and an end to political corruption and one-party rule. The new party was quickly embraced by people around the country who were tired of the scandals and internal disagreements plaguing the Liberal Democrats.\n\nIn 1993 a coalition of seven dissident LDP factions and opposition parties in the House of Representatives elected Hosokawa prime minister. He was the first non-LDP prime minister of Japan since 1955. Once in office, Hosokawa got a bill passed to restructure the electoral system. It was passed in an effort to limit political corruption and increase the relative voting strength of urban areas. Hosokawa resigned in April 1994, however, when the LDP accused him of financial wrongdoing. He retired from politics in 1998 and devoted himself to making pottery."
