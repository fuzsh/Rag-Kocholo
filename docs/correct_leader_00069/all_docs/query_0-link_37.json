The small post placed in the corner of the tea ceremony room is the rare and beautiful Pseudocydonia tree. The alcove sideboard uses the red part of a Japanese black pine hand cut by machete.\n\nThe magnificent surface suits the taste of people familiar with tea ceremony. The exterior pillar is an old log used for over 30 years to dry rice stalks at an old farmhouse.\n\n\"Kakejiku\" a hanging scroll- Morihiro Hosokawa\n\n\"Yamajikite Naniyara-yukashi Sumire-kusa\"\n\n- Basho Matsuo\n\nThe scroll by Morihiro Hosokawa represents a haiku by Basho Matsuo. The poem depicts a mountain path with wild violets that signify the arrival of spring. Traditionally haiku poetry is always closely related to the season and nature. Every month, we ask Mr.Hosokawa to choose a poem and write a calligraphy.\n\nMorihiro Hosokawa\n\nBorn in 1938. former writer of Asahi Newspaper, former Member of the Diet of Japan, former Governor of Kumamoto, former Member of Japan New Party, former Prime Minister of Japan.
