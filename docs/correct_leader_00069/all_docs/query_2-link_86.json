        "text": "Former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has signaled his intention to run in the Feb 9 Tokyo gubernatorial race to replace Naoki Inose, Japanese media reported Friday.\n\nHosokawa, who turns 76 on Jan 14, served as prime minister from August 1993 to April 1994. He has been hinting all week that he might toss his hat in the ring for the governorship and run as an independent candidate. However, on Friday, the main opposition Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) said it would back Hosokawa, Fuji TV reported.\n\nHosokawa has not outlined his policies yet other than to say he is opposed to nuclear power. Fuji reported that he is planning to meet next week with former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, another outspoken opponent of nuclear power, to ask for his support.\n\nMeanwhile, the ruling Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday officially threw its support behind former health minister Yoichi Masuzoe in the election after meeting him Thursday to see if they saw eye to eye with him.\n\nParty officials said last week said the candidate they back must have three criteria -- he must have an international outlook; be an ardent leader of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic organizing committee; and be able to establish a relationship of trust with the Tokyo metropolitan assembly.\n\nCampaigning begins on Jan 23.\n\nÂ© Japan Today"
