        "text": "The exhibition is named after the “Kumamoto Artpolis”, a cultural project now in its twenty-first year which has had important Japanese architects on its commission including Arata Isozaki (1988 to 1989), Teiichi Takahashi (1989 to 2005) and Toyo Ito, in office since 2005. On a study trip to Germany, former governor Morihiro Hosokawa was impressed by an international architecture exhibition held in Berlin focusing on reconstruction of an entire region, which inspired him to organise something similar for the Japanese region of Kumamoto. A movement was established to promote development of architectural culture and inspire construction of buildings and infrastructures. The exhibition presents more than seventy photographic panels dedicated to masterpieces of contemporary Japanese architecture and underlines the strong link between architecture and culture."
