It's a big problem that we have to deal with as our own.\n\nNow, when I think of the people who are suffering in this war, I can't stay still.\n\nI have been engaged in creative activities such as calligraphy, pottery, painting, and lacquer, but I strongly believe that what I can do now is at least to paint as an artist and draw works with a wish for peace. I did. We will exhibit oil paintings such as \"Hyakuki Barbaric-My Gerniker\", which was moved by the situation in Ukraine, and also exhibited and sold works such as paintings and books that we have drawn so far, or put them in a donation box. We would like to receive donations and support the proceeds through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).\n\nWe sincerely hope that as many people as possible will support us.\n\nMorihiro Hosokawa\n\nProfile\n\nMorihiro Hosokawa\n\nBorn in Tokyo in 1938\n\n1963 Graduated from Sophia University Faculty of Law\n\nJoined Asahi Shimbun in 1963 Reporter, Social Affairs Department\n\n1971 Member of the House of Councilors\n\n1983 Governor of Kumamoto Prefecture\n\n1992 Japan New Party formed\n\n1992 Member of the House of Councilors\n\n1993 Member of the House of Representatives\n\n1993 Appointment of the 79th Prime Minister\n\n1998 Resignation of the House of Representatives\n\n1999 Started making pottery\n\nFirst solo exhibition in 2001, then held solo exhibitions in various parts of Japan, Paris, New York, etc.\n\n2009 Started painting oil paintings\n\n2012 Dedicated 8 fusuma paintings to Kyoto Jizo-in, which started producing fusuma paintings\n\n2014 Dedicated 24 paintings of four seasons to the Shoden-eigen-in Temple in Kennin-ji Temple, Kyoto\n\n2018 Dedicated Shirobunka Avatamsaka Sutra 6 songs 2 folding screens to Nara Todaiji Temple\n\n2019 Dedicated 66 eastern and western fusion barrier paintings to Nara Yakushiji Jionden\n\n2021 Dedicated 24 fusuma paintings to the Kennin-ji Temple in Kyoto Omotoyama\n\n2022 Dedicated 32 fusuma paintings of Unryu to Ryoanji Temple in Kyoto\n\n<Past related articles>\n\n[Pola Museum Annex] Group exhibition by young artists \"Pola Museum Annex 2022\" will be held from February 11, 2022 (Friday / holiday)\n\n[Pola Museum Annex] Exhibition \"1: 1\" by young artist Yuka Kashihara, who is based in Berlin until March 14th (Sun)"
