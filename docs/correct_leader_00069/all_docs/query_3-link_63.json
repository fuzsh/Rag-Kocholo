        "text": "Regarding the editorial \"Turning a new page\" in the Sept. 9 edition, I am disappointed that The Japan Times has left Shibaura, where it was an institution much like Tora-san in Shibamata. I'm disappointed because I have been studying English with the newspaper published in Minato Ward.\n\nIn fact, I visited the office once when I was a reader of the Weekly ST to attend a special meeting with former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, as reported in the Jan. 18, 1999, issue. I had a great time with the public figure and the four other readers who were invited. The Q&A session with him especially impressed me a great deal. Since then, Shibaura has been special and significant in my life. So, what a pity!\n\nThen, moving on to The Japan Times Weekly and the daily version, I have enjoyed sometimes writing my opinions about articles and contributing to The Japan Times. Whenever my letter is printed in the paper, though partly corrected, I'm on cloud nine. That leads to an incentive to write better the next time. Therefore, I have sincerely appreciated the 52-year-old office's great help.\n\nPersonally, 52 years seems kind of young, because I'm in my late 50s. I also find that this is a good time to turn a new leaf, moving to the heart of Tokyo, to let more readers know the latest news as quickly as possible. And I hope you will continue to put an emphasis on interpersonal relations, such as letters, even in the advanced digital age.\n\nYOKOHAMA\n\nThe opinions expressed in this letter to the editor are the writer's own and do not necessarily reflect the policies of The Japan Times."
