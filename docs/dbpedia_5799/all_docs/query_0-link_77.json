        "text": "Communication with the outside world is vital for the survival of any community, regardless of time and geography. This is particularly so for an island community. Lying uncomfortably on the North-South, East-West, Muslim-Christian divide of the Inland Sea in the Early Modern era, and forever wary of the threat from Barbary to the South and the Ottomans to the East, Hospitaller Malta lived in a constant state of readiness for war and in a perpetual state of dependence for subsistence on Sicily and beyond. The need to maintain open the lines of communication with the mainland of Europe, and to be constantly updated on the maritime movements of the enemy was absolutely essential for the survival of the island. The present study, based mostly on the outgoing correspondence of the various Hospitaller magistracies throughout the seventeenth century, analyses the Knights’ endeavours to keep open communication lines with foreign states and territories.\n\nThis essay is intended to be read as an overview of the insufficiently-known 17th century Mediterranean history, perceived from the perspective of contemporaneous history of Malta. The preceding 16th century had been dominated by the East-West epic clash of the Ottoman Empire with Spain of the Re-conquista, in the course of which (1530) the isolated Maltese islands were passed on to the Knights Hospitallers. The Knights barely viewed this grant with gratification, but the sequence of dramatic events that followed, gave birth to the coherent minor state of the Knights wielding a formidable naval muscle, acknowledged and respected by friends and foes. This recognition became more effective in the course of the 17th century Mediterranean interregnum, as the former two dominant powers transferred their attention outside the Mediterranean, causing a near political vacuum within which a concert of minor powers pursued their own interests. Lasting practically a century, this vacuum – and consequent interregnum - was to be swept away with asserted presence in the Mediterranean of the rising national European states.\n\nThere are a number of issues in this book published in 2017 that this review seeks to address, concerning not only the use made of historical sources, both written and visual and their juxtaposition in a publication; but also the reasons for, the aim and achievements of the Ottoman campaign to Malta in 1565, largely from \"the other side\", meaning the Ottoman perspective, different from the Christian-Modern European perspective, for, as Voltaire wrote, Nothing is better known than the siege of Malta. But what does better known actually mean in the context of the 1565 siege? From the Ottoman point of view, there was no \"siege of Malta,\" there were the 1551 and 1565 punitive campaigns undertaken against the oathbreaking Hospitaller Knights of St. John on Malta. Although repeatedly stated in the Christian accounts of the 1565 campaign from 1565 to today, there is no contemporary Ottoman evidence to indicate the aim of occupying Malta, and so to supposedly to control the Mediterranean or to control the western or central Mediterranean; nor yet, from an occupied Ottoman Malta to attack Sicily and Italy. The 1565 punitive campaign was successful, the Hospitaller headquarters was destroyed, the Knights of St John on Malta were largely dead or severely wounded and the Ottoman phased withdrawal decided in July and begun in the second week of August, was largely completed before the Christian relief force arrived on Malta. Because the Ottoman 1565 campaign aims were not known, a Christian victory was declared when Ottoman forces left the island, producing one of European history's enduring misconceptions, to rephrase Voltaire, Nothing, is perhaps better known than the Ottoman 1565 punitive campaign against the Hospitallers headquarters on Malta, when an Ottoman punitive campaign against the oath breaking Hospitaller Order on Malta has been repeatedly mis-described as the siege of Malta, when Malta was not besieged.\n\nSpies played a crucial role in early modern imperial rivalries. While past scholars have emphasized the Islam/Christendom divide in the Mediterranean, these go-betweens, who mastered the codes of both cultures, easily crossed invisible boundaries between civilizations and connected the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, two imperial powers at each other’s throat. Apart from providing both empires with regular information on political and military developments, these entrepreneur information brokers played an active diplomatic role between two capitals and even participated in Ottoman factional politics. This dissertation compares both empires’ secret services and explains the differences between the two systems of information gathering based on these empires’ differing organizational structures.

While past scholars have emphasized the Islam/Christendom divide in the Mediterranean, these go-betweens, who mastered the codes of both cultures, easily crossed invisible boundaries between civilizations and connected the Ottomans and the Habsburgs, two imperial powers at each other’s throat. Apart from providing both empires with regular information on political and military developments, these entrepreneur information brokers played an active diplomatic role between two capitals and even participated in Ottoman factional politics. This dissertation compares both empires’ secret services and explains the differences between the two systems of information gathering based on these empires’ differing organizational structures. It argues that the Habsburgs tried to institutionalize and standardize their secret services in accordance with their general efforts of bureaucratization and centralization, even though the effect of such efforts remained rather limited in the Levant. The Ottomans, on the other hand, maintained their longstanding decentralized approach and delegated the responsibility of gathering information to pashas and court favourites who established their own intelligence networks. This created a rather different situation whereby these networks served their masters’s interests rather than that of the state, thus giving the historian ample information on Ottoman factional politics. In relying on oral communication and not following the recent developments in steganography and cryptography, the Ottoman secret service was more personal than institutional. Still, the Ottoman secret service produced good results. In spite of these differences that could have been otherwise considered shortcomings and contrary to the unwarranted assumptions that prevailed in Western historiography, the Ottomans successfully developed a functional information gathering mechanism which in itself was coherent. The real factor that negatively affected the efficiency of both empires was the lack of direct diplomacy between two capitals. While both empires kept themselves informed of political developments and military preparations, they failed to develop an awareness of each other’s legal, political and economic systems as well as cultural, linguistic and religious particularities."
