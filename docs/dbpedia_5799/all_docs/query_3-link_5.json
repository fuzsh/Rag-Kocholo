        "text": "The Knights of the Military Order of Saint John in Malta\n\nThe year 1530 is when the Knights’ chapter in Malta starts. After years of not having a fixed quarters to call their home, Charles V of Spain (then ruler of Malta as King of Sicily) gave the Knights the islands of Malta and Gozo, as well as the city of Tripoli (present-day capital of Libya).\n\nWhen the Knights took hold of Malta and Gozo, the islands were seen as small and offering little resources. Although it was a step forward from having no home at all, the Knights accepted the gift of Malta because it was basically better than having no base at all.\n\nThat meant that Malta was never meant to be the Knights’ permanent home. They still hoped to one day recapture Rhodes but after the Great Siege of 1565 decided to stay in Malta and build a stronghold there.\n\nMaking do, the Order started building a naval base in Malta because they recgonised that the location meant it could prove to be a strategic value. Positioned at the centre of the Mediterranean, having a stronghold in Malta meant it could serve as a gateway between East and West and in that way support the Knights’ core missions of defense and support. In the end, they transformed Malta from a bare island to a thriving stronghold with magnificent fortifications.\n\nAlthough they were offered the key to Mdina (its then capital city), the Knights decided to settle in present-day Birgu (Vittoriosa) and improved Fort St. Angelo (which had existed in Medieval times as a castle) to be their main fortification and seat of power.\n\nThe local population initially wasn’t very enthusiastic about the intruders, with the Maltese being excluded from serving the order. However, both groups peacefully coexisted, with the Maltese recognising the protection and relative improvement in prosperity which the Knights brought along.\n\nInvasion of Gozo and loss of Tripoli\n\n1551 Proved to be an important year. Up until that point, the Knights were under constant threat from Ottoman pirates led by commander Dragut Reis (a highly skilled and successful military prowess).\n\nThe Ottomans, having allowed the remaining Knights to escape their previous stronghold of Rhodes, weren’t happy to see them re-established and developing in Malta (and Tripoli).\n\nDragut and his admiral Sinan Pasha attempted to invade Malta in 1551 with a force of 10,000 men, entering what we now refer to as Marsamxett harbour. This harbour is located on the West side of the Sciberras peninsula on which Valletta was built (although the city didn’t exist at this point in time) while the Knights in Birgu were located on the Eastside, across present-day Grand Harbour.\n\nAfter landing, the Ottoman forces marched on Birgu and Fort St. Angelo but soon realised it was too well-fortified to be taken easily.\n\nThey decided to raid and loot villages and take Mdina instead, but by the time word spread, the city was also up in arms and an attack was decided against. Meanwhile, their fleet that lay anchored at Marsamxett harbour were under attack from relief forces.\n\nChanging plans yet again, Dragut sent Sinan to attack Gozo and its citadel in the centre of the island. Although also heavily fortified, the bombardment that ensued moved local governor Gelatian de Sessa to capitulate. The Ottomans sacked the citadel, enslaved the 6,000 or so Gozitan civilians that sought protection in the citadel, and took control over the island.\n\nKnowing that it wouldn’t be long for the Ottomans to try and take Malta again, the Knights set out to fortify Fort St. Angelo and in a very short period of time (less than six months) built Fort St. Michael (at present-day Senglea, which like Birgu forms part of the Three Cities) and Fort St. Elmo across the harbour, at the tip of present-day Valletta.\n\nThat proved to be a crucial move that laid the foundation for victory in the Great Siege. Having been fortified as a strategic stronghold for the Christians, they were well aware of the big threat of the Ottomans taking control of such a strategically important location as Malta was back then."
