        "text": "Fort Ricasoli\n\nKalkara, Malta\n\nThe Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (or Knights Hospitaller or Knights of St. John, because either one takes two minutes less to say than The Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem), was a Catholic order that began in the 11th century in Jerusalem. As the word \"hospital\" suggests, they were dedicated to caring for and protecting pilgrims to the holy land. When that holy land was scooped up by the Fatimid Caliphate in 1099, the Knights took on a more militant role. They moved their base of operations to the Greek island of Rhodes, where they fought off various hordes of Barbary pirates, Egyptians and Ottomans.\n\nIn 1522 the Knights were violently ejected from Rhodes by Ottman Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1494-1566), after which they bonked around in Europe for a few years. Finally, Pope Clement VII (1478-1534), himself a Knight of the order in question, cut a deal with Spain's King Charles I for a new Knightly home, and the Knights of Many Names added another title: The Knights of Malta.\n\nWhich it appeared to be for quite some time! The Ottomans weren't fans of these Christain barbarians setting up shop in what the Turks considered to be their stomping (splashing) grounds, and sent naval commander Turgut Reis (1485-1565) with 10,000 men to dislodge the Knights from Malta in 1551, which endeavor met with little success. The Knights had restored a dilapidated fort that had been left by Malta's previous occupants (Angevins? Aragonese?), named it Fort St. Angelo, and used it to hold out long enough for Turgut and his doodz to give up and head north to Gozo, Malta's northern island, to seek easier pickings.\n\nDuring the Great Siege, the Ottomans had built an artillery battery on Gallows' Point, to fire on Fort St. Elmo. St. Elmo had been captured by the Turks in the fracas, so it was plain that something had to be built to defend Gallows' Point. The Knights constructed San Petronio Battery, a semi-circular affair, on Gallows' Point in 1602, and added Torre San Petronio, a tower, in 1629. The tower and battery were surrounded by a sea-filled ditch and had a drawbridge: Defensible!\n\nIn 1669, the Venetian city of Candia, on Crete, fell to the Turks. Crete is a mere 585 miles from Malta as the seagull flies, so the Knights felt it incumbent upon themselves to add to Valletta's fortifications. Italian military engineer Maurizio Valperga (1605-1688) arrived on Malta in 1670, and immediately began plans for Valletta's new defenses. He laid the first stone in a nearly three-mile-long wall that was intended to protect all of Valletta, which fortification needed an anchor on Gallows' Point: How about a starfort, he pondered?\n\nEnough of the fort had been completed by June of 1674 to install a \"skeleton garrison,\" which was a small army of skeletons animated by stop-motion photography. Construction dragged on long enough for new engineers to show up on Malta, make sour faces at the progress, and make grand, sweeping improvement suggestions. One of these was Flemish architect Carlos de Grunenbergh (d. 1696), whose 1681 improvements for Fort Ricasoli and several other of Valletta's fortifications were implemented. In May of 1698, Fort Ricasoli was declared finished, fully armed, and ready for someone to come and attack it.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century the original mission of the Order of St. John, holding the line against the Ottomans, had become pass√©. The Knights had become less of an independent entity, and much more financially dependant on France. Enter the French Revolution, which started doing its thing in 1789: When France's monarchy went out the window, so did France's support for the Knights. So here we had a very fortified island bastion in a very desirable place for seafaring nations, with a very weak ownership. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nMany of the Knights of St. John left Malta and were given a new home by Russia's Emperor Paul I (1754-1801). The Maltese were initially relieved to be rid of the Knights, but the French swiftly revealed themselves to be even more obnoxious overlords, and within three months the Maltese rose against the French. With some assistance from Britain and Portugal, the Maltese soon secured the majority of their island, but the French remained ensconced in most of Valletta's starforts...including Fort Ricasoli. Once Britain's Royal Navy had destroyed the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile (August 1, 1798), they were at liberty to sail to Malta and see what they could do about the 3,000 Frenchmen thereupon.\n\nFinally, having eaten everything consumable, and losing over 100 men a day from disease and starvation, the French surrendered in September of 1800. The Maltese offered their island to the British Empire, and 1814's Treaty of Paris made it official. British troops were all over the island prior to this, however, which leads us to Fort Ricosoli's next newsworthy event.\n\nThe Froberg Regiment was a unit of the British army that had been founded in 1803, specifically for service on Malta. It recruited men from various European countries, and included Poles, Albanians, Germans, Russians, Greeks, Swiss and Bulgarians. The process by which men were enticed into service with the British army were notoriously shady, but the Froberg Regiment apparently brought this art to new heights of underhandedness...or it may have been no worse than any incoming British soldier experienced, but with the added confusion of language barriers. Promised high rank and good pay, the men of the Froberg Regiment found themselves toiling as privates in the Maltese sun, for little pay.\n\nThere followed a tense week in which the mutineers, holding several officers, British soldiers and their families hostage in Fort Ricasoli, threatened to fire upon Valletta unless they were provided with money, food, safe passage off of Malta, etc. Each of these demands was studiously ignored, and over time the increasingly hungry mutineers did their best to bargain, eventually releasing all of their hostages, hoping that someone would pay attention to them. Nobody did, so most of the mutineers decided to un-mutinize and scampered from the fort. The remaining, hardcore mutineers fired on Valletta on April 10, causing no injuries. The authorities finally got around to sending 40 guys into Fort Ricasoli to take it back shortly thereafter, during which adventure six mutineers managed to blow the fort's powder magazine. Mission accomplished! The mutineers were rounded up and done away with, as befits mutineers.\n\n500 men garrisoned Fort Ricasoli in the 1840's, and starting in the 1850's higher caliber guns were installed on a regular basis. Improvements were made as well, and by the early 1900's our starfort bristled with searchlights, new gun emplacements and a torpedo station.\n\nAn Italian Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero (Sparrow) over Valletta in 1941. Fort St. Elmo is directly under the bomber, and Fort Ricasoli is visible at top right. The SM.79 holds the honor of being the first type of aircraft to have crashed in flames on Malta!\n\nIn the interest of effing with the British, Italy and Germany bombed Valletta during the Second World War (1939-1945). Fort Ricasoli's guns helped to deter an Italian attack in July of 1941, and in April of the following year the Luftwaffe destroyed the fort's Governor's House and main gate. Despite this wanton destruction, the British managed to hang onto Malta through the war.\n\nThe Royal Navy took possession of Fort Ricasoli in 1947, rechristening it the HMS Ricasoli. This \"starship\" served as a barracks for naval personnel until 1958. As soon as everybody was allowed to call it a \"fort\" again, Fort Ricasoli's main gate was reconstructed in 1958, though no effort was made to make it resemble the original gate.\n\nMalta became an independent state in 1964, and Fort Ricasoli was abandoned. The ditch along the fort's landward side was soon filled with giant tanks to process liquid waste from ships, so as to make those liquids safe to dump into the sea. In the 1970's the St. Dominic demibastion, which had been damaged during the Froberg Rebellion, was further damaged by being breached to make a road into the fort. This facility is now run by the romantically-named Waste Oils Co. Ltd.\n\nIn the 21st century, Fort Ricasoli's interior has been used to represent ancient Rome, Troy and Alexandria in the movies Gladiator (2000), Troy (2004) and Agora (2009). The fort also stood in for the Red Keep in the first season of the wildly popular Game of Thrones."
