        "text": "ok, this question is from a discussion ive had with a freind who reenacts a late 13th century (1280's -1300/ until the dissolution of the templars) brother knight of the order of the knights templar\n\nthe contention arises in this form.\n\ndid the order of the knights templar continually (as was considered economically feasable) upgrade the armour of their knights in particular with the development and adoption of plate defences like knee cops and poleyns, coats of plates, etc\n\nhe seems particularly interested in vambraces aka lower arm defenses\n\nhis argument is that as the knights templar, due to their monastic vows of poverty and austerity, resisted buying new forms of defence and only those they DID use would have been bought second hand or have been hand me downs, or the knights simply fighting with what equipment they could use\n\n(such as wearing older helmets, more rudimentary forms of the coat of plates etc and perhaps even older styles of great helm, perhaps knights from the 1290's would maybe wear nasel helms, transitional greathelms, or those styles of helm from the macejowski bible even instead of helms like the dargen greathelm\n\ni have contended that while i agree that none of their armour would have been lavishly decorated with inlays or rich fabrics. i do believe they as a military force would have acted in a proffessional manner and ensured their forces were well equipped to a reasonable degree as circumstances called for sch changes\n\nwhat evidence do we have of how the knights templar organised and resupplied their forces\n\ni know of one artistic source showing a knights templar with maille in the regular style with hard elbow cops, knee cops and even ailletes but those im skeptical of their accuracy depending on who the artist was. https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cd/76/60/cd7660d1e590c2d208a1539fc3626ee9.jpg\n\nalso, as an aside im interested for myself to ask about the orders recruitment and how they maintained/ if they maintained a dedicated infantry force... what information do we have about them, oganisation, equipment etc\n\nQuote: 102. The Marshal should have at his command all the arms of the house:\n\nthose bought to give to the brothers of the convent as gifts, alms, or booty.....\n\nIt seems likely that purchased arms might be functional, but less expensive versions. For example, a pair of plates would be covered in fustian rather than velvet. Gifts, such as arms left from wills might be slightly outdated, but still functional. A rich armour given as alms might be sold to buy two less decorated versions. Booty acquired from battle might include items of mail, or simple helmets. The regulation also provides for Turkish arms and crossbows to be passed down to the segeants and infantry.\n\nIt's perhaps best to think of Templar Arms as \"government issue\". Each knight is responsible for maintaining what he was issued, but the house maintains the right to take it back and reissue it at will. As long as the armor remained functional, it would have seen use, but this doesn't preclude the purchase or acceptance of more modern pieces of gear, as long as they are modest. ferrum ferro acuitur et homo exacuit faciem amici sui From what I've read about the Hospitaller's time on Rhodes, much of their arms and armor were either hand-me-downs or purchased from Italy (most likely from Genoa, as they were frequently at odds with Venice).\n\nSo, probably not the latest-and-greatest, but whatever they can get a a good price, and whatever they still have that is still serviceable (waste not, want not, after all). There was still a hierarchy within the Orders, so I'd wager a high-ranking knight, or the one in charge of a wealthy commandry would have newer and nicer equipment than a lower knight who didn't have his own commandry, who'd have nicer equipment than a lowly sergeant. Now, a lay brother, who only joined up for a pre-determined short period of time and never took the full vows, I'd wager they'd likely just use their personal equipment from their secular life.\n\nWilliam P wrote: also, as an aside im interested for myself to ask about the orders recruitment and how they maintained/ if they maintained a dedicated infantry force... what information do we have about them, oganisation, equipment etc\n\nI may be wrong about that, but as far as I know, the Templars were an elite force exclusively dedicated to the heavy cavalry. They didn't need infantry because, in general, their role was to reinforce a already existing crusader army, which, on the other hand, had their own infantry. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if sergeants sometimes dismounted to fought as heavy infantry if the occasion demanded.\n\nAbout recruitment: do you like Game of Thrones? The Night's Watch has some inspiration on Templars. Knights who had been convicted of crimes such as murder, assaulting travelers in roads, heresy (if they repented), or other illegal activity could escape from a death penalty or loss of their chivalric status joining the Templars. I don't know if the Teutonics and Hospitallers also did this kind of recruitment, but recruiting ex-robber barons were a nice way to increase their numbers. Of course, this also decreases their respect in homeland Europe: Saint Bernard de Claivaux, the creator of the Order's Rule, even compares them to Apostle Paul (in the sense that they abandoned their activities that usually molested christian people to do something \"greater\". From persecutors of the God's people to heroes (now they stopped being a trouble for local lords to do even worse in muslim's lands) .\n\nAbout other forms of recruitment, they were done in Europe itself. Knights and other nobles invited to join the Order, offering indulgences for their service. Like other monks, they were organized in Priories: even Ireland had Templar's Priories. There they got both financial means and soldiery material for their purposes. In Portugal it was also common for Kings to give lands, castles, outposts and piories as rewards for their service in the Reconquista. Some people call Military Orders' government over these lands as some kind of \"alternative feudalism\". Military Orders also composed the main forces at the marches, where christian lands found muslim ones.\n\nAbout equipment, I don't know much, but by Crusades' time, someone could get a plenary indulgence by simply giving money, armour and weapons to a crusader. I think local counts and barons would usually give armour to Military Orders too, but I can't say it actually happened. Also, coats-of-plates start appearing by 1250-1260's. Here you can see a templar wearing one:\n\nSource: Expositio in Apocalypsim', Cambridge MS Mm.5.31, fo.139r, Bremen, 1249-1250"
