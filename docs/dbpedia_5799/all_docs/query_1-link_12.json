        "text": "This series of three articles addresses the question, to what extent the ancient Order of Knights of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem, also known as Knights Hospitaller, has one or more modern surviving entities.\n\nOriginally, the Knights Hospitaller were a medieval religious Order (Merriam-Webster: a group of people united in a formal way), but gradually, its military dimension became more dominant. The Knights Hospitaller had their headquarters in Jerusalem until 1291 (after the fall of Jerusalem), on Rhodes from 1310 until 1522, on Malta from 1530 until 1798 and in Saint Petersburg from 1799 until 1803. Today, several organizations continue the Hospitaller tradition, and many claim to be a legitimate continuation of the medieval Knights Hospitaller.\n\nHistorical background\n\nIn order to understand the context of the formation of the Knights Hospitaller, this article summarizes Jerusalem’s history since Alexander the Great (356–323 BC).\n\nHellenic period\n\nJerusalem fell under Hellenistic control and influence when Alexander the Great conquered the region in 332 BC. During the Hellenic period, Jerusalem was a prosperous and independent city, which had the status of a polis (city-state). It had a measure of autonomy in managing its own affairs and was known as “Haga Polis”.\n\nRoman period\n\nIn 37 BC, Jerusalem was captured by Herod the Great (c. 72–4 or 1 BC), a Jewish vassal-king of the Romans, who ruled Judea. Herod rebuilt Jerusalem as a pagan city after the destruction in the First Jewish-Roman War (66–73). In the two centuries that the city was under Roman control, it remained a relatively unimportant pagan Roman town.\n\nByzantine (Eastern Roman Empire) period\n\nEmperor Constantine the Great (272–337) rebuilt Jerusalem as the center of Christianity. His major building project was the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, started around 326 by replacing an ancient temple near his church. After the temple was torn down and its ruins removed, the soil was removed from the cave, revealing a rock-cut tomb that was identified by Constantin’s mother as the burial site of Jesus.\n\nPersian period\n\nIn 614, during the Byzantine–Persian war (602–628), Jerusalem was captured by the Persians. The conquest of Jerusalem was a violent military operation that involved a mass killing of the local Christian population. However, all excavated sites in Jerusalem show a clear pattern of continuity, with no evidence of destruction by the Persian conquest of 614 or the Arab conquest of 636. In 630, Jerusalem was under Byzantine control again and the True Cross, which was taken by the Persians was returned, although not everybody believes that this was the original item (Constantin Zuckerman, “Heraclius and the return of the Holy Cross,” Travaux et mémoires 17 (2013), 197-218).\n\nEarly Muslim period\n\nBy the end of the Byzantine–Persian war, both sides had very little resources left and were vulnerable. The Muslim armies of the Islamic Rashidun Caliphate, the first caliphate to succeed the prophet Muhammad, took advantage of the vacuum and rapidly conquered the entire Sasanian Empire as well large Byzantine territories, including Jerusalem. The city is important to Islam as it is the last place the Prophet Muhammad visited before he ascended to the heavens and talked to God. The historical sources emphasize the fact that Jerusalem was not stormed in a violent invasion but rather surrendered peacefully to the Islamic forces. Christian communities remained active in the city throughout the Early Muslim period. By the middle of the 10th century, most of the population of Jerusalem was still Christian. Throughout the Early Muslim period (from 637–638 until 1099) Jerusalem retained a sizable Christian majority, and the city prospered.\n\nIn 1009, the (“mad”) caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah (985– vanished 1021) destroyed the hospital and three thousand other buildings in Jerusalem, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1023, caliph Ali az-Zahir (1005-1036) granted merchants from Amalfi and Salerno permission to rebuild the hospital in Jerusalem, in order to improve relations with Byzantium and the Christian subjects. Also, he allowed the rebuilding of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which was carried out by workmen, who were sent by Constantine IX (c. 1004-1055). Around 1080, Gérard de Martigues, a lay brother in the Benedictine Order, started managing the hospital of Saint John in Jerusalem. Its purpose was to provide medical aid to pilgrims, and it included infirmaries, a clothing store, a church and an altar, a kitchen area, toilets, storerooms and stables. The hospital was built on the site of the Monasteries of Saint John the Baptist in the 1060s. It was an addition to a hospice that was rebuilt in the 1020s. What the hospitaller’s relationship to the two Benedictine monasteries, which were located on the same site as separate male and female institutions, is still unknown (see: Heinzelmann, D. and J. Krüger. The beginnings of the Order of Saint John in Jerusalem, or: Muristan revisited, Medievalista [Online], 30 | 2021; DOI: https://doi.org/10.4000/medievalista.4494).\n\nIn 1099, during the First Crusade under Godfrey of Bouillon, the Crusaders (consisting of nobles, knights and peasants) conquered Jerusalem from the Muslim Fatimid Caliphate. This created the foundation of the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem, which lasted almost two centuries. The siege led to the mass slaughter of thousands of Muslims and Jews and to the conversion of Muslim holy sites on the Temple Mount into Christian shrines. Since then, Palestine was in Christian hands. In addition to the most important holy sites such as the tomb of Jesus Christ, the Crusaders controlled the entire eastern shore of the Mediterranean with their cities and castles.\n\nDevelopment of the Order\n\nThere is much misconception regarding the transformation from Hospitallers to a recognized Order. Wikipedia states that the 1113 Papal Bull “Piae postulatio voluntatis” (English: the most pious request) “formally recognized the establishment of the Knights Hospitaller and confirmed its independence and sovereignty“. Professor Van Winter (Geestelijke ridderorden, organisatorisch met elkaar vergeleken Winter, Johanna Maria van. (1998) – In: Virtus. Bulletin van de Werkgroep Adelsgeschiedenis vol. 5 (1998) pp. 48-58) claims that the Bull granted the Hospitallers the right to choose their own “Grandmaster”. However, both claims are incorrect, as the text of the Bull immediately shows (see Appendix). An authoritative article by professor Hiestand confirms that the Bull only contains a general and common protection declaration, the (also common) right to freely elect its president and a tax exemption (Hiestand, Rudolf. (1980) Die Anfänge der Johanniter. In: Die geistlichen Ritterorden Europas, p. 50). It is not known when the Hospitallers first developed their military dimension. The first known military appearance was in 1136 when the Hospitallers were given land to fortify and defend Beit Jibrin, a village between Gaza and Hebron. Since the end of the 1140s, the Hospitallers (directly or with the aid of visiting warriors) defended the Crusader states and engaged in contracts to protect Latin strongholds and pilgrims (see: Hiestand, 1980, p. 70). Soon this military function overshadowed the original nursing purpose of the Hospitallers. Contrary to popular belief, it was not before the end of the 12th century, that the hospital was recognized as an Order (Hiestand, p. 64). At the time, it held over 20 strongholds in the Holy Land, including the Krak des Chevaliers, a medieval castle in Syria, first inhabited in the 11th century by the Kurdish military.\n\nIn 1187, Jerusalem was reconquered by Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb (“Righteousness of the Faith, Joseph, Son of Job”), also called al-Malik al-Nāṣir Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn Yūsuf I, or Saladin (1137/38-1193). Saladin was the Muslim sultan of Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Palestine, and the founder of the Ayyūbid dynasty. The victory over the Christians made him a famous Muslim hero.\n\nWhen Saladin entered Jerusalem, it was full of refugees and had few defenders. The worst was expected after Saladin’s mass slaughter of the Templars and Hospitallers, following the battle of Hattin (1187). However, Saladin’s treatment of prisoners was generous. He paid the ransom for thousands of poor Christians and let them go free (William J. Hamblin, Muslim Perspectives on the Military Orders during the Crusades, BYU Studies Quarterly, Vol.40:4, 2001).\n\nThe fall of Jerusalem was not the end of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The capital moved first to Tyre (currently Lebanon) and later to Acre (now Israel), which was recaptured from Saladin during the Third Crusade. When Saladin failed to pay the first installment of the ransom for the prisoners on schedule, king Richard I (the Lionheart) ordered that all 2.700 members of the Muslim garrison be marched outside the city and executed in view of Saladin and his army. Saladin responded by massacring most of his Christian hostages. This abhorrent action is one of the many reasons why Richard I has been viewed as irresponsible and hot-tempered by modern historians and scholars.\n\nIn Jerusalem, Saladin restored Muslim holy sites and generally showed tolerance towards Christians. He allowed Orthodox and Eastern Christian pilgrims to visit the holy sites freely — though Frankish pilgrims were required to pay a fee for entry. The control of Christian affairs in the city was handed over to the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nIn 1291, Acre came under assault of the Mamluks, descendants of slave-warriors who had been recruited (or enslaved) in various regions of the world, including the Balkans and East Asia. The Mamluks became a powerful military force in the Islamic world, establishing their own dynasty which ruled Egypt and Syria from the mid-13th Century. The era of Saladin’s great Ayyubid Dynasty was over. The Crusaders now had to deal with an even worse enemy, who was determined to drive the Christians out of the Middle East. After a chaotic and violent battle, Acre came into Muslim hands and Christian rule ended (John D. Hosler. The Siege of Acre, 1189-1191: Saladin, Richard the Lionheart, and the Battle That Decided the Third Crusade. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2018). The historian Abū al-Fidāʾ (1273-1331) – a descendant of Saladin’s nephew Taqi al-Din ‘Umar and one of the last Ayyubid rulers to be tolerated by the Mamluk sultans – stated that the region was purified of the Franks and the whole of Palestine was now in Muslim hands:\n\nThe descent of the Islamic armies upon [Acre] occurred in the first days of Jumada I of this year (AH 690, May 1291). The fighting became fierce; the Franks had not closed most of their gates, but rather they were open, with [the Franks] fighting in them. The location of the troops from Hamah was at the head of the right wing, according to their custom. We were beside the sea, with the sea on our right as we faced Acre. Ships bearing wooden vaulting covered with ox hides would come at us, shooting at us with arrows and [crossbow] bolts, so that there was fighting [coming] from in front of us, from the direction of the city, and from our right, from the sea. They brought up a ship upon which was a mangonel that shot at us and our tents from the direction of the sea, and we suffered hardship until one night strong galeforce winds arose, the ship was caught up and sank because of the waves, and the mangonel that was in it was broken in such a way that it was shattered and was not set up [again] after that.\n\nDuring the time of the siege, the Franks came out by night and took the army by surprise. They routed the sentries and reached the tents, getting entangled in the guy-ropes. One of their knights fell into the latrine of one of the emirs and was killed there. The [Muslim] troops came to outnumber them, and the Franks fled, defeated, to the city. The troops of Hamah killed a number of them, and when morning came al-Malik al-Muzaffar, the lord of Hamah, hung a number of the Franks’ heads on the necks of the horses that the soldiers had taken from them and took them to the sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf [Khalil].\n\nThe [Muslim] troops’ attack on Acre became more aggressive until God, be He exalted, gave them its conquest by the sword on Friday, 17 Jumada II (17 June). When the Muslims stormed into [the city], some of its people fled in ships. Within the city were a number of towers that were resisting like citadels, which a large number of Franks entered and fortified themselves within. The Muslims killed [many people] and took in Acre a quantity of plunder greater than can be reckoned. Then the sultan called for the surrender of all who were resisting in the towers, and not one person hesitated. Then he issued orders regarding them, and they were beheaded, to the last man, around Acre. Then he gave orders regarding the city of Acre, and it was torn down to the ground and completely demolished.\n\nA wondrous thing is the coincidence that the Franks took control of Acre, taking it from Salah al-Din (Saladin) at noon on Friday, 17 Jumada II 587 (12 July 1191), capturing the Muslims who were in it and then killing them, and God, be He glorified and exalted, with His advance knowledge decreed that it should be conquered in this year (690/1291) on Friday, 17 Jumada II, at the hand of the sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Salah al-Din; its conquest was similar to the day that the Franks took possession of it, and likewise the laqabs of the sultans.\n\nSource: ‘Imad al-Din Isma‘il ibn ‘Ali, known as Abu’l-Fida’.

Cairo: Dar al-Ma‘arif, Vol. 4, pp. 34–35.\n\nCyprus, Rhodes and Malta\n\nAfter the fall of Acre, the Hospitallers moved to Cyprus, and in 1310, after more than four years of war, to Rhodes, which was in Byzantine hands. Rhodes remained the last Christian outpost in the East for more than two centuries. Rhodes stood halfway between Istanbul and Cairo as well as midway between Syria and Greece. It stood in the way of Ottoman communication and maritime commerce. During their residence on Rhodes, the Hospitallers were also referred to as the Knights of Rhodes. During this period, the knights withstood five invasions: four by the Egyptian Mamluks in 1440, 1444, 1457, 1469 and another in 1480 by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror, who captured Constantinople and conquered the territories in Anatolia and the Balkans that constituted the Ottoman Empire’s heartland for the next four centuries.\n\nIn 1522, after a second war, Ottoman sultan Süleyman the Magnificent, conquered Rhodes with an army of 400 ships and 100.000 men against 6.700 knights, soldiers, peasants, fishermen and women. The terms of the surrender were considered reasonable by the people of Rhodes: (i) the Knights would leave the island within 12 days; (ii) weapons and armory would be allowed to leave with them; (iii) other islanders were offered a time period of three years to leave the island; (iv) no churches would be destroyed or converted into mosques; (v) those remaining would not be subject to Ottoman tax for five years. After the departure of the knights, Süleyman broke his promises. He had thousands of the local civilians killed, plundered the city and converted local churches into mosques.\n\nFor seven years, the Knights were without a head quarters, but in 1530 Pope Clement VII reached an agreement with Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, also King of Spain and Sicily, to grant the knights the island of Malta. This was not acceptable for sultan Süleyman. In 1565, he sent a military force of about 40.000 men to conquer Malta, defended by 700 knights and 8.000 soldiers. Süleyman’s goal was to create a new base from which he could launch another assault on Europe. After months of attacks, the Ottomans were on the brink of success when a small force of knights attacked the Ottoman camp. Thinking that the knights had Spanish reinforcements, their commander ordered the retreat and the advantage was lost. The Ottoman forces regrouped and prepared for a long battle. At that moment, the news arrived that a Christian relief force had landed on the north coast of the island. The Ottoman troops retreated, but the forces clashed and less than half of the Ottoman forces managed to escape. The battle ended in a disaster for the Ottomans and the Christian world became aware that the Ottoman expansion could be halted.\n\nUnder the knight’s rule, Malta flourished for centuries, however on the backs of innocent men, women and children (see: Fontenay, M., 2001. The slave market in Malta at the time of the Knights of Saint John of Jerusalem (1530-1798). Quaderni storici. 36. 391-413). Valetta, founded by the knights, would later become Christianity’s biggest slave trading city in the Mediterranean:\n\nThe institution of slavery formed one of the pillars of the economic fabric of the Order. Slaves were first and foremost a fruitful source of labour. They were employed as rowers in the galleys, as artisans in the manufacture of cotton sail-cloth and as labourers on the land works. In 1635, for instance, as many as 600 slaves were employed in such works in the towns of Valletta and Senglea alone. Their manumission was a good source of income; thus the money accruing to the Order in 1789 from the ransom of slaves amounted to over £1,600 out of a total state revenue of over £136,000. Slaves were sold, bartered, lent or donated as gifts. In the seventeenth century, for instance, the British Navy contemplated the acquisition of slaves from Malta for the manning of its ships in the Mediterranean. In 1662 one hundred slaves were made over to His Holiness the Pope for his naval squadron. In 1720 the Grandmaster again presented forty slaves to the Pope as the Order’s share towards the contribution of 150 Moslem slaves demanded by the Sultan to allow the Christians to repair the cupola of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. Female slaves were donated to the Vice-reine of Naples on several occasions between 1637 and 1655.\n\nCassar P. A medical service for slaves in Malta during the rule of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Med Hist. 1968 Jul;12(3):270-7. doi: 10.1017/s0025727300013314. PMID: 4875614; PMCID: PMC1033829, p. 271.\n\nAnd:\n\nNo age was exempt from captivity in the bitter and incessant war between Christian and Moslem which came to an end, as far as the Knights of st. John were concerned, as recently as the close of the eighteenth century. For example, one comes across documents in the Order’s archives in Malta recording the enslavement of children from the age of two years onwards and of adults as old as seventy years and also mothers with their babies. Most of these slaves presented a sore spectacle at the time of capture which usually occurred after a fight at close quarters. Thus the injuries and diseases of 109 slaves captured by the knights in 1665 included fire-arms burns, cuts from swords and knives, lacero-contused wounds produced by musket balls and stones, mutilated fingers and wrists; ringworm of the scalp, naevi in the chest and face, squints, abscesses and ‘signs of plague’ in the thigh. There was also a youth with ‘tremors in his hands’.1 In another batch of slaves there were several with scars of smallpox, one with a speech defect and a hunchback. In 1685 an official of the Order complained that out of sixty slaves reaching the Island, twenty-four were found incapable of rowing in the galleys as they were either sick or maimed.\n\nCassar P. A medical service for slaves in Malta during the rule of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. Med Hist. 1968 Jul;12(3):270-7. doi: 10.1017/s0025727300013314. PMID: 4875614; PMCID: PMC1033829. p. 270.\n\nThe Knights of Malta formed their own pirate fleet which would become the biggest Christian privateer fleet in the Mediterranean. Like the Barbary States (Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli), the Knights of Malta became a uncivilized pirate state, which was eventually cleansed in 1798 by emperor Napoléon Bonaparte.\n\nSlavery was abolished in Malta by Napoléon during his invasion of Malta on 16 June 1798. He introduced radical health and education reforms intended to align Malta’s administration to the new revolutionary ideology of the French republic. Fifteen primary schools were founded and the university was replaced by an ‘Ecole centrale’. All feudal rights and privileges were abolished. A new administration was created with a Government Commission, and twelve municipalities were formed. In addition, twelve judges were nominated and public finance administration was arranged (Dictionnaire Napoléon, (ed. J. Tulard), Fayard, 1989, pp. 1125-6).\n\nDuring the 16th century Protestant Reformation, large numbers of German Knights converted to Lutheranism. This did not go well with the Order’s Grandmaster, Jean de la Cassière. In 1581, he formally summoned the chief of the German branch, Martin Count of Hohenstein, to the Chapter in Malta. Hohenstein did not appear, and De la Cassière declared the exclusion of the Brandenburg members from the Order. This constituted a Protestant split-off within the Order, the Johanniter Order.\n\nEnd of the Order\n\nOn 11 August 1790, the French National Assembly “decreed that those tithes possessed by secular and religious bodies, including the Maltese and other religious and military orders, were to be abolished;” (Cavaliero, pp. 184-185). The seizure of property included the commandery of Manosque (currently Département Alpes-de-Haute-Provence), which was the spiritual heart of the Knights Hospitaller, where Gerard, founder of the Order, was buried and a lamp had been maintained for centuries (Frederick W. Ryan, 1930, p. 174).\n\nAfter Napoleon’s taking of Malta, the Order was scattered and dissolved. A large number of refugee knights took shelter in Saint Petersburg, which was a logical step. Already in 1698, Tsar Peter had sent delegations and diplomats to Hospitaller Malta to negotiate a Russo-Maltese alliance against the Ottoman empire. In the 1760s a Russian diplomat was installed in Malta and the famous fleet of the Order was used by Russian officers for training. Malta and the Order played an important role in Tsarina Catherine’s politics: Malta was to serve as a bridgehead for a permanent Russian presence in the Mediterranean. In 1768, a plan was drawn up for a joint Russo-Maltese naval attack on the Greek mainland. Officially, France remained the main protector of the Order’s neutrality, so until the end of the Ancien régime the Order did not risk an open alliance with Russia. In the long run, Tsarina Catherine’s insistence had paved the way for extremely close Russo-Maltese relations to come when her son Paul became tsar.\n\nAfter the loss of Malta, the Grandmaster of the Order, Ferdinand von Hompesh, sought Russia’s protection and financial backing.\n\nTsar Paul I, was pleased with the offer, which would allow him to strengthen his positions in the Mediterranean and set himself up as a defender of Catholics and Europe’s aristocracy. The two parties signed an agreement making the Orthodox Tsar the Grand Prior of the Catholic order. From a number of documents, it is obvious that Von Hompesch and the Order were most grateful to have found a European power which could afford them protection against the emerging Napoléon, and continue the foreign policy that had been planned before by Grandmaster De Rohan. In a letter written on 5 February 1798, the Grandmaster thanked the Tsar again for accepting the Protectorate of the Order (letters published in: Bonnici, A. (1999). Grand Master Fra Ferdinand von Hompesch and postal history. The PSM journal, 28(1), 3-3, pp. 28-29).\n\nThe ceremony was held on 29 November 1798. The Knights, wore black robes and hats with white feathers. They gathered in the throne hall of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Russian historian and journalist Evgeny Karnovich (1823-1885) described the ceremony:\n\nCount Giulio de Litta, on behalf of the Maltese knighthood, asked the Tsar to assume the title of Grandmaster. After that, Prince Kurakin and Count Kutaisov threw a black velvet mantle lined with ermine over the emperor’s shoulders, and Litta, kneeling, presented him with the crown of the Grand Master, which the emperor put on his head. Litta then presented him with a sword – or ‘dagger of faith’. Accepting the regalia of the new power, the Emperor was greatly excited, and those present noticed that tears of pleasure appeared in his eyes. Having drawn the sword of the Grandmaster, he crossed himself with it, giving this sign an oath of observance of the order’s statutes. At the same moment, all the knights drew their swords and shook them in the air, as if threatening the enemies of the order.\n\nЕвгений Петрович Карнович, Мальтийские рыцари в России, Историческая повесть из времен императора Павла I\n\nOn 21 July 1799 (Ukase 19.044), Tsar Paul I instituted “everywhere and forever” 20 hereditary “Family Commanders” chosen from the most illustrious families of the Russian nobility. In the following years, four hereditary commanders were added to the list:\n\nIn 1800, the Russian Grand Priory numbered about four hundred knights and ladies. The Catholic Grand Priory was much smaller, and numbered only about two hundred members.\n\nAfter Tsar Paul’s death in 1801, his son Tsar Alexander I, did not succeed him as Grandmaster but remained its Protector until 1803, while Prince Nikolay Ivanovich Saltykov was Lieutenant Grandmaster of the Order from 1801 to 1803 on behalf of Tsar Alexander. Tsar Alexander did not assume the title of Grandmaster. The reasons for this decision are of a complex political matter, although as head of a sovereign state, he was perfectly authorised to do so, regardless of the Order’s internal statutes (Hoegen Dijkhof has a dissenting opinion, see: pp. 180-182).:\n\n“Russia is a European power” was Empress Catherine’s II credo and programme. Although generally ignored in modern research on malta and the Order of St. John, her Maltese policy as of major importance. Catherine’s foreign policy concentrated on peace with the major Western powers and aggressive moves towards the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In two wars against the Ottomans, the Russians won the Crimean peninsula and most of the northern coast of the Black Sea. Besides perceiving the strategic importance of a Russian fleet in the Mediterranean, the tsarina also became interested in the economic benefits of such an extension of Russian interests. Malta and the Order of St. John played an important role in Catherine’s plan. A Russian charge d’affaires was installed in Malta and the Order’s famous fleet was used by Russian officers as a training base. In 1768, in the course of secret negotiations, a plan was drawn up for a joint Russo-Maltese naval attack on the Greek mainland then occupied by the Turks. But the Russian proposal to Malta to use the island as a base for future operations apparently brought about the united opposition of the Mediterranean powers as well as of the British. Diplomacy at this time indicates that, even in such a “holy war” against their infidel arch-enemy, which would have perfectly tallied with its statutes, the Order of St. John could no longer act freely. This is clearly shown when the grand master received a note from Louis XV proposed by the Duke de Choiseul expressing the king’s deep discontent with the Order’s involvement in Russia’s ambitions. The French even threatened to confiscate the property of the Order in France should the Knights of Malta insist in joining the Russian forces. So until the ancien regime in France came to its end, the Order did not risk an open alliance with Russia. But in the long run, Catherine’s insistence had paved the way for extremely close Russo-Maltese relations later. The Order’s balanced policy and neutrality were abandoned in July 1797 when German Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch came to power and in August 1797 when Catherine’s son Tsar Paul I was officially acclaimed as the Order’s protector. To what extent it was political reasoning and calculated foresight (questions of strategic Mediterranean policies, symbolic loyalty to an Order which stood for the traditional values of the ancien regime), or just irrationality and romantic sentiments which made Paul such a fervent defender of the Order of St. John, is hard to determine. The fact is that when in October 1798 Paul was proclaimed the new Grand Master of the Order of Malta, a new pinnacle of Russo-Maltese relations had been reached. But by that date, Malta already had been lost to the French. Paul’s early death left many questions open. Whatever his reasons were for accepting the title of Grand Master, even had he lived longer there would have been very little hope of regaining Malta. His double role as tsar and Grand Master would have constituted an insurmountable obstacle in allowing the Order to regain sovereignity over the island. A new Europe shaped by the concept of national states would have prevented the Order from regaining its European possessions anyway. Tsar Alexander’s I decision to refuse the title of the grand master and to keep a distance from the Order can therefore be seen as an act of political as well as spiritual modernity.\n\nAbstract of: Freller, T. (2003). Russia’s view of a new world – Catherine II and the Russian approaches to the Order of Malta. Jahrbücher für Geschichte Osteuropas. 51. 161-184.\n\nOn 9 February 1803, a Papal bull appointed Giovanni Battista Tommasi as Grandmaster of the Order. His appointment was ratified on 27 June 1803 during the General Assembly of the Order in the Church of the Priory in Messina. Tommasi died on 13 June 1805. Since then, the Order was led by a luogotenente del magisterio; governor of the Grand Magisterium. The Order’s return to Malta was provided for in the Treaty of Amiens (1802) but revoked by the Treaty of Paris (1814), which assigned Malta to Great Britain. During Tommasi’s short reign, the exiled Order moved to Italy where it finally settled in Rome from 1834. By 1806, what was left of the Order in Western Europe was dissolved and the Order became a loose group of (former) members without an organizational structure:\n\nBy 1806, Napoleon had suppressed all what was left of the original Order in France and in Italy. [Smith/Storace, Order of St. John of Jerusalem, p. 43, for further details.] During the period 1805-1810, the Commanderies of Germany, Italy and Bavaria were swept away, Portugal was ravaged and Sicily sequestrated the Sicilian Commanderies for the Royal Treasure. On 24 March 1806, the two Russian Grand Priories (through the marionet Sacred Council) accepted that customary procedure must be followed pending the confirmation of the Candidate for the Magistry (Caracciolo). On 12 July 1806, the Treaty of the Confederation of the Rhine expropriated the Priory of Germany. In the year 1806, also the Grand Priories of Venice, Lombardy and Germany were expropriated. On 13 July 1806, King Gustaf IV of Sweden offered Gotland to Guevara-Sardo, who declined. In 1807, Pius VII confirmed Guevara-Sardo to stay on as Lt. Grandmaster of the Papal Order and rejected Caracciolo.\n\nHoegen Dijkhof 2006, p. 195\n\nThis changed in 1879, when the office of Grandmaster was restored by Pope Leo XIII. He confirmed Count Giovanni Battista Ceschi a Santa Croce as the new Grandmaster after almost 80 years of vacancy. It should be noted that the Pope acknowledged the importance of the role of the Tsars:\n\nTO THE BELOVED SON\n\nGIOVANNI BATTISTA CESCHI OF SANTA CROCE\n\nLEONE PAPA XIII.\n\nBeloved Son greeting and Apostolic blessing. The Roman Pontiffs, Our Predecessors, always esteemed it most praiseworthy and honourable to protect and favour those institutions which they recognised as being for the glory of God and the health of Christendom, and therefore they accepted under their protection the Military Orders instituted for the growing of Religion and the defence of the Church, and they enriched them with many privileges, and if they found any development in them that departed from the rules and customs, they never neglected, with pastoral vigilance and according to ancient times, to call them back to the ancient and upright path.\n\nNo one is unaware of the distinction and the flourishing of the Order that took the name of the hospital of St. John the Baptist of Jerusalem, either because of its ancient origin and the dignity of its members, or because of its distinguished merits towards the Church, or because of the glory of its deeds and its victories over the common enemy. But this Order, too, as is the lot of human beings, has experienced the vicissitudes of time and the vicissitudes of fickle fortune, but it has never been so overwhelmed by the forces of fortune, nor has it been so abandoned by the help of God and of this Holy See, that it has perished altogether: This was most evident at the close of the last century and at the beginning of the present, when, having lost the island of Malta and dispersed the brotherhood, it seemed almost overthrown and destroyed: At that time, by the admirable providence of God, it found unexpected help in the most powerful Russian Emperors Paul I and Alexander I; and it found so much favour in our predecessor Pope Pius VII, of happy memory, that in the new seat where he had taken refuge, he was able to assemble legally and under legitimate superiors fulfil the proper offices of the institution, and as far as possible maintain to a great extent his ancient dignity. Now, although with the passing of the years things seemed to be moving in the right direction, Our Predecessor, considering the internal condition of the Order itself and the circumstances of the times, considered it neither safe nor opportune, after the death of Grand Master Giovanni Battista Tommasi, to confer such a title and honour on the head of the Order; But it was more prudent to postpone the election of the Grand Master, and to Inigo Maria Guevara Suardo, who acted as his successor, he was granted with the title of Lieutenant, the major faculties that seemed necessary for the regiment of the Order and the administration of the common goods, as appears from the Apostolic Letters addressed in the form of a Brief to the aforesaid Inigo Guevara on 21 October 1805. However, it was not the will of the most providential Pontiff that what he had only temporarily provided for, should last perpetually. On the contrary, he repeatedly declared that it was his fervent wish that as soon as the reason of the times permitted, a Grand Master should be appointed to the Order according to the Statutes. But since he passed away before this wish was fulfilled, and since there was no favourable opportunity to restore the ancient and honourable rank of the head of the Order, all those who were later called to that dignity, although by the clemency of this Holy See invested with the faculties, office and duties of supreme heads of the Order, had only the name and title of Lieutenants. Nor did the Roman Pontiffs fail at this time to provide for the good of the Order; for by two Apostolic Letters of happy memory, dated 23 December 1844 and 30 September of the following year, Gregory XVI established certain things that he considered salutary for the regular conduct of the affairs of the Order, and by letter of the Cardinal Secretary of State, dated 11 July 1815, he prescribed the manner and form in which the brethren of the Order should elect their Head. More recently, Pius IX of illustrious memory, Our Predecessor, in his Apostolic Letter of March 1, 1865, contemplated and decreed many things concerning the rights and duties of the Lieutenant and his Council, the observance of which he considered to be of benefit to the Order and the administration of its affairs, In the meantime, with God’s help, and with the help of the knights, especially those who were at the height of things, as well as with the benevolent favour of the European powers, the Order’s position was so firmly established and so happily increased, that not only is it to be rejoiced at its present authority and its happy undertakings for the benefit and adornment of the Church, but it is also to be hoped for greater and more prosperous things in the future. Therefore our venerable brother Antonino de Luca, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, Archbishop of Palestrina, and protector of the aforesaid Order, having explained to us the happy and flourishing state of affairs in which this Order finds itself, begged us, with great solicitude for his intervention, that according to the laws and statutes of the Order we might restore to its head the name and dignity of Grand Master. And this we proved to be able to do without harm to anyone, and without a new election, since the people entitled to vote after the year 1805, when the appointment of the Grand Master was indefinitely postponed, in electing the Lieutenant they always sought to confer on him the supreme and permanent power over the entire Order, whatever title the circumstances of the times and things might allow, And the same venerable brother of ours, having moreover represented to us how Thy beloved son was elected to the council that is called complete, with legal suffrage not otherwise than the four Lieutenants of Thy predecessors, commended with various arguments and with much praise Thy diligence towards it and towards the knights of the Order. We have therefore well examined and evaluated everything, considering that those reasons for which Pius VII, Our Predecessor wished to postpone the appointment of the Grand Master; desiring as far as we are concerned to restore this most noble Order, so well deserving of Christian religion and civil society in the person of its head, to its former place of splendour and dignity; and wishing especially to favour you yourself (whom we judge to be most worthy of the highest honour) we thought to accept the prayers made, and gladly acceded to them. We therefore, in view of what has been set forth above, revoke and repeal what was prudently established by Pius VII in his Apostolic Letter of 21 October 1805 concerning the postponement of the election of the Grand Master. We therefore grant the said Order of St. John of Jerusalem the power to elect a successor whenever the post and title of supreme head of the Order is vacant (without prejudice to the Pontiff’s right to confirm him), taking again the name and title of Grand Master, as the laws and Institutes of the Order prescribed in ancient times. With regard to the form and ceremony of the election, we command that the same be observed as has been observed to date in the election of Lieutenant, in accordance with the prescriptions of Gregory XVI, in the letter of the Cardinal Secretary of State of 11 July 1815, which we wish and decree to remain in full force and effect. Likewise with regard to the exercise of the power and rights of the Grand Master, we wish that in the meantime what was established by Apostolic Letter of 17 March 1865 by our predecessor Pius IX with regard to the power and rights of the Lieutenant and his Council should remain in force and be preserved; nor do we wish that any changes be made to them, until such time as we or our successors provide otherwise. Finally, since You, beloved son, have been legally invested with the title of Lieutenant since the year 1872, as we have said above, with supreme and perpetual power over the entire Order, and confirmed in that office by Our predecessor Pius IX by apostolic letters in the form of a Brief of 23 February of the same year; And having continually held that power in such a manner that, by religiously exercising the duties of the most ample ministry, you valiantly promoted the decorum and usefulness of the Order and set an example of exalted prudence, industrious zeal and those other virtues that should shine in the head of this distinguished fellowship; We, certain that it would have been most pleasing to the entire Order if we had not only approved his actions in the choice of your person, but had further illustrated them with a new honour, We, according to custom, absolve you from any excommunication, interdiction, or other ecclesiastical sentences, in whatever manner or cause decreed (if by chance you had incurred them), in grace thereof absolving you, and considering you absolute, We elect and appoint you Grand Master of the Order of Jerusalem with all the obligations and duties in accordance with the Statutes of the Order and the Apostolic Constitutions, and with all the honours, graces and privileges that your predecessors have enjoyed, commanding therefore the individual Knights, the Chaplains of the entire Order and all its ministers and attendants to give you due obedience, and to honour and venerate you as Grand Master and Prince.\n\nWe therefore establish and command these things, decreeing that the present letters shall remain invariable, valid and effective for the present and the future, and that they shall have full and complete effect, notwithstanding the Apostolic Constitutions and ordinances, the Statutes and customs of the Order, and Chapter ordinations (even if they have been confirmed by Apostolic oath and confirmation or by any other immutability), and also notwithstanding any indult [a special often temporary dispensation granted in the Roman Catholic Church] or Apostolic letter granted in any way to the contrary, confirmed and renewed, from which all and singular, and from any other disposition to the contrary (which we deem to be wholly expressed herein and almost inserted from word to word, and which shall remain for all the rest in force) we specially and expressly derogate for this time only, and in order that the foregoing may have full effect. Trusting, finally, that these things, which we have so disposed and established, may, by Divine grace, by Thy activity, and by the solicitude of the entire Order entrusted to Thee, be directed to the glory of God and to the interest and honour of the Christian government, to Thee, beloved Son, we implore every happiness in Thy Magisterium, and we impart our Apostolic Blessing most lovingly.\n\nGiven in Rome at the Vatican under the fisherman’s ring, on the 28th day of March 1879, the second year of Our Pontificate.

His contribution to the Order cannot be overestimated. Ceschi played an important role in the formation and maintenance of hospitals and medical services in Italy and France. He restored the Villa del Priorato di Malta, one of the two institutional seats of the government of the Order. Ceschi a Santa Croce created national associations of the Order in Great Britain, France, Portugal and Spain, which were open to lay knights who did not take religious vows.\n\nSubsequent Grandmasters led the Order into the modern era, focusing on charity. Currently, it is heavily debated whether the Order should be led by small group of priests or in the form of ​​a more democratic style of government.\n\nIn Paris, on 24 June 1928, twelve descendants of Russian hereditary commanders revived the activities of the Russian Grand Priory in order to preserve the cultural heritage of their ancestors. They were supported by four other Russian noblemen. Today, the Russian Grand Priory operates under the governance of its Grand Prior, Count Pierre Cheremetieff and his Lieutenant Grand Prior, Prince Stéphane Belosselsky Belozersky. The Russian Grand Priory counts about 250 knights, dames and donats spread over France, Italy, Belgium, Canada and the United States.\n\nConclusions\n\nOver the centuries, the Order of Saint John developed from a group of monks in Jerusalem, successively into an international military power, a slave trading pirate state on Malta, a scattered group of unorganized refugees in Europe and Russia, a Russian State Order, an Order under Papal authority, and finally a non-governmental organization (NGO) under Papal control. Dr Hoegen Dijkhof summerizes its history as follows:\n\nThe interim conclusion is that the original Order founded around 1050, carried on till 1154, respectively 1798 and in the course of its history, Anglican and Protestant split-offs occurred. In 1798, Napoleon dissolved this original Order. Czar Paul I was then validly elected in 1798 as Grandmaster of what States and Priories have seen as the original Order continued. Then in 1803, a ‘coup d’état’ by Pope Pius VII, facilitated by Czar Alexander I and a marionet provisional Sacred Council, took place and this started a new Papal Order in 1803. The new Order started in 1798 under Czar Paul I, in principle legally remained established in St. Petersburg and carried on somehow in Russia during the rest of the 19th century. This Order was however internationally not recognised by States as an international legal person. No Order of St. John was so recognised since the Treaty of Paris and the Vienna Congress, except (later and then by about 30 % of the total number of States) SMOM. When a new Grandmaster (Tommasi) was appointed by Pope Pius VII in 1803, not elected, the Pope thus created a new Papal Order. This Order slowly died for lack of (adequate) corporate life. The successor of 1879 of this Papal Order (SMOM), created by Pope Leo XIII, was far more active than the Russian Order, which at best was only active in Russia. The facts then certainly had become stronger than law. SMOM grew and became also recognised as an international legal person by a number of states.\n\nHoegen Dijkhof, 2006, p. 218\n\nAlthough there is little doubt that the current Order of Malta has it roots in the ancient Hospital of Saint John in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen whether the line of succession is continuous and whether there are other groups that can also legitimately claim to be routed in the ancient hospital. Another question is if the current NGO and the medieval monks can be considered the same Order:\n\nThe name [of an order of knighthood] has remained, and the badge, but the purpose and function is clearly very different. In a literal sense, ITT (International Telegraph and Telephone) is still the same US company it was 30 years ago, but today it doesn’t sell phone services, it runs hotels, until recently still under the name (ITT-Sheraton). Likewise, Westinghouse used to make nuclear plants, now it makes prime-time broadcasts (CBS). Is it the same company? If Coca-Cola moved to Taiwan and became a car manufacturer, would we think of it as being the same company?\n\nF.R.
