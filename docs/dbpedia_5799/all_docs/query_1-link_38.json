There were sister settlements close by, in Greece and especially in Cyprus. The Westerners had retained control of the sea, which meant that communications with Europe were relatively secure. Although the crusade of King Louis IX of France, which had invaded Egypt in 1249, had ended in disaster with the king a prisoner of the Muslims, Louis spent four years in Palestine after his release in 1250. He continued to provide significant financial and military assistance until his death in 1270.1"
