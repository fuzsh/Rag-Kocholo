The second part of the article examines hidden cultural politics and diplomacy, events preceding the Berlin exhibition, bureaucratic games, and features of Soviet politics behind the scenes. For the first time, the preparation of ‘both’ Berlin exhibitions is described in detail, and their organisers are identified. The ‘liquidation’ of exhibits and the organisation of a commercial project to sell paintings in the West are also covered for the first time. Key names: Lunacharsky, Sterenberg, Gabo, Marianov, Altman, Dreyer, Malevich, Rodchenko, Korovin, Kreitor."
