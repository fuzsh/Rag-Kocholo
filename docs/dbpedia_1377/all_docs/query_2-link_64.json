        "meta_description": "This website is dedicated to Soviet Art and Socialist Realism in the 20th century. We feature a large number of Soviet and socialist fine arts and posters as well as applied arts and design of that period. The majestic and diverse Russian paintings always please audiences with their volatility and the perfection of art forms. These feature works, by famous masters of art, always surprise by their unusual approach to work, love for the feelings and sensations of each individual. Perhaps that is why so many Russian artists depicted portraits which combine bright and emotional images and epic calm motive. Our collection counts more than 1000 works from the classical period of the Soviet art painting from the 1930th â till the 1980th year, including, so-called, Soviet impressionism - a socialist realism with a human face. Socialist realism is characterized by the glorified depiction of communist values, such as the emancipation of the proletariat, in a realistic manner. The Soviet painting of this period was included strongly into world art heritage.",
