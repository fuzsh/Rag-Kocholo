The exposition reflects the work of artists of different generations: Mikhail Vladykin, Ivan Batyukov, Vladimir Ulyanov, Sergey Sokolov, Leonid Malafeevsky and others.\n\nThe window motif has been actively developed in art since the Renaissance. The window acted as an indispensable detail of the interior, decoration of the building, the light source and the object of attraction of the people living in the house. The window was symbolically perceived in the picture by the portal into a bright or anxious future, reminiscent of the collision or unity of two worlds: internal and external. Together, the presented works create a vivid and memorable image that gives the viewer the opportunity to admire the coloristic, compositional harmony performed by genuine masters, and reflect on the problems of living space, dreams and reality.\n\nBased on site materialsYaroslavl Art Museum."
