From 1902 to 1908, he studied with the great genre and history painter Ilya Repin at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. Brodsky was known before the Revolution for his observant salon portraits and landscapes, exhibiting from 1904 with the Wanderers and the World of Art. Throughout his career, he maintained the academy standards he absorbed as a student; thus he was able to reinstate tradtional methods and style s of painting at he reformed All-Russian Academy od Arts, Leningrad. Throughout his career, Brodsky openly acknowledged his Jewish heritage, and he was briefly involved in activities of the Jewish renaissance. In 1916, he became a member of the Jewish Society for the Encouragement of the Arts in Petrograd, contributing to both the Petrograd Exhibition of Jewish Artists and the Moscow Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture by Jewish Artists in 1917-18. Mentioning incidents of pre-Revolution-ary anti-Semitism in his memoirs, he achnowledged the Soviet regime for recognizing him and his work. A member of AKhRR from 1924 through 1928, Brodsky painted numerous sympathetic portraits of Lenin from life and had no difficulty conforming to Bolshevik dictates.Ambitious in scale, composition, and theme, these portraits were regarded as landmarks. Their meticulous execution, based on research, sketches from life, and documentary photographs (a technique labeled \"Brodsky-ism\" by the artist's critics) caused Brodsky to be ejected from the AKhRR even though he was highly regarded by Stalin and members of the arts administration. During the 1930s he contributed to numerous exhibitions and had several solo shows. In 1932, Brodsky was named Honored Arts Worker of the RSFSR. He was named Professor (1932-39) and then - his final accolade - Director (1934-39) of the All-Russian Academy od Arts, Leningrad. In 1933, Brodsky was invited to join Alexander Gerasimov and Katsman to meet with Stalin and Kliment Voroshilov to discuss the Socialist Realist method. In 1937, Brodsky won a gold medal at the exposition Universelle in Paris. In 1949, his apartment was opened as a memorial museum.\n\n(Russian Jewish Artists in a Century of Change 1890 - 1990\", edited by S.T.Goodman, Prestel, Munich-New York, 1996)\n\nGRIGOREV, Sergei Alekseevich\n\nBorn in Lugansk (Ukraine) 1910.
