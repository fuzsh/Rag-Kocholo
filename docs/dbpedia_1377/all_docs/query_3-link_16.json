        "text": "The Russian theatre and film director Andrei Konchalovsky is an elder brother of Nikita Mikhalkov, born August, 20, 1937. As a youngster he planned to pursue a career of a musician and learned to play piano but his love for cinema outweighed and he entered VGIK-the major state film school where he studied under Mikhail Romm. At VGIK he met Andrei Tarkovsky, they collaborated on Iwans Kindheit (1962) and Andrej Rubljow (1966). For his feature debut Der erste Lehrer (1965), he chose the book by Chingiz Aitmatov about the post-1917 Revolution period in the southern Russia. His next film Asjas Glück (1966) although made in 1966 was not released until a decade later because it failed to comply with the strict requirements of the Russian censorship of the period. Ein Adelsnest (1969) - a study of the 19 c. aristocracy - was praised for its visual beauty but attacked by critics as mannered. Konchalovsky's powerful Onkel Wanja (1970) from the play by 'Anton Chekhov_ is regarded by many people as one of the best films in the Russian language ever. Sibiriade (1979) - a dramatic and realistic story of the lives of the people of Siberia - was internationally acclaimed and brought Konchalovsky to the attention of American and European producers. From then on-wards his career has been international in scope. Pleasing critics and audiences worldwide, he made the English language films Maria's Lovers (1984), Runaway Train (1985), Duet for One (1986) (praised for Max von Sydow's brilliant performance), and the award-winning Homer and Eddie (1989) starring Whoopi Goldberg. Konchalovsky moved to the mainstream territory with the action packed Tango und Cash (1989). Charasteristically he still insists that this work is no less laudable than any of his others. He also directed plays and operas in a number of European cities. In the early 1990s he returned to Russia and directed several theatre productions most notably \"The Seagull\" by Chekhov and \"Miss Julie\" by August Strindberg. Residing in Moscow Konchalovsky sometimes makes short excursions to Hollywood to make mainstream TV productions like the Emmy-winning Die Abenteuer des Odysseus (1997) and The Lion in Winter (2003) in which Glenn Close gave an award-winning performance. His Russian-French co-production Das Irrenhaus (2002) - a story set in an asylum that stands on the border between Russia and Chechenya during the war in Chechenya - was warmly received in Europe and won an honor at the 2002 Venice Film Festival. However the film antagonized the critics in Russia. In the very beginning of his career he was credited as Mikhalkov- Konchalovsky. Later he adopted his mother's maiden name to distinguish himself from his younger brother, Nikita Mikhalkov, who was rapidly becoming a famous filmmaker himself. For his last feature film Die weißen Nächte des Postboten (2014), shot digitally in his home country Russia, Andrey Konchalovsky won the 'Best Director' award at the 'Venice International Film Festival' in 2014.\n\nDirector and screenwriter Andrey Zvyagintsev is the winner of the Venice Film Festival (2003) and the Cannes Film Festival (2011, 2014, 2017). Two-time the Academy Awards and the BAFTA Awards nominee. Winner or the Golden Globe Awards (2015) for his film \"Leviathan\". In 2018, his latest work \"Loveless\" was awarded Best Foreign Film by the César Academy, France.\n\nBorn on the 6th of February in 1964 in Novosibirsk, Andrey Zvyagintsev attended the Novosibirsk Theatrical School, class of Lev Belov, before pursuing his studies in Moscow. In 1990, he graduated from the acting faculty of the Russian Institute of Theater Arts (GITIS), class of Evgeny Lazarev. In the following years Andrey gave several theatre, film and TV appearances as an actor.\n\nIn 2000, he debuted as a director. He made three short films for REN TV Channel's \"The Black Room\" series - \"Bushido\", \"Obscure\", \"The Choice\" - that was followed by his first full-length feature.\n\nIn 2003, \"The Return\", a debut not only for the director but also for the majority of the crew, played the main competition at the 60th Venice Film Festival and won its highest prize, the Golden Lion. Besides, Zvyagintsev was awarded the Lion of the Future for best debut, \"a very delicate film about love, loss and growing\". It captured the attention all over the world becoming one of the cinema sensations of the year.\n\nHis second film, \"The Banishment\", competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2007 and won Best Actor (Konstantin Lavronenko) - the first-ever for a Russian artist.\n\nIn 2011, Zvyagintsev's third film, \"Elena\", premiered at the 64th Cannes Film Festival and won the Special Jury Prize in the Un Certain Regard section.\n\nHis fourth film, \"Leviathan\", screened in competition at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014 and won Best Screenplay (Andrey Zvyagintsev and Oleg Negin). In 2015, the film won the Golden Globe becoming the first Russian feature to win this award since 1969. The film got an Oscar nomination in the same category at the 87th Academy Awards.\n\nZvyagintsev's next film, \"Loveless\", won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2017 and was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards in 2018. \"Loveless\" was released in all major territories earning nominations for all acclaimed cinema awards worldwide including The Golden Globe Awards and BAFTA. It was awarded Best Foreign Film at France's César Awards, for the first time in history of both Soviet and Russian cinema.\n\nIn 2018, Andrey Zvyagintsev served on the Cannes Film Festival jury.\n\nStanislav Rostotsky was a renown Russian film director whose two films, ...A zori zdes tikhie (1972) and Weißer Bim Schwarzohr (1977) were nominated for Oscar and won other international awards.\n\nHe was born Stanislav Iosifovich Rostotsky on April 21, 1922, in Rybinsk, north of Moscow, Russia. His father, named Josef Boleslavovich Rostotsky, was a respected Medical Doctor and later became an official at State Department of Health. His mother, named Lidia Karlovna, was a homemaker. Young Rostotsky spent much of his childhood in a village in Central Russia. There he developed his special ability to uncover the beauty of wild nature, that later became a professional forte in his directing.\n\nIn 1936, at age 14, Rostotsky made his film debut as an actor in Die Beshin-Wiese (1937), albeit some parts of the film were lost, including most of Rostotsky's scenes. At that time he met the legendary director Sergei Eisenstein. Under the guidance from Eisenstein, young Rostotsky studied literature and arts, and focused on such writers as Honoré de Balzac and Émile Zola, composers Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel, art of Japanese prints and Impressionist paintings by such artists as Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Edgar Degas among others. Rostotsky and Eisenstein became life-long friends. Upon Eisenstein's advise, Rostotsky did not rush into film business until he achieved a well-rounded education, he attended Moscow Institute of Philosophy and Literature.\n\nIn February 1942 Rostotsky was drafted in the Red Army. After a brief training, he served as a private with the 6th Cavalry Guards Brigade at the Ukrainian Front, fighting against the Nazi troops during the Second World War. On February 11, 1944 Rostotsky was severely wounded in action; after having his leg amputated he undergone a comprehensive six-month treatment, and had to wear a prosthesis for the rest of his life. Rostotsky was decorated with the Order of the Red Banner for his courage in battle.\n\nIn August of 1944 Rostotsky became a student of director Grigoriy Kozintsev at Leningrad Institute of Cinematography. There he studied film directing for seven years, assisted in Kozintsev's films, and graduated in 1951 as a film director. From 1952 to 2001 he worked at Gorky Film Studio in Moscow. There he made 17 films as director, including his best films, Warten wir den Montag ab (1968), 'A zori zdes tikhie' (1972), and 'Belyy Bim - chernoe ukho' (1977), the latter two received Oscar nominations and international acclaim.\n\nStanislav Rostotsky was awarded the State Prize of the USSR twice (1970, 1975). He was designated People's Artist of the USSR, and received numerous awards and decorations for his contribution to film art. He was a Member of the Board of Union of Cinematographers, and five times Member of the Jury at Moscow International Film Festival (1975, 1977, 1979, 1981, 1983). He also taught directing at State Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, and wrote numerous articles on film directing and film history. He also wrote memoirs about Eisenstein, Gerasimov, Moskvin, and other Russian film figures. Rostotsky was married to notable Russian actress Nina Menshikova and their son, Andrey Rostotskiy was a popular film actor.\n\nOutside of his film profession Stanislav Rostotsky was famous for his support of recreational fishing and was known for releasing his catch alive; he was decorated with the Medal of Honor \"For Development of Fishing Resouces in Russia\" and also presided at several sport fishing competitions. Stanislav Rostotsky died of a heart failure on August 11, 2001, in Moscow, and was laid to rest in Vagankovskoe Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.\n\nKirill Lavrov was a notable Russian actor, director and political figure who was also longtime Chairman of Theatrical Union of the USSR and the leader of Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in St. Petersburg (Leningrad), Russia.\n\nHe was born Kirill Yuryevich Lavrov on September 15, 1925, in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg, Russia), into a family with deep roots in St. Petersburg society. He was baptized by the Russian Orthodox Church of St. John the Divine in Lavrushinskoe Podvorie Monastery in Leningrad.\n\nYoung Kirill Lavrov was brought up in Leningrad (St. Petersburg), in a noble family which was part of the St. Petersburg cultural milieu. His grandmother, named Olga Leonidovna Lykoshina, was related to writer Aleksandr Griboyedov and belonged to Polish Nobility. His grandfather was member of Imperial Humanitarian Society and Director of Gymnasium in St. Petersburg. His father, named Yuri Lavrov, was an actor at the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in St. Petersburg, where his stage costumes were designed by Alexandre Benois. His mother, named Olga Ivanovna Gudim-Levkovich, was an actress.\n\nKirill Lavrov's family was at risk during the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin, because Lavrov's grandfather, a member of Imperial Humanitarian Society in St. Petersburg, was an anti-communist who fled Russia after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Russian intellectuals suffered badly under the dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. The murder of the popular governor of Leningrad, Sergei Kirov, triggered massive extermination of intellectuals and destruction of culture and society under repressions known as \"The Great Purge.\" In 1938, the Lavrovs escaped repressions by moving from Leningrad to Kiev.\n\nDuring the Second World War Kirill Lavrov was evacuated to Novosibirsk in Siberia. In 1943, then 17-year-old Lavrov applied to join the Red Army to fight the Nazis. He was sent to Astrakhan Aviation Technical School from which he graduated in 1945, and then served as an aircraft technician in the Air Force in the Kuril Island of Iturup until 1950. He was also an amateur actor at a local army club.\n\nIn 1950 Kirill Lavrov reunited with his parents in Kiev. There he became a professional actor of the Russian Drama Theatre named after Lesya Ukrainka, where his father was the leading actor at that time. Although Kirill Lavrov did not study acting professionally, he had a natural talent. He made his stage acting debut in Kiev, and appeared alongside with his father in several plays at the Russian Drama Theatre named after Lesya Ukrainka. In 1955, Lavrov came back to Leningrad; he was invited by director Georgi Tovstonogov and joined the troupe at BDT.\n\nFrom 1955 - 2007 Kirill Lavrov was a permanent member of the legendary troupe at the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in St. Petersburg (Leningrad). Lavrov worked under directorship of Georgi Tovstonogov for 33 years. After the death of Tovstonogov, Lavrov remained the leader of outstanding ensemble of actors at BDT. There his stage partners were such stars as Oleg Basilashvili, Tatyana Doronina, Alisa Freyndlikh, Lyudmila Makarova, Svetlana Kryuchkova, Zinaida Sharko, Valentina Kovel, Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy, Sergey Yurskiy, Nikolay Trofimov, Oleg Borisov, Vladislav Strzhelchik, Yefim Kopelyan, Evgeniy Lebedev, Georgiy Shtil, Vsevolod Kuznetsov, Pavel Luspekayev, Vadim Medvedev, Yuriy Demich, Leonid Nevedomsky, Gennadiy Bogachyov, Andrey Tolubeev, and many other remarkable Russian actors.\n\nIn 1989, Kirill Lavrov was unanimously elected the Artistic Director of the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) in St. Petersburg. He managed to preserve the artistic tradition established by the great Russian director Georgi Tovstonogov, and to rename BDT after G. A. Tovstonogov. Kirill Lavrov was awarded the State Prizes of the USSR and Russia for his works on stage and in film. He received numerous decorations and was designated People's Actor of the USSR (1972). He was elected representative to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and later was also an active political and cultural figure in the new Russia. From 1992 - 2006 Lavrov was President of the International Confederation of Theatrical Unions.\n\nOutside of his acting and political career, Kirill Lavrov was a dedicated football (soccer) fan, a passion he inherited from his father. Kirill Lavrov was a good sportsman since his youth; he was a member of the youth football (soccer) team at \"Spartak\" club in Leningrad. He also trained in skiing, gymnastics and fencing. For many years, Lavrov was a captain of the football team of actors at BDT, and also a follower of Zenit, a football club in St. Petersburg.\n\nKirill Lavrov was Honorary Citizen of St. Petersburg. He died of a heart failure, aged 81, on April 27, 2007, in St Petersburg. His burial service was held at the Bolshoi Drama Theatre (BDT) and then at the same Russian Orthodox Church where he was baptized as a child. Kirill Lavrov was laid to rest next to his late wife in Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nVartanov was blacklisted for his debut film, The Color of Land (1969), where he portrayed his dissident friends Parajanov (imprisoned in 1974) and Minas (assassinated in 1975). When Vartanov's artistic freedom was restored 20 years later, he responded with Minas: A Requiem (1989) and Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992), admired by Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and many other of cinema's greatest luminaries.\n\nFor bravely campaigning for the release of the imprisoned Parajanov, Vartanov was fired from the Soviet Armenia's sole film studio and deprived of his only source of income (the film industry, like all others, was fully government funded and controlled). Parajanov reacted with a letter written to Vartanov from the Ukrainian prison: \"You and your purity are colliding with circumstances and predators\".\n\nThanks to the tireless petitioning of his (V.G.I.K.) classmate Artavazd Peleshian and Gennadi Melkonian, Vartanov was able to work as their cinematographer and exquisitely lensed two films that became classics: Seasons (1975) and Mulberry (1979).\n\nNot until Parajanov was taken off the blacklist in 1984 (due to lobbying by celebrities) was Vartanov also permitted to direct. Even though the studio forced him to make several films such as Roots (1984), he breathed into them his trademark soulfulness.\n\nThe publication of his revered Unmailed Letters essays in the top literary magazines, spurred new writings, as well as their translations all over Europe, notably in Cahiers du Cinema, in 1986. His fierce Erased Faces (1987) had terrified the colleagues who doubted the permanence of the Gorbachev reforms.\n\nIn the war-torn and blockaded Armenia of the early 1990s, which was plagued by severe shortages of food, water, transportation and electricity, Vartanov's health, already compromised by decades of harassment, worsened. Despite the serious limitations, he persisted and, for the first time, independently produced what became his final film.\n\nWhen in Moscow, in 1993, he accepted the Russian Academy of Cinema Arts Award for Parajanov: The Last Spring (1992), in a characteristically modest move, he simply bowed, and uttered not a single word to the millions watching the live broadcast.\n\nFestival invitations for this masterwork enabled Vartanov's escape to California, but his early films remained inaccessible and under the control of his old suppressors for the rest of his life. He did not witness the first retrospective and exhibition of his films and art at the Busan International Film Festival, which took place just three years after he passed away in Hollywood.\n\nGrigori Mikhailovich Kozintsev was born on March 22, 1905, in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Kiev, Ukraine). His father, named Mikhail Kozintsev, was a medical doctor. Young Kozintsev studied at the Kiev Gymnazium. There, in 1919, he organized experimental theatre \"Arlekin\" together with his fellow students Sergei Yutkevich and Aleksei Kapler. During 1919 and 1920 Kozintsev studied art at the Kiev School of Art under the tutelage of Alexandra Exter.\n\nExperiments. In 1920 Kozintsev moved to Petrograd (Leningrad or St. Petersburg). There he studied art at the \"VKHUTEMAS\" at the Academy of Fine Arts for two years. In 1921 Kozintsev with Sergei Yutkevich, Leonid Trauberg, and Leonid Kryzhitsky organized and led the Factory of Excentric Actors (FEKS). There Kozintsev directed radically avant-garde staging of plays \"Zhenitba\" (Marriage 1922) by Nikolay Gogol and \"Vneshtorg na Eifelevoi Bashne\" (Foreign trade on Eiffel Tower 1923). They were based in the former Eliseev Mansion on Gagarinskaya street No. 1 in St. Petersburg. Kozintsev and FEKS collaborated with writer Yuri Tynyanov, cinematographer Andrey Moskvin, young actor-director Sergey Gerasimov, artist Igor Vuskovich, and young composer Dmitri Shostakovich among others. Initially FEKS was the main platform for experimental actors, directors and artists, and was strongly influenced by Vsevolod Meyerhold and Vladimir Mayakovsky.\n\nArtistic position. In 1924 Kozintsev and Trauberg came to \"SevZapKino\" Studios (now Lenfilm Studios). There Kozintsev continued his FEKS experiments in his first eccentric comedy 'Pokhozhdenie Oktyabriny' (1924). Kozintsev's early films were strongly criticized by official Soviet critics. His film 'Shinel' (1926) was compared to German Expressionism and accused of distortion of the original classic story by Nikolay Gogol. Kozintsev strongly argued against such comparisons with German expressionism; he was unhappy until the end of his life about such criticism of his early experimental works. Kozintsev insisted that his cheerful experiments were essential in the city of Petrograd (St. Petersburg) after the Russian Revolution of 1917, which brought destruction, depression, crime, and degradation of culture.\n\nEarly films. Kozintsev made twelve films together with Leonid Trauberg. Their collaboration began in 1921, in Petrograd (St. Petersburg). Their film-trilogy about Russian revolutionary hero Maxim was made from 1935-1941, when people in the Soviet Russia were terrorized under the most brutal dictatorship of Joseph Stalin. In departure from experimental youthfulness and freedom of their FEKS years, the Maxim trilogy was a trade-off blend of experiment and Soviet propaganda. It was still a powerful work and was even banned by censorship in the United States from the 1930s-1950s. For that work Kozintsev and Trauberg were awarded the Stalin's State Prize in 1941. After the Second World War Kozintsev and Trauberg made their last film together: 'Prostye Lyudi (Plain People 1946), which was censored and remained unreleased until 1958, when \"Nikita Khrushchev' lifted the ban imposed by Stalin's censorship.\n\nHighlights. Grigori Kozintsev ascended to his best works after the death of Stalin. Then Nikita Khrushchev initiated the \"Thaw\" which played a role in some liberation of individual creativity in the Soviet film industry. Kozintsev's adaptations of classical literature combined some experimental elements of his earlier silent films with the approach of a mature master. His Don Quixote (1957), King Lear (1969) and especially Hamlet (1963) were recognized worldwide as his highest achievements. In _Korol Lir (1969)_ Kozintsev made a brilliant decision to cast actors from the Baltic States as the Lear's family. Jüri Järvet, Regimantas Adomaitis, Donatas Banionis, Juozas Budraitis, and Elza Radzina together with Oleg Dal, Galina Volchek, Aleksey Petrenko made a powerful acting ensemble.\n\nHamlet and King Lear. Kozintsev first staged Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" and 'King Lear\" in 1941. His collaboration with Boris Pasternak began in 1940, when Pasternak was working on his Russian translation of the Shakespeare's originals. Both plays were prepared for stage under direction of Kozintsev. King Lear was staged in 1941, but further work was interrupted because of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. Hamlet was staged in 1954. At the same time Kozintsev continued developing the idea of filming _Gamlet (1964)_, until everything came together in his legendary film. The adaptation by Boris Pasternak, the music by Dmitri Shostakovich, the direction by Kozintsev, and the acting talent of Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy produced special creative synergy. Innokentiy Smoktunovskiy was praised as the best Hamlet by Sir Laurence Olivier.\n\nLegacy. In the 1920s Kozintsev taught at the Leningrad School of Acting. From 1944-1964 Kozintsev led his master-class for film directors at the Soviet State Film Institute (VGIK). Among his students were many prominent Russian directors and actors such as Sergey Gerasimov and others. Kozintsev was the head of master-class for film directors at Lenfilm Studios from 1964-1971. He wrote essays on William Shakespeare, Sergei Eisenstein, Charles Chaplin, and Vsevolod Meyerhold and published theoretical works on film direction. Grigori Kozintsev lived near Lenfilm Stidios in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) for the most part of his life. His work and presence was essential to the status of Lenfilm Studios as well as to the film community in Leningrad during the political and economic domination of Moscow as the Soviet capital. From his early works of the 1920s to his masterpiece _Gamlet (1964)_, Kozintsev was faithful to creative experimental approach.\n\nKozintsev was designated the People's Artist of the USSR. He was awarded the State Lenin's Prize of the USSR (1965), and received other awards and nominations. He died in Leningrad (St. Petersburg) on May 11, 1973, and was laid to rest in the Necropolis of the Masters of Art in St. Aleksandr Nevsky Convent in St. Petersburg, Russia.\n\nSergei Bondarchuk was one of the most important Russian filmmakers, best known for directing an Academy Award-winning film epic Die grosse Liebe der Natascha (1965), based on the book by Lev Tolstoy, in which he also starred as Pierre Bezukhov.\n\nHe was born Sergei Fedorovich Bondarchuk on September, 25, 1920, in the village of Belozerka, Kherson province, Ukraine, Russian Federation (now Belozerka, Ukraine). He was brought up in Southern Ukraine, then in Azov and Taganrog, Southern Russia. Young Bondarchuk was fond of theatre and books by such authors as Anton Chekhov and Lev Tolstoy. He made his stage debut in 1937, on the stage of the Chekhov Drama Theatre in the city of Taganrog, then studied acting at Rostov Theatrical School. In 1942 his studies were interrupted by the Nazi invasion during WWII. Bondarchuk was recruited in the Red Army and served for four years until he was discharged in 1946. From 1946 - 1948 he attended the State Institute of Cinematography in Moscow (VGIK), graduating as an actor from the class of Sergey Gerasimov. In 1948 he made his film debut in Der wahre Mensch (1948) then co-starred in Die junge Garde (1948).\n\nFor his portrayal of the title character in Gesprengte Fesseln (1951) he was awarded the State Stalin's Prize of the USSR, and was designated People's Artist of the USSR, becoming the youngest actor ever to receive such honor. Then he starred in the internationally renowned adaptation of the Shakespeare's Othello (1956), in the title role opposite Irina Skobtseva as Desdemona. Bondarchuk expressed his own experience as a soldier of WWII when he starred in Ein Menschenschicksal (1959), a war drama based on the eponymous story by Mikhail Sholokhov, which was also Bondarchuk's directorial debut that earned him the prestigious Lenin's Prize of the USSR in 1960.\n\nBondarchuk shot to international fame with Die grosse Liebe der Natascha (1965), a powerful adaptation of the eponymous masterpiece by Lev Tolstoy. The 7-hour-long film epic won the 1969 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and brought Bondarchuk a reputation of one of the finest directors of his generation. The most expensive project in film history, Die grosse Liebe der Natascha (1965) was produced over seven years, from 1961 to 1968, at an estimated cost of $100,000,000 (over $800,000,000 adjusted for inflation in 2010). The film set several records, such as involving over three hundred professional actors from several countries and also tens of thousands extras from the Red Army in filming of the 3rd two-hour-long episode about the historic Battle of Borodino against the Napoleon's invasion, making it the largest battle scene ever filmed. Bondarchuk also made history by introducing several remote-controlled cameras that were moving on 300 meter long wires above the scene of the battlefield. Having earned international acclaim for Die grosse Liebe der Natascha (1965), he starred in the epic Die Schlacht an der Neretva (1969) with fellow Russian, Yul Brynner, and Orson Welles, whom he would direct the following year.\n\nBy the late 1960s Bondarchuk was one of the most awarded actor and director in the Soviet Union. However, he was still not a member of the Soviet Communist Party, a fact that brought attention from the Soviet leadership under Leonid Brezhnev. Soon Bondarchuk received an official recommendation to join the Soviet Communist Party, an offer that nobody in the Soviet Union could refuse without risking a career. At that time he was humorously comparing his situation with the historic Hollywood trials of filmmakers during the 50s. Bondarchuk was able to avoid the Communist Party in his earlier career, but things changed in the Soviet Union under Brezhnev, so in 1970, he accepted the trade-off and joined the Soviet Communist Party for the sake of protecting his film career. In 1971 he was elected Chairman of the Union of Filmmakers, a semi-government post in the Soviet system of politically controlled culture. Eventually he evolved into a politically controlled figure and turned to making such politically charged films as Mexico in Flammen (1982) and other such films. Later, during the liberalization of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev, Bondarchuk was seen as a symbol of conservatism in Soviet cinema, so in 1986 he was voted out of the office.\n\nBondarchuk was the first Russian director to make a big budget international co-production with the financial backing of Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis, such as Waterloo (1970), a Russian-Italian co-production vividly reconstructing the final battle of the Napoleonic Wars. This was his first English-language production, but several Soviet actors were cast, e.g. Sergo Zakariadze and Oleg Vidov. In this film, Orson Welles, his co-star in Die Schlacht an der Neretva (1969) made a cameo as the old King Louis XVII of France. But this time Bondarchuk was unable to control the advances of Rod Steiger, and the film was a commercial flop in Europe and America, albeit it gained the favor of critics.\n\nAfter his dismissal from the office of Chairman of the Union of Cinematographers he started filming Der stille Don (2006) based on the eponymous novel by the Nobel Prize winner Mikhail Sholokhov, with Rupert Everett as the lead. At the end of filming, just before post-production, Bondarchuk learned about some unfavorable details in his contract, causing a bitter dispute with the producers over the rights to the film and bringing much pain to the last two years of his life. Amidst this legal battle the production was stopped and the film was stored in a bank vault, and remained unedited and undubbed for nearly fourteen years. The production was completed by Russian television company \"First Channel\", and aired in November 2006.\n\nIn his career that spanned over five decades, Sergei Bondarchuk had credits as actor, director, writer, and co-producer in a wide range of films. He suffered a heart attack and died on October 20, 1994, and was laid to rest in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow, Russia, next to such Russian luminaries as Anton Chekhov and Mikhail A. Bulgakov. His death caused a considerable mourning in Russia. Bondarchuk was survived by his second wife, actress Irina Skobtseva and their children, actress Alyona Bondarchuk, and actor/director Fedor Bondarchuk, and actress Natalya Bondarchuk, his daughter with his first wife, actress Inna Makarova.\n\nAs a tribute to Sergei Bondarchuk, his son, Fedor Bondarchuk called him \"a father and my teacher,\" and dedicated his directorial debut, Die neunte Kompanie (2005), set in war-torn Afghanistan, whereas Sergei's directorial debut was set in WWII."
