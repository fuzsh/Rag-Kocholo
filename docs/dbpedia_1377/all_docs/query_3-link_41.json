The Directory may be used to find either the incumbents of given positions within an organization or the positions of given individuals. For some organizations, notably government ministries, the Directory also lists all known major components, including those whose leading administrators were not known at the time of publication; hence the Directory is in a limited sense also a guide to the internal structure of these organizations. Coverage. This publication is a revision of Directory of Soviet Officials, Volume I: National Organizations (CR A 73-31, November 1973), and copies of the November 1973 publication should be destroyed. Volume I covers organizations only at the national level. RSFSR organizations are treated in Volume II (CR A 71-21, July 1971); organizations in the other union republics are covered in Volume III (A (CR) 75-18, May 1975). Directory Entries. The date,following an official's name is that of his appointment, assign- ment, election, or, where the abbreviation \"i.\" precedes it, his earliest known identification in positicn. All entries in the Directory have been checked as of March 1975, and all officials who were identified in position after 1 January 1966, and not known to be deceased or transferred, have been included. Names of deceased persons do appear in the Party leadership graphs on pages 5 and 6 and in the membership lists of major elected bodies, such as the CPSU Central Committee. Names are given in full where known. Transliteration from Russian follows the system authorized by the Board of Geographic Names (BGN). Non-Russian names (such as those of Estonian or Ukrainian origin), for which original Latin-alphabet spellings or separate BGN transliteration ystems exist, are treated as Russian names and are tranSliterated from their Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000100240045-7 Approved For Release 1999/09/26 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000100240045-7 Russian spellings. Hence the Ukrainian surname Honchar is rendered Gonchar. Organizations. An effort has been made to verify and standardize the names of organizational components and the position titles of individuals, but some unverified entries remain where the sole source is a non-Soviet publication. Addresses and Russian titles of organizations based in Moscow are taken from Moskva: Kratkaya Adresno-Spravochnaya Kniga (Moscow: A Short Address and Reference Book), 1971. Date of Information. Information within this volume of the directory is current as of 1 March 1975.
