        "text": "“There are a number of fine art collections of large Soviet era state commissions where talented artists created what was asked of them. Lazare Gallery’s collection, however, is of fine quality relatively smaller works in which the artists created for themselves paintings which were dear to the creator’s heart. Due to this aspect, the collection is unique, important, of highest quality and more poetic.”\n\nEvgeny Maxsimov, Head of the painting department and head of the Monumental painting department of the Surikov Moscow State Institute, Academician, VP of the Academy of Arts.\n\n“Lazare Gallery is a glowing light that attracts one’s mind. It is not by coincidence that ‘enlightenment’ includes the word ‘light’. Such is the collection at Lazare Gallery”\n\nAnatoly Lyubavin, Director of the Surikov Moscow State Institute, Academician"
