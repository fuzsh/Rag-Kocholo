        "text": "This water landscape is from the year 1932 by Valery Levanidov. To reflect subtle yet contrary states of nature the painter marvelously uses the classic watercolor technique. Snow-melt flood is a rather frightening act of nature well known to whose living near rivers where winters are snowy. The painter used to live near such rivers as famous Volga or smaller Klazma and witnessed many times how seasonal flood causing damage to nearby districts. However the painter turned such calamity to good account. On this watercolor we can see subtle yet contrary states of nature depicted by a master who is expressing his admiration for their innermost beauty of the surrounding world even if such threatful act of nature. The painter had a natural gift for seeing unique features in ordinary things. Levanidov could transform a flood time motive into an extraordinary thing of beauty. Interpreted by a master of his craft it is perceived as a soulful documentation of a lyrical artist's emotional experience. The artist was young and his whole life was before him. Valery Levanidov's art works are in more than 20 state museums in Russia (including the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, State Historical Museum in Moscow, The Museum of Moscow etc) as well as exquisite private art collection in the states and Europe.

I will be happy to provide the necessary information! -------------------- For those who are interested in the Art and in particular in Valery Levanidov's art here is quick summary about the Painter: Valery Ivanovich Levanidov (Russian: Валерий Иванович Леванидов: April 1, 1905 – March 22, 1983 - https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Леванидов,_Валерий_Иванович ) was one of the prominent Russian painters of his era. He was born in Riga, Latvia. The artist received an excellent art education. He studied under Artur W. Fonvizin, Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov and Alexander Osmerkin at the state art school Vkhutemas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vkhutemas). The foundations of Levanidov’s art included truthful portrayals of nature, clear and innocent compositions and sincere tones. The artist’s early paintings are characterized by an intimate lyricism as well as a wise insight to the innermost beauty of the world. Valery Levanidov brilliantly captured the finest nuances of color using subtones in a poetic manner. The painter had a natural gift for seeing unique features in ordinary things. Unassuming subjects like autumnal leaves or a grove of trees could be transformed into the extraordinary as Levanidov could recognize and portray the connection between nature and the spirit world of mankind. Wide inner scale is characteristic in the content of Levanidov's small paintings like those you can see here. Levanidov is just not painting leaves, trees, and sky. Instead he is expressing his admiration for their innermost beauty as interpreted by a master of his craft. Many oil paintings from 1970 however like «Oktober» (from 1972), «Autumnal leaves» (from 1973) and a number of others including «Moscow. South-west» (from the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg) are declarative of this style. Light effects, outright ornamentality, poetics of plastic and colorific generalizations are illustrative of them. In 1984 a personal exhibition of Valery Levanidov’s works was held in Moscow. This was the first time the general public had an opportunity to see all his art works - both oils and water colours -collected together. The exhibition was a major success. Representatives from more than 16 state museums of the former Soviet Union wanted to acquire his art works for their collections. Now more than 20 state museums in Russia as well as private art collection in the states and Europe have the artist's works in their collections. The museums include the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, State Historical Museum in Moscow, The Museum of Moscow, the Nizhny Novgorod State Museum of Art and many other prominent state museums. The art works origin from Valery Levanidov’s heirs."
