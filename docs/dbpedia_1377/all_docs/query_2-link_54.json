        "text": "Here we can see one of Valery Levanidov’s rare nude portraits from the year 1955. This marvelously depicted young woman's half face portrait is lyrical in nature, tender atmosphere spilling from this piece of Soviet art seems to contradictint the mainstream campaigning kindled by formar soviet regime where painters were prompted to paint labourer, collective farmers and all the realitis of life in the Soviet Union - that Soviet facade. A collector's piece of art, framed in wooden Italian frame. A number of Valery Levanidov’s great portraits are owned by state museums in Russia such as the State Vladimir-Suzdal Historical, Architectural and Art Museum-Reserve and the Nizhny Novgorod State Museum of Art etc. Levanidov's works took their rightful place among a succession of model-images created in the 1930's by outstanding painters of Russian art. This atmospheric portrait is exceptional and evocative for those who collect vintage pieces of Fine Arts and of course for all Art lovers! The art work is signed by the Painter and will be provided with a Certificate of Authenticity in the form of a special license obtained from certified experts of fine arts, Moscow, Russia. The Certificate of Authenticity will also be used as an accompanying document for customs purposes like an art of shipment permission (cost for license obtaining already included into the art work price!) Please note In case of Russia original authentic art work (painting, drawing etc) may not leave Russian state boundaries without special license testifiying both authenticity of art work and the fact that this or that particular art work isn't cultural object of Russia! So you may be calm: you get only authentic paintings and drawings, for this the license attached to the parcel!! In light of this I would like to draw your attention to the fact that we simply can not ship quick. If you see a particular time period before the order is shipped and it is a rather great while don't wonder at it! For art works older than 50 years it takes from one week to four weeks to get the necessary shipment permission. But a good news is WE ARE STILL ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MUSEUM QUALITY ART WORKS!!!! For those who are interested in the Art and in particular in Valery Levanidov's art here is quick summary about the Painter: Valery Ivanovich Levanidov (Russian: Валерий Иванович Леванидов: April 1, 1905 – March 22, 1983 - https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Леванидов,_Валерий_Иванович ) was one of the prominent Russian painters of his era. He was born in Riga, Latvia. The artist received an excellent art education. He studied under Artur W. Fonvizin, Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov and Alexander Osmerkin at the state art school Vkhutemas ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vkhutemas). The foundations of Levanidov’s art included truthful portrayals of nature, clear and innocent compositions and sincere tones. The artist’s early paintings are characterized by an intimate lyricism as well as a wise insight to the innermost beauty of the world. Valery Levanidov brilliantly captured the finest nuances of color using subtones in a poetic manner. The painter had a natural gift for seeing unique features in ordinary things. Unassuming subjects like autumnal leaves or a grove of trees could be transformed into the extraordinary as Levanidov could recognize and portray the connection between nature and the spirit world of mankind. Wide inner scale is characteristic in the content of Levanidov's small paintings like those you can see here at etsy. Levanidov is just not painting leaves, trees, and sky. Instead he is expressing his admiration for their innermost beauty as interpreted by a master of his craft. Many oil paintings from 1970 however like «Oktober» (from 1972), «Autumnal leaves» (from 1973) and a number of others including «Moscow. South-west» (from the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg) are declarative of this style. Light effects, outright ornamentality, poetics of plastic and colorific generalizations are illustrative of them. In 1984 a personal exhibition of Valery Levanidov’s works was held in Moscow. This was the first time the general public had an opportunity to see all his art works - both oils and water colours -collected together. The exhibition was a major success. Representatives from more than 16 state museums of the former Soviet Union wanted to acquire his art works for their collections. Now more than 20 state museums in Russia as well as private art collection in the states and Europe have the artist's works in their collections. The museums include the state Russian Museum of St. Petersburg, State Historical Museum in Moscow, The Museum of Moscow, the Nizhny Novgorod State Museum of Art and many other prominent state museums. Now we are proud to have this opportunity to represent some Artist’s art works here at Saatchi Art. All art works origin from Valery Levanidov’s heirs."
