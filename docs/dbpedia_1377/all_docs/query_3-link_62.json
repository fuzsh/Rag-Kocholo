        "text": "On 30 July 2019, on the one-year anniversary of the murder of the three Russian citizens Aleksandr Rastorguev, Orkhan Dzhemal and Kirill Radchenko in the Central African Republic (CAR), the country’s authorities announced that they were suspending their investigation. The official document containing the results of the investigation stated that, “The journalists were stopped by an armed gang of unidentified persons, who then cowardly killed them and stole some of their belongings”.\n\nIn its own investigation the Dossier Center was able to establish that: the version of events that the deaths were the result of a “typical” robbery is invalid; Rastorguev, Dzhemal and Radchenko were put under surveillance; and that the murder was premeditated and carried out by professionals. What’s more, it became clear that over the course of the last year no action had been undertaken by CAR law enforcers to investigate the crime, and that they had ignored or concealed the evidence they had received.\n\nThe Dossier Center acquired documents from the investigation, initiated by CAR’s national gendarmerie, implying that investigators had already established the following by the beginning of August 2018:\n\n1) the murder had been planned in advance (i.e. it was a trap set specifically for the Russian citizens);\n\n2) those who carried out the murder were familiar with the victim’s itinerary;\n\n3) the murder was premeditated (“their goal was to kill the victims”);\n\n4) the killers were professionals.\n\nThe witness statements acquired by the Central African investigators contained a number of facts that for some unknown reason did not make it into the official investigation.\n\nFor example, one witness stated in a testimony from 18 August 2018 that he saw a grey Mitsubishi without a number plate at the scene of the crime [23km away from Sibiu on a road leading to Dekoa] shortly before the murder took place. In their report, CAR investigators concluded that, “The unregistered car could not be found”.\n\nIt is worth noting that, according to a FACA soldier questioned by the Dossier Center, around 19:00 a car driving behind the murdered journalists crossed the exit checkpoint at Sibiu. Gendarme Emmanuel Tuagende Kotofio was in the car. The Dossier Center established that the latter was in continuous operational contact with the journalist’s driver Bienvenue Duvokama.\n\nThe name Tuagende Kotofio appeared in one of the statements of the witnesses question by CAR gendarmes. For example, the questioning of witness 3, a gendarme on duty on the Sibiu-Dekoa road, revealed that on the morning of the day of the murder the car belonging to gendarme Tuagende drove through the checkpoint carrying three Russian citizens. A second car carrying Central Africans drove through after them. The car was being driven by gendarme Sanze (who appears in Kotofio’s Facebook friend list [Dossier Center note]).\n\nAccording to witness 3, immediately after the murder, between 21:00 and 21:30, a Toyota Hilux, which the witness claims belongs to an organisation called Plan International, drove past the village. The gendarmerie’s report notes that – like in the incident with the grey car without a number plate – it was not possible to locate the car.\n\n(see Attachment J.1, J.2)\n\nIt may seem strange that CAR investigators are stopping the investigation and asserting that the murder was “the result of a robbery”, despite knowing about the planned and premeditated nature of the murder of Orkhan Dzhemal, Kirill Radchenko and Aleksandr Rastorguev. However, their response makes more sense, if one considers how diligent employees of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s “Company” had been when thinking up this version of events in time for the day following the murder.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe key aim of this report is to analyze a crime committed in the Central African Republic (CAR) on July 30, 2018, the victims of which were three Russian journalists – Aleksandr Rastorguev, Orkhan Dzhemal and Kirill Radchenko.\n\nThe team’s trip to Africa was organized in the context of creating a documentary film for the Investigation Control Center (a project funded by Mikhail Khodorkovsky) on the activities of Private Military Company «Wagner», affiliated with Kremlin insider and entrepreneur Yevgeny Prigozhin. The version put forward by CAR authorities, which is supported by the Russian Foreign Ministry, states that the murders were committed by a «group of people in turbans speaking Arabic» with the aim of robbing [the journalists].\n\nIn August 2018, the Dossier Center initiated its own independent investigation into the circumstances of the incident. In order to collect documentary and digital data on the crime, stringers were employed in CAR, as well as two international teams of professional investigators who traveled to the country.\n\nThe investigation included:\n\nQuestioning of witnesses in CAR, including those who live in settlements in the immediate vicinity of the murder scene (Kpakou, Sibut, Damara) and in CAR capital Bangui;\n\nInterviews with relatives, friends and acquaintances of the murdered journalists in Russia and abroad;\n\nAnalysis of over 40,000 records of calls by 2,500 subscribers in CAR, received from local telephone companies;\n\nAnalysis of flight data;\n\nReceipt of up-to-date information on the murders and the general situation on the ground, in particular in Bangui, Sibut and Kpakou, from international organizations working in CAR (Médecins Sans Frontières, Reporters Without Borders, MINUSCA, Human Rights Watch) and also activists and journalists familiar with the current situation in CAR;\n\nSystematic monitoring and analysis of data from open sources (UN and NGO reports, media publications);\n\nAnalysis of metadata from mobile communications, social networks, messengers and email correspondence;\n\nAnalysis of the social network and SMS chat histories, chatlogs and activity logs of the deceased journalists’ apps and devices;\n\nA study of lists of foreign UN and NGO staff working in CAR;\n\nResearch into the activities of Russian companies in CAR and neighbouring African countries;\n\nCrowdsourcing – gathering of information by placing adverts on local radio and in social networks.\n\nThe data gathered by the Dossier Centre have revealed the total inadequacy of the official explanation. The investigation has arrived at the following conclusions:\n\nThe explanation based on a «common robbery» is refuted by the facts. Indeed, the nature of the injuries inflicted indicates that the murders were deliberate and professionally executed. They cannot be explained by a simple wish to take possession of the victims’ property.\n\nThe team of journalists had been placed under surveillance in CAR. The journalists’ driver, Bienvenue Douvokama (thought to be an agent of the gendarmerie) was in constant operational contact with gendarme Emmanuel Kotofio, who tracked the journalists’ movements and was in their immediate vicinity.\n\nEmmanuel Kotofio was recognized by Central African Armed Forces (FACA) soldiers at the Sibut checkpoint on the night of the murders. According to witness statements, at around 19:00 on July 30, another vehicle passed right in front the car carrying the team of journalists, which then returned to the Sibut checkpoint at around 20:00. At 20:45 the journalists’ driver reported the attack to residents of the village of Kpakou. There were three Caucasians, presumably Russians, together with Kotofio in the car.\n\nKotofio maintained contact with a man identified by the Dossier Centre as an «instructor in surveillance, counter-surveillance, recruitment and intelligence work» from Aleksandr Sotov’s company M-Finans. Sotov, in turn, communicated with Valery Zakharov, an adviser to the President of the CAR and head of a team instructors in Yevgeny Prigozhin’s «Company».\n\nIt has been established with a high degree of probability that the fixer «Martin» (a «UN worker» whose contact details were provided to the team of journalists by Kirill Romanovsky, a special correspondent of RIA FAN news agency, which is affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin) never existed. He was invented by the coordinators of a thoroughly planned operation. After the murders, «Martin» disappeared. It transpired that although Romanovsky maintained that «Martin» was in Bambari (376 km from the capital of CAR), he had never been there. The journalists never once spoke to «Martin» by phone, because Kirill Romanovsky strongly requested that the ICC employees communicate by text message. He claimed that the signal was poor at «Martin’s» location. Mobile operator data show that «Martin’s» telephone never left Bangui, where there are no palpable communication problems. This is not the only occasion on which Romanovsky provided false information: in a number of other cases Romanovsky’s statements were also untrue.\n\nPreparations were made in advance for the journalists’ arrival. The unidentified organizers of the operation undertook a number of steps to prepare conspiracy. «Martin’s» telephone number was registered using a fake document in the name of Erika Mustermann. «Martin» used the mobile phone for just three days – July 5, 7 and 10, and made no calls from it (except for two calls to the support service on July 5). The telephone number of the driver, Bienvenue, had also been registered in a fictitious name – TOMA MARIANA – on July 27, 2018. According to data from mobile operator Telecel, that number was only active from July 28 to July 30. For the purposes of conspiracy, Bienvenue used a new telephone.\n\nFrom July 31, 2018, a disinformation campaign was mounted to impede the independent investigation. An active role in this was played by Kirill Romanovsky and the media controlled by Prigozhin. The organizers of the campaign are endeavoring to place the responsibility for what happened on the ICC, Arab-speaking bandits or the French security services, and to completely dispel any suspicions around people connected with Yevgeny Prigozhin, including Kirill Romanovsky.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin’s employees are exerting virtually unlimited influence over the preliminary investigation in CAR and are also directly suborning officials.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin is personally involved in managing the «Company’s» projects in CAR and other countries. Facts have been uncovered showing that the activities of Prigozhin’s employees violate the fundamental principles and norms of international law and human rights.\n\nIn June 2019, lawyers of the victims (relatives of the murdered journalists) submitted a petition to the RF Investigative Committee to have an article – entitled Chronicle of a Well-Prepared Death and published by Novaya Gazeta – included in the materials of this criminal case. The article was written on the basis of an investigation of the murders by the Dossier Centre. Documents appended to the petition confirmed that Russian citizens Valery Zakharov and Aleksandr Sotov may possess information of importance to the investigation. The petition requesting that Zakharov and Sotov be questioned were not granted.\n\nThe Dossier Center expresses the hope that this report will facilitate a revision of Russia’s Investigative Committee’s position on this matter.\n\nThe first section of the report provides a chronology of events preceding the murders of the journalists in CAR and a reconstruction of the crime. The second section consists of an analysis of the numerous examples of the inadequacy of the official explanation by the CAR and Russian Federation (RF) law enforcement bodies. The third section describes the activities of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s «Company» in Africa, which has been studied by the Dossier Centre as part of the investigation into the murders of Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguev and Kirill Radchenko.\n\nII THE MURDERS\n\n2.1. Reconstruction of the Murders\n\nTo reconstruct the events of the night of July 30–31, when the Russian journalists were murdered, the Dossier Center gathered statements from witnesses who were at the FACA checkpoint on the way out of Sibut TOWARDS Dekoa. It must be noted that movement through the checkpoint is restricted at night (sunset on July 30 was at 18:02) and is generally permitted only to the local gendarmerie, the army and humanitarian missions. According to the statements from FACA soldiers (names held by the Dossier Center), the journalists’ car crossed the checkpoint at around 19:00. FACA servicemen stated that they had let the journalists’ car through because they had contacted the military base in Sibut and received orders from the Russian instructors to let the team through.\n\nWitnesses at the checkpoint also state that immediately before the journalists’ car, the checkpoint was crossed by a SUV at 19:00. The FACA soldiers recognized one of the passengers of the first vehicle as gendarme Emmanuel Touaguende Kotofio, who was a FACA instructor and had previously trained them. They also noticed that there were three Caucasians, presumably Russians, in the car with Kotofio. The car carrying the gendarme drove back through the checkpoint at around 20.00.\n\nAccording to evidence from Tondo Jule Aimé, the elder of the village of Kpakou, at 20:45 the residents of the village were awoken by Bienvenue, who reported an armed attack. The driver stated that he had managed to flee the scene in a Mitsubishi L200. Bienvenue told the elder that bandits belonging to the Seleka group had wounded him in the stomach. The bandits had ordered the Russians to get out of the vehicle, the journalists had tried to resist and Bienvenue himself had hidden in the car. According to the elder, at around 21:00–21:30 a car belonging to the charity Plan International – an international NGO that works to guarantee human rights – passed the village. The charity’s staff assured him that they would notify MINUSCA in Dekoa of what had happened, but after their departure there was no sign of MINUSCA in the village that night. At around 05:00, the village elder went to the FACA checkpoint in Sibut, where the soldiers told him that they had advised the journalists against traveling at night. They had not heeded the advice, and said that they needed to get to Dekoa, after which they would come back and go to Bambari. According to the elder, he also informed the gendarmerie of what had happened (see Attachments B.21.a, B.21.b, B.21.c, C.24).\n\nThey were then taken to the mortuary in the Hopital de I’Amitie in Bangui.\n\nOn August 4, the bodies of the murdered men were transported from Bangui to Paris, before being flown to Moscow on the night of August 4–5. The victims’ personal effects were sent to a gendarmerie office. According to a statement by Igor Zolotov, a major case investigator at the Directorate for Investigation of Crimes Against the Person and Public Safety in the Main Investigations Directorate of the RF Investigative Committee, three suitcases belonging to Dzhemal, Rastorguev and Radchenko have been stored in the RF embassy in CAR since March 2019, «but there is no possibility of transporting them to Moscow».\n\nThe findings of the forensic examination of the bodies of Dzhemal, Radchenko and Rastorguev supported the conclusion that they died as a result of multiple bullet wounds. It is impossible to define the precise distance from which the shots were fired, but the examination nevertheless established that they were fired not at point-blank range, but still from close by, as particles of gunpowder were found in some of the wounds. The ballistic examination of the bullets extracted from the bodies of Radchenko and Dzhemal showed that they were identical. Bullets of that type are used in the 7.62 mm Kalashnikov assault rifle and modifications of it. A bullet extracted from Radchenko’s body bears traces that could identify the specific weapon used.\n\nIn the opinion of the experts interviewed by the Dossier Center, Orkhan Dzhemal could have been sitting in the right front seat next to the driver. Aleksandr Rastorguev probably sat in the right back seat, and Kirill Radchenko in the left back seat. This assumption is based on the fact that the bodies of Dzhemal and Rastorguev were found next to one another in the high grass to the right of the road.\n\nAnalysis of the direction from which the shots were fired leads to the conclusion that Dzhemal could have tried to hide in the grass and, accordingly, all shots hit him from the back. Kirill Radchenko was probably taken out of the car through the left door and, accordingly, his body was discovered at a distance of several meters from the bodies of Dzhemal and Rastorguev.\n\nThe experts interviewed by the Dossier Center also hypothesize that in such situation there could have been four to six assailants. One or two criminals could have been controlling the driver, and two or three executing the passengers. The experts emphasize that one of the first things that the criminals did was probably to take the key out of the ignition or physically remove the driver.\n\n2.2. Inadequacy of the Official Explanations\n\nOn July 31, 2018, S. Petrenko, an official spokesperson of the RF Investigative Committee, stated that a criminal case had been opened over the deaths of Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguev and Kirill Radchenko under Article 105.2.a of the RF Criminal Code (murder of two or more persons). She noted that «in the framework of the criminal case, in accordance with Russian criminal procedure law and international law, investigative actions will be carried out, including the submission of requests for legal assistance. In addition, the Investigative Committee is willing to provide assistance to the law enforcement bodies of the Central African Republic in the investigation of the extremely grievous crime committed against the journalists».\n\nThe Dossier Center investigation has revealed numerous discrepancies between the officially declared explanations and the actual circumstances of the crime. The explanation given by the CAR investigative bodies is based on the testimony given by the driver Bienvenue, which, as will be shown later, gives rise to numerous questions and is not confirmed by other sources.\n\nThe driver is the only person who survived the attack. How precisely he managed this and how he succeeded in fleeing the scene are questions that are still not fully explained.\n\nAccording to the CAR investigative bodies, the driver’s full name is Bienvenue Douvokama. Numerous attempts by the Dossier Center to establish Bienvenue’s identity and obtain his photographs have been unsuccessful. The Dossier Center has obtained several different photographs of «Bienvenue» from various sources but it is not possible to establish their authenticity. According to statements by some Dossier Center sources, Bienvenue previously served in the gendarmerie or was in the military.\n\nIt is known for sure that after the incident, Bienvenue was held in a pretrial detention center (La Section des Recherches et d’Investigation, SRI) but was later released. His official status in the Russian criminal case is as a witness.\n\nThe ‘Moskovsky Komsomolets’ newspaper quotes diplomatic post from the RF embassy in the CAR as stating that Bienvenue was interrogated only 37 hours after the murders – at 09:58 on August 1. It then reproduces an excerpt from the interrogation (see Attachments B2 and B3 for the full text of the document obtained by the Dossier Center): «Two men appeared on the road with their arms raised in front of them as a sign to stop. I applied the brakes because it was raining and I also wanted to put the hand brake on; when the car stopped, several more armed bandits appeared with masks on their heads and they were speaking only Arabic. They aimed their weapons at us, opened the car doors and ordered us to get out. It was already dark. One of them shot one of the journalists, while the others began getting things out of the car. I held my hands behind my head. Two of the Russians tried to resist the attackers. I took advantage of that moment to jump back into the car whose engine was still running and immediately drove off».\n\nAccording to a letter published in Moskovsky Komsomolets from Russia’s charge d’affaires in CAR, V.G.Tokmakov, which he sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on August 8, 2018, during the interrogation the driver «answered in a confused and indistinct manner, constantly repeating that he didn’t remember who the journalists had spoken to during the trip (on the phone or in person) and who exactly they were going to see»\n\nNumerous inconsistencies in the driver’s statement can be found when comparing the evidence given by him to the gendarmerie on August 1, 2018 (see Attachments B2 and B3), with the statement he gave in February 2019 in an interview with private detective Yevgeny Gvozdev, who had been hired by RIA FAN.\n\nThus, during questioning on August 1, Bienvenue said that he uses two telephone numbers (+23670043220 and +23672117329), and that he did not remember the number he used to communicate with the journalists (+23675378291). Also, he made no mention in his statements of the telephone number +23675465314 which, as Dossier Center has established, was registered to his Bienvenue’s name and used daily in June and July 2018 (Attachment A2). Six months later, in his interview with Gvozdev, Bienvenue Douvokama confirmed that the number +23675378291 belongs to him.\n\nIn his testimony on August 1, 2018, Bienvenue did not mention that his contact details were given to the journalists before they arrived in the CAR. The fact that the arrangements with Bienvenue had been made in advance is confirmed by the correspondence between Rodion Chepel and the fixer «Martin» (see Attachments C.26.a, C.26.b, C.26.c, C.26.d, C.26.e, C.26.f, C.26.g, C.26.h, C.26.i, C.26.j, C.26.k, C.26.l, C.26.m, C.26.n).\n\nOne’s attention is drawn to the wording used on January 11, 2019 by the RF Investigative Committee spokesperson to describe the crime – «killed by bandits during an attempted robbery«. For employees of an investigation body, this wording is legally highly irregular. Robbery means forcible theft of property, committed without the use of violence or with the use of violence with no danger to life or health, or with the threat of such violence. Therefore, robbery is a crime against property, and the object of criminal offence in this case is another person’s property. The criminal case was opened under Point a of Part 2 of Article 105 – murder of two or more persons. This is a completely different corpus delicti with a different object of crime and with a much higher degree of public danger. The official spokesperson of the Investigative Committee cannot fail to understand the difference between a crime against the person and a crime against property. Apparently, the object of the crime was the lives of Orkhan Dzhemal, Aleksandr Rastorguev and Kirill Radchenko, rather than their property and money.\n\nIn his evidence, the driver maintained that he managed to flee the murder scene in his car, in which he drove to Kpakou, the nearest village. It remains unclear why the murderers allowed the driver to escape, thereby leaving a key witness alive. Despite the professional way in which they shot Rastorguev and Radchenko, the murderers did not even attempt to stop the car by shooting at its wheels (see photographs of the car made at the crime scene, Attachment B2). It is known that the car contained the journalists’ valuables (Orkhan Dzhemal’s laptop and other equipment belonging to the team), but it can be assumed that the attackers were more interested in physically harming the victims than in their property. It is also worth noting that the vehicle was equipped with a ParkCity DVR HD 900 dashcam, which the team had brought with them from Russia but which disappeared at an unspecified time after the murders (see Attachment C.27).\n\nMurders of white people are not common in CAR. Over the past several years there has been just one high-profile case, when Camille Lepage, a French journalist, was killed in May 2014. It is known for a fact that her murder was not connected with crime against her property.\n\nThe statements about the «ex-Seleka» group’s involvement in the murder and robbery of Dzhemal, Rastorguev and Radchenko look unfounded. The crime scene is on territory controlled not by «ex-Seleka» but by supporters of the Touadera government. In internal documents of employees of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the territory in which the incident occurred is designated as being under the control of Maxime Mokom, leader of the Anti-Balaka group and Minister for Disarmament, Demobilization, Reintegration and Repatriation. It should also be noted that in the immediate vicinity of the murder scene there is a FACA army base with Russian instructors (Sibut).\n\nMoreover, as follows from the autopsy reports on the murdered journalists examined by the Dossier Center, the nature of the wounds inflicted indicate that the murders were deliberate and professionally executed. Thus, according to the forensic report, multiple wounds, including two wounds inflicted by deliberate shots to the heart, were found on the body of Rastorguev.\n\nDossier Center experts conclude that the shots were fired by people with professional training. The shots were executed precisely, despite the fact that the murders were committed at night in conditions of reduced visibility and on rugged terrain, while the victims were not bound at the time of the murders and were able to move relatively freely.\n\nThe ballistics examination established that the shots were fired from a weapon using a 7.62 mm 1943 model bullet. This type of bullet is used in AK-47 machine guns, AKMs and modifications of them.\n\nThe law enforcement bodies have not carried out a proper examination of the crime scene. Thus, despite the fact that a large number of shots were fired, only two cartridges were found at the scene. A few days after the murders unidentified persons burned the grass at the place where the bodies were found, presumably to conceal evidence.\n\n2.3. Surveillance of the Journalists\n\nThe Dossier Center has managed to establish multiple facts confirming that the murders were preceded by a thoroughly planned and organized surveillance operation by CAR law enforcement agencies.\n\nData from Telecel telephone company, of which the Dossier Center has a copy, indicate that the telephone number for Bienvenue given to the journalists (+23675378291) was registered in the fictitious name of TOMA MARIANA on July 27, 2018. According to the printout, the number was only active from 13:10 on July 28 to 12:01 on July 30 (see Attachment A.1).\n\nThe Dossier Center has established that Bienvenue had another telephone number (+23675465314) that was registered in the name of DOUVOKAMA BIENVENUE on July 5, 2017. The last activity on this number was recorded at 17:41 on July 31, 2018 (see Attachment A.2).\n\nTo communicate with the journalists Bienvenue used not only a new number but also a new telephone. Metadata in the telephone printouts show that throughout July, the SIM card number +23675465314 was inserted in a telephone with IMEI 357456048557971, except between 09:21 and 11:19 on July 28, when it was inserted in a different telephone with IMEI 354000095482481. At 13:30 on July 28, the SIM card with the number +23675378291 was inserted in the telephone with IMEI 354000095482481 and was then used with this telephone right through to July 30 (see Attachments A.1 and A.2). There is every reason to believe that on July 28 Bienvenue received a new SIM card (+23675378291) and a new telephone (IMEI 354000095482481) specifically for communicating with the team of journalists (see Attachment A.1). His old SIM card (+23675465314) had apparently been inserted into the new telephone to check that it was working.\n\nIt transpires from printouts of Bienvenue’s telephone activity that the journalists’ driver was in constant communication with gendarmerie representative Emmanuel Touagende Kotofio (telephone number +23675717428) during their trip to CAR (see Attachments A.1 and A.3). As mentioned earlier, Kotofio was recognized by soldiers at the checkpoint in Sibut, who stated that he was in the immediate vicinity of the murder scene not long before the crime was committed. Telephone number +23675717428 is linked to a Facebook account in the name of Emmanuel Touagende Kotofio (https://www.facebook.com/emmanuel.touaguendekotofio). A copy of Kotofio’s ID submitted upon registration of the SIM card is given in the attachment.\n\nAnalysis of printouts of telephone activity by Bienvenue and Emmanuel Kotofio show that between July 28 and July 30 Kotofio (+23675717428) and Bienvenue (+23675378291) communicated 47 times by phone (including calls and text messages) (see Attachments A.1 and A.3). The regular short calls exchanged between Bienvenue and Kotofio are presumably evidence of operational communications (to report the journalists’ whereabouts, for example). The data provide grounds for concluding that Bienvenue was coordinating his actions with Kotofio. In addition, several local sources have confirmed to the Dossier Center that driver Bienvenue was a gendarmerie agent.\n\nBienvenue’s statement that he used the telephone with the number +23675378291 for private calls to communicate with his friend Kotofio does not stand up to scrutiny. Thus, an analysis of the telephone calls from Bienvenue’s second number (+23675465314) and five other telephone numbers identified by the Dossier Center shows that the first telephone conversation between them in July 2018 was at 18:46 on 21st (see Attachments A.2 and A.3). The intensity of communication between them increased on July 28 – the day the journalists arrived.\n\nJuly 1–20 – 0 calls\n\nJuly 21 – 2 calls\n\nJuly 23 – 6 calls\n\nJuly 24 – 11 calls\n\nJuly 25 – 4 calls\n\nJuly 26 – 5 calls\n\nJuly 27 – 5 calls\n\nJuly 28 – 36 calls\n\nJuly 29 – 5 calls\n\nJuly 30 – 12 calls\n\nIt should be noted that the journalists received CAR visas on July 11, so from at least that day the CAR authorities were informed of their imminent arrival in Bangui.\n\nMetadata from Kotofio’s telephone conversations confirm that during the journalists’ trip to CAR he was constantly in their immediate vicinity. On July 28 and 29, Kotofio was in the center of Bangui near the Hotel National, where Dzhemal, Rastorguev and Radchenko were staying. Data on calls made on July 30 indicate that on that day Kotofio, like the journalists, was in the towns of Damara and Sibut. It has been established that at around 15:00 the team of journalists were in Damara; at 14:56 OSMO camera activity was recorded in Radchenko’s Google account. According to telephone metadata for Emmanuel Kotofio, a signal from his number +23675717428 was recorded by the DAMARA_1 tower at 13:28, and by the SIBUT_1 tower at 16:07.\n\nAccording to the telephone activity printouts, Kotofio’s last incoming call was at 16:07 on July 30, when he was in Sibut. From that moment right up to August 12, 2018, Kotofio’s number +23675717428 was inaccessible. From August 12, Kotofio’s number was active and remains active to this day. Kotofio’s five other telephone numbers continued to be active from August 1 to August 12 (see Attachment A.3).\n\nThe Dossier Center has established a number of significant details in Kotofio’s biography. It transpires, for example, that he had previously received military retraining in Sudan (camp at Am Dafog) organized by Russian instructors from the «Company». Dossier Center sources also report that Kotofio received a promotion some time after the murders.\n\nFrom Kotofio’s telephone printouts it can be seen that he was in constant contact with several gendarmes and FACA officers whose identifies have been established by the Dossier Center. According to information from local sources, Emmanuel Kotofio maintains close contact with Russian instructors in CAR and was spotted as a driver for the Russian military some time after the murders.\n\nKotofio figures as a witness in the materials of the criminal case opened by the RF Investigative Committee.\n\nThe investigation by the Dossier Center has established that Aleksandr Sotov is a former officer of the Internal Troops of the RF Ministry of Internal Affairs and lives in St Petersburg. In July and August 2018, including the day on which the journalists were murdered, he was in CAR, as indicated by pay slips of the «Company» (see Attachments B7 and B8), obtained by the Dossier Center, and a request to book tickets from Bangui to Saint-Petersburg (see Attachment B9). It follows from the documents that Sotov has been assigned the personal PMC Wagner employee number М-5661. In the company’s staff schedule Sotov is named as an «Instructor in Surveillance, Counter-surveillance, Recruitment and Intelligence Work».\n\nAn analysis of telephone data for the two numbers registered in the name of Hammond Barret Travis (Attachments А4 and А5), shows that there were 34 shared contacts, including numbers registered to the following individuals: ZAKHAROV VALERY (+23675387607); ZAKHAROV VALERY (+23675633893); ZAKHAROV VALERY (+23675633909); ZAKHAROV VALERY (+23675205108); ZAKHAROV VALERY (+23675633925); EVSTIGNEEV KIRILL (+23675189068); BARILOVICH ANZHELIKA (+23675597751); PANOV ZAKHAR (+23675217352); ZHUKOV ROMAN (+23675334681); MAKOVSKY ARTUR (+23675517841). Internal documents from M-Finans and M Invest show that all the above individuals are employees of those companies, which are affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin (see Attachment B10).\n\nValery Zakharov (an official security adviser to the president of the CAR) is named in the «Company’s» records as a «head of group of instructors» with the personal PMC Wagner employee number М-5658 shown next to his name. It has also been established that Zakharov has dual citizenship – RF and CAR (as indicated in a copy of a visa form from the RF embassy in CAR (see Attachment B11).\n\nIn total, in July and August 2018, the owner of the SIM card registered in the name of Hammond Barret Travis contacted Valery Zakharov on both numbers 167 times, including calls and text messages.\n\nA study of the metadata from the telephone conversations of Hammond Barret Travis (+23675742579) and Valery Zakharov (+23675633909) established that at various times during July 2018 they used the same Motorola telephone with IMEI 355645081443791. The telephone was used in the same place (OUANGO, Bangui) (see Attachments А4 and А6). In January 2019, the BBC managed to establish the location from which Aleksandr Sotov could have sent some photographs to his wife Olga Sidorenko .The journalists reported that the building by the Ubangi River is adjacent to a military base of the CAR General Staff (Camp De Roux) and is 500 m from the Russian embassy. This coincides with the location at which the telephones registered to Hammond Barret Travis (+23675742579) and Valery Zakharov (+23675633909) were used. A copy of a PoA in Aleksandr Sotov’s name, obtained by the Dossier Center, shows that Valery Zakharov is his immediate superior (see Attachment C.31).\n\nThus, on June 1, 2018, he repeatedly typed search requests in Russian and French: «Russian convoy in Bangui» [convoy russe a bangui], «Russians in Bangui» [russes a bangui] and «Russians in Central Africa».\n\nRomanovsky’s interest in the CAR may be explained by the fact that previously, as a cameraman, he had been involved in a Russian convoy from Sudan to CAR, which also included representative of the RF Defense Ministry and PMC Wagner fighters. A photograph found in open access shows Romanovsky in the vicinity of Birao (northern CAR, 45 km from the border with Sudan) accompanying a Russian convoy in May 2018. It transpires that the sponsor of Romanovsky’s Sudanese visa was a Sudanese company called Aswar Multi Activities. Attached hereto (Attachment B13) is a copy of the draft contract between Aswar and a company called Meroe Gold (Sudan), which is affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin.\n\nThe Dossier Center has obtained a copy of a Sudanese entry permit in the name of Kirill Romanovsky, dated March 26, 2018 (see Attachment B14), confirmation of a flight from Syria to Sudan, evidence of crossing the CAR border on May 5, 2018 (Am Dafok checkpoint) and data on a flight from Bangui to St Petersburg on May 23, 2018 (see Attachments C.40.a, C.40.b, C.40.c). The Dossier Center has received confirmation that the permit to enter Sudan was sent to Romanovsky by Mikhail Potepkin, regional director of M Invest, a company affiliated with Prigozhin (see Attachment C.41).\n\nIncidentally, Kirill Romanovsky never mentioned his work trip to Sudan and CAR either to ICC staff or in his personal social media accounts.\n\nOn June 16, 2018, Romanovsky typed into his search engine a link to Yandex-Disk containing files with a video of the movement of that same Russian convoy to CAR. At 01:43 on the video, Kirill Romanovsky’s face can be seen amongst local CAR residents while an off screen voice talks about deliveries of medicines to Bria and Bambari.\n\nOn June 21, he searched several times for «presentation of state awards» and «June 28 award presentation», while on June 29 there were numerous searches «on presentation of the Award of Courage to Romanovsky» and also «benefits and payments for Award of Courage in 2018: procedure for receipt, amount». This information ties in with the fact that on June 25 Romanovsky informed Andrey Konyakhin of his award.\n\nAccording to his browsing history, on the eve of the murder – at 12:38 GMT on July 30 – there was a search request «Russians in CAR». At 11:45 on the morning of July 31, Romanovsky googled «Article 105» (this article of the Russian Criminal Code is entitled «Murder») and then twice (at 12:00 and 12:10) «russes a Bangui» (Russians in Bangui). At 15:03 a search request was recorded for «three Russians killed», and at 15:31 ‒ «Sibut» (see Attachment B12). It should be noted that the first report of the murdered Russians was published by AFP at 7:03 GMT.\n\nAccording to the information available to the Dossier Center, as confirmed by multiple sources, all investigative activities in Bangui have, to all intents and purposes, been discontinued. V.G. Tokmakov, Russia’s Charge d’Affaires in CAR, described the situation as follows: «There is an impression that the local law enforcement bodies are not particularly eager to investigate the murder of the Russian journalists, and are only relying on the work to be done by Russian investigators».\n\nIn August 2018, Russia and the CAR signed an intergovernmental agreement on military cooperation, delivery of arms and dispatch of Russian military instructors to CAR; in April 2019, it was supplemented with an agreement on the establishment of a Representative Office of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation in CAR. In addition, the parties reached an agreement on «direct interaction between law enforcement bodies and cooperation in criminal and other matters» . Despite that, from a petition filed in the case by the victim Aleksandr Radchenko, father of Kirill Radchenko, it follows that no case documents have been received from CAR, and requests filed by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation remain unanswered.\n\nIn September 2018, Marina Andreeva, legal counsel for the victims (Aleksandr Radchenkoand Irina Gordienko, former wife of Orkhan Dzhemal), requested that the clothes of the murdered journalists be delivered to Moscow to enable a complete ballistics examination, and filed a petition with the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation to instruct cellular providers from the Central African Republic to release printouts of mobile calls to/from the phones of Dzhemal, Rastorguev, and Radchenko. As of July 2019, her petition has not been satisfied. It also remains unclear why the full set of required forensic examinations had not been conducted prior to repatriation of the bodies to Russia. The embalming performed back in the CAR destroyed or damaged critical trace evidence that could have been instrumental in a more precise determination of (a) the time of death of the journalists, and (b) the distance from which the shots had been fired.\n\nOn June 9, 2019, Counsel Andreeva filed another petition addressed to Igor Zolotov, Special Investigator, Division for Investigation of Crimes against Persons and Public Safety, Chief Investigative Division, Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, with a request to incorporate in the case materials the article Chronicle of a Well Prepared Death by Denis Korotkov, published in Novaya Gazeta and based on the murder investigation materials collected by the Dossier Center. The petition had several enclosures, including telephone billing printouts for the driver Bienvenue and the gendarme Emmanuel Kotofio, as well as documents proving that Russian citizens Valery Zakharov and Aleksandr Sotov may have access to information that could be of interest to the investigative team. Upon expiry of the official response deadline, investigator Zolotov first said that he had not received any petition, and then gave orders to decline the petition in respect of interrogating Zakharov and Sotov, «as the materials currently available in the criminal case do not contain sufficient data showing that the aforementioned individuals have access to any information of an evidentiary nature».\n\nA review of publications on this matter in various sources, including the official websites of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, clearly demonstrates the existence of a common tendency to:\n\nPlace all responsibility for the incident on the ICC;\n\nDeny the role played by «Martin» and Kirill Romanovsky;\n\nPresent the role played by the driver in a completely different light;\n\nPromote the version according to which the criminal offense was directed not at the journalists, but rather at their property and cash, which diminishes the public danger of the act (murder is a graver crime than robbery or plunder);\n\nClear of any suspicious those Russian citizens who were in CAR and whose names came up during the investigation.\n\nAmong the publications which offer a biased view of the murder and serve to misinform the public and obstruct the investigation, two deserve special mention: RIA FAN article Blood Is Special Juice dated October 15, 2018, and article Who Stands Behind the Murder of Russian Journalists in the CAR dated June 6, 2019. In February 2019, the Federal News Agency hired Yevgeny Gvozdev, a private detective, to «examine new information and circumstances and verify the facts mentioned in various speculations by numerous mass media in connection with the murder of the ICC group in the Central African Republic». As Irina Gordienko, former wife of Orkhan Dzhemal who has been accorded the status of a victim in the case, noted in her statement, it is rather suspicious that Gvozdev, being a private individual, was granted access to the case materials and given an opportunity to interrogate certain witnesses, including military personnel and gendarmes, something that the Investigative Committee had been unable to do prior to that. The RIA FAN material intersperses information obtained by Gvozdev with pure speculation, which removes any doubt as to whether its authors may have pursued any objective other than to mislead the readers.\n\nFor example, the publication advances the version according to which «Martin» is the «French militant Dominique Christophe Raineteau, a.k.a. Alpha, an individual closely linked to criminal gangs, as he frequently had meetings with Force [real name – Nimeri Matar Jamus], the leader of a Muslim group«. That conclusion is drawn on the basis of the testimony provided by the driver Bienvenue, who claimed that he had been given the telephone number that he used to contact the journalists by a man named Yusuf who had been working with Christophe (Alpha). The assumption that the fixer «Martin» and Dominique Raineteau are the same person appears absurd due to the well-known fact that Kirill Romanovsky introduced the contact to the group as «Martin – UN officer and Dutchman».\n\nIt should be noted that even before February 13, 2019, RIA FAN published an article about Christophe Raineteau subtitled: Mysterious Martin proves to be an agent of a French special service, founder of a mercenary army, and former advisor to CAR’s ex-president François Bozizé, a person whom Interpol holds to be a terror suspect. The article advances the completely unfounded assumption that «Christophe «Martin» Raineteau, a person who recently found himself in the center of mass media attention and whom CAR authorities suspect of having committed an act of terrorism, and who has an extensive influence network spanning the continent, may prove to be the liaison long sought after by both African and Russian investigators». When read together, the two publications create an impression that they seek to misinform the readers and draw their attention away from the role played by Romanovsky, who had provided ICC representatives with contact information for the fixer «Martin».\n\nIn an interview to the private detective Yevgeny Gvozdev featured in the RIA FAN material dated June 6, the driver Bienvenue Douvokama confirmed that the telephone number that he had been using to talk to the journalists (+23675378291) was, in fact, owned by him, and stated that he had been acquainted with Kotofio for many years, and that they had a friendly relationship. According to Bienvenue, the number had been supplied to him by a man going by the name of «Yusuf», who suggested that he should work as the driver for the Russians. Bienvenue maintains that he received the SIM card in Bangui in the morning, several hours before the meeting with the journalists. The Dossier Center was not able to confirm the existence of a man by the name of «Yusuf». It is critically important that the journalists received Bienvenue’s number and name from «Martin» (the fixer recommended by Kirill Romanovsky) on July 27, i.e. one day before Bienvenue, according to his own statement, had received the SIM card (see Attachments C.43.a, C.43.b).\n\nAt 19:25 Bangui time, Pyotr Bychkov, head of the so-called «back office» maintained by Prigozhin in Saint Petersburg, wrote (see Attachment C.56) in the chat that he and Valery Zakharov had come up with an idea as to what position everyone should take: «Those shady individuals, probably acting under orders from Khodor [Khodorkovsky], headed for Kaga-Bandoro where, according to MINUSCA, a rebel meeting was under way with the participation of Ali Darassa, Al Khatim, and Abdoulaye Hissène. About 10 Arabic-speaking rebels stopped the journalists to rob them. The driver, although wounded, managed to escape, he is being interrogated» (here and below spelling and punctuation of the authors are preserved). It should be noted that the first media reports alleging that the journalists were attacked by 10 Arabic-speaking rebels appeared later that evening (time of The Associated Press publication dated July 31 – 21:15 GMT). The first official interrogation of the driver Bienvenue (where he did not specify the exact number of assailants) took place only at 09:58 on August 1, 2018.\n\nSubsequent discussion (19:27–19:30) deals with who is to promote the version fabricated by Bychkov and Zakharov, with the Embassy or the CAR Security Service being suggested as possible conduits (see Attachment C.57). The wording used by the chat participants appear ambiguous, to say the least: «Why should we come up with an official statement regarding this incident, anyway? What do we have to do with it? Aren’t we gonna give ourselves away if we stick our noses in this mess? What does it matter to us who died there and why it happened? The Ambassador has already provided his comments. Should we say something too?» (Vadim Kuptsov, 19:27–19:28); «It may just happen that uneasy conscience betrays itself» (Taras, 19:29); «Now all journalists in the country (and Ukrainians, too) are looking at the CAR. Anyone who speaks up will stand out like a sore thumb» (Taras, 19:30).\n\nAt 20:21, Vadim Kuptsov sends in a detailed information campaign plan (see Attachment C.60), including the time when the head of the gendarmerie should make a statement regarding the progress of the investigation and the current theories, and a description of a social media strategy envisaging proliferation of «discussions and possible versions (including downright stupid versions) of what those people may have been doing there». Moreover, in his message Kuptsov directly says that it is necessary to «think up» a version of what happened, and conceal the fact that the journalists were planning to film PMC activities: «As for what those people were doing there, we need to think it up. Any versions that they were filming PMC activities, or working for Khodor [Khodorkovsky], should be killed off. I think we can say that they came to CAR to make a film about the successful work that Russian instructors have been doing for the FACA. And they simply met with some bad luck on the road. As for us, we are training the FACA – officially, openly, and legally. Then the story about why Russian journalists appeared there will be logical. It would be desirable to end this whole story with some high-ranking politician (maybe even someone from FAT) making a statement condemning the incident and offering apologies to Russia and to family members».\n\nDiscussion in the chat contains more statements indicating that a disinformation campaign was being planned: «In any case, we need to make a play on the reason for their presence in the CAR. Otherwise there will remain room for conjecture and inconvenient assumptions» (Vadim Kuptsov, 20:32); «It is critical that no-one comes up with a version that they have been prevented from finishing some film, it is essential to find the perp suggested by the gendarmerie» (FUNKYBOSS, 20:48).\n\nAt 20:52–20:53, Pyotr Bychkov sent the following message: «We have discussed this. the perps spoke Arabic. I’ll discuss this with the chief now when the un comes online – whether we can charge abd… with this thing» (see Attachment C.61).\n\nOn October 7, 2017, representatives of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s «Company» held a meeting in Sochi with members of the Government of CAR to determine the key areas of strategic partnership, specifically: (1) establishment of a mining company; (2) social policy and information matters; and (3) security matters (see Attachment B18). It should be noted that two days later, on October 9, 2017, Sergey Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, held an official meeting in Sochi with Faustin-Archange Touadéra, President of the Central African Republic, at which they agreed to increase intergovernmental cooperation in the political, economic, and humanitarian areas.\n\nAccording to the memorandum on establishment of a mining company, as signed by representatives of the Russian Federation affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin and the Central African party, it was resolved that a group of Russian experts (lawyers, geologists, and political strategists) should be dispatched to the CAR by October 16, 2017. The document noted that, «having considered the order, as issued by the President of the Republic to the Presidium, to assist implementation of the current project, CAR party undertakes to accelerate and simplify, to the maximum extent possible, any and all bureaucratic procedures». Moreover, the CAR President undertook to ask the country’s customs bodies to simplify importation of industrial equipment and reduce customs duties.\n\nAccording to the plan, the company was to obtain a license by November 26, 2017, and an exploration permit by January 15, 2018, with commencement of work scheduled for February 10, 2018. It was agreed that Russian geologists would be able to engage in primary exploration of the fields even before the issuance of the license, provided that they would be accompanied by specialists from the Mining Ministry of the CAR. It was noted that «the parties, acting by mutual consent, select the following priority areas for their activities related to research and exploration of the fields and organization of production: Lobaye, Haute-Kotto. The Central African party also notes that one of the key areas with the highest number of diamond fields is situated in the vicinity of the town of Ouadda».\n\nThe memorandum also noted that the purpose of providing adequate protection to the fields slated for development justified the presence of armed Russian specialists in CAR. Security arrangements included dispatching Russian specialists to CAR to engage in personal protection of the President and provision of advanced training to CAR servicemen.\n\nThe Dossier Center managed to confirm that the above agreements were, indeed, implemented in accordance with the schedule. On October 25, 2017, Yevgeny Khodotov, one of Prigozhin’s employees, registered in CAR a company called Lobaye Invest, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Russian company «M-Finans» (see Attachment C.64). Lobaye Invest specializes in extraction of gold and diamonds, particularly in the prefectures of Lobaye and Haute-Kotto and, presumably, at the Ndassima Gold Mine. On April 4, 2018, Lobaye Invest was granted a permit to develop gold fields in the vicinity of four Central African towns: Bangassou, Ouadda, Bria, and Sam Ouandja.\n\nPhotographs made in the CAR office of the «Company» in May 2018 show that at least four AK-47 assault rifles were stored on the premises (similar firearms were used to shoot the journalists). The weapons were freely accessible to civil personnel of the «Company» (interpreters, politologists, etc.). «Company» employees visited the shooting range on multiple occasions (see Attachments C.68.a, C.68.b, C.68.c, C.68.d).\n\nThe «politologists» listed in payroll sheets are assigned to a separate area of operations of the «Company» where their key tasks are to conduct sociological research, gather intelligence, and manipulate public opinion. Incidentally, activities related to «social policy and information matters» were named as one of the critical strategic initiatives in the memorandum signed by representatives of the Russian Federation affiliated with Prigozhin and representatives of the CAR Government on October 7, 2017 (see Attachment B18). Those activities included, among other things, «building up awareness of the program of the President of the Central African Republic among the general population, and creation of a positive image with a view to improve capital investment climate».\n\nThe Dossier Center examined an internal presentation prepared by employees of the «Company» to assess the results of its operations in the CAR during the period from October 2017 to October 2018. From that presentation, it follows that the «Company’s» «politologists» were charged with organization of humanitarian assistance, provision of information support to the policies pursued by President Touadéra, and sociological research (see Attachment B23).\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin has continuously denied any links to both PMC Wagner and commercial entities operating in CAR, Sudan, Madagascar, South Africa, and other countries. Nevertheless, materials obtained by the Dossier Center indicate that Yevgeny Prigozhin is personally involved in the African project, and exercises systemic control over the operations of the «Company».\n\nFor example, the Dossier Center has obtained a document from M Invest, a company affiliated with Prigozhin, addressed to Mikhail Bogdanov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and signed personally by Yevgeny Prigozhin (see Attachment B24). The document contains a request to provide assistance with accelerated processing of applications for Russian entry visas filed by two CAR ministers (Thierry Herve Oronfei-Fiogbia and Rameaux Claude Bireau) and one citizen of South Sudan (Issa Hassan Mohamed Abouna). The visit to discuss joint projects with M Invest was scheduled for August 23–28, 2017. The document was registered by the Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation under No. 6616 on August 21, 2017.\n\n3.2 The Activities of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s «Company» in the Context of International Law and Violations of Human Rights\n\nWhile reviewing the foreign activities of the «Company», experts of the Dossier Center provided a legal assessment of the operations conducted by persons associated with Yevgeny Prigozhin outside of the Russian Federation.\n\nSeveral years ago, it became clear that Prigozhin’s interests had gone not only beyond his restaurant and catering business, but also beyond Russia’s borders. The mass media note that «the name of Yevgeny Prigozhin has become synonymous with the informal presence of Russia in conflict areas where it has its interests, from Syria to West Africa and Venezuela«. That presence is maintained by PMC Wagner mercenaries who were first seen in the Lugansk People’s Republic and Donetsk People’s Republic in 2014.\n\nThe virtually complete absence of information about PMC Wagner in official sources is not surprising, as the operations conducted by the company were criminalized in 1996 with the approval of a new version of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation. Article 359 of the Penal Code of the Russian Federation treats mercenary activities as a separate crime. The notion «mercenary» is defined in a note to the article: a «mercenary» is a person acting for material compensation who is not a citizen of the state involved in an armed conflict or military hostilities, does not permanently reside in the territory of such state, and it not dispatched to such state to discharge official duties. The key words here are «armed conflict or military hostilities». This is where legal treatment of mercenary activities by the Russian criminal law differs from international law: in the Russian criminal law doctrine, mercenary activities are defined much narrower compared to international laws and regulations.\n\nAccording to international law, a «mercenary» is any person who is specially recruited locally or abroad to fight in an armed conflict, is motivated essentially by the desire for private gain, is neither a national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the conflict, is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict, and has not been sent by a state which is not a party to the conflict on official duty. Therefore, mercenaries are «recruited to fight or attack in a country or conflict in which they are not directly involved». According to part 2 of Article 1 of the 1989 Convention, the term «mercenary» also means any other person who, in any other situation, is specially recruited locally or abroad for the purpose of participating in a concerted act of violence aimed at overthrowing a government or otherwise undermining the constitutional order of a state, or undermining the territorial integrity of a state.\n\nThe Convention notes that mercenaries are recruited, used, financed and trained for activities which violate principles of international law, such as those of sovereign equality, political independence, territorial integrity of states and self-determination of peoples. The Convention establishes that mercenary activities violate the fundamental principles of international law enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and other international laws and regulations, and that any person involved in such activities is subject to criminal prosecution or extradition.\n\nThe problems related to mercenary activities and the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights are discussed in Resolution of the UN General Assembly dated January 23, 2017. In paragraph 12 of the Resolution, the General Assembly condemns any form of impunity granted to perpetrators of mercenary activities and to those responsible for the use, recruitment, financing and training of mercenaries, and urges all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law, to bring them, without distinction, to justice. The Resolution pays considerable attention to the activities of private companies offering international military consultancy and security services, and proposes to impose a ban on such companies intervening in armed conflicts or actions to destabilize constitutional regimes. The Resolution makes special note of the need to register and license such private military companies in order to ensure that their services neither impede the exercise of human rights nor violate human rights in the recipient country. In paragraph 7, the General Assembly emphasizes its utmost concern over the impact of the activities of private military and security companies on the exercise of human rights, in particular when operating in armed conflicts, and notes that private military and security companies and their personnel are rarely held accountable for violations of human rights».\n\nThe fact that Russia has withdrawn its signature under the Rome Statute and no longer recognizes the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court means that it cannot be held accountable under the Rome Statute for its actions in Ukraine, Syria, and other countries, including actions perpetrated with the participation of mercenaries trained by PMC Wagner. Nevertheless, mercenary activities in Ukraine have not gone unnoticed: in 2017 PMC Wagner was included in the US Sanctions List for its participation in the undeclared war in Ukraine. As noted in a US Treasury press release, PMC Wagner has recruited and sent soldiers to fight alongside separatists in eastern Ukraine and, as a result, was «designated for being responsible for or complicit in, or having engaged in, directly or indirectly, actions or policies that threaten the peace, security, stability, sovereignty, or territorial integrity of Ukraine». Dmitry Utkin, leader of PMC Wagner, was designated at the same time and for the same reasons, as well as for «acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, PMC Wagner» . Yevgeny Prigozhin had been designated one year before for his involvement in military hostilities conducted by Russia in Ukraine.\n\nInformation regarding the possible presence of Russian mercenaries in CAR began to emerge in the spring of 2018. Reuters, citing local mass media, stated that PMC Wagner had been active in CAR ever since Russia had supplied light weapons to the country’s security forces in 2018. In particular, hundreds of the «Company’s» instructors were used to train local soldiers. According to a report prepared by the UN Security Council Panel of Experts and published on December 14, 2018, in May 2018 and October 2018 Russian instructors were involved in transporting materiel from Sudan into CAR for the construction of hospitals and vehicles, respectively. Until April 2018, the presence of Russian instructors among the Presidential Guard was part of the training exercise. Thereafter, the instructors were replaced by six Russian nationals employed by the Central African private company Sewa Security. Sewa Security is also known to have been used to reinforce the CAR President’s security. Sewa Security employees were seen next to the President Faustin-Archange Touadéra in August 2018. The Dossier Center has obtained confirmation that Sewa Security documents were maintained by employees of Prigozhin’s «Company».\n\nFrom a memorandum signed by representatives of the Russian Federation affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin and members of the CAR Government that recently became available to the Dossier Center, it follows that protection of the CAR President was one of the priority cooperation areas designated at the meeting in Sochi on October 7, 2017: «The Russian party also believes that it is necessary to effect preliminary selection of, and provide advanced training to, members of the personal security team of the President of the Central African Republic. In connection with the foregoing, the Russian Federation is prepared to supply an armored vehicle and modern security equipment, and dispatch an expert team to organize personal protection of the President of the Central African Republic». Another agreement between the Russian party and the CAR Government, as listed in the document, dealt with «creating conditions for protection by assuring free passage through the Sudan»: «During the discussion, the parties came to an agreement that the presence of armed foreign specialists may be justified in this context by the need to protect mineral deposits development areas. Those specialists could be disguised as employees of a Sudanese security firm». To perform that task, the parties resolved to create a secret military training center in the Ouadda airfield: «The Central African party recognized the need to create a training center for the members of the National Guard who are citizens of the Central African Republic».\n\nSection 2.5 of the document entitled «Matters Related to Interaction with the UN and MINUSCA, Including Deployment of Armed Forces and Their Legalization in the Territory of CAR» deserves special notice. It says that, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution No. 2127 dated December 5, 2013, deployment of armed forces and their use for protection and security purposes is possible only at the request of the CAR President as authorized by the UN Security Council. The Central African party noted that in practice it may take up to three months to obtain such authorization, but it «sees no obstacles that would prevent creation of a presidential security unit pending receipt of the required authorization. Should the UN and MINUSCA raise any issues in connection with that situation, the Government of the Central African Republic will provide justification for the presence of Russian military personnel».\n\nFollowing negotiations between Sergey Lavrov, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, and Faustin-Archange Touadéra, President of the Central African Republic (Sochi, October 9, 2017), Russia requested that the UN Security Council grant an exemption from the CAR arms embargo to enable the transfer to the CAR government of military equipment and the launch of a local military personnel training program. In December, the UN granted to Russia an authorization to deliver the first weapons shipment to CAR. On December 26, 2017, the UN Security Council Committee received a notification from the Russian Federation regarding the training of Central African defense and security forces by 5 military and 170 civilian Russian instructors for a period of one year.\n\nThe first training session for CAR national defense and security personnel conducted by military (5) and civil (170) Russian instructors, as notified to the Committee on December 26, 2017, was completed on March 31, 2018. Training took place in the territory of the CAR and the Sudan. Since April 2018, Russian instructors also started the training of 160 policemen and 50 gendarmes at a military installation in Berengo. It is also known that the agreement between CAR and Russia envisaged delivery of grenade launchers, machine guns and pistols and provision of training to two battalions (1,300) in using those weapons. From an internal presentation prepared by Prigozhin’s employees, it follows that as of October 7, 2018, Russian instructors had trained 1,227 FACA soldiers.\n\nBy December 2018, Russian instructors also trained 102 policemen and 117 gendarmes at a military installation in Berengo. It is known that Russian instructors are deployed in the cities of Bambari, Bangassou, Bangui, Berengo, Bouar, Dekoa, Paoua, and Sibut.\n\nDuring the period from January 26, 2018, to February 7, 2018, nine aircraft arrived in Bangui M’Poko International Airport to deliver weapons and munitions within the framework of military cooperation between the governments of the Russian Federation and the Central African Republic. According to a memorandum dated February 6, 2018, prepared by Christian Bader, French Ambassador to the CAR (a copy of which is available to the Dossier Center), the aircraft were unloaded by Russians, usually at night, in the presence of EU Training Mission representatives (while UNMAS representatives properly authorized by the UN Special Envoy Office were conspicuously absent at all times), whereupon the cargo was taken to Camp de Roux which was not properly equipped to store weapons and munitions (see Attachments B27a, B27b). The memo also expresses concern in connection with the lack of control over deliveries: «Even though Russia asserts that its actions are «completely transparent», at this time there is no reliable information as to the quantity of delivered weapons or the plans for their subsequent deployment». Moreover, the memo noted that the first 22 Russian instructors who had arrived in December 2017 may have been using fake passports. According to the French Embassy, several dozen Russian nationals who arrived in the CAR usually came in small groups, some of which included representatives of private companies. Berengo was indicated as the key area of deployment of Russian nationals outside of Bangui. About 15 Russian nationals (Sewa Security employees) were already on site preparing the infrastructure required for training CAR military personnel; the first group of CAR soldiers (200 people) had been sent for training to Sudan, specifically, to a military base to the north of Khartoum. The French Embassy memo contains the following conclusion: «Weapons deliveries to the CAR Government increasingly look like an «entry ticket» for Russian economic interests, in particular, oligarchs from V. Putin’s inner circle, who are served on site by shady dealers and various intermediaries, some linked to Syria, Sudan, and Qatar, some even involved in illegal trade in resources conducted by armed groups which consist of former Séléka supporters thriving on kickbacks».\n\nInformation on close contacts between Prigozhin’s «Company» and the rebels, as obtained by the Dossier Center, is presented in Section 2 of this report. That information is corroborated by Christian Bader’s memo: «…The Russians are establishing contacts with representatives of «ex-Séléka» armed groups, in particular, its radical wing represented by the Popular Front for the Rebirth of the Central African Republic (FPRC) headed by Noureddine Adam and Abdoulaye Hissène, an entity which is controlled by the National Security Service of Chad and receives weapon shipments from the neighboring Darfur. Several sources (including Mahamat Kamoun, former CAR Prime Minister, with whom I met yesterday) report that negotiations are under way between the FPRC and Russian emissaries (including Yevgeny Khodotov), with meetings held at the border between the CAR and the Sudan. In addition, we have confirmed information provided by a US colleague according to which at the end of January Sudanese intelligence organized negotiations in Khartoum between Noureddine Adam and a delegation from Russia. According to Mr. Kamoun who maintains that he is in direct contact with the FPRC, members of that group are currently saying they have no intention to end the dialog brokered by the African Union negotiating commission, and wish to know what position France has taken with respect to those initiatives, while they apparently still find it hard to formulate their own position on the matter».\n\nEmployees of the «Company», including Valery Zakharov, were directly involved in arranging the Khartoum meeting on August 27–28, 2018, at which Central African armed groups signed a declaration of agreement.\n\nEvidence that rebel leaders support is personally coordinated by Prigozhin can be found in internal chats between employees of the «Company». For example, on May 1, 2018, Yevgeny Kopot wrote to Dmitry Sytyi: «For Nour [Noureddine Adam]: the chief [Yevgeny Prigozhin] asks him to release a communiqué saying he condemns the attack on the church. So that the UN gets the idea that Nour is for peace in CAR» (see Attachment C.77).\n\nTo attend the Khartoum meeting, «ex-Séléka» leaders Noureddine Adam and Abdoulaye Hissène violated the travel ban. According to the UN Security Council, FPRC rebels, together with Russian instructors, escorted a convoy that traveled from Am Dafok to CAR through the towns of Birao, Ouadda and Bria between October 29, 2018, and early November 2018.\n\nActivities by individuals controlled by Prigozhin are often associated with not only potential, but real threats of violating human rights. For example, in the beginning of 2019, Mahamat Nour Mamadou, a CAR citizen, accused Russian soldiers (or mercenaries) of having tortured him for five days after he had been detained by Central African Armed Forces (FACA) soldiers on suspicion of belonging to an «ex-Séléka» militia. He was taken to the town hall where the FACA and the Russians were based. According to Mamadou, Russian military personnel interrogated him about his alleged ties to a rebel group. After the interrogation, the instructors tied his hands, covered his head with a jacket, and punched him. Then they took Mamadou to their base where they hit him with chains and iron batons, and cut him in the foot with a knife, and also on the arms and the shoulder. According to Mamadou’s testimony, the instructors also cut off his finger (see Attachment B28). According to the UN, Mamadou was released on January 15 after internal security forces had intervened.\n\nThe UN mission in CAR investigated the case and produced a detailed report. UN spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci said that, based on statements and physical evidence, the UN mission could confirm that the victim had been ill-treated and tortured. The UN mission asked the CAR authorities to take relevant follow-up action in connection with the cases where CAR-stationed Russian soldiers or mercenaries tortured detainees, and shared all supporting documents. It is not known whether CAR law enforcement bodies attempted to investigate the incident with a view to hold responsible the individuals involved in that grave crime.\n\nDossier Center sources reported an incident that took place in the autumn of 2018, demonstrating the scope of influence that Russian instructors have in the CAR, where they enjoy virtually unlimited control over certain parts of the country’s territory. According to available information, a MINUSCA convoy traveling to Dekoa was stopped by armed Russian nationals. UN representatives attempted to explain that they were members of the MINUSCA mission, but the Russian «instructors» pointed their assault rifles at them and prevented them from moving on.\n\nThe following provision of the strategic agreement between representatives of the Russian Federation affiliated with Yevgeny Prigozhin and members of the CAR Government dated October 7, 2017, also causes grave concern: «The parties agree that Russia has the right to effect payments in cash, as all banks in the CAR make fund transfers through correspondent accounts in France. In the opinion of the Central African party, cash can be delivered only by private aircraft». A Dossier Center investigation has revealed instances of illegal, unrecorded, and undeclared (for taxation purposes) utilization of «Company» cash in the form of cash operations which are not registered or supported by official accounting entries, bribes, and «assistance» to armed rebel groups.\n\nOn February 16, 2018, Yevgeny Prigozhin, certain companies controlled by him (Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering), Internet Research Agency and 13 of its employees were indicted by the Grand Jury for the District of Columbia. According to the Indictment, beginning as early as 2014, Internet Research Agency financed by Prigozhin and companies he controlled, including Concord Management and Consulting and Concord Catering (collectively, «Concord») began operations to interfere with the US political system, including the 2016 US presidential election.\n\nAccording to paragraph 3 of the Indictment, Prigozhin and Concord spent significant funds to further the Agency’s operations and to pay the indicted Agency employees, along with other uncharged Agency employees, salaries and bonuses for their work at the Agency.\n\nThe defendants, posing as US persons and creating false US personas, operated social media pages and groups designed to attract US audiences. Defendants also used the stolen identities of real US persons to post on Agency-controlled social media accounts.\n\nIt should be mentioned that in May 2019 MBK Media published work plans of employees of Prigozhin’s «Company» obtained by the Dossier Center. Those documents contain the following information: «In line with the strategy of the company’s American unit, there is a plan to create a pan-African state in the territory of the states of Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Louisiana. Emergence of such state will undermine territorial integrity, military and economic potential of the USA». Key activities included «establishment of a network of training camps for black activists in the territory of Africa to provide ideological training and basic combat training», «recruitment of African Americans residing in the poorest cities of the USA who have a track record of involvement in organized crime groups and imprisonment», and «involvement of members of radical black movements in defiance events in major cities with a view to destabilize the situation within the USA».\n\nThe document describing the strategy of «Negroid race chauvinism to counter the USA» was sent in January 2018 to Mikhail Potepkin, Regional Director of Prigozhin’s company M Invest. The Dossier Center managed to identify its sender as Ceyhun Nasimi ogly Aslanov, an employee of the Internet Research Agency and one of the 13 Russian citizens who were charged with attempted interference in US elections.\n\nIt should be noted that the activities of the «Company» designed to interfere in the political systems of the US, CAR, Sudan, South Africa, Madagascar, and certain other states go beyond national law. Such activities are condemned and prohibited by a number of international legal acts; interference in the internal affairs of a state is inadmissible from international law perspective. The Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty dated December 21, 1965, says that «full observance of the principle of the non-intervention of states in the internal and external affairs of other states is essential to the fulfilment of the purposes and principles of the United Nations. Direct intervention, subversion and all forms of indirect intervention are contrary to these principles and, consequently, constitute a violation of the Charter of the United Nations» . Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention and Interference in the Internal Affairs of States dated December 9, 1981, stipulates that no state has the right to intervene or interfere in any form or for any reason whatsoever in the internal and external affairs of other states. According to the Declaration, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of states includes, inter alia, the sovereign and inalienable right of a state to determine its own political system. This means that interference in elections, as a key institution underpinning the operation of the political system, is also impermissible. The principle of non-intervention includes «the right of states and peoples to have free access to information and to develop fully, without interference, their system of information and mass media and to use their information media in order to promote their political, social, economic and cultural interests and aspirations» . Article 2-II – j stipulates «the duty of a state to abstain from any defamatory campaign, vilification or hostile propaganda for the purpose of intervening or interfering in the internal affairs of other states».\n\nTaking into consideration the evidence, as presented in this report, of illegal financing of irregular militarized units with unclear legal status and questionable legitimacy, and of money laundering, the authors of this report urge national governments and international organizations, including the United Nations Organization, to pay closer attention to potential and actual violations of fundamental principles and norms of international law and human rights caused, whether directly or indirectly, by the activities of Yevgeny Prigozhin’s «Company» outside the Russian Federation.\n\nATTACHMENT 1\n\nFACA [Forces Armées Centrafricaines] – Armed Forces of the Central African Republic, created in 1960 to protect the state borders and population of the CAR.\n\nNational Gendarmerie – part of the national army whose mission is to maintain law and order, and provide police, administrative and military support. Assures security of people and property, and controls compliance with the existing legislation.\n\nCAR Police – civil entity reporting to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.\n\nMINUSCA – United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Central Africa (French: Mission Multidimensionnelle Intégrée des Nations Unies pour La Stabilisation en Centrafrique).\n\nDue to the CAR crisis, on April 10, 2014, the UN Security Council resolved to commence the MINUSCA operation, primarily to protect non-combatants.\n\nSince its establishment, MINUSCA incorporates the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic, or BINUCA (French: Bureau Intégré de l’Organisation des Nations Unies en Centrafrique).\n\nEx-Séléka – rebel group operating in the territory of the CAR; created in 2012 as an alliance of predominantly Muslim groups based in the north of the country; shortly came to power in 2013 to be later disbanded and divided into several smaller groups, such as the Popular Front for the Rebirth of the Central African Republic headed by Noureddine Adam and Abdoulaye Hissène. Séléka is politically associated with the former President Michel Djotodia. Other ex-Séléka factions include the Central African Patriotic Movement headed by Mahamat Al Khatim, and the Patriotic Rally for the Renewal of the Central African Republic headed by Zakaria Damane.\n\nAnti-Balaka – armed CAR militia created to counter the widespread violence committed by ex-Séléka militants. Comprises predominantly Christian and animistic movements that emerged in 2013 as self-defense groups. They were joined by many military men who had deserted from the armed forces. Several coalitions have been created within Anti-Balaka since 2014 despite the lack of clear coordination between its constituent groups. The number of Anti-Balaka militants active in the CAR is estimated at 80–85 thousand. Since February 2017, several Anti-Balaka groups joined forces with restored ex-Séléka factions to fight against the Union for Peace in the Central African Republic (one of the ex-Séléka groups) in some CAR prefectures.\n\nAbdoulaye Hissène – rebel leader, head of the Popular Front for the Rebirth of the Central African Republic. In May 2017, the UN Security Council Committee included Abdoulaye Hissene in the list of designated individuals as the person «engaging in or providing support for acts that undermine the peace, stability or security of the CAR, including acts that threaten or impede the political transition process or the stabilization and reconciliation process or that fuel violence».\n\nNoureddine Adam – rebel leader, head of the Popular Front for the Rebirth of the Central African Republic. He was included into the UN Security Council list for having been «involved in planning, directing, or committing acts that violate international human rights law or international humanitarian law, as applicable», and for «providing support for armed groups or criminal networks through illegal exploitation of natural resources».\n\nSands – Prigozhin’s employees designate Syria as «the sands», Sudan as «Sudak» [zander], and the CAR as «Tsaritsyno» [Tsaritsyno Palace].\n\n«Company» – totality of foreign projects sponsored by Yevgeny Prigozhin (including projects in CAR, Sudan, Madagascar, etc.).\n\nSibut – town in the Central African Republic, 188 km from the country’s capital Bangui. One of the bases where Russian military instructors are deployed is situated in Sibut. According to the information available to the Dossier Center, in July 2018 there were eleven Russian instructors and one hundred and twenty-two FACA servicemen stationed at the base in Sibut.\n\nPlan International – international non-governmental non-commercial organization created to protect children’s rights.\n\nPMC Wagner ID badge – virtually all Russian instructors in the CAR previously took part in military hostilities in Syria and Ukraine as PMC Wagner members. Employees of the «Company» stationed in the CAR are assigned PMC Wagner ID badge numbers starting with the letter «m».\n\nInternet Research Agency, known as the «troll factory» (whose employees are also dubbed «Olghino trolls» based on the name of the locality where the «factory» is situated) was created in the middle of 2013. Originally, the Agency targeted only the Russian audience, but later its scope of operations was considerable expanded. The two key tasks of the trolls are to glorify the country’s president and his policies (including Putin’s allies in other countries), and discredit and misinform political opponents. In March 2018, the Agency was included in the US Sanctions List.\n\nDownload A1-B28 attachments translated to English\n\nAttachment A1.
