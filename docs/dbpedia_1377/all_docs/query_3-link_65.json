        "text": "The supremely handsome Russian actor Vyacheslav Tikhonov, who has died aged 81, seemed born to play Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in Sergei Bondarchuk's magnificent War and Peace (1967), in which he carried off the difficult task of gaining sympathy for Tolstoy's melancholy, sardonic, aloof aristocrat.\n\nAccording to the critic Roger Ebert: \"All of the actors look a little larger, nobler and more heroic than life â€¦ perhaps Tikhonov comes closest with his chiselled face.\" The four-part, eight-hour, 70mm, $100m epic was deservedly awarded the Oscar for best foreign language film in 1969, and Tikhonov was feted wherever it was shown.\n\nBefore War and Peace, Tikhonov had appeared in a dozen films since his debut in Sergei Gerasimov's The Young Guard (1948), which was among the better socialist realist films of the period. He played a passionate youth, one of a band of Ukrainian teenage partisans fighting the Nazi occupiers. It was one of the first of many Soviet war heroes he would be called upon to play during his career.\n\nTikhonov was born in the small manufacturing town of Pavlovsky Posad, about 40km east of Moscow. His father was a technician at a garment factory, and his mother a kindergarten teacher. After leaving school, Tikhonov became a metalworker and lathe operator, an occupation that continued during the second world war. From 1945 to 1950, he studied at the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography (VGIK), despite the fact that he failed the entrance exam. The 17-year-old was accepted at the school because so many men had left for the front and there were very few students left to play male roles. One of his teachers was Gerasimov, who gave him his first film role.\n\nThere ensued a number of stolid Stalinist movies into which Tikhonov injected some charisma. Curiously, he was prevented from making films for Mosfilm, the largest studio in Russia, because its director, the powerful and influential Ivan Pyryev, believed that Tikhonov looked more like an Azerbaijani or an Armenian than a Russian.\n\nHe had to wait for \"the thaw\" following Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the 20th congress of the Communist party in 1956, and Pyryev's departure from Mosfilm, before he was able to get more nuanced roles, notably in the five films he made with the director Stanislav Rostotsky. The best of these were We'll Live Till Monday (1968), in which he played a high-school history teacher shaken by rumours about a former student who was in love with him; and the Oscar-nominated White Bim Black Ear (1977), a touching but unsentimental tale with Tikhonov as an ill and ageing second world war veteran whose only friend is the dog of the title.\n\nTikhonov was most famous in Russia for his portrayal of Max Otto von Stirlitz (aka Colonel Maxim Isayev) in the 12-part, oft-repeated TV series 17 Moments of Spring (1973), the story of a Russian spy who worked his way up the Nazi hierarchy in Berlin during the war. For his performance, Tikhonov was presented with a medal by the KGB, and the series, beautifully shot in black and white, has since gained a cult following. Stirlitz's status as a folk hero is confirmed by the plethora of Stirlitz jokes, most of which are amusing only to Russians.\n\nSubsequently, Tikhonov, named People's Actor of the USSR, became rather typecast as the heroic spy or soldier in several Soviet films during the 1970s and 80s, the best being Bondarchuk's They Fought for Their Country (1975), based on the second world war novel by the Nobel prize-winning author Mikhail Sholokhov. In 1994 he again reached a worldwide audience in Nikita Mikhalkov's Burnt By the Sun, which won the best foreign film Oscar and the Grand Prix at Cannes. Tikhonov, then in his late 60s, played a Chekhovian grandfather, muttering: \"As Pushkin said, 'My friends are no more or are far away'.\"\n\nTikhonov was married twice, first to Nonna Mordyukova, a celebrated actor whom he met while they were both appearing in The Young Guard. Their son, Vladimir, also an actor, became a drug addict and died in 1990. Tikhonov is survived by his second wife, Tamara Ivanovna, and their daughter, Anna, an actor and producer."
