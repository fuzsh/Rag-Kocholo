Thanks are also due to the many museums, libraries, and other collections that gave permission for images to be published. We extend our sincere gratitude to Amy Farranto at the Northern Illinois University Press for helping to ensure that the volume moved as smoothly as possible to completion. We would like to acknowledge the importance of the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies (ASEEES) in the development of this volume and the field of Russian art history more generally. Since the 1970s and 1980s, annual conferences of ASEEES (formerly the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies) have served as a major venue for the growth of Russian art-historical scholarship in the West, as well as an annual reunion for a collegial and mutually supportive community of scholars. The present volume has its origins in the Association's 2009 annual conference in Boston, at which the editors, along with Jefferson Gatrall and Molly Brunson, presented a panel titled \"Interventions in the Real: New Approaches to Nineteenth-Century Russian Art\" in honor of Elizabeth Valkenier. In a happy coincidence, the panel took place on November 13-not only Valkenier's birthday, but also the anniversary of the day she mailed her manuscript for Russian Realist Art to the publisher. A festive luncheon ensued, toasts were offered, and the idea for a festschrift was first mentioned. We are grateful to the contributors, our colleagues, for creating the warm and inclusive atmosphere that permeates our field, and we look forward to many more productive meetings and collaborations arising out of ASEEES. This book uses the Library of Congress system of transliteration, but without noting hard and soft signs in the text. The only exceptions are the names of Russian rulers (Peter and Nicholas, for example, rather than Petr and Nikolai), and widely accepted renditions of famous figures such as Lev Tolstoy, Fedor Dostoevsky, and Vasily Kandinsky. The following\n\nabbreviations are used throughout: GRM for State Russian Museum, GTG for State Tretiakov Gallery, RGALI for Russian State Archive of Literature and Art, TsGALI for Central State Archive of Literature and Art of St. Petersburg, and TsGIA SPb for Central State Historical Archive of St. Petersburg.\n\nElizabeth Kridl Valkenier\n\nElizabeth Kridl Valkenier and the World of Russian Art RONALD MEYER\n\nIn his review of the \"dismal show\" of \"Russian and Soviet Painting\" mounted at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (1977-1978), Hilton Kramer, the lead art critic at the New York Times, bemoans the poor quality of the exhibits, but is even more outraged at the museum offering nothing to counterbalance the standard Soviet ideological interpretations: \"From neither the catalog nor the wall labels in the exhibition, moreover, can we expect to be told anything but the official Soviet line:' 1 Kramer recommends an antidote to the Met's ideological pandering: Fortunately, there is a new book at hand-Elizabeth Valkenier's Russian Realist Art (Ardis)-that fits the need for a serious and candid study of the political history of Russian art from the 1860s to the present. ... Her work has the great merit of providing us with a detailed account of the politics and ideology that have dominated so much of the art we see in this exhibition .... Hers is by no means the last word on the subject, but it is in many respects a useful first word, and it arrives just in time to act as a corrective to the Met's sunny embrace of this human tragedy. 2\n\nFirst, it is interesting that rather than choose some standard history, Kramer promotes a first book by a relatively unknown author, published by a fledgling independent small press in Michigan with no track record as a publisher of books on art. But what is more interesting, and which perhaps explains my first point, is that Kramer appreciates Valkenier's \"first word;' how she connects the rise and fall of Russian realist art from the \"initial creative phase ofPeredvizhnichestvo;' to its \"tendentious rehabilitation'' under Stalin. 3 And more important, how Valkenier challenges the prevailing view both in the Soviet Union and in the West, as exemplified by the Metropolitan Museum's show, through her analysis as a historian of the \"nexus between society, politics and art:' Interviews conducted in the 1970s with both the conservative and liberal camps of art historians and\n\ncurators, undertaken in tandem with archival research, laid the groundwork for Valkenier's pioneering study. Fortunately, Valkenier was not a novice researcher in the USSR-the gloom of the Cold War atmosphere did nothing to facilitate access to archives and scholars. As she writes in her essay \"The Totalitarian Model and Me;' her initial contacts and experiences in the USSR date back to a ten-day Intourist trip to Moscow in 1958, from which she brought back the impression that \"Soviet citizens were not conforming to the totalitarian model:' 4 The following year she returned to Russia as a guide for the book section of the first American Exhibit, which reinforced her impressions that ordinary citizens, unlike the monolithic mass of true believers portrayed by Cold War ideologues, had independent opinions and hungered for information about the West from which they had been cut off for half a century. When Valkenier returned to Moscow in 1967, it was in the capacity of research assistant of Philip Mosely, a foreign policy scholar-Valkenier had followed Mosely from the Council on Foreign Relations, where he held the post of director of studies, to Columbia University, where Mosely had been named director of the European Institute. 5 Her careful reading as Mosely's assistant of the literature on Soviet foreign policy in the third world led her to believe that there were \"disagreements over the old orthodoxies\" and evolving new interpretations. Her research plan was to spend a month interviewing \"Soviet specialists whose arguments [on foreign policy] represented the 'new thinking' of those days:' With Mosely's introductions she met highly placed Soviet experts with whom she maintained contact for the next thirty years, which yielded a number of articles and ultimately her second book, The Soviet Union and the Third World: An Economic Bind (Praeger, 1983 and 1985). Valkenier's work in this field pointed to the economic difficulties in the ambitious Soviet aid policies-an argument that diverged from the prevalent belief in Moscow's successes in the developing countries.\n\nQuestioning received opinion would continue to be Valkenier's modus operandi on her art history research trips to the USSR and Russia, funded by the Russian and Harriman Institutes, IREX, the Pew Foundation, and the National Council for Soviet and East European Research. It is characteristic ofValkenier's approach that she enlisted both the conservatives, many of whom held influential positions in the Soviet Academy of Arts and arts administrations, and the liberals, who were more likely to be found at universities and on museum staffs and were suggesting new approaches outside of the official framework. She found both groups eager to influence how she would frame her story. The conservatives provided her with their publications of documents, letters, and the like, which reinforced the official-highly politicized-version of history. On the other hand, the liberals prompted her to see that \"the Peredvizhniks' traveling exhibits from 18 71 on were motivated as much by a shrewd gamble to tap the market among the new middle class as by the proclaimed desire of the intelligentsia 'to serve the people;\" 6 and that many of the Peredvizhniki who left the Academy in the 1870s in protest against the stultified official ways rejoined that tsarist institution some twenty years later. Two scholars of the liberal camp, Ilia Zilbershtein, editor of the scholarly book series Literaturnoe nasledstvo (Literary Heritage), and Sofia Goldshtein, archivist at the Tretiakov Gallery, facilitated Valkenier's access to the papers of the State Committee on Art, established in 1936, \"as a political watchdog and command center for the Stalinization of the field:' Under the supervision of the Committee, Repin became the equal of Rembrandt, and nonrealist works were banished to the storage bins. Needless to say, having the Committee's minutes and protocols helped Valkenier paint a very different picture of the posthumous reception and reputation of the Peredvizhniki. An interesting footnote to Valkenier's study of the State Committee on Art's archive is that a decade later, when she was working on her book on Repin, she was denied access to this particular archive. She also discovered that her first book was not available on open shelves in the libraries. Valkenier's three decades of research on art history in the Soviet Union and Russia would bear fruit as her three books: Russian Realist Art, based on her doctoral dissertation (Columbia University, PhD 1973, History), but considerably revised and expanded to go beyond the Peredvizhniks' heyday and trace their influence into the twentieth century as a model for socialist realism;\n\nxii\n\nIlya Repin and the World of Russian Art (Columbia University Press, 1990), which is not simply a biography of the foremost Peredvizhnik but also an insightful look at the distorting lens of Soviet historiography; and finally, Valentin Serov: Portraits of Russia's Silver Age (Northwestern University Press, 2001), a study of Repin's best-known pupil set against the background of the transition from realism to Russian modernism and the interplay of art and social history during Russia's Silver Age. These lines from Valkenier's introduction to her book on Serov might be applied to her art history works as a whole: Painting prominent people of the day in business, government, society, and the arts, [Serov] provides a gallery of important figures in Russia's Silver Age .... Serov's penetrating \"reading\" of the lives and circumstances of his sitters gives us a far more varied and intricate group portrait of the epoch than is customarily presented in Russian or Western historiography. The visual thus richly extends and amplifies the usual sources, political or literary.\n\nThere is much more to be said about Elizabeth Valkenier's contributions to the study of Russian art, at the very least that she edited the catalogue of The Wanderers for the exhibition from the Soviet Union mounted at the Dallas Museum of Art in 1991, with contributions from both Russian and American scholars-surely a recognition of her status as one of the leading experts in the field. More recently, Valkenier, together with Wendy Salmond, was guest editor of a special issue of Experiment: A Journal of Russian Culture: \"Russian Realist Painting. The Peredvizhniki: An Anthology\" (2008), a compilation of documents (for example, letters, miscellaneous writings, and official papers) in English translation. This anthology has become not only an essential reference work for scholars, but also an invaluable teaching resource that enables art historians who do not specialize in Russia to include the Russian dimension in broader courses on realist art. E L I Z A B E T H K R I D L , daughter of Manfred Kridl, a well-known scholar and professor of Polish Literature at Wilno University and leading proponent of Polish integralism (the Polish variant of Russian formalism or Czech structuralism), carne to the United States in 1941 with her mother and brother, to join her father who had left Poland and was now teaching at Smith College. Kridl had left the University ofWilno, where he had been both\n\nELIZABETH KRIDL VALKENIER AND THE WORLD OF RUSSIAN ART\n\ndean of humanities and deputy pro-rector, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, when Polish personnel at the university were being relieved of their positions by the new Lithuanian Soviet government. Founder ofWilno's Social Democratic Club, Kridl opposed authoritarianism on both the left and the right. A photograph from 1936 shows the popular professor presiding over a picnic with a group of university students who included Czeslaw Milosz among their number? Milosz was not a student ofKridl's per se, but the professor was a steadfast supporter of the young poet from their early days together in Poland and during their joint emigration in the United States. Valkenier's most recent publication is \"Way Back in Wilno ... ;' a memoir of her acquaintance with Milosz. 8 Though she made a conscious choice not to specialize in Polish history, mainly to avoid intellectual parochialism, Valkenier wrote several important articles on the Sovietization of Polish history after World War II. As was the case with her work on art and Soviet foreign policy, careful research was supported by personal interviews, all of which served to draw attention to politicized falsification. Kridlleft Smith College in 1948, the same year that Elizabeth graduated from the college, for Columbia University, where he held the Adam Mickiewicz chair until his retirement in 1955. Elizabeth went to Yale University and earned her M.A. in history (1949). It was at Yale that she discovered her love for Russian history while taking a seminar with George Vernadsky. And it was at Yale that Elizabeth met her future husband Robert Valkenier. They moved to New York City, where Elizabeth pursued her study of Russian history-the seminar in medieval Russia with Michael Cherniavsky led to her choosing a topic in art history for her dissertation-and earned the Certificate of the Russian Institute in 1951. Robbie was longtime editor at the Council on Foreign Relations, and the editor of all of Elizabeth's work until his death in 2003. Their home on Morningside Drive in New York and their rural getaway in Connecticut have hosted friends and colleagues from the United States and abroad for countless dinners, where the very good food is always bettered by the exciting conversation and camaraderie. I count myself a very lucky beneficiary of the Valkeniers' generosity. The present volume not only is testament to the influence of Elizabeth Valkenier's scholarly work and professional life, but also represents a tribute from colleagues, students, and friends, some of whom go back two or three decades, while others are fairly recent. It is no exaggeration to say that her extraordinary life and gift for friendship have helped shape her remarkable studies of the world of Russian art.\n\nPublications by Elizabeth Kridl Valkenier Art History Books Russian Realist Art.

BLAKESLEY AND MARGARET SAMU\n\nI\n\nn 1916 Russian artist, archaeologist, writer, and philosopher Nikolai Roerich extended a sweeping pardon to those who, until recently, had remained ignorant of Russian art. \"We must forgive all those who not long ago denied the existence of Russian Art; for they did not know! For they, poor things, had not seen!\" 1 Much has changed since this most curious of Russian polymaths both acknowledged and excused the continuing prejudices held by many toward the art of his native country. In the twenty-first century, exhibitions of Russian art in foreign museums and galleries are rife. Sales of Russian art are among the most vibrant and lucrative in auction houses on both sides of the Atlantic. One of Roerich's contemporaries, Natalia Goncharova, has in recent years repeatedly held the record for the highest price commanded at auction by a female artist of any nationality. In academia, conferences and symposia debate Russian visual culture at length, publications abound, and two research centers have been devoted to the subject in the Englishspeaking world. 2 Yet if we take as our focus the century that immediately preceded Roerich's statement of \"forgiveness;' there is still a lingering sense of cultural marginality in discussions of Russian art. Certainly, the avant-garde has been given its due as a central force in the development of abstraction in the early twentieth century. There has been a welcome growth\n\nof scholarship on Russia's famous realist artists, the Peredvizhniki, spearheaded by this book's honoree, Elizabeth Kridl Valkenier. The Ballets Russes, too, have been widely acknowledged as a revolutionary episode in ballet, opera, and stage design, with a renewed surge of symposia, exhibitions, and publications to mark their centenary in 2009. But it is still relatively rare for Western scholarship to focus the full beam of its attention on the art of imperial Russia prior to the advent of Sergei Diaghilev and his glittering galaxy of artists, and the explosive innovations of the avant-garde. This volume of thitteen essays, conceived as a coherent entity and celebrating the scholarship of Valkenier, aims to redress the balance by presenting rigorous new research by Western and Russian scholars on Russian art of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Starting in the reign of Nicholas I (1825-1855) and covering a period of eighty years, it rethinks the narratives of seminal episodes in Russia's creative development; brings to the fore works of art and modes of artistic expression or discourse that have been sidelined or ignored in other histories; and delves into little-acknowledged aspects of well-known artistic careers. Over three decades after Valkenier's landmark monograph Russian Realist Art established a new standard in the field, our aim is to showcase the latest methodological approaches and subjects of inquiry, and expand the parameters of what has become an area of\n\nenormous intellectual and popular appeal. Interwoven throughout the chapters are such recurrent themes as the shifting contours and contiguities of institutions and communities; the role of exhibitions in focusing or exploding debate; the creation of museums and collections; hallmark connections between visual and written texts; and attention to continuities as much as splits and rifts in the Russian art world. The result is a network of case studies that provide formative new landmarks across a range of cultural territory and critical commentary. Collectively, they embrace a new era of collaboration between East and West, and profess a joint ambition to revise and revitalize the history of Russian art. AT T H E s T A R T o F the period under consideration in this book, the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg reigned supreme. Founded in 1757 during the reign of Empress Elizabeth, and fully chartered by Catherine the Great in 1764, it was the empire's only state-sponsored art school, and the only official academy of arts in the Western world to boast its own boarding school. From the early nineteenth century, boys from as young as eight would spend up to twelve years uniformed and cloistered in the Academy's vast, neoclassical building on the northern bank of the Neva River, imbibing an idealizing tradition based on the aesthetic principles of classical art, which was the lifeblood of academic practice across Europe at the time. 3 As the reign of Alexander I ( 180 1-1825) took shape, the institution could rightly claim to have met its initial promise to tackle Russia's dependency on foreign artists by training native artists, and by establishing appropriate frameworks to ensure their elevated social standing and professional success. Many commissions for major painted or sculptural projects were now given to Academy-trained artists as a matter of course. Revised statutes of 1802 insisted that the construction and decoration of public buildings be entrusted to \"artists educated in the Academy, in preference to foreigners of equal merit:' 4 And, as the institution's conference secretary boasted to his opposite number in London in 1801, foreigners had been virtually eliminated from the teaching staff: instead, the professors of painting, sculpture, and architecture were now almost exclusively Russian graduates of the Academy, \"many of whom, by the genius and talents conspicuous in their works [... ] have acquired a very high reputation; these Artists are not unknown in foreign countries, most of them having traveled into Italy and France:' 5\n\n4\n\nI ~\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBy the reign of Nicholas I, the Academy's achievements were legion. Paintings and sculptures produced under its aegis adorned the most fashionable city residences; some of its alumni were sufficiently recognized internationally to have self-portraits commissioned by the Uffizi Gallery in Florence; and buildings such as the Kazan Cathedral in St. Petersburg-designed and decorated by Academy professors, students, and alumni from 1801-stood as monolithic testaments to its success. The seed of artistic training had also been sown outside the capital city, with the emergence of Russia's first provincial art schools. When, in 1829, Nicholas I assumed direct patronage of the Academy, placing it under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Imperial Court (instead of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment, as had been the case since 1811), one could be forgiven for assuming that his intention was to appropriate a successful institution that would bring luster to his reign. But all was far from well in the Academy of Arts by this date, as the tsar's arbitrary hiring and firing of hapless professors there might suggest. While the institution produced a generation of artists of truly international caliber, including Orest Kiprenskii and Karl Briullov, those same artists complained of feeling constrained by the anxiety that Nicholas's sudden interventions and high-handed pronouncements produced. The creative imaginations of other artists were almost entirely stilled. The result was a growing disillusionment among many progressive artists and critics with the academic elite, and a sense that uncritical aping, rather than artistic innovation, pervaded the Academy's halls. From the 1830s, the first serious alternative to the Academy emerged in the form of the Moscow Art Class and, later, the Moscow School of Painting and Sculpture which, however inferior to the Academy, at least offered an alternative venue for artists to train, as Rosalind Blakesley explores in chapter 1. Some of the Academy's brightest young stars also placed distance between themselves and their alma mater by working for extended periods abroad, from where the likes of Aleksandr Ivanov inveighed against the stagnation and pusillanimity of an institution that had become part of the personal fiefdom of the tsar. Other artists quietly pursued fruitful careers elsewhere, as when Aleksei Venetsianov (a former civil servant who had trained at the Academy, but not as a fully matriculated student) adjusted his sights to the conditions of peasant life on his country estate, and set up a private art school there.\n\nWe must avoid the trap here of demonizing the Academy as the complete antithesis of artistic achievement at the time. It was far from regressive in every sphere, and continued to produce artists who played major roles in shaping Russia's cultural history, be it within the establishment or in opposition to it. Nor were the supposed innovators outside the Academy's orbit necessarily antagonistic toward it, as Venetsianov's ongoing quest for academic recognition attests: he was rewarded with the title of academician in 1812, and continued to hope for a position as professor. Recent scholarship has recognized the need to offer more nuanced appraisals of the Academy's ethos and intent, for example by reviving the careers of academic artists, and Elena Nesterova's work on the Makovskii brothers in chapter 2 of this volume advances that trend. It is nonetheless incontrovertible that the Academy lost credibility as Nicholas's reign progressed, as its critics laid charges of insular complacency and obsolescence at its door. Particularly keen was the sense shared by certain young artists and members of the intelligentsia that the Academy had become irrelevant in the modern age, and neither trained nor encouraged artists to engage with the idiosyncrasies of contemporary life. Here, as ever, the picture was more complicated than sweeping characterizations might suggest. Although it was a staunch defender of the primacy of history painting, the Academy had seen fit to include genre painting in its teaching program for many years. By the middle of the century, genre painters-and advocates of critical realism, at that-were even receiving some of the institution's highest accolades. Yet the Academy and its supposedly anachronistic practices were increasingly mocked in the popular press, as Margaret Samu illuminates in chapter 3. In her analysis of caricatures of female nudes, Samu argues that it was not the nudity that was under attack, but rather the academic artistic trope of the female nude which was, to liberal critics, lamentably disengaged with modern social concerns. Artists, too, bemoaned the growing disjuncture between reality and representation in the academic world. Famously, in 1863, fourteen students voted with their feet, and left the Academy in their final year of study when their request to select their own subject matter for the annual gold medal competition was refused. This episode, known as the Revolt of the Fourteen, was not a case of slighted students behaving rashly and unthinkingly, for they were keenly aware that their premature departure from Russia's premier art school\n\ncould halt their careers before these had even begun. Not only did they eschew the opportunity for statefunded foreign travel which success in the gold medal competition would have brought, but they alienated themselves from the Academy's labyrinthine systems of patronage, too. Clearly, the defectors needed to establish alternative frameworks of personal and professional support. Their answer was the Artel' khudozhnikov (Artists' Workshop), known as the Artel-an independent workshop in St. Petersburg where artists worked and socialized together, pooled their resources, and sought work as a collective. In 1870 this small, intimate organization was superseded by a new and entirely different group, now based in Moscow-the much larger and longer-lasting Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions (1870-1923). The Association's members, the Peredvizhniki (often translated into English as the Wanderers or the Itinerants), aspired to display their art to ever wider audiences through a series of annual itinerant art exhibitions, and to cut out the commercial middleman by establishing direct lines of communication between patron and artist. Russia's first wholly independent and financially sustainable artistic association was under way. Gradually, it attracted the foremost artistic talents of the time, some of whom prompted rich dialogue with other art forms, as Jefferson Gatrall explores in chapter 5. During the last decades of the nineteenth century, patterns of artistic patronage shifted, most notably in the well-studied proclivities of the Moscow collector Pavel Tretiakov. Tretiakov is a uniting theme in chapters 5 through 7 for his well-known support of Russian realism, but is of interest to Wendy Salmond in chapter 8 for his less celebrated engagement with icon painting, too. Related developments in patronage also occurred in the activities of patrons less studied in the West such as Ilia Ostroukhov, who features in chapters 7, 8, and 10. These and other passages in the book shed light on the cultural divide between St. Petersburg and Moscow, with the patronage of the imperial court on the one hand set against the proclivities of merchants and businessmen on the other. The movement between the two cities that takes place throughout this volume, however, reiterates the point that continuities as much as ruptures were at play. Yes, St. Petersburg, as birthplace of the Academy, was seen as the center of the artistic establishment, while Moscow, home of the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions, was equated with more progressive and democratic forces. But the essays here demonstrate that the differences between\n\nRosalind P. Blakesley and Margaret Samu\n\n5\n\nthe two cities, like those between the Academy and other artistic communities, should not be overdrawn. With the advent of the Association ofTraveling Art Exhibitions, the Academy ceased to be the epicenter of Russian artistic life. This is not to imply that clear battle lines were set between the two organizations. If Soviet scholarship was keen to emphasize the difference between the Peredvizhniki and an institution as embedded in the tsarist regime as the Imperial Academy of Arts, later accounts have taken pains to acknowledge the complexity of the relationship between the two. A recent revisionist account even takes as a prime focus \"the intricacies of the strong symbiosis of the young artists with the Academy of Arts;' pointing to the fact that members of both the Artel and the later Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions continued to exhibit in the Academy, and on occasion were the recipients of official academic titles and awards. 6 Ilia Repin, Russia's greatest realist artist and the subject of both Molly Brunson's and Galina Churak's chapters, is a prime case in point. Over the years, the Association of Traveling Art Exhibitions heralded other artistic coteries that provided alternative forums for artists to meet, work, and debate the purpose of art. For example, at Abramtsevo, the country estate of Savva Mamontov, railway magnate and irrepressible cultural impresario, artists thrilled to his insistence that they apply their talents to ambitious communal projects (the design and decoration of a church, the staging of multiple plays), and experiment in media other than those in which they had trained. As Ella Paston explores in chapter 4, Academy-educated artists such as Viktor Vasnetsov and Vasilii Polenov found themselves designing costumes and sets. Polenov's sister, Elena Polenova, revitalized local handicrafts with designs palatable to the modern, urban consumer, and Mikhail VrubelRussia's brooding symbolist par excellence-found new direction with the brilliant originality of his iridescent ceramic designs. Under Mamontov's aegis, Abramtsevo artists such as Vasnetsov and Polenova developed a strikingly experimental artistic register in book design, too, as Alla Rosenfeld explores in chapter 11. Nor did Mamontov reserve his unalloyed enthusiasm for the visual and performative arts for the projects at Abramtsevo alone. Founder of the Russian Private Opera, he also joined Princess Maria Tenisheva (doyenne of Talashkino, Russia's other great artistic colony of the time) to sponsor Mir iskusstva (World of Art, 1898-1904), the journal produced by the\n\n6\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\neponymous group of artists who, coalescing around Diaghilev, constituted the most dynamic artistic group in Russia at the turn of the century. 7 Consciously positioning themselves as an antidote to what were now seen in progressive circles to be the chauvinist attitudes and overblown moralizing of the Peredvizhniki, the Miriskussniki (as members of the Mir iskusstva group are known) favored a more cosmopolitan aesthetic than that of their realist predecessors. Aspiring to pull Russian art into the continental mainstream, they celebrated in their journal the work of artists as countercultural as Aubrey Beardsley, rather than repeating the claim of Russian exceptionalism that had become the hallmark of hagiographic literature on the realist school. Yet here, too, we must beware the appeal of simplistic narratives of polarity and opposition: as Janet Kennedy reveals in chapter 9, for all their markers of westernization and zestful proclamations of transnational intent, the Miriskussniki at times brought a nationalistic tenor to their debates. As Russia suffered a violent start to the twentieth century-enduring mutinous uprisings, terrorist attacks on politicians and other public figures, an unpopular war with Japan, and the shocking slaying of peaceful demonstrators in the heart of St. Petersburg in 1905so the art world entered a period of astonishing flux. Some artists focused their attentions in new directions, as when Valentin Serov-joyful exponent of plein-air painting and leading society portraitist who was a troubled witness to the 1905 atrocities-accompanied Lev Bakst on a journey to Greece in 1907. The result was a dramatic new engagement with the legacy of classicism in Russia, as Alison Hilton investigates in chapter 10. Some, such as Marianne Werefkin, moved abroad (in Werefkin's case to Munich), and there developed a new artistic voice. Still others began the inexorable transition from figurative painting toward more abstract modes of expression, be it through Kazimir Malevich's avowedly self-conscious system of suprematism, or the fragmentation of cuba-futurism. The myriad factors that lie behind these and other shifts negotiated by the avant -garde are beyond the scope of this volume. But in chapter 12, Marian Burleigh-Motley offers a robust new interpretation of one of these developments, positing a Theosophical explanation to the cultural equipage of Vasily Kandinsky's seminal painting, Sketch for \"Composition No. II\" of 1909-1910. The efflorescence that occurred in the visual arts in Russia as we reach the end of the eighty years covered by this book has been explored in depth elsewhere. The\n\nthirteen essays here expose and illuminate developments of extraordinary richness and complexity before the internationally recognized triumphs of the avant -garde. With rigorous new research, innovative interpretation, and a novel focus at times, they collectively refute any charge of provincialism or marginalization that may still hover over the field of Russian art. I N P R E S E NT I N G T H I S new scholarship on Russian art of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, we must attend to some of the major trends in its analysis and interpretation over the last forty-odd years. Elizabeth Valkenier has already commented on the historiography of the period up to the 1970s, and it is not our intention to rehearse that material here: it will suffice to point the reader to her thoughtful and stimulating analysis oflate imperial and Soviet scholarship in the historiographic survey that concludes her 1977 book, Russian Realist Art. 8 During the closing decades of the Soviet Union and with the advent of glasnost, the picture changed dramatically, as our coverage here of certain advances and new lines of inquiry suggests. For the sake of clarity and succinctness, we will focus our study on the English- and Russianlanguage historiography of the nineteenth century to the Silver Age, and largely exclude from our observations the extensive literature on icon painting and other earlier considerations, or on the avant-garde and the many artistic developments of the Soviet period and beyond. The last two decades of the Soviet era saw a number of gratifying developments in art-historical scholarship, in both Russia and the Anglo-American world. In the West many of these developments can be traced back to Cold War efforts to create cultural connections with the Soviet Union on an officiallevel. 9 Even as political tensions remained, these programs allowed Western scholars the opportunity to study Russian art, and created a vital exchange of ideas between Russian and Western art historians. Cold War anxieties in the political sphere also led governments in Britain and the United States of America (as well as in other western states) to support the study of Russian language, literature, and culture for students in secondary schools and universities as well as the military. Such programs not only encouraged future social scientists and policy specialists, but also contributed toward the development of a generation of British and American art historians working on Russian art. In the 1970s state and private support for cultural exchange created new opportunities for art research and\n\nexhibitions. 10 These exhibitions played a crucial role in making Russian art accessible to Western scholars and engendering broader public awareness of and interest in the subject. At the same time, opportunities increased for Anglo-American scholars to work in Russia supported by IREX, Fulbright, and other grants, even if the Western directors of such programs had to caution scholars against selecting subjects that were unlikely to get approval from the Soviet side. Russia exerted a distinct appeal for its distant, exotic allure; but there was also growing recognition that this was a large and complex field little known outside of Russia, and that research in the area could contribute something really new to art history and cultural studies. In particular, specialists in Russian literature such as John Bowlt began to work on the early twentieth -century literary and artistic circles that gave impetus to and, later, sustained the avant-garde. Their endeavors in publishing documents and theoretical material in English raised the level of scholarship in the field, and generated tremendous interest in the Russian avant-garde among both popular and scholarly audiences-an interest that gradually spread to earlier periods of Russian art. 11 Notable from the start was the overwhelming support that Western art historians have received from scholarly mentors in Russia, as every nonRussian contributor to this volume would attest. While it might seem invidious to single out individuals from among the many Russian art historians who welcomed their Western counterparts and facilitated their work, the likes of Eleonora Gomberg-Verzhbinskaia, Grigorii Sternin, Dmitrii Sarabianov, Lidiia Iovleva, and three generations of curators in the Tretiakov Gallery, the Russian Museum, the Hermitage, and other museums have been extraordinary in their willingness to accept foreign scholars into their close-knit communities, and in their generous support of new work. As Western art historians awoke to the study of Russian art, so they had to take on board key differences in the practice of the discipline in Russia and the West. Striking in the first instance was that Western scholars who specialize in Russian art typically come to it from other disciplines, such as Russian language and literature studies, or from university training in European and/or American art. The art historians, in particular, bring to their inquiries a familiarity with the current work and theoretical approaches in the study of Western art. Students in various Western universities can now develop a scholarly interest in Russian art from as early as their undergraduate years, and many vibrant\n\nRosalind P. Blakesley and Margaret Samu\n\n7\n\ngraduate programs embrace the study of Russian art, attesting to the current health of the field. In Russia, by contrast, European and Russian art have traditionally been treated in academia and museum circles as two distinct fields. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russian and European art are housed in separate museums (this separation of native and nonnative art being a major factor in the misapprehension in the West of the State Hermitage Museum as Russia's national gallery, when it is in fact the country's premier collection of non-Russian art). Similarly, the study and teaching of art at the university level is usually separated into two distinct categories or tracks. At times, Russian art historians have even been surprised to learn that Western colleagues study Russian art as part of their broader studies of European artistic production, rather than seeing these two specialties as mutually exclusive. For this reason, the study of Russian art in Russia has often developed in ways that are isolated from contemporary Western methods and approaches, many of which incorporate theoretical or methodological ideas from the study of literature and the social sciences. Western scholars (along with courageous, independent thinkers in Russia) have also become aware of the need to navigate their way carefully between fact and ideology as they engage with the available literature on Russian art. As Valkenier points out in Russian Realist Art, revisionist scholarship on Russian art was already starting to appear in the Soviet Union in the late 1960s; but its impact paled in comparison to that of the many publications repeating earlier, dogmatic viewpoints of the Stalinist period. 12 On the whole, Soviet-era scholarship was exemplary in its thoroughness, and many of the monographs produced in the mid-twentieth century, particularly on the life and work of major artists, continue to serve as standard references on their subject: one might mention Aleksei Fedorov-Davydov's Vasilii Perov, Igor Grabar's two-volume Repin, and Esfir Atsarkina's Karl Pavlovich Briullov, to name only a few. 13 These works are based on extensive use of primary sources, which include both archival material and publications from the artists' lifetime. As useful as Soviet-era publications may be for factual content, however, many of them veer into ideological territory when discussing artistic motivations and cultural context. So it is that Western art historians working on Russian art find themselves the beneficiaries of an immense wealth of data and sources presented in Soviet publications, but need to develop specific skills of\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nanalysis and interpretation in order to recognize whether this literature was delivering straightforward facts that could stand up to some form of objective validation, or whether it was aligning the primary sources that were cited to suit the dominant ideological current of the time. Going back to archival documents and original period publications-rather than relying on Soviet-era sources-remains essential to moving beyond outmoded ideological interpretations, and is a dominant feature of the research presented in this volume. As the constraints of Soviet rule began to loosen under perestroika, art-historical scholarship in Russia evolved accordingly, branching out from its prioritization of a nationalistic view of realist trends to address new subject matter, and to place Russian art in a broader European context. 14 These approaches greatly expanded the parameters of the discipline in terms of both subject matter and methodology, even if, in the Soviet Union, studying the avant-garde was still off-limits until the late 1980s. In the mid -1980s, a small number of nineteenth-century specialists in the Soviet Union bravely undertook publications on major artists such as Petr Basin and Fedor Bruni who had been defenders of academic conservatism. 15 Such research prefigured the more recent attempts, mentioned above, to view the Academy in general in a more objective light. Bruni served as rector of the Academy from 1855 to 1871 and was typically portrayed in the mid-twentieth-century literature as the figurehead of institutional opposition to realism because of his lively debates in the press with radical critics such as Vladimir Stasov. Alia Vereshchagina, however, challenged this picture of Bruni as the state-backed nemesis of democratic realism by offering a more measured analysis of his theoretical statements and artistic career. While excavating the significance of nonrealist artists may have been a risky career move for Vereshchagina and like-minded authors, it indicates that ideas beyond the standard narrative of realism triumphant were starting to be heard as the Soviet Union faltered toward its demise. The collapse of the Soviet Union coincided with some evermore ambitious exhibitions of Russian art in the West, which both reflected and initiated new avenues of inquiry. 16 Work on Russian nineteenthcentury art has also been buoyed by its growing popularity on the art market over the last quarter century. At auction houses, sales dedicated to Russian painting and decorative arts since the mid -1990s have been realizing ever-increasing prices, thanks in\n\nlarge part to the fortunes of Russian businesses and individual entrepreneurs, and this commercial interest has fueled new research. Since 2003 Elena Nesterova and Tatiana Karp ova have led the way in producing monographs and exhibitions devoted to academic art, and to artists of the sort that had been considered antithetical to the progress of realism during the Soviet period. 17 Their efforts have helped to show the close relationships between many realist and academic artists, who were often presented in Soviet scholarship as belonging to opposing camps. Their work also presents greater congruity between the Russian and Western artistic traditions than had been acknowledged or discussed in earlier generations. Perhaps the single most important development in art history in Russia in recent decades, however, has been official recognition of the importance of the avant-garde, which has led to an explosion of publications on the subject. When avant-garde art began to be exhibited in the waning years of the Soviet Union, it created a sensation andin an ironic twist, considering the emphasis of Soviet scholarship-threatened to overshadow work on nineteenth-century art. Realism, in particular, fell from favor due to the perception created during the Soviet era that it had been a movement solely motivated by social concerns. Thankfully, this overbalance in favor of the avant-garde has been corrected in recent years, not least in a series of excellent exhibitions and catalogues produced by the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg and the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow. Some of these initiatives suggest that it is no longer appropriate to conceptualize native and Western historians of Russian art as two distinct camps, for perhaps the most meaningful development of recent years has been growing international collaboration. Large exhibitions of Russian art with a strong nineteenth-century component have been sent to prestigious venues in the West, including the National Gallery, London, in 2004; the Musee d'Orsay, Paris, in 2005; and the Guggenheim Museums in New York and Bilbao in 2005-2006. 18 In 2001 curators at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands initiated an ongoing series of exhibitions of Russian painting-five to date-with catalogues available in English. 19 In addition, the Peredvizhniki were the focus of a major exhibition that traveled from Stockholm, Sweden, to Chemnitz, Germany, in 2011-2012, with a catalogue in English as well as Swedish. 20 In a telling throwback to earlier separations, though, the magnificent displays in both the exhibition From Russia! at the Royal\n\nAcademy, London, in 2008, and the Guggenheim exhibitions-which included work by Cezanne, Picasso, and Matisse, as well as the greatest Russian artists of their generation-continued to be divided according to nationality, with Russian and Western works exhibited in different halls.Z 1 The result was a lost opportunity to view side by side Western European and Russian paintings that are normally housed in different museums, and to consider the aesthetic and intellectual dialogue that took place between them. Similarly, organizers of the recent Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition Rooms with a View, which examined mid-nineteenth-century interior and genre paintings, planned to include Russian paintings alongside works by Central and Western European artists. Sadly, as loan requests could not be fulfilled, the unprecedented opportunity to compare the works in context occurs only in the exhibition catalogue. 22 Clearly, there is still work to be done before Russian art is celebrated as an integral part of the European mainstream, rather than being approached in the West as an interesting \"other\" to canonical developments elsewhere. I N L I G H T 0 F T H E T R E N D S and developments outlined above, what are the salient strengths and leitmotifs of this book? All of the chapters use Valkenier's lead as a springboard for new research and largely follow a chronological format, with specific groupings within this structure lending weight to particular connections or interrelated themes. In the first place, there is a recurring interest in artistic communities, paying attention both to official institutions and to various progressive groups that developed separately, Abramtsevo and Mir iskusstva foremost among them. Keen consideration is also given to the relationship between visual imagery and written texts, particularly in essays on aspects of realism by three new scholars in the field; in an illuminating exploration of national identity in illustrated children's books; and in a reading of Kandinsky's work in light of Theosophical ideas. There are stimulating new accounts of individual painters who left an indelible mark on the artistic culture oflate imperial Russia, as well as thoughtful exploration of issues of patronage and display. Chapter 1 offers a new assessment of the Moscow School of Painting and Sculpture, a crucible of artistic innovation in nineteenth-century Russia, which nonetheless remains understudied in Western literature. By examining the school's origins and history afresh, the account repositions both the Moscow School and\n\nRosalind P. Blakesley and Margaret Samu\n\nI\n\n9\n\nthe Imperial Academy of Arts, which, as the premier art schools in imperial Russia, provide context for many of the subjects covered in the book. Chapter 2 then turns to a pair of artists who began their artistic careers in the Moscow institution-the brothers Konstantin and Vladimir Makovskii, whose father, Egor, had been instrumental in setting up the school. The work of these prolific painters is compared to shed light on why these two artists-immensely popular in their time and at auction today, but unevenly treated in scholarshipfollowed divergent professional paths, and chose such different visual languages to express their ideas. Chapter 3 attends to the relationship between Russian caricature and the depiction of nude female subjects in the 1860s, focusing on the various iterations of and reactions to Timofei Neff's popular painting Bather of 1858. Drawing on a wide range of primary sources, it shows how the reception of Salon-style nudes in the 1860s shaped perceptions of nineteenthcentury art production well into the Soviet era. Chapter 4, in contrast, takes as its subject the organizational structure and aesthetic direction of the artists' colony that developed at Abramtsevo, outside Moscow, from the 1870s. The chapter contends that the principles that underpinned activities there gave the circle a unique identity as a specifically Russian type of artistic association, and inspired the various forms of creative endeavor in which the Abramtsevo artists engaged. The next four chapters shift attention to some of Russia's realist artists and their foremost patron, Pavel Tretiakov. Chapter 5 probes various interconnections between realist literature and painting, focusing on the relationship between Lev Tolstoy's writing and the visual arts. By considering Tolstoy's varying responses to two very different renderings of Christ before Pilate-a fictional painting from Anna Karenina, and Nikolai Ge's actual painting What Is Truth?-the chapter addresses the power relations at play between novelists and painters in Russia at the time. Chapter 6 then explores what it meant for Russian realism, an aesthetic that privileged contemporaneity and authenticity, to venture into the representation of history, taking as a case study the complex construction and fraught history of Ilia Repin's renowned history painting, Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan. 16 November 1581 (1885). Discussion of Rep in continues in chapter 7, which gives a detailed account of his groundbreaking solo exhibition of 1891, and uses this as a prism through which to assess the artist's career. Repin features here as\n\n10\n\nIN T R0 D UCT I0 N\n\na figure of transition as much as a node of contention between different generations, picking up on the theme of continuity versus divisiveness that resurfaces throughout the volume. Chapter 8 then focuses on Pavel Tretiakov, arguably the most important individual patron in nineteenth-century Russia, and a seminal figure in any discussion of the perception and reception of Russian art. Significantly, Tretiakov is considered here not in relation to his well-studied collection of realist paintings, but instead as a connoisseur and collector of icons. Two of the giants of the Russian nineteenth-century art world-Repin and Tretiakovare thus given due prominence in this volume, but via an entirely new approach to their work. The final five chapters take the discussion forward to consider the artistic culture of late imperial Russia, with forays into both the Silver Age and the avantgarde. Chapter 9 calls into question the supposed cosmopolitanism of the Mir iskusstva circle, arguing that its artists drew on alternative models of nationality to those explored by Russia's realist artists, and at times evoked nationalistic sentiments as cliched as those that the realists inspired. Like chapters 7 and 8, it too takes the discourses generated by an exhibition or museum display as a focal point. Chapter 10 offers a brilliant new account of the complex classical revivalism of Valentin Serov and Lev Bakst, the latter a stalwart of the Mir iskusstva community and the Ballets Russes. Chapter 11 surveys the expression of national identity in illustrated children's books across the long nineteenth century, with a particular focus on the productions of the Silver Age. The complexity of text-image relations in Russian children's book illustration renders this a subject of great significance, but one that has, surprisingly, never been given such scholarly attention or chronological range. Finally, chapters 12 and 13 offer striking new perspectives on the work of Marianne Werefkin and Vasily Kandinsky, and exemplify the interplay between written and visual texts that underpins so many accounts of Russian art. Both Kandinsky and Werefkin embraced a spiritual rather than a realist outlook. Yet they equally admired children's drawings, folk art, and the powerfully expressive potential of decorative forms. Both were also Russians living in Munich, and in this respect they close one narrative-that of Russian artists primarily working and appreciated in Russia-and open up the debate to encompass the dialogue between Russian painters of the twentieth century and developments abroad. The thirteen essays include a range of approaches, from close textual readings to institutional critique. They\n\nalso develop major themes inspired by Valkenier's workamong them, the emergence and evolution of cultural institutions; the development of aesthetic discourse and artistic terminology; debates between the Academy of Arts and its challengers; art criticism and the periodical press in Russia; and the resonance of various forms of nationalism and Slavic identity within the art world. These and other questions engage multiple disciplinesart history, Slavic studies, and cultural history among them-and promise to fuel a vibrant and developing field.\n\nNotes 1.

BLAKESLEY\n\nW\n\nhen, in 1842, Nicholas I was presented with a proposal to establish \"a Moscow Academy of Arts;' the tsar memorably declared that his empire had no need of two art academies. 1 Apocryphal as Nicholas's comment may be, it drives home the centralization of artistic education in Russia at the time: for the tsar and the Imperial Academy of Arts alike, any other art school would only ever be part of the Gradus ad Parnassum, which led the truly talented of Russia's artists to study within academic walls. Within a year, however, the Ministry of the Imperial Court had agreed to open the Moscow School of Painting and Sculpture, inaugurating a vital new stage in Russia's cultural life. The early champions of the Moscow School did not abjure the Academy, or bridle at its limitations. Impelled by the absence of any formal artistic training in Moscow, their desire was simply to provide artists with the means to develop and refine their skills, and they recruited graduates of the Academy and followed the academic system of teaching to achieve this aim. Yet from its inception, the Moscow School was seen by some commentators to foster national and patriotic standing that ran counter to the cosmopolitanism of the Academy, as Elena Nesterova discusses in chapter 2. Bolstered by the cultural awakening of Moscow more generally, the Moscow School certainly contested the academic republic, not least by fostering different genres of painting. Yet the shifting and often ambiguous\n\ndynamic between the two premier art schools of imperial Russia was not linear, nor were some of the more singular aspects of the Moscow School necessarily at loggerheads with academic thinking. With a sharper picture of the underlying continuities as well as the differences between the two organizations, this chapter positions the Moscow School as at once an extension to normative academic pedagogy, and a dramatic new forum in which a range of shifting cultural allegiances, memories, and expressions could be brought to bear on the shape of a Russian national school. T H E M o s c o w S c H o o L stemmed from the initiative of a small group of amateur and professional artists who shared the desire to practice life drawing (these included Egor Makovskii, father of the artists explored in chapter 2). As there was no such provision outside St. Petersburg, in 1832 they began informal evening sessions in a private apartment at a cost to each participant of 15 rubles a month. Initially, these meetings had no formal agenda or teaching provision, but paying members were entitled to bring a guest for free, and these nonpaying attendees tended to be art students seeking professional feedback on their work. The Moscow classes thus evolved from a discursive studio space into a teaching forum which, at a time when Nicholas was tightening his grip on artistic education, offered an environment relatively free from\n\nthe constraints of state dictates, and one in which artists were able to develop their practical skills. The group held its inaugural exhibition (and, probably, Moscow's first public art exhibition) in two rented rooms in 1833. Attendance was poor, but a cultured viewing public barely existed in Moscow at the time. As Aleksei Dobrovolskii, a portraitist, Academy alumnus, and champion of the Moscow art classes was to note wryly the following year, the visual arts in the ancient capital consisted of little more than a handful of galleries and a smattering of decent paintings and sculptures, all of which were in private hands? Determined to combat this inertia, Dobrovolskii and his colleagues agitated for a new philanthropic enterprise-what would become known as the Moscow Art Society-to raise public engagement with the visual arts by such means as art classes for men, women, and children; general lectures on \"the history and theory of the fine arts\"; and an art gallery, library, and print collection \"for general use:' 3 Their laudable intentions were largely unrealized due to a lack of funds. But the Moscow Art Society did attract a group of wealthy aristocrat and merchant subscribers to the life classes, which from 1833 acquired the official sanction of the military governor-general of Moscow, Dmitrii Golitsyn, and became known as the Moscow Art Class. The enterprise boasted sixty-five committed participants within the year, and became a fulcrum of the campaign to develop the city's artistic life. The Art Class, held initially in private houses, was plagued with financial instability in its early years, and faced closure at one stage. Yet it nurtured high ambitions, and in 1833 submitted a proposal to the Academy to establish a permanent institution that would provide a program oflessons in copying, drawing from the antique, life drawing, painting, and sculpture over a period of four years. This echoed the standard academic divisions, and the Academy gave the venture its cautious support. Similar supplications followed from Golitsyn and Ivan Seniavin, the civil governor-general of Moscow, until, in 1843, the Ministry of the Imperial Court agreed to formalize the Moscow Art Class as a new art school, to be governed by the Council of the Moscow Art Society. The local journal Moskvitianin (The Muscovite) was delighted: bemoaning the fact that \"Moscow has an intellectual and a literary life [... ] but it still has little by way of an artistic life;' it saw the foundation of an art school as a major step toward filling this void. 4 The Moscow School of Painting and Sculpture duly opened the following\n\n14\n\nyear in the Iushkov House, an impressive building at 21 Miasnitskaia Street that had hosted the Art Class for the previous two years. Acquired by the Moscow Art Society in 1844, the Iushkov House has been home to art schools of various persuasions ever since. 5 As the Art Class morphed from amateur initiative to professional institution, so it was shepherded into the official fold. Like the Academy, the Moscow School was placed under the aegis of the Ministry of the Imperial Court, which authorized the statutes, approved the choice of professors, and agreed on an annual subsidy of 5,000 rubles. 6 The military governor-general of Moscow was ex officio head of the governing Council, which ensured official supervision. The Academy, too, exerted its hold, as students in Moscow were able to graduate only with the title of unclassed artist (also known as free artist), the Academy having been given in 1832 the exclusive right to bestow the higher medals and awards. As the minister of the imperial court made clear: \"I consider it impossible to give the School the right to award its students medals and the title of artist, for this right, which defines the very position of the recipient, must be given exclusively by the Council of the Academy of Arts, composed as it is of a more significant number of specialists in every branch of art:' 7 The Moscow School's more successful recruits therefore had to send works to the Academy or even transfer there to compete for their profession's major qualifications and prizes. A move for greater autonomy during the drafting of new statutes in 1859 was rejected, and the Moscow School remained dependent on academic distinctions until1865. 8 That year, it merged with the architectural school attached to the Moscow Court Office to become the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, and won the right to grant major and minor silver medals and the titles of classed artist, unclassed artist, and drawing teacher. Even then, the major gold medal and honorific titles were still granted by the Academy alone. 9 Such facts have led several historians to portray the relationship between the Moscow School and the Academy as one of growing hostility and estrangement, enforcing those narratives of the Soviet era in which opposition to the Academy served as shorthand for an anti-tsarist, proto-revolutionary stance. 10 But it is mistaken to infer a temporally progressive breakdown between the two institutions in this way. Certainly, the Moscow School, if no brainchild of the Academy, was fashioned in its image in the 1840s. And certainly, by the 1860s, it was anxious to exert its authority by\n\nA C A D E M I C F 0 0 T S0 L D I E R 0 R N AT I 0 N A L I ST WA R H 0 RSE ?\n\ncutting loose from the Academy's apron strings, and grant the full range of titles and awards. Yet relations between the School and the Academy were far more subtle and entwined than such a polarized chronology might suggest. To start with pedagogic practice, the teaching system in Moscow followed the standard academic program, with students drawing or modeling from originals or copies of works of art, examples of which were provided by the Academy. They would then progress, via the life class, to painting and sculptural compositions of their own. There were supplemental classes in perspective, anatomy, and landscape painting and, following abortive attempts in the late 1840s to introduce a more general education (an initiative quashed by the Ministry of the Imperial Court), the curriculum expanded in 1857 to include subjects such as Russian Orthodoxy, history, and the theory of color. 11 Exhibitions lasting from a fortnight to a month were held triennially for a decade from 1839, and then more regularly. Entrance to the exhibitions was free, and they gradually attracted so appreciative a public that every exhibit at the sixth exhibition, in 1851, was soldY From 1845, each exhibition was also accompanied by a raffle of faculty and student work. In the absence of public or commercial galleries in Moscow, and at a time when many patrons still preferred foreign art, the exhibitions, like those at the Academy, played a crucial role in raising the profile of contemporary Russian painting and sculpture; in promoting debate about the visual arts across a broad social spectrum; and in creating a market for student work. For all this recourse to the academic template, however, there were subtle differences of opinion and policy at the Moscow School from the start. The backers of the initial life drawing classes included men ofliberal views such as Mikhail Orlov, who had been associated with the Decembrists in 1825. It is important not to overstate the democratic credentials of the Decembrists, who remained psychologically and intellectually entangled with the concept of enlightened despotism. 13 Nonetheless, those linked to their circle acquired an eclat in liberal circles for their apparent antagonism to autocratic rule. Not closely involved in the uprising, Orlov was still exiled to the country and allowed to return to Moscow only in 1831. There he remained under official surveillance (\"like a lion in a cage;' in Aleksandr Herzen's words), but found a welcome outlet for his energies in the art classes, which he funded personally in times of financial crisis. 14 The prehistory\n\nof the Moscow School was thus entwined with that of a man whose public image was one of quiet opposition to the tsarist regime. It is difficult to pinpoint the legacy of Orlov and those of similar political persuasion in the genesis of the Moscow School. Clearly significant, however, is that Orlov advocated a socially inclusive art education, writing in 1835 of the need \"to extend the teaching [of art] to all sectors of society;' including women, and \"to invite the talented throughout the city to take part:' \"The artistic education of society is a matter of governmental concern, and one of the most important ways to achieve genuine and meaningful enlightenment;' he opined. 15 Such ambitions were realized in the Moscow Art Class, whose students were praised in a report to the tsar of 1839 for their \"exemplary behavior [... ] even though the majority of them belong to the lowest social estate:' 16 The Moscow School, too, professed a wide social embrace, and moved to accept serfs unconditionally from the start. The Ministry of the Imperial Court vetoed this plan, and changed the draft statutes so that serfs could only be admitted if their owners pledged to free them should they graduate with a silver medal or higher, thereby imposing similar stipulations to those at the Academy. Nonetheless, many serfs passed through the Moscow School, circumventing official policy just as they did at the Academy at times. The school charged fees-initially five rubles a month-that would often have been beyond a serf's reach. But members of the Moscow Art Society were each allowed to nominate two pupils to study at the institution free of charge, and possibly as much as 20 percent of the school's students, a number of them serfs, were sponsored in this way. 17 While demographic details over a broad period are scant, statistics for 1856 confirm this picture of relative social diversity. That year, classes were attended by 14 students from military or civil-service backgrounds; 52 whose fathers were of senior officer rank; 8 from clerical backgrounds, and the same from Moscow's foundling hospital; 43 from merchant families; 9 foreigners, including three from Finland (then part of the Russian Empire); 195 from the petty bourgeoisie; 15 state peasants; and 60 students who were or had been serfs. 18 Vasilii Perov, a star pupil in the 1850s and the school's most influential teacher in the 1870s, recalled students from as far afield as Siberia, the Crimea, Astrakhan, Poland, Constantinople, and even the remote Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea. \"Goodness me;' he wrote, \"what a varied and multifaceted crowd gathered in the school:' 19 The school's public, too, seems to have reflected a broad social base: in 1853, winners in the annual lottery\n\nRosalind P. Blakesley\n\nI\n\n15\n\nincluded 8 noblemen, 25 merchants, 24 artisans or petty bourgeoisie, 10 peasants, and 2 house-serfs.2Â° To comment on such diversity is not to set the Moscow School up as the demographic antithesis of the Academy. Pupils and teachers from varied backgrounds were part of the warp and woof of the Academy, and the heterogeneity of its student body in the mid-nineteenth century was memorably captured by the artist Ilia Repin, who matriculated in 1864. Sitting side by side, rubbing shoulders, were a disheveled lad in a peasant shirt and a grey-haired general in his uniform; next came a bearded man in a tail coat (a stunning artist with a goatee); then a university student, and a tall naval officer with a thick beard. On the next step up there was a whole pack of blond chaps from the Viatka region; a corpulent lady-a rare sight in the Academy at the time; some big-eyed Georgians and Armenians; a Cossack officer; and some prim Germans all spick and span, with their upright collars and their hair curled aIa Capoul. T H E Y w E R E , Repin concluded, \"youngsters of various classes and ages from every corner of Russia. There were half-educated lower-class townsfolk [meshchane], thoroughly ignorant peasants, and university graduates, but they were all led by their own calling and brought their own ideas:' 21 Clearly, then, neither the Academy nor the Moscow School was elitist in its admissions policy, nor was either school socially, geographically, and culturally stratified. Nonetheless, if both institutions admitted students across the social range, a far greater percentage of the student body at the Moscow School came from the lower classes, and the school was repeatedly perceived as more liberal, even in those instances when the Academy did not, in fact, lag very far behind. Telling in this respect is the case ofVasilii Tropinin, the famed serf artist who studied at the Academy from 1799 to 1804 and won various medals there. Tropinin's master refused to grant him his freedom, whereupon he pursued his artistic interests in the minimal free time that he had from his duties in the kitchens and gardens of his master's Ukrainian estate. Finally manumitted in 1823, he established a reputation for portraits in which the subjects engaged in some everyday activity, removing his sitters from the particularities of their identity, and blurring the boundary between portraiture and genre painting. Well acquainted with many of the founders of the Moscow School, Tropinin enjoyed\n\n16\n\ngreat favor there: not only was he elected an honorary member of the Moscow Art Society at the school's official opening in 1843, but his paintings were used as examples for students to copy, and he regularly visited to advise them on their work. This involvement has been construed time and again as evidence of the Moscow School's broad outlook, underscoring the common equation between progressiveness and an antiacademic stance. Yet Tropinin had been recognized by the Academy for years, having been elected an academician of portrait painting nearly two decades previously, and offered an academic teaching post. In 1836 Aleksei Dobrovolskii, his brother Vasilii, and Ivan Durnov had also been appointed academicians specifically for their efforts in founding the Moscow Art Class. It is important, therefore, not to see the Academy and the Moscow School as antithetical constructions, but as components of the emerging cultural state that diverged on certain issues, yet maintained much common ground. A list of honorary members elected to the Moscow Art Society in 1844 is sufficient to forestall any characterization of the Society or its adjunct, the Moscow School, as organs of antiacademic sentiment or radical zeal: alongside the Academy stalwarts Vasilii Shebuev, Fedor Bruni, Aleksei Egorov, and Karl Briullov stood such members of the imperial and political elite as Maximilian, duke of Leuchtenberg and president of the Academy; Prince Petr Volkonskii, minister of the imperial court; Count Uvarov, minister of public enlightenment and architect of\"Official Nationality\"; and Count Lev Perovskii, minister of internal affairs. 22 One area in which the Moscow School consciously set itself apart, however, concerned the nature of Moscow as a social and cultural sphere in which the scope of patriotism in the arts could be redefined. By the 1830s, the city was enjoying something of a cultural renaissance. Its literary and musical salons were attracting writers and musicians of the caliber of Pushkin and Glinka; following the short-lived but memorable opening of the Golitsyn collection to the public in 1810, campaigns were afoot to establish a permanent public art gallery in the city, including Zinaida Volkonskaia's detailed proposal of 1831; and journals such as Moskvitianin were giving voice to some of the pressing cultural debates of the day. 23 By the end of the decade, the city was also witness to one of the most ambitious acts of patriotic commemoration in the shape of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, the massive monument in honor of the victory over Napoleon which was under construction from 1839 to 1860, and decorated for a further twenty years.

Symptomatic of this reorientation is the painter Aleksandr Ivanov's letter to his father from Italy in 1835, in which he wrote of his desire to settle in Moscow, as much to develop themes from Russian history as to \"escape the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts:'24 Slavophiles, too, began to position Moscow as the fulcrum around which Russia's national cultural development should rotate. In short, Moscow became a cipher for a form ofRussianness that stood in opposition to the supposedly corrupt and superficial values of St. Petersburg, Russia's modern \"window on the West\" whose history could be traced back for little more than 130 years. Such intellectual currents found resonance in the Moscow School, which was promoted from the start as a forum in which Moscow's distinctiveness in Russia's cultural development could take center stage. Seniavin, the school's first director, made great play with such ideas in his keynote address at the official opening, as Moskvitianin was only too happy to report. For Seniavin, the earlier art classes had proved that one simply needed \"to nurture the talents of the Russian people in order for art to sprout a deep, national root in our ancient capital:' Getting into his stride, he went on to declaim: Every enlightened nation in the world takes pleasure in enjoying works of art which express their national spirit and character. Russia likewise takes pride in those names of Russian artists who are acclaimed in the West. There have been a few excellent efforts to give our art some sort of national feeling. But an ever greater role in this can undoubtedly be played by Moscow, where the physiognomy of the people, the monuments of antiquity, and historical memories all lead the fine arts toward new discoveries. Having adopted the best of Western artistic education via the northern capital, Moscow can now focus on giving it a national character.2 5\n\nThis was fighting talk, giving Moscow and its new art school ideological freight as the true cradle of national expression which cut against the cosmopolitanism of the Academy. The ancient capital was thus theorized as a vital corrective that could draw artists away from Western models, and expose them instead to the architectural monuments, ethnographic notation, and\n\ncultural memories that would enable them to develop a distinctly Russian voice. Seniavin did not deny the need for outside assistance in achieving this goal, just as the Academy had called on foreign expertise nearly a century before: the best of both Russian and foreign artists were to be invited \"to settle in Moscow, observe the beauty of Russian nature and of the Russian man, paint and sculpt him and educate those Russian talents which of course exist, but are still hidden and in need of development:' Nonetheless, as Richard Stites has noted, Seniavin's declamation \"amounted to a manifesto exalting Moscow over St. Petersburg and Russian over cosmopolitan and academic arf' 26 Seniavin's rhetoric resounds with the topoi of Slavophilism, and many Official Nationalists and Slavophiles gave the school their support. Seniavin's speech was written by Stepan Shevyrev who, along with fellow Slavophile Aleksei Khomiakov, served on the Council of the Moscow Art Society, helped to organize the school's exhibitions, and facilitated access to paintings in private collections for students to copy. Shevyrev's colleague, the prominent journalist Mikhail Pogodin, was an equally important advocate for the school, donating books to its library and, as editor of Moskvitianin, devoting many column inches to its activities. These were men immersed in the quest to nurture Russia's intellectual and cultural life. Pogodin, of serf origin, occupied the chair of Russian history at Moscow University, and was active in forging links with specialists in the Slavic world further afield. Shevyrev, critic, poet, and right-wing Slavophile, had had a hand in Volkonskaia's project to found a national art museum, served as professor of Russian literature at Moscow University, and interwove national interests even in the lectures on the Italian Renaissance that he gave at the Moscow School in 1845. 27 Perhaps most notably, Khomiakov, poet, playwright, and theologian, emerged as a key Slavophile ideologue in a series oflucid articles, including one of 1847 entitled \"On the Possibility of a Russian Artistic School:' ''Art does not emerge from one mind alone;' Khomiakov proclaimed. \"Rather, the entirety of human life with its enlightened spirit, free will, and religious belief is concentrated and expressed within it. An artist cannot create by his own conviction alone; it is the spiritual strength of the people which creates within the artist. From this it is evident that every form of art must be, and cannot fail to be, nationa1:' 28 The antithesis of affective individualism, art was thus a distillation of the spiritualism and moral fiber of all humanity, and was\n\nRosalind P. Blakesley\n\nI\n\n17\n\nbound to take shape in national form. Tellingly, in an article published in Moskvitianin in 1845, Khomiakov had asked what the Russian soul and Russian painting had in common, using the adjective russkii (referring to Russian ethnicity) to describe the soul, but rossiiskii (pertaining to the imperial Russian state) to describe the art. 29 Clearly for him, existing Russian painting (by which he meant academic practice) and the broad Russian populace had yet to establish any meaningful relationship, and remained mutually exclusive domains. As Stites has noted, the pressing question is how the national commitment articulated by Khomiakov and other supporters of the Moscow School found visual expression in the work that its students produced. 30 Significantly, it was content, rather than form, which was believed to f"
