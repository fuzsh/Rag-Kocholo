        "text": "The ideological meaning of a huge canvas “I. Stalin and K. Voroshilov in the Kremlin” had to be disclosed clearly and intelligibly to every Soviet citizen. The forward-gaze of Stalin and Voroshilov read strength and unbending will of the Bolshevik – each spectator could see that the guard of the Soviet people are creative socialist labor party, the Soviet government and tested in battle, the Red Army. The ideological plan initially emphasized even verbally: the picture was called “On guard of peace.” Peaceful work in the picture is actually present. Moscow is built, as well as the whole country, and is growing Soviet Fatherland. For the painting, Alexandr Gerasimov got Stalin Prize in 1941. Soviet artist Alexandr Gerasimov (1881-1963) – architect and art theorist, teacher, professor, Doctor of Arts (1951), the first president of the USSR Academy of Arts in 1947-1957, respectively, Academician of the USSR Academy of Arts (1947), People’s Artist of the USSR (1943). Winner of four Stalin Prizes (1941, 1943, 1946, 1949). Member of the CPSU (b) since 1950.\n\nAleksandr Gerasimov was born on July 31, 1881 in Kozlov (Michurinsk now). Here, in a small provincial town of Tambov province, he spent his childhood and teenage years. In 1903 – 1915 Gerasimov studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. His mentors were the major Russian painters: A. Arkhipov, NA Kasatkin, KA Korovin, Valentin Serov. Influenced by Konstantin Korovin aspiring painter turned to the study of Impressionist artists, which reflected in his own paintings: “In the garden. Portrait of Nina Gilyarovskaya” (1912), “Bouquet of flowers. Window” (1914).\n\nAfter graduating from Painting Department of the School in 1910, Gerasimov joined the architectural office and continued to work in the studio of Korovin. In 1915 he left the College with the title of the artist of 1-st degree and architect. Gerasimov became a member of the artistic association “Free creativity”.\n\nDuring the training period the artist turned mainly to landscape painting, creating works, lyrical in mood: “Bees are buzzing” (1911), “Rye mowing” (1911), “A White Night” (1911), “Bolshak” (1912), “Heat” (1912), “March in Kozlov” (1914).\n\nAddicted to impressionism in his youth, later he began to paint in the genre of socialist realism. Pictures of AM Gerasimov painted with bright, saturated colors and are often devoted to the history of the Soviet Union and Communist Party. He was the favorite artist of Stalin. His portraits by AM Gerasimov during the life of the leader considered canonical. Gerasimov was a friend with Voroshilov, and painted many portraits of Voroshilov.\n\nSince the beginning of the reign of NS Khrushchev, Gerasimov was gradually removed from all his posts, and the artist’s paintings were removed from the museum expositions. Alexandr Gerasimov died July 23, 1963. He was buried in Moscow at the Novodevichy cemetery.\n\nSoviet artist Alexandr Gerasimov"
