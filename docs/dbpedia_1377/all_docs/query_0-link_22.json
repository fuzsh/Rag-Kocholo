        "text": "Traditional twenty lots — is nine paintings, five of the original sheets and three — lottery drawing, the porcelain layer and two works made in mixed media\n\nCatalogue of the Auction № 179.\n\nSelected lots of the Auction № 179\n\nthis time we will begin the catalog description with a... portrait. Unusual, but worth it. \"Portrait of a young man\" Ilya Efimovich Repin painted in 1866, during the period of study at the Imperial Academy of arts. As experts say, \"the greater part of graphic works of Repin, extant from this time, with the exception of academic figures, portraits of friends and relatives, made from nature during parties or at a party, as evidenced by more notes on the drawings. Composition, format, interpretation of the image and intimate in nature... allow to attribute this portrait to this cycle.\"\n\nOnly in the catalog still life — \"Bouquet of flowers against the sea\" David Burliuk — is written, according to the expert, in the 2-й third of the twentieth century \"is the so-called \"American period\" in the artist. Since 1922, he lived in the United States, which often create still lifes, characterized by grotesque-примитивной manner of execution, unexpected combinations of the depicted objects, decorative, texture painting surface, a complex and bright color scheme\".\n\nWell, now it was the turn of the landscapes. This time, a lot of them — pictorial, graphic, and drawing.\n\nOpens a string of six scenic landscapes large canvas \"Summer day\" (1946) Ivan Semenovich Blokhin — artist, whose paintings are not just see, they need see. Don't be lazy, be sure to first read about him and here, and then take a look at \"Summer day\" written just at the time when \"the creative artist's style changes dramatically. In contrast to the bright and Sunny paintings of the previous period, colour, consistency of colors for new works requires close attention.\n\nThey should look at different times of day, under different angles, in different lighting, walk past again and again. And then with the excitement of discovering that all elements landscapes are in motion, change the colours and... It is hidden from the superficial glance, the movement is perceived as magic.\" (source: nasledie-rus.ru).\n\nthe first half of the 1940s-х include \"Asian street\" Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov — filled with sun and mountain air small cardboard, written, obviously, in evacuation in Samarkand. At work, you can see individual style features of the style of the artist beginning 1940-х — in particular, according to experts, a very typical main coloristic chord, built on the contrast of large areas of yellow-охристого, gray-лиловых shadows and little bright spots of pink-красного and black.\n\n\"Before the storm\" (1972) Alexander Georgievich Gulyaev — infrequent landscape work of the author of portraits and genre paintings. Born in Altai, studied in Tashkent and Samarkand, who worked in Leningrad, Gulyaev was able to see light and color, understood and brilliantly conveyed on the cardboard kaleidoscope rotating before the storm of the colors of nature and the incredible shimmering colors, which in the wrong light coming through the clouds, draws all around.\n\nIn 1981 was written (and would like to say that-филоновски , designed with love and incredible skill) classical landscape with the ruins of Tsaritsyno, Konstantin Kuznetsov, a member, though occasional exhibitions of the group \"Twenty Moscow artists\". \"It's not just the landscape \"mood\", but a complex and composite shaped structure in which intertwine nature, culture and religion. In how they are fused, synthesized sounds, the legacy of the symbolists of the early twentieth century. But not only figuratively-поэтическое unity connects two generations of artists: even the way the style is sometimes close. Work fractional, separate stroke, a kind of connection to graphic and picturesque beginning, ornamentation, decorative surfaces are combined in painting K. Kuznetsova with a keen interest in the issue of space, often paradoxically \"encrypted\" in the apparent planar \"carpet\" surface picture\" (source: chekalin.net).\n\nLandscape \"untitled (Composition with figure)\" (1980) Anatoly Stepanovich slepysheva filled with air. This bright, positive and interior work in a recognizable manner free of one of the best colorists of the other art.\n\nBrushes Aaron Froimovich Buch belongs to the landscape \"Autumn in the woods\" (1998). A riot of colors and lines in this wonderful image creates an image of quiet, calming, liberated from the concerns of the forest: edge strewn with yellow leaves, and already beginning to pull the autumn cold.\n\ndry forest — dried autumn leaves and tree stump dotted with mushrooms, bathed in a colorful drawing with colored pencils \"Turgenev\" (1996) creative tandem Vladimir Dubossarsky and Alexander Vinogradov. Our little (27,5 x 18,5) not drawing easel graphics, and a sketch for the large (140 × 100) work oil on canvas \"Turgenev's \"notes of a hunter\"\" (1996) from the series \"Russian literature\" is stored in one of the Moscow private collections.\n\nComplete landscape section three sheets of draw / printed graphics. The earliest — sheet with etching IvanShishkin \"the Forest\" from the rare album \"Dutch treat\" (St. Petersburg, 1874), published in the starving inhabitants of the Samara province.\n\nNext is a sheet XIX from the album \"Autolithographies : Twenty drawings executed on stone by the author\" (1923) one of the best representatives of Cimmerian school, Konstantin Fedorovich Bogaevsky — done a masterful lithograph, very accurate in the depiction of the smallest details of nature of Crimea.\n\nthe latest of The drawings of — etching \"Butterfly\" (1998) sixties Vyacheslav Vasilyevich Kalinin. And it's not so much the landscape, how much work-размышление dedicated to the beauty of nature \"Kalinin village\" Pikalevo (as evidenced by the inscription \"Pikalevo\" in the lower left corner of the print), long-term resting places of the artist, where he went from the cares and realities of life in the city\n\nthe Theatre schedule is presented in the catalog of the two sheets.\n\nthe First — is a sheet with sketches Vladimir Evgrafovich Tatlin for the play in three acts \"the Far country\" about the lives of children in evacuation, staged at the Central children's theatre (Moscow) on the play by E. Schwartz. The premiere took place on 29 April 1944.\n\nthe Second sheet — sketch of the dress of Tatyana Larina for the Opera PI Tchaikovsky's \"Eugene Onegin\" (variant), created by Yuri Pavlovich Annenkov in 1943. The sketch was intended for the Opera, staged Annenkov as a Director and artist at the Great hall of the Salle Pleyel in Nazi-occupied Paris.\n\nTo the theatre section is adjacent and written in a modernist vein, a large work in oil, \"a Cellist\" (1990-е) modern Uzbek artist Shakira Zakirova.\n\nthe Following graphic sheet in the directory — illustration Anatoly T. Zverev to Gogol \"a Terrible revenge\", made in 1956. Under the picture Zverev wrote a quote from Gogol: \"Meet under the dark evening with some-нибудь man, and he immediately showed that he opens his mouth and vistalive teeth...\" As the expert writes, \"the figure relates to great early series of illustrations A. T. Zvereva, the works of N. Gogol, many of which he knew nearly word for word. These illustrations are distinguished by the virtuosity of performance, liveliness and fluency of lines, the accuracy of the figure. Skill Zverev-рисовальщика delights and makes each picture a masterpiece. Is no exception and... illustration for the story \"a Terrible revenge\" of the great cycle \"Evenings on a farm near Dykanka\"\".\n\nSection of abstractions was only two.\n\nan Example of pure abstraction, without any-либо applied load acts expressionist oil on paper \"Abstract composition\" from the series \"the Tube\" (1958-1962) one of the brightest representatives of the Leningrad underground, Eugene G. mihneva-Войтенко.\n\n\"Probability\" (1994) Vladimir Nikolaevich Nemukhin, made the difficult mixed media, is a right-таки the quintessence of the author's unique style: here and simplified geometric forms, and discreet, local flavor, and of course, the \"brand\" nemuhinskie card symbols.\n\nthe Lottery porcelain Plast \"They look down\" Ilya Iosifovich Kabakov produced in Japan in 1999, the figure of 1995 to the same sculpture, installed in 1999 in the city of Nagoya (Japan).\n\nCompletes the review of current catalog beautiful textured work, \"M&M-2\" (2015) — metal prints authorship Konstantin Khudyakov in part Alexander Anatolyevich Sploshnov.\n\nThose who are going first to buy a painting or drawing, would be helpful to know that no monitor ever authentic will not give works of art. Color, texture, not to mention the aura of a particular work, the impression from the meeting with her, the monitor is not subject. Good thing he can do at least wishy-washy, and not very good, on the contrary, to embellish (the last one we have, but it is fair to say it's worth). In addition, each person sees and feels by-своему. So come see all the work with my own eyes we have, Gorokhovsky, 7 (only need to call and make an appointment).\n\nwe Wish you all a good bargain and good shopping!\n\nthe Fair market price level on the works of the authors represented in the catalog of this auction can be identified in the information database of auction results ARTinvestment.RU.\n\nOn the auction AI continues to operate a virtual party \"Reserve price is not reached\". He appears in the final minutes of trading, so that customers have the option to kill the reserve price (for those items where it is). In other words, if you see party \"Reserve price is not reached,\" that is a reason to continue the fight — perhaps the victory is near.\n\nIf the latter rate appears accompanied litters \"Until reserve was 1 step\", it means that making the next bet, you win the auction — unless, of course, who-нибудь, inspired close luck not interrupt your last words. And always a shame when participants traded a few days and especially the last couple of hours excitedly before closing suddenly stop just one step from victory. If you feel that thing — is yours, so take this step!\n\nNote: the fee from the buyer 15% of the final price of the lot.\n\n***\n\nWe continue to make paintings and drawings (original and lottery) to our regular weekly auctions.
