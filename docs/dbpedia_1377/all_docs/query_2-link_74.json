        "text": "It was not a private artist, living only in a world of his images, and has actively participated in the life of their country. S. V. Gerasimov long directed the Union of artists of the USSR, and thus participated in the implementation leading role of the Communist party in the field of fine arts. He is remembered as a skilled administrator with a reputation as a moderate liberal, he was an attentive and skillful teacher, who left many disciples. But most importantly, his legacy – paintings, watercolors and drawings, marked by the seal of great talent and a sensitive soul.\n\nSmall homeland\n\nIn 1885, in the Moscow suburb of Mozhaisk in a poor family, was born Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov. The artist says that his life was tied to these places for a very long time. Subsequently, already occupying responsible positions in Moscow, he came to your Mozhayskiy house where there was a small workshop, and used every opportunity to paint, trying to Express in landscapes dim the beauty of the surroundings.\n\nThe Son of a craftsman–Tanner, he managed to get an excellent education, graduating from two leading Moscow art school: Stroganov art-industrial and the School of painting, sculpture and architecture. Lucky for him and with teachers, among whom were Konstantin Korovin and Sergei Ivanov. In addition to virtuoso painting technique of working with oil paints, Sergey has mastered watercolor, lithography, etching and other types of graphics that has expanded his creative opportunities.\n\nSearch style\n\nThe October revolution, he met an accomplished master. S. V. Gerasimov was a famous works, created in different material and in different genres: \"carts\" (1906), ‘Wedding in a restaurant\" (1909), “Portrait of I. D. Sytin\" (1912), \"North\" (1913). Genre scenes, portraits, and especially landscapes of the time is filled with fine poetic feeling, expressed in a free painting style, close to impressionism.\n\nThe Search for new forms in painting, which marked the beginning of the XX century, could not get past a young but very educated Gerasimov. Subsequently, the artist will be a period of fascination with cézanne and the early Cubists (“Soldier\" (1926)). There was a time when he felt close primitives. But the opinion of a large number of critics who identify Gerasimov to the outstanding masters of Russian impressionism, seems the most justified. Even mechanical attributing it to the founders of socialist realism in painting has more to do with his high position in the official hierarchy.\n\nNew times\n\nAfter a long break caused by the First world war and the difficulties of the revolutionary time, S. V. Gerasimov included in the active artistic life of the young nation. He is involved in the work of such art unions as “Jack of diamonds”, “the Moscow artists ' Society” and the Association of artists of revolutionary Russia (AHRR), which was the forerunner of the Union of Artists of the USSR.\n\nHe tries to master the revolutionary propaganda genre: “the Oath of Siberian partisans\" (1933), \"V. I. Lenin at the Second Congress of Soviets of delegates–farmers\" (1931), “the farm holiday\" (1937). S. Gerasimov successfully worked in the genre of illustration, creating graphics for “the Thing Artamonova”, “the Captain's daughter”, Nekrasov, Tolstoy, Ostrovsky's dramas, to other classic and contemporary books. His watercolors, in which discern the techniques of impasto, oil paints, was recognized as innovative by many domestic and foreign fans. But my favorite genre was the landscape.\n\nSinger middle band\n\nThe Artist traveled a lot. Sergey Vasilyevich Gerasimov, biography which contains information about the tour of European countries, left a series of masterly nature studies, made in Italy, France and the Caucasus. During the great Patriotic war he was evacuated to Central Asia. There his paintings, “settled” hot Oriental flavor, with bright colors and blinding light. But was the region where it was where he always came back – Moscow region, native Mozhaysk.\n\nIn his small sketches depicting the surroundings of his native town, and in more developed paintings of the artist are particularly harmonious. Sergei Gerasimov-Russian artist who continued the traditions of Levitan, Vasiliev, Kuindzhi. The main thing in his landscape paintings – «Winter» (1939), \"Dam\" (1929), \"Spring flood\" (1935), a series of Mozhaisk (1940–1950) and many others – the amazing emotional content, the harmony and freshness of color, masterful painting skills.\n\n1943 \"the Mother of a partisan”\n\nHis work is truly multifaceted. Master of fine poetic nuances, the artist Sergei Gerasimov in the war, creates a painting that became a symbol of resistance of the people, manifested in opposition to the terrible and cruel enemy.\n\nThe Image of an old peasant woman, whose son led away to execution, tells the story of a spiritual power, which becamean insuperable barrier to invaders. This picture was talking to the audience about the Russian character more than Tom ideologically literature. It explained a lot, telling about the causes of the invincibility of our people. Gerasimova what prompted the writing of this picture? To see here only desire to meet ideological criteria – not true. “the Mother of a partisan” – a work of truly Russian artist, whose soul is inseparable from the people, from the earth and nature, it is raised.\n\nSergey Gerasimov, artist.
