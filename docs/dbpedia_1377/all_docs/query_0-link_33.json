Besides, pigeon keeping was extremely popular in the Soviet Union. There were clubs for pigeon lovers, and dovecotes were in every yard. Circling flocks of beautiful birds – white, black and blue-gray doves flew over our heads. Pigeons could always be seen on the roof of the dovecotes, looking from above at the whistling and waving children. Pigeon keeping was a favorite hobby of many Soviet men. And especially for pigeon fanciers, or just bird lovers and ornithologists issued matchbox labels and postage stamps with the images of pigeon breeds.\n\nUnfortunately, dovecotes began to disappear as a class by the end of the 90s. With the collapse of the USSR changed interests and, gradually pigeon keeping seized to exist. Although pigeon lovers clubs still exist and volunteers support old city tradition, but one can hardly gather a flock of birds with just one cheerful whistle, as it was before.\n\nRead more »\n\nNew Year holiday in Soviet art\n\n25 years ago the Soviet Union ceased to exist, but in a good holiday traditions, the Soviet feast remains typically Soviet.

Considering many of them, you see how changed the language of art over the years, finding new forms, and new themes.\n\nBeniamin Basov seemed to stand apart from these rather drastic changes. Since that time, he graduated from the Moscow Art Institute (1948), and his work developed by its own laws, while maintaining amazing consistency and integrity. Having received from his teachers (primarily from Sergei Vasilyevich Gerasimov) traditions of Russian realistic art, Basov stays true to this tradition. His paintings and drawings always maintain the vitality of the observations, the accuracy of the figure, and the objectivity of artistic vision. These qualities are inherent in the art of Basov constantly – from the mid-fifties to his last day.\n\nRead more »\n\nSoviet Azerbaijani artist Farhad Khalilov\n\nGeneration of Soviet Azerbaijani painters to which Farhad Khalilov (b. 1946) belongs, began his career with a sense of gratitude to his senior colleagues.

In the sixties, the concept of “Soviet Azerbaijani school of painting” has acquired a new meaning. It has been widely accepted outside the republic as a significant and independent phenomenon. In the canvases of Farhad Khalilov, we also immediately feel the internal relationship with these new traditions of Azerbaijani painting. And in the understanding of color, and in a hidden but undeniable sense of decoration, and the temperamental brush.\n\nKhalilov began studying at the Stroganov School of Industrial Art, then, after a long break, he graduated from the Moscow Institute of Printing.
