        "text": "A line of people eager to greet Mrs. Clinton stretched all the way to the Steamship Authority wharf just before the rainy-day event Wednesday at the Bunch of Grapes Bookstore in Vineyard Haven. The former Secretary of State and longtime Island visitor was noncommittal about a run for the presidency.\n\nPresident Clinton Returns for Short Visit\n\nFormer President William Clinton will arrive on Martha's\n\nVineyard today for a long weekend with his wife, U.S. Sen. Hillary\n\nRodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), and daughter Chelsea.\n\nThe family will stay at the Chilmark home of Kenneth H. Iscol, a\n\ncellular-telephone industry executive. Mr. Clinton will celebrate his\n\n56th birthday here on Monday.\n\nThe Clintons first visited the Island in 1993 and except for 1996\n\nhave returned to its shores every year since.\n\nHillary Clinton's Book Signing Draws a Good-Humored Crowd\n\nBy ALEXIS TONTI\n\nAt 7:30 Saturday morning, the line of people waiting for tickets for\n\nSen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's book signing had become so unwieldy\n\nthat the police department asked the Bunch of Grapes, which had been\n\nscheduled to open at nine, to let people in early.\n\nWhistle Stop Weekend Begins\n\nTwo Presidential Hopefuls Stage Fundraisers This Weekend; Hillary\n\nClinton Will Take Tabernacle Center Stage\n\nBy MIKE SECCOMBE\n\nIn the three-way contest for the hearts, minds and wallets of\n\nDemocratic Party supporters on the Vineyard, Hillary Clinton, it is now\n\nclear, is way out in front.\n\nOver the next six days, the three front runners for the\n\nparty's Presidential nomination will hold events on the Island:\n\nJohn Edwards this evening, Mrs. Clinton on Saturday and Barack Obama\n\nnext Wednesday.\n\nWhat began last August, when Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton came here as the leading Democratic presidential candidate to raise money and woo Vineyard voters, has since deteriorated into an unseemly and tedious slugfest that does no credit to her party’s selection process. Indeed, her rejection by every one of the Island’s six towns, and the subsequent elevation of Sen.\n\nSen. Barack Obama should consider his defeated rival for the Democratic party presidential nomination, Sen. Hillary Clinton, as his running mate in November, political analyst David Gergen told a Vineyard audience on Wednesday.\n\nWithout tough political fighters like Senator Clinton working with him, Mr. Gergen said, Senator Obama risks being overwhelmed by the same Republican attack machine which had so effectively “Swift-boated” John Kerry’s bid."
