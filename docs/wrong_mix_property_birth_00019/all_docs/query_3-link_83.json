        "text": "In August, 1995, Carolyn Huber, an aide to Bill and Hillary Clinton, was doing a little tidying up around the White House when, in the so-called book room, she noticed a sheaf of computer printouts lying on a table. Without looking at them too closely, Huber picked up the papers and shoved them, along with a stray coat hanger, into a box, which she then pushed underneath a table in her office. The printouts—and the coat hanger—sat there, undisturbed, for five months, until Huber finally got around to cleaning her office and discovered what a mess she had got into.\n\nThe printouts were old billing records from the Rose Law Firm. They detailed work that Hillary Clinton had performed in the nineteen-eighties for Madison Guaranty, a failing Arkansas savings and loan, and they had been subpoenaed back in 1994 as part of the Whitewater investigation. The records had been searched for but, investigators were told, were nowhere to be found. Huber realized that she needed to report the discovery of the documents right away. When she delivered the papers to the Clintons’ lawyers, her hands were shaking.\n\nAs Carl Bernstein tells us in his new biography of Hillary, “A Woman in Charge” (Knopf; $27.95), the appearance of the billing records presented a challenge even to the First Lady’s staunchest allies. The White House book room was off-limits to almost everyone except Huber, the Clintons, house guests, and Mrs. Clinton’s grooming staff, and it was hard to imagine the First Lady’s makeup assistant taking much interest in them. (When investigators examined the records later, they found Mrs. Clinton’s fingerprints, literally, on them.) Hillary offered no explanation for what had happened—“I do not know how the billing records came to be found where they were found,” she told reporters—but was nonetheless angry that so few in her party rallied to her defense. She questioned her aides, one of whom tried to explain the awkwardness of the situation.\n\n“You know, we don’t have answers for people,” the aide said to her, according to Bernstein. “We can’t tell them where these things were. We can’t tell them why it took two years to find them.” Clinton still didn’t see the problem. “Yeah, but people should know that if I wanted to destroy these things I would have destroyed them,” she said. “And they never would have been found.”\n\nThere are two kinds of books about Clinton. The first tries to prove that she’s really much worse than you think she is, the second that she’s really no worse than you think she is. Bernstein has apparently mellowed since his Watergate days, and his book belongs squarely in the latter camp. Even as he chronicles one fabulous misstep after another, he describes the former First Lady as “well-intentioned” and “principled,” motivated by deep religious faith and a passionate sense of caring. He characterizes the “so-called Whitewater matter” as “overblown almost from the moment the New York Times first wrote about it,” and relates Clinton’s various self-justifying comments—“If I wanted to destroy these things, I would have”—with no apparent irony.\n\nJeff Gerth and Don Van Natta, Jr.,’s “Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton” (Little, Brown; $29.99) is the other kind of Clinton book. Van Natta is a Times reporter and Gerth a former Times reporter. Indeed, it was Gerth who broke the “so-called Whitewater matter,” back in 1992, and then, more than any other journalist, kept the story alive. The tantalizing promise of “Her Way,” which is appearing simultaneously with “A Woman in Charge,” is that there is still a book’s worth of dirt about Hillary out there. But, thanks in part to Gerth’s earlier diligence, this is a promise that’s tough to make good on. Take the hitherto untold story of Lee Telega, a Cornell University extension employee who worked in Clinton’s Washington office for six months, guiding the new senator on agricultural policy. Gerth and Van Natta go to great lengths to prove that Clinton’s office never filed the required paperwork for Telega. The result? Apparently, Senator Clinton is guilty of receiving unauthorized dairy-farming advice.\n\n“A Woman in Charge” and “Her Way” join what is, by now, a veritable library of Clinton biographies, including Donnie Radcliffe’s “Hillary Rodham Clinton: A First Lady for Our Time,” Gail Sheehy’s “Hillary’s Choice,” David Brock’s “The Seduction of Hillary Rodham,” and Edward Klein’s “The Truth About Hillary.” The pace of publication has quickened recently, so that the book lists this spring and summer include at least five new Clinton volumes—six if you count the paperback that accompanies “The Hillary Clinton Voodoo Kit: Stick It to Her, Before She Sticks It to You!”\n\nJust about every biography—and this includes the two latest entries—begins with a description of Clinton’s formative years: her middle-class childhood in Park Ridge, Illinois; her stint as a Goldwater Girl in high school; her arrival, in thick glasses and bell-bottoms, at Wellesley College. Most then rush through her years at Yale Law School, a romantic interlude whose unromantic climax is seventeen years in Arkansas. There follows a discussion of the 1992 campaign, Hillary’s critical role in saving Bill from Gennifer Flowers, and the requisite reflection on the complex nature of their marriage. Sympathetic and unsympathetic biographers alike tend to tell Clinton’s more recent history as a sequence of spectacular humiliations—first Gennifer, then health care, then Monica—followed by even more spectacular recoveries: an office in the West Wing, a seat in the United States Senate, a shot at the Presidency. Along the way, they offer some never before disclosed documents or factoids. As the end approaches, they try to come up with an account of what matters to Hillary and what doesn’t—an explanation of who she truly is. Then, in the very last pages, they acknowledge that the effort probably hasn’t quite succeeded and that the reader is still feeling at sea. As the historian Gil Troy observes in his 2006 biography, “Hillary Rodham Clinton: Polarizing First Lady,” the “literature regarding Hillary Rodham Clinton is vast but unsatisfying.” Or, as Gerth and Van Natta put it at the close of their book, “So, who is the real Hillary?” So many pages, so little progress.\n\nThe repeated failure to get at the “real” Hillary can itself be variously interpreted. It can be taken as a reason to abandon the project or, alternatively, to rethink the question. On the face of it, one would be hard pressed to maintain that the public doesn’t yet know enough of the relevant facts. By now, even those who have been only half paying attention possess more information—much of it intimate—about Hillary Clinton than they do about their neighbors, their co-workers, and, quite possibly, their parents. If many Americans, including many of Clinton’s biographers, still feel that they don’t know the real Hillary, then surely that must say something about who Hillary really is.\n\nConsider the apparently simple but, it turns out, unanswerable question of her name. When she married Bill, at the age of twenty-seven, Clinton pointedly decided to remain Hillary Rodham. According to Bernstein, she had resolved to do this “as a young girl, even before the practice was encouraged by a nascent women’s movement.” He quotes Clinton telling a friend that the choice was a matter of principle: it affirmed that she would continue to be “a person in my own right.” Seven years later, when Bill was in a tough campaign to regain the Arkansas governorship, Hillary changed her mind. Except, she insisted, it wasn’t a change at all.\n\n“I don’t have to change my name,” she declared. “I’ve been Mrs. Bill Clinton. I kept the professional name Hillary Rodham in my law practice, but now I’m going to be taking a leave of absence from the law firm to campaign full-time for Bill and I’ll be Mrs. Bill Clinton.” Hillary remained Mrs. Bill Clinton all the way up to the eve of her husband’s Inauguration as President, at which point she suddenly began introducing herself as Hillary Rodham Clinton. This change, too, she insisted, wasn’t one. “Hillary Rodham Clinton has been the First Lady’s name all along, since 1982,” her press secretary, Lisa Caputo, told the Times, in what was described as a tone of exasperation. “We’re at a loss as to why people think this is something that we’re just trying to change now.” A few weeks ago, the Albany Times-Union reported that Clinton has now dropped “Rodham” from her Presidential-campaign literature, though it still appears on communications from her Senate office. Even the one apparent constant in this history—Hillary—turns out to be dodgy. During a 1995 trip to Nepal, Clinton said to reporters that she had been told that she was named after Sir Edmund Hillary, the first climber to reach the top of Mt. Everest. This is why, she explained, her name has two “l”s. But, since Clinton was born in 1947 and Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander, was unknown outside his own country until his summit, in 1953, the account, as many noted, was implausible. (Questioned about the tale during the 2006 Senate campaign, a Clinton aide called it a “sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter.”)\n\nIn a political culture like ours, where character supposedly is all, this sort of fuzziness is obviously a problem. And yet even here it’s possible to look for an advantage. Clinton’s Presidential campaign is explicitly premised on the idea that no one really knows her. The day before the formal announcement of her candidacy, on January 20th, Clinton told NPR’s Steve Inskeep, “I may be the most famous person you know very little about.” Two days after the announcement, she told NBC’s Brian Williams, “I’m probably the most famous person you don’t really know.” The day after that, she told the “Today” show’s Meredith Vieira, “I may be the most famous person you really don’t know.” Speaking to potential supporters in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the following weekend, she said, “I may be the most famous woman you don’t really know.”\n\nIn the fifteen years since Hillary became First Lady, she has made news for almost everything she’s done. (Her hair styles alone have probably generated more headlines than most congressmen.) Two episodes, however, stand out, because they were so consequential and, in different ways, so disastrous. “A Woman in Charge” is especially good on what’s generally referred to as the health-care debacle; “Her Way” offers genuinely new insights into Clinton’s vote on Iraq.\n\nBernstein makes several things clear about the health-care debacle, one of which is that it didn’t have to happen. As he reports the story, the first critical misstep was Bill’s. Many of the new President’s advisers, including Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, and Donna Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, opposed the choice of Hillary to lead what was formally known as the President’s Task Force on National Health Care Reform. They doubted her qualifications and advised the President to keep his distance. Shalala tells Bernstein that she warned the President, “You can’t run a major policy like this out of the White House. You’ve got to have some insulation from it, in case it falls on its face.” But he wouldn’t—or couldn’t—listen. As an anonymous deputy explains to Bernstein, it was a matter of politics in the most domestic sense. Hillary had “stood by him in the Gennifer Flowers mess. And he had to pay her back. This is what she wanted.”\n\nThe next mistakes were Hillary’s, and Bernstein documents them in rich detail. Clinton and the task force’s staff coördinator, Ira Magaziner, assembled five hundred members for the group, then decided to organize them—if that’s the right word—into thirty-four committees. Not surprisingly, work quickly fell behind schedule. The committees were required to meet under near-military conditions of secrecy: members were forbidden to photocopy documents under discussion or even bring pens and pencils to some sessions. Their meetings were closed to the press and, indeed, to all outsiders, an arrangement that was soon challenged—successfully—in court.\n\nClinton’s biggest blunder, as Bernstein tells it, was to offend the very legislators whose support she needed most. At a retreat for Democratic senators in the spring of 1993, Clinton was asked whether it was realistic to pursue such an ambitious health-care program, given her husband’s many other legislative initiatives. She responded that the Administration was prepared to “demonize” those who opposed the task force’s recommendations.\n\n“That was it for me in terms of Hillary Clinton,” Senator Bill Bradley, of New Jersey, told Bernstein. “You don’t tell members of the Senate you are going to demonize them. It was obviously so basic to who she is. The arrogance. The assumption that people with questions are enemies. The disdain. The hypocrisy.”\n\nWhen the task force finally finished its proposal, months after it had promised to do so, the bill was one thousand three hundred and twenty-four pages long and so complex that, Bernstein writes, “even Hillary’s closest allies on the Hill could not fathom its contents.” In the meantime, Clinton all but assured a poor reception for the bill by allowing it to be leaked to the Washington Post before formally briefing lawmakers. Still, there was hope for some kind of health-care reform. As the task force’s plan was dying, key senators and congressmen of both parties proposed simpler alternatives. Had Clinton thrown her support behind any one of these, millions of Americans who lack health insurance might now be covered. But she refused.\n\n“I find her to be among the most self-righteous people I’ve ever known in my life,” Bob Boorstin, the task force’s deputy for media relations, told Bernstein. “And it’s her great flaw, it’s what killed health care.”\n\nThe Senate voted on the Iraq war resolution on October 11, 2002. On October 10th, Clinton delivered a speech on the Senate floor explaining her position. She called her vote “very difficult”—“This is probably the hardest decision I have ever had to make,” she said—but she would “cast it with conviction,” she added.\n\n“The facts that have brought us to this fateful vote are not in doubt,” she said. “Intelligence reports show that Saddam Hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock, his missile-delivery capability, and his nuclear program. He has also given aid, comfort, and sanctuary to terrorists, including Al Qaeda members.” All these so-called facts, of course, turned out to be very much in doubt.\n\nA great deal has been written about the intelligence gathered before the war and about the extent to which it was manipulated. It now seems clear that the White House presented to the public information that it knew, or at least should have known, to be false. But senators had access to information that the public never saw. Ten days before the vote authorizing the war, the Bush Administration delivered to Congress a classified, ninety-page report entitled “National Intelligence Estimate: Iraq’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass Destruction.” The document, most of which to this day has not been released, detailed what was known and, just as important, what was not known about Saddam’s capabilities. On the basis of the report and other information, Senator Bob Graham, of Florida, then the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, decided that evidence of W.M.D.s in Iraq was weak. He repeatedly urged his colleagues to read the full report and not to rely on the unclassified—and highly selective—summary that the Administration had made public. (Graham was one of the twenty-three senators who ultimately voted against the war.)\n\nDid Clinton take the trouble to read the intelligence estimate before casting her vote? All the evidence that Gerth and Van Natta review indicates that she didn’t. Clinton would have had to go to a secure room in the Capitol to get access to the document. Meanwhile, as Gerth and Van Natta point out, her aides could not have seen the intelligence estimate, because they lacked the necessary security clearances. Her spokesperson recently told the Washington Post that Clinton was briefed on the report “multiple times” by several members of the Administration.\n\nNo one, except perhaps Clinton, can know whether reading the intelligence estimate would have influenced her decision to authorize the war. Gerth and Van Natta argue, plausibly, that her vote was all but predetermined by her need to appear “tough” and by her husband’s 1998 bombing campaign against suspected W.M.D. sites in Iraq. They also argue, plausibly, that her failure to consult the report undermines recent statements she has made. At a candidates’ forum in February, Clinton declared, “My vote was a sincere vote based on the facts and assurances that I had at that time.” Also in February, she said, “If I had known then what we know now, there would never have been a vote and I never would have voted to give the President the authority.” At a campaign stop in New Hampshire the same month, she pointedly refused to label her vote a mistake, saying, “The mistakes were made by this President, who misled this country and this Congress.” But can you really be misled by a report you’ve never read?\n\nNeither Bernstein nor Gerth and Van Natta talked to Clinton directly for their books. (Bernstein reports that when he started work on his book, in 1999, both Hillary and Bill indicated that they would be happy to speak to him; later, they changed their minds, on the ground that they didn’t want to favor one book over all the others.) As a result, “A Woman in Charge” and “Her Way” are forced to fall back on Clinton’s largely ghostwritten, highly sanitized account of her life, “Living History,” published in 2003. Then again, Hillary being Hillary, it’s not clear how much the authors would have gained by spending time with her.\n\nI covered Mrs. Clinton sporadically from the day she began her first campaign for the Senate, on Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s farm, through her early years in office. In that period, I saw her in dozens of settings—working the state fairgrounds in Syracuse, nodding attentively during her “listening tour,” chatting with aides in Washington, signing books in Westchester County, taking a call from her husband on her cell phone. I also interviewed her a few times. When the subject was policy, she was always smart and engaged; when the topic was personal, it was like talking to someone through several layers of Plexiglas. Of course, I was trying to get at the “real” Hillary. (In the interest of full disclosure, I never even came close.)\n\nHistory is full of politicians who have sacrificed other people to their ambitions. A willingness to do so might even be called a precondition of power. Clinton is unusual in that she seems, above all, to have sacrificed herself. Whether you follow her around for months or just read a book about her, you can’t help admiring her extraordinary discipline. When her husband was accused of creating a “slush fund” to manage his extramarital affairs, she organized a legal team to protect him—that’s the kind of person she is. (Bernstein reports that, in 1990, the team interviewed five women, in one case with Hillary in the room, to obtain statements from them that they had never had sex with Bill.) In January, 2000, I accompanied Clinton on a campaign swing through western New York. The first morning began with what was expected to be a friendly radio interview. Instead, the host asked Clinton whether she had ever slept with Vince Foster. No matter what else she did or said that day, it was clear that this story was going to dominate the news cycle. Her press secretary looked as if he wanted to vomit. But Clinton managed to smile and shake hands through the next ten hours of campaign events, as if the whole incident had never happened."
