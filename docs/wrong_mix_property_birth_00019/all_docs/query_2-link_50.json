        "text": "Has Hillary Clinton Disappeared?\n\nSince the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton lost out on the US presidency to Donald Trump, the ex-first lady and Secretary of State has been living away from the political limelight.\n\nDespite it appearing that Clinton has opted for a quieter life with her husband and 42nd US president Bill – she’s actually been working on numerous projects behind the scenes and is showing no sign of slowing down.\n\nWith reports emerging that Hillary Clinton may be planning a return to US politics, it’s a good time to catch up on what she’s been doing since 2016.\n\nWhere is the former first lady now?\n\nAs of January 2023, Hillary Clinton continues to reside in her New York home with her husband, Bill Clinton.\n\nThis is just one of Hillary Clinton’s three luxury residencies.\n\nThe Clintons’ New York base means that Hillary can often be spotted making an appearance at important events in the city, such as the 20th-anniversary commemoration of the 9/11 terrorist attacks at Manhattan’s Ground Zero in September 2021.\n\nHowever, Hillary has also been busy across the pond in the UK, taking the role of 11th chancellor at Queen’s University Belfast.\n\nShe also appeared in a conversation at Cambridge University with professor and British television personality Mary Beard in September 2021.\n\nThe event featured her and her daughter Chelsea Clinton discussing recent stories from across the world that have captured their interest and their work with their production company HiddenLight.\n\nClinton’s Home in Chappaqua\n\nThe Clintons are based in the small town of Chappaqua, a north New York hamlet known for its wealthy residents seeking a peaceful refuge from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nThe Clinton family initially moved to Chappaqua after Bill Clinton’s controversial presidency, no doubt finding solace in the area’s green woodland surroundings.\n\nIt also comes as no surprise that Hillary retreated to their Chappaqua home after losing the 2016 election to Donald Trump.\n\nThe home sits on 1.1 acres of land and features a swimming pool and converted barn – where Bill Clinton famously wrote his portfolio of books after his presidency.\n\nWhen Hilary Clinton Lost the Presidential Election\n\nWhen Hillary conceded the presidential election in 2016, she immediately departed from her concession speech in Manhattan to her home in Chappaqua, New York.\n\nIn her memoir ‘What Happened,’ she recalled that “the sight of our front gate was pure relief to me” and that all she wanted to do was “get inside, change into comfy clothes, and maybe not answer the phone ever again.”\n\nIt appeared to be a turning point in Hillary’s life and career, leading to a change in her professional direction.\n\nWhat followed that moment in 2016 was almost a year of radio silence. Clinton was rarely spotted outside, seldom making headlines, and definitely not speaking out.\n\nThe media speculated that this was the end of her public-facing career until she released her memoir ‘What Happened’ in September 2017.\n\nThe book addresses Clinton’s experiences as a Democratic Party nominee and presidential candidate and where she thought it might have gone wrong for her and the party.\n\nIt seemed as though the book served as convalescence for Clinton, with her returning to public life and concentrating on her career ever since.\n\nWhat has Hillary Clinton done since the 2016 election?\n\nAn Evening with The Clintons\n\nIn 2018 and 2019, Hillary Clinton went on a 13-stop tour across the USA to headline a series of live events called ‘An Evening with The Clintons.’\n\nThe tour, which Hillary embarked on alongside her husband Bill, was billed as a\n\n“one-of-a-kind conversation with two individuals who have helped shape our world and had a front seat to some of the most important moments in modern history.”\n\nThe tour stopped off at Nevada, Texas, California, Michigan, Washington, New York, and Pennsylvania and traveled up to British Colombia and Montreal.\n\nDespite the tour being marketed as a chance for fans to engage in “intimate conversation” with the politicians, many of the live shows took place in large arenas.\n\nWhen a pipe bomb was sent to Hillary Clinton’s D.C. home\n\nDespite doing her best to stay out of US politics, Hillary was sent a package containing a pipe bomb in the lead-up to the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nThe pipe bomb was mailed to her D.C. address and many other famous democrats, including Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and even Robert De Niro.\n\nThe packages were sent by a Florida man who believed that the enemies of Donald Trump were trying to hurt him and those that supported him.\n\nFortunately, none of the packages exploded or caused any damage. However, the culprit did face sentencing for the disruption and panic caused.\n\nThe Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience\n\nIn October 2019, Hillary Clinton worked with her daughter Chelsea Clinton to release the book ‘The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience.’\n\nThe book presented stories of different – often overlooked – women throughout history that have inspired the pair of them in their lives and careers.\n\nWhile promoting the book, Hillary explained that her inspiration behind it was the lack of famous female role models in her life growing up.\n\nHer childhood search for inspirational women who worked outside the home often led her to look to her own mother, teachers, and ‘Life’ magazine pages.\n\nShe once learned that Amelia Earhart had a scrapbook full of successful women in male-dominated jobs, so young Hillary began a similar scrapbook.\n\nThis book followed the idea of learning about exceptional women who have redefined what is possible.\n\n‘Hillary,’ Documentary in 2020\n\nIn 2020, Hillary took part in a documentary film based on her life. The documentary, simply entitled ‘Hillary,’ premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and later was streamed as a four-part documentary series on Hulu.\n\nOne of the most notable aspects of the Nanette Bernstein-directed documentary was the frankness with which Clinton finally opened up and spoke publicly about her husband, Bill’s sex scandal with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nBernstein noted, “she definitely opened up more about her marriage than I expected her to,” continuing, “both the good and the bad. I think it was difficult for her, but she did do it”.\n\nYou and Me Both\n\nAlso, in 2020, following the theme of opening up and speaking out, Hillary Clinton launched a podcast in collaboration with iHeartRadio, which was titled ‘You and Me Both.’\n\nThe podcast involves Hillary sitting down with people she admires or is interested in to engage in a candid, open, and in-depth discussion. The themes of these discussions have included everything from faith and cooking tips to frank political discussion and debate.\n\nThe podcast has proven popular with followers of politics, the Democratic Party, and fans of the Clinton family.\n\nClinton also featured various fascinating guests in the series, such as James Corden, Amanda Gorman, and Nancy Pelosi.\n\nClinton was featured on the 2020 Democratic slate of electors for the state of New York.\n\nThe US Electoral College system works because instead of Americans casting their votes directly for the President, Americans are instead voting for 538 electors in their respective states.\n\nThese electors then meet in their states to vote for the President and Vice President. Despite Hillary Clinton previously speaking out to denounce the Electoral College – arguing instead that the President should be decided based on the US popular vote – she announced in October 2020 that she would be an elector for New York.\n\nShe also said she would use her position to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, which she noted was “pretty exciting.”\n\nState of Terror\n\nIn October 2021, Hillary Clinton released her debut fiction novel, entitled ‘State of Terror,’ in collaboration with mystery writer Louise Penny.\n\nThe book was described as a political thriller, undoubtedly inspired by Clinton’s own experiences in politics during the War on Terror. The novel, set in the present-day United States, follows female protagonist Ellen Adams as she is inducted into the US President’s cabinet as Secretary of State.\n\nThe fast-paced plot thickens as Ellen finds herself unraveling a terror conspiracy involving Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan.\n\nClinton’s first foray into fiction represents her ambition to tell stories that will influence beyond her political career, leaving a more accessible public legacy.\n\nHelping women amid the Afghanistan withdrawal crisis\n\nIn 2021, the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan led to an evacuation crisis that was widely reported. Once the Taliban took over Afghanistan’s major cities, dramatic footage showed thousands of people at Kabul airport attempting to escape.\n\nHillary Clinton had already warned of the “huge consequences” of withdrawing US troops back in May, and once the chaos ensued, it was reported that Clinton was working quickly to help at-risk women leave the country.\n\nWell acquainted with the Middle Eastern conflicts after her time as Secretary of State, Clinton turned her hand to the women that would be Taliban targets once US troops left in August. She attempted to arrange chartered flights for these women and publicly vocalized her concern for Afghan women and girls, and advocated for their protection.\n\nHiddenLight Productions\n\nHillary Clinton hit the headlines again in 2020 with the news that she and her daughter Chelsea co-founded a production company called HiddenLight Productions.\n\nThe project was born out of their close relationship with filmmaker Sam Branson, and their passion for telling stories about inspirational people.\n\nTheir first production was an Apple TV series based on their book Gutsy Women, with Clinton commenting,\n\n“I believe telling the stories of people who defy the odds and march forward will inspire others to do the same.”\n\nIt has become a popular move for public figures to create their own production stories and influence the stories being told globally. For instance, Barack and Michelle Obama announced their production company Higher Ground in 2018.\n\nHiddenLight secured the rights to Gayle Tzemach Lemmon’s ‘The Daughters of Kobani’ in early 2021, which is set to be a TV series. The story follows an all-women Kurdish militia fighting ISIS in North Syria, which isn’t far from Clinton’s area of interest and experience.\n\nWhat can we expect from Hillary Clinton in 2022 and beyond?\n\nDespite the long list of things Hillary Clinton has done since conceding the 2016 election, she has continued to do much of it out of the spotlight of politics and the Democratic party.\n\nHowever, after years spent keeping a lower profile, 2022 has seen Hillary and Bill appear to ease themselves closer to the front lines of their party.\n\nBoth of the Clintons are well established as highly efficient dealmakers, which could come in useful when divisions are at large across the country.\n\nIt has also been rumored that the pair will be resurrecting their annual Clinton Global Initiative conference, which ended swiftly after Hillary’s loss in 2016.\n\nIt may be easy to assume that the years since 2016 were quiet for Hillary Clinton. But take a closer look at everything she has done since, and it’s clear that the once first lady and Secretary of State is still hard at work – and showing no sign of slowing down.\n\nAfter some time out of the spotlight after conceding to Donald Trump, Clinton has made moves to develop large projects outside of politics while still advocating for the causes she cares about deeply.\n\nHowever, with public appearances increasing in recent months, it seems like involvement with the political front lines may still be on the cards for Hillary.\n\nWhether she chooses to run for the 2024 office or play a part behind the scenes, it’s clear that it will be a team effort alongside her husband, Bill."
