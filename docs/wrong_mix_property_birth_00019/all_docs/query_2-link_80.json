        "text": "But now would price for around $2.5 million, according to the real-estate experts at Trulia.\n\nCommon for the middle Atlantic states, this architecture type is characterized by that barn-like shape of the roof.\n\nPlenty of room for their dogs and grandchild(ren) to run around... and with a pool to blow off steam from the stress of the campaign trail.\n\nThe spot is a short commute from Hillary's campaign HQ in Brooklyn, Bill's office in the Financial District and Chelsea's apartment in Flatiron.\n\nPretty old, but not as old as the many other historic homes and buildings in the town, including a Quaker Meeting House that was constructed in 1763.\n\nIn addition to those Secret Service officers, there is a security office at the gate and multiple floodlights.\n\nWhen they first purchased the home, Bill was still in office as President of the United States, so cars were stopped before they even drove onto Old House Lane.\n\nOr at least, you could when this photo was taken in January 2000. Technology has probably updated the procedure by now.\n\nTheir purchase in November 1999 was over a year before Bill left office, but three months before Hillary formally announced her candidacy for Senate in New York.\n\nMembers were concerned about the level of disruption the Clintons would create, so they had to join the next closest option... Donald Trump's Trump National Golf Club Westchester.\n\nChappaqua is the 317th most expensive town, according to Forbes, with a median home price of $1.2 million and a median income of $105,000.\n\nThe Secret Service had better keep an eye on Clinton pups Tally and Maisie. Coyotes have been attacking dogs in town, according to the local police bulletin.\n\nWith a population of 1,436, it's officially classified as a \"hamlet.\""
