This dance film is a collaboration of filmmakers, dancers, choreographers, and producers from Indonesia, Hawai`i, and the Pacific Islands. It is significant because of this collaboration. Both Directors are grounded in their own culture's myths and stories and came together for ten short days to make this film as a collaborative project. The collaboration included university students and faculty at the University of Hawai'i and Shangri La, Center for Islamic Arts and Cultures."
