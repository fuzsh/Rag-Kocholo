        "text": "I'm submitting a video of myself reciting a poem that I wrote as a freshman college student. Looking back at this writing, I recognized that it was about the discomfort I felt navigating a predominantly white institution. At the time I was writing the piece, my brother was incarcerated. I found myself constantly thinking about his situation and feeling guilty that, while I was in a position of privilege, he was not free. I was upset because I felt that no one else at this privileged institution seemed to care that my brother was one of the over a million people that were being punished by the state. I wanted to express how the disparity of our situations made me feel. My brother and I have the same mother and father. We both have had to deal with the intergenerational trauma passed down to us. The difference between us was that I went to school. This put tremendous pressure on me to learn to navigate the unfamiliar space that was higher education. I was ashamed that I didn’t grow up with the knowledge or resources available to my other peers. I was angry that the university I was attending felt like it wasn’t designed for me. I was depressed because I felt that I wasn’t good enough to advance in what felt like a society designed to ensure that people like me (or my brother) did not succeed. Reflecting on the piece now allows me to have a healthier perspective on the situation. I can draw connections between the educational institutions and penal institutions that were both designed by the white men of this country. It helps me knowing that my feelings then were valid. This country was not designed for black indigenous people of color to prosper. In spite of that, we still find ourselves in the position to change the history, not only of this nation, but of the world. We can influence the design of institutions and policies that have historically disenfranchised us. Before any of this change can happen, I believe we have to come to terms with our own emotions. We must face the violence that has been perpetrated against us. We must call it out by name. We must recognize the negativity that exists within ourselves. We must claim it, and commit ourselves to not perpetuate the harm that has been done upon us. We have to hold ourselves accountable. We have to hold onto the principles we claim to believe, and find ourselves worthy of forgiveness before we can have a future where others are forgiven, not punished. Only then should we take on the responsibility of holding each other accountable, and deconstruct the systems that were built to police us. Abolish Police. Abolish Prisons. Abolish Political Parties. Abolish Western Doctrine. Abolish Ignorance. Free The People\n\nNo Virtue Under Unjust Law by Bryson Nihipali\n\nYou’re askin’ me why I’m enraged?\n\nprobably cause I was made ashamed of the way I was raised.\n\nLike my mom wasn’t tryna to raise 6 kids off a minuscule wage\n\nLike my dad wasn’t gone for a lot of those days\n\nLike he didn’t pass down a lot of his pain\n\nLike I really think things will change if I kept getting As\n\nLike this shit [white supremacy] doesn’t still stand in my way\n\nLike my people, our people weren’t exploited for a white man’s gain\n\nLike the places we used to call home weren’t given a foreigner’s name\n\nLike they don’t still see us in a similar way\n\nLike who let those savages out of their cage\n\nLike seeing your loved ones beaten by loved ones wouldn’t make you a lil insane\n\nParadoxical thoughts entered my brain at young age\n\nthis would set up the stage\n\nfor those sad days that had came\n\nwhen I was turning a page, in high school\n\ntrying to keep my kool\n\nBryson… being spiteful was never really like you\n\nthat’s really insightful,\n\nbut i never really liked you\n\nand I was never really like you\n\nyou see, our society was set up by a white fool\n\nAnd I’m supposed to unite with or fight you\n\nFor position in “his” positive light\n\ndude…\n\nif you think that’s tight, cool\n\nbut I’d rather have my wrist sliced twice,\n\nand blood poor out of my smile\n\nbefore subscribing to that system of white vile\n\nthat shit leads to denial of culture\n\nit’s not my intent to insult you\n\nbut I’m not sorry if i woke you\n\nyou asked why I feel so,\n\nwhen your privilege to slumber, while we were under played a role in the numbers\n\nbut that’s just how I’m feeling…In my soul\n\nas it’s consumed by negative energy\n\nmentally, it’s a little unsettling\n\nthe long list of things\n\nI was never meant to be."
