        "text": "Yay, after all these events and all of this work together, we finally got ourselves organized to take a photo together. <3 Mahalo to everyone here, the Temari HI consultants and featured artists of East-West Center Gallery exhibition: \"In the Folds.\" Without everyone here, this exhibition would not be possible. Each and every person here contributed so much to the richness and depth of this project - it has been such an honor working with you all! Mahalo to all of the artists for sharing such engaging and insightful presentations about your work today. Pictured left to right: Sara Oka, AR, Lynn Martin Graton, Arisa Barcinas, Marques Hanalei Marzan, Vilsoni Hereniko, Marcia Morse, Kamalu du Preez, Merle Grybowski, and Ann Asakura. Exhibition is on view at EWC Gallery through April 16! #ewc https://lnkd.in/gjaPzD6q"
