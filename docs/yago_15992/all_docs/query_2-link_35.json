        "text": "07 Jul 2023 | IndiGen news\n\nWatch Sina ma Tinirau now online for free!\n\nSina Ma Tinirau, the award-winning animated short featuring Polynesia's best-known love story of all time, is now available to view online for free. Set on the Polynesian Island of Rotuma, Fiji, this film was directed by Vilsoni Hereniko and realized in cooperation with university staff, students, artists and partial funding from our ERC Starting Grant.\n\nFrom the director, Vilsoni Hereniko:\n\n\"SINA MA TINIRAU was made during covid when it was not possible to make a live action film. Aspiring animation students and several professors at the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Hawai'i met via zoom over a period of 18 months to produce this film. Also, this is my first foray into the genre of animation. A big THANK YOU to the University of Hawai'i and the European Research Council for funding this film.\"\n\nAwards and festival screenings:"
