        "text": "We sweat and cry salt water, so we know that the ocean is really in our blood\n\nTeresia teaiwa1\n\nWhat does it mean to claim Moana Nui, T책si, or the \"Pacific,\" in all its many names, as \"Our Ocean\"? The opening quote by the late and beloved Teresia Teaiwa inspires us to acknowledge a visceral embodiment of the sea. In my analysis, the quote asserts that the ocean is the pulse that beats through the veins of Indigenous, Moana peoples, fusing genealogical and genetic memories of connection between humans and nonhumans, the living and those who have passed. It is our connections to the ocean and all its inhabitants that ignite a desire to rise. As the tides rise, we rise. Moana Nui rising, we unite to address the challenges caused by global climate change, capitalism, colonization, and militarization of our saltwater home.\n\nBloodshed surges with global temperatures, which know no borders\n\nCraig Santos Perez, \"Rings of Fire\"\n\nCraig Santos Perez is an Indigenous, Chamoru (Chamorro) father, ecopoet, political activist, environmentalist, and scholar from Gu책han (Guam) who passionately addresses issues of our fragility, futurity, and sustainability. He does so by problematizing the creation of national marine monuments, parks, preserves, refuges, and sanctuaries as a form of \"blue-washing\" that empowers the US government and its neoliberal allies to privatize and exploit Our Ocean for profit. In this response, I seek [End Page 115] to engage in this dialogue by exploring oceanic interconnectivity and arguing that Moana Nui, Oceania, is its own living entity, deserving of legal rights.\n\nOur Ocean is borderless. The flows and currents are formed by islands and continents, fresh and salt water combining, winds and weather that inform micro and macro movements and migrations of organisms, whales, sea turtles, monk seals, seabirds, and peoples who consistently defy imposed borders. The colonial borders are invisible yet capable of segmenting, racializing, and parceling political control throughout Oceania, which is adhered to within the imperial imaginary and the colonized mind.\n\nIn an interview, Nai'a-Ulumaimalu Lewis, director of Big Ocean, a global network that supports best-practice management of large-scale marine protected areas, discussed how the ocean connects not just people from the region but all of humanity. She optimistically shared that if we are smart and strategic, we can utilize conservation as a way to build relationships across the Pacific and engage at a more international level (Lewis, pers comm, 21 June 2022). Pacific Islands studies scholars have been articulating relationality in Oceania over the past several decades. For example, Vilsoni Hereniko discussed the ways in which interdependency has been a part of Moana Nui from time immemorial and how film, music, dance, poetry, and visual art are languages of the subaltern (2001). Here, I strategically draw from a multiplicity of sources, including diverse forms of expression, such as visual art and poetry, to engage in this scholarly conversation (figure 1)."
