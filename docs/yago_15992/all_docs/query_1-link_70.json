        "text": "Our engagement in this space of encounter between Pacific and non- Pacific economic, political, and ideological forces and agendas focuses on the dynamic configurations of possession and repossession in the complex space of negotiation between Indigenous representations of place, for- eign investments in paradise, and the encroachment of global capitalism. Through these countervailing forces and complex crosscurrents, Pacific paradise emerges as a potent if long-contested trope that materially gen- erates a whole range of Western and Pacific realities, desires, and aspira- tions. To capture these complex formations, this special issue thus moves beyond the idea of Pacific places as “paradise” as merely artificial, super- ficial, or illusory. Throughout the articles in this collection, important questions about global power and structural inequality remain: Whose interests does paradise serve? How is the discourse of paradise mobilized, commodified, and purchased? And whose “paradise” is reflected in these ideas and images?\n\nAs the consciousness of coloniality, diversity, and the necessity of not only token depictions of otherness but accurate representations of diversity in literature and film has grown, there has been a shift in the processes of adaptation and appropriation used by major film production companies and how they approach representing the other. One clear example of this is the comparison of the depiction of diverse, cross-cultural womanhood between Walt Disney Animation Studio's Mulan (1998) and Moana (2016). This paper will use a cross-period approach to explore the ways in which a global media conglomerate has and has not shifted its approach to appropriation of the multicultural as other and the implications for representational diversity in the context of globalization and a projected global culture. In one case, a cultural historical tale was decontextualized and reframed, while in the other, cultural actors had a degree of input in the film representation. By examining culturally specific criticisms and scenes from each film, I will explore how the legacy of coloniality can still be seen embedded in the framing of each film, despite the studio's stated intentions towards diversity and multiculturalism.\n\nThis thesis argues that the processes and resulting products of cross-cultural creative collaboration and financial partnerships in fiction filmmaking affect both the output and the very notion of New Zealand national cinema. Although the culture of commercialism in transnational financial partnerships is volatile and, therefore, the degree to which authorial control and cultural ‘veracity’ are compromised remains unpredictable, a great deal of intra-national cross-cultural collaboration in the creative processes of filmmaking is being undertaken with high levels of mutual respect and considerable awareness of both what differentiates and what connects peoples from different cultures. At a grass roots level, substantial goodwill is being generated by dialogic models of cross-cultural collaboration that provide exemplars for both the film industry and other spheres of cultural and national activity. While the speed and degree to which perspectives formed on the nation’s cultural peripheries are welcomed into ‘mainstream’ cinematic projections remain unsatisfactory, progress is being made. Much contemporary cross-cultural filmmaking is characterised by the bending and democratisation of traditional production cultures, resulting in higher levels of multiple authorship than is the norm, and the creation of new types of aesthetically hybridised films that bear the marks of their cross-cultural origins. The parameters of ‘mainstream’ national cinema in Aotearoa New Zealand are thus broadened by a burgeoning cinema that operates beyond damaging stereotypes, combines naturalistic and symbolic registers in new ways, makes visible and allows identification with the nation’s under-represented minority communities and, in doing so, inscribes a permanent place for these peoples in the national imaginary. By foregrounding the creative processes and attitudes of filmmakers and their collaborators, this thesis contributes to a growing body of work that re-appropriates and elevates authorial process and intent for a consideration of ‘the national’ in cinema and, in doing so, reveals the practicality of hoping that the cross-cultural creative collaborations increasingly producing mainstream culture indicate the evolution of a genuinely more inclusive and plural concept of New Zealand national identity."
