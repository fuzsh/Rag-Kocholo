        "text": "It's not often a movie gets to claim to be the very first cinematic offering from a country; it's even less often that a movie gets to make that claim while, nearly two decades down the line, simultaneously holding the crown as the only movie from that country. Such is the case with The Land Has Eyes, Vilsoni Hereniko's landmark Fijian film that, to this day, stands comfortably as the only film ever produced in the furthest possible nation from the States before one starts coming back around. Due to this incredibly specific distinction, judging Hereniko's film becomes somewhat of a challenge—even more so than the usual leeway needed when examining a film produced in a country that has zero…\n\nMarch Around the World 2021\n\nFilm 15: Fiji\n\n===========================\n\nRotuma is an island 580km north of Fiji at the nexus of Polynesia, Melanesia and Micronesia. The director of The Land Has Eyes Vilsoni Hereniko is a local who made this feature with his wife Jeannette Paulson Hereniko. It’s loosely based on Vilsoni’s own childhood, but he felt more creatively free changing the protagonist to a girl. He developed the script by going around villages talking to people and incorporating their suggestions. Only two of the actors aren’t from Rotuma – one of those who plays a warrior woman from legend is the renowned Maori actor Rena Owen.\n\nThere’s an article about this film online* by Alan Howard that describes in…\n\nGrass roots video drama of a Rotuman girl who casts off patriarchal islander habitudes and 'runs with the wolves' (or in this case pigs) from her warrior woman heritage to self-actualize, avenge her wronged father and bring a sense of justice to her community.\n\nHaving an understanding of the limitations faced by minor indigenous cinemas and knowing the immense efforts involved in production it's a bit of a c-move to go too hard on these kinds of films. But I gotta be honest. I found the tone somewhat trite and the film style and acting so basic as to be distracting and unpalatable. I could barely follow it, I fell asleep during the middle, and after that confusing 10 seconds…\n\n\"Please forgive us for this small amount.\"\n\nA meandering plot culminating in a completely nonsensical and jarring \"twist ending\". Horrible production values and acting. Confusing pacing and presentation in general. Flat direction. All of the music sounded like stock music, likely because it was. Even the disc itself was shoddy. The film kept freezing, not because it was scratched or dirty, but because the actual hole in the disc itself was the wrong size so it kept popping out of the tray! At least the dialogue was OK, but even that was incredibly unmemorable.\n\nHowever... does any of this really matter given the context of its production? I'm honestly happy to see a film in this \"painting the world green\"…\n\nA pretty straightforward morality tale about the importance of traditional values (traditional in this case meaning traditional to the Rotuma people of Fiji). Still, the story manages to go in a couple unexpected directions, and there's a nice girl power theme running throughout (watching granny on her motorbike chase the wealthy asshole was good for a chuckle).\n\nI want to be careful how I say this, but I liked that the villain was Rotuma rather than the white British judge. Colonialism is responsible for some truly despicable things, but when those are the only stories we have, it ends up infantalizing the colonized. We're left with an incomplete picture of their humanity, which in actuality features good behavior, bad behavior,…\n\nOne of the few films made in Fiji and the only one made in the island nation of Rotuma – the protagonist is a smart but poor girl who studies hard to win the favor of her narrow-minded teacher; she must defend the family honor when her father is innocently accused of theft and she takes strength and inspiration from an ancient legend of an outcast warrior woman.\n\nUnpolished to say the least, partly amateurish, but made with feeling and empathy - when we call something \"home made\" it is usually to the film's detriment but there is an art to mimicry, especially when the filmmakers have had no financial means. In The Land Has Eyes there is a subplot…\n\nMarch Around the World - 2022\n\n6/30\n\nFiji\n\nFor all this film has going against it, it's remarkable just how well this turned out. The Land Has Eyes starts out recounting the legend of the great warrior/ huntress who was abandoned on the island of Rotuman. The film then draws parallels between her, and a young girl in the modern day that must be courageous to fight injustices in her own way. That's a broad summation because, well, the film tries its best to touch upon many different things, and surprisingly does well enough, with passes at injustice, colonization, and even religion.\n\nWhat makes the film so noteworthy is the fact that this is not only the first ever feature…"
