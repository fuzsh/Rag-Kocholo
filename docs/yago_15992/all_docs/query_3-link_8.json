        "text": "Land Has Eyes, The aka: Pear ta ma 'on maf - 2004\n\nTe Maka Productions - 91 min.\n\nDVD UPC/EAN # 3000000060766\n\nCast: Sapeta Taito, Rena Owen, John Fatiaki, Voi Fesaitu, Elizabeth Kafonika Inia, James Davenport.\n\nScreenplay: Vilsoni Hereniko; Director of Photography: Paul Atkins; Set Design: Cary Smoot; Music: Clive Cockburn, Audy Kimura; Editing: Jonathan Woodford-Robinson; Production Design: Hupfeld Hoerder; Post Production Supervisor: Geoff Murphy; Producers: Jeannette Paulson Hereniko, Corey Tong; Director: Vilsoni Hereniko.\n\nThis first feature film from Fiji, or rather the Fijian island of Rotuma, written and directed by a native Fijian, tells of an intelligent young woman who wants more than the traditional ways of her island community. She avoids homemaking skills to aid her father with tasks such as coconut harvesting and is attracted to his folkways and beliefs, instead of the colonially imposed Christianity. This also includes his attachment to the Rotuman myth of the first ruler, Warrior Woman and her magic. The mostly in the Rotuman language soundtrack, with English subtitles, is greatly enhanced by the optional English commentary track. Although most of the actors are amateurs, the results are better than one might expect. A fine insight into a different culture and its members, struggling to adapt to modern Western society. Recommended.\n\nCensor Rating: M - Review rating: B-\n\nOfficial MP4 Trailer"
