        "text": "The official site of The Land Has Eyes\n\nMore About the Film\n\n\"Growing up on Rotuma, Fiji, I was filled with stories about the island, Greek mythology, and the Bible, which nourished me with inspiration and hope,\" shares writer/director Vilsoni Hereniko, who received a Ph.D. in literature and language from the University of the South Pacific and teaches Pacific Island literature, theater, and film at the Center for Pacific Islands Studies at the University of Hawai'i. \"It is my hope that audiences everywhere will walk away with a precious sense about Rotuma, its culture, and its people, and that we all will recognize our need for the wisdom of our ancestors.\"\n\nFrom the film's conception, Hereniko took special care to see that The Land Has Eyes would accurately represent the Rotuman people and culture. In 1999, he returned to Rotuma, travelling from village to village, sharing the story of the film and receiving blessings from the islanders. In 2000, the Hereniko family home, located in the village of Mea, was transformed into the production headquarters. Each crew member stayed with a family from the island since there are no hotels or restaurants in Rotuma. A majority of the cast were Rotumans, many of whom had never been inside a movie theater.\n\nHereniko notes, \"I'm committed to creating works of art that treat Pacific Islanders with respect and dignity. This doesn't mean that all my characters are perfect human beings. It simply means that they are fully human and believable, with great potential to do good as well as evil.\"\n\nSeveral aspects of The Land Has Eyes are similar to Hereniko's own experiences growing up in Rotuma. His father was also falsely accused of a crime he did not commit and died when Hereniko was fourteen. Like Viki's character, Hereniko excelled in school, seeing it as the \"only way out\" of his difficult situation.\n\n\"I think The Land Has Eyes has the potential to make people more aware of our spiritual and enduring relationship with the land and to see the land as a living being, which is a view held by many native people around the world. In today's climate, this is an important message for all of us,\" says Hereniko.\n\nWhile this is Hereniko's first feature film, the award-winning artist has written internationally popular books and plays. Recognizing a desire to express his stories visually, Hereniko evolved into a filmmaker. Together with his wife, Jeannette Paulson Hereniko, the couple established the film production company, Te Maka Productions."
