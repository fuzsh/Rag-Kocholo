        "text": "CFP: Fourth Cinema: Indigenous Perspectives on Home\n\nAn area of multiple panels for the 2017 Film & History Conference:\n\nRepresenting Home: The Real and Imagined Spaces of Belonging\n\nNovember 1-November 5, 2017\n\nThe Milwaukee Hilton\n\nMilwaukee, WI (USA)\n\nEXTENDED DEADLINE for abstracts: August 1, 2017\n\nLong the object of the cinematic fascination of others, indigenous peoples around the world are taking control of their own images, stories and screen representations. Indigenous, or Fourth Cinema narratives (emerging primarily from Australia/New Zealand, the US, Canada, and Latin America) explore histories of colonization, dispossession, and inter-generational trauma. Fourth cinema narratives highlight the regeneration of indigenous language and cultures that is taking place around the world, and chronicle indigenous movements for land and natural resource rights.\n\nHow do indigenous film narratives shift the traditional focus on characters and subjects who struggle between traditional ways and the modern world? What new conversations about “home” are prompted by these outsiders in the modern nation-state who are deeply rooted first inhabitants of their societies, yet relegated to the margins? In what ways do these characters complicate the insider/outsider dichotomy and the sense of home and belonging?\n\nFourth Cinema challenges viewers as well as by forging new models of collaborative community filmmaking and viewing and are not bound by the hierarchical production methods and formulaic constraints of commercial, profit-driven filmmaking.
