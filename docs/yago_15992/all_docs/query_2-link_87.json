        "text": "\"Eating Up Easter is a complex and complicated portrait of contemporary island life in the Pacific that I have not seen on screen before, with the filmmaker's island of Rapanui a stand-in for communities anywhere struggling to reconcile traditional cultures, unbridled economic growth, and sustainable futures. This cautionary tale is one of the most important and moving documentaries to come out of Oceania in recent years.\"\n\n– Vilsoni Hereniko, Professor of Creative Media and filmmaker at the University of Hawaii\n\n“One of the best, most compelling contemporary portraits of a Pacific isle by a Native filmmaker in the history of South Seas Cinema, a major contribution to the “Tidal Wave” of indigenous cinematic storytelling.”\n\nMay 6, 2019\n\n‘Eating Up Easter’: A fresh and welcome filmic portrait of Rapa Nui\n\nPeople’s World"
