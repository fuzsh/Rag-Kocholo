        "text": "Notable recent productions include: ALICK AND ALBERT (feature documentary, 2021, director Douglas Watkin); BOWLED OVER: A DRAGUMENTARY (SBS Television, 2021); HISTORY BITES BACK (executive producer, SBS Television, 2021, writer-director Trisha Morton-Thomas); animated series ZERO-POINT (Best Animation-Capricornia Film Awards, director Jonathon Saunders); feature documentary FINKE: THERE AND BACK (Madman, 2018, director Dylan River); OCCUPATION: NATIVE (SBS Television, 2017) and children’s fantasy film THE SECRET OF MOONACRE (Warner Bros), a UK-Hungary-France co-production.\n\nProjects in development include the feature films SIDETRACKED (director Miley Tunnecliffe), COUNTING THE STARS (director Bec Peniston-Bird, writer Vicki Englund), and DOG PARK (writer-director Jackie McKimmie), and drama series AFTERMATH and ART OF DECEPTION. Wearing her ‘policy’ hat Meredith has helmed two separate screen agencies in Australia where she oversaw the production and development of hundreds of hours of screen content, in all formats and genres.\n\nShe guided the review and budget bid process that resulted in an injection of over $9M into Screen Territory. She wrote VIBRANT NT, the arts and cultural policy for the Northern Territory, and, earlier, was actively involved in advocacy work through leadership and board positions with Screen Producers Australia and Ausfilm.\n\nShe assesses for Festival Australia that sees arts and culture delivered in the regions of the country. In USA, Meredith was festival director for three years for the bi-coastal film festival (New York and Los Angeles), the Polo Ralph Lauren Film Festival. Meredith was recently the Mittelheuser Scholar-in-Residence for State Library of Queensland, researching the last 30 years of filmmaking in Queensland. She has an MFA from Columbia University and was awarded the University Medal and First Class Honours from University of Queensland.\n\nAfter settling in Sydney at the renowned production house Film Graphics Sue spent several decades working on some of the biggest TVC’s in Australia. Her list of awarding winning TV commercials is extensive and ranges from classics like McDonalds ‘James Dean’ (Dir: David Denneen), to beautiful pieces like Australian Tourism Commission ‘Shorts’ (Dir: David Denneen) through to visual effects extravaganzas like Caltex ‘Flies’ and Tooheys ‘War of the Appliances’ (Dir: Graeme Burfoot).\n\nBetween 2011 and 2013 Sue spent time working out of Guillotine Post Production completing projects for Subaru Forrester and Samsung Smart TV (Dir : Bruce Hunt), FFA ‘Uniting tribes’ (Dir: Lenny Dorfman), a campaign of three TVC’s for YOUI Insurance (Dir: Bryan Cawood) and a fun Mt Franklin’s Light Sparkling Mineral Water featuring Jen Hawkins for Josh Frizzell. While commercials were her main focus, in those years Sue has also edited several short documentaries for web release. A 5min study of microfinance in India for IBM (Dir: Jeff Curry), a series of four ‘webumentry’s for Visa Business (Dir: Sean Ashcroft) and a study of GE’s heavy industry facilities in Western Australia (Dir: Kriv Stenders).\n\nIn 2012 Sue was accredited by the Australian Screen Editors Association and has since judged the annual awards for both commercials and long form. She won best TVC in 2104 for RACQ Brand (Director: Justin MacMillan) and was a finalist in 2016 for Best short film for The Boggabilla Bus (Dir: Mitch Kennedy).\n\nBecause of The Post Lounge’s variety of work Sue has also been able to stretch her wings into a variety of other forms of editing. Sue was editor on a travel web series for Top Deck, a very arty promo for the designer George Wu (Dir: Israel Rivera) and an interesting short film about a skate boarders life directed by Tristan Houghton. She also edited the trailer for Tori Garret’s feature film ‘Don’t Tell’ as well as the Missy Higgin’s film clip that accompanied that project. In 2018/19 Sue edited a 7episode web series Time & Place (Dir: Tam Sainsbury)\n\nWhen, in 2018, the opportunity to work on Love Opera, a feature length documentary, came along Sue grabbed it with both hands. Working closely with the director Liselle Mei, Sue was intrinsically involved in creating the film. Producer Trish Lake was so impressed with Sue that she is now editing Trish’s next film Alick and Albert due for release in 2021. As you can see there is little that Sue cannot turn her editorial hand to. Her philosophy is simple: It’s all about the story. Once the director is in the room I want them to relax and concentrate on the art, let me worry about the technical side of things. My biggest thrill is when I can surprise the director and client with a piece that is above and beyond their expectations.\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER\n\nRobert Calcagno\n\nRobert Calcagno has been the CEO of the Oceanographic Institute, Prince Albert I of Monaco Foundation since 2009.
