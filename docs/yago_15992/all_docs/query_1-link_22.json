        "text": "Turning Polynesian Myth into Digital Art–“Sina ma Tinirau” has won multiple awards.\n\nIt’s a tale as old as time, but Fijian film-maker Vilsoni Hereniko’s new twist on a Polynesian love story is proving a big hit with international audiences. Completed in November 2021 the Film SINA MA TINIRAU just won the best animated short award at the Berlin Independent Film Festival, 2022 and achieved outstanding Achievement Award (Animation Short) at the Indie International Short Film Festival in Los Angeles. Congratulations to the Fiji Filmmaker and his team.\n\nWatch The Trailer:\n\nWhen a prince is cursed to become an eel and has to win the love of a beautiful woman to become human again, he gifts her with his body in the form of a coconut palm tree in a seductive display.\n\nSet on Rotuma in Fiji, this classic tale of unconditional love is given new meaning and relevance today as it explores issues of conservation, tradition versus freedom, and prejudice against black skin among Polynesians.\n\nP.S. Sina and Tinirau are two mythological icons in Rotuman oral literature. Sina is a very beautiful woman while Tinirau is a handsome man. Both names often appear in Rotuman poetry and legends.\n\nAbout the Film Maker Vilosi Hereniko\n\nVilsoni Hereniko, known to his friends as Vili, has come a long way from his native Rotuma, a Polynesian outlier in the far reaches of the Fiji archipelago. Inspired by the island’s folklore as told to him by his father, the Honolulu-based filmmaker and Professor at the Academy for Creative Media at the University of Hawai’i has just released his latest film, Sina ma Tinirau, (Sina and Tinirau) which is currently being screened at the Hawai’i International Film Festival. The animated short film tells an epic tale at a running time of nine minutes.In Rotuman oral literature, Sina, a beautiful woman, and Tinirau a handsome man, are two mythological icons. Their story goes something like this: A prince, who is cursed to become an eel, must win the love of a beautiful woman to become human again. He gifts her with his body in the form of a coconut palm in a seductive display of courtship. The film is narrated in English with some dialogue in Rotuman, with subtitles. This lends an authenticity to the story.\n\nIn his retelling of an ancient tale for today’s world, Hereniko takes a page from Carl Jung by interpreting a legend that is as central to the Polynesian collective unconscious as the Crucifixion of Jesus would be in the West. In doing so, he makes the wisdom of traditional Polynesia accessible to the rest of us.\n\nIn the words of Selina Tusitala Marsh, former New Zealand Poet Laureate, “Hereniko combines sonorous storytelling with visually vibrant animation to tell a hanuju, a Rotuman mythic version of Oceania’s greatest love stories of all time.”\n\n“Sina ma Tinirau” says Hereniko, “is an ancient, oral tale that has endured the test of time because it embodies our sensibilities, worldviews, and aesthetics as Polynesians.” It’s not a conventional romantic love story between a man and a woman.”\n\nRather, he explains, “it’s an unconditional, Christ-like love exemplified by forgiveness.”​​\n\n“Even though Tinirau’s head was severed, and Sina betrayed him, he gave the Polynesian people, personified by Sina, the tree of life. This gift enabled us to survive. It’s the most useful and most important tree to us.”\n\nFor Vili Hereniko, the coconut palm’s appeal is quite personal.\n\n“As one of 11 kids, growing up on a remote South Pacific Island,” says the filmmaker, “on several occasions that tree saved my life. We didn’t always have enough food to eat. When the weather was bad, we survived on coconut meat and water.”\n\nHereniko said that when he first came to Hawai’i and observed that coconuts had been removed in all the parks and public places, it upset him in a visceral way. He called the trees “eunuchs”. It also disturbed him that many people were seemingly not bothered by what he observed as a kind of cultural castration.\n\n“It’s a matter of education, learning how to live with trees,” said Hereniko. “I mean, no one in Fiji would have a picnic under a coconut tree. They know better.” By transforming a source of food and water (at least) to become just a pretty dance tree and symbol of Paradise, local residents are denied the food and sustenance that the trees provide.\n\nHereniko also said his film touches upon the “shadow” side of the Polynesians, specifically their prejudice against black skin.\n\n“It’s something that no one talks about in public”, says Hereniko, “but it’s ubiquitous in my culture and in Polynesian society in general. The bias is there, and I wanted to bring it to the surface”. (In the myth, Sina is fair skinned and the eel is black. Sina rejects the eel’s advances at first because of its black skin).\n\nThe University of Hawai’i at Manoa Collaboration in Film and Animation Strategic Investment Grant provided initial funding to make the film, but Hereniko tapped the European Research Council, a European Union entity, which gave him more funding to complete the project.​Read More about this Fijian Director here."
