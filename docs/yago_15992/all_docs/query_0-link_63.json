        "text": "2016 Producers Immersive Participants\n\nDenny Hironaga\n\nDenny is a self-made Filmmaker. He helped produce two feature films that were selected by the Hawaii International Film Festival. His tastes lean toward quieter, character driven movies. Whether producing, directing, editing or behind the camera, his vision is to create entertaining movies that help nudge the world to be a gentler, kinder place.\n\nJoji Yoshida*\n\nJoji Yoshida is originally from Tokyo, Japan. His introduction to the movie industry came early in childhood when he visited the renowned Toei Film Studios. There he met the legendary Japanese actor Ken Takakura. Deeply influenced by Mr. Takakura, Joji’s career choice as an actor was determined back then.\n\nIn 2012 Joji appeared in the Universal Picture’s Sci-Fi action movie Battleship alongside Liam Neeson and pop singer Rihanna. Most recently Joji acted opposite Academy Award ‘Best Actor’ recipient Matthew McConaughey in the drama Dallas Buyers Club.\n\nJoji’s extensive Film & TV credits include Hawaii Five-O, My Wife & Kids, ER, 50 First Dates, Baywatch and Godzilla.\n\nTony Young*\n\nTony L. Young graduated from the University of Hawaii in English and Theater. His one-act play, Accumulating Scars won the Kumu Kahua Playwriting Award in 1998. He wrote the independent short films, Kelly Deerdale, Naturist, and Jackie Claxton: Greener Pastures, which respectively screened at the Downtown L.A. Laemmle Theater in 2008 and Claxtonfest in Honolulu in September of 2015. Young is an alumnus of the 2015 Creative Lab in Screenwriting and co-wrote Samurai Cop 2: Deadly Vengeance which has played in independent theaters around the country, in addition to London and Madrid.\n\nVilsoni Hereniko\n\nVilsoni Hereniko is a producer of plays and films as well as a writer and director. He was one of several producers of his first feature film titled THE LAND HAS EYES that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival (2004) and screened at more than thirty international and indigenous film festivals. It won Best Dramatic Feature at the Toronto Imaginenative Film and Media Arts Festival (2004), Best Overall Entry at the Wairoa Maori Film Festival (2005), and was also Fiji’s Official Entry to the 2005 Academy Awards. Last year (2015) he was a producer (as well as writer/director or co-director) of two short narrative films (The Chief’s Speech and Salesi) that screened at the Hawaii International Film Festival.\n\n*Joji Yoshida & Tony Young are producing partners on Sacred Hearts Coven."
