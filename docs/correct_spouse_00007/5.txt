James Bond star Daniel Craig will reportedly marry girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell--as soon as he wraps up filming on his current 007 movie "Quantum of Solace."

The 39-year-old British actor allegedly proposed to his film producer partner during a romantic break in Italy last summer, but the pair have so far refused to confirm their engagement.

However, reports state the couple have been inseparable during filming of the latest superspy venture--with Mitchell allegedly visiting the hunk every day on the movie's set in Panama.

A source tells British tabloid The Sun, "Daniel and Satsuki are so loved-up.‚Äù He asked her to marry him and she's been showing off a very beautiful Cartier ring. It has a large diamond solitaire with a platinum setting.

"Daniel and Satsuki are now stronger than ever. They're planning an intimate ceremony for close family and friends. They make a great couple."

A spokesperson for Craig refused to comment.
