In 2004, Daniel Craig was rumored to be dating Kate Moss.

Kate Moss, born on January 16, 1974, in London, England, is an iconic figure in the world of fashion. Her journey into modeling began at the age of 14 when she was discovered by Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Model Management, at JFK Airport in New York. Despite her unconventional height for a model, standing at just 5'7, her waifish figure and striking features quickly made her one of the most sought-after faces in the industry. Moss's career catapulted to new heights after her collaboration with Calvin Klein in the early 1990s. The black and white images of a young, fresh-faced Moss in the brand's underwear campaign were groundbreaking, introducing a new aesthetic, later termed heroin chic, which starkly contrasted with the voluptuous supermodels of the time. This campaign solidified Moss's status as a global fashion icon and ushered in a new era of modeling. Beyond modeling, Moss has also ventured into the realms of design and business. In 2007, she launched a highly successful clothing line with British retailer Topshop, showcasing her keen fashion sense. This partnership lasted until 2010, but she returned for a one-off collection in 2014. Moreover, Moss established her own talent agency in 2016, named 'Kate Moss Agency', which doesn't only focus on modeling talents but also nurtures emerging actors, singers, and artists. Despite the highs and lows of her personal life being well-documented in the press, Moss remains an enduring symbol of style and continues to have a significant impact on the fashion industry.
