Satsuki Mitchell, the former fiancé of Daniel Craig, may finally be moving on with “Sex and the City” heartthrob Jason Lewis.

Mitchell, a Hollywood producer who was often photographed on the beach with her “James Bond” beau, spent Memorial Day in Hawaii with a new hunk, the blonde-haired and muscle-bound Lewis, best known for playing Smith Jerrod on the HBO series.

Photos show the pair swimming in the ocean together, and walking on the beach. While both Mitchell and Lewis showed off their enviable figures, it was unclear if the pair are friends or more.

Mitchell had dated Craig for seven years and was engaged to the star when they abruptly split in 2010. Reports say that the relationship ended because Craig fell for his co-star in the film “Dream House,” Rachel Weisz. While Weisz was married to “Black Swan” director Darren Aronofsky when filming began, the couple announced their breakup around the same time. Craig and Weisz quietly married in November of 2011.

While Mitchell has not commented on the end of her relationship with Craig, her father told the Daily Mail that she had been sideswiped with the news of his marriage to Weisz.

“His sudden marriage came out of nowhere. We heard about it like everyone else, by reading the newspapers. She doesn’t mention his name now and tells me off if I do,” he said. “Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break-up was the best thing for her. She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship.”

Former model Lewis may perhaps be a better fit for the producer. He has dated Rosario Dawson and Jennifer Esposito, and was linked to Jennifer Aniston in 2007.
