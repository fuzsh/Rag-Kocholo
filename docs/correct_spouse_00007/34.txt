Daniel Craig has sparked rumours that he has married his long-term girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell.

According to numerous reports, the James Bond actor, who has been dating Mitchell for six years, was spotted wearing a gold band on his wedding finger earlier this week.

A source told the Daily Mail: "We all suspect they have got married. He has always said Satsuki is the one but he didnâ€™t want a big showbiz wedding, that would be his worst nightmare. Heâ€™s very private."
