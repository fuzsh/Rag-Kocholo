Craig has a teenage daughter from a previous relationship.\n\nCraig, best known for playing James Bond in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, has Cowboys & Aliens, The Adventures of Tintin and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo in the wings. Weisz, on the other hand, is busy with 360, the untitled Terrence Malick project, along with The Bourne Legacy and Oz: The Great and Powerful."
