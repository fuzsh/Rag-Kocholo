        "text": "British actor Daniel Craig, who recently signed a $60 million deal with MGM to play 007 hero, James Bond at least 3-more-times, has revealed that he is addicted to computer games - much to the disapproval of his producer girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell.\n\nDaniel said: I play games. Hands up. Im quite into ones that have a big fat story line.\n\nHalo is good because its shooting aliens.\n\nThose ultra-violent ones I can play for half-an-hour and then I feel dirty. Vice City, for example - I think, Oh yes, all right, Ive stolen 18 cars. Ive had enough now.\n\nI have to pick my time well. If my girlfriend sees the box then its all over. If I get some free time, when she goes away for the weekend, Ill go and play some games.\n\nI can switch the phone off and not see anybody for a couple of hours. That is blissful. Its just as well I dont have much spare time or I would probably fritter it away playing computer games.\n\nHowever, 39-year-old Craig admits that he wasnt overly keen on being involved in a computer game based on his movie Casino Royale.\n\nHe recalls: When I started signing contracts for Bond I said, Im not doing the computer game and they said, Tough, you are.\n\nI said to the people making the Bond game, Youve got to make this good because there is so much rubbish out there. "
