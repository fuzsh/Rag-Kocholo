        "text": "Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig have come clean about their relationship during a Christmas break\n\nThey have dodged the rumours for the last two months, but it looks like Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig have finally decided to come clean about their relationshipâ€¦\n\nThe couple, who've been linked ever since the actress separated from her director husband earlier this year, were spotted walking hand in hand in the snowy Dorset countryside on Christmas Eve - in a scene that could've come straight out of The Holiday.\n\nTalking to the News of the World, one onlooker blabbed:\n\n\"They were laughing and chatting and hanging on to each other's words and stopping to take photos of each other.\n\n\"They were clinging to each other like honeymooners. The chemistry was obvious.\"\n\nThe pair reportedly grew close while playing husband and wife in the upcoming thriller Dream House, which was shot earlier this year in North America.\n\nDaniel has a teenage daughter with his ex-wife, Fiona Loudon, and is thought to have broke up with his longtime girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell earlier this year. Meanwhile, Rachel confirmed she had split with husband Darren Aronofsky - the father of her four-year-old song Henry - in November."
