        "text": "\"Isn't there an old saying that if you die a rich man, you've failed?\" he said during one of the interviews.\n\nDaniel Craig's fortune is estimated at $160 million, but his daughters will not see them after his death.\n\n\"I think Andrew Carnegie gave away about $11 billion in today's money, which shows how rich he was, because I bet he kept some of it too. But I don't want to leave large sums to the next generation. My philosophy is get rid of it or give it away before you leave,\" he said.\n\nThe actor became a father for the first time in 1992, when Ella was born - the result of his marriage to Fiona Loudon. Nearly three decades later, Rachel Weisz gave birth to another daughter to Craig. Apart from her, they raise Henry together, whose father is director Darren Aronofsky.\n\nALSO READ: Actress battling cancer plans her own funeral as she prepares to die\n\nDaniel Craig - Ex-fiancée's revenge\n\nInterestingly, the Briton was thinking about starting a family with film producer, Satsuki Mitchell, but during their engagement he lost his mind for the aforementioned Weisz. Everyone found out about the affair from the press, including Satsuki herself and her loved ones.\n\n“She's devastated and absolutely stunned,” the abandoned woman's father told the press. She was also amazed at the speed at which her ex-boyfriend formalised their barely fledgling relationship. Especially since she had been with him for six years and he was in no hurry to get married.\n\n\"Now she doesn't mention his name, and if I do, she will definitely scold me. She just got back on her feet. Since then, she has repeatedly said that the breakup was the best thing for her. She knew he wasn't the man she wanted him to be,\" Christopher Mitchell said.\n\nThe betrayed producer, instead of confronting Bond, took his credit card and withdrew $1 million.\n\n*\n\nThis article was originally published on Onet Woman."
