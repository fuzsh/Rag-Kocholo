        "text": "Celebrities spend so much time denying romantic tabloid reports that it seems somewhat bizarre when an actor admits that one of those sudsy, screaming headlines was in fact true. Case in point: Jude Law, who while testifying at the ongoing News Corp. phone hacking trial in London today, described his involvement in a love triangle with Sienna Miller and James Bond actor Daniel Craig.\n\nAccording to the Evening Standard, Law acknowledged that in 2005, he learned that Miller, his then-girlfriend, was having an affair with his Road to Perdition co-star, Craig, in a News of the World story titled “Sienna Cheats on Jude.”\n\nAt the time, Craig was in a relationship with actress Satsuki Mitchell, the jury heard. Law, 41, said he found out about the affair between Miller and Craig shortly after attending the wedding of her sister Savannah in the West Country.\n\nHe said he immediately rang Craig, who was in Baltimore, to question him about it. “No doubt you expressed your views?” asked defence counsel Timothy Langdale QC. “I did, yes,” Law replied. “Did you make any reference to his then-girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell?” asked the QC, who is representing former NoW editor Andy Coulson.\n\nLaw said: “I don’t remember if that was her name, but more than likely yes. We had known each other for many, many years, so the conversation took all sorts of turns.”\n\nMr Langdale asked: “Were you indicating to him that he ought to tell her about this?” Law replied: “Yes, I think that’s correct, I did.”\n\nAs if dredging up such personal details in a public forum does not seem unpleasant enough, the Evening Standard reports that Law was informed during today’s court proceedings that “a member of his immediate family” had been paid by the News of the World for information about the story.” Law also admitted that he was not altogether surprised to hear that his phone had allegedly been tapped. “Sadly, it didn’t surprise me because it seemed apparent from what had been written [in the press]. . . I became aware that I was also turning up at places having arranged to go there secretly . . . and the media were already there, or photographers were already there.”\n\nPolitics\n\nHow Donald Trump Echoes Joe McCarthy\n\nMy grandfather was jailed in the Red Scare of the 1950s.
