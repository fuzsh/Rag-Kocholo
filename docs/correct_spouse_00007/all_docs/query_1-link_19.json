        "text": "Daniel Craig. | Daniel Craig and his daughter Ella Loudon. | Source: Instagram.com/Ella Loudon. | Getty Images\n\nDaniel Craig said fatherhood was the most wonderful thing to ever happen to him.\n\nCraig and his wife, Rache Weisz, had a secret wedding after 17 years of their 1st meeting.\n\nCraig's daughter, Ella Loudon, said she is a \"nightmare\" to her father\n\nActor Daniel Craig was awarded Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on Tuesday, the same award his character, Jame Bond, received.\n\nThe Royal Princess led the honorary ceremony in the investiture at Windsor Castle as an appreciation for his contribution to film and theatre.\n\nCraig was part of the James Bond franchise from 2006 and ended his reign in 2021 with \"No Time to Die.\" The royal family shared a picture of Craig receiving his honor from Princess Anne and captioned it with the famous James Bond line, \"We've been expecting you.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that Craig is celebrated and known for his acting, but his personal life has been kept private. The \"No Time to Die\" star married his first wife, Fiona Loudon, in 1992.\n\nCraig was 23 and had just finished his studies and the National Youth Theatre in London when they welcomed their daughter Ella Loudon, reported Mirror.\n\nHowever, the couple divorced two years later, in 1994. The \"Spectre\" star opened you about his shot lived marriage and confessed that he was too young to get married.\n\nBut he also said he does not regret his decision because he came out of it as a father. Craig even described fatherhood as \"the most wonderful thing that'll ever happen to you.\"\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz's Love Story\n\nAfter the end of his first marriage, Craig was in a few long-term relationships and came close to tying the knot, but it did not happen until he met the right one.\n\nDaniel Craig greeting Satsuke Mitchell while with his daughter Ella Loudon in New York 2010. | Source: Getty Images\n\nAccording to The Things, Craig shortly dated German actor Heike Makatsch. When that ended, the actor started a relationship with film producer Satsuki Mitchell.\n\nMitchell and Craig were together for seven years and engaged for three years when the \"Sky Fall\" actor reportedly left her for Rachel Weisz.\n\nBefore Craig and Weisz were romantically involved, they had already known each other for many years. The couple started their acting careers around the same time, and first met at the theater production of Les Grandes Horizontales in 1994.\n\nRachel Weisz with her former partner Darren Aronofsky in New York in 2006. | Source: Getty Images\n\nBut they remained friends. Weisz was involved with the famous director Darren Aronofsky in 2001. They were engaged in 2005 and welcomed a son, Henry, but the relationship ended in 2010, reported The Things.\n\nAccording to The Things, Craig and Weisz became a couple while shooting a film called \"Dream House\" in 2010. Craig was reportedly still involved with his fiance Mitchell but reports state that the actor did not break up with Mitchell; instead, he stopped going home.\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz at the Golden Globes in Beverly Hills in 2013. | Source: Getty Images\n\nBut despite the controversy that surrounded their relationship, Craig and Weisz started dating and have been together ever since.\n\nAfter only six months of dating, the couple tied the knot in 2011 with only four guests in attendance, stated Express Uk. Something unexpected from two famous actors.\n\nLoudon and Weisz's son Henry was there, and two other guests were witnesses. In 2018 the actors welcomed their first child together, but the name has not been revealed.\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in London 2015. | Source: Getty Images\n\nCraig and Weisz do their best to keep their personal lives private. \"The Black Widow\" actress said it was because her husband was too famous and having a public relationship would be a \"betrayal.\" \"You have to protect your marriage,\" she said.\n\nDaniel Craig's Daughter Said She's Her Father's Nightmare\n\nCraig and his 28-year-old daughter seem close, even though Loudon described herself as her father's nightmare in one Instagram post.\n\nThe father and daughter often show up to red-carpet events together. They attended the \"No Time to Die\" premier, and Loudon wore a strong black suit while Craig rocked a pink suede jacket.\n\nDaniel Craig and Ella Loudon in London 2021. | Source: Getty Images\n\nLoudon also seems to have close relationships with her father's partners, even when they have separated. She posted an Instagram story of her and Mitchell and a screenshot of her trying to facetime her.\n\nMitchell has been separated from Craig for over ten years, but the producer's father said she did not take the break up well. After Craig secretly married Weisz, Mitchell's father, Christopher said it was a surprise to him and his family.\n\nHe also revealed that his daughter stopped mentioning Craig's name; if anyone else did, Christopher said she would tell them off. But now Mitchell is said to have found her happiness and is grateful that her relationship with Craig ended.\n\nBefore Loudon started sharing a bit of her life on Instagram, her childhood was kept private. Loudon started developing an interest in acting at 11 when she appeared in a school production called \"Bugsy Malone,\" reported The List.\n\nThe upcoming actress moved to a boarding school in the United States and went on to study acting at New York University (NYU).\n\nHowever, Loudon dropped out of NYU after a year and confessed that she struggled with depression. But the 28-year-old found her path and has been part of many theatre productions.\n\nLoudon announced on her Instagram that she would be playing in the all-female production of Othello in Arizona. Besides her talent for acting, Loudon is also an artist and shares some of her work on social media. To seal it all off, she also works as a model.\n\nWhile fans love to see what the artist shares on her Instagram, some posts might get her in trouble with her father, who is very private about his life.\n\nLoudon caused an internet frenzy when she posted a picture of a gingerbread house she decorated with her family's names, Rachel, Daniel, Henry, Ella, and one unknown name, Grace. The actress is suspected of accidentally revealing Craig and Weisz's daughter's name, but nothing has been confirmed.\n\nWith two daughters and an estimated worth of 116 million pounds, Craig revealed that he doesn't believe in the concept of inheritance and finds it \"quite distasteful.\"\n\nSo Craig said he will not be leaving his children with a massive sum of money if anything happened to him. Instead, the actor said he would get rid of it before he died.\n\nncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwb2xhZ3qvsdalsGagn6O8s7HDZpuappmauW6v0ZqgoGWYlsBuusign62lkaeyb7TTpqM%3D"
