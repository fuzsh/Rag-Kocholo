        "text": "Actor Jude Law was \"mistaken\" in saying he never left a \"threatening\" voicemail for Daniel Craig when he learned of an affair with his then-girlfriend Sienna Miller, the hacking trial has heard.\n\nFormer News of the World reporter Dan Evans insisted a line in a draft story quoting Law as saying \"Worry about your own girlfriend, pal\" was a paraphrasing of what he told the Bond star in the angry phone message that he hacked.\n\nOn Monday, Law told the Old Bailey trial he confronted his long-time friend over the phone from Baltimore, but not in a message.\n\nQuestioned about the discrepancy, Evans said: \"I would say Mr Law is mistaken. Is it beyond the realms of possibility he left a voicemail and Daniel Craig rang him back? He did. I heard it, hence why you have got that quote in the story.\"\n\nHe said the \"threatening message\" on the voicemail saying \"Hey mate, hope Saskie (Craig's then girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell) does not find out\" had \"inspired\" the quote he later wrote for the newspaper.\n\nHe added: \"Hey, this is tabloid news. What can I say?\"\n\nEvans, who admits hacking at the News of the World, claims his previous editor Andy Coulson knew about his hacking activities and part of the Miller story was produced from the hacked message.\n\nOn his fifth day in the witness box at the Old Bailey, Evans was being cross-examined by Coulson's lawyer Timothy Langdale QC.\n\nThe trial heard a series of emails between other staff at the News of the World, including Coulson (pictured above. Credit: Reuters), discussing information from two sources close to Law talking to another journalist.\n\nTranscripts from interviews read to the court exposed information from the sources described as One and Two.\n\nSource One told the News of the World that he first saw Miller with Craig at the London restaurant, The Ivy, and Miller was \"panicking\" that the press would make something out of it.\n\nThe second time, Source One said they were at a house in Notting Hill. Craig left and drove off while Miller hid behind the door, the court heard.\n\nSource Two told the newspaper that Miller was just \"keeping Jude dangling\" while \"going onto her next victim\".\n\nSource Two claimed that Miller was \"clingy\" and a bit of a \"stalker\" so would call both Law and Craig several times an hour.\n\nThe source said: \"They (Miller and Craig) are constantly on the phone with each other. She is always texting and ringing.\"\n\nThe source asked a News of the World journalist if he had access to their phones, and the response was \"No, no, no, that would be illegal,\" Langdale said.\n\nThe source told the News of the World journalist that Miller had moved out and \"fled the country\", adding: \"She not a nice girl, she's not a goody two shoes.\"\n\nThe source goes on to suggest that Law wanted the story about the split back- dated to look like Miller \"cheated first\".\n\nLangdale put it to Evans that the information came from these sources, not a voicemail, but the witness disagreed.\n\nLater, Evans admitted he hacked into supermodel Kate Moss's phone and listened to an apparent profession of love from Bond actor Craig.\n\nThe former tabloid journalist admitted intercepting a message from Craig while working at the Sunday Mirror.\n\nThe message, according to Langdale said: \"I love you, I love you, I love you,\" the Old Bailey heard.\n\nEvans denied that that message could have been mixed up in his mind with the Sienna Miller affair, saying they were \"two completely separate events\".\n\nThe court heard that Evans has already admitted conspiracy to hack phones at the Sunday Mirror between February 2003 and January 2005, and the same offence at the News of the World between April 2004 and June 2010.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office between January 2008 and June 2010, and perverting the course of justice by giving a false statement in High Court proceedings.\n\nFormer News of the World editor Andy Coulson 46, a PR consultant of Charing, Kent, denies conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.\n\nAll seven defendants, including former Sun and NotW editor Rebekah Brooks, deny all the charges against them."
