        "text": "Fingers crossed she has better luck with Johns.\n\nMake it a Malcolm\n\nOur new Prime Minister takes his appearance very seriously: just don't ever mention love handles to him.\n\nFrom his leather jackets, sharp suits and on-trend pocket squares, Malcolm Turnbull even graced the cover of men's style bible GQ back in April, which celebrated him as being the fashion plate of Canberra.\n\nBut don't be fooled, while he may have the money to afford the very best, when it comes to the silver thatch on his head, it's economy all the way.\n\n\"People come in and ask for Malcolm,\" Rose Bay barber Brian Kandakji told PS this week.\n\n\"He is a very good customer, he comes in for a medium back and sides, with a side part. It's the same cut he's been getting for the past five years, we finish it off with a bit of Matt Wax, nothing too fussy. I charge him $25 ... but he's a very generous tipper, and a very gracious man.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows him around here, he comes in and asks how long the wait will be, and he patiently waits his turn doing a few emails. When people offer to let him go ahead of them, he politely declines and stays in the queue ... he is a real gentleman.\"\n\nSome years ago PS was cornered by Turnbull at a fundraising night he and his wife, Lucy, were hosting inside their grand mock-Tuscan-style villa overlooking Sydney Harbour.\n\nIn those days it was a more full-figured Turnbull who took issue with an article I had written suggesting he was sporting love handles in his Speedos down at Bondi Icebergs.\n\nBut all that changed in 2012 when Turnbull lost 14 kilograms thanks to the wondrous work of Bondi Junction herbalist Shuquan Liu, who says his potions are not about weight loss but rather making the body's internal organs work better.\n\nThose embarking on the program say they have virtually no appetite, which allows them to drop weight very quickly.\n\nThe treatment does not come cheap, with some customers paying about $2000 a week, or roughly $1000 per kilo of weight lost.\n\nTurnbull said at the time: \"I must say that I found the fast extremely informative because it made me realise I am in control of my own body and can control my appetite. It is a very good insight.\"\n\nTony Abbott's Riverview class of '75 gather at Kirribilli House for reunion\n\nTiming is everything in politics, though Tony Abbott's has definitely been a little off this week.\n\nOn Friday night, Abbott's Riverview class of '75 alumni gathered in Kirribilli for their 40th anniversary reunion, which has been in the planning stages for months.\n\nPS understands it was all very covert, with the group of 50-something \"Old Ignatians\" told to meet at the local pub before being ushered to a not-so-very-surprising venue: the Prime Minister's lodgings at Kirribilli House.\n\nIndeed, it turned out to be Tone's last big hurrah.\n\nOn Friday night, confusion reigned as some guests were told they were being bussed to a secret waterfront location.\n\nWith Monday night's leadership challenge seeing Abbott out of the big gig, organisers were frantically trying to work out what to do, but all were assured that the the party would continue as planned, despite Margie Abbott photographed packing up the family's Tupperware in preparation for eviction and their return to Forestville.\n\nSadly PS has no further details or photos from the soiree as guests were asked to hand in their phones and cameras on arrival, though Malcolm Turnbull may well have had his binoculars out from across the harbour.\n\nMeanwhile, you could hear the sigh of relief eminating from Madam Tussauds Sydney branch on Monday night, which was just about to sign off on a new $300,000 wax effigy of Abbott.\n\nGiven the high turnover of PMs over the past few years, the wax museum has been holding off on commissioning the Abbott, which would have taken about six months to create. Wise move.\n\nRupert rumour the best of the year\n\nLet us all pray to the gossip gods that this one is true, because it is probably the best romance rumour of the year ... even better than James Packer and Mariah Carey.\n\nWord out of London claims that Rupert Murdoch has a very glamorous, very famous and very blonde new woman in his life ... JERRY HALL!\n\nMobile phones went into meltdown when PS started calling up some of Rupert's nearest and dearest in an attempt to shed any light on the tittle-tattle this week.\n\nResponses ranged from loud squeals of \"faaaaaaaaaaaaaaabulous\" to a rather droll \"f--- me, if she thought Mick Jagger was a handful, she's in for a surprise\".\n\nThe rumour first appeared on the London-based showbiz website Popbitch, which while not at the top of the list when it comes to venerable media outlets, has a reputation for getting things correct. Well mostly.\n\nIt published an item under the rather unkind headline: Gruesome Twosome.\n\nShe told London's Mirror: \"I don't get propositioned by anybody as much as I used to ... Actually I don't think you'd need to get married, it's the company that would be nice.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to companies, they don't get much more impressive than Rupert's right?\n\nREAL ESTATE GENIUS TOUCHING DOWN\n\nIt would seem to be a case of bringing ice to Eskimos, but spruiker Max Markson is adamant that one of the world's most famous real estate agents could teach his Sydney peers a thing or two. Star of Million Dollar Listing New York, Fredrik Eklund is doing a series of live workshops across Australia in October, promising to share \"the secrets of selling anything to anyone\". He's reputedly sold over $5 billion in real estate in New York during the past decade, with a clientele that includes Sarah Jessica Parker, Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Justin Timberlake and Daniel Craig. Eat your heart out John McGrath.\n\nSUNRISE TEAM MADE UP ABOUT RATINGS\n\nSlumming by the emergency exit door which had been turned into a makeshift makeup room, and with minutes to spare between touching down in New York and going on air, you had to feel a little sorry for Sunrise make-up artist Garry Siutz. He had been tasked with getting Samantha Armytage and Natalie Barr camera ready across five different countries in five different days. Clearly, he worked miracles with his brush (which PS hears is made from mink) to hide the wear-and-tear the ladies and the rest of the Sunrise gang were enduring. But it was worth it, with executive producer Michael Pell claiming victory in the ratings this week and Sunrise maintaining its lead on Channel Nine's Today â€“ even on Tuesday, with Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hosting one of the most fascinating mornings of breakfast television on the lawns of Parliament House. Armytage and David Koch beat the odds, and managed to keep up all the way from a pitch-black London."
