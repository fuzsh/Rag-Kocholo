        "text": "Over the years, James Bond has established himself as one of the most prominent characters, with most women wanting to play Bond Girl. Just like James Bond, Daniel Craig, who played the role of The Bond, has also amassed a large fan following, with many women wanting to marry him.\n\nBond is known as a womanizer, but what about Daniel? Is he the same as the character he plays in the film? Well, certainly not looking at his marriage to Rachel Weisz. The private couple has been together for some time now. So, let's learn a bit about their relationship.\n\nHe Has Been Married To Rachel Weisz For A Long Time\n\nThe one thing Daniel Craig carries from his Bond character in real life is his looks. No surprise there since he played the role of the best British Spy. But when it comes to women and relationships, he is the polar opposite of what he is usually known for in movies. He has been with one woman for many years now. And her name is Rachel Weisz.\n\nThe romantic couple got married on July 2011. Hardly anyone knew when it happened. You can tell their wedding was private as mere four people attended it. They didn't keep each other waiting for too long, as the private couple wore their wedding ring only six months after dating each other. In what sounds like they rushed things to get married on paper, it is nothing less than a miracle that their marriage has lasted this long.\n\nDaniel & Rachel Have Known Each Other Since College\n\nThough they started developing feelings for each other much later, Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have known each other since college. They were at the same University.\n\nThey were friends and maintained a good relationship before developing a fondness for one another. Unfortunately, we don't have any information regarding their time at the University. It probably didn't surprise you knowing how private these two keep their lives.\n\nHas A Daughter\n\nThe Knives Out actor Daniel shares a daughter with his wife, Rachel. However, much like their lives, their daughter's identity is also kept a secret.\n\nNot much is known about their secret daughter apart from the fact that she was born in 2018. Their daughter is still young, and they probably don't want to expose her to the media. But paparazzi have managed to find them with their daughter on a few occasions.\n\nRachel Weisz Was Previously Married To Darren Aronofsky\n\nDaniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have a marriage that many envies they would have. In an ideal scenario, you would see yourself falling in love with one partner and then marrying them, marrying and living with them for the rest of your life. Their marriage might be going well, but this isn't the first time they have fallen in love. Both of them used to be with someone else.\n\nRachel was with film director Darren Aronofsky before Quantum of Solace actor. The two were never married but were engaged for more than four years, and they had known each other for the past nine years. The two ended things on November 2010. They had a son from their relationship.\n\nDaniel Was Previously Married To Fionna Loudon\n\nRachel's husband, Daniel, was previously married to actress Fionna Loudon. And, unlike her relationship with Darren, these two were married. The two tied the knot in 1992, just a year after the news of their being together. As we all know, their wedding didn't work. Their marriage journey was short-lived, as they ended things less than three years later in 1994.\n\nWe have no way of finding out what happened between the two, but it looks like they didn't end things on good terms, and Fionna must have been hurt. I say this as after her divorce from Layer Cake actor; she decided never to marry again and instead focused on raising their daughter Ella. I guess that explains why Ella goes by her mother's surname.\n\nHis Engagement With Satsuki Mitchell\n\nFionna is not the only past relationship with Daniel that is out for the public. Daniel was also engaged to a woman named Satsuki Mitchell.\n\nThough they were never married, these two were engaged for a long time. They were engaged from 2007 till 2010. Much like his relationship with Fionna, it seems like things with Satsuki also ended on bad terms, as she has said she is happy that she is no longer with the James Bond actor.\n\nKids From Their Previous Marriage (Ella and Henry)\n\nDaniel and Rachel have a beautiful daughter from their relationship, but she isn't their only child. Both of them bring kids from their previous marriage. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo actor Daniel gets a daughter Ella Loudon, and Constantine actress Rachel brings a son named Henry Aronofsky.\n\nHenry is the son of Rachel and a film director, Darren Aronofsky. He was born on May 31, 2006, in New York. Henry, much like Rachel, lives a quiet life.\n\nElla is the daughter of Daniel and Scottish actress Fionna Loudon. The two were blessed with Ella on November 20, 1992. Ella, much like her parents, also lives a quiet life. However, she is present in the media. Like her parents, she has also chosen to make a career in the entertainment industry and currently works as an actress and a model.\n\nElla Loudon Relationship Status (She Used To Date Ben Hill)\n\nDaniel Craig has had a lot of love stories for the fans to learn. But what about his daughter Ella Loudon? What is her relationship status?\n\nAt the time of this writing, Ella is a single woman. But she had a man in her life in the past. She used to date Calvin Klien model Ben Hill. There isn't much known about their relationship as they haven't disclosed much. Some sources suggest that she ended things with him in 2021.\n\nThe Infamous Jude Law Sienna Miller Story\n\nDaniel may avoid the media and avoid controversies as much as he can. People will never forget the infamous love triangle between him, Sienna Miller, and Jude Law.\n\nThis story which journalist Dan Evans exposed, starts with the infamous voicemail from Sienna. The hacked message revealed something suspicious. She had sent a voicemail to Daniel's phone, and at some point, one line in that message said I love You. The reason why this made the news is that she was dating actor Jude Law at the time.\n\nJulie Miller from Vanity Fair reports that the story was only cleared when Jude said Sienna cheated on him with Daniel. This stain will never leave Daniel, and people will constantly be reminded of it.\n\nCheck Out MarriedCeleb for more exciting celebrity bios\n\nncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jrCfnqqVYra0ecOapaKdnGKws63IoGSnp6dirq%2BwjJ2Yrp%2BYqbKzecSlo5o%3D\n\nShare!"
