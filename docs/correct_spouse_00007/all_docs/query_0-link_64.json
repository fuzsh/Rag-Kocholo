He celebrated his 54th birthday in 2022.\n\nDaniel was born in Chester, Cheshire. He was the son of art teacher Carol Olivia (née Williams) and Timothy John Wroughton Craig (1943–2020), a midshipman in the Merchant Navy and steel erector.\n\nHe also has an older sister named Lea (born 1965).\n\nHis middle name, Wroughton, comes from his great-great-grandmother, Grace Matilda Wroughton.\n\nAfter his parents divorced in 1972, he and his sister moved to the Wirral Peninsula with their mother.\n\nWho is Daniel Craig's wife and how many children does he have?\n\nIn 1992, Daniel Craig married actress Fiona Loudon.\n\nThey had a daughter named Ella, before divorcing in 1994.\n\nHe was engaged to film producer Satsuki Mitchell from 2005 until 2010.\n\nDaniel had known actress Rachel Weisz since working together on Les Grandes Horizontales in 1994. They began dating in late 2010, and were married in a private ceremony in New York City the following summer, with only four guests in attendance, including Craig's daughter and Weisz's son.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that their first child together, a daughter, had been born. Her name is thought to be Grace."
