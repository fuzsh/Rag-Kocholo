Born on December 28, 1981, in New York City, Miller moved to London with her family when she was just a year old. With a passion for the arts ignited at an early age, she studied at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute in New York before making her acting debut in 2001. Miller's breakthrough came in 2004 with her role as Nikki in the romantic comedy film Alfie. Her performance earned her a nomination for a British Academy Film Award (BAFTA). From there, her career took off, and she was cast in notable films such as Layer Cake, Factory Girl, where she portrayed Edie Sedgwick, and American Sniper. She received a nomination for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actress for her role in the television drama series The Girl in 2012. In addition to her acting career, Miller has also made a significant impact in the fashion industry. In 2007, she launched a fashion label called \"Twenty8Twelve\" alongside her sister, Savannah. The brand, named after Miller's birth date, was widely acclaimed for its bohemian chic style. Despite stepping away from the fashion business in 2012, Miller's influence on the industry remains undeniable. Throughout her career, Sienna Miller has proven herself to be a versatile talent, leaving an indelible mark both on the silver screen and the world of fashion.\n\nAge : 42\n\nBirthplace : New York, New York, USA\n\nIn 2004, Daniel Craig was rumored to be dating Kate Moss.\n\nKate Moss, born on January 16, 1974, in London, England, is an iconic figure in the world of fashion. Her journey into modeling began at the age of 14 when she was discovered by Sarah Doukas, founder of Storm Model Management, at JFK Airport in New York. Despite her unconventional height for a model, standing at just 5'7, her waifish figure and striking features quickly made her one of the most sought-after faces in the industry. Moss's career catapulted to new heights after her collaboration with Calvin Klein in the early 1990s. The black and white images of a young, fresh-faced Moss in the brand's underwear campaign were groundbreaking, introducing a new aesthetic, later termed heroin chic, which starkly contrasted with the voluptuous supermodels of the time. This campaign solidified Moss's status as a global fashion icon and ushered in a new era of modeling. Beyond modeling, Moss has also ventured into the realms of design and business. In 2007, she launched a highly successful clothing line with British retailer Topshop, showcasing her keen fashion sense. This partnership lasted until 2010, but she returned for a one-off collection in 2014. Moreover, Moss established her own talent agency in 2016, named 'Kate Moss Agency', which doesn't only focus on modeling talents but also nurtures emerging actors, singers, and artists. Despite the highs and lows of her personal life being well-documented in the press, Moss remains an enduring symbol of style and continues to have a significant impact on the fashion industry.\n\nAge : 50\n\nBirthplace : Croydon, England, London\n\nAfter filming Obsession together, Daniel Craig started dating Heike Makatsch from 1997 to 2004.\n\nHeike Makatsch (born 13 August 1971) is a German actress and singer.
