        "text": "Daniel Craig's shock wedding has left the family of his ex-girlfriend floored.\n\nThe James Bond star married fellow Brit Rachel Weisz in New York last month, and the nuptials that stunned Hollywood also served up a huge surprise for the actor's ex-fiancee Satsuki Mitchell and her folks.\n\nHer father Christopher Mitchell has opened up to Britain's Daily Mail, explaining his daughter has forbidden family members from mentioning Craig's name.\n\n\"His sudden marriage came out of nowhere. We heard about it like everyone else - by reading the newspapers. She doesn't mention his name now and tells me off if I do,\" he says.\n\n\"Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break-up was the best thing for her.\n\n\"She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship.\"\n\nMitchell, 32, and Craig, 43, became engaged in 2007. They split in November last year.\n\nAlso in November, Weisz announced her separation from film director husband Darren Aronofsky, with whom she has a five-year-old son, Henry."
