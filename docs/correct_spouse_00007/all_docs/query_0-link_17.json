        "text": "The best advice he ever got: “I got a piece of advice a long time ago. Declan Donnellan [legendary British theatre director, co-founder of Cheek By Jowl] gave me and a roomful of other acting students this piece of advice. He said, ‘You can’t get bitter. You can’t get bitter about what might have been.’ Well I know it’s easy for me to say. But hand on heart, going into my third year of drama school, and the s*** was hitting the fan and people were trying to get agents and competing really nastily with each other, well not nastily, but desperately, I was [he shrugs his shoulders] not bothered. And every time I’ve failed to replicate that,” he continues, “then s*** has started to go wrong. I never want to know who went up for the part. I never want to know who my agent’s other clients are. I never want to know what they’re doing, how they’re doing. I do not give a s***. As soon as you start doing that, you start questioning your own existence, questioning why you don’t have this and that, and it destroys you. The grass is always greener. There’s always going to be someone with a bigger toy than yours.”\n\nHe knows he’s awful on talk shows: “It’s a thankless task being a talk-show host,” he reasons, almost sympathetically. “Especially if you have to do a show every day. I look at these guys over here – Letterman, Leno. Whatever you think of them – and they’re not shows I tune into – but you look at them and you think, you earn your money. It’s a lot of money, but you earn it. Sometimes they get guests like me. [Adopts upbeat voice] ‘So, how are you?’ [Switches to surly teenager] ‘All right.’ Actually I did it recently for Cowboys & Aliens, and I kind of relaxed about it a bit more. Say less, laugh more. Laugh at every joke. I was a bit more chilled about it. I don’t care.”\n\nHe doesn’t want to try to revamp his grumpy persona: “But the only way to get round that would be to go out and do a huge PR thing. No, no, look at me. I’m really funny. And that would be terrible. Whatever happens has to happen nat­urally and I’m not going to go out there and compensate for something because there’s an opinion about me. There’s no point. It’s just not the way I’m constructed. I think it would show me up in a worse light. ‘Oh look, he’s trying to make us like him now. What a c***!’”\n\nHe got new tattoos when he married Rachel: He sports a pair of tattoos, now, on his inner biceps that may or may not have some connection with his new wife. On his right arm are words, on the left a symbol. “They are,” he points out, somewhat superfluously, “mine. They’re two very personal tattoos.” They look new. “Yes, they are. They’re just part of a stage I’m in,” he laughs. “You should see the rest of my body. Then you’d be intrigued. Oh boy. It’s been a very complicated couple of years.” He’s joking, but he won’t elaborate."
