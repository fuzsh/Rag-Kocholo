        "text": "Daniel Craig married Rachel Weisz in a small, intimate ceremony this summer. Because the famous couple wanted its privacy? Perhaps.\n\nBut also because the actor may not have wanted the public to learn of how his relationship with the actress started.\n\nAccording to an In Touch Weekly source, Craig left the home he shared with long-time girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell one morning, headed for the set of Dream House – the film in which he co-stars with Weisz – and simply didn’t return.\n\n“Satsuki was frantically calling, texting and emailing him, but he was probably with Rachel and not answering,” the insider says.\n\nHow did Mitchell respond? She reportedly went all Blu Cantrell on Craig, racking up approximately $1 million in charges on his credit card. And with the bombing of Cowboys & Aliens, that’s money the actor could really use!\n\n[Photo: WENN.com]"
