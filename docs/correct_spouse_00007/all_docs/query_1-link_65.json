Moore was married and had kids during his tenure... can you visualize him as James Bond ?\n\nGoing by these rules: no.\n\nWell Craig is already a father before he became Bond and is now a step-dad to Rachel's kid, I can see your points and no doubt Babs will be downing a scotch or two but I think it really won't affect his image as Bond, well not in anyone's mind who can separate the character on screen and the actor in real life.\n\nBut as Rachel went out with Mendes years ago and according to a few he still carried a torch for her, I hope those dynamics won't get in the way of a decent film.\n\nNo pouting and throwing toys out of the sandbox and all that.\n\nYes it's all good stuff, no rubbish here. :>\n\nM won't like this!\n\nJust wait for Blofeld's guest \"appearance\" lol\n\nFunny OHMSS reference alright, but the \"guest appearance' happened in the FYEO PTS :-)) I do believe Ernst Stavro may be on permanent vacation...\n\nAnyway, great news and congrats as well to the happy couple. A lot of women, including quite a few famous ones, have apparently had their hopes of being Mrs. Craig dashed. Good for him and too bad. I think it's just crazy to think people won't go to see his films or that he's lost any mystique as a result. Where did it ever say that the actor who played Bond had to BE Bond??? Nonsense. I am one of those who hopes Rachel gets a role, as I've said she'd be a great Quantum villainess.\n\nDamn you Craig, you bet me to her! Ah well, congratulations I guess (sighs). ;-)\n\nSeriously though, Craig did well not getting hitched until he reached his 40's. He was a free man for longer. That's the way to do it.\n\nI'd like to see the beautiful Weisz in a Bond film before she gets to old. She does look good for a 41 year old woman.\n\nDamn you Craig, you bet me to her!

Prior to their relationship I thought she would have been great and was at the top of my list for potential Bond girls - great actress, amazingly beautiful, and more age-appropriate than some 25 year old (although Eva Green had a presence and confidence that made me think the actress was in her early 30s).\n\nOh, Craig got married in his twenties? Maybe he learnt his lesson and decided to hold off getting whipped and kept in the proverbial cage again until he reached his 40's. ;-)\n\nNot that I have any interest in what is going on in celebrities personal lives but it would be an interesting character study to know why Craig and Mitchell were actually engaged for 5 years. That's quite a while.\n\nWeisz has a refined, elegant look about her. She should be a Bond dame. Maybe a bad girl who Craig has to kill at the end.\n\nNot that I have any interest in what is going on in celebrities personal lives but it would be an interesting character study to know why Craig and Mitchell were actually engaged for 5 years. That's quite a while.\n\nI don't believe they were engaged for that amount of time, just together. Their engagement was in 2009, I think.\n\n.....I meant that Daniel Craig was single when he started out as James Bond...that's all....all the other Bonds \"are\" married but he was the new one and he was \"single\"....I like the real thing....but then .... \"whats real\".......dont have a cow limey.....\n\nActors have a regular life. I don't know what you're on about not having mystique since he's no longer single. Being married in real life in no parts makes him less qualified to play a bachelor in a flick."
