        "text": "(BANG) -\n\nDaniel Craig's former fiancee has banned anyone from mentioning him in her presence.\n\nThe James Bond star split from Satsuki Mitchell - who he got engaged to in 2007 - last November, and she was stunned to learn he had married actress Rachel Weisz in a secret ceremony last month following a whirlwind romance.\n\nSatsuki's father, Christopher Mitchell, said: 'His sudden marriage came out of nowhere. We heard about it like everyone else, by reading the newspapers. She doesn't mention his name now and tells me off if I do.'\n\nAccording to Christopher, Satsuki had realised their relationship would never have worked out but had only just begun to get over her split from 43-year-old Daniel when the news broke about his marriage.\n\nHe told the Daily Mail newspaper: 'Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break up was the best thing for her.\n\n'She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship.'\n\nChristopher is worried about the impact Daniel's marriage will have on his daughter because he became concerned she had developed an eating disorder when they split up last year.\n\nHe said: 'I have suggested to her on a number of occasions that she might have a disorder. Yet whenever we're together she eats like a horse.'\n\nDaniel and Rachel - who first went public with their romance in December when they spent Christmas together at a cottage in the English countryside - tied the knot in front of just four people, the actor's daughter Ella, 18, the actress' four-year-old son Henry and two friends at a pal's house in New York state.\n\nRachel, 40, split from Henry's father, Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky last year, announcing in November they had been separated for some time but remained 'close'.\n\nThe couple star together in upcoming horror movie Dream House - to be released in September 2011 - which they shot throughout 2010.\n\n(C) BANG Media International"
