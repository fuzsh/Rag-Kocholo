        "text": "Daniel Craig is best known for playing the womanising super suave spy James Bond, but in real-life, these days the British actor is a dedicated family man.\n\nFans of the 53-year-old star swooned when he brought along his daughter, Ella Loudon, to the recent premiere of No Time to Die, and proudly posed alongside the budding actress as he celebrated his final outing as 007.\n\nElla, 29, looks uncannily like her famous father, but fans were confused over her identity, as Daniel rarely discusses his private life.\n\nDespite being married to fellow Hollywood star Rachel Weisz, and helming one of the biggest movie franchises in the world, Daniel has managed to keep his personal life under wraps.\n\nHere, we take a deep dive into the actor’s dating history, including his reported relationship with a famous supermodel, and his whirlwind romance with an Oscar-winning actress.\n\nFirst-time father\n\nFresh from studying at the National Youth Theatre in London, Daniel became a father for the first time at the age of 23, after a romance with Scottish actress Fiona Loudon.\n\nThey met in 1992, and soon became parents to daughter Ella, but after getting married the pair decided to go their separate ways.\n\nThe actor previously spoke about his short lived first marriage, admitting he was “too young” to tie the knot, but doesn’t regret their relationship, because it made him a father.\n\nHe described being a dad as “the most wonderful thing that’ll ever happen to you”.\n\nLove, actually\n\nAfter splitting from his first wife Fiona, Daniel began dating German actress Heike Makatsch, who is perhaps best known for her role in the 2003 romantic comedy Love, Actually.\n\nHeike played seductress Mia, who embarked on an affair with Alan Rickman’s character Harry, and their relationship culminated in his wife Karen discovering their illicit romance in heartbreaking scenes.\n\nDaniel and Heike dated for seven years, even attending film premieres together, but they sadly split, blaming work commitments that kept them apart for long periods.\n\n\"Film sets have caused a lot of break-ups; marriages go down the tubes. It’s bloody lonely,” Daniel reflected.\n\nSupermodel romance?\n\nAfter his break-up from Heike, Daniel was rumoured to be dating supermodel Kate Moss, but he quickly shot down the reports, despite the pair being spotted together on a night out, and leaving a restaurant together.\n\nHe was then rumoured to have had fling with his Layer Cake co-star Sienna Miller while she was dating Jude Law.\n\nDaniel and Sienna denied the rumours and during the News Corp. phone hacking trial in 2014, the actress described her relationship with her co-star who she described as her 'best friend.'\n\nSienna was giving evidence when she told the court: “Whether or not I was in a relationship with Daniel Craig at the time, it was a very brief encounter.”\n\nBitter break-up\n\nBack in 2005, Daniel met Hollywood producer Satsuki Mitchell, while on the set of the 2005 film The Jacket.\n\nHe popped the question in 2007, and Satsuki was said to have helped Daniel deal with the intense pressures of superstardom after he made his debut as super spy James Bond in 2006.\n\nThen, in 2010, he flew to Canada to film the movie Dream House with his old friend and fellow Brit, Rachel Weisz.\n\nDaniel and Rachel, who attended university together, were reunited as they played husband and wife in the critically panned thriller.\n\nShortly after filming ended, Rachel called off her relationship with director Darren Aronofsky - who is the father of her son Henry - while Daniel broke off his engagement to a heartbroken Satsuki.\n\nIn June 2011, the couple broke the news that they had married in an intimate ceremony.\n\nSatsuki’s father, Henry Mitchell, told the Daily Mail his daughter found out about the shock nuptials in the newspapers.\n\n“She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship,” he fired, claiming that Satsuki’s romance with Daniel began to deteriorate when they were house-hunting in New York in 2010.\n\nThe love of his life\n\nDaniel and Rachel’s wedding was announced in a brief statement issued by their publicist, who confirmed the stars had married in an intimate ceremony attended by their children - Rachel’s son Henry, and Daniel's daughter Ella.\n\n\"We did it privately and we've got a lot of people to thank for that… The whole point is that it was a secret. A secret is a secret,” the actor told GQ magazine in 2015.\n\nThe Mummy star Rachel was also keen to keep their nuptials private, but she confessed she wasn’t a fan of marriage, and was only convinced after meeting Daniel.\n\n\"I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine… Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment,” she told The Evening Standard Magazine in 2018.\n\nAnd baby makes five!\n\nDaniel and Rachel added to their brood with the addition of a daughter, born in 2018, but the notoriously private couple decided to keep her name and gender a secret.\n\nThey were pictured out and about in New York with their bundle of joy, but refused to offer up any more details about the tot.\n\nHowever, Daniel’s daughter Ella accidentally revealed the name of the couple’s daughter with an innocent snap on her Instagram Stories last year.\n\nSharing a picture of a gingerbread house at Christmastime, Ella’s followers could see the family’s names placed in icing on the roof, and it wasn’t hard to figure out that the name ‘Gracie’ belonged to Daniel and Rachel’s daughter.\n\nNet worth\n\nDaniel Craig is the longest-serving James Bond actor by time-span, having retrained the license to kill for more than 15 years.\n\nBut in terms of films, he is beaten by veteran Roger Moore who starred in seven Bond movies, compared to Daniels' five.\n\nBefore taking on the role of Bond, Daniel was an acclaimed actor having starred in a string of hit movies - all of which had a knock on effect on his bank balance.\n\nIn 2015 he was listed as one of the highest-paid actor's in the world by Forbes magazines.\n\nAccording to Variety, Craig packeted roughly $25million ($18.6million) for his final outing as Bond, No Time To Die.\n\nAfter months of delay, the movie looks set to become one of the highest-grossing Bond movies of all time with fans desperate to get their fill of Daniel's last stint in the role.\n\nAt present, Skyfall remains the most commercially successful Bond of all time - raking in a staggering $1.1billion in worldwide revenue.\n\nCraig is now estimated to be worth an impressive $160million (£120million)."
