        "text": "Olivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis\n\nOlivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis had quite the Hollywood love story. They first crossed paths at a \"Saturday Night Live\" afterparty in 2011, and they were dating six months later. Fast forward two years and Sudeikis popped the question. The engagement, which lasted an entire seven years, had fans eagerly awaiting their walk down the aisle.\n\nBut unfortunately, their relationship took an unexpected turn, and despite their best efforts, they decided to part ways in 2020 and officially called off the wedding. However, both Olivia and Jason have continued to excel in their respective careers, with Olivia shining as an actress and director, and the “Ted Lasso” star having an incredible career as an actor and comedian. Despite some recent drama, these two will have to remain close for the sake of their two kids.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt\n\nIn the 90s, Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Pitt were the ultimate Hollywood power couple. The two met on the set of the movie \"Se7en\" in 1994 and quickly began dating. In 1996, they got engaged, but their relationship ended just a year later.\n\nWhile both actors have been relatively private about the reasons behind their split, Paltrow has said that she was too young at the time to handle such a high-profile relationship and realized she wasn’t ready to get married. Despite their breakup, the two have remained on good terms. Paltrow is raising two kids and running a wellness empire, and Pitt went on to marry Angelina Jolie (whom he divorced) and become a father of six.\n\nCourteney Cox and Michael Keaton\n\nWhen “Friends” star Courteney Cox tied the knot with “Scream” co-star David Arquette in 1999, they became one of Hollywood’s most famous couples. However, before she wed the handsome actor, Cox was previously engaged to actor Michael Keaton. The year was 1989 and a mutual friend introduced them after Cox had said she really liked Keaton’s performance in the film “Clean and Sober.”\n\nThe two actors really hit it off and began dating shortly after, eventually getting engaged. But, by 1995, Keaton and Cox ended things for good, due to “different lifestyles,” reported the actress. They both went on to have extremely successful acting careers and although Cox divorced Arquette in 2013, they share a daughter together and remain close. Keaton is still single, as far as we know.\n\nRashida Jones and Mark Ronson\n\nThe “Parks and Recreation” and “The Office” star Rashida Jones and musician Mark Ronson began dating back in 2002. Rashida comes from Hollywood royalty – legendary record producer Quincy Jones and actress Peggy Lipton; while Ronson is an extremely successful musician, DJ, and record producer that has worked with Amy Winehouse, Adele, Lady Gaga, and countless others.\n\nThis odd couple seem to hit it off almost right after meeting and after a year of dating, Ronson proposed through a crossword puzzle, that ultimately read out “Will you marry me”. So cute! Unfortunately, by the beginning of 2004, they decided to split up. Rashida is currently involved with musician Ezra Koenig, and Ronson married actress Grace Gummer in 2021.\n\nBella Thorne and Benjamin Mascolo\n\nDisney star Bella Thorne and Italian singer Benjamin Mascolo thought they had found their \"happily ever after\" in each other. The sparks flew when they crossed paths in 2019, and their love story quickly took off. The couple seemed inseparable, with adorable social media posts and public displays of affection.\n\nFinally, in March 2021, the singer popped the question, and the couple got engaged. However, life had other plans. Almost exactly a year after getting engaged, Mascolo announced on social media that they had separated and called off the wedding. Bella is now engaged to producer Mark Emms, and Mascolo has kept his private life under wraps.\n\nEdward Norton and Courtney Love\n\nNow, here’s a shocker. The controversial rockstar and Nirvana frontman’s ex Courtney Love was engaged to actor Edward Norton, can you believe it? Thanks to Norton, and the fact that it happened in the late nineties, the relationship was kept very private. Until Love went public some years later, telling the whole story. Norton and Love met on the set of the 1996 film “The People vs. Larry Flynt” and started a whirlwind relationship that lasted three years.\n\nAt some point during their relationship, Norton popped the question, and the couple got engaged. But not long after, Love called it off, saying she wasn’t ready for the commitment. Norton went on to marry Canadian film producer Shauna Robertson in 2012, with whom he has two kids. Love is apparently still single and still causing mayhem.\n\nUma Thurman and Arpad Busson\n\nUma Thurman hasn’t had much luck in her personal life. When it comes to love, Thurman has been married twice – to Gary Oldman and Ethan Hawke – and both times it ended in divorce. In 2007, she decided to give love another chance and started dating French financier Arpad Busson. By 2008, they were engaged, but called it off shortly after, with Uma returning the 8-carat diamond ring Busson had given her.\n\nBut they got back together, and four years later, they had a daughter. However, they couldn’t make the relationship work. In 2014, Thurman ended things for good, saying Busson was too controlling; they went on to have a nasty custody battle for their daughter, which Thurman ultimately won.\n\nJohnny Depp and Jennifer Grey\n\n“Dirty Dancing” star Jennifer Grey skyrocketed to fame after her role in the 1987 hit film. The star was dating Matthew Broderick in 1987 and became engaged shortly after. Unfortunately, a terrible car crash the couple had in Ireland which ended up taking two other peoples’ lives proved to be too much strain for Grey and Broderick, and they finally broke up in 1988.\n\nAs it turns out, Grey had started seeing Johnny Depp a few weeks after ending it with Broderick. Depp and Grey, who met through Grey’s agent, got engaged after just two weeks of seeing each other, meaning Grey was engaged to two different men during the same month in 1988. They lasted a year and then broke things off for good.\n\nCharlie Sheen and Scottine Ross\n\nCharlie Sheen is probably one of the most controversial actors in Hollywood history. The man has been on the news more times than anybody can count, and his love life has been a huge part of the media fodder. Amongst his many failed relationships, few people know about his very brief engagement with model and adult film star Scottine Ross.\n\nThey met in November 2013, dated until January 2014, got engaged, and called it off later that year. And in typical Charlie Sheen fashion, it didn’t end there. Ross sued Sheen for a whopping $5 million dollars, and they ended up settling for an undisclosed amount. Yikes!\n\nJennifer Aniston and Tate Donovan\n\nIf you were a fan of “Friends,” you’ll remember the episodes when Rachel becomes smitten with one of her customers – Joshua, played by actor Tate Donovan. But few people know that these two had an actual love story behind the cameras. Before getting cast on “Friends,” Tate Donovan had dated Jennifer Aniston for three years and even popped the question in 1998.\n\nThey were engaged for a few months before calling it off – apparently, the media pressure was too much for Donovan. So, it was incredibly awkward when Donovan got cast in five episodes of “Friends” and had to work next to his ex-fiancé every day. Luckily, they both moved on; Anniston went on to marry twice and then get divorced, and Donovan married once but also ended in divorce.\n\nNicollette Sheridan and Michael Bolton\n\nThe talented blonde bombshell Nicolette Sheridan is most known for her roles in “Desperate Housewives” and “Dynasty.” But she’s been in the Hollywood scene since the 90s, and so was her almost-husband Michael Bolton. The famous singer-songwriter and the actress dated from 1992 until 1995, when they broke things off.\n\nThen, in 2005, they rekindled the relationship and even got engaged. People thought things were finally going to work out between them, but alas, in 2008, they decided to go their separate ways. Bolton never married, and Sheridan married actor Aaron Phypers in 2015, but got divorced three years later.\n\nDemi Moore and Emilio Estevez\n\nThe 1985 coming-of-age hit film “St. Elmo’s Fire” brought co-stars Demi Moore and Emilio Estevez together. They started dating for some months and were engaged by the end of that same year. For the next two years, Moore and Estevez broke up and got back together several times, until finally setting a wedding date for December of 1986.\n\nNot surprisingly, they finally called it off for good a few months later. Moore married actor Bruce Willis in 1987, with whom she had three gorgeous daughters. Even though they divorced in 2000, they remain very close. Moore married Ashton Kutcher in 2005 and then divorced him in 2013. Since then, the beautiful actress has been enjoying the single life with her cute dog Pilaf.\n\nJason Wahler and Katja Decker Sadowski\n\n“The Hills” and “Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County” actor Jason Wahler is now happily married to model Ashley Slack. However, back in 2007, he almost pledged his undying love to somebody else – Katja Decker Sadowski. They started dating in February of 2007, and by August of that same year, they were engaged.\n\nThe engagement bliss lasted until February 2009, when Wahler decided to call off the wedding. The actor said they had broken up amicably and simply decided that “they were both just too young to be considering getting married right now.” Well, it’s definitely better to admit that before any forever commitments are made.\n\nJulia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland\n\nJulia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland met on the set of their movie \"Flatliners\" in 1990, right when Sutherland was finalizing a divorce. The two began dating soon after and were living together by the end of that same year. Rumors started going around about Sutherland being unfaithful, but they were all silenced when the couple announced they were engaged and scheduled for a big celebrity wedding in June of 1991.\n\nBut just three days before their scheduled wedding, Roberts called off the engagement. Roberts eventually married cinematographer Daniel Moder in 2002 and went on to have three children. Sutherland’s love life was slightly rockier – he got married and divorced and has had a slew of relationships in between until finally settling down with partner Cindy Vela, also an actress.\n\nRuby Rose and Phoebe Dahl\n\nActress and “Orange Is the New Black” star Ruby Rose met Phoebe Dahl in 2014, at a barbecue of a mutual friend. Dahl, granddaughter and heiress to famous English writer Roald Dahl, immediately fell for the wild and gorgeous Ruby. And apparently, the feeling was mutual.\n\nThe two started dating, and after just three months, they got engaged. However, the engagement lasted little over a year, as they announced they were going their separate ways by the end of 2015. As Dahl explained to the press, \"Our break is not the result of any media speculation, and we want nothing but the best for each other.\"\n\nSean Penn and Charlize Theron\n\nSean Penn definitely has good taste in women. After splitting up with his actress Robin Wright, Sean Penn fell for none other than South African beauty Charlize Theron. These two Hollywood A-listers got together in 2013 and got engaged a short year later; but alas, it wasn't meant to be. After 18 months of dating, they decided to go their separate ways.\n\nThe tabloids had a field day with their breakup, but thankfully, Theron cleared everything up. Like the classy lady that she is, the “Mad Max: Fury Road” star cleared the air, saying that sometimes relationships just don't work out, and in this case, they both decided to separate amicably. Oh well, as long as it was amicable.\n\nDylan McDermott and Maggie Q\n\nActor Dylan McDermott made his claim to fame after starring in the legal drama series “The Practice,” and he’s continued to land important roles through the years. Career-wise, McDermott has done quite well for himself, acting in hit shows like “Law & Order,” “American Horror Story,” and “FBI: Most Wanted.”\n\nAs for his love life, things haven’t gone so well. Back in 2014, McDermott met co-star Maggie Q on the set of the TV crime series “The Stalker.” They started dating almost immediately, and less than a year later, they were engaged. After four years of what seemed to be a lasting love story, they split up.\n\nDarren Aronofsky and Rachel Weisz\n\nBrilliant director Darren Aronofsky and stunning actress Rachel Weisz were one of Hollywood’s favorite couples, and we can see why. They met backstage at a play in London back in 2001, and it seems the chemistry set right in because a short year later, Rachel was moving to New York to live with Darren.\n\nIn 2005, they got engaged, and a few months later, they had a son. By 2006, Aronofsky cast his fiancé in his film “The Fountain,” and to keep things professional, they moved to separate apartments while the shoot was going on. This caused them to drift apart and have less time as a couple, which eventually led to their breakup in November 2010.\n\nMariah Carey and James Packer\n\nMariah Carey’s love life seems to be as dramatic as her songs, but despite two failed marriages and an engagement that never happened, the diva never lost hope. Carey has been in a relationship with choreographer Bryan Tanaka since 2016, and they seem to be going strong.\n\nHowever, right before partnering with Tanaka, she had a brief but intense engagement with Australian businessman James Packer. In 2015, Carey and Packer started dating and a wild romance began, and by 2016, Packer proposed to the “Endless Love” singer with a $10 million, 35-carat diamond ring! The couple was engaged for about ten months, until finally calling it off due to fights and irreconcilable differences.\n\nMarilyn Manson and Rose McGowan\n\nRose McGowan and Marilyn Manson's love affair was a wild ride. The pair made headlines for their three-and-a-half-year-long public relationship, but their engagement ended after just two years in 2001. While rumors suggested that substance abuse played a part in their breakup, McGowan still holds a candle for Manson, stating that \"there is great love.\"\n\nHowever, she admitted that their lifestyles didn't quite match up. Manson moved on to marry Dita Von Teese, but that also came to an end after rumors that he was involved with actress Evan Rachel Wood. Later that year, the cat was out of the bag, and Manson's relationship with Wood went public. In 2007, McGowan got engaged to Robert Rodriguez, but that also didn’t end in a wedding.\n\nAlyssa Milano and Scott Wolf\n\n“Charmed” star Alyssa Milano once quipped that her dating history is longer than her IMDB profile. And boy, does she have a star-studded list! From Eric Dane to Justin Timberlake to David Arquette, Milano knows how to keep things interesting. But there's one relationship that took a nosedive — her whirlwind romance with Scott Wolf.\n\nIt all started on the set of “Double Dragon” in June 1993, and before two months of dating had gone by, Milano and Wolf were already living together. The engagement followed suit, but by the next year, they had decided to end it. Milano, now happily married to her agent husband, David Bugliari, is raising two adorable kids. As for Wolf, he married Kelley Marie Limp and has three gorgeous children.\n\nLenny Kravitz and Nicole Kidman\n\nThis one was a true shocker since very few people knew that Nicole Kidman and Lenny Kravitz had been engaged. Yes, you read that right. “The Northman” star dated and even got engaged to musician Lenny Kravitz back in the early 2000s. In 2002, Lenny Kravitz was Kidman’s landlord, and the two started dating after meeting a few times.\n\nThings progressed quickly and by 2003 they got engaged, but it didn’t last long, things were officially over that same year. Kidman never said anything until casually dropping a bomb for her “Big Little Lies” press tour. “Well, I knew Zoë because I was engaged to her father,” the actress suddenly said. Well, they both seem to have ended up quite happy.\n\nSheryl Crow and Lance Armstrong\n\n2003 was a landmark year for cycling legend Lance Armstrong – he finalized his divorce from his first wife and started dating singer Sheryl Crow shortly after. Their engagement hit the headlines in September 2005, but just a few months later, their love story came to a screeching halt in February 2006.\n\nThe seven-time champion of the Tour de France couldn’t make things work with Crow. But hey, life goes on, and Armstrong went on to have two more kids with his fiancé Anna Hansen. Meanwhile, Crow adopted two beautiful boys and settled down in Nashville, Tennessee. All’s well that ends well!\n\nKerry Washington and David Moscow\n\nBack in the early 2000s, “Scandal” star Kerry Washington was in a relationship with fellow actor David Moscow. You might remember Moscow from playing the young Josh Baskin, Tom Hanks’ friend in the 90s film “Big.” In 2004, Moscow finally popped the question and the couple got engaged.\n\nThe engagement lasted three years, and suddenly, in 2007, Kerry realized she wasn’t even excited about picking out her dress. Both Washington and Moscow realized they were trying too hard to make things work, so they finally called it off in what was a very public breakup. Not surprisingly, Washington has kept her personal life very private since then, even after marrying fellow actor Nnamdi Asomugha and having two gorgeous kids together.\n\nTate Donovan and Sandra Bullock\n\nYou probably won’t remember the cheesy 1992 romcom “Love Potion No. 9,” but its stars certainly do. Sandra Bullock and Tate Donovan fell for each other on set and after a few months of dating, they got engaged. Unfortunately, the engagement lasted three years, and in 1995, they finally called it quits.\n\nWhen Bullock talked about why the relationship ended, she said, \"the person who needed me most was always the person I was attracted to,\" explaining that her self-love was never her priority. Definitely a recipe for disaster. Bullock had been with photographer Bryan Randall since 2015 and they had been raising her two adopted kids. Sadly though, Randall passed away in 2023.\n\nEmily Blunt and Michael Bublé\n\nBefore “A Quiet Place” star Emily Blunt was happily married to fellow actor John Krasinski, she was engaged to famous singer Michael Bublé. They met back in 2005 when Blunt was backstage for one of Bublé’s concerts, and they almost immediately hit it off. After dating for some time, Michael proposed to the actress ad they got engaged. Unfortunately, by 2008, they had broken things off due to alleged infidelity on Bublé’s part.\n\nThey both stayed very private about the breakup, with Michael ultimately saying that show business is very strenuous on any relationship, especially if one person is in music and the other in film. Bublé went on to marry Argentinian actress Luisana Lopilato, and Blunt has a beautiful family with Krasinski.\n\nColbie Caillat and Justin Young\n\nIn a love story for the ages, singer-songwriters Colbie Caillat and Justin Young fell in love back in 2010, after having been best friends for years. Their family, friends, and fans couldn’t get enough of this adorable couple, who had their social media accounts littered with romantic photos.\n\nFive years later, they got engaged, and everyone was waiting patiently for the wedding date to be set. But another five years went by and, instead of a wedding date, Caillat and Young broke up in 2020. Since then, no new relationships have been reported by either, and they seem to remain good friends and musical collaborators.\n\nDrew Barrymore and Jamie Walters\n\nAmong the long list of celebrities that Drew Barrymore has dated, including Luke Wilson, David Arquette, Tom Green, and Justin Long, “Beverly Hills, 90210” star Jamie Walters was one of the few that popped the question. Barrymore and Walters started dating in 1992, and after a few months, they were already living together and getting engaged.\n\nSadly, the engagement only lasted a year, and in 1993, they went their separate ways. Fun fact: Walters was so committed to Barrymore that he had her name tattooed on his arm – and she returned the gesture! Perhaps it would have been a better idea to wait until after the wedding to get the matching tats?\n\nJohnny Depp and Sherilyn Fenn\n\nThe beautiful actress Sherilyn Fenn made her acting debut by playing Audrey Horne in the hit 90s show “Twin Peaks.” But before she became an A-list Hollywood celebrity, she met Johnny Depp on the set of a 1985 student film. They started an on-and-off relationship that lasted three years until they finally got engaged.\n\nA few months later, they broke things off for good, and Fenn went on to marry musician Toulouse Holliday in 1994 and have a son with him. Three years later, they divorced, and it wasn’t until 2006 that Fenn started a serious relationship with Dylan Stewart, with whom she had another son. As for Depp, well, we all know how that turned out.\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna\n\nThe least-known member of the famous Kardashian clan, Rob Kardashian made headlines when he started dating model and actress Blac Chyna. Back in 2016, after just two and a half months of dating, Rob proposed, and the couple got engaged.\n\nMore than a year into the engagement, they had a daughter in November 2017, and Blac Chyna’s tense relationship with the rest of the Kardashian family didn’t seem to be getting any better. After some months of insane drama, Rob and Blac Chyna decided to break things off for good in February of 2018. Nowadays, they’re focused on co-parenting their daughter Dream and seem to both be single.\n\nDaniel Craig and Satsuki Mitchell\n\nDaniel Craig, the suave British actor known for his iconic portrayal of James Bond, had an interesting journey with his former partner, film producer Satsuki Mitchell. The two crossed paths on the set of the 2005 film “The Jacket.”\n\nThey began dating and, two years later, Daniel popped the question, and Satsuki happily accepted. However, three years later, in 2010, Craig called things off and didn’t wait too long to start dating his now-wife Rachel Weisz. The two have been together since 2011, and more than a decade later, they still seem to be head over heels for each other.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood and Zach Villa\n\nIn the magical city of Los Angeles, Evan Rachel Wood and Zach Villa met in 2015. They fell for each other almost instantly and began a musical journey together. They fused their talents and formed the electro-pop music duo, \"Rebel and a Basketcase.\" While they kept mum about their engagement, their arrival at the SAG Awards with matching suits and those sneaky little engagement bands spilled the beans.\n\nEven Wood's publicist couldn't keep it under wraps. But alas, like a song that fades out too soon, their relationship was over by September 2017. The “Westworld” star has decided to enjoy the single life while raising a son from a previous marriage, while Villa seems to be fully dedicated to his music and acting.\n\nLaura Dern and Billy Bob Thornton\n\nIn a Hollywood tale that was almost as wild as a Coen Brothers' film, Laura Dern and Billy Bob Thornton once walked the red carpet hand in hand. The A-list celebrities met back in 1997 when they appeared as guests on the Ellen DeGeneres show. They really hit it off from the get-go and started dating.\n\nShortly after, they got engaged but then came the drama. In 2000, after discovering that Thornton had secretly married Angelina Jolie while engaged to her, Laura Dern had no other choice but to accept that the relationship with the “Monster’s Ball” star was definitely over. Thornton split from Jolie and married actress Connie Angland in 2014.\n\nAnne Cline and Taryn Manning\n\nThe worlds of music and acting collided when musician Anne Cline and actress Taryn Manning found themselves head over heels for each other. After a wild romance, singer Cline proposed to the “Orange Is the New Black” star in the middle of a concert. Cline hopped off the stage and proposed to Manning in June of 2021.\n\nUnfortunately, by October of that same year, they called off the engagement. Apparently, it was Manning’s decision, explaining in a later interview that it was “just not the right relationship for her.” As for their current love lives, both the actress and musician seem to be single and focusing on their careers.\n\nGinnifer Goodwin and Joey Kern\n\n“Big Love” and “Once Upon a Time” star Ginnifer Goodwin started dating Joey Kern, who rose to fame after his role in the indie horror “Cabin Fever,” in 2010. The star-crossed duo met through a mutual friend that set them up. After months of dating, Kern popped the question with a beautiful engagement ring the actor had designed himself. Romantic!\n\nHowever, like many love stories in Tinseltown, their engagement ultimately ended a few months later. Thankfully, both moved on to new chapters. Ginnifer found her \"happily ever after\" in actor Josh Dallas, her \"Once Upon a Time\" co-star, with whom she had two children. Meanwhile, Joey tied the knot with fitness instructor Gillian Rose in 2019.\n\nClare Crawley and Dale Moss\n\nClare Crawley and Dale Moss had a whirlwind romance that left viewers buzzing.

Why? Because they needed to focus on their careers, apparently. Shortly after, Cannon went on to marry the legendary diva Mariah Carey, but, unfortunately, they ended up divorcing after eight years.
