        "text": "Being notoriously straight-talking and shock-horror, blond, Daniel Craig was considered by some fans an unusual choice to play 007.\n\nBut there is one trait the actor appears to have in common with the superspy – a weakness for beautiful women.\n\nDaniel, 47, makes his fourth outing as Bond in Spectre, released on Monday, alongside Monica Bellucci, 51, Lea Seydoux, 30, and Stephanie Sigman, 28.\n\nBut it is the real Bond girls who have made the biggest impact on the 47-year-old’s life, with Daniel admitting his need for a woman and his desire not to be alone.\n\n“Being on your own would be sad, sick and weird,” he once said. “I don’t trust myself. I need that balance.”\n\nBut at the same time, friends and exes have discussed the Bond actor’s need to be free.\n\nHe once agreed: “Commitment is part of a life – the toughest part, probably.”\n\nIt is a contradiction one of his early flames, Marina Pepper, 48, saw only too clearly.\n\nSpeaking exclusively from her home in Lewes, East Sussex, the ­ex-girlfriend from Craig’s acting school days in London shed light on those jarring feelings.\n\nThe former glamour model, now an anti-fracking activist and white witch, dated Daniel when he was 18 and admits: “I did play a mother role in some ways. I think he was quite happy to let people do that. I was definitely in charge. I was just a little bit older than him, I was a home owner, and he came to live with me. I think he still owes me some rent!”\n\nBut in another way, it sounds like Daniel really called the shots.\n\nSingle mum Marina describes him as “very taut, very denim”, a “pretty boy”, and a free spirit she couldn’t pin down.\n\n“He was a right one for going out and not coming back for two days, and in those days we didn’t have mobile phones. I was worried,” she admits.\n\n“I assumed he was hanging with people he thought could help his career – it must have been very schmoozy, because it was all weekend. He would just say, ‘What?’ He was very much his own man.”\n\nNow, Daniel seems to have struck the right balance with second wife Rachel Weisz , 45. And the actor has made it clear he hopes this is the one.\n\n“I’m in love. I’m very happy. I am hopefully in this for the long run,” he has said.\n\nBut a long line of women have paved the way to his current contentment.\n\nCraig’s liking for a supportive lady may have its roots in the close bond he shares with mother Carol Olivia, an art teacher who brought him and his sister up in Liverpool after she split with his pub landlord dad Timothy. She nurtured his love of acting, taking him regularly to the Everyman Theatre, after turning down her own place at RADA to be a mum.\n\nDaniel has said: “I have a huge respect for women, which I’ve learned from my mother and my sister.”\n\nTeenage Daniel was hugely popular with the ladies but school pal Adam Brierley, 47, admitted: “He’d always have new girlfriends and keep the relationship on an on-and-off basis.”\n\nDaniel moved to the National Youth Theatre in London at the age of 16, and despite Marina’s ­recollections of his ­reluctance to settle down, he unexpectedly did.\n\nIn 1992, at just 23, he met Scottish actress Fiona Loudon. She gave birth to his daughter Ella that same year and they married.\n\nBut they split in 1994.\n\n“I was too young,” he has previously explained. “I thought it was the mature thing to do. I don’t regret it, but I do wish I’d lived it in a different way.” He has described being a dad as “the most wonderful thing that’ll ever happen to you”. And Ella, 22, is close to her father – in 2012, for her 18th, he dressed as 007 for her Bond-themed party.\n\nYet as she grew up, she saw a number of women walk in and out of her father’s life. After Fiona, German Love Actually actress Heike Makatsch, now 44, was Craig’s next long-term love – for seven years.\n\nYet his work kept them apart for long periods. “Film sets have caused a lot of break-ups; marriages go down the tubes,” Daniel once said. “It’s bloody lonely.”\n\nFollowing their split, Craig denied rumours he was dating Kate Moss after they were seen leaving restaurants.\n\nThen, on the set of 2005 film The Jacket, he met producer Satsuki Mitchell, now 32. But again he was dogged by rumours - this time of having a fling with Sienna Miller .\n\nSienna and Craig had been close since co-starring in Layer Cake in 2004. When rumours emerged they had an affair while the actress was still with boyfriend Jude Law, both were quick to deny it.\n\nBut last year Sienna, 33, admitted they were “briefly involved” at one point, adding: “It was not a relationship, it was a very brief encounter, and he was my best friend”.\n\nSatsuki and Daniel got engaged in 2007, and she helped him deal with the fame that came from Bond. But their relationship was to come to an abrupt end.\n\nIn 2011 Daniel went to Canada to film Dream House with old friend Rachel Weisz, who he first met in 1994 when they performed in raunchy play Les Grandes Horizontales in London.\n\nIt was soon announced Rachel had separated from Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky, 46, the father of her nine-year-old son Henry, while Craig then ended his relationship with Satsuki.\n\nAfter six months of whispering about a possible romance, it emerged he and Rachel had married in a small ceremony.\n\nIt was a shock to Satsuki. Her father Christopher later admitted: “We heard about it like everyone else, by reading the newspapers.”\n\nBut for Daniel it was a brighter ending and he had finally found his Bond girl.\n\nAnd with him suggesting he could be ready to quit playing the spy, maybe he has waved farewell to his inner 007 too."
