The only guests are believed to have been Craig’s 18-year-old daughter Ella, Weisz’s five-year-old son Henry and two family friends.\n\n“They are madly in love and couldn’t wait to be husband and wife - but they wanted minimum fuss,” a friend of the couple said.\n\nThe clandestine wedding came on the heels of a whirlwind romance. The British actors had been friends for years but started dating only"
