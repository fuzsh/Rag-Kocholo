        "text": "As the beloved James Bond star Daniel Craig reels in his 56th birthday celebration we're taking a closer look at his dating history over the years from co-star romances to failed engagements.\n\nWhile Daniel shares a loving over decade-long marriage with actress Rachel Wisez now, the Hollywood hunk has had his fair share of romances in the spotlight over the years. The former Knives Out actor has previously engaged, has two children with different women, dated a German actress for seven years, and shared a long-term relationship and home with a film producer.\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nREAD MORE: Tish Cyrus' net worth as she's accused of marrying her daughter Noah Cyrus' boyfriend\n\nRachel Wisez\n\nDaniel has been happily married to his wife actress Rachel Risez for an incredible 13 years together and share a sweet love story as they rekindled heir romance together two decades after they first laid eyes on each other.\n\nThe lovebirds first met before they rose to stardom as they co-starred in the play Les Grandes Horizontales together at the National Theatre Studio in London. Although they were just castmates at the time, their love later blossomed when they reconnected on the set of the crime horror movie Dream House together in 2010.\n\nAfter a secret whirlwind romance, they secretly wed in a very intimate ceremony in New York in June of 2011. The pair's exclusive wedding purposefully made quaint to \"protect\" their marriage, only had four guests which included Rachel's son, Daniel's daughter, and two of their family friends.\n\nWhile both remain tight-lipped about their relationship in the public eye, Daniel has expressed that he is very content with Rachel. In an interview with British GQ, the Hollywood star confirmed: \"I'm in love. I'm very happy.\" Since exchanging their vows, the sweet couple have gone on to welcome their 4-year-old daughter, whose name has never been made public.\n\nSatsuki Mitchell\n\nBack in 2005, Daniel and his ex-fianc√©e Satsuki met on set of the sci-fi thriller The Jacket as he starred in the movie and she produced it. After connecting on set the pair went on to share a six-year-long relationship. Daniel went on to get down on one knee and ask Satsuki to marry him, but the pair later called off their engagement before Daniel dumped her and started dating Rachel.\n\nWhile they kept the details of their relationship very private as well, they often stepped out for glamorous red carpet events together as they supported one another in their entertainment careers. After the news that Daniel had secretly married Rachel after a short relationship together, those close to Satuski say that she was torn apart by the news.\n\nChristopher Mitchell, Satuski's father spoke to Britain's Daily Mail revealing that no one in their household is allowed to mention the actors name. He told the news outlet: \"His sudden marriage came out of nowhere. We heard about it like everyone else - by reading the newspapers. She doesn't mention his name now and tells me off if I do,\" and added: \"Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break-up was the best thing for her. She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship.\"\n\nKate Moss\n\nDaniel and Kate were rumored to be dating for a few months back in 2004 but never publicly announced that they were official. The two were spotted together during a number of outings including a fashion show hosted by Alexander McQueen in London. While little is known about their romance, a court previously reported that he left the supermodel declaring his love for her which wad discovered when reporter Dan Evans hacked his voicemail.\n\nSienna Miller\n\nDaniel and Sienna sparked romance rumors after the pair shared undeniable chemistry on set of the gangster drama Layer Cake together back in 2004 with the pair sharing an on-screen relationship. When it came out that there was speculation that they had an affair while Sienna was with her boyfriend actor Jude Law, they both adamantly denied them. But years later, Sienna revealed that she was \"briefly involved\" with the James Bond star and explained: \"It was not a relationship, it was a very brief encounter, and he was my best friend.\""
