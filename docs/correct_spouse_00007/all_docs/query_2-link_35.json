        "text": "People are still trying to figure out what exactly happened with Daniel Craig, Satsuki Mitchell, Rachel Weisz and Darren Aronofsky. The problem is that none of the main figures in the story are speaking or giving any indication of what really happened. First, there was the report from TMZ about Rachel and Darren splitting, and that the rumor was that Rachel and Daniel were now getting hot and heavy. Then the British tabloid the Daily Mail ran a report in which unnamed sources âconfirmedâ that Rachel and Daniel had indeed had an affair/relationship, although the details of which were not forthcoming. A day after that, E! Newsâ gossip guy Marc Malkin had another report claiming the opposite. A source said: “Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have been friends since their theater years when they were younger. They are the best of friends, but not lovers.” The main crux of that report was that Daniel was/is still with Satsuki Mitchell. Wellâ¦ now The Telegraph has a report about Daniel and Satsuki being over:\n\nAppropriately for the man who plays James Bond, Daniel Craig has kept his love life shrouded in mystery. Now, his agents have added to the intrigue by declining to deny rumours that the 42-year-old actor has broken off his engagement to Satsuki Mitchell, 34, an American film producer, whom he has been courting for more than five years.\n\n“Things seem to have cooled between them,” says a friend of the couple. Last week, sources close to the actor denied that he had played any part in the demise of Rachel Weisz’s relationship with Darren Aronofsky, the American director.\n\nThe British actress, 40, announced that she and Aronofsky, 41, by whom she has a four-year-old son, Henry, had been “separated for some months”.\n\nIt was alleged that Weisz had fallen “head over heels” for Craig on the set of the thriller Dream House, in which they play a married couple. In 1994, he divorced Fiona Loudon, the Scottish actress, by whom he has a daughter, Ella, after a two-year marriage.\n\n[From The Telegraph]\n\nNow, what do I believe from this cycle of whispers? Hereâs the theory that Iâm working on right now: I think Daniel and Satsuki are over, and that theyâve probably been over for months. I think their relationship probably ended around the same time as Rachel and Darrenâs. I think Rachel and Daniel probably did have an affair or some kind of romantic or sexual relationship, but the relationship isnât ongoing. Theyâre either taking a break, a breather while they ended their relationships and cleaned up their messes, and will come back together a few months from now OR it was just a simple affair and itâs over and everyone is moving on. Thatâs my theory."
