        "text": "Rachel Weisz managed to do the Hollywood impossible and keep her nuptials to fellow actor and Dream House costar Daniel Craig a secret for several days, so it took some digging to find out other details of her highly guarded life. Below, some lesser-known facts about the new Mrs. Craig.\n\nWeisz attended the prestigious St Paul’s Girls’ School in London and was in the year ahead of actress Emily Mortimer. The two ladies have done more than share schools, however: Weisz was long ago linked romantically to Mortimer’s now-husband, actor Alessandro Nivola. Weisz and Nivola co-starred in the 1998 film I Want You.\n\nShe is proud of her Hungarian father, a successful inventor who fled to London when he was younger while escaping the Nazi regime. Weisz told the NY Post in 2004: “My father invented thousands of things—a metal detector which clears a safety path for land mines, an artificial respirator, a milking machine so humans needn’t milk cows by hand, valves that open speed-train doors. I am very proud of him.”\n\nShe is the mother of five-year-old Henry Chance with her ex-fiance, Black Swan director Darren Aronofsky. Henry was one of four present at Weisz recent nuptials, along with Craig’s 18-year-old daughter, Ella. Weisz and Aronofsky announced they had ended their nine-year relationship last November, around the same time Craig announced he had broken off his engagement with American movie producer Satsuki Mitchell, whom he had been with since 2005.\n\nThese two British lovebirds share another similarity: their birthdays. Weisz, 41, was born March 7, while Craig, 43, celebrates his birthday only a few days earlier on March 2. Weisz and Craig were spotted leaving French restaurant The Little Door in Los Angeles earlier this year after Weisz’s birthday, sharing a quiet dinner.\n\nShe is “the woman Esquire readers would most like to marry.” In a poll conducted for the February 2010 issue of Esquire UK, readers chose Weisz (then engaged to Aronofsky) as the most wed-able woman. “Rachel Weisz is the woman Esquire readers would most like to marry—which confirms you are men of impeccable taste.” It seems that in this love story, the Bond star snagged the girl in the end."
