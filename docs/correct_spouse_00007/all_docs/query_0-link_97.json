        "text": "Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz got married in a secret ceremony in New York on Wednesday, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe couple, who moved in together earlier this year after a whirl-wind romance, wed at a private ceremony at a friend's house with just four guests present - Craig's 18-year-old daughter Ella, Weisz's son Henry, four, and two family friends who acted as witnesses.\n\nA source told reporters: \"Daniel and Rachel insisted on having a small, quiet wedding. They are madly in love and couldn't wait to be husband and wife - but they wanted minimum fuss.\n\n\"They had a couple of friends as witnesses and their children from previous relationships and that was it.\"\n\nA rep for the pair confirmed the marriage had taken place yesterday, but did not offer any more details.\n\nThe pair have been friends for several years, but were first linked together in November 2010. At the time, however, they strenuously denied they were in a relationship.\n\nBefore they got together, Rachel Weisz was in a nine-year relationship with Black Swan director, Darren Aronofsky, and Daniel Craig was engaged to his long term girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell.\n\nHowever, it became clear that Craig and Weisz were an item when they were spotted holding hands as they celebrated Christmas in Somerset together.\n\nSECRET WEDDINGS - find out which A-listers tied the knot in secret!"
