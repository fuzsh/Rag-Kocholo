        "text": "Appropriately for the man who plays James Bond, Daniel Craig has kept his love life shrouded in mystery. Now, his agents have added to the intrigue by declining to deny rumours that the 42-year-old actor has broken off his engagement to Satsuki Mitchell, 34, an American film producer, whom he has been courting for more than five years.\n\n\"Things seem to have cooled between them,\" says a friend of the couple. Last week, sources close to the actor denied that he had played any part in the demise of Rachel Weisz's relationship with Darren Aronofsky, the American director.\n\nThe British actress, 40, announced that she and Aronofsky, 41, by whom she has a four-year-old son, Henry, had been \"separated for some months\".\n\nIt was alleged that Weisz had fallen \"head over heels\" for Craig on the set of the thriller Dream House, in which they play a married couple. In 1994, he divorced Fiona Loudon, the Scottish actress, by whom he has a daughter, Ella, after a two-year marriage.\n\nThe only way is Essex for Tara Palmer-Tomkinson\n\nThe tabloid newspapers are enthralled by the ghastly \"reality\" television show The Only Way is Essex, but Tara Palmer-Tomkinson has a more elevated interest in the county.\n\nThe presenter, 38, has learnt that her uncle Christopher will represent the Queen there. \"He will make the best high sheriff of Essex,\" says Tara. \"The only way is Essex, obviously, and I can't wait to visit.\""
