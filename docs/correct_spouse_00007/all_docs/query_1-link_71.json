        "text": "Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have made their red carpet debut as a married couple at the Spanish premiere of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, after the James Bond star admitted his love life had been nothing but ‘complicated’ over the last few years.\n\nAfter springing a surprise wedding on us last year by marrying Weisz , the James Bond star has turned to body art in a bid to make some sense out of his turbulent past.\n\nThe blue-eyed hunk cryptically divulged his relationship woes by revealing two tattoos mark his marriage to the 41-year-old About A Boy actress.\n\nâTheyâre two very personal tattoos,â he said of his new ink jobs.\n\nâTheyâre just part of a stage Iâm in. You should see the rest of my body. Then youâd be intrigued. Oh boy. Itâs been a very complicated couple of years,â he told GQ magazine.\n\nHis comments follow a topsy-turvy past in the romance stakes. He shacked up with Weisz at the end of 2010, just months after splitting from film producer Satsuki Mitchell following a six-year relationship.\n\nBefore Mitchell, he had a seven-year romance with German actress Heike Makatsch.\n\nAnd the 43-year-old is no novice at walking up the aisle either after his two-year marriage to Scottish actress Fiona Loudon ended in 1994.\n\nMeanwhile, the stern star has hit back at critics who say he needs to lighten up. âThereâs no point,â he said. âItâs just not the way Iâm constructed.\n\nâI think it would show me up in a worse light â âOh look, heâs trying to make us like him now. What a c***â.â"
