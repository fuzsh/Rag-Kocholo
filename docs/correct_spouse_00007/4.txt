Daniel Craig has apparently called off his engagement to longtime girlfriend, Satsuki Mitchell, it has been reported.

The James Bond star has been dating the producer since 2005, and the pair became engaged in 2008 when Craig popped the question with the aid of a Cartier ring. However, recent reports indicate that he has decided to pull the plug on the marriage.

A source told reporters: "Things seem to have cooled between them."

Craig has been romantically linked to Rachel Weisz recently, who announced her separation from fianc√© Darren Aronofsky last week. The pair have just finished filming horror movie Dream House together.

Spookily suspicious or just a coincidence? What do you think?
