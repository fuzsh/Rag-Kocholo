Reports of Daniel Craig being gay have sprouted all over the internet, and we're wonder if they could be true... "It was definitely Daniel Craig and he was most certainly making out with a guy," a source said, "It was an open-mouth passionate French kiss. In fact, Daniel held the guy's head in his hands and pull[ed] him in for the kiss!"

According to the National Enquirer, another source added: "I thought Daniel may have come in with his gay friend to check out the live music. But when they started dancing I thought, 'This is more than just two friends out for drinks'."

If Daniel is gay, what about his relationship with longtime girlfriend Satsuki Mitchell? Or his marriage with ex-wife Fiona Loudon?
