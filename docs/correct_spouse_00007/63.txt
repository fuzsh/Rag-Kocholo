Mitchell's father Christopher has now told the Daily Mail that the 32-year-old producer has banned all mention of Craig's name after being left to discover news of his nuptials through the press.

"Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break-up was the best thing for her. She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship."

Christopher further confessed his fears that Satsuki has developed an eating disorder since the split, stating: "I have suggested to her on a number of occasions that she might have one. Yet whenever we're together she eats like a horse."
