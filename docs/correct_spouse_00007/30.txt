Actor Daniel Craig's marriage to actress Rachel Weiz has left his ex-fiance Satsuki Mitchell stunned.

Mitchell's father Christopher revealed that his daughter is so upset that she has forbidden family members from mentioning Craig's name.

"His sudden marriage came out of nowhere. We heard about it like everyone else - by reading the newspapers. She doesn't mention his name now and tells me off if I do," dailymail.co.uk quoted the father as saying.

"Satsuki has only just reached a happy place. She has since said, more than once, that the break-up was the best thing for her. She knew he was not the man she wanted him to be and there was something wrong in the relationship," he added.

Mitchell, 32, and Craig, 43, got engaged in 2007. They split last November.
