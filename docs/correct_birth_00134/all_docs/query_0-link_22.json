        "text": "Louisville took the blow like a champ: still on its feet. Fists up. Still jawing. On Sunday morning at 22nd Street and Muhammad Ali Boulevard, the Reverend Larry Williams stood before the congregation at Zion Baptist Church and prayed: “We ask for strength for the family of the great Muhammad Ali.”\n\nHe raised his voice.\n\n“We pray that they’ll have such peace they can come in rejoicing!”\n\nSince word of Ali’s death arrived on Saturday morning, people across the city have come together in public to remember one of the city’s best-loved sons and to boast of his triumphs over his greatest foes. Not Frazier, or Liston or Foreman. But racial discrimination. Cowardice. War.\n\nHis funeral on Friday will reflect his multifaceted legacy; it will be an interfaith service, open to the public, streamed live on the website of the Muhammad Ali Center. From former president Bill Clinton to sportscaster Bryant Gumbel to Billy Crystal, a constellation of eulogists will try to describe the elements of Ali’s personality – the magisterial, the athletic, the witty. And it will be, above all, a Louisville affair. Before the service, Ali’s hearse will drive slowly through the city streets to Cave Hill Cemetery.\n\nAli arose from here – from a tiny pink house in Louisville’s west side – to become the most famous man in the world. He wielded that fame like a left jab. By the time he finished, he had changed the Louisville of his youth – a segregated, provincial city – for good.\n\n“Not just Louisville.” said his childhood neighbor, Lawrence Montgomery. “The world.”\n\nAli started here on Grand Avenue, honing the irrepressible qualities that would carry him to victory inside the ring and out. Montgomery has lived all of his 81 years on the same block of Grand, and as he talked on his front porch his hand moved lightly from scene to scene, outlining ghosts: the site of the old tree, the path to the park, the young Cassius Clay, not yet called Ali.\n\n“He was always, eh ... braggadocious,” Montgomery said. “I remember him telling me: ‘I’m gonna be the heavyweight champion of the world. You watch.’ And I just laughed because he was a skinny kid.”\n\nListening to Montgomery is like listening to Ali himself, had Parkinson’s disease not beset him: the accent, the mannerisms, the heavy-lidded eyes that always seem just on the verge of winking.\n\n“I guess that skinny kid showed me,” he said.\n\nAs a man, Ali would always appear to move without effort, never straining, whether dodging punches or political blows. And some of that was temperament.\n\n“He was always jovial as a boy. Always joking,” Montgomery said.\n\nBut much of that quality – dancing, flickering – came only as the result of intense, long-sustained physical and mental focus. Ali only floated like a butterfly, as he bragged, because young Cassius had plodded liked a mule.\n\n“I worked at the post office, and in the mornings I remember seeing him pull on his old hobnail boots,” Montgomery said. His hand traced a line down the street, following an invisible boy. “He would run to the park and back every day before school. And when the school bus came he wouldn’t get on. He would get his books and run alongside the bus.”\n\nEight miles every day, before school. Then shadow-boxing the old tree, and more running.\n\n“He had...” Montgomery’s eyes roamed for a moment, while he searched for the perfect word to describe the running boy, and everything he became. “He had dedication.”\n\nOn the wall of his home, Montgomery keeps a note Ali signed to “my first boss”. Montgomery had three children, and employed Ali to babysit them. His daughter Linda said she remembered the two parts of Ali’s personality – the playfulness and volume, underlaid by quiet focus.\n\n“Oh, he was funny,” she said. “He made us laugh and laugh.” But when a boxing match came on the Montgomery family television, he would sit the children in front of it to watch, unmoving, studying, until the final bell.\n\nAn oppressive home\n\nAs the radius of the young boxer’s reputation expanded, so did the ferocity of his opponents. On Grand Avenue people grinned and shook their heads, but hoped for his success. The city of Louisville and state of Kentucky, though, were more hostile. The Jim Crow laws were in full effect here, enforcing segregation in every corner of life.\n\nThere’s a story about Ali set in the early 1960s, after his triumph in the Rome Olympics. According to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser it’s not true, and the Muhammad Ali Center presents it as a legend. But it matters that old-timers in Louisville repeat it with the conviction of faith: after his win, Ali was refused a seat at a whites-only diner, and in his disillusionment he climbed a bridge and cast his gold medal into the Ohio river.\n\nPeople here believe that story, polish and cherish that story, because it captures two things that are exactly true. Louisville, and the south at large, was an oppressive home for black people, who had not yet even secured the right to vote. And all of that – the established order, the granters of gold medals and diner seats – would be revealed as a fragile, glass-jawed opponent by Louisville’s brash young man.\n\nHe threw away more than medals, during the Vietnam war, when he refused to register for the draft. Boxing authorities suspended his license for more than three years – three of the most critical, profitable years in a young boxer’s career. Years that, as far as Ali knew, would not end. He could not have predicted history’s eventual view of America’s involvement in Vietnam.\n\n“To be honest we all thought Muhammad was losing it,” his old friend Montgomery said. “It seemed crazy. What is he doing? It since then we have come around to understand it was his passion. Peace.”\n\nAs his radius expanded to encompass the globe, his paradoxical nature revealed itself again. The world’s greatest fighter had an underlying aversion to violence.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon in a plaza outside the Muhammad Ali Center, a crowd gathered to place flowers, hand-drawn pictures, boxing gloves and trinkets at a memorial. One of them was Amal Salom, who was visiting from Iraq and wore a head scarf as she took photos with her iPad.\n\nShe is 58, and said some of the first images she remembers beaming out from her family’s television were of Muhammad Ali in the ring. The sport astonished her – men pummeling each other – but she said her strongest memory of Ali was from 1990, when he visited her country.\n\n“He came to tell my president to not make war with Kuwait,” she said.\n\nShe was referring to one of Ali’s least known achievements, and perhaps his most important. On the eve of the US bombardment of Baghdad, Ali spent time there negotiating with Saddam Hussein, trading stories with a man with an ego to match his own, without the underlying humor.\n\nAfter a week he brought home 15 US citizens Hussein was holding hostage, and delivered them to their families.\n\n“I remember he told us, ‘Peace’,” Salom said.\n\nLawrence Montgomery, Ali’s his old friend and first employer, was right. Not just Louisville. The world."
