        "text": "LOS ANGELE, Cali. — Widely regarded as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time, Muhammad Ali was named “Sportsman of the Century” by Sports Illustrated in 1999. Born Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky, he started boxing at the age of twelve. At eighteen, he took home gold in the 1960 Olympics before going pro. In 1964, he upset Sonny Liston to become the heavyweight champion of the world, converted to Islam, and changed his name. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused to be drafted during the Vietnam War, fighting a draft-dodging conviction all the way to the Supreme Court. His stance against the war and his prominence as a black sportsman during the civil rights era made him a hero to African Americans and the counterculture. His fancy footwork and unorthodox movement made him the world heavyweight champion three separate times between 1964 and 1978, while his brash style and poetic trash-talking influenced hip-hop music. Outside the ring, he was nominated for two Grammys for his spoken word albums. The superstar retired from boxing in 1979 and died in 2016.\n\nMuhammad Ali’s former mansion, a beautiful Italian Renaissance home in a prime Los Angeles location, is set to be auctioned by Concierge Auctions. Built in 1916 by John C. Austin, architect of the Griffith Observatory and LA’s City Hall, the estate exudes charm and grandeur. A stained glass personally designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany tops a collection of priceless architectural features, including antique fireplaces, French Empire chandeliers, and imported Italian marble. Ali owned the home from 1979 to 1984.\n\nStone steps lead up to a European-style façade. Set up for entertaining in style, the mansion’s lower floor features a grand entry hall, a sun room with a glass roof, a spacious salon, an ornate formal dining room, a living room with oversized bay windows, and a den with a wet bar. The estate has hosted a parade of luminaries, including Sylvester Stallone, Clint Eastwood, and President Obama.\n\nUpstairs, find bedrooms and offices, including a massive primary suite with its own fireplace. The suite opens onto a columned deck that overlooks two beautifully landscaped gardens. The park-like grounds include a swimming pool, lush lawns, a pergola terrace, stone fountains, and patios. Sitting on a 1.5-acre corner lot, the 10,500-square-foot mansion and 1,000-square-foot guesthouse are surrounded by privacy hedges and nestled behind the guarded gates of Fremont Place, an exclusive gated community in Hancock Park.\n\nHancock Park is an upscale Los Angeles neighborhood known for its architecturally important homes. A haven for Golden Age celebrities, some of Ali’s neighbors included Mae West, Clark Gable, and Nat King Cole, plus titans of industry A.P. Giannini (founded Bank of America) and King Gillete of Gillete Inc. Contemporary stars who call the region home include Margot Robbie and Fred Savage. Nearby options for entertainment include the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Wilshire Country Club.\n\nPreviously listed for $13.5 million, the estate will be auctioned with a reserve. Bidding will close on May 15. The auction is conducted by Concierge Auctions."
