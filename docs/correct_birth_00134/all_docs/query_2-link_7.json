        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Muhammad Ali training for a fight in the 1970s - the best boxer of all time keeping himself in shape. Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky in 1942. Growing up he still went by his given name, Cassius Clay. In 1964 he converted to Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali. Ali began boxing at the age of 12. His bike had been stolen and he wanted to train so he could give the thieves a good beating one day. He quit school when he was 16 to concentrate solely on boxing. He created a completely new playful and fleet-footed style of fighting.\n\nMUHAMMAD ALI: \"The style, the grace, the boxing, ability, the speed, the footwork, the colorfulness, not exactly clowning.\"\n\nNARRATOR: His most famous quip was float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Ali was never at a loss for words.\n\nALI: \"I'm the champ of the world.\"\n\nNARRATOR: He irritated the general public and his opponents alike with his cockiness. But he is modest and friendly when talking to fans, leaving all traces of boastfulness and arrogance by the wayside. This is the champ as he really is.\n\nMuhammad Ali is courageous outside the ring as well. He uses his fame to tackle political issues. He is a champion of his religion, Islam, but also of peace and African-American causes. In 1984 Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a disorder that attacks the central nervous system, it causes palsy and limits the motor skills and speech functions of its victims. Despite this, the Sportsman of the Century continues to appear in public. He is courageously facing his illness. Muhammad Ali has not lost any of his fighting spirit.\n\nANGELO DUNDEE: \"And he is still the same guy, same kid. It's just we have both gotten old, he knows it and I know it. But we have fun. We enjoy each other.\"\n\nNARRATOR: And the next Ali is ready to go. Ali's daughter Laila has become a professional boxer. And Ali himself can still strike the pose of a world champion pugilist."
