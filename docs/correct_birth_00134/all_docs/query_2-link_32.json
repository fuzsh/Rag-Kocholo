        "text": "Early Life and Career\n\nAli was born Cassius Marcellus Clay in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 17, 1942. He began boxing as an amateur at the age of 12. After advancing through the amateur ranks, he captured a gold medal in the 175-pound division at the 1960 Olympic Games in Rome, Italy. As a professional fighter, he gained immediate fame when he defeated heavily favored Sonny Liston on February 25, 1964, to win the world heavyweight title. After the Liston bout, Clay announced that he had joined the Nation of Islam, and he soon took the name Muhammad Ali. (Ali’s religious views changed over time, and he later adopted Orthodox Islam.)\n\nReturn to Boxing\n\nAli was allowed to return to boxing in 1970. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed his conviction the following year. In New York City on March 8, 1971, Ali lost a 15-round decision to champion Joe Frazier. In a rematch on January 28, 1974, Ali gained a unanimous decision over Frazier, who by then had lost the heavyweight title to George Foreman. Ali regained the title with an eighth-round knockout of Foreman on October 30, 1974, in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). Perhaps the high point of Ali’s career came in a match with Frazier on October 1, 1975, in the Philippines. Ali emerged victorious in the bout, known as the “Thrilla in Manila,” after Frazier’s corner called an end to the fight after 14 grueling rounds.\n\nAli went on to defend his title successfully six more times before losing to Leon Spinks on February 15, 1978. He then won the title for the third time, defeating Spinks on September 15, 1978. Ali retired soon afterward but twice returned to the ring, losing to Larry Holmes in 1980 and to Trevor Berbick in 1981. Ali’s career record stands at 56 wins (including 37 knockouts) and 5 losses.\n\nLater Years\n\nAli’s later years were marked by physical decline. He was thought to have Parkinson disease, which impaired his speech and movement. He remained very active, however. In 1996 he was chosen to light the Olympic flame at the start of the Games in Atlanta, Georgia. From 1998 he traveled widely as a United Nations Messenger of Peace. Ali was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 9, 2005. That month the Muhammad Ali Center, a cultural gathering place honoring the boxer, opened in Louisville. Ali died on June 3, 2016, in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nOne of Ali’s nine children, his daughter Laila Ali, became a professional boxer. She went undefeated in 24 bouts between 1999 and 2007 while capturing a number of titles in various weight classes."
