        "text": "Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., 17 January 1942 - 3 June 2016) was an American professional boxer, activist, entertainer and philanthropist, who was the Heavyweight Champion of the World three times between 1964 and 1979. Nicknamed The Greatest, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated figures of the 20th century and as one of the greatest boxers in history.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nArchie's been living off the fat of the land.\n\nI'm here to give him his pension plan.\n\nWhen you come to the fight don't block the door.\n\n'Cause you'll all go home after round four.\n\nBefore his fight with Archie Moore (1962), as quoted in \"Muhammad Ali was also great for civil rights\" by Mark Wiedmer, in Times Free Press (17 January 2012)\n\nI think Terrell will catch hell at the sound of the bell.\n\nHe's going around saying that he's a championship-fighter,\n\nbut when he meets me he fall 20 pound lighter.\n\nHe thinks that he's the real heavy weight champ\n\nbut when he meets me, he'll just be a tramp\n\nNow I'm not sayin' just to be funny, but I'm fightin' Ernie because he needs the money.\n\nAbout Ernie Terrell before their February 1967 boxing match, as quoted in Ali: The Official Portrait of \"The Greatest\" of All Time (2013) By Nancy J.

That's my obligation to all the people who believe in me. We all have to take defeats in life.\n\nStatement after losing to Ken Norton despite 5-1 odds in his favor (31 March 1973), as quoted by Jeff Johnson in \"Muhammad Ali In His Own Words: Six of His Best Quotes to Live By,\" NBC News (June 4, 2016)\n\nI've got a lot of white associates. Elijah Muhammad, is the one who preached that the white man of America, number one, is the Devil. He's been preaching — he never mentioned England. England's people have never lynched us, raped us, castrated us, tarred and feathered us, burned us up, pulled our sockets apart, stick knives in pregnant women's stomachs, enslaved us, rob us of our names, our knowledge, our — Elijah Mohammad's been preaching that the white man of America – God taught him – is the blue-eyed, blond-headed Devil!

He's got speed and endurance.\n\nBut if you sign to fight him, increase your insurance.\n\nThis kid's got a left. This kid's got a right.\n\nIf he hits you once, you're asleep for the night.\n\nAnd as you lie on the floor while the ref counts ten,\n\nyou pray that you won't have to fight me again.\n\nFor I am the man this poem is about,\n\nthe next champ of the world, there isn't a doubt....\n\nIn \"Round 1: I am the Greatest\", a spoken-word poem in his I Am the Greatest album (1963); audio and transcription on NPR (June 10, 2016)\n\nThe man who views the world at 50 the same as he did at 20 has wasted 30 years of his life.\n\nInterview in Playboy magazine (November 1975)\n\nI hated every minute of it. But I said to myself, 'Suffer now, and live the rest of your life as a champion'.\n\nOn training, as quoted by Pete Axthelm and Peter Bonventre in \"Ali: Born Again!,\" Newsweek (25 September 1978)\n\nAge is whatever you think it is. You are as old as you think you are.\n\nAs quoted in Jet magazine Vol. 58, No. 1 (August 1992)\n\nIf Ali says a mosquito can pull a plow, don't ask how. Hitch him up.\n\nAs quoted in \"Muhammad Ali\" by George Plimpton in \"The TIME 100,\" TIME (14 June 1999)\n\nReligions all have different names, but they all contain the same truths. … I think the people of our religion should be tolerant and understand people believe different things.\n\nWhen asked how he felt about the suspects in the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks sharing his Islamic faith\n\nAs quoted in \"Bush: 'Justice Will Be Done',\" CNN (20 September 2001)\n\nWhat's really hurting me, the name Islam is involved, and Muslim is involved and causing trouble and starting hate and violence. … Islam is not a killer religion. … Islam means peace, I couldn't just sit home and watch people label Muslims as the reason for this problem.\n\nAs quoted by Lisa L. Colangelo and Clem Richardson in \"Muhammad Ali Defends His Religion,\" New York Daily News (21 September 2001), p. 34\n\nI'm retiring because there are more pleasant things to do than beat up people.\n\nAs quoted by Roger Dawson in Secrets of Power Persuasion for Salespeople (2003), p. 192\n\nIt's a lack of faith that makes people afraid of meeting challenges, and I believe in myself.\n\nAs quoted in 101 Best Ways to Get Ahead (2004), edited by Michael E. Angier and Sarah Pond, p. 59\n\nIt's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up.\n\nAs quoted in \"\"Ali's Quotes,\" BBC Sport: Boxing (17 January 2007)\n\nI'm not the greatest; I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out, I pick the round\n\nAs quoted in \"Ali's Quotes,\" BBC Sport: Boxing (17 January 2007)\n\nAllah is the Greatest. I'm just the greatest boxer.\n\nAs quoted in \"Interview with Muhammad Ali\" at SoundVision.com\n\nI'd like for them to say he took a few cups of love, he took one tablespoon of patience, teaspoon of generosity, one pint of kindness. He took one quart of laughter, one pinch of concern, and then, he mix willingness with happiness, he added lots of faith, and he stired it up well, then he spreads it over his span of a lifetime, and he served it to each and every deserving person he met.\n\nResponse to the question, \"What would you like people to think about you when you've gone?\" by George Plimpton at the end of an interview (video)\n\nFriendship is a priceless gift that cannot be bought nor sold, but its value is far greater than a mountain made of gold; for gold is cold & lifeless - it can neither see nor hear, in time of trouble its powerless to cheer — it has no ears to listen, no heart to understand, it cannot bring you comfort or reach out a helping hand. So when you ask God for a gift, be thankful if sends not diamonds, pearls or riches but the love of real true friends.\n\nResponse to Harold Bell, question about his view on friendship in an Interview (video).\n\nI believe in Allah and in peace. I don't try to move into white neighborhoods. I don't want to marry a white woman. I was baptized when I was twelve, but I didn't know what I was doing. I'm not a Christian anymore. I know where I'm going and I know the truth, and I don't have to be what you want me to be...I'm free to be what I want.\n\nResponding to a press conference question as to whether he was a \"card-carrying\" member of the Black Muslims, as quoted in The New York Times (27 February 1964); also quoted in Sports Illustrated (9 March 1964).\n\nI am a Muslim and there is nothing Islamic about killing innocent people in Paris, San Bernardino, or anywhere else in the world... True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so called Islamic Jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion... We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda... They have alienated many from learning about Islam. True Muslims know or should know that it goes against our religion to try and force Islam on anybody.\n\n\"Presidential Candidates Proposing to Ban Muslim Immigration to the United States,\" NBC News (9 December 2015).\n\nInterview with David Frost (1974)\n\n[edit]\n\nDavid Frost: What would you like people to think about you when you've gone?\n\nMuhammad Ali: I'd like for them to say:\n\nHe took a few cups of love.\n\nHe took one tablespoon of patience,\n\nOne teaspoon of generosity,\n\nOne pint of kindness.\n\nHe took one quart of laughter,\n\nOne pinch of concern.\n\nAnd then, he mixed willingness with happiness.\n\nHe added lots of faith,\n\nAnd he stirred it up well.\n\nThen he spread it over a span of a lifetime,\n\nAnd he served it to each and every deserving person he met.\n\nFrom \"David Frost interviews Muhammad Ali (video clip)\", The Frost Interview (16 September 1974)\n\nOn George Foreman and the \"Rumble in the Jungle\"\n\n[edit]\n\nAli's comments related to George Foreman and their famous match, known as the Rumble in the Jungle (30 October 1974)\n\nLast night I had a dream, When I got to Africa,\n\nI had one hell of a rumble.\n\nI had to beat Tarzan’s behind first,\n\nFor claiming to be King of the Jungle.\n\nFor this fight, I’ve wrestled with alligators,\n\nI’ve tussled with a whale.\n\nI done handcuffed lightning\n\nAnd throw thunder in jail.\n\nYou know I’m bad.\n\njust last week, I murdered a rock,\n\nInjured a stone, Hospitalized a brick.\n\nI’m so mean, I make medicine sick.\n\nI’m so fast, man,\n\nI can run through a hurricane and don't get wet.\n\nWhen George Foreman meets me,\n\nHe’ll pay his debt.\n\nI can drown the drink of water, and kill a dead tree.\n\nWait till you see Muhammad Ali.\n\nA poem about Foreman and the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" match (1974)\n\nIf you were surprised when Nixon resigned, just watch what happens when I whup Foreman's behind!\n\nComment prior to the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" (30 October 1974), as documented in When We Were Kings (1996)\n\nYou been hearing about how bad I am since you were a little kid with mess in your pants! Tonight, I'm gonna whip you till you cry like a baby.\n\nTo Foreman before the start of the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" as the referee is giving them instructions (30 October 1974).\n\nThat's the only way you gonna save this sucker. He's doomed.\n\nComment about George Foreman prior to the \"Rumble in the Jungle\" match, when referee Clayton warned Ali that if he didn't stop talking he would stop the fight. (30 October 1974)\n\nOn Joe Frazier\n\n[edit]\n\nAli's comments related to former boxing rival Joe Frazier\n\nI predict that when i meet Joe Frazier. This will be like a good amateur fighting a real professional. This will be like a kid out of the Olympics meeting the fastest heavyweight champion who ever lived.\n\nAt a press conference before Ali vs. Frazier 1:\n\nJoe Frazier is so ugly that when he cries, the tears turn around and go down the back of his head.\n\nAs quoted in \"Ali's Quotes\" at BBC Sport : Boxing (17 January 2007)\n\nFrazier is so ugly that he should donate his face to the US Bureau of Wildlife.\n\nAs quoted in \"Ali's Quotes\" at BBC Sport : Boxing (17 January 2007)\n\nAll kinds of things set us back, but life goes on. You don’t shoot yourself. Soon this will be old news. People got lives to live, bills to pay, mouths to feed. Maybe a plane will go down with ninety people on it. Or a great man will be assassinated. That will be more important than Ali losing. I never wanted to lose, never thought I would, but the thing that matters is how you lose. I’m not crying. My friends should not cry.\n\nPress conference, March 9, 1971, following his defeat to Frazier, quoted in The Intercept, June 6, 2016\n\nThere live a great man named Joe\n\nwho was belittled by a loudmouth foe.\n\nWhile his rival would taunt and tease\n\nJoe silently bore the stings.\n\nAnd then fought like gladiator in the ring.\n\n\"The Silent Warrior\", dedicated to Joe Frazier and his family, p. 112\n\nFor every struggle that Joe survived,\n\nFor every dispute he endured, to rise,\n\nJoe will go down in history\n\nas a model for champions to come. While Frazier was a man of few words, Ali was a world of mouth, but he found his place in history. Now his heart can express him well. Joe Frazier was a silent warrior, whom Ali silently admired. One could not rise without the other.\n\n\"The Silent Warrior\", p. 114\n\nOn Sonny Liston\n\n[edit]\n\nAli's comments related to former boxing rival Sonny Liston\n\nClay comes out to meet Liston and Liston starts to retreat,\n\nif Liston goes back an inch farther he'll end up in a ringside seat.\n\nClay swings with his left, Clay swings with his right,\n\nLook at young Cassius carry the fight\n\nListon keeps backing, but there's not enough room,\n\nIt's a matter of time till Clay lowers the boom.\n\nNow Clay lands with a right, what a beautiful swing,\n\nAnd the punch raises the Bear clean out of the ring.\n\nListon is still rising and the ref wears a frown,\n\nFor he can't start counting till Sonny goes down.\n\nNow Liston is disappearing from view, the crowd is going frantic,\n\nBut radar stations have picked him up, somewhere over the Atlantic.\n\nWho would have thought when they came to the fight?\n\nThat they'd witness the launching of a human satellite.\n\nYes the crowd did not dream, when they put up the money,\n\nThat they would see a total eclipse of the Sonny.\n\nPoem composed in 1963 prior to his match with Sonny Liston, as quoted by Bill Traughber in \"Brash Clay waxed poetic in 1963 visit to Nashville,\" Nashville's The City Paper (4 June 2002)\n\nVariant transcription: Who would have thought, when they came to the fight,\n\nthat they'd witness a launchin' of a black satellite.\n\nThis I predict and I know the score,\n\nI'll be champ of the world in '64.\n\nWhen I say three, they'll go in the third,\n\nSo don't bet against me, I'm a man of my word....\n\nHe is the greatest! Yes!\n\nI am the man this poem's about,\n\nI'll be champ of the world, there isn't a doubt.\n\nHere I predict Mr. Liston's dismemberment,\n\nI'll hit him so hard; he'll wonder where October and November went.\n\nWhen I say two, there's never a third,\n\nBettin' against me is completely absurd.\n\nWhen Cassius says a mouse can outrun a horse,\n\nDon't ask how; put your money where your mouse is!\n\nI AM THE GREATEST!\n\nIn \"Round 1: I am the Greatest\", a spoken-word poem in his I Am the Greatest album (1963); audio and transcription on NPR (June 10, 2016)\n\nI knew I had him in the first round. Almighty God was with me. I want everyone to bear witness, I am the greatest! I'm the greatest thing that ever lived. I don't have a mark on my face, and I upset Sonny Liston, and I just turned twenty-two years old. I must be the greatest. I showed the world. I talk to God everyday. I know the real God. I shook up the world, I'm the king of the world. You must listen to me. I am the greatest! I can't be beat!\n\nAfter defeating Sonny Liston for the first time (25 February 1964), \"Muhammad Ali - I shook up the world\" (video); also quoted in Sound and Fury: Two Powerful Lives, One Fateful Friendship (2007) by Dave Kindred, p. 58\n\nVariant transcription: I'm the greatest thing that ever lived. I'm so great I don't have a mark on my face. I shook up the world.\n\nAs quoted in \"When Clay shook up the world\" (24 February 2004)\n\nOn Vietnam War\n\n[edit]\n\nAli's comments regarding the Vietnam War and draft\n\nMy conscience won't let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America. And shoot them for what? They never called me nigger, they never lynched me, they didn't put no dogs on me, they didn't rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. ... Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail.\n\nRegarding the Vietnam War and conscription (1967)\n\nPart of this is frequently paraphrased out of context as: No VietCong/Vietnamese ever called me [a] nigger, perhaps due to 1968 documentary film with that title, as documented in Nice Guys Finish Seventh: False Phrases, Spurious Sayings, and Familiar Misquotations (1993) by Ralph Keyes and in The Yale Book of Quotations (2006) by Fred R. Shapiro.\n\nI'm not gonna help nobody get something my negroes don't have. If I'm gonna die, I'll die now right here fighting you, if I'm gonna die. You my enemy. My enemies are white people, not Viet Congs or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You won't even stand up for me in America for my religious beliefs, and you want me to go somewhere and fight, but you won't even stand up for me here at home.\n\nRegarding the Vietnam War and conscription (1967)\n\nWhy should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on Brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights? No I’m not going 10,000 miles from home to help murder and burn another poor nation simply to continue the domination of white slave masters of the darker people the world over. This is the day when such evils must come to an end. I have been warned that to take such a stand would cost me millions of dollars. But I have said it once and I will say it again. The real enemy of my people is here. I will not disgrace my religion, my people or myself by becoming a tool to enslave those who are fighting for their own justice, freedom and equality. If I thought the war was going to bring freedom and equality to 22 million of my people they wouldn’t have to draft me, I’d join tomorrow. I have nothing to lose by standing up for my beliefs. So I’ll go to jail, so what? We’ve been in jail for 400 years.\n\nAs quoted in Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties (1999) by Mike Marqusee; also quoted in the International Socialist Review Issue 33 (January–February 2004)\n\nThe Soul of a Butterfly (2004)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Soul of a Butterfly: Reflections on Life's Journey (2004) (written with Hana Yasmeen Ali) ISBN 0743255690\n\nOver the years my religion has changed and my spirituality has evolved. Religion and spirituality are very different, but people often confuse the two. Some things cannot be taught, but they can be awakened in the heart. Spirituality is recognizing the divine light that is within us all. It doesn't belong to any particular religion; it belongs to everyone.\n\np. xvi\n\nWe all have the same God, we just serve him differently. Rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, oceans all have different names, but they all contain water. So do religions have different names, and they all contain truth, expressed in different ways forms and times. It doesn't matter whether you're a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew. When you believe in God, you should believe that all people are part of one family. If you love God, you can't love only some of his children.\n\np. xvii\n\nMy soul has grown over the years, and some of my views have changed. As long as I am alive, I will continue to try to understand more because the work of the heart is never done. All through my life I have been tested. My will has been tested, my courage has been tested, my strength has been tested. Now my patience and endurance are being tested. Every step of the way I believe that God has been with me. And, more than ever, I know that he is with me now. I have learned to live my life one step, one breath, and one moment at a time, but it was a long road. I set out on a journey of love, seeking truth, peace and understanding. l am still learning.\n\np. xix\n\nWouldn't it be a beautiful world if just 10 percent of the people who believe in the power of love would compete with one another to see who could do the most good for the most people? So many of us enjoy taking part in competitions, why not hold a competition of love instead of one that leads to jealousy and envy? If we continue to think and live as if we belong only to different cultures and different religions, with separate missions and goals, we will always be in self-defeating competition with each other.\n\np. xxiii\n\nOnce we realize we are all members of humanity, we will want to compete in the spirit of love.\n\nIn a competition of love we would not be running against one another, but with one another. We would be trying to gain victory for all humanity. If I am a faster runner than you, you may feel bad seeing me pass you in the race, but if you know that we are both racing to make our world better, you will feel good knowing that we are racing toward a common goal, a mutual reward.\n\nIn a competition of love we'll all share in the victory, no matter who comes first.\n\np. xxiv\n\nTo make America the greatest is my goal,\n\nSo I beat the Russians, and I beat the Pole,\n\nand for the USA won the medal of gold.\n\nItalians said: \"You're Greater than the Cassius of old´´.\n\nWe like your name, we like your game,\n\nSo make Rome your home if you will.\n\nI said I appreciate your kind hospitality,\n\nBut the USA is my country still,\n\n'Cause they're waiting to welcome me in Louisville.\n\nPoem written after winning the gold medal in the 1960 Olympic Summer Games in Rome, Italy, p. 35\n\nSince I won't let the critics seal my fate, they\n\nkeep hollering I'm full of hate.\n\nBut they don't really hurt me none, 'cause\n\nI'm doing good and having fun.\n\n\"Still the Greatest\", p. 109\n\nMisattributed\n\n[edit]\n\nHow do you feel about Hitler sharing yours?\n\nAlleged response by Ali to a reporter who asked how he felt about sharing the Islamic faith with the suspects of the World Trade Center terrorist attack, as debunked at Snopes.com.\n\nMy way of joking is to tell the truth.

Impossible is nothing.\n\nWritten by copywriter Aimee Lehto for a series of Adidas ads in which this was superimposed over stills of various figures, including Muhammad Ali.

But when Muhammad Ali decided to be true to his faith and refused to join the Army, the wrath of an entire Republic was visited on his head, he was stripped of his title, and was not allowed to work. In short, his countrymen decided to break him, and it is not their virtue that they failed. It is his virtue.\n\nJames Baldwin, “An Open Letter to Mr. Carter” (1977)\n\nThe big fight is coming up – Ali and Frazier. I call him Muhammad Ali 'cause that's what he wants. Oh, yeah, he's a big dude and he hits hard, you know, I'll call him what he wants. But it's good that he's being allowed to work again, as you know he couldn't work for three years. Of course, he had a strange job, beating people up. But that was his right, he could have that job. The government wanted him to change jobs. The government wanted him to kill people. He thought it over and he said: \"No, that's where I draw the line. Uh, I'll beat 'em up, but I don't wanna kill 'em.\" And the government told him: \"Well, if you won't kill 'em, we won't let ya beat 'em up!\"\n\nGeorge Carlin, Ed Sullivan Show, 1971\n\nI hit him so hard that I made him cry. He looked at me and said, \"I'm going to get you for that.\" I respected him then, and I respect him now.\n\nGeorge Foreman, quoted in \"'Living legend' still commands respect of peers\" by Andrew Baker in The Daily Telegraph (15 January 2002)\n\nClay showed me that I'll get locked up for murder if we're ever matched.\n\nSonny Liston, as quoted in \"Cassius Clay Booed As He Gets Decision Over Jones; No More Forecasts\" by Murray Rose (AP), in The Gettysburg Times (March 14, 1963), p. 5.\n\nClay is a good enough fighter, but it's unfortunate that he's a Black Muslim. A champion should represent all sects, not one.\n\nJoe Louis, as quoted in \"'Living legend' still commands respect of peers\" by Andrew Baker in The Daily Telegraph (15 January 2002)\n\nThe government has failed us; you can’t deny that. Anytime you live in the twentieth century, 1964, and you’re walking around here singing “We Shall Overcome,” the government has failed us. This is part of what’s wrong with you -- you do too much singing. Today it’s time to stop singing and start swinging. You can’t sing up on freedom, but you can swing up on some freedom. Cassius Clay can sing, but singing didn’t help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world; swinging helped him become the heavyweight champion.\n\nMalcolm X, Speech in Detroit, Michigan (12 April 1964)\n\nI'd like to borrow his body for just forty-eight hours — there are three guys I'd like to beat up, and four women I'd like to make love to.\n\nJim Murray, quoted in Sportsworld : An American Dreamland (1975) by Robert Lipsyte\n\nClay is so young and has been misled by the wrong people... He might as well have joined the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nFloyd Patterson, on his involvement with the Nation of Islam, as quoted in \"'Living legend' still commands respect of peers\" by Andrew Baker in The Daily Telegraph (15 January 2002)\n\nUnder the influence of Elijah Mohammad — who preached that blacks should refuse to integrate with \"white devils\" — Ali made a point of dating only black women and lashed out at men and women who engaged in interracial sex. In an interview with Playboy, he declared: \"A black man should be killed if he's messing with a white woman.\" When the interviewer asked about black women crossing the colour barrier, Ali responded: \"Then she dies. Kill her, too.\"\n\nIt's unlikely that a white athlete who made such remarks would receive the praise that Michael Mann heaps on Ali. He says that the fighter \"personified racial pride and self-knowledge\". The Playboy journalist, who interviewed the boxer, was closer to the mark when he observed of his subject: \"You're beginning to sound like a carbon copy of a white racist.\" … The transformation of Ali from a great fighter to a celebrated man of conscience and social purpose has succeeded so well because the actual history of his career has been altered to reflect the kinder, gentler man of today. Unpleasant remarks or facts from the past have been swept away or excused. … A more historically accurate appraisal of Ali would conclude that he was far from heroic outside the ring and was pitifully misused by his masters in the Nation of Islam. For his purposes, Elijah hijacked the impressionable young man's career and filled his head with racist nonsense.\n\nBy the time he finally broke free of the old Nation of Islam, in the 1970s, his career was in its last stages. He continued to fight long past his prime, in part to recover the money and time he had lost in his misadventures with the Black Muslims.\n\nMichael Shelden, in \"Let's not pretend Ali was Gandhi\" in The Daily Telegraph (4 January 2002)\n\nIn the early 1970s Muhammad Ali fought for the heavyweight title against George Foreman. The fight was held in the African nation of Zaire; it was insensitively called the \"rumble in the jungle.\" Ali won the fight, and upon returning to the United States, he was asked by a reporter, \"Champ, what did you think of Africa?\" Ali replied, \"Thank God my granddaddy got on that boat!\" There is a characteristic mischievous pungency to Ali's remark, yet it also expresses a widely held sentiment. Ali recognizes that for all the horror of slavery, it was the transmission belt that brought Africans into the orbit of Western freedom. The slaves were not better off—the boat Ali refers to brought the slaves through a horrific Middle Passage to a life of painful servitude—yet their descendants today, even if they won't admit it, are better off. Ali was honest enough to admit it.\n\nDinesh D'Souza, America: Imagine a World without Her (2014), Ch. 8. Most likely a misattribution. A Newsweek article at the time of the match attributed the quote \"Thank God our grandpappies caught that boat!\" to George Foreman's manager Dick Sadler. \"It Takes a Heap of Salongo\", Newsweek (September 23, 1974), p. 72.\n\nWhen I came to the stage on election night to give my acceptance speech[, a]fter thanking my supporters, I'd said this: \"You know, it was back in '64 that a hero and an idol of mine beat Sonny Liston. He shocked the world. Well, now it's 1998 and the American dream lives on in Minnesota 'cause we SHOCKED THE WORLD!\" Muhammad Ali, then Cassius Clay, had been that hero and idol of mine growing up. I was at the impressionable age of twelve or thirteen, and naturally boxers are the epitome of toughness. Along came Muhammad, who broke the mold, reciting his poetry and predicting in what round he would win. Up until then, athletes were supposed to be modest people who were blessed by the Lord for having these wonderful physical bodies. Now here was this flashy, charismatic young black man proclaiming how pretty he was. Black men in America had never been pretty! [...] I had Clay's record album, I Am the Greatest! I'd memorized it. So I was ecstatic when Liston failed to come out for the eighth round. I always remembered Clay screaming, \"We shocked the world!\" after the fight, and that's all I could think of when I went out for my acceptance speech. Not long after this, I was in the transition office of the Capitol when on my schedule appeared the name Harvey Mackay. [...] Harvey came walking in with a big gift-wrapped box, and I was thinking, \"What the heck could this be about?\" Setting the box down, he said, \"You'd better open that, governor.\" Inside was a pair of red Everlast boxing gloves and, written in magic marker on one of them was: \"To Governor Jesse Ventura—You Shocked the World. Muhammad Ali.\" I was stunned. Harvey told me that Muhammad was watching TV the night I won. Harvey then set it up for us to go visit Muhammad on his farm in Berrien Springs, Michigan. [...] We spent a whole afternoon with Muhammad. It was a dream come true for me to be sitting on a couch with the Champ, creating a friendship. His wife, Lonnie, told me that he'd barely slept the night before, he was so excited I was coming. I was awestruck—Muhammad Ali, excited to see me? As the world knows, Muhammad suffers today from Parkinson's disease. So you do most of the talking, and he answers more with his eyes. We walked out to his gym and got in the ring together. [...] It was there that Harvey talked me into reciting \"I Am the Greatest\" from the record album. [...] I hadn't heard that album for thirty years, but I did the whole thing from memory. Muhammad was standing next to me and, when I finished, I could see a tear in his eye. Isn't it ironic that a white kid from south Minneapolis would have a black Muslim for a hero? Some people have said to me, \"How can you, being a Vietnam veteran, look up to a guy like him who refused induction into military service?\" My response is, \"Because Muhammad is a man who gave up everything for his convictions. He was willing to sacrifice the greatest title in the world for his beliefs.\" You know damned well that Ali would never have seen Vietnam. He'd have done his boxing exhibitions on the military bases. But he wasn't going to play that game. I have tremendous respect for that. Something I noticed when I walked into his home: On a shelf in his living room, in equal prominence, are the Koran and the Bible. Obviously, they both carry a deep meaning for him. I imagine he reads both. For people who don't believe that Ali truly believes, they're wrong. Like I said, he's a man of conviction. Always has been, and always will be.\n\nJesse Ventura, Don't Start the Revolution Without Me! (2008), pp. 60–63\n\nI viewed Ali as the athletic equivalent of Dr. King. He had big love for his people. He had big courage. He thought beyond narrow nationalism and conventional views of patriotism. Mainly, he represented his own view of integrity. He did what he had to do. He spoke the unvarnished truth. When he said that no North Vietnamese had ever called him a nigger, that made sense. When he said he had nothing against the North Vietnamese people, that made even more sense. He had reached the pinnacle of celebrity in the paradigm of American sports, and then turned that paradigm on its head...\n\nCornel West Brother West: Living and Loving Out Loud, A Memoir (2009)\n\nOn 20 June 1967, boxing legend Muhammad Ali was convicted for refusing the draft for the Vietnam war in Houston, Texas. Ali had been a vocal opponent of the US war, saying: “Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs?” To try to quell the escalating resistance to the war, Ali was given the maximum sentence of five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. But their efforts were unsuccessful, and the anti-war movement continued to grow. Despite the Nation of Islam beginning to distance themselves from Ali, demonstrations supporting him took place around the world, from Egypt to Guyana to London to Ghana. Four years later his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court. Ali had no regrets: \"I wasn’t trying to be a leader. I just wanted to be free. And I made a stand all people, not just Black people, should have thought about making, because it wasn’t just Black people being drafted. The government had a system where the rich man’s son went to college, and the poor man’s son went to war. Then, after the rich man’s son got out of college, he did other things to keep him out of the Army until he was too old to be drafted.\"\n\nWorking Class History (2020)\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to:\n\nOfficial website\n\nMuhammad Ali on IMDb"
