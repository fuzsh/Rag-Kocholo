        "text": "There's nothing better than a good ole cheeseburger! It also happens to be something that we as Kentuckians can be proud of. Just like fried chicken and bourbon,\n\nWhile the exact origin is disputed amongst historians, many believe that a restaurant in Kentucky in the birthplace of the cheeseburger. If you ask a Louisvillian, it is an absolute fact that now named 80/20 at Kaelin's, is where the glorious creation took place. Kaelin's also has an interesting connection to the aforementioned fried chicken that is really cool!\n\nKaelin's Restaurant in Louisville, KY\n\nMr. Carl Kaelin and his wife Margaret opened their beloved family restaurant in 1934 in the heart of the Highlands neighborhood. The hamburger existed before then, but one of the two in that dynamic duo thought to put a piece of cheese on it. According to Only in Your State, the original cheeseburger had \"Dusseldorf mustard, American cheese, onions, pickles, and a four-ounce patty on a potato bun.\"\n\nWait, The Colonel Cooked at Kaelin's?\n\nYep! Before KFC was officially Kentucky Fried Chicken on its own, when it first began, Harland Sanders used his secret herbs and spices in the kitchen at Kaelin's serving up the crispy goodness. How awesome is that? That this one restaurant has so much food history associated with it and its right here in Kentucky.\n\nWhere to Eat in Louisville, KY"
