        "text": "Not to be mistaken for the Muhammad Ali who became Muhammad Ali Pasha, Wali of Egypt and Sudan\n\nMuhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was an American boxer. He became one of the most famous boxers in the world with his \"rope-a-dope\" technique. He was also well known for his clever rhymes. In 1999, Ali was named \"Sportsman of the Century\" by Sports Illustrated magazine. He won the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship three times. Ali also won an Olympic gold medal for boxing during the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy. Ali was also known as “The Greatest”.\n\nAli was born in Louisville, Kentucky. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. but changed his name after converting to Islam according to the Nation of Islam in 1965. Because of his Islamic beliefs, Ali would not fight in the Vietnam War when the army tried drafting him. This made him an international figure around the world. Ali retired from boxing in 1981. In the early 1980s, it was learned that Ali had Parkinson's syndrome.[1][2] He became well known for his social work and charity.\n\nMuhammad Ali was married four times. He had seven daughters and two sons. One of his sons was adopted by him.\n\nOn December 20, 2014, Ali was hospitalized for a mild case of pneumonia.[3] Ali was once again hospitalized on January 15, 2015 for a urinary tract infection after being found unresponsive at a guest house in Scottsdale, Arizona.[4][5] He was released the next day.[6]"
