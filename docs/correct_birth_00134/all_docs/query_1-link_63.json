        "text": "Colonel Harland David Sanders (September 9, 1890 – December 16, 1980) was an American businessman, best known for founding fast food chicken restaurant chain Kentucky Fried Chicken® (also known as KFC®) and later acting as the company's brand ambassador and symbol. His name and image are still symbols of the company. The title 'Colonel' was honorary – a Kentucky Colonel – not the military rank.\n\nSanders held a number of jobs in his early life, such as steam engine stoker, insurance salesman and filling station operator. He began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in North Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression. During that time Sanders developed his \"Secret Recipe\" and his patented method of cooking chicken in a pressure fryer. Sanders recognized the potential of the restaurant franchising concept, and the first KFC franchise opened in South Salt Lake, Utah in 1952. When his original restaurant closed, he devoted himself full-time to franchising his fried chicken throughout the country.\n\nKFC® is the world’s most popular chicken restaurant chain, specializing in our famous Original Recipe® fried chicken. It all started with one cook who created a finger lickin’ good recipe more than 75 years ago, a list of secret herbs and spices scratched out on the back of the door to his kitchen. That cook was Colonel Harland Sanders, of course, and today we still follow his formula for success, with real cooks breading and freshly preparing our delicious chicken by hand in more than 20,000 restaurants in more than 125 countries.\n\nAfter more than 75 years of success and innovation, we look forward to serving you and your family our world famous recipes for years to come!\n\nTo learn more about KFC in the US, please visit kfc.com.\n\nthe kfc foundation®\n\nThe KFC® family has a rich history of generosity inspired by Colonel Harland Sanders himself. It started with a hitchhiker who happened to be a college student. The Colonel gave him a ride and a full scholarship.\n\nThat act of kindness inspired the KFC Foundation, which has since provided $20 million to more than 6,400 students and KFC Restaurant employees, assisting them in getting an education, in crisis situations and with personal finance.\n\nOur charitable programs are made possible through the ongoing support of our many franchisees and KFC Corporation.\n\nFor more information please visit kfcfoundation.org.\n\nKentucky Fried Chicken® franchise partners, JRN, Inc., are making a significant investment to renovate and expand the famous Sanders Café KFC located in Corbin, Ky. Major construction will begin this week to update and expand the restaurant and museum, transforming the guest experience for its visitors from all over the world.\n\nWhile the restaurant transformation is expected to take more than nine months, the restaurant plans to remain open throughout construction.\n\nSanders Café, located at 688 Hwy 25 in Corbin, is the birthplace of KFC’s Original Recipe®. It is where KFC’s founder, Colonel Harland Sanders, perfected his secret recipe of 11 herbs and spices more than 75 years ago. That recipe is still served today in KFCs everywhere.\n\nOriginally established in 1937 as a gas station along U.S. Route 25, Sanders Court eventually expanded to include a motel and café where the Colonel offered guests a hot meal and a place to rest along their journey.\n\nKFC franchisees Linda and John R. Neal purchased the Corbin KFC in 1973, and following a renovation, they reopened it as the Harland Sanders Café and Museum on Sept. 9, 1990, which would have been the Colonel’s 100th birthday.\n\nThe restaurant continues to be owned and operated by JRN, Inc., headquartered in Columbia, Tenn. Despite the passing of John R. Neal, JRN remains a family-operated company with his sons becoming second-generation KFC franchisees.\n\n“We grew up in the KFC business and to be the caretaker of the place where it all began is truly special,” said Tyrone Neal, president, JRN, Inc. “We welcome thousands of visitors from all over the world to Corbin each year to see the birthplace of the Secret Recipe, and we want them to have a KFC experience like none other. That’s what this renovation is all about.”\n\nToday, the restaurant features the original Sanders Café dining room, showcases a model of the Colonel’s original kitchen and a replica hotel room. Those elements will keep their historical integrity and receive some updates. Renovation plans also consist of a 3,000 square foot addition, which includes a dining area expansion that will offer seating for up to 132 guests.\n\nPlans for the restaurant’s renovation were entirely custom created to keep the historical integrity of the location while adding additional square footage and expanding memorabilia displays that highlight the history of the place and the KFC brand."
