        "text": "If you'd like to live in the home of The Greatest, now you've got your chance.\n\nMuhammad Ali's mansion in Louisville is back on the market, up for sale with a cool $1.95 million price tag. The house was taken off the market last year, when it was going for $2.2 million. According to Zillow.com, the house listing was removed on Oct. 2 of last year and put back up about two weeks ago on May 1.\n\nThe 9,304-square-foot mansion at 6717 Elmcroft Circle in Prospect includes five bedrooms, eight total bathrooms – six full and two half – and a pool on a 1.9-acre lot.\n\nMore Ali: Could Muhammad Ali's boyhood home end up in Philadelphia or Las Vegas?\n\nAlso: KO'd? Muhammad Ali boyhood home museum shuts down\n\nAccording to a previous article in Courier Journal, the home was under title to Lama LLC, an entity headed by Lonnie Ali, widow of the three-time heavyweight boxing champion and humanitarian who died in June 2016. It bought the estate for $1.875 million in 2006 and was listed by Semonin Realtors agent Jennifer Carroll.\n\nThe Alis stayed at the residence only occasionally, spending most of their time at a home in Phoenix, where the weather was better for Muhammad Ali's failing health."
