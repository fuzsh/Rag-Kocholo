Clay began training when he was 12 years old and at the age of 22, he won the world heavyweight championship against Sonny Liston (1964). After Clay converted to Islam, he changed his \"slave\" name to Ali, signifying racial pride for African Americans and resistance to white domination.",

But Malcolm X, the most famous minister in the Nation of Islam, saw the potential in Clay, not just for boxing greatness, but as a means of spreading the Nation's message. The two became fast friends, keeping their interactions secret from the press for fear of jeopardizing Clay's career. Clay began living a double life - a patriotic \"good Negro\" in public, and a radical reformer behind the scenes. Soon, however, Malcolm X and Clay's friendship would sour, with disastrous and far-reaching consequences.
