        "text": "Transcript\n\nSEAN CALLEBS: He's always been as brash as he was brilliant.\n\nMUHAMMAD ALI: I am the greatest.\n\nCALLEBS: Muhammad Ali is considered by most to be the greatest of all time, a heavyweight fighter who was amazingly agile in the ring. The only thing faster than his lightning punches was his wit.\n\nALI: 15 times I've told the clown what round he's going down, and this chump ain't no different. He going to fall in eight to prove that I'm great.\n\nCALLEBS: Ali at age 22, when he was still known as Cassius Clay, on the eve of fighting and defeating the highly favored Sonny Liston to win the heavyweight crown for the first time. But Ali's most protracted fight was against the United States government. After converting to Islam and changing his name, Ali refused induction into the US Army after being drafted, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the US involvement in the war.\n\nREPORTER: Clay left the induction center to the cheers of supporters chanting, if he don't go, we don't go.\n\nALI: My intention is to box to win a clean fight. But in war, the intention is to kill, kill, kill, kill, and continue killing innocent people.\n\nCALLEBS: The late Bert Sugar was one of boxing's legendary journalists.\n\nBERT SUGAR: I don't remember anybody except maybe Nathan Hale, who stood up one man against an entire government. Hale was hanged, Ali was acquitted by the Supreme Court.\n\nCALLEBS: Indeed, Ali was eventually vindicated. But the US legal battle robbed the champ of his prime. At this point in his life, Ali was regarded as the best-known athlete in the world. He was wildly popular in China. Anywhere he traveled, Ali was seemingly always shoulder-to-shoulder with fans and the always present media.\n\nALI: I told you, all of my critics. I told you all that I was the greatest of all time. When I beat Sonny Liston, I told you today, I'm still the greatest of all time.\n\nCALLEBS: Ali's greatest rival was arguably Smokin' Joe Frazier. Their third and final bout, dubbed the Thrilla in Manila, is considered one of the greatest fights of all time. Ali won by a TKO when one of Frazier's trainers stopped the fight in the 14th round. But Ali's critics and his doctors believe Ali stayed in the sport he loved too long. The horrific beating he took at the hands of Larry Holmes is largely blamed for advancing his Parkinson's disease.\n\nLARRY HOLMES: You know, of course I didn't want to hurt him because I knew I could beat him because I had learned his style over the years.\n\nCALLEBS: Ali had fame after leaving the ring, lighting the Olympic torch to signal the start of the '96 summer games in Atlanta. But the years of abuse had taken its toll.\n\nALI: I received my fame from being controversial. All my life, since growing up as a little boy, I always said if I could get famous, I'd do things to help my people that other people won't do.\n\nCALLEBS: Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. His daughter Layla became a boxer in 1999.\n\nLAILA ALI: His intention in life has always been to give back and to give to others and make sure that this world is a better place than it was when he first got here.\n\nCALLEBS: Muhammad Ali was forced to curtail his public appearances in the last few years, as his health declined. But he was always a big draw. And he remained the greatest. Muhammad Ali dead at 74. Sean Callebs, CCTV, Washington."
