        "text": "If you've driven through Louisville, chances are you've noticed a few massive, somewhat-faded portraits lining the sides of multiple buildings.\n\nSome of the faces are easily recognizable, such as boxing legend and humanitarian Muhammed Ali, whose image has been on a building overlooking the Ohio River for two decades. Others might not be quite as familiar to out-of-towners.\n\nAll of the portraits are the product of the Hometown Heroes program, which was launched in 2001 and run by the Greater Louisville Pride Foundation. It put up 31 of the vinyl, banner-style images over the years.\n\nHometown heroes: Louisville has honored 'hometown heroes' with a banner since 2002.

The most recent person to be honored was the late Enid Yandell, a sculptress who designed the Daniel Boone statue near Cherokee Park.\n\nBut who are those people on the banners?\n\nIn many cases they are native Louisvillians, and in some cases they are people who have ties to the area.
