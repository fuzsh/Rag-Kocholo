        "text": "(born: 1942 - died: 2016)\n\nBorn in Louisville, KY as Cassius Clay, he was the son of Marcellus and Odessa Grady Clay. In 1964 he joined the Nation of Islam and changed his name to Muhammad Ali; he is also referred to as \"The Greatest.\"\n\nAli won the light heavyweight gold medal as a member of the U.S. Boxing Team at the 1960 Olympics in Rome, Italy. He was taken to California by his lawyer, Alberta O. Jones, to train under Archie Moore. Jones, a Kentucky native, also established a trust fund for Ali, who was an exceptional boxer with great promise.\n\nAli's career included 56 wins in 61 bouts with 37 KOs, and he was three-time heavyweight champion of the world. Ali was honored as Sportsman of the Century in 1999.\n\nFor more see the University of Louisville research guide Muhammad Ali: A Transcendent Life: Home; King of the World, by D. Remnick; and see photos and video at The Official Muhammad Ali website. Muhammad Ali died June 3, 2016 in Phoenix, AZ.
