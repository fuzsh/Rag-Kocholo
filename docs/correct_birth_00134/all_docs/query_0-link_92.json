His father’s occupation was painting. When Cassius was 12 years old, he told a police officer that his bicycle had been stolen and said that if he found the thief, he would get his right. The officer, whose name was Joe Martin, taught boxing to children at a small local club. That’s why he told him that if he wants to fight a thief, he should learn boxing first.\n\nThis is how he entered the boxing ring very soon. This 12-year-old child made significant progress in learning boxing under the supervision of his coach Martin. By the time he entered high school in Kentucky, he had won six titles. Because of these honors, the school officials ignored his grades and poor academic status and issued a graduation certificate.\n\nThe beginning of the sports life of Muhammad Ali Keli:\n\nIn the 1960 Rome Summer Olympics, he won the amateur boxing gold medal in the light heavyweight category, and then continued his professional boxing training under Angelo Dundee, and at the same time, he revealed his religious beliefs. At the same time, his unexpected and stunning results in the competitions, and his tireless spirit, had earned him the title of Louisville’s female boxer.\n\nOn October 29, 1960 in Louisville, Cassius Kelly defeated Tony Hunsacker, who was the police chief of Fayetteville, East Virginia, in his first professional bout in six rounds.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1963, this young fighter knocked out his opponents in 15 breathtaking matches. People like Tony Sporti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Doc Sabdang, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willie Basmanoff and Lamar Clark, who had more than 40 decisive victories in his prime.\n\nPerhaps Kelly’s most exciting and proudest achievement during that era was the victory over Sonny Banks, Alejandro Lavrente and Archie Moore who had an impressive record of 200 victories. Although both Banks and Lavrante were killed in other matches after this, Kelly only claimed the title against Sonny Liston. The confrontation with Sonny Liston was a competition that all boxers talked about with fear and a boxer as young as Kelly had not been able to defeat him and win this title.\n\nMohammad Ali Kelly, Mohammad Ali Kelly, biography of Mohammad Ali Kelly\n\nBiography of Mohammad Ali Kelly\n\nPersonal life of Mohammad Ali Kelly\n\nMuhammad Ali married Sunji Roy in 1964 and they divorced in 1966. He married Belinda Boyd in 1967, then divorced her in 1977. After that, he married Veronika Porsche in 1986. Yolanda was his last wife who married in 1986 and lived with him until the end of his life.\n\nMohammad Ali Kelly has 7 daughters named Leila Ali, Maryam, Rasheda, Jamila, Hana, Mia and Khalila, as well as two sons named Mohammad Ali Jr. and Asad Amin.\n\nIn addition to heavyweight boxing matches and winning numerous honors, another reason that made Cassius Kelly famous was that he converted to Islam in 1962, after meeting Elijah Muhammad (politician from the United States of America).\n\nAfter converting to Islam, he changed his name to “Muhammad” and his last name to “Ali” and declared that one of the most important events he experienced in his life was changing his name to “Muhammad Ali”.\n\nIn 1966, he refused to join the US Army to fight against Vietnam and declared that he would never fight against his fellow men in Vietnam. This issue was on everyone’s lips for a long time! But it caused him to be banned from participating in boxing matches for 5 years and his boxing license was also suspended.\n\nOf course, it should be noted that after some time, his ban was reduced to 3 years. The court also sentenced Mohammad Ali to 5 years in prison for the crime of refusal and desertion, but he did not go to prison by paying a guarantee.\n\nMuhammad Ali’s return finally after many struggles\n\nIn 1970, Ali was once again allowed to participate in ring boxing. With the help of a state senator, he got permission to box in the state of Georgia. Ali defeated Jabri Kvari in this province. Shortly after this competition, he was allowed to continue competing in New York by the Supreme Court of New York. Ali faced Oscar Bonavena in December 1970 and after 14 breathtaking rounds, he managed to defeat his opponent in the 15th round. This victory paved the way for Ali to participate in the final match and fight with Joe Frazier.\n\nAli was so powerful in boxing that he was the only person who could win the heavyweight title three times in a row. He had also won 14 different championships in 35 years. He is the only person who was recognized as champion of the year by The ring magazine six times in a row. Also, in 2012, he was recognized as the best boxer in the history of the world and the best athlete of the 20th century. His honors are many and we will limit ourselves to these few.\n\nMuhammad Ali’s matches are full of excitement and he has fought with powerful and famous boxers of that time, but the most important of them is the match between Muhammad Ali Kelly and Joe Fraizer, which is known as the thrill in Manila, and his fight with Gorge Foreman, which is known as the rumble in the jungle. He noted that the second fight is known as the top sporting event of the 20th century, breaking the record of 1 billion simultaneous television viewers.\n\nAfter his professional boxing career, he appeared successful in other activities such as sports. After some time, he started doing things like acting and writing, and he was more involved in cultural and charity work.\n\nMuhammad Ali’s farewell to the world of sports and life\n\nWith 56 victories, 37 knockouts and 5 defeats, Mohammad Ali Kelly officially said goodbye to the exciting world of boxing on June 27, 1979 and announced his retirement.\n\nHe suffered from Parkinson’s syndrome in 1982, despite the fact that the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease were quite evident in Muhammad Ali, but he won the honor of lighting the Atlanta Olympic torch in Georgia, USA. Mohammad Ali Kelly finally passed away at the age of 74 on June 3, 2016 at the Arizona Hospital.\n\nMohammad Ali Kelly, Mohammad Ali Kelly, biography of Mohammad Ali Kelly\n\nBiography of Mohammad Ali Kelly\n\nOther people’s opinions about Muhammad Ali\n\nMalcolm X (Civil Rights Activist on Kelly-Liston Race): Kelly wins. He is the best “black uncle” athlete I know and he is becoming more popular with his fans than Jackie Robinson.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr., civil rights activist: He spent millions of dollars doing what his conscience told him was right.\n\nJoe Frazier, Muhammad Ali’s opponent after the Manila bout: Boy, I’d have punched him that would have brought down the city wall. God, God, he is a great hero.\n\nGeorge Foreman, former heavyweight boxing champion of the world: I wouldn’t call him the greatest boxer of all time. He is the greatest man I have ever seen."
