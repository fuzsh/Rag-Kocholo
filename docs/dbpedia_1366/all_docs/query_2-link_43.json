        "text": "TAMPA — Sharron Laverne Parrish Jr., the man accused of scamming Apple Stores out of nearly $310,000 by fooling clerks into taking depleted debit cards, was sentenced Friday to nearly five years in federal prison.\n\nParrish, who has 4 cents in his Pinellas County Jail commissary account, was ordered to pay $312,748.99 in restitution, a sum that includes proceeds of similar scams at two hotels and a car rental company.\n\nHe could have reduced his 57-month sentence by helping authorities build a case against a suspected accomplice, but did not. He feared retaliation, attorney Adam Allen told U.S. District Judge Susan Bucklew.\n\n\"He's scared to do it,\" Allen said. \"That's the bottom line.\"\n\nParrish, 25, spoke briefly, his soft voice quavering.\n\n\"I'm very sorry to bring this to the court,\" he told the judge. \"It's embarrassing to me and my family.\"\n\nHe turned his eyes to a cluster of women in the back of the courtroom and said, \"To my grandmother that raised me, loved me and guided me, I especially want to apologize.\"\n\nParrish entered into a plea agreement in September admitting to one count of wire fraud.\n\nThe Secret Service alleged that Parrish hit Apple stores in 16 states. When his debit cards were declined, he pretended to call his bank, then provided clerks with fake authorization codes.\n\nHe also persuaded a Hilton hotel in Tampa, a Westin in Seattle and an Enterprise car rental agency to accept his overrides.\n\nThe specific codes didn't matter. They were simply a way for clerks to document that approval had been given.\n\nHis defense attorney said Parrish wasn't sophisticated enough to do all that on his own. He has a history of getting caught up in the plans of people who claim to care for him, Allen said.\n\nIn explaining Parrish's fear of retaliation, Allen said his client had suffered physical abuse his whole life. Details were not made public. Allen wrote a confidential memo to the judge.\n\nThe federal prosecutor, Mandy Reidel, acknowledged that Parrish's personal history was \"horrendous and tragic.\"\n\nBut she pointed out Parrish's successes with Apple clerks. He didn't seem scared to her.\n\n\"He outsmarted them, outwitted them and likely outcharmed them,\" she said.\n\nStore clerks weren't the only ones susceptible.\n\nThe prosecutor said Parrish was getting a haircut when agents arrived to arrest him.\n\nHe asked them to let him finish the haircut.\n\nThe agents agreed.\n\nHe ran out a back door, Reidel said, and wasn't found for weeks."
