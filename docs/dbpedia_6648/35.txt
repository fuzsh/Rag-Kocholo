Fighter’s abilities are represented in fifteen categories and the overall style of the fighter is crucial when matching up fighters in the ring. Some also have additional personalised attributes.

The program allows one-off exhibition fights to be created and replayed. It also provides a sandbox universe mode where you set up a series of fight nights with automatic recording of ranking lists and title holders.

There is also a career mode where you take a fictional or retrograded real fighter and guide them from the start of their career to hopefully World Title glory. Along the way you build reputation, mould your fighter’s abilities, and navigate the tricky path of opponents and ‘real-life’ issues.

The demo comes with 16 heavyweights and allows you to fight the first five fights of a single fighter career.
