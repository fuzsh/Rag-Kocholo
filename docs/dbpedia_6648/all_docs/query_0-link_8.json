        "text": "Info\n\nDeveloped/Published By: Survivos\n\nPlatforms Available On: PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and Xbox One\n\nReviewed on Xbox Series X.\n\nA code was very kindly supplied for the purpose of this review.\n\nOverview\n\nDo you have what it takes to be a Champion? Step into the ring in Big Rumble Boxing: Creed\n\nChampions to show off your boxing skills in a knockout arcade experience. Don the boxing\n\ngloves of legends like Adonis Creed and Rocky Balboa, or fight as one of 18 other iconic\n\ncharacters from the Creed and Rocky universe.\n\nChallenge your friends and family in local multiplayer mode, where you can flex your hard-hitting boxing moves in intense, head-to-head matches. Or, practice your boxing moves in classic Creed and Rocky training montages and take on world-class opponents across a variety of thrilling locations, as you follow each character‚Äôs unique story.\n\nGameplay\n\nI personally love a good arcade boxer and feel like we‚Äôve been without one for quite a while now, step up Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions basically all my dreams come true a boxing game filled to the brim with characters from the Rocky/Creed films.\n\nAlthough the game is filled with Rocky characters and iconic venues it isn‚Äôt a Rocky game, it feels more of a respectful nod at the icon as it pushes the arcade feel.\n\nThe game comes with the standard modes both single and two player with a very solid single player campaign which I found enjoyable, with lots of big over the top special moves. But on the slight downside I was slightly disappointed that the cutscenes are cartoon stills with subtitles, I would‚Äôve loved to have seen a bit of a proper cutscene giving more depth to the story.\n\nThe gameplay is addictive as you can unlock different characters throughout your journey if you can defeat them and definitely brings that ‚Äújust one more game‚Äù vibe, also the feeling of playing out some iconic matches from the films such as Rocky vs Drago and that feels so good.\n\nThe game really comes into it‚Äôs own when you hit the multiplayer, it brings so much fun to the game especially in the couch co-op side of things, playing boxing games exactly as they should be.\n\nGraphics and Sound\n\nYou honestly can‚Äôt knock the graphics, for me the devs have definitely hit the nail on the head going for a slightly cartoon style but with a realistic feel and I love the over the top arcade feel throughout.\n\nThe soundtrack is as you would expect it to be iconic and littered with big bass tunes, the in game sounds are good but for example when you play as Rocky he says the same thing everytime he wins, his iconic Adrian line, although great to hear would‚Äôve been nice to hear something else every now and then.\n\nSummary\n\nTo summarise my thoughts on Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions, it‚Äôs a big arcade fighter with lots on offer, although it has its flaws I still thought it was a great game to play and will continue to do so.\n\nVerdict ‚Äì Out of 5üåü\n\nüåüüåüüåüüåü\n\nExcellent\n\nI give Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions a solid 4üåü a great arcade fighter with lots on offer, well worth checking out if you like fighting games not just the Rocky fans."
