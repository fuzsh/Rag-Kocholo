        "text": "Boxing video games allow players to experience the thrill of the ring without risk of injury. Since the 1980s, developers have tried to digitally recreate the sweet science of pugilism, with varying degrees of success.\n\nWhile boxing games are not as prevalent as they once were, there are still great options for PC gamers in 2023. Whether you want a hardcore simulation, arcade-style action, or an intense VR workout, the current crop of boxing titles deliver.\n\nIn this guide, we highlight the 7 best boxing games you can play on PC right now.\n\n1. Undisputed (Early Access)\n\nBest For: Hardcore boxing simulation\n\nStill in early access, Undisputed aims to be the most realistic digital boxing experience ever created. Developed by Sheffield, UK-based Steel City Interactive, Undisputed utilizes the Unreal Engine to power its lifelike visuals and physics-based gameplay.\n\nThe striking mechanics are incredibly nuanced, with over 70 possible punch combinations accessible via the control scheme. Slipping, bobbing, weaving, parrying, clinching, and applying effective footwork are all critical to winning matches. No boxing game has captured the sweet science more authentically.\n\nUndisputed’s roster features over 50 licensed boxers, including greats like Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Roberto Duran, and Julio Cesar Chavez. You can take control of these legends in their primes, or create your own custom fighter and take them from amateur events to world title glory. Promoter, manager, and training modes round out the experience.\n\nDespite some expected early access bugs, Undisputed shows tremendous promise. Developer Steel City Interactive actively incorporates community feedback to make enhancements. If you want the closest thing to lacing up the gloves and stepping into the ring, Undisputed is a knockout.\n\nPros\n\nIncredibly realistic boxing mechanics\n\nMassive roster of licensed legends\n\nVisually stunning with smooth animations\n\nCons\n\nStill in development so has some issues\n\nCan be punishingly difficult for casual players\n\n2. Creed: Rise to Glory\n\nBest For: VR boxing experience\n\nCreed: Rise to Glory brings sweat-inducing, heart-pumping boxing action to room-scale VR. As the name suggests, the game is set in the cinematic universe of the Rocky/Creed films. You can train with Rocky Balboa himself, or go toe-to-toe with famous faces like Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, and Apollo Creed.\n\nGameplay revolves around dodging and parrying incoming blows while tactically exploiting openings in your opponent‘s guard. Punches are thrown by realistically jabbing, hooking, and uppercutting with the Touch controllers. Duck under haymakers or dance around the ring, and you’ll quickly work up a sweat.\n\nThe campaign puts you in the gloves of underdog Adonis Creed, fighting your way from amateur bouts all the way to the world championship. Beyond career mode, there are several multiplayer options to test your skills against human opponents. Customization lets you decorate your virtual gym and boxers.\n\nWhile the VR visuals are somewhat basic, the responsive controls and adrenaline-fueled action make Creed: Rise to Glory the most immersive and athletic boxing game around. Just be ready for some sore muscles the next day!\n\nPros\n\nGreat VR implementation with motion controls\n\nFaithful to Rocky universe with iconic fighters\n\nWorkout-worthy physical intensity\n\nCons\n\nMultiplayer can suffer from lag\n\nBasic visuals don’t fully impress\n\n3. Fight Night Champion\n\nBest For: Legacy boxing gameplay\n\nFirst released in 2011, Fight Night Champion still stands as the high point of EA Sports‘ boxing series. Although it‘s over a decade old, the gameplay, graphics, modes, and overall presentation hold up remarkably well, especially after applying community patches.\n\nUnlike the ultra-complex Undisputed, Fight Night Champion features more accessible controls that still provide a great balance between offense and defense. The analog stick mimics your boxer‘s fists to jab, hook, and uppercut with ease. The roster contains past and present pros, including Manny Pacquiao, Miguel Cotto, and Andre Ward.\n\nFight Night impresses out of the ring too. An in-depth career mode sees your created boxer rise up the ranks, training and participating in press conferences along the way. The underrated Champion mode delivers an engrossing story campaign. And the graphics, animations, and damage modeling still look great.\n\nWhile the online components no longer function, Fight Night Champion remains the best single-player boxing experience on PC. From sweat-flying ring action to training minigames to legacy appeal, it‘s a knockout.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent gameplay balance\n\nIn-depth career and story modes\n\nVisuals hold up incredibly well\n\nCons\n\nNo multiplayer options\n\nDLC no longer available\n\n4. Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions\n\nBest For: Arcade-style action\n\nA spiritual successor to the Punch-Out series, Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions delivers over-the-top arcade boxing action. Featuring a cel-shaded comic book style, Creed Champions lets you play as Rocky Balboa, Adonis Creed, Apollo Creed, Ivan Drago, Clubber Lang, and more.\n\nGameplay revolves around stringing together combos while making effective use of rolls, blocks, and perfectly-timed punches. Opponents telegraph their attacks, so pattern recognition and quick reflexes are rewarded. Matches are fast-paced, frantic battles filled with slow-mo close-ups of knockout blows.\n\nIn addition to exhibition bouts, there are 30 challenging story fights that recreate iconic moments from the films. Up to 4 players can Duke it out locally or online. Visually, Creed Champions nicely captures the look and spirit of the movie franchise.\n\nThose seeking a realistic boxing simulation should look elsewhere. But if you grew up with arcade classics like Punch-Out!! and Ready 2 Rumble, Creed Champions will satisfy your appetite for over-the-top pugilistic action.\n\nPros\n\nPerfect for quick pick-up-and-play sessions\n\nFun combat system with special moves\n\nLocal and online multiplayer\n\nCons\n\nVery little depth compared to sims\n\nStory mode completion unlocks could be better\n\n5. The Thrill of the Fight (VR)\n\nBest For: VR fitness\n\nLooking to burn some calories and work up a serious sweat? Lace up your virtual gloves and enter The Thrill of the Fight. This VR boxing game prioritizes tiring, physical gameplay over fancy graphics and modes. And the resulting workout experience is incredible.\n\nHolding Touch controllers in a tight boxer‘s guard, you‘ll be slipping punches, bobbing your head, and throwing combos at a rapid pace. With limited stamina, the pacing demands constant movement and tactical shot selection. Opponents hit hard and fast, so keeping your guard up and managing distance is imperative.\n\nMatches take place in a simple virtual gym with no bells and whistles. But compelling gameplay makes The Thrill of the Fight endlessly replayable. Attempting to climb the leaderboards against more challenging opponents will leave your arms burning.\n\nIf you want to elevate your heart rate in VR while having fun, The Thrill of the Fight is your best bet. Just make sure there‘s nothing breakable nearby, as dodging often necessitates real lateral movement!\n\nPros\n\nAmazing VR workout experience\n\nRequires true boxing technique\n\nAddictive progression system\n\nCons\n\nVery basic visually\n\nWon‘t appeal to non-fitness focused players\n\n6. eSports Boxing Club (Early Access)\n\nBest For: Multiplayer focus\n\nThe newcomer eSports Boxing Club aims to be the premier competitive online boxing game. Still in early access, the game‘s rounded visuals and slick animations already impress. The physics-based gameplay delivers complex mechanics with an accessible control scheme.\n\nESBC contains licensed fighters from multiple weight classes, including Tyson Fury, but focuses on creating your own pro and taking them into the competitive ranks online. Options like Custom Championships and Fight Now ease matchmaking, while in-depth training prepares you for heated exchanges.\n\nSince it‘s built as an eSport from day one, online play is silky smooth. Quick jabs and explosive counters feel satisfying to land against human opponents. Stat-tracking and future ranked modes should up the stakes.\n\nWhile solo offerings feel light currently, the foundation for greatness is here. Once ESBC gets more modes, boxers, and progression systems, it could become a top contender. Even in early access, the multiplayer competition is highly engaging.\n\nPros\n\nSuper smooth online with great netcode\n\nAccessible but deep mechanics\n\nVisually impressive models and animations\n\nCons\n\nCareer mode needs more depth\n\nSmall fighter roster currently\n\n7. Real Boxing 2\n\nBest For: Mobile gaming\n\nAmong surprisingly few quality mobile boxing options, Real Boxing 2 stands out. With intuitive touchscreen controls and plenty of gameplay variety, it‘s one of the better sports titles on Android and iOS.\n\nReal Boxing 2 contains different control schemes tailored to touch devices. The virtual buttons and swipes work well for dodging, blocking, and punching. Arcade, career, and multiplayer modes offer diverse ways to play, with RP progression incentivizing fights.\n\nDeveloper Vivid Games made sure Real Boxing 2 looks great on mobile. The boxers and environments showcase plenty of details. Matches attempt to mimic TV broadcasts with replays and audio commentary. There‘s even a \"dynamic wounds\" system where bruises, cuts, and swelling will appear on fighters.\n\nFor a mobile game, Real Boxing 2 has impressive depth. Fans of fight night looking for quality action on the go would do well to lace up and enter the ring.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent production values\n\nGood variety of modes\n\nIntuitive touchscreen controls\n\nCons\n\nImproved opponent AI would be nice\n\nCan feel repetitive over time\n\nWrapping Up\n\nThanks to refined mechanics and new platforms like VR, there are great options for digital pugilists in 2023. Whether you’re looking for complex simulations, explosive arcade action, or an intense workout, quality boxing games are available for PC gamers.\n\nFor the best overall package, Undisputed currently leads the way with its uncompromising realism and extensive legacy roster. But Creed: Rise to Glory and The Thrill of the Fight make great use of VR, while Fight Night Champion holds up strong as a beloved classic.\n\nNow grab your favorite set of virtual gloves and start training for your next bout! Just watch out for tko-inducing body blows and make sure to keep that guard hand glued to your chin."
