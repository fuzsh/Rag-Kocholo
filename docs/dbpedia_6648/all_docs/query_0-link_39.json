        "text": "While it's a huge game, there are many coveted features missing at the moment. Who knows what will come in the future though. So is there a Hogwarts Legacy multiplayer mode? Outside of unofficial modding, you might be disappointed.\n\nWe'll discuss further below.\n\nThis article is part of our free Hogwarts Legacy walkthrough guide. To unlock your complete companion to the game.\n\nMore like this\n\nDoes Hogwarts Legacy have multiplayer?\n\nNo, Hogwarts Legacy does not have a multiplayer mode or co-op support.\n\nThe developers confirmed on the game's official Frequently Asked Questions page, \"Hogwarts Legacy is a single-player experience and does not have online or co-op gameplay.\"\n\nSome players may still hold out hope, though. After all, it isn't unheard of for a game to launch as a single-player title only to add multiplayer support later on.\n\nFor example, Ghost of Tsushima was a solo outing until its post-launch Legends DLC came out, allowing players to team up with each other some time after the game's original launch.\n\nHowever, we wouldn't recommend holding your breath for Hogwarts Legacy multiplayer, considering that the FAQ page was very clear about the developers' single-player intentions.\n\nThat being said, surprises do happen â€” we wouldn't have predicted a Hogwarts Legacy Switch release, for example, but that has now been confirmed.\n\nThe lack of multiplayer has gotten Potterheads working, however, with chatter of a fan mod already floating around the internet.\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time fans have modded a multiplayer mode into a previously single-player game, as The Sims 4 and Just Cause 2 are two famous examples that received a popular multiplayer mod.\n\nSo while we may not be getting an official multiplayer mod, there's a good chance fans might just do it themselves if you're on PC, if you meet the Hogwarts Legacy PC requirements!\n\nIf you are looking for a Harry Potter adventure where you can explore Hogwarts with a friend, remember that the LEGO Harry Potter games exist and they allow you to do exactly that. You can buy those games below if you don't already have them.\n\nAre there companion characters in Hogwarts Legacy?\n\nYour experience of Hogwarts Legacy will not be a totally solitary experience, though, with several non-player characters (NPCs) first revealed in the game's lengthy new trailer, which we've embedded for you below.\n\nThe FAQ page confirms: \"Some students at Hogwarts will become friends. As players grow these relationships, these schoolmates will become companions who can accompany players on their journey, expand their abilities and open up as players learn their stories.\"\n\nThere is also an array of Hogwarts Legacy beasts that feature in the game. The FAQ page confirmed that you can \"tame, mount and ride\" a number of these animals, which should help to stave off wizarding loneliness as well.\n\nWhat can you expect from Hogwarts Legacy gameplay?\n\nIn lieu of multiplayer, the Hogwarts Legacy developers have put a lot of effort into making this a compelling gameplay experience with plenty of things for players to do.\n\nThe game starts as you customise your character's appearance via the Hogwarts Legacy character creator and choose your Hogwarts house, before getting pulled into a mystery involving a goblin rebellion and a number of dark wizards.\n\nYou can also attend classes, learn spells and level up your abilities, as well as upgrade your gear and grow magical plants to aid you in battle. You might not be playing with other players, then, but you'll certainly be busy!\n\nHogwarts Legacy launched on 10th February for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, with older consoles getting the game later in the year.\n\nYou can pre-order the game from Amazon or the retailer of your choice, or read more with the links below:\n\nHogwarts Legacy release date - staggered launch explained\n\nHogwarts Legacy cast - Simon Pegg and more\n\nHogwarts Legacy quidditch - did it make the cut?\n\nHogwarts Legacy common rooms - tour all four\n\nWho is Phineas Nigellus Black? Sirius ancestor explained\n\nHogwarts Legacy year - when is it set?\n\nHogwarts Legacy wand customisation - does it matter?\n\nHow long is Hogwarts Legacy? Game length revealed\n\nHogwarts Legacy Deluxe Edition - price for early access\n\nHungry for more gaming?
