        "text": "Side view semi-RPG. It was a hit in its day. The game is actually quite interesting. You can choose to be a mage or a warrior. There are levels, with each level increasing your health and attack power, and the mage sometimes gets a new spell. In the shop you can buy equipment, life potions and antidotes. All potions are automatically used when needed. If you run out of HP, the life potion will be used automatically. The game is difficult, not very long, but interesting. There is the possibility to play together. Together is more fun!\n\nCal Ripken Jr. - is an American baseball player who played shortstop and third base for 21 seasons in Major League Baseball. Due to the lack of a licence, there are no MLB team names, stadiums or illustrations, and Cal Ripken Jr. himself is the only non-fictional player in the game. There are two game modes, Exhibition and League. In Exhibition, players can choose an indoor or outdoor field, natural or artificial turf, which affects the gameplay, artificial turf being faster. There are 16 teams in League mode.\n\nYou play as Captain Addis, a former American Army officer from the Vietnam War. Now, twenty years after the end of the war, you are on a mission to follow Ho Chi Minh's trail and rescue American pilots stranded on the home front. The game is a run'n'gun with an overhead view. As you move around the screen and rotate it in different directions, you shoot at enemies, although the direction of the shot may not be the same as your direction of movement, i.e. you can move backwards and forwards and shoot at enemies who are chasing you. Enemies include not only soldiers armed with rifles, flamethrowers and grenade launchers, but also tanks and helicopters. You can find ammo and supplies by smashing crates. You can also drop bonuses from defeated enemies.\n\nQuite an interesting game. You control a group of soldiers who have to carry out missions. Basically it is about eliminating enemy soldiers and buildings. The number of soldiers you have for each mission is limited and you can't lose them (at least not all of them). Soldiers get new ranks for successful missions. The graphics are average, but the music is not bad and the action is dynamic. Single player game.\n\nThe game is based on the cartoon series about a team of teenagers under the auspices of the earth spirit Gaea who have been given magical rings, each of which gives them the ability to control the elements - water, fire, earth, air and the fifth element is considered to be the heart (such a nice cartoon). With their help, they resist environmental terrorists and save the Earth from pollution and disaster. By combining the power of the rings, they can summon a powerful superhero - Captain Planet, but while he is active, the power of the rings does not work. Unfortunately, the game's implementation is rather primitive - we attack with elements as simple projectiles, and then only a little play for the mighty Captain. The graphics could also be better. Nevertheless, fans of the cartoon series will be able to enjoy the game.\n\nMickey Mouse is up to his eyeballs in adventure once again. The sorceress Mizrabel has kidnapped his friend Minnie, and to rescue her you must collect six magic gems (Sonic, hello). To attack enemies from above, press jump twice or jump+down. You can find throwing balls or apples. The game is not easy: you have to memorise some moments and the whole game has only 2 continuations. Nice graphics and pleasant music. Fans of platform games and Disney cartoons will like it.\n\nTwo of your heroes - John Morris, armed with a whip, and Eric Lecarde, wielding a spear - are on a campaign to destroy evil. This time the campaign takes place across Europe. The spear is longer than the whip and helps you jump higher, but the whip can be used to strike diagonally in the air and cling to the ceiling. Slaughter hordes of undead and collect vials, which replace hearts here, and useful weapons. There are bosses, of course. As is often the case, the Japanese version is easier - using the password will update the number of sequels.\n\nHistorical and strategic game based on the events of the Roman Empire. The game is quite difficult to master, but fascinating in its plot and in the execution of the tasks set before you. You will have to conquer many states in different ways, lead your country, suppress rebellions and much more.\n\nYou control a mystical creature that looks more like a reanimated dead man. He is armed with two swords, but as the game progresses you will be able to find and use other weapons. Your character moves between locations and fights all sorts of monsters. The graphics in the game are quite good and the music is very decent. Single-player game with three levels of difficulty.\n\nIt's a beautiful game. A bit like Mario. The main character is a kid who can turn into a knight, a samurai, a tank and God knows what else. The music is great, the gameplay is not bad, and there are lots of levels to play at your leisure.\n\nTo say that this is a world class football simulator is probably a lie. Choose from 32 national teams from around the world. You can play a friendly match or a tournament, and there is also a two-player mode. The game's graphics are weak. The players themselves tend to bunch up and try to do something with the ball. Although football fans can give it a try.\n\nSome citizens took the game Boogie Woogie Bowling, slightly modified the characters and inscriptions in the game - and here you have bowling. Or maybe it was the other way round. Who knows, who knows... Anyway, the point is the same - hit pins with balls and that's it. Game for 1-2 players. Japanese version with animations: Boogie Woogie Bowling\n\nClassic pool. The game is well made, at least it reflects the basic aspects of billiards. You can practice, take part in a tournament or play against another player (according to your own rules). The graphics and music are not bad.\n\nToy truck racing. The graphics seem to be nothing, but there is nothing special in the game. There are useful things scattered around the tracks, but the main thing is not to finish last. Of course, it is better to be the first, for which prizes are awarded. Single-player game.\n\nThis thing is amazing! We are put in the role of a policeman. Race down the long highway to find the bandit and ram his car. We have three cars to choose from - a sports car, a jeep and a truck. The graphics are good, but the sound makes you want to switch on Slayer or Paradise Lost, because it is impossible to listen to this squeaking and grinding. And so the game will give you a lot of pleasure! Japanese version: Super HQ\n\nRemaking an existing game is nothing new. This game is a variant of Boxing Legends of the Ring, except that the star of the title is J.C. Chavez. They added a little Spanish and that's it. Otherwise the game is the same - you can have your own fight or tournament, create your own character and go through the career of a professional boxer. The game is for 1-2 players.\n\nThe game is based on Warner Bros. cartoons. The animation in the game is just amazing! The sounds and music are good too. We play a mouse whose girlfriend has been stolen by a cat. Of course, Speedy rushes to rescue her, saving other rodents along the way. The hero can run fast and throw sombreros. The game is fun and goes by quickly. Great for fans of similar cartoons and the Wild West."
