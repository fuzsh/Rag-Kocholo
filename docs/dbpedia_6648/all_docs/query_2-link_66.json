I have been playing the game first when it came out, and when i saw the game i saw great potential. The first thing that i noticed in the last update is that itâs less realistic with the customization, for example i can be playing an exhibition match and iâll be fighting with a guy with a pineapple hat, a chicken costume, rainbow hair, and some clown shoes, itâs pretty unrealistic right? many people have been asking for an online mode which i would recommend you adding. I really like the little thing you added when people called you out, i wish that happened more often though. I REALLY REALLY like the 2d style of the game and the mechanics of all the different moves. Now for the different games, i wish you could do some new games knowing that you only have one up AND is a masterpiece. i wish you could add a ufc type style of game or wwe type of game. OR EVEN A STREET FIGHTING GAME, THAT WOULD BE MAGNIFICENT. this is a dumb idea but thinking of all those games with the 2 d style i canât resist saying that you should have an army game with guns. you have a lot of potential for your style of games. goodbye.\n\nmiguelHD_Q ,\n\nPerfect Game before major mechanic change\n\nI was very excited for this new big update since this game hadnât been updated in a while I was excited for multiplayer and new skins and legends to fight. That being said before the update that changed the mechanics of fighting I wouldâve rated this game a 4.5 as it was as close to perfect all it needed was updates that didnât change the aspect of the fighting game I started and loved. Im not saying this update ruined the game by any stretch of the meaning but before the update I mean I was already three 100 pro fight retired boxers with 300+ exhibitions deep and I knew exactly how my character moved when I stepped forward and backward hitting perfect leaping uppercuts and hooks. Setting myself in the corner hitting the body going upstairs and hitting beautiful combinations. That being said now that the update changed the mechanics of how the boxers move in the ring I feel like theyâre almost stuck in the mud I canât hit these moves Iâd hit before and the momentum of punching seemed to have gone to the floor & I just feel like the game lost what I loved so much about it. I guess Im more of a wacky rag doll physics type but the way they moved made sense before they didnât look stupid and it was fun. Fast forward to now, I barely touch the game and I wish Iâd go back to the physics it had before I still love the game Iâd recommend it to my friends but I can feel the difference like night and day."
