        "text": "Despite launching all the way back in 2022, Nintendo Switch Sports is about to get another major update, as Nintendo gets ready to add a brand new activity to the game. Unveiled during the recent Direct conference, the Nintendo Switch Sports Basketball update has a July 9 release date. There's no official launch time, although based on past first-party game updates, fans can expect Basketball to be added to the game at around midday UK time. Better yet, the brand new Basketball mode isn't part of a paid expansion pack, but will instead be available as a free download. Judging by the gameplay reveal further down the page, it's a pretty extensive new game mode, featuring multiple ways to play, both solo and online.\n\nThe Basketball update features multiple game modes, including two-on-two matches with motion controlled shooting and dribbling.\n\nThese 2v2 matches can be played in single-player, as well as in local and online multiplayer.\n\nArguably even better is the solo Three-Point Challenge, which hearkens back to Wii Sports Resort.\n\nThis can also be played locally with up to four players in Five-Streak Battle or Three-Point Contest.\n\nIf you want a closer look at the new game modes, then check out the Nintendo Switch Sports Basketball trailer below.\n\nIf you don't already own a copy of Nintendo Switch Sports, then you can grab a copy of the game from the Nintendo eShop for Â£30.99.\n\nIn this case, however, it might be worth buying a physical copy, which comes with the leg strap accessory.\n\nThe leg strap can be used to to take penalty kicks in the Football game mode. Simply insert the Joy-Con into the strap, attach it to your leg and start shooting.\n\nOther Nintendo Switch Sports game modes include Volleyball, Badminton, Bowling, Tennis and Chambara.\n\nThat's on top of the Golf mode, which was actually added more than six months after the launch of the game, also as a free update.\n\nThe game itself is very similar to Wii Sports, using Joy-Con motion controls instead of the classic Wii Remote.\n\nOf course, if you do want to play online, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online account, which also provides access to dozens of retro games.\n\nThis includes NES classics, Super Nintendo titles and old-school Game Boy releases. Then there's the more expensive Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack, which adds N64, Sega Mega Drive and Game Boy Advance games."
