        "text": "The following video games contain either a career mode, a superstar mode, or a be-a-pro mode. Each of these modes play in a similar manner; the only main difference is the wording of the title and the game objectives. Players are permitted to play as a single athlete throughout their entire career as opposed to playing an entire team at once. However, some video games have a option to play an entire team at once like Cricket 19."
