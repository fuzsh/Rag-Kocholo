        "text": "It’s time to get the party started with Call of Duty®: Mobile Season 10 — 4th Anniversary. The Atlas Corporation’s global summit is taking place on Memnos Island, where the rich and powerful come to kiss Atlas’ ring. Meanwhile, Operators are infiltrating the party to access the secret lab hidden below.\n\nThe new season is all about celebrating with the return of The Club and the introduction of the new class-based Ground War: Breach on Memnos Island. Get in on the masquerade-themed Battle Pass, pilot the new Gunship Scorestreak, unlock new weapons and more when Season 10 — 4th Anniversary launches on November 8th at 4PM PT.\n\nThe 4th Anniversary Pass features free and premium items, including new Operator Skins, Weapon Blueprints, Calling Cards, and additional COD Points (CP) to spend on your next Premium Pass or Store purchase.\n\nBattle Pass Free Tiers\n\nEarn the new Gunship Scorestreak at Tier 14, a high-flying and devastating Streak offering three different types of fire so you can tackle all kinds of threats. At Tier 21, unlock the new Bruen MK9, an air-cooled, open-bolt LMG featuring a steady rate of fire and excellent stability in mid- to long-ranged encounters. Other free Tier highlights include a variety of Camos and Weapon Blueprints.\n\nPremium Pass Tiers\n\nPurchase the Premium Pass for the chance to earn all of the content available in the 4th Anniversary stream, including masquerade-themed Operator Skins like Ether — Bird of Paradise, David Mason — Maestro, Domino — Nocturne, and Beatrice — Midnighter.\n\nPack some serious firepower for the battles ahead using Weapon Blueprints like the RUS-79U — Killer Motley, the Krig 6 — Venetian Metals, the HS2126 — Triumphant Beat, the DL Q33 — Crystal Chandelier, and the Bruen MK9 — Bird of Paradise, based on the new Season 10 weapon.\n\nBattle Pass Subscription: Enlist with the Ground Forces by purchasing a Battle Pass Subscription, granting extra rewards each season along with a 10% boost to Player and Weapon XP, discount coupons, plus limited discounts on 10x crate pulls.\n\nSeason 10’s Ground Forces rewards include the Francis — Dark Opulence Operator Skin, the RPD — Enchanted Evening Weapon Blueprint, and the Backpack — Evening Enchantment.\n\nExperience the Next Level of Ground War\n\nPrepare for a whole new way to play Ground War in the new Ground War: Breach. In this new 16v16 Multiplayer mode, teams take on the role of either the attackers or the defenders on the new Memnos Island map made specifically for the new mode.\n\nAttackers: The attacking team wins by capturing and pushing through all objective points. Starting with only your initial base spawn, you and your team must move up and continue to claim capture points.\n\nDefenders: Keep back the enemy team using any means necessary. In Ground War: Breach, a captured point cannot be retaken, so every new capture made by the attacking team gets them closer to victory. Keep them back and protect the points until the timer runs out to win the match.\n\nVehicles: Use vehicles to navigate the map more quickly and expand your attacking options, including the Tank, Anti-Air Tank, Attack Helicopter, and more.\n\nChoose Your Class, Earn Class XP\n\nGround War: Breach features a career progression system in which players choose a class before deploying into the match.

Head into battle with the Healing Machine, which creates a mist that continuously heals teammates within range.\n\nInfiltrator: Get behind enemy lines with this infiltration specialist equipping with theTac Deploy, an item that creates a spawn point on the map for you and your team when planted.\n\nTechnician: Take on an engineer’s role and disable enemy tanks using the FHJ-18 Secondary Weapon to destroy enemy vehicles before they can threaten your position.\n\nSingle-Player Mission\n\nBefore heading into Ground War: Breach, first complete a new single-player campaign mission on Memnos Island. This scripted solo mission will introduce you to the larger 4th Anniversary narrative as you battle Reaper robots controlled by the Director across the island. Players must complete the campaign mission before deploying into Ground War: Breach.\n\nWelcome to Memnos Island\n\nOriginally featured in Call of Duty: Mobile’s first anniversary celebration, The Club returns for the 4th Anniversary with new content and spaces to explore like the dance floor and boxing ring. The Club features an entertainment area and bar where players can interact with NPCs, other players, and participate in minigames. Players can also party up for matches with other Operators in the Club.\n\nPlay the minigames to earn Club Tokens, which can be exchanged for rewards.

Make sure the knife doesn’t stab the hand.\n\nDarts: Play a classic game of darts.\n\nBoxing: Get into the boxing ring with another player.

Also available to earn is a Legendary version of the new Season 10 Nail Gun alongside a variety of new Skins and other cosmetic items.\n\nOther Season 10 Draws include Operator Skins like Synaptic — Archon Rex and Nyx — The Venetian, along with Legendary Weapon Blueprints like the Arctic .50 — Venetian Scope, the Outlaw — XXX, the FFAR 1 — Pharoah’s Words, and the Bruen MK9 — Deadly Strings, based on a new Season 10 weapon.\n\nBattle Pass Vault: The Vault will be updated for Season 10, featuring Battle Pass content from Season 8 2021: 2nd Anniversary; Season 10 2021: Shadow Returns; and Season 11 2021: Final Snow.\n\nEarn the Epic Operator Skins you missed during those seasons, such as Price — Bravo 6, Atlas — Crash, and Templar — Unredeemed, as well as Weapon Blueprints like the CR-56 AMAX — Tattered Shot, the Man-O-War — Wolf’s Mane, and the LK24 — Vanquished."
