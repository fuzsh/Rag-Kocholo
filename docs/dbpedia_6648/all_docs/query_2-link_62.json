        "text": "Boxing/video game fans are as thirsty as an out-of-shape heavyweight in the final 30 seconds of a grueling 12-round fight. It doesn't appear as though EA Sports, 2K, Sony or Microsoft have any plans of touching the sweet science any time soon, so independent developers are the only hope for virtual pugilists.\n\nThe last boxing game released was Fight Night Champion back in March 2011 for the last generation of consoles. FNC has a favorable 86 Metacritic score and many still speak fondly of the now six-year-old title. Despite the game's cult following, EA seems more inclined to nurture its UFC series.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, the decision makes sense for EA.\n\nA publisher/developer as large as EA doesn't do small projects. In order to make it a big project, EA would need to gain a license to the biggest names in the sport. In boxing, that's a huge undertaking because there is no union license to acquire that would uncover the access to all of the desirable fighters.\n\nEA has the financial means to pay every fighter of any interest, but would the game sell enough units and garner enough microtransactions to make the licensing investment worth the publisher's while?\n\nPerhaps, but EA doesn't need to take those kinds of risks. They have sure things like Madden, FIFA, and NHL.\n\nThe dynamic is different for an independent developer. The expectations are lower across the board. Subconsciously, I don't expect indie games to be as visually impressive as the titles that come from major publishers. I don't expect as much depth and I certainly don't look for any indie sports game to have the same level of licenses.\n\nMy educated guess is that those lowered expectations are shared by most gamers. When we get games as outstanding as Rocket League, it's a pleasant surprise.\n\nI think I speak for all boxing video game fans when I say: I'm ready for an independent developer to take a swing at the sweet science.\n\nKeys to Success\n\nFun Balance Between Arcade and Ultra-Sim Gameplay\n\nMost hardcore boxing fans want an ultra-realistic boxing video game that doesn't dumb down any of the sport's characteristics to appeal to a larger audience. Truth is, that's not the smartest way to approach development.\n\nWe live in a world with customizable experiences and gaming companies are beginning to offer different modes within a game to attract larger audiences. Madden 18 will have an arcade and competitive gaming mode. I'd suggest a boxing title have a similar setup.\n\nGamers who simply want to slug it out should be able to, and those who want an experience that is as close to the real thing as possible–without getting punched in the face–should have the same access. That should be the primary objective of the gameplay.\n\nCustomization\n\nAn in-depth fighter customization tool is necessary for any sports game these days, but it's especially important for an indie boxing game without major fighters licensed. From the smallest to the biggest, sports video game communities fill in the gaps created by a lack of licensing in their favorite titles.\n\nPro Evolution Soccer creators do their best to make up for the exclusive licenses that Konami lacks. NBA 2K creators go to work to add legends and college players that the game cannot include for legal reasons. Fans of an indie boxing video game would have to do the same.\n\nIt's important they have the tools to make anyone–real or fictitious–that they want.\n\nesports And Overall Depth\n\nIf at all possible, it would behoove any game developer to explore the possibilities of their title becoming an esports event. This doesn't fit every game, but it would ideal for a boxing title. Developing an esports-friendly game means working hard to eliminate elements that remove the competitive balance.\n\nThat means no overpowered fighters, moves or characteristics. There's always post-release updates to fix unforeseen issues, but there's less ground to cover if the developers were thinking esports from the beginning.\n\nA career mode is another important mode to deliver. Realistically, it doesn't have to be as sophisticated as FIFA's The Journey, but something that features a solid challenge and a different experience from head-to-head play.\n\nLastly, the servers must be strong. Online would probably be the most popular way to play a boxing title. As a new title, one of the toughest shortcomings to overcome would be less than reliable servers that kill the online experience.\n\nIf that's not working well, it's the equivalent of trying to bounce back from a 10-8 round in the first frame.\n\nThis Can Be Done\n\nBoxing isn't going to drive the same crowd that football, basketball or baseball does, but the interest is there–especially for an indie developer who doesn't need to make the same killing to call their project a success. When you remove the cost of acquiring licenses, there should be even less cost to develop.\n\nThere are groups of fans campaigning for a boxing video game.\n\nIt's surprising that no indie developer has taken the plunge. There was a Kickstarter for a group trying to develop a boxing manager game called Ring Kings back in 2013, but that campaign has fallen by the wayside. A manager title is mildly interesting, but it wouldn't be as successful as a full-action boxing game.\n\nHopefully, there's an indie developer/boxing fan who is reading this and getting inspired."
