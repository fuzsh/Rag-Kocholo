        "text": "Every punch, every jab, every uppercut has never felt as real as it does on the PS5. The boxing games available on the platform are phenomenal, and I've spent countless hours getting lost in the immersive gameplay that they offer. Here, I'll be sharing with you my personal top boxing games on the PS5. These are the games that I just couldn't put down, the ones that made me feel like I was right in the ring, trading blows with the best of them.\n\n1. Creed: Rise to Glory\n\nThe first punch lands on Creed: Rise to Glory. Inspired by the epic movie franchise, this game is a knockout in every sense of the word. The mechanics are exceptionally well-crafted, making every fight a test of skill and strategy. Creed offers a fantastic career mode where you get to navigate the ups and downs of the boxing world, as well as a multiplayer mode that's always buzzing with competition. I've spent countless nights on this game, and I can tell you right now, it's a must-have for any boxing enthusiast.\n\n2. Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions\n\nNext on the list is Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions. It's more arcadey in its approach but don't let that fool you. The gameplay is just as deep and satisfying. Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions offers a fantastic blend of fast-paced combat with strategy, requiring you to think on your feet. There's a great range of customization options for your boxer, too, which adds an extra layer of fun and immersion. I've lost track of the number of times I've customized my fighter to look like the boxing legend, Muhammad Ali. But what truly sets Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions apart, in my opinion, is its multiplayer mode. This game truly shines when you're in the ring with a friend, exchanging blows and dodges in a test of reflexes and strategy. It's absolutely thrilling to land a perfectly timed counterpunch or to duck under a wild swing, and the game's cartoonish graphics give these moments a light-hearted but still intense feel. It's a game that's easy to pick up but hard to master, and that's what makes it so addictively fun.\n\n3. Fitness Boxing 2: Rhythm & Exercise\n\nThis isn't your typical boxing game, but it makes the list because it's just too much fun to pass on. You get to box to the beat of some fantastic tunes, and the game doubles up as a great workout. The motion tracking is top-notch, and it's always a blast to see how well you've done after each workout. I've used this game on numerous occasions to sweat it out, and trust me, it's worth every penny. So yes, if you're looking for a boxing experience that is incredibly entertaining and gives you a good run for your money in terms of physical fitness, you cannot go wrong with Box VR. Not to mention, it's a unique addition to your PS5 game collection that definitely stands apart from the traditional boxing games.\n\n4. The Thrill of the Fight\n\nIf you're looking for a boxing game that offers a realistic VR experience to boot, then The Thrill of the Fight is the perfect pick for you. This game is a treat for those who wish to feel the adrenaline rush of a real boxing match, without the physical bruises, of course.\n\nYou might be wondering, \"What makes it stand out from the rest?\" Well, its focus on realism is what sets it apart. The game recreates the physicality of boxing to perfection. The opponent's AI is well-crafted, allowing for a challenging and rewarding boxing experience. It's not just about quickly mashing buttons; instead, it requires strategy, precision, and timing on your part, much like in a real boxing match.\n\nI also appreciated the fact that The Thrill of the Fight offers a great workout. After each match, I found myself panting and drenched in sweat, much like after a vigorous gym session. So, if you're looking to mix fun and fitness, this game might just be your perfect companion.\n\nHowever, I feel it's important to mention that this game might not be everyone's cup of tea. It's a pure boxing simulation, so don't expect any flashy moves or power-ups. But if you're someone who appreciates the sport in its rawest form and wants to experience it in the virtual world, then The Thrill of the Fight will not disappoint you.\n\nOverall, this is a game that truly lives up to its name, offering the real thrill of a boxing fight. It's an excellent addition to the PS5's roster of boxing games, and I would highly recommend it to any boxing enthusiasts out there.\n\n5. Knockout League\n\nThe fifth game on my list, is the one and only Knockout League. I'm talking about an arcade-style boxing game that tests your skill, timing, and reaction like no other. Don't be fooled by its cartoonish appearance, this game has a lot more depth than you would initially expect. It's all about using your reflexes to dodge, block, and throw punches at the right moment.\n\nIn my personal experience, Knockout League provides not just hours of gaming fun, but also an intense workout. You'll find yourself ducking and weaving, throwing punches, and breaking a sweat in no time. It's an exhilarating experience that keeps you on your toes and makes you feel like you're really in the ring.\n\nThe game features a diverse roster of opponents, each with their own unique fighting style and personality. You'll have to learn their patterns and adapt your strategy on the fly. This adds a layer of strategy and depth that I really appreciate.\n\nIt's hard to beat the feeling of dodging a powerful punch at the last second and then landing a satisfying knockout blow. The graphics, though not the most realistic, are bright and colorful, and the sound effects are spot on.\n\n6. EA Sports UFC 4\n\nLet's step into the octagon with UFC 4. Now, I know what you're thinking - this isn't strictly a boxing game. However, I've included UFC 4 on this list because of the depth it offers when it comes to striking mechanics, and believe me, it's something you would want to try.\n\nIn UFC 4, the boxing elements are as good as, if not better than, some dedicated boxing games. The level of detail is outstanding, the motion capture of the fighters is spot-on, and the punches feel weighty and impactful. I can't tell you the number of times I've been on the edge of my seat, fending off a barrage of punches or throwing a last-ditch knockout punch.\n\nEA Sports UFC 4, while not solely focused on boxing, offers a realistic and immersive boxing experience.\n\nMoreover, UFC 4 offers a robust career mode where you can create your own fighter and work your way up the ranks. The creation suite is incredibly detailed, allowing you to customize every aspect of your fighter's appearance and fighting style. From the way they walk to the octagon, to their signature victory celebration, everything can be personalized to your liking.\n\n\"Playing through the career mode feels like you're living the life of a professional fighter, and the choices you make outside the octagon are equally as important as the ones you make inside it.\"\n\nWhat sets UFC 4 apart from the other games on this list is the diversity of fighting styles. However, if you're a boxing purist, you can choose to focus solely on your boxing skills, and let me tell you, going toe-to-toe with an opponent in the octagon using just your fists is a challenge worth undertaking.\n\n7. Undisputed\n\nI have to say, Undisputed was a real eye-opener for me. Now, it's not strictly a boxing game. It encompasses the whole world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) but that doesn't mean it skimps on the boxing aspect. In fact, I would argue that it gives a more comprehensive boxing experience than some of the dedicated boxing games out there.\n\nFirst off, the gameplay is simply top-notch. I was really impressed with the realistic physics and the attention to movement mechanics. Every punch, jab, uppercut, and dodge feel incredibly authentic. It's like you're in the Octagon yourself, throwing punches and ducking blows.\n\nThe graphics are also something to write home about. The character models are detailed and lifelike, making the fights even more engrossing. I can't tell you how satisfying it is to see your opponent's face wince in pain when you land a solid right hook.\n\n8. Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 – The Official Video Game\n\nLet's not forget about the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 – The Official Video Game. While it's not a dedicated boxing game, it does feature boxing as one of the main events you can participate in, and trust me, it's worth mentioning.\n\nThe graphics on this game are smooth and detailed, making the experience feel very real. The boxing event, in particular, features a great balance of strategy, skill, and luck, just like the real sport. You have to manage your stamina, time your punches, and read your opponent’s movements, making it a challenging and rewarding experience.\n\nAs I played the game, I felt as if I was representing my country in the actual Olympics. The adrenaline, thrill, and excitement were palpable.\n\nI found the controls to be intuitive and responsive, which is always a big plus in any game, but especially in a fast-paced sport like boxing. The online mode is also a blast, allowing you to box against players from around the world. It's truly a global competition, just like the Olympics themselves.\n\nOne thing that I really love about this game is the variety. Sure, you're here for the boxing, but why not try out some of the other 17 sports available? It’s a great palate cleanser after an intense boxing match, and it extends the lifespan of the game tremendously.\n\nHowever, I must be honest and say that the boxing mechanics in this game are not as detailed or complex as in a dedicated boxing game. But don't let that discourage you; the fun factor is absolutely there, and it's a great way to introduce yourself or others to the sport of boxing.\n\n9. Box VR\n\nFinally, let's talk about Box VR. Now, if you've been hunting down a boxing game that combines fitness with fun, then Box VR is your perfect match. It's a game that has taken the fitness aspect seriously, and in my experience, it's a joy to have a boxing game that can give you a proper workout while keeping you thoroughly engrossed.\n\nThe game offers an immersive VR boxing experience, allowing you to punch your way through various rhythms and beats. My personal favorite is the workout mode, which has an array of punch combinations that are synced with the beat of the music. Trust me, it's a fun and sweaty way of burning calories while getting that adrenaline rush.\n\nAnd talk about variety! You wouldn't believe the number of workouts available in the game – over 100. They range from short, high-intensity bursts to longer, endurance-testing sessions. It's a feature I greatly appreciate, as it gives you the flexibility to tailor your workout to your fitness goals.\n\nAnother thing I really enjoyed was the game's multiplayer mode. It's one thing to work out alone, but competing with friends in real-time takes the excitement to a whole new level. The leaderboards are a great addition, too, injecting that competitive spirit which makes you want to push harder.\n\nIt's a lot more than just a game - it's a fun, immersive workout tool that I've come to rely on for my daily fitness fix."
