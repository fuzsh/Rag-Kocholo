        "text": "Welcome to Big Shot Boxing!\n\nExperience the thrill of boxing right in your browser, no installation needed. Perfectly compatible with Chromebook computers, this game offers a seamless gaming experience.\n\nStep into the ring as a boxer and embark on a career journey like no other. Whether you're a professional or an amateur, you'll have the chance to compete in intense matches and work your way up to claim prestigious titles.\n\nWhat sets Big Shot Boxing apart is its unpredictability. With just one lightning punch from your opponent, victory or defeat can turn on a dime. Get ready for heart-pounding moments as luck and randomness play a role in every match.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick and exciting way to experience the world of boxing, Big Shot Boxing is the game for you. Put on your gloves, step into the ring, and let the action begin!\n\nBig Shot Boxing Game Guide\n\nKeyboard Controls\n\nRight Arrow: Jab Left Arrow: Cross X: Uppercut Z: Block\n\nNote:\n\n- When you are knocked out (KO), you must press the Spacebar quickly to avoid being counted out by the referee for 10 seconds. Failing to do so will result in forfeiting the match.\n\n- This web version is not compatible with touch screen devices; it can only be controlled using a keyboard and mouse.\n\n- Use the jab to move forward and back up your opponent. It doesn't score points and does very little damage\n\n- Use the uppercuts and the cross to score points and damage your opponent. Uppercuts cause the most damage\n\n- Hold the block button down to block punches. Tap the button to move backwards.\n\nPlay Distraction-Free\n\nSay goodbye to interruptions! Big Shot Boxing provides a seamless gaming experience with no ads to disrupt your focus. If you want to immerse yourself fully, simply hit the fullscreen button and enjoy the game without any distractions. This feature ensures that you're completely engaged in the boxing action.\n\nUnveiling Lesser-Known Information\n\nIn the world of boxing, unexpected dynamics come into play:\n\n- The tide of a match can be turned by the loser with a single, well-timed punch. - Achieving titles at the age of 29 poses significant challenges due to the intense competition. - Boxers typically retire by the age of 46, considering the physical demands of the sport. - The browser version of Big Shot Boxing at Bigshotboxing.github.io differs from the mobile version in several aspects: On a mobile device, when stunned, you can immediately regain control of the boxer; however, on the browser, there's a brief delay. - Sometimes, despite launching numerous attacks, a match cannot be won due to a single opponent's well-placed strike. This could be due to their resilient chin, an element that you might lack. Random factors also contribute, as the next bout could see you taking down an opponent with your opening punch.\n\n- The game's pugilist avatars can be traced back to the realm of authentic boxing legends. For instance, in the game, the character Jesus Sanchez pays a distinct tribute to the illustrious Manny Pacquiao, while Gerard Steele emulates the legendary Mike Tyson. Mikkel Nielsen embodies the essence of Ivan Drago, Joseph Kotey captures the spirit of Joshua Clottey, Roddy Savage reflects the persona of Tommy Morrison, and Benny O'Connor channels the energy of Conor McGregor. Additionally, Ä°van Senchenko mirrors the style of Vasily Lomachenko, creating a roster of characters that pay homage to the giants of the boxing world."
