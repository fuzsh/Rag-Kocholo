        "text": "Fighter Classic Mode title Description Inspiration Mario Let's-a Go!\n\n(世界をまたにかけて, Traveling Around the World) In a similar fashion to the Classic Modes of past games, Mario's opponents are groups of fighters from various universes fought on a home stage from that universe. The penultimate battle is against Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings. The boss of this route is Bowser, who transforms into Giga Bowser upon defeat. The English title is Mario's famous catchphrase. The Japanese title and overall concept may be a reference to Super Mario Odyssey, where Mario goes around the world and visits different kingdoms. The penultimate and final battles being against the Koopalings and then Bowser alludes to the Koopalings' appearances as world bosses before the final boss fight with his arch-enemy Bowser in various Super Mario titles (similar to the end of Melee's Adventure), which pays homage to his status as Mario's greatest enemy and final challenge to defeat. Donkey Kong Journey to New Donk City\n\n(ドンキーコング ニュードンクへ行く, Donkey Kong Goes to New Donk) Donkey Kong's route depicts a journey by plane from the jungle to more urban locations, including the Onett and Moray Towers stages. From Round 2 onward, the player is teamed up with Diddy Kong. The penultimate battle is against Mario and Luigi. The boss of this route is Master Hand, set on Ω form New Donk City Hall. The route is named after its final stage, New Donk City Hall. The penultimate battle alludes to Donkey Kong's rivalry with Mario throughout the Donkey Kong series. Link A Quest to Seal the Darkness\n\n(闇を切り裂く対魔剣, The Blade of Evil's Bane that Cuts the Darkness) Link's opponents on this route are all affiliated with darkness, including Ganondorf, with the penultimate battle being against Dark Link. The boss of this route is Ganon. The title references the main plot of most games in the Legend of Zelda series, where Link must defeat dark entities like Ganon. If the player selects the Dark Link costume, default Link appears as the penultimate enemy instead. Samus Another Planet, Another Bounty\n\n(異星の深淵, The Abyss of Another Planet) Each battle is set on a Metroid series stage and involves fighting characters that shares similarities with bosses from the series. The boss of this route is Master Hand. -- Dark Samus The Great Poison Given Form\n\n(仲間に牙剥く精神汚染, The Mental Pollution that Bares Its Teeth at Companions) Dark Samus's opponents are protagonist characters, and she is teamed up with dark/evil/corrupted variants of characters from their series (for example, Dark Samus is teamed up with Ken in his Violent Ken alternate costume, and together they fight Ryu, or she is teamed up with Luigi in his Waluigi alternate costume, and together they fight Mario, Peach and Daisy). The penultimate round is a Free-for-All against Samus and Ridley. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The route is named after Phazon, the essence of Metroid Prime and Dark Samus, which is named \"the Great Poison\" by the Chozo in Metroid Prime. The penultimate round may be a reference to Metroid Prime 3. Yoshi Jurassic Journey\n\n(ジュラシックアイランド, Jurassic Island) Yoshi's opponents all resemble older pop-culture depictions of prehistoric dinosaurs. His penultimate battle is against Giant Bowser. The boss of this route is Rathalos. The fight against Giant Bowser references the final boss fight in the Yoshi's Island sequels, in which Kamek transforms baby Bowser into a giant upon the latter's defeat. As it is a classical draconic wyvern, Rathalos continues the dinosaur theme. Kirby Gourmet Clash\n\n(激突！グルメバトル, Clash! Gourmet Battle) Kirby's opponents are characters who, like Kirby, love to eat things, including their enemies, such as Pac-Man, Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Wario and King K. Rool. For each battle, Kirby and his opponent each spawn with 35% damage and several food items appear on the stage as the match begins. Additionally, other food-based items (such as Banana Peels and Superspicy Curry) appear more often. The opponent is giant in even-numbered rounds, and normal size in odd-numbered rounds. The penultimate battle is against King Dedede on Fountain of Dreams. The boss of the route is Marx. The route both is named after, and contains gameplay elements that resemble, the Gourmet Race mode from Kirby Super Star. Dedede's appearance as the penultimate opponent can be taken as a reference to both the penultimate battle of Kirby's Adventure and to Gourmet Race. The final battle against Marx alludes to his status as the final boss in Kirby Super Star. Fox Spaceborne Smash\n\n(無限の宇宙, The Infinite Universe) Fox's opponents in this route are characters associated with space or other planets. The boss of this route is Master Hand. His penultimate battle with Wolf on Venom can be read as reference to either their battle in Star Fox 64, or to the \"No items, Fox only, Final Destination\" meme since the battle is fought on an Ω stage against a pseudo clone of Fox without items appearing; Venom is also Team Star Fox's frequent final destination. Master Hand's appearance may be a reference to the battle against Andross in Star Fox 64, in which his disembodied hands guard his face from attack. Pikachu I Choose You!\n\n(大乱闘ポケットモンスターズ, Great Fray Pocket Monsters) The opponents are Pokémon characters from all across the Super Smash Bros. series. All rounds take place on Pokémon stages. The final battle is against Mewtwo, immediately followed by Master Hand. Poké Balls are the only items that appear throughout this route. In English, the route is named after Ash Ketchum's signature catchphrase in the Pokémon anime, which doubles as the title of the first episode and the 20th movie. The Japanese title is a play on Japanese name of the Super Smash Bros. series: 大乱闘スマッシュブラザーズ, Great Fray Smash Brothers. Luigi Luigi's Nightmares\n\n(こっちに来ないで、コワい人！, Stay Away, Scary People!) All of Luigi's opponents are scary characters (such as Ridley), or characters using a scary alternate costume (such as Dark Link). The penultimate battle is against Little Mac in his wireframe costume, followed by a giant Mr. Game and Watch upon defeat. The boss of this route is Dracula. The route's theme is a reference to the Luigi's Mansion games and Luigi's tendency to be easily frightened. As a paranormal enemy, Dracula continues the Luigi's Mansion theme. Ness Home to Onett!\n\n(ホームシック！ オネットに帰ろう, Homesick! Let's Go Back to Onett) Ness's route is themed after the events of most of EarthBound played in reverse, from Magicant to Onett, with opponents and stages that represent key enemies and points in the adventure. The boss of this route is Master Hand. In Japanese, the route is named after Ness's Homesick status effect from EarthBound. The concept may also refer to the ending of EarthBound, where the game doesn't end until Ness returns to Onett after saving the world. Captain Falcon Up Close and Personal\n\n(戦いの基本は接近戦, Close Combat is the Basis of Battle) Captain Falcon fights opponents who specialize in close-range combat, such as Ganondorf and Roy. The boss of this route is Bowser, who transforms into Giga Bowser upon defeat. Giga Bowser may have been chosen as the boss because he has the fewest projectiles of all the bosses (one). Jigglypuff All Original, All 64\n\n(64オールスターズ, 64 All-Stars) Jigglypuff's route is themed after Super Smash Bros. 64, pitting it against all twelve characters who debuted in that game (including itself), on stages that debuted in that game. The final battle is against Giant Donkey Kong. Elements of the route resemble the original 1P Game mode: namely, Link as the round 1 opponent, Pikachu as the round 5 opponent, and the presence of Giant Donkey Kong. The penultimate battle is against the original four unlockable characters, (itself, Luigi, Ness, and Captain Falcon). Peach No Damsel in Distress\n\n(さらわれ姫から卒業！, Graduating from a Kidnapped Princess!) Peach fights against would-be kidnappers such as Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings, Donkey Kong (in his \"classic\" costume), Ganondorf and King K. Rool, with the penultimate battle against her own captor Bowser. The boss of this route is Master Hand. If this route is played with two players, Bowser appears with a copy in his eighth costume, referencing Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels. Daisy Sarasaland Represent!\n\n(戦場のプリンセス, Princess of the Battlefield) Daisy's opponents are all princesses in their respective franchises, such as Zelda and female Corrin. The penultimate battle is against Peach. The boss of this route is Master Hand. In English, the route is named after Sarasaland, Daisy's kingdom. Bowser The Red One. Every Red One!\n\n(因縁の赤いヤツ, The Red Guys of Destiny) Bowser’s opponents in this route are all affiliated with the color red such as Ken, Samus and Diddy Kong, with the penultimate boss battle being against Rathalos. The final battle is against Mario, with Metal Mario being summoned upon Mario's defeat. The route is named and themed after Bowser's long-standing rivalry with Mario. Ice Climbers Duos for Days\n\n(ベストパートナー, Best Partners) The Ice Climbers fight two opponents per stage, all of which are certain iconic duos in their games. The duos they fight are in this order: Link and Zelda, Ryu and Ken, Villager and Isabelle, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Palutena and Pit and Mario and Peach. The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, continuing the duo theme. Much like Ice Climbers, Master Hand and Crazy Hand work together as a duo. Sheik Masquerade\n\n(仮面舞踏会, Masquerade) Sheik's opponents are characters who wear masks or other forms of headwear to conceal their identity, such as Meta Knight, Roy Koopa and Captain Falcon. The boss of this route is Master Hand. -- Zelda Wisdom Prevails\n\n(狙われたトライフォース, The Targeted Triforce) Zelda's opponents are all antagonists on stages from The Legend of Zelda universe culminating in a penultimate battle with four Dark Links. The final battle is against Ganondorf, who transforms into Ganon upon defeat. -- Dr. Mario Colorful Treatment Plan\n\n(いろいろ三色大作戦, Tactics of Three Different Colors) Dr. Mario's opponents are all trios of the same character in red, blue, and yellow costumes. The penultimate battle is against three Warios. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The concept of the route references the three colored viruses in the Dr. Mario games: Fever, Chill, and Weird. The three-Wario fight could reference either Wario's role as a secondary villain in Dr. Mario 64's story, or his poor diet and hygiene in the WarioWare series. Pichu Lightweight Fracas\n\n(ふわっとバトル, Floaty Battle) Pichu's opponents are lightweight characters fought on stages set in the sky, such as Peach's Castle and Skyloft. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The route is both themed and named after Pichu's status as the lightest character in the game. Falco Soar above the Darkness\n\n(光あるところに, Where There is Light) Falco's opponents are \"dark\" characters, such as Dark Samus and Captain Falcon in his Blood Falcon alternate costume. The penultimate battle is against a giant Mr. Game & Watch. The boss of this route is Crazy Hand. The Giant Mr. Game & Watch fight references his role as a corrupted character in The Subspace Emissary. Likewise, Crazy Hand's appearance references his status as Master Hand’s chaotic and destructive counterpart. Marth A Kingdom of Dragons\n\n(竜の王国, A Kingdom of Dragons) Marth fights draconic characters on fantasy stages hailing from Fire Emblem or The Legend of Zelda. The boss of this route is Rathalos. The route is themed after the major role that the many antagonistic dragons play in Marth's Fire Emblem games, in which Marth plays the role of a dragon-slayer using Falchion battling the dragon kingdom of Dolhr. Rathalos can be seen as an analog to Medeus, a primary antagonist, head of the aforementioned Dolhr and the final boss of all of Marth's games. Rathalos may also be a reference to Wyverns, enemy dragons in Marth's games. Lucina A Path of Heroes\n\n(歴代の英雄, Heroes of Many Generations) All of Lucina's opponents are Fire Emblem characters, fought in reverse chronological order of the release of their games. The penultimate battle is against Marth. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The reverse chronological order of the fights likely references her traveling to the past in Awakening. A similar concept of fighting characters in reverse of their debuts appears as All-Star Mode in the Wii U version of Super Smash Bros. 4. Young Link Hyrule Smash!\n\n(ハイラル乱闘！, Hyrule Fray!) Young Link's opponents are characters from The Legend of Zelda universe. All stages, items and assist trophies are from The Legend of Zelda. The boss of this route is Ganon. The fight against the quartet of multicolored Toon Links is a reference to The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords. It may also allude to the GBA release of The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, which came with the original release of Four Swords, in which an optional dungeon, \"The Palace of the Four Sword\", features four Dark Links as the last boss. Ganondorf Encroaching Darkness\n\n(終わりの始まり, The Beginning of the End) Ganondorf's opponents are all heroes and protagonists, culminating in a penultimate battle with Link and Zelda. The boss of this route is Master Hand. Master Hand's boss appearance may reference Ganondorf's intended coup d'état against him in The Subspace Emissary from Brawl. Mewtwo Psychic Control\n\n(洗脳による支配, Domination Through Brainwashing) The battles are a series of Team Battles where one of the opponents will join the player in the following battle. The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, with Pikachu as the player's partner. The route's concept is derived from Pokemon: The First Movie, in which Mewtwo uses its powerful psychic abilities to mind-control others into doing its bidding, such as Nurse Joy. Some opponents are characters who have been mind-controlled in their own games, such as Richter. Additionally, Master Hand and Crazy Hand being the boss of this route could reference World of Light, where Master Hand and Crazy Hand were mind controlled and cloned themselves by Galeem and Dharkon, respectively. Roy A Journey of Swords\n\n(異界の剣士, Otherworldly Swordfighters) Roy's opponents are all sword-wielding fighters, such as Meta Knight, Link, Shulk and Cloud. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The Japanese title mentions the concept of Outrealms from more recent Fire Emblem games. Chrom Fight as One\n\n(運命か、絆か, Destiny or Bonds?) Round 1 is a one-on-one match against Lucina on Arena Ferox. From Round 2 onwards, the battles in this route are Team Battles where Chrom's teammate alternates between Lucina in even-numbered rounds and either male or female Robin in odd-numbered rounds. The opponents are, in order, Fox and Falco, Ness and Lucas, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong, Peach and Daisy, Simon and Richter. The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, with female Robin as the player's partner. The route is themed after the Pair Up mechanic introduced in Fire Emblem Awakening, which Chrom describes as \"fighting as one\". Round 1 is a recreation of Chapter 4 of that game. Peach and Daisy’s appearances in Round 5 could reference Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, where they were partners. In Japanese, the route is named after Chapter 23 of Awakening (known as \"Invisible Ties\" in the English localization). Mr. Game & Watch A Long Legacy\n\n(母川回帰, Return to the Origin) Mr. Game & Watch fights classic characters on retro stages in reverse chronological order, starting with Kirby on the Dream Land GB stage. The penultimate battle is a multi-man of Mr. Game & Watches on the Flat Zone X stage. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The penultimate fight is similar to the finale of All-Star Mode in Melee. Meta Knight Two Sides of the Same Coin\n\n(表裏一体, Two Sides of the Same Coin) Meta Knight's fights are free-for-alls against fighters and their dark counterparts (such as Link and Dark Link, Pit and Dark Pit, Captain Falcon and Blood Falcon, Lucas and Claus, Samus and Dark Samus). His penultimate battle is with another pair of Meta Knights. The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, likewise two sides of the same coin. References Meta Knight's tendency to act as both ally and adversary in the Kirby games. The Meta Knights in the penultimate fight use alternate costumes that represent Galacta Knight, his ultimate opponent in Meta Knightmare Ultra, and Dark Meta Knight, his evil doppelganger in Kirby and the Amazing Mirror; if playing as one of these alternate costumes, the second opponent will become Meta Knight in his original costume instead. Pit Fighting for the Goddess!\n\n(群がる悪を浄化する‼, Purify the Swarming Evil!!) All battles are analogous to fights in Kid Icarus: Uprising (i.e. Ganondorf as Magnus, Bayonetta as Medusa, etc.). The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, with Dark Pit as the player's partner. The Master Hand and Crazy Hand battle is likely a reference to the fight with giant form of Hades in the final battle of Uprising, in which Dark Pit assisted Pit. Dark Pit Created Warriors\n\n(つくられた戦士, Created Warriors) Dark Pit's opponents are man-made clones or genetically enhanced fighters: Mewtwo, Dark Samus, Dark Link, Cloud, and Blood Falcon. His penultimate battle is against Pit. The boss of this route is Galleom, who as a mechanical foe continues the artificial theme, with Pit as the player's teammate. The route is both named and themed after Dark Pit's origins as a copy of Pit in Kid Icarus: Uprising. Pit's appearance as both the penultimate opponent and an ally in the final fight references their developing relationship in Uprising. Zero Suit Samus Grapplers! Whips! Claws!\n\n(ワイヤーを使いこなせ, Master the Wire) Zero Suit Samus's opponents are largely characters who use tether recoveries (the exception is Little Mac, who represents the titular theme of \"wires\" by using his wireframe outfit). The boss of this route is Master Hand. The English version names this route after the three styles of tether used by the opponents in this route: \"grapplers\" refers to the Grapple Beam used by Samus and Dark Samus, \"Whips\" refers to Simon and Richter's Vampire Killer and arguably Ivysaur's vines, and \"Claws\" refer to Young Link and Toon Link's Hookshot. Wario I'm-a Gonna Win!\n\n(オレ様怪力ナンバーワン！, My Super Strength is Number One!) Wario's opponents are those with brute strength, such as King K. Rool and Incineroar. The only two characters missing are Donkey Kong and Bowser. The boss of this route is Master Hand.

Snake Weapons and Equipment OSP\n\n(装備あれば憂いなし, If You're Equipped, There's No Worries) Snake's opponents are all characters who all prominently use projectiles and explosives in their attacks, such as the Inklings and Link. Projectile weapons and explosive items make up most of the item spawns on this route. The penultimate battle is a mirror match against another Snake. The boss of this route is Galleom. The English version names the route after a line in the opening of Metal Gear Solid (\"OSP\" stands for \"On Site Procurement\") which establishes that Snake must obtain weapons and gear within the mission area, as is the norm in almost all Metal Gear games. The Snake mirror match is a reference to Liquid Snake, his cloned twin from Metal Gear Solid, while the Galleom fight can be taken as both a reference to the Metal Gear machines themselves and, as Galleom uses explosive projectiles, a continuation of the theme. Ike The Black-Clad Warriors\n\n(漆黒の武者たち, The Jet-Black Warriors) All of Ike's opponents are in their black alternate costumes. The boss of this route is Master Hand. The route is both themed and named after Ike's rival, the Black Knight.

The penultimate battle is against the opposite-gendered Pokémon Trainer, and the final battle is against Mewtwo, immediately followed by Master Hand. All items are disabled throughout this route. In both languages, the route is named after the catchphrase みらいのチャンピオン (usually translated as \"champ in the making\") that is frequently used by gym guides in the Pokémon series. They use the phrase to describe the player and their goal of becoming the Pokémon Champion. Items being disabled references how they are also disabled in regular Pokémon multiplayer modes, although they never are disabled in Gym/Elite Four battles. Diddy Kong Hey, Little Buddy!\n\n(バディーコング, Buddy Kongs) In each fight, Diddy is accompanied by a protagonist CPU ally whom he assists against corresponding series antagonists or final bosses (for example, Diddy is teamed up with Mario, and together they fight Bowser and Bowser Jr.). His penultimate battle pairs him with Donkey Kong against King K. Rool on Jungle Japes. The bosses of this route are Master Hand and Crazy Hand, with Donkey Kong as his partner again. The English title is a phrase which originated from the manual of Donkey Kong Country and was popularized by the Donkey Kong Country television series; Diddy Kong is also referred to as Donkey Kong's \"little buddy\" in games such as Brawl and Donkey Kong Country Returns. Lucas Magic, Sacred Powers, and PSI!\n\n(魔力、神力、超能力, Magic Powers, Sacred Powers, Psychic Powers) Lucas fights characters with potent psychic or magical powers. The boss of this route is Master Hand. Mewtwo's status as the penultimate opponent is possibly a reference to Giygas's original form from EarthBound Beginnings (referred to as \"Giegue\" in the English version of that game), whom Mewtwo strongly resembles. Sonic At the Speed of Sound\n\n(疾きこと風の如く, As Fast as the Wind) Sonic's opponents are either references to characters in his series (for example, Fox resembles Miles \"Tails\" Prower) or to Sonic games in general, such as Sonic Heroes. Half of Sonic's opponents are also some of the fastest characters in the game, such as Captain Falcon. The penultimate battle is against a giant Incineroar, resembling Zavok, leader of the Deadly Six, who debuted in Sonic Lost World. The boss of this route is Master Hand. References how fast Sonic is.

The penultimate battle of this route is a Multi-Man Battle of R.O.B.s. The boss of this route is Galleom, who continues the expressionless theme. The last two battles reference elements of The Subspace Emissary in Brawl: the R.O.B Multi-Man Battle references the R.O.B. Squad, and Galleom references his recurring boss appearances. Toon Link The Teamwork of Courage\n\n(勇気のチームワーク, The Teamwork of Courage) All battles involve Toon Link teaming up with two other Toon Links. All opponents are groups of fighters from various universes. The penultimate battle of this route is Giant Ganondorf. The boss of this route is Ganon.

Villager Mistake to Underestimate\n\n(普通のひとは強かった, Ordinary People were Strong) Villager fights against characters who appear unsuited for battle but are very strong, such as Isabelle, Dr. Mario and Wii Fit Trainer.

The final battle is against Dr. Mario, with Mewtwo appearing after Dr. Mario is defeated. In English, the route is named after Mega Man X's Variable Weapon System, which allows him to duplicate the abilities of his foes. Mega Man has a similar system, though it was never named as such. In Japanese, it is named after the Japanese subtitle of Mega Man 2: Dr.ワイリーの謎, The Mystery of Dr. Wily. The final battle is a reference to the final battle in Mega Man 2, with Dr. Mario representing Dr. Wily, and Mewtwo representing Wily's Alien hologram.

The boss of this route is Dracula. The route concept is similar to All-Star Mode in the 3DS version of Super Smash Bros. 4. The use of Dracula continues the theme of third-generation game characters (having debuted in 1986, he is the oldest boss in the game), and ties into Pac-Man as a supernatural being similar to the Ghosts that Pac-Man is known to fight. Robin Thunder and Flames\n\n(雷炎闘技, Thunder and Flame Competition) Robin's opponents are all pairs of fighters who use fire and electric attacks (for example, R.O.B. and Ken).

The boss of this route is Crazy Hand. The theme refers to to Ken's status as Ryu's rival. The Ryu fight is set on the Ω form Suzaku Castle stage, mirroring the start of Ryu's Classic Mode.

The boss of this route is Master Hand. The English name refers to conformation shows.

Piranha Plant New Bloom\n\n(花の新人王, Floral Rookie of the Year) All of the opponents are the newcomers for the base game. The boss of this route is Rathalos.

The title refers to a recurring element in the Persona series, Shadows. The battle with Master Hand references the god Yaldabaoth.

The bosses are, in order, Rathalos, Galleom, Marx, Dracula, Ganon, Giga Bowser. The final boss is against Master Hand and Crazy Hand on Northern Cave Ω. According to Masahiro Sakurai, the \"boss rush\" nature of Sephiroth's Classic Mode was inspired by his status as the final boss of Final Fantasy VII. The final battle with Master Hand and Crazy Hand refers to the final battle of Final Fantasy VII, where multiple characters team up to defeat Sephiroth. The title of his route references his leitmotif from the original game, \"Those Chosen by the Planet\". Pyra/ Mythra Shared Destinies\n\n(コインの裏表, Both Sides of the Coin) Pyra and Mythra fight characters who comprise pairs, either due to being similar (such as Ryu and Ken) or parts of the same being (such as Sheik and Zelda, or Pit and Dark Pit). Items are limited to the home universe of each round. The final boss is against Master Hand and Crazy Hand, fitting the duo theme. Many of the characters featured are clones, either in the Smash Bros. sense or the literal sense, referencing how Pyra and Mythra are the same entity, colloquially known as the Aegis. Sheik and Zelda's presence in the route may reference how they were the first transformation characters in the Smash Bros. series. The concept and Japanese name of the route are somewhat similar to Meta Knight's, even including some of the same pairs. Kazuya Fighting Fists with Fists\n\n(拳をもって拳を制す, Fighting Fists with Fists) Kazuya's battles are mostly one-on-one Stamina battles against characters who specialise in martial arts or punching attacks. Several of the opponents represent Tekken characters who are not represented as spirits (Captain Falcon references Hwoarang, Little Mac references Steve Fox, and the fight with Donkey Kong and King K. Rool represents Roger and Alex). The final battle is against Kazuya, with Metal Kazuya being summoned upon Kazuya's defeat. The first match against Ryu references the numerous interactions the Street Fighter and Tekken franchises have had, including the crossover game Street Fighter X Tekken where Ryu is Kazuya’s rival, and Street Fighter villain Akuma's guest appearance in Tekken 7. The penultimate match is a regular battle against several Mii Fighters with armoured suits, referencing Heihachi's Tekken Force soldiers. The boss of this route is another Kazuya followed by a Metal Kazuya, likely referencing Jin Kazama and Heihachi Mishima. The final battle also takes place in the underground section of the Castle Siege stage, referencing the volcano that Heihachi threw Kazuya in at the end of Tekken 2, which Kazuya later threw him into at the end of Tekken 7."
