        "text": "Whether you’re new to gaming or you’re returning to it after a short time away, you might find yourself a bit bamboozled by popular gaming terms.\n\nIf you’re ever found yourself googling things like “what is ip in gaming terms” or “what makes a weapon a crutch”, then you’ll find the answers below in our comprehensive guide to all things gaming related.\n\nFrom AI to Zerging, just scroll down to find the gaming terms you need to know about. You can also visit our gaming section for the latest gaming news.\n\nA – B – C – D – E – F – G – H – I – J – K – L – M – N – O – P – Q – R – S – T – U – V – W – X – Y – Z\n\nA\n\nARPG (Action Role-Playing Games): A genre of role-playing video games where battle actions are performed in real-time instead of via a turn-based mechanic.\n\nAdds: A term used commonly in role-playing video games, MMORPGs, and beat-’em-ups, referring to the “additional enemies” called in by bosses during encounters.\n\nAFK: An abbreviation meaning “away from keyboard”\n\nAggro: A gaming term, abbreviation of ‘aggravation’ or ‘aggression’.\n\nAI (Artificial Intelligence): Algorithms used to generate responsive, adaptive, or intelligent game behaviour, primarily in non-player characters. Distinct from the computing science concept of ‘artificial intelligence’.\n\nAimbot: Used as an FPS cheat that lets players shoot other player-characters without aiming. In most cases, the aiming reticle locks onto a target within the player’s line of sight, and the player only has to pull the trigger.\n\nAnimation Cancel: Animation Cancel is a term mostly used in strategy games like “Warcraft” or “Dota”. The term is also widely used in fighting games, however, with the famous Z-cancel and L-cancel from the Smash Bros. franchise. In both cases, it is a way to cancel the action of a character’s attack/heal/magic, allowing it to perform the next one without any delay.\n\nArena Mode: A side game mode, mostly found in some action-adventure games (e.g. Far Cry 4), in which a player-controlled character is placed in a closed area and challenged to defeat enemies using combat abilities.\n\nAssault Mode: A game mode in which one team tries to attack (or capture) specific areas and the other team tries to defend those points.\n\nAssist(s): Assist is a term used in multiplayer games, mostly first person shooters. You start to kill or shoot someone, and then someone else finishes them off. However, the game credits you with an assist.\n\nAvatar: The player’s representation in the game world.\n\nB\n\nBan: A ban is when the game or server admin decides to ban you from playing for a set amount of time ranging from one minute to permanently. Bans are usually handed out for unruly behaviour such as harassment, exploiting, cheating, or quitting in the middle of games.\n\nBattle Pass: A type of in-game monetisation that provides additional content for a game through a tiered system, rewarding the player with in-game items by playing the game and completing specific challenges.\n\nBeta: Part of the software development life cycle, following alpha. The software in this stage is quite buggy and prone to crashing, resulting in the loss of data. When developers release the beta version of the software, it is called a beta release.\n\nBig Boss: A big boss is a computer-controlled enemy that players have to defeat.\n\nBM: A gaming term meaning ‘Bad Manners’; conduct that is not considered ‘cheating’ but may be seen as unsportsmanlike or disrespectful. Some games may punish badly-behaved players by assessing game penalties, temporarily blocking them from re-entering play, or banishing them to a playing environment populated solely by other badly-behaved players. What constitutes bad manners is largely subjective.\n\nBuff: An effect placed on a video game character that beneficially increases one or more of their statistics or characteristics for a temporary period. This change is intended to strengthen a particular item, tactic, ability, or character, ostensibly for balancing purposes.\n\nC\n\nCamping: A controversial strategy in which a player stays in one place – typically a fortified high-traffic location – for an extended period of time and waits to ambush other players. It is most common in first-person shooter games but is also frequent in fighting games with projectile-heavy characters.\n\nCampaign Mode: A series of game levels intended to tell a linear story; some campaigns feature multiple ‘paths’, with the player’s actions deciding which path the story will follow and affecting which choices are available to the player at a later point.\n\nCarry: In team-based video-games, carrying is a term often applied to a player who disproportionately contributes to the advancement or progress of their team. It’s usually used disparagingly to put down the rest of the team, e.g. “they’re being carried by (player name).”\n\nChallenge Mode: A game mode offered beyond the game’s normal play mode that tasks the player(s) to replay parts of the game or special levels under specific conditions that are not normally present or required in the main game, such as finishing a level within a specific time, or using only one type of weapon.\n\nCheats / Cheating: To play the game unfairly; giving an unfair advantage via illegitimate means. Cheats are used as exploits within the game to either cause a certain effect that wouldn’t normally be possible and/or give the player an unfair advantage. Cheat mode can also be used to remove all the usual rules from a game, meaning it can be played in a fun, over-the-top way.\n\nCheckpoint: Checkpoints can be very different in each and every game but essentially operate as automatic save points that are triggered once a player reaches a certain milestone or location. They’re places that a player will be returned to if they lose a life (unless they are on their last one).\n\nCombo: A series of attacks strung together in quick succession, typically while an opponent is still in their “getting hit” animation from the previous attack and is therefore helpless to defend themselves.\n\nConsole: A video game hardware unit that typically connects to a video screen and controllers, along with other hardware.

Popular in games like Call of Duty.\n\nCoD: Abbreviation of popular FPS game Call of Duty.\n\nCritical Hit: A type of strike that does more damage than usual. Normally a rare occurrence, this may indicate a special attack or a lucky hit on the target’s weak point.\n\nCrutch: A term used to describe a weapon that’s fun to use, overpowered and effective, but doesn’t help you improve skills within the game.\n\nCTF (Capture the Flag): A common game mode in multiplayer video games, where the goal is to capture and retrieve a or other item from the opposing side’s territory while defending the flag in one’s own territory.\n\nCutscene / Cinematic: A game segment that exists solely to provide detail and exposition to the story.

Cut-scenes are more likely to be generated by the in-game engine while cinematics are pre-recorded.\n\nD\n\nDeathmatch: A deathmatch is is a term for an all-out fight in games, most popular in the FPS genre.

It also can be used in order to remove a previously conferred positive status on a character.\n\nDemo: A demo is a free playable demonstration of a game that is intended to hook the player, encouraging them to purchase the full version.\n\nDifficulty: Difficulty can be adjusted in many games, and is mostly used in campaign or co-op modes. It alters how easy it is for the character to die, the difficulty of reaching various objectives, and the help one gets from the game itself.\n\nDLC (Downloadable Content): Additional content for a video game that is acquired through a digital delivery system.\n\nD-Pad: Short for the directional pad, it is a control button with four directions. Found on all consoles.\n\nE\n\nEaster Egg: An Easter Egg is a secret, fun feature in a video game, left there for players to find. The game Grand Theft Auto 5 is crammed with them, including strange symbols, mysteries to solve, aliens, ghosts, monsters and the appearance of characters from previous games in the franchise.\n\nEnd game: The gameplay available in a massively multiplayer online game for characters that have completed all of the currently-available content. More generally, and historically, refers to the gameplay that arises at the end of a game’s story or campaign.\n\nEndless mode: A game mode in which players are challenged to last as long as possible against a continuing threat with limited resources or player-character lives, with their performance ranked on how long they survive before succumbing to the threat (such as the death of the player-character) or on the score. This mode is typically offered in games that otherwise have normal endings that can be reached, providing an additional challenge to the players once the main game is completed.\n\nesports: A form of video game tournament, competition or series of organised competitions around competitive video games, often played for prize money and recognition.\n\nExpansion Pack: An addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game, video game or collectible card game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters, or an extended storyline to an already-released game.\n\nF\n\nFangame: A video game made by fans, based on one or more established video games. Retrogamers may clone early video games to take advantage of more advanced hardware and game engines.\n\nFast Travel: Common in role-playing games, a means by which to have the player-character(s) teleport between already-discovered portions of the game’s world without having to actually interactively move that distance\n\nFatality: Fatalities are extravagant finishing moves in the Mortal Kombat series.

Also known as the failure screen shown after a game loss.\n\nGameplay: A player’s interaction with a video game, defined through game rules, player-game interface, challenges, plot, and the player’s connection with the game.\n\nGG / GGez: Abbreviation meaning “good game”.

Many people regard cheating hackers as annoying because they have an unfair advantage against normal players people, who in turn have very few options to stop them. The people that run a game must keep a lookout for any hackers.\n\nHeadshot: An attack that strikes the head of its target, causing extra (often fatal) damage. See also: critical hit.\n\nHitbox: Especially in fighting games, the area or areas that can inflict damage or other effects to a character (usually not the one which created the hitbox).\n\nHP (Hit Points): This is the amount of health that a character may have and is usually shown on the health bar.\n\nHorde Mode: A type of game mode in co-operative multiplayer games.
