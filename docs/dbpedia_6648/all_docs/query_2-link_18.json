        "text": "This page is currently incomplete and/or in need of extra content or media. You can help out by providing said media or content to make the page better.\n\nThis page is incomplete because it has yet to be fully built, and the information is subject to inconsistencies due to the oddities of the files read to get it.\n\nYou can find other pages that need editing here.\n\nThe Boxing Club is an area in the Living Room, that allows you to test your skills against reinforced enemies and increase your collection of statues for Display Room.\n\nUnlocking and Fight Conditions[]\n\nTo obtain that feature you need to unlcok Bestiary at first and then kill more than 1500 enemies in total, and only after that you can purchase it at the Cat Secretary at the cost of 100 Soul Stones. After purchasing, Boxing Club is accessible by entering the Bestiary then going to a gold-framed enemy card with a boxing glove icon on them. Entering the menu where their name and description is shown will also show a red button with a boxing glove. Tapping it teleports your character to the Boxing Club. It is a room identical to the Training Room, but you cannot use skills that have not been unlocked, and leaving it brings you back to the spot your character was standing in, as opposed to that character's menu screen. Note that Naga heroes from the Ophiculum cannot access the Boxing Club at all. It is impossible to access the Boxing Club unless you are in the central area of the Living Room (as opposed to the Mirage, the Trophy Hall or Multiplayer room), and are alive. Once inside this room, tapping the chain in the center of the boxing ring will spawn the selected enemy. It is possible to access the Bestiary again in this area to change the enemy you're challenging. Once the enemy has appeared to face you, the doors out of the ring will lock, and the fight will begin. Hillding will lose any Wrath he had when entering. The Inventory will also be inaccessible like in a regular fight.\n\nMost enemies found in this place will have both the attack speed and speed elite buffs (unless specified), and will generally appear in group or alone. Enemies in the ring are also equipped with specific items, which change depending on your character pick. If several enemies spawn instead of one, all of them have the same items equipped. Dying in a fight will cause the enemy to disappear, progress in the fight will be lost, and you will be revived after a short delay to try again. Akaisha's Leprechaun skill has twice the cooldown here. Power of Asura and Power of Six Realms will also be disabled, and the game's difficulty in the fight is locked to Real Mirage.\n\nEnemy Statues[]\n\nAfter defeating an enemy in the Boxing Club, a dramatic KO appears on-screen and the battle ends. The defeated enemy is marked by golden bust at the top right of its card. This unlocks a statue that can be used in the Trophy Hall, accessible from a special menu of its own. These statues can be configured to a specific animation by tapping the orange button depicting people that appears when editing them in the Trophy Hall: idle animations are unlocked by default, and attack animations, stun animations and death animations (Slash death animations aren't available) can be unlocked later at the cost of Soul Stones, which change for each enemy. From each of these groups it is possible to choose a sprite for the enemy to show on the statue's pedestal. Currently you need to spend 189,750 Soul Stones to unlock every pose (Animation) for all enemy statues. Check each individual boxing club enemy's page to see the poses and price details.\n\nAvailable Fighter List[]\n\nFor the current version of the game, there are 50 enemies available for a Boxing Club fight.\n\nUndead Biome (12,650 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Office Zombie\n\nBoxing Club Bat\n\nBoxing Club Red Bat\n\nBoxing Club Archer Ash\n\nBoxing Club Shikeledon\n\nBoxing Club Slime\n\nSamurai Biome (11,350 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Spearman\n\nBoxing Club Karakasa\n\nBoxing Club Omukade\n\nBoxing Club Yurei\n\nBoxing Club Monk\n\nChina Biome (52,250 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Meng the Bell Toller\n\nBoxing Club Maple Byrd\n\nBoxing Club Sifu\n\nBoxing Club Manticus\n\nBoxing Club Zhao Qiang\n\nBoxing Club Gu Feihuang\n\nBoxing Club Wing Chun Master\n\nBoxing Club Mistral\n\nBoxing Club Pinky Tornado\n\nDesert Biome (30,200 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Frostfire Sahir\n\nBoxing Club Selcis\n\nBoxing Club Vizier\n\nBoxing Club Nagal\n\nBoxing Club Charming Witch\n\nBoxing Club Shadow Warrior\n\nWild West Biome (18,050 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Officer\n\nBoxing Club Silva\n\nBoxing Club Rocky\n\nBoxing Club Emmett the Rustler\n\nBoxing Club Vulture\n\nElfland Biome (20,700 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Fairy Staffmaster\n\nBoxing Club Elf Archer\n\nBoxing Club Rabbit Brawler\n\nBoxing Club Werewolf\n\nBoxing Club Spear Hare\n\nBoxing Club Bunny Basher\n\nBoxing Club Gachimuchi\n\nStronghold Biome(17,950 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Heavy Gunman\n\nBoxing Club Volt Switch\n\nBoxing Club Army Prototype\n\nBoxing Club Bladed Enforcer\n\nBoxing Club Pyromaniac\n\nNorse Biome(16,450 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Camp Scout\n\nBoxing Club Viking Captain\n\nBoxing Club Viking Rookie\n\nBoxing Club Valkyrie\n\nImperium Biome(10,150 sg):[]\n\nBoxing Club Fusilier\n\nBoxing Club Bombardier\n\nBoxing Club Cavalry Soldier"
