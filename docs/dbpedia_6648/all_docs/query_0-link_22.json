        "text": "There is something to be said for simplicity in video games. Many are overly complicated, and there is also room for forgiveness for a feature set of a game that isn’t full price. However, a sports game with no online capabilities and a very limited single-player experience is a tough one to enjoy for any length of time. BRBCC is unfortunately more limited than it is simplistic, and that causes a problem with overall enjoyment.\n\nRead full review\n\nBig Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions is a solid take on the Rocky/Creed franchise, celebrating the wide variety of fighters that contributed to the series over the years. The gameplay is rather basic for the most part, with little deviation in style between the characters, but fundamentally the fights all feel fun and it's incredibly satisfying when you land a knockout blow on your opponent. The graphics benefit well from more stylised art design, but limitations with the arena's crowds do stand out. If you're a fan of Rocky, though, then you'll definitely want to step into the ring and try this one out.\n\nRead full review\n\nBig Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions! Is a fun arcade game that’s really easy to play. This probably isn’t the game that die-hard boxing fans have been waiting for but being able to play as characters from across different generations of the franchise has its obvious appeal. Fans of the films will enjoy unlocking all the characters for the chance to play their friends in versus mode during an afternoon session of gaming but without online mode, I don’t see it going beyond that.\n\nRead full review\n\nBetween the comic book character models and various backdrops, there’s an agreeable cartoon aesthetic here that does justice to the license on a meagre budget. Unfortunately, it’s a bit too barebones to fully justify its price point: the inclusion of licensed songs, like Eye of the Tiger, give it some panache – but the story mode is simplistic, with text-based cut-scenes tying events together, and there’s no online option or alternative modes to speak of. Even though what’s here is of a high quality, it feels like it could have done with an additional training montage or two, just to add a little more beef to its bones.\n\nRead full review\n\nBig Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions features all the greats from the franchise. Its large roster and faithful character designs will please fans. Unfortunately, it’s in the ring where the game falls flat. It fails to strike the right balance between arcade action and the sport of boxing. Although some may find the casual nature quite fun, aficionados will have to wait for that knockout game.\n\nRead full review\n\nIf you aren’t a huge fan of the films but can get past the egregious decision to only include a sparse amount of playable modes and endure the grind to unlock the other fighters; then Big Rumble Boxing can be a solid and fun fighting game to play.\n\nRead full review"
