        "meta_description": "When Ubisoft's surprising movie-inspired boxing videogame Rocky first hit consoles in the autumn of 2002, I was surprised at how well it captured the theatrical experience. Though it was no secret around the office that quite a few of us were Rocky fans already, the Rage-developed fighter drew us in with more than just the power of its license -- it also nabbed us with its easy to understand boxing mechanics and satisfying fast-paced gameplay. Not to mention the fact that its two-player head-to-head modes were amazing fun, with only a few technical glitches and AI issues holding it back.",
