        "text": "Legends of Boxing PC is a conversion of the table top simulation of the sport of boxing intended to accurately create or recreate great match-ups and portray the abilities of legendary fighters and their opponents. This game is designed for solitaire play, allowing the player to observe the action in the ring and conduct “What If” bouts with many of the greatest fighters in history. Fighter’s abilities are represented in fifteen categories and the overall style of the fighter is crucial when matching up fighters in the ring. Some also have additional personalised attributes.\n\nThe program allows one-off exhibition fights to be created and replayed. It also provides a sandbox universe mode where you set up a series of fight nights with automatic recording of ranking lists and title holders.\n\nThere is also a career mode where you take a fictional or retrograded real fighter and guide them from the start of their career to hopefully World Title glory. Along the way you build reputation, mould your fighter’s abilities, and navigate the tricky path of opponents and ‘real-life’ issues.\n\nAs your fighter’s career develops so hopefully will his attributes, through training camps, general development, and the outcome of his fights. When he reaches the prime of his career he has to keep looking over his should as the approach of father time is inevitable.\n\nThe demo comes with 16 heavyweights and allows you to fight the first five fights of a single fighter career."
