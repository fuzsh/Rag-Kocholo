        "text": "With the release of a new update yesterday, I felt I’d do my first gaming review, for Yukes and THQ’s latest title, WWE ’12. I thought I’d split the review into different sections, before giving the game an overall score out of 10 at the end.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics have really moved on from this games predecessor, Smackdown vs Raw 2011, which is a brilliant surprise. Year on year the Smackdown vs Raw series’ graphics really haven’t changed, and this is one of the biggest leaps since the games moved onto current generation consoles. As the picture on the right shows, characters are mainly, a lot less fuzzy, the detail that has gone into the characters in this game really shines. However, the textures of certain characters remain completely incorrect, with a lot of them being slightly off colour to how they are in real life, and some faces remain completely lacking in detail, for example Ezekiel Jackson, whos appearance in the game is as bland as his personality in the ring.\n\nIn a side note, as a big fan of CM Punk I’m annoyed that once again, Yukes haven’t got his tattoos correct, is it really that hard to pay the licencing from them?\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay in this game is surprisingly much better than I thought it would be – in single player. Small changes have been made since SVR2011 to improve the experience, including more responsive ring ropes to moves. It’s small things like that which really improve an already successful franchise. Other than the small changes, including the hotly anticipated (yet disappointing) Predator Technology, not much in the game has really changed gameplaywise.\n\nThe combat system is fun as usual, if not slightly tedious at times. Moveset sizes have been decreased since recent years, which can quite often lead to repetition in matches which noone really wants to see. However the games physics system makes the combat system interesting, with players able to throw opponents through tables with any kind of move, and onto any other weapons strewn around the ring.\n\nHowever this gameplay does come with some glaring flaws. Quite often the AI will be bordering on the mental level of a 4 year old, in other words, being extremely unintelligent, at one point I’ve had an opponent just walk into a corner, and keep walking until I hit them. However, as stupid as the AI can be, they can also be quite possibly unbeatable. The legendary difficulty mode, which obviously is intended to be difficult, is almost impossible to overcome due to the AI being able to counter each and every move you throw at it. Also another problem is just glitchy animations, this means players teleporting through opponents halfway through a move, or punching thin air but the move will still effect the opponent. The glitches can be extremely frustrating at times, but when playing online can actually end up being quite humorous.\n\nGame modes:\n\nThere are two main game modes excluding online, being the WWE Universe mode, which allows you to essentially become the owner of the WWE, creating your own match cards and storylines. This allows for a lot of freedom and fun, allowing the player to push their own created wrestler to WWE championship status, or put their least favourite wrestler on a long losing streak. This freedom allows for the WWE universe to be forever changing, with injuries occurring, or interferences and alliances. The other game mode on offer is the Road to Wrestlemania, which is an 18 month long story, with three different controllable characters, the villainous Sheamus, the outsider Triple H, and the heroic Jacob Cass (a created wrestler). The RTWM game mode sounds promising on paper, providing what should be 3 immersive storylines to go along with the fun combat. However, this is not the case. It’s simply an 18 month haul, or in real time a good 12 hour grind through samey backstage brawls. There is absolutely no freedom provided in these stories either, sometimes with the game banning you from even tagging your partner in a tag match for no real reason, which just seems foolish.\n\nCreation:\n\nIn WWE ’12, you want to create it – you probably can. There’s a create-a-superstar mode, along with the ability to create your own stories, arena, finishers, logo, and new to WWE ’12, your own TitanTron for your superstar. With new added features to each of the create-a modes there is plenty of fun to be had simply making your superstar and perfecting him. It can take hours to decide on what colour you want your jacket to be during your entrance, or whether your superstars boxing gloves go with the fluffy lion slippers he wears. The creation in the game is extremely fun, and if your inspiration ever runs dry, you can simply search the community creations for new superstars, where you’re likely to find some hidden gems, such as Scorpion from Mortal Combat, or the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nOnline:\n\nOnline is what lets this game down completely, seriously. In a word, the online is bad. At best. There are so many complaints to be had that I could probably make a separate blog post about it, but in the interests of being concise, I’ll simply list the problems.\n\nThe servers. The servers are difficult to connect to in the first place. This may be because I live in England, or it may simply be because they are awful. From other posts I’ve read, I’ll go with the latter and say that there are real server issues.\n\nLag. Again, you could argue that this is because I live in England, but the game runs on a system of a designated host, and even when other people from England who I live extremely close to are host, the game can be basically unplayable. This is simply awful, especially for a game that relies so heavily on reversals being timed correctly.\n\nThe people who play the game – I know this isn’t really a complaint about the game itself, but there are certain cheap exploits within the game that are a lot more difficult to reverse than others, or in some cases just cannot be reversed. Players online will abuse these for the win, even in a ‘player match’ which has no effect on players ranks or record they’ll still abuse these tactics for the win.\n\nThe WWE franchise used to rely heavily on multiplayer gaming, or at least it did to me anyway. So to say I’m bitterly disappointed by the online mode in this game is an understatement.\n\nEDIT: The update rolled out the same day of this blog seems to have done little to nothing towards fixing the problems me and my friends suffer while playing. Highly disappointing.\n\nDownloadable Content:\n\nWWE ’12 has now had three packs of downloadable content released, most recently the ‘Legends Pack’ with four different characters and a new attire for one character. Each individual character is priced at 80 microsoft points each, (excluding one character who is free) which means that the new characters aren’t expensive to add to your game. Yukes made the good yet simple decision of making each piece of DLC individual which is great, as I only wanted to add certain characters, so I didn’t have to shell out my microsoft points for characters I would never play with. The one gripe I have with the DLC, is that a lot of the characters released were already with the company when production of the game began (for example the Bella twins, who joined the company in 2008) are released as DLC, when they really should have been on the game to begin with. Overall, the downloadable content for the game is good, if not unnecessary at times, but for the small price for each character, it’s worth it to add to your collection.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall, WWE ’12 is a game bursting with potential, however it simply just can’t be the great game it was meant to be. With the online being beyond dire, the game loses at least half of its fun factor, due to the huge dependence on multiplayer gaming. I rode into this game with high hopes, but ended up being bitterly disappointed, when I was left with an overly long and unoriginal story mode, and a broken online mode. With this in mind, I layeth the smackdown on this game, giving it a highly underwhelming 5.5/10."
