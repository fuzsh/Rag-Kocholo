        "text": "What are the new Untitled Boxing Game codes? These freebies will light your fists on fire with tons of extra spins. This relatively secretive Roblox brawler is gearing up for a big release, and its dynamic camera and fancy footwork already have it feeling like a beat-’em-up poised for the big leagues. Climb into the ring and fight fair. Just use a few codes beforehand. Nobody needs to know.\n\nReady your fists and challenge anyone in this Roblox arena to a punching match. Stand your ground, stay on your toes, and keep your head in the game. And if you can’t quite cut it, we have plenty of Shindo Life codes for you to use instead, with Blox Fruits codes and King Legacy codes available if you’re more of a pirate than a ninja.\n\nNew Untitled Boxing Game codes\n\nHere are all the active Untitled Boxing Game codes:\n\nfreeemoteforall – rewards (NEW)\n\nthegames – 10 spins (NEW)\n\n500mil – 8 spins\n\nkocash – 8 spins\n\nmanyfixes – 5 spins\n\noneyear – 11.2k cash\n\nubgforever – 15 spins\n\ndelayapology! – One cash\n\nwatwatwat – 5 spins\n\nExpired codes\n\nbalrog\n\nvegeta\n\nyamcha\n\nipposreturn\n\nfreeemote1\n\nfreeemote2\n\nchronos\n\ncashcashcash\n\nhawkrework\n\nkoanims\n\nfeint\n\nsettings\n\n200mil\n\nfreecrates\n\nfreeunusual\n\nfreeemote\n\nstyletitles\n\nmorecash\n\nrandomcode\n\nvalentines\n\nstyletitles\n\nnice\n\ncharge\n\njolly\n\nfreedom\n\nshotgun\n\n220mil\n\n250k\n\nturtle\n\nironfist\n\nbalance1\n\ntrading\n\nmoretrading\n\ngems\n\nbullet\n\n100mil2\n\n100mil\n\nfreestuff\n\nfps\n\nkimura\n\n170k\n\nghost\n\nbruh\n\n150k\n\n140k\n\n130k\n\n120k\n\nviolence\n\ngetmoremythics\n\nwhitefang\n\n100k\n\nperformancefixes\n\n60k likes\n\nShutdowns\n\n40klikes\n\nnewlegendary\n\n20klikes\n\ndonewithmigration\n\nmigration\n\n5000likes\n\nwhynot\n\ndataissue\n\nearlybird\n\npocketchange\n\n1000likes\n\nWhen using codes in Untitled Boxing Game, be sure to type out the code correctly. The codes above have been tested and verified, and any deviation from how they appear above will result in issues when redeeming them.\n\nIf you’re getting errors when trying to redeem the Untitled Boxing Game codes above, double-check your spelling, letter case, and consider relaunching the experience in case you’re on an old server. To keep things simple, just copy and paste each code individually from the list above. Just make sure no sneaky spaces have wormed their way in before or after the code. It can happen.\n\nHow do I redeem Untitled Boxing Game codes?\n\nYou can redeem codes in Untitled Boxing Game as soon as you start playing. Just launch the experience on your Roblox platform of choice and, instead of looking for the pesky Twitter bird icon, turn your gaze to the easily identifiable Codes button along the left side of the screen.\n\nGive that a tap and you’ll be prompted to enter Untitled Boxing Game codes into the long text box that appears. Type (or paste) them one by one, hitting the green Redeem button with each to claim your goodies and clear the field for your next code. You can use spins on the Fighting Styles menu two buttons above on the left.\n\nHow do I get more Untitled Boxing Game codes?\n\nMore Untitled Boxing Game codes are confirmed to drop when the game hits certain social milestones on the Roblox game, with 5k likes being the goal for the next one. If you’re not up for checking back here for any new codes as they come, you can look for them yourself by scouring the Untitled Boxing Game developer’s Twitter, or by joining the game’s dedicated Discord channel.\n\nBeyond social milestones, new codes could drop for game updates, downtime, errors, and more. Roblox developers rarely settle on any one way to offer game codes. Just don’t be too surprised if they start to become less frequent a little while after launch."
