        "text": "The world of professional wrestling is set to captivate fans once again with the release of WWE 2K24, the latest installment in the popular video game series that started with WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw in 2004. Developed by Visual Concepts and published by 2K, there are several versions: WWE 2K24 Deluxe Edition and WWE 2K24 Forty Years of Wrestlemania, which were introduced on March 5, 2024, and the Standard and Cross-Gen editions, launched on March 8, 2024.\n\nLike its predecessors, WWE 2K24 is a wrestling simulator that aspires to deliver a WWE experience that’s as authentic as it can get, complete with storylines, legendary wrestlers, and the electrifying atmosphere that characterizes the sport.\n\nWWE 2K24 Main Features and Gameplay\n\nMaking a splash in the digital squared circle, WWE 2K24 features superbly animated fights and photo-realistic wrestlers, thanks to a revamped graphics engine. The gameplay mechanics have also been tweaked, resulting in what Gamerant says is the “best in-ring action it has ever been.” The visuals are especially impressive on hardware with powerful graphics cards, such as the Predator Triton 16 gaming notebook or the Predator Orion 7000 desktop computer.\n\nEnhancements to the character creation suite allow players to craft their own unique Superstars with an extensive range of customization options, from their appearance and attire to their moves and entrance themes. Meanwhile, improvements to the dive and ramp cameras help bring about a more immersive experience.\n\nWWE 2K24 debuts new match types, including Gauntlet, where you can face up to 30 Superstars consecutively in one match. In the Special Guest Referee match, players can either officiate or have an AI-controlled referee. The Ambulance match is a no-holds-barred affair where your goal is to trap your opponent in the vehicle by all possible means, including using improvised weapons.\n\nNewcomers and fans of the franchise alike can enjoy the following game modes:\n\n2K Showcase of the Immortals\n\nYou can recreate the most memorable matches in the 40-year history of Wrestlemania, including Hulk Hogan vs. Andre the Giant, Bray Wyatt vs. John Cena, and Bianca Belair vs. Asuka.\n\nMyRise\n\nFeaturing original storylines, this career mode allows you to generate your own male or female wrestler who undergoes various challenges to become a WWE champion.\n\nMyFaction\n\nIn this team-building mode, you will recruit Superstars and Legends to your own WWE faction and compete against other groups in single-player and online multiplayer matches, earning rewards that will level up your squad.\n\nUniverse\n\nYou can exercise complete control over the WWE universe in this mode, which offers double title matches, novel cutscenes, and faction rivalry actions like brawls.\n\nMyGM\n\nActing as a general manager, you’ll be able to produce epic shows starring WWE Superstars that you’ve drafted. You’ll also have the power to offer contracts and trade wrestlers, and to make executive decisions to upstage rival GMs and brands.\n\nWWE 2K24 Roster: A Legendary Lineup\n\nThe who’s who of the wrestling world—past and present—take center stage in the game, from household names like Roman Reigns and Becky Lynch to up-and-coming talents like Cora Jade and Ludwig Kaiser. Fans of wrestling legends will also be delighted to see iconic figures such as The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin making their return to the virtual squared circle.\n\nWhile the huge roster is packed with wrestling luminaries, fans may notice the absence of former WWE champion Brock Lesnar and former wrestler and WWE co-founder Vince McMahon from the list. According to some gaming news reports, McMahon, who has been a playable character since WWE 2K15, is under federal investigation for alleged sexual misconduct, while Lesnar faces complaints in a lawsuit against WWE.\n\nThey might be missing from the main roster, but both still make an appearance in WWE 2K24. McMahon can be seen as a non-player character (NPC) in the 2K Showcase of the Immortals mode. In the same mode, there are some matches where Lesnar appears as a playable character.\n\nConclusion\n\nPraised by critics for its visuals, gameplay mechanics, diverse cast of characters, and sheer entertainment value, WWE 2K24 is an example of why sports video games are so popular. It’s poised to be a must-have for wrestling enthusiasts and gamers alike, offering many hours of entertainment and the chance to step into the shoes of their favorite Legends and Superstars.\n\nWWE 2K24 can be played on PCs via Steam and Xbox Game Pass, as well as on the PS4 and PS5, and the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S.\n\nRecommended Products"
