        "text": "Fight Night Round 3\n\nGet in the Ring mode allows gamers to experience the fight through the eyes of the boxer. This is the closest a gamer will ever come to getting into the ring and trading blows with the greatest boxers of all time like Oscar De La Hoya, Muhammad Ali and many others. For the first time ever, gamers will truly experience the sensation of the sport with visual and audio effects like ear ringing, restricted vision, flashes of bright light, color shifts and blur effects that simulate the sense and feeling of getting punched\n\nImagine trying to recover from Alis lighting fast jabs when you can barely make out his glove through a blinding barrage of flashes and blur. Furthermore, the boxers are more lifelike than ever with everything from the boxers sweat and skin to the appearance of their muscles and veins all adding to the realistic gameplay experience.\n\nTapping into the power of the PLAYTSTATION 3, the EA Canada development team has come up with new ways to make the boxers look more photo realistic than ever before!\n\nGet in the RingRely on your instincts in this PLAYSTATION3-exclusive game mode that allows you to fight through the eyes of your boxer from the moment he enters the ring.\n\nESPN IntegrationESPN raises the bar with this all-new level of integration only available on the PLAYSTATION 3\n\nGet the latest scores and news with ESPN Motions streaming video content, live ticker updates, ESPN Radio and ESPNEWS.\n\nSplit-Screen Multiplayer ActionPunshi your rival and go head to head against your friends in PLAYSTATION3-exclusive split-screen battles.\n\nSuper Punch Clench down on that mouth guard rookie! Players will feel the impact of a devastating punch as the boxers face ripples from a super punch knockout.\n\nOne Punch Can Change A Fight Devastating Impact Punches keep you in the fight\n\nInstantly trigger a Flash KO moment, Stun Punch, or EA SPORTS Haymaker to take control.\n\nBoxings Greatest Rivalries Watch recreations of ESPN Classic footage of bouts or re-create the greatest fights from past and present including Arturo Gatti vs Mickey Ward, Marco Antonio Barrera vs Eric Morales, and Ali vs Frasier.\n\nOnline Gameplay EA SPORTS Fight Night Round 3 features online play with PLAYSTATION 3 online.\n\nThat wonderful boxing game has made it's way onto the PS3 that has a new exclusive for the console which allows for an an all-new first person boxing mode. Boasting graphics that are sure to make you cry, Round 3 pound for pound is gonna rattle your skull, loosen your teeth and generally make you cry as you work your way through the ranks until you become the heavy hitter that your momma always said she thought you were.\n\nEvery thing you can think of has been taken care of in this title, I simply can�t get over how much detail there is in the game. All the name boxers look exactly like their real life counterparts, bodies sweat and bleed, and when you take a ton of hits, the deformity work on the character maps has to be seen to be believed. Tattoos, scars and the general look of the boxers is there for all to see. And for those looking for just that little bit more, this game features some of the best looking ring girls that you are likely to see in some time.\n\nNot only is the boxing realistic, even the gaming environments take you deep into the world of the boxer. Rings, training rooms, lighting, everything comes together perfectly to provide you with a convincing gameworld in which to fight. Add to that the ability to re-enact classic bouts in black and white no less and I think that you are going to consider the purchase of this game one of the best things you did for your PS3 in the short time that you have owned one.\n\nThrowing a lot of punches is a fine strategy and simply flailing about will often win you a match, but occasionally you'll have to defend yourself. You can block and parry punches using the R1 button. You can use the right analog stick to determine which part of your body you want to guard.\n\nGetting into the fighting itself and I don�t think that you have experienced anything as realistic as this unless you were a boxer or street brawler. Round 3 has developed a great system to allow fighters a chance to see how their opponents moves are developing, but only slightly. This is in order to give people time to react and actually defend as opposed to a slugfest where you would just cop the punches and hope that if you hit your buttons fast enough, you could do enough damage to win. Moves like roundhouses are telegraphed out enough that you should have time to react and at least try to block incoming wild swings.\n\nThe minigames consist of the heavy bag, the weights, and the combo dummy from Fight Night Round 2. The minigames are extremely simple timing and pattern-recognition exercises, and you'll never have a problem reaching the required point goal to achieve the maximum benefit from the training.\n\nFight Night Round 3 features career, play now, ESPN Classic mode, online modes, as well as a new first-person Get in the Ring mode. Play now lets you choose your fighter, opponent, and venue for a quick match. In this mode, you can pit any of the boxing legends against another, regardless of weight class. If you want to see Evander Holyfield go up against Manny Pacquaio in front of thousands at Madison Square Garden, you can."
