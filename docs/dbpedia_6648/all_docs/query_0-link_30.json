        "text": "Prepare to exploit your opponent’s weaknesses by using the intuitive Wii controls to duck, dodge, jab and hook your way to victory! For the first time in PUNCH-OUT!! history you can go head-to-head with a friend – or enemy! The multiplayer mode allows two contenders to pit their wits and skills against each other via a split screen. Box intelligently to earn Giga Mac Juice. When you have earned enough, you will turn into Giga Mac and can unleash even more powerful blows on your opponent!\n\nThis is no button-bashing fighting game – you'll need to keep your wits about you and think carefully about your tactics in the ring to succeed. The new game offers bold new 3D graphics and immersive control that utilises the precision of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to mimic the movements of the left and right hands.\n\nIn the exciting single player Career mode, you play as Little Mac, a young boxer determined to become World Champion. You must face thirteen different opponents on your way to the goal, spread across three circuits: Minor, Major and World. These opponents are based on some of the most popular signature characters from previous PUNCH-OUT!! games, including, amongst others, Von Kaiser, King Hippo and Glass Joe."
