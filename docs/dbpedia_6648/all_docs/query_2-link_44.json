        "text": "EA announced today that the highly anticipated Fight Night Round 4 is now available in retail stores worldwide. Recently named the Game Critic Awards \"Best Sports Game of E3 2009\", Fight Night Round 4 is developed by EA Canada under the EA SPORTS brand. Fight Night Round 4 is the latest entry from the critically acclaimed Fight Night franchise, and is the first title ever that will allow players to pit \"Iron\" Mike Tyson against \"The Greatest\" Muhammad Ali.\n\nDesigned with a revolutionary physics-based gameplay engine, Fight Night Round 4 replicates the sweet science to an unprecedented degree of realism. Witness gloves grazing off an opponent as he dodges at the last second, or watch as a vicious uppercut rips through the block of a boxer who turtles for too long. With realistic physics, height and reach become major factors in how each boxer approaches a fight. Shorter fighters, like Tyson, will look to weave inside and deliver punishing hooks to the head and body, while taller fighters, like Ali, will use their reach advantage to pump their jab while staying out of range of their opponent's punches.\n\nAn all new career mode, titled Legacy mode, challenges you to move up the ranks from an upstart amateur to become the greatest of all time. Create a boxer from the incredibly robust create-boxer feature, or import your own face into the game using the Photo Game Face tool and bring your virtual self into the ring. Make rivals, challenge for and defend belts as you journey to cement your name among the greatest names in boxing.\n\nWith 48 boxers, Fight Night Round 4 will feature the largest roster to ever appear in a Fight Night videogame. In addition to Tyson and Ali, the roster will feature legends and current champions, including Lennox Lewis, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Manny Pacquiao, Miguel Cotto and Ricky Hatton. Each boxer's likeness has been meticulously created with an unparalleled level of realism, and their boxing styles re-created to reflect their real-life counterpart's strengths and weaknesses in the ring.\n\nFight Night Round 4 will be available for the PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system and Xbox 360® video game system from Microsoft. This game has been rated T for Teen by the ESRB, and 16+ by PEGI. For more information, log onto the official Fight Night Round 4 game site."
