        "text": "2024 National Health Care Fraud Enforcement Action\n\nSummary of Criminal Charges\n\nCases Filed in Federal Court\n\nSouthern District of Alabama\n\nBrian Cotugno, of Auburn, Georgia, and James Matthew Thorton “Bo” Potter, of Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, were charged by information and indictment, respectively, with purchasing and selling Medicare beneficiary identification numbers (“BINs”) in connection with their role in a nearly $20 million over-the-counter (“OTC”) COVID-19 test fraud scheme. As alleged, Cotugno sold hundreds of thousands of BINs and other personal data to labs around the country, including to two laboratories co-owned by Potter based in Birmingham, Alabama and Spanish Fort, Alabama. The BINs were used to bill Medicare tens of millions of dollars for OTC COVID-19 test kits, many of which had not been requested by the beneficiaries. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Bodnar of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Alabama. Assistant U.S. Attorney Gina Vann is handling asset forfeiture.\n\nDistrict of Arizona\n\nAlexandra Gehrke, 38, and Jeffrey King, 49, of Scottsdale, Arizona, were charged by indictment with various counts of conspiracy, health care fraud, receiving kickbacks, and money laundering in connection with an alleged scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare $900 million for highly expensive amniotic allografts. The defendants targeted elderly Medicare patients, many of whom were terminally ill in hospice care, through their companies—Apex Mobile Medical LLC, Apex Medical LLC, Viking Medical Consultants LLC, and APX Mobile Medical LLC. The defendants caused unnecessary and extremely expensive amniotic grafts to be applied to these vulnerable patients’ wounds indiscriminately, without coordination with the patients’ treating physicians, without proper treatment for infection, to superficial wounds that did not need this treatment, and in sizes excessively larger than the wound. In just sixteen months, Medicare paid the defendants more than $600 million as a result of their fraud scheme, paying on average more than a million dollars per patient for these unnecessary grafts. The defendants received more than $330 million in illegal kickbacks from the graft distributor in exchange for purchasing, ordering, and arranging for the purchasing of the grafts billed to Medicare. Significant assets were seized upon the defendants’ arrests, including luxury vehicles, gold, and bank accounts totaling more than $70 million. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Shane Butland of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Williams of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.\n\nCarlos Ching, 55, of Phoenix, Arizona, is charged by information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud in connection with the APX scheme. As alleged in the information, Ching was paid by APX to apply medically unnecessary allografts to Medicare patients that were procured through kickbacks and bribes. Between June 2023 and January 2024, APX fraudulently billed Medicare over $87 million for allografts applied by Ching. Medicare paid APX over $65 million based on those false and fraudulent claims. And from January 2024 through March 2024, Ching, through his company H3 Medical Clinic LLC, billed Medicare over $5 million for allografts that he procured through kickbacks and bribes and applied to Medicare beneficiaries without medical necessity. Medicare paid over $4 million based on those false and fraudulent claims. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Shane Butland of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Williams of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.\n\nBethany Jameson, 53, of Gilbert, Arizona, is charged by information with conspiracy to commit wire fraud in connection with the APX scheme. As alleged in the information, Jameson was paid by Apex Mobile Medical and APX to apply medically unnecessary allografts to Medicare beneficiaries that were procured through kickbacks and bribes. Between November 2022 and August 2023, Apex Mobile Medical and APX billed Medicare over $71 million for allografts applied by Jameson. Medicare paid over $49 million based on those false and fraudulent claims. The case is being prosecuted by Trial Attorney Shane Butland of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Williams of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.\n\nRita Anagho, 52, of San Tan Valley, Arizona, was charged by indictment with conspiracy to commit health care fraud, health care fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice in connection with an alleged $69 million scheme involving a substance abuse treatment clinic in Arizona. As alleged in the indictment, Anagho owned Tusa Integrated Clinic LLC (“Tusa”), an outpatient treatment center, which was purportedly in the business of providing addiction treatment services for persons suffering from alcohol and drug addiction. Tusa enrolled as a provider with Arizona’s Medicaid agency, Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, and submitted false and fraudulent claims for services that were not provided, were not provided as billed, were so substandard that they failed to serve a treatment purpose, were not used as part of or integrated into any treatment plan, and were medically unnecessary. Anagho also instructed former Tusa employees to create false therapy notes for sessions they did not conduct in 2023 after she was served with a subpoena for Tusa’s records as part of the government’s investigation of this fraud. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief James Hayes and Trial Attorney Sarah Edwards of the National Rapid Response Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Williams of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.\n\nAdam Mutwol, 45, of Tempe, Arizona, and Daud Koleosho, 44, of Gilbert, Arizona, were charged by separate informations with conspiracy to commit health care fraud in connection with an alleged $57 million substance abuse treatment fraud scheme. As alleged in the informations, Mutwol and Koleosho owned Community Hope Wellness Center LLC (“CHWC”), an outpatient treatment center, which was purportedly in the business of providing addiction treatment services for persons suffering from alcohol and drug addiction. CHWC enrolled as a provider with Arizona Medicaid. To obtain and retain patients for CHWC whose insurance could be billed for substance abuse treatment services, Mutwol and Koleosho offered and paid kickbacks and bribes to owners of residences that housed substance abuse treatment patients, in exchange for these residence owners referring patients for treatment to CHWC. Mutwol and Koleosho submitted $57 million of false and fraudulent claims to Arizona Medicaid for treatment services that were not provided, were not provided as billed, were not provided by qualified personnel, were so substandard that they failed to serve a treatment purpose, were not used or integrated into any treatment plan, and were medically unnecessary.

Babu Kaza of the Midwest Strike Force, Assistant Chief James Hayes of the National Rapid Response Strike Force, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Williams of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona.\n\nCentral District of California\n\nKyrollos Mekail, 36, of Moreno Valley, California, was charged by information with two counts of health care fraud in connection with an alleged scheme to fraudulently bill Medicaid of California (“Medi-Cal”) $307 million for medications that were medically unnecessary and in many instances not provided, and that were obtained through illegal kickbacks. Mekail was the pharmacist and owner of MONTE VP LLC d/b/a Monte Vista Pharmacy, a pharmacy located in Montclair, California. Medi-Cal generally required providers to obtain prior authorization before billing for certain medications, including medications that contained inexpensive generic ingredients but were manufactured in unique dosages, combinations, or package quantities, and were not included in the applicable maximum price lists that capped Medi-Cal reimbursements (“non-contracted, generic drugs”). However, as of January 2022, Medi-Cal temporarily suspended the prior authorization requirement. Beginning in May 2022, Mekail paid kickbacks to co-schemers for prescriptions for certain non-contracted, generic drugs (the “Fraud Scheme Medications”), for which Monte Vista could bill Medi-Cal. Other co-schemer medical providers were paid to write prescriptions for the Fraud Scheme Medications using the names and personal information of Medi-Cal patients provided by other co-schemers. Mekail then submitted false and fraudulent claims to Medi-Cal for purportedly dispensing the Fraud Scheme Medications knowing that the medications were medically unnecessary and in many instances were not provided, and that the prescriptions were obtained through kickbacks. In total, Mekail submitted and caused the submission of approximately $306,521,392 in false and fraudulent claims to Medi-Cal for purportedly dispensing the Fraud Scheme Medications, of which Medi-Cal paid approximately $204,032,151. In November 2023, the government seized approximately $108,683,368 in assets tied to the alleged scheme. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Niall M. O’Donnell and Trial Attorney Siobhan M. Namazi of the Los Angeles Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Roger A. Hsieh of the Central District of California. Assistant U.S. Attorney James E.

The case is being prosecuted by Assistant Chief Niall M. O’Donnell of the Los Angeles Strike Force and Assistant U.S. Attorney Benjamin R. Barron of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of California.\n\nNorthern District of California\n\nRiley Levy, 30, of Peoria, Arizona, was charged by information with conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in connection with his role in an unlawful scheme to distribute Adderall and other stimulants.

Trial Attorney Raymond Beckering III of the National Rapid Response Strike Force is prosecuting the case.\n\nEric Brewer, 28, of Lakeland, Florida, was charged by indictment with tampering with a consumer product and obtaining a controlled substance by fraud in connection with his unlawfully acquiring and tampering with fentanyl infusion bags. As alleged in the indictment, Brewer, a registered nurse who worked in intensive care units, engaged in two similar criminal schemes to divert fentanyl at five different Tampa-area hospitals across seven different dates. In the first scheme, which Brewer executed on several occasions, Brewer stole fentanyl by checking out 100 mL bags of liquid fentanyl from locked controlled substance cabinets but keeping the bags for himself rather than administering them to patients or returning them. In the second scheme, Brewer used hospital computers to research which patients were receiving fentanyl intravenously, entered those patients’ rooms even when he had no medical reason to do so, and surreptitiously siphoned fentanyl from their IV drip bags into his own vessel; Brewer would then go to the hospital bathroom, where he would inject himself with stolen fentanyl. Sometimes, Brewer tried to cover his theft by replacing the fentanyl he withdrew with an equivalent volume of saline, but sometimes he did not. In both scenarios, however, Brewer’s actions deprived the most vulnerable patients of needed medicine. Brewer was caught when colleagues observed him acting impaired during a shift and the person who entered the bathroom immediately after Brewer exited found a bloody paper towel and needle inside. Hospital officials subsequently examined records and video and discovered Brewer’s pattern of diversion. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mike Gordon of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida.\n\nSouthern District of Florida\n\nMarco Antonio Ramos Izquierdo, Marelys Ruiz Ulloa, 45, Jakeline Acnet Canova Cebrian, 58, Roberto Cisneros Cebrian, 53, Jose Antonio Rio Roche, 53, Reiniel Claro Estrada, 42, Maria De Los Angeles Abreu Perez, 37, Nelson Enrique Gonzalez Diaz, 38, Jonathan Jose Martinez Lambrano, 41, Ana Maria Gomez Contreras, 42, Levy Alberto Colina Garcia, 37, and Gloria Guillibeth Diaz Salas, 34, were charged by indictment with conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering for their role in distributing the proceeds of 14 durable medical equipment (“DME”) companies.

The indictment details how the DME companies transferred approximately $3,906,649 of the fraud proceeds to shell companies, including those owned by Ramos Izquierdo, Ruiz Ulloa, Canova Cebrian, Cisneros Cebrian, Rio Roche, and Claro Estrada. Those defendants then made cash withdrawals from their shell companies and also wrote checks from the shell companies that received these fraud proceeds to individual check cashers, including individual checks between $4,000 and $9,000 totaling a combined approximate amount of $2,513,381 made out to Abreu Perez, Gonzalez Diaz, Martinez Lambrano, Gomez Contreras, Colina Garcia, and Diaz Salas.

Acosta falsified and backdated claims forms for submission to BCBS that falsely and fraudulently represented that various health care benefits had been provided by Phoenix Rehab to beneficiaries of BCBS and ASO insurance plans managed by BCBS.
