        "text": "Nyomi participated in our Youth and Young Adult program and utilized Good Rides transportation for a successful internship this summer. Nyomi said, “Goodwill has allowed me to engage in professional development experiences and internship opportunities I would not be able to attend otherwise while I save for a vehicle of my own. Everyone from the management to the drivers are extremely kind and accommodating, and I’m so grateful for the services Goodwill provides!”\n\nFor more information on all of Goodwill Industries of NW Ohio, Inc. programs; https://bit.ly/_MissionServices\n\n6/7/2024\n\nOwens and Goodwill are partnering to provide enhanced training options for people seeking to improve their workforce training opportunities.\n\nThrough a new, customized virtual platform, individuals working with Goodwill will have access to learning experiences at Owens that connect directly to job success. The training courses are possible thanks to both organizations’ premium partner status with ed2go, a national network of online courses taught by experts from a variety of fields.\n\nGoodwill navigators will work directly with community members to find learning experiences tailored to their individual goals. Courses range from employability through customer service, conversational Spanish, business writing and leadership skills, to specific occupational preparation like interior designer, sign language interpreter and maintenance technician. New courses are added regularly.\n\nIn order to meet the needs of busy adults juggling family and job responsibilities courses are available entirely online, self-paced and available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. As Goodwill navigators and individuals arrive at specific educational goals, Owens will enroll them and support their journey to completion.\n\n“Owens is excited to work with Goodwill and expand access to education that benefits the local workforce and area employers,” said Charlene Page, executive director of Workforce and Economic Development at Owens. “The need for a highly-skilled workforce is clear to everyone. We are always looking to improve higher education access for adult learners and help them acquire the skills they need.”\n\nOwens and Goodwill have a history collaborating with a focus on workforce development.\n\n“The opportunity to lift up members of our community by working closely with Owens is a natural fit for Goodwill’s Job Connection Centers, where we believe in the power of work,” said David Takats, Chief Mission Officer at Goodwill. “Work helps to eliminate barriers and provides opportunities to improve peoples’ lives.”\n\nFor more information the ed2go classes, visit www.owens.edu/goodwill.\n\nContact:\n\nGoodwill Industries of Northwest Ohio, Inc.\n\nDavid Takats\n\nChief Mission Officer (419)-255-0070\n\ndtakats@goodwillnwohio.org\n\nBryona has been working with Goodwill since June of 2023. The process was slow moving at first due to unforeseen circumstances but through it all, Bryona maintained that she wanted to keep working toward her goals. She states, “I am proud of myself for sticking with my job search even when it’s been hard.” At the start of her journey, she was unsure of herself and her abilities. After completing job seeking skills training with her Job Developer, she is coordinating interviews, maintaining a consistent meeting schedule, and scheduling her TARPS rides independently – all things she hadn’t done previously. She expressed that she’s gained a lot of skills since working with Goodwill and “it’s a lot better than doing it on my own.” We are proud of you, Bryona!"
