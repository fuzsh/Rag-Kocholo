        "text": "The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) recently named 44 consumer liaison representatives for 2024. The 22 funded and 22 unfunded consumer representatives began their terms January 1. Seventeen of the funded consumer representatives and 11 of the unfunded representatives participated in the program in 2023.\n\nEstablished in 1992, the Consumer Participation Program promotes awareness of consumer-related issues through interaction with the NAIC's members, the insurance industry, and interested parties. The opinions expressed by consumer representatives who are designated as Individual Consumer Advocates do not necessarily represent the views of their employer/organization.\n\n\"The work of state-based insurance regulators is guided by the insurance needs and expectations of consumers,\" said NAIC President and Connecticut Department of Insurance Commissioner Andrew Mais. \"The Consumer Participation Program is a great resource.

The U.S. standard-setting organization is governed by the chief insurance regulators from the 50 states, the District of Columbia and five U.S. territories. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards and best practices, conduct peer reviews, and coordinate regulatory oversight. NAIC staff supports these efforts and represents the collective views of state regulators domestically and internationally."
