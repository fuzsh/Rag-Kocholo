        "text": "Age 90, of St. Louis, Missouri, passed away May 5, 2024. Maxine was born on July 28, 1933, to the late Vincent and Anna (nee Basler) Zoll in Ste. Genevieve, MO. After Maxine graduated from Valle High school in 1951, she went on to become an X-ray technician at St. John’s Hospital. It was at X-ray school that Maxine met Thomas Bailey, her husband of 59 years. They went on to have four children.\n\nMaxine was preceded in death by her sister Lorraine Uding (Frank, dec.); sons Vincent Bailey and Neal Bailey. She is survived by her husband Thomas, her two daughters Amy Bach and Wendy Atwood (Kevin), her 11 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren.\n\nMaxine valued her faith, friendships, and family above all. Her devotion to Mary was the source of her strength and focus for every decision she made throughout her life. She was active in her parish’s Pro-Life Club, and upheld Catholic and family traditions in her faith life and at home. She never forgot a birthday or to send a handwritten note to let you know she cared. In high school she was her volleyball team captain and cheer captain, as well as being chosen as May Queen and graduating as valedictorian. She was proud to be from Ste. Genevieve and to have graduated from Valle Catholic. Her generosity and spiritual values were an example for all who knew her.\n\nServices; A visitation will be held at Mary, Mother of the Church, on Saturday, May 11, at 10 am, with Mass immediately following at 11 am. Interment Valle Spring Cemetery (Ste Genevieve, MO) at 2PM on Sat. May 11th. Arrangements provided by Kutis South County."
