        "text": "Broken People\n\nI had a pretty good weekend! My daughter did well in her livestock showing, she played a piece by Bach in a piano recital. My greatest accomplishment was backing up the trailer at the barn. For some of you that is no big deal.\n\nBut my fear is so great that I don't think clearly. Last week, I parked it poorly, and it started to roll. I was angry trying to figure out what I did wrong.\n\nWhen I pointed out to my husband how frustrated I was, he calmly showed me something so basic, I was embarrassed. But in my fear, hurt, and rage, I couldn't see anything logically. Has anyone else ever been there?\n\nI read a great quote saying, \"Always leave people better than you found them. Hug the hurt, kiss the broke, befriend the lost, love the lonely.\"\n\nDoesn’t that sound wonderful? Easy? Someone is hurting, go hug them. It isn’t that easy is it?\n\nThe message at church was about loving the broken people. What a vision, isn’t it? Someone is desperate in need, you come along give them some love and understanding and magically they fall in love with God, and you were the go between. You leave filled up - Ah glory to God!\n\nIn truth it doesn’t work that way does it?\n\nBroken people are like picking up broken glass from the floor. Pieces can stab you, make you bleed - all while you were trying to be of service. It is hard! It requires a level of patience, tolerance, less of me, that I quite frankly don't always have. Do any of us? I think that is why Jesus says apart from me you can do nothing.\n\nMy initial reaction to being cut or hurt for trying to do good is a few choice cuss words and then a wall forms around me. Then thoughts that go something like the next time…and they better watch it…etc.\n\nBroken people are hardened by life. Broken people put up walls. Broken people hurt others.\n\nLook around you. So much of this world is an eye for an eye. So much is hate meets hate. Standing in love? That is hard.\n\n1 Peter 5:7 says Cast your anxiety on him because he cares for you.\n\nLet it go? Give it to him? Don’t fight back? Can you do that? I admit I am bad at it.\n\nIt does remind me that every single time I have tried to fight a battle on my own I have lost. The solutions I have, the answers I believe are not always the right ones. I don’t see someone’s heart. I don’t see the pain or the ache. I do feel the effects of their brokenness though. And maybe that is why relationships are so hard.\n\nHow do you treat people when you are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired? When your world is falling apart?\n\nThe pastor asked who is your greatest encourager? I am so grateful to say, it is my husband and my daughter. They are far better people than me.\n\n1 Corinthians 13:4–7 says, Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful... endures all things.\n\nThe pastor discussed some of the hardest people to forgive are family. Don't quote me, maybe he didn't say this at all but it is what I remember.\n\nMaybe I expect certain things from extended family. Maybe I expect that they are in my corner and believe in me. Maybe they expect the same from me but see those expectations differently. I don't have the answers. But I did realize sitting in church, I have more grievances then I would like to admit.\n\nLife is messy and complicated. People will hurt you daily. How do you respond? Walls up?\n\nMaybe that's why we pray for each other because I am exasperated with certain people in my family. And maybe that's why you need someone to pray for your loved ones. Admit it, we all get fed up.\n\nWho hasn't prayed, \"God, not sure what the point is, they will never change.\" Or is that just me?\n\nI read a quote, \"Relationships are like broken glass. Sometimes it's better to leave them broken than hurt yourself trying to put the pieces back together.— Alex Haditaghi"
