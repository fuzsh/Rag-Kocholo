        "text": "VOICE\n\nErin Brittain, Soprano, has been described by critics as having an “exquisite,” “evanescent,” and “expressive” voice. She has sung for audiences in the U.S. and Europe and performed over 30 roles in opera, operetta, and musical theater. In recent years her solo and choral work has included performances with the Princeton Festival, Opera Fayetteville, American Symphony Orchestra, Bard Music Festival, MasterVoices, and the New York Virtuoso Singers, in venues including Carnegie Hall, Alice Tully Hall, and the Kaufman Music Center. She recently appeared as a soloist in a performance of Ernest Bloch’s Sacred Service with MasterVoices, drawing praise from reviewers for her “crystal soprano [that] ascends gorgeously...like a voice of purity.” She is a founding member of The Perspective Collective, a chamber ensemble that has commissioned, developed, and performed art song and mini-opera projects. The group recently premiered works by Stephanie Leotsakos and Sunny Knable, and will bring both productions to the U.K. in 2023. She earned her B.A. from New York University and her M.A. from the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins, both in classical voice. This is her first appearance with Berkshire Bach.\n\nTeresa Buchholz, Mezzo-Soprano, a graduate of the Yale University Opera Program, Indiana University, and the University of Northern Iowa, is one of the most versatile artists on the stage today. She spent several summers as a young artist with the Santa Fe Opera, the Opera Theatre of St. Louis, and the Natchez Opera, and enjoys success in the realms of opera, art song, and oratorio. She recently performed as a soloist for a staged version of Bach’s St. Matthew Passion with Gulfshore Opera (FL), Bach’s Magnificat with Voices of Ascension, and Berlioz’s Les nuits d’été with the Bard College Orchestra. She has performed roles as diverse as Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd with Opera Roanoke, Orlofsky in Die Fledermaus with Asheville Lyric Opera, the title role in Giulio Cesare in Egitto with Opera Roanoke, Verdi’s Requiem with the New Jersey Choral Society, Mozart’s Requiem with the Tulsa Symphony, the Stamford Symphony, and Voices of Ascension (NYC), and Brahms’s Alto Rhapsody at the Bard Music Festival. In 2013 she was the winner of the female division in the Nico Castel International Master Singer Competition. This is her sixth appearance with the Berkshire Bach Ensemble.\n\nMargaret Dudley, Soprano, has established herself as a force to be reckoned with in the national concert arena. Acclaimed for her “sparkling voice” and “full-toned soprano,” she is a core member of Boston’s renowned Lorelei Ensemble, touring the nation and collaborating with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, A Far Cry, and Cantus. Recent engagements include soprano soloist in Haydn’s Missa in tempore belli and Vivaldi’s Gloria at Carnegie Hall, Handel’s Messiah at Alice Tully Hall, Poulenc’s Gloria with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s, Bach’s St. Matthew Passion with the Hudson Valley Singers, the premier of Julia Wolfe’s Fire in My Mouth with the New York Philharmonic, and soprano soloist with the Choir of Trinity Wall Street. Additionally, she is in demand as an ensemble singer, performing with the Santa Fe Desert Chorale, the Crossing, Oregon Bach Festival, New York Virtuoso Singers, and New York Choral Artists. This is her second appearance with the Berkshire Bach Ensemble.\n\nSean Fallen, Tenor, is an active opera and oratorio soloist in New York City, the U.S., and worldwide. Recent operatic roles include Alfredo in La Traviata, Danilo in The Merry Widow, Cassio in Otello, Nemorino in The Elixir of Love, Ariel in the world premiere of The Rape of the Lock, Goatherd in the world premiere of My Undying Love, and Almaviva in The Barber of Seville. He has been the featured tenor soloist numerous times at Carnegie Hall, most recently in Lili Boulanger’s Psalm 130, in the Bach Magnificat, Haydn&#39;s Paukenmesse, Kurt Weill’s The Road to Promise, and Handel’s Messiah (a specialty).
