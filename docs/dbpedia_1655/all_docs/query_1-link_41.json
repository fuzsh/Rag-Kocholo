[ Birds chirping ] My father was the oldest of 12, and he became an engineer.\n\nBeing the oldest, my father had the most responsibility.\n\nBut, as it turns out, he was also the most handsome, the most articulate, the best English.\n\nMany women would have loved him, but he chose my mother.\n\nThis is 1959.\n\nHere we are having a carefree moment.\n\nThe family goes off into the future.\n\nAnd this shot, that's my little brother, and that's me.\n\n[ Piano music playing ] -I have fond memories of my mom playing piano.\n\nShe would play Mozart, Beethoven, um, Bach.\n\nShe was brilliant.\n\nThey really wanted us to be engrossed in the American values, and that's why I don't have an accent.\n\nThey really wanted to be perfect Americans.\n\nBut I know later in years, they also wanted to make sure that we understood where the Chinese culture came from, our heritage, and what was respected.\n\n-This is me on my 4th birthday.\n\nShe's my best friend to this day.\n\nThe one at the end, Sandy.\n\nHer mother and father were members of the original Joy Luck Club.\n\n♪♪ -All my parents' siblings were in China.\n\nSo, I always considered Amy and her siblings to be my cousins.\n\n[ Laughter ] The Joy Luck Club was formed by a few couples, all Chinese, who decided they wanted to be an investment group.\n\nThey would pick stocks, review them, and then they would socialize afterwards.\n\nMostly women played mahjong.\n\nThe men preferred to play cards.\n\nThen, about midnight, they would have a feast.\n\nWe would love it, as children.\n\nGet to stay up late, get to see our aunties and uncles.\n\n[ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ What I remember is there is this comfort level of being with like people, especially for my mom who grew up in Shanghai.\n\nAuntie Daisy, Amy's mom, was also from Shanghai.\n\nI can imagine how comforting that would feel.\n\n♪♪ I loved Amy's dad, Uncle John.\n\nHe had a really warm smile, really warm and welcoming demeanor.\n\n♪♪ -My father's avocation was the ministry, and it was my mother who made him quit the ministry because it was a life of poverty.\n\nHe went back to his former occupation in engineering.\n\nHe worked seven days a week.\n\nMy mother worked, as well.\n\nHe also was going to school, getting a master's degree, and, in his spare time, he was still substitute preaching.\n\n♪♪ -Auntie Daisy was a spitfire.\n\nShe was small.\n\nShe spoke rapidly.\n\nI could hear her voice, like, \"Amy-ah,\" with this furrowed brow.\n\n♪♪ -This is a mother who would tell me things like, \"You should never let anyone tell you who you should be or what you should do.\n\nYou should never let anyone talk down to you.\n\nYou should never feel you have to get married if you don't want to get married.\n\nAnd no one should tell you you must have a baby -- not your husband, not your mother-in-law, not your friends.\"\n\nShe said, \"But you should have a good job, because if you do get married and your husband is mean, you can leave him immediately without question.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] My mother had other advice like that, like crossing the street.\n\nA lot of parents look both ways, you know.\n\nMy mother did the look both ways, but she said, \"You don't look, maybe a car comes, smash you flat like a sanddab, both eyes on one side of your face.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] You never forget after that.\n\nYou never forget.\n\nI remember this fear of shame.\n\nWhen it was my birthday, I was so afraid my mother would do something like bring Chinese food.\n\nAnd I remember being relieved when she brought the requisite cupcakes.\n\nMy father was an amateur photographer, and he liked to pose people.\n\nPosed.\n\nPosed.\n\nHe was a good photographer.\n\nSee how they loved my older brother?\n\nThe golden child.\n\nThey were constantly comparing me and my brother Peter.\n\nHe was always doing well.\n\nHe skipped a grade.\n\nHe was independent and polite and behaved, and they would say, \"Why can't you be more like Peter?\"\n\nI loved my brother Peter.\n\nHe was my hero.\n\nHe was the person who taught me so many different things, and he never made himself to be superior, but I really sensed it, especially from my father.\n\nThis past year, while examining the contents of those boxes, I was gratified to learn that many of my childhood memories were largely correct.\n\nBut there were also shocking discoveries about my mother and father, including a little white lie they told me when I was 6.\n\nWhen I was in the first grade, the woman came to our school, took me into this little room, gave me -- I don't know, she probably called them puzzles or something because I was a little kid.\n\nAbout a few weeks later, I came home from school, and there she was in the living room, and she was talking to my mom and dad.\n\nAnd then the woman left, and my parents said to me -- They were all excited, and they said, \"You know, you took this test, and the lady said to us you are smart enough to be a doctor.\n\nYou are going to be a doctor.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] So that's how my career was decided, on the basis of a test.\n\nNow I was going to be a doctor and a concert pianist on the weekend.\n\nA lot of people think I'm joking, but this truly was the expectation.\n\n[ Piano music playing ] ♪♪ -When I was 9 years old, my mother's version of believing in me was believing that I could be anything, anything she wanted.\n\nThe best piano prodigy this side of China.\n\n-I resented the piano.\n\nIt was a little slave master, you know, where I had to get everything right.\n\nYou know, the right rhythm, the right fingering, the right notes, the right expression.\n\nSo, I didn't really get a chance to enjoy music as my mother would have hoped.\n\nI was getting ready for my first recital, which was a talent show at the church.\n\nAnd you can see, I have on patent leather shoes and this beautiful violet dress.\n\n[ Applause ] I had memorized a piece -- Bach.\n\nSimple minuet.\n\nI started playing.\n\n[ Piano playing ] ♪♪ And I got stuck about five measures in.\n\nI started over again, and I got stuck in the same place.\n\nI did it over and over until the audience started to clap, and I knew I was being sent away.\n\n[ Piano playing ] [ Laughter ] I told my mother I did not want to play the piano anymore.\n\nAnd she said, \"Okay, fine, why you listen to me?\n\nNo play piano, go outside.\n\nPlay there.\n\nDon't have to listen to mother because maybe soon, I dead anyway.\"\n\n♪♪ She was not a tiger mom.\n\nShe was a suicidal mother.\n\nAnd that's very different from simply being a demanding mother who wants that kind of perfection.\n\nIt was, \"If you don't feel the way that I do, I might as well kill myself.\"\n\nVery different.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ There was a Sunday when it was my birthday.\n\nWe all went to church.\n\nMy mother decided to stay behind.\n\nI don't know why, but when we returned home, I had been expecting a cake.\n\nAnd instead, the furniture was turned upside-down.\n\nAll the chairs in the living room, the coffee table was just as though she had thrown everything.\n\nThere was going to be no cake and no lunch and no dinner.\n\n♪♪ My father took me out that day.\n\nWe went up to a hill, and he took some pictures.\n\nMy father posed me and told me to look at him, and I wouldn't because I was crying.\n\n♪♪ I know that the situations that would cause her to become almost insane is if you did not, in her mind, respect her.\n\nSo, she might have said something, and you just ignored it, or you said something critical about her in front of somebody else.\n\nThat was suicide.\n\nThat was gonna trigger suicide.\n\nShe had no way of coping with anything like that.\n\n♪♪ The girl and her brothers are sitting in the back seat of the car, coming back from church.\n\nHer mother turns to her father to say something, and right away, she knows it's bad.\n\nHer voice is broken, squeaky, and jagged as words scrape through her throat.\n\n\"That what you want?\n\nYou want to go, then go!\n\nOr I go first.\"\n\nHer father reaches for her mother's hand.\n\nBut she snatches it back.\n\nIt's getting worse.\n\nAnd just as she thinks that, her mother grunts something that sounds like, \"Mm-hmm.\n\nMaybe I'll kill myself right now, then everybody happy.\"\n\n[ Door creaks ] She hears the car door creak.\n\nIt's cracked open.\n\nThe car swerves one way and then the other.\n\nHer mother puts her right leg out the car door.\n\nThe road grabs her mother's right shoe, and it's gone in an instant.\n\nHer mother leans her whole body out, then the car swerves again, and she feels the tires slip and go off the road.\n\nAnd soon, she hears the sound of crunching gravel until they stop.\n\n[ Tires screech ] When she sits up, she sees her mother is still in the car.\n\nFinally, her mother gives up and says, in a howling kind of voice, \"I want to die.\"\n\n♪♪ And then the girl feels her cheeks.\n\nShe's crying, and she doesn't know when it started.\n\nShe just wants everything to be over.\n\n♪♪ At that time, I wrote.\n\nI wrote stories.\n\nWriting was almost like letters to myself, and often, they had to do with angry feelings I had say with my mother or, um, something I was frustrated about.\n\nSo, it was like a confidant in a way.\n\nBut it never occurred to me that I could be a writer.\n\nI wanted to be an artist.\n\nDrawing was very private, and I could do it for hours.\n\nPencil drawings mostly -- a cat, a horse, a girl, a tree, a house, whatever it was.\n\nIt was private.\n\nI think what intruded was this notion it had to be perfect, and I saw other kids who were better at drawing.\n\nAnd then ultimately, I had an art teacher who said I wasn't very creative, that I had no imagination and that I didn't have what it would take to get to a deeper level of creativity.\n\nAnd, you know, at that point, um, it seemed there were enough signs that I should not pursue that.\n\nPlus, my parents would be extremely disappointed if I did something that was purely fun.\n\nWhether it's encouragement or discouragement, it just stays with you.\n\nI remember I asked my mother, \"Would I be considered beautiful in China?\"\n\nShe says, \"Well, maybe average.\"\n\nAnd I was so crushed, because I thought, \"Well, I'm -- I'm kind of ugly in American culture.\n\nWouldn't I be at least beautiful in Chinese culture?\"\n\nNo.\n\n[ Chuckling ] I was average.\n\nSo much for my mother's honesty.\n\n♪♪ -Auntie Daisy and Uncle John were two of the founding members of The Joy Luck Club.\n\nAnd Uncle John actually came up with the name Joy Luck Club.\n\nAnd they were regular members until Peter had his brain tumor and Uncle John had his.\n\n-Shortly after this Christmas, my older brother Peter was discovered to have an inoperable brain tumor.\n\nMy father, the Baptist minister, prayed to God and had the congregations pray for a miracle.\n\nMy mother joined him in all of this, wrote letters.\n\nEvery day, it was a visit to my brother who was unconscious.\n\n♪♪ At the end of six months, two weeks before my brother died, my father was diagnosed with a glioblastoma, with a brain tumor.\n\n♪♪ -When Peter was diagnosed with his brain tumor, it seemed like a short period of time from when he died.\n\nSix months later, Uncle John died.\n\nAnd, s-- I think Uncle John might have been in the hospital when Peter died.\n\nSo he couldn't really be where he wanted to be, with his son.\n\n-Two weeks before my father died, a minister came to counsel me because I had been discovered reading a very bad book, \"Catcher in the Rye.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] Banned book.\n\nHe was a youth minister, and he came into the room, and we were sitting on the bed, and he was talking about how I had caused my father more pain than the brain tumor.\n\nSo, I started to cry, of course.\n\nAnd then he said, \"Let's pray for forgiveness.\"\n\nAnd we did, and I was still crying.\n\nHe said, \"You shouldn't cry now.\"\n\nAnd I was still crying, and then he started to tickle me on my side.\n\nAnd then he threw me on the bed.\n\nAnd he tickled me even further.\n\nHe tickled me all over.\n\nHe tickled me under my dress.\n\nAnd when he was done, he said to me, \"You have a very dirty mind, and no one's going to believe you.\"\n\nSo I came out of that room a very angry girl.\n\nI was a daddy's girl.\n\nI loved my older brother.\n\nThey were my protectors, and they were gone.\n\nI was left with this crazy, suicidal mother.\n\n♪♪ After my father and brother died, my mother was in such turmoil over what we were going to do with the rest of our lives.\n\nShe thought it was a curse, and she started seeing omens in everything.\n\nOne day, she was washing dishes, and she picked up this can of, I think it was called Old Dutch Cleanser.\n\nand she just said, \"Holland.\n\nHolland is clean.\n\nWe're moving to Holland.\"\n\nWith anybody else, that would be a joke, but with my mother, that was the reason why she decide we go to Holland.\n\nMaybe we would be able to outrun this curse that was after us.\n\n-We packed all our clothes.\n\nThe furniture went to relatives.\n\nI didn't even know that she sold the house.\n\nWe ended up on a boat.\n\n-This is my mother and all of us going to the Netherlands.\n\nWe arrived with no idea where we were going to live.\n\nAnd we ended up drifting.\n\nWe ended up going to Switzerland.\n\n-We lived on a little chalet on a mountain.\n\nBeautiful.\n\nWe could see Lake Geneva every day, waking up to Lake Geneva.\n\n-And here's the house where I used to live.\n\nHere's the window in the bedroom.\n\nThere's the view of Montreux.\n\nAnd what happened there was not only all the pent-up anger I had had and was not able to express about the death of my brother and father, it was now the freedom to have boyfriends, to be friends with rich girls who wore makeup.\n\nI started smoking.\n\nI almost ran off and eloped with a German army deserter.\n\nMy mother thought he was going to ruin me, and she could do nothing to dissuade me.\n\n-When my mom was on her own, there was a lot of grief and a lot of shouting.\n\nShe was angry of everything that was happening.\n\n-We had many, many arguments.\n\nI remember times when I would go into the bathroom so she couldn't see me.\n\nI would be absolutely placid, and I'd go in the bathroom, and then I'd have dry heaves.\n\nAnd then I'd come out, and I didn't want her to see that it affected me whatsoever.\n\nNothing that she said could change me.\n\n-It was part of my decision to not be like her at all, to not have those emotions.\n\nBut I came home one day, and she was raging.\n\nShe had this way of breathing.\n\nIt was [Breathing heavily] like that, and her face was crazed.\n\nAnd she pushed me, and she kept pushing me into the bedroom, and she locked it from the inside, and she tossed the key somewhere.\n\nAnd she had this cleaver.\n\nAnd she backed me up against the wall, and she just said, \"It's enough.\n\nIt's time.\n\nI'm going to kill you first and then D.D.\"\n\n-- That's what we called my brother -- \"And then I'm going to kill myself, and we will all be with Daddy and Peter.\"\n\nAnd sh-- Her eyes were different.\n\nHer eyes were glazed.\n\nIn a way, they were gone.\n\nIt wasn't just anger.\n\nIt was, she was gone.\n\nAnd I thought, she's really -- She's crazy.\n\nShe's gonna do it.\n\nAnd I remember looking out the window, looking out on Lake Geneva and the French Alps and I just looked, and I said, \"This is it, and it's so sad.\n\nIt's so sad that this is what it has come to.\"\n\nAnd what came out of my throat -- I thought was a complete betrayal to me -- was a voice.\n\nThe voice said, \"I want to live.\n\nI want to live.\n\nI want to live.\"\n\n♪♪ When that voice said, \"I want to live.\n\nI want to live,\" that was the end of it.\n\nThat's all I remember up and to that point.\n\nAfter a while, I found out that I could graduate a year early.\n\nI had my reason to leave home.\n\n-After they moved, we didn't see them for a few years.\n\nAnd then when Amy and her family came back from Switzerland, I guess I was a freshman in college at San Jose State.\n\nAnd Amy and her boyfriend, Lou, had transferred from Linfield College.\n\nI looked them up, and we started seeing each other again.\n\nI had to get used to the idea that there was this guy now in the picture.\n\n-Lou was actually a blind date.\n\nI was in a sorority, and somebody decided for some crazy reason to ask him to go to a function.\n\nAnd when I found out what she had done, I said, \"I am not going out with this guy.\"\n\n-It wasn't exactly love at first sight.\n\nIt was more maybe cluelessness at first sight because I wasn't, uh, adversely reacting to all of the things that Amy did to make it seem that she wanted nothing to do with me.\n\n-He was mellow, nice, handsome.\n\n-He was built in a muscle way that I've always found unattractive in men.\n\nI always feel that the amount of muscle mass kind of detracts from the mass in the brain.\n\nWe overcame these faults of his somehow.\n\n-Within a month, it was pretty evident that we were going to make a go of it.\n\n-Dad, Mom?\n\n-Hi.\n\n-This is Rose Hsu, my girlfriend.\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Hi.\n\n-His parents did not like me and always trying to get us to break up.\n\nShe said it was because of the Vietnam War.\n\n-He's going to be working with his father in the company, and, uh, he's going to be judged by people of a different standard, and they won't be as understanding as we are.\n\n-Mrs. Jordan, you sound as if Ted and I are getting married.\n\nThat's hardly the case.\n\n-Oh, I know, dear, it's just that, well, the way the world is, how unpopular Vietnam was -- -I'm not Vietnamese.\n\nI'm American.\n\n-I would not want to dismiss them as hard-core racists.\n\nThey weren't that.\n\nBut they still had difficulty accepting Amy that was a cloud on the relationship really, through-- throughout our lives.\n\n-We were so young, and he didn't know how to stand up for me to his parents.\n\nAnd so I said, \"This is it.\n\nEither we get married, or it's over.\"\n\nSo that was the proposal.\n\n[ Chuckles ] And he said, \"Oh, okay.\"\n\n[ Laughs ] Four months later, we got married.\n\n[ Chuckles ] He was such a nice guy, and I had the thought that my father would have liked him.\n\n-I lived with my mom in San Leandro.\n\nI think I was 16 or 17 years old.\n\nAmy and Lou had come down to visit.\n\n-Shrimp, my favorite.\n\n-And my mom had made over -- I would say, 200 to 300 pot stickers.\n\nAnd they came, and they ate most of them.\n\nOh, my God.\n\nHe just, like, wolfed those down.\n\nI was so pissed.\n\n[ Laughs ] I said, \"Don't ever bring him back.\"\n\n-All this needs is a little soy sauce.\n\n-[ Gasps ] -The entire world assumes it must be me.\n\nI can't count the times I've -- I've met people, and they say, \"I know you.\n\nYou were the guy who said, 'All it needs is a little soy sauce.'\"\n\nAnd I think the irony to that story is that I actually managed to make a halfway decent first impression.\n\n-He's like a brother to me.\n\nI mean, when I lost my brother, he came into my life.\n\nHe supported me as much as possible.\n\nAnd he was very conscious of keeping my mom happy and so forth.\n\n-There was a brief period of time that I actually probably had a better relationship with Amy's mother than Amy did.\n\nThey were at loggerheads because Amy was finally telling her mother, \"No, I'm not going to be a medical doctor and a concert pianist by night,\" you know.\n\n\"I'm going to do this my way.\"\n\nThere you are, puffing away.\n\n-Oh.\n\n-[ Laughs ] -You've turned it on?\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-Oh, no.\n\nMy mother will see this, and she'll be... -She won't approve.\n\n-...qi si le.\n\nAt that point, I really had the love-hate relationship with my mother.\n\nI knew what kind of support she needed to not kill herself.\n\nSo I'd started writing letters to her when I went to college.\n\n\"Dear Mom, Boy!\n\nIt sure was good talking to you on the telephone, even though I didn't say anything too profound.\"\n\nAnd in a way, it was similar to what I do now with characters.\n\nI have to make myself emotionally like those characters.\n\nAnd that's what I did with my mother.\n\nIt was necessary 'cause she was alone in the world.\n\nShe needed that.\n\n-Lou and I talked about kids, and I was a little afraid that, what if I had a child who would be -- A, like me once they are a teen, you know, a lot of trouble, or would be -- be sick, like my brother, die.\n\nI would have been a terrible mother.\n\nI would have been like my mother.\n\nI would have been worried all the time about every single possibility of disease and danger.\n\nAnd so that became the decision.\n\n-Hi.\n\n-Hello.\n\n-Oh, look at you.\n\n-Whoops!\n\nLook at you!\n\n-I wonder if you could just tell us a little bit about your pre-\"Joy Luck Club\" world.\n\n-You know, I had another bestseller.\n\nIt sold -- You know what these numbers are.\n\nWhen you have a bestseller, you have to sell a certain amount in the first week.\n\nI'd sold 80,000 copies and went in for two reprints.\n\nIt was called \"Telecommunications and You.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] It was published for IBM, and -- [ Laughter ] I was a business writer before I started writing fiction.\n\n-Amy was a linguistics and English major.\n\nAnd I remember her wanting to write.\n\nJohn, my husband, started a business.\n\nHe had one phone line that was Dial-a-Joke, another phone line that was Dial Michael Jackson, and another one that had astrology.\n\nSo he hired Amy to write astrology.\n\nShe was very creative, and she would make it up.\n\n[ Laughter ] -I was doing a little bit of ad copy, direct mail, the really sleazy stuff.\n\nYou know, like, \"Do these exercises, and your vision will become perfect,\" or, \"Study this course, and you'll be a doctor.\"\n\nI had materials I wrote for a telecommunications company.\n\nI was the subject matter expert on ISDN and wide area networks and the divestiture of AT&T, all subjects I had absolutely no interest in.\n\nI was doing really well.\n\nI had a lot of clients.\n\nI was working about 90 billable hours a week, and -- which meant I didn't have a lot of time to sleep or eat or be social.\n\nAnd I was looking for something more meaningful, and that's why I started writing fiction.\n\nI met somebody who encouraged me to read fiction again, and she gave me a reading list, and she was a writer.\n\nAnd I started to write, and the things I discovered about writing at that point were so important to me.\n\nIt was the notion that you could write and find out what you really believed and felt.\n\nAll these things that had been submerged, they just came out.\n\nAnd it was through fiction, because fiction gave you a place of safety.\n\nIt wasn't about you.\n\nIt was about these characters.\n\nBut it was about you.\n\nAnd at that point, I knew I would write the rest of my life.\n\nI would write fiction the rest of my life.\n\n1985.\n\n33 years old.\n\nI never was so egotistical as to think I could make a living doing that.\n\n-The telling moment for Amy and her mother was when we were on vacation in Hawaii.\n\nShe got a phone call from her brother.\n\nHe said that mom had just had a heart attack, and this sounded like a life-threatening situation.\n\n-As I went to a phone booth to call the hospital, I was sure it was too late.\n\nAs I waited to be connected, I made a vow to God and whoever was listening, if my mother lives, I will get to know her.\n\nI will ask her about her past, and this time, I'll actually listen to what she has to say.\n\nWhy, I'll even take her to China, and, yes, I'll write stories about her.\n\nAll at once, I heard my mother's voice.\n\n\"Amy-ah.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mom.\n\nAre you okay?\"\n\n\"Yes.\n\nFine.\n\nFine.\"\n\n\"Listen, I thought you had a heart attack.\n\nI thought --\" My mother cut me off with a huff.\n\n\"Heart attack?\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\nI go to fish market, and the fishmonger, he try cheating me.\n\nMake me so mad.\n\nAll sudden, I got a pain in my chest, hurt me so bad, so I drive to Kaiser Hospital.\n\nTurn out I have angina caused by stress.\n\nSo you see, that fishmonger, he wrong.\n\nStressed me out.\"\n\n-Buy something like this.\n\n-What is it?\n\nLooks good.\n\n-After I hung up, I heard a voice saying, \"Hey, don't forget, now.\n\nYou promised.\"\n\n♪♪ I started to ask her about her life, and I listened.\n\nInstead of saying, \"I'm really busy now.\n\nI can't -- I can't listen to you,\" I would listen to everything.\n\nAnd that profoundly changed everything.\n\nI wasn't fighting it anymore, and I learned a lot by simply being quiet and actually listening.\n\n-Remember you used to want to go back to China to live?\n\nWhy?\n\n-At about that time, Amy really started writing as a mental health break from all of the business work that she was doing.\n\nWhile Amy was writing these stories, she would frequently sit down and just let her mother tell her life story.\n\n-Okay, no.\n\n-Uh-huh, mm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nWhat month was that?\n\n-That's... -My dad and my mother never told us about their lives in China when we were growing up.\n\nAnd then later in the years, she finally said, \"You have sisters in China.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"What?\n\nSisters?\n\nWhat do you mean, sisters?\"\n\nYeah, she told us that we have three past sisters.\n\nI was just kind of, like, dumbfounded, like, what?\n\nI don't -- I don't know what are their names and how -- how old are they, where they've been living.\n\nThat kind of information took a while to figure out.\n\nAmy and Lou and Mom went back to China to go visit the family.\n\n-Yeah.\n\nLook where we are.\n\nWe're in Shanghai.\n\n[ Indistinct conversations in Mandarin Chinese ] -We went to China so Amy could really get close to Amy's mother's history and family.\n\n[ Indistinct conversations in Mandarin Chinese ] -We're on the train on our way to Qingdao.\n\n-It doesn't get any better than this.\n\nThis is the, uh, front of Communist Martyrs Hotel.\n\n[ Bird chirping loudly ] Piano that accompanied the building or the hotel, I guess.\n\n-Come on.\n\nCome on.\n\n[ Piano playing ] ♪♪ -I can't do it.\n\n♪♪ ♪♪ [ Indistinct conversations ] -After that, they decided to see if any of the siblings would want to come to America.\n\n-Amy.\n\n-Yeah?\n\n-[ Chuckles ] -Yes.\n\nOh, that picture is good.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n♪♪ I didn't understand until I was an adult what she meant by sacrifices.\n\nThey were all that she had left behind in Shanghai, where she had had a life of privilege starting from the age of 9, when her widowed mother married the richest man on the island outside of Shanghai.\n\nShe went from being the honorable widow of a poor scholar to a wealthy man's fourth wife, one of his concubines.\n\nOne version of clan history cast her as the victim of a rape by the rich man, which resulted in pregnancy.\n\n-[ Crying ] -To teach her husband a lesson, she swallowed opium.\n\nShe had only meant to scare him, my mother explained.\n\nShe died by accident.\n\nBut there were a few times when she acknowledged that her mother killed herself because she could not take it anymore.\n\nSometimes she felt the same, she would say.\n\n♪♪ She was about 18 here, and I think, to judge by how innocent she looks, it was before she married what -- who she called \"that bad man,\" a pilot who was supposed to marry her stepsister.\n\nThe man threw that woman over to marry my mother because she was beautiful.\n\nThis is when you were 18?\n\nYeah.\n\nMm.\n\nYou wore a white dress?\n\nMm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nYeah.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nJust so you know how bad he was, he was somebody who made his daughters bring home their schoolmates so he could rape them.\n\n[ Audience groaning ] This is a man my mother could not leave.\n\nBy the laws of marriage at that time, she -- she had to stay with him.\n\nAnd during that time with him, she had four children, a son and three daughters.\n\nThat first son that you had then, how did he die?\n\n\"Si ren bu guan,\" meaning doesn't something matter?\n\nYeah.\n\nOh -- \"Si ren bu guan.\"\n\n-Uh-huh.\n\n-\"He dies, I don't care.\"\n\n-Uh-huh.\n\n♪♪ -My father took this photo in Tianjin.\n\nHe was working for the U.S. Information Agency, and she was visiting that town with her sister-in-law.\n\nOnce she met him, she stayed, effectively abandoning her marriage.\n\nAnd this was during the height of my mother and father's affair.\n\nUnfathomable love during this time that could conquer everything.\n\n♪♪ They had this affair for at least two seasons, and then her husband, who hired a detective, had her hauled back to Shanghai and put in jail.\n\nShe tried to kill herself, of course, in jail, was hospitalized.\n\nAnd during that time, my father had his conscience stirred.\n\nAnd he felt that he played this terrible role in destroying this marriage and this family.\n\nHe pledged that he would love her forever, and if she could free herself, she should join him in the United States, and then he left.\n\nShe got the divorce eventually through trickery and through the help of relatives.\n\nWhat happens to a person when they leave their daughters behind?\n\nWhat kind of guilt comes up?\n\n♪♪ As my mother tells it, when they announced that John Tan's bride was coming from Shanghai, there were several women who shrieked and then ran out in tears.\n\n[ Chuckling ] I don't know whether that's true.\n\nShe was in love, so she did what she needed to do.\n\n♪♪ -It was hard to wrap my head around all the different aspects of Aunty Daisy's past.\n\nWhat helped is that I had a half-brother, and knowing the story of my grandmother being a concubine, which was not easy to say, because the culture is different, talking to people in the -- in the States.\n\nIt was hard, I think, for them to understand what that meant.\n\nI learned about Aunty Daisy's past, I think it was as Amy was developing her stories.\n\n-Amy had written a few stories that she didn't really connect up with as a novel or anything, but she went to the Squaw Valley Writers Conference and got a lot of good feedback to encourage her to keep writing.\n\n-I was teaching at Squaw Valley, and we had Wednesday afternoons off.\n\nSo a bunch of us took the tram up to the top of the mountain.\n\nI didn't know Amy.\n\nShe was in the tram.\n\nWe got up the mountain.\n\nIt started to hail, and the lightning was going.\n\nOur guide, who said he knew the mountain like the back of his hand, did, in the winter.\n\nHe was a ski instructor.\n\nHe did not know how to get us down in the summer.\n\nSo it took us maybe two or three hours.\n\nI mean, we're all good writers but bad athletes.\n\nWe're -- None of us were exactly in shape.\n\nAnd we edged our way down the ravines.\n\nAnd when we got to the bottom, Amy Tan unzipped her fanny pack and pulled out a single cigarette.\n\nAnd I remember they took a picture.\n\nThis white jersey skirt of mine was -- had been hailed on.\n\nIt had mud on it.\n\nIt had blood on it.\n\nIt was just sort of dragging around my ankles at that point.\n\nBut Amy looked perfect, and then the one cigarette.\n\nPerfect.\n\n[ Laughs ] The next day, she felt that we'd been through something together, and she asked if I would take a look at her story.\n\nAnd I did, and I loved it, and it was a mess, and I still loved it.\n\nAnd I remember saying to her, this would be wonderful.\n\nYou should break this into 12 separate short stories.\n\nAnd Amy said my favorite word as a student, \"Okay.\"\n\nAnd she did it.\n\nSo that's how it started, and it happened fast after that.\n\nIt happened very fast.\n\n-Molly Giles said, \"I think you should meet a writer I'm working with, Amy Tan.\"\n\nAnd so Amy came armed with an outline.\n\nAnd the title was \"Wind and Water.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, coming from California, I will be laughed out of Manhattan if I come in with a book called 'Wind and Water.'\"\n\nIn the synopsis were these four magical words, the Joy Luck Club.\n\nAnd I got goose pimples when I saw those words.\n\nThat's my goose pimple test.\n\nAnd I said, \"Could we use that as a title?\"\n\nAnd Amy said, \"that's just a club my parents have.\n\nYou know, they meet on Thursday nights.\n\nThey play mahjong.\"\n\n-It was like \"The Girl Scouts of America.\"\n\nI mean, it just sounded so prosaic, you know.\n\n-It's a stock planning club, you know?\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, you know, who doesn't want joy luck, and who doesn't want to be a member of that club?\"\n\nBy the way, there's now a restaurant in New York which is a derivative called the Soy Luck Club.\n\n[ Laughter ] -One of the nights we were at Amy and Lou's house was the night there was a bidding war for her first book.\n\nShe would excuse herself from our table, and she'd talk to her agent, and she'd come back, and she goes, \"Knopf just bid on my book.\"\n\nAnd then another phone call would come in, and, \"Putnam just bid on my book.\"\n\n-Amy thought, \"Well, I've got this contract.\n\nI get to write my book, and it will be published.\n\nBut in six months, it will be life back as we lived it before.\"\n\nAnd when it took off, did I expect it?\n\nNo, I did not.\n\n-\"The Joy Luck Club\" went right to #1 on the bestseller list.\n\n-When \"The Joy Luck Club\" hit, it really hit.\n\nIt was a revolution.\n\n[ Laughs ] -The book was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award.\n\n-It was the longest running #1 book on the New York Times bestseller list.\n\n-\"The Joy Luck Club\" was so massive when it came out.\n\nI mean, everybody loved it.\n\nIt was just a magical book to appear.\n\nThere was nothing like it.\n\n-And now I see that I am not the only one with the mother that says all of this stuff that sounds unbelievable.\n\n-It was hard to believe the success.\n\nEverybody embraced the book.\n\n-I have to tell her that she has accomplished a mission with me, showing that women do have histories.\n\nI don't experience that as a, you know, like, a political experience.\n\nThat's a deeply emotional experience for me to feel like now my history is part of a larger history, also.\n\n-It was published in 1989, and even then, I said to myself, \"This is not gonna last.\n\nI have to go back to the work that I had before to make a living.\n\nThis is for fun.\"\n\nAnd it took me from March until October to finally realize I could do this for the rest of my life, just write stories.\n\n-Tell me what you think your gift is that enables what you say to resonate with so many people.\n\n-I think in part, it's nothing unusual.\n\nIt's the fact that I'm a baby boomer.\n\nI'm an American born in this country, and I'm a baby boomer, and I have feelings that a lot of women my age have, and one of that is this fear of, what would I lose if I lost my mother?\n\nUm, what do I lose by not knowing about the past?\n\nIn me, they see their own daughters, just as ignorant, just as unmindful of all the truths and hopes they have brought to America.\n\nThey see daughters who grow impatient when their mothers talk in Chinese, who think they're stupid when they explain things in fractured English.\n\nThey see that joy and luck do not mean the same to their daughters, that to these closed, American-born minds, \"joy luck\" is not a word.\n\nIt does not exist.\n\nThey see daughters who will bear grandchildren born without any connecting hope passed from generation to generation.\n\n♪♪ -I was a voracious reader from an early age, and she was the first Asian-American author I had read, and she was the first person that was reflecting back to me part of a world I knew.\n\nShe showed me the glamorous Shanghai of the '30s.\n\nShe showed me all these back stories that I knew about and could relate to from my family story.\n\nAnd then, the counterpoint of that was to showcase the Asian-American experience, the second generation of daughters who have to deal with these mothers who came from China.\n\nThere were moments there that I could so relate to as an immigrant.\n\n-My mother saw danger in everything, even in other Chinese people.\n\nWhere we lived and shopped, everyone spoke Cantonese or English.\n\nMy mother was from Wuxi, near Shanghai, so she spoke Mandarin and a little bit of English.\n\n-Being bi-cultural is an asset for a writer.\n\nIt gives you curiosity.\n\nYou want to ask questions.\n\nYou want to understand deeply.\n\nAnd uh, in the answers, you get stories.\n\nThat's what Amy has been doing.\n\nShe observes her mother and her aunts and the culture, and at the same time, she totally belongs here.\n\nSo it's in the contrast, in the complexity, that she finds her language and her inspiration.\n\n-Not to do any disservice to the amazing Asian-American writers that came before Amy, but I think this was the first book to really cross over into becoming a mainstream, mass-market success.\n\nIt had such a huge impact on paving the way for other writers of color to tell their stories.\n\n-When I actually was about to be published, I gave my mother the book to read, and her remark was, \"It was so easy to read.\"\n\nShe, more than anyone, knew what was fiction, and that it wasn't some sort of autobiography, but she also knew the emotions and the situations, the conflicts that we had that were embedded in the story, and felt that I understood her completely.\n\nShe didn't have to tell me why she was angry about things or why she was worried about me.\n\nIt was all in the book.\n\n♪♪ -Amy and -- and myself, we write about emotions and relationships, and those are universal.\n\nSo reading Amy, I realize that, wow, these people are just like me, like my Latin American family.\n\nWhat's the difference?\n\nThose grandmothers are like my grandmother, and that makes it so close, so personal, so touching in so many ways.\n\nAnd I think that's what every reader feels anywhere in the world, in any language, when they read Amy.\n\n-You gonna make a curry, um, potato?\n\nOoh, yum!\n\n-Garlic.\n\n-Uh-huh.\n\n[ Sizzling ] -Lowest tech, huh?\n\n[ Rain pattering ] [ Cable car bell dings ] -Well, good evening, everyone, and thanks for coming out on this rainy night in San Francisco.\n\nI want to welcome you to the 25th anniversary of \"The Joy Luck Club.\"\n\nHow about a round of applause?\n\n[ Cheers and applause ] [ All speaking indistinctly ] -She is right, you know.\n\nThis cabbage -- -Don't put Chinese cabbage... -I remember when the \"Joy Luck\" movie came out.\n\nNow, The \"Joy Luck\" movie probably did more for her than the book.\n\nAnd, uh, it had all beautiful Asian actresses in it.\n\nIt was the first one of its kind that I can recall.\n\n[ All speaking indistinctly ] -You look younger all the time.\n\nHow is that?\n\n-I gave you my good skin.\n\n-Really?\n\n-I must have seen it five times on the big screen.\n\nThis was back in Texas.\n\nI was still living in Houston.\n\nAnd all my friends were white, but I was so proud to show them this movie, you know, of English-speaking, contemporary Asians.\n\n[ Chuckles ] -'Cause after the party, we're going to Lake Tahoe, and he actually asked her to come with us.\n\n-Oh, my God.\n\n-She'd have a great time.\n\n-Where's Jennifer?\n\n-Oh, her Aunty June is putting her down for a nap.\n\n-When I started to act in, uh, Hollywood, many films were just coolies or dragon ladies, railroad workers, restaurant owners.\n\nAnd I'm happy that this film portrayed Chinese as they are.\n\n-I really didn't register how big this movie was gonna be and what a long-lasting effect it would have on all -- all of our lives at the time.\n\n-Mm-hmm.\n\n-Amy had the very straight... -Yeah.\n\n-...bowl cut, and such a woman of style, and very, very, uh... -So down to earth.\n\n-Very down to earth, but with a certain gravitas.\n\n-When I first started writing, I made this list of things about who I should be as a writer, because I knew that it was very likely I would get sucked into all kinds of things and lose my way as a -- as a writer.\n\nSo, one of them was to make writing my focus.\n\nDon't get involved with things like film.\n\nRon Bass, who was a screenwriter, he said, \"Well, why don't you take a scene and write it?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No, I'm not getting involved with this.\"\n\n-I said, \"But I won't write the screenplay without you, because it is not just a wonderful book, it is an iconic book.\n\nIt is a book that has meaning to people of literature and people who are in your community.\n\nI need your voice.\"\n\n-And he said, \"Well, just try.\n\nYou know, I'll be writing it, but you just do one scene, and I think you will learn something about earning a scene.\"\n\nNow, that's like heroin for a writer.\n\nLike, earn the emotions of a scene.\n\nSo I thought, \"Well, okay, I could do one scene.\"\n\nAnd it went from there.\n\n-And, action!\n\nHere she's got a book that is iconic.\n\nAnd I would make suggestions, and she loved suggestions, and she would love to talk it through.\n\nShe had no pride of anything like, you know, \"Well, the public's gonna expect that, uh, this and this --\" No.\n\nJust, what tells the story the best?\n\n-My grades, my job, not getting married.\n\nEverything you expected of me.\n\n-No expect anything.\n\nNever expect.\n\nOnly hope.\n\nOnly hoping best for you.\n\n-I remember one night, I went to the market.\n\nand after I shopping, I go to my car.\n\nI see one big man ran to me.\n\nI was scare, and I-I was trying to holding my -- my purse and -- and ready for an attack or something.\n\nAnd the man say, \"No, w-wait a moment.\n\nI-I just want to say that thank you so much for your character in...\" -Aww.\n\n-\"...in -- in 'The Joy Luck Club.'\n\nI cried and I cry.\n\nI just lost my mother.\"\n\n-Oh.\n\n-\"I lost my mother, and I see you scene, and I-I just want to say thank you.\"\n\nSo I drive home, and tear came to my eyes.\n\nI realize that \"Joy Luck Club,\" how wonderful the story is.\n\nIt's about the relationship, mother-daughter or mother-children.\n\n-Mm-hmm.\n\n-It doesn't matter that we are Asian or not Asian.\n\nEverybody has a mother.\n\n-[ Crying ] ♪♪

you try to take it.\n\nEverybody else want best quality.\n\n-When we went to the premiere in Hollywood, my mother was there.\n\nAnd I was a little afraid of what was going to happen, because there were scenes in that movie that were based on what had happened to her as a little girl.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-Uh, watching her mother die.\n\nAnd the lights come up, end of the movie, everybody's crying, and I look at her, and she's clear-eyed.\n\nAnd I said, \"Are you okay?\n\nI mean, was that too sad or too har--\" She goes, \"Oh, no.\"\n\nYou know, \"Everything in China, oh, oh, so much worse.\n\nThis really better.\"\n\n[ Laughter ] And now I thought, okay.\n\n-One of the things for Amy is that early success was so huge that she had to feel, well, now, how do you follow that?\n\n-Was it scary to follow up a hit like \"The Joy Luck Club\"?\n\n-Scary isn't the word.\n\nI think it was more like, um, near death throes.\n\n[ Both laugh ] After I wrote \"The Joy Luck Club,\" I was stuck.\n\nI made probably seven starts at a novel and abandoned them all.\n\nMeanwhile, my mother is saying, \"Write my true story.\"\n\nShe had read \"The Joy Luck Club,\" but she knew it was fiction.\n\nShe wanted to be able to tell, \"Yeah, this is my story.\"\n\nAnd I said, you know, \"Ma, it's -- That's not how fiction is written.\n\nIt's not really about true stories, and --\" But when I got stuck, I thought, you know, what is the reason for me to write this?\n\nIt's really to understand myself and how I came to have these thoughts.\n\nAnd it's -- it's also to give my mother a gift that I was really listening.\n\nSo I said, that's what I'm gonna do.\n\nShe loved the idea she was helping me to write.\n\nYou know, she'd -- she'd call me up at different hours of the day to, \"I have something else to say,\" and she'd go on for an hour, and I said, \"You know, I --\" I didn't want to get her upset, but I said, \"I-I have to get some work done.\"\n\n\"Oh, okay,

gave up.\n\nEven though she lived in a society that offered her no choices, um, that -- that gave her unbelievable sorrow, she somehow could find a strength and rise above that.\n\n-[ Speaking indistinctly ] [ Laughs ] -Chinese-Americans are becoming an increasingly dynamic and visible element of American society, in business, science, the arts, and literature.\n\nWe have the views of novelist Amy Tan, who was born in... -The Chinese-American community, uh, has been a great success in North America.\n\n-So, when you started writing, did you feel that suddenly you were responsible somehow to the history of, you know, your people in the United States, if such a thing is possible?\n\n-Well, first let me say that when I -- when I think about \"your people,\" I-I think of myself as being an American, as well.\n\n-Indeed.\n\n-And so, \"your\" includes both being Chinese and American, or Chinese-American or whatever...\n\nI didn't seek to be a politician.\n\nI didn't seek to be a representative of a whole community of people.\n\nI just hoped to write some good stories.\n\nAnd yet when I was given this mantle of speaking for the Asian-American community, suddenly, there were these expectations.\n\nI started getting a lot of criticism.\n\nSome said I did it wrong, that I had created stereotypes and pandered to those.\n\nMothers speaking in broken English or concubines who had killed themselves -- you know, these were stereotypes.\n\n-The chapter opens with language highly reminiscent of fortune cookie wisdom, Charlie Chan aphorisms, and the kind of Taoist precepts scattered throughout Lin Yutang's \"Chinatown Family.\"\n\n-Tan inscribes Kwan with a linguistic exoticism that could only stem from an outsider's ears.\n\n-Tan's success hinges on her ability to revive Orientalist tropes as if she rejects them.\n\n-Amy Tan opens her \"Joy Luck Club\" with a fake Chinese fairy tale.\n\nThe fairy tale is not Chinese but white racist.\n\n-In the beginning, I didn't know what to say.\n\nI would be caught off-guard.\n\nBut then I realized, what they wanted really was role models.\n\nThey wanted me to right the social wrongs, the social injustices.\n\nAnd finally, they had somebody in the limelight who should now address that and not be pandering, so to speak, to the mainstream.\n\nWhat they were asking me to do was to write propaganda.\n\nWhen you

that kind of pressure.\n\n♪♪ -The moment you start mixing activism and writing, then you're not writing fiction anymore, or not good fiction.\n\nAnd I think that Amy has that very clear.\n\n-The crazy thing about fiction is it is a representation, the deepest representation of truth you can find.\n\nIt's not limited to facts.\n\nIt has really to do with human nature.\n\nAnd so, my mother speaks broken English.\n\nMy grandmother was a concubine who killed themselves.\n\nAnd I said, you have to write what's personally important to you.\n\n♪♪ -Every author has the same need to understand their own lives.\n\nWho are the -- the characters in Amy's work?\n\nHer family, and people who really have gone through hell and somehow have come out of it.\n\nAnd I don't think it's a conscious choice.\n\nIt's the way it is, because w-we are surrounded by those people.\n\nWe belong there.\n\nIn a way, we are one of them.\n\n♪♪ -We have a legacy of trauma and tragedy, suicide, rape, of children left behind in China.\n\nIt's embedded in me.\n\nAnd I don't always know how it is embedded until something comes out and clicks and makes me respond, and not always in a good way.\n\nI have had bouts of depression in the past.\n\nThey had occurred after big changes in my life, what should have been happy periods, including the unanticipated success of my first book, \"The Joy Luck Club.\"\n\nOn the day my book was published, I cried.\n\nThey were not tears of joy for a dream come true.\n\nI was afraid.\n\nI was overwhelmed with a sense that this book would upend the happiness I already had.\n\nEveryone expected too much, and I was certain I would fail.\n\n♪♪ -You're uncomfortable with success.\n\nWe just have a few seconds.\n\nAre you getting used to it now?\n\n-I don't think I'll ever get used to it.\n\nI don't think I should, but it -- it's been wonderf-- a wonderful reception to both books.\n\n-Well, we're certainly very glad that you've been successful.\n\nWe look forward to your next novel.\n\nI don't want to give you an anxiety attack, but hopefully we'll talk then.\n\nAmy Tan, thanks so much.\n\n-Thank you.\n\n-Then Amy Tan wrote a children's book, \"The Moon Lady.\"\n\nThe latest book is another children's book called \"The Chinese Siamese Cat.\"\n\n-\"Just like our ancestor, Sagwa of China.\"\n\nAnd that's the end.\n\n-Wow, that is one of the best stories Elmo has ever heard, Amy.\n\n-As a short story writer, I've never had expectations, and you learn to work without expectations just for the joy of it.\n\nYou know, I think Amy is unusual in that she's had more expectations than any writer I've known.\n\nAnd there was just pressure to keep doing this.\n\n-But my first guest is already one of the world's leading female authors.\n\nShe's written a third book, \"The Hundred Secret Senses.\"\n\n-Family used to always ask me, \"Where's Amy?\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Well, how would I know?\"\n\nAnd then she'll end up on some TV show.\n\n-Miss Tan, I loved \"The Joy Luck Club.\"\n\nIt really showed me how the mother-daughter bond can triumph over adversity.\n\n-No, that's not what I meant at all.\n\nYou couldn't have gotten it more wrong.\n\n-But -- -Please, just sit down.\n\nI'm embarrassed for both of us.\n\n-Her books have sold more than five million copies worldwide, translated into 35 different languages.\n\n-\"The Hundred Secret Senses\" as the character Kwan... -Over the years, with each book, she realized how much time was being taken away from writing.\n\nShe knew that she had to be pretty public and show appreciation to her readers, which she's so great about.\n\nShe will take the time to sign.\n\nShe will take the time to talk.\n\n-Oh, thank you.\n\n-This is for my daughter, Katie.\n\nShe's at -- -Okay.\n\n-When I was young, I really craved privacy, and I think it was, in part, to get away from demands and family chaos, and I would go in my room, and I would draw.\n\nAnd that is something I had with my fiction at one time.\n\nIt was private, and I wrote it for my own reasons, to be in that place.\n\nAnd when you have a lot of expectations, the little, private room is very crowded with editors and agents and fans and detractors, and all of that made it very difficult to write.\n\nI was writing in a -- at a different place.\n\nIt was not as meditative.\n\nIt was full of anxiety.\n\nI felt the burden of expectations a lot.\n\n[ Reporters speaking indistinctly ] [ Birds chirping ] ♪♪ -One of the main achievements of this band over the years has been to reduce the reputation of Amy

-In 1995, my mother had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.\n\nShe was several months shy of her 80th birthday.\n\nThe plaques on her brain had likely started to accumulate years before, but we never would have recognized the signs.\n\nLanguage difficulties, gets into arguments, poor judgment -- Those were traits my mother had shown her entire life.\n\nHow could we distinguish between a chronically difficult personality and a dementing one?\n\n-When her mother was developing Alzheimer's, I'd say the worst part of that time is when the person who is suffering from it knows that things aren't right, but has enough intact mentally for it to really haunt them.\n\n♪♪ -We were eating dinner in a restaurant, and she was obsessing about a family member whom she believed did not respect her.\n\nLou, my brother, and I didn't exactly disagree with her.\n\nThe trouble was, we didn't wholeheartedly agree.\n\nHer anger mounted until she leapt up from the table and ran out of the crowded

with Amy on her books than I have any other writer.\n\nFor Amy, actual writing is not a challenge because she's so fluid and so good at getting down what she knows she needs to get down, and she's got such a good ear for language.\n\nShe hears the language in a way that a poet hears it.\n\nI think the biggest challenge is a psychological one, that is, writing.\n\nNot the writing.\n\nIt's just

actually call this an unintended memoir.\n\nWhen did you realize that's what you were actually doing?\n\n-I was going to write a book about writing.\n\nYou know, how does the mind work?\n\nHow does my writer's mind work?\n\nCreativity, imagination.\n\n-Mm-hmm.\n\n-And it wasn't until I started writing things spontaneously and seeing that they kept reverting to what had happened to me in childhood that it became more of a memoir.\n\nThe past was always present in our lives.\n\nRemember that test I told you about?\n\nThe one that predicted I was going to be a doctor.\n\nIt wasn't until like three years ago that I said, \"What was that test, anyway?\"\n\nThat was so irresponsible, for a woman to give a child one test and then say she was going to be a doctor.\n\nWhy hadn't I questioned it before?\n\nThat couldn't be the case.\n\n-So I typed in, \"1958 Oakland first grade longitudinal IQ.\"\n\nAnd the first thing that came up was a study by a woman named Dolores Durkin.\n\nOut of 5,003 students who enrolled in the first grade that year, 49 of them were found to be able to read.\n\nI was an early reader.\n\n-There I was in my bedroom reading this, and it was 63 years of self-esteem in front of me, and it had been a lie.\n\nIt was based on a lie.\n\nIt had nothing to do with whether I was smart enough to be a doctor and my thinking I never was smart enough.\n\nI continued to read.\n\nAnd she had five interviews in there with parents.\n\nMy father said that I had always been a scribbler and that even before the age of 4, I enjoyed drawing pictures and making up stories about them.\n\n\"Her imagination was amazing,\" my father said.\n\nAnd there I had it.\n\nAfter all those years of being told I was going to be a doctor, to read that my father said I had an amazing imagination made me cry.\n\nAnd that was only recently that I read that, that I saw that.\n\n-I read your second memoir, \"Where The Past Begins,\" and I wondered, was that easier to write than a novel or -- or harder?\n\n-At the end of the -- each day, when I was done writing, my husband, he'd have dinner waiting, 10:00 at night.\n\nI'd go up there.\n\nAnd I would be shaking because of what I had just finished writing.\n\nSo I did that once a week for about four months, and then I had a book.\n\nIt was the fastest book I've ever written.\n\nIt was the most emotionally eviscerating book I've ever w-written.\n\nAnd I think it is the reason why I have a really hard time now writing, because I'm actually rather afraid to have that experience happen to me again.\n\nMy childhood, with its topsy-turvy emotions, has in fact been a reason to write.\n\nI can lay it out squarely on the page and see what it was.\n\nI can understand it and see the patterns.\n\nMy characters are witness to what I went through.\n\nIn each story, we are untangling a knot in a huge, matted mess.\n\nThe work of undoing them, one at a time, is the most gratifying part of writing.\n\nBut the mess will always
