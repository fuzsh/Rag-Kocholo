        "text": "Keyboard 1\n\nAllen Farnham has been active in the New York City jazz scene as a pianist, composer/arranger, producer and teacher since the early 1980's. He has performed and/or recorded with Joe Lovano, Chris Potter, Eddie Henderson, Frank Wess, Tom Harrell, Arthur Blythe, Special EFX, the John Fedchock NY Big Band, and Charlie Byrd. He has also accompanied a wide range of vocalists, including Mel Torme, Ernestine Anderson, Mark Murphy, Liza Minnelli, Susannah McCorkle, Roseanna Vitro, and Helen Merrill.\n\nMr. Farnham is active in the recording industry, having recorded extensively as both a leader and side musician, and has worked as a staff producer and arranger for the west coast based jazz label, Concord Records. He has also served as that company's director of national radio promotion. As a producer, he has produced over 50 albums for such artists as Charlie Byrd, Tito Puente, Mongo Santamaria, Lew Tabackin, Chris Potter, Buddy DeFranco and Jack McDuff. Mr. Farnham's arranging credits include recordings by Eden Atwood, Susannah McCorkle, Veronica Martell, Jesse Davis, and Monty Alexander, as well as his own albums. A 1997 release by Concord Records, \"Allen Farnham Meets The RIAS Big Band,\" features his original compositions and arrangements for the renowned RIAS Big Band of Berlin, Germany.\n\nA 1983 graduate of the Oberlin Music Conservatory, Mr. Farnham has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment For The Arts and the Meet The Composer Foundation. He also holds a Master of Music Degree in Jazz Composition and Arranging from William Paterson University and has been commissioned to write works for the CUG Orchestra (Nagoya, Japan), NPO Glovill (Tokyo), the RIAS Big Band, and the Englewinds Chamber Ensemble. He is presently an adjunct faculty member of the jazz department at New Jersey City University, Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nAllen Farnham\n\nKeyboard 2 / Associate Conductor\n\nAlvin is currently the associate music director of Disney’s The Lion King, as well as the associate music supervisor of the Broadway run of Merrily We Roll Along, featuring Daniel Radcliffe. Other Broadway credits include Tina: The Tina Turner Musical, the recent revivals of Once On This Island and The Color Purple, as well as The Piano Lesson (featuring Samuel L. Jackson), where he provided both music direction and original incidental music. Alvin has also worked on numerous films and TV series, from “Schmigadoon 2” and “Spirited” to “Annie Live!” and the South Park 25th anniversary commercials.\n\n​Alvin started playing piano when he was 5 years old. Classically trained, Alvin has performed at the Kennedy Center, at the Capitol for Mother Teresa’s Congressional Medal of Honor Ceremony, and at the White House for the Clintons while growing up in Washington, D.C. Also, via the DC Boys’ Choir, he has both played and sung in Austrian opera houses and Parisian cathedrals. But when he turned 13, his piano teacher humbly realized her limitations and introduced him to colleagues who could expand his musical horizons. She strong-armed his church into letting him play during Sunday morning services, thereby allowing him to be influenced by gospel music. She also opened Alvin’s eyes to the world of musical theatre as he was introduced to The Who's Tommy in a summer theatre camp.\n\nBelieve it or not, Alvin’s musical training does not extend to conservatory. One of the more important things he likes to pass on is that there is no special formula to end up on Broadway. As proof, even though he's currently not using them, Alvin has a Bachelor’s from Harvard College in Earth and Planetary Sciences and a Master’s in Meteorology from the Georgia Institute of Technology. His passion for music pulled him away from Atlanta and up to New York, where he has now lived since 2009. He sends love to his wife, Rebecca, and their wonderful children, Samuel and Camille.\n\nwww.alvinhoughjr.com\n\nKeyboard 3 / Assistant Conductor\n\nNative New Yorker, Paul began subbing on The Lion King a few months after it opened in 1997, and joined as a regular in 2005.
