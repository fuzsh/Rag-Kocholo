More specifically, Professor Anand is writing a series of papers on the “cultural study of the lawyer” (cultural study understood as a form of philosophical-anthropology). The organizing principle of this project is that law in America is a cultural practice and the national commitment thereto — to living as a community under the rule of law — gives rise to a variety of professional obligations for a lawyer, first and foremost of which is that he or she must serve We the People. This argument directly challenges conventional wisdom, which looks not to the American dedication to self-government, but to moral conscience, the adversarial process, or economic self-interest, among other things, when taking up questions of a lawyer’s ethics.
