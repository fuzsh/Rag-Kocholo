        "text": "(WASHINGTON)—Musicians of the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) perform events across the East D.C. neighborhoods of Kenilworth, Benning Road, Deanwood, Ft. Dupont, Langdon, and East Capitol Hill, as part of the Orchestra’s ninth In Your Neighborhood (IYN), which takes place September 12–16, 2019. These appearances take place during the Kennedy Center’s REACH Opening Festival, offering D.C. and area residents the chance to participate in free live music, art, and cultural events.\n\nThe NSO’s In Your Neighborhood mission is to extend access to live music beyond the Kennedy Center, sharing performances with as many people as possible, engaging new audiences, and inspiring the next generation of musicians and music lovers. Developed in partnership with community-based organizations, venues, schools, and local artists, this year’s IYN showcases programs that celebrate the cultural legacy of Marvin Gaye in Washington D.C., and pay homage to Chuck Brown’s iconic genre of music, Go-Go, also native to Washington D.C.\n\nHighlights of the IYN programming in September are the two full NSO concerts, as well as a pre-concert neighborhood block party. At the first full orchestra concert on Thursday, September 12 at 8:00 p.m. at Echostage, NSO Principal Pops Conductor Steven Reineke leads a program featuring vocalists Mykal Kilgore and Nova Payton, who both make their NSO debuts.\n\nThe NSO hosts a lunchtime neighborhood block party on Saturday, September 14, at noon at the Kenilworth Recreation Center featuring local small business vendors, food trucks, D.C. Public Library’s Go-Go Tech Truck, an Instrument Petting Zoo, performances from the MusicianShip’s All-City Drumline, and more. Following the block party, the 2 p.m. NSO concert is led by conductor Joseph Young in his NSO debut, and features violinist/vocalist Chelsey Green and The Green Project performing family-friendly familiar tunes and original music. Both public concerts are free.\n\nAmong the many venue partners collaborating with the NSO in September are The SEED School of Washington, D.C., WPFW 89.3 Radio, Echostage, Riverside Healthy Living Center – Washington Parks & People, The DC Eagle Bar, City Winery, U.S. National Arboretum, American Job Center – Department of Employment Services, Eastern Senior High School, Ron Brown College Preparatory High School, The Washington National Youth Baseball Academy, and the Kenilworth Recreation Center – Department of Parks & Recreation.\n\nIn Your Neighborhood is a community engagement initiative that provides free NSO concerts, chamber music performances, master classes, and in-school events for one week in a specific D.C. neighborhood. Through this series, the orchestra uses their talent and creativity to support D.C. communities by producing moments for connection, artistic exchange, and inspiration. The National Symphony Orchestra is committed to providing opportunities for all Washington, D.C. residents to participate in the arts, with the belief that music is for everyone, regardless of age, background or zip code.\n\nABOUT STEVEN REINEKE\n\nSteven Reineke’s boundless enthusiasm and exceptional artistry have made him one of the nation’s most sought-after pops conductors, composers, and arrangers. The 2018–2019 season marks his eighth as Principal Pops Conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. In that capacity he has broadened the scope of offerings with the NSO on the Pops series, having led performances of a range of genres and style such as Broadway favorites, jazz, Hip Hop, and film scores. In addition, he has created, shows with the NSO for such notable performers as Kendrick Lamar, Common, Nas, Cynthia Erivo, and Seth MacFarlane.
