        "text": "After the Mayflower\n\nNarrator: Almost nothing is known about the most iconic feast in American history — not even the date. It happened, most likely, in the late summer of 1621 . . . a little less than a year after the Wampanoag saw a small group of strangers land on their shores. Half these strangers — men, women and children — had died of disease, hunger or exposure in their first winter on the unforgiving edge of North America. But by the next summer, with the help of the Wampanoag, the Pilgrims had taken a harvest sure to sustain the settlement through the next barren season. And they meant to celebrate their faith that God had smiled on their endeavor.\n\nElizabeth Hopkins: Fill up the pot my child and fetch some more water.\n\nPilgrim Man: Mind your step.\n\nPilgrim Man #2: More chairs yet?\n\nElizabeth Hopkins: We should have this done in no time.\n\nNarrator: As the \"thanks-giving\" began, a group of Wampanoag men led by their Chief, Massasoit, entered the Plymouth settlement . . . not entirely sure of the reception they'd get.\n\nPilgrim Man: They’re here.\n\nJenny Hale Pulsipher, Historian: Sometimes the Pilgrims are saying uh back off, and sometimes they bring the Wampanoags closer depending on what circumstances are like. But this is a celebration of their survival, of their recognition that they probably wouldn't have survived without the assistance of these Indians. This is a time clearly when they're welcome.\n\nElizabeth Hopkins: The governor cannot mean 'em stay.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit and his men had not appeared empty-handed. They brought five fresh-killed deer — providing some of the vitals for a celebration that stretched over the next three days.\n\nMiles Standish: Musketeers make ready! . . . Musketeers, fire!\n\nCrowd: Huzzah! Huzzah!\n\nNarrator: The Wampanoag and the Pilgrims were an unlikely match . . . but the two peoples were bound by what they shared: an urgent need for allies. The Pilgrims were completely alone in a new world, separated by thousands of miles of ocean from friends and family. The Wampanoag — badly weakened by rolling epidemics — lived in fear of rival tribes. That they found one another in 1621 looked like a boon to each.\n\nNeal Salisbury: The Thanksgiving celebration at Plymouth was certainly an unusual event. It's not something we see thereafter. It symbolizes where the relationship stood as of the fall of 1621.\n\nNanumett: (in Nipmuc) My name is Spotted Crow.\n\nPilgrim Man: Ankantookoche. . . I'm not so good at your tongue I think. I'm glad you are amused anyway . . .\n\nWaban: (in Nipmuc) I am hungry.\n\nPilgrim Man: You like it then. Bellycheer. Try some of this…\n\nPelex: (in Nipmuc) This tastes bad.\n\nNanumett: (in Nipmuc) No, this tastes good. Yes.\n\nNeal Salisbury, Historian: For the English it establishes that they are going to be able to survive because of the Native Americans.\n\nWinslow: It looks to be some sort of gambling game.\n\nNeal Salisbury, Historian: There are strong personal relationships — certainly going on among the leading political figures on each side and, for all we know, among other individuals as well.\n\nWaban: (in Nipmuc) Winslow, play!\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Play! Play!\n\nNarrator: For those who followed the Pilgrims across the Atlantic, the first \"Thanks-giving\" would enter into national mythology, where it remains the bright opening chapter of the American creation story. For the Wampanoag, and for Massasoit, the memory of that day would recede into darker places, shadowed by betrayal and loss.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: It's as if you could take the storybook version of American History — the myth of the first Thanksgiving — and turn it entirely upside down. Here is this story that's sad, that's sinister and finally is about cruelty and power.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: Looking back Massasoit would on one level have felt he was true to himself, but on another level he must have regretted what he'd done. He must have thought — what if we had taken a different course of action in dealing with these people?\n\nAfter The Mayflower\n\nNarrator: They lived in a place of privilege, at the edge of a world, where every new day began. And they called themselves the Wampanoag — the People of the First light.\n\nRae Gould, Nipmuc Anthropologist: Well, think about it. You're here. You are in the east. You see the sun rise. In relation to your world, to what you know, you are the people of the first light. You are the Wampanoag.\n\nNarrator: Behind the Wampanoag, the sun's west-moving light slowly revealed three-thousand miles of human culture — from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: Indian people shaped this continent. They established civilizations here, societies that had risen and in some cases fallen long before Europeans arrived. As you look across the continent at this time, Shawnees in the Ohio Valley are shaping that area, building their own societies; Cherokees in the southeast, Sioux in the western Great Lakes reaching out in the plains, Apaches on the southern plains and in the south west. Everywhere across North America there are communities and tribes and peoples whose histories are ongoing.\n\nNanumett: (in Nipmuc) Use this to fix the hole. Tie it well. Yes. Yes, very good.\n\nNarrator: The confederation of tribes that made up the Wampanoag was one small network section of the native web that spread across North America. The People of the First Light hugged the coast of a vast ocean. To the north were \"The People of the Big Hill,\" the Massachusett. To the west and inland were the NIPMUC, \"the People of the Fresh Water.\" Then the Mohegan and Pequot, and the Narragansett.\n\nRae Gould, Nipmuc Anthropologist: Just think of this one big circle, and everyone speaking different dialects of Algonquian language, but they were mutually intelligible. So, we're all interrelating with each other, married, trading, sharing resources, using resources.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: It was a community of communities and they had inter-meshed and had their own agendas, their own political problems, their own warfare, and their own trade. There was a rich sort of political interaction in this region.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: Sometimes everyone gets along and sometimes they don't. But they resolved the conflicts sometimes through military activity and sometimes through negotiations. We had times when we forgave offenses as part of our traditions — with certain ceremonies were held — like the Green Corn Festival, which was held around the harvest time, for the corn. That was a time when you would forgive all the offenses of your-uh different people that you might not have been on good terms with, and you would invite them to the ceremony and they would come and you'd exchange songs and dances. We continue with that because we believe that everything we had was a gift from the Creator.\n\nNarrator: The half-dozen neighboring tribes had achieved a balance of power. The weaker paying tribute to the stronger. The Wampanoag had sufficient numbers to defend their territory against their nearest rivals, the Narragansett. And the bounty of the land itself eased inter-tribal tensions.\n\nAwashunk: (in Nipmuc) Children! Children! Come!\n\nNarrator: The shallows of the ocean and the bays gave up heaps of shellfish; inland rivers watered the growing fields, where the Wampanoag cultivated corn, beans, squash...The woodlands were filled with game for food and furs to get them through the cold, dark of winter. In 1615, the land sustained tens of thousands of people.\n\nNeal Salisbury, Historian: The explorers who describe these regions all describe the native peoples of New England living in these very populous villages. In fact Champlain, sailing for the French, decided that they didn't want to colonize New England because there were too many people here.\n\nNarrator: For a hundred years alien ships had trolled off the Wampanoag coast...apparitions on the horizon. Odd-looking European explorers and fishermen occasionally came ashore, but they made scant effort to establish relations.\n\nWaban: (in Nipmuc) Some strangers are coming.\n\nPelex: (in Nipmuc) Maybe they will pass by.\n\nWaban: (in Nipmuc) Maybe, but I don't think so.\n\nNarrator: The visitors were known to kill native people, or to capture and carry away men and women, but in the century since Columbus, the Europeans had yet to leave any real footprint on the Wampanoag shores.\n\nNeal Salisbury, Historian: In the years 1617 to 19, an epidemic swept through New England. We don't know exactly what disease this was. And some of the reports of symptoms seem to suggest different diseases. It's possible that one followed rapidly upon the other.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: A normal epidemic hits a few people and then other people get sick but the first people start getting better. In this case everyone gets sick at once.\n\nNeal Salisbury, Historian: A sickness was usually interpreted as an invasion of hostile spiritual powers. And the native people had medicine men, whom they called \"powwows,\" who were experts at countering the spirits of the diseases with which native people had experienced. In this case the powwows were ineffective. Often they were victims themselves.\n\nLisa Brooks, Abenaki Historian: The way that native people refer to it is that the world turned upside down.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: A whole village might have two survivors, and those two survivors were not just like any two people. They were two people who had seen everyone they know die miserable, wretched, painful — excruciatingly painful — deaths.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Great Spirit, please accept these humble offerings.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: So, it's not only that the population was eviscerated, it's that the survivors were deeply affected by their experiences, and vulnerable in ways that are hard for us to imagine, this sort of post-Apocalyptic vulnerability.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit had seen nine of every ten of his people perish of a cause nobody understood: tiny microbes for which the native population had no natural defense — alien diseases left behind by European sailors. As the season of death subsided, the Narragansett — largely spared the ravages of the epidemic — began a series of raids on Wampanoag villages. And the beleaguered Wampanoag looked to Massasoit to lead them into an uncertain future.\n\nEdward Winslow: Miles, I think there's a channel further starboard.\n\nMiles Standish: I spy it.\n\nEdward Winslow: Not much further now lads.\n\nMiles Standish: Haul away. Put your backs into it. Pull! Pull, lads, pull!\n\nNarrator: In December of 1620, after 66 days at sea and five uneasy weeks on the northern tip of Cape Cod, a scraggly cult from England anchored its sailing vessel — the Mayflower — off the mainland coast and sent a small party of men to scout the wooded shores.\n\nMiles Standish: Ship oars.\n\nPilgram Man: Shore the oars.\n\nMiles Standish: Prepare to set sail.\n\nPilgrim Man: Let’s tie it off here.\n\nPilgrim Man #2: Let’s tie it off.\n\nNarrator: Radical religious views had made the Pilgrims unwelcome and unwanted in England; they had no home to go back to if they failed to make one in this new world.\n\nSoon after coming ashore, the scout party stumbled onto the Wampanoag village of Patuxet.\n\nEdward Winslow: Miles. It's a village.\n\nJonathan Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag: Prior to the 1600s, Patuxet was a large community of it's estimated well over 2,000 native people. In 1618, the sickness reduces the population to almost zero.\n\nEdward Winslow: Some kind of jewelry.\n\nJonathan Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag: When the English arrive they find houses fallen to ruin, fields lying fallow, human bones bleaching in the sun that have been scattered by animals.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: They attributed this devastation to God looking out and clearing the way for his chosen people.\n\nEdward Winslow: I think we've found a home.\n\nPilgrim Man: We’ll need more wood. Pile it up over here…\n\nNarrator: Patuxet had easy access to fresh water, a decent harbor, and high ground from which the Pilgrims could defend themselves. They set their lone cannon on a nearby hill and christened the village New Plymouth. The fortifications were hardly sufficient to the task; the Wampanoag, even in their weakened state, could have wiped out the visitors with ease; instead Massasoit sent warriors to keep an eye on the strangers.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: The Pilgrims reported themselves in their journals that they saw Indians. And of course when they didn't see them, they thought they saw them because any time a bush would move they were sure there was an Indian behind it. Our people always had to watch. It was part of our survival. You had to watch anyone, to observe how they were and to see how they were going to act.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: When Indian people see the strangers who have arrived and they've brought with them women and children, that makes them different from previous Europeans that they've seen or heard of.\n\nJessie Little Doe, Mashpee Wampanoag Linguist: In Wampanoag tradition, if you're thinking about making trouble, you don't bring your women and you don't bring your children. So to see folks showing up with women and children, immediately they're not a threat. Secondly, they're really, really sickly...and they're starving.\n\nWilliam Brewster: To you who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flame and fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. We pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfill the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power…\n\nNarrator: The longer the Wampanoag watched, the more pitiful the strangers appeared. One hundred and two Pilgrims had made the trip across the Atlantic. Midway through that winter, fifteen had died of disease or deprivation. By the end of the winter, the Pilgrims had buried forty-five of their fellow travelers. Thirteen of the eighteen women had died. But even as their numbers dwindled, it was clear the strangers were not giving up...and anxiety grew among the Wampanoag. While many powerful tribal leaders — or sachems — argued that it was time to finish off the Pilgrims before their settlement took hold, Massasoit counseled patience. The final decision on handling the strangers would fall to him.\n\nSachem of the Pokanokets — one of the groups that made up the Wampanoag confederacy — he had risen to the leadership of all the Wampanoag, earning his title: Massasoit.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Massasoit is a classic sort of-of village chief or super village chief in the Algonquian world. He is a man of great respect among his people. He doesn't have the coercive power that a European sovereign or a monarch would have. He is a person who leads by example, and people have faith in his leadership and his experience.\n\nNarrator: Throughout that winter, Massasoit wrestled with the question of how to deal with the newcomers. The Chief's first impulse had been to put a curse on the Pilgrims, and watch them die off altogether. But the weakened Wampanoag needed any friends they could get. Massasoit was paying steep tribute to the Narragansett, but he knew his near neighbors had the numbers to overrun the remaining Wampanoag villages whenever they chose. And he was aware that the strangers came from a nation of wealth and military might.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: During the winter of 1620-21, Massasoit must have been thinking about the possibilities of some kind of alliance because the Pilgrims look pretty manageable, given the fact that 50% of them are dead by the end of the first winter. Massasoit — and this is an assumption that was made by Indians all up and down the coast — would have thought, this will be good. I can have these people here. I can get from them the things that I want from Europeans and I can control them. So they'll be an ally and a benefit to me and my people.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Oh Grandfather Sun, I am thankful for this beautiful day. Let me choose wisely my actions for the well being of my People.\n\nAct Two\n\nPilgrim Man: This country ain’t fit for man or beast! That’s ready now.\n\nPilgrim Man #2: We need more water over here.\n\nPilgrim Man: Steady Boys…\n\nNarrator: In the first days of spring, 1621, Massasoit sent a small party into the Pilgrim settlement.\n\nPilgrim Man: Alright, stay back everyone.\n\nEdward Winslow: Please.\n\nNarrator: The Wampanoag chief and sixty of his men waited on the far side of a small river; he refused to enter the village himself until the Pilgrims agreed to give up a hostage.\n\nPilgrim Man: Don’t worry. We’ll be right here.\n\nNarrator: The English chose a young man with little to lose. Edward Winslow was a 25-year-old whose wife was just days from death.\n\nPilgrim Man: You’re all right, Lad.\n\nNarrator: Winslow agreed to go as the hostage...and to deliver Governor John Carver's invitation to Massasoit to enter Plymouth for talks.\n\nEdward Winslow: I come from King James who welcomes you with love and peace. The King sees you, my lord, as his friend and ally. Please enter our village. Mr. Carver — the governor — would like to speak with you. Please we wish to be at peace with you, as our closest neighbors. Please.\n\nNarrator: Among the men with Massasoit that day was a Wampanoag who could act as translator.\n\nSquanto: Nippe. Nippe.\n\nNarrator: Tisquantum, or Squanto, had been kidnapped years earlier and sold into slavery in Europe. When he made his way back home Squanto could speak a little English, and was familiar with European custom.\n\nTisquantum: My king welcomes you here.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) We see that you have great difficulty here.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: This is one of the very first of these treaty encounters that are going to become such an important part of Anglo-American relations with Indian peoples across the continent.\n\nJohn Carver: We want to be at peace with you. We want you to promise none of your people will harm any of our people.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Tell him we mean no harm.\n\nJohn Carver: Let us agree then that if any one unjustly attack you, that we will help you, and if any unjustly attack us, then you will help us.\n\nNarrator: There was cause for joy on both sides: the Pilgrims had friends to help them navigate the unfamiliar hardships of their new home; the Wampanoag had made themselves the first and favored ally of the new English colony.\n\nJenny Hale Pulsipher, Historian: There's a very clear sense that Massasoit understands the entire treaty as reciprocal. At the very end of the treaty it says if you do these things then King James will esteem you his friend and ally. So it would make very good sense for the Indians to think this is an alliance, this is a meeting between friends. As soon as the treaty is concluded, that very day, Massasoit says, \"Tomorrow I'll bring my people and we'll plant corn on the other side of the stream.\" So this sense that we're the same people now. We're going to be sharing everything.\n\nNarrator: Over the coming months, the two peoples made halting moves toward codifying their alliance. As a show of friendship, Massasoit formally ceded the settlers the village of Patuxet, and all the planting land and hunting grounds around it. In July Edward Winslow made a forty-mile journey to Massasoit's village, Pokanoket, and presented the chief a gift of a copper chain. The Wampanoag agreed to trade with the English alone, and not the French. Massasoit would benefit as the facilitator of trade between the English and other tribes. A few weeks after Winslow's visit, the Pilgrims invited the Wampanoag to take part in their first American thanks-giving. But what sealed the relationship was a simple show of personal respect.\n\nIn February of 1623, when a messenger arrived at Plymouth with the news that Massasoit was desperately ill, Winslow — like many Algonquian — rushed to his side.\n\nVoices: (in Nipmuc) Heal him!\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: Winslow makes the point that this is what Indians do. When a friend is sick everyone congregates at the friend's bedside. This is one of those places where Winslow is acting as he knows Indians expect people to act.\n\nEdward Winslow: Massasoit…\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Is that you Winslow?\n\nEdward Winslow: (in Nipmuc) Yes, Massasoit.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Until we meet again my friend.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: Edward Winslow is a very interesting man. He was the second in command in Plymouth and he's the one who takes it upon himself to become the principle emissary to Massasoit.\n\nEdward Winslow: (in Nipmuc) Eat, Massasoit.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: Some Indians had a dual chieftain system. That is they had a overall chief who is called the \"inside chief,\" who is responsible for the community and basically stays within the community. And then there's an \"outside chief\" who is responsible for essentially foreign relations and war. Winslow is acting as the outside chief.\n\nEdward Winslow: Please, heavenly Father, watch over your child Massasoit...\n\nNarrator: Winslow's medicine was of no particular benefit to Massasoit, but the chief did recover and Winslow was there — representing the entire Plymouth Colony — when Massasoit was able to rise again.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) I will never forget your kindness.\n\nNarrator: In spite of a growing trust between Edward Winslow and Massasoit, the relationship between the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag remained tentative. The Pilgrims were separatists...devout Christians who had fled the Old World for fear its corruptions would darken the Godly light in which they dwelled. Corrupting influences lurked...everywhere.\n\nAwashunk: (in Nipmuc) See. This is what they should look like.\n\nElizabeth Hopkins: She cannot mean to eat this.\n\nNarrator: Even Winslow, who found the Wampanoag and other tribes \"trustworthy,\" \"quick of apprehension,\" and \"just\", fretted about close contact with Indians.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: You see at the beginning of the 17th century, this kind of cautious getting to know one another. As those peoples become more and more dependent on one another, and exchange more and more goods, and ideas, and people — children, wives, families — have more and more contact with one another. In a sense, the two peoples come to share a great deal. They come, the English come to be more like Indians in many ways. They dress more like Indians. They use Indian words. They're familiar with Indian ways. And the Indians come to be more like English. A lot of Indians speak English. They wear English clothes. They build houses that are English. There's a reciprocity of exchange that actually turns out — we might think, 'oh how lovely. What a nice multicultural fest that is.’ But actually it makes everyone very, very nervous.\n\nNarrator: The Pilgrims were especially wary; they were badly outnumbered and many Indians, they believed, bore the English \"an inveterate malice.\" They also knew Massasoit hadn't the power to shield them from every danger.\n\nSo in the spring of 1623, after hearing rumors of a planned attack by Massachusett Indians to the North, the Pilgrims — under their militia leader Miles Standish — made a deadly pre-emptive raid...and returned to Plymouth with an object lesson to those who would cross them.\n\nMiles Standish: Gentlemen, here is a proper trophy.\n\nPilgrim Rowers: HUZZAHS!\n\nNarrator: \"This sudden and unexpected execution has so terrified the Indians,\" Edward Winslow wrote, \"that many have fled their homes. Living like this, on the run, many have fallen sick, and died.\"\n\nShocking and brutal as the raid was, Massasoit counseled his sachems to keep up relations with Plymouth. The Wampanoag were still the favored friends of the English. And the English were surely no threat to their friends.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: Massasoit is able to keep this peace for a long time, which suggests that it's not simply his personality and his command that's doing that. The nature of native society means that he is representing what the majority of his people want to do.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: The Indians wanted certain things from the Europeans: knives, axes, swords and steel drills.\n\nJean O’Brien, Ojibwe Historian: Europeans bring things like metal kettles that are very useful for Indian people and Indian people incorporate those goods into their own cultures on their own terms and in their own ways.\n\nLisa Brooks, Abenaki Historian: For native people, trade is about binding people together in relationships of reciprocity. So that was the question. How do we bring the English into these relationships of reciprocity?\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: We lived right near the shoreline, and we harvested the quahogs, which you make quahog chowder from and all the other good things. And then after you eat the contents, then you saved the shell. We wasted nothing that the Creator gave 'cause everything was a gift, and from the shell from the quahog, the purple spire is what we made the wampum beads from.\n\nAll the tribes respected the wampum — and the value that wampum had was spiritual, more so than material. We used it in ceremony, it sealed agreements, it was what notarized a transaction. When wampum was exchanged, no one would break the agreement that went along with the wampum — be it a marriage agreement or a treaty or whatever, because it was so sacred, and you don't go against the creator.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Initially the Europeans then will say, \"Well, this must be like silver or gold. This is something that Indian people will use and trade back and forth.\" So they accepted it initially as well and wampum is seen as Native American currency by the English.\n\nNarrator: European traders — long familiar with a money economy — set in motion a system for exchanging hard goods for wampum, making the Indian's traditional ceremonial amulet the coin of the American realm. Trade flourished under this ingenious new system. English merchants eagerly awaited Indian furs from the New World; the beaver hat was the fashionable new accessory on the streets of London. And the arrival at Plymouth of product-laden ships from England was happy news to all. With the import of steel drills, native tribes could greatly speed the manufacture of wampum.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: It's much easier to create a wampum shell, to drill that hole through the center with a steel drill than with a stone drill, and so suddenly there's a large supply of wampum. And what this means is that tribes in the interior who previously had very little access to wampum now are able to get it and they're also groups that have furs and other things to trade to the Europeans.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: Plymouth colonists rely on Massasoit to begin brokering connections with other Native groups. So Massasoit becomes this very important node in these regional exchanges among furs and European goods and wampum all of which are being exchanged many times in different groups depending on who has what.\n\nNarrator: With the Pilgrims integrated into the web of his alliances, Massasoit's gamble — welcoming the strangers — seemed to have paid handsome dividends.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: I think he would have looked back over the previous decade and thought that he had done some pretty good work. It must have seemed possible to Wampanoags and to other Native groups and southern New England to envision a future in which English and Native communities could live profitably together.\n\nNarrator: In the spring of 1630, a fleet of ships led by the Arabella appeared off the coast to the north of Plymouth — carrying a thousand new immigrants. While the Pilgrims had been escaping Europe, these Puritans meant to re-create a new and more pious England in America. They had embarked from England with a grant from their King to establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony...and with a boundless sense of mission.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: In Europe at this time, and particularly among the Christian kingdoms of Europe, there was this belief in the right to go out and usurp land that was not occupied by Christian people. And this was a religious basis for this, as well as political, in that this was a God-ordained practice in which one would be spreading Christianity and would be spreading European civilization, and there was a moral obligation to do so.\n\nNarrator: On board the Arabella, days before it landed, the future Governor of the new Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop, essayed the epic vision: \"The Lord shall make us a praise and glory, for we must consider that we shall be as a City upon a Hill, the eyes of all people are upon us.\" The Puritans washed into Massachusetts Bay by the thousands in the next five years, establishing town after town...their path cleared by new waves of small pox hitting tribes in New England.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: One of the historians of the Puritans — I'm quite sure it was one of the clergymen — said, in reference to the death of so many of the Massachusetts people, that the land was almost cleared of 'those pernicious creatures so as to make way for a better growth.' Now he's talking about women, children, all of that, but that's the way they related because their unfounded notion of European superiority.\n\nThey kept coming, one boatload after another.\n\nLisa Brooks, Abenaki Historian: You have all of these people who are coming over from England with that sense of entitlement. They have this image of the colonies as if there's just great space for them to occupy and there are great resources that are for the taking.\n\nNarrator: In less than a generation, Massasoit saw the English population surrounding the Wampanoag rise from 300 to 20,000.\n\nAwashunk: (in Nipmuc) English beasts! Go away!\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: The animals that the English bring with them are incredibly devastating because they let them run loose. The pigs in particular had apparently no natural enemies here. They would talk about, you know, enumerable numbers of pigs just vacuuming up the acorns and the other things on which Native people relied for food and on which these animals that the Native people were accustomed to hunt relied for food.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: The population of the English colonies was growing dramatically, with an increasing demand to establish new towns, create farms and expand. The one thing that Native People have that the English people want is their land.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: Access to an acquisition of this so-called \"free land\" that the Americas offer is a source of constant and recurrent conflict with Indian people. The English came from a society where land was in short supply. Ownership of land was a mark of status as well as a source of wealth. For Indian people, land is homeland. You are rooted to it by generations of living on the land, your identity is tied up in it. It's not a commodity to be bought and sold.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit had not felt pressured to sell land for the first twenty years of Plymouth's existence and his first commitments to cede territory had seemed harmless. But just as the English became more aggressively acquisitive, Massasoit found himself in a weak bargaining position.\n\nThe beaver population was badly depleted, collapsing the trade on which his relationship with the Pilgrims had been built. And the English no longer needed Massasoit's help in expanding their commercial reach. So he was forced to bend to his allies' desire to have his land.\n\nThe chief got what he could for the Wampanoag land. He sold one parcel for ten fathom of beads and a coat. As time went on he asked for more: hatchets, hoes, knives, iron kettles, moose skins, matchlock muskets, yards of cotton and pounds of English coin.\n\nJenny Hale Pulsipher, Historian: There are several incidents where Massasoit's clearly disgruntled with the way things are changing. For instance he agrees to sell some of his land to some of the settlers down in Rhode Island. And they pay him for it and he says, \"This is this is nowhere near enough.\" And he gives it back. And they refuse to take it. They refuse to take the gifts, the payment back. And they say, you know, \"You can't return this and this is a done deal. This, this land is now ours.\"\n\nNarrator: The English were in a race to establish empire in the Americas...jockeying for territory with the French, the Spanish, the Swedish, the Dutch.\n\nKaren Kupperman, Historian: They're very expansive and they don't expand incrementally. They're aware that the Connecticut River is a major conduit of trade. The Dutch are already on the lower end of the river and so clearly they want to control the Connecticut River from its midsection.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: With the influx of English people in the 1630s Puritan New England ceases to be weak and vulnerable and now becomes a power in the region. As they look further west, they see another major power. The English identify the Pequot as an obstacle to their expansion.\n\nNarrator: In the spring of 1637, Massasoit received word that a force led by Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies had destroyed the Pequot — the most powerful Indian confederacy in the area. In the final battle, English soldiers — to the horror of their Indian allies — had burned an undefended village, killing hundreds.\n\nJean O’Brien, Ojibwe Historian: The Pequot war established in Indian minds the potential savagery of the English. The idea of 700 people — men, women, and children — perishing in the burning of a fort was incomprehensible to Indians. It was a cautionary tale that Massasoit did not forget.\n\nMassasoit: (in Nipmuc) Keep them dry.\n\nPelex: (in Nipmuc) Hand me more.\n\nNarrator: Soon after the destruction of the Pequot, Massasoit traveled to Massachusetts Bay Colony to deliver to its governor, John Winthrop, a gift of sixteen beaver skins, and to re-state his long-standing friendship with the colonists...all in hopes they would continue to honor the promise of shared security the English had made in that first long-ago treaty.\n\nJenny Hale Pulsipher, Historian: Massasoit hopes that this tribute is going to solidify his friendship with Massachusetts because he's worried and he's not the only one. Winthrop writes in his journal that after the Pequot war dozens of Indian groups in the area come to Massachusetts to the court and try to make friends. Say you know, we, we want to be your, your friends, your partners, your subjects, whatever it takes. They're, they're frightened.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit's eventual heir — his second son — was born around the time of the Pequot War, and nearly twenty years after the arrival of the Pilgrims. He knew no world but the one in which English and Wampanoag lived together. Even his names would suggest a man comfortable in two cultures.\n\nNarrator: He was first called Metacom, and later Philip. He came of age in the 1650s...in a world his forefathers could not have imagined. He fancied fine English lacework, and richly detailed wampum. He was one of the few Wampanoag who kept pigs. And he counted among his close friends both Indians and Englishmen.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: He was described by an English traveler as walking through the streets of Boston decked out in massive amounts of wampum showing his wealth and his power, comfortable walking in this world that had been created together by the English and the Native People of the region.\n\nNarrator: As he approached manhood Philip was more and more aware of his father's growing unease. Massasoit's tribal borders had receded in around Narragansett Bay. Disease continued to thin the Wampanoag. His trusted ally, Edward Winslow, had died. The new leadership in Plymouth had little memory of the time they had needed Massasoit's help.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: When do the English lose their sense of openness? Well when they become more independent. When they realize that they no longer need the Indians. And right around that same time, in the 1650s, they make one attempt to convert the Indians to Christianity. Which is to say, in effect, \"Well if you're gonna live among us, you need to basically become us, because we can't live with people who are different from ourselves.\"\n\nNarrator: In 1651, Puritan minister John Eliot established a \"praying town\" in Natick, Massachusetts. In Natick, as in the dozen praying towns that followed, Indians who converted to Christianity were assured physical security and the promise of eternal life...so long as they agreed to live by moral codes drawn up by Puritan clergy.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: The praying Indian towns were set up by the English to basically control Indians. You had all these rules that were alien in concept, and native people had to do everything in the English way; and everything Indian, of course, all the traditions that were sacred to your fathers and your father's father since time immemorial, you had to reject all of that in favor of following the English way. So you had to look down on your own people, essentially is what it boiled down to.\n\nJessie Little Doe, Mashpee Wampanoag Linguist: Wampanoag people here got the idea that somehow if we are to survive at all, we've got to at least say that we're assimilated; we've got to say that we're Christian. Whatever that means, or we're going to be wiped out completely.\n\nJean O’Brien, Ojibwe Historian: In order to be accepted as a full member of the church you needed relate a conversion experience that was witnessed by the congregation and that was deemed sufficient that you've been saved. That you believe yourself to be saved. We have this remarkable set of documents that were published at the time called “Tears of Repentance,” that were Indians from Natick relating their conversion experiences, and they were witnessed by a panel of ministers.\n\nPraying Indian #1: I heard that Word, that it is a shame for a man to wear long hair, and that there was no such custom in the Churches; at first I thought I loved not long hair, but I did, and found it very hard to cut it off; and then I prayed to God to pardon that sin also\n\nPraying Indian #2: When they said the devil was my God, I was angry, because I was proud...I loved to pray to many Gods.. Then going to your house, I more desired to hear of God...then I was angry with myself and loathed myself and thought God will not forgive my sins.\n\nPraying Indian #3: I see God is still angry with me for all my sins and He hath afflicted me by the death of three of my children, and I fear God is still angry, because great are my sins, and I fear lest my children be not gone to Heaven.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: The English missionaries demanded from Indian people much more than an expressed belief in their God. It was part of an English cultural assault, which Massasoit must have seen was tearing apart many native communities, and I think that's why he wants to try and curb the missionaries, try and stop this kind of assault taking place.\n\nNarrator: As Massasoit's days drew down, he made a point of stipulating in land deeds that Christian missionaries stay out of what remained of Wampanoag territory.\n\nHaving watched the English erode his tribe's landholdings and his father's authority, Philip determined to make a marriage of power. He wed a woman who was a leader in her own right . . . the daughter of a chief who had opposed Massasoit's alliance with the English from the beginning.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: Massasoit must have wondered what kind of world he was handing on to his sons, to his children. I think there's a certain resignation in some of his actions toward the end of his life — an attempt to stem the tide of English assault on Indian land, on Indian culture, on Indian sovereignty, and a lingering hope that maybe things will still work out okay. Maybe there can still be peace, because I think that was his vision of what New England would be, was a vision of peace.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit died in the early 1660s, forty years after his first alliance with the Pilgrims. His passing came just as a new hard-edged generation of English leaders was rising to power. Men like Josiah Winslow, Edward's son, who was intent on hastening the final reckoning between the Wampanoag and the English. Philip — just 24 years old — took his father's place as the Wampanoag chief.\n\nJonathan Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag: And suddenly it's all on him. He was leading in a very difficult and very dangerous time, where essentially every part of our society, was being stripped away.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: The wampum trade was declining. The fur trade was declining. The demand for the English to acquire more and more Algonquian land was increasing. More and more Native People, for whatever reason, were choosing to move to praying towns. The world that had created Philip was collapsing around him.\n\nNarrator: Philip hoped to strike a delicate balance: maintaining his alliances among the English while also maintaining what remained of Wampanoag sovereignty. He continued to abide by the terms of his father's treaty. But like his father, he rejected repeated efforts by Puritan missionaries to convert him. \"If I became a praying sachem, I shall be a poor and weak one,\" he said, \"and easily trod upon by others.\" He also declared a moratorium on land sales. English authorities had little interest in humoring the young Wampanoag chief.\n\nJean O’Brien, Ojibwe Historian: There were a variety of ways that English claimed possessions of Indian lands: everything from just seizing them and then attending to the legalities much later, merely occupying lands that they want to declare vacant and thus, available for the taking. One that is often overlooked is that the English would get Indians indebted. As Indians continued to experience ill health and epidemic disease, one of the things that they become indebted for is health-care that’s being provided by English guardians. These English guardians used this as a way to get their hands on Indian land. So that once the debts have been accumulated they go to the Indian estate for the land for payment. And this becomes a massive mechanism of Indian dispossession.\n\nJessie Little Doe, Mashpee Wampanoag Linguist: What people felt for millennia,'This is my land, and my land is me, and I am it,' obviously because we come from it, and we eat from it…and things die, they go into the land, and we eat from what grows from there. So when we say land it's just \"ahh-key\" — land. But if you say 'my land,' you have to say \"na-tahh-keem\". This means that 'I am physically the land, and the land is physically me.' And after Europeans were here for about seventy years, people started, you started to write “na-tahh-key”, which is so sad, because that means I am not necessarily part of the land anymore. 'It can…my land can be separated from my person.'\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: There is a continual erosion of tribal people's ability to maintain control over their own lives. And I think by the 1660s, Philip finds himself up against the wall. In other words, unless one makes a stand, the-the Wampanoag or the tribal people are going to be completely overrun.\n\nNarrator: In 1671, rumors spread that Philip was growing angry...and preparing to act. Authorities in Plymouth — Josiah Winslow chief among them — summoned Philip to account for himself.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: Josiah Winslow has no curiosity whatsoever about these people with whom he's grown up. He's known them all his life. He considers them an obstacle. He considers them untrustworthy. He wants nothing more than to find a means of provoking a war that could lead to their extermination.\n\nJosiah Winslow: You have, have you not, in recent times, procured a great and unusual supply of both ammunition and provisions, planning an attack on us both here in Taunton and in other places.\n\nPhilip: These charges against me are false.\n\nJosiah Winslow: If you have no such designs, have your men hand over their weapons.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: He had two choices. Either give all the weapons up or acknowledge to the English that he was preparing for war, as they were accusing him of. So he had to choose the lesser of the two evils.\n\nPhilip: (in Nipmuc) We have no choice at this time. Give up your guns.\n\nTavoser: (in Nipmuc) No, we have done no wrong.\n\nNarrator: Before taking his leave, Philip was made to sign a confession in which he admitted disloyalty to the English, and promised to turn over any weapons the Wampanoag had amassed.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: This is a real turning point for Philip in that it's quite clear that the aims of the English are not just to gain more and more land, not just to undercut native people economically and spiritually, but clearly to make native people their subjects.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: They no longer are being treated as equals; they're no longer being treated as allies; they're being treated essentially as second-class citizens in their own country.\n\nNarrator: Philip was not eager to make a fight with the English; a war would shred his father's historic alliance. And put his entire tribe in peril. There were only a thousand Wampanoag remaining, and nearly half were living in the Praying Towns. Philip had few warriors. But the Wampanoag chief did prepare — seeking allies among nearby tribes, and quietly buying up firearms. At home in Mount Hope, with his English friends nearby, Philip wrestled with the enormity of a war against Josiah Winslow and Plymouth colony.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: He was clearly a person caught in historical forces that gave him very difficult choices, and like many Indian leaders in those situations across the continent, he must have been weighing the options of peace and war, he must have been trying to balance conflicting pressures.\n\nNarrator: Betrayal forced Philip's hand. In January 1675, Philip's personal secretary traveled to Plymouth to warn Governor Winslow that Philip was arming for war. Three weeks later, the secretary was dead. English authorities arrested three of Philip's men, tried them for the murder, and executed them.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: For Indian people, of course, a killing of an Indian by an Indian in Indian country was something that should have been settled by Indian people. After that blatant assault of Indian sovereignty, Philip must have been under incredible pressure from his warriors to step up and do something about this.\n\nNarrator: As whispers of a coming war spread among the English colonists that following summer, the deputy governor of Rhode Island invited Philip to a meeting to offer some friendly advice.\n\nEaston: KOONEPEAM, Philip. We thank you for coming over to speak with us. Our business is to try to prevent you from doing wrong.\n\nTavoser: (in Nipmuc) We have done no wrong.\n\nNookau: (in Nipmuc) We have been first to do good to the English. They have never been good to us.\n\nPhilip: We have done no wrong.\n\nEaston: If you start a war against the English, much blood will be spilt. A war will bring in all Englishmen for we're all under one king. I urge you to lay down your arms Philip because the English are too strong for you.\n\nPhilip: Then the English should treat us as we treated the English when we were too strong for the English.\n\nNarrator: Philip's angry young warriors refused to heed Easton's warning that war with Plymouth would bring every colony in New England down on their heads. Days after the conference with Easton, Philip sent warning from Mount Hope to an old English friend in nearby Swansea: it might be best to leave the area. When Wampanoag warriors began their rampage, Philip stood with them, convincing other aggrieved tribes in the area — including the Wampanoag's old rival, the Narragansett — to join their fight against New England: a fight the English would come to call King Philip's War.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: This war that breaks out in New England is a major war. It has a big impact on the societies in New England, both Native American and white. By the winter of 1676 or so, to get outside of Boston for Europeans was a very dangerous prospect.\n\nDaniel K. Richter, Historian: Native American forces had devastating victories over the English in the early months of that war, destroyed large numbers of towns and people and property, and were very much winning that war and putting the English on a defensive.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: The war spread to Connecticut. The war spread into Rhode Island. The war spread into eastern New York. Tribe after tribe after tribe became involved in this.\n\nNarrator: English colonists from the outlying villages fled to bigger towns; some simply boarded ships and headed back to Europe. Alarmists among the English feared they would all be driven into the sea.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: The English look now very differently at Indian people, even those Indian people who have lived among them, even those Indian people who have committed to living a Christian life and are living in the praying towns. These Indians now come to be regarded as, at the very least, a potential fifth column — as people who cannot be trusted, as people who are liable to turn on you at any time.\n\nNarrator: As winter approached, the colonists banished hundreds of Christian Indians living in praying towns...men, women and children.\n\nTall Oak, Absentee Mashantucket Pequot, Wampanoag: They took them on a forced march to the Charles River, put them in canoes, and put them on Deer Island in the middle of Boston Harbor, which at that time of year is a cold, blustery place. Over three or four hundred perished from lack of food and exposure, because they gave them no blankets or food, or anything, and just dumped them there.\n\nNarrator: The war ground on — month after month — exacting a terrible price. Twenty-five English towns were destroyed; more than two thousand English colonists died. But the shared danger did unite the colonies...and they lashed back. In early 1676 Philip could feel the tide turning; and then the powerful Mohawks — longtime allies of the English — made a surprise attack, killing almost 500 of Philip's men and dooming his confederacy. A year into the war, scores of Indian villages had been burned to ash. Five thousand native people had died; hundreds of men, women and children who did survive — \"heathen malefactors\" Josiah Winslow called them — were loaded onto boats, shipped to the West Indies and Europe, and sold into slavery. Native tribes in southern New England had been crushed, and would never again control their destiny in their homeland.\n\nNarrator: In the summer of 1676, Philip retreated home to Mount Hope with his wife and children; his cause all but lost.\n\nPhilip: (in Nipmuc) O Grandfather Sun, I am thankful for this beautiful day. Let me choose my actions wisely for the well being of my People.\n\nJenny Hale Pulsipher, Historian: It does seem a little unusual that he would come back to Mount Hope, because there are so many troops around there looking for him. It's like consciously walking into a trap.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: When he returns to Mount Hope, he certainly has given up, he's going there to die. Rather than a grand, heroic military figure, he's a more poignant, sad figure, a person filled with sorrow at the end of his life.\n\nNarrator: On August 12, 1676, an English militia unit — along with a Praying Indian named John Alderman — surprised Philip and his dwindling band of followers.\n\nJonathan Perry, Aquinnah Wampanoag: After Philip was shot by Alderman, they dismembered his body. The scarred right hand of Philip was given to Alderman as a trophy of the war. His parts were strewn about the colonies, spread to the four corners.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: This is a warning to other people, to other Indian people. This is what the English will…this is how the Enlish will deal with rebellion, deal with treason. And remember that in English eyes Philip was a traitor — and this was the punishment meted out by 17th century Englishman to traitors.\n\nNarrator: Massasoit's son was dead and scattered, but the colonists were taking no chances; they captured Philip's son and heir — a nine-year-old boy — and locked him in a jail in Plymouth. While English authorities deliberated on whether to sell the boy into slavery, or simply murder him, the Puritans gave thanks to their God.\n\nJill Lepore, Historian: And the final day of thanksgiving, of the war, is the day Philip's head is marched into Plymouth. This decapitated head on a pole, its erected in the center, in the center of town and is cause for a great celebration.\n\nNarrator: They wouldn't take it down, Philip's head. For two decades — while Philip's son lived in slavery in the West Indies — the head was displayed in Plymouth, a reminder to the Indians about who was in charge; a reminder to the English that God continued to smile on their endeavor.\n\nColin G. Calloway, Historian: It's hard to see how conflict could have been avoided and how the outcome of that war could have been different. Looking at the generation before this war, there is at least a moment, where things were different.\n\nTecumseh\n\nNarrator: No pictures were ever made of him during his lifetime. No account in his own words was left behind. Looking back the movement he led would seem to some to have been doomed to failure from the start. And yet in the course of his breathtakingly brief and meteoric career, he would rise to become one of the greatest Native American leaders of all time — and one of the most gifted, far-sighted, revered and inspiring — forging, from the glowing embers of his younger brother’s soaring vision, an extraordinary coalition — and orchestrating the most ambitious pan-Indian resistance movement ever mounted on the North American continent — determined to defend the Native American homelands and ways of life.\n\nKevin Williams, Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma: I mean, to be Shawnee, and to have Tecumseh be a member of that tribe is to be honored — to be honored to be in that tribe. He and his brother were trying to get the Shawnee people back to their roots and try to keep their lands from being taken. And he was a visionary. And I think today — what would have happened if he had succeeded in his plan? It would have changed history.\n\nAndrew Warrior, Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma: He had a vision to make sure that the Indian way of life was going to continue...at whatever cost. This is a man — an Indian man, a self-proclaimed leader, a self-proclaimed chief — who stood up and said, “Hey, this is enough. I don’t want no more of this. You’ve taken enough.” And he took a stand.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: One way one might think of Tecumseh is as a man who led a revolution of young men — young men who were tired of the accommodationist stance of their elders — young men who thought that the leadership structure of the Shawnee tribe needed to be reordered and reimagined, in order for the Shawnees and all native people to survive.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: What Tecumseh is fighting for is the ability of Indian people east of the Mississippi to hold onto their homelands. Their lands are under siege in the period after the American Revolution. The white frontier is moving into the Ohio Valley — it’s also moving onto the Gulf Plains in the South. And Tecumseh says, “This has got to stop. We have to stand and all realize that we’re in this together.” I think Tecumseh’s one of those people that, if he were alive today and would walk into a room, people would stop talking and just stare at him. Tribal people back in the first part of the 19th century would say, “Tecumseh is a man of very, very strong medicine.” There was this aura around him of leadership and respect, that even people who opposed him — even his enemies — admired him. His genius was in inspiring people. And he was a very inspirational man that was able to bring out the very best in those people who supported him. And to see beyond any particular tribal affiliation, and to realize that this was a struggle that was of greater magnitude. I also think that there was a spiritual component to this — that he believed that he was appointed by the powers in the universe...to really bring people together, and to make this stand. And to retain what was left of the Indian homeland. This was his life. This was what he had been born to do.\n\nTecumseh: These lands are ours. No one has a right to remove us. The Master of Life knows no boundaries, nor will his red people acknowledge any. The Master of Life has appointed this place for us to light our fires, and here we shall remain.\n\nGeorge Blanchard, Absentee Shawnee Tribe of Oklahoma: Well, I’ve always heard “Teh-cum-theh” — “Teh-cum-theh” — means, in our culture and our belief, at nights when we see a falling star, it means that this panther is jumping from one mountain to another. And as kids, when we saw these falling stars, we’d kind of hesitate about being out in the dark, because we thought there were actually panthers out there walking around...So that's what his name meant: Teh-cum-theh.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Ohio was a very special place for the Shawnees. The Shawnees called Ohio, and the Ohio Valley, the “center of the world.” It was an area where Shawnee villages dotted the river valleys. It was an area where one could come down from Ohio, cross the Ohio River and hunt into the bluegrass region of Kentucky — where at this time there were small herds of buffalo, there were elk, there were deer there. So it was a very special place, and it was a place which was very dear to Shawnee hearts. The word Shawnee means “Southerner,” and they were called “southerners” by other Algonquin-speaking people. Shawnees had lived in the Ohio Valley off and on for a great period of time. They had scattered in the early 1700s — but they’d come back into Ohio, and they hunted extensively into Kentucky.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: Tecumseh was born around 1768. That’s the same year that a huge treaty at Fort Stanwix in New York essentially opens up what is now Kentucky to English settlement. Much of that territory is Shawnee hunting territory. So right at the time of Tecumseh’s birth, it’s clear that issues of land — and English or American access to this land — are going to be vital factors in shaping his life.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Tecumseh and his younger brother grew up in the midst of the American Revolution. And it was an exciting time, I’m sure, for a young Shawnee man to come to manhood — but it was also a time of danger, and a time of a certain amount of turmoil. It was a time when Shawnee warriors went south across the river to strike at the frontier forts in Kentucky, and it was a time when the Shawnee villages north of the Ohio were attacked periodically by expeditions of Kentuckians into the region.\n\nNarrator: Named for the Kispokothe war clan into which he was born — whose spiritual patron was a celestial panther leaping across the heavens — he showed promise from the start — quick to learn, graceful and athletic, and touched with a striking natural charisma. “There was a certain something in his countenance and manner,” a childhood friend recalled, “that always commanded respect, and made those about him love him.” The contrasts could not have been more striking with his troubled younger brother, Lalawethika.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Lalawethika was seven years younger than Tecumseh and grew up in his brother’s shadow. He was very unsuccessful as a little child. His nickname was Lalawethika — which means the “noise maker,” I think translated idiomatically it probably meant “loudmouth,” a person that makes a lot of noise. As a child of about ten or twelve years old he shoots his own eye out while fooling around with a bow and arrow...and just is not a very happy young child.\n\nNarrator: In the end, no Shawnee family would be left untouched by the rising tide of violence in the Ohio River Valley.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: Tecumseh and Lalawethika lost their father when Tecumseh was seven. Their mother left for Missouri in 1779 after horrifying warfare between the Long Knives and the Shawnees. So that by the time Lalawethika was thirteen, roughly half of their immediate family members had either been killed or had voluntarily removed from Ohio.\n\nNarrator: For the Shawnees as a whole, the outcome of the American Revolution would prove even more cataclysmic. All through the war they had fought valiantly on the British side in defense of their homelands, without losing a battle — only to discover — following the British surrender — that their one time allies had ceded all lands west of the Appalachians to the new American republic.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: At the Peace of Paris in 1783, no Indians are there. The terms of the treaty do not even mention Indian people — and, yet, this is a treaty that has huge...significance for Indians. Britain...transfers to the new United States all territory that it has claimed south of the Great Lakes — east of the Mississippi — north of Florida. That is Indian country. For the United States, it’s a crucial resource. Land is the basis of the new nation, land is the opportunity to create what Jefferson comes to call an “empire of liberty.” But you have to get that land from Indian people. And within a few years, Indian people begin to recoil from that, and to recognize the degree to which the United States represents a major threat to their existence. Indian nations begin to unite in a confederation, to resist that expansion.\n\nNarrator: In the alliance of tribes that now rose up to stop the white invasion, the Shawnees would take the lead, and Tecumseh himself first make a name for himself on the field of battle — in what would prove to be the beginning of an epic thirty-year long struggle, that would permanently shape the physical and moral geography of the new nation.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: The area they called the Old Northwest — the area north of the Ohio River — was sort of up for grabs in the period after the American Revolution. The British still had forts at Detroit, and they still had a lot of influence among the tribes because they were operating out of Canada. [And] the British are not even sure whether the new United States is going to stand. And they feel that if the United States goes under, they want to be able to move back into this region in force. And so the British keep telling the Indians, “Oh, well, you should stand up against the United States, and we will supply you with guns and ammunition...”\n\nNarrator: For six long years, the Shawnees and their allies kept U.S. forces on the run — all but destroying the American army in 1792 — only to be stopped two years later at the battle of Fallen Timbers in northern Ohio — where a well-planned retreat to the safety of a nearby British fort was turned into a disaster for the Indian Confederacy — and a bitter lesson in British reliability that Tecumseh would never forget.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Tecumseh fights in the battle, and eventually has to withdraw, with part of his warriors, towards the British fort. The tribal people assume that the British are going to let them into the fort, and that there’ll be another stand made there — but the British refuse them entrance.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: The British slam the gates of the fort in their faces — fearful of a renewed war with the United States...To the Indians — to Tecumseh — this is another act of British betrayal.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Well, Fallen Timbers is a disaster for tribal people. And it is following this battle that the tribes are forced to sign the Treaty of Greenville — giving up about the southeastern two-thirds of Ohio. Tecumseh refuses to sign the treaty. He even refuses to participate in the proceedings. Tecumseh is incensed that they are now forced to give up much of his former homeland. But this is the death knell, in many ways, for the tribes in the Old Northwest.\n\nDonald L. Fixico, Historian: The natural world that the Shawnees knew...was changing. The eastern tribes are being pushed farther into their lands. There are observations of deer being less — bear being less, the receding of wild game. And so Tecumseh knows he has to construct some type of plan. And it has to be a large plan, in order to confront this huge westward expansion that begins to pulsate into different areas — into the Great Lakes area — and into the southeast part of the United States. But how do you stop this huge westward expansion?\n\nNarrator: The Treaty of Greenville marked a crucial turning point in the battle for the eastern half of the continent — opening the Ohio River Valley to a flood of white settlers — hemming the Shawnees and their allies onto dwindling tracts of land too small to sustain the old ways of life. Even in the newly created Territory of Indiana — into which Tecumseh and his followers now retreated, hoping to find refuge — a systematic policy of land loss and dispossession was soon put into place by American politicians — eager to effect the transfer of land any way they could — and convinced the Indian way of life was dying. “The American settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach the Indians,” President Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1801, “who will in time either incorporate with us as citizens of the United States, or remove beyond the Mississippi. Some tribes are advancing, and on these English seductions will have no effect. But the backward will yield, and be thrown further back into barbarism and misery...and we shall be obliged to drive them with the beasts of the forest into the stony mountains.”\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: I don’t think we appreciate just how ruthless Thomas Jefferson was as President in 1801 — and how ruthless folks like Jefferson’s territorial governor, William Henry Harrison were in the period specifically after 1800. The Americans employed what was called the “factory system.” And what that was the establishment of government forts throughout the old Northwest where the government would accept furs in exchange for goods. And it became a way of making native people into debtors of the United States. And when Thomas Jefferson becomes President, in his first term he writes William Henry Harrison and says, you know, essentially: “Through the factory system, native people will incur debts beyond what they are willing to pay. And they will only be able to pay those back through a cession of lands.”\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: So for the Shawnees — for Tecumseh — it was a period of continual dispossession — continual violence — and continual retreat. There is no place at that time you could really — if you were a Shawnee — have called home. Because it was constantly being taken off you.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: So that by 1805, native people find themselves confined to a small corridor of land — really a spit of land — in northwestern Ohio and northeastern Indiana. That’s all that’s left of them. And it is not enough to continue a hunting tradition. What was happening to them was a tragedy of epic proportions. Men could no longer hunt; they could no longer operate as life-sustaining killers; they could not feed their families via hunting; they were on a constant war footing. And... another horrifying aspect of it is that so many men have tried to protect their people through war, and have died doing it, that these villages are totally out of balance. So that there are probably double the number of women as men in any native village in 1805, because of this war of attrition. And so these are not only broken homes, but broken communities.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: It is a time in which disease flourishes and spreads across many of the tribes of the Ohio Valley. It is a time when alcoholism begins to spread among the tribe. The very fabric of tribal society — the kinship systems — seem to be under stress. And it’s a time when, I think, a lot of Shawnees are having second thoughts about: “Who are we, and what is going on here? Why has the Master of Life turned his face from us? What has happened to us? What have we done to cause this?”\n\nNarrator: By the spring of 1805, the misery and suffering in northern Indiana had reached the breaking point. In Tecumseh’s village along the White River, even so great a provider as he was helpless to defend his people from the rain of woe now descending upon them; while almost day by day, his younger brother, Lalawethika — a failed hunter and warrior, who had tried without success to support his family as a holy man and healer — sank further and further into an abyss of shame and despair.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: I think that Lalawethika fell victim to all of the worst unintended consequences of colonialism: you know he was an alcoholic; and many viewed him as lazy; prone to violence; he abused his wife. And so every opportunity that Lalawethika had to distinguish himself resulted in failure. And, by most accounts, he could not support his family. So that he was dependent upon Tecumseh, and others like him, to literally feed his family. He was so caught up in the sadness and the despair of dependency upon the United State in the form of alcohol; and the fur trade; of land loss. It was so destructive, and such a sad time.\n\nNarrator: It would be all the more surprising then in the dark spring of 1805 — as the universe continued to come unhinged for the Shawnees — that a message of terrifying beauty and hope would be brought to the beleaguered people — coming in their very darkest hour, and in the end, from the least likely of sources.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: In 1805, his family recalls an event in which Lalawethika falls into a fire, he just — he collapses. And everyone in his immediate family, his immediate vicinity, believes that he’s dead...But he miraculously comes back to life. He wakes up to report a vision of extraordinary breadth and power.\n\nLalawethika: I died, and was carried in a dream by the Master of Life down into the spirit world...until we came to a parting of the ways. To the right lay the road to paradise open only to the virtuous few...To the left, I saw an army of forsaken souls stumbling on towards three dark houses — fearful dwellings of punishment and pain...I saw unrepentant drunkards forced to swallow molten lead. And when they drank it their bowels were seized with an exquisite burning. At the last house their torment was inexpressible. I heard them scream, crying pitifully — roaring like the falls of a great river.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: When Lalawethika recovers from his vision, he says that he has come with a message. And the message is, I think, a message of revitalization — of restoration — for a people who’ve lost their way, in the way that he had lost his way. He is a reformed individual. He takes a new name for himself — Tenskwatawa, the “Open Door.” And the message that he brings — that Indian people can make themselves whole again — by rejecting the worst influences that white people have brought to them — hits a powerful chord. It gives people who may have lost hope a new hope. It gives them a direction. It gives them an opportunity to remake themselves — to restore themselves — by reviving their Indian culture and identity.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: Well, the impact is he reforms instantly...He suddenly doesn’t drink anymore...And he is preaching to others now that, “If you want to save yourselves...You have to have a personal revolution in your way of life.”\n\nTenskwatawa: My Children! The Great Spirit bids me say to you thus. You must not dress like the Whites...You must not get drunk. It displeases the Great Spirit...\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: It’s a world without alcohol — it’s a world without spousal abuse — you know, it’s a world without skin-hunting, in which men only kill in order to feed themselves and their families. And he formulated a message that appealed to a great many Shawnee, Delaware, Wyandotte, Kickapoo, Pottawatomie — because that was their experience at the time. You know, this is a world totally out of balance. And so his vision is a vision for all native people, in a broad way. It’s intended for everyone. And as a recovered alcoholic, you know, he could speak to people who had not had that conversion experience — who were still caught up in that cycle of despair.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: He took the name Tenskwatawa — the “open door” — which was a way of suggesting that you could reach grace through him — he was a doorway to salvation.\n\nNarrator: Friends and family members were astonished by the changes that had transformed Lalawethika almost overnight — and none more so than Tecumseh himself — who all through the fall and winter of 1805, looked on thoughtfully as young men from across the Midwest trooped into their village along the White River in increasing number — drawn by his brother’s siren call of renewal — and by his brother himself — who would soon be known simply as the Prophet.\n\nTenskwatawa: Now My Children, I charge you not to speak of this talk to the whites...The world is not as it was at first, but it is broken, and leans down; and those that are on the slope, from the Chippewas, and further, will all die, if the earth should fall; therefore, if they would live, every Indian village must send to me two persons to be instructed, so as to prevent it.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: I think Tecumseh understands that there are a whole bunch of wounded warriors out there — and by “wounded,” I mean people who are psychologically wounded, people who are culturally wounded. And I think he sees Tenskwatawa’s vision as a means of inspiring them to act — to pick up their feet, you know, and to join him. So he parlays Tenskwatawa’s vision into that kind of pan-Indian organizational scheme.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: And very quickly, you see as early as 1806 you see a political plan coming into it. Tecumseh is saying, “We can use this movement to reunify this broken people, the Shawnees.” Which was a long-desired dream of Shawnee leaders — to bring this scattered tribe together, and make them of consequence again.\n\nNarrator: In the spring of 1806, the two brothers took their first decisive step. Eager to establish a center for the new movement — and to re-assert the Shawnee claim to homelands already ceded by treaty — they moved their village to a new site in western Ohio — on the American side of the line established by the Treaty of Greenville ten years earlier, in open defiance of the American government — then sent out messengers to villages across the region, often led by Tecumseh himself.\n\nTecumseh: The Shawnees have heretofore been scattered about in parties, which we have found has been attended with bad consequences. We are now going to collect them all together to one town that one chief may keep them in good order, and prevent sickness, despair and disorder from coming among them.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Initially, Tecumseh remains in the Prophet’s shadow. We know that he’s aware of his brother’s transformation; we know that the brother lives in, quote, “Tecumseh’s village.” But it is the Prophet that first attracts the tribal people to the village.\n\nNarrator: From the start, the new movement sent shock waves surging through Indian country — unsettling native communities already rocked by decades of change — and deeply dividing the Shawnees themselves — along with other worn down tribes, like the Delawares and the Wyandots.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: The Shawnee chiefs in Ohio saw a power struggle in it straight away. They saw, “This is a man, from a junior division of the Shawnees, bidding for power — and we’re damn well not gonna give it to him.”\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: And even within Tecumseh's own nation, there are Shawnees who are now trying to follow the white man’s path — who are following the lead of Black Hoof, who was a person who had fought against the Americans through the Revolution, up until the Treaty of Greenville — but now, as an older man, is saying: “We fought. We’ve tried that way — it's not working — we need to try this way.”\n\nNarrator: In April 1806 — eager to win more recruits from among the troubled tribes in Ohio and Indiana — Tenskwatawa issued a direct challenge to any leaders who opposed him — accusing them of witchcraft, and of being in league with the U.S. government.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: He essentially engaged in a series of high-profile confrontations with their leaders to the point where he enters into a Wyandotte village and engages in a ritualized killing of a Wyandotte leader. He essentially accused him, and others like him, of being a witch — of attempting to undermine them, by acting as a kind of wedge for Americans to enter their communities and harm their people. And so people begin to see him as an iconoclast of sorts, who’s willing to take on government chiefs; who are in the pay of the United States. And his message spreads like wildfire as a result.\n\nNarrator: In late April — as a wave of fear and unease rippled through white communities in southern Indiana — the territorial governor, William Henry Harrison, fired off a letter to the Delawares — denouncing the Shawnee Prophet as an impostor — and urging them to put his supposed powers to the test.\n\nHarrison: My children. Who is this pretended prophet who dares to speak in the name of the great Creator? Examine him. If he is really a prophet, ask him to cause the sun to stand still, or the moon to alter its courses, the river to cease to flow or the dead to rise from their graves. If he does these things you may believe that he is sent from God. Otherwise drive him from your town and let peace and harmony prevail amongst you.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: And in June 1806 the Shawnee Prophet predicts an eclipse of the sun — called a “Black Sun” by the Shawnees — which is a sign of great things to come — a sign of great change. And, at first, many Shawnees — many other Indians — said, “Oh, this time I don’t really think he’s able to do it.”\n\nTenskwatawa: Did I not speak the truth? See now, the sun is dark!\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: And the eclipse was so complete that the farm animals, for example, went into the sheds; the birds roosted; etcetera. And the Prophet’s stock after this just rose like a skyrocket. William Henry Harrison could not have done anything that helps the Prophet, and propels the Prophet and Tecumseh to a position of prominence, more than issuing this challenge.\n\nNarrator: As news of the miracle spread, the trickle of pilgrims coming into Greenville swelled to a flood. By July, Ojibwa villages on the shores of Lake Superior stood empty and deserted. To the south, Potawatomis left corn crops standing in the fields, and came to hear the Shawnee holy man — whose words now, with each passing month, seemed to grow in stridency and power.\n\nTenskwatawa: My Children! The Great Spirit bids me say to you thus. Have very little to do with the Americans...They are unjust; they have taken away your lands which were not made for them. The Whites I have placed on the other side of the Great Water, to be another people, separate from you... [in time] I will overturn the land, so that all the white people will be covered and you alone shall inhabit the land.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: And the U.S. government panics...And the fear really proliferates. Because by 1807 certainly, I think most Americans just assumed an orderly process of dispossession and conquest, in which Native Americans would gradually recede from the picture, or assimilate into American society. And when Tenskwatawa has his vision, all of a sudden ten years of confidence erodes, as native people reconsider and attempt to reorganize themselves in an effective way against Jefferson’s vision of land loss and dispossession.\n\nNarrator: Now events began to accelerate. In the spring of 1807, the Indian agent at Fort Wayne, William Wells — alarmed by the upturn in Indians passing through his outpost — accused the Prophet of keeping settlers “in a continual state of uneaseness,” he said, and demanded he leave Greenville. That June — convinced that English agents operating out of Canada were egging the Indians on to war — William Henry Harrison fired off a letter to the Secretary of War. “I really fear,” he wrote, “that this said Prophet is an engine set to work by the British for some bad purpose.” In the fall of 1808, as the war of words grew louder — the two brothers decided to move their center of operations to a new site, a hundred and fifty miles west — strategically located near the junction of the Wabash and Tippecanoe Rivers, deep in Indiana Territory — far away from prying white eyes they hoped — and closer to the western tribes that had been most receptive to the Prophet’s message to begin with. The new village, called Prophetstown, would soon rise to become one of the greatest centers of Indian resistance on the North American continent. It would also become a major obstacle to the dreams of statehood nurtured by William Henry Harrison — who in 1809 redoubled his efforts to drive the Indians from Indiana — bribing local chiefs into signing away lands over which they had no authority — and pressing one land cession after another through the Territorial Legislature — culminating in the notorious Treaty of Fort Wayne in the autumn of 1809.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: The Treaty of Fort Wayne really changes everything, and the politics comes to the fore...Here’s three million acres of Indian land suddenly snatched away, and white settlements are moving closer than ever before to Prophetstown. And suddenly there is a need for very urgent political action.\n\nNarrator: For Tecumseh, it was the decisive moment. Convinced now that only the most radical and concerted efforts could save the Indian land base, he stepped out from behind his brother’s shadow once and for all and sprang into action. In the months and years to come — rallying warriors from half a continent to his cause — he would do everything he could to push back and redraw the still fluid boundaries of the new United States — and to create of a permanent Indian homeland in the very heartland of the country — bounded by the Ohio River to the south and east — by the Great Lakes to the north — and by the Mississippi River to the West — a United Indian States of America within the United States.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: Tecumseh’s vision is to establish, I think, what I would call cultural and physical space for Indian people. He understands that for Indian culture to survive and for Indian independence to survive there needs to be a land base, and that land base can only be preserved and protected by a united tribal resistance. This is no longer a fight that can be waged by just some Shawnees — just some Delawares, just some Wyandottes. He’s appealing to a larger, pan-Indian future, in which the future of all Indian peoples will be affected by the stand that Indian peoples take now.\n\nTecumseh: They have driven us from the sea to the lakes, and we can go no farther. They have taken upon themselves to say this tract of land belongs to the Miamis, this to the Delawares and so on...Our father tells us that we have no business on the Wabash — that the land belongs to other tribes...But the Great Spirit intended it to be the common property of all the tribes, nor can it be sold without the consent of all...\n\nNarrator: In 1809, Tecumseh set out with an entourage of warriors and interpreters on the first of a series of epic tours — east to the Shawnees and Wyandots in Ohio — west to the Sacs & Foxes and Winnabagoes in Illinois — south to the Creeks and Choctaws in Alabama and Georgia — and north, as far as way as Canada, to the home of the Senecas, the Iroquois — and the British — determined to swell the ranks of the burgeoning Indian confederacy any way he could — and to find supplies and reinforcements for the armed conflict he now knew was inevitable.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: He doesn’t pluck this confederacy out of nowhere...He just tries to revive the confederacy he had known as a young man. He even uses the same terminology — the idea that the land is held in common by the Indians. No one tribe can cede it without the permission of the others...And, therefore, it’s in all our interests to defend it. Now this was a job — [that was] much more difficult than the job of the American founding fathers — who at least had some tradition of common origin and a similar language and similar thought patterns and mind sets. On top of those problems, though, Tecumseh was facing the fact that these weren’t states, they were fragmented villages. So you couldn’t just convince a few chiefs and hope that was going to do the business for you...Those chiefs might have almost no or little authority within their own communities. But this lack of authority in Indian communities both played against him and for him, because...even if the chiefs were in opposition, he could pull the warriors from underneath them by appealing to them. And this is really one of his strategies.\n\nTecumseh: Listen, people. The past speaks for itself. “Where today are the Pequots? Where the Narragansetts, the Powatans, Pocanokets, and many other once powerful tribes of our race? Look abroad over their once beautiful country and what do you see now? Nothing but the ravages of the pale-face destroyers. So it will be with you Creek, Chickasaws and Choctaws. The annihilation of our race is at hand unless we unite in one common cause against the common foe.\n\nDonald L. Fixico, Historian: I mean, so many different groups come to this call for warriors. When you think about twenty different tribes — many in which the languages are so different and the politics are so different. He’s dissolved tribal barriers, tribal differences, cultural differences, as well — and he’s got them to believe in one mind. For one person to get so many people to come of the same mind — yes, indeed, it’s propaganda — yes indeed, it’s campaigning — yes indeed, it’s diplomacy — being an ambassador, a military strategist. And so, in my mind, he’s succeeded with this idea.\n\nNarrator:By 1810, the impact of Tecumseh’s diplomacy could be felt up and down the Wabash. By May, nearly a thousand people had streamed into Prophetstown, and all spring and summer the numbers continued to build. Fearing imminent bloodshed, William Henry Harrison called for a contingent of federal troops to reinforce the territorial capital at Vincennes — then sent a messenger to Prophetstown itself — urging the Prophet to come to Vincennes to air grievances about the Treaty of Fort Wayne. But it was Tecumseh himself who replied — telling the messenger that he personally would come to meet with Harrison — to discuss Indian outrage over the newly ceded lands. On August 12th, 1810, a party of seventy-five warriors with Tecumseh in command arrived at Harrison’s headquarters at Vincennes for the historic confrontation.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: There were some canonical stories about Tecumseh, which, even if you knew nothing else you could say, “This is someone you have to reckon with.” One of them is that confrontation with Harrison in 1810...that magnificent, really, confrontation...where he knew a conflict was coming, and so did Harrison. And here you have two representatives of entirely different philosophies and points of view...And neither individual was afraid of the other. Harrison had no need to be; the resources were all behind him. But Tecumseh — there was no sense that being in a weak position should mitigate, or reduce his point of view or the worthiness of his cause.\n\nTecumseh: How my Brother can you blame me for placing little confidence in the promises of our fathers the Americans? You have endeavored to make distinctions. You have taken tribes aside. You wish to prevent the Indians from uniting, and from considering their land the common property of the whole. I do not see how we can remain at peace with you if you continue to do so. Brother. This land that was sold, and the goods that were given for it, were done only by the few. If you continue to purchase land from those who have no right to sell it, I do not know what will be the consequence. I now wish you to listen to me, Brother. I tell you so because I am authorized by all the tribes to do so. I am at the head of them all. I am a Warrior, and all the Warriors will meet together in two or three moons from this. Then I will call for those chiefs that sold you the land and shall know what to do with them. For Brother, we want to save this land; we do not wish you to take it. And if you take it you shall be the cause of trouble between us.\n\nHarrison: The United States has not treated the Indians dishonestly nor unjustly. Indians are not one nation, nor do they own the land in common. Has not the Great Spirit given them separate tongues?\n\nTecumseh: How dare you!\n\nHarrison: This council is over.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: He stood up in a very remarkable and frank way and more or less admitted to Harrison that war would come. I think he said at one point: “You are pushing us into a conflict. We have no alternative. This is going to happen if you continue with this policy.” And, of course, Harrison certainly was going to continue that policy. But both men gave no ground.\n\nNarrator: For nearly a week the talks continued — Tecumseh insisting the lands be returned; Harrison, insisting they had been fairly acquired, refusing to return them. Before the deadlocked meetings adjourned, Harrison promised to pass Tecumseh’s demands on to the president in Washington — adding, however, that he very much doubted the request would be granted. No one present ever forgot Tecumseh’s reply.\n\nTecumseh: As the Great Chief in Washington is to determine the matter, I hope the Great Spirit will put some sense into his head to induce him to direct you to give up this land. It is true, he is so far off. He will not be injured by the war. He may still sit in his town, and drink his wine, whilst you and I will have to fight it out.\n\nHarrison: The implicit obedience and respect which the followers of Tecumseh pay to him is really astonishing and more than any other circumstance bespeaks him one of those uncommon geniuses, which spring up occasionally to produce revolutions and overturn the established order of things. If it were not for the vicinity of the United States, he would perhaps be the founder of an Empire that would rival in glory that of Mexico or Peru.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: Now, Tecumseh did a remarkable thing. He said a remarkable thing in 1810, when he confronted Harrison at Vincennes. He said something I don’t think any Native American had before, and I don’t think many had said afterwards. He stood up, defended Indian land, and said he represented every Indian on the continent. Now, what a preposterous assertion, even for someone whose life had been so far-flung as his. But to make such a claim at that time — it was an absolutely preposterous thing to say. Yet what he was saying was that he understood that Native American peoples were in a particular historical predicament, and he was articulating that predicament — and he was doing it for all of them.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Well, I think by 1811 Tecumseh can see that war is imminent between the Americans and the British, and I think he hopes to use this war to help defend Native American homelands in the Old Northwest. The problem for Tecumseh is always gonna be one of logistics. It’s one of bringing in large numbers of warriors...and supplying them, and feeding them, and providing them with adequate arms and ammunition.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: My sense of Tecumseh is that he was keenly aware of moments of opportunity; and moments to strike; moments to act — and 1811 was not one of those moments.\n\nNarrator: The dog days of summer 1811 were just reaching their peak when Tecumseh embarked on one last grueling tour — heading South this time, to what the Shawnees called the Mid-Day — determined to bring the Chickasawas, Choctaws and Creeks of Mississippi and Alabama into the confederacy, and to shore up British support for the movement — as Britain itself edged closer and closer to a new war with the United States. Before leaving Prophetstown, Tecumseh urged his younger brother to do everything he could to keep from being drawn into a fight with Harrison prematurely — then made one last stop at Vincennes to see Harrison himself before continuing south — hoping to convince him not initiate hostilities.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: Well, I think it was crucial to hold off for several reasons. The first is that Tecumseh was the only person equipped to lead; the second being that British support was crucial — and, whatever they did, it had to be coordinated with the British — and third, I think Tecumseh was really confident that his Southeastern tour would result in a great many adherents.\n\nHarrison: August 6th, 1811. The day before he set out, he paid me a visit, and labored hard to convince me that he had no other intention by his journey to the south than to prevail on all the tribes to unite in the bonds of peace. August 7th. He is now upon the last round to put a finishing stroke to his work. I hope, however, before his return that that part of the fabric which he had considered complete will be demolished, and even its foundations rooted up.\n\nNarrator: In late August — writing that Tecumseh’s “great talents alone were holding together the heterogeneous mass” of warriors on the Wabash — Harrison received permission to march on Prophetstown — and one month later — on September 26th, 1811 — at the head of a force of nearly 1000 men — headed north towards the Indian stronghold, a hundred and eighty miles away. As reports came in to Prophetstown of Harrison’s approaching army, hundreds of warriors converged on the Indian village to defend it.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: As Tenskwatawa watches the American army advance, he is faced with the question of what to do. Do you sit and wait, to see if the American intentions are peaceful, or should you strike against it? When Tenskwatawa hears of the American army advancing, he interprets this as an act of aggression.\n\nNarrator: Around two o’clock on the afternoon of November 6th Harrison’s thousand-man force clambered up a steep ravine on the eastern side of a narrow stream called Burnett’s creek, and went into camp on a narrow bench of high ground, planted with high oak trees. One mile to the east lay Prophetstown, stretching south along the Wabash from the mouth of the Tippecanoe. As the light began to fail, two officers and an interpreter rode out under a white flag to convey Harrison’s orders that the Indian camp disperse.\n\nStephen Warren, Historian: Tippecanoe. There’s a crucial moment on November 6th, when Harrison arrives. He arrives with more than a thousand men. And Harrison and Tenskwatawa agree to meet the next day, to discuss how they might reach some kind of compromise. But on the night of November 6th, Tenskwatawa is besieged by his Western Algonquian allies, and they tell him, “Look. You know, we have to fight, we have to surprise them. They think we’re going to have a discussion, but let’s wage a preemptive strike.” To come all that way and to do nothing but wait for Tecumseh made little sense to them...And so Tenskwatawa goes against his brother’s wishes for him. You know, he caves to pressure. And not only that, but he tells his allies that they’ll be safe from American bullets — that his power as a medicine man is such that no one will be harmed.\n\nNarrator: Sometime in the night, a long column of warriors began to file silently out of the village — heading in a long arc for the northwest corner of the American encampment.\n\nDonald L. Fixico, Historian: It was a very wet morning. Sentries are posted and everything. And possibly, Winnebago warriors, but certainly warriors tried to penetrate the camp, crawling into the camp. And they even make it past the sentries.\n\nNarrator: Around four in the morning, a picket stationed a few yards out beyond the left flank of the camp thought he saw something moving in the trees. Whipping his musket to his shoulder, he fired blindly into the gloom — mortally wounding a Kickapoo warrior as he attempted to steal into the camp. Harrison himself was in his tent, when the first shot rang out — followed by a series bloodcurdling war cries — and a tremendous crash of muskets — as the war party rushed in. The Battle of Tippecanoe had begun.\n\nJohn Sugden, Biographer: It was a classic Indian attack. If you don’t have the numbers on your side, you make a sudden attack and try to overwhelm and demoralize the enemy quickly. And it was carried through at Tippecanoe with great determination — considering how few warriors there were. And they didn’t have much ammunition. The Indians were a very mobile force. They’re almost like water — they gave way to things; and they strengthened around weak points in a very flexible way. They didn't have to wait for orders from chiefs — they fought very much individually. So if they perceived a force getting out of its depth — moving forward and getting split up from the main force — they could easily rally round and start surrounding it, and cutting it to pieces. I mean, if there had been more Indians on the ground, the Indians might have been capable of inflicting great damage.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: The Indian warriors attack Harrison's army in camp. For a moment, it looks as if the Indians have infiltrated the lines; there's confusion. But as the light increases, it becomes clear to the Americans that the Indians lack the numbers, and that they lack the ammunition to carry this assault home. And, eventually, the Indians are driven from the field. In reality, the Americans suffered probably more casualties than the Indians. The American force was superior; the American force was better armed; the American force had more ammunition. But I do think that it represents a blow to the confederacy.\n\nNarrator: On the night of November 8th — two days after the battle — Harrison’s soldiers edged warily into Prophetstown for the first time — only to find that the confederated forces had dispersed into the surrounding country side. Ordering his men to plunder the village — setting fire to the lodges — and destroying all the Indian’s food supplies — Harrison headed back down the Wabash towards Vincennes — declaring in dispatches his mission had been accomplished.\n\nDonald L. Fixico, Historian: Following the defeat at Prophetstown one would think that all of this was over. And it was not — it was just the beginning in fact. It was an impossible task of the largest scale for Tecumseh to rebuild his army — and yet he did it — making twice the effort, twice the stamina.\n\nColin Calloway, Historian: When Tecumseh comes home, he’s reputed to have grabbed the Prophet by the hair and shaken him — and reprimanded him — scolded him — for this foolish action.\n\nR. David Edmunds, Historian: Tecumseh, we know, is very angry with his brother after this battle. And I think the Prophet spends the rest of his life trying to get back into a position of prominence.\n\nDonald L. Fixico, Historian: So Tecumseh has a choice. Do you discard the Prophet? Or do you reunite [with] him in this effort? And he realizes that he has to embrace him again. And he forgives his brother. And so now we’re in the next chapter of rebuilding this huge army. And this time — make no [mistaken] doub"
