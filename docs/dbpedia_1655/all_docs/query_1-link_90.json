        "text": "UP's Roadmap to Preparedness program offers easy-to-use tools and resources that help people take advantage of our organization's hindsight and expertise. The Roadmap to Preparedness program helps consumers avoid the dangers of underinsurance and other common disaster recovery obstacles. Our Preparedness education program and hands-on tools help consumers:\n\n1. Be insurance literate and make smart insurance buying choices.\n\n2. Keep insurance costs down without sacrificing essential protection.\n\n3. Double check how much insurance is needed for full protection.\n\n4. Benefit from after-the-fact lessons learned by disaster victims.\n\n5. Inventory a home’s contents and store records off site.\n\n6. Know what steps to take to make a home more resistant to damage.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAdults\n\nThe goal of our Roadmap to Recovery program is to help policyholders get fair and prompt insurance settlements and navigate challenges of repairing and/or replacing damaged or destroyed property. The unique value of our support offerings lay in our volunteers (many of whom lost a home or survived an illness or serious disabling injury), paid staff, as well as compassionate claim help professionals (contractors, estimators, public adjusters, and lawyers) from all over the United States. Through our Roadmap to Recovery program we offer:\n\n1. Free workshops that educate survivors in all aspects of the recovery process: from clean-up to reconstruction, mortgage and debt obligations, taxes, professional help services and emotional challenges.\n\n2. Emotional support for current survivors, as well as insurance and rebuilding tips from experienced mentors in our Disaster Survivor Support Network.\n\n3. A secure online \"Ask an Expert” forum where survivors can find free confidential online answers to their questions.\n\n4. The Survivor to Survivor Network, connects to firestorm survivors by invitation only. Allows survivors to share valuable information with others who are in the process of recovering from a recent loss.\n\n5. An extensive library of tips, articles, and sample letters, written by UP staff with help from attorneys, consumer advocates, public adjusters, agents, and former industry insiders. Our tips help survivors understand the process and get fair claim settlements.\n\n6. Recovery Kits that include: Recovery Handbook, a journal for tracking contacts and progress, recovery flash drive, and other organizational aids.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAdults\n\nThrough our Advocacy and Action Program, UP helps strengthen laws that protect policyholders’ rights. We educate the public, the media and decision makers in government and industry on insurance issues from the consumers’ perspective. UP’s highly-regarded Amicus Project advocates for sound public policy on insurance matters in courts of law throughout the United States.\n\nThrough the Advocacy and Action Program UP:\n\n· Offers an ever-growing archive of more than 250 amicus briefs submitted by UP in state and federal insurance cases that affect policyholders. UP’s amicus briefs make points for reviewing judges to consider. Judicial decisions define insurance consumers' rights and insurance companies' obligations, so they are critically important and have long-lasting impact.\n\n· Advocate and network with state insurance regulators and industry representatives through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).\n\n· Draft and help pass laws that benefit and protect policyholders. Resist legislation that weakens protections.\n\n· Draw the media’s attention to problems and provide consumers’ perspectives on insurance matters.\n\n· Help level the playing field in between policyholders and insurers.\n\nPopulation(s) Served\n\nAdults"
