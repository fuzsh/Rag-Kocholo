        "text": "The book Ordinary Injustice: How America Holds Court written by Amy Bach reflects upon “ordinary injustice” that members of society fall victim to by the American criminal justice system. In short, the phrase “ordinary injustice” comes from the improper acts that have become second nature to court officials but has yet to be explained and resolved by other actors in the court. It is noted in the text that “ordinary injustice results when a community of legal professionals becomes so accustomed to a pattern of lapses that they can no longer see their role in them” (Bach 2). This recurring pattern has been easy to identify by outsiders but difficult to handle by insiders of the court. Bach supports this idea by making clear that, “proving mistakes, both visible and invisible, [is] very difficult in the criminal justice system, even for those who are insiders” (258).\n\nLaw and Order’s portrayal of the justice system further validated my preexisting notions of the flaws of the justice system, and also led me to an interesting realization; the episode seems to imply that the justice system’s spiteful, irrational response to violent crimes is, above all else, an indictment on society. Following the execution, District Attorney Adam Schiff is asked why he changed his stance on capital punishment. His response is clear: it wasn’t he who changed his mind; instead, “the people changed theirs” (“Aftershock”). The criminal justice system didn’t shape itself into the flawed institution that it has become; conversely, it was the general population’s insecurity and vengeance that really gave birth to this system. But why? As\n\nThe book Soul of a Citizen by Paul Loeb makes a compelling case for civic engagement. The book emphasizes the need for people to get involved in civic life and it gives examples of people who made a huge impact just by deciding to do. These people saw something that was not right and they went out of their way to help. However, it was not size but they made up their mind that this was what they were going to do and went about doing it. They did not know that by doing that they were going to make a huge impact but they ended up making a huge impact and creating change. Just as these people did, I believe that everyone can engage in civic change and make a different. In this paper, I am going to discuss ways an average citizen can engage in civic life, ways that social worker can encourage others to get involved in civic life and why is it important for social workers to serve in this role.\n\nThere has been a case that has been going on for nineteen moths about a person named Dylann Roof who commuted inhumane act by murdering nine African American church goers due to his racial hatred towards the black community. After a lot of investigation the jury of six whites and three black gave their decision on him last month and he was found guilty of thirty three counts. For this reason the jury decides a death penalty on him even though the victims’ family forgave him. Although, it was certain that the Jury was going to lean toward the death penalty because he didn’t have any witnesses to help him defend and most of all he decided to be a lawyer for himself, which made difficult of proving himself innocent or even reduce the penalty\n\nBryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative and a professor at New York University Law School, brilliantly captures the stories of Walter McMillian and many others who have suffered from the corruption and racism of the criminal justice system in his novel Just Mercy. He exposes the abuse of laws by government officials to inflict severe sentences on the poor and suffering people of this nation. He wants his readers to feel the agony and helplessness of these people who have been forgotten and left to the hands of a cruel and unrelenting organization. Just Mercy argues that government officials prey on the poor and condemn them in an unjust way.\n\nWarning! A runaway robber has just been caught in the middle of the highway. Policemen are investigating the case and considering if they should punish the criminal or let him go. How will prison affect the person? Will he benefit from time in prison or will it only make him worse? The theme of justice and punishment is explored in real life and books. Life in prison may have some positive influences, but to a large extent it is not successful in changing someone’s mindset. In the book “In Cold Blood”, Truman Capote uses syntax,diction, and a variety of details to support the theme that justice and punishment is not effective.\n\nReading newspapers or watching TV at home, at least we find one article or news describing a killing, a shooting, or an armed robbery. With all these problems, we are in fear but cannot avoid hearing and dealing with them. They happen every day and some time justice system blunders and leads to wrongly convict people for what they do not commit. This is reality of wrecked system that is resulted by injustice and corruption. Ultimately, Errol Morris confirms this reality based on a true story of an innocent convicted Randal Adams for a criminal case by creating a film, The Thin Blue Line. David Harris, an important accuser, claims Adams was a murderer and shot Robert Wood, a Dallas police officer. With Morris’ suspicion of Adams’ innocence,\n\nHe is a bigot and a racist, and one of the last jurors to vote not guilty. He is very stubborn and doesn't understand why it's taking so long to reach a verdict. To him, \"those people\" (perhaps either referring to the kid’s race or for him being a teenager) are \"potential menaces to society\" and he doesn't \"want any part of them.\" As the play goes on, he continually fights against those who are voting not guilty, for no particular reason but his prejudice all while ignoring the facts related to the case. Near the end, all of his prejudice and hate comes out in a big monologue. As he is speaking, the other jurors turn their backs on him as they recognize the motives for his verdict. He soon comes to the realization that there is no foundation for his prejudices and is ashamed of his outburst. He finally votes not guilty and sits down silent, defeated, and embarrassed. It is unfortunately inevitable that these characters come out in situations even in this age. It is even more unfortunate that these same exact people are also serving jury duty in the American court system. Is it necessarily “bad” that some people scrutinize through filters with which they view the world around them? Just as the rest of the jury realized the erroneous motives of number 10, these types of people force people to reevaluate their own ways of thinking and seek empathy before reaching a conclusion in their own\n\nSince 1960, 200,000 murders have remained unsolved, allowing dangerous people to continue to walk the streets. There have been murders for a number of reasons from gang related violence to domestic disputes. The United States had 16,121 murders in 2015 alone. However, the scary part of all of this is how horribly the United States Justice System has failed at solving these crimes. Only 67.1% of all murders end in arrest which means that out of the 16,121 murders in the United States last year only 10,817 were solved which means that over 5 thousand of these murderers still walk the streets. This alone makes people very angry and want to seek revenge or become a vigilantly such as the case of the Judge in the novel And Then There Were None.\n\nToday, in the United States, most citizens are able to appreciate the fair, balanced legal system that is in place. The country suffered many failures before establishing the United States Constitution, and later the Bill of Rights, which became the foundation of the country’s legal system and protection of the citizens’ rights (American Sentinel University). Citizens may take their right to trial or their right to due process for granted, without realizing how life was before these rights were recognized and established. Until the Constitution in 1787, the justice system was not permanent and not quite clear, causing unfair and unjust treatment. Of course, no system can be perfect, but it is possible to discover options that suit the wants\n\nHe plays the role of 'appointed leader', or the individual who is assigned the leader position from the onset. A simple man who clearly does not understand the complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film ' when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected Foreman of the jury ' a task he clearly does not enjoy. Juror #2 is a small, quite man who is clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. In his subdued 'observer' and meek 'information giver' role, No. 2 apparently finds comfort in his job ' he is an accountant. Juror # 3 is probably the most complex personality in the film. He starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, analyzing the case impartially, explaining the arguments well and is reasonably self-assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate exploding in disbelieving anger and seems somehow to be personally involved with the case. His motivation for behaving as he does is revealed when he discloses that he's not on good terms with his own son. Illusions to his animosity toward youth were made when he says that kids today have no respect and that he has not see his son in over a decade. No.3 namely plays the 'aggressive', 'dominator' and 'blocker' roles. His personal baggage with his own son 'blocked' or"
