The unstoppable progress” - Oleksandr Ivanusenko, Chief Production Officer for Forbes Ukraine Oleksandr works in the company since 2002. Started as a technologist in the alcoholic beverage industry. Since 2004 is the Head of Production. “For more than 20 years that I have been working with the Nemiroff team the company underwent huge changes. In 2004, there was a new product line rollout. In 2016, we performed the renovation of production facilities in three workshops that were grouped in a single place. During the next year, we launched a product line for the De Luxe premium segment, renovated the design, and developed new spirits. Nemiroff is a developing venture. Even after many years of working here, it is interesting to watch the production cycles: the withdrawal of water from artesian wells, the process of water purification, mixing of water together with spirits, multiple-stage filtration, creation of alcoholic beverages from obtained liquid, and its further bottling. It is especially interesting to watch all of this and observe how product standards, alcoholic beverages, and the brand itself change with the course of time in general. What makes me continue working in the Nemiroff team? The unstoppable progress. When you work for many years in the company, you begin to feel yourself as a part of its huge organism. It changes, it develops, and you do it together with it. Moreover, the company decently proved itself during wartime: it saved all the jobs, including those who emigrated and those who were enlisted to defend our state. Wages were paid to the employees even in the hardest first months of the war when production practically stopped” Full article in English: https://lnkd.in/eZPbYMf6 Open positions at Nemiroff: https://lnkd.in/egciJHji #ThatsMySpirit #NemiroffTeam\n\nRegardless of the industry you work in, research is a key element in understanding market trends, analyzing the competition and even stimulating creative insights. From an early age, I had the opportunity to enter the job market. One of the positions I held was Marketing Promotion Supervisor at Brahma, a renowned Brazilian brewery. Discovering the history of Birra Menabrea SpA was an enriching experience for me, not only in terms of learning, but also as an opportunity to revisit previous knowledge. The MeBo (Menabrea Botalla) museum, located in Biella, tells the story of the friendship and expansion of two local companies, the second of which specializes in cheese production. The close ties between Franco Thedy and Andrea Bonino, CEOs of Menabrea and Botalla respectively, have resulted in several mutually beneficial partnerships and exchanges of experience. Among these collaborations is the creation of “sbirro” cheese, made from Menabrea beer. The commitment to innovation on the part of these entrepreneurs has allowed them to earn various awards, even at the international level. In addition, our trainer highlighted Menabrea’s positive impact on the local economy, since most of the raw materials come from Piedmont, such as laurel water and hops. In a highly competitive market, where consumer loyalty to their favorite brands is crucial, the ability to innovate and establish strategic partnerships becomes even more relevant. The case of Menabrea and Botalla exemplifies the power of cooperation and innovation as drivers of business success. #mebo #menabrea #beer #cheese #business #internationalbusiness #globalleaders #benchmark #biella #italia\n\nWhisky Business: Pouring Growth in Every Glass Let's talk whisky, folks – specifically, Scotch whisky! You might think it's all about tradition and aged barrels, but here's a hot take: innovation is actually the spirit fueling its success. That's right, while some of us are sipping on the familiar, others are boldly blending new experiences. The Scotch Whisky Association spilled the beans, showing a 14% surge in exports. One quote from the article really hit home: \"Scotch whisky is a taste of Scotland.\" And guess what? This makes me think of our own philosophy at Supergay Spirits – it's all about capturing the essence of who we are in every bottle. Just like Scotland's pride in their whisky, we pour our heart and soul into crafting spirits that celebrate authenticity and diversity. Cheers to that!
