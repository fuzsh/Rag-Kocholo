        "text": "\"With each and every day, the continuing success of our city is apparent. Along with the positive accomplishments, we are seeing an increase of visitors and along with that is an increase in vehicle presence. Additionally, we have seen a large spike in requests for parade permits and assembly permits. We are thrilled to see such interest and pride in all things related to our amazing community, and we look forward sharing the positive experiences our city has to offer. We strive to provide a safe and secure setting for such celebrations, concerts, festivals, parades, etc.\n\nIn order to accommodate the numerous inquiries we receive, we have a process set in place to analyze each individual event request, its safety, and the impact on the immediately surrounding community. The permit requests begin at the Hamilton Police Department, move through several channels within the city, and then circle back to the Hamilton Police Department. In order to help the efficiency of this process, we have put this informational packet together to cover the main topics of concern for those that may desire to request one of the above permits.”\n\n- Lt. Brian Robinson"
