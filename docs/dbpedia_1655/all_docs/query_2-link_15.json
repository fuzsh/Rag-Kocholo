        "text": "Imagine a world where justice is a reality for everyone, and data not only exists but empowers communities to drive change. We‚Äôre not just imagining it - we‚Äôre creating it. All In is a network for agencies, community partners, and individuals to come together to advance data transparency and accessibility across the country. Are you All In? Sign up to learn how we‚Äôll work together to build a more accountable criminal justice system: https://lnkd.in/e32E_frb\n\nHave you ever asked yourself the question ‚ÄúWho is justice for?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúWhy do we value justice?‚Äù, and ‚ÄúAre our justice systems equipped to respond to the needs of those they should serve?‚Äù These are some of the questions we delve into in this post, the latest in a series of blogs from our ‚ÄòAccess to Justice‚Äô project. üí¨üåç Read the our justice blogpost series and join our conversation on advancing women‚Äôs access to justice through a people-centered approach: https://lnkd.in/eGSfAbD6\n\nFighting for justice is not just something you do for yourself. üßë‚öñÔ∏è By proving that justice is archivable and something worth fighting for, you encourage people around you along with the future generations to do the same, make better choices, and create a better future for everyone. #fightforjustice #quoteoftheday #wolfgramlaw #justice\n\nThe new issue of The Journal of Intellectual Freedom and Privacy is out! This was a special issue edited by Jeanie Austin and focusing on Access to Information in Carceral Institutions. Kurtis Tanaka, PhD and I wrote a brief commentary on censorship and surveillance in higher education in prison. I think we've learned a lot since we drafted this piece, but it serves as a good, brief introduction to the issues in the field. Can't wait to dig into the other commentaries and the feature piece from Moira Marquis, PhD. Link to the full issue: https://lnkd.in/eAfKZS99 (It is paywalled and you have to be an ALA member to access, but reach out if you want to talk more about the piece that Kurtis and I wrote.)\n\nIn a world where every global challenge demands more attention, support, and resources, organizations addressing these issues are recognizing the power of visual communication. üåç‚ú® We've all seen how effective storytelling can be when combined with striking infographics and creative data visualization. They help convey messages in a way that resonates with people. But, here's the tricky part: when it comes to human rights, the realities can be downright ugly and heart-wrenching. There's no easy way to make these issues 'fun or appealing.' üôÖüèª‚ôÄÔ∏è That's why I want to take a moment to highlight the incredible work being done by Mandy Kabasa for SYNERGY FOR JUSTICE. She understands the gravity of human rights issues and knows how to craft impactful designs that support this critical work. üëèüé® It's a reminder that, even in the face of some of the world's toughest challenges, creativity and thoughtful design can play a crucial role in raising awareness and inspiring change. ü§ù Let's celebrate the designers and advocates who use their talents to amplify the voices of those who need it most. üì£üí™ #DesignForHumanRights #VisualCommunication #ImpactfulDesigns https://lnkd.in/d2FH4m8t"
