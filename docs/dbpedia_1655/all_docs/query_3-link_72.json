        "text": "CSPA HOME\n\nThe Columbia Scholastic Press Association is pleased to announce the 2024 Gold Circle winners in the High School category. This is the 41st year of the program.\n\nGold Circle Awards are offered to recognize superior work by student journalists usually as individuals but sometimes as an entire staff working with either print or online media. The awards recognize individual achievement by students from any CSPA member in four major categories: News; Magazine; Digital Media; and Yearbook.\n\nThis year, these categories attracted 6,970 entrants. These entries come from publications produced by students at colleges, universities, and secondary schools throughout the United States and overseas who follow an American education plan.\n\nIn summary, judges cited a total of 1,204 winners, either as First, Second or Third Place, or for Certificates of Merit (Honorable Mention) in a category. Thank you to all who entered.\n\nAll entries were published during the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nCongratulations to all our winners!\n\nPRINT MAGAZINES\n\nM01 Open (Free-Form) Poetry\n\n1.
