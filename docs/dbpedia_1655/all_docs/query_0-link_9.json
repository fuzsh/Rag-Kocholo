        "text": "An anonymous donor read Ordinary Injustice and presented Amy with seed money to start the organization to help the country:\n\na) be able to see trends and patterns that are otherwise invisible and\n\nb) ground criminal justice policy in fact.\n\nMFJ was awarded a grant from the Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance. With the help of several measurement experts, we developed an initial set of measures to be piloted in Milwaukee County, and then we decided to cover the entire state. Based on the success of that pilot, MFJ received funding to measure more states. MFJ proved that comparative data can be acquired, cleaned, coded, and run through a series of performance measures to bring some long overdue transparency to the criminal justice system.\n\nWe helped inform a groundbreaking new data law in Florida that mandated nearly every county agency and office needed to collect the same data, in the same way, and to report those data to the same place.\n\nWe launched our first Commons data platform with the Yolo D.A.’s office in California. The platform allows the public, police, prosecutors, courts to work together to make criminal justice performance data available and shared policy goals public.\n\nWe continue to refine a national set of police measures with input from community leaders and police departments and begin to pilot these measures with the West Sacramento Police Department in California and the Rochester Police Department in New York."
