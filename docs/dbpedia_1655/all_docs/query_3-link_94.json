        "text": "Amy Beach, Passionate Victorian by Adrienne Fried Block\n\nCall Number: B Beach B\n\nISBN: 0195074084\n\nAmy Marcy Cheney Beach (1867-1944), the most widely performed composer of her generation, was the first American woman to succeed as a creator of large-scale art music. Her \"Gaelic\" Symphony, given its premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1896, was the first work of its kind by anAmerican woman to be performed by an American orchestra. Almost all of her more than 300 works were published soon after they were composed and performed, and today her music is finding new advocates and audiences for its energy, intensity, and sheer beauty. Yet, until now, no full-length criticalbiography of Beach's life or comprehensive critical overview of her music existed. This biography admirably fills that gap, fully examining the connections between Beach's life and work in light of social currents and dominant ideologies.Born into a musical family in Victorian times, Amy Beach started composing as a child of four and was equally gifted as a pianist. Her talent was recognized early by Boston's leading musicians, who gave her unqualified support. Although Beach believed that the life of a professional musician wasthe only life for her, her parents had raised her for marriage and a career of amateur music-making. Her response to this parental (and later spousal) opposition was to find creative ways of reaching her goal without direct confrontation. Discouraged from a full-scale concert career, she insteadfound her metier in composition.Success as a composer of art songs came early for Beach: indeed, her songs outsold those of her contemporaries. Nevertheless, she was determined to separate her work from the genteel parlor music women were writing in her day by creating large-scale works--a Mass, a symphony, and chamber music--thatchallenged the accepted notion that women were incapable of creating high art. She won the respect of colleagues and the allegiance of audiences. Many who praised her work, however, considered her an exception among women. Beach's reaction to this was to join with other women composers of seriousmusic by promoting their works along with her own.Adrienne Fried Block has written a biography that takes full account of issues of gender and musical modernism, considering Beach in the contexts of her time and of her composer contemporaries, both male and female. Amy Beach, Passionate Victorian will be of great interest to students and scholarsof American music, and to music lovers in general.\n\nThe Heart of a Woman by Rae Linda Brown\n\nCall Number: B PRICE B\n\nISBN: 9780252043239\n\nThe Heart of a Woman offers the first-ever biography of Florence B. Price, a composer whose career spanned both the Harlem and Chicago Renaissances, and the first African American woman to gain national recognition for her works. Price's twenty-five years in Chicago formed the core of a working life that saw her create three hundred works in diverse genres, including symphonies and orchestral suites, art songs, vocal and choral music, and arrangements of spirituals. Through interviews and a wealth of material from public and private archives, Rae Linda Brown illuminates Price's major works while exploring the considerable depth of her achievement. Brown also traces the life of the extremely private individual from her childhood in Little Rock through her time at the New England Conservatory, her extensive teaching, and her struggles with racism, poverty, and professional jealousies. In addition, Brown provides musicians and scholars with dozens of musical examples.\n\nHildegard von Bingen by Heinrich Schipperges; John A. Broadwin (Translator)\n\nCall Number: 282.092 S\n\nISBN: 1558761373\n\nThe contemporaries of Hildegard of Bingen called her \"\"prophetissa teutonica\"\", honouring her philosophical writings and interpretation of the cosmos. Mediaevalists still consider her one of the leading mystics, and point to her active spiritual and artistic life in the 12th century as the finest example of what a woman can achieve. The abbess Hildegard of Bingen was the first composer to sign her musical works. As a playwright and author, she witnessed and shaped the time of the Crusades, the literary minnesang, and political and theological debate. The author of this text draws a complex picture of her life and work, as he \"\"translates\"\" Hildegard's ideas and her mysterious world of symbols from mediaeval Latin into contemporary concepts. Heinrich Schipperges delineates this remarkable thinker's view of the human being as a microcosm of the universe, intricately bound by the senses to the life of the soul, nature, and God.\n\nJoan Tower by Ellen K. Grolman\n\nCall Number: B Tower G\n\nISBN: 9780810856530\n\nThrough her compelling and well-crafted body of work over almost five decades, Joan Tower has become one of the world's most admired and celebrated composers. Joan Tower: The Comprehensive Bio-Bibliography celebrates her achievements and compositions, whether works for orchestra, symphonic band, chamber ensemble, or solo instrument. Author Ellen Grolman gives a full biography of the composer, supported by extensive personal interviews and family history dating back to 1637. She explores the experiences and influences that have shaped Tower's musical voice, from her upbringing in South America to her establishment of the Da Capo Chamber Players, and from her flight from serialism to her maturation into one of the most sought-after composers at work today. The book also gives extensive analysis of the composer's style, composing process, musical influences, and passionate advocacy of contemporary music. Many of the talented and esteemed soloists, chamber ensembles, and symphonic organizations with whom Tower has worked, including Leonard Slatkin, Zubin Mehta, the Emerson String Quartet, David Shifrin, Tania Le√≥n, and Jennifer Higdon, speak candidly about their experiences with Joan Tower in the Peer Reflections section of the book. The bibliography of works lists each composition with date of publication, duration, dedication and commissioning data, and when available, premiers and selected performances. The discography entries include both commercial and non-commercial recordings, and an annotated bibliography precedes a comprehensive index.\n\nRuth Crawford Seeger by Judith Tick\n\nCall Number: B Seeger T\n\nISBN: 0195065093\n\nRuth Crawford Seeger (1901-1953) is frequently considered the most significant American female composer in this century. Joining Aaron Copland and Henry Cowell as a key member of the 1920s musical avant-garde, she went on to study with modernist theorist and future husband Charles Seeger,writing her masterpiece, String Quartet 1931, not long after. But her legacy extends far beyond the cutting edge of modern music. Collaborating with poet Carl Sandburg on folk song arrangements in the twenties, and with the famous folk-song collectors John and Alan Lomax in the 1930s, she emerged asa central figure in the American folk music revival, issuing several important books of transcriptions and arrangements and pioneering the use of American folk songs in children's music education. Radicalized by the Depression, she spent much of the ensuing two decades working aggressively forsocial change with her husband and stepson, the folksinger Pete Seeger.This engrossing new biography emphasizes the choices Crawford Seeger made in her roles as composer, activist, teacher, wife and mother. The first woman to win a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship in music composition, Crawford Seeger nearly gave up writing music as the demands of family, politics,and the folk song movement intervened. It was only at the very end of her life, with cancer sapping her strength, that she returned to composing. Written with unique insight and compassion, this book offers the definitive treatment of a fascinating twentieth-century figure.\n\nSoul on Soul by Tammy L. Kernodle; Tammy Kernodle\n\nCall Number: B Williams K\n\nISBN: 1555536069\n\nPianist, composer, and arranger, Mary Lou Williams (1910-1981), was one of the most significant and influential artists in the history of jazz. A versatile musical genius who experimented with and mastered most of the emerging styles in jazz's evolution, Williams wrote and arranged for such greats as Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman, and she was friend, mentor, and teacher to the likes of Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, and Dizzy Gillespie. Yet throughout her prolific career of nearly six decades, she battled as an African American woman to achieve recognition, equality, and acceptance in the male-dominated world of jazz.Now Williams's artistic brilliance and lasting legacy are affirmed in this definitive volume, which masterfully interweaves biographical details with incisive commentary on her music, performances, and recordings. Setting Williams's intriguing story against the racial, social, cultural, and musical currents of her times, Tammy L. Kernodle draws on extensive interviews and meticulous research to chronicle the tragedies and triumphs of Williams's stormy life. Included are her struggles with racism, sexism, and age discrimination, and such personal misfortunes as recurrent bouts of poverty, turbulent marriages and love affairs, extreme loneliness, and a string of bad business decisions.Born to an impoverished, unmarried mother in Georgia, and raised in Pittsburgh, the self-taught Williams started performing publicly when she was six-years-old. By the age of twelve, the\"little piano girl\" was touring on the black vaudeville circuit. Kernodle follows Williams's harsh life on the road, her rise to fame in the 1930s as an arranger and performer for Andy Kirk's Kansas City swing band Twelve Clouds of Joy, her role as matriarch of the bebop movement, her solo career, her blossoming spirituality, and conversion to Roman Catholicism. In her later years, Williams wrote sacred jazz pieces that brought emotional healing to listeners, and worked tirelessly to help and rehabilitate addicted, down-and-out musicians. She was also strongly committed to advancing jazz composition and to educating others about the cultural roots of jazz.This striking portrait untangles the paradoxes of an exceptionally gifted pianist who defied the odds and endured hardships to create innovative music that inspired musicians and fans alike. It celebrates her persistent yet loving spirit, extraordinary talent, and enduring body of work.\n\nAmerican Composer Zenobia Powell Perry by Jeannie Gayle Pool\n\nCall Number: JME 09-346\n\nISBN: 9780810863767\n\nZenobia Powell Perry (1908-1993) was a composer whose life provides insight to a special time in the 1920s and '30s when black American composers were finally being recognized for their unique contributions to the country's music. Born in Boley, Oklahoma to a black father and a black Creek Indian mother, Zenobia was influenced by both black American and native American folklore, music, language, and poetry. In American Composer Zenobia Powell Perry: Race and Gender in the 20th Century, Jeannie Gayle Pool examines the life of this talented individual who faced tremendous challenges as a female, as an African American, and as a woman of mixed heritage. Based on interviews conducted by the author, as well as Perry's personal papers, correspondence, and scores, Pool provides a rich portrait of this unique composer. Pool also provides an analysis of Perry's musical style, a chronology, a complete list of works, and several appendixes. Raising many complex and unresolved issues related to American blacks with Native American heritage, Perry's life story bears witness to a century in which tremendous strides were made toward equality for all.\n\nAnother Side of Ethel Smyth by Caroline E. M. Stone (Editor)\n\nCall Number: JME 18-206\n\nISBN: 1849211671\n\nEthel Smyth was a prolific author, including volumes of autobiographical writing, and was herself the subject of biography. After a brief introduction to the family and social context of the letters, this volume therefore can focus on the relationship and exchange of ideas between 'ES' and Elizabeth Williamson, the grand-daughter of Ethel's eldest sister Mary Hunter. In part thanks to her great-aunt, Elizabeth's Edwardian childhood led not to marriage but to a degree, work at the University of London Observatory, and the freedom to continue her studies in classical Greek. In their correspondence the two women talk about books, theatre, travel, current affairs and personal philosophies, as well as friendships and family life with all their problems and rivalries and, of course, dogs. All against the backdrop of an interleaving aristocratic, political, academic, literary and business world. The letters themselves, clearly valued by Elizabeth, almost perished three times - including once after the editor of the collection had herself inherited them. This volume is a selection, with the bulk of the collection now in the Beinecke Library at Yale.\n\nChen Yi by Leta E. Miller; J. Michele Edwards\n\nCall Number: JME 21-74\n\nISBN: 0252085442\n\nChen Yi is the most prominent woman among the renowned group of new wave composers who came to the US from mainland China in the early 1980s. Known for her creative output and a distinctive merging of Chinese and Western influences, Chen built a musical language that references a breathtaking range of sources and crisscrosses geographical and musical borders without eradicating them. Leta E. Miller and J. Michele Edwards provide an accessible guide to the composer's background and her more than 150 works. Extensive interviews with Chen complement in-depth analyses of selected pieces from Chen's solos for Western or Chinese instruments, chamber works, choral and vocal pieces, and compositions scored for wind ensemble, chamber orchestra, or full orchestra. The authors highlight Chen's compositional strategies, her artistic elaborations, and the voice that links her earliest and most recent music. A concluding discussion addresses questions related to Chen's music and issues such as gender, ethnicity and nationality, transnationalism, border crossing, diaspora, exoticism, and identity.\n\nClara Schumann by Monica Steegmann\n\nCall Number: JMD 04-1081\n\nISBN: 1904341594\n\nClara Schumann had her debut as a solo-pianist in 1828 at barely the age of nine, but withdrew into the shadow of her husband, Robert, whom she married against her father's wishes. Her life, especially after his death, is also closely linked to that of Brahms. When Clara Schumann was just eighteen she realised that 'I would be unhappy if I were unable to practise my art forever'. She found after her husband Robert Schumann's death 'how necessary music is in my life - if I had to give it up I should soon perish'.\n\nFive Lives in Music by Cecelia Hopkins Porter\n\nCall Number: JME 12-1135\n\nISBN: 9780252037016\n\nRepresenting a historical cross-section of performance and training in Western music since the seventeenth century, Five Lives in Music brings to light the private and performance lives of five remarkable women musicians and composers. Elegantly guiding readers through the Thirty Years War in central Europe, elite courts in Germany, urban salons in Paris, Nazi control of Germany and Austria, and American musical life today, as well as personal experiences of marriage, motherhood, and widowhood, Cecelia Hopkins Porter provides valuable insights into the culture in which each woman was active. Porter begins with the Duchess Sophie-Elisabeth of Braunschweig-Lueneberg, a harpsichordist who also presided over seventeenth-century North German court music as an impresario. At the forefront of French Baroque composition, composer Elisabeth-Claude Jacquet de La Guerre bridged a widening cultural gap between the Versailles nobility and the urban bourgeoisie of Paris. A century later, Josephine Lang, a prodigiously talented pianist and dedicated composer, participated at various times in the German Romantic world of lieder through her important arts salon. Lastly, the twentieth century brought forth two exceptional women: Baroness Maria Bach, a composer and pianist of twentieth-century Vienna's upper bourgeoisie and its brilliant musical milieu in the era of Gustav Mahler, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg, and Erich Korngold; and Ann Schein, a brilliant and dauntless American piano prodigy whose career, ongoing today though only partially recognized, led her to study with the legendary virtuosos Arthur Rubinstein and Myra Hess. Mining musical autographs, unpublished letters and press reviews, interviews, and music archives in the United States and Europe, Porter probes each musician's social and economic status, her education and musical training, the cultural expectations within the traditions and restrictions of each woman's society, and other factors. Throughout the lively and focused portraits of these five women, Porter finds common threads, both personal and contextual, that extend to a larger discussion of the lives and careers of female composers and performers throughout centuries of music history.\n\nFrancesca Caccini at the Medici Court by Suzanne G. Cusick; Catharine R. Stimpson (Foreword by)\n\nCall Number: JMF 10-1444 [Text]\n\nISBN: 9780226132129\n\nA contemporary of Shakespeare and Monteverdi, and a colleague of Galileo and Artemisia Gentileschi at the Medici court, Francesca Caccini was a dominant musical figure there for thirty years. Dazzling listeners with the transformative power of her performances and the sparkling wit of the music she composed for more than a dozen court theatricals, Caccini is best remembered today as the first woman to have composed opera. Francesca Caccini at the Medici Court reveals for the first time how this multitalented composer established a fully professional musical career at a time when virtually no other women were able to achieve comparable success. Suzanne G. Cusick argues that Caccini's career depended on the usefulness of her talents to the political agenda of Grand Duchess Christine de Lorraine, Tuscany's de facto regent from 1606 to 1636. Drawing on Classical and feminist theory, Cusick shows how the music Caccini made for the Medici court sustained the culture that enabled Christine's power, thereby also supporting the sexual and political aims of its women. In bringing Caccini's surprising story so vividly to life, Cusick ultimately illuminates how music making functioned in early modern Italy as a significant medium for the circulation of power.\n\nIn Her Own Words by Jennifer Kelly\n\nCall Number: JNE 13-181\n\nISBN: 9780252037597\n\nThis collection of new interviews with twenty-five accomplished female composers substantially advances our knowledge of the work, experiences, compositional approaches, and musical intentions of a diverse group of creative individuals. With personal anecdotes and sometimes surprising intimacy and humor, these wide-ranging conversations represent the diversity of women composing music in the United States from the mid-twentieth century into the twenty-first. The composers work in a variety of genres including classical, jazz, multimedia, or collaborative forms for the stage, film, and video games. Their interviews illuminate questions about the status of women composers in America, the role of women in musical performance and education, the creative process and inspiration, the experiences and qualities that contemporary composers bring to their craft, and balancing creative and personal lives. Candidly sharing their experiences, advice, and views, these vibrant, thoughtful, and creative women open new perspectives on the prospects and possibilities of making music in a changing world.\n\nMarianna Martines by Irving Godt; John A. Rice\n\nCall Number: JME 10-1568\n\nISBN: 9781580463515\n\nMarianna Martines (1744-1813) was one of the most accomplished, prolific, and highly honored female musicians of the eighteenth century. She spent most of her life in a remarkable household that included celebrated librettist Pietro Metastasio, who supervised her education and remained a powerful and supportive mentor. She studied with the young Joseph Haydn, and Vienna knew her as a gifted, aristocratic singer and keyboard player who performed for the pleasure of the Empress Maria Theresa. The regular private concerts she held in her home attracted the presence and participation of some of Vienna's leading musicians; Mozart enjoyed playing keyboard duets with her. She composed prolifically and in a wide variety of genres, vocal and instrumental, writing church music, oratorios, Italian arias, sonatas, and concertos. Much of that music survives, and those who study it, perform it, and listen to it will be impressed today by its craftsmanship and beauty.This book, the first volume fully devoted to Martines, examines her life and compositional oeuvre. Based largely on eighteenth-century printed sources, archival documents, and letters [including several by Martines herself, most of them published here for the first time] the book presents a detailed picture of the small but fascinating world in which she lived and demonstrates the skillfulness and creativity with which she manipulated the conventions of the gallant style. Focusing on a limited number of representative works, and using many musical examples, it vividly conveys the nature and extent of her compositional achievementand encourages the future performance of her works.The late Irving Godt was Professor of Music at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. John A. Rice, independent scholar, is a member of the Akademie f√ºr Mozart-Forschungin Salzburg."
