        "text": "Amy Turk is a multi-genre harpist, composer, arranger and session artist from the UK. With special interests in percussion, video game and film scores, and popular music of all styles, Amy has created a unique career path through her presence online, pioneering compositions and arrangements for solo harp and ensembles.\n\nFor over a decade Amy's fascination with percussion has led her to push the boundaries of the harp's potential, following in the footsteps of modern acoustic guitarists like Andy Mckee and Jon Gomm. Using her percussion system, she has developed an approach which allows her to recreate the sound of an entire band on the harp, utilising the classic sounds of a drum set in addition to a spectrum of new and established extended techniques.\n\nUsing YouTube as her main platform Amy has created a worldwide audience for her music, responding to the demand for pop, rock, film and video game arrangements, and spearheading the transformation of the harp into a percussive instrument with her original compositions. As an arranger she has pushed to present the harp in as many genres as possible, with her most popular uploads spanning a full range of styles from the Disney Renaissance, The Legend of Zelda series, pop and rock classics such as Toto's Africa and Ellie Goulding's Love Me Like You Do, and her rendition of J.S. Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor BWV 565, which in addition to its 11M views on YouTube, has received radio play and online promotion from BBC Radio 3 and Classic FM, and was featured in the Oscar-nominated film Triangle of Sadness in 2022."
