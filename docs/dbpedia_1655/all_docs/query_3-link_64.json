While I am very excited and ready to put my “nose to the grindstone.” It’s also a bittersweet moment for me. These last three years in Jackson, TN have been very good to me. The Jackson Generals organization helped me grow professionally and personally. These past three years we’ve done great things. We’ve created great stories here. We’ve created lifelong memories. I’m very proud of the work we’ve accomplished here and the team is in great hands. Next year will be the greatest year yet for the Generals. That being said, Fredericksburg, I hope y’all are ready. 2020 is going to be HUGE. Let’s get it."
