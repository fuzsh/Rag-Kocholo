        "text": "NEW York is Film Noir City: as I move through it, I scout locations for my imaginary 1947 thriller. All I need is a little night -- plenty of that this time of year -- and the last six decades are gone.\n\nThe director of my imagination who wants to make the archetypal film noir of my imagination has endless miles to work with: whole swaths of Manhattan, especially the garment district and Wall Street, and much of downtown Brooklyn and Queens. The city is still filled with bars and restaurants that opened in the 1940's and early 50's, the years that bookend the classic film noir cycle.\n\nMy obsession with the movies of this period is in full flower these days because, on Tuesday, 20th Century Fox Home Video is set to release three especially good noirs on DVD: \"The Dark Corner\" (1946), \"Kiss of Death\" (1947) and \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" (1950). All are beautiful new prints and are accompanied by various extras and commentaries. \"Where the Sidewalk Ends\" is an especially big treat because, as far as I can tell, it was never officially released on video.\n\nAll three movies take place in New York City, and the city is a major character in each one. \"Kiss of Death\" trumpets its use of actual locations in the opening credits, while the other two splice studio work with second-unit exteriors shot around the city.\n\nTo watch all three back-to-back in one sitting is to hypnotically experience another New York. Not the actual metropolis of the late 1940's as you might see in a Ken Burns documentary, but a New York City that was probably as realistic then as the New York City portrayed in movies is today.\n\nIt is a proto-New York, a heightened New York, a super-New Yorky New York, a city of supreme alienation, overcrowded sidewalks, pitch-black menace, thick accents, way too many cigarettes, packed bars that always have one empty table, exaggerated street noise, and skyscrapers that exist solely to have characters pushed off them.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
