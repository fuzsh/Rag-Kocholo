        "text": "What movies from the 1940s still hold up?\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nWe've covered the silent film era, which was the start of movies and filmmaking being brought to the forefront for the first time in history. We've covered the \"Roaring Twenties\" and a 1930s era of films that coincidentally took place during the decade of The Great Depression (which lasted from 1929 to 1939). Now we arrived to the rockin' 1940s—a transcendental era of movie making that continues to provide the groundwork for the modern films of today. To understand the 1940s, you also have to understand where people were at from a mental and emotional standpoint (at least within the United States). The year 1940 marked the first after The Depression, and frankly, people didn't want to waste their money at the theater for movies that were just as depressing as what they previously been through the prior decade. Folks wanted escapism, storytelling, romance, and lust—much like what the end of the 1930s brought along with films such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) and Gone with the Wind (1939). Thus we enter the 40s. If you are looking to explore the era, here are the best 1940s movies to add to your watchlist.\n\nWhether its Jigsaw (1949) or mysterious thriller like The Lady Confesses (1945), we think these films will help introduce you to the incredible filmmaking, acting, and storytelling showcased during the decade.\n\nRELATED: Fashion On Film: The Impact of 1940s Style in Hollywood\n\n1. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nDirected by: Orson Welles\n\nStarring: Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Dorothy Comingore, Everett Sloane, William Alland, Agnes Moorehead\n\nRuntime: 1 hr 59 mins\n\nWe'll start with a little mystery that everybody seems to enjoy—1941's Citizen Kane. Directed by and starring Orson Welles, Citizen Kane sees Welles starring as a famed reporter who's life is now coming under direct observation by way of his own dying words. What you get in return is a deep dive into his complexities, affairs, scandals, and a mistress who's willing to expand on the elements of his life he hid from the public and those who supposedly knew him best. Considered one of Welles' best works as both a director and actor, Citizen Kane will keep you entertained from start to finish.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n2. Jigsaw (1949)\n\nDirected by: Fletcher Markell\n\nStarring: Franchot Tone, Jean Wallace, Marc Lawrence, Myron McCormick, Headley Rainnie, John Garfield\n\nRuntime: 1 hr 12 mins\n\nDebuting at the tail end of the 1940s, Jigsaw is the definition of a \"film noir\" as it pertains to its storyline, visuals, and directorial style. Helmed by Fletcher Markell, Jigsaw hones in on a patriotic hate group who send a woman (Wallace) to distract a district attorney (Tone) in the hopes that he's so enamored with his new love interest that he forgets to look their way. There is a plot twist here, and once you get wind of what is exactly, you can take a look at this very interesting 1949 review done by way of the New York Times to see the actual reaction from critics during that era.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n3. The Lady Confesses (1945)\n\nDirected by: Sam Newfield\n\nStarring: Mary Beth Hughes, Hugh Beaumont, Claudia Drake, Edmund MacDonald, Carol Andrews, Emmett Vogan\n\nRuntime: 1 hr 4 mins\n\nIf you really want a good mystery, check out 1945's The Lady Confesses, which is about as great of a \"whodunnit\" as they could of possibly put together in that era. The story? A man's estranged wife suddenly turns up after almost a decade to prevent him from marrying his new love, but somebody kills her. As a result, his fiancee goes on a mission to investigate not just to find out what happened, but to clear her name because obviously the prime suspect in a situation like that would be...her—except she really didn't do it. So who did? Was it the husband? Was it somebody else? Cue the haunting music.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n4. Casablanca (1942)\n\nDirected by: Michael Curtiz\n\nStarring: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Madeleine Lebeau\n\nRuntime: 1 hr 42 mins\n\nYou can only go but so long without mentioning Casablanca as it's regarded as a cinematic masterpiece that's one of the best films (check out Roger Ebert's 1996 review here) to ever be created. Humphrey Bogart stars as Casablanca nightclub owner Rick Blaine alongside Ingrid Bergman, who portrays his old love interest who's in town with her husband (Paul Henreid). The problem, is that the new flame of the ex is also kind of a...criminal on the run that needs help avoiding law enforcement, and the only person skilled enough to help him evade the cops is...Rick Blaine. Awkward without a doubt, but that's what makes it an interesting watch.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n5. Sullivan's Travels (1941)\n\nDirected by: Preston Sturges\n\nStarring: Preston Sturges, Joel McCrea, Veronica Lake, William Demarest, Eric Blore, Robert Greig\n\nRuntime: 90 mins\n\nHonestly, I could see Sullivan's Travels causing some outrage (or at the very least think pieces), and I can see why if we're keeping it real. Here's the storyline—a movie director (McCrea), does not believe he'll be able to write a great script until he's \"suffered.\" So what does he do? He sets out to create a life that he feels is \"suffering.\" How? By basically experiencing life as a homeless person. Tone deaf (especially in current times). Yes, there's no real way around it, but if you can get past that in particular, there is an interesting story underneath.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n6. Woman of the Year (1942)\n\nDirected by: George Stevens\n\nStarring: Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Fay Bainter, Dan Tobin, Reginald Owen, William Bendix\n\nRuntime: 1hr 54 mins\n\nStarring the real life love birds Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Woman of the Year is a masterclass film about two rival reporters, Tess Harding (Hepburn) and Sam Craig (Tracy) falling in love and eventually growing to resent each other. What makes Woman of the Year so interesting is that they both start out hating each other, only to eventually end up falling in love. They also kind of end hating each other again afterwards, which adds to the dynamic. Funny right?\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n7. Gaslight (1940)\n\nDirected by: Thorold Dickinson\n\nStarring: Anton Walbrook, Diana Wynyard, Frank Pettingell, Cathleen Cordell\n\nRuntime: 1hr 24 mins\n\nReleased in 1940 and directed by Thorold Dickinson, 1940's Gaslight tells the story of a young newlywed couple who moves into a house where the murder of a young woman had taken place twenty years earlier. What follows is suspicion, and a race against time. That's all we can say without giving away the entire plot, so let's cue the haunting music again.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n8. The Big Sleep (1946)\n\nDirected by: Howard Hawks\n\nStarring: Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall\n\nRuntime: 1 hrr 54 mins\n\nStarring two of the biggest actors of this era, Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, The Big Sleep is about a private investigator that gets hired to look into the gambling issue that a general’s young daughter has acquired. As he continues his investigation, he finds there’s much more to the story than initially meets his detective eye. Pro tip: Watch this on a rainy day. The vibes are immaculate.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n9. Gilda (1946)\n\nDirected by: Charles Vidor\n\nStarring: Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, George Macready\n\nRuntime: 1hr 50 mins\n\nSomething of an ensemble cast directed by Charles Vidor with notable names such as Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, and George Macready, Gilda is about a cheating gambler Johnny Farrell (Ford) who develops a partnership with casino owner Ballin Mundson (Macready), only to find that the casino owner’s wife is his ex (Hayworth). Honestly, movies don't get messy quite like this anymore, and they need to. Let's get some more relationship drama in the mix. Also, \"Put the Blame on Mame,\" is such a catchy tune.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n10. Dangerous Years (1947)\n\nDirected by: Arthur Pierson\n\nStarring: Billy Halop, Scotty Beckett, Harry Harvey Jr., Ann Todd, Anabel Shaw, Jerome Cowan\n\nRuntime: 1hr 2 mins\n\nIf it has the word dangerous in it, you know that there’s about to be a ton of drama on the way. Released in 1947 and featuring an all star cast that includes Billy Halop, Scotty Beckett, Harry Harvey Jr., Ann Todd, Anabel Shaw, Jerome Cowan and more, Dangerous Years is about a teenage on trial for murder who finds out that he’s more connected to the prosecutor than he ever thought. That connection? Gotta watch the movie for that people.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n11. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941)\n\nDirected by: Victor Fleming\n\nStarring: Spencer Tracy, Ingrid Berman, Lana Turner\n\nRuntime: 2hr 7 mins\n\nSpencer Tracy, Ingrid Berman, and Lana Turner is pretty great combination to have in a film as they were some of the biggest movie stars of their era. It's always cool to see earlier versions of classics that have been reworked from a modern standpoint, and Tracy took his turn with a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde film, taking on the roles of both Jekyll and Hyde. Seeing the contrast between his take on the two character is very interesting to watch we must say.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n12. Phantom of the Opera (1943)\n\nDirected by: Athur Lubin\n\nStarring: Claude Rains, Susanna Foster, Nelson Eddy, Jane Farrar, Walter O. Stahl, Edgar Barrier\n\nRuntime: 1hr 32 mins\n\nEver heard of Phantom of the Opera? It’s a pretty decent film if you ask us. A little on the scary/creepy side, but still really good. Obviously there’s been plenty of remakes since (including the 2004 film that most have already seen), but it wouldn’t hurt to check this version out as it has what the newer version lacks, a haunting score. Plus, as I said earlier, it's always cool to see the early renditions of classics that received a remake decades later.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n13. Children of Paradise (1945)\n\nDirected by: Marcel Carné\n\nStarring: Arletty, Jean-Louis Barrault, Pierre Brasseur, Marcel Herrand, Pierre Renoir\n\nRuntime: 2hr 43 mins\n\nOh you want to talk about messy romances? 1945's Children of Paradise focuses on an actress (Arletty) who has not one, not two, not three, but...four suitors that are in love with her at the same time (and she uses every single one of those relationships to her advantage). Hey, it's technically not her fault though. If monogamous relationships if what you are looking for, the monogamy agreement doesn't officially start until that relationship is officially official. That means the actress was free to date however many people she wanted until otherwise agreed upon. We know some of you will still probably find fault with her though. Oh well!\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n14. Black Narcissus (1947)\n\nDirected by: Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell\n\nStarring: Deborah Kerr, Kathleen Byron, David Farrar, Jean Simmons, Eddie Whaley Jr., Sabu\n\nRuntime: 1hr 40 mins\n\nIt would be interesting to see the general reaction to 1947's Black Narcissus in today's climate because it does have the potential to be controversial as the film is about a group of Anglican nuns sent to a mountain in the Himalayas where they are treated quite awful. That isn't the only controversial element, but perhaps the talking point that has the most potential to grind people's gear is the fact that one of the nuns has her celibacy questioned after she begins falling in love with a man. There's lots going on in this film needless to say.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n15. Rope (1948)\n\nDirected by: Alfred Hitchcock\n\nStarring: James Stewart, John Dall, Farley Granger, Joan Chandler, Dick Hogan, Cedric Hardwicke\n\nRuntime: 1hr 20mins\n\nIf you are a fan of Alfred Hitchcock, then you will probably get a kick out of 1948's Rope, which is praised for its innovative filming styles and techniques. A psychological thriller, two friends strangle a mutual “friend” (because somebody who kills you is literally not a friend), hide his body, and attempt to go with their merry little dinner party. Geesh. Cold blooded, but this is Hitchcock we’re talking about.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n16. Pinocchio (1940)\n\nDirected by: Norman Ferguson, T. Hee, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney, Hamilton Luske, Bill Roberts, Ben Sharpsteen\n\nStarring: Dickie Jones, Christian Rub, Mel Blanc\n\nRuntime: 1hr 28 mins\n\nAh. Mr. Pinocchio—the liar whose nose grows longer with every little lie he tells. The story of Pinocchio remains the same regardless of what era the story is being told in, but as is this case with every classic, it’s always fascinating to see how different filmmakers approached these movies depending on their individual styles and the respective decades these films were made in.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n17. Drunken Angel (1948)\n\nDirected by: Akira Kurosawa\n\nStarring: Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura, Chieko Nakakita, Noriko Sengoku, Michiyo Kogure, Eitarō Shindō\n\nRuntime: 1hr 38 mins\n\n1948's Drunken Angel is…different. What’s it about? A hothead doctor who becomes friends with a gangster patient that has Tuberculosis. There’s a lot more to the story here of course, but just that info alone tells you that you’re going to be in for an interesting ride (and you are). So it sit back and allow Akira Kurosawa to take you on a whirlwind journey.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PLEX\n\n18. Too Late for Tears (1949)\n\nDirected by: Byron Haskin\n\nStarring: Lizabeth Scott, Don DeFore, Dan Duryea\n\nRuntime: 1hr 39 mins\n\nWhat would you do if you stumbled upon a briefcase with $60k in cash? Obviously the person who owns the briefcase isn’t going to be okay with just letting their $60k go without trying to track it down. So what do you do? Do you give it back, or fight for money that isn’t yours? Well, the words used to describe Jane Palmer (Lizabeth Scott) is ”by any means necessary.” In other words she ain’t trying to give it back. You gotta see how this one plays out for sure.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n19. When Strangers Marry (1944)\n\nDirected by: William Castle\n\nStarring: Robert Mitchum, Kim Hunter, Dean Jagger\n\nRuntime: 1hr 7mins\n\nIf you are looking for a film that will have you taking a deep sigh all the way through, When Strangers Marry is the movie for you. Surely you can’t expect for everything to turn out great after marrying a stranger after just three dates, but that’s exactly what Millie (Kim Hunter) thinks is going to happen. Unfortunately for her she may have married a killer, but whatever floats her boat we guess.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON APPLE TV\n\n20. John Loves Mary (1949)\n\nDirected by: David Butler\n\nStarring: Ronald Regan, Jack Carson, Wayne Morris\n\nRuntime: 1hr 36 mins\n\nRonald Regan being an actor is not a lie or a myth. He was one, and you can watch John Loves Mary as proof that it happened. You had the story of a World War II soldier returning home to marry his girlfriend, but there’s a problem—the soldier got married to an immigrant to help his friend so the immigrant could get her papers and be free to marry him upon returning to the states. There’s another problem though—that same friend seemingly forgot that he did that and got married to someone else. How do you just ignore the fact the fact that your best friend marries somebody for you to achieve true love. What?? Once again…messy.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n21. Seven Days’ Leave (1942)\n\nDirected by: Tim Whelan\n\nStarring: Victor Mature, Lucille Ball, Harold Peary\n\nRuntime: 1hr 27 mins\n\nYou can always count on Lucille Ball for a hearty laugh, and she delivers in Seven Days’ Leave. To this day, not many possess that natural comedic skills and timing Ball had, and she was never corny, never looked/sounded like she was trying to be funny, and never overdid it. You’ll enjoy Seven Days’ Leave as a result of her comedic brilliance.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n22. We Dive at Dawn (1943)\n\nDirected by: Anthony Asquith\n\nStarring: John Mills, Louis Bradford, Ronald Millar\n\nRuntime: 1hr 38 mins\n\nWe ride at dawn…We Dive at Dawn…same difference right. I’ll be the first to tell you that I don’t like war movies—they just aren’t my cinematic cup of tea. However, I have watched We Dive at Dawn (the name caught my attention) and I’ll say I enjoyed it. It’s not much different plot wise from your average 1940s war film, but I like the visuals as far as seeing it in technicolor. The acting was great too. Give it a try. You might like it.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON YOUTUBE\n\n23. Booby Hatched (1944)\n\nDirected by: Frank Tashlin\n\nStarring: Sara Berner, Mel Blanc\n\nRuntime: 7m\n\nLet’s talk about cartoons for a second. Booby Hatched is a fun, funny, and not-so-funny seven minute animation from 1944. What’s fun and funny? Seeing the animation styles and techniques from the 1940s at play. What’s not? Well a duck (who’s the star of the show here), forgets about one of her kids. Granted she has a lot of them, but still—she kinda forgets about one of her kids and loses track of him. So now she’s gotta find her kid—Halle Berry style.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n24. Professor Tom (1948)\n\nDirected by: Joseph Barbera, William Hannah\n\nStarring: Diego Dames, William Hannah, Bob Laztny\n\nRuntime: 8 mins\n\nProfessor Tom—featuring a ticked off Tom (per usual) and a trouble making Jerry (per usual). There’s really nothing else that needs to be said here other than this is classic Tom and Jerry folks. Should you need some T and J suggestions, you can check out our best episode list here.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON APPLE TV\n\n25. Donald’s Dog Laundry (1940)\n\nDirected by: Jack King\n\nStarring: Lee Millar, Clarence Nash\n\nRuntime: 8 mins\n\nSometimes you forget some of these cartoons have been around for almost 100 years with so many of us growing up on the respective current versions for our generations. That said, if you want to see vintage 1940s Donald Duck as he and Pluto get into it when Donald decides he’s going to build an automated dog washer, Donald’s Dog Laundry is right up your alley.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON DISNEY+\n\n26. Tugboat Mickey (1940)\n\nDirected by: Clyde Geronimi\n\nStarring: Walt Disney, Clarence Nash, Danny Webb\n\nRuntime: 7 mins\n\nMickey’s been around forever and a day as well. If you love cartoons, then you’ve probably already got Disney+ because loving cartoons and loving Disney seems to go hand-in-hand. That means you’ll easily be able to watch how Mickey, Donald, and Goofy handle being tasked with saving a sinking ship in Tugboat Mickey. Interesting trio for the job, but apparently these folks had no other choice.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON DISNEY+\n\n27. Bambi (1942)\n\nDirected by: James Algar, Samuel Armstrong, David Hand\n\nStarring: Hardie Albright, Stan Alexander, Bobette Audrey\n\nRuntime: 1hr 9 mins\n\nAww. Bambi. I can’t sit here and say this will be different from anything else Bambi related that’s come out over the years, but what I can tell you is that there’s a certain innocence to the 1942 film that draws you in. The animation is not “perfect” by today's standards, it’s not super technical, it’s not 3D, nor is it futuristic—but that is what makes it beautiful. I know it sounds like a corny statement from a romcom, but it’s the truth.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n28. Melody Time (1948)\n\nDirected by: Clyde Geronimi, Wilfred Jackson, Jack Kinney\n\nStarring: Roy Rogers, Trigger, Dennis Day\n\nRuntime: 1hr 15 mins\n\nOkay, rounding out our cartoon segment of the 1940s is Melody Time, which I’m suggesting simply for the score/music involved. Composed by Roy Rogers, Ethel Smith and Frances Langford, within the beautiful music is a heartwarming story about two lovers that fall for each other during the winter season, and receive help from their “contemporaries” to make their relationship work. Sweet isn’t it?\n\nSTREAM NOW ON DISNEY+\n\n29. The Big Clock (1948)\n\nDirected by: John Farrow\n\nStarring: Ray Milland, Charles Laughton, Maureen O'Sullivan, Elsa Lanchaster, Dan Tobin\n\nRuntime: 1hr 35 mins\n\nFrom a sweet story all the way back to a thriller. Earl Janoith (Laughton) has had enough. He is a journalist being treated like crap by his demanding boss (Milliand), and he reaches his limit when said boss asks him to skip his…wait for it…honeymoon. He decides to get revenge with his boss’ mistress, with a plan to embarrass him…except he ends up dead. They didn’t do it, but all eyes are on the last two people he notably ticked off. Now they have to clear their names.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n30. Scarlet Street (1945)\n\nDirected by: Fritz Lang\n\nStarring: Edward G. Robinson, Joan Bennett, Dan Duryea, Rosalind Ivan\n\nRuntime: 1hr 43 mins\n\nNext up is Scarlet Street, which is actually quite sad. You see, a man having a midlife crisis (Robisnson) befriends a young stunning woman. While part of me does believe the man is interested in her romantically, at the same time I can’t quite tell if it’s romantic interest or simply loneliness. While obviously it’s assumed that everybody wants to date a pretty young lady, sometimes people (especially when they are going through something like a midlife crisis) just want a “friend.” Whatever the case, he winds up getting taken advantage of not only because this woman has a fiancé, but also because her lover try to swindle him out of money. You end up rooting for the underdog here.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n31. Double Indemnity (1944)\n\nDirected by: Billy Wilder\n\nStarring: Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G. Robinson\n\nRuntime: 1hr 47 min\n\n1944's Double Indemnity is interesting too. Directed by Billy Wilder, there’s only so much here that can be said without spoiling, but love and lust sometimes makes people do crazy things, and a crazy thing is what a Los Angeles insurance agent does when he lets a woman he’s in love talk him into a fraud and murder scheme. Cue the haunting music.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n32. Oliver Twist (1948)\n\nDirected by: David Lean\n\nStarring: Robert Newton, Alec Guinness, Kay Walsh\n\nRuntime: 1hr 45 mins\n\nOliver Twist is a classic novel by Charles Dickens, and in 1948 the film received an adaptation on to the big screen. A movie that pulls at your heartstrings, Oliver Twist will have you smiling and/or crying (or perhaps a little bit of both). Watch this on a Saturday afternoon to get the weekend vibes right.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n33. Beauty and the Beast (1946)\n\nDirected by: Jean Cocteau\n\nStarring: Jean Marais, Josette Day, Mila Parely\n\nRuntime: 1hr 33 mins\n\nLong before we ever got the 1991 animated version of Beauty and the Beast, we got this 1946 black and white film that’s just as endearing. You know the story of Belle and the Beast who develop an unconventional relationship so we’ll spare you the time of giving you a plot line you already know, but if you are fan of the story, we think you’ll like this.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n34. The Red Shoes (1948)\n\nDirected by: Emeric Pressburger, Michael Powell\n\nStarring: Emeric Pressburger, Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook\n\nRuntime: 2hr 13 mins\n\nThe Red Shoes is a film that kind of went a different direction than some of the other movies being made during the time as it’s about a young woman torn between pursuing a professional career as a ballerina, and the man she loves. Who does she choose? Does she have to make a choice in the first place? Does it workout in the end? Watch and see.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n35. The Philadelphia Story (1940)\n\nDirected by: George Cukor\n\nStarring: Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, James Stewart, Virginia Weidler\n\nRuntime: 1hr 52 mins\n\nI’m going to refer to this 1940 review by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times because I think it’s interesting to see what people were saying when these films actually came out. “For this present, which really comes via Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, has just about everything that a blue-chip comedy should have—a witty, romantic script derived by Donald Ogden Stewart out of Philip Barry's successful play; the flavor of high-society elegance, in which the patrons invariably luxuriate, and a splendid cast of performers headed by Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant.\"\n\n\"If it doesn't play out this year and well along into next they should turn the Music Hall into a shooting gallery.” Note that this was around the time that the media was beginning to change their perception of Hepburn from “box office poison” to a box office generator. It’s neat to see the tide turning in this article.\"\n\nSTREAM NOW ON PRIME\n\n36. The Million Dollar Cat (1944)\n\nDirected by: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera\n\nStarring: William Hanna, Jerry Manna\n\nRuntime: 7 mins\n\nSneaking another cartoon in here because I totally forgot about The Million Dollar Cat! Here, Mr. Tom gets gifted a whopping one million dollars from his aunt (seems like Tom is living the good life), but (and this is a big but), he can’t harm any other living species…including the very annoying Jerry. So while Tom gets the million, does he really win in the end seeing as though he’s being tormented every millisecond?\n\nSTREAM NOW ON APPLE TV\n\n37. Blues in the Night (1941)\n\nDirected by: Anatole Litvak\n\nStarring: Ella Kazan, Priscilla Lane, Richard Wolf, Jack Carlson\n\nRuntime: 1hr 32 mins\n\nNot everybody is a fan of musicals and that’s fair, but if you enjoy classic jazz musicals, then you’ll probably like Blues in the Night, which tells the story of a band finally getting their big break, but falling prey to the things that usually break up band and musicians once money and fame come to the mix. You’ll also enjoy the incredible jazz music in this film.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON APPLE TV\n\n38. Nevada (1944)\n\nDirected by: Edward Killy\n\nStarring: Robert Mitcham, Richard Martin\n\nRuntime: 1hr 5 mins\n\nI will admit that I am biased towards black and white westerns. If you are wondering why, it’s because I think imagery is really important to western films, and black and white films just don’t capture that from a visual standpoint fully. In my opinion, westerns were at their best in the 70s and 80s. Rant aside, I do think that Nevada is a compelling film as it’s about Jim Lacy (Mitchum) being falsely accused of murder and having to prove his innocence.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON YOUTUBE\n\n38.

Things Happen At Night (1948)\n\nDirected by: Francis Searle\n\nStarring: Gordon Harker, Alfred Drayton\n\nRuntime: 1hr 19 mins\n\nCrazy things do indeed happen at night, and that includes a poltergeist giving a British family man bloody hell, leading to the man contacting an insurance investigator for help. We’d be freaked out if we were dealing with a poltergeist as well, so we can’t fault the man for trying to get help ASAP.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON YOUTUBE\n\n40. Laura (1944)\n\nDirected by: Otto Preminger\n\nStarring: Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb\n\nRuntime: 1hr 28 mins\n\nLaura. 1944. I will always fight for Gene Tierney because I don’t believe her story has been told properly (and maybe I’ll tell it myself one day). There’s a lot of tragedy within her life…she’s one of those individuals that just never seemed to catch a break, but within that was resilience. And that resilience is what led to her making some beautiful films—Laura included. Tierney doesn’t get nearly enough credit for her film contributions, beauty, and style…so if you want to show her art some support, please give Laura a watch.\n\nSTREAM NOW ON YOUTUBE\n\nRELATED: Fashion on Film: How 1950s Fashion Shaped the Movies of the Era\n\nDid you like this article?\n\nLiked\n\nDisliked"
