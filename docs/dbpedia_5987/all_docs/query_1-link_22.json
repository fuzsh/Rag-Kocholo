These four-letter codes are possible results of a 94-question (give or take) personality assessment called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)—a psychological instrument that’s been around for more than 75 years.\n\nBut what exactly do the Myers-Briggs personality types mean, and what can you do once you discover yours? Read on to learn about this widely-used personality test and how the results may help guide life and career decisions.\n\nFEATURED PARTNER OFFER\n\nPartner Offers feature brands who paid Forbes Health to appear at the top of our list.

The test helps people assess their personality using four specific dichotomies, or scales: introversion-extraversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving.\n\nThe MBTI was first developed in the 1940s by Isabel Briggs Myers and her mother Katharine Cook Briggs, and it’s based on psychologist Carl Jung’s theory of psychological types. The purpose of the test is to “make the theory of psychological types described by C.G. Jung understandable and useful in people’s lives,” according to the Myers & Briggs Foundation. In other words, the MTBI is intended to give clarity and understanding of a person’s personality type in a practical way.\n\nMyers and Briggs first tested friends and family to collect data, workshop the questions and determine how to weigh each answer. In 1951, more than 5,000 medical students across 45 medical schools used the MBTI to help determine which areas of medicine in which they would specialize. Since then, the questionnaire has been used to help people both in and outside the workplace learn more about their personality and the personalities of the people around them.\n\nThere are 16 personality types in the MBTI, all of which include a letter for each side of the four scales the person aligns with most. Letters always follow the same order, and scales are abbreviated using the following letters:\n\nIntroversion-extraversion is represented by I or E\n\nSensing-intuition is represented by S or N\n\nThinking-feeling is represented by T or F\n\nJudging-perceiving is represented by J or P\n\nEach of the scales operates as a spectrum. Although a personality may not fall perfectly into one type, the four-letter type code represents the side of each of the four scales a person most closely fits.\n\nFor example, a person who leans toward introversion, intuition, thinking and judging would be considered personality type INTJ. Naturally, there are 15 other personality permutations across these four spectrums.\n\nNo personality type is superior to the others. Each one simply gives a clearer indication of a person’s likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nIs the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Valid?\n\n“Despite the MBTI’s brand name appeal, personality researchers have considerable skepticism concerning its actual validity compared to more conventional personality tests,” says Romeo Vitelli, Ph.D., a private practice psychologist and psychology consultant at Mom Loves Best. While scientific journals have published thousands of studies using the MBTI over the decades, some researchers question the MBTI’s objectivity, the questionnaire format and the reliability of the test scores. That said, the MBTI remains one of the most widely-recognized personality tests globally for its simplicity, ease of use and longstanding history as a workplace tool, he says.\n\nHow Does the MBTI Test Work?\n\nThe MBTI test is a self-reported personality assessment. During the test, an individual answers approximately 94 questions that evaluate preference toward four different dichotomies: Introversion-extroversion, sensing-intuition, thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving. Depending on their responses, the MBTI classifies an individual into one of 16 different personality types based on their self-reported preferences and behaviors.\n\nWhat Is the Myers-Briggs Personality Test Used for?\n\nMany businesses, including a large number of Fortune 500 companies, turn to the MBTI for guidance worldwide. The test has been used as a tool for team-building, conflict prevention and leadership development purposes. The MBTI may also help people determine how compatible they are with one another, romantically or platonically, says Vitelli.\n\nDiscover Your Personality Within Minutes\n\nThe Personality Lab's Personality Explorer Test provides you with detailed, unique information that can help you plan your life and work more successfully.\n\nMyers-Briggs Personality Types\n\nDepending on how an individual aligns with the personality preference pairs, they may be classified into one of 16 different personality types. Consider the following traits of each personality type, according to the Myers & Briggs Foundation.\n\nISTJ: Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging\n\nTend to be more quiet and serious\n\nRealistic, responsible and practical\n\nEarns success by being dependable and thorough\n\nEnjoys order and organization\n\nISFJ: Introversion, Sensing, Feeling, Judging\n\nQuiet and conscientious\n\nCommitted to meeting obligations\n\nFriendly, loyal and considerate of others’ feelings\n\nValues order and harmony in their home and work environments\n\nINFJ: Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judging\n\nConcerned with serving the common good\n\nInsightful and eager to learn others’ motivations\n\nTends to seek meaning and connection in relationships and ideas\n\nCommitted to their values\n\nINTJ: Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging\n\nOriginal thinkers who are motivated to achieve their goals\n\nIdentifies patterns in events to determine an explanatory perspective\n\nSkeptical and independent\n\nMaintains high standards for themselves and others\n\nISTP: Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving\n\nQuiet, sensitive and kind\n\nCommitted to their values and people who are important to them\n\nEnjoys being alone and working at their own pace\n\nConflict-averse\n\nISFP: Introversion, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving\n\nTolerant, flexible and logical\n\nQuick to find workable solutions for problems\n\nInterested in cause and effect\n\nValues efficiency\n\nINFP: Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving\n\nIdealistic, curious and adaptable\n\nLoyal to their values and people who are important to them\n\nEager to understand others and help them reach their full potential\n\nSeeks to live a life that aligns with their values\n\nINTP: Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving\n\nTheoretical, analytical and skeptical\n\nInterested in developing logical explanations for things that interest them\n\nValues ideas over social interaction\n\nProblem solvers\n\nESTP: Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving\n\nSpontaneous, lives in the moment\n\nPrefer action when problem-solving over theoretical explanations\n\nEnjoys aesthetics and material comfort\n\nLearns by doing\n\nESFP: Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Perceiving\n\nEnjoys working with others\n\nSpontaneous and easily adapts to new people and environments\n\nRealistic, outgoing and accepting\n\nLearns best while trying a new skill with other people\n\nENFP: Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Perceiving\n\nWarm, enthusiastic and imaginative\n\nDesires affirmation from others\n\nEager to offer appreciation and support\n\nSpontaneous, flexible, able to improvise\n\nENTP: Extraversion, Intuition, Thinking, Perceiving\n\nSmart, outspoken and stimulating\n\nResourceful when solving problems\n\nGood at reading other people\n\nFinds routine boring, often finds new ways of doing things\n\nESTJ: Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging\n\nPractical, decisive and organized\n\nValues achieving results in the most efficient way possible\n\nQuick and forceful in implementing plans and decisions\n\nMaintains clear and logical standards for themselves and others\n\nESFJ: Extraversion, Sensing, Feeling, Judging\n\nCooperative, conscientious and kind\n\nValues harmony in their environment\n\nDesires appreciation for their contributions\n\nEnjoys working with others to complete tasks efficiently and accurately\n\nENFJ: Extraversion, Intuition, Feeling, Judging\n\nEmpathetic, responsible and loyal\n\nAttuned to others’ emotions, needs and motivations\n\nOften acts as a catalyst for individual and community growth\n\nResponsive to praise and criticism\n\nENTJ: Extraversion, Intuition, Thinking, Judging\n\nEnjoys long-term planning and goal-setting\n\nOften well-informed, well-read and eager to share their knowledge with others\n\nSkilled problem-solvers\n\nReadily assumes leadership, forceful in sharing their ideas\n\nYou Deserve To Be Happy\n\nAsking for help takes strength. BetterHelp can match you with a professional, licensed and vetted therapist from any device.\n\nHow to Find Out Your MBTI Personality Type\n\nTo determine your MBTI personality type, you’ll need to complete the MBTI questionnaire. The assessment can be taken online via the Myers & Briggs Foundation’s website. There are no right or wrong answers, according to the company, and you’ll choose the answers that best fit you. You’ll receive your results in an MBTI Profile Report, which may be delivered virtually or in printed form.\n\nHow to Take the Myers-Briggs Personality Test\n\nIf you’d like to take the MBTI, you can visit MBTIonline.com or schedule an appointment with an MBTI-certified practitioner or an organization (such as a school or workplace) that administers the test. The assessment takes roughly 45 minutes to complete, according to MBTIonline.\n\nIf you choose to take the MBTI, Vitelli recommends being honest, recognizing the tool’s possible reliability and validity limitations, and not letting your four-letter code rule your existence. “That means accepting that your scores may change over time,” he adds. “And the test shouldn’t be used for making long-term decisions about your life or career.”\n\nThink of the MBTI as a fluid self-awareness tool as opposed to a definitive measure of your personality. You may also choose to take it more than once to see if and how your four-letter personality type code changes over time.\n\nIs the Myers-Briggs Test Free?\n\nTaking the official MBTI assessment costs $59.95, although other online resources offer unofficial versions of the test for free. For those who opt to take the official assessment, a self-guided feedback system helps you understand and verify the accuracy of your results, according to the Myers & Briggs Foundation.\n\nThe Four Myers-Briggs Preference Pairs\n\nTo determine a person’s four-letter personality code, the MBTI asks questions to help determine which sides of the four scales they most closely fit.\n\nExtraversion-Introversion\n\nThis scale helps a person understand where they put their attention and how they get their energy. “Extraversion refers to the tendency to be outgoing and action-oriented while enjoying social interactions and feeling more energized as a result. Introversion lies on the opposite end of the scale and reflects the tendency to be more thought-oriented and withdrawn,” says Vitelli. However, introversion doesn’t always mean the same thing as being shy. Introversion can also indicate someone who enjoys “living in their head,” reflecting on ideas, thoughts or memories. These types may enjoy company in small groups rather than large crowds and are often comfortable being alone.\n\nOther common traits of extraverts include:\n\nFeeling comfortable in groups\n\nBeing popular or having a large friend group\n\nNot thinking something over before taking action\n\nCommon traits of introverts include:\n\nAvoiding action by overthinking and/or contemplating\n\nFeeling removed from the outside world\n\nSensing-Intuition\n\nThis scale examines how people take in information from the world around them. “People who prefer sensing tend to be more reality-based and depend on their own senses and what they can learn from hands-on experience,” says Vitelli. “Intuition [type] is more likely to depend on their impressions of the world around them and is more likely to rely on inner feelings to make conclusions.”\n\nCommon traits of sensing personalities include:\n\nRemembering accurate snapshots of events\n\nBeing a fact-based problem solver\n\nA preference for a realistic “bottom line” approach\n\nValuing experience more than words and/or symbols\n\nOverlooking potential possibilities due to overanalyzing facts\n\nCommon traits of intuition personalities include:\n\n“Reading between the lines”\n\nAn interest in new, different experiences\n\nBouncing between possible scenarios\n\nValuing impressions, metaphors and symbols more than lived experience\n\nA difficulty bringing possibilities to reality\n\nThinking-Feeling\n\nWith this scale, the idea is to understand whether a person focuses more on information as it relates to their five senses or on patterns and interpretations. “People scoring highly on thinking tend to be more logic-based and dependent on facts and objective information,” Vitelli adds. “Feeling individuals are more likely to depend on emotions to conclude people and events.”\n\nThinking personalities commonly display as:\n\nEnjoying fields where logic is key\n\nNoticing errors or inconsistencies\n\nSearching for logical solutions to problems\n\nA desire to be fair and make decisions based on logic\n\nBelieving in direct truth-telling\n\nNot always accounting for people’s emotions or experiences\n\nBeing task oriented and appearing indifferent or uncaring\n\nFeeling personalities typically present as:\n\nEnjoying fields involving people or communications\n\nWanting harmony and becoming nervous around conflict\n\nHaving concern for others\n\nBeing compassionate and making emotion-based decisions\n\nValuing people’s emotions and believing in delivering news with tact\n\nNot always communicating difficult truths directly\n\nAppearing indirect, idealistic, or emotional\n\nJudging-Perceiving\n\nThis scale assesses whether a person prefers more structure in their life or if they’re open to a more flexible lifestyle. “People high on judging are more rigid and inflexible and prefer more structured environments,” says Vitelli. “On the other hand, people high on perceiving tend to be more flexible, open-minded and spontaneous.”\n\nCommon displays of judging personalities may include:\n\nEnjoying when things are decided\n\nBeing task oriented\n\nEnjoying to-do lists\n\nHaving a “work before play” attitude\n\nPlanning ahead to avoid rushing or procrastination\n\nBeing highly goal oriented, but sometimes missing information due to narrow focus\n\nPerceiving personalities can appear as:\n\nBeing open-minded\n\nBeing casual or not one to make plans\n\nMixing work with play\n\nBeing productive in bursts of energy\n\nReceiving added stimulation from pressure or deadlines\n\nHaving difficulty making decisions\n\nLearn More About Your Personality Type\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow long does the MBTI personality test take?\n\nThe official MBTI assessment takes approximately 45 minutes to complete, according to the Myers-Briggs Company.\n\nCan my personality type change over time?\n\nWhile your personality may evolve over time, your personality type likely will not change, according to the Myers-Briggs Company. Your personality type is based on whether you naturally prefer introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling and judging or perceiving. The Myers-Briggs framework argues that these four preferences remain stable over time.\n\nWhat's the rarest MBTI personality?\n\nThe rarest MBTI personality type is INFJ, making up approximately 1% to 3% of the U.S. population.\n\nIs the Myers-Briggs test worth taking?\n\nThe MBTI personality assessment may be worth taking to discover insights into your likes, dislikes, strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhere can I learn more about my personality type?\n\nYou can learn more about your personality type on the Myers & Briggs Foundation’s website. The results from your self-report assessment may provide deeper insight into your personality type."
