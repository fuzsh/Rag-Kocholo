        "text": "Dear Reader:\n\nHere we are, the final week of our thrilling Japanese cinema series. From the youth culture of the 1950s (Crazed Fruit) to the nuance of white-collar corporate culture of the 1990s (Shall We Dance), these analyses are coming to an end with . . . JAPANESE FILM NOIR! To prepare for an examination of one of the most influential and subversive genres in film history, today, I will be providing a primer of sorts – the what’s what of film noir.\n\nBEFORE we get neck deep in this seductive genre, keep some key things in mind: 1) All the postwar dread of American film noir is translated a bit differently when your country is not the “victor, ”2) just as American films exploded into Japan (in order to influence the Sun Tribe) so it did for film noir, and 3) some intrinsic factors in shaping American film noir – such as the Production Code, highly-developed star and studio system – are absent.\n\nFirst, the significant, complex and fundamental question which requires investigation is what exactly is film noir? Is it a style, a genre, or a cinematic movement with clear historical boundaries? The period or movement of classical film noir began in the United States tentatively in the early-1940s, proliferated in the postwar period, and ended in the late-1950s. The genre’s postwar historical context and filmic influences are central to this analysis, and warrants further discussion.\n\nFilm noir is at once a style, a genre, a cinematic movement, and a combination of one, two, or all three. As a movement, the specific birth-date of the stylistic and generic trend is unclear, could it go back to Laura (1944), Journey into Fear (1943), This Gun for Hire (1942), The Maltese Falcon (1941), or Stranger on the Third Floor (1940), all of which have generic and stylistic traits in common and yet predate the end of World War II?\n\nConsidered to be an invention of Nino Frank, the term film noir [meaning: dark/black film] was unofficially coined in 1946, when the French film critic examined a newer trend in American film following the sudden influx of Hollywood films after the French liberation of World War II. These films, according to Frank, were darker in tone, more violent and emotional (as well as misogynistic), and did not suit the conventional crime or detective genre. Furthermore, they were less plot-driven, and more focused on character motivation and reaction, on “only the uncertain psychology” of the world and the persons therein. Fundamentally, the “film noir” did not shy away from the “gross cruelties which actually exist,” and their purposeless “past concealment.”\n\nThe American “melting pot” concept finds a grain of truth in relation to the influences, development, and evolution of film noir – an international dish with a national flavor – which borrows from German Expressionism, French Poetic Realism, and Italian Neorealism, in combination with the American artistic traditions and trends of the 1930s, hard-boiled crime/detective novels, the social realism/problem films, crime and gangster films (popularized by Warner Bros.), the Universal horror films (in turn inspired by German Expressionism), and the proliferating population of B movies (Pettey & Palmer 2014: 2,16, 38, 58).\n\nFilm noir acquired all these seemingly disparate stylistic and generic components from different nations and national cinemas (with their own cultural, artistic, and historical context) and melded them into a sophisticated, distinct, and yet adaptable structure, which not only thrived in a restricted, regulated system but managed to express cultural anxieties and subvert the dominant ideology in simultaneously implicit and perceptible ways.\n\nAs a film style, the objective of the noir’s modes is to create tension and convey a sense of dread that permeates the environment and expresses character interiority. This mode is found in the non-Classical manipulation of the formal elements of lighting, cinematography, sound, and mise-en-scène (Place & Peterson 1974):\n\nUse of low-key lighting and high contrast (chiaroscuro)\n\nDisorienting cinematographic style utilizing low-, high-, wide-, and Dutch angles\n\nDisruption of linear and non-invasive storytelling through employment of flashback and voice-over\n\nJuxtaposition of expressionism and realism via the dynamic inclusion of on-location shooting (especially at night)\n\nAs a genre, it is a structure of expectations regarding narrative, character, setting, tone, and also, style. The narrative will follow a protagonist of the working or middle class who makes an “immoral” choice which will create conflict, disrupt the mundanity of their lives, and inevitably, spell their doom, wreaking havoc on their souls until the fatalistic conclusion.\n\nProminent character types include the hardened cop, the morally-gray private detective, and the sultry but deadly femme fatale, as well as the general accompaniment of criminals, the underworld, and criminality. However, after the first few years of the genre’s popularity, the character of the ordinary person committing an extraordinary sin will emerge. The setting is usually urban in nature, focuses on the present, and uses the nightly cityscape to convey themes of isolation and alienation in contemporary society (Prakash 2010, 6-7). The tone is pessimistic, fatalistic, cynical, and at its darkest, nihilistic, expressing a dread, hopelessness, and anxiety in connection to the ideological crisis of the postwar period.\n\nMoreover, visual, aural, and symbolic motifs pervade: Venetian blinds (the slats providing lines of shadow and light), emblems of modernity (cars, trains, cities), the sensual and improvisational musical genre of the era, jazz, and the use of shadow and mirrors to capture a morality and subjectivity in a reflective, existential fury. Furthermore, film noir possesses a subdued yet steaming sexuality and tendency towards violence, physical and psychical. Most importantly, the narrative, characters, setting, tone, and style all serve to question and critique – in the subtle way only pop culture can achieve – the institutions and ideological structures of America (or in this week’s case, Japan) at that specific moment, of:\n\npublic sphere: authority, law and order\n\nprivate sphere: morality and ethics\n\ndomestic sphere: the home, family, and marriage\n\nand how their personality and function have evolved during such international and national, and collective and individual trauma\n\nThrough this dissemination of popular culture, film noir stood in stylistic and post-Classical generic relief, and in ideological subversion, communicating the shadows of the world via the darkness of the theater.\n\nWorks Cited"
