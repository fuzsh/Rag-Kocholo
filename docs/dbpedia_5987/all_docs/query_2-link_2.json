        "text": "Compared to the original classics within the genre, Film Noir has evolved over the years in many aspects. One way in which evolution has occurred is the morals behind the protagonist. For example, ‘Double Indemnity’ (Wilde, 1944) portrays a plot with themes of greed and self-gain as the protagonist is given a darker side, as he helps the antagonist. The protagonist (Walter) uses his skills in law and insurance, to help the wife of one of his clients (Phyllis Dietrichson) receive double the amount in part of a ‘double indemnity’ claim. The protagonist side to this character is found in the helping of Phyllis, but his antagonist-side is found in his plot to kill Mr Dietrichson, as wished by Phyllis. This contrast in the morality of the main character was evident in numerous films in the 1940s, largely due to the state of the world at the time. The Second World War took place between 1939 and 1945, and this caused morale worldwide to fall immediately. On top of this, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 also had a big impact. With weak and poor economies behind the majority of countries around the world, the quality of film sets in America also had to be lowered. The level of pessimism had obviously increased, and this led to the leading characters, in films produced at the time, containing a darker side.\n\nAnother change in the genre has been the style. The unique and ironic chiaroscuro lighting of ‘classic’ Film Noir (1940s & 1950s) was used to add depth to each character and to induce enigma upon the audience. This was done using low-key lighting, monotone drones, iconic props and costumes, jazz and blues music, violence, and detectives. Having said this, as the years progressed, so did the genre. Filming and editing technology also developed over this time, giving films a greater quality and improving the overall film experience. After the ‘classic’ period of the genre, a new ‘Post-Noir sub-genre evolved, called ‘Neo-Noir’, translated as ‘New-Black’. This style of film consisted of a better quality and the typical black and white effect became less common. One of the first motion pictures in colour was ‘The Show of Shows’ (Adolfi, 1929), so colour was around from as early as this time, but the costs of producing films in colour were too high for the depressing times of the 1940s and 1950s. Instead, film directors and producers decided to make films of the ‘crime’ theme in black and white. However, after this phase and the world’s economy began to return, morale changed. Pessimism had now become optimism, therefore meaning dark and depressing films were no longer required. One way of increasing the morality of the film industry, particularly of Film Noir, was to add colour. An example of this is ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ (Penn, 1967), a coloured crime film with similar themes to the classic genre. Colour changed films’ style, adding more of a realistic tone. It must be noted, however, that not all ‘Neo-Noir’ films were in colour, as some, including present day films, were in black and other dark colours. An example of a modern day ‘Neo Noir’ film is ‘The Dark Knight Rises’ (Nolan, 2012). Despite this being a superhero movie, there are some very strong elements of ‘Film Noir’, including lighting, settings (e.g. the city), characters, themes and the narrative."
