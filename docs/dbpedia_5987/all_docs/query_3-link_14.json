        "text": "Decade of the Gregorian calendar (1940–1949)\n\n\"'40s\" redirects here. For decades comprising years 40–49 of other centuries, see List of decades.\n\nThe 1940s (pronounced \"nineteen-forties\" and commonly abbreviated as \"the '40s\" or \"the Forties\") was a decade that began on January 1, 1940, and ended on December 31, 1949.\n\nMost of World War II took place in the first half of the decade, which had a profound effect on most countries and people in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. The consequences of the war lingered well into the second half of the decade, with a war-weary Europe divided between the jostling spheres of influence of the Western world and the Soviet Union, leading to the beginning of the Cold War. To some degree internal and external tensions in the post-war era were managed by new institutions, including the United Nations, the welfare state, and the Bretton Woods system, facilitating the post–World War II economic expansion, which lasted well into the 1970s. The conditions of the post-war world encouraged decolonization and the emergence of new states and governments, with India, Pakistan, Israel, Vietnam, and others declaring independence, although rarely without bloodshed. The decade also witnessed the early beginnings of new technologies (such as computers, nuclear power, and jet propulsion), often first developed in tandem with the war effort, and later adapted and improved upon in the post-war era.\n\nThe world population increased from about 2.25 to 2.5 billion over the course of the decade, with about 850 million births and 600 million deaths in total.\n\nPolitics and wars\n\n[edit]\n\nWars\n\n[edit]\n\nWorld War II (1939–1945)\n\nNazi Germany invades Poland, Denmark, Norway, Benelux, and the French Third Republic from 1939 to 1941.\n\nSoviet Union invades Poland, Finland, occupies Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania and Romanian region of Bessarabia from 1939 to 1941.\n\nGermany faces the United Kingdom in the Battle of Britain (1940).

The Walt Disney Studios released the animated feature films Pinocchio (1940), Dumbo (1941), Fantasia (1940), and Bambi (1942).\n\nAlthough the 1940s was a decade dominated by World War II, important and noteworthy films about a wide variety of subjects were made during that era. Hollywood was instrumental in producing dozens of classic films during the 1940s, several of which were about the war and some are on most lists of all-time great films. European cinema survived although obviously curtailed during wartime and yet many films of high quality were made in the United Kingdom, France, Italy, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in Europe. The cinema of Japan also survived. Akira Kurosawa and other directors managed to produce significant films during the 1940s.\n\nPolish filmmakers in Great Britain created anti-nazi color film Calling Mr. Smith (1943) about current nazi crimes in occupied Europe during the war and about lies of nazi propaganda.[6]\n\nFilm Noir, a film style that incorporated crime dramas with dark images, became largely prevalent during the decade. Films such as The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep are considered classics and helped launch the careers of legendary actors such as Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner. The genre has been widely copied since its initial inception.\n\nIn France during the war the tour de force Children of Paradise directed by Marcel Carné (1945), was shot in Nazi occupied Paris.[7][8][9] Memorable films from post-war England include David Lean's Great Expectations (1946) and Oliver Twist (1948), Carol Reed's Odd Man Out (1947) and The Third Man (1949), and Powell and Pressburger's A Matter of Life and Death (1946), Black Narcissus (1946) and The Red Shoes (1948), Laurence Olivier's Hamlet, the first non-American film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture and Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949) directed by Robert Hamer. Italian neorealism of the 1940s produced poignant movies made in post-war Italy. Roma, città aperta directed by Roberto Rossellini (1945), Sciuscià directed by Vittorio De Sica (1946), Paisà directed by Roberto Rossellini (1946), La terra trema directed by Luchino Visconti (1948), The Bicycle Thief directed by Vittorio De Sica (1948), and Bitter Rice directed by Giuseppe De Santis (1949), are some well-known examples.\n\nIn Japanese cinema, The 47 Ronin is a 1941 black and white two-part Japanese film directed by Kenji Mizoguchi. The Men Who Tread on the Tiger's Tail (1945), and the post-war Drunken Angel (1948), and Stray Dog (1949), directed by Akira Kurosawa are considered important early works leading to his first masterpieces of the 1950s. Drunken Angel (1948), marked the beginning of the successful collaboration between Kurosawa and actor Toshiro Mifune that lasted until 1965.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: 1940s in music\n\nBing Crosby was the best selling pop artist of the 1940s. Crosby was the leading figure of the crooner sound as well as its most iconic, defining artist. By the 1940s, he was an entertainment superstar who mastered all of the major media formats of the day, movies, radio, and recorded music.\n\nThe most popular music style during the 1940s was swing, which prevailed during World War II. In the later periods of the 1940s, less swing was prominent and crooners like Frank Sinatra, along with genres such as bebop and the earliest traces of rock and roll, were the prevalent genre.\n\nLiterature\n\n[edit]\n\nFor Whom the Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway in 1940.\n\nThe Myth of Sisyphus by Albert Camus in 1942.\n\nThe Stranger by Albert Camus in 1942.\n\nThe Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in 1943.\n\nAnti-Semite and Jew by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1943.\n\nThe Fountainhead by Ayn Rand in 1943.\n\nNo Exit by Jean-Paul Sartre in 1944.\n\nPippi Longstocking by Astrid Lindgren in 1945.\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank in 1947.\n\nDeath of a Salesman by Arthur Miller in 1949.\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell in 1949.\n\nThe Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams in 1944.\n\nFashion\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause fashion items and fabrics were rationed due to World War II, fashion became more utilitarian. Women's fashion started including suits, which were feminized with straight knee-length skirts and accessories. There were challenges imposed by shortages in rayon, nylon, wool, leather, rubber, metal (for snaps, buckles, and embellishments), and even the amount of fabric that could be used in any one garment.[citation needed] After the fall of France in 1940, Hollywood drove fashion in the United States almost entirely, with the exception of a few trends coming from wartorn London in 1944 and 1945, as America's own rationing hit full force. The idea of function seemed to overtake fashion, if only for a few short months until the end of the war. Fabrics shifted dramatically as rationing and wartime shortages controlled import items such as silk and furs.[citation needed] Floral prints dominated the early 1940s, with the mid-to-late 1940s also seeing what is sometimes referred to as \"atomic prints\" or geometric patterns and shapes. In response to the war effort, patriotic nautical themes and dark greens and khakis dominating the color palettes, as trousers and wedges slowly replaced the dresses and more traditional heels due to shortages in stockings and gasoline. The most common characteristics of this fashion were the straight skirt, pleats, front fullness, squared shoulders with v-necks or high necks, slim sleeves and the most favorited necklines were sailor, mandarin and scalloped.\n\n[10]\n\nPeople\n\n[edit]\n\nMilitary leaders\n\n[edit]\n\nDwight D.

The 1940 and 1944 Olympic Games were cancelled because of World War II. During World War II in the United States Heavyweight Boxing Champion Joe Louis and numerous stars and performers from American baseball and other sports served in the armed forces until the end of the war. Among the many baseball players (including well known stars) who served during World War II were Moe Berg, Joe DiMaggio, Bob Feller, Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial (in 1945), Warren Spahn, and Ted Williams. They like many others sacrificed their personal and valuable career time for the benefit and well-being of the rest of society. The Summer Olympics were resumed in 1948 in London and the Winter games were held that year in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\n\nIn 1947, Wataru Misaka of the New York Knicks became the first person of color to play in modern professional basketball, just months after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in Major League Baseball for the Brooklyn Dodgers.[11]\n\nBaseball\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the early 1940s World War II had an enormous impact on Major League Baseball as many players including many of the most successful stars joined the war effort. After the war many players returned to their teams, while the major event of the second half of the 1940s was the 1945 signing of Jackie Robinson to a players contract by Branch Rickey the general manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers. Signing Robinson opened the door to the integration of Major League Baseball finally putting an end to the professional discrimination that had characterized the sport since the 19th century.\n\nRoy Campanella\n\nJoe DiMaggio\n\nBill Dickey\n\nLarry Doby\n\nBob Feller\n\nJosh Gibson\n\nHank Greenberg\n\nMonte Irvin\n\nBuck Leonard\n\nJohnny Mize\n\nStan Musial\n\nSatchel Paige\n\nBranch Rickey\n\nJackie Robinson\n\nTed Williams\n\nBoxing\n\n[edit]\n\nDuring the mid-1930s and throughout the years leading up to the 1940s Joe Louis was an enormously popular Heavyweight boxer. In 1936, he lost an important 12 round fight (his first loss) to the German boxer Max Schmeling and he vowed to meet Schmeling once again in the ring. Louis' comeback bout against Schmeling became an international symbol of the struggle between the US and democracy against Nazism and Fascism. When on June 22, 1938, Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first few seconds of the first round during their rematch at Yankee Stadium, his sensational comeback victory riveted the entire nation. Louis enlisted in the U.S. Army on January 10, 1942, in response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Louis' cultural impact was felt well outside the ring. He is widely regarded as the first African American to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II.[12]\n\nBuddy Baer\n\nEzzard Charles\n\nBilly Conn\n\nRocky Graziano\n\nJoe Louis\n\nSugar Ray Robinson\n\nMax Schmeling\n\nJersey Joe Walcott\n\nTony Zale\n\nTrack and Field\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\n1940s portal\n\nList of decades\n\n1940s in television\n\n1940s in literature\n\nGreatest Generation (the remaining members of that generation came of age in the first half of the decade to serve in WW II).\n\nSilent Generation (the older members of that demographic had matured in the second half of this decade).\n\nTimeline\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following articles contain brief timelines listing the most prominent events of the decade.\n\n1940 • 1941 • 1942 • 1943 • 1944 • 1945 • 1946 • 1947 • 1948 • 1949\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nBuchanan, Andrew. \"Globalizing the Second World War,\" Past and Present no. 258 (February 2023): 246-281. online; also see online review\n\nLewis, Thomas Tandy, ed.
