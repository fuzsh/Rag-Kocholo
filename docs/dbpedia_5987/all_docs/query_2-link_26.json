        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe Film Noir movement was a series of films generally agreed to have begun with the release of The Maltese Falcon in 1941 and ended with A Touch of Evil in 1958. The term ‘film noir was derived from a French term, meaning ‘Dark Movie’. It’s creative influences primarily stem from a mixture of inspirations from the 1920s, including French Poetic Realism and German Expressionism, as well as the Hollywood Gangster movies of the 30s. However, film noir is better known as a movement, acting as a cinematic response to the varying socio-economic and political issues surrounding the Western world at the time. This dissertation will introduce the origins and inspirations of film noir, while also examining its core traits and boil down the essential aspects of the sub-genre. Once we have an apt understanding of the series, I will move on to discuss its spiritual successor: neo-noir, in chapter 2. Here, I will explore how neo-noir has carried the noir sensibility into the 21st century, and what has facilitated its survival on the silver-screen for so long. In chapter 3, I will posit the theory that we will soon see a resurgence in the popularity of neo-noir films and the noir style as a whole. I will do this by discussing the many resemblances and similarities between the western society of 2020, and the western society of the 1940s that gave birth to the movement.\n\nChapter 1 — Defining Film Noir…\n\nThese films arose from a post- World War II (WW2) America, in which people had seen the violent capabilities of humanity in full effect, with many countries destroyed or capitulated, and many loved ones lost. Alongside this, there was an ever-growing sense of fear and paranoia across the country in the build-up to the Cold War, with the ideas of McCarthyism and red scares being a pervasive fear within American population. As Hordnes puts it, “…the American people were given an insight into the cruel capabilities of humans (i.e. concentration camps) and were given the knowledge of the annihilation powers of their new weapon — the nuclear warheads — at the same time.” (Hordnes, 2012) This atmosphere is very much reflected in the film noirs of the time. Themes of corruption, moral ambiguity, distrust, alienation, paranoia and violence were all very common. However, it can be difficult to define what constitutes a typical film noir, with many scholars debating what constitutes a traditional film noir.\n\nIt is undeniable that the disillusionment brought about by the end of WW2 helped spark a new realist movement that reflected the mood of the global population, and paved the way for the films that would go on to be known as ‘noir’. The movement began to take shape at the end of the war when Hollywood no longer needed to “…produce Allied propaganda abroad and promote patriotism at home”. America had grown fatigued by the constant glamorisation of their culture and the ensuing patriotism that followed it. Instead, they had a desire for a more honest, harsh view of America that hadn’t been seen in films for the past twenty years. (Schrader 1972) Films such as Ride the Pink Horse, The Blue Dahlia, Dead Reckoning all featured servicemen returning home from war to find the partner dead or with another man. This post-war mood gave way to a global resurgence in the realism movement. This meant less focus on the melodramas surrounding the upper-class, and brought it down to more relatable grounds, such as focusing on everyday people with a lot of moral grey area. This was much more universally appealing to audiences and brought film noir to where “it more properly belonged, in the streets with everyday people.” (Schrader 1972)\n\nAnother significant contribution to cultivating the film noir style was the increasing influence of German Expressionism in Hollywood. Hollywood received a great number of German expatriates in the twenties and thirties, with many filmmakers and set-technicians integrating themselves into the American film industry over the years. (Schrader 1972) Germans are known as “masters of the chiaroscuro patterns” (Schrader, 1972) that are found across a plethora of film noirs, as well as the expressionist lighting style which gave film noir its menacing look. Many of the most prominent noir directors were German or Eastern European, such as Billy Wilder, Franz Waxman, John Alton and many more.\n\nThe traditional ‘hard-boiled’ detective fiction of the 1930s also produced a wealth of inspiration and influence for the film noir movement. The 1930’s depression had worn down the American public, with prohibition highlighting the countries distaste for its governments overbearing rules. Organised crime thrived in this society, with prohibition giving way to a surge in criminal activity and general lawlessness. It was during this time, that writers such as Raymond Chandler, Ernest Hemingway, and James M. Cain gained popularity and success with their works. The characters of these written works are resonates with that of a traditional film noir protagonist. We often follow a detective, or P.I. type, as they manoeuvre their way through a world of crime and corruption — not a balanced hero, but a flawed man “teetering on the brink of degeneracy.” (Baker, 2019). We can see many similarities with film noir as a whole, with many famous hard-boiled detective works being adapted into film noirs. Strangers on a Train (1951), The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981), and most notably, Double Indemnity, are examples of hardboiled adaptations, with Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain both working on the screenplay for the film. The popularity of hardboiled fiction had proven that audiences were interested in seeing more realistic stories set in a grounded, harsh environment. These novels and pulps enabled filmmakers to make their own creations within the new, distorted, morally bankrupt world. As Raymond Chandler puts it, “It’s not a very fragrant world, but it’s the world you live in…” (Chandler, 1950)\n\nThe complicated history between censorship and film noir led to several interesting developments and changes during the movement which forced filmmakers to alter their original works. This often led to interesting and unexpected results throughout the original run of noirs. In 1930, the Motion Picture Distribution of America, led by Will Hays, founded the Hays Motion Picture Production Code which discouraged all themes related to violence, sex, and illicit or illegal activities. (Hays Code, 1930) Gangster films and film noirs were two series that suffered in particular, during this regime. The code limited and restricted the extent to which movies could depict illegal or immoral activities, and it made it much harder for filmmakers to cultivate the style and tropes most commonly attributed to film noirs. The ‘Compensating Moral Values’ clause is one example of this, in which any characters that feature in a film who openly defies or breaks the law must receive justice and punishment by the end. No crime could go unpunished by the end of the story, regardless if the character is a protagonist, romantic interest, or a traditional villain. The list of restrictions, alterations, and out-right bans was extensive. A few examples included Hitchcock having to shoot multiple endings of his noir film Suspicion (1941), as well as the alteration of the original protagonist from The Blue Dahlia, where the main character was changed from the more controversial background of a murderer, to a former policeman and house detective. Popular hardboiled fiction writers such as James M. Cain and Raymond Chandler had their works censored or banned completely, with their respective novels, The Postman Only Rings Twice and Double Indemnity being banned for years before their eventual progression onto the silver screen. (Beisen, 2015, p.6)\n\nHowever, with the advent of WW2, cinematic restrictions began to ease as the government pushed for production of allied propaganda, which required more explicit and violent themes in order to depict an image of wartime. It was during this time, that film noirs began to thrive. This new period allowed it so that Double Indemnity was finally produced for the big screen, becoming a Hollywood hit in 1944. The success of this film would go on to become a definitive turning point in the ongoing censorship battles and allowed for films such as The Postman Always Rings Twice, to finally be produced — A film that had been previously shelved for over ten years due to breaches in censorship rulings — Suddenly, all the explicit themes and graphic violence became a scandalous point of intrigue for moviegoers. Double Indemnity was the result of the combined efforts of hardboiled fiction writers Chandler & Cain, as well as the directorial and story efforts of Billy Wilder, an Austrian filmmaker. The combined creative efforts of post-war realism, hardboiled fiction and German Expressionism, gave birth to what would later be referred to as ‘The definitive film noir’, with Empire Magazine critic Rob Fraser calling it “Film noir at its finest” and “a template for the genre” (Fraser, 2000). Guardian critic Paul Howlett calls it “a textbook noir.” (Howlett, 2011) Telegraph writer Mark Lee puts it best, claiming “Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity.” (Lee, 2015) The film follows smug insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) as he is seduced by the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwick) into murdering her husband. The film is filled with hardboiled language in its dialogue, “They say most native Californians come from Iowa,” and “I killed him for money and a woman — and I didn’t get the money and I didn’t get the woman. Pretty isn’t it?” (Double Indemnity, 1944) The dialogue is filled with bleak and blunt statements about the world and its characters, yet somehow maintains a sense of romanticism about it. It follows the story of a doomed protagonist recounting the events of the film to the audience via narration, carrying an impending sense of dread that the protagonist will inevitably get caught, and depicts the distrustful nature of sordid relationships between men and women. As we can see, Double Indemnity is wrought with film noir tropes from start to finish, making it clear why it had such a mass appeal to the cinemagoing audience of the time who were just now acquiring a strong taste for film noir.\n\nThe success of this film was a statement that the controversial and previously taboo content of these writers and filmmakers was now a thing to be desired when making a film. The added controversy and forbidden nature of these films only made for good publicity and added to the already-rising popularity of the movement. In the next ten years, the restrictions and limitations enforced by the Hays Production Code would ease, leading to their eventual end in 1968, where the film ratings system took over in their place, meaning filmmakers and writers would have even more creative freedom to produce more films like Double Indemnity, giving film noir a promising future.\n\nThe ‘femme fatale’ archetypal character is a prevalent trope of many film noirs and is a good example of how the movement reflected the feelings of society at the time. Femme fatale, or ‘fatal woman’ in English can be defined as “a woman who is very attractive in a mysterious way, usually leading men into dangerous and compromising situations causing their destruction” (Ross, 2018). Femme fatales are the result of the post-war change in the balance of power between genders. In his book, Neo-Noir: Contemporary Film Noir from Chinatown to The Dark Knight, Keesey states that many physically and psychologically wounded male veterans return home to find women had grown financial and sexual independence after joining work-force, claiming “men found such women alluring and frightening.” (Keesey, 2010 p.10) It’s easy to see how this concept came to manifest in the form of characters such as Phyllis Dietrichson (in Double Indemnity (1944) and Madeleine Elster in Vertigo (1958). Both characters are examples of attractive, mysterious women who lure earnest men into a world of crime and even murder. Often, the character is not one of a simple distressed damsel, but instead utilises her sexuality to seduce and manipulate men into falling into a life of crime to further their own interests. Place explains how women “derive power, not weakness, from their sexuality.” (Place, P.35) Though often, the character may end up a victim of her own artificial feelings for the protagonist, causing a lustful and controversial mess for the main characters. However, in an interview I conducted with film critic, Anna Smith, she proposes that the idea of the femme fatale can be “both empowering and problematic.” She claims that, The idea of a woman using her sexual appeal to win over men can feel reductive, but with the femme fatale, it’s usually combined with a quick thinking, clever character, so a positive role model in some senses.” (Smith, 2020). Femme fatales are self-conflicting by their very nature, often ambiguous and hard to define. We can see how the character archetype may be tonally consistent with film noirs. This is just one example of the socio-economic climate infiltrating film noir’s tropes and themes. A film could express certain post-war fears just from the simple fact they featured a femme fatale.\n\nCorruption and moral ambiguity are characteristics that dominate the story of many classic film noirs. According to Film Noir Reader, “It is the presence of crime which gives film noir its most constant characteristic.” (Borde & Chaumeton, 1995) Roles of authority, such as a soldier, fireman or Police officer, would traditionally be portrayed as heroic in Hollywood.\n\nNevertheless, film noir depicted the police a very different role, as Borde and Chaumeton go on to say, “If police are featured, they are rotten… sometimes even the murderers themselves… at very minimum, they let themselves get sucked into the criminal mechanism.” (Borde & Chaumeton, 1995) The corrupt inspector in The Asphalt Jungle is a good example of this; Even normal upstanding citizens often delve into a life of crime and lose their perceived innocence in film noirs. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) from Double Indemnity is an upstanding citizen until he is seduced into an insurance conspiracy and murder by Ms. Dietrichson. Morality is more ambigious and less valued in the genre of film noir. Instead of cowboys or superheroes, it becomes uncertain who the audience are supposed to be routing for. “The integral protagonist… has disappeared from film noir and given way to a crowd of sanctified killers…” This sense of ambiguity is not only expressed through situation and the femme fatale, but also the protagonist. “the ambiguous protagonist… is often enough masochistic… one who makes his own trouble, who may throw himself into peril neither for the sake of justice nor from avarice but simply out of morbid curiosity.” (Borde & Chaumeton, 1995 p.22) This is all a result of the disillusioned society in which America found itself in during the time. Joseph McCarthy had begun to convince Americans that communist spies had infiltrated every level of Western civil society. And the idea of the happy nuclear family had been tarnished by the number of families destroyed by the death of a father or son in World-War II, with even normal families experiencing an increase in divorce rates (Fogarty, 2017) Schrader expands on this in his essay Notes on Film Noir “the disillusionment many soldier, small businessmen and housewife/factory employees felt in returning to peacetime economy was directly mirrored in the sordidness of the urban crime film.” (Schrader, 1972) A general feeling of existential angst and alienation had emerged from the loss of so many lives in the war, and we can see how it translated into cinema in the form of morally ambiguous, corrupt characters. Film noirs also often exhibit a pattern of common traits in terms of production and composition. Perhaps the best summation of the traditional look of a film noir comes from Higham and Greenberg, who describe “…shadow upon shadow upon shadow… every shot in glistening low-key, so that rain always glittered across window or windscreens like quicksilver, furs shone with a faint halo, faces were barred deeply with those shadows that usually symbolized some imprisonment of body or soul.” (Greenberg & Higham) This is rather accurate, with distinct patterns such as spider webs entrapping the hero, along with “angle-down shots and claustrophobic framings; distorting mirrors and unbalanced compositions; and flashbacks and voiceover narration…” (Keesey, 2010, p.11) This was all somewhat off-centre from the traditional Hollywood filming style of the time. High-key lighting was “the dominant lighting technique… by the early forties” with faster camera movements, and attractive sets being norm of the industry around such time (Place & Peterson, 1974, p.65). Film noir captured a sense of alienation and entrapment through these restrictive patterns, creepy soundtrack and ominous lighting. Most notable was its structure; very often in film noirs we are retold the story from the beginning by a doomed narrator who has already fallen victim to the events of the story. This adds a sense of inevitably and dread, an assurance that our characters do not smoothly resolves their issues and walk into the sunset happily ever after. Though in film noirs, “a sense of dread persists until the final images”. There is no relief until the film finishes. Double Indemnity, Sunset Boulevard (1950) and Rebecca (1940) are all examples of this use of narration, with perhaps the most relevant example being Memento (2000) in which the neonoir spiritual successor uses the manipulation of structure to tell the entire story in reverse. These techniques are all used for a specific aim — confusing the viewers and making them question the story and its sensibilities. The entire composition the films are designed for “disorientating the spectator,” as Place & Peterson put it, “The moviegoer is accustomed to certain conventions, logical development… clear distinction between good and evil… welldefined motives… beautiful heroine and an honest hero.” (Place & Peterson) Film noir would provide no comfort where audiences sort it, and this accurately depicted the growing sense of doom felt among the movie going audience of the time with the build-up to nuclear warfare and the ever-growing presence of the bomb. It became harder to tell who was good and bad with paranoia spreading about soviet spies. Lines between good and evil were not so easily drawn as they once were before the war, and before the United States was building weapons of mass destruction to fight their enemy, with many smaller communist countries already being exploited by the US.\n\nIn this shot from Double Indemnity, we can see many traditional elements of Film Noir in play. We have the contrast of light and dark shadows from the apartment at the doorway, while the hero is staring aimlessly at the mysterious, attractive women standing in his doorway. Even the doorway itself is narrow and cramped, filling the centre third of the frame. Framing is often used in shots such as these to convey a sense of a character being trapped, which in the case of Barbara Dietrichson, is very much true. Not only has she been trapped in a miserable marriage, but is now becoming entangled in a murderous scheme which will inevitably end badly.\n\nAbove are two more clear examples of composition in film noir. We have perplexing, distorted images meant to disorientate the viewer, along with chiaroscuro contrasts, shadow patterns and tight framings to add a sense of entrapment. Fig. 2 evokes a clear sense of alienation, with Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth) in fig. 3 appearing a giant compared to the tiny man, through use of manipulation of reflection and camera. All of these listed above are elements that all encompass the traditional ‘film noir’, yet ironically, the most defining aspect of the genre is its lack of definition. As Wheeler Winston Dixon puts it, “Most definitions of noir films are, it seems to me, excessively narrow.” (Dixon) We may have investigated the recurring themes and tropes found in many movies that spanned across the film noir era, but it is important to look more deeply at the core nature of film noir. According to Hillier and Phillips, who also claim that “Film noir is as much about a state of mind as a single set of stylistic signs.” (Hillier & Phillips) And Keesey even goes on to argue that the genre itself is “characterised by blurred boundaries and hybrid genres.” (Keesey, 2010) This is to say that the genre itself can very easily dip into the classifications of other genres. I will explain this further with the case of neo-noir later on, as this is where we see the hybridisation of the genre truly start to take effect. Nevertheless, we see a mixture of genres in many classic film noirs. Vertigo explores a controversial and complex romance between its two main characters. The Asphalt Jungle follows a bank robbery, whereas Sunset Boulevard gives an insight to the film industry, and Rebecca explores the gothic-romance genre. Each of these films puts a darker twist with a less linear composition in order to create what is now referred to as ‘film noir’ and is often why the movement is credited more as a ‘style’ of film, rather than genre.\n\nChapter II — The Spirit Of Noir…\n\nNow that we understand some of the core elements of film noir, we can examine its spiritual successor, known as ‘Neo-Noir’, and how the genre has evolved in order to survive on the big screen. Neo-Noir can be defined as “any film coming after the classic noir period that contains noir themes and noir sensibility.” (Conrad, 2005, p.2) Many prominent filmmakers were inspired by the themes of film noir following the end of the film noir series. This resulted in the emergence of neo-noir, which carries the essence of traditional classic noirs, however, differs in very important ways that have arguably allowed the new collection films to live on as a permanent genre of film, as opposed to being considered a ‘style’ or ‘sub-genre’ like classic film noir. The spirit of noir lives on most prominently in this genre, and I will go on to discuss how this pervasive genre helped the essence of film noir to survive through decades of Hollywood cinema.\n\nMany neo-noirs, when broken down to their core themes and style, can adhere to the traditional noir motifs, however, their differences are numerous and significant. One major way in which neo-noir differed from its predecessor was that filmmakers were more conscious of the genre they were working within. As Conrad explains in The Philosophy of Neo-Noir, “the term film noir was employed only retroactively…filmmakers of the classic period didn’t have access to that expression and couldn’t have understood or grasped entirely the meaning or shape of the movement to which they were contributing.” (Conrad) Whereas in the 40s and 50s, film noir was only known by a variety of different terms, such as: ‘crime stories’, ‘suspense pictures’, ‘psychological thrillers’ and ‘melodramas’. (Keesey, 2010, p.10) This self-awareness of genre allows filmmakers to better encapsulate the various themes of noir, while also allowing themselves to step beyond the original sensibilities of the sub-genre. Films such as Taxi Driver (1976) and Reservoir Dogs (1992) are immensely popular to this day, known for addressing contemporary societal issues of their time and pushing the genre forward and allowing it to evolve. This genre spans from every ‘noir’ film between the 60s all the way to present day, with a much broader inclusion of theme and character. Whereas most original film noirs where set roughly around the same time with similar themes and motif, neo-noirs have spread out into sub-genres and continued to address the ever-changing issues of society throughout each of the decades since their release.\n\nAdditionally, neo-noirs had the benefit of creative freedom outside of any production code authority, as oppose to classic film noir. Conrad explains “because of abandonment of government oversight, and censorship, and the introduction of the ratings code, neo-noir filmmakers can get away with a great deal more than their classic noir predecessors.” (Conrad, 2005) This meant filmmakers could be a lot more explicit and liberal in terms of their material and were better able to convey the themes of violence, alienation, paranoia without any limitations or alterations. This newfound creative freedom, combined with an appreciation for what came before, is one of the most significant contributing factors that gave rise to the success of early neo-noir. American playwright and screenwriter for House of Games (1978), David Mamet, claimed “I am very well acquainted with the genre… and I love it. I tried to be true.” When writing the neo-noir. This new wave of inspired filmmakers and writers were discovering new ways to integrate the noir sensibility into their works, while also adjusting them for the contemporary context.\n\nAdapting story to relevant and pervasive social issues is one key cause for the maintained popularity and survival of neo-noir. Film noir is adaptive, adjusting to the current mood of its society as it develops. The same is true of neo-noir. Schrader posits that “as a filmmaker you look for rips and tears in the social fabric that can be addressed metaphorically.” (Schrader, 1972) We can look at films such as Chinatown (1974) and The Manchurian Candidate (1962) as examples of this. Chinatown follows private investigator Jake Gites (Jack Nicholson) as he attempts to uncover a huge conspiracy involving the Los Angeles Water Department. The film has an obvious resonance with the Watergate scandal that occurred two years prior, with the distrust of people in positions of governing authority embodied in the films main antagonist, Noah Cross (John Huston). Not only guilty of raping his own daughter, Cross is one of the most powerful men in Los Angeles, and exploits his control of the water tanks for self-profit. This film was released long after the end of the initial noir movement, and yet it re-establishes the same tropes within a different America, though still a struggling one.\n\nAnother example of this is John Frankenheimer’s The Manchurian Candidate, a noir film about soldiers returning from the Korean war after being brainwashed by communists. When discussing the film, Frankenheimer explained that “I wanted to do a picture that showed how ludicrous McCarthy-style far-right politics are and how dangerous the far-left is also.” We can see the change in emphasis from post-war era societal issues to a deeper focus on issues surrounding the Cold War. Interestingly, the film was remade in 2004 by Jonathan Demme. this film, the original context of the Korean war is updated to the Gulf war. Keesey discusses the differences in the two films, stating “The first Manchurian Candidate was a satire on rabid right-wing fears of vast community conspiracy… By contrast, this film is serious about… the multinational corporations who profit from war.” (Keesey, 2010) The Bush/Cheney administration was well known for the fortunes amassed during the Iraq war at the time. In the 2013, Dick Cheney’s subsidiary, KBR, has been estimated to have earned roughly forty-billion dollars in federal contracts stemming from the war. (Fifield, 2013) This is just one example of corruption in government and corporations, and perfectly illustrates how neo-noir bares the core traits of its predecessor, by being adaptive to the ever-changing world of the time.\n\nNeo-noir has survived throughout the history of cinema not only by adapting to changing social issues, but also by adapting its genre. Hybrid genre was a concept somewhat explored in classic film noir; however, it wasn’t until the rise of neo-noir that a multitude of sub-genres began to develop out of it. “Film noir is many forms and variations of a sensibility that alters and shifts according to culture, place and time.” (Hillier & Phillips) Whereas traditional noirs were categorised with more general terms such as ‘psychological thrillers’ or ‘crime stories’, neonoir is parent to a vast array of noir genre blends. The most famous example of this is Blade Runner (1982), often referred to as a ‘techno noir’. As Keesey explains, “The increasing ability of corporations to use the media as a way of manipulating what we desire as consumers — and even what we believe to be real — has fed the paranoia and pessimism of such techno-noirs as Blade Runner, The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, and demonlover” (Keesey, 2010). From our brief retrospective into film noir, we can appreciate how the popularity of a genre can also be affected by the socio-economic issues of the society at the time. Neo-noir is no exception. Other popular sub-genres include ‘white noir’ and ‘country noir’ to delineate between the locale and setting of the story. Comedy noirs, such as The Nice Guys (2016) and Inherent Vice (2014) have received a lot of positive critical reception over the years. Sci-fi and superhero noirs are also becoming much more prominent in the 21st Century. Films such as Captain America: Winter Soldier explore the world of spies and espionage as the morally rigid protagonist is forced to question his purpose and motivations upon the discovery that a secret Nazi organisation has infiltrated America on all levels of society and government. The film also deals with a compromising government programme that allows access to people’s private information and location, similar to the Patriot Act, which I will discuss further later on. Neonoir filmmakers are constantly adding new elements to noir, while maintaining the core themes consistent to most films of the old sub-genre. Film critic Mark Bould aptly points out “each additional film noir rethinks, reconstructs and refabricates the genre.” (Bould, 2005) This allows filmmakers and audiences to return to noir regularly with a fresh perspective each time and is undoubtedly a significant factor that has been responsible for the survival of the film noir sensibilities and the neo-noir genre.\n\nThe growing influence of noir in popular Hollywood mainstream media is also largely responsible for the survival of neo-noir throughout the decades. While the superhero genre is one of the most popular and highest-grossing genres in the current filmic climate, there is perhaps no greater cinematic pillar of popular culture than Star Wars. In Ron Howard’s Solo: A Star Wars Story, we can see a huge noir influence on the entire tone and style of the film, massively diverging from original Star Wars source material unlike any of the franchises’ predecessors. The film is arguably a mixture of sci-fi, western, and neo-noir, nevertheless, the noir themes are potent and palpable throughout the entirety of the film. In his post, Elements of Film Noir in ‘Solo: A Star Wars Story’, film reviewer Christian Høkaas examines the noir tropes of the blockbuster, claiming that “The war scenes are gritty, dark and colourless. The docking station is filled with fog with only the light coming from small bulbs on the ground. Low-key lighting in many places of the movie.” (Høkaas, 2018) The majority of planets featured in the film consist of dark tones, contrasting shadows, smoke and steam emanating in the streets. These are all classic production techniques employed in film noir, as we have previously discussed.\n\nIn the figures above, we can see a clear resemblance to the classic shooting style of film noir. Low-key lighting, chiaroscuro patterns, and stylised blocking, all add to a visual motif that evokes a sense of entrapment for our characters, emphasising its noir style.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008) is a perfect example of how the many aspects of neo-noir and cinema can culminate into a film that not only helps keep the spirit of noir alive, but also allows it to thrive in a modern context. This film’s success comes not only as a result of the creative efforts by the talented team lead by Christopher Nolan’s vision, but also because of its near-perfect adaptation of film noir in a superhero context, while also reflecting the societal fears of Bushera fear mongering and postmodernism. The film is an allegorical response to the events of 9/11, exploring the ‘by any means necessary’ mentality of the American Government and The\n\nPatriot Act. Nolan has admitted “Taking on an action film set in a great American city post 9/11, if we were going to be honest in our fears, then we would come up against the idea of terrorism.” (Nolan, 2008) And these fears are explored in every aspect of the film. Batman even resorts to the use of spyware on mobile phones in the city in an attempt to stop his anarchic antagonist, the Joker (Heath Ledger). Lucius Fox poses the important question, “At what cost?” when Batman attempts to justify his excessive means, clearly reflecting the fears and mentality of the American people and government at the time.\n\nThe Joker himself highlights the elements of our ‘noir hero’ in Batman. The two have many parallels, with both of them dressing up in ludicrous, extravagant costumes and dedicating themselves to an ideal and agenda. Batman is completely isolated from society, and despite working for the forces of good, is consistently treated as an outsider, as the Joker points out to him, “To them, you’re just a freak, like me, they need you know, but when they don’t… they’ll cast you out like a leper.” (The Dark Knight 2008) Ironically, Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker was inspired by the character of Tommy Udo played by Richard Widmark in the classic film noir Kiss of Death. Even more peculiarly, Widmark claimed that performance was partially inspired by the character of Joker in the Batman comic books of the time, (The Take, 2018) showing how deep rooted this film’s noir influences run. This film doesn’t pose Batman as a heroic figure at all, he doesn’t inspire children, or give the police department a sense of security. Instead, detectives, civilians, and criminals alike are all uncomfortable in his presence. Batman’s brutal nature is in constant conflict with his ‘one rule’ to never kill, and as the post-\n\nBatman world endures more and more eccentric masked men, Gotham city becomes “Wise to your act.” As pointed out by mobster Salvatore Moroni (Eric Roberts). In The Dark Knight, Batman is not an all American-hero with unflinching principles, he is as described in the title, a Knight, a man on the edge, and the perfect poster child for your atypical ‘noir hero’. By examining the history of Batman, with his debut in Detective Comics #27 (Britannica.com) and his long running title as ‘The World’s Greatest Detective’(nerdist.com), we can draw a few more interesting parallels with Baker’s description of a stereotypical noir hero — “We often follow a detective, or P.I. type, as they manoeuvre their way through a world of crime and corruption — not a balanced hero, but a flawed man “teetering on the brink of degeneracy.” (Baker, 2019). As we can deduce, it is clear that Batman embodies the ‘noir hero’ in post 9/11 world.\n\nFurthermore, the film is strongly inspired by the noir style from a production standpoint. The majority of the film is set in the dark city streets of Gotham at night, and the film frequently makes use of dutch angles, high contrast lighting, prominent use of shadows as well as lowkey lighting techniques.\n\nIn Fig.6 We see an example how dutch angles are employed when framing the Joker, emphasising the unstable and chaotic nature of his character and agenda. In Fig.7 we see the use of enveloping patterns and a high contrast between light and dark as the darkness gradually takes over the shot, depicting the internal struggle between light and dark going on within Batman, as well as the foreshadowing of his inevitable descent into the world of moral ambiguity and crime. Finally, in Fig.8, Batman has become completely immersed in the darkness, merely a silhouette against the bleak backdrop of the Hong Kong skyline. There is a clear noir influence in the overall presentation of the film that lingers throughout, always persisting and never quite managing to shake that sense of dread.\n\nThe film is also drenched in noir themes from a creative and storytelling perspective. Thestory follows the arc of Harvey Dent, a morally upstanding citizen and Gotham’s ‘White Knight’ who stands up to corruption and injustice at all costs. As we follow his character, we see his eventual decline into madness and evil as the Joker exposes the cruel realities of this corrupt city at the expense of Harvey’s loved ones. While there is not necessarily a femme fatale character in the film, the character of Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) acts a catalyst for his fall after falling victim to the Joker. He symbolises the struggle of moral ambiguity and illustrates how even the most earnest of men among us can be broken down and turned into monsters as a result of the broken society they live in. Harvey explains how “You thought we could be decent men in an indecent time! You were wrong.” Addressing not only the extremities to which the American government went to in their response to terrorism, but also the sheer difficulty for thriving, good individuals to prosper in a system designed to make them fail and break them down. This theme is also reminiscent of the post-war attitude to society in America, with many seemingly upstanding men heroically went off to war, only to return broke and damaged beyond repair both psychologically and physically, much like Dent after his accident. Batman is forced to become “the hero the city needs [him] to be” in order to save Dent’s reputation and maintain the cities hope for a brighter future. Much like film noir, Batman and Dent become products of the time and society they live in.\n\nThe Dark Knight embodies all the best traits of neo-noir and is a prime example of the reasons for its survival. Not only did it adapt to address the pressing issues of modern western culture, it accessed an entire new audience by adapting the superhero genre — one of Americas highest grossing and most popular genres (TheNumbers.com). Nolan had the benefit of hindsight and influence in regard to the entire collection of film noir and neo-noir cinema that had come before to draw inspiration on, and the final result is arguably the most well-received and highest rated neo-noir thriller in modern cinema.\n\nChapter 3 — The Future of Noir…\n\nWe have explored the nature of film noir and how it has evolved through its spiritual successor to the present day, but what lies ahead for the future of the genre? In this day and age, it is easy and even somewhat ‘popular’ to relate almost any issues back to social, sexual or racial injustices. However, neo-noir has survived partially on the basis of its adaptive nature to current real-world issues, meaning the current socio-political concerns have a substantial effect on how neo-noir continues moving forward. Film noir originally came about as a response to a crippled and broken society of the time, and we arguably find ourselves in a similar society today. Between corrupt government agendas, massive political division, the constant looming presence of Coronavirus, and the exposure of corruption within law authorities via the BLM movement, the world of 2021 is ripe for neo-noir inspiration.\n\nThe controversy and outrage at the Trump administration mirrors the inherent distrust of the American government that has given birth to a wide range of film noirs and neo-noirs, and will undoubtedly provoke passionate, cinematic responses. This essay is not the place to delve into the finer details of the current US political climate, but the general sense of fear that currently dominates America is directly linked to the Trump Administration and cannot be ignored. I will withdraw all personal opinion and political views in this section, but it is easy for any outsider to see the disapproval and division caused by his election. Trump won the election in 2016 by the electoral college, despite receiving the least number of votes from the population (Burns, 2019) and has since been impeached for accusations of soliciting foreign interference with the US election, for which he was never found guilty, despite overwhelming evidence. (Trumps Impeachment: A Very simple Guide, 2019) New York Times writers and Whitehouse correspondents Maggie Haberman and Katie Rogers state that “For decades, President Trump has sown distrust in almost everything that he touches.” (Haberman & Rogers, 2020) This is further supported by polls, with Gallup reporting only 40% of Americans believing Trump to be trustworthy, and 44% claim he does not display good judgment during crisis. (Jones, 2020) Cinematic responses to Trump’s appointment have already begun to surface in other genres. BlacKkKlansman (2018) Was released less than two years after the election, the film draws strong comparisons between the head figures of the Klu Klux Klan and Trump, proposing a convincing argument for the true nature of Trump as a political figure. Los Angeles Times Writer Glen Whipp advocates that “…profanity is mostly directed toward Donald Trump (“Agent Orange,” as Lee calls him), whose presence is felt and, on one occasion, seen”. (Whipp, 2018) We are already starting to see a cinematic response to the controversies of our time, and given the recent developments in our world, I am confident that neo-noirs will follow suit in the years to come, if they are not being produced already. While all this information makes it easy for us to pinpoint the President as the source of all our problems, in reality, he is a symptom of it. Trump’s election came from millions of people frustrated for not being heard in a divided society with has equally popular opposing doctrines. The groundwork for his rise to power was laid years before, echoing the traits of a noir society long before his appointment. This sense of fear, frustration and distrust acts as a fertiliser for genres such as neo-noir and its running theme of alienation.\n\nWe are also currently witnessing the exposure of severe corruption and injustice within the police enforcement system, an issue relevant to Americans in the 1940s, which eventually led to the birth of traditional noir tropes such as moral ambiguity and paranoia. The recent protests against the unlawful murder of George Floyd took the Black Lives Matter movement to a new level of outrage in 2020, sparking protests all over the world. The media immediately tried to label the protests as extremely violent, in order to sow distrust and controversy across the nation, with a recent poll indication that 42% of respondents now believe the BLM protests intend to incite violence. (Skelley, 2020) In reality, a recent report by the The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) discovered that 93% of the BLM protests were peaceful. While only 220 protests broke out in violence, 2,400 were reported to be peaceful. (Mansoor, 2020) Nevertheless, ACLED posits that “this disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing…” Here we can see a divided society, littered in confusion and alienation, where people turn on one another as a result of the misleading information of the government and media. This level of corruption within the police force and justice system is not dissimilar to that of the Watergate Scandal or Bush-era war profiteering and will indubitably be addressed in cinema in years to come; and this division, confusion, frustration and sense of powerlessness is most likely to manifest itself in the neo-noir genre. In the interview I conducted with Christian Høkaas, (MD in Film Science) I asked him whether he saw the same societal issues that gave birth to film noir emerging again in present day society. He advocates “the belief of the ‘new twists on old genres’ in a cyclical nature.” He goes onto say that genres repeat themselves “…in either the newer fashion, or embracing an older era and upgrading it, making it a homage to the previous style and so on.” (Høkaas, 2018) All this evidence leads me to strongly ascertain that a significant resurgence in neo-noir is not only probable, but inevitable.\n\nCombined with the other pressing concerns of our society, recent developments in the women’s movement (particularly within the film industry) could potentially give way to a new popularity for the femme fatale sensibilities. Where once, the femme fatale used her sexuality to her advantage, the Hollywood that moved on from film noir would use female sexuality as an exploitive marketing tool to draw in audiences. In my interview with Anna Smith, she stresses that “…the Weinstein scandal and the MeToo and Time’s Up movements have made it harder for those in power to ignore the woeful stats about women behind and in front of the camera.We are seeing the results with women finally being given big budget superhero movies.” (Smith, 2020) Smith accurately sums up the recent changes in the industry. Though while Smith is correct in her addressment of issues behind the camera, there have also been a lot of changes in front of it. Along with the aftermath of the MeToo movement, the growing awareness and discontent of the gender pay-gap has caused men and women alike to rally to support their female co-stars.\n\nA recent study conducted by the joint efforts of Huddersfield University, John S Heywood, and Lancaster University, indicated that, male Hollywood stars earn an average of $1.1m more per film than their female co-stars. (Doward & Fraser, 2019) Responses have been varied and inspiring, with Chadwick Boseman and Sienna Miller as a standout example. Upon discovering the studio refused to pay Miller what she expected for her role in 21 Bridges (2019), Boseman donated a part of his salary to reach the number she asked for. (BBC, 2020) As the industry begins to amend for these long-standing injustices, we are seeing more and more talented females both in-front of, and behind the camera. With these new changes, we are seeing women regain their “financial and sexual independence” (Keesey, 2010), very similar to the women workforce of WW2. While I wouldn’t definitively claim that the character of the femme fatale is going to see a resurgence, I would argue that this new rise in female empowerment within the industry will give way to a new wave of original, authentic female characters, many of which containing the sensibilities of the femme fatale — not just a damsel in distress, but a cunning, smart women that uses her femininity to help further her own goals. We have already seen an increase in iconic female superhero characters on the silver screen in the past few years, with the success of Wonder Woman (2017), Wonder Woman 1984, (2020), Captain Marvel (2019) (Box Office Mojo, 2020) and the imminent release of Black Widow (2021) proving that cinema is ready and willing to give women the spotlight they deserve. These notorious protagonists portrayed by Gal Gadot and Brie Larson offer a change in perspective when tackling issues of sexism in their films that are watched by millions of viewers around the world. I strongly believe we shall see a growing traction for mysterious, intimidating, seductive female characters not only in neo-noir, but in all manner of films that release in the coming years.\n\nWhen discussing a film movement that holds alienation, paranoia, and isolation at its core, it is impossible to ignore the current effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the world, let alone western culture. As the vast majority of countries around the globe closed their borders, enforced government mandates to stay inside and denied people the right to see their loved ones or socialise in public places. At the time of writing, it is estimated that nearly two million people worldwide have died from illnesses linked to the disease. The global cases has reached nearly one-hundred million (John Hopkins University, 2021). During this time, we have families unable to be together, families torn apart by being stuck together, protests, conspiracy theories that the virus in merely a hoax, and a huge range of world-leaders who have acted ignorantly and made fatal errors in the handling of the pandemic, leading to more outrage and higher death rates. Donald Trump is one notable case, he has been very open about his lack of care for the virus, often not taking it seriously when relaying the situation to the American public. His handling of the pandemic has hit “record-low approvals” with 59% of American adults disapproving of his response. (Whitesides, 2020) Furthermore, information on the disease has been subject to rampat speculation and massive exaggeration in the media. PWC reported “It could be governments releasing skewed data, perhaps to shield their citizens from the true extent of the pandemic’s impact — or perhaps because no reliable data is available. They went on to explain the spread of fakes news “…driven in large part by the public itself. False information circulating online has included claims around cures of Covid-19, origins of the outbreak, and authorities’ responses to the pandemic.” (PWC, 2020) Depression and suicide rates are at an all-time high around the world, with millions of jobs lost and lives destroyed. In a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China across 1257 health carer professionals reported over 50% of the total subjects suffered from depression, 44.6% suffered from anxiety, and 34% had insomnia. (Sher, 2020) Time and time again, we are seeing direct similarities between our society and the society of the 40s. Distrust and paranoia have been sown deep into society, with people confused and unsure how to act in such exceptional circumstances. Depression and negativity dominate over our culture, making everyone see the world in a much darker context, and it is in this darkness that neo-noir will thrive.\n\nConclusion\n\nBy examining the film noir movement of the 1940s, we have understood the nature of these films, and their artistic aims to reflect the fears of the society of the time. We have explored how its sensibilities and themes have lived on through its spiritual successor, neo-noir, and how neo-noir has developed into a full genre that has survived throughout decades of cinema. Through adapting to current social issues, popular contemporary genres, and integrating its themes into mainstream Hollywood movies, neo-noir has thrived and been a source of artistic inspiration for hundreds of praised films in modern cinema, some of which I have analysed in this essay. Political uproar, government corruption, injustice and alienation plague the current Western world. We can see the imminent renaissance of neo-noir approaching when comparing the society of today with the society of the 1940s. It may take a variety of forms, perhaps new sub-genres, more prominence in Hollywood movies, or a new spiritual successor to neo-noir all-together. But above all else, what enabled film noir to survive was its innate ability to adapt and evolve to the ever-changing world around us. Filmmakers looked at the fragmented society they lived in and “found an artistic language to express the mood of a particular moment.” (The Take, 2018) This allows people to process the world they’re living in and see it through a more stylised and strangely beautiful lens. Though it may seem dark, defeatist and cynical at times, the world of noir has hope at its core. The production of these films alone proves the willingness of creative individuals to band together in times of isolation and address the issues of their time. It is not until we recognise a problem, that we can hope to understand and overcome it, film noir and neo-noir allows us to do that through cinema. This, in my opinion, is the overall artistic aim of noir movement; not to depress people and convince them there is nothing they can do to create positive change in the world, but to expose the problems of society at all levels and act as a call for its improvement — and it does all this with style. The last words of Se7en (1995) evoke this clearly. Despite being one of the most graphic and horrific noirs to date, Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman) paraphrases Ernest Hemingway when claiming “…‘The world is a fine place, and worth fighting for’… I agree with the second part.”\n\nBibliography\n\nFilms\n\n21 Bridges (2019) Directed by Brian Kirk [Film US: STXfilms\n\nA Touch of Evil (1958) Directed by Orson Welles [Film] US: Universal Pictures\n\nBlacKkKlansman (2018) Directed by Spike Lee [Film] US: Focus Features\n\nBlade Runner (1982) Directed by Ridley Scott [Film] US: Warner Bros.\n\nCaptain America: Winter Soldier (2014) Directed by Anthony & Joe Russo [Film] US: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures\n\nCaptain Marvel (2019) Directed by Anna Boden & Ryan Fleck [Film] US: Walt Disney\n\nStudios Motion Pictures\n\nChinatown (1974) Directed by Roman Polanski [Film] US: Paramount Pictures\n\nDead Reckoning (1947) Directed by John Cromwell [Film] US: Columbia Pictures\n\nDemonlover (2002) Directed by Olivier Assayas [Film] US: Palm Pictures\n\nDouble Indemnity (1944) Directed by Billy Wilder [Film] US: Paramount Pictures\n\nHouse of Games (1987) Directed by David Mamet [Film] US: Orion Pictures\n\nInherent Vice (2014) Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson [Film] US: Warner Bros.
