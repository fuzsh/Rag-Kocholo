        "text": "The Atlantic's wonderful new Video Channel has a lot of great material, and it is invidious to point to any one offering rather than another. But this clip, \"Wings Over the Golden Gate,\" which I started watching because of the irresistible aviation + California combo (I have flown over exactly the scenes shown here) got my attention for another reason. Watch for about 60 seconds and you'll see what I mean.\n\nThe language that the narrator, one Gayne Whitman, uses is florid enough. But his accent! It's instantly familiar to anyone who's seen old movies and newsreels from the 1930s and 1940s. But you cannot imagine a present-day American using it with a straight face. It's not faux-British, but it's a particular kind of lah-dee-dah American diction that at one time was very familiar and now has vanished. Margaret Dumont, in the Marx Brothers movies, was maybe the most familiar and caricatured female equivalent. Even Katharine Hepburn's very arch accent (eg in Philadelphia Story) seemed a step closer to \"modern\" American usage.\n\nI wonder who the last person was who sounded this way. I wish someone still did. Maybe I'll try.\n\n___\n\nMystery solved, or much of it. I knew the accent but must have been the last person not to know its name. I had always thought that a \"Transatlantic accent\" was the faux-British frumpery I mention above. Unt-uh! As reader P. Hoh says in a representative response:"
