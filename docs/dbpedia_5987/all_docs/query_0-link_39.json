        "text": "The 1940’s were well into the new age of talking pictures, so cinematic technology was figuring out ways to now advance both camera and audio recording techniques. At the same time, artists were combatting two different opposing forces. Firstly, censorship of all kinds was becoming rampant, stifling the creativity of all producers and directors; at the same time, it was forcing storytellers to come up with new ways to play out the tales they wanted to convey. Then, there was World War II, which affected the entire world during its darkest hours in contemporary history. There was clearly a lot happening in the 1940’s that affected filmmaking greatly, including budgetary cutbacks and loss of jobs, as well as the obvious danger that the war posed on everyone.\n\nMuch of what was placed on the big screens back then was likely a call to action or for help, but we can look safely in hindsight at the magnificent statements of many. There are a number of films that discuss the war outright, helping those affected either cope or identify their feelings with someone else. Then, there are the many offshoot waves of war related films that may not directly deal with battle, including Italian neorealism’s focus on post-war life, the brewing Japanese wave of films that would eventually blossom into the nation’s own New Wave (in response to the atomic bombings), and the universal works that discussed — or satirized — the politics that drove the world to such a hateful place (and the joyful features that tried to help pull us out of said place).\n\nThe Golden Age of Hollywood was in its latter stages, but the cinema of the world was on an artistic rise. Making up for lost time regarding the daring ‘30s works that were now problematic according to censorship laws (this goes beyond just the Hollywood Code), the ‘40s aimed high with ambition. Crime and horror turned into films noir. Screwball was translating into the next era of romantic comedies. Black and white was gradually becoming Technicolor. If the stories that were meant to be told couldn’t be, then new stories were being told altogether. Some of cinema’s most impactful minds began in the 1940’s, because innovation was required to help filmmakers keep going and viewers get by. We have reached the darkest moment in time for any of my top one hundred lists, and many of these works are going to be candid. However, I feel these following features best represent this time period topically, inventively, and artistically. Here are the best one hundred films of the 1940’s.\n\nDisclaimer: I am including documentaries and shorts — anything shorter than forty minutes — on another list, and they won’t be featured here.\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n88. Henry V\n\nLaurence Olivier was always meant to act, but his directing capabilities feel like they were the result of hard work and determination. One of the finer filmmakers to bring the works of William Shakespeare to the screen (you’ll see another film of his on this list shortly), Olivier was keen on perfecting his adaptations as if they were completely new works. His debut is the Technicolor epic Henry V, which was clearly his way of professing his love for the late playwright; he also stars in the lead role, and knows how to frame himself as much as he can dominate from in front of the camera. Ending on a bit of a prolonged sequence of glee might be the giddiness of Olivier at work, and he would refine his vision eventually, but seeing an Olivier driven by bliss is worthwhile.\n\n86. Death is a Caress\n\nEdith Carlmar always vowed to push the buttons of the Norwegian film industry, and it took that kind of initiative to create what is thought to be the first film noir of the entire nation. Within that title, we find Death is a Caress: an interpretation of the American (and possibly French) ways of approaching the genre through a unique lens (particularly the condensing of memories and regrets, rather than dwelling in them). Death is a Caress is strong in execution but even more fascinating in conception, like its existence — as an understanding of the cinema of elsewhere — is fascinating in and of itself. Then, there's Carlmar’s boldness to bring this vision to life, going against the odds as a female director in the ‘40s, with a film style that an entire country had yet to even attempt until then.\n\n75. El Gran Calavera\n\nThe 1940’s were arguably Luis Buñuel’s lowest years (even though he technically only released two features during this time frame). Regardless, the master that he was, Buñuel still shined in his biggest drought with El gran Calavera: a class satire about the illusion of wealth. Always the kind of auteur that had to make commentary on the current state of the world, Buñuel takes an elite family and has them believe that they are now worthless and in need of working (for once) in order to stay afloat. Then, the fireworks fly. Considerably safe by Buñuel's standards (I needn’t remind you of how cynical he could get), El gran Calavera is still razor sharp for its time, and a sign that Buñuel hadn’t gone anywhere; if anything, he was about to make his presence known for a very long time.\n\n64. They Live by Night\n\nSelecting just one of Nicolas Ray’s works as his opus is mightily difficult, so that’s a task I’m refusing to partake in. However, I can safely say that he was brilliant from the very start. Who makes They Live by Night as their debut? Stemming from the Depression's impact and creating a necessity to do bad, They Live by Night single handedly helped spark getaway pictures, and have us care for all parties involved at the same time. We can all make poor decisions, but fate is also fate, and I think that is sadly abundantly clear throughout all of Ray’s picture. Perhaps an allusion of the lives affected beyond their control during financial crises, They Live by Night is quite dark but extremely sympathetic. Ray just understands how to convey American hardships in his pictures, and it was obvious from scene one of his first feature.\n\n57. Spring in a Small Town\n\nFei Mu wasn’t granted enough time with us, as he was killed by a heart attack at the young age of forty four. His final film was Spring in a Small Town, which was released three years before his passing (and near the end of the decade). He unfortunately wasn’t around to see where his masterpiece would go, being crowned one of the great works of early Chinese cinema years after its release. Part of this adoration, I think, comes from the heavy symbolism of the film (with characters representing Chinese society itself, particularly Liyan as the remnants of the Sino-Japanese War and the inability to readjust back to normalcy). Either way, he created a fable that clearly was only an ounce of what he had left to show us.\n\n14. It’s a Wonderful Life\n\nThe holiday film of all holiday films, it’s hard to imagine how Frank Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life wasn’t as beloved upon release (then again, look at all of the Capra films it was being held to). With the invention of television came the showing of classic films, and It’s a Wonderful Life eventually became a Christmas staple. As nice as that is, it’s simply just a fantastic film to begin with. We face George Bailey on what may be his death bed, and wait long enough before divine intervention takes place. By that point, we’re caught up on everything plaguing him, and we hope that things turn around. Such a celebration of life needs its dark moments, and this film provides us with some of Capra’s more dismal sequences. I’m sure you already know how this one ends, but It’s a Wonderful Life is a crowd pleaser that reigns as one of Capra’s finest features.\n\n13. A Matter of Life and Death\n\nBy 1947, The Archers were well known for their inventive films, particularly ones being drenched in Technicolor splendour. So, one of their strongest experiments was A Matter of Life and Death: a fantasy war film that dips between gorgeous colour (when alive) and black and white (when dead). The catch is that colour details the normal, but the black and white world is that of the other side, full of breathtaking sets and ideas. So, we witness a trial of a man who should be dead but is busy running around alive; do we root for the pilot to go where he should, or hope that he remains alive? Clearly, we all entice the latter, but A Matter of Life and Death never vilifies those that have come to take him away, as the film is tongue and cheek enough to be a celebration of being alive throughout its duration.\n\n11. The Magnificent Ambersons\n\nOrson Welles was not done telling the stories of the falling elite after Citizen Kane, so he sought out to follow up his masterful debut with a nearly equal follow up. The Magnificent Ambersons might not be discussed nearly as much as his previous film, but it’s just as deserving. Full of exquisite camera techniques, depths of field, uses of shadow, and powerful performances, The Magnificent Ambersons continues Welles’ translation of the stage into what cinema can be. Following the entire lives of the titular Amberson family, we experience both privilege and destitution in a mere hour and a half (I can only hope to finally see the extended versions Welles had intended one day). The Magnificent Ambersons was all the proof we needed that Welles was far from a one trick pony: he was destined to be an auteur.\n\n10. Ivan the Terrible\n\nSo the damndest thing happened in the early ‘40s. Joseph Stalin requested Sergei Eisenstein to create a film about Ivan Vasilyevich as a means of propaganda. Yeah. He asked the Battleship Potemkin guy (I know he’s done propaganda works like Alexander Nevsky, but still) . Stalin got what he asked for. Part I is a gorgeously shot rise of power. Stalin only got as far as Part II, which reveals the corruption in the titular Grand Prince’s heart (and a climactic Technicolor fever dream to boot). So, Part II was banned for over a decade, and Part III was destroyed. Considering the fragmented state we have, Ivan the Terrible is still one of the finest films of the era, with photographical techniques from the future, and complete devotion from Eisenstein and company. We will never know what the full production would have been like, sadly; it had to have been one of the greatest films of all time if its unfinished form cracks a top ten.\n\n5. Children of Paradise\n\nIn the wake of Gone With the Wind, films were being compared to it as a means of promotion. Such was the case of Marcel Carné’s Children of Paradise, which is frankly a much better film, and I think it should stand on its own. Children of Paradise pits a concubine with various suitors in a nineteenth century theatrical environment, and has each player profess their adoration in their own unique ways. The entire plot is told poetically, with emotions being shown on the sleeves of all. Spectacle is part of the appeal, but the main attraction is the oozing emotions that drip off the screen. Sure, Gone With the Wind might also showcase love on an epic scale, but Children of Paradise knows what real love feels like through and through.\n\n4. Casablanca\n\nThe romantic epic to end all romantic epics. There truly is no besting Casablanca, because it allows the narrative to decide how to gestate. There’s no forcing of love, as we’re seeing the aftermath of a romance being destroyed. There’s no big time backdrop, as we’re in hiding in the titular Moroccan city away from the second World War. All we have are memories and guilt, colliding in Rick’s nightclub. Pieced together by some of the greatest dialogue in film, Casablanca is a constant influx of feelings, most of them gelling with one another to create uncertainty. It’s one of those cases where the extremely high bar set by pop culture doesn’t diminish the first time you watch the film, even if you know every line going in. Casablanca is so perfect, that I’d argue it still isn’t overrated by any means.\n\n1. The Red Shoes\n\nThe greatest filmmaking partnership of yesteryear — and arguably ever — is that of the visionary Michael Powell and the intelligent Emeric Pressburger, known universally as The Archers. The Archers worked predominantly with Technicolor in a time where that was mightily unusual, and most of their features were determined to push the boundaries of their respective genres. This only meant good things for their loose adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Red Shoes”: a fairy tale of perfectionism being the downfall of a budding artist. Once again, The Archers had to go beyond their guidelines, and made a modern day rendition of the story, involving the understanding of the fairy tale’s existence and its relation to similar circumstances. A ballet dancer is in the middle of a creative tug-of-war with one desire: to dance, no matter what. Powell and Pressburger wanted to see how far this dream could go.\n\nMarking the absolute end of the showstopper eras of the Golden Age of Hollywood, The Red Shoes features spectacle numbers that compete with the very best, only they have the advantages of the greatest uses of Technicolor, and advanced editing techniques. Unlike most other pictures, the imaginative sequences in The Red Shoes take you to a completely different dimension, and it’s a trip you never want to end. Then the film blurs the lines between these fantasy sequences and real life: are the red shoes actually possessive? It’s this uncertainty that makes The Red Shoes a different experience for every person that watches it. All I know is that we’re seeing the technical side of art and how it can drive an aspiring creator into the ground; this process is likened to love, as the core love triangle only tangles things up even more.\n\nThe Red Shoes is a jaw dropping achievement of filmmaking that competes with the best films in an era where innovation was imperative. Visually, the film is extraordinary, and its aesthetics are unparalleled. Narratively, The Red Shoes is a mature fairy tale for a new generation, inviting audiences of all ambitions to find themselves placed in poor Victoria Page’s shoes (red or not). It’s unusual to find a film as majestic, compelling, graceful and haunting as The Red Shoes, as it truly transcends most labels you try to attribute to it. It’s a film that tends to your mind, heart and soul all equally, leaving you feeling as fulfilled as can be. It’s imperative viewing for any cinephile, and it is debatably the best film of the 1940’s."
