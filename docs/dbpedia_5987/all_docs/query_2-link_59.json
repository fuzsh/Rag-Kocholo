        "text": "Filmmaking in the 1930s had become an insular process with no need to go beyond the studio walls. But by the mid 1940s it was as if all of the interesting and unique places and backdrops in and around Los Angeles had just been discovered. This newfound interest in location shooting was encouraged by local government officials as well. The Los Angeles Police Department, seeing an opportunity to bolster its image, began cooperating in a big way. Directors were allowed to shoot scenes inside police headquarters which in those days was located within the city hall. And J. Edgar Hoover was eager to help producers for a good plug. 1948âs The Street With No Name was among many films given access to FBI facilities.\n\nNoir stories were all contemporary so you didnât need special sets or costumes, the entire modern city could serve as a backdrop. The use of hard lighting and shadows in noir meant less crew and equipment was needed at a location. In the creative process of noir there would be little need for cranes and dollies. 1944âs Double Indemnity would be a turning point in this evolution. Billy Wilderâs generous use of location shots added a realism to the film that both audiences and critics took note of. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards . Wilder was no doubt motivated by the limited possibilities on the Paramount studio lot in his desire to bring that realism to the film.\n\nThe major studioâs divestiture of their theater chains in 1948 provided opportunities for independent producers who found contemporary crime dramas to be just the ticket in terms of cost. Find a story, hire a cast and crew and go out into the environs and shoot your film. More than 80 percent of the independently produced film noirs were made after the court ordered divesture such was the impact. Many of these turned out to be very good noirs. Of course everything was much simpler in those times. There was not the maize of bureaucracy and permits that filmmakers encounter today.\n\nNot every studio was quick to embrace the benefits of location shooting. MGM, and to a lessor extent Warner Bros, had extensive back lots and they needed to justify them. Louis B. Mayer at MGM in particular, never grasped the evolving taste of audiences nor did he have any appreciation for the new style of film making. That made MGM one of the laggards in the production of noirs. On the other hand, Warner Bros. certainly produced its share of noirs and most of them quite good despite the limitations of being filmed on the studio lot. But for any film noir aficionado the differences are not only apparent, but in some cases distracting.\n\n1950âs D.O.A. is an example of what location shooting did for a film. Here was a film that had an intriguing storey and good characters. However the use of locales, both in Los Angeles and San Francisco provided a realism and ambiance that could not have been achieved on the set. When watching the film the viewer is reminded at every turn the vitality of everyday life and of OâBrienâs impending mortality. Itâs one of the elements that makes the film work. Conversely, The Big Sleep, was filmed entirely on Warnerâs lot. Itâs a classic film owing to many factors, but it has an artificial feel about it. Within noir itself there also evolved the narrative, or docudrama style of film. Films like He Walked By Night relied extensively on location backdrops to give it authenticity.\n\nLos Angeles of the late 1940s seemed to be the right place at the right time for noir filmmakers. Raymond Chandler had already set the landscape in peopleâs minds using Los Angeles as the backdrop in his successful detective novels. As directors soon discovered, Los Angeles offered a wealth of interesting places for noir backdrops. Everything from the art deco Union Train Station to the boat dock at Westlake Park were finding their way into noir. But no area was more appealing than Bunker Hill district."
