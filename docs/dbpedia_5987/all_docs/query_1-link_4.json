        "text": "The social constructs of gender, sex and sexuality are exceedingly broad topics which literature discusses in a multitude of ways. As literature, according to feminist theory, is seen as one of the primary methods of socialisation for readers, in deciding their own views on men and women alike, the interpretations which can be drawn from texts are crucial. In turn authors and their various methods of depicting gender and sexuality are key for critics to understand how we as a species interpret these social constructs. In this essay I will discuss Orwell’s Nineteen-Eighty Four, Carter’s Nights at the Circus and Delaney’s A Taste of Honey. These texts all utilise these themes in varying ways, giving both positive and negative representations of what it means to be a man or a woman.\n\nOrwell’s 1949 political fiction Nineteen-Eighty Four depicts a multi-faceted view on women’s sexuality. Secondary character Julia is undoubtedly sexual; intercourse being her sole method of rebellion against Big Brother. Orwell utilises Julia as a key proto-feminist character; she is powerful, assertive and able to awaken Winston’s revolutionary spirit with this ‘political act’[1]. Julia very much reflects Orwell’s own democratic socialist roots; she symbolises the Orwellian yearning for the achievement of absolute equality, with her ‘defiance of the official sexual morality’[2]. This was very much the intention of Orwell, who discussed his aims for the novel as ‘getting [himself] right down among the oppressed’[3], despite his aristocratic upbringing. Contrastingly, it is also true that Julia is ‘only a rebel from the waist downwards’[4], a euphemism intended to be pejorative. Even Winston, as besotted with Julia as he is, notes that she is no intellectual rebel, but solely another woman unconsciously adhering to her sexual stereotypes, as well as the stereotypes of Orwell’s post-war society, with her overtly sexual appetites. In contrast, Julia becomes an inherently anti-feminist character, who serves solely as Winston’s form of sexual release. Baruch notes that ‘By the end of Nineteen-Eighty Four romantic love is dead. Indeed I question whether it is there to begin with.’[5] Similarities can also be drawn to Winston’s wife, who mirrors Orwell’s first wife, Buddicom, in being an ultimately submissive figure. Baruch also argues that Julia is insignificant to Winston, as they ‘worship the sexual instinct and not the sexual object, and it is the glorification of the sexual object that is all-important in romantic love’[6]. Nineteen-Eighty Four is drastically different to its fellow dystopian novels with its handling of the themes of love/sex. It can be noted that in these texts, where monogamous love ultimately reigns, Winston cares very little for Julia, due to her sexual liberation. Baruch compares Nineteen-Eighty Four to Huxley’s Brave New World, suggesting that Winston would not be faced with the same jealousy as the Savage, had he seen Julia with another man. Julia’s sexual freedom therefore lessens her value as a partner to Winston.\n\nJulia’s sexuality is also shaped by how unconventionally masculine she is as a character. There is the debate as to whether Julia’s masculinity is a form of proto-feminist rebellion, or as to whether she has been conditioned by a patriarchal society to behave in a manner aligning with its tyrants. Whilst Julia has an anarchic personality, her dialogue has ‘a certain irony’[7]. An example of such behaviour is when Julia wears some purchased makeup. Whilst she is rebelling against Big Brother for using prohibited products, she is abiding to Winston’s male fantasies. Similarly, she aligns to the stereotypical representation of the uneducated woman, in a crucial era where women were fighting for their rights to an education. Orwell depicts Julia as a rebel who is ‘indifferent to all politics other than sexual politics’[8], as she falls asleep when Winston reads Goldstein’s influential manual. Julia’s adherence and subversion towards gender stereotypes causes readers to question whether Julia is a male fantasy, a female fantasy, or perhaps both. The lack of female characters in the novel leaves readers with little information to draw on, regarding gender and stereotypes within the microcosm of Oceania. Winston’s mother and sister adhered strongly to the gender stereotyping of the 1940s, as they were continually victimised until their mysterious disappearances. We hear little about them, except for within Winston’s dreams, where they are ‘down in some subterranean place….looking up at him’[9], a metaphor for his higher status in the patriarchal Oceania. Whilst these unfortunate depictions of women seem to suggest that Orwell viewed women as weak and fragile, it must be noted that many proto-feminist texts used exaggerated damsels-in-distress to evoke particular messages of unfair inequality. This was particularly common in Gothic novels, such as Shelley’s Frankenstein and Stoker’s Dracula. Orwell utilises this technique to depict a cruel dystopia which society should aspire to avoid.\n\nIn Angela Carter’s 1984 novel Nights at the Circus, the author goes a step further than creating masculine female characters. Instead, the protagonist Fevver’s is anthropomorphic. As someone who subverts everything traditionally human, Fevvers cannot be expected to adhere to any of the traditional gender stereotypes. In this Gothic novel, Carter utilises the theme of reality to question the construct of gender. The novels settings, especially the perplexing circus, gives readers the sense of absolute liberation. The motif of illusion becomes quickly clear as the novel utilises the rhetorical question in the beginning, ‘is not this whole world an illusion?’[10] Carter’s post-modernist experimentation further alienates readers, as it shifts from third-person narrative to first-person, repeating this shift for an experimental third act. Much like Carter’s 1979 collection of short stories, The Bloody Chamber, magical realism is utilised, to such an extent that characters need no concept of sex or gender. Readers question whether sex is even a solid social construct, as Fevvers, according to Dennis, ‘flagrantly defies patriarchal injunctions of self-attenuation’[11]. Lizzie notably describes Walser as ‘malleable’[12], the exact same word O’Brien uses to describe mankind in Nineteen-Eighty Four. In this sense both texts argue that strict gender constructions can be altered and shaped. Characters in Carter’s metafictional novel have an absolute freedom; Fevver’s has both masculine and feminine personas. Bakhtin suggests that ‘carnival celebrates the temporary liberation from prevailing truth and established order’[13]; there is an undeniable aspect of body positivity within the novel. As a key literary feminist during the second wave of the 1980s, Carter held great interest within the roles of women in the workplace, such as Fevver’s being the star act in Kearney’s circus. Although Nights at the Circus is unarguably a liberating text for both women and men, it disjoints itself from reality to an excessive degree. Questions arise as to whether readers can even relate to such an unorthodox novel, so therefore it fails as a feminist form of literary socialisation.\n\nThe freedom Fevver’s obtains in Nights at the Circus is very much double-sided, as she becomes corrupted with the liberation she symbolises. Fevver’s can be seen as anti-feminist, due to the oppression she falls victim to. As a woman who is anthropomorphic, Fevver’s literalises the pejorative slang-term ‘bird’[14]. Similarly, all the women of the brothel are described as ‘suffragists [who]… want to see the end of [their] cage[s]’[15]. Carter’s use of the Male Gaze, which dominates the lexis surrounding Fevvers, also gives a uncomfortably eroticised depiction of the protagonist, as she is described as having a ‘strain[ing] bodice! You’d think her tits were going to pop right out!’[16] The circus, which Bakhtin argues as symbolising freedom, Dennis proposes having negative connotations. In adhering to the Gothic trope of the double, the circus represents a ‘hierarchy of male performers… and an oppressive treatment of subordinates, including women and animals’[17], to which categories Fevver’s is doubly applicable to. The emotions that build up within the protagonist due to her oppression cause her to consume her anger, via the metaphorical device of food. Here Carter utilises the Bakhtinian grotesque, as Fevvers becomes a glutton. Dennis notes that ‘eating [has] historically played a crucial role in models of femininity’[18]. This contrasts from Carter, who herself was a severely anorexic teenager. Fevvers represents an antithesis of the frail female, yet she still cannot stop devouring, furthering her animalistic nature. This consumption Carter intends to be an inherently masculine trait, however it takes over Fevver’s femininity till she is rendered solely a masculine figure. As Fevvers ‘gorged [and] stuffed herself’[19], Carter utilises dynamic verbs to exaggerate Fevver’s appetite. Perhaps this is similar to what Orwell had happen to Julia in Nineteen-Eighty Four, in relation to becoming an unconventional female. In these prejudiced societies, the sole method of survival is to become just as selfish as their cruel, patriarchal counterparts, yet unconsciously becoming just as monstrous as the very antagonists they fought against.\n\nIn contrast, a uniquely realist play, A Taste of Honey, first performed in 1958, discusses appetites of the sexual variety. Whilst the appetites of characters within Delaney’s ‘kitchen-sink’ drama are more relatable for readers than those in Carter’s novel, many characters are left shunned against for their sexual desires. The fifties, as Lewis suggests, were a ‘major psychological watershed’[20], with a new youth culture and changing attitudes. In the post-war era, the plays of ‘angry young men’ gained significant popularity. These often misogynistic plays, particularly Osborne’s Look Back in Anger, often left women ‘under-represented’[21], prompting a bold outburst from a young Delaney. In Delaney’s controversial play, her realistic portrayal of life went beyond many proto-feminist texts, as it discussed racism, sexism and homophobia which had before been under societal normalisation. The protagonist, Jo, is shunned for her appetite with regards to her partner Jimmy, who happens to be a black man. In a world of ‘Eurocentric universalism’[22], Jo symbolises the West whilst Jimmy symbolises ‘The East [which is] inferior to the West’[23]. Jo’s gender disadvantages her, in how she is disgraced by her mother as a ‘silly little whore’[24], prompting Jo to hyperbolically declare she does not ‘want to be a mother… [does not] want to be a woman’[25]. However we also see how race is just as unhealthy a prejudice, if not more severe, as Jimmy, although absent, receives just as much discrimination. Similarly, Geof, Jo’s doting friend, is suggested to be homosexual. Delaney defies the heteronormativity of the 1950s, with this declaration of absolute equality, which draws similarities to Orwell and his socialist views prevalent in Nineteen-Eighty Four. Delaney also gives an interesting depiction of homosexuality, which is rare within feminist texts, which Barry notes are often critiqued as having ‘difficult[ies] to accommodate difference[s], whether racial…or sexual’[26] beyond the issues of white, middle-class women. Delaney’s depiction of gender is unique, as she evokes a clear viewpoint that you cannot discuss gender without attention to class, race, sexuality and other prejudices at play.\n\nTo conclude, these texts give readers a multiplicity of interpretations about men and women, yet despite this they all have a certain hesitancy; none may give too bold a judgement, for fear of being fiercely critiqued. It is also clear that there is no simple way to interpret texts, ones which may have positive connotations also evoke pejorative comments with regards to these social constructs. It is up to each individual reader to decide upon these views themselves, and utilise the lessons these texts bring them in any way they see fit.\n\nBibliography\n\nAndermahr, Sonya, Angela Carter: New Critical Readings (London: Bloomsbury Academic, 2014)\n\nBakhtin, Mikhail, Rabelais and His World (Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1968)\n\nBarry, Peter, Beginning Theory (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009)\n\nBennett, Susan, ‘New Plays and Women’s Voices in the 1950s’ in The Cambridge Companion to Modern British Women Playwrights (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 38\n\nCarpentier, Martha, ‘The ‘Dark Power of Destiny’ in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four’, Mosaic: A Journal for the Interdisciplinary Study of Literature, 47:1: (2014)\n\nCarter, Angela, Nights at the Circus (London: Vintage, 1994)\n\nCarter, Angela, The Bloody Chamber (London: Vintage, 2006)\n\nCoker, Catherine, ‘Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction’, Extrapolation, 53:1: (2012), pp. 131-133\n\nCooke, Rachel, ‘Shelagh Delaney: The Return of Britain’s Angry Young Woman’, The Observer, 25th January 2014, p. 17\n\nDelaney, Shelagh, A Taste of Honey (New York: Grove Press, 1980)\n\nDennis, Abigail, ‘The Spectacle of Her Gluttony: The Performance of Female Appetite and the Bakhtinian Grotesque in Angela Carter’s ‘Nights at the Circus’ ’, Journal of Modern Literature, 31:4: (2008), pp. 116-130\n\nFerns, Chris, Narrating Utopia: Ideology, Gender, Form in Utopian Literature (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999)\n\nGamble, Sarah, The Fiction of Angela Carter: Reader’s Guides to Essential Criticism (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2001)\n\nHarding, John, Sweetly Sings Delaney: A Study of Shelagh Delaney’s Work 1958-68 (London: Greenwich Exchange, 2014)\n\nHoffman Baruch, Elaine, Women, Love and Power: Literary and Psychoanalytic Perspectives (New York: New York University Press, 1991)\n\nHuxley, Aldous, Brave New World (London: Vintage Classics, 2007)\n\nLewis, Peter, The Fifties, (New York: William Heinemann, 1978), p. 7\n\nOrwell, George, Nineteen Eighty-Four (London: Penguin Books, 1990)\n\nOrwell, George, The Road to Wigan Pier (London: Penguin, 2001), p. 130\n\nOsborne, John, Look Back in Anger (London: Faber and Faber, 1978)\n\nPalmer, Paulina, ‘Bird Women: Angela Carter’s Magical Flight’ in Women Reading Women’s Writing (Brighton: Harvestor, 1987)\n\nRichardson, Diane, Introducing Gender and Women’s Studies (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007)\n\nTaylor, Lib, ‘Early Stages’ in The Cambridge Companion to Modern British Women Playwrights (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 18-23\n\nWalters, Margaret, Feminism: A Very Short Introduction (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005)\n\nWandor, Michelene, ‘Women playwrights and the challenge of feminism in the 1970s’ in The Cambridge Companion to Modern British Women Playwrights (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), pp. 53-68\n\n[1] Orwell, Nineteen-Eighty Four, p. 146.\n\n[2] Chris, Ferns, Narrating Utopia: Ideology, Gender, Form in Utopian Literature (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1999), p. 123.\n\n[3] George, Orwell, The Road to Wigan Pier (London: Penguin, 2001), p. 130.\n\n[4] Orwell, Nineteen-Eighty Four, p. 129.\n\n[5] Elaine, Baruch, Women, Love and Power: Literary and Psychoanalytic Perspectives (New York: New York University Press, 1991), p. 212.\n\n[6] Baruch, Women, Love and Power, p. 212.\n\n[7] Baruch, Women, Love and Power, p. 214.\n\n[8] Baruch, Women, Love and Power, p. 219.\n\n[9] Orwell, Nineteen-Eighty Four, p. 26.\n\n[10] Angela, Carter, Nights at the Circus (London: Vintage, 1994), p. 14.\n\n[11] Abigail, Dennis, ‘The Spectacle of Her Gluttony: The Performance of Female Appetite and the Bakhtinian Grotesque in Angela Carter’s ‘Nights at the Circus’’, Journal of Modern Literature, 31:4: (2008), 129.\n\n[12] Carter, Nights at the Circus, p. 46.\n\n[13] Mikhail, Bakhtin, Rabelais and His World (Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1968), p. 304.\n\n[14] Carter, Nights at the Circus, p. 23.\n\n[15] Carter, Nights at the Circus, p. 41.\n\n[16] Carter, Nights at the Circus, p. 17.\n\n[17] Paulina, Palmer ‘Bird Women: Angela Carter’s Magical Flight’ in Women Reading Women’s Writing (Brighton: Harvestor, 1987), p. 43.\n\n[18] Dennis, ‘The Spectacle of Her Gluttony’, p. 131.\n\n[19] Carter, Nights at the Circus, p. 22.\n\n[20] Peter, Lewis, The Fifties (New York: William Heinemann, 1978), pp. 7-8.\n\n[21] Susan, Bennett, ‘New Plays and Women’s Voices in the 1950s’ in The Cambridge Companion to Modern British Women Playwrights (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 38.\n\n[22] Peter, Barry, Beginning Theory (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2009), p. 186.\n\n[23] Barry, Beginning Theory, p. 186.\n\n[24] Shelagh, Delaney, A Taste of Honey (New York: Grove Press, 1980), p. 73.\n\n[25] Delaney, A Taste of Honey, p. 66."
