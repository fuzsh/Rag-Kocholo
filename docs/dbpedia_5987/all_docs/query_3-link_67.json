        "text": "The prevailing styles of 1940s fashion? Well, that depends. Stylistically, the decade began with one look (fueled by wartime make-do-and-mend attitudes) and ended with an entirely other New Look (a chic-for-chic’s-sake celebration).\n\nOf the former, this somber excerpt from Vogue’s February 1, 1943, issue encapsulates the mood around consumption in the early decade: “By the time this issue of Vogue appears, a new type of currency will be coming into circulation in the United States. Not plastic pennies or a new series of banknotes, but rationing stamps.”\n\nThroughout World War II’s six-year span and several years beyond, various measures were taken to conserve resources and ration clothing to better equip the war efforts and recovery throughout Europe. In Paris, especially during the German Occupation, the couture industry was tightly regulated. In Great Britain, extreme wartime and postwar rations were imposed on textiles and leather goods, whereas in the US fabrics were a little less scarce due to domestic cotton production. The biggest trend at the start of the 1940s was utility dressing. It was not just a descriptor of fashion void of frivolous details; it became its own category of clothing. In Great Britain, the government launched a Utility Clothing Scheme known as CC41, enlisting top designers of the moment, like Hardy Amies, Digby Morton, Charles Frederick Worth, and Edward Molyneux, to design a capsule collection following the restrictions on fashion.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Paris, French designers took back the helms of fashion and steered the decade in a new direction. Once Christian Dior in 1947 showcased an unabashed use of textiles in a wasp-waisted feminine silhouette that recalled the 18th century, the era’s practicality was forgotten. Fashion is a gorgeously fickle thing.\n\nWomen’s Trends of the 1940s\n\nThe Rise of the Utility Suit\n\nMenswear-Inspired Skirt Suits for Women\n\nBy the start of the war, the bias-cut satins and chiffons dominating 1930s fashion were quickly phased out; silk and even artificial silk were largely reserved for the war efforts. Instead, practical fashion was dominated by little waste required in its production, epitomized by the rise of the woolen skirt suits for women.\n\nWhile the skirt suit was not a novel fashion item, the stark, menswear-inspired tailoring was. The overall silhouette was narrow and slim: Shoulders were accentuated but not exaggerated, and waists were slightly nipped. Adornments came in the form of military elements like belts and breast pockets.\n\nThe look was ubiquitous. Vogue announced the “Uniform of 1942” as the “Tailored Suit” in its January 15, 1942, issue. “A suit to work in, serve in, live in, all through the busy daylight hours of your new double-duty life,” it explained.\n\nShirtwaist Dresses Reigned\n\nDubbed the Kitty Foyle Dress\n\nBefore the New Look, if there was one silhouette that ruled the 1940s, it was the knee-length shirtwaist dress—specifically one with a contrasting collar and caps on the sleeves. A version of this dress was worn by Ginger Rogers in the film Kitty Foyle, and it has since been dubbed the Kitty Foyle dress.\n\nAesthetically, the shirtwaist offered bang for your buck: Its simple A-line skirt required little volume but still looked polished, and the collar added visual interest without much extra material. It was prim without looking overly fussy—essentially a practical dress that wasn’t at odds with the sobering times. Plus, it was the style championed by American and British authorities.\n\nIn an article titled “Shirtwaist Revival” in Vogue’s March 15, 1943, issue, the copy reads: “The shirtwaist look is a right look for this spring. W.P.B. likes it—so will you.” (The W.P.B. being the War Production Board established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in January 1942 following Pearl Harbor.)\n\nHats Shrunk, Shoes Grew\n\nAccessories Got Inventive\n\nA scarcity of traditional fashion fabrics during the war meant designers and at-home sewers needed to get scrappy. At the time, hats, still a somewhat mandatory accouterment for a woman, shrunk in size. They were worn askew at an angle and crafted from a variety of materials, from felt to straw. Snoods and turbans also fell into fashion, prized for their practicality—they kept women’s hair out of the way in factories and looked superb with a dress.\n\nShoes were sturdy: Toes were rounded, and heels were substantial. Leather was in short supply, and thus alternative materials came into fashion, like cork and espadrilles. Vogue’s January 1, 1944, issue touted “Unrationed Raffia Shoes” that were “Footloose and Ration-free.”\n\nUnexpected materials continued to proliferate in fashion; in 1947 Guccio Gucci famously gave us the curved bamboo-handle bag.\n\nThe Rise of American Designers\n\nNew York Was Put on the Fashion Map\n\nIn a few lines, the February 1, 1941, issue of Vogue captures the state of fashion succinctly:\n\n“Since the fall of Paris, the influence of many of the last great French Collections which we saw has hung on. But in the past seven months, American designers—clothes, fabric, shoes, hat, jewelry designers—have come far; learned much; caught their breath; recovered a little from their first nervousness, their first protestations that ‘we aren’t afraid of the dark’.… Though we continue to import British designs from Molyneux and Creed and others, the most recent developments in fashion have stemmed from our own imaginations.”\n\nWithout Paris, the US looked inward for fashion direction. Designers like Norman Norell, Bonnie Cashin, Tom Brigance, Rudi Gernreich, Gilbert Adrian, and Claire McCardell rose in profile. McCardell’s pivotal “Pop-over” dress, which was originally introduced as a $7 Utility garment in 1940, marked the beginning of American sportswear: easy, practical, yet uncompromisingly stylish.\n\nHollywood Set Trends\n\nAnd Katharine Hepburn Wore the Pants\n\nThroughout the 1940s, Hollywood pictures offered as much fashion to feast on as a magazine. Films like A Philadelphia Story, Gilda, and The Big Sleep gave us screen sirens who wore clothes with more command than your average mannequin. Actors like Rita Hayworth, Veronica Lake, Lauren Bacall, and Ingrid Bergman were outfitted by the likes of costume designers such as Gilbert Adrian, Edith Head, Orry-Kelly, and Jean Louis, and their collaborations went down in fashion history—perhaps no one more so than Katharine Hepburn, who boldly wore a tuxedo in Woman of the Year in 1942 (costumed by Adrian Adolph Greenberg) and made strides for women while doing so.\n\nThe Return of Paris Postwar\n\nAll about Théâtre de la Mode\n\nAs Parisian fashion existed in a Nazi-sealed vacuum during the German Occupation of Paris, upon liberation Parisian fashion designers were eager to reclaim their voice and announce to the world that they were back and ready to dress it. With resources in short supply, Lucien Lelong, then president of the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, banded together 40 couturiers (Balenciaga, Schiaparelli, Paquin, Jean Patou, Hermès, Madame Grès, and Nina Ricci among them) for a collaborative fashion show of dolls (smaller bodies meant less fabric!) that would travel the world. The show, “Théâtre de la Mode”, was a love letter to Paris, from Paris, and gave the cities it traveled to—Barcelona, London, Leeds, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Vienna, New York, and San Francisco—a preview of postwar fashion.\n\nMen’s Trends of the 1940s\n\nDuring the start of the 1940s, men’s suits followed the trend of slim fits (the product of clothing rations). Double-breasted suits popular during the 1920s and 1930s became single-breasted, and the waistcoat was all but abolished, seen as an unnecessary element. Turn-ups on the hems of pants were also 86’d under certain rationing protocols.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, extreme attention was paid to the zoot suit, which controversially billowed with excess fabric. With roots in the drape suits seen on Harlem stages in the 1930s to accentuate performers’ movements, the suit style became popular with Black, Mexican American, and Latino men who found tailors to take in oversized suits to their frames. As the style was at odds with the prevailing less-is-more tailoring, it became a fashion for the counterculture, but it was not celebrated by all. In Los Angeles in July 1943, the look fueled racial tensions between white sailors, marines, law enforcement, and zoot-suit wearers that culminated in a week of violent riots, the Zoot Suit Riots."
