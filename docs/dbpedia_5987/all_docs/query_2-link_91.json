        "text": "1. The evolution of ACTION GENRE Martelle Kumar\n\n2. Over the years these high energy films have made some changes.\n\n3. EARLY ACTION 1920’s- 1930’s 1920's to the 1930's the predominant films were classic swashbuckling movies where heroes would battle villains with the swords. Heros like Douglas Fairbanks as a \"Swashbuckler“ Swashbuckler films are an action-adventure subgenre often characterised by swordfighting and adventurous heroic characters. Mainly set in Western Europe in the period between the late Renaissance and the age of reason with appropriately lavish costumes. 1940’s-1950’s In the 40's and 50's War Movies, Cowboy Movies, and Spy Adventure Films took the stage as the top action films of the time.\n\n4. Early action WHY The leap from sword fighting to spy movies/western styled films in early action may be because of the change in culture. Spy and western were more realistic than sword fighting. The costumes became more normal and associated to the theme, it therefore became more realistic to the audience\n\n5. EARLY ACTION 1960’s During the 60's it was Ian Fleming's larger than life creation, James Bond. Inspired by american thrillers and British-American action-adventure. James Bond dominated the 60's. Its larger than life characters and ‘one man army’ appealed to every man. As well as the car chases, weapons, futuristic gadgets and fist fights. Woman were brought in for narrative and popular attractive male’s.\n\n6. EARLY ACTION 1970’s The 70’s introduced a gritty dectective and urban crime dramas which shaped the a new ‘action style’ Movies like Dirty Harry (1971) featured the convention of intense car chase inspired by the popular stunt work in previous the Bond films. Action dismissed western themes and offered just as much glamour, excitement, and potential for violence. These films brought an end of the prolific \"cowboys and Indians\" era of film westerns. Along with this change came the major introduction to Martial Arts Action. Movies like You Only Live Twice, enter the Dragon became popular\n\n7. DEVELOPING ACTION 1970’S A gate way to a new culture was exposed as audiences were fascinated by martial art films in 1970’s The cross-pollenization of genres (such as spy-films and war movies, or westerns and detective dramas) would become the norm in the 1980s. It should also be noted however, that the 1970s saw the introduction of martial-arts film to western audiences.\n\n8. DEVELOPING ACTION COW BOY TO COPS Again the genre made changes to cater to the far from niche audience. The gritty cop feel became popular because it was within belief. The bond era created a new field to see authority and underground villains. martial art films in 1970’s brought in a new audience as crowds were wow’d by something new\n\n9. EARLY ACTION 1980’s The 1980s would see the action film take over Hollywood to become a dominant form of summer blockbuster. The \"the action era\" popularized by strong male. Rising comedian like Eddie Murphy smashed box office records with the action-comedy in 48hrs. Movies like lethal weapons proved that low-budget plots could attract millions. The one man army still maintained to attracted loads but the add of a ‘side kick’ who added humour made the genre more appealing to more.\n\n10. Shaping ACTION More family friendly? The comedy elements in action has increased to attract more audience. Action with comedy makes an action movie more accessible for more females and a younger audience as its takes less stress from the fast paced action throughout the film. More ethnic groups were introduced to action movies to attract more the one man army theme also attracted more and more as well known Hollywood stars began appearing in films.\n\n11. ACTION 1990’s The 90’s became and era of sequels to the successful action movies from the 80’s. Hybrid action was also created; western films were joined by spy movies and urban action parody movies. The revolution in CGI (computer generated imagery) changed the “real-world\" settings become new futuristic environments. The success of the many Dirty Harry and James Bond sequels had proven that a single successful action film could lead to a continuing action franchise. The80s and 90s saw a rise in both budgets and the number of sequels a film could generally have. Where in earlier decades, sequels were frowned upon by most these times had successful outcomes. The success of Batman (1989) led to a string of financially successful sequels, and within a single decade, had proven the viability of a new sub-genre of action film; the comic- book movie."
