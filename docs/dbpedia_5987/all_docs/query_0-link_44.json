        "text": "Situated in an obscure city, a hard-drinking detective, clad in a fedora and ill-matching suit, broods over an intricate enigma â this quintessential image from Film Noir still permeates modern cinema and TV.Â\n\nFirst popularized in the 1940s and 50s, Film Noir has now significantly evolved, encompassing films as diverse as Chinatown, The Dark Knight, and Fargo. The ambiguous nature of Noir, as a genre, aesthetic, mood, or mindset, remains a source of intrigue.\n\nIn this article, weâre going to act like a Noir detective and attempt to solve the mystery of what is film noir together.\n\nThe basics of Film Noir\n\nLetâs start with the basics and the first obvious clue. Film Noir sounds French, but itâs used to describe lots of American films. Hereâs why.\n\nAfter World War 2, film was a booming interest in film culture in France. A new breed of critics enamored with American films noticed patterns in the crime films of the day, particularly those coming out of America.Â\n\nThese films would typically feature a disillusioned central protagonist, a truth-finder (not always a detective) who gets wrapped up in mysteries of sex, death, and murder. Theyâd rarely end happily, and were drenched in expressionistic dark lighting.\n\nHence Film Noir, which in English means âBlack Filmâ. Itâs not only a reference to the moody visual aesthetics of these films, but also the kind of stories theyâd tell. Some have speculated that Noir genre films expressed a growing disillusionment with notions like the American Dream and American Exceptionalism. Instead of clean-cut heroes, these films tried to show the reality of what living in Urban America was really like.Â\n\nThe archetypical example of this kind of noir film is The Maltese Falcon starring Humphrey Bogart. Bogart plays Sam Spade, a private investigator who gets wrapped up in a sinister conspiracy about the titular falcon.Â\n\nThe film typifies Noirâs fundamental elements of crime, lust, and a tragic ending.Â\n\nWhat are the tropes of Film Noir?\n\nLike any genre, Noir has its repertoire of tropes that itâs worth knowing to help you identify a Noir film, and also if you plan to write your own. Though, itâs worth bearing in mind that these tropes have evolved massively in modernity which weâll get into a little later.Â\n\nThe private investigator\n\nThough a Noir film doesnât have to have a detective or investigator in a central role, itâs a very common device. This makes a lot of sense considering you may want to have a protagonist who will be motivated to diving deep into the seedy underbelly of the city. A P.I. is the easiest way to cohere protagonist motivation and genre together.Â\n\nThe Big Sleep is the prime example of this kind of character. Based on the novel by Raymond Chandler, the king of Noir fiction, Humphrey Bogart plays Philip Marlowe, a P.I. with as many wisecracks in his arsenal as cigarettes in his pocket.Â\n\nThe dangerous woman\n\nNoir has a complicated relationship with gender. Like a lot of genres conceived of in this era, it is very male-dominated. Instead, women are generally consigned to love interest roles.Â\n\nHowever, these women are rarely straightforward. Like everyone in Noir, they have their own angle. As Roger Ebert says, Noir is full of âwomen who would just as soon kill you as love youâ.Â\n\nRebecca is a really interesting version of this trope that interrogates it very early in Noirâs life-cycle. For a more straightforward depiction of the dangerous woman, you canât go wrong with Double Indemnity.Â\n\nCorrupt cops and criminals\n\nThereâs no such thing as a good guy in Noir. The 1940s and 50s was generally an era of cops versus robbers, good guys versus bad guys. Noir dismisses this out of hand. Authorities are corrupt, and criminals have just as much code as the cops.Â\n\nOrson Wellesâs Touch of Evil is a great example of this trope while being a fantastic film in its own right.\n\nThe voiceover\n\nStemming from Noirâs history in pulp novels before it made it to film, the voiceover is usually performed by the leading investigator who makes sly remarks and somewhat convoluted metaphors ripped straight from the sour novelâs prose.\n\nMoodiness\n\nThereâs no happy endings in Noir. Every single frame drips with moody glumness or introspection. This is the genre to ponder concepts of morality and purpose, not joyful abandon. There are often many shots of the protagonist mulling over lifeâs big questions with a stiff drink in one hand and a cigarette in the other.Â\n\nThe Night of the Hunter drips with so much atmosphere and mood that it beggars belief. With lighting so expressionistic that it begins to take on the impression of a vaguely defined nightmare, thereâs no better expression of just how much moodiness can be extracted through Noirâs particular way of shooting scenes.\n\nThe fatalistic philosophy\n\nThe biggest life lesson we can take from a Noir film, itâs that life isnât fair. Justice is illusive. In the end, all an individual can really do in an unfair system is to look out for themselves, even if that means bending the rules a little.Â\n\nChinatown is the prime example of this. The filmâs final scene is so fatalistic that its final piece of dialog has gone down in movie history for summing it up so succinctly.Â\n\nHow has Noir evolved?\n\nNoir is not a static genre. In fact, in the past decade or two it has experienced a pretty notable upsurge in popularity. Thereâs not enough time to get really in-depth, so instead here are a films that have evolved the Noir framework in interesting ways.Â Now let's examine some of Film Noir.\n\nGastlight\n\nGaslight came out in 1944, but it has accrued a massive new following in the late 2010s/early 2020s on account of the term âgaslightingâ which it inspired. Taking a much more sympathetic look towards a womanâs experience within the Noir genre, this film is a must watch to better understand how gender functions in Noir and the malevolent depths it can reach.\n\nDrive\n\nThe progenitor of the prestige art-film subgenre that began to flourish in the 2010s, this Nicolas Winding Refn film took the Noir aesthetics and turned the volume up to 11, infusing the color scheme of Drive with lush neons and luxurious dark blues. A story of crime and love, dripping with style with an enigmatic protagonist. Yep. Itâs Noir.\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\n\nThe offshoot of Noir stemming from an influx of popular Scandinavian authors who concocted twisted noir thrillers surged in popularity in the 2000s onwards, stemming new household names like Stieg Larsson, Jo Nesbo, Camilla Lackberg. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was first made in Sweden, then remade by David Fincher in 2011.Â\n\nUnder the Silver Lake\n\nThis strange metamodern opus infuses the coolness of the Noir protagonist into a strange central man who is a loner obsessed with cultural symbols and finding patterns in modern L.A. that may or may not be there. This is Noir when brought into our hyper-modern interconnected world and the results are as messy as they are compelling.\n\nJohn Wick\n\nAction-noir is definitely an active subgenre, and none more successful than John Wick. Heâs an enigmatic protagonist who exudes cool in a world of crime infused with expressionistic lighting and a propensity for fatalistic outcomes.Â\n\nThe main difference is the sheer tenacity of the action, an element notably missing from early Noir.Â\n\nLevel up your Film Noir screenwriting skills"
