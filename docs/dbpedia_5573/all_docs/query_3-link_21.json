        "text": "Share\n\nI chanced upon Rolo Tomassi via a review in The Guardian and subsequently bought their latest album Where Myth Becomes Memory. Then I liked that album so much I bought a ticket for their show in my local venue—the Willem 2 in Den Bosch.\n\nRolo Tomassi is one of those bands that embody the concept of elusiveness. Moving between somber piano notes accompanied with dreamlike songlines and massive power chords—often heavily distorted—and agonised screams at top volume and almost everything in between, the band is walking the tightrope between sheer noise and crisp clarity the band delivers a musical chiaroscuro like nobody else. “An authentic, elegent symbiosis of contrasting extremes,” as Written in Music captures it. How much you like this differs very much on your personal taste—even more so than normal, because of all the intense yet intentional contrasts—and personally, after a few runthroughs of the album, I was mesmerised.\n\nAnd it’s not just the music, but also the singing and the lyrics, where singer Eva Korman effortlessly switches from a primal scream to an angelic incantation, from rage against the dying light to acceptance of the numinous. Rolo Tomassi’s lyrics are just as hard to pinpoint as their music, so let’s just say that to me—while everybody else’s interpretation is equally valid—they evoke tragedy & loss in combination with coping & transformation.\n\nBut that’s not all. Their visual presentation stood out, as well. While many a musician stands on stage with a certain amount of unease—you know the type, they look like they’d rather perform from behind a screen—the musicians of Rolo Tomassi stay in the dark on purpose. An image—or movie—is projected on the back wall at the centre of the stage and singer Eva Korman basically performs in front of it, while the rest of the band is barely visible (see also some of my pictures).\n\nWhile you hear the—highly dynamic—music, you see the silhouette of Eva Korman dancing, headbanging, shadowfighting and, well, performing the songs as her voice moves from and back without a glitch. This works, not in the least because Eva Korman performs with gusto and bravado in front of such an audio-visual presentation.\n\nKorman is such a performer with a magnetic presence and a hypnotising aura that would have drawn all attention her way even without the light show that was tailored to her. With it, you almost forgot that there were other band members who also delivered a very solid performance, albeit well out of the spotlight. I suspect most of them are perfectly fine with that, so they can concentrate on their playing while Korman captures the public’s attention. So much I must admit that I thought that the keyboards were run from a player (‘tape’ is already so old-fashioned) until I finally discerned the silhouette of an actual keyboard player, way in the back.\n\nSo it was all ‘live’, as it should be.\n\nLuckily for me, the songs of Where Myth Becomes Memory formed the majority of the set, yet the show was so good, so spellbinding that I greatly enjoyed the songs from Grievances and Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It as well. Stand-out songs for me:\n\n“Cloaked” has these almost-jumping-backwards time signatures that Code Orange also uses to great effect (especially on Underneath, and ‘I’ll come out from underneath to understand’—from “To Resist Forgetting”—might capture the feel of the lyrics best). Immense walls of guitars are interspersed with atmospheric interludes, menace with delicacy, distortion with clarity, with some sublime drums. And it stops just as abruptly as Code Orange’s “Erasure Scan”. This how modern metal should be, but rarely is.\n\n“Labyrinthine” also has that contrary vibe where the guitars seem to go in a different direction than the drums. And yet marching against each other somehow works. A good labyrinth to get lost in.\n\nThe build-up in “To Resist Forgetting” seems almost normal, until the shift to subtlety sets in and the return to heaviness begins to feel natural. And am I the only one who thinks a clean sung chorus in a wall of noise works better than screaming? Of course, the seraphic chants are interspersed with desperate screams, and again, it just works.\n\nWalls of heavily distorted guitars mercilessly knocked down by arhythmic snare beats mark the arrival of “Drip”. It should be irritating, nauseating, unbearable yet it combines into a whole that’s more than the sum of its parts. A sonic inferno that puts the crown on a mesmerising perfomance, one of the very best shows of the year.\n\nBoth their latest album Where Myth Becomes Memory and this live performance seem to mark that Rolo Tomassi has reached a certain pinnacle in their musical journey. Which makes it all the more interesting in where they’ll be going next. I, for one, will be following them with great interest.\n\nSetlist:\n\nAlmost Always (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nCloaked (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nTo Resist Forgetting (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nLabyrinthine (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nRituals (Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It);\n\nOpalescent (Grievances);\n\nStage Knives (Grievances);\n\nAftermath (Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It);\n\nA Flood of Light (Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It);\n\nMutual Ruin (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nContretemps (Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It);\n\nPrescience (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nDrip (Where Myth Becomes Memory);\n\nAuthor’s note: a review originally planned for October, I know. As always, life intervened and threw a small spanner in the works. Catching up fast now and I do intend to close off the year with everything published as promised. Essays will remain to be the unplanned part of this substack, making them both more timely and unpredictable. I have a few lined up, while I’m holding a further few in reserve because they link in with short stories that are slated to be published (but delayed, oh well). Welcome, new subscribers and thanks for reading!"
