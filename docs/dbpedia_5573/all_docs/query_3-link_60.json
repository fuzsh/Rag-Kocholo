Yet in all that time, he has remained something of an enigma; rarely appearing in interviews beyond a short quote. Quite frankly, we’d had enough of not knowing.\n\nREAD MORE: Introducing… Black Country, New Road, the experimental act turning British rock inside out\n\nThough the release of sixth album Where Myth Becomes Memory is the hot topic of our conversation, we ask Chris to take us back to the beginning, specifically the moment he realised he’d be crucial in ushering in a new era of one of the most genre-defying bands on the scene."
