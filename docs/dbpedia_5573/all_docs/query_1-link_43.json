For the uninitiated, you can catch yourself up to speed with this retrospective. Says frontwoman Eva Spence, \"At 10 years in I feel more enthused than ever with where we’re at as a band. With Grievances, we followed on from the sound we developed on Astraea and pushed that even more so to make an album we’re all really proud of and which I consider to be our best material to date.\" Though their June shows are sold out, you can catch the band in August with Fall of Troy. You can find tickets for all those shows here."
