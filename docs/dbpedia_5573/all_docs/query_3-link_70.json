        "text": "It is a known fact, that each time Rolo Tomassi bring out a new album, it is incredibly better than the one previously before it. And with their new album 'Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It', out this Friday, this one sees them pushing what they do best to a completely new level.\n\nThe album is probably the most tightest thing Rolo Tomassi has released, but don't see this as them cleaning up their sound, as they still hold on to that chaotic style that we adore about this band. The album has some amazing beautiful moments, as it opens into a more colorful side of the band, especially with the track 'Aftermath'. However we are soon thrown back into the chaos with 'Rituals'\n\nLike every great record, you need to take time to take it in, and we feel this is one of those albums. Up front, it is a good album, but if you look deeper into it, it is a fantastic piece of musical art. You need to look at the complexities of it, the adventure it takes you, because it certainly is a ride. Rolo Tomassi always push themselves with each album release, but this time it is different. It sees them colorful but yet heavy at the same time.\n\nOne thing for certain, this album is going to push Rolo Tomassi to a new level this year!\n\nThe band are on tour this March/April, catch them at the following dates -\n\nMarch 27th - Randal - Bratislava\n\nMarch 28th - Robot City - Budapest\n\nMarch 29th - Nova Chmelnice - Prague\n\nMarch 30th - Musik & Frieden - Berlin, Germany\n\nMarch 31st - Headcrash - Hamburg, Germany\n\nApril 1st - Patronaat - Haarlem, The Netherlands\n\nApril 3rd - Audio - Glasgow\n\nApril 4th - Deaf Institute - Manchester\n\nApril 5th - Asylum 2 - Birmingham\n\nApril 6th - The Exchange - Bristol\n\nApril 7th - The Garage - London\n\nApril 8th - Strangeforms Fest - Leeds\n\nWords by Ant Adams"
