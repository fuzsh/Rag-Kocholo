It is the follow up to their critically acclaimed 2018 album, Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It. The group is known for their sonic and energetic live performances, as well as their stark and consistent artistic aesthetic.\n\nVocalist Eva Spence is one of the most dynamic and varied vocalists in the progressive metal scene, her gorgeous cleans and guttural screams are truly unique.\n\nTheir new record, Where Myth Becomes Memory, is a grand display of immaculate musicianship, intricate songwriting, and raw emotion. There is a consistent theme throughout the record which is accompanied by a hauntingly beautiful grand piano. The attention to detail in the recording is astonishing, as you can hear the individual cadence of each key being pressed in. The album\n\nfeels like a living, breathing work of art.\n\nThroughout Where Myth Becomes Memory, you find Rolo Tomassi moving through elements of mathcore, post- metal, prog, classical, ambient and experimental.\n\nThe band can be broadly described as progressive metal, and specifically defined as experimental mathcore.\n\nLP2 Coloured LP - Translucent Galaxy Tracks: Almost Always / Cloaked / Mutual Ruin / Labyrinthine / Closer / Drip / Prescience / Stumbling / To Resist Forgetting / The End Of Eternity\n\nMore From This Artist:"
