        "text": "SOURCE – So, you have a new album coming up titled Where Myth Becomes Memory, and it’s one of my most anticipated albums of the year. Can you talk about the direction of the album, what you were trying to achieve and how the process was for it?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – Thank-you! The direction of the album continues the path we took with Time Will Die… I think it builds on it quite naturally. We wanted to take what we liked best from that album and continue to develop further the ideas that worked best. In terms of what we were looking to achieve, we wanted to make another album we were proud of. In terms of the process, it was obviously different to how we might normally operate because of the pandemic. We had to develop ideas a lot more via email and remotely. Overall I think this probably helped the writing process! We took things a lot more slowly and had to be patient.\n\nSOURCE – How does Where Myth Becomes Memory differ from your previous albums, how is it similar?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – I think the focus, more than ever, is on the individual songs. I spoke with someone recently who described it as episodic which I liked. We’ve pushed the contrasting styles even further this time round. The heavier elements are harder and more brutal than ever. There is much more space for the minimal side to what we do and the piano led sections. I think it’s similar in that its expansive, creative and ambitious. It just does everything to a much higher level.\n\nSOURCE – So could you explain what this album is about lyrically?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – The themes for this record are renewal, rebirth and new beginnings. Eva wanted to try and have a more positive tone to the record overall. I think the general aim was to balance out the negativity and emotional weight on the last record.\n\nSOURCE – In your mind, what kinds of themes or emotions do you think the music is expressing?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – That’s a great question! For me, the lighter, cleaner moments all feel quite nostalgic. I’m not sure nostalgia is an emotion but I certainly feel that way when I listen back to it. A lot of the heavier elements to the record feel full of frustration and are definitely a cathartic release to play. The record is filled with vital energy throughout it.\n\nSOURCE – Are there plans for a traditional video for that song or any others on the album?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – We have released videos for Cloaked and Drip already and there is one more that’s due to come in January. Keep an eye on our social media!\n\nSOURCE – Have you experienced any differences in how the foreign press treats you and the band compared to how native press and media treats and writes about you?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – It’s not something I’ve really considered before. I don’t feel like there’s a HUGE difference about what we’re asked. When you’re promoting an album, most interviews are variations on the same themes.\n\nSOURCE – If Rolo Tomassi were to disappear tomorrow, what album would you want to be remembered for?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – I think I would simply want to be remembered for the music we’ve made. I know that’s quite simple but it would be more than enough.\n\nSOURCE – That would be all for this time, thank you for the interview, and I wish you all the best! Your last message to fans over here?\n\nJames Spence – (Keyboards, vocals) – Thank-you for the interview! Stay safe, big love to anyone in Brazil who is interested in our band. We would love to make it over one day. I’ll keep my fingers crossed.\n\nCONTACTS:\n\nROLO TOMASSI\n\nROLO TOMASSI FACEBOOK"
