        "text": "Man this band legitimately write great songs. Hoping they go even further with the duality. Feel like they’re going to really make a significant dent in the scene - so excited for their career, and even their material afterwards (if they unfortunately break up)\n\nAre the other bands on this tour worth sticking around for? I don’t pay attention much to this scene, but this record definitely caught my attention, and I’m thinking I might catch the show here tomorrow night because why not.\n\nrolo tomassi is insane\n\nsome really interesting ideas on this record. wish things came together a bit smoother sometimes, the transitions from different sounding parts leave something to be desired at times. but other times like on title track it’s pulled off well. also on that one the vocals sound like letlive lol\n\nIt’s Hayden from FYH on that track screaming at times\n\nAgreed on the transitions sometimes, that's what made it a little more chaotic than I want. Gonna keep spinning this and see if the songs grow on me. Star Baby has been stuck in my head though!\n\nSeriously. All of Star Baby is so damn catchy.\n\nShow last night was absolutely insane. Their Van apparently broke down on the way and they were late but still made it and it was worth the wait.\n\nRight up there with star baby for song of the year"
