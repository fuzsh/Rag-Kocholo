        "text": "It’s been 10 years since Rolo Tomassi released their debut LP ‘Hysterics‘, and with several line up changes along the way, it’s been a long and winding road for the band. Here they arrive in 2018 still treasured within the UK’s heavy scene, bringing with them their latest long player ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It‘. Although still a techy, riffy affair, previous effort ‘Grievances‘ brought a more melodic, post-rock tone into focus for Rolo Tomassi, which made for some of their most uplifting work to date. I am definitely eager to hear if this is explored more on their fifth album.\n\nThe opening two tracks are massively unexpected. ‘Towards Dawn‘ is nearly four minutes of reversed synth sounds and is a dreamy, soundscape of an intro. You just don’t know if it’s gonna kick into some mad, bone crushing riff, and it doesn’t. Instead it leads into ‘Aftermath‘, which is basically Rolo Tomassi’s attempt at a pop tune. It’s all glittering synths, massive post-rock guitars with huge, space-shaking harmonies. On paper it shouldn’t work, but it totally does! It’s a beautiful, epic track which makes me wonder if making a big old pop album in future might be worth Rolo looking into.\n\nFrom then on in, it’s pretty much business as usual as they get stuck into their progressive brand of hardcore. It’s all chunky, angular riffs, blood curdling screams mixed with exciting, theatrical shifts, whether it’s the jazz breakdown of ‘Balancing The Dark‘ or the tech metal meets synth pop punch of ‘Alma Matter‘. Although this is what Rolo have always done, everything seems more exaggerated here. It’s still clever, but there’s not as much noodling and both the heavier and quieter sections have a lot more breathing space. It takes out the beard scratching a bit and opens up the melodic palette, whilst also opening the pit.\n\nThere’s quite a few lengthier tracks which act as an expansion on the heavy/quiet foundation the band have built on throughout their career. ‘A Flood Of Light‘, ‘Whispers Among Us‘ and ‘Contretemps‘ all weave between earth-crushing drums, thick guitars and fearless growls with more expansive, reverb soaked passages, gentle, clean vocals and sweeping, space age synth swirls. I get that the band are trying to stretch things out a bit here to create a bigger impact, but I do find the build ups a little too long in places.\n\nFor me, it’s when Rolo just give it us plain and simple that it really gets a hold on me and closing track ‘Risen‘ is a beautiful ballad of guitars, keyboards and vocals which is simple and stunning in its execution. They’ve always had pretty bits in their tunes, but this album proves what they’ve become as songwriters and sonic sculptors.\n\nRolo Tomassi are still very much pushing themselves as a unit on each new release and ‘Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It‘ is definitely their most widescreen affair. Never have the more serene moments of their sound felt so sincere and beautiful. I did find the album too long as a whole, with some compositions over staying their welcome a little bit. But on the other hand, there’s a few tracks on here that I would consider some of the band’s most memorable and affecting work to date. With this bigger, sparkling sound, this could well be Rolo Tomassi’s crossover moment."
