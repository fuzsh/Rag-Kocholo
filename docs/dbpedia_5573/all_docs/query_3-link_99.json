        "text": "Your music has been described as ‘too metal for indie kids and too indie for metal kids’ which I think is a load of shite but how would you describe the music you make?\n\nWe’ve settled on the term ‘progressive hardcore’ We don’t want to shy away from the term ‘prog’, which I think a lot of modern artists do, as a lot of our influences are based in that genre. With regards to metal, none of us has a huge background of listening to metal really…\n\nHow old were you all when you first started rolo and what what did you initially intend your music to sound like?\n\nWhen we first started we wanted to make really fast, harsh and short songs. We’d all just started listening to super aggressive music and thought it was awesome and that we were being really controversial by playing 30 second songs. Obviously, that wasn’t the case at all but it was fun at the time.\n\nHow do you think the music you make has changed since then?\n\nThe songs are a lot more developed and, dare it say it, mature. We have a much clearer idea of how we want the band to sound now and are all in a much better position to get the best out of our instruments individually.\n\nGoing way back you played guitar on Oli Sykes’ electronic project; how many tracks did you record and what originally made you want to collaborate?\n\nI spent a fair bit of time with Oli and he was really keen to make different music to what BMTH were doing at the time. This was a long long time ago, probably around the time they released their first EP. We did a couple of practices and maybe recorded 2 or 3 songs. It was just fun, jamming out music that was totally different to what we were both doing with our respective bands.\n\nYou used to write and record your own acoustic music; what were your influences for that and why did you decide to stop?\n\nI stopped mainly because I wanted to be thoroughly focused on Rolo Tomassi. The acoustic thing was a stop gap for me inbetween the first band I did splitting and RT starting. I wanted to carry on making music. My influences were stuff like Owen, Death Cab, Jejune and Christie Front Drive.\n\nHysterics has been out for almost a year now. When do you think Rolo Tomassi LP number two will be released and will there be much change musically?\n\nWe’re writing the second record now with the view to have it out in early 2010. Musically, what we have so far continues in the direction we took with Hysterics but leans towards the more jazz/groove styles in songs like Fofteen and Beatrotter but its still early days and I can’t predict how the whole record will sound!\n\nWhat did you initially think when more mainstream magazines such as NME began to show an interest in your music?\n\nI was shocked and surprised more than anything. Considering how we sounded and that we were doing small shows that we booked ourselves, it was strange that they wanted to cover us.\n\nDo you get annoyed by the fact that a lot of people only seem to concentrate on the fact that Eva can be female and scream at the same time?\n\nIt’s an odd one that I’m sure people will never drop. As boring as it is to see written down, if it means people remember our band then so be it.\n\nYou played endlessly and played as a session musician with I was a Cub Scout, do you think you will ever collaborate with either Todd or Will in the future?\n\nI’m still in touch with both of them following the split and they both have their own projects going on now. Since all that happened our band has become much more of a full time thing and especially right now with our focus being writing our new album, I’m not sure I’ll have much time to collaborate! We’re still in regular contact though and Todd is great for advice about keyboards so I guess in that way we’re almost still working together…\n\nSo far, what has been the highest high from playing with tomassi?\n\nGetting to go to America was unreal. On a more basic level just the notion of getting to tour really often still blows my mind.\n\nand what has been the lowest low?\n\nI can’t think of much really… Maybe getting turned away from shows we turned up to play because we were too young at the time.\n\nThe last time I saw you play there were countless people showing the metal sign to your music; do you think that the reaction from the crowd has changed recently and do you think different people have started turning up to your shows that wouldn’t have previously?\n\nYeah it’s strange how it’s changed. I think the metal horns is something that mainly happens at bigger shows and is a characteristic of more commercial heavy music. When we’re being covered by magazines like Kerrang it’s not that surprising to see it at our shows and I don’t really mind. If someone wants to show they’re having a good time by banging their head and throwing the horns its fine by me.\n\nWhat initially got you in to keyboards and synthesizers?\n\nI’ve played piano since I was about nine but band wise, I was fascinated by all the keyboard sounds on the first Murder of… 7″ and it made me want to add that element to our band. More so recently I’ve gotten into a lot more synth heavy bands like M83 and Goblin. I think there’s something about keyboards and synthesizers in terms of atmospherics that you cant make using a guitar. It adds an almost cinematic feel to the music and with the sound we’re going for that’s what we want.\n\nWhat is your set-up keyboard/synth-wise?\n\nCurrently I use a Yamaha CS5 and a Microkorg live going through Boss MetalZone, Boss DD6 and an Akai Headrush 2 pedals. I recently bought a Roland RS 09 and will no doubt be using that in the new material and in future live sets.\n\nWhat are your top five albums?\n\nThis is a question that would take me forever to answer truthfully. I’d have to go through all manner of processes to establish it so I’ll do my recent top 5/top 5 I’ve been listening to lately:\n\nThe Shitty Limits – Beware The Limits\n\nFinal Fantasy – He Poos Clouds\n\nGoblin – The Goblin Collection\n\nArchitects – Hollow Crown\n\nThe Maccabees – Wall Of Arms\n\nWhat does it feel like deserting the beautiful, picturesque hills of Stocksbridge for Nottingham Shottingham?\n\nAwesome! It’s great to walk 10 minutes from my house and be in a city centre and have everything so close. It’s a fun place to live but I’ll be moving home for the summer.\n\nWhen you’re not on tour or playing shows, what are you doing?\n\nI’m living in Nottingham, working full time in music promotion and trying to DJ as much as I can.\n\nWho would you say your main musical influences are?\n\nMy main musical influences, and this doesn’t necessarily mean I try to recreate what they do or that you can hear it in our sound, are: M83, Sonic Youth, At The Drive-In and Racebannon.\n\nAnd are you influenced by anything non-musical?\n\nYeah absolutely. My writing lyrically, and in some parts musically, is influenced by a lot of books and sometimes films. In particular, and this goes for a lot of lyrics, the writings of Brett Easton Ellis. Although he’s probably most famous for American Psycho which is a really graphically violent book, the writing is in other books are much more developed (or sometimes purposefully undeveloped) and a huge influence on what I do.\n\nFinally, what does the next year have in store for Rolo Tomassi?\n\nWe have a bunch of festivals this summer and then will be recording our second album before the end of this year. Past that, I can’t really say right now but we’re all totally pumped!"
