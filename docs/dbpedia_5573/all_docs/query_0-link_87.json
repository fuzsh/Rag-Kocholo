        "text": "UK Progressive metal band Rolo Tomassi announce a new live album, Live at The Electric Ballroom , to be released on September 27, 2024, via MNRK Heavy. The 15-track project was recorded from a headlining show on February 15, 2023, at London’s Electric Ballroom. The set showcases Rolo Tomassi at their most dynamic and mesmerizing.\n\nThe first single, Aftermath, is out today. Originally released on 2018’s Time Will Die and Love Will Bury It, this live version intensifies the melodic and sweeping soundscape.\n\nVocalist/keyboardist James Spence says, “Since its release, this song has been an audience favourite along with a rare opportunity for a sing-along. It remains an outlier in our material, but in the context of a full set, it always feels like an elevated moment. Our band has always been about stark contrasts, and this is a perfect example of that.”\n\nRolo Tomassi have spent 17 years leading the pack rather than following, and on their recent album, Where Myth Becomes Memory, they've led with more poise and determination than ever before. The album served as the final part in an unintended trilogy that began with 2015’s Grievances and continued with 2018’s Time Will Die And Love Will Bury It."
