        "text": "Rolo Tomassi have a new live album titled “Live At The Electric Ballroom” due out on September 27th through MNRK Heavy. The UK-based mathcore band’s February 15th, 2023 show at the Electric Ballroom in London, England serves as the featured performance on this effort, with the included live rendition of “Aftermath” serving as the first single. A music video featuring footage from that show has been shared below.\n\nVocalist/keyboardist James Spence commented:\n\n“Since its release, this song has been an audience favourite along with a rare opportunity for a sing-along. It remains an outlier in our material, but in the context of a full set, it always feels like an elevated moment. Our band has always been about stark contrasts, and this is a perfect example of that.”\n\n“Live At The Electric Ballroom” track listing:\n\n01 – “Almost Always”\n\n02 – “Cloaked”\n\n03 – “To Resist Forgetting”\n\n04 – “Labyrinthine”\n\n05 – “Rituals”\n\n06 – “Prelude III (Phantoms)”\n\n07 – “Opalescent”\n\n08 – “Unseen And Unknown”\n\n09 – “Stage Knives”\n\n10 – “Aftermath”\n\n11 – “A Flood Of Light”\n\n12 – “Mutual Ruin”\n\n13 – “Contretemps”\n\n14 – “Prescie”\n\n15 – “Drip”"
