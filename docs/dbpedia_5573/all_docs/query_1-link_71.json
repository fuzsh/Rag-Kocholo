        "text": "15 July 2019\n\nROLO TOMASSIÂ is set to play for the first time ever in Bulgaria this Friday, 19 July.\n\nThe show at Sofia's *Mixtape 5* club is promoted by Postkultura and here's what James Spence (keys, vocals) has to say.\n\nan interview conducted by Nikola Nikolov\n\nÂ\n\nStarts below the photo...\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is Rolo Tomassi currently? Has the name evolved during the years? What has changed in the way you perceive it?Â\n\nCurrently Rolo Tomassi is a progressive hardcore band. The name has evolved dramatically over the years. As our tastes have changed, as we've grown up as people and as new people have joined the band and added their own personality to it. In terms of my perception, I see it the same as I always have. Music is the best language I have to express myself and this band continues to allow me to do that.\n\nRolo Tomassi has established itself as a name synonymous to heavy/experimental music, always pushing the boundaries but staying deep into the sad, nostalgic and openly emotional side of the arts. Where is the inspiration for your music located? Can you describe the background from which the songs come up?Â\n\nLyrically our songs have always been autobiographical, written from true experiences. They act as confessionals, a way of processing and getting through things that happen in reality. Musically, the inspiration comes from a variety of sources. We constantly push ourselves to listen to new music, to inspire each other and to improve as musicians to create something that evolves from record to record.\n\nâTime will die and Love will bury itâ - is an album that we have grown very fond of. Very neatly layered, with a constant flow which may surprise you greatly with the turn it is leading to. But how do you understand that album, when did you find out it was finished? Did the story finish or was it your decision to end it?\n\nI think you continue to learn about an album and what the songs mean to you as you tour it. Playing certain songs every night, you hear new details, the lyrics take on new meanings. The story only finishes when the song no longer resonates with you personally. Obviously everything is written with an initial meaning in mind but thats not to say the songs don't grow with you.\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nYou have played all over the world, with venues varying wildly from one to other - how much of an impression can a city make to travelling artist, how much can an artist take from a given country, a given town, a given venue?Â\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ"
