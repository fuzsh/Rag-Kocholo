        "text": "From that review it sounds like I'll like this too. Though I may only give it a couple listens and wait for part two to really dive into it.\n\nProb the top melodic death album of all time. Defined swedish death. It's amazing the sound they put out in the 90s\n\nFriday afternoon updates:\n\n-The new Rolo Tomassi is alright. When I listening to it, my mind kept wandering, thinking about listening to bands like Oathbreaker or TDEP instead of RT. Not to say I won't revisit it, but it just didn't click for me on first listen.\n\n-The new Ancst is good. It does a good job of scratching that blackened crust itch that hasn't been satisfied since Totem Skin broke up. I wish they would have added a few more melodic elements to the album, but it was good upon first listen.\n\n-The Iron Reagan/Gatecreeper split shows both bands at the top of their game IMO. The Iron Reagan tracks are fun crossover like you've come to expect from them. The three Gatecreeper tracks are awesome OSDM, as per usual.\n\n-I bought a Gatecreeper snapback today. Lord help me.\n\nGatecreeper and SnapBack are two words I would NEVER have imagined would go together.\n\nAfter this conversation about snapback hats, I went down a bit of a headwear merch wormhole. Here are some of the most egregious designs on Indie Merch Store with commentary:\n\nI'm not sure I want deathcore to be built up again in your image, Thy Art. And was deathcore ever really that great to begin with? C'mon, ya ((Aussies)).\n\nWhy would you defend something you are not in the musical world? I can't wait for the Deafheaven snapbacks that say Defend Thrash Metal on them.\n\nLet everyone know you're a part of the Nazi edgelord revolution.\n\nMetal Blade knows how to bring the puns for the holidays.\n\n- Deathcore has always been great imo but lol yeah back when those hats first went up I was like....... TAIM, I love you guys, but in this political climate, wearing a red baseball cap in ANY format is a bad idea. Lol.\n\nI may end up getting a band cap of some kind soon as well seeing as I work outdoors for my job and given that my hair will be dyed soon, I'd rather it not get sun-bleached, lol.\n\nThen again, having a hat is generally a good idea when summer rolls around.\n\nI'm new to both bands but they were both good despite sounding more or less like every other hardcore band. Maybe if I was more familiar with the material, it'd be different. Ringworm was really good, but the crowd was the weakest for them."
