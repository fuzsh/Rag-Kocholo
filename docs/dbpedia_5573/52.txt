Rolo Tomassi, a UK based progressive hardcore band who is on their first US headlining tour, with support from The Callous Daoboys and Cryptodira and local support from Outrun the Sunlight ​​played at The Beat Kitchen on Wednesday night. This is also their first time playing in Chicago.

Chicago seems to be a second home to the Callous Daoboys as this is their 3rd time through the city this year. This 7-piece knows how to get the crowd going by opening with a fan-favorite “Fake Dinosaur Bones” and closing out their set with a few songs off their new record including “Star Baby” that was released on September 2nd.

Next out was Cryptodira, a heavy progressive metal band out of Long Island, NY, was able to keep the crowd going with their intricate tandem guitar, bass lines, heavy verses, and catchy choruses.

To close out the show, “Rolo Tomassi” came out and gave the crowd exactly what they wanted, a performance that was chaotic, tight, energetic, and also tranquil. I hope they felt at home playing in Chicago and find themselves back in the states in the near future. This band is a must-see!
