8/10

Some movies are designed to lift your spirits and change your outlook on life for the positive. Seabiscuit is one such film and it'd be tough to find someone not inspired by this remarkable story about a sickly little racehorse who became a national icon at a time when Americans needed something to believe in. The truth is always stranger than fiction and the events that led to Seabiscuit becoming one of the world's most unforgettable racehorses make for an uplifting and memorable sports drama.

The performances are all top notch, especially Jeff Bridges as Charles Howard, the rich industrialist who brought everyone together in the name of second chances. While Tobey Maguire was a good choice as Seabiscuit's jockey Red Pollard, he didn't really bring anything special to his performance. Same goes for Chris Cooper, though I did like his character. William H. Macy was hysterical as radio madman "Tick Tock" McGlaughlin, whose on-air one-liners were consistently funny. Of course, the true star of the film is Seabiscuit, who's treated as more of a character than an animal. He has personality, a trait that I think helped him win more than anything. The races are crazy tense, especially his match race with the equally legendary racehorse War Admiral.

Seabiscuit is a fantastic biopic of an American icon that inspired a generation to keep fighting for what they believed in and to never give up when the chips were down. It's very easy to get sucked into the action, particularly during the races. You feel like you're in the stands, cheering Seabiscuit on in the race of his life. Films like this are tough to find without being overly sappy, but Seabiscuit tells the story with dignity and justice, delivering a wonderful film in the process.
