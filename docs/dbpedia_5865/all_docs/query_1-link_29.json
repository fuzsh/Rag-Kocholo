        "text": "There aren’t many horse racing movies that ever made the big screen, and there are several reasons for that. First of all, even though horse racing is one of the oldest sports in the world, it is still not as popular as other sports like soccer or basketball.\n\nHowever, with the rise in popularity of horse racing, many movie-making companies and directors are looking to highlight some of the greatest stories from the sport’s rich tradition.\n\nWith that said, some horse racing movies managed to sneak through the radar and became very popular. One of which is Seabiscuit where the actor Tobey Maguire plays the main role. This movie is inspired by a true story, which you can read about here together with 10 interesting facts about Seabiscuit.\n\nTobey Maguire had a rather successful career as an actor and he is known for starring in many incredible movies. Whether he is playing a leading or a supporting role, the actor seems like a good fit for whatever character he is playing.\n\nSo, is Tobey’s performance in Seabiscuit the best? – Well, there are many other movies that he starred in that are actually even more popular than this horse-racing drama. Plus, he is soon going to play Charlie Chaplin in an upcoming movie, so his best one may be yet to come.\n\nNonetheless, let’s highlight some of his most famous roles.\n\nSpider-Man 1 & 2 and No Way Home\n\nTobey Maguire is best known for his performance in the Spider-Man multiverse. He was the actor who first introduced us to the friendly neighborhood hero Spider-Man, and since then Tobey Maguire's career has never been the same.\n\nThis was also one of his biggest projects and the biggest role he ever got to play on the big screen. His performance in Spider-Man 1 & 2 was great, earning the movie a 7.3 IMBD rating.\n\nOver the years, Spider-Man was replaced by other actors leaving him out of the Marvel Universe until last year when he joined the Marvel Crew back in the Spider-Man No Way Home.\n\nThe latest Spider-Man movie is one of the highest-grossing movies coming from Marvel, and it is also the highest-rated movie that Tobey Maguire acted in with an 8.4 IMBD rating.\n\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n\nAccording to IMBD, this is one of the best movies that Tobey Maguire is featured in with a rating of 7.6. This is an outrageous comedy, featuring Jonny Depp and Benicio Del Toro through some drug-induced adventures.\n\nThis is where Maguire's skill stands out in the role of Hitchhiker. There is a lot of humor and a unique way of telling a story that is quite interesting to watch. Even though Maguire isn’t most known for his role in this film, it is still one of his best performances.\n\n25th Hour\n\nHere we have another movie that has a 7.6 IMBD rating and we are still talking about drugs. This movie is centered on a drug dealer trying to reevaluate his life in a single day. This is Maguire’s highest-rated movie, and the actor doesn’t even play a role in the film.\n\nInstead, he produced the film along, with Spike Lee, making it a more unconventional project for him.\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nThis is one of the first times Maguire found himself in a much bigger role in his acting career. The Ice Storm came out in 1997 and centered on a suburban family with sex and drugs in the main focus throughout the movie.\n\nEven though the movie is not focused on Maguire, it is still one of his best performances at the beginning of his acting career.\n\nDeconstructing Harry\n\nThis is not one of Woody Allen’s most memorable films, but it still holds a decent score on IMBD. The movie is centered on a writer that is trying to reignite his motivation.\n\nIn this film, Maguire finds himself playing Harvey Stern, who is a sex-obsessed man who finds himself wrongfully claimed by Death. Even though didn’t get much screen time in this movie, it is also one of his top performances that is worth mentioning."
