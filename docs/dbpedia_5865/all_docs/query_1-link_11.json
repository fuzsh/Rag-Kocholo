        "meta_description": "Seabiscuit tells the true story of three men and a horse that ignite hope in the common man’s heart during the Depression. Jeff Bridges plays owner Charles Howard, who made his fortune introducing the automobile to the American West. Tobey Maguire is the half-blind, ex-boxing prizefighter, Red Pollard, who becomes the horse’s jockey. Chris Cooper is the “horse whisperer” who becomes Pollard’s trainer. And, Seabiscuit is the undersized, knobbly-kneed horse that beats the legendary War Admiral and goes on to win Horse-of-the-Year honors in 1938, becoming a legend in his own time. A remarkable story of triumph against all odds, Seabiscuit is a top-notch film with excellent acting, inspired direction and an invigorating score.",

        "text": "The film is an inspiring story that leaves audiences with a good feeling about perseverance and the underdog beating the odds, although it neglects to deal with any of the character’s resoundingly painful emotional issues. Sadly, filmmakers chose to litter Seabiscuit with foul language and other offensive elements that prevent Dove from awarding this film the Dove Seal for family-friendly entertainement."
