Time Bandits is … Read More\n\n|\n\nThe Formula and Fischer-Tropsch\n\nThe mysterious and secret formula under investigation in The Formula (1980) is the not-so-secret Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) formula, which had been known over half a century when the movie was made.

The movie Louisiana Story (1948), which captures some … Read More\n\n|\n\n1946 Shallow Water Oil Production in Louisiana\n\nFollowing up the last post, I think it’s interesting that Louisiana Story (1948) and Thunder Bay (1953) are both about shallow water oil production in 1946 Louisiana. Louisiana Story was made in 1946 but released two years later, whereas Thunder … Read More\n\n|\n\nWhere Oil, Water and Cajuns Mix: Louisiana Story\n\nThe Louisiana bayou setting in Beasts of the Southern Wild reminds me of a 1948 film, Louisiana Story.

The black-and-white movie is almost entirely … Read More\n\n|\n\nClimate Change and Beasts of the Southern Wild\n\nAs mentioned in an earlier post, energy and water are connected. Climate change (induced mostly by the energy sector) makes this connection all the more apparent since global warming manifests itself primarily through distortions to the global water cycle, making … Read More\n\n|\n\nNuclear Energy and The Hunt For Red October\n\nThe James Bond tribute at the Oscars got me thinking again about the different ways energy has appeared in Bond films (see my earlier posts here, here, and here), and subsequently, the archetypal Bond Sean Connery. One non-Bond Sean Connery … Read More\n\n|\n\nThe Avengers and Nuclear Power\n\nSticking to a theme of Oscar movies that have energy in them, I thought I would quickly mention a few things from the Avengers (2012). The most prominent energy angle is the recurring appearance of nuclearesque energy throughout the movie. … Read More\n\n|\n\nHunger Games is a Hydroelectric Movie, Too\n\nFollowing on our Jennifer Lawrence Oscar nominee theme, here’s a follow up to my earlier post regarding The Hunger Games. While The Hunger Games (2012) is primarily a coal movie because of the imagery from district 12 (a coal mining … Read More\n\n|\n\nHunger Games is a Coal Movie\n\nWith Jennifer Lawrence’s Oscar nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role for Silver Linings Playbook, it seems like an appropriate time to highlight the energy content of her other big 2012 hit The Hunger Games. It’s a coal movie. … Read More\n\n|\n\nWater Bottles and Guilt Trips\n\nThis comedy about a mother-son road trip starring Barbra Streisand (Joyce) and Seth Rogen (Andy) doesn’t feature energy, unless you count a discussion about rental car options and the gas expense for SUVs. However, there is a funny exchange regarding … Read More\n\n|\n\nSkyfall IS an Energy Movie\n\nLooks like we’re going to need a DeLorean and 1.21 gigawatts of power for this post to correct the mistake written earlier by Michael!

(link to Michael’s original Skyfall blog post here) … Read More\n\n|\n\nQuantum of Solace: An Energy and Water Film\n\nQuantum of Solace (2008) is both an energy film and a water film.

What … Read More\n\n|\n\nSkyfall: NOT an energy movie\n\nWhile Skyfall (2012) is many things—a fun movie, a Bond thriller, and a blockbuster—it is not an energy movie. But, for me, it does raise the question of which Bond movies have energy or resource themes. And, in spirit of … Read More\n\n|\n\nElf – Santa’s magic sleigh runs on 1930s technology?\n\nI watched Elf over the holidays and realized it features energy, too. As you may recall, “the best way to spread Christmas Cheer is singing loud for all to hear.” But, what does Santa fall back on when the Christmas Cheer is … Read More\n\n|\n\nThe Promised Land: Texas Written On The Wall\n\nOne more interesting tidbit I noticed in The Promised Land (2012) (Matt Damon’s movie about fracking) was the touching scene where Frances McDormand’s character (a landman* securing lease rights for drilling) communicates with her teenage son in Houston via Skype. … Read More\n\n|\n\nThe Promised Land: Frac Fluids on Fire\n\nOne of the more visually entertaining scenes in Promised Land (2012) was when the environmental activist Dustin Noble (played by John Krasinski) visited a local school to discuss the risks that fracking poses to farms.
