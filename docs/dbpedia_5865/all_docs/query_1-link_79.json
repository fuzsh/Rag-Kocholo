        "text": "The story Seabiscuit takes place in California in a time where industries were booming. In this period the great depression also took place and threw out the movie short clips of this time period are shown. The main protagonist, Charles S.

The story “Seabiscuit” depicts the life of Charles S. Howard and many other people’s life during the Great Depression.\n\n\"Seabiscuit,\" was based on Laura Hillenbrand best-selling book, she tells of these three men and a horse that was placed in the background of the times. The Depression brought Americans to their knees. This was something the nation needed because they needed something to believe in. In the simplified calculus of this movie, both Seabiscuit and Roosevelt's New Deal, were a long shot in America. If an little guy such as Seabiscuit could win in contrast to the bigger and famous horses with notable pedigrees, then there would be a chance for\n\nSeabiscuit is the story of a very unlikely champion race horse and the three men who worked tirelessly to help him fulfil his hidden potential. He was undersized with a lopsided gallop and a combative attitude when it came to being trained. Consequently his trainers gave up, exasperated, lost for a solution. All this changed when three special men came into the feisty horse's life and changed everything.\n\nThe Great Depression was a period in the 1930’s when America was in a state of economic collapse. Poverty and unemployment were common, thus, leading to large amounts of migrant workers. The novel by John Steinbeck, Of Mice and Men, is set in the times of the Great Depression. Steinbeck had abandoned the romantic view of mankind s occupying a special place in nature or that man is guided towards special ends. He did not see man as special or particularly cared for. Of Mice and Men reflects this philosophy. The characters experience loneliness, are unhappy with this state and desire empathy.\n\nThe island are called the island of the Blue Dolphins because the island shapes Dolphins which is two leagues long and one league wide. Karana has a brother- Ramo (12 years old), an older sister-Ulape (26 years old), and a father-Chowing who was a Chief of the village of Ghalas-at at that time. One day, Ramo and Karana found a two red sails ship, which visited this island to hunt sea otters. When Captain Orlov, a Russian, first met Chowing, Orlov tried to negotiate that as he catches otters, he will divide them and one part for Chowing to be paid in goods, and two parts for Orlov. However, Chowing refused his proposal and insisted that the share must be equal. After the negotiation, Orlov compromised that the share is equal. Orlov’s crew\n\nAntwone Fisher, played by Derek Luke, is a young man who has joined the United States Navy in efforts to better his life.

While in foster care, his foster-mother spoke negative things to him and treated him poorly. Mrs. Tate, his foster mother, played a great deal in his emotional and physical abuse.\n\nSoon after Benjamin is given the name “The Ghost.” Benjamin takes his children to Charlotte Selton plantation, it is there were Gabriel decides to go back to fight for freedom it is this moment when Benjamin and Gabriel argue. Benjamin and Gabriel oversee the Battle of Camden, This battle begins with cannonballs firing and British troops advancing and the continental soldiers standing there, they begin to fire on the British taking down the front line. Benjamin says “gates is a damn fool he has spent too many years in a British army trying to go muscle to muscle with redcoats on an open field its madness.” The British begin to fire taking many of the continental soldiers down, British then fires the cannon, which takes a man's head clean off, Benjamin martin says “this battle was over before it began”, the British Calvary arrive on horses as the continental army is retreating.\n\nThe great depression opened up a wide range of economic implications, and brought harsh and cruel adversities on Americans. Even so, the movie indicates that, despite the hard economic times, Americans were out to prove to the world that the impossible was possible. For millions of individuals during the 1930s who were on the verge of giving up, the construction of Hoover dam was symbolic of the effort of industrial workers. It was a sign that the American industries were capable of achieving the unimaginable, and transform the country into a gold mine. With the emergence of economic depression, millions starved, lost their farms and homes, and as seen in the film, no hope was left.\n\nThe Great Depression was a period filled with immense pain and struggling. To survive during this time, many hardships had to be endured including racial inequality, gender inequality, disabilities, and poverty. In Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck conveys these hardships using the literary elements diction, imagery, and characterization. Of Mice and Men is a story about two friends, George and Lennie, who work as farm hands on a ranch, but struggle to achieve their dream of a better life.\n\nA few years before the release of On the Waterfront (Elia Kazan, 1954), the House Un-American Activities Committee investigated alleged Communists in Hollywood. Among those under investigation, Elia Kazan elected to release names of others involved in the same movement (Neve 66). This event sparked intense controversy in Hollywood, and it forced the people he uncovered to either release more names or be blacklisted from filmmaking. Through an early example of film authorship, Kazan was able to relate scenes throughout the movie to his personal experiences with HUAC. Within the Classic Hollywood Narrative, Kazan’s directorial creativity allows him to develop his ideas through the typical structure and expand his deeper thoughts through the allegory of the waterfront. A majority of the film stays within the Classic Narrative Style, but some scenes will venture outside the realm of the typical structure. While scenes throughout the movie may or may not follow the narrative, they are specifically created to tell a deeper story in relation to the movie’s plot and Kazan’s life.\n\nIn this film, Chaplin addresses the issues that the great depression and pre-WWII brought to the people like unemployment, soup and food kitchens, shelter, industrializations and the the suppression of the citizens protesting. The great depression began after the stock market crashed in 1929 and it was a lasting economic downturn for people, businesses and banks. “By 1930, 4 million Americans looking for work could not find it; that number had risen to 6 million in 1931. Meanwhile, the country’s industrial production had dropped by half. Bread lines, soup kitchens and rising numbers of homeless people became more and more common in America’s towns and cities.\n\nThe movie directed by Clint Eastwood where Morgan Freeman (Nelson Mandela) and Matt Damon (Francois Pienaar) were the starring. The movie is based on how the two starring are inspired to unite the people of South Africa who seems to be apart from the era of Apartheid. The title of the movie, Invictus, was a poem written by William Ernest Henley in the era of Victorian. This poem was read and recited regularly by Nelson when he was in jail for 27 years. When he was in the jail, he used to hold the poem on his and he was mostly inspired by the famous phrase of the poem, “I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.” Four years later after his release from jail, he became the first president of South Africa who was black. At that moment, there was racial division between the majority black and the minority white people. Reconciliation of the two groups was the biggest challenges Mandela faced in his presidency era. On the hand, Pienaar was the captain of the national rugby team of South Africa named Springboks.\n\nHollywood today spends more money on movies than ever before, with an average budget of $140 million per movie. ‘Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides’; the most expensive movie ever made; cost approximately $378.5 million and that was five years ago. This isn’t surprising since history is witness to a rising trend in money spent on movies, however, even after adjusting for inflation, their impact on the industry isn’t as large as their budgets. Over the years, lower cost productions like B-Movies have played a major role in carrying the industry forward by keeping it stable, moving and profitable in times of trouble. B-Movies came to be the need of the hour after The Great Depression and World War II. Money was tight everywhere and Hollywood could not continue making extravagant movies therefore they turned to low budget commercial films. These movies not only have an economical significance in Hollywood, they have made more than one contribution to the industry. These low risk movies provided directors, writers and producers with a wide scope for experimentation and led to the creation of many genres and sub-genres. The origins of B-Movies are humble but over the years that they grew in Hollywood, they became more significant and successful, yet their progress from “Rags to Riches” remains more a behind-the-scenes heroic act than a superhero effort.\n\nThe Big Fish is a 2003 fantasy/ comedy-drama directed by the director of popular movies such as The Nightmare Before Christmas, Tim Burton. The Big Fish takes us into the life of Edward Bloom (Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney), and the feud he holds with his son Will Bloom (Billy Crudup). Will's feud with his dad stems from his dad's overexagerated stories and gaps between fantasy and reality. Will goes with his wife, Sandra Bloom (Alison Lohman), to find out once and for all the truth about his father's life. During the narration of Edward's life, the movie slips into a fantasy world where we witness the abnormal and the exdrodanary, and sit on the edge of our seats as we anticipate the ending of the phenomenal fairy tale."
