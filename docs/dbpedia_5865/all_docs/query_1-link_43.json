        "text": "“The horse is too small, the jockey too big, the trainer too old, and I’m too dumb to know the difference.”- Jeff Bridges as Charles Howard\n\nBottom line: Here’s your basic “overcoming the odds” theme, but “Seabiscuit” thrives on talented camera work and thrilling races — separating it from the pack.\n\nAt its center, this is a story about how one small animal can help an entire nation forget about their woes in the midst of a depression. The racing sequences are top notch and do well to complement the majority of the film’s persevering themes.\n\nIn his second film, Director Gary Ross brings back the acting duo from his directorial debut “Pleasantville” to recreate a troubling time in American history. “Seabiscuit” is a depression-era sports flick about a storied racehorse. Seabiscuit, a small and often lazy horse, grew up spending his days sleeping, eating and misbehaving.\n\nThree men would shape this bum into one of the most beloved racing legends of all time: Owner Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), who has a keen eye for talented outcasts, trainer Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), who is an outcast himself for trying to heal injured horses instead of killing them, and jockey Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), who started off cleaning stables.\n\nBased on Laura Hellenbrand’s best-selling novel, “Seabiscuit” follows these three men in their attempt to create something out of nothing. The country’s financial crisis is the film’s backdrop, contributing its own stressful layer of drama.\n\nThe narrative structure is a standard sports timeline. The majority of the film is slower, dialogue-driven content, and the characters face a major setback right before the final event (in this case, a race — no way!). The slow start to “Seabiscuit” is full of leisurely character introductions, but the impressive racing scenes make up for the sluggish character development.\n\nThe races are intense because they have to be; it would be tough to make the impact “Seabisuit” does without them. Cinematographer John Schwartzman gets close enough to the action that viewers have to question where the cameras are located. The shots often mimic the rider’s experience, pulling the viewer into every key moment and jockey exchange beautifully.\n\nIf there is anything bad to say about the film, it’s the strange lack of gambling. Betting is a major element in the racing world — it always has been. “Seabiscuit” seems to avoid it altogether and almost condemn it when it is seen. There could have been an intriguing subplot diving into the world of gambling at the track, but it seems the crew decided it would be too distracting.\n\nNevertheless, the lack of gambling doesn’t make the film inaccurate. The content’s powerful themes do the trick well enough. At times it may seem these “true events” are carefully constructed, but nothing will keep the viewer from feeling the emotional impact of “Seabisuit.”\n\nFun fact: While the movie describes War Admiral as being a huge horse close to eighteen hands tall, the real-life War Admiral was well known for being one of the smallest sons of Man o’ War. War Admiral was actually the same size as Seabiscuit, which was approximately fifteen hands tall.\n\nRun time: 140 min.\n\nMPAA rating: PG-13\n\nRotten Tomatoes:77 percent"
