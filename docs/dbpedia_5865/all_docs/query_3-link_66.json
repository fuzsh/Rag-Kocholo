        "text": "1. Task- Explain in detail how you know that these films are thriller films and reference media language. Shazmeena Aziz 12s MY ANALYSIS OF A FRAME FROM THREE DIFFERENT FILMS\n\n2. PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER A psychological; thriller is a thriller film that incorporates mystery and drama. The suspense in a psychological thriller is triggered from the mind as a psychological threat, this is because in a psychological thriller the story line and plot teases the mind, creating more tension. This implies that as viewers watch a psychological thriller there mind is trying to figure out a solution which means that the audience are fully engaged within the film. By doing so the audience will enjoy watching a psychological thriller. . An example of a Psychological thriller is the film ‘Salt’ starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Phillip Noyce. This psychological thriller is about a well respected CIA agent under the name of ‘Evelyn salt. Out of the blue a Russian spy walks into her office and gives her a vital piece of information.; the president of Russia will be assassinated in New York on the day U.S. vise president’s funeral. And the name of the assassin is Evelyn Salt. But before anything happens Evelyn decides to go on the run to clear her name, and for the safety of her husband, so she can return back to America in safety. However this is not as a simple journey for Evelyn because of the dangerous risks she has to take, and the consequences behind them. What makes salt FIT INTO THE THRILLER genre? In general the film SALT fits into the thriller genre as it meets the traditional and basic codes and conventions of a thriller films, and it also meets other very specific codes and convention which is what makes SALT a psychological thriller. For example, some of the basic codes and conventions used are, low key lighting, tension music, changes in angle of shots, a protagonist and antagonist, and more. By using these codes and conventions the scenes and action taking place are emphasized. For example, in SALT changes in angle shots are used. Such as, when SALT gets arrested by the FBI. She jumps form the top of the staircase and chokes man death, who got her arrested. When SALT jumps a variety of camera shots are used. To be specific they a long shot, Over head shot, establishing shot and a low camera angle. When all of these camera shots are edited together, the fight scene between SALT and the FBI is presented to the audience in a way, that makes them intrigued and amazed of what is taking place. The variety of camera angle shots excite the audience, which will make the scene come across as an epic and memorable scene in the eyes of the audience. By doing so the audience are left speechless, implying that the audience enjoyed the film.\n\n3. ACTION THRILLER • An action thriller is a thriller film that incorporates physical action to create suspense within the film. Just like a traditional action film, a thriller action will have continuous motion, physical stunts, car chases, fights, battles and races. By using these codes and conventions in an action thriller the audience are bale to feel a sense of danger the protagonist is faced. Therefore the audience will be fully engaged within the film. • An example of action thriller is ‘Batman The Dark Knight’. This action thriller is following on from the film ‘Batman Begins’. The district attorney of Gotham City Harvey Dent, has been elected to take fight the world of crime in streets of Gotham city. However Dent is threatened by a vigilante running through the streets of Gotham city, in other words Batman. As Dent and Batman continue to fight the underworld of crime as well as each other in the public eye, there master plans of safety within the streets of Gotham City is destroyed by the mastermind of all criminals; the joker. The joker thrusts Gotham city into an anarchy causing Dent to slowly loose power, and forces Batman closer to a crossing fine line between a hero and vigilante. • What makes ‘Batman The Dark Knight’ fit into the thriller genre? • In general this film fits into the thriller genre due to the codes and conventions used within the film. Such as, a range of camera shots, low key lighting, a protagonist and antagonist, diegetic sound of breathing; superficially Batman breaching in is mask, shadows, quick cuts and more. In further detail this film also meets the codes and contentions of the action genre. Which are, car chases, battles, explosions, extreme scenes, a damsel in distress, a villain, typically a hero and more. The fact that both sets of codes and conventions are used imply that ‘Batman The Dark Night’ is an action thriller film. This is because both sets of codes and conventions are in cooperated into one another, which emphasizes scenes. For example, there is a scene in ‘Batman The Dark Night’ where Bruce Wayne (Batman) and his maide are in his tower. As they are talking to one another, a ‘longshot' is used where the audience can see a fake dead Batman swinging towards the camera on the tight rope. When the dead Batman hits the glass of Wayne’s tower the camera does an extreme close up, showing the face of this disguised dead person. The audience can clearly see the signature red lipstick of the joker on this person’s face, implying this was plotted by the joker himself. This scene fits into the action thriller genre, as physical action is used as well a different camera shots, therefore the suspense and tension within the film is built up. This means that the audience will feel a burst of excitement and a adrenaline rush as they want to find what is to happen between Harvey Dent, Batman and The joker.\n\n4. RELIGIOUS THRILLER • A religious thriller is a thriller film that in-cooperates religious themes such as, religious questions, ceremonies and objects. Also many religious thrillers include supernatural experiences that do not relate back to a specific religion, exorcism, demon possession, church cover ups and typical religious themes. • An example of a religious thriller is ‘The Exorcism of Emily Rose’. This film is based on a true story, just like many religious thrillers. According to the documented film version the ‘The Exorcism Of Emily Rose’ is about a young girl under the name of Emily that dies due to the possession of a demon a number of days after her exorcism, carried out by her parish priest; Father Moore. Emily believed she has been possessed by six demons, however after the death of Emily Rose Emily's’ family accused Father Moore of negligent homicide. So the priest is taken to court, however the priest’s layer is a women that does not believe in God. Furthermore throughput the movie you get too see Emily Rose live through her possession and the battle of science and religion within the courtroom. • What makes ‘The Exorcism of Emil Rose’ fit into the thriller genre?’ • In general this film fits into the thriller genre as it meets the basic codes and convention of a thriller film which are; low key lighting, a variety of camera shots, a protagonist and antagonist, a range of music to fit into the setting, average looking characters, a dramatic yet tense story line and plot, a minimum use of gore and more. On the other hand the codes and conventions of a religious based film are used. Which are; demon possession, the belief of God vs. Science, typical religious themes and combined. When both sets of a codes and convention are combined a Religious thriller is created. As you are watching a film with a thrilling story line that always build up a little suspense. And an under layer of religious context which emphasises the tension amongst the audience, and builds up the curiosity, fear and worry within an audience."
