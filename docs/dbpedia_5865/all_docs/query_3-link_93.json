        "text": "Semantics of horror include:\n\nAn isolated location\n\nLow key lighting\n\nBad weather conditions\n\nBlood, gore, and other gross out visuals that reflect our own bodies\n\nReligious imagery\n\nA cast of dim witted characters with only a few characters as the voices of reason\n\nhigh pitched unsettling noises:\n\nA paranoia inducing soundtrack\n\nLeaving much of the visuals up to interpretation\n\na monster or an unknown entity\n\nConfusing visuals\n\nClose up shots to limit visibility\n\nSyntactic of horror films:\n\nHorror films of the past usually focused on a group of characters going to a isolated or forbidden area of the earth and encountering a external threat, usual a monster or a spirt. The film then ends with most if not all of the characters dead after a final attempt to kill the monster/spirt. An exploration of human helplessness against something they don’t fully understand.\n\nHowever many horror films as of late are turning toward the mind for horror ideas, having a single protagonist face in issue in his/her mind that only they can deal with. And as such the horror comes from within instead of from outside a person. Even with this setup the film still manages to focus on an exploration of human helplessness against something they don’t fully understand (which in this case is themselves)."
