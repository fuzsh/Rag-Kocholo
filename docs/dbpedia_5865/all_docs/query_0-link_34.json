You guessed it, all these major movies were filmed (or parts were filmed) in Upstate New York.\n\nUpstate NY is \"Hollywood East\"\n\nUpstate turned into \"mini-Hollywood\" over the last few years as more and more major film companies have come to New York to shoot their movies. Sometimes agencies will choose an area or region that makes the most sense for the movie, other times they'll come here because it's cheaper. Regardless of the reason, it's always exciting to see Hollywood's biggest stars set up shop in our hometown, eat, drink, play, socialize, and work in our area.\n\nOver the years, Upstate New York has been very fortunate to have major talents like Al Pacino, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Meryl Streep, Angelina Jolie, Bradley Cooper, Jim Carrey, Mark Wahlberg, Tobey Maguire, Dustin Hoffman, John Krasinski, Eva Mendes and more, working in our hometowns.\n\nHow did we come up with the ranking system?\n\nThere are dozens of noteworthy movies that have been made in Upstate New York, and many of you know which ones they are. But where do they rank? That's where things can be a little tricky. Gathering as much info as we could about \"films made in Upstate New York,\" we started writing them all down, which was the easy part. We needed a grading system so that we could rank them from #15, all the way down to the #1 movie made in Upstate.\n\nWe judged and graded each film based on 5 different sets of criteria, equally weighted.\n\nStar Power: How big of a star the actor(s) were.\n\nAverage Critics Score: Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic, etc\n\nBox Office Success: How much $$$$ the movie made.\n\nTime Spent in Upstate New York: Did they come here to shoot one scene, or did they set up shop for months? The longer they were in town, the higher the grade was given to the film.\n\nOverall Wow Factor/ Overall Impact: Do people still talk about it to this day?\n\nHere are the top 15 movies (ranked) made in Upstate New York, with 2 additional films worthy of a shoutout. If we missed a bunch, or if you disagree with our ranking, feel free to let us know."
