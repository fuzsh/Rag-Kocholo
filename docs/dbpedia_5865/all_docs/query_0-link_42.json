        "text": "Unintended Consequences\n\nWhen a teenage girl is found dead, Rollins goes under cover at a high-end rehab center where the victim was last seen; Benson tries to overcome her doubts about Sheila.\n\nShibboleth\n\nAs Thanksgiving arrives, Bartlet decides the fate of a container ship full of illegal Chinese immigrants who claim to be Christians seeking asylum from religious persecution. Toby wants Leo's controversial sister appointed to an education post. C.J. must choose a national turkey, and Charlie has his work cut out for him when the President sends him out to find the perfect carving knife.\n\nSmells Like Murder\n\nA large box with a body stuffed inside leads Brenda in search of suspects, and she winds up with several: a scripture- thumping stepfather, a disgruntled ex-girlfriend, a buddy who was constantly being hit up for money and a landlord who simply hated the victim's guts. Gabriel is studying for the detective exam, so Brenda uses the case as a teaching tool. Meanwhile, Brenda's niece, Charlie (recurring guest star SOSIE BACON), pulls a stunt so severe that Brenda and Fritz are ready to put her on a plane home immediately."
