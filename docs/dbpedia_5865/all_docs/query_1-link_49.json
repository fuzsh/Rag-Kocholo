        "text": "Seabiscuit (2003) Movie Drinking Game\n\nTake a Drink: every time there is “riding crop hitting” (violent acts between jockeys)\n\nDo Not Be Sober: every time this film features intense drama (not to mention plenty of profanity)\n\nBut Still Cheer: because the story of Seabiscuit lives on in this compelling historical drama!\n\nBy: Alex Phuong (A Toast) –\n\nSome of the best films are sports dramas. Not only that, but many compelling films biographically depict famed players who play their sports passionately. One of the most popular examples is The Blind Side (2009), which earned Sandra Bullock her first Academy Award. A few years prior to the release of that film, Seabiscuit brought the story of the eponymous horse to the silver screen.\n\nA Toast!\n\nIt is a real shame that this film failed to receive any Academy Awards! Then again, it had to compete with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. Nevertheless, this film features what is perhaps Tobey Maguire’s best dramatic performance (outside of playing Spider-Man). Additionally, Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper add star power to such an amazing cast. This film is thankfully the product of the screenwriting and directing talents of Gary Ross.\n\nVerdict\n\nGo Seabiscuit, go!"
