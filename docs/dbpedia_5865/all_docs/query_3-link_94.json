        "text": "Characteristics\n\nFilms are similar to novels or short stories in that they tell a story. They include the same genres: romantic, historical, detective, thriller, adventure, horror, and science fiction. However, films may also include sub-groups such as: action, comedy, tragedy, westerns and war. The methods you use to analyze a film are closely related to those used to analyze literature; nevertheless, films are multimedial. They are visual media made for viewers. Films take command of more of our senses to create special atmospheres, feelings or to bring out emotions.\n\nAlong with the literary elements such as plot, setting, characterization, structure, and theme, which make up the text or screenplay, there are many different film techniques used to tell the story or narrative. Attention is paid to sound, music, lighting, camera angles, and editing. What is important is to focus on how all the elements are used together in making a good film.\n\nBelow is a list of elements and questions to help you when analyzing films.\n\nFilm Contents\n\nFilm Facts\n\nTitle of film\n\nYear film was produced\n\nNationality\n\nNames of the actors\n\nName of director\n\nGenre\n\nWhat main genre does the film fall under? – romantic, historical, detective, thriller, adventure, horror, and science fiction.\n\nWhat sub-grouping does the film fall under? – action, comedy, tragedy, war and westerns.\n\nSetting\n\nSetting is a description of where and when the story takes place.\n\nDoes it take place in the present, the past, or the future?\n\nWhat aspects of setting are we made aware of? – Geography, weather conditions, physical environment, time of day.\n\nWhere are we in the opening scene?\n\nPlot and structure\n\nWhat are the most important sequences?\n\nHow is the plot structured?\n\nIs it linear, chronological or is it presented through flashbacks??\n\nAre there several plots running parallel?\n\nHow is suspense built up?\n\nDo any events foreshadow what is to come?\n\nConflict\n\nConflict or tension is usually the heart of the film and is related to the main characters.\n\nHow would you describe the main conflict?\n\nIs it internal where the character suffers inwardly?\n\nis it external caused by the surroundings or environment the main character finds himself/herself in?\n\nCharacterization\n\nCharacterization deals with how the characters are described.\n\nthrough dialogue?\n\nby the way they speak?\n\nphysical appearance? thoughts and feelings?\n\ninteraction – the way they act towards other characters?\n\nAre they static characters who do not change?\n\nDo they develop by the end of the story?\n\nWhat type of characters are they?\n\nWhat qualities stand out?\n\nAre they stereotypes?\n\nAre the characters believable?\n\nNarrator and point of view\n\nThe narrator is the person telling the story.\n\nIs there a narrator in the film? Who?\n\nPoint of view means through whose eyes the story is being told.\n\nThrough whose eyes does the story unfold?\n\nIs the story told in the first person “I” point of view?\n\nIs the story told through an off-screen narrator?\n\nImagery\n\nIn films imagery are the elements used to create pictures in our minds. They may include:\n\nSymbols – when something stands not only for itself ( a literal meaning), but also stands for something else (a figurative meaning) e.g. The feather in the film Forrest Gump symbolizes his destiny.\n\nWhat images are used in the film? e.g. color, objects etc.\n\nCan you find any symbols?\n\nTheme\n\nWhat are the universal ideas that shine through in the film (in other words, what is it about, in general)?\n\nCinematic Effects\n\nSoundtrack\n\nincludes both dialogue and music, as well as all the other sounds in a film.\n\nenhances the atmosphere of the film (what effect does the choice of music have? Does it suit the theme?)\n\nAre any particular sounds accentuated?\n\nUse of the camera\n\nA camera shot is based on the camera’s distance from the object.\n\nThe four basic shots used in films are:\n\na close-up – a very close shot where the camera lens focuses on some detail or the actor’s face.\n\nmedium shot – a shot where the camera lens picks up some background or upper half of the actor.\n\nfull shot – a shot where the camera lens has full view of the actor.\n\nlong shot – shot taken at a distance from an object.\n\nWhat camera shots can you identify in the film? How are they used?\n\nA camera angle is how the camera is tilted while filming.\n\nstraight-on angle – The camera is at the same height as the object.\n\nhigh angle – The camera is filming from above the object.\n\nlow angle – The camera is looking up at the object.\n\noblique angle – The camera is tilted sideways.\n\nDoes the way in which the camera is held say anything about the character?\n\nLighting\n\nLighting focuses the audience’s attention on the main character or object in a film.\n\nIt also sets the mood or atmosphere.\n\nWhile high-key lighting is bright and illuminating, low-key lighting is darker with a lot of shadows.\n\nWhat special lighting effects are used during the most important scenes?\n\nFilters are often used to soften and reduce harsh contrasts. They can also be used to eliminate haze, ultraviolet light or glare from water when shooting outside.\n\nUsing color like red or orange can be used to enhance the feeling of a sunset.\n\nCan you find any examples where a filter has been used in the film?\n\nWhat effect did using a filter have on the scene?\n\nWhat colors are most dominant?\n\nEditing\n\nEditing is the way in which a film editor together with the director cuts and assembles the scenes. The way the scenes are joined together creates the rhythm of the motion picture. Scenes can be long and drawn out or short and choppy.\n\nCan you see a pattern to how the scenes are cut?\n\nHow would you describe the pace/tempo of the film?\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen analyzing films for school work or projects, you may be asked to use some or all of the characteristics above. Link those elements together that seem most logical. Try to think of the film as a whole and how the elements mentioned above work together to bring out the main message of the film."
