        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio – For movies, 2003 was an OK year, highlighted by several strong performances from women, a classic holiday film and a biopic on a Clevelander.\n\nAt the end of our summaries of 20-year-old movies we’ll offer quick lines on movies from 30, 40 and 50 years ago. Just to make us all realize how fast the time goes.\n\nMany of these make for great remote droppers when you’re scrolling for something to watch. We include the original trailers of each film.\n\nLights, camera, action …\n\nTHRILLER: “Mystic River”\n\nA couple’s daughter is killed, sparking an investigation and vigilante justice in this film, based on Dennis Lehane’s 2001 novel and directed by Clint Eastwood. Vengeance and the truth battle it out in a Boston neighborhood. Brilliant acting performances (and accents) from Sean Penn, Laura Linney and Tim Robbins. In the end, sins are buried.\n\nDRAMEDY: “Under the Tuscan Sun”\n\nDiane Lane plays an American writer whose life is turned upside down emotionally and financially when her husband leaves her. She eventually buys a villa in Tuscany and – through self-sustenance and fortitude – she learns life moves on and becomes stronger for it. “I bought a house for a life I don’t even have,” she says, “because I’m sick of being afraid all the time.” It’s based on Frances Mayes’ 1996 memoir.\n\nACTION: “Kill Bill Vol. 1″\n\nIn the annals of tough women-who-take-no-crap genre, consider Uma Thurman as one of the best. Her character arises from a longtime coma with one thing on her mind: Vengeance. Even if you didn’t know Quentin Tarantino directed this movie, anyone who watches this will see his fingerprints all over it. And you can’t have a martial-arts-based movie without a strong if not unhealthy, obsessed spirit of retribution. David Carradine stars as the evil one, Bill. Buckle up for a lot of fight scenes martial-arts style with dryly delivered quips along the way.\n\nSPORTS: “Seabiscuit”\n\nThe underdog horse’s racing exploits captured the hearts of the nation in the 1930s. Jeff Bridges plays the owner, Chris Cooper is the trainer, Tobey Maguire portrays the jockey. Laura Hillenbrand wrote the acclaimed book. For sports history buffs, Seabiscuit defeated War Admiral in a huge match race at a time when horse racing captivated Americans and shared space on the sports pages with baseball. Remember: “Every horse is good for something. You don’t throw a whole life away just ‘cause it’s banged up a little.”\n\nDRAMEDY: “Lost in Translation”\n\nSofia Coppola directs this unique film about two disengaged characters played by Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, who meet in Japan and fight through jet leg and melancholy over their respective times in their lives. It’s a platonic romantic movie that explores relationships from a different vantage, and has one of the best - albeit ambiguous – endings ever. “The more you know who you are and what you want,” we hear, “the less you let things upset you.”\n\nANIMATION: “Finding Nemo”\n\nA clownfish (voice: Albert Brooks) loses his son and goes after him in the ocean. What you would expect from Pixar – cute, a tad sad, quippy and well done. Ellen DeGeneres, Willem Dafoe and Geoffrey Rush also provide voices. A young Alexander Gould voices Nemo.\n\nHOLIDAYS: “Bad Santa”\n\nHere’s the guilty-pleasure film of the bunch: Billy Bob Thornton plays an unredeemable, alcoholic, thieving store Santa with very little to offer anyone. With his girlfriend (Lauren Graham), he falls into a baby-sitting gig for a naïve kid. (The late Bernie Mac and John Ritter have supporting roles.) If you believe in Santa, this movie might be hard to take. The boxing scene is sophomoric yet laugh-out-loud funny. “You need many years of therapy,” Tony Cox’s character tells Santa. So will most of us who watch this film.\n\nACTION: “The Italian Job”\n\nMark Wahlberg and Edward Norton face off in this caper about loyalty – yes, honor among thieves – as they try to rip off gold. Charlize Theron stars as the catalyst for the job, and Mos Def and Seth Green turn in solid supporting roles. It’s a modern-day caper mixed with a dose of technology and the vibe of the “Ocean’s Eleven” crew with the greatest mini-Cooper chase scene ever.\n\nDRAMA: “Shattered Glass”\n\nThe venerable New Republic magazine is rocked by scandal when it’s revealed that writer Stephen Glass has committed one of two cardinal sins for journalists: He made up more than two dozen stories. Fantastic performances from a solid cast of sometimes under-the-radar stars including Peter Sarsgaard, Chloe Sevigny and Steve Zahn. Cringeworthy for those of us who value research and ethics in our profession. (For those wondering, the other sin is plagiarism.)\n\nMOCUMENTARY: “A Mighty Wind”\n\nIf you didn’t like “Spinal Tap,” “Best in Show” or “Waiting for Guffman,” read on. A classic mockumentary with carried-over cast favorites like Catherine O’Hara, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Jane Lynch, John Michael Higgins and Fred Willard. Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy wrote (and star) in this movie, about a tribute concert bringing back folk stars from years ago. Smart humor throughout. Who need holes in records?\n\nBIOPIC: “American Splendor”\n\nPaul Giamatti stars as Harvey Pekar in this biopic about the Cleveland comic artist. Pekar works a dead-end file-clerk job but brings the complexities of everyday life to the pages of comic books through his cynical lens. So he is, in essence, an everyday Superman. Be warned, as viewers are admonished: “If you’re the kind of person looking for some fantasy figure to save the day, guess what? You’ve got the wrong movie.”\n\nFOREIGN: “Oldboy”\n\nAt its core, this movie might have the creepiest plot ever. This psychological-action-thriller dives deep into the art of calculated revenge. A man is kidnapped and held in solitary confinement for 15 years. He gets out, a changed man, and seeks the truth as to what happened to him. This movie played at the Cleveland International Film Fest and spawned an American version. (Spike Lee directed the 2013 American version of “Oldboy,” which stars Josh Brolin and Samuel L. Jackson.)\n\nHOLIDAYS: “Love Actually”\n\nMore than half a dozen relationships, interconnected to varying degrees, are laid out around Christmastime. It truly is about every shade of love – unrequited, fulfilled, platonic and over-the-top romantic. It’s definitely a film that draws positive and negative reactions. A smart comedy, sweetly done, and the relationships actually are easy to keep straight. Not every one is a romantic couple, which adds to the film’s charm. It stars Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth and many others. Bonus: Rowan Atkinson steals his scenes.\n\nGOING BACK FURTHER\n\n30 years ago – 1993 movies\n\n• “A Bronx Tale” – Who would you rather want as a father, Robert De Niro or Chazz Palminteri? (The brilliant car-unlock scene is priceless.)\n\n• “Groundhog Day” – Great film that lives. Stephen Tobolowsky steals the show as Ned… Ned Ryerson?!\n\n• “Indecent Proposal” – A wealthy man asks another man for permission to sleep with his wife – but doesn’t need the woman’s OK. Nothing wrong here, right?\n\n• “Jurassic Park” – Some things should be better left alone – like resurrecting dinosaurs.\n\n• “Philadelphia” – Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie that tackles the AIDS epidemic from just a decade earlier.\n\n• “Rudy” – Who doesn’t root for underdogs? Go Irish.\n\n• “The Sandlot” – Kids pull together on and off the diamond.\n\n• “Schindler’s List” – One man fights a noble, righteous battle against horrific atrocities.\n\n• “Sleepless in Seattle” – A romcom even non-romcom fans can get behind.\n\n40 years ago – 1983 movies\n\n• “A Christmas Story” – Ralphie wants a gun for Christmas, and we’re all rooting for him.\n\n• “All the Right Moves” – The late Chris Penn doesn’t get nearly the accolades his more famous brother Sean gets, but he’s solid in a supporting role in this Tom Cruise football / coming-of-age movie.\n\n• “The Big Chill” – Boomers hold reunion.\n\n• “Flashdance” – Just your typical welder-by-day, dancer-by-night story.\n\n• “National Lampoon’s Vacation” – The Griswolds take a cross-country trip, we’re along for the ride, and a franchise is started.\n\n• “The Outsiders” – Stay gold, Ponyboy, and stars are born.\n\n• “Risky Business” – A primer of what to do – and not do – if your parents go away and you live in a nice house in the suburbs.\n\n• “Scarface” – Operation Mariel Boatlift: How much cocaine can one man do?\n\n• “Trading Places” – The ol’ social-class switcheroo.\n\n• “Valley Girl” – Underrated California-teen film with great music.\n\n• “WarGames” – If a computer asks you, “Do you want to play a game?” say no.\n\n50 years ago – 1973 movies\n\n• “American Graffiti” – Set in 1962, it takes place over one night around a drive-in.\n\n• “Paper Moon” – Father-daughter bond over scams.\n\n• “Serpico” – Al Pacini stars as a whistle-blowing cop.\n\n• “Soylent Green” – You might not be hungry after this movie, people.\n\n• “The Sting” – Cons play the long game.\n\n60 years ago – 1963 movies\n\n• “It’s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World” – Anyone who was anyone from the ‘60s is in this slapstick chase farce.\n\n• “Pink Panther” – Peter Sellers is brilliant in the first of the franchise as Inspector Jacques Clouseau.\n\nPrevious coverage\n\nHere are our past 20-year movie lookbacks:\n\n2022: Movies from 2002\n\n2021: Movies from 2001\n\n2020: Movies from 2000\n\n2019: Movies from 1999\n\n2018: Movies from 1998\n\n2017: Movies from 1997\n\n2016: Movies from 1996\n\nI am on cleveland.com’s life and culture team and cover food, beer, wine and sports-related topics.
