But I found myself watching this incredible story and was transfixed by it. Not only in this documentary gorgeously photographed, the narration, interviews and background material are all first-rate. It tells the story of the magnificent Seabiscuit, a horse deemed \"ugly,\" too small and too insignificant to make the slightest impact on the track. The documentary beautifully weaves in the hindered jockey, Red Pollard, who had broken his leg three times and was considered a \"cripple,\" in the jargon of the 30's. But Pollard and the Biscuit fuse together and beat War Admiral, the most fabled horse of the era. You get to see actual footage of Seabiscuit pulling away and trouncing the noble War Admiral. I found myself jumping up and down, screaming, \"Go, Biscuit!\" Yup, this film is that mesmerizing. The rags-to-riches story and the ending, in particular, will leave you spellbound. This is a magnificent story, the only criticism is that it's too short at only 60 minutes.\"\n\nMarvelous -- with or without the book!\n\nT. McGohey | Pfafftown, NC USA | 04/22/2003\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"After reading Hillenbrand's captivating book last year, I was really looking forward to this PBS special, and it did not disappoint. Lots of footage of Seabiscuit, on and off the track, and he's even more captivating on screen than I expected (and I'm someone who generally prefers the written image to the visual one). The producers do an excellent job of setting the larger historical context, and of weaving in interviews with a wide variety of people, including Hillenbrand and Red Pollard's daughter, whose comments were very poignant. The biggest compliment I can give this show is that it will appeal to both those who have and have not read the book. For the latter, it covers not only the highlights of Seabiscuit's career, but also his low points, and the heartbreak of Pollard's life, and the hardship of a typical jockey's life, as well. It covers much ground in only an hour without seeming rushed or crowded. The producers did well in selecting material. For those who have read the book, I found the story just as fresh and exciting the second time around. It's a wonderful compliment to the book, and made me want to go back and reread it. The closeup footage of actual races is mesmerizing, more dramatic than any artificial special effects in Hollywood movies. I understand that a movie version is coming out soon, but I can't imagine it equalling, much less surpassing, this documentary. In this case, I'm betting that Plato's injunction against deception of art will prove true: the real thing is better than an imitation. The only thing better than this documentary would be a ride on the Great Horse himself.\"\n\nExcellent for all ages\n\nT. McGohey | 11/01/2003\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I read the book, and saw the Hollywood film. Loved the book, was disenchanted with the movie as it left out so many rich details... of course a movie can never be as thorough as a book, but I felt the Hollywood film fell far short of what it could have been. I wanted to share the Seabiscuit story with my kids, ages 11, 9 and 8 and ordered the PBS DVD, and none of us were disappointed. The PBS film includes much depth in describing the life of a jockey, the action on the race track, the historical circumstances and the characters in this tale. I found the PBS film far superior to the full length feature film. It was amazing to see actual footage of the races and of the beloved little horse. We watched it with the kids, and their grandparents. All of us loved it! Highly recommended.\"\n\nYou've seen the film, now watch the actual Seabiscuit run\n\nLawrance M. Bernabo | The Zenith City, Duluth, Minnesota | 08/15/2003\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Okay, the only question here is whether you would enjoy watching this PBS \"American Experience\" documentary about Seabiscuit after watching the hit theatrical film. The answer is yes.The match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral goes exactly like it was done in the film, but there is something to be said for watching footage of the actual race. Seabiscuit lets War Admiral catch up with him but holds off the challenger and blows past him on the straightaway, pulling away at the end. The footage and shots of Red Pollard sitting on top of the 7-year-old Seabiscuit after finally winning the Santa Anita $100,000 race are quite poignant and there is also the fact that you actually get to see Seabiscuit it all his awkward glory. This documentary shows that the theatrical film is essentially faithful to the dramatic highpoints of Seabiscuit's racing career. In terms of the human beings in the horse's life that boils down to his trainer Tom Smith in the first half of the documentary and his jockies, primarily Red Pollard, in the second. This has to be because the idea that both horse and rider could come back from problems that left the pair with four good legs between them is a story that writes itself. When ESPN put Secretariat on its list of the 50 Greatest Athletes of all time I had no problem with that. I have a pet theory that says you really fall in love with only one horse in your life; for some that would be Black Beauty or the Pie or Trigger or Citation or the one in their own stable. For me it was Secretariat. But I can see where lots of people could end up falling in love with this funny looking horse that died long before they were born could become the horse of their heart.So, whether you come to the documentary from the theatrical film or go to the movies after catching this documentary on PBS during the current pledge drive, I think that you will be satisfied either way. My suggestion would be go to the movies for the Hollywood version and then check out the real thing on this nice little documentary.\"\n\nAn inspiring documentary about an American legend\n\nChris K. Wilson | Dallas, TX United States | 12/18/2003\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I was unaware of the story of racehorse Seabiscuit until viewing this terrific American Experience PBS documentary one evening. To say I was inspired and moved would be an understatement. What a great American story this is, absolutely proving that truth is stranger (if not more exciting) than fiction.For years, American Experience (AE) has produced timely and thought-provoking documentaries about our nation's denizens. This is the first time I can recall AE producing a documentary about not only a sports-related figure, but also an animal. The Seabiscuit story involves a variety of colorful, down-on-their-luck characters symbolizing America's struggle with the Depression. Standing out ahead of the pack is the story of unlucky rider Red Pollard, Seabiscuit's main jockey. AE filmmakers have done a superb job weaving relative and friend interviews with actual footage of Red, bringing to life a man whose heroism symbolized the American Dream. This is where the \"Seabiscuit\" documentary is eventually superior to the film version (which came out the same year). The actual footage of these true-to-life characters is far more interesting than Hollywood's recreation. The narration by husky-voiced actor Scott Glenn is also the perfect accompaniment to the story, well written, succinct and humorous. The race that defined the legend of Seabiscuit was his one-on-one battle with Triple Crown winner War Admiral. The documentary's build-up to this incredible showdown appropriately generates suspense, expertly creating a \"you are there\" sensation. And the race itself, shown in its entirety, turned out to be one of the most intense battles of all time. Viewers unaware of the outcome are in for a dramatic moment.Amazingly, Seabiscuit's story did not end with the epic War Admiral clash. And AE's documentation of the final triumph of the storied horse and his jockey Red will bring a tear to most viewer eyes. Author Laura Hillenbrand, whose best selling novel \"Seabiscuit: An American Legend\" did much to revive this tale for a 21st century generation, is also on hand to offer profound insight into the horse's legend. Her comments get to the root of the story's meaning in relation to the fabric of America.\"Seabiscuit\" is an inspiring documentary, appropriately detailed with historic photographs, old news clippings and newsreel footage, combined with telling interviews and period music. It's hard to imagine this story not touching viewers, no matter the age.\""
