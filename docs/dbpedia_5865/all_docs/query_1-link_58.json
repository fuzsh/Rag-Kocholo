        "text": "American director and screenwriter\n\nFor other people named Gary Ross, see Gary Ross (disambiguation).\n\nGary Ross (born November 3, 1956)[3] is an American screenwriter, director, and producer. He is best known for writing and directing the fantasy comedy-drama film Pleasantville (1998), the sports drama film Seabiscuit (2003), the sci-fi action film The Hunger Games (2012), and the heist comedy film Ocean's 8 (2018).[2] Ross has been nominated for four Academy Awards.\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nRoss was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Gail and Arthur A. Ross, an Oscar-nominated screenwriter (Brubaker). His family is Jewish.[4] He attended (though did not graduate from) the University of Pennsylvania, worked as a fisherman, worked on Ted Kennedy's 1980 Presidential campaign, consulted on both Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential campaign's and Bill Clinton's presidential campaigns, and wrote a novel before being hired to write screenplays for Paramount Pictures.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nBig was his first produced screenplay. Co-written with Anne Spielberg (sister of Steven), it led to an Academy Award nomination and a Writers Guild of America Award. He went on to write several other successful films, including Dave in 1993. In 1998, he wrote and directed Pleasantville, and in 2003, he wrote, directed and produced Seabiscuit, based on Seabiscuit: An American Legend by Laura Hillenbrand. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations.\n\nRoss took on the high-profile project of co-adapting and directing the film adaptation of the first book in Suzanne Collins's Hunger Games trilogy. The film was released on March 23, 2012, and earned $672.8 million worldwide. Although the film was financially and critically successful, Ross opted to not adapt or direct the sequels, citing the rushed production schedule (particularly for both writing and directing) as his main reason.[6]\n\nRoss also wrote and produced the animated feature The Tale of Despereaux, based on the Newbery Medal-winning children's book by Kate DiCamillo. His first book, Bartholomew Biddle and the Very Big Wind, was published by Candlewick Press in 2012. A children's book, it is written completely in verse.\n\nHis next two films as a director and writer were the period drama Free State of Jones (2016) and the heist film Ocean's 8 (2018).\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Director Writer Producer Notes 1986 The Hitchhiker No Yes No Television series (episode: \"Man of Her Dreams\") 1988 Big No Yes Co-producer 1992 Mr. Baseball No Yes No 1993 Dave No Yes No 1994 Lassie No Yes No 1995 The Misery Brothers No Yes No 1997 Trial and Error No No Yes 1998 Pleasantville Yes Yes Yes Directorial Debut 2003 Seabiscuit Yes Yes Yes 2008 The Tale of Despereaux No Yes Yes 2012 The Hunger Games Yes Yes No 2016 Free State of Jones Yes Yes Yes 2018 Ocean's 8 Yes Yes No 2022 Desert Warrior No Yes No\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Award 1988 Big Saturn Award for Best Writing\n\nNominated- Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated- Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay 1993 Dave Paul Selvin Award\n\nNominated- Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nNominated- Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay 1998 Pleasantville Satellite Award for Best Original Screenplay\n\nProducers Guild of America for Most Promising Producer\n\nNominated- Satellite Award for Best Film â€“ Musical or Comedy\n\nNominated- Satellite Award for Best Director\n\nNominated- Saturn Award for Best Writing 2003 Seabiscuit USC Scripter Award\n\nNominated- Academy Award for Best Picture\n\nNominated- Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\n\nNominated- Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Screenplay\n\nNominated- Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing\n\nNominated- Producers Guild of America Award for Best Theatrical Motion Picture\n\nNominated- Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\n\nNominated- Satellite Award for Best Adapted Screenplay\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
