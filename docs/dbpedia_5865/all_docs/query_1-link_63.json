        "text": "Horse racing has been popular for many years, with people loving watching the races – and trying to spot those who could defy the horse betting odds and romp to victory. What makes horse racing betting so fascinating are those horses that rise beyond expectation and come out of nowhere – and surprise everyone by becoming unexpected champions. Seabiscuit is the story of one of those horses – who rises to levels no one believed he could reach to inspire the community, the country, the world – and the film industry.\n\nSeabiscuit was a small horse and a lazy one. He liked to eat and he liked to sleep – and be rather naughty as well. However, when he met three men his life changed and he would become one of the biggest inspirations in the 1930s when people needed it the most. Charles Howard, the owner, Tom Smith, the trainer, and Red Pollard, the jockey all defied expectations to lead the horse to grandeur.\n\nThe film Seabiscuit is based on the best-selling novel by Laura Hillenbrand. It is set in the midst of the Great Depression that had brought America to its knees. It needed inspiration and something to raise its spirits. Seabiscuit was just that. If Seabiscuit could defeat larger horses with distinguished pedigree then it gave everyone a bit of hope.\n\nThe story has a classic sports movie structure – with the climactic race at the end. We are introduced to the three main men first. Charles Howard becomes a self-made millionaire and buys a farm and stables. He becomes a horse owner and breeder that encounters Pollard, the Jockey (played by Toby Maguire) and Smith the trainer (played by Chris Cooper). They have the whole set up in place – but no horse – until Smith places unaccountable faith in Seabiscuit.\n\nThe move treats its audiences to thrilling races, as we would expect and, especially if you are into horse racing, the director and cinematographer allow the audience to get breathtakingly close to the action – making it feel impossible to even know where the camera is as we are swept away right into the heart of the race as the jockeys and horses go nose to nose.\n\nIf you weren’t quite sure how utterly thrilling, difficult and dangerous horse racing was before, this certainly puts some perspective on it. And the relationship between jockeys is intricate, sometimes enemies, often friends – and sometimes highly animated as they plunder across the track.\n\nThis film gives the sense of competition, not just between horses and jockeys, but also between owners – and when Seabiscuit has defeated all champion horses of the west, owner Charles Howard starts strategising to force a race between his horse and Triple Crown Winner and Champion of the East, War Admiral, owned by Samuel Riddle. He campaigns across the country and garners such an overwhelming response of public support that eventually Riddle caves and gives in – but only on his terms… adding even more tension and drama. The horse race’s radio broadcast was heard by one of the biggest audiences in history – with businesses even closing to let employees tune in.\n\nThe film is truly mesmerising and heartwarming. However, the only real weakness it shows is its strange indifference to horse racing betting. Horse racing is intrinsically linked with betting – it’s a fact that is as old as the sport itself. However, in this movie, the Seabiscuit team act surprised to find out that gambling happens at the track… which is curious in itself as anyone involved in the industry would be aware of this. However, that aside, it doesn’t affect the overall enjoyment of a tale as old as time – the underdog defying the odds to steal the hearts of the nation."
