        "text": "Somehow, Y2K seems like forever ago and also just like yesterday. It's the decade when the first iPod debuted, Britney Spears and her snake performed at the VMAs, a whole bunch of new reality TV shows came out, and Beyoncé went ~solo~. It was truly the golden age of pop culture and some...um, interesting fashion trends that I may (or may not) be glad to see making a comeback.\n\nDespite my feelings about low-rise jeans and wearing pants under dresses, I think we can all agree that the movies released during the 2000s did NOT disappoint. I mean, the entertainment back then was never lacking. From throwback comedy movies that'll always make you laugh to memorable rom-coms that made you wish you were a 20-something downing an extra dirty martini, the best 2000s movies are perfect for rewatching over and over.\n\nI don't mean to be dramatic when I say that most of the movies on this list are downright iconic (I mean, hello, Mean Girls *and* Legally Blonde?!). So, whether you're just aching for a rewatch of an incredible film that defined your childhood, or you wanna hear what all the fuss is about, I gotchu. For your viewing pleasure, behold: 50 of the best movies from the 2000s.\n\nSuper Bad (2007)\n\nThis movie is a classic for many reasons. Whether it's seeing a young Jonah Hill and Micheal Cera in their element or the iconic \"McLovin\" that will forever live rent-free in our heads, it's one of those coming-of-age stories that'll never get old.\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nWith perhaps some of the best casting a movie has ever received, it's up to Billy Costigan (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) to secretly infiltrate one of Boston's biggest mafias. Simultaneously, a member of the same mob infiltrates the police department, and, of course, no one wants to be caught red-handed at the end of the day.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire (2008)\n\nThe chokehold that this movie had over the late 2000s should really be studied. When a Mumbai teen is on the brink of winning 20 million rupees on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, he must explain to the police who believe he's cheating how his childhood in the slums of India helped him answer the show's hardest questions.\n\n13 Going on 30 (2004)\n\nJennifer Garner movies hold a special place in my heart, but this one in particular is a fave to have on when you need a little cheering up. Plus, the iconic \"Thriller\" dance scene will never get old.\n\nThe Dark Knight (2008)\n\nIn some people's minds, there's only one Joker, and that's Heath Ledger's Joker. As the second film starring Christian Bale as Batman, this movie's got everything you could want: mind games, chaos, and an i-c-o-n-i-c performance from Heath Ledger.\n\nBring It On (2000)\n\nThis movie ruled the 2000s, and the gals that get it, get it! The Toro cheerleading squad has their sight set on the national championship trophy...until they realize their routines were all stolen from the Clovers. Starring Kirsten Dunst and Gabrielle Union, it's up to each team to BRING. IT. ON.\n\nTwilight (2008)\n\nIf you haven't seen this movie, we're gonna have beef. As a matter of fact, the next time you have a lazy, rainy day, do yourself a favor and watch the entire series all the way through. Trust, the vibes will be immaculate.\n\nLove and Basketball (2000)\n\nTwo childhood friends both aspire to be professional basketball players. While Quincy is a natural born talent, Monica takes the game seriously, and sometimes lets her emotions get the best of her on the court. As their friendship turns into something more, their career paths threaten to tear them apart.\n\nPride & Prejudice (2005)\n\nFrom the performances of Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen as Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy to the classic love story written by Jane Austen to the gorgeous shots of the English countryside to the 18th-century costumes, this movie is a classic for a reason.\n\nMemento (2006)\n\nChristopher Nolan's early masterpiece about losing things (both your memory and loved ones!) is one of those \"twist my brain into a pretzel\" films: You need all your energy to watch it, and then you'll want to watch over and over again.\n\nFinding Nemo (2003)\n\nNBD, one of the cutest movies of all time. Thinking about the lost little clownfish and his scared but determined dad is literally making me tear up right now. Let Pixar give you all the feels (and this isn't the only time one of their animated films will make the list).\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000)\n\nThis became the highest-grossing foreign-language film in American history—and for good reason. It's gorgeous, both the settings and stunts (omg the wire work!!). Plus, it's got not one, but two epic love stories.\n\nSave the Last Dance (2001)\n\nCorny, cheesy, dated, sure, but also kinda hot. People still love this movie and for good reason: It's got a (kinda ridiculous) dance and incredible side characters who deserve their own movies.\n\nMamma Mia! (2008)\n\nIt's not just that the cast is clearly having the best party of their lives shooting this film (although that's a huge part of the appeal). It's not just the songs (although you'll be singing them for weeks). It's the pure joy that's on screen for every single second of this movie.\n\nZoolander (2001)\n\nI for sure quote this movie at least once a week, which is how you know it's a classic. Yes, watching Ben Stiller's beautiful idiot is great, but stay for the super-short Alexander Skarsgård cameo!!\n\nSomething's Gotta Give (2003)\n\nWatching Jack Nicholson's character, Harry, say he's never gonna date a woman his own age and then immediately fall for Diane Keaton's character, Erica, is a hoot. Bonus: Keanu Reeves (Nancy Meyers is a genius).\n\nWatch Now\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (2005)\n\nWatching this will make you wanna call up all your childhood BFFs to catch up, and also maybe do a clothing swap. Also, if you've never seen it, be ready to recognize a whole bunch of these actors.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada (2006)\n\nTHE ultimate fashion film of the 2000s. The clothes! The one-liners that we use to this day! Meryl! Once you watch it, go read this article in which Adrian Grenier basically admits his character was the real villain of the movie. Then, go watch it a bunch more times.\n\nCasino Royale (2006)\n\nIt's hard to remember a time when every single person on Earth didn't know Daniel Craig as James Bond. But also, this is the movie that introduced every single person on Earth to Daniel Craig as James Bond.\n\nMean Girls (2004)\n\nThis movie is, like, the definition of fetch. It's kinda hard to believe it came out two decades years ago considering it's still referenced every single day in my apartment.\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nWhen Elle Woods got into Harvard Law, it felt like we all got into Harvard Law. And who could forget the life-changing magic of bending and snapping?\n\nBorat (2006)\n\nSacha Baron Cohen pretending to be a reporter from Kazakhstan who is making a documentary on why America is so great? Hilarious.\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001)\n\nAll of the Harry Potter movies are their own ~unique~ creations, but The Sorcerer's Stone deserves some credit for launching the entire cinematic Potter universe and bringing Hogwarts to life on screen. Lil bb Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are particularly cute, too.\n\nThe Notebook (2004)\n\nThe Notebook was the first movie that ever made me full-on ugly cry, and nearly two decades later, it STILL GETS ME. Watching Allie and Noah fall in love, get pulled apart, and find each other again is just too pure for my unstable heart to handle.\n\nUp (2009)\n\nThe first few minutes of Up alone could be one of the greatest short films of all time, but better yet, the rest of the movie is also *chef's kiss*.\n\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)\n\nImagine if you could just delete an ex from your memory after you break up...could be kinda useful, no? Well, after Joel (Jim Carrey) learns his ex girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) is getting an experimental new procedure to have exactly that done, he decides he's going to try it, too.\n\nSpirited Away (2001)\n\nThis is the highest-grossing movie in Japan's history (it made even more money than Titanic, brag), so of course Disney bought the English distribution rights. No matter your age, the story of a young girl trying to save her parents from a haunted resort for spirits is a supremely good watch.\n\nLost in Translation (2003)\n\nIf you haven't seen Bill Murray's performance as a washed-up actor who takes a job doing a commercial in Tokyo—during which, he unexpected falls in love with an ambivalently married woman played by the one and only Scarlett Johansson—you need to stream it as soon as humanly possible.\n\nLord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)\n\nThe first installment of the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy came out over 20 years ago (if you're feeling elderly as hell...same) and although our special effects have certainly improved since then, this movie is still a fun time.\n\nShaun of the Dead (2004)\n\nShaun of the Dead proved that comedy + horror is a sweet combo. More importantly, this film possesses two very important qualities: a zombie apocalypse and British accents.\n\nIron Man (2008)\n\nRobert Downey Jr. as the world-saving Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots is really all you need to know. Moving on!\n\nBrokeback Mountain (2005)\n\nI don't know what's more beautiful: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal's heart-wrenching love story, or the absolutely stunning Wyoming mountains. (Obvi, it's the former, but I love hyperboles.) This movie deserves annual screenings.\n\nWALL-E (2008)\n\nWALL-E is one of the greatest Disney movies of all time and, yes, I will go to bat on that. Even without much dialogue, it somehow imparts an important message about taking care of our planet—with a sweet love story on the side! Genius.\n\nJuno (2007)\n\nJuno is a super powerful coming-of-age story about a teenager who is forced to make some very adult decisions. And I don't think it gets said enough, but Rainn Wilson as the convenience store clerk is the cherry on top of it all.\n\nAvatar (2009)\n\nNGL, after seeing this Oscar-winning film, I think we all wished we could turn into Avatars. And who knows, maybe by the time the year 2154 rolls around (psst, yeah, that's when the movie is set), we'll be able to?\n\nAlmost Famous (2000)\n\nIf you don't question the fact that a 15-year-old kid lands a job for Rolling Stone and gets sent to tour with a band, then you can enjoy this cult-favorite movie about new experiences and finding yourself.\n\nSchool of Rock (2003)\n\nWatching Jack Black shred it with a bunch of kids in the early 2000s is the bee's knees. Also, can we all agree that we collectively had a huge crush on Freddy?\n\nMillion Dollar Baby (2004)\n\nWith Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman as co-stars, this movie could be anything but bad. Swanks plays a 31-year-old aspiring boxer, while Freeman is her reluctant coach who turns her into a kickass fighter.\n\nMoulin Rouge (2001)\n\nI'm probably biased because—full disclosure—this is my favorite movie ever, but I'm pretty sure this right here is Nicole Kidman's best performance to date. (Yeah, I'll say it—even better than Big Little Lies!) The musical numbers, opulent outfits, and tragic love story really put it over the top.\n\nNapoleon Dynamite (2004)\n\nGo ahead and make yourself a dang quesadilla and then stream Napoleon Dynamite. It's a delightfully odd movie, indie-like with out-there humor, and super quotable.\n\nLittle Miss Sunshine (2006)\n\nWhen 7-year-old Olive decides she wants to win the Little Miss Sunshine crown at an upcoming beauty pageant, her...shall we say...eclectic family heads out on a road trip to make her dreams come true.\n\nBridget Jones’s Diary (2001)\n\nBridget Jones's Diary is absolutely excellent for many, many reasons (British humor is unparalleled, IMO), but the fact that it features the rom-com trifecta (Renee Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant) makes it a must-watch.\n\nThe Hangover (2009)\n\nThere is no more quotable movie than The Hangover. If you haven't made a \"one-man wolf pack\" reference in a while, here's your official reminder to do so.\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001)\n\nGeorge Clooney takes over for Frank Sinatra in this Steven Soderbergh-directed remake of the 1960 Rat Pack hit. The plot remains pretty much the same: rag-tag team of con artists try to pull off a $150 million heist, but of course, this time around, there's also Brad Pitt.\n\nElf (2003)\n\nOh, Elf. I could watch Will Ferrell prance around New York City in a ridiculous green outfit anytime of the year.\n\nAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)\n\nSpeaking of Will Ferrell, he also delivers an epic performance as the legendary local TV news reporter Ron Burgundy. Never heard of him? He's kind of a big deal.\n\nErin Brockovich (2000)\n\nBased on the true story of Erin Brockovich, who took on the energy corporation PG&E after she figured out that they were poisoning the water in Hinkley, California and giving people cancer. Julia Roberts won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role, just sayin'.\n\nThe 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)\n\nLooking back on it, the fact that Steve Carrell agreed to get his chest fully waxed for this movie should have earned him an Oscar nom on the spot.\n\n500 Days of Summer (2009)\n\nAfter 500 days together, Tom, a greeting card writer, gets kicked to the curb by his girlfriend Summer, so he takes a look back on their relationship to see where things went wrong.\n\nBend It Like Beckham (2003)\n\nEighteen-year-old Jess's parents still won't let her play soccer, but when Jules (aka Keira Knightley) witnesses her skills, she convinces Jess to play for her semi-pro team, which means Jess has to come up with many elaborate excuses to hide her soccer habit from her strict family."
