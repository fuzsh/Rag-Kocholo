        "text": "To use a horse-racing analogy, \"Seabiscuit\" is a little slow out of the gate. In fact, it spends so much time on character back stories and other seeming digressions that you start to wonder if it's ever going to get around to the subject of racing.\n\nBut with films, as with races, it's not how you start that's as important as how you finish. And this film finishes with a really strong burst at the end — one that's certain to leave you with a good warm feeling about yourself and the world in general.\n\nSure, \"Seabiscuit\" is a familiar, rooting-for-the-underdog story. And as such, the film has a lot in common with such recent inspirational sports-based movies as \"Remember the Titans\" and \"The Rookie\" (both of which were also true stories).\n\nAnd like those, this Depression-era drama is also a fine little film. (The PG-13 rating comes almost entirely from a brothel scene that's very brief and considerably more restrained that you might expect.)\n\n\"Seabiscuit\" also features one the best, most solid casts in recent memory. Jeff Bridges stars as Charles Howard, an extremely successful California auto dealer who becomes an almost-reluctant horse owner . . . since his wife, Marcela (Elizabeth Banks), has a love for equestrianism.\n\nBut some of his actions are a bit suspect. First he hires Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), a trainer whose methods and sanity have been questioned. Then he buys an undersized, temperamental colt named Seabiscuit. His choice of riders is also surprising — Johnny \"Red\" Pollard (Tobey Maguire), who's not only taller than his fellow jockeys but considerably more troubled.\n\nHorse-racing action dominates the film's second half, which seems to culminate with the so-called \"Race of the Century,\" pitting the rather diminutive colt against reigning Triple Crown-winner War Admiral.\n\nDirector-screenwriter Gary Ross does a nice job of putting the audience in the harness, as it were, with point-of-view shots that make the race scenes even more exciting. And his screenplay is nicely low-key, as it mixes dramatic and humorous elements quite well.\n\nAs terrific as Bridges and Cooper are, it's Maguire who really gives the film its needed emotional center. His quick-tempered jockey character is instantly likable and sympathetic, a little man everyone can relate to.\n\nSurprisingly, even the equine title character has personality to spare — though the strongest supporting performance comes from William H. Macy as a radio announcer.\n\nHistorian David McCullough's occasional voiceovers are well done and actually benefit the movie, helping to describe the mood of the nation around the time of Seabiscuit's triumphs.\n\n\"Seabiscuit\" is rated PG-13 for scenes of horse-racing violence, as well as some boxing violence and an automobile collision (overheard), scattered use of strong profanity and some racy innuendo (mostly in a brothel scene). Running time: 141 minutes."
