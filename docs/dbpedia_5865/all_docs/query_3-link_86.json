        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton WRITTEN BY: Joshua Garvin\n\nIt's time to update your watch list! Welcome to WatchMojo, and today we're counting down our picks for the 100 most under-appreciated films that you've yet to see. Our countdown includes \"Coherence\", \"Primer\", \"Silent Running\", \"The Women\", \"Waiting for Guffman\", and more!\n\nTop 100 Greatest Movies You've Never Seen\n\nWelcome to WatchMojo, and today we’re counting down our picks for the 100 most under-appreciated films that you’ve yet to see.\n\n#100: “First Reformed” (2018)\n\n\"First Reformed\" is a low-key drama starring Ethan Hawke as a troubled pastor of a small church in upstate New York. Both he and the viewer are forced to meet at the intersection of faith, morality, and environmentalism.\n\n#99: “Forbidden Planet” (1956)\n\n“Forbidden Planet,” while certainly a product of the 1950s, was a pioneer in science fiction, the first that ever depicted humans traveling to a distant star. Decades worth of sci-fi films borrowed elements from the movie, which used groundbreaking special effects.\n\n#98: “Naked Lunch” (1991)\n\nDirector David Cronenberg is known for his terrifying and surrealistic films. \"Naked Lunch\" is no exception. The film chronicles the experiences of a writer who becomes embroiled in a hallucinatory, nightmarish world of addiction, conspiracy, and monstrous typewriters.\n\n#97: “The Wailing” (2016)\n\nNot every director is capable of the discipline required for a slow-burn build-up of tension and terror. Na Hong-jin succeeds in this horrifying thriller about a series of mysterious deaths in a small village that seem to be linked to the arrival of a mysterious stranger.\n\n#96: “In a Lonely Place” (1950)\n\n\"In a Lonely Place\" features one of Humphrey Bogart’s best-ever performances, starring as a troubled screenwriter who becomes a prime suspect in a murder case. It’s a classic noir, filled with high-contrast visuals, and a fascinating plot full of shocking twists and turns.\n\n#95: “Free Fire” (2016)\n\nWhat it lacks in plot, “Free Fire” makes up for with nonstop action. An action comedy about an arms deal gone wrong, “Free Fire” is essentially a feature-length shootout, which can be a lot of fun when executed properly.\n\n#94: “Bottoms” (2023)\n\n“Bottoms\" is a zany, satirical, and queer teen comedy about a group of high school seniors who think that setting up a fight club is the best way to hook up with other girls. It is an absolute rollercoaster stuffed to the gills with hilarious hijinks and insane plans gone horribly awry.\n\n#93: “Queen & Slim” (2019)\n\nReleased a year before the tragic killing of George Floyd, “Queen & Slim” expertly tackled the fear and resentment of police abuse in the African-American community. This modern-day “Bonnie and Clyde” is a romantic drama about a Black couple whose first date takes an unexpected turn thanks to a racist cop.\n\n#92: “George Washington” (2000)\n\nComing-of-age stories always pluck at the heartstrings; the perspective of a child can allow for poetic storytelling as children must contend with a loss of innocence. \"George Washington,\" directed by David Gordon Green, is just such a film about the lives of a group of children in a small Southern town.\n\n#91: “A Boy and His Dog” (1975)\n\nA decade before “Miami Vice,” Don Johnson starred in “A Boy and His Dog” as a young man trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Many of the tropes of modern post-apocalyptic stories owe this movie a great debt, and this O.G. ‘Wasteland’ film doesn’t disappoint.\n\n#90: “Predestination” (2014)\n\n\"Predestination\" is one of several time travel films on this list, but the only one to star Ethan Hawke and “Succession” star Sarah Snook. It’s a thought-provoking film that uses time travel as a means to explore the nature of gender identity.\n\n#89: “The Toxic Avenger” (1984)\n\n\"The Toxic Avenger\" is a cult classic horror-comedy film that has maintained a devoted fan base for forty years, and it’s no wonder. This is a campy delight! It tells the story of a mild-mannered janitor who transforms into a mutated vigilante after falling into a vat of toxic waste. Need we say more?\n\n#88: “Phantom of the Paradise” (1974)\n\nBefore films like “Carrie,” “Scarface,” and “The Untouchables,” Brian De Palma directed a completely insane rock opera satire. “The Phantom of the Paradise” combines elements of \"Phantom” and \"Faust\" to roast the music industry in this hilarious horror.\n\n#87: “The Orphanage” (2007)\n\n\"The Orphanage\" is a Spanish horror movie centered on a woman who returns to the orphanage where she was raised, only to experience terrifying supernatural horror. Few films can match its naturally frightening atmosphere while maintaining a shocking emotional depth to the story.\n\n#86: “Brotherhood of the Wolf” (2001)\n\nVincent Cassel and Mark Dacascos - the ‘chairman’ from “Iron Chef” - star as a pair of adventurers investigating a series of mysterious killings in 18th-century France. It’s a werewolf movie that goes back to the origins of the myths, based on the historical legend of the Beast of Gévaudan.\n\n#85: “The Omega Man” (1971)\n\nYears after the original Vincent Price film and decades before the Will Smith remake “I Am Legend,” Charlton Heston stars as a seemingly lone survivor after a viral apocalypse. “Omega Man” is a gripping depiction of isolation and a harrowing tale of survival in a desolate world.\n\n#84: “The Score” (2001)\n\nBoth Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando won Oscars for portraying Vito Corleone, and they both starred in the heist classic “The Score” alongside Edward Norton. Full of the twists, turns, and betrayals of the genre, “The Score” should be a central part of any heist movie marathon.\n\n#83: “Waves” (2019)\n\n\"Waves\" follows a Black family in the suburbs as they navigate the aftermath of a horrible tragedy. This emotionally powerful story is told through phenomenal cinematography, and hard-hitting performances by Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Sterling K. Brown.\n\n#82: “Marvin’s Room” (1996)\n\nDid you know there is a film out there starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Meryl Streep, Diane Keaton, and Robert De Niro, all of whom deliver powerhouse performances? \"Marvin’s Room\" is a drama about two estranged sisters who reunite when one is diagnosed with leukemia and needs a bone marrow transplant from the other.\n\n#81: “Millions” (2004)\n\n“Millions” is arguably the most heartwarming film from “Trainspotting” director Danny Boyle. When a young boy discovers a bag full of stolen money about to be taken out of circulation, he searches for a way to use it to help others.\n\n#80: “Imagine Me & You” (2005)\n\nOne of the best romantic comedies of the 21st century, “Imagine Me & You” is a queer film starring Lena Headey years before her turn as Cersei Lannister. After handling the floral arrangements for a London wedding, she starts to get especially close to the bride.\n\n#79: “American Honey” (2016)\n\n\"American Honey\" is essentially the Millennial “Almost Famous,” a coming-of-age road movie following a teenage girl who joins a traveling magazine sales crew. It’s an immersive movie, and a delightful road trip tale about freedom, camaraderie, and youthful rebellion.\n\n#78: “Hiroshima mon amour” (1959)\n\n\"Hiroshima mon amour\" is one of the best films to come out of the French New Wave, a powerful meditation on memory, trauma, and healing after World War II. The movie’s beautiful, haunting cinematography makes it a seminal work in cinematic history.\n\n#77: “Backbeat” (1994)\n\nFor any fans of the Beatles, \"Backbeat\" - a musical drama that features the band’s early days - is a must-see. It's a bittersweet look into friendship and the price of fame.\n\n#76: “Hidalgo” (2004)\n\nIn his first role after “The Lord of the Rings,” Viggo Mortensen starred as cowboy and professional racer Frank T. Hopkins, invited to race across the Arabian desert. Adventure films are a rarer commodity these days, and “Hidalgo” is just a feel-good popcorn movie.\n\n#75: “The Pope of Greenwich Village” (1984)\n\nMickey Rourke and Eric Roberts are two New York City cousins who devise a risky and ill-fated plan to steal money from a local mobster. They bring authenticity and pathos to the roles, creating an undervalued gem of 1980s cinema.\n\n#74: “Coherence” (2013)\n\nA comet is the catalyst for a series of strange occurrences experienced by a group of adult friends in this mind-bending modern sci-fi. It’s a clever low-budget film, using limited resources to create tension and suspense.\n\n#73: “Timecrimes” (2007)\n\n\"Timecrimes\" is a Spanish sci-fi thriller about a man who accidentally travels back in time an hour, stumbling into a living nightmare. It’s both clever and suspenseful, providing a take on time travel that is both refreshing and horrific.\n\n#72: “In the Mouth of Madness” (1994)\n\n\"In the Mouth of Madness\" is a Lovecraftian dystopian nightmare from the mind of horror maestro, John Carpenter. Sam Neill plays an insurance investigator who delves into horrific madness while investigating the disappearance of a popular horror author.\n\n#71: “The Handmaiden” (2016)\n\nLGBTQIA+ films are becoming more commonplace in global cinema, leading to innovative and unique stories like that told in “The Handmaiden.” Park Chan-wook directs this sensational erotic thriller about betrayal, desire, and manipulation.\n\n#70: “Frailty” (2001)\n\nIn \"Frailty,\" Bill Paxton believes he is on a mission from God to kill demons disguised as people. Matthew McConaughey plays the son who takes up his legacy in a film ending in a genuinely shocking twist.\n\n#69: “Beyond the Valley of the Dolls” (1970)\n\nCampy, satirical musicals may not be for everyone, but most people will enjoy \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.\" Its blend of dark humor and social commentary follows an all-female rock band's rise to fame and subsequent plunge into the hedonistic excesses of Hollywood.\n\n#68: “The Rider” (2017)\n\nWhile most Westerns are stories of man against man or man against nature, Chloé Zhao’s \"The Rider\" is an incredible man-against-self story. A young cowboy who, after suffering a near fatal head injury, must redefine his life when he can no longer ride horses.\n\n#67: “Bamboozled” (2000)\n\nSpike Lee’s \"Bamboozled\" is a satirical drama focusing on a frustrated Black TV writer who creates a successful modern minstrel show featuring Black actors in blackface. The film is an explicit commentary on race, media, and cultural stereotypes, featuring powerful acting.\n\n#66: “THX 1138” (1971)\n\nGeorge Lucas’ feature film debut stars a young Robert Duvall bucking against a future society where humans are controlled by a totalitarian regime that suppresses emotions and individuality through drugs and strict regulations. It’s a bold imagining of a dehumanized future and a provocative examination of freedom and conformity.\n\n#65: “24 Hour Party People” (2002)\n\nBands like Joy Division and New Order were born thanks to Manchester's influential music scene from the late 1970s to the early 1990s. The film chronicles the rise and fall of record label owner Tony Wilson through a captivating blend of humor and historical insight.\n\n#64: “The Women” (1939)\n\n\"The Women\" is a revolutionary film for its time, starring an all-female cast with an insightful commentary on social dynamics and gender roles. It’s funny, with the repartee and sharp wit of the era’s screwball comedies.\n\n#63: “Eddie the Eagle” (2015)\n\nEddie Edwards was an unlikely British ski-jumper who overcame numerous obstacles to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics. Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman star in this biopic about Eddie, telling a heartwarming and uplifting story through charming performances.\n\n#62: “The Northman” (2022)\n\nRobert Eggers directs this retelling of the Norse tale that inspired Shakespeare’s “Hamlet.” \"The Northman\" is an epic revenge thriller that follows a young Viking prince on a quest to avenge his father's murder and reclaim his kingdom.\n\n#61: “Blood and Black Lace” (1964)\n\nItalian giallo - or murder mystery - films are stylish but unknown gems to American audiences, and “Blood and Black Lace” is a standout of the genre. A masked killer targets fashion models in a high-end boutique, revealing dark secrets and brutal murders.\n\n#60: “A Most Violent Year” (2014)\n\nJessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac are two of the best actors working today, and their joint performance in ”A Most Violent Year” is truly masterful. Morality loses out to ambition as a New York businessman devolves into criminality to protect his family.\n\n#59: “The Bigamist” (1953)\n\n\"The Bigamist\" is a drama about a man who accidentally marries two women and finds himself torn between them. For 1953, it’s a surprisingly nuanced study of human relationships, with a sensitive portrayal of complex characters.\n\n#58: “Strange Days” (1995)\n\nRalph Fiennes and Angela Bassett star in Kathryn Bigelow’s \"Strange Days,\" a sci-fi thriller set in a dystopian Los Angeles on the brink of the new millennium. While its view of now-modern technology is at times silly, it nevertheless tackles the intersection of ethics and technology in visually interesting ways.\n\n#57: “Hell or High Water” (2016)\n\nCaptain Kirk and The Dude are at loggerheads in this modern Western about two brothers who embark on a series of bank robberies to save their family's ranch. The economic hardships of modern American life are center stage in this thought-provoking crime drama.\n\n#56: “Amores perros” (2000)\n\nOne of the best Mexican films in the last few decades, “Amores Perros” weaves together three interconnected stories linked by a car accident in Mexico City. Love, betrayal, and fate collide with this gritty depiction of urban life in Mexico City, making it a standout in contemporary Latin American cinema.\n\n#55: “Nightmare Alley” (1947)\n\nThe original “Nightmare Alley,” released in 1947, is a classic noir about a con artist who rises to fame as a mentalist. His downward spiral of greed, manipulation, and self-destruction was unusual for the time, providing an in-depth view of the seedy world of carnival life and human depravity.\n\n#54: “Trollhunter” (2010)\n\n\"Trollhunter\" is a Norwegian found-footage film about a group of students documenting a man who hunts trolls in the wilderness. The movie combines a unique blend of fantasy and humor with incredible Norwegian landscapes.\n\n#53: “Possession” (1981)\n\nDivorce, espionage, and family drama meet supernatural horror in the 1981 Polish movie “Possession.” Director Andrzej Żuławski creates an art-house classic in this nightmarish web of obsession, violence, and demonic possession.\n\n#52: “Attack the Block” (2011)\n\nWhat happens when a teenage gang is the last defense between a South London council estate and an alien invasion? That is the plot of “Attack the Block,” a hilarious action movie that helped put future “Star Wars” star John Boyega on the map.\n\n#51: “Session 9” (2001)\n\n\"Session 9\" is a creepy, psychological horror film about an asbestos removal crew working in an abandoned mental asylum. It is a dark plunge into insanity and it's impossible to watch the movie without a pervasive sense of dread.\n\n#50: “Westworld” (1973)\n\nDecades before the HBO remake, Yul Brynner starred in the original “Westworld” film about theme park robots rebelling against their guests. It is a bleak and suspenseful film about the ethics of advancing technology that set the stage for future movies like “Jurassic Park.”\n\n#49: “Eyes Without a Face” (1960)\n\n\"Eyes Without a Face\" is a bizarre French horror film about a surgeon who kidnaps young women in an attempt to graft their faces onto his disfigured daughter. It is an early entry in the body-horror genre and is an explicit commentary on the obsession with beauty.\n\n#48: “The Killing” (1956)\n\n\"The Killing\" is a classic film noir directed by Stanley Kubrick about a meticulously planned racetrack heist that unravels due to human folly and fate. Its intricate plot is told through the use of then-innovative non-linear storytelling and is the granddaddy of all modern heist films.\n\n#47: “Waiting for Guffman” (1996)\n\n\"Waiting for Guffman\" is a lesser-known Christopher Guest mockumentary that deserves its flowers. It tells the hilarious tale of a small-town community theater group preparing for a local celebration, eagerly anticipating the arrival of a Broadway talent scout.\n\n#46: “Moonlight Mile” (2002)\n\nInspired by his own loss, director Brad Silberling wrote and directed this semi-autobiographical film about the aftermath of murder. It starkly examines the holes and ripples left behind in loved ones after tragedy strikes, and is filled with layered performances.\n\n#45: “Make Way for Tomorrow” (1937)\n\nNearly a century before our current growing senior care crisis, \"Make Way for Tomorrow\" tackled the subject. It highlights the struggles a family must deal with when its elderly members can no longer care for themselves. It’s more relevant today than ever.\n\n#44: “Fly Away Home” (1996)\n\n\"Fly Away Home\" is a quintessential mid-nineties live-action family film that is guaranteed to put your tear ducts to work. A young girl, with the help of her father, raises a flock of orphaned geese and teaches them to migrate south for the winter.\n\n#43: “Pariah” (2011)\n\n\"Pariah\" is a coming-of-age drama about a young African-American woman navigating her identity and sexuality. It deftly navigates sensitive topics with thoughtfulness and care and is a brilliant look at the modern American family.\n\n#42: “The Florida Project” (2017)\n\nThis coming-of-age story, anchored by a stellar performance from Willem Dafoe, follows a precocious six-year-old girl and her friends. Set a stone’s throw from the ‘Most Magical Place On Earth,’ poverty and innocence clash in this visually stunning film by Sean Baker.\n\n#41: “Key Largo” (1948)\n\nBogey and Bacall star in this noir thriller about the residents of a Florida hotel getting trapped by a crew of gangsters in the middle of a hurricane. The tension slowly mounts as our heroes must contend with the worst that both humanity and Mother Nature has to offer.\n\n#40: “The Skin I Live In” (2011)\n\n“The Skin I Live In” is a psychological thriller about a brilliant plastic surgeon who creates an invincible synthetic skin. Pedro Almodóvar is one of the best filmmakers working today, and his film scrutinizes identity, desire, and the boundaries of ethics in science.\n\n#39: “Bone Tomahawk” (2015)\n\nThe horror and Western genres collide in \"Bone Tomahawk,\" a film about a sheriff who must confront a tribe of cannibalistic cave dwellers. It’s intense, gritty, and one of the most under-appreciated horror films of the last decade.\n\n#38: “Brick” (2005)\n\nRian Johnson’s “Brick” is one of the best modern noir films out there, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a high school student and P.I. He navigates a web of intrigue in a world filled with anachronistic dialogue and stylized cinematography.\n\n#37: “The Devil’s Backbone” (2001)\n\nFive years before “Pan’s Labyrinth” hit theaters, \"The Devil's Backbone\" was director Guillermo del Toro’s first foray into the Spanish Civil War. It’s a haunting Gothic horror about a young boy who discovers a horrible, ghostly secret.\n\n#36: “Indiscreet” (1958)\n\nThis second classic film starring Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman is a charming rom-com using international diplomacy as a backdrop. The combination of its pioneering use of split screen and its witty dialogue make it a must-watch.\n\n#35: “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” (2001)\n\nBetween making the leap from Off-Broadway to Broadway, “Hedwig and the Angry Inch” was a cult-classic queer film about a German transgender punk rocker on tour across America. The film’s electrifying music blends perfectly with the themes of identity, love, and self-acceptance.\n\n#34: “The Straight Story” (1999)\n\nAlvin Straight was an elderly man who traveled over 200 miles across Iowa and Wisconsin on a lawnmower to reconcile with his ailing brother. David Lynch directed this moving story, utilizing both gorgeous cinematography and moving, understated performances.\n\n#33: “Wind River” (2017)\n\nTaking a break from the MCU, Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen co-star as a tracker and an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman on a remote Native American reservation. It is a somber portrayal of both a major American problem and of the complicated nature of justice and grief.\n\n#32: “The Harder They Come” (1972)\n\n\"The Harder They Come\" is a Jamaican crime film starring Jimmy Cliff as an aspiring reggae singer who turns to a life of crime. The film has an incredible soundtrack and helped to bring both reggae music and Jamaican cinema to a global audience.\n\n#31: “Hunt for the Wilderpeople” (2016)\n\n\"Hunt for the Wilderpeople\" is a heartwarming dramedy and a lesser known entry in director Taika Waititi’s filmography. A rebellious foster boy and his grumpy foster father become the subjects of a nationwide manhunt, escaping into the New Zealand wilderness.\n\n#30: “Silent Running” (1972)\n\n\"Silent Running\" is an interesting sci-fi movie with an environmentalist twist: a botanist in space defies orders to destroy the last remaining forests from Earth, which have been preserved in giant domes on spaceships. It’s a thought-provoking film about the need to preserve our environment in the face of rapacious industry.\n\n#29: “Ronin” (1998)\n\nRobert De Niro leads an all-star cast in \"Ronin,\" a heist thriller about a group of mercenaries making their way through a series of double-crosses. The film has one of the best car chase sequences ever put to film.\n\n#28: “Matewan” (1987)\n\nDespite being a union-heavy industry, there aren’t many historical dramas out there focusing on labor rights. John Sayles’ “Matewan” is a notable exception, shining a light on the struggles of workers in coal country as they fight for their rights.\n\n#27: “The Scarlet Empress” (1934)\n\nThose who know, know and those who don’t need to find out: Marlene Dietrich is one of the most iconic actors in the history of cinema. In \"The Scarlet Empress\" she stars as Catherine the Great, transforming from an innocent young princess into the powerful Russian empress.\n\n#26: “Mr. Nobody” (2009)\n\nJared Leto stars as Nemo Nobody, a 118-year-old man and the last mortal on an Earth filled with immortals. The film focuses on the various alternative possibilities of his life, a moving study of choice and destiny.\n\n#25: “Dogtooth” (2009)\n\n\"Dogtooth\" is an unsettling and provocative Greek film about a couple who isolates their children from the outside world as a means of social control.
