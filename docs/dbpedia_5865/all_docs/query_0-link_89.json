        "text": "Recommended movies to help you with your family’s movie selection. I cannot guarantee that you will like every single one and I personally have not seen all of them, but list them on the advice of dear friends. Although we all are concerned about our teenagers, we have different tolerances regarding language, content and violence. As a result, I encourage you to check out a review on the following movies to determine their suitability for the age and stage of your teenager.\n\nGood movies, like good books, are even better when you talk about them. Take advantage maybe the day after to ask your children, “What did you like about it?” “Your favorite part?” “A character you admired?” “A line that sticks with you?” “Any part you didn’t like or thought was a flaw in the film?” “Did the movie have a message?” In this way, you help your children articulate and develop a critical eye, sound judgement and clear principles.
