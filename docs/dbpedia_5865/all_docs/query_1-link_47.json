This is a beautifully restored original film of the life of this world-renowned champion horse.\n\nIn the world of horse racing, Seabiscuit was small, but he proved his abilities on the race track and inspired the nation during the Great Depression. We award this documentary the Dove Family Approved Seal for all ages."
