The Mountain West baseball tournament is set and is a four-team field featuring Fresno State, San Diego State, New Mexico and Nevada.

The Lobos are the top seed and get to host the tournament at their home stadium which starts on Thursday May 25 and runs through Sunday May 28 in a double-elimination tournament.

This year the league is very likely to only send the tournament winner to the NCAA Tournament and that gives New Mexicoâ€™s great offense an edge by being able to host it at Santa Ana Star Field.

Here is the schedule.
