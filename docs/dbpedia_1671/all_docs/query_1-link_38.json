        "text": "I hope your Super Bowl prediction was better than mine as I had the Kansas City Chiefs beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 31-23. Of course, they lost 31-9. But we . We'll start this week's Monday Mailbag with the Super Bowl before shifting into Grant Sherfield questions since a half dozen people asked me if he's going to win the Mountain West player of the year award after his over the weekend. Let's get to the questions. Thanks, as always, for the inquiries.\n\n(Note: If you're not seeing the tweets, it's probably because you're not using Google Chrome. Use Google Chrome.)\n\nAt least I knew one of the teams was going to score 31 points.\n\nYou got the winning team correct, but I don't think Tom Brady's retiring.\n\nTom Brady's career is only half over. He wins seven more Super Bowl rings before retiring at age 63 when he is still playing at a Pro Bowl level. But Brady retires after beating his grandson,John Jr., in Super BowlLXXV. He feels badly about beating his grandson in the Super Bowl, so he finally hangs them up.\n\nNevada wins 73-62 with Grant Sherfield scoring a career-high 29 points.\n\nI got five versions of this question, so I apologize if I didn't pick yours to go here. But everybody wants to know if Grant Sherfield will be the Mountain West player of the year. And he's definitely in the mix. With six Mountain West games left to play (that's 30 percent of the league season), it's premature to name a winner. But Sherfield ranks first in the MW in scoring (19.6), first in assists (6.7), fifth in steals (1.5) and second in free throw percentage (91.1 percent) in conference games (the vote is based on MW play only). His offensive efficiency has been great, and he's been an above-average defender on one of the league's top defenses. He's the league best offensive player (by far) and ranks sixth in defensive win shares. He's first in overall win shares (4.2 with second-placeNeemias Queta at 3.4). He's second in Player Efficiency Rating (PER) behind only Queta (28.8 to 25.7). He also ranks (conference stats only). So the traditional numbers and the advanced numbers favor Sherfield.\n\nWhat does not favor Sherfield is the conference standings. Nevada is fifth in those, and this honor usually goes to the best player on the best team. I don't vote that way, but that's how it goes. Ten of the last 12 MW players of the year came from a team that at least shared the MW regular-season title. Nevada almost certainly isn't winning a share of the title this year. The two exceptions came in2016-17 (Colorado State's Gian Clavell) and2015-16 (Fresno State's Marvelle Harris). In both cases, those teams came in second place. If history holds, Nevada needs a top-two finish for Sherfield to win. Again, that's unlikely barring a sweep of Utah State or Colorado State. The Wolf Pack has to finish strong for Sherfield to win the award because the trophy doesn't often go to teams that finish fifth in the standings, where Nevada currently sits. But if I had to vote today, I'd vote for Sherfield narrowly over Queta. He's been the best player in the conference.\n\n* Utah State's Neemias Queta (30 percent)\n\n* Nevada's Grant Sherfield (20 percent)\n\n* Colorado State's Isaiah Stevens (20 percent)\n\n* Boise State's Derrick Alston, Jr. (20 percent)\n\n* San Diego State's Matt Mitchell (10 percent)\n\nTrue. I loved the college version of Jalen Harris, but he was playing with Jazz Johnson (second-team All-MW), Lindsey Drew (one of the best point guards in school history) andNisr√© Zouzoua (MW sixth man of the year), so he had other capable scorers around him in the backcourt. Harris carried a big load (he made 48.5 percent of his shots in Nevada wins and 38.7 percent of his shots in Nevada losses), but Drew or Johnson could step in at his position if need be. Drew, for example, had30 points, eight assists, six rebounds and five made 3-pointers in the Utah game where Harris hurt his foot. Nevada does not have that kind of depth behind Grant Sherfield this season. If he goes down, some combination of Kane Milling, Daniel Foster andKhristion Courseault replace him at point guard. That's a much steeper decline than going from Harris to Drew. Don't get me wrong. Both were hugely important, but Sherfield's importance to this year's Nevada team is a little higher than Harris' was because of who his backups are. Sherfield is making 48.4 percent of his shots in Nevada wins and 36.2 percent of his shots in Nevada losses. So that's even a little more drastic than Harris' splits last year.\n\nDerrick Alston Jr. and Matt Mitchell are seniors, so they could technically return for another senior season, but I don't think they will. They're gone. David Roddy should be back.Neemias Queta is the most interesting one. I think he's gone, but I could see that going either way.\n\nI broke down what it means for Nevada‚Äî ‚Äî in my Three Takeaways from the series, but it also tells me Boise State was overrated, which I kind of had the feeling it was. The Broncos are now 2-4 in Quad 1 and Quad 2 games and 11-0 in Quad 3 and Quad 4 games. Boise State is probably still an NCAA Tournament at-large team, but it has to at least split its series with Utah State and SDSU to be in a comfortable position heading into the MW Tournament. In terms of the MW, it tells me five teams can win the conference tournament rather than four. I'll put Nevada in that class now. With series remaining with Utah State and Colorado State, the Wolf Pack could thin the MW's at-large chances even more by having success in those series.\n\nFriday's game was a fun one for sure. That was a high level of offensive basketball. I'm not sure it'd make a top-20 list, although it depends on how you're classifying those games. Are we talking about how well Nevada played? The quality of the Wolf Pack's opponent in a Nevada win? Most dramatic ending? It reminded me of the Nevada-Rhode Island game in November 2017, although these two teams are not at the level of those two teams. Nevada won that game, 88-81, and both ended up getting NCAA Tournament at-large berths. Nevada went to the Sweet 16 that year; Rhode Island got to the round of 32.\n\nThe Wolf Pack's turning point might be its blowout of rival UNLV following two losses at Wyoming, but the sweep of Boise State definitely proved more and should be a larger confidence booster. This is going to be the \"rebuilding season\" of Coach Alford's tenure, and it looks like Nevada could still challenge the 20-win mark despite losing four non-conference games due to the season's late start. It's been impressive to see this team get better throughout the season. Quality coaching job by Alford and staff.\n\nThose are Quad 2 wins. Boise State is currently 36th in the NET ranking (must be in the top 25 to qualify for Quad 1 if the game is played at home). Now, these rankings continue to change. If Boise State gets back into the top 25, the wins will turn into Quad 1 victories. Those are not stagnant rankings. Boise State was in the top 25 of the NET at tipoff, but Nevada beating the Broncos twice hurt that NET ranking and pushed it out of Quad 1 territory. That's a bummer for Nevada, but the Wolf Pack isn't in NCAA Tournament at-large contention anyway. If Nevada wins the MW Tournament and gets an auto bid, those are important, though, because it would impact seeding (right now, Nevada would probably be a 13 seed in the tournament).\n\nIn this scenario, Nevada would be 23-7, 15-5 in the MW and riding a 13-game winning streak. That'd include seven more Quad 1 or Quad 2 wins. I and it gave the Wolf Pack a 12th seed. I think that's wrong, though. I'd project a 9 or 10 seed.\n\nI'm a voter in the AP Top 25, and Top 25 teams have been losing a lot of games this season (like 10-plus per week). Gonzaga and Baylor are great, but there's a lot of mediocrity after the top 15 teams, so if Nevada can get up to an 11 or 12 seed and draw a fringe Top 25 team, I think it can spring the upset because of Grant Sherfield's star power. I feel like there will be more upsets in the NCAA Tournament this year than there usually is given how odd the season has been. Nevada could capitalize off that with a great performance by Sherfield and a good shooting night be Desmond Cambridge.\n\nThe interesting thing about the Mountain West is four teams could get at-large bids (Boise State, Colorado State, San Diego State, Boise State), but all four have a large probability of not getting a bid at all. The MW has no locks for the NCAA Tournament (SDSU is the closest to that) but four potentials. And then if you have a team like Nevada get the auto bid, you could feasible send five teams to the Big Dance. The most likely outcome is two or three (slight lean toward three). I just can't tell you what teams those will be. Utah State and Colorado State did nothing in non-conference play, so they're tenuous. Boise State had one good win (BYU). SDSU beat UCLA, Arizona State and Saint Mary's, but only the Bruins are having a good season among those three, so it doesn't have much margin for error. My final answer: three MW teams in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nhas the Nevada men at 3.2 percent odds of winning the MW Tournament and getting into the NCAA Tournament. puts it at 2.9 percent. I've been in the 5 percent range, but I'll bump that up to 10 percent after the Boise State sweep. It's going to be hard to beat three of Boise State, SDSU, Colorado State and Utah State in three days. As for the Wolf Pack women, the MW has three top teams in Colorado State, New Mexico and Fresno State. Nevada is 0-4 against those teams (with a series left against MW-leading Colorado State), so I'd put them at lower odds than the Nevada men of winning the MW Tournament, with the caveat coach Amanda Levens has gotten her team to overperform in all three of the MW tournaments she's coached in thus far. There's just a sizable gap between Nevada and the top of the conference.\n\nThat depends on whether New Mexico opts out of the season after canceling its series against San Diego State. If the Lobos out opt ( ), that completely changes the bracket. Assuming the 11-team, five-bye bracket, Nevada is on track to play in the No. 4 versus No. 5 game, which would be followed with a matchup against the No. 1 seed (if they beat No. 9) and then No. 2 or 3 (if the bracket holds). So that'd be something like Boise State in the quarterfinal, Utah State in the semifinal and San Diego State in the championship game. That's why the odds of winning are around 3 percent. Getting up to the third seed would be big because that'd only require Nevada to beat two of the MW's top tier teams. It'd open with a team like Wyoming or UNLV in the quarterfinals, which is an easier path, although the Cowboys nuked that path last year in that exact game.\n\nUNLV is not catching Nevada, and the MW had an extra week built in between the end of the regular season and the start of the Mountain West Tournament, so the Rebels should be able to make up those games. The only MW series that has been straight canceled and not postponed is the SDSU-New Mexico series, so those teams will end up two games short (at minimum).\n\nIn terms of Sherfield, I haven't heard any draft buzz on him, so I'd bank on him returning for another season (but perhaps not two more).\n\nNevada needs Kane Milling to defend and hit threes. Coach Alford has said he likes Milling's defense. The Wolf Pack has their advanced metrics defensively, so if Milling is one of the Wolf Pack's better defenders, I'll take their word for it. In terms of the threes, he's made36.4 percent of them over the last 14 games after a slow start. I like Daniel Foster. He's fouled a lot, but he's young and I'd keep giving him 20-plus minutes to grow because he's part of this program's future. Nevada has to let him play through the mistakes. If the Wolf Pack is going to play with an eight-man rotation in its biggest contests, as it did against Boise State, the only question mark for me would be Milling or AlemHuseinovic for the first guard off the bench. I'd stick with Milling as long as he's playing good defense and hitting one or two threes per game.\n\nIt could be first. The others in the mix are the West Coast Conference, the American Athletic Conference and the Atlantic-10. I'd rank them WCC, MW, AAC and A-10 in terms of coaching value. The MW has had a lot of coaching turning in recent seasons, but it has an excellent mix right now with Steve Alford (Nevada), Brian Dutcher (SDSU), Craig Smith (Utah State), Leon Rice (Boise State) and Niko Medved (Colorado State). That's five Power 5-caliber coaches out of 11 jobs. And none of those coaches are making seven figures this season. Not bad at all in terms of value.\n\nI would not say inheriting Jalen Harris, Jazz Johnson, Lindsey Drew,Nisr√© Zouzoua and K.J. Hymes is \"nobody.\" Yes, he had to pull those guys out of the transfer portal, losing only Jordan Brown and Shamiel Stevenson in the process, but Johnson, Drew andZouzoua were entering their senior seasons and weren't eligible to grad transfer and Harris didn't want to transfer and sit out a second straight season. So he inherited a solid roster there. For me, this year has been even more impressive. He got some nice players in last year's recruiting class (Desmond Cambridge, Warren Washington, Zane Meeks) despite being hired in April, hit a home run with the addition of Grant Sherfield and has been able to overcome the unexpected loss of Harris to the NBA a year early. Turning the roster over that quickly (only Hymes remains from the Eric Musselman tenure) without bottoming out has shown how great of a job Coach Alford and his staff have done. And things will only go up . The biggest X factor was getting Sherfield and making sure he was eligible this season. Without him, Nevada would be struggling to win. But Coach Alford's teams always get better as the season goes along, as it has this season, which is the sign of an excellent coach.\n\nAgreed on Coach Alford, although I think you have to give this honor to Mark Fox, who helped recruit Nick Fazekas to Nevada and then landed a handful of NBA players during his five years as head coach, including two under-the-radar prospects (JaVale McGee, Ramon Sessions) who have had decade-long NBA careers, a McDonald's All-American (Luke Babbitt) and another local prep star (Armon Johnson). NBA All-Stars Klay Thompson, Reggie Jackson and Nikola Vucevic as well as Derrick Williams andHassan Whiteside. He had a great eye for talent at Nevada. You can't discount Eric Musselman's success with transfers, including future NBA players Caleb and Cody Martin as well as Jalen Harris, but I give the slight edge to Fox because it's easier to make errors recruiting high school kids.\n\nWow. That's eight questions in one. There's no bad answer to this question, but my answer is Eric Musselman because he would have a massive head start on your first five questions. Through four years, Musselman had 110 wins (Alford's not matching that), four MW titles (that will be hard to match through Alford's first four years), three NCAA Tournament berths (ditto) and a Sweet 16 appearance (you know how hard it is to get to the Sweet 16?). In terms of offense versus defense, I give Alford the edge on defense and Musselman the edge on offense. Musselman's attendance almost literally can't be beat. Three of Nevada's top-four attendance seasons came under Musselman, and that's the thing that gives him the edge over any other Wolf Pack coach. And while Alford might be the better program builder, it's false to say Musselman leaves programs in bad shape. At Nevada, he left four all-league players behind (Harris, Drew, Johnson, Zouzoua, one of whom made it to the NBA) and a McDonald's All-American (Brown). His approach was different because he did most of his recruiting from April-June, so whenever he left there were going to be some roster gaps. But he didn't leave Nevada's cupboards empty, and he built his program from scratch after a 9-22 season. Alford is an excellent program-builder, so he gets the edge there, and the MW seems like a much better fit for him than Power 5 schools from a philosophy standpoint (development over top-50 kids). But don't discount Musselman's impact. Without him, Nevada doesn't get a coach of Alford's caliber.\n\nMost likely not, but getting a potential MW player of the year (Grant Sherfield) and a five-star 7-footer (Will Baker) thanks to Coach Alford's time at UCLA is a pretty good result. That makes missing out on UCLA bounce-backShareef O'Neal feel a lot better. And one of the reasons Baker signed with Nevada was Sherfield. Those two are close. So give Sherfield an assist on that one, too.\n\nI would say, \"Yes,\" but I think a number of teams believe they are Boise State's biggest rival, including Nevada, Fresno State, San Diego State, BYU and Idaho. Only the first three of those are in-conference rivals. Nevada and Boise State started an annual football rivalry in 1971. Fresno State and Boise State only played twice in football before 1995. Nevada and Boise State have played more than 75 times in men's basketball and more than 70 times in women's basketball. These two schools have been all-sports rivals for 50 years, so that qualifies Nevada as the Broncos' top rival in my book. And Boise State men's basketball definitely has a Nevada problem, losing 10 of the last 11 to the Wolf Pack (and 50 of 78 overall). Obviously, Boise State dominates the football rivalry.\n\nYes, that'd be totally unreasonable. That'd cost $100 million-plus, and Nevada has put $15 million-plus into its stadium in the last five years, so that's not happening. Plus, some fans would be mad that there's a track around their new football field. It's a shame the proposed soccer field/track facility on the old Bishop Manogue property next to Nevada's softball field never came to fruition. That would have been a great piece to a Wolf Pack women's sports complex. But the recession hit in the late 2000s and the softball stadium was only partially completed while the soccer/track facility was shelved.\n\nI spoke with Clay Millen today and will post the full interview and a story on our website tomorrow, but I'll go on the record as saying he's a multiple-year starter at Nevada who wins all-conference honors. The Wolf Pack does not have a great history of turning top recruits into productive players. Here's the team's all-time top-10 most highly ranked prospects, : Willie Johnson,Joey Barnes, Malik Henry, Chris Metcalf, Clay Millen, Jamaal Bell, Cortez Woods, Mike Ball,Josiah Bradley and Chris Solomon. And while he's not on here, John Romero should be as he was a four-star prospect when he committed to Nevada. None of those players became all-conference honorees. Only one became a starter. But I think Millen bucks that trend. Things appear set up for him to start for Nevada in 2022 if Carson Strong leaves for the NFL a year early. That would turn Millen into a potential four-year starter after a redshirt season with Strong. He's a talented kid who will play in a quarterback-friendly offense, so I predict success. But part of it stems from whether Coach Norvell is at Nevada for the long haul and doesn't get poached.\n\nYou have to goNorthwestern versus Syracuse there. Those are two powerhouse broadcasting schools. But in terms of former players who turn into color commentators, Nevada has acquitted itself quite well.\n\nOne-time event. I don't see this paving the way to play NHL games in Reno. The appeal of this month's NHL games in Nevada is playing with a big lake in the background. That's not afforded at Lawlor Events Center, the only suitable location in Reno to host a game. Could the Golden Knights try and play a preseason game at Lawlor to spread its fandom to Northern Nevada? I guess you can't completely rule that out, but I would hugely bet against it.\n\nTechnically, six of the seven Super Bowl prop bests I posted Friday were on the advice of my bookie/brother . , so much monies were made if you followed our advice. The only ones we didn't hit were field goal over 47.5 yards and Cameron Brate touchdown, which was obviously a longshot play.\n\nI've been to both campuses and like both campuses, but I would pick Nevada over both. It's wise to save money on your undergraduate degree before paying bigger bucks for your secondary degree, and you can go from Nevada to some elite schools for that secondary degree. That's my honest advice/ Go to UN,R. But if you have to pick between Oregon State and Boise State, it's#GoBeavs. Oregon State is 25 percent more expensive than Boise State, but it's a much higher quality of degree and you won't find a greener campus.\n\nAnd since I'm giving out advice, I would also advise people to skip the \"second house.\" And by \"second house,\" I mean this: People buy their starter home and then they upgrade to a second home (usually after having kids and wanting more space) before eventually buying their dream house. If you can wait 5-7 years and skip buying the second house, you save yourself a ton of money in realtor fees/closing costs. Go from the starter house to the dream house without the middle house. I wish I knew that 15 years ago. I'd be $40,000 richer.\n\nThe post-game press conferences are typically embedded at the bottom of our game stories, which is the case for Friday's game against Boise State. . Nevada also archives its press conferences on .\n\nAlways take the field over one team in a game as fluky as baseball, but the Dodgers are strong favorites. I'd take a combination of the Dodgers/Padres/Yankees over the field, but I'd take the field over any two teams (Dodgers and Yankees, for example). It's pretty obvious many MLB teams are not trying to win this season, but you have almost 10 that could take home the World Series (Dodgers, Padres, Yankees, White Sox, Mets, Braves, Twins, Rays), so I'm not picking the Dodgers over the field even though they're favored to repeat.\n\nAnd Cocoa Pebbles in a landslide over Fruity Pebbles. That's a 4 seed against a 13 seed. ButCocoa Krispies crushes Cocoa Pebbles.\n\nI'd prefer not to have Trevor Bauer the person on my team, but Trevor Bauer the pitcher is good as long as he continues from a league-average pitch into one of the best in the game. If he does that, he's a top-10 pitcher in baseball. The Dodgers basically locked him up for two years, which minimizes the downside risk. I'd rather sign that deal than the one given by the Yankees to Gerrit Cole, a nine-year,$324 million pact with lots of downside later in the 2020s. The Dodgers only had two reliable starters in the offseason, so pairing Bauer with Walker Buehler, Clayton Kershaw and David Price to go with the youngsters (Julio Urias, Dustin May, Tony Gonsolin) makes perfect sense and shouldn't inhibit the team from signing Corey Seager, Cody Bellinger or Buehler long term due to the short length of the Bauer deal. It's a win-win on the field. Off the field, he leaves a lot to be desired. I'll project 110 wins.\n\nI'm just doing my job. I don't root for or against Nevada. I just hope for interesting stories to write about and quick games to be played. It's become more and more acceptable for sports media to root for the teams they cover, which I blame on Bill Simmons. But that's not journalism. That's also one reason I never wanted to cover pro sports. I want to be able to root for the Dodgers, Lakers, Bills and Kings, which I would not be able to do if I covered those leagues.\n\nMy guess is that would come down to one of five players: Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Aaron Rodgers, Patrick Mahomes and Colin Kaepernick. I think Brady and Manning would edge Kaepernick, but I could be underselling him. It'd be hard not to know who Colin Kaepernick is even if you're not a sports fan.\n\nI remember Lucas Weber, the former Nevada football player, telling me his family used to ski on Super Bowl Sunday because the slopes were empty. His dad, Franz, was a world-class skier, and Lucas wasn't heavily into football until he got older. Seems like an ideal day to go for non-sports fan. I've only been skiing once (at Heavenly when I was 16), so I'm ill-equipped to answer your question. It's much better suited for Alex Margulies. But my guess on the top four ski resorts in the area would be Kirkwood,Heavenly,Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows andMt. Rose.\n\nBased on the typical attendance at Peccole Park, I'm not sure anybody fit that bill, but it was a joy to watch Braden Shipley pitch. He was at another level during his sophomore and junior seasons. Watching him throw against Fresno State's Aaron Judge on a frigid Friday night in 2013 was fun.\n\nSolid rotation player. I don't think the combined version of the Martins‚Äî should we call him Caley or Coleb?‚Äî would become a starter, even on a fringe playoff team like the Hornets. Neither player is quite consistent enough from three to be the traditional three-and-D player, even if Cody's defense fills that three-and-D role. Even as separate players, I think they will stick in the league for a second contract. Luke Babbitt lasted eight seasons despite sparse playing time. The Martins are great team players. If you mold them into one, you're getting a more valuable player, but it really comes down to Caleb's shooting in terms of elevating to the starting level. This year, he's at 31.1 percent from three (it was 54.1 percent last season). That figure has to be in the upper 30s. They're two guys who are easy to root for, though, and they have all the intangibles teams want.\n\nPizza. There is no Super Bowl without pizza.\n\nFor snack, we're going bacon-wrapped jalape√±o poppers.\n\nI see Team Ruff outlasted Team Fluff, 73-69. I've only watched the Puppy Bowl once (last year), and I was extremely bored by it. Does that make me a bad person?\n\nWhile in its home arena this weekend, the Spartans said, \"The Santa Clara County directives continue to restrict spectators from attending a team practice, contest, game or athletics event during the 2021 spring semester.\" That looks like a \"no\" on fans.\n\nI believe most (if not all) Wolf Pack fans knew Ryan Radtke was great when he called Nevada games. It didn't take a genius to figure that out. So I don't think he's underrated by Northern Nevada. He's one of the elite broadcasters in the world and should be doing network television games, so maybe he's underrated from that perspective. But I know the people of Reno appreciated his work and did not take it for granted.\n\nDefinitely the Oatly one because it's the only one I remember. So weird. Even weirded than the Dodgers' .\n\nMy first house, which I was able to purchase because of a first-time homebuyer credit offered by the Obama Administration and thanks to Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn creating the Millennium Scholarship which meant I left college with no debt (Democratic and Republican policies helping me out!). But I was able to buy that house in D'Andrea in 2009. I used the equity to buy my second house in Wingfield Springs in 2015. And then I used theequity on that house to buy my third house in Saddle Ridge in 2019. The equity in that house will help us retire at a younger age than otherwise possible. Real estate is valuable.\n\nI never said I hated the bald eagle, but I did call it overrated in an . You know who else called it overrated? Benjamin Franklin, who wrote the bald eagle is \"a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly. He is too lazy to fish for himself.‚Äù I 100 percent agree. Bald eagles are vultures with a good PR agent. They'vescavengers. They're not bad asses like the harpy eagle. They are literally scavengers, nothing better than a condor. Franklin wanted America's national bird to be the turkey, saying they are‚Äúa much more respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America. He is besides, though a little vain and silly, a bird of courage.‚Äù You basically have Franklin calling bald eagles cowards, so take it up withour founding father. Anyway, time for me to go wrangle up a pet turkey. See y'all next week!\n\nSports columnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
