This live broadcast also is available through the Notre Dame athletic department web site at www.und.com.\n\nWebsites:\n\nNotre Dame (www.und.com), Utah (www.utahutes.com).\n\nTONIGHT’S GAME\n\nSeeded first in the Midwest Region of the NCAA tournament, the Notre Dame women’s basketball team has advanced to its fourth NCAA regional semifinals in the last five years with wins over 16th-seeded Alcorn State and eighth-seeded Michigan in first- and second-round games played at the Joyce Center. The Irish defeated the Lady Braves 98-49 in the first round and beat the Wolverines 88-54 in front of their third largest crowd at 9,597.\n\nNotre Dame will meet Utah for the first time ever in the NCAA Midwest Regional semifinals. The fifth-seeded Utes enter the game with a 28-3 record and defeated fourth-seeded and visiting Iowa 78-69 to advance to their first NCAA regional semifinals. The Irish have a 1-2 record in the NCAA regional semifinals, winning in their first appearance in 1997 on their way to the Final Four and losing in 1998 and 2000.\n\nNotre Dame enters the NCAA Midwest Regional semifinals with a 30-2 record and have recorded their second 30-win season in school history. A win in this game, and the Irish would match the 1997 Final Four team for the most wins in a season with 31. Notre Dame entered the NCAA tournament after reaching its fourth BIG EAST championship game in six years in the conference. The Irish, BIG EAST regular-season co-champions with Connecticut with a 15-1 record, lost 78-76 to the host Huskies in the title game.\n\nThe 26-1 regular-season record marked the best in Notre Dame history and has guaranteed the Irish of finishing the 2000-01 season with their best record in the 24-year history of the program. The fewest losses in a season came in the first year (13-4 in 1977-78), while last year’s team sported the best season winning percentage (27-5 for .843). Notre Dame regained the No. 1 ranking on March 5, after being ranked second the previous two weeks. The Irish were ranked first for four weeks before its first loss on Feb. 17.\n\nNotre Dame’s five starters average at least 11 points each, and the Irish are led by three of the best players in the country at their respective positions. Senior two-time All-America center, BIG EAST player-of-the-year and Naismith player-of-the-year Ruth Riley (17.8) leads the BIG EAST in scoring and was the only player in the top 20 of the NCAA statistical rankings for blocks (2nd at 3.1) and field-goal percentage (4th at .637) according to the most recent NCAA statistics. All-America fifth-year point guard Niele Ivey (12.0) stands 11th in the country in assists (7.0) and has scored or assisted on 40 percent of Notre Dame’s 903 field goals. Sophomore guard Alicia Ratay (13.0) leads the nation in three-point shooting (70-129, .543).\n\nA large part of Notre Dame’s success this season also is due to the play of its other two starters, junior Ericka Haney and senior Kelley Siemon, who returned to the lineup against Boston College after missing the three previous games. Haney (11.0) has scored in double figures in 19 games this season and brings a great defensive presence to the Irish lineup. Siemon (11.4) stands second on the team and sixth in the BIG EAST in rebounding (7.2). Playing with a broken left hand, Siemon scored 15 points and had eight rebounds vs. Connecticut on Jan. 15. She had a career-high 15 rebounds to go along with 19 points vs. Rutgers.\n\nRanked among the top five both in field-goal percentage (fourth at .498) and field-goal percentage defense (third at .331) according to the latest NCAA statistics, Notre Dame has a scoring margin of 23 points — third best in the country — and has outscored its opponents by an average of 15 points in the first half. The Irish have shot better than 50 percent from the field in 17 of 32 games (including a season-best 63.5 percent at Pittsburgh), better than 46 percent in 25 of 32 games and at least 40 percent in all but two games. Notre Dame’s defense has held its opponents to under 40 percent in 27 of 32 games — including 21 games under 35 percent and eight games under 30 percent.\n\nThe hot shooting of Ratay, strong point guard play of Ivey (225 assists, 79 steals) and dominating defensive presence and shooting touch of Riley (97 blocks, 211-331 FG, .637) have led the Irish to early leads. Forwards Siemon and Haney have given the Irish timely contributions. Notre Dame stands as one of two teams ranked among the top five NCAA leaders in both field-goal percentage and FG percentage defense according to the latest NCAA statistics.\n\nThe 2001 BIG EAST coach of the year and Women’s Basketball Coaches Association national coach of the year, head coach Muffet McGraw is in her 14th year at Notre Dame with a 318-117 (.731) record and in her 19th as a collegiate coach with a 406-158 (.720) mark. She led the Irish to the No. 1 ranking for the first time ever earlier this season, to eight consecutive 20-win seasons and to six straight NCAA tournament appearances and eight overall.\n\nIRISH IN NCAA TOURNAMENT\n\nNotre Dame has earned an at-large bid into its sixth consecutive NCAA tournament and eighth overall. The Irish have compiled a 12-7 record in its eight appearances, highlighted by a Final Four appearance in 1997. Notre Dame also reached the regional semifinals in 2000 and 1998. Here’s how the Irish have fared in the NCAA tournament (complete boxscores and recaps can be found at the end of the notes section):\n\nMcGRAW NAMED WBCA, NAISMITH NATIONAL COACH OF THE YEAR\n\nIrish head coach Muffet McGraw has been selected as both the Naismith Women’s Coach of the Year and the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association Division I National Coach of the Year — both first for the 14th-year Irish head coach in her 19-year coaching career. McGraw and senior Naismith Women’s Player-of-the-Year Ruth Riley will be honored at an April 7 banquet at the Atlanta Tipoff Club. McGraw and the WBCA winners from the other five divisions will be presented to the WBCA membership at a banquet on Wed., March 28, in St. Louis in conjunction with the NCAA Final Four.\n\nMcGraw’s 14th Notre Dame squad entered the season with high expectations with the return of senior All-American Riley, fifth-year point Niele Ivey and sophomore and 2000 BIG EAST rookie-of-the-year Alicia Ratay, and the Irish more than lived up to those expectations under McGraw’s guidance. The Irish began the season with their highest preseason ranking ever at sixth and quickly began their climb to the top of the rankings. McGraw guided Notre Dame through an early season schedule that featured a pair of top-10 opponents, including a victory over Georgia to win the Coaches Vs. Cancer Challenge and a home victory over Purdue. After an 11-0 record vs. its non-conference opponents, Notre Dame began its BIG EAST schedule with a 5-0 mark, including a 67-46 win over ninth-ranked Rutgers, to set a matchup with Connecticut in a game between the only undefeated teams in the country. In front of the first sellout crowd in school history, Notre Dame recorded its first win over Connecticut and a first over a top-ranked team with a 92-76 victory to take over the No. 1 ranking for the first time. The Irish winning streak improved to 23-0 to start the season before a 54-53 last minute loss at Rutgers. McGraw kept the team’s focus as the squad had done all season long, and after three more BIG EAST victories, the Irish had clinched a share of their first BIG EAST regular-season title. A fourth trip to the BIG EAST tournament final in six years resulted in last-second 78-76 loss at UConn. McGraw leads the Irish this week into their fourth NCAA regional semifinal in the last five years.\n\nNOTRE DAME-COLORADO CONNECTIONS\n\nThe Notre Dame women’s basketball team will be making its first trip to Colorado in the 24-year history of the program. The Irish twice have played Colorado but those games vs. the Buffalo were played in Austin, Texas, in 1984 and Seattle, Wash., in 1994.\n\nNotre Dame has one Colorado native on its all-time roster. Carol Elliott played for the Irish in 1987 and 1988, earning two monograms. Hailing from Grand Junction, the two-time all-state selection from Grand Junction High School played two seasons for the Irish after joining the team as a walk-on.\n\nA second Colorado native will join the Irish next season. Katy Flecky, a native of Lone Tree and a senior at Highlands Ranch High School, will attend Notre Dame next year.\n\nEleven current Irish student-athletes hail from Colorado: ice hockey senior Ryan Clark (Littleton/Arapahoe HS), men’s tennis sophomore Jake Cram (Littleton/Columbine), women’s swimming freshman Lisa Garcia (Denver/Cherry Creek HS), men’s swimming junior Mike Koss (Aurora/Smoky Hill HS), women’s lacrosse Carrie Marshall (Colorado Springs/Air Academy), women’s swimming freshman Laurie Musgrave (Littleton/Arapahoe HS), women’s swimming senior All-American Carrie Nixon (Ouray/Montrose HS), rowing junior Michelle Olsgard (Fort Collins/Fort Collins), women’s tennis freshman Alicia Salas (Engelwood/Cherry Creek HS), track and field freshman Jules Van Dersarl (Colorado Springs/Air Academy) and women’s tennis junior Becky Varnum (Colorado Springs/Cheyenne Mountain).\n\nOther recent notable Irish student-athletes from Colorado include men’s basketball All-American and BIG EAST player-of-the-year Pat Garrity (Monument/Lewis Palmer HS) and baseball pitcher Brad Lidge (Engelwood/Cherry Creek HS). Garrity (1995-98) currently plays for the Orlando Magic, while Lidge (1996-98) was on the 40-man spring training roster for the Houston Astros at the beginning of spring training season this year.\n\nRILEY WINS NAISMITH AWARD\n\nSenior All-America center Riley Ruth has been named the recipient of the Naismith Player of the Year award — a first for the Notre Dame women’s basketball program. Riley was selected as one of 30 preseason candidates for the Naismith Women’s College Player of the Year and one of the 15 finalists for the award. The two-time first-team Associated Press All-American becomes the second BIG EAST player to be named the Naismith Women’s College of the Player Year, joining Connecticut’s Rebecca Lobo, the 1995 recipient. Riley will be honored at an April 7 banquet at the Atlanta Tipoff Club.\n\nNCAA GAMES AT THE JOYCE CENTER\n\nThe Midwest subregional marked the third time NCAA tournament games were held at the Joyce Center. Notre Dame’s second NCAA appearance in 1994 saw the seventh-seeded Irish play host to 10th-seeded Minnesota, with the Gophers winning that first round game 81-76. Notre Dame played host to its first subregional in 2000 when the second-seeded Irish welcomed 15th-seeded San Diego, seventh-seeded George Washington and 10th-seeded UCLA. Notre Dame defeated San Diego 87-61 in the first round and George Washington 95-60 in the second round.\n\nIVEY WINS FRANCES NAISMITH POMEROY AWARD\n\nAll-America point guard Niele Ivey has been named the recipient of the 18th annual Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, presented by the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame to the nation’s outstanding female collegian 5-feet-8 and under who has excelled athletically and academically. Ivey, the first Irish player to receive and first from the BIG EAST since UConn’s Jennifer Rizzotti in 1996, will receive her award on Fri., March 30, at the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association Player-of-the-Year luncheon at the NCAA Women’s Final Four in St. Louis. The Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award, named in honor of James Naismith’s daughter-in-law, is presented to the player who best demonstrates leadership, character, loyalty, all-around basketball ability and excellence in the classroom.\n\nMcGRAW VOTED BIG EAST, WBCA DISTRICT COACH OF THE YEAR\n\nFor the third time in her 14 seasons at Notre Dame, head coach Muffet McGraw has been voted conference coach of the year — her third coaching honor by three different conferences. She was named the North Star Conference coach of the year in 1988 in her first year at Notre Dame and was MCC coach of the year in 1991. Her BIG EAST coach-of-the-year award marks her first since Notre Dame joined the conference in 1995-96.\n\nRILEY, IVEY NAMED AP ALL-AMERICANS\n\nSenior center Ruth Riley has earned first-team All-America honors by the Associated Press for the second consecutive year, while fifth-year point guard Niele Ivey earns All-America honors for the first time in her career as a third team pick. Riley was the only unanimous selection, as all 39 voters placed her on their first-team ballots.\n\nIvey becomes Notre Dame’s first All-America point guard and the fifth Irish player to earn AP All-America honors but just the second to be named to one of the three teams (Beth Morgan and Kathryna Gaither were honorable mention picks in both 1996 and 1997 and Alicia Ratay in 2000).\n\nNotre Dame and Connecticut — with Svetlana Abrosimova on the second team and Sue Bird on the third team — stand as the only schools with more than one player voted to the 15-player three teams.\n\nRILEY VOTED VERIZON ACADEMIC ALL-AMERICAN OF THE YEAR\n\nSenior All-America center Ruth Riley has been voted the Verizon Women’s Basketball Academic All-American of the Year from among the five first-team Verizon Academic All-Americans. The psychology major and Naismith Women’s College Player of the Year boasts a 3.64 cumulative grade-point average and became the first Irish women’s basketball player to earn first-team Academic All-America honors last year. Riley advanced to the national ballot as a first-team all-district selection, while sophomore Alicia Ratay was a second-team pick.\n\nMORE NCAA NOTES\n\nThe Irish played 11 of their 30 games vs. the other 63 teams in the NCAA field and compiled a 9-2 record against those teams. Notre Dame has posted wins vs. top-seeded Connecticut, second-seeded Georgia, third-seeded Purdue, fourth-seeded Rutgers, fifth-seeded Villanova, seventh-seeded Wisconsin and three wins vs. seventh-seeded Virginia Tech. The two Irish losses came at Rutgers and Connecticut by a combined three points.\n\nThe Irish were one of a record five BIG EAST teams to receive bids into the 64-team field. No BIG EAST team earned a seeding lower than seventh and all five advanced to the second round.\n\nThe BIG EAST grabbed two of the four No. 1 seeds –with Notre Dame leading the Midwest Regional and Connecticut seeded first in the East — and three of the 16 subregionals.\n\nTHE RILEY REPORT\n\nNaismith women’s college player-of-the-year Ruth Riley has been at her dominating best this season — making her presence felt on both ends of the court as the only player ranked among the top 20 NCAA leaders in both field-goal percentage and blocked shots. In addition to her offensive efficiency (211-331 FG, 63.7 percentage first in BIG EAST, fourth in NCAA), Riley leads the BIG EAST and is second in the country with 97 blocked shots (3.03/game), while committing just 78 personal fouls (2.43/game). The three-time BIG EAST defensive player of the year is averaging one blocked shot every 9.1 minutes she plays and just one foul every 11.3 minutes of action. Riley had five blocks vs. St. John’s to become just the 19th player in NCAA Division I history to break the 300 blocked-shot milestone. She enters the NCAA Midwest Regional semifinals with 355 blocked shots — ninth best in NCAA history.\n\nSIEMON SHINES IN RETURN TO STARTING ROLE\n\nPlaying with a broken left hand suffered two days earlier vs. Virginia Tech, senior Kelley Siemon sparked the Irish in their win over Connecticut by scoring 15 points and grabbing eight rebounds — her fourth-highest point total of the season. She had a season-high 21 points vs. Wisconsin — including 15 in the second half. She continued her strong play with a double-double in the championship game vs. Georgia (13 points and a game-high 11 rebounds). Siemon, a reserve last year after starting as a freshman and sophomore, was named to the BIG EAST all-tournament team as she led the Irish in scoring (14.2) in their three games.\n\nThe 2001 BIG EAST most improved player sat out the Marquette game — the first game in her career in which she did not play — with a knee injury before returning to the starting lineup vs. USC. She currently is averaging 11.4 points and 7.2 rebounds per game — the fifth-highest rebounding average in the BIG EAST — but missed the Seton Hall, West Virginia and Providence games due to her injured left hand. She recorded her second double-double of the season with a career-high 15 rebounds and a game-high 19 points against Rutgers. Siemon turned in a game-high 17-point performance vs. Pittsburgh when the Irish clinched a share of the BIG EAST regular-season title. Siemon is averaging is 13.9 points and 7.8 rebounds in the last 10 games after scoring just 11 points in her first two games back from her hand injury.\n\nHANEY HELPING OUT\n\nWhile Notre Dame has been led by its three All-America caliber players in Ruth Riley, Niele Ivey and Alicia Ratay, junior forward Ericka Haney has proven to play a large role in Notre Dame’s success this season. Among the team’s most athletic and best defensive players, she enters tonight’s game averaging 11.0 points — markedly higher than her 6.8 average as a sophomore and 6.0 as a freshman. With Notre Dame’s other starting forward Kelley Siemon out of the Marquette game lineup with an injury, Haney turned in the best offensive performance of her career. She made her first 10 field goals before missing her final two and made one of two free throws to finish with a career-high and game-high 21 points. Against Seton Hall with Siemon out of the lineup again, Haney scored 15 first-half points on her way to a game-high 17 points. Haney came within one point of her third double-double of the season with nine points and a game-high 11 rebounds vs. Georgetown. Other strong offensive performances for Haney this season include double-doubles vs. Rice (18 points, 12 rebounds), North Carolina (14 points, 13 rebounds) and Rutgers (12 points, 10 rebounds), game-high 17 points vs. Va. Tech, 17 points vs. Providence, 16 points vs. sixth-ranked Purdue and Syracuse, 14 points and six rebounds vs. Alcorn State and 13 points and seven rebounds vs. UConn. She has scored in double figures in 19 games this season.\n\nRATAY TOPS NCAA THREE-POINT SHOOTERS\n\nSophomore Alicia Ratay has established herself as the best three-point shooter in the country with her 54.3 three-point shooting percentage — the highest percentage in the country. Ratay has connected on 70 of her 129 attempts and her 54.5 percentage is more than 20 percentage points higher than Irish opponents are hitting from the field (33.1) and is more than double their three-point shooting (25.0). Ratay had 11 three pointers in the first two games on just 15 attempts, a percentage of .733. In the season opener vs. Valparaiso, Ratay scored 20 points on 7-12 shooting (6-9 3PT) and nailed four three-pointers in a span of 3:47 late in the first half. She was a perfect 4-4 (3-3 3PT) in the first half of the Arizona game before finishing 8-10 FG, 5-6 3PT and 5-5 FT for 26 points. Ratay was 2-3 vs. Georgia, 3-3 vs. Fordham, 2-4 vs. North Carolina, 1-1 vs. Villanova, 5-8 vs. Purdue, 3-3 vs. Western Mich., 2-3 vs. Marquette, 1-1 vs. USC, 1-3 vs. Va. Tech, 2-3 vs. Rutgers, 3-7 vs. St. John’s, 3-4 vs. Va. Tech, 2-4 vs. Conn., 3-6 vs. Seton Hall, 2-4 vs. West Va., 1-4 vs. Providence and Boston College, 1-3 vs. Pittsburgh, 2-6 vs. Miami, 2-5 vs. Georgetown and Pittsburgh, 4-5 vs. Georgetown after missing her first attempt, 1-2 vs. Va. Tech, 3-3 vs. Connecticut in the BIG EAST final, 3-4 vs. Alcorn State in the NCAA first round and 3-6 vs. Michigan in the NCAA second round.\n\nIRISH ON SAINT PATRICK’S DAY\n\nNotre Dame won on Saint Patrick’s Day for the third time and for the second consecutive year. The Irish have a 3-1 record on March 17, losing at Texas Tech 82-67 in the 1996 NCAA second round, defeating host Texas 86-83 in the 1997 NCAA second round and beating San Diego 87-61 in the 2000 NCAA first round at the Joyce Center before also beating Alcorn State in the first round.\n\n38 AND COUNTING\n\nThe Irish extended their home winning streak to a school-record 38 straight wins at the Joyce Center with the victory over Michigan in the NCAA second round. The streak currently is the second longest active streak in the country, behind Kent (43). The Irish have not lost at home in over two years since a loss to top-ranked Connecticut on Dec. 8, 1998. Notre Dame also has a 49-3 (.942) record in BIG EAST games at the Joyce Center, with Connecticut the only BIG EAST team to beat the Irish at home.\n\nNotre Dame sports a four-year old, 23-game non-conference winning streak at the Joyce Center — a streak that includes wins over Purdue in 1997 and 2000 and victories over a pair of sixth-ranked teams (UCLA and Duke) and 25th-ranked Illinois in 1998-99. Notre Dame’s last non-conference loss at the Joyce Center came over four years ago when 19th-ranked Wisconsin beat the Irish on Dec. 9, 1996. Overall, the Irish are 63-2 (.969) at the Joyce Center in their last 65 home games, with the only losses coming to Connecticut.\n\nIRISH CLAIM SHARE OF BIG EAST TITLE\n\nThe win over Pittsburgh on Feb. 27 clinched a share of a first BIG EAST regular-season title for the Irish, who finished the 16-game conference schedule with a 15-1 record for the second consecutive year. Connecticut also shares the title with a 15-1 record. Other BIG EAST finishes for the Irish are: 15-3 in 1995-96 (second in BIG EAST 6 division), 17-1 in 1996-97 (second in BIG EAST 6 division), 12-6 in 1997-98 (tied for second in BIG EAST 6 division), 15-3 in 1998-99 (third) and 15-1 in 1999-2000 (second). Notre Dame won or shared five Midwestern Collegiate Conference regular-season crowns in its seven seasons in the MCC from 1988-1995.\n\nBIG EAST CHAMPIONSHIP REVIEW\n\nNotre Dame reached its fourth BIG EAST championship game in its six years in the conference and lost to Connecticut for the fourth time. The Irish reached the title game with a BIG EAST-record 89-33 win over Georgetown in the quarterfinals, as the 56-point margin of victory marked the most in a BIG EAST tournament game. First-team all-BIG EAST selection Niele Ivey led Notre Dame with 16 points and eight assists, while sophomore Amanda Barksdale grabbed a career-high nine rebounds.\n\nIn the semifinals vs. fourth-seeded Virginia Tech, top-seeded Notre Dame used a 26-3 run in the first half to pull away from the Hokies with a 30-9 lead. The Hokies, who lost to the Irish for the third time this season, pulled within 40-25 2:19 into the second half but Notre Dame scored 12 of the next 13 points to put the game away. Notre Dame’s defense held Virginia Tech to 17.6 percent shooting in the first half and 26.6 percent in the game.\n\nThe championship matched not only the top two teams in the BIG EAST but the top two teams in the country as top-ranked and top-seeded Notre Dame met second-ranked and second-seeded Connecticut in Storrs., Conn., for the 2001 BIG EAST title. The Irish led 6-0 early in the game before the Huskies scored 12 straight for a 12-6 lead. The fast-paced first half would follow that pattern as Connecticut would build a six or seven point lead only to see Notre Dame pull within one or two points. The Huskies again built a seven-point lead 71-64 at 7:34 but the Irish managed their first tie of the second half at 73-73 with 3:51 remaining. The score would remain tied until a Connecticut three-pointer put the Huskies ahead 76-73 with 49 seconds left. A Ruth Riley bucket with 39 seconds left and a free throw with five seconds left tied the game before Connecticut drove the length of the floor for a buzzer-beating shot in the 78-76 final.\n\nThe Irish shot 51 percent from the field in the game and held the Huskies to 39 percent shooting but Connecticut took 24 more shots than Notre Dame thanks to 19 offensive rebounds and seven fewer turnovers. Riley finished with game-highs of nine rebounds and 23 points, her second 20-point game vs. the Huskies this season. Riley, Siemon and Ratay were named to the all-tournament team.\n\nRILEY SWEEPS BIG EAST AWARDS\n\nSenior All-American Ruth Riley became the first player in league history to win BIG EAST player-of-the-year and defensive player-of-the-year honors and also to win the BIG EAST/Aeropostale female scholar athlete-of-the-year and women’s basketball scholar athlete-of-the-year awards. Riley was a unanimous selection for player of the year — the first for the Irish since joining the BIG EAST in 1995-96 and the first conference player of the year since Karen Robinson won Midwestern Collegiate Conference player-of-the-year honors in 1990 and 1991.\n\nRiley also was named to the all-BIG EAST first team for the consecutive year, while fifth-year Niele Ivey was voted to the first team for the first time after earning third-team honors in 1999 and second team in 2000. Senior Kelley Siemon was voted the BIG EAST most improved player and was an honorable mention all-BIG EAST pick. Sophomore Alicia Ratay, the 2000 BIG EAST rookie of the year, was named to the third team — the only sophomore voted to the first, second or third all-BIG EAST teams.\n\nSENIOR SUCCESS\n\nNotre Dame’s senior class of Imani Dunbar, Niele Ivey, Meaghan Leahy, Ruth Riley and Kelley Siemon wrapped up the first back-to-back undefeated seasons at the Joyce Center with the second-round win over Michigan. The Irish are 15-0 at the Joyce Center this year and were 15-0 last year — including a pair of wins in the NCAA tournament. The only other undefeated season at the Joyce Center came in 1978-79 (5-0). This group of seniors will leave Notre Dame with the best four-year winning percentage in school history with a current record of 105-22 (.827), topping the .797 winning percentage (106-27) of the class of 2000.\n\nAmong the other accomplishments of this group are:\n\nA first-ever share of the BIG EAST regular-season title\n\nA first-ever win over a top-ranked team\n\nThe first No. 1 and No. 2 rankings in the program’s history this season\n\nA school-record 23-game winning streak\n\nA school-record 36-game active home winning streak\n\nA record of 54-2 (.964) at the Joyce Center with the only losses coming to Connecticut\n\nA 22-0 Joyce Center record vs. non-conference opponents\n\nA school-record 12-game road winning streak\n\nIRISH VS. TOP 10\n\nFollowing the victory over top-ranked Connecticut on Jan. 15, the Irish improved to 4-0 this season vs. top-10 opponents and fell to 4-1 after losing to the Huskies in the BIG EAST final. Notre Dame has a 9-6 record vs. all top 10 teams (including 5-0 vs. non-conference opponents) since the start of the 1998-99 season. The Irish have won six straight games vs. top-10 non-conference opponents (#6 Purdue on Dec. 9, #6 Georgia on Nov. 24, #9 North Carolina in ’99-’00, #6 UCLA and #6 Duke in ’98-99, #6 Texas Tech in ’97-98) and nine of their last 11 (also beating #8 Alabama, #8 North Carolina State and #6 Iowa in ’96-97 and falling to Tennessee twice (ranked second and 10th in ’96-97).\n\nRILEY, IVEY LEAVE MARK ON BIG EAST RECORD BOOK\n\nNotre Dame seniors Ruth Riley and Niele Ivey closed their BIG EAST regular-season careers with their names well-represented in the conference record book. Riley played in all 68 BIG EAST games her four years (18 in ’97-98 and ’98-99 and 16 in ’99-’00 and ’00-01), while Ivey missed just one game.\n\nRiley finished in the top 10 in the record book in six categories. She owns the best field-goal percentage in conference history with a 64.6 percentage (419-649), and her 419 field goals are tied for 13th best. Riley finished second to Connecticut’s Rebecca Lobo (227 from 1991-95) in blocked shots with 193 and ranks fourth in free throws attempted (397) and made (297). Her 1,135 points are the eighth most, while her 544 rebounds place her 10th in BIG EAST history.\n\nIvey recorded 394 assists in her 67 BIG EAST games — fourth best in the 19 seasons of BIG EAST women’s basketball. Her 167 steals also stand as eighth best in league history.\n\nIVEY FINALIST FOR LIEBERMAN-CLINE AWARD\n\nIrish fifth-year point guard Niele Ivey has been named one of four finalists for the Conseco Nancy Lieberman-Cline Step Up Award, which honors the nation’s top collegiate point guard in NCAA Division I women’s basketball. The award is a national project of the Rotary Club of Detroit and is presented to the player whose floor leadership, play-making and ball handling skills best personified Lieberman-Cline during her career. Associated Press sportswriters from across the country nominated the 10 finalists and will choose the eventual winner, who will be honored at a noon on April 7, in a luncheon at the Detroit Marriott Renaissance Center.\n\nIvey was joined on the initial list of 10 finalists by two other BIG EAST players — Connecticut’s Sue Bird, the inaugural winner last year, and Rutgers’ Tasha Pointer.\n\nRILEY, McGRAW HONORED BY SI FOR WOMEN\n\nThe March/April edition of Sports Illustrated For Women has honored senior All-America center Ruth Riley and head coach Muffet McGraw as its player of the year and coach of the year. The magazine also named Riley to its All-America first team.\n\nTHE RUTH IS ON FIRE…\n\nSenior All-America center Ruth Riley matched her season-high performance of 29 points vs. Connecticut when she also scored 29 points vs. Pittsburgh. The 2001 BIG EAST player of the year posted her 13th 20-point performance in the last 22 games with 21 points vs. Michigan in the NCAA second round. She also scored 23 points vs. Connecticut in the BIG EAST final, had 21 points vs. Georgetown, 20 points vs. Miami, 24 points vs. Boston College and Syracuse, 28 points vs. West Virginia, 23 points vs. St. John’s, 22 points vs. Rutgers and 27 points at Va. Tech (Jan. 3). The BIG EAST’s leading scorer was selected as the BIG EAST player of the week for the fourth time this season on Feb. 12. Riley ranks among the BIG EAST top four in both conference scoring (first at 17.8) and rebounding (fourth at 7.5).\n\n…WITH IVEY PROVIDING THE SPARK\n\nAll-America fifth-year point guard Niele Ivey has had a hand in nearly half of Notre Dame’s 903 field goals this season. The 2001 first-team all-BIG EAST selection stands fifth on the team with 133 field goals and has assisted on 225 field goals (11th in the NCAA at 7.0 assists/game) to account for 358 of the 903 Irish FGs (40 percent) this season. Of Ivey’s 133 FGs, 50 have been three-point FGs (50-113 for 44.2 percent). Also, the school recordholder for career steals, Ivey moved into Notre Dame’s top-10 career scoring list during the Seton Hall game and currently has 1,379 points. Ivey is the only Notre Dame player ever to score over 1,300 points and record over 700 assists. Ivey also has more than 300 steals and 400 rebounds in her Irish career.\n\n20-WIN SEASONS\n\nNotre Dame’s win over Providence on Jan. 31, brought its record to 20-0 — marking the eighth consecutive year the Irish have had a 20-win season and the 12th in 14 seasons under head coach Muffet McGraw. The 2000-01 Irish have been the quickest to 20 wins in terms of both the number of games needed to reach 20 wins and the calendar date (Jan. 31).\n\nIRISH ON RECORD-SETTING DEFENSIVE PACE\n\nWhile Notre Dame has boasted one of the country’s most potent offensive attacks over the past few seasons, the Irish defense remains on pace to break modern school records for fewest points allowed per game and the lowest opponent field-goal and three-point field-goal percentages. Notre Dame’s defense has limited its opponents to 54.7 points per game (fourth in the country) on 33.1 FG percentage (first in the country) and 25.0 3PT FG percentage, all better than the modern school records of 55.1 points per game in 1981-82, 35.5 FG percentage in 1999-2000 and 28.4 3PT FG percentage in 1996-97. Notre Dame’s opponents have shot better than 40 percent in only five of 32 games this season — Georgia (42.0), Purdue (46.2), Virginia Tech (41.0 on Jan. 3), Boston College (44.6) and Syracuse (43.1).\n\nNOTRE DAME AT NO. 1\n\nThe 92-76 Irish win over previously top-ranked and undefeated Connecticut on Jan. 15, left Notre Dame as the only unbeaten team in the country — positioning the Irish for their ascension to the No. 1 ranking in the Jan. 22 polls for the first time in the 24-year history of Notre Dame women’s basketball. The Irish had been ranked third for six consecutive weeks, the highest-ever ranking for Notre Dame before taking over the top spot.\n\nNotre Dame became the 19th school to hold the No. 1 ranking in the 25-year history of the AP poll. UConn fell one spot to second, the first time in seven seasons one conference held the top two spots.\n\nThe Irish women’s basketball team became the second Notre Dame team to hold the No. 1 ranking in 2000-01. The Irish women’s soccer squad took over the No. 1 ranking on Sept. 18, and held the top spot for 11 weeks, finishing the regular season unbeaten and ranked first with a 20-0-1 record.\n\nThe BIG EAST Conference became just the third conference — joining the Atlantic Coast and Southeastern Conferences — to boast a pair of No. 1 teams in the same season. Two top-ranked conference teams in the same year had happened in just four previous seasons with Auburn and Tennessee in both ’87-88 and ’88-89, Maryland and Virginia in ’91-92 and Tennessee and Vanderbilt in ’92-93. Tennessee and Vanderbilt were ranked first and second, respectively, on Nov. 16, 1993, the last time two conference teams were one-two in the AP poll.\n\nIn addition to the Irish and Huskies holding the top two spots in women’s basketball, Georgetown and St. John’s were the first BIG EAST men’s basketball teams to be ranked first and second. Fifteen years ago both were ranked first during the season and spent a large part of the 1984-85 season holding the top two spots in the polls.\n\nIRISH WELCOME RECORD CROWDS TO JOYCE CENTER\n\nThe Georgetown sellout marked the second this season and second all-time for a women’s basketball game at the 11,418-seat Joyce Center. Notre Dame defeated top-ranked Connecticut in front of its first sellout crowd on Jan. 15, 2001. The Irish drew 95,635 fans to their 15 home games, an average of 6,376 that stands 10th best in the country. Nine of the top 15 and seven of the top 10 crowds in Irish women’s basketball history have flocked to the Joyce Center this season.\n\nIVEY SETS STEALS RECORD\n\nAll-American Niele Ivey had four steals against Providence to bring her career total to 309, breaking current Irish assistant coach Coquese Washington’s Notre Dame career steals record of 307. She enters the NCAA Midwest Regional semifinals with 333 career steals. Ivey (705) moved ahead of Washington (554) for fourth place on the Irish career assist list and moved into third place with seven assists vs. Rutgers on Jan. 6. Ivey surpassed Mollie Peirick’s 651 assists from 1994-97 for second place on the all-time Irish assist list with six assists vs. Miami. With two assists vs. Virginia Tech in the BIG EAST semifinals which brought her season assist total to 200, Ivey joined Molly Gavin (1984-88) as the only Irish players to reach the 200-assist mark in a single season (Gavin had 200-plus assists in each of her final three seasons).\n\nIRISH SET SCHOOL WINNING STREAKS\n\nNotre Dame’s victory over Boston College marked its 21st straight win, breaking the school record for consecutive wins — a record that grew to 23 wins before the first loss. The win over Providence on Jan. 31, matched the school-record 20-game winning streak set just last year — after the previous 15-game mark stood for nine years. The ’99-’00 Irish won 20 straight games from Dec. 11-Feb. 26.\n\nThe 23-game winning streak stands tied for 23rd on the all-time NCAA Division I list of longest winning streaks.\n\nThe Boston College victory also marked Notre Dame’s 11th consecutive road win, breaking the previous school record of 10 straight wins away from the Joyce Center set during the 1993-94 season. The win over Syracuse marked the 12th straight road victory.\n\nThe Providence win marked Notre Dame’s third consecutive January (1999, 2000, 2001) without a loss — a streak that stands at 25 and dates back to Jan. 31, 1998.\n\nNotre Dame has become the first team since both Stanford and Connecticut (1995-96 and 1996-97) and just the seventh in NCAA history to string together consecutive seasons with a pair of winning streaks of at least 20 games.\n\nRILEY SETS FREE THROW RECORD, RATAY ON RECORD PACE\n\nSenior All-America center Ruth Riley made eight free throws vs. Syracuse to break the Notre Dame record for career free throws made, while sophomore guard Alicia Ratay remains on pace to break another Notre Dame free throw record. Riley has made 484 free throws in her career on 642 attempts (also a school record), surpassing the school record 447 free throws made by Beth Morgan from 1993-97 on 549 attempts. Ratay currently sports an 88.4 free-throw percentage (61-69), better than the single-season record 87.1 free-throw percentage set by Sheila McMillen in 1998-99.\n\nIRISH FACE RARE DEFICIT\n\nWhen Georgetown held a four-point lead with 12:48 left in the game, Notre Dame found itself trailing in the second half for just the third time all season before also trailing vs. Connecticut in the BIG EAST final. Georgia and Rutgers also held leads on the Irish in the second half, with Notre Dame holding on to defeat Georgia. Overall in its 32 games this season, Notre Dame has led for 1110 of 1280 minutes (86.7 percent), has been behind for 117 minutes (9.1 percent) and has been tied for 53 minutes (4.1 percent).\n\nRECORD-SETTING DAY\n\nNotre Dame’s win over top-ranked Connecticut on Jan. 15, marked a number milestones for the Irish:\n\nThe Irish posted their first win over Connecticut in 12 meetings.\n\nNotre Dame defeated a top-ranked team for the first time in 10 games, including its first in four games at the Joyce Center.\n\nThe crowd of 11,418 marked the first Joyce Center sellout for a women’s basketball game and the largest crowd in school history, surpassing the 8,134 fans at the 1992 Tennessee game.\n\nRuth Riley went 13-13 from the free throw line for the best single-game performance in Irish history and the sixth-best in the country this season.\n\nThe 46 free throws Notre Dame attempted tied the school record, while Connecticut’s 33 three-point attempts stand as the most ever by an Irish opponent.\n\nMcGRAW WINS 300TH AT NOTRE DAME, 400TH CAREER WIN\n\nNotre Dame’s win over Rice on Dec. 31, marked Muffet McGraw’s 300th win at Notre Dame in her 14th season as head coach of the Irish, while the win over Miami on Feb. 20, marked the 400th win in her coaching career. She has a 318-117 (.731) record at Notre Dame and a 406-158 (.720). Her 317 wins at Notre Dame equal more than 65 percent of the total wins in the 23-plus seasons of varsity Irish women’s basketball.\n\nSEEING DOUBLE\n\nSophomore Amanda Barksdale scored career-highs for points (10) and rebounds (11) to record her first career double-double vs. Alcorn State in the NCAA first round. She also added five blocked shots in the win. Notre Dame has totalled 20 double-doubles in 32 games by seven different players. Other double-double performances for the Irish this season include Ruth Riley (vs. Villanova, Marquette, St. John’s, Connecticut, Providence, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Syracuse), Niele Ivey (vs. Valparaiso, Arizona, Villanova and Connecticut), Alicia Ratay (vs. Va. Tech), Ericka Haney (vs. North Carolina, Rice and Rutgers), Kelley Siemon (vs. Georgia and Rutgers) and Meaghan Leahy (vs. Fordham).\n\nDOUBLE-DOUBLE FOR DOUBLE “3”\n\nFifth-year point guard and third-team Associated Press All-American Niele Ivey entered the season with seven career double-doubles (four in ’99-’00 and three in ’98-’99) and has four in ’00-01. She had a pair of double-doubles in the first two games of the season and a third vs. Villanova. Ivey scored 12 points and had 10 assists and five steals vs. Valparaiso in the season opener and then recorded 11 assists against just one turnover to go along with 14 points against Arizona. She had 11 points, 10 assists, six steals and six rebounds vs. just four turnovers vs. Villanova. Ivey scored 14 points and had her fifth double-figure assist game vs. Connecticut against just five turnovers.\n\nNOTRE DAME AMONG RECENT WINS LEADERS\n\nNotre Dame has won 136 games in its last four-plus seasons, the fifth most wins of any school in the country.\n\nIRISH VS. UNRANKED OPPONENTS\n\nIn addition to its success vs. top-10 teams, Notre Dame has won 64 consecutive games vs. unranked opponents, including a 24-0 mark last year. The last unranked team to defeat the Irish was Boston College on Dec. 30, 1998 (Notre Dame beat a ranked Eagle team later that season).\n\nNCAA AND BIG EAST LEADERS\n\nIn overall games, Ruth Riley’s 13-13 free-throw performance vs. Connecticut is tops in overall and BIG EAST games. Alicia Ratay’s six three pointers vs. Valparaiso in the season opener are tied for the most by a BIG EAST player in a single game this season. Ratay also has the second best three-point shooting game by a BIG EAST player with her 5-6 (.833) vs. Arizona. Meaghan Leahy’s 12 free throws vs. Fordham are tied for second most in the league. Niele Ivey’s six steals vs. both North Carolina and Villanova are tied for fourth most in a single game. Riley’s seven blocks vs. Pittsburgh are the most in overall and BIG EAST games, while Amanda Barksdale’s six blocks vs. Fordham and Georgetown and Riley’s six vs. Virginia Tech are the second best blocks games.\n\nAs a team, the Irish shot 63.5 percent (33-52) vs. Pittsburgh for the second best shooting game of the season by a BIG EAST team. The Irish shot .750 (6-8) from three-point range vs. Marquette for the best three-point shooting percentage. The 31 assists vs. Arizona stand tied for second most in all games this season.\n\nHEAD COACH McGRAW INKS FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT\n\nMuffet McGraw is in her 14th season with the Irish and 19th as a collegiate coach. She recently signed a five-year contract to continue as coach of the Fighting Irish women’s basketball program through the 2004-05 season. McGraw has guided Notre Dame to five consecutive NCAA tournament appearances and seven of the last nine. The Irish followed up their 1997 NCAA Final Four appearance and 31-7 record with an NCAA Sweet 16 appearance in ’98. Then came 26-5 and 27-5 marks the last two years that represent the top two seasons ever at Notre Dame in terms of winning percentage. Prior to coming to Notre Dame, she spent five seasons at Lehigh where she compiled an 88-41 record for a .683 winning percentage. McGraw has been named a finalist for the Naismith Women’s Basketball coach-of-the-year award the last two seasons.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL\n\nNotre Dame raced through its 11 regular-season non-conference games, beating opponents from seven major conferences. The Irish have posted wins vs. the ACC (North Carolina), Atlantic 10 (Fordham), Big 10 (Purdue, Wisconsin), Conference USA (Marquette), Pacific-10 (Arizona, USC), SEC (Georgia) and Western Athletic (Rice).\n\nNON-CONFERENCE SUCCESS\n\nLife outside of the BIG EAST Conference has been good to Notre Dame over the past four years. The Irish sport a 47-9 (.839) overall record vs. non-conference teams in the last four-plus seasons and a 36-5 (.878) record in the regular season. The Irish finished the non-conference portion of their 2000-01 schedule with an 11-0 record — their second unbeaten record vs. their non-conference regular-season opponents in the last three years after an 8-0 mark vs. non-BIG EAST teams during the 1998-99 regular season.\n\nSEASON-TICKET SALES AT ALL-TIME HIGH\n\nSeason-ticket sales for the ’00-01 Irish home season more than doubled from a year ago, going from 940 in 1999-2000 to more than 2,700 for the season. Notre Dame’s average home attendance jumped from a per-game figure of 1,747 in 1996-97 (the year the Irish played in the NCAA Final Four) to 1,914 in 1997-98, then 2,996 in 1998-99 and finally to a 3,392 total in 1999-2000 to rank 26th nationally. Notre Dame averaged 6,376 fans its 15 regular-season home games this season — 10th best nationally.\n\nCOACHES VS.

The Bulldogs scored six straight to lead 71-70 before Alicia Ratay gave Notre Dame a 72-70 lead. After a pair of Ivey free throws and a Georgia basket, Kelley Siemon made one of two free throws for the 75-73 final after the Bulldogs missed a desperation three pointer as time expired.\n\nIn the first game of the event vs. host Wisconsin, Ratay and Riley both were held to single-digit scoring in the same game for the first time, and Ivey and Siemon poured in a combined 43 points. Junior Ericka Haney added 14 points to lead fifth-ranked Notre Dame to an 83-56 win. The Irish built a 41-26 halftime lead on the strength of 17 first-half points from Ivey and pulled away from the Badgers with the help of 15 second-half points from Siemon."
