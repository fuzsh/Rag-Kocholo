        "text": "Projecting The 64, Volume 5\n\nWaking up early (Pacific time) all week to build projections has been refreshing and enlightening. I’ve started to develop familiarity with the baseball at-large candidates similar to my primary focus - the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament.\n\nToday, I’ll add a new description to the week’s work - bubble fatigue. The most important part of accuracy within guessing what a Selection Committee may or may not do, is to begin to understand what their conversations are like and take a shot on teams who you think might be popular in the committee’s eyes. Without further ado, let’s look at a cluster of bubble candidates this morning. The amount of committee influence on four bubble teams is somewhat mind-boggling.\n\nBubble Outlook\n\nFlorida and Kansas State - I have been bullish on the Gators getting in all week, mainly due to earning the magic 13 number of wins in the league, getting above .500 (barely), and AD Scott Stricklin’s potential influence on the committee. If I had a vote, I’d rather see a team from the CAA or a fourth PAC team get a chance instead of the 11th-best SEC team, but that’s just not what I see happening. For K-State, the Wildcats will finish in the mid-40s RPI (45 today) with a KPI ranking of 45. So the Wildcats are hanging in the balance. Enter Casey Scott, Exec. AD and Committee member. Casey will be looking to fight for teams in his league, while not discussing the Wildcats. TCU and Cincinnati (long shot) are also in the bubble picture. I’ve come around on K-State finding a way to grab one of the final spots.\n\nIndiana - AD Scott Dolson is the Big Ten rep on the Selection Committee. Indiana had a nice year for a northern club and is worthy of selection. I think Dolson’s primary job for the league is to ensure they get three teams in. A win by Penn State would likely steal Indiana’s bid from what I can tell. It's still a win for the B1G and Dolson in this scenario. A Nebraska win today, and I think the Hoosiers will hear their name called on Monday morning.\n\nCoastal Carolina - Matt Hogue’s final year on the committee. HC Gary Gilmore retiring. You’ve heard it all before. CCU has holes in its resume, but I do not dare to leave them out of the field with all of the factors.\n\nTCU - The Horned Frogs have shielded themselves from national criticism. A 17-3 non-conference run is keeping them interesting and has held up the TCU RPI at 40 today. They are also strong in KPI at 29. My question - Is there room for both the Frogs and K-State to make it? My next question is, how important are win percentages in Quads? Because TCU is under .500 in both Quads 1 and 2, plus they went under .500 in league play. It seems dicey to me, but the groupthink I’ve seen out there suggests that TCU is relatively safe. I went ahead and put them back in the field today.\n\nJames Madison - There is a home still for the Dukes today. Dukes have to be big Southern Miss fans today. It is difficult to envision the Sun Belt getting five teams in, should Georgia Southern steal the auto-bid later today.\n\nCharleston and Northeastern - These two worthy CAA teams are paying a heavy price in today’s projection. Ran out of room for both. I hope there is room for at least one of them. Bid steals in the AAC and MVC yesterday did not help, and we could see another one in the Sun Belt today (Georgia Southern).\n\nGeorgia Tech - I may have written off the Jackets a little early. They are certainly in the thick of this race for final bids. I thought they needed one win in Charlotte this week, which they failed to do. G-Tech remains out.\n\nCalifornia - I did not expect this yesterday, but California will be out of the field today. I’ve said the Pac-12 will find a way to get four teams in, but sadly it’s harder to see that. Cal’s 192nd-ranked schedule out of conference is tough to overcome. The Bears do have solid marks in the quad record breakdown. Utah AD Mark Harlan is new this year on the committee, he has his work cut out to get the Pac-12 a fourth team. It’s a weird time because his school is going to the Big 12 soon.\n\nUpdate - Hosts\n\nMississippi State - The Bulldogs are trying to overcome traditional RPI challenges (24th today) and leverage strong recent metrics - 16 Quad 1 wins, a KPI ranking of 12, and winning records in each of the breakdowns. Can the Bulldogs overcome the five Quad 4 losses? It is real close. After spending a lot of time comparing them to other hosts, I am leaning yes for them today. Oregon State just does not have the same amount of evidence for earning the spot.\n\nDuke - Will face Florida State today for the ACC Tournament crown. A win and they belong as host in my book. I’ve been impressed with this resume most of the year as well. We will find out all the hosts on Sunday night.\n\nEast Carolina - Yesterday’s loss to Wichita State sunk the Pirates to 23rd in RPI, traditionally a major red flag for hosting chances. John Gilbert from ECU is on the committee. Will be interesting to see where they land. A 2-seed in the projection today, but ECU is still in the mix.\n\nDallas Baptist - Up to 21st in RPI with a big title game today vs. Louisiana Tech. DBU will be worthy of hosting, should the Patriots win today, but it might be too late since the committee is announcing later tonight.\n\nSan Diego - Steamrolled the WCC and WCC Tournament with no hiccups. They are up to 18th in RPI and that warrants a deep look at the Toreros. At last check, USD’s KPI ranking was stuck in the high 40s. Depending on how much the committee values this tool, could determine the fate of hosting.\n\nArizona - Normally, any Pac-12 Champ and Pac-12 Tournament Champ combo would be in line for a national seed, not just hoping to host. It was a down year this year, and despite the Wildcats achieving amazing success, they are still sitting at 31 in RPI and 30 in KPI. Will the committee reach and put regional games in Tucson?\n\nQuick Shoutouts!\n\nNiagara Purple Eagles are dancing for the first time! Joining Northern Kentucky and High Point with this distinction. Will be awesome to see Niagara in a regional after an impressive 38-15 season that included a dominant MAAC Tournament run.\n\nThe Tarleton Texans became the first school in a transitional period to win a conference tournament. WAC rules then handed Grand Canyon the auto-bid due to winning the regular season championship. Lopes thought their season was over, now they have new life.\n\nEvansville winning over Indiana State to earn a second bid in the Valley was great theater. The Purple Aces had a solid year and took advantage of hosting this year’s conference tourney.\n\nNicholls has won back-to-back Southland titles. A very solid baseball league. The Colonels worked their way up to a projected three-seed and will be dangerous in regionals.\n\nVCU beat Richmond four times during the Rams’ current six-game win streak to win the A-10 Tournament. Adds more to the future of the crosstown rivalry.\n\nFIELD OF 64 PROJECTION - SUNDAY MAY 26th\n\nProjecting The 64, Volume 3\n\nChaos is alive and well. It wouldn’t be Championship Week without it. We have made it to Friday and we have key teams who hold the cards for potential bid steals playing in loser brackets or already eliminated in the case of UConn. Ahead of a wild Friday - Let’s break it all down, shall we?\n\nKey Updates - Hosting\n\nAmerican Conference - This is starting to feel like an annual tradition. The ECU Pirates have fallen once again in the AAC Tournament. This leaves Wichita State and Tulane as the remaining unbeaten teams. The AAC now projects as a two-bid league, joining the MVC and Big East. ECU remains alive in the loser’s bracket, where a handful of bubble teams are rooting hard for a Pirates’ rally back to the Title.\n\nSEC - Vanderbilt and LSU have taken this tournament by storm. LSU is solid as a two-seed with no major chance to move to a Host. However, Vandy is up to 17th in RPI today and I have to believe if they seal this tournament with two more wins, they will be a Host on Monday morning. Mississippi State has built a legitimate case as well. The Bulldogs sit at 21st in RPI. They own 19 wins over SEC teams and could get north of 20 league victories in the coming days. They get a crack at Tennessee in a loser-out game today, a win moves the needle (of course).\n\nACC - Duke cooled off NC State, who was red-hot, in a dominant fashion yesterday. The Blue Devils are up to 19th in the RPI and are in the thick of the hosting conversation. They’ve advanced to Saturday’s semifinals and will be playing this weekend for a chance to play Regionals at home in Durham.\n\nBig West - No conference tournament. UC Santa Barbara is just fighting off UC Riverside and hoping to stay high enough in RPI to remain in hosting position. The Gauchos and others (such as ECU) need the Mississippi State’s, Duke’s, and Oklahoma State’s of the world to take another loss. A loss of any kind by UCSB to UC Riverside likely would mean they miss out on hosting. Just an RPI killer if it happens.\n\nKey Updates - Bubble\n\nBid Allocations to focus on\n\nBig Ten gets 3\n\nPac-12 gets 4\n\nBig East gets 2 (clinched now with UConn out)\n\nSun Belt should get 4\n\nThat’s it, everyone else on the Bubble is in a giant pot with very little to no bids left.\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nNortheastern goes 0-2 in the CAA Tournament. A brutal result for the Huskies. A major credit to them for scheduling 31 road games and going 19-12. That keeps their RPI in a good at-large range at 33 today, but it was too difficult to find a spot for them today. This will be a sweaty 75 hours til Selection Monday.\n\nXavier wins a classic game over UConn, then loses a classic game to St. John’s on the same day. I am struggling to find room for three Big East teams. Xavier is at 38 in the RPI and played the second-hardest schedule in the country. Barely out for today, but the Muskies are still playing baseball - which provides its resume a chance to improve.\n\nJames Madison rallied from six down to stun Louisiana. Cajuns are done in two games of the Sun Belt tournament after running away with the regular-season championship. I am keeping Coastal Carolina in the field despite going just 1-2 this week. The KPI is strong for CCU at 19th and the committee influence here cannot be ignored. JMU and Troy are in the thick of a battle for a potential fourth bid for the conference. Georgia Southern is unbeaten this week and could steal the bid. High drama in this tournament.\n\nKansas State is out after a 1-2 Big XII Tourney showing. They find themselves 47th in the RPI, and 43rd in the KPI. I am keeping them on the board with their AD on the committee. Also damaging to the Wildcats, is fellow bubble teams like UCF and TCU continuing to win. Both the Knights and Frogs are climbing into a safe landing spot. Cincinnati had a great conference year, but the RPI fell to 63 after the loss to Texas Tech. That will do it for the Bearcats in 2024.\n\nThe Pac-12 produced two of four potential bid stealers into the Semifinals. USC and Stanford are right in the mix to take the bid. Cal (Bubble In) is also alive and looking to take it themselves. This helps me justify Cal projected in this week. I believe they would be out if USC or Stanford takes the auto-bid. One way or another, I believe the PAC lands with four teams in.\n\nIndiana State (won on Thursday) and ECU are still fighting for a chance to host. They may both be in the loser’s bracket but they have plenty of motivation to storm back and with their tournaments. Right now both leagues are projected as two-bid leagues. Should either rally back to win it, a spot opens for a bubble team.\n\nAs crazy as things are, two more bids could vanish from the Bubble picture. In the WCC, San Diego is still undefeated, but Portland is surging too. Pilots can take that bid potentially. And in the CAA, UNCW is barely out and can win this bid to help the league get two bids. Critical game vs. Charleston today and we may see them meet more times in the Championship, which would only help each of their respective RPI rankings.\n\nFIELD OF 64 PROJECTION - FRIDAY, MAY 24th\n\nProjecting The 64, Volume 2\n\nWelcome to Thursday, everybody. It’s a big moving day today with nearly every top-seed within conference tournament play taking the field. Since Volume 1 on Tuesday, a few impactful results have occurred. Let’s break it down.\n\nUpdates to Automatic Bids\n\nSEC - The Top four seeds all lost on Wednesday, which means the highest remaining team in the winner’s bracket is now Mississippi State. The Bulldogs are on the brink of coming up to take one of the 16 host spots should they stay hot deep into the weekend. Currently up to 19 in the RPI, a top 16 finish will likely bring a regional to Starkville.\n\nSun Belt - Louisiana got beat by Old Dominion in the opener and find themselves in the loser’s bracket right now. Southern Miss is the new projected auto-bid from the league. Both teams remain a projected 2-seed within regionals.\n\nMissouri Valley - One of the key leagues to track as Indiana State is an absolute lock for the NCAAs, but nobody else is even on the bubble. The Sycamores fell in extra innings against SIU yesterday in a marathon. The odds of ISU rallying through the loser’s bracket may be even stiffer thanks to the long game yesterday and going deep into the bullpen. A strong likelihood has emerged for the MVC to become a 2-Bid league. Evansville won and is the host of the tournament here. We went with the Purple Aces for the auto-bid choice because they are already a round deeper than the 2-seed, Murray State. Keep your eye on the Valley.\n\nBig Ten - Top-seed Illinois ran into a recent buzzsaw in Penn State to taste an upset loss to open. For the two-seed Nebraska, it was even worse. To get beat 15-2 against Ohio State is not a great showing. Both the Huskers and Illini remain alive in the loser’s bracket and are part of the projected Field of 64. The projected auto-bid is now Indiana as the highest remaining unbeaten team. We talked about the Hoosiers in Volume 1, a lot of intrigue in Bloomington - especially with their AD on the Selection Committee.\n\nAtlantic-10 - Saint Louis was knocked into the Loser’s Bracket at the hands of Richmond. The Billikens do not own an at-large resume, so this has them entirely out for today. VCU has had a solid year and is the new favorite to win the league. RPI in the 70’s right now with a decent road record. All of that was just enough to get the Rams one of the final three-seeds in Regional forecasting.\n\nSouthland - Lamar’s once-storied season has leaked oil down the stretch. That continued in the SLC Tournament opening loss to eighth-seeded UIW. Nicholls also had another strong season and is the new projected auto-bid. Should Nicholls win this tournament, you may see the Colonels as a three-seed in regionals.\n\nSWAC - An interesting regular season format containing two divisions (West and East) who never face each other. So here at the conference tournament, we have teams facing each other for the first time. The West top-seed Texas Southern fell, so we have switched to the East top-seed, Florida A&M, who took care of business yesterday.\n\nASUN - The league tournament groups the top four seeds for round-robin pool play. I hesitate to change an auto-bid projection based on pool play alone, but in this case, all four teams were tied with 10 league losses. Kennesaw State has emerged thus far with a 2-0 start. Our forecasted champ previously was Austin Peay, who lost the opener. Today, Kennesaw State is the projected auto-bid.\n\nSummit League - The most unpredictable league of them all! Oral Roberts had a rough year for ORU standards and is coming off of their epic run to the College World Series in 2023. Down the stretch, the Golden Eagles have shown more life, and ORU happens to be hosting the conference tournament. Omaha was the original pick, they fell in the opener to Northern Colorado and ORU took care of North Dakota State. Somehow, ORU has made it back into the projected field today after months of misery. Let’s see if they can finish the job this weekend in Tulsa.\n\nBubble Updates\n\nCostly Losses\n\nJames Madison fell to Georgia Southern, dropping the Dukes down to 49th in RPI\n\nGeorgia Tech went 0-2 in the ACC Tournament, dropping to 50th in the RPI\n\nKansas State’s opening-round loss to Kansas hurt from a record standpoint. A nice bounceback win over West Virginia yesterday has the Wildcats at 41 in RPI. Keep in mind that the K-State AD is on the committee. A critical game vs. TCU looms large today.\n\nVirginia Tech needed a monster week. Instead, they go 0-2 and their season is done. There is no chance for the Hokies at this point.\n\nMoving Up\n\nTroy got off to a good start by beating Appalachian State. Despite a 52nd-ranked RPI, the Trojans are 17-10 in road games and crush the rest of the current bubble in that key area. With JMU falling out, finding a home in the forecast for the Trojans was additionally logical.\n\nVanderbilt went from bubbles to a solid two-seed in two performances at the SEC Tournament. Commodores took it to Tennessee on the big stage yesterday.\n\nFIELD OF 64 PROJECTION - THURSDAY, MAY 23rd"
