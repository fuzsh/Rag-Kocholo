        "text": "Oklahoma State was once one of the winningest programs in the Big 12. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Eddie Sutton had the Cowboys appearing regularly in the NCAA Tournament and competing for conference titles.\n\nDuring Sutton’s 16-year tenure, the Cowboys made 13 NCAA Tournaments, two Final Fours and never had a losing season. Since Sutton handed the program over to his son Sean Sutton in 2006, the Cowboys have cycled through four coaches and made just seven NCAA Tournaments.\n\nMike Boynton, who was dismissed on Thursday, made just one NCAA Tournament in seven seasons, dealing with an NCAA postseason ban and eventual apathy from fans and an apparent lack of Name, Image and Likeness funds. Boynton even went public with his gripes late this season.\n\nTexas A&M has been one of the more disappointing teams in the country with an 18-13 overall record and 9-9 in conference play. The Aggies were second in the country in returning scoring percentage at 88.4 percent.\n\nHowever, they have a puncher's chance to go dancing led by their first-team All-SEC guard Wade Taylor IV, who has nine points at the half followed by junior guard Manny Obaseki with eight points. The Aggies have work to do but a win over the Rebels would serve them well.\n\nAs for Ole Miss, it is shooting only 37.9 percent at the half and has been outrebounded 21-15.\n\nNEW YORK - Devin Carter is listed at 6-3. I think it’s generous. He blocked Ryan Kalkbrenner, who is a legit 7-foot That pretty much sums up the first half here in the Big East Tournament quarterfinal game between Providence and Creighton. The Friars, up 33-30 at the break, are playing hard, nasty defense and it’s got KenPom’s 10-best offensive team out of sorts. The team with the third-best effective field goal rating in the nation is connecting on just 28 percent of its shots and is 3 of 16 from the line.\n\nMeanwhile, Devin Carter, who some might argue is a controversial league player of the year pick over UConn’s Tristan Newton, has 11 points, seven boards, two assists, a steal and that block. He also hasn’t come out of the game.\n\nThe Friars are playing for their NCAA Tournament life and it looks like it\n\nAs Blake Hinson sprinted down the crowded corridor just off the Capital One Arena court — the one, at present, three-deep with camera people and various ACC officials — he found his Pittsburgh teammates waiting for him. Specifically, one teammate: Ish Leggett, who stood palms up, holding a flimsy plastic placard bearing Pitt’s logo. Leggett was seconds from slapping that placard onto the large ACC tournament banner in the corridor … but he couldn’t do so until Hinson arrived. Until Pitt’s entire team was there.\n\nUntil, first, he held it up to Hinson and asked his teammate for a favor:\n\n“Bless this b—.”\n\nHinson gladly obliged, rubbing his hands over the plastic square like it was a raging bonfire. A sufficient blessing, indeed. Because Leggett wasted no more time; he rotated the logo, grabbed it around the edges, and proudly plastered it onto the wall in one of four semifinalist spaces.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS — In Fran McCaffery’s 14-year reign at Iowa, his teams have ranked 13th or 14th in scoring defense in six of the last eight seasons. Among the major reasons was his teams’ propensity to give up wide-open shots. In the first half of the teams’ Big Ten Tournament game, Ohio State exploited Iowa’s tendency to leave shooters open, especially from 3-point range.\n\nThe Buckeyes knocked down their first five 3-pointers and 8-of-11 overall, many of which were uncontested. It helped 10th-seeded Ohio State take a 43-38 halftime lead on No. 7 seed Iowa in their matchup. Guard Scotty Middleton knocked down all three attempts and led all scorers with 11 points in just nine minutes. Teammate Bruce Thornton dished seven assists.\n\nIowa, which finished third in Big Ten scoring (after leading the league for five consecutive seasons), still hit 53.8 percent from the floor and is within striking distance of the Buckeyes. But Ohio State connected on 60.7 percent. A full second half awaits in this likely NCAA tournament elimination matchup. Historically, Iowa leads the all-time series 85-84.\n\nThe man sauntered up just as Rick Pitino was finishing a group chat with the assembled media in the bowels of Madison Square Garden. He wore all black — black sweater, black pants and black sunglasses — and a big grin. “Hey, Coach, great job,’’ he said. “You don’t even know who you’re talking to.’’ Pitino smiled that awkward smile you give when you’re supposed to recognize a person but can’t quite place him. The man didn’t make the coach suffer too long. “I’m Walter Berry,’’ he said.\n\nHe did not carry a torch, but he might as well have because, in that moment, St. John’s present finally matched its past. Berry represents all that the Red Storm were, and could never quite become again. It was Berry who teamed with Chris Mullin to help the Johnnies to the 1985 Final Four, and it was Berry who brought the St. John’s half of the Garden to its feet and the Syracuse half to its knees when he blocked Pearl Washington’s shot in the Big East tournament championship game the following year to seal the win.\n\n6-11 sophomore big, Duke\n\nWhile all Kyle Filipowski-rattled discourse is currently focused on The Trip and whether the ghost of Grayson Allen has poisoned him with Dukie Unlikability Cooties, the more relevant consideration for scouts is seeing how Filipowski fares against the top-tier offenses he’ll likely face during the late rounds of the upcoming ACC and NCAA tournaments.\n\nFilipowski is clearly talented and productive, but the topic that warrants further scrutiny is whether his best pro position is the four or the five. Filipowski shows flashes of perimeter skill and can take like-sized players off the dribble all day, but he’s also a 31.4 percent career 3-point shooter and at 71.8 percent career from the line.\n\nWhile he’s not some plodder out of central casting — he averages 2.4 steals per 100 for his career — it still seems questionable whether Filipowski’s feet can hold up on defense as a modern four. However, playing him at the five comes with its own problems; his rebound and block rates are underwhelming for a center, and he’s neither a rim runner nor a post-up masher.\n\nThe ultimate question, then, is whether Filipowski is a big more like Al Horford in that he can toggle between the four and five and play effectively at both, or whether he’s more like Frank Kaminsky and can’t quite do either. There’s only $100 million or so riding on the answer.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNeither 10th-seeded Ohio State nor No. 7 Iowa is assured of making the NCAA Tournament but the teams' Big Ten tournament game undoubtedly will eliminate the loser from future consideration.\n\nThe Hawkeyes (18-13, 10-10 Big Ten) won their head-to-head matchup 69-67 in Iowa City on Feb. 2, but much has changed for the Buckeyes in recent weeks. Ohio State (19-12, 9-11 Big Ten) won its last four games and five of its last six. That includes wins against Purdue and Michigan State. Iowa stumbled for much of the season before winning four of its final six, including road victories against Michigan State and Northwestern plus a home overtime triumph against Wisconsin.\n\nIowa has reached four straight NCAA Tournaments, but with a 59 NET, it needs to beat Ohio State and probably Illinois on Friday to snag an at-large spot. Ohio State isn't in a much better position with a 55 NET.\n\n6-7 junior forward, Iowa\n\nOne of the things I’ve asked scouts I run into is where they’ll be headed for conference tournament week. Thus far, none have told me they’re going to the Big Ten tournament; unusually for a power conference, it is something of a wasteland when it comes to NBA talent this season and may not have a single player picked in the first round.\n\nA few very familiar players, including Purdue’s Zach Edey and Indiana’s Kel’El Ware, could break through into the top 30. But as far as a potential late riser to watch, Sandfort is the Big Ten’s most interesting one.\n\nThe junior’s combination of size (6-7) and shooting (90.1 percent career from the line, 13.9 3-point launches per 100 possessions) automatically gets him on the radar, and he’s not just some standstill catch-and-shoot fungo hitter either. Sandfort had the first triple-double in Iowa men’s basketball history(!) last week when he dropped a 26-10-10 line against Penn State. (Caitlin Clark probably had three in the time I needed to type that sentence.)\n\nSandfort intrigues with his passing skill (five dimes per 100 and more than two for every turnover) and punches above his weight on the glass with an 11.2 percent rebound rate in Big Ten games. The next question is lateral movement; scouts want to see him defend against speed. He won’t get much of that in the plodding Big Ten, but he might if Iowa sneaks an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIowa is firmly on the bubble, opening its Big Ten tourney on Thursday against Ohio State before a potential second-round game against a tough, athletic Illinois team that held Sandfort in check last weekend. The Hawkeyes likely need to win at least twice to get in; otherwise, diehards can check those NIT listings.\n\nRead more here.\n\nMemphis' disappointing season ended with a whimper, as the fifth-seeded Tigers lost to No. 12 seed Wichita State in the AAC quarters, 71-65. Memphis was ranked as high as No. 10 in January, when it started 15-2. But the underlying metrics always suggested trouble, and the team finished 7-8. Worse, the Tigers often looked like they did not enjoy playing with one another, and Penny Hardaway couldn't figure out the chemistry issues.\n\nQuestions will persist about whether Hardaway can ever figure this out; the former NBA star and alum who arrived with such fanfare just completed his sixth season without just two NCAA Tournament appearances and a lone first-round victory to show for it.\n\nWichita State snapped an eight-game losing streak to Memphis and will play UAB on Friday at 3 PM ET.\n\nThe SEC is loaded with great freshmen this season, especially (as ever) at Kentucky, where Reed Sheppard and Rob Dillingham tend to overshadow all the rest. But it’s probably time to take serious notice of South Carolina rookie Collin Murray-Boyles, who suddenly looks like one of the best players in the league.\n\nMurray-Boyles, a top-100 recruit, didn’t make his college debut until Dec. 1 after a bout of mononucleosis. He didn’t make his first start until Jan. 13. And now he’s on an absolute tear. He averaged 16 points, 8.2 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.2 blocks — while shooting 70 percent from the field — during the final 10 regular-season games. Then he dropped 24 points, seven boards and four steals on Arkansas in the second round of the SEC tournament here Thursday afternoon.\n\nSouth Carolina’s 80-66 win over the Razorbacks was its program record-tying 26th victory of the season, coming off an 11-21 mark in coach Lamont Paris’ first year. Now the Gamecocks get Auburn in the SEC quarterfinals Friday, where they’ll try to bully the Tigers with an army of big bodies.\n\nThe 6-foot-7, 230-pound Murray-Boyles is just one of several USC basketball players who could pass for football players. B.J. Mack, the 6-8, 260-pound Wofford transfer, looks like a left tackle. Josh Gray, the 7-0, 265-pound LSU transfer, is one of the most physically imposing players in the league. It’s little wonder the Gamecocks are such a tough out this season.\n\nEric Musselman’s Hogs? Not so much. Their run of three straight Sweet 16s — and two Elite Eights — is over, as Arkansas finished with 16 wins and 17 losses. The pieces, as always a collection of transfers from all over the country, just never did fit this time for Musselman, who earned a technical foul in frustration as he watched the season circle the drain Thursday.\n\nWisconsin guard Chucky Hepburn coolly raised three fingers near his head as he backpedaled down the court after burying a deep shot from at least five feet behind the 3-point line Thursday afternoon. Less than two minutes had passed during the second half of No. 5 seed Wisconsin’s eventual 87-56 obliteration of No. 12 seed Maryland in the second round of the Big Ten tournament, and the game already was well in hand with the Badgers leading by 25 points. But it represented yet another moment that highlighted an unbelievable — and seemingly improbable — 3-point shooting performance.\n\nWisconsin set a season high by making 16 of 25 3-point attempts during a game that effectively was over midway through the first half. This from a team that began the day ranked 183rd nationally in 3-point field goal percentage (33.9 percent). While it’s easy to chalk up what happened to an anomaly against a subpar Maryland team that fell to 16-17, it also served as a reminder that the Badgers (20-12) have the pieces offensively to be a tough postseason out this March.\n\nThis is, after all, a group that is averaging more points per game than any Wisconsin team in 30 years. It’s one with a dynamic leading scorer in St. John’s transfer A.J. Storr, who was second-team All-Big Ten, a veteran core and an infusion of freshman talent from John Blackwell and Nolan Winter. Blackwell’s 18 points paced four players in double figures. How Wisconsin played in terms of efficiency resembled a lot of what the Badgers showed earlier in the season when they rose to No. 6 in the AP Top 25 poll before a 3-8 close to the regular season.\n\nCan Wisconsin stay near this level? That remains to be seen with Wisconsin advancing to play No. 4 seed Northwestern on Friday in a tournament quarterfinal and the NCAA Tournament a week away. But it marked an important step in Wisconsin’s quest to find itself again late this season and play consistently enough to reach its first Sweet 16 under Greg Gard in seven years.\n\n\"Starting to see more of what we were back in January,\" Gard said. \"I felt that the last week or so that we were trending back in the right direction and starting to click. Today it showed again.\""
