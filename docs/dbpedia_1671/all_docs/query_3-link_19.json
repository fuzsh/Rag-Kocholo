        "text": "BABSON PARK, Mass.—After claiming its first New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) championship since 2018 on Sunday, the Babson College baseball team was selected as one of 16 regional hosts when the NCAA announced its Division III Tournament field on Monday afternoon.\n\nUnder the direction of 22nd-year head coach Matt Noone, the Beavers (30-11) defeated No. 4 Salve Regina University on Saturday and Wheaton College twice on Sunday on the way to securing the program's sixth NCAA Tournament berth and first since 2019. Babson, which has reached the 30-win mark for the third time in the last five full seasons, advanced to its first College World Series in 2019 after reaching the regional final in both 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe Beavers will host Mitchell College (32-11) in one of two games on Friday, while No. 7 Salisbury University (28-9) takes on UMass Dartmouth (24-18-1) in the other opening round contest at Govoni Field. The Mariners are making their fourth consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance and the program's eighth overall after winning the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) Tournament in their first season in the league.\n\nThe Sea Gulls, who captured the program's first national title in 2021 and have reached the College World Series in three straight seasons, are making their 28th NCAA Tournament appearance after earning an at-large bid, while the Corsairs went undefeated in the Little East Conference Tournament to punch their ticket to the Division III championship for the first time since 2000 and eighth time overall.\n\nThe four-team double-elimination regional will have three games on Saturday with a champion being crowned on Sunday afternoon.\n\nGame times and ticket prices will be announced later on Monday."
