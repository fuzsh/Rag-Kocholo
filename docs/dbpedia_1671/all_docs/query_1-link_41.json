        "meta_description": "SEC &amp; BIg10 regardless of records and schedules.  Those 2 have different criteria than anybody else.  Watch when football comes around you will see a minimum of 3 teams from each conference in the playoffs but it will be more likely 4 to 5 teams from the SEC.  They will keep the money within those 2 regardless of other teams records and stats. \nThe ACC only having 5 teams in each of the last 3 years when SEC &amp; Big10 have eight is nothing more than a joke.  Look at their success rate in each of the last few years and that will tell how much of a bias there is.  Records, SOS, &amp; others measurements matter for others but the Big 2 conferences will always get their money. \n rich only keep getting richer",
