        "text": "The Prospect League Era\n\nThe Chillicothe Paints are a member of the top collegiate wood bat league in the country, The Prospect League. The Prospect League fields teams in cities throughout Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Tennessee, West Virginia and Missouri. The Chillicothe Paints, the charter member of The Prospect League since 2009, make their home at V.A. Memorial Stadium.\n\nIn the summer of 2007, the idea of forming a baseball league that would be a better fit for the communities who had found Independent Professional baseball growing out of their markets began to be discussed. This idea became the Prospect League, which was officially formed in mid-summer 2008. The core of the new league was formulated to include current and former Frontier League teams in Chillicothe, Ohio, Richmond, Indiana and Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania. During the development process, we found ourselves in conversation with the team owners and the Commissioner of the Central Illinois Collegiate League, which brought a rich 45-year summer collegiate league history to the table, as well as six teams within the footprint the Prospect League were looking to develop. A quick and solid alliance was formed and through continuous talks and negotiations during the fall of 2008, the eleven-team Prospect League was formed.\n\nThe league entered its inaugural season under the Prospect League moniker, but it brings with it plenty of tradition and a long list of former players and coaches who have made it to clubs at the MLB level. The Prospect League is the merger of the startup effort described above, along with the former Central Illinois Collegiate League (CICL), one of the original and most recognized summer baseball leagues in the country. The CICL was formed in 1963 as a charter member of NCAA certified summer baseball. The league maintained certification for the entire 41 years of oversight by the NCAA, which ended its certification program in 2005.\n\nIn the winter of 2008 the six teams of the CICL voted to join the five expansion teams to form the new 11-team Prospect League. Coming from the CICL in the Prospect League's inaugural season were the Dubois County Bombers, Danville Dans, Springfield Sliders, Dupage Dragons, Quincy Gems, and Hannibal Cavemen. Joining them for the 2009 season were the Chillicothe Paints, North Coast Knights, Butler BlueSox, Slippery Rock Sliders, and the Richmond RiverRats.\n\nThe winter of 2009 saw growth for the 2010 Prospect League season, with the addition of the DeKalb County Liners in northern Illinois, the West Virginia Miners in their brand new facility in Beckley, WV, the Terre Haute Rex playing at Indiana State University and the Nashville Outlaws who will host their home games at Vanderbilt University. \"Our goal was to make the Prospect League the best summer collegiate baseball league in the country and the success of the 2009 season along with the quality growth for the 2010 season takes us a long way towards that goal\" said Bryan Wickline, President of The Prospect League. The 2010 season saw the league's new Commissioner come on board. Dave Chase brings a rich history of his own to the table, including several years as General Manager of the AAA Memphis Redbirds. Commissioner Chase joins us in our goal to make this the best summer collegiate program in the nation.\n\nDuring 2011, the league saw some realignment and operated with 14 teams. Dupage closed its operation and the league took over operation of the Nashville team, playing at Lipsomb University for the 2011 season, which saw DeKalb County announce they were not playing in 2012. The league went into 2012 with a much stronger lineup of twelve teams. The new ownership in Springfield, Illinois brought new life into one of the premier markets in the league. A move that was in the works for over a year did not materialize and the Dubois County Bombers left the league in late 2012.\n\nThe 2013 season brings a complete revamp of the Prospect League documents. For the first time, all player information submissions, player contracts, dispositions and reports will be electronic. The new electronic documentation system, as well as the renewal of our stratigic partnership with Pointstreak.com, positions the Prospect League for growth.\n\nPrior to the 2014 season, the Slippery Rock Sliders relocated to Springfield, Ohio and became the Champion City Kings. The Prospect League continued through the season with 11 teams and an eye on expansion to bring the League to an even number of teams for future seasons, helping with scheduling and travel.\n\nBryan Wickline, who has served as President since the first season in 2009, was named the League's second Commissioner heading into the 2015 season with the continuing goal of making the Prospect League the best summer college baseball league in the country and adding teams within the already established league footprint. The Lorain County Ironmen relocated to Jamestown, NY and will play as the Jamestown Jammers (replacing the departed Jammers of MiLB at Russell Diethrick Park). Also, an expansion franchise in Kokomo, Ind., will begin play at a brand-new downtown ballpark as the Kokomo Jackrabbits in the League's West Division, bringing the League to 12 teams. The schedule will feature minimum crossover games between East and West Division teams and nearly all Mondays will be league-wide off days.\n\n2015 saw another successful season on the field for the Chillicothe Paints, as the club earned the league's second-best record at 38-22, good enough for another playoff appearance. At the gate, the Paints once again led the Prospect League in attendance with 54,718 fans for the season, an average of more than 1,800 fans per game.\n\nA change in the management took place for Chillicothe's favorite baseball team in 2016. The team's original owner, Doctor Chris Hanners, sold the majority of the team to a group headed by longtime Paints Vice President & General Manager Bryan Wickline, ensuring that the quality of the gameday experience for fans would continue to be excellent. The Paints set a franchise and Prospect League record for attendance in 2016 with a total attendance of 55,517 and an everage of 1,851 fans per game. On the field, the Paints went 23 and 37, missing the playoffs for just the second time since joining the Prospect League in 2009.\n\nThe 2017 season saw improvement to a 29-31 season, but the Paints missed the playoff for just the third time in nine seasons. Still, the Paints led the Prospect League in attendance and set a franchise record with 58,755 fans in attendance throughout its 30 homes games, an average of 1,959 per game!\n\nThe Paints returned to the playoffs for the seventh time in the 10-season history of the Prospect League in 2018. The Paints finished the year 34-26, second in the East Division. The Paints took game one of the East Division Playoffs from Kokomo at VA Memorial Stadium, but lost games two and three at Kokomo to end their season. Once again, the Paints led the league in attendance, both in terms of total (56,534) and per-game average (1,884). Paints Catcher Dillon Dingler (Ohio State) was named the Prospect League's Top Pro Prospect and pitcher Jack Raines (Baldwin Wallace) took home Reliever of the Year honors.\n\nChillicothe captured its second Prospect League championship in 2019, beating the Cape Catfish three games to two. After a 2-7 start to the season, the Paints won 10 straight and went 41-14 the rest of the season (including playoffs, which the Paints made their eighth appearance in over 11 seasons). Chillicothe once again led the Prospect League in attendance with a total of 57,040 and 2,037 per game. Closer Nate Haugh (Toledo) was named the Prospect League's reliever of the year, while outfielder Cody Orr (Tiffin), catcher Cole Andrews (Miami Ohio), infielder Gavin Homer (Penn State), and pitchers Jack Raines (Baldwin Wallace), Zach Kendall (Rio Grande) and Austin Calopietro (Toledo) were also named All-Stars.\n\nSeveral players from the championship-winning 2019 team signed up to play for the Paints again in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic shortended and then canceled the 2020 Prospect League season. It was the first time since the summer of 1992 that the Paints didn't take the field at VA Memorial Stadium.\n\n2021 saw a return to play for the Prospect League and the Paints, and with a new field manager for the first time since 2016 as Chillicothe native and Zane Trace graduate John Penn took the reins from Brian Bigam. Penn led the Paints to a 36-24 record. Chillicothe tied a Prospect League record with a 13-game win streak. Despite being seven games ahead in the division on the whole season, Chillicothe made the playoffs (for the ninth time in 12 seasons) on the last day of the regular season due to the split-season format. The Paints fell to Champion City 10-9 in the Ohio River Valley Division Championship Game in Springfield. The Paints set new franchise records in both total and per-game average attendance with 62,599 and 2,236, respetively. Both would have been new Prospect League records if not for the Prospect League newcomers and former Minor League Baseball member Clinton LumberKings, who tallied 62,872 and 2,329. Pitcher Ruben Ramirez (Point Park) and outfielder Trey Smith (Indianapolis) were named Prospect League All-Stars.\n\nThe Paints had another outstanding season, both on the field and off in 2022, culminating with Chillicothe winning its third Prospect League championship. Field manager Jackson White, in his first season at the helm, guided the Paints to a 38-22 record, winning both halves of the Ohio River Valley Division and clinching a playoff berth for the 10th time in 13 seasons. The Paints mercy-ruled the Johnstown Mill Rats in the division championship game, then erased a 4-0 deficit to beat the Pistol Shrimp in Peru, Ill., 7-4, capturing the Eastern Conference championship. In the Prospect League Championship Series, the Paints took game one over the River Dragons in Alton, Ill., 5-3. Returning to VA Memorial Stadium, the Paints dropped game two 2-0. In game three, the Paints found themselved down 4-0 at the stretch, but roared back, scoring six in the secenth inning and eight in the eighth inning for a walkoff, mercy-rule 14-4 win to capture the crown. The Paints' third title is tied for the most in Prospect League history (Quincy and West Virginia).\n\nThe Paints celebrated their 30th season in 2023 with another championship, a Prospect League record fourth title which was also the club's second straight and third in the last four seasons. Chillicothe put together its best record in terms of total wins by going 41-17. First-year field manager Michael Boswell also became the fourth different Paints manager to win a league title. The Paints won both the first and second halves of the Ohio River Valley Division, but it was the first half win that locked up home-field advantage in the one-game divisional playoff, which the Paints won 7-6 over Champion City. The Paints would go on to beat the Springfield Lucky Horseshoes by mercy rule, 12-0, to move into the Prospect League Championship Series for a league-record sixth time. By virtue of owning home-field advantage thanks to have the best overall record between the final two remaining teams, Chillicothe went on the road to Quincy, Ill., for game one, losing 18-12 in an absolute slugfest that featured four home runs, including a grand slam by eventual Prospect League MVP Tim Orr (Tiffin). Down 1-0 in the best-of-three series, the Paints returned home for game two, topping the Gems 12-0 in a mercy-rule shortended game. Victor Figueroa (Mississippi Valley State) and CJ Dean (Ohio Dominican) each homered for the Paints, while Nick Falter (Denison) turned in a complete-game shutout. In game three, Victor Figueroa homered again en route to becoming the PLCS MVP while Tim Orr and Cole Kwiatkowski (Findlay) also hit home runs and the Paints went on to win 12-8, securing the title. Following the season, play-by-play broadcaster Jacob Wise was named Prospect League Broadcaster of the Year in the inaugural year of the award."
