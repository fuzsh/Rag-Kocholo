He led his teams to two Regional Final appearances and in 2007, participated in the 3A Final Four State Tournament with the Gulliver Prep Raiders.\n\nPerez has been around baseball his entire life. As a player he was fortunate to be involved in both collegiate and professional baseball. Perez graduated from Rollins College in 1993 where he was a four-year letter winner. At Rollins, he participated in two regional tournaments, played on the only team in school history to be ranked #1 in the country, and was part of the squad that beat both the University of Miami and University of Florida in the same season. After college, Perez began his professional playing career by signing as a free agent with the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League. From there, he played another couple of seasons with two other professional organizations.\n\nPerez began his coaching career in 1996 as an assistant at Kean University (a nationally ranked Division III school in New Jersey). His main responsibilities included developing the catchers and hitters. In 1998, the program participated in their first regional appearance in 25 years. In 1999, Perez was hired as an Assistant Coach by Manny Mantrana at St. Thomas University. In the year 2000, St. Thomas compiled a 51-16 record, won the Florida Sun Conference Championship and participated in the NAIA College World Series.\n\nWhen Jorge Perez was hired in the Fall of 2008 as STU’s baseball coach, he expressed a clear vision for the future of the Bobcat Baseball Program. The goal was to assemble an excellent coaching staff, recruit quality student-athletes, and prepare the team to perform at their highest level. The baseball program prepares each season with its sights set on winning The Sun Conference Title and competing in the postseason at the NAIA College World Series.\n\nThrough hard work and determination, the STU baseball program has qualified for the NAIA Opening Round of the World Series in the 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022 seasons. In 2015 and 2019, Perez led the Bobcats to an even higher level as STU finished runner up at the NAIA World Series for the first time in school history.\n\nIn 2012 the baseball program had a breakout season. The team won 45 games and had a .763 winning percentage. That ranks as the fourth highest winning percentage in school history. The program also finished ranked 15th in the nation and won The Sun Conference Tournament for the first time in school history.\n\nUnder the guidance of Perez, the Bobcats defeated host Georgia Gwinnett in the 2015 NAIA Opening Round to qualify for the NAIA World Series for the fifth time in school history. At the NAIA World Series, the Bobcats staved off elimination four times in the ten-team double elimination tournament to earn a spot in the NAIA World Series Championship Game for the first time. The Bobcats fell to host Lewis-Clark State 10-7 in the championship and finished the year ranked No. 2 in the nation in the final NAIA Coaches Poll. Five Bobcats were named to the All-World Series team and outfielder Jerry Downs, the highest selected NAIA position player in the 2015 Major League Baseball Draft, was drafted in the 15th round by the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThe 2016 season featured STU's second consecutive appearance in the NAIA Opening Round, as St. Thomas traveled to play in the Kingsport (TN.) Bracket. St. Thomas defeated Middle Georgia State and eliminated Rio Grande, before advancing to the winner-take-all game against host, Tennessee Wesleyan University. The Bobcats dropped the contest and fell one game short of back-to-back trips to the NAIA World Series.\n\nIn 2017, St. Thomas University made an appearance in The Sun Conference Tournament for the ninth consecutive season. Along with making the conference postseason, the Bobcats were selected for the NAIA National Tournament Opening Round for the third consecutive season, the sixth time in program history. Perez earned his 300th career win as the head coach at St. Thomas when the team traveled to USCB for a three-game weekend series. The Bobcats lost the first game of the series but swept the double-header, which eclipsed Perez to his 301st win. Overall, his record at STU after the 2017 season closed out at 313-213 (.595 winning percentage).\n\nThe 2018 season was record-breaking for Perez and the Bobcats. STU established a new program-record for wins (56) and featured a dynamic offense which lead the NAIA in: doubles (197), at-bats (2266), hits (817), runs (652), runs-batted-in (586) and batting average (0.361). The St. Thomas team featured four NAIA All-Americans: Nelson Mompierre (Perfect Game NAIA MVP), Elih Marrero, Orlando Rodriguez and Jackie Urbaez.\n\n2019 featured more success from Perez and the Bobcats, resulting in the seventh NAIA World Series-trip in program history. During the regular season, St. Thomas swept the No. 1 Southeastern University Fire at home, following a 14-2 run-rule victory in game two of the Sun Conference series, Perez earned his 400th career win and became the second coach in STU history to reach the milestone. St. Thomas hosted the NAIA Opening Round, for the first time since 2007, going undefeated and advancing to the NAIA World Series for the seventh time in program history. STU defeated reigning World Series Champion, Southeastern in game one, University of Science and Arts (OK.), eliminated Georgia Gwinnett and USAO, only losing twice to Tennessee Wesleyan and advancing to the NAIA World Series for the second time in program history. Four members of the 2019 baseball team signed professional contracts: Jackie Urbaez (drafted by MIL in the 29th round), Ian Exposito (UDFA, Milwaukee Brewers), Orlando Rodriguez (UDFA, Cincinnati Reds), and Sergio Lopez (Independent).\n\nBefore the 2020 season was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Perez guided the Bobcats to a 19-5-1 record.\n\nSTU returned to the field in 2021 looking to once again compete on the national stage. Perez became the winningest coach in St. Thomas University Baseball history on Saturday, March 20, following a 5-3 victory over Florida National University. Perez earned his 452nd career win and passed STU Hall of Famer and former Head Coach, Manny Mantrana. St. Thomas advanced to the NAIA Opening Round for the sixth consecutive season, going 1-2 in the Montgomery Bracket. Six Bobcats earned All-Conference recognition in 2021, as Daniel Mondejar and Ernesto Pino were named to the First-Team, while Jack Khawly, Emanuel Montesino, Josue Rangel, and Alejandro Rivero earned Second-Team honors.\n\nYEAR-BY-YEAR\n\nYear Overall Win Pct.
