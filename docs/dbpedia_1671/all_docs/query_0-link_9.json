Fresno State went 2-2 in its first ever postseason MW tournament. The Bulldogs opened up against Nevada and fell into the losers' bracket after game one with a 4-3 loss in 12 innings.

The Bulldogs tournament luck would run out as they played San Diego State, dropping a 4-0 game in their third elimination game.\n\nThe Bulldog versus the Mountain West - 2014 Series Results\n\nvs. No.1 UNLV - Lost, 2-1.\n\nvs. No. 2 New Mexico - Lost, 6-0.\n\nvs. No. 4 Nevada - Won, 4-2.\n\nvs. No. 6 Air Force - Won, 5-1.\n\nvs. No. 7 San Jose State - Lost, 2-1.\n\nFresno State vs. Nevada - The Series\n\nThe Bulldogs and Wolf Pack have a long history together, playing a total of 148 games, with the Bulldogs owning the all-time edge 94-54. It is the fourth longest rivalry Fresno State has behind San Jose State, Cal Poly and Sacramento State. Fresno State and Nevada are the two newest members of the MW after both departing the WAC following the 2012 season. Since joining the MW, the Bulldogs own an 9-5 advantage in 14 games. And after just one MW tournament, the two programs have already played each other twice, with Nevada taking the tournament opener and the Bulldogs returning the favor two days later in the losers' bracket to end Nevada's season. Fresno State and Nevada last shared conference affiliation in the WAC from 2000-12.\n\nScouting Nevada\n\nThe Wolf Pack secured the No. 4 seed under first-year head coach Jay Johnson.

Adam Whitt is the team's saves leader, Whitt has seven saves on the year and a 5-5 record.\n\nA Look Back at the Nevada Series\n\nAfter opening the season with a solid series win on the road at UC Irvine, the 'Dogs first weekend series at home was also their conference-opener. Brink opened the series with an exclamation point on the mound. The junior allowed just four hits and allowed one run, coming up just two outs shy of a complete game, as Fresno State took game one 4-1. After playing to a 3-3 tie through six innings in game two, Fresno State received RBI-singles from Kevin Viers and Chris Mariscal in the seventh and eighth innings, respectively, to pull out a 5-3 win. Velazquez threw three shutout innings of relief to pick up the win. Sunday's series finale saw plenty of offensive fireworks. The teams combined for 18 runs on 27 hits and each team used six pitchers. A seven-run sixth inning proved to be the difference as the 'Dogs rallied from a 5-2 deficit. The inning featured five Fresno State hits and two Wolf Pack errors. After the teams put up identical two-spots on the board in the eighth, the 'Dogs held on 11-9 to sweep the MW series. The series in Reno featured even more offense. Fresno State set the tone in game one with a 20-10 win. Seven Bulldogs had multi-hit games and the offense posted innings with eight, six and five runs on the way to the highest scoring game of the season. In game two, Fresno State rallied for two runs in the ninth to force extra innings, but couldn't muster anything in extra innings before a Nevada rally in the 12th brought home the winning run in a 9-8 loss. The 'Dogs seemed to have the series win all but locked up in the finale, but the Wolf Pack scored eight runs over the final three innings to rally from an 8-1 deficit and win 9-8 and take the series.\n\nBulldogs Built for Postseason\n\nSince 2008, the year the Bulldogs won the national championship, Fresno State has posted a 18-5 record in postseason elimination games. The Bulldogs have gone 11-2 in conference tournament elimination games, including a 3-0 record in 2012 to reach the NCAA Stanford Regional, and a 6-2 mark in NCAA Tournament elimination games. In the NCAA Tournament alone, Fresno State is 1-1 at the regionals in elimination games, 2-0 in the super regionals and 3-0 at the College World Series. During its run to the 2008 National Championship, Fresno State defeated San Diego 5-1 in the Long Beach Regional and then defeated No. 3 Arizona State twice in back-to-back elimination games to advance to the College World Series. In the CWS, Fresno State defeated North Carolina to reach the CWS finals and then after losing the opening game, defeated Georgia twice to win the programs first national championship.\n\nBrink Returns to MW Tourney\n\nJordan Brink, the Bulldogs' Mountain West Championship game one starter, is one of 12 players that return to the Mountain West tournament from last year's squad. Although, the junior right-hander will be making his first tournament start on the mound. In 2013 Brink started all four games, but it was as the designated hitter. He went 5-for-16 (.313) with two runs scored and one RBI. Brink made one appearance on the mound as a reliever for 4.1 innings in the game one loss to Nevada. He surrendered one run on four hits while striking out six.\n\nTwo 2013 MW Tournament Pitchers Return for 2014\n\nFresno State will have two starting pitchers from the 2013 tournament available this week - Tim Borst and Blake Quinn.

He allowed three earned run on 11 hits, while striking out four and walking two. Quinn exited after 3.0 innings in the game one loss to Nevada, allowing three runs off five hits.

He finished the regular season with a .385 batting average, best in the Mountain West conference, 79 hits, 21 doubles, nine home runs, 46 RBIs, 129 total bases, .629 slugging percentage and .478 on-base percentage - all team bests. He also has a team-low 21 strikeouts with a minimum 100 at bats.\n\nWhat Got Into Manny Argomaniz\n\n17 games since Fresno State put 20 runs on the scoreboard at Nevada, Manny Argomaniz' offensive stroke has not lost steam. Over the past 17 games, since April 17, Argomaniz is hitting .343 (23-for-67) with 14 RBIs, six home runs, three doubles, 12 runs scored and has a .657 slugging percentage and an .387 on-base percentage.

For his ninth home run of the season on May 13 vs. Bakersfield, Luplow hit an inside-the-park home run. Luplow roped a ball in the seventh inning that fell a couple feet shy of going over the fence in left-center field, Luplow was about to round second base by the time the ball hit the wall and he made it around to touch all four bases standing up. The last Bulldog to hit an inside-the-park home was Trent Soares on April 5, 2009 - also vs. Bakersfield. Coincidently just a few days prior Gavin Hedstrom hit an inside-the-park homer on March 20, 2009 vs. Loyola Marymount.\n\nRun Production\n\nThe Bulldogs are 19-12 when they are first to score, and 8-15 when having to come from behind. When the 'Dogs have scored six or more runs this season they are 18-5.\n\nExtra Inning and One-Run Games\n\nIn extra-inning games the Bulldogs are up to six following the April 23 16-inning game at home against Cal State Fullerton.

Tanner Scheppers got the opening day start for the Texas Rangers. Matt Garza is with the Milwaukee Brewers. Casey McGehee is in his first season with the Miami Marlins. Justin Wilson returns to the bullpen as a member of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Doug Fister opens the season on the disabled list for the Washington Nationals.\n\nTD Ameritrade Park Swallows Luplow's Hitting Streak at 18 - Held up for Best in the MW\n\nJordan Luplow's 18-game hitting streak was snapped when the Bulldogs open their series vs. Creighton at TD Ameritrade Park. It spanned from Feb. 19 to March 21 The 18-game hitting streak was the longest of Luplow's career, besting the previous mark of 11 he set as a freshman in 2012. It held up through the remainder of the 2014 season as the best in the Mountain West.

He scored 15 runs and had 17 RBIs and four home runs in that 18-game span too. He also owned a 10-game streak this season, after the 18-game run.\n\nEven Steven\n\nFresno State ended the season with a 27-27 overall record. Couple that with a 12-12 mark in day games, 15-15 in night games and a 7-7 record vs. left-handed pitcher and 20-20 mark vs. right-handed pitchers, it reveals the 'Dogs are trending.\n\nBulldog Bats Erupt in Reno\n\nThe Bulldog offense found its way in game one of its three-game series at Reno, April 17-19. Fresno State erupted for 20 runs in that game to beat the Pack 20-10. The 20 runs held up through the regular season as the most runs produced in a single game this season by a Mountain West team. Despite losing games two and three, both 9-8, the Bulldogs manufactured 36 runs over three games, a season-high. Since that series, eight Bulldogs are hitting better than .300 (min. 10 AB) while Luplow leads the team at .456.\n\nWacky Weather\n\nMother nature produced a wild season for the Bulldogs, the 'Dogs had six games postponed or canceled due to rain, snow and freezing temps.
