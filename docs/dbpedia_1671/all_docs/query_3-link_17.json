        "text": "ST. LOUIS – For the 28th time in league history, and the sixth time in the last seven seasons, the Missouri Valley Conference will send multiple teams to the NCAA Baseball Tournament.\n\nThe 2024 MVC Baseball Championship tournament champion Evansville Purple Aces (35-23) are headed to the Greenville Regional and will face host No. 16-seed East Carolina (43-15) on Friday at 12 p.m. CT on ESPN+. VCU (37-21) and Wake Forest (38-20) are also included in the Greenville Regional.\n\nThe Purple Aces are making their first NCAA Tournament appearance since 2006 after earning their second conference tournament title in program history. Evansville is making its fourth NCAA Division I Tournament appearance in 2024 and first under the direction of head coach Wes Carroll. He was also a member of the 2000 NCAA Tournament team at Evansville as a player.\n\nThe Sycamores (42-13) are headed to the postseason for the second-consecutive year and fourth time in five seasons after picking up an at-large bid. Indiana State is set to face Illinois (34-19) on Friday at 6 p.m. CT in the Lexington Regional, hosted by No. 2-seed Kentucky (40-14). The contest between Indiana State and Illinois can be streamed on ESPN+. Western Michigan (32-21) rounds out the four-team regional site.\n\nIndiana State won the 2024 MVC regular season championship with a 22-5 mark during league play. The Sycamores have made 13 trips to the postseason and are 14-24 all-time in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nRegionals are a four-team, double-elimination format, and are on campus sites, May 31 to June 3. Super Regionals are either June 7-9 or June 8-10, and winners of each Super Regional round will advance to the Men’s College World Series in Omaha. The MVC has made seven appearances in the NCAA Super Regionals since the format was adopted in 1999, last by Indiana State in 2023."
