        "text": "DENVER (KDVR) — The 2024 NCAA Tournament will begin March Madness on Tuesday, but on Wednesday in Dayton, Ohio, the University of Colorado Buffaloes take on the Boise State Broncos as part of the First Four.\n\nThe First Four also marks the Buffs’ return to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2021, which means the team has few players with experience on that stage. If the Buffaloes win this first game, they’ll head to Indianapolis to play the Florida Gators on Friday, March 22.\n\nHow to watch Boise State vs. Colorado on TV\n\nGet ready for some prime-time basketball for the Mountain time zone.\n\nBoise State vs. CU jump ball: 7:10 p.m., March 20\n\nChannel: TruTV\n\nGame insights for Boise State vs. Colorado\n\nSix Mountain West teams made the tournament, but the NCAA selection committee did the conference little favor in the seedings.\n\nColorado has an NBA prospect. But he likely won’t get drafted among 1st few picks\n\nAside from San Diego State, which was fifth, Mountain West teams were put in tough spots. Boise State and Colorado State will compete in the First Four. New Mexico would not have made the field if it hadn’t won the conference tournament.\n\nColorado was the runner-up in the Pac-12 Tournament and will play Boise State (22-10) from the Mountain West Conference in the late game Wednesday, with the winner moving on as the 10th seed in the South Region to face seventh-seeded Florida.\n\n“You can’t argue the committee hated the Mountain West this year,” Magee said. “But the seeding with some of them, it was almost like, ‘Hey, go prove it.’ Utah State winning the Mountain West regular season and getting an eight seed, nuts. New Mexico getting an 11 seed, being on the same line as Duquesne, is a whole story altogether.”\n\nTickets for Boise State vs. Colorado\n\nIf you’re in Dayton, Ohio, tickets to view the First Four compete will be available on StubHub, with prices starting at about $25 each. But if you’re looking to spend some cash, a few courtside tickets were going for almost $2,000 apiece. Other courtside or near-courtside listings show prices between $100-$200.\n\nFOX31 Newsletters: Sign up to get Broncos, Nuggets, Rockies and more sports news\n\nThe First Four is essentially the kick-off for the NCAA Tournament, so get in while the action is still just starting.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
