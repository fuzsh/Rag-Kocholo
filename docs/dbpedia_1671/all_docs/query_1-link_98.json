        "text": "SPORTS FEEVER by Chris Fee of KROX Radio – chrisjfee@yahoo.com\n\nMinnesota’s own Joe Mauer became a first-ballot hall of famer and will be the youngest baseball player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, this year.\n\nI have been fortunate to meet Joe Mauer a couple of times. Once, he gave us an autograph on a baseball, and I thanked him. He responded with, no, thank you! He isn’t only one of the best athletes to ever come out of Minnesota (he could have been a pro quarterback, and he was an all-state basketball player), along with the likes of Bud Grant (played in the NBA and NFL), Dave Winfield (drafted by the San Diego Padres fourth overall, drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in the NBA in the fifth round, the Utah Stars of the ABA in the fourth round, and the Minnesota Vikings in the 17th round and didn’t even play football in college).\n\nObviously, Joe is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and is a true Minnesotan. He is a legend athletically, but even more so he is a legend on how to act and how to treat people, as evidence by the video below.\n\n— — —\n\nSECTION 8A BOYS BASKETBALL –\n\nIn the past, Section 8A Boys Basketball has had a hard time getting a decent seed, if they even got one at all at the state tournament, unless it was Cass Lake-Bena. Part of the problem is the schedules teams played, but this year, Section 8A is making a name for itself with Fertile-Beltrami beating Nevis and Ada-Borup-West, who were both ranked. They play Cherry at the end of February and games like that help gain extra points at state seeding time. Especially went he coaches seed at state. Cass Lake-Bena knocking off #7 Mountain Iron-Buhl was a nice win too. That will help this year, and having Fertile-Beltrami ranked #3, and Red Lake County ranked #5 doesn’t hurt a chance for a good seed this year either! If you know you are going to have a good team, getting big games on your schedule against teams outside the area is extremely important so hats off to Fertile-Beltrami on adding #1 ranked Cherry to its schedule.\n\nThe QRF, which is what Section 8A is seeded, looks like this as of Wednesday evening.\n\nWEST SUBSECTION\n\n1. Red Lake County 14-0 (82.8)\n\n2. Fertile-Beltrami 13-1 (76.3)\n\n3. Goodridge/Grygla 12-3 (65.4)\n\n4. Sacred Heart 11-5 (56.8)\n\n5. Northern Freeze 10-6 (54.8)\n\n6. Kittson County Central 7-7 (49.9)\n\n7. Warren-Alvarado-Oslo 7-9 (41.3)\n\n8. Stephen-Argyle 4-10 (28.1)\n\n9. BGMR 1-13 (19.0)\n\n10. Climax-Fisher 1-15 (17.9)\n\nI don’t argue with much in the QRF rankings, but right now, I think Fertile-Beltrami is the top team. They are playing well and have some size, with 6’5 sophomore post Preston Hanson getting better every game and is an outstanding player that can do it all. Of course, they have Caiden Swenby, Derek Sorenson, Mason Nowacki, and Caleb Stoltman, who have been outstanding all year long. Swenby is one of the top all-around guards in the section and the thing that separates him from others is his size at 6’3 or 6’4. Off the bench, they have Bryer Strem, who is a solid defender and fantastic guard and would start on most teams around the area. Easton Petry comes off the bench and is a nice mix of physical and finesse, and Cody Opdahl comes in and gives them some more height at 6’4.\n\nRed Lake County, right now, is a very close second (one could say a tie for first and nobody would really argue). The Rebels are another outstanding team. They have two of the top guards in the section, with Connor Duden (a sophomore), who can shoot the three and can also drive for layups and hit jump shots in between. He is an offensive force. Owen Chervestad makes hay by driving better than anybody. Gunnar Halverson, Will Gieseke, and John Powers (the only senior that plays regularly) are great pieces to the Rebel puzzle and add something different and that makes them such valuable players. Off the bench, you have Ethan Majeres, who can flat-out shoot, Ben Gullingsrud, who can also flat-out shoot, and Ethan Johnson, who does a little bit of everything.\n\nNot far behind in the third spot is Goodridge/Grgyla. Speaking of outstanding players, the Chargers have some special players. Lewis Jones broke the Charger basketball scoring record earlier this year and is one of the top guards in the section. He can shoot, drive, and dish. He is quick and athletic and is a superb guard. Blake Rychlock is another top player in the section and he can score. Those two lead the way and make a tough match-up for a lot of teams. They also are solid defensively.\n\nSacred Heart is the two-time defending Section 8A champion. They have another outstanding point guard, Josiah Sundby, who can drive, shoot, and facilitate the offense well. Parker Erickson is a 6’4 junior who can shoot the three, post-up, and drive. Mike Gapp is a great all-around player. Greg Downs gives them more size at 6’5 in the post area, and off the bench, you have Isaac Sundby, who is just like his older brother.\n\nNorthern Freeze, Kittson County Central, and Warren-Alvarado-Oslo are VERY GOOD teams that can beat the top four teams! This is one of the deepest and best West Sub-sections I have seen since Minnesota has gone to four classes.\n\n— — —\n\nSECTION 8A BOYS HOCKEY\n\nSection 8A Boys Hockey is seeded by the coaches. So we will look at that but also include QRF rankings for fun.\n\nHere is how I see the Section right now, as of Wednesday evening.\n\n1. Warroad 15-3 (4-0)\n\n2. East Grand Forks 12-6-1 (3-1)\n\n3. Thief River Falls 10-6-1 (5-2)\n\n4. Detroit Lakes 9-8-1 (2-5)\n\n5. Park Rapids 10-3-3 (4-2)\n\n6. Crookston 9-7 (6-5)\n\n7. Red Lake Falls 12-3 (7-2)\n\n8. Lake of the Woods 11-6 (3-5)\n\n9. Bagley/Fosston 5-12 (1-7)\n\n10. Kittson County Central 2-18 (1-7)\n\nThe top three are no-brainers right now. Warroad is ranked #1 in the state and has an outstanding team. East Grand Forks is easily the second-best team when they meet Warroad a second time this season, the game will likely be for the top seed in the tournament.\n\nThief River Falls is the third seed as of today.\n\nThe rest of the way gets interesting. And this is why I put each team in their spots.\n\nDetroit Lakes is in the fourth spot because they have beat Crookston, and Park Rapids. But, they have lost to Red Lake Falls, EGF twice, TRF, and Warroad. They play a tough schedule, but they only have one section game left when they play Park Rapids. If they lose to Park Rapids that is going to make things super interesting at section seeding time.\n\nPark Rapids comes in fifth because they beat Red Lake Falls and Crookston, but have a loss to Lake of the Woods. They play Crookston, Red Lake Falls, Lake of the Woods, Detroit Lakes and those four games will make or break their seed. They also play KCC and Bagley-Fosston.\n\nCrookston is in the sixth spot because they beat Red Lake Falls and Lake of the Woods. They lost to Detroit Lakes and Park Rapids. The Pirates have games with EGF, Park Rapids, Lake of the Woods, and Red Lake Falls. If Crookston beats PR, LOW, and RLF, they would have to be the fifth seed.\n\nRed Lake Falls comes in at the seventh spot because they lost to Crookston and Park Rapids. But they beat Detroit Lakes 4-2 and have beaten LOW twice. Red Lake Falls has games with Thief River Falls and two huge games for seeding purposes with Park Rapids and Crookston. If Red Lake Falls beats Crookston and Park Rapids, I would say they would be the fifth seed, hands down.\n\nLake of the Woods is eight right now because they lost to RLF twice, KCC, and Crookston. They have beaten Park Rapids and have important games with Park Rapids, KCC, and Crookston left in section play. So, three wins in those games would move them up.\n\nRounding things out, the ninth team is Bagley/Fosston because they have a 7-3 win over KCC. The game for the ninth seed will be played on February 13 when Bagley/Fosston takes on KCC.\n\nIf Section 8A Boys hockey seeding went by the QRF, things would look a lot different. But like I have said many times, coach seeding is the best, and the games that matter most are section games. So here are the QRF rankings as of Wednesday night.\n\n1. Warroad (100.6 – #1 in Class A)\n\n2. East Grand Forks (85.7 – #5 in Class A)\n\n3. Thief River Falls (65.8)\n\n4. Red Lake Falls (61.6)\n\n5. Lake of the Woods (53.2)\n\n6. Detroit Lakes (51.9)\n\n7. Park Rapids (51.3)\n\n8. Crookston (51.0)\n\n9. Bagley/Fosston (35.7)\n\n10. Kittson County Central (25.7)\n\n— — —\n\nSECTION 8A Wrestling is going to be an interesting seeding meeting. It is wide-open right now.\n\nThis is how I see the standings as of Wednesday.\n\n1.United North Central\n\n2. Frazee\n\n3. Fosston/Bagley\n\n4. Fertile-Beltrami\n\n5. Barnesville\n\n6. Mahnomen/Waubun\n\n7. Badger/Greenbush-Middle River\n\n8. Crookston\n\nThere haven’t been a lot of section duals so far.\n\nThe top team is United North Central right now because of their 40-30 victory over Frazee. They have also beaten Thief River Falls, West Central Area, Tracy-Milroy, and Brainerd. They have losses to Long Prairie-Grey Eagle 30-28, Holdingford, and Staples-Motley. They also finished over double the points of Fertile-Beltrami in the TRF tournament.\n\nFrazee is Frazee.\n\nFosston/Bagley is a “third” seed right now, but that all could change in the next three section duals. They wrestle UNC on Thursday, Barnesville on January 30, and Frazee on February 1. Obviously, if they win all three, they would be the top seed!!!\n\nFertile-Beltrami is in the fourth spot because they were beaten in a dual by Fosston/Bagley.\n\nBarnesville is fifth right now because they have one section dual, and that was a close win over Mahnomen/Waubun.\n\nBGMR is in seventh and lost a good battle with Fosston/Bagley.\n\nCrookston comes in at eighth. They are struggling to get a full line-up and with that they will struggle to get a win in a dual unless they can fill all 13 weights.\n\n— — —\n\nI still have some Gopher Women’s and Men’s Basketball tickets available.

UMC has been picked to finish fourth place this year in the NSIC preseason coaches poll, and Jake Hjelle (Sr. East Grand Forks) has been tabbed as the preseason player of the year. UMC Head Coach Steve Gust became the first Golden Eagle Coach to win 200 games in Crookston.\n\nHjelle earns the preseason honor after being named the NSIC Player of the Year in 2023, joining his brother Reed Hjelle as Golden Eagles to receive the distinguished accolade. Hjelle was also the D2CCA and NCBWA Region Player of the Year, and the NCBWA National Player of the Year. Josh Dykhoff (So., P/1B, Wadena) returns after earning NSIC Freshman of the Year and NCBWA All-Region honors in his first season with the Golden Eagles. Brody Sorenson (Sr., Grand Forks, N.D.) returns after being named to the All-NSIC Second Team in 2023 as a reliever. Jake Osowski (Sr., RHP, East Grand Forks) is the Pitcher to Watch for the Golden Eagles after going unheralded for Minnesota Crookston after posting a 16-2 mark and a 3.46 ERA in the last three seasons. Osowski has 158 career strikeouts to just 48 walks.\n\nThe Golden Eagles return seven starters at the plate from the 2023 squad, including Hjelle and Dykhoff. In addition, Caden Headlee (Jr., OF, Fargo, N.D.) returns after hitting .348 last season, with 37 runs scored and 38 RBIs. Ben Goelz (Sr., OF, Maple Lake, Minn.) returns after batting .303 last season, while Sawyer Satrom (Soph., IF, Portland, N.D.) hit .301 as a redshirt freshman. Danny Wensloff (Sr., OF, Roseau, Minn.) and Mitch Goodwin (Sr., SS, Prior Lake, Minn.) also return from last season’s starting line-up. Kobe Senn (So., IF, Fargo, N.D.) and Teddy Giefer (Sr., 1B, Courtland, Minn.) were also key contributors for the Golden Eagles last season.\n\nOn the mound, Osowski, Dykhoff, and Sorenson pace Minnesota Crookston. The Golden Eagles have several pitchers who saw action last season and will look to have increased roles in 2024. Osowski is the leading returnee with 73 innings pitched last season. Sorenson paced Minnesota Crookston with 19 appearances, mostly out of the bullpen. He did make two starts. Josh Dykhoff started seven games as a freshman for the Golden Eagles.\n\nThe Golden Eagles finished third in the conference standings last season and made it to the NSIC Tournament, where they lost in the consolation semifinals to Augustana University. The Vikings were picked to finish first in the NSIC, with Minnesota State University slotted behind them. Caleb Saari of Augustana was named the NSIC Preseason Pitcher of the Year.\n\nUMC opens the season on February 9 on the road at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs.\n\n— — —\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Crookston Golden Eagle baseball players Jake Hjelle (Sr., OF/1B, East Grand Forks), and Josh Dykhoff (So., RHP/1B, Wadena) were named to the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) Preseason All-Central Region Team.\n\nHjelle is the reigning NCBWA National Player of the Year and the reigning NCBWA Central Region Player of the Year. Dykhoff was an NCBWA All-Central Region Second Team selection as a freshman.\n\nHjelle had an amazing junior season for the Golden Eagles, joining his brother Reed Hjelle as Golden Eagles to earn NSIC Player of the Year. He added on honors for All-Region and All-America, also joining his brother in those accomplishments. Hjelle hit .401 last season, with a 1.345 OPS, and a .876 slugging percentage. Hjelle scored 56 runs, with 16 doubles, four triples, 24 home runs, and a team-high 79 RBIs.\n\nDykhoff had a great debut season in the maroon and gold. He hit .335, with 57 runs scored, 15 doubles, 15 home runs, and 53 RBIs. On the mound, Dykhoff went 3-2 with a 6.50 ERA in 36 innings of work. He appeared in 11 games, starting seven.
