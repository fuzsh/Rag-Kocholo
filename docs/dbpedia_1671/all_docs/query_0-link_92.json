        "text": "Stan Stolte was named the seventh head coach in UNLV baseball history on June 1, 2016, six months after he had been tabbed as the interim head coach in December 2015. He was also named 2022 Mountain West Coach of the Year after leading the Hustlin' Rebels to 2022 MW Regular-Season Champions.\n\nThe 2024 campaign marks Stolte's 14th with the Scarlet & Gray after he joined the program as an associate head coach in the summer of 2010. Stolte's Rebels were crowned the 2022 Mountain West Regular-Season Champions after an impressive 21-9 record in conference play. The 2022 squad started off conference play as only the second team in program history to hit the 7-0 mark in conference play, the previous being 1988's squad.\n\nSince joining the collegiate coaching ranks in 1987 at Northwest Missouri State, Stolte has coached 116 players that have signed professional contracts, including 18 that made their way to the Major Leagues. Erick Fedde, who was selected 18th overall pick by the Washington Nationals in the 2014 MLB Draft, became the most recent Stolte protege to reach the professional ranks after he made his big-league debut on July 30 in game one of a doubleheader against the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIn the past six years, the Rebels have had a total of 16 players drafted; seven pitchers and nine position players. The 2016 draft class was all pitchers - Dean Kremer, D.J. Myers, Kenny Oakley and Ben Wright - while three position players - Ernie De La Trinidad, Justin Jones and Payton Squier - were chosen in '17. Six players were selected in '18: three pitchers - Trevor Horn, Bryan Menendez and Alan Strong - and three players - Nick Ames, Kyle Isbel and Nick Rodriguez. The 2023 draft featured the Rebel catcher Jacob Sharp being taken by the Seattle Mariners in the the 17th round.\n\nBryson Stott was taken 14th overall by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2019 MLB Draft, while Max Smith was chosen by the Minnesota Twins in the 31st round.\n\nAdditionally, Stolte has developed 21 All-Americans and five conference pitchers of the year, including Rebel alums Fedde (2014), Buddy Borden (2013) and Tanner Peters (2011), and mentored Stott to Mountain West Tony Gwynn Co-Player of the Year honors.\n\nDating back to the 2016 campaign, Isbel (2016), Stott (2017) and Edarian Williams (2019) garnered MW Co-Freshman of the Year recognition.\n\nBreaking it down even further, Stolte has mentored 37 pitchers to all-conference team recognition, with nine of the past 11 before the 2024 Draft - all at UNLV - were drafted by MLB squads.\n\nStolte led the Rebels to their second straight runner-up finish at the MW Baseball Championship, following a third-place showing in conference play. The squad concluded the year with 29 wins.\n\nThe 2019 team concluded the campaign in the top 100 of nine different statistical categories. The Rebels were ranked as high as third in double plays (65), while coming in No. 33 in hits (598) and No. 40 in batting average (.291).\n\nIndividually, Stott was the catalyst of the offense, ranking in the top 100 of 11 categories. The Las Vegas native was listed as high as 17th in walks (55), and also 28th in on-base percentage (.486), 44th in doubles (20) and 88th in batting average (.356). Williams was 70th in hits (80).\n\nStott's season included national recognition, being a Golden Spikes Award semifinalist and Brooks Wallace Award finalist. Besides the MW Co-Player of the Year honors, he was a MW First Team selection, a MW Tournament Team member and was chosen by four different organizations' All-America Teams.\n\nStolte guided the Rebels to a 35-win season in 2018 and a runner-up finish at the MW Baseball Championship. UNLV began the year with a memorable run with an 11-1 mark through 12 games and a 20-3 showing through 24.\n\nThe Rebels received votes during 10 weeks of the 2018 season and were ranked in various polls in the top 25 from March 5 to April 2. The squad climbed as high as No. 19 (March 19) in the Collegiate Baseball poll.\n\nAs a team, the Rebels were ranked in the top 50 of 13 different statistical categories, such as: second in doubles per game (2.39), sixth in batting average (.310) and seventh in doubles (141), hits (662) and slugging percentage (.487).\n\nThe Rebels' offense success was paced by the Isbel and Stott's output. The former ranked No. 11 and No. 41 in the NCAA in total bases and slugging percentage, respectively, and was in the top 100 of 10 other categories, while the latter led the nation in doubles and was second in doubles per game. Stott was also in the top 100 of seven other stat marks.\n\nThe aforementioned duo garnered postseason recognition, too, as Isbel was named to D1Baseball's All-America Third Team and a Perfect Game/Rawlings Honorable Mention performer, while Stott was chosen to Collegiate Baseball's and Perfect Game's Third Team.\n\nIn his first season at the helm, Stolte won 24 games with eight of those against five squads that earned berths in the 2016 NCAA Tournament. The year began with a 4-3, road victory in 12 innings over No. 23 Texas. The Rebels later knocked off No. 22 Texas Tech, 8-5, before the Red Raiders were tabbed with the NCAA's No. 5 national seed.\n\nFour of his student-athletes earned 2016 All-MW honors, with Myers and Squier being named to the conference's first team, while Wright and Isbel were on the second team. Moreover, Isbel was the MW's Co-Freshman of the Year and a Louisville Slugger Freshman All-American.\n\nIn 2017, his Rebels won 20 games, which included a 6-1 triumph over No. 7 Cal State Fullerton - one of four teams UNLV faced that advanced to 2017 postseason play (San Diego State, Texas Tech and Iowa).\n\nBoth De La Trinidad and Justin Jones were 2017 All-MW Second Teamers, while Stott was the program's second straight MW Co-Freshman of the Year and freshman All-American (Collegiate Baseball).\n\nIn 2014, he helped Fedde, a junior at the time, become one of the best pitchers in the country. Fedde was named a Second Team All-American and was on the Midseason Golden Spikes Award watch list before his season came to a premature end after an injury. Despite his injury, Fedde became the third player in UNLV history to become a first-round draft pick as he was drafted 18th overall in the 2014 First Year Player Draft by the Washington Nationals. He was also named the 2014 MW Pitcher of the Year after posting a 8-2 record with a 1.76 ERA.\n\nStolte also saw John Richy turn in phenomenal junior campaign in 2014. He was selected 98th overall by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the third-round of the MLB First Year Player Draft. Fedde and Richy became the first two Rebels in school history to be selected in the first 100 picks of a MLB Draft.\n\nRichy finished the season with an 11-4 record and a 3.20 ERA and was named First Team All-Mountain West and to the All-Mountain West Tournament team. He led the MW with 113 strikeouts in 121.0 innings of work.\n\nAs a pitching staff in 2014, the Rebels had the lowest ERA in the Mountain West at 3.18. The staff also led the conference by holding opposing batters to a .251 average, 431 strikeouts and 248 runs allowed. Richy, Fedde and Oakley all ranked in the top-five in the conference in strikeouts and Fedde and Bryan Bonnell were in the top-five in ERA.\n\nIn 2013, he helped junior Buddy Borden develop in to one of the best pitchers in the Mountain West. Borden, a seventh-round draft pick in the 2013 MLB First Year Player Draft by the Pittsburgh Pirates, was named the 2013 MW Co-Pitcher of the Year after he went 8-2 with a 2.59 ERA\n\nBorden's ERA was the lowest in the conference, his eight wins was tied for second most and he finished with 77 strikeouts, which ranked seventh in the MW. He held batters to a .233 average in 100.2 innings of work, which were both good for fourth in the conference, respectively.\n\nAs a pitching staff in 2013, the Rebels had the second lowest ERA at 4.34 in the MW, which caters to the batters since the ballparks in the MW sit at a higher elevation.The team also held batters to a .271 average, recorded 409 strikeouts and allowed only 169 walks, all of which ranked second in the MW, respectively.\n\nIn 2012, Fedde was chosen a Freshman All-American after he finished the season with a 6-5 record to go with a 3.59 ERA. Fedde finished fifth in the Mountain West in strikeouts with 66 and was sixth in ERA. He held batters to a .261 average, which was good enough for seventh best in the conference. He pitched 90.1 innings on the year, which was the fifth most innings of work in the MW.\n\nIn 2011, Stolte helped mold a pair of All-Americans in Tanner Peters and Zack Hartman. Peters, a 16th-round selection in the 2011 MLB Amateur Draft by the Oakland A's, was named the 2011 Mountain West Pitcher of the Year after a spectacular junior season in which he posted a 9-4 record and 1.50 ERA.\n\nPeters threw eight complete games in 2011, ranking second in the nation behind UCLA's Trevor Bauer (9). He broke the Mountain West record for complete games in both a single season and career and is tied for complete-game shutouts in a career with former 2009 No. 1 overall MLB selection Stephen Strasburg. The Rebel ace was named a Louisville Slugger Third Team All-American following his final season in Rebel Red.\n\nHartman registered eight saves in his freshman campaign and notched a 5-2 record in 22 appearances on the hill for the Rebels. His 2.35 ERA was second lowest on the team while his 29 strikeouts in just 38.1 innings of work ranked fourth on the team.\n\nAlso in 2011, he guided the program to the No. 32 ranked recruiting class in the country by Collegiate Baseball.\n\nStolte is no stranger to baseball in the Silver State, having served on the coaching staff at in-state rival Nevada, Reno for 14 seasons, including spending his last four as the associate head coach of the Wolf Pack program. Stolte also served as the pitching coach and recruiting coordinator during his time in Reno, helping UNR to NCAA tournament appearances in 1997, 1999 and 2000.\n\nAt UNR, Stolte developed 22 all-conference pitchers, three freshman All-Americans and two WAC Pitcher of the Year winners, including 2010 honoree Brock Stassi, who led the league with a 3.43 ERA while compiling a 7-4 overall record. Stolte has coached 35 pitchers and 14 position players that have made it to the professional ranks, including Dan Reichert, who was a 1997 first round selection of the Kansas City Royals. He also mentored Chad Qualls and Darrell Rasner, who were taken in the second round of the MLB draft in 2000 and 2002 respectively. Qualls was a key bullpen member of the Houston Astros when they advanced to the 2005 World Series, and he is currently with the Houston Astros.\n\nPrior to his time at UNR, he spent seven years as an assistant coach at the University of the Pacific. Stolte coached at Northwest Missouri State for two years before heading west to Pacific. His coaching career began in the high school ranks as head coach at Clarence-Lowden High School in Iowa, where he was 110-45. He won four district titles and made one Iowa high school final four appearance in six years as a prep mentor. He then coached at Northwest Missouri State prior to returning to his alma mater, Muscatine (Iowa) Community College to coach the 1989-90 season.\n\nAn infielder and pitcher at Muscatine and St. Ambrose (Iowa) College, Stolte helped St. Ambrose win an NAIA regional baseball championship in 1984. He was a two-sport athlete at Muscatine playing baseball and basketball. He earned his bachelor's degree in physical education from St. Ambrose University in 1984 and his master's degree in education from Northwest Missouri State in 1989.\n\nStolte was born and raised in Lowden, Iowa. He and his wife, Susan have a son, Jacoby."
