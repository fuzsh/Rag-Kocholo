The team will be staying at the Holiday Inn-Downtown Sioux City (712-277-9400). For fans heading to the National Championships, All-Tournament passes are available for $35.00 at the Tyson Events Center/Gateway Arena, with single-day tickets available for $10.00.\n\nLADY YOTES HEADED BACK TO IOWA: For the fifth-straight season, The C of I has earned a berth to the NAIA National Championships, presented by CNOS Foundation, in Sioux City, Iowa. The Lady Yotes are one of 12 teams who earned a berth to the Final Site on the Missouri River through the Opening Round process, joined by 12 other teams who were seeded through to the Final Site based on the final Top-25 poll. The C of I was grouped in Pool B – playing a trio of afternoon matches Tuesday-Thursday to determine the 12 teams which will comprise Bracket Play for the National Championship.\n\nHISTORY AT NATIONALS: It marks the eighth time in program history that the Lady Yotes have earned a berth to the National Championships. In 2000, the Lady Yotes earned an at-large berth to Nationals in West Palm Beach, Fla., going 1-3 in Pool Play, while in 2005, the squad traveled to San Diego, Calif., going 2-2 in Pool Play. The 2006 season saw the Lady Yotes go 2-1 in Pool Play in Columbia, Mo., losing a quarterfinal play-in match against host Columbia. In 2008, the Yotes defeated Menlo (Calif.) in the Opening Round, going 0-3 in Pool Play in Sioux City, Iowa, while in 2009, The C of I was seeded through to Sioux City, going 2-1 in Pool Play, losing a four-set quarterfinal play-in against Texas at Brownsville. In 2010, the Yotes swept St. Thomas (Texas) in an Opening Round match, going 2-1 in Pool Play, losing in three sets to Cal Baptist in a quarterfinal play-in match. Last season, the Yotes defeated Carroll (Mont.) in three sets in an Opening Round match, going 2-1 in Pool Play, before defeating Rocky Mountain (Mont.) in five sets in a quarterfinal play-in match, before losing to Columbia (Mo.) in four sets in the national quarterfinals. With their Opening Round win over Menlo, the Yotes have a record of 16-16 in tournament play.\n\nLADY YOTES UNSEEDED: For the fifth time in their eight trips to Nationals, the Yotes will not be one of the 12 seeded teams in the tournament. In 2006, the Lady Yotes were seeded No. 7, in 2009, the squad was seeded No. 8, while last season, the Yotes were seeded No. 12.\n\nOPENING ROUND RECAP: Of the 12 matches played on Saturday, 10 of the host teams picked up victories – with St. Francis (Ill.) defeating Doane (Neb.) and Cal State San Marcos winning at Vanguard (Calif.). Four teams – Georgetown (Ky.), Madonna (Mich.), CSU-San Marcos, and Bellevue (Neb.) all won in four sets, while St. Francis and Missouri Baptist winning in five sets.\n\nSURVEYING THE POOLS: The six pools (designated A through F) were determined by a final seeding following the Opening Round matches, with teams 1-12-13-24 in Pool A, 2-11-14-23 in Pool B, 3-10-15-22 in Pool C, 4-9-16-21 in Pool D, 5-8-17-20 in Pool E, and 6-7-18-19 in Pool F. The four highest-seeded teams that win their respective pool will earn an automatic spot in Bracket Play, while the remaining first or second-place teams in their pools will meet in four play-in matches to fill out the national quarterfinal field.\n\nABOUT WESTMONT: The Yotes open up tournament play on Tuesday against Westmont, from the always-tough Golden State Athletic Conference. The Warriors (24-8) will be making their eighth trip to Nationals, but their first since the 2002 season. The California school is led offensively by All-GSAC outside hitter Madison Serrano (3.47 k/s, 3.21 d/s, 46 aces) and All-GSAC middle blocker Ciara Turner (2.93 k/s, 0.79 b/s), with All-GSAC setter Candice Adema (10.75 a/s) running the attack, while libero Kristin Schroeder (4.43 d/s, 26 aces) leading the defense. It marks the first-ever meeting between the two schools.\n\nABOUT TEXAS-BROWNSVILLE: Day 2 in Sioux City will see the Yotes face the defending NAIA champions, Texas-Brownsville, ranked No. 2 in the final national poll. The Scorpions (26-1), champions of the Red River Athletic Conference, have lost just nine sets all season – with their lone loss a five-set thriller at Concordia-Irvine. UTB is primarily a foreign team – as 10 of their 12 players hail from outside the United States, with every member of their normal rotation coming from either Brazil or Sebria. Outside hitters Danica Markovic (3.28 k/s, 2.63 d/s, 70 aces) and Michelle Marques (2.84 k/s, 2.47 d/s, 0.77 b/s, 34 aces), along with blockers Ana Guerra (2.13 k/s. 1.80 b/s) and Vanja Joksic (2.42 k/s, 0.78 b/s) all are six-foot or taller – leading an attack that hits at a .304 percentage and averages 2.71 blocks and 2.60 aces per set. Setter Katarina Bursac (10.73 a/s) has been outstanding this season, as has libero Paula Barrios (4.40 d/s, 32 aces). It is the second meeting between the teams, as the Yotes and UTB met in the 2009 National Championships, with the Scorpions topping C of I in four sets.\n\nABOUT ST. FRANCIS: The C of I closes out Pool Play against St. Francis of Joliet, Ill., the champions of the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference. The Saints (37-6) will be making their ninth trip to Nationals, but their first since 2002, and bring a 23-match win streak against NAIA foes. USF is solid in the passing game, as setter Ashley Richards (10.39 a/s, 50 aces) was the CCAC Setter of the Year and libero Dana Wettergren (4.95 d/s) was CCAC Libero of the Year. The Saints are led by Jazzmyne Robbins (3.61 k/s) and Megan Mowery (2.80 k/s),part of an attack that averages 13.43 kills a set. It is the first-ever meeting between the schools.\n\nAGAINST THE REST OF THE FIELD: The Lady Yotes are 0-3 against teams at the Final Site – dropping three-set matches to No. 1 Concordia (Calif.), No. 4 Biola (Calif.), and Cal State San Marcos.\n\nPERFECT IN THE OPENING ROUND: The victory on Saturday over Menlo helped the Yotes improve to 4-0 all-time in Opening Round matches – all in the J.A. Albertson Activities Center. In the four matches (twice against Menlo, also against Carroll and St. Thomas), the Lady Yotes have won 12 of the 13 sets played.\n\nPORTER SISTERS EACH CLOSING IN ON 1,000: The NAIA Championships will see both of the Yotes’ Porter sisters have an opportunity to each crack 1,000 in their respective top stat categories. For junior Janel Porter (Eagle, Idaho / Rocky Mountain HS), she needs just four digs to become the 11th player in program history to record 1,000-digs in a C of I uniform. For freshman Sierra Porter (Eagle, Idaho / Rocky Mountain HS), she needs 76 assists to become the tenth player to record 1,000 assists in a career.\n\nPEACOCK, HULSEY LEADING THE WAY: The Coyote senior starters have been crucial in the success of the squad this season – as both Jessica Peacock (Summertown, Australia / San Diego State U.) and Torrey Hulsey (Sutter, Calif. / West Virginia U.) have put up huge numbers. Peacock, who leads the team with 307 kills, has recorded at least nine kills in each of her last 15 games, while logging five double-doubles this season. Hulsey has recorded at least eight kills in each of her last 14 games and four-or-more blocks in six of her last 10 matches.\n\n20-WIN SEASONS: With their victory on Nov. 10, the Lady Yotes secured their eighth-straight season with at least 20 wins. During the run of 20-win seasons (including the school record 35-4 record in 2006), The C of I has a combined record of 211-51.\n\nYOTES CLINCH PLAYOFF BERTH: The Lady Yotes clinched their 14th-straight playoff appearance with a victory on Oct. 12 against Evergreen – their 12th-straight trip to the postseason under head coach Liz Mendiola. The C of I advanced to regional playoffs in 2001, 2003, and 2005-07, the NAIA National Tournament in 2000, 2005-06, and 2008-12, claiming CCC Tournament titles in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, and 2012.\n\nFINAL TOP-25 POLL: The C of I climbed one spot to No. 14 in the final regular-season Tachikara-NAIA Top-25 poll, released on Nov. 11. The Lady Yotes received 380 voter points from the 23 conference and unaffiliated grouping voters. Concordia (Calif.) holds the top spot, followed by Texas at Brownsville, Columbia (Mo.), Biola (Calif.), and Embry-Riddle (Fla.). Three other C of I opponents’ – No. 11 Westmont, No. 20 Cal State San Marcos and No. 22 Vanguard are in the poll, with St. Francis, Eastern Oregon, and Southern Oregon receiving votes.\n\nHOME STREAK SAFE UNTIL 2013: For the seventh-straight year, the Lady Yotes recorded a perfect home record in CCC play, extending their home win streak in conference action to 71. Since 2005, the Lady Yotes have won 98-of-101 matches in the Activities Center, while posting a 189-39 all-time record in the building, including a sparkling 137-15 record under head coach Liz Mendiola.\n\nLEAGUE LEADERS: As a team, the Lady Yotes lead the CCC in blocks per game (2.18), ranking second in hitting percentage (.222), opponents’ hitting percentage (.145), and kills per set (12.92). The squad is No. 3 in assists per set (11.90) and aces per set (1.72), ranking No. 8 in digs per set (14.54). Individually, five C of I players are in the Top-10, with Torrey Hulsey No. 6 in hitting percentage (.284), No. 8 in blocks per set (0.87), and No. 10 in kills per set (2.78), and Jessica Peacock No. 5 in kills per set (3.16) and hitting percentage (.286), ranking no. 9 in aces per set (0.33).

Libero Janel Porter is closing in on becoming the 11th member of the 1,000-dig club, with 996 digs in her three years with the Yotes.\n\nGAME RECAP – C OF I 3, MENLO 0: Jessica Peacock had 13 kills helping The C of I improve to 4-0 all-time in Opening Round matches, as the Lady Yotes advanced to their fifth-straight NAIA Volleyball National Championships Final Site with a 25-21, 25-20, 25-21 victory over Menlo College, Saturday inside the J.A. Albertson Activities Center. The Lady Yotes won for the 98th time in 101 matches at home dating back to 2005 and evened their NAIA Championships all-time record at 16-16. The C of I jumped out to a 13-9 lead in Set 1, only to watch as the Oaks took advantage of four Coyote errors to rattle off five straight points, taking a 14-13 lead. Tied 18-18, the hosts used a Torrey Hulsey kill to take the lead, closing out the set with a Liz Myers kill and a Myers-Kylee Nawahine (Fruitland, Idaho / BYU-Hawaii) block. The Yotes got two Peacock kills in a 6-1 start to Set 2, but a Nicole Yap kill got Menlo as close as 22-20, before a Nawahine kill, a Janel Porter ace, and a Sofia Anxo (Reno, Nev. / U. of Nevada) spike ended the set. Courtney Calicdan rocketed a pair of kills in a 6-1 run for the Oaks early in Set 3 to take a 15-10 lead, but C of I responded, tying the score at 20-20 on a Peacock kill. The hosts closed out the match with four-straight points, taking advantage of a hitting error to complete the sweep.
