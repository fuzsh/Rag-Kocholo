        "text": "After capturing the Great Northeast Athletic Conference (GNAC) championship during their inaugural season in the conference, the Mitchell College baseball team earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Division III Baseball Tournament. On Monday afternoon, the Mariners learned their fate in the Regional Round, and will travel to Babson College, which was selected as one of 6 regional hosts. They will play on Friday, May 17, at 1:30 p.m.\n\nUnder first-year head coach Shawn Gilblair, the Mariners (32-11) swept a best-of-three championship series against Johnson & Wales University to win the GNAC Championship on Friday, punching their ticket to the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive season and ninth time overall.\n\nMitchell, who surpassed the 30-win mark for the sixth time in the Division III era of the program, have never advanced out of the Regional Round. In 2023, the Mariners hosted a Regional Round for the first time in program history, and entered the final day of play in the driver’s seat, needing just one victory over Wheaton (Mass.) to advance. However, the Lyons upended the Mariners twice, ending Mitchell’s season on their home diamond.\n\nThe Mariners will face the host Beavers (30-11) in one of two games on Friday, while No. 7 Salisbury University (28-9) faces UMass Dartmouth (24-18-1) in the other opening round contest at Govoni Field.\n\nBabson claimed their first New England Women’s and Men’s Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) championship since 2018 on Sunday when they defeated Wheaton College twice to secure their sixth NCAA Tournament berth and first since 2019.\n\nThe Seagulls, who earned an at-large bid will be playing in their 24th consecutive NCAA Division III Tournament and will compete for a national championship for the 29th time in program history. Salisbury has played in every national tournament since 2000, qualifying for the College World Series on eight occasions.\n\nThe Corsairs earned the automatic qualifier after winning the Little East Championship on Saturday. They will be making their eighth trip in program history to the NCAA Tournament and the first since the 2000 season.\n\nTo watch the livestream: https://babsonsportsnetwork.com/\n\nTo view the Regional Tournament homepage: https://babsonathletics.com/feature/2024baseballregional"
