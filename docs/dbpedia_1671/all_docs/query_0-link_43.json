The Bluejays have won seven of their past eight games, including an 85-66 win over No. 1 UConn on Feb. 20 and an 89-75 win vs. No. 5 Marquette on March 2. The Jays share the national lead among Power 6 teams with eight road wins and also own eight Quad 1 wins (fifth nationally).\n\nThe nucleus of the team is formed by three returning starters as senior forward Baylor Scheierman (18.5 ppg., 8.8 rpg., 4.1 apg), senior center Ryan Kalkbrenner (17.1 ppg., 7.3 rpg., 3.0 bpg., 65.0 FG%), and junior guard Trey Alexander (17.5 ppg., 5.8 rpg., 4.9 apg.) all put their professional aspirations on hold and came back.\n\nAdd in senior transfer Steven Ashworth (10.5 ppg,. 4.2 apg.), the USBWA District VII Player of the Year last year at Utah State, and it's easy to see why CU was one of three BIG EAST teams picked in the top-10 nationally in the preseason.\n\nThe Bluejays boast an offense that shoots 49.0 percent from the floor, 77.5 percent at the line and 36.5 percent from three-point land while draining 10.7 three-pointers per contest (sixth-best nationally), which contributes to CU's 80.8 points per game. The Jays also outrebound foes by 4.6 caroms per contest.\n\nThe Bluejay defense has held teams to 69.5 points per game and allowed opponents to make just 179 three-pointers all year. Creighton's 11.26 fouls per game are the fewest in the nation.\n\nThe Creighton Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) owns a 323-158 record in his 14th season with the Bluejays. He ranks 16th among active coaches in victories with a career mark of 603-353 in his 30th season, and is 472-289 in his 23rd Division I campaign.\n\nMcDermott led Creighton to its first BIG EAST regular-season title in 2019-20, taking a Bluejay team that was picked seventh in the league's preseason poll and ending the year ranked seventh nationally. The Cascade, Iowa native has coached Creighton to a share of its first regular-season BIG EAST title in 2019-20 its first Sweet 16 since 1974 in 2020-21 and first Elite Eight since 1941 in 2022-23. His 600th career win was a memorable one, as Creighton knocked off No. 1 UConn on Feb. 20, 2024.\n\nMcDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000).\n\nHe is assisted by Ryan Miller, Jalen Courtney-Williams and Derek Kellogg.\n\nWith A Win...\n\n- Creighton would advance to Friday's 7 p.m. Central semifinal against either Marquette, Villanova or DePaul in a game that will air on FS1 and KOZN (1620 AM).\n\n- Creighton would improve to 11-9 all-time at the BIG EAST Tournament, including a 6-4 mark in the quarterfinals.\n\n- Improve to 5-2 all-time at the BIG EAST Tournament as a No. 2 seed (3-0 in the quarterfinals), and 25-5 all-time in conference tournament action as a No. 2 seed (including the MVC Tournament).\n\n- Improve to 3-0 all-time at the BIG EAST Tournament vs. No. 7 seeds or 3-0 against No. 10 seeds.\n\n- Creighton would improve to 3-2 in the BIG EAST Tournament against Providence or 1-2 against Georgetown in the BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nMilestone Watch\n\n- Trey Alexander owns 1,305 points to rank 21st in CU history and can pass Ryan Sears (1,309) and Kenny Lawson Jr. (1,313) with nine more points.\n\n- Ryan Kalkbrenner is eight blocks shy of 100 this season and nine swats shy of 300 in his career.\n\n- Baylor Scheierman owns 97 three-pointers and is three trifectas shy of joining Kyle Korver (twice) and Ethan Wragge as the third player in CU history with 100 or more in a season.\n\n- Baylor Scheierman has attempted 256 three-pointers this season, 13 attempts shy of Kyle Korver's school record from 2002-03.\n\n- Steven Ashworth is two steals away from 100 in his career.\n\nMcDermott's Tournament History\n\nGreg McDermott owns 17 wins in conference tournaments at CU (10 in the BIG EAST Tournament, 7 in the Missouri Valley Conference Tournament). He led Creighton to the 2012 and 2013 MVC Tournament titles.\n\nGreg McDermott owns a 10-9 record at the BIG EAST Tournament. The other 10 coaches in the league own a combined nine BIG EAST Tournament victories at their current schools, though Rick Pitino is 15-7 between his previous stints at Providence and Louisville and Ed Cooley was 10-10 at the BIG EAST Tourney from his days as Providence coach.\n\nBIG EAST Tournament Records at Current School\n\nCoach, Current School W L Titles\n\nGreg McDermott, CU 10 9 -\n\nShaka Smart, MU 3 1 1\n\nDan Hurley, UConn 3 3 -\n\nSean Miller, XU 2 1 -\n\nKyle Neptune, VU 1 1 -\n\nThad Matta, BU 0 1 -\n\nShaheen Holloway, SHU 0 1 -\n\nMatt Brady, DPU First Year -\n\nRick Pitino, SJU First Year -\n\nEd Cooley, GU First Year -\n\nKim English, PC First Year -\n\nConference Tournament History\n\nCreighton is 10-9 all-time as it enters its 10th appearance at the BIG EAST Tournament, which includes trips to the finals in 2014, 2017, 2021 and 2022. That doesn't include the 2020 trip that was halted at halftime of the quarterfinal round game vs. St. John's at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSince joining the BIG EAST, Creighton is 1-0 in the opening round, 5-4 in the quarterfinals, 4-1 in the semifinals and 0-4 in championship games.\n\nCreighton lost in the title game to Providence in 2014 (65-58), Villanova in 2017 (74-60), Georgetown (73-48) in 2021 and Villanova (54-48) in 2022.\n\nCreighton has won at least one conference tournament game in nine of the previous 12 seasons (which includes three trips to the MVC Tournament). That's tied with Villanova for the most of any current league school in those 12 seasons.\n\nCreighton also enjoyed a highly-successful run at the MVC Tournament in the previous three decades. The Bluejays owned a 43-20 all-time record in MVC Tournament play. Creighton's 12 MVC Tournament titles were seven more than any other school, while its 43 wins and .683 winning percentage in league tourney action also remain tops in event history.\n\nCreighton was 19-12 in the quarterfinals, 12-7 in the semifinals and 12-1 in the championship games as a Valley member. Creighton won the MVC Tournament nine of the last 13 times it won its first game in the event.\n\nCreighton won its MVC Tournament titles in 1978, 1981, 1989, 1991, 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2012 and 2013.\n\nRing Bearers\n\nCreighton's current full-time coaching staff and student-athletes have combined for 15 postseason Division I conference tournament titles as student-athletes or assistant/head coaches, but none have won a BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nGreg McDermott owns three MVC Tourney titles under his belt (one as Northern Iowa coach, two as Creighton coach). CU assistant coach Ryan Miller was an assistant coach on the 2012 New Mexico team that won the Mountain West Conference Tournament.\n\nAssistant coach Derek Kellogg won four Atlantic-10 Conference Tournaments as a student-athlete (1992, 1993, 1994, 1995) at Massachusetts, one as head coach at LIU in 2018 and three as an assistant coach at Memphis (2006, 2007, 2008) and one as an assistant at George Mason (1999).\n\nIn addition, Baylor Scheierman won the 2022 Summit League Tournament title while at South Dakota State and Johnathan Lawson played for the 2023 American Athletic Conference champion Memphis squad.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how many conference tournament titles each person has been a part of:\n\nName Titles Won Years With A Title\n\nDerek Kellogg 9 1992^, '93^, '94^, '95^, '99•, 2006+, '07+, '08+¶, '18%\n\nGreg McDermott 3 2004@, 2012*, 2013*\n\nRyan Miller 1 2012!\n\nBaylor Scheierman 1 2022$\n\nJohnathan Lawson 1 2023#\n\n^ won four A-10 titles as a player at Massachusetts\n\n• won a CAA title as an assistant coach at George Mason\n\n+ won a Conference USA title as an assistant at Memphis\n\n¶ later vacated\n\n% won one NEC title as a head coach at LIU\n\n@ won a MVC title as a head coach at Northern Iowa\n\n* won two MVC titles as a head coach at Creighton\n\n! won a MWC title as an assistant at New Mexico\n\n$ won an Summit League title as a player at South Dakota St.\n\n# won a AAC title as a player at Memphis\n\nRandom League Tournament Facts\n\n-Creighton has won 13 of its last 15 conference tournament games decided by four points or less.\n\n-Creighton is 12-8 in its last 20 conference tournament games when playing an opponent with a better seed than the Bluejays.\n\n-The top two seeds have met in a BIG EAST final just once since 2004, with that coming last year when No. 1 Marquette topped No. 2 Xavier.\n\n-The No. 2 seed has reached the BIG EAST Tournament final each of the previous three years, including No. 2 Villanova's 2022 title game victory over Creighton.\n\n-Creighton is 24-5 all-time in 11 previous conference tournament appearances as a No. 2 seed, including six titles as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference (1981, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2012).\n\nThe Jays have are 4-2 all-time in two previous appearances as the No. 2 seed at the BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nCreighton As the #2 Seed (20-3 MVC; 4-2 BIG EAST)\n\nYear League Record\n\n1980 Missouri Valley 1-1\n\n1981 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n1998 Missouri Valley 0-1\n\n1999 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n2002 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n2003 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n2007 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n2009 Missouri Valley 1-1\n\n2012 Missouri Valley 3-0\n\n2014 BIG EAST 2-1\n\n2021 BIG EAST 2-1\n\n2024 BIG EAST 0-0 so far\n\nEight Tourney Titles Since 1999\n\nCreighton owns eight league tournament titles since 1999. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this (entering this March) are Gonzaga (20), Duke (13), Winthrop (12), New Mexico State (11), Kentucky (10), Kansas (10), Iona (10), Murray State (9), Vermont (9), Belmont (8), Creighton (8), Memphis (8), Montana (8), Penn (8), Texas Southern (8) and Utah State (8).\n\nCreighton has appeared in four title games since the reconfiguration of the BIG EAST in the summer of 2013. That trails only Villanova (6), and are twice as many as Providence (2), Seton Hall (2) and Xavier (2). Georgetown and Marquette have advanced to one final apiece.\n\nPrevious All-Tourney Picks\n\nThis week marks Creighton's 10th trip to the BIG EAST Tournament, not counting the 2020 abbreviated trek that was halted at halftime of its first game.\n\nIn the previous nine trips played to completion, the only men to earn All-Tournament Team honors has been Doug McDermott and Austin Chatman, who helped take CU to the finals in 2014, Marcus Foster, who led the Jays to the 2017 title tilt, Marcus Zegarowski when CU reached the final in 2021, both Arthur Kaluma and Ryan Kalkbrenner in CU's 2022 trip to the final, and Kalkbrenner again in 2023.\n\nMcDermott scored 94 points in his three games, making 34-of-63 shots from the field, 14-of-28 three-point shots and 12-of-14 attempts from the line. He set a BIG EAST Tournament record for points in a half (since broken) when he scored 27 in the first half vs. DePaul.\n\nChatman averaged 8.7 points, 6.7 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game in 2014 while directing the Bluejay offense. He made 9-of-16 shots from the floor.\n\nIn 2017 Foster averaged 16.3 points, 3.3 assists and 2.7 rebounds per game at The Garden. His three-pointer in the closing seconds of the semifinal lifted Creighton to a 75-72 win and advanced the Bluejays to their second title game in four seasons.\n\nIn 2021, Zegarowski averaged 16.0 points, 4.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game while shooting 61.5 percent from three-point range as the Bluejays reached the finals.\n\nIn 2022 Kalkbrenner averaged 16.0 points, 8.7 rebounds and 3.0 blocks per game, while Kaluma averaged 13.3 points and 6.3 rebounds en route to the finals.\n\nLast year Kalkbrenner averaged 19.5 points and 1.5 blocked shots while making 16-of-19 shots (84.2 percent) to help CU to the semifinals.\n\nCreighton has never had a BIG EAST Tournament MVP. It's last conference tournament MVP was Doug McDermott in both 2012 and 2013 when CU belonged to the Missouri Valley Conference. McDermott is also CU's last player to earn be named to three different All-Conference Tournament accolades.\n\nFamous Moment, Famous Coach, Famous Arena\n\nMadison Square Garden is often referred to as the \"World's Most Famous Arena\", and a former Creighton coach is involved in what a 2013 Bleacher Report poll named the greatest moment in Madison Square Garden history.\n\nAfter missing Game 6 with a severe thigh injury, NBA MVP Willis Reed limped out of the tunnel prior to Game 7 of the 1970 NBA Finals to raucous applause. He would start and make the New York Knicks' first two baskets. Though he wouldn't score again, the tone was set and he was named Finals MVP.\n\nReed would later serve as head coach at Creighton from 1981-85, winning 52 games.\n\nKalkbrenner A Top Defender\n\nCreighton center Ryan Kalkbrenner was named 2024 BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year for the third straight season.\n\nKalkbrenner is just the third player in league history to win the recognition three times or more, joining Georgetown greats Patrick Ewing (4x) and Alonzo Mourning (3x).\n\nBetween Kalkbrenner and 2017 & 2018 winner Khyri Thomas, Creighton has now had a BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year in five of the last eight seasons.\n\nMost BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year Honors\n\nHonors Name, School Years (*ties)\n\n4 Patrick Ewing, Georgetown 1982, 83, 84, 85\n\n3 Alonzo Mourning, Georgetown 1989, 90*, 92\n\n3 Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton 2022, 23, '24\n\n2 Dikembe Mutombo, Georgetown 1990*, 91\n\n2 Allen Iverson, Georgetown 1995, 96\n\n2 Etan Thomas, Syracuse 1999, 00\n\n2 John Linehan, Providence 2001, 02\n\n2 Emeka Okafor, Connecticut 2003, 04\n\n2 Hasheem Thabeet, Connecticut 2008, 09\n\n2 Kris Dunn, Providence 2015*, 16\n\n2 Khyri Thomas, Creighton 2017*, 18\n\nAccomplished, To Say The Least\n\nNo Creighton player has put up career totals at the BIG EAST Tournament like Ryan Kalkbrenner has.\n\nNot only is he the only two-time All-BIG EAST Tournament Team honoree in program history, but he also owns the following records as well:\n\nSingle-Game\n\nField Goal Pct.

That included the nation's No. 23 offense, and No. 14 defense.

It's the most games of 13 three-pointers in any season under Greg McDermott.\n\nCreighton has made at least 13 three-pointers in each of its last three games, the first time any BIG EAST school has done that since Creighton itself in December of 2020. The last non-Creighton team from the BIG EAST to do it was Villanova's 2017-18 national champion team, which had three such streaks.\n\nThe only BIG EAST team since 2005-06 to make 13 three-pointers in four straight games was Marquette from Dec. 21, 2017 - Jan. 3, 2018.\n\nCreighton owns seven different games this season in which it has made 10 or more three-pointers than its opponent, which leads the nation.\n\nThe Bluejays have had three different games this season in which they've made 10 or more triples before halftime.\n\nCreighton has made three or more three-pointers in all but five halves this season.\n\nLet It Fly\n\nCreighton tied the BIG EAST single-season record for league play by making 206 three-pointers and broke the single-season record by taking 585 three-point attempts.\n\nThe previous record was 206 three-pointers made by Villanova's 2017-18 national champion team, while the previous mark for triple tries in league play was 557 by Villanova in 2018-19.\n\nNot So Regular Of A Season\n\nCreighton enters the postseason with 23 victories, tied for its seventh-most ever entering conference tournament play.\n\nEach of its other teams with 23 regular-season wins posted at least one conference tournament victory, and three went on to cut down the nets.\n\nMost CU Regular-Season Wins\n\nRS Wins Season League Tourney NCAA/NIT\n\n26 2002-03 3-0 0-1 NCAA\n\n25 2008-09 1-1 1-1 NIT\n\n25 2011-12 3-0 1-1 NCAA\n\n24 2012-13 3-0 1-1 NCAA\n\n24 2013-14 2-1 1-1 NCAA\n\n24 2019-20 Cancelled Cancelled\n\n23 2000-01 1-1 0-1 NCAA\n\n23 2016-17 2-1 0-1 NCAA\n\n23 2023-24 TBD TBD\n\nAlexander Shines on Brightest Stage\n\nTrey Alexander became the third different Creighton player to score 30 or more points at Madison Square Garden in the 22 games the Jays have played there since joining the BIG EAST in 2013.\n\nThe 31 points for Alexander, who was playing his 100th career game, were a season-high and one shy of his career-high done on Dec. 25, 2022 vs. DePaul.\n\nAlexander was Creighton's first player to score 30 or more since Ryan Nembhard had 30 points in a win over No. 11 Baylor on March 19, 2023.\n\nCreighton has not had a player score 30 points in consecutive games since Doug McDermott did in three straight games on March 8-14, 2014, with the latter two games taking place at MSG.\n\nAlexander has averaged 20.5 points in Creighton's last 11 games. The only other Bluejays to score 225 points or more in a 11-game stretch since 2005-06 have been Doug McDermott and Marcus Foster.\n\nHere's a look at Creighton's 30-point games at The World's Most

Tournament\n\nScheierman's Week Recognized\n\nSenior Baylor Scheierman was named BIG EAST Player of the Week and FOX Sports Army National Guard of the Week on March 4th after helping Creighton to a pair of double-digit home wins.\n\nScheierman averaged 23.0 points, 13.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.5 steals per game as Creighton posted wins over Seton Hall (85-64) and No. 5 Marquette (89-75). Scheierman made 14-of-28 shots from the floor, including 12-of-22 three-pointers, and was also perfect in six free throw attempts.\n\nScheierman had 20 points, 11 rebounds, three assists and three steals in an 85-64 win over Seton Hall. During the contest he became the 11th men's player in history to surpass 1,000 career points at multiple Division I schools, and also surpassed Kenneth Faried's mark for most career defensive rebounds by any player in the country since 1999-2000.\n\nIn the March 2 win over Marquette, Scheierman had 26 points and a season-high 16 rebounds to go with four rebounds, two steals and a blocked shot in his final home game. The performance made him the first Power 6 player with a game of 16 rebounds and six three-pointers since Marquette's Steve Novak in January of 2006. Scheierman is the nation's first Power 6 men's player since Texas' Kevin Durant in 2007 with at least 25 rebounds and 10 three-pointers made over any two-game stretch.\n\nHe also became the first Creighton player ever to make six three-pointers in consecutive games. Scheierman is the BIG EAST's third player to make six three-pointers in back-to-back games since 2020, joining Marquette's Kam Jones (Feb. 21-25, 2024) and Georgetown's Jayden Epps (Nov. 19-25, 2023).\n\nIt was the second time this season that Scheierman has been named BIG EAST Player of the Week, having also been recognized on December 4th.\n\nBaylor The Beast\n\nBaylor Scheierman's performance of 26 points and 16 rebounds vs. No. 5 Marquette was just the third Creighton performance in the last 20 years with at least 25 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nThe only other men to do it were Doug McDermott (33 & 15) vs. Tulsa on Nov. 23, 2013 and Kenny Lawson Jr. (30 & 18) vs. Saint Joseph's on Dec. 11, 2010.\n\nScheierman's 16 rebounds were the most by a Bluejay since Arthur Kaluma at Connecticut on Jan. 7, 2023.\n\nChasing A Bid\n\nEven though a certain NCAA bid was wiped away in 2020 by COVID-19, Creighton has still appeared in each of the last three NCAA Tournaments (2021, 2022, 2023), and is in great shape to make it four in a row in a few weeks on Selection Sunday.\n\nThe only previous time that Creighton has appeared in more than three straight NCAA Tournaments was a run of five straight from 1999-2003.\n\nCreighton has made 24 previous NCAA Tournament appearances, including eight under Greg McDermott, and was one of the final eight teams remaining in both 1941 and 2023.\n\nBonus From The Bench\n\nCreighton's bench went 7-for-7 from the field and 2-for-2 from three-point range in its March 2 win over No. 5 Marquette.\n\nIt was the first time since Jan. 17, 1987 that Creighton's bench has been perfect from the floor on multiple shots, and first time it was perfect from three-point range with multiple attempts since shooting 3-for-3 from deep on March 10, 2017 in a BIG EAST Tournament semifinal win vs. Xavier.\n\nCreighton's bench is averaging 11.4 points per game this year and shooting 50 percent from deep and 37.8 percent from the floor. That's the most points per game from its reserve corps since 2020-21 (15.4 ppg.) and best three-point shooting percentage off the pine since the 2018-19 subs shot 42.2 percent.\n\nTrey Dishes, Too\n\nTrey Alexander had back-to-back career-high assist totals, following up his 10 dimes vs. Seton Hall on Feb. 28 with 11 helpers vs. No. 5 Marquette on March 2nd.\n\nAlexander joined Maurice Watson Jr. (Dec. 9 & Dec. 17, 2016) as Creighton's only players with back-to-back points/assists double-doubles since 1978-79.\n\nBesides Watson (twice in 2016-17) and Grant Gibbs (once in 2011-12), Creighton had not had another player with two straight games of 10 or more assists since at least 1979-80, and none of them extended the streak to three in a row either.\n\nThe only other BIG EAST player since 2020 with back-to-back points/assists double-doubles is Marquette's Tyler Kolek, who did it twice.\n\nTrouble With The Top 10\n\nCreighton beat No. 1 UConn (Feb. 20) and No. 5 Marquette (March 2), becoming the fifth BIG EAST team ever to earn back-to-back Top 5 wins without losing in between.\n\nNationally, Creighton, Kansas and Purdue are the only three schools with multiple Top 5 wins this season.\n\nBIG EAST History, Consecutive Top 5 Wins\n\nYear Team Game 1 Game 2\n\n2023-24 Creighton #1 UConn #5 Marquette\n\n2017-18 Villanova #4 Xavier #4 Kansas\n\n2002-03 Syracuse #3 Oklahoma #5 Texas\n\n1984-85 Georgetown #1 St. John's #3 St. John's\n\n1981-82 Georgetown #4 Missouri #4 Oregon St.\n\nCreighton vs. Everybody\n\nCreighton has beaten every other BIG EAST team this season.\n\nIt's the fourth time in 11 years in the BIG EAST that Creighton has earned a victory over every other league rival, joining 2013-14, 2019-20 and 2020-21.\n\nKalkbrenner Chases 100 Rejections\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns 92 blocked shots this season and is eight away from 100. Kalkbrenner, who has had 72, 89 and now 92 blocks the past three seasons, joins Benoit Benjamin (who had 92, 157 and 162 swats) as the only players in CU history with more than 70 rejections in a season.\n\nKalkbrenner's 92 blocks this year are 22 more than the previous CU record by a senior, a mark that had been set by Chad Gallagher in 1990-91.\n\nMost Blocked Shots, Season\n\nBlk.

Since 1992-93, Scheierman is just the fourth player in the country with a season like that, joining Shane Battier, Brandon Miller and Dylan Windler.\n\nScheierman's Senior Day performance on March 2 vs. No. 5 Marquette made him the first Power 6 player with at least 16 rebounds and six three-pointers in a game since Marquette's Steve Novak vs. Connecticut on Jan. 3, 2006.\n\n274 Rebounds & 97 3-Pointers - Since 1992-93\n\nName REB 3FG Year\n\nShane Battier, Duke 285 124 2000-01\n\nBrandon Miller, Alabama 305 106 2022-23\n\nDylan Windler, Belmont 357 100 2018-19\n\nBaylor Scheierman, Creighton 274 97 2023-24\n\nLeading The Way?\n\nCreighton had three men lead the league in a statistical category for league play only, which requires participation in at least 75 percent of conference games.\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner shot 64.7 percent from the field in league play, becoming CU's sixth player in 11 years to lead that BIG EAST category and joining Doug McDermott (.541 in 2013-14), Geoffrey Groselle (.656 in 2015-16), Justin Patton (.663 in 2016-17), Christian Bishop (.654 in 2020-21) and Kalkbrenner himself (.675 in 2022-23). Kalkbrenner is the first player to lead the league in that category in back-to-back years since UConn's Emeka Okafor in 2002-03 and 2003-04.\n\nKalkbrenner also led the league with 3.4 blocked shots per game. Kalkbrenner (last year) is the only previous Bluejay to lead the BIG EAST in blocks per game. Kalkbrenner's 67 blocks this year in conference contests are the most by any BIG EAST player since Rutgers' Hamady Ndiaye had 69 in 2009-10.\n\nBaylor Scheierman owned the BIG EAST lead with 8.9 defensive rebounds per game in league play, becoming Creighton's first player to lead the BIG EAST in defensive rebounds per game.\n\nScheierman also led the conference with 9.8 reobunds per league game. He's CU's first player to do that since joining the BIG EAST.\n\nLast but not least, Trey Alexander (38.2) led the BIG EAST in minutes per game, CU's first minutes per game leader since joining the BIG EAST.\n\nKeep An Eye On\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owns the league record for career field goal percentage in BIG EAST play at 64.2 percent, well ahead of runner-up Georgetown's Patrick Ewing (.608). The list requires five field goals made per game, and Kalkbrenner qualifies thanks to his 392 hoops in 78 games.\n\nKalkbrenner also owns 193 career blocked shots in league play. That ranks seventh-most all-time, trailing only Patrick Ewing (247), Hasheem Thabeet (243), Etan Thomas (232), Alonzo Mourning (224), Jason Lawson (216) and Emeka Okafor (207) and just ahead of Dikembe Mutombo (184).\n\nWhy Creighton Will Win The National Title\n\nWe've come up with three reasons why Creighton is a lock to win the 2024 NCAA title.\n\nEach of the last three times that Villanova hosted their final game of the regular-season, the winner of that game went on to win the NCAA title. The Wildcats beat Georgetown 84-71 in 2016, then beat the Hoyas 97-73 in 2018. Last year, UConn defeated the Wildcats 71-59. All three of those games took place at Wells Fargo Center. This year, Creighton defeated Villanova 69-67 on March 9th.\n\nSecondly, since 2010-11, the only two BIG EAST teams to finish a season making 150 three-pointers or more than the opposition have been Villanova (+192 in 2018) and Connecticut (+159 in 2023). Both the Wildcats and Huskies went on to win the NCAA title. Creighton is currently +154.\n\nAdditionally, Creighton's 22-point win at Butler on Feb. 17th was tied for the 14th-largest home loss suffered inside HInkle Fieldhouse, which opened in 1928. In the past 32 seasons, the only two teams to beat Butler there by 22 points or more both went on to win the NCAA title.\n\nButler's Home Losses By 22+ Points Since 1992-93\n\nScore Opponent Date\n\n103-56 North Carolina 12/20/1992\n\n68-46 Connecticut 12/17/2022\n\n79-57 Creighton 02/17/2024\n\nMcDermott Ranks Second On CU Wins List\n\nGreg McDermott has 323 victories at Creighton, good for second place on CU's all-time wins list.\n\nMcDermott's .672 winning percentage is Creighton's best since Arthur A. Schabinger's .714 win rate more than 85 years ago.\n\nBelow is a list of the most victorious Creighton coaches in program history.\n\nMost Coaching Wins, Creighton History\n\nRk.

He earned his second such contest just three days later when he had 18 points and established a new career-high with 11 assists.\n\nAlexander has also had two points/rebounds double-doubles this season, finishing with 23 points and 11 rebounds vs. Iowa on Nov. 14 and 16 points and 15 rebounds vs. Villanova on Dec. 20th.\n\nTaking Away The Three\n\nNot only does Creighton have three-time BIG EAST Defensive Player of the Year Ryan Kalkbrenner patrolling the paint, but the Jays have been remarkably effective in running opponents off the three-point line as well.\n\nCreighton has allowed opponents to make just 25-of-82 three-pointers over the past five games, while the Jays have drained 59 three-pointers in that same time.\n\nFor the year, Creighton has made 333 three-pointers while surrendering just 179 triples. That +154 differential is third-best in the country, behind only North Florida (+183) and BYU (+156). Since 2010-11, the only two BIG EAST teams to finish a season at +150 or better were Villanova (+192 in 2018) and Connecticut (+159 in 2023). Both the Wildcats and Huskies went on to win the NCAA title.\n\nCreighton's 5.77 three-pointers allowed per game is second-fewest in the nation among Power 6 schools, trailing only Maryland (5.13).\n\nSold Out in Omaha\n\nCreighton sold out six home games this season: Iowa, Alabama, DePaul, Butler, UConn and Marquette.\n\nCreighton has also played in front of six sell out crowds on the road this year, doing so at Nebraska, Marquette, UConn, Xavier, Butler and Seton Hall this season.\n\nCreighton ranks sixth nationally this season with 17,269 fans per home game.\n\n2023-24 NCAA Home Attendance Per Game Leaders\n\nThrough 3/10/24\n\nRank School Average\n\n1.

Going a step further, no \"Power 6\" team has finished a season with three men averaging 17 points per game since Duke in 2009-10 (Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler and Nolan Smith). No BIG EAST team has done it since Syracuse in 1989-90 (Derrick Coleman, Billy Owens and Stephen Thompson).\n\nGive Me 10\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner, Baylor Scheierman and Trey Alexander own three of the BIG EAST's five longest active streaks for games with 10 or more points, as seen below.\n\nKalkbrenner has also scored eight points or more in 54 straight games, the nation's fifth-longest active streak.\n\nConsecutive Games With 10+ Points\n\nActive Streaks - BIG EAST Players (through 3/12)\n\nStreak Name, School Next Game\n\n31 Devin Carter, Providence 3/13\n\n28 Quincy Olivari, Xavier 3/13\n\n18 Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton 3/14\n\n16 Baylor Scheierman, Creighton 3/14\n\n13 Trey Alexander, Creighton 3/14\n\nConsecutive Games With 8+ Points\n\nActive Streaks - Nationally (through 3/10)\n\nStreak Name, School Next Game\n\n81 Zach Edey, Purdue 3/15\n\n58 Dillon Jones, Weber State 3/11\n\n55 Mervin James, Rider 3/14\n\n54 Tristan Enaruna, Cleveland State 3/11\n\n54 Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton 3/14\n\nScheierman Passes 1,000 Points at Creighton\n\nWith 20 points on Feb. 28th vs. Seton Hall, Baylor Scheierman became the 47th player to score 1,000 points in a Bluejay uniform. He accomplished the feat in his 66th game at CU, becoming the first Bluejay to reach 1,000 points in fewer than 75 games at CU since Marcus Foster needed just 54 in 2018.\n\nScheierman is the third Bluejay transfer from a four-year school to reach 1,000 career points at CU, joining Gregory Echenique (Rutgers) and Marcus Foster (Kansas State). Two other junior college transfers (Rod Mason and Johnny Mathies) have also scored 1,000 points after joining the Bluejays but starting elsewhere.\n\nHere's a list of Creighton's top scorers ever, as well as how long it took CU's last 23 men to reach 1,000 points.\n\nMost Career Points, Creighton History\n\nRank Pts.

Auburn (5), Duke (4), Arizona (4) are the only other \"Power 6\" schools with more than three against \"Power 6\" foes.\n\n22 Going On 23\n\nCreighton is one of 10 teams in the nation with 23 or more wins in both men's basketball and women's basketball this season.\n\nThat list consists of Creighton, Drake, Gonzaga, Grand Canyon, James Madison, Marquette, Princeton, Richmond, South Carolina and UConn.\n\nCreighton is one of eight schools to have men's and women's basketball programs to both own 22 wins or more each of the previous two seasons, a list that included Creighton, Gonzaga, Liberty, Princeton, Tennessee, Texas, Toledo and UConn.\n\nOf those clubs, Creighton, Gonzaga, Princeton and UConn have done it yet again, while Liberty, Tennessee, Texas and Toledo are trying to join them.\n\n22+ Wins, Each of 2 Previous MBB & WBB Years\n\nTeam 23-24 MBB Wins 23-24 WBB Wins\n\nCreighton 22+ 22+\n\nGonzaga 22+ 22+\n\nPrinceton 22+ 22+\n\nUConn 22+ 22+\n\nTexas 20 22+\n\nToledo 20 22+\n\nTennessee 22+ 19\n\nLiberty 18 16\n\nMcDermott Earns 600th Win\n\nGreg McDermott picked up his 600th career win on Feb. 20 vs. No. 1 Connecticut. McDermott now owns 603 victories, has won 50 or more games at four different schools, and owns a .632 career winning percentage in 30 seasons and 956 games as a head coach.

Creighton is one of seven schools with a non-losing conference record in 28 of the last 29 seasons.\n\nThe only BIG EAST teams to finish .500 or better in league play each of the last nine seasons (including 2023-24) are Creighton, Villanova and Seton Hall.\n\nCreighton finished 14-6 in the BIG EAST last season and with 13 years already is assured a fifth straight season with 12 or more league wins. Among the other \"Power 6\" Conference schools, only Virginia (7 straight years) also has an active streak of five years or longer after 2023-24.\n\nMost Seasons .500 or Better League Record\n\nLast 29 Seasons (includes 2023-24)\n\nSeasons Team\n\n29 Duke\n\n29 Kansas\n\n29 Gonzaga\n\n28 Kentucky\n\n28 Michigan State\n\n28 Creighton\n\n28 Murray State\n\nConsecutive Seasons .500 or Better League Record\n\nPower 6 Schools (includes 2023-24)\n\nSeasons Team\n\n35 Kansas\n\n29 Duke\n\n13 Virginia\n\n13 Oregon\n\n12 Villanova\n\n9 Creighton\n\n9 Houston\n\n9 Seton Hall\n\n9 Florida\n\nConsecutive Seasons 12+ League Wins\n\nPower 6 Schools (includes 2023-24)\n\nSeasons Team\n\n7 Virginia\n\n5 Creighton\n\nGetting Hot In Here\n\nCreighton went 4-3 in its first seven BIG EAST games this season, when it averaged 68.1 points per contest.\n\nThe Jays have turned it up a notch or two since then, averaging 84.4 points in the past 13 games. That includes 85+ points nine times, and 69, 78 and 79 in three of the exceptions (each wins).\n\nIn those 13 games, Trey Alexander (20.1 ppg.), Baylor Scheierman (19.6) and Ryan Kalkbrenner (19.0) are all on a scoring terror. That makes them the nation's ONLY Power 6 trio in the past 20 years with three men to average 19 points per game or more over a 13-game stretch. In all leagues, it hadn't been done since Marshall from Nov. 10-Dec. 22, 2017 (C.J. Burks, Jon Elmore, Ajdin Penava).\n\nScheierman has averaged 19.6 points, 9.8 rebounds and 4.4 assists in the past 13 games. He joins Trayce Jackson-Davis (Indiana), Ethan Happ (Wisconsin) and Ben Simmons (LSU) as the only Power 6 players since with those averages in any single-season 13-game span since 2005-06.\n\nCreighton's 84.4 points per game is its most prolific 13-game stretch of conference play in program history, far ahead of a 13-game stretch in 1990-91 when it averaged 80.4 points per game.\n\nCategory First 7 in BE Last 13 in BE\n\nCreighton W-L 4-3 10-3\n\nPoints Per Game 68.1 84.4\n\nScoring Margin/Game +4.6 +9.3\n\nAlexander PPG 15.9 20.1\n\nScheierman PPG 16.4 19.6\n\nKalkbrenner PPG 15.0 19.0\n\nAshworth PPG 8.6 13.3\n\nAshworth 3FG/Game 1.57 2.77\n\nAshworth 3FG% .256 .355\n\nGreen Points Scored 0 23\n\nTeam FG% .444 .499\n\nTeam 3FG% .296 .379\n\nTeam FT% .761 .799\n\nTeam A/TO Ratio 1.12 1.95\n\nThe Road Difference\n\nCreighton has outscored teams by 68 points in its 13 true road games this season.

Ironically, fans stormed twice on that late-night evening, once when Antoine Young's shot at the buzzer went through the net, and again moments later after the court was cleared and time was put back on the clock and the final 0.3 seconds were played.\n\nIt also happened on March 7, 2020, when Creighton defeated No. 8 Seton Hall to clinch a share of its first BIG EAST regular-season title.\n\nDown Goes No. 1\n\nCreighton defeated No. 1 UConn, 85-66, on Feb. 20th. It was the largest win over a top-ranked team since 2018, when UMBC upset Virginia 74-54 in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nPer Elias, here is a list of the 18 times in history that a No. 1 team has lost by 19 points or more.\n\nTop-Ranked Losses by 19+ Points\n\nDate Winner Loser Score\n\n12/17/51 #2 Kentucky #1 St. John's 81-40\n\n03/03/62 Wisconsin #1 Ohio State 86-67\n\n12/11/65 #6 Duke #1 UCLA 94-75\n\n03/22/68* #2 UCLA #1 Houston 101-69\n\n01/26/74 #2 UCLA #1 Notre Dame 94-75\n\n03/07/81 #5 Arizona State #1 Oregon State 87-67\n\n01/18/89 #13 N.

Austin beat Duke and Texas Tech topped Louisville.\n\nAccording to college basketball stats extraordinaire Jared Berson, it's the first time ever that two different schools from the same state beat the No. 1 team by 15+ points in the same season.\n\nThis year marks just the fourth time that Creighton and Nebraska will both finish with 21 wins in the same season, as it also previously happened in 1990-91 and 2017-18. Both teams also did it in 1976-77 but Nebraska had some wins vacated later.\n\nWorking Overtime\n\nCreighton has played in three different overtime games this season, losing to Villanova (Dec. 20), winning at Seton Hall in triple-overtime (Jan. 20) and losing at Providence (Feb. 7).\n\nIt was just the second triple-overtime game in history for Creighton, joining a Feb. 1, 1978 loss (85-82) in Omaha to No. 13 DePaul in a non-conference contest.\n\nCreighton's last overtime win had been its 72-69 win over San Diego State during the 2022 NCAA Tournament.\n\nCreighton is 62-53 all-time in all games with at least one overtime, including a 12-9 mark under Greg McDermott. The Jays are 11-10 in the next game after an overtime battle.\n\nYou Can't Spell McDermott Without OT\n\nGreg McDermott is 17-14 in single-overtime games (9-8 at Creighton), 6-3 in double-overtime games (2-1 at Creighton) and 1-0 in triple-overtime games (1-0 at Creighton).\n\nMcDermott's first overtime game as a Division I head coach was a 2002 Northern Iowa win over Creighton. His first double-overtime game as a Division I coach was a 2004 victory over Missouri State in the MVC Tournament title game, which clinched his first appearance in the NCAA Tournament as a Division I head coach.\n\nExtra, Extra, Extra!\n\nCreighton has played five overtime sessions this season. That's already third-most in program history, trailing only the 1989-90 team (7 OTs) and the 2001-02 squad (6 OTs).\n\nThis is the sixth time that Creighton's played an overtime game in three consecutive months, something also done in 1988-89, 1989-90, 1995-96, 1999-2000, 2014-15.\n\nThis season also marks the 12th time in Creighton history that the Bluejays have played three or more overtime games in the same season. The program record is four such contests, done in 1989-90, 1993-94, 2001-02 and 2018-19.\n\nThis is the third time that Creighton's played three or more conference games to go overtime in the same campaign, joining 1994-95 (4) and 2018-19 (4).\n\nLastly, this is the third time in program history that Creighton has played an overtime road game in back-to-back seasons against the same team. It also happened in 1989 & 1990 at Wichita State (CU won both) as well as in 2010 & 2011 at Southern Illinois (CU won both).\n\nMost Overtime Sessions, Creighton Season\n\nOT's Year\n\n7 1989-90\n\n6 2001-02\n\n5 2023-24\n\nMost Overtime Games, Creighton Season\n\nOT's Year\n\n4 1989-90\n\n4 1993-94\n\n4 2001-02\n\n4 2018-19\n\n3 1983-84\n\n3 1988-89\n\n3 1995-96\n\n3 1999-00\n\n3 2005-06\n\n3 2007-08\n\n3 2014-15\n\n3 2023-24\n\nOn The Triple\n\nThe Jan. 20th triple-overtime thriller was the first BIG EAST game to go three overtimes or longer since No. 11 Providence beat Xavier 99-92 on Feb. 23, 2022.\n\nIn fact, that's the only other triple-overtime game since the BIG EAST reconfigured on July 1, 2013.\n\nThis season, there's only been nine games nationally to go three overtimes or longer, as seen below:\n\nDate Winner Loser Score\n\n11/16/23 Nicholls at South Alabama 102-97\n\n11/29/23 at Temple La Salle 106-99\n\n01/03/24 Fordham at George Washington 119-113\n\n01/13/24 at Winthrop Radford 92-88\n\n01/20/24 Creighton at Seton Hall 97-94\n\n01/27/24 TCU at Baylor 105-102\n\n02/08/24 Arizona at Utah 105-99\n\n02/28/24 Drake at UIC 108-106\n\n03/06/24 Texas A&M-Commerce Northwestern St. 83-80\n\nScheierman Makes Triple-Double History\n\nBefore Baylor Scheierman had 15 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists on Feb. 13th against Georgetown, Creighton had never had a player earn a triple-double in points/rebounds/assists.\n\nBenoit Benjamin attained the only three previous triple-doubles in Creighton history, but each one consisted of 10 or more points, rebounds and blocks.\n\nHere's a look at games this season when a Creighton player has had at least six points, six rebounds and six assists.\n\n6+ Points, 6+ Rebounds, 6+ Assists This Season\n\nName Opponent Pts.

Here's where the fifth-year senior would rank in Creighton history if all his stats were attained with the Bluejays:\n\nCategory CU Career Rank* Baylor's Totals\n\nGames Played 1st 158\n\n3-Point Field Goals Att. 1st 879\n\nRebounds 2nd 1,215\n\nAssists 2nd 568\n\n3-Point Field Goals 2nd 343\n\nPoints 2nd 2,159\n\nField Goals Attempted 4th 1,593\n\nField Goals Made 6th 739\n\nFree Throw Percentage 6th .814\n\nSteals 8th 153\n\n*if all of Scheierman's stats had come at Creighton\n\nDoing It All\n\nCreighton's Baylor Scheierman and Providence's Devin Carter are the only men in the BIG EAST to average at least 17.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists per game this season.\n\nPrior to this year, only five BIG EAST players have ever accomplished that feat over the course of a full season, and none since Providence's Ryan Gomes in 2004-05.\n\nUp the average to 3.5 assists per game and prior to Scheierman and Carter, no one's done it since Syracuse's Billy Owens in 1989-90.\n\nBIG EAST Players To Average 17 PPG, 8 RPG, 3 APG\n\nSeason Name, School PPG RPG APG\n\n1989-90 Billy Owens, Syracuse 18.2 8.4 4.6\n\n1990-91 Billy Owens, Syracuse 23.3 11.6 3.46\n\n1995-96 Adrian Griffin, Seton Hall 19.5 8.3 3.1\n\n1999-00 Ricardo Greer, Pitt 18.1 9.8 3.2\n\n2004-05 Ryan Gomes, Providence 21.6 8.2 3.2\n\n2023-24 Baylor Scheierman, CU 18.5 8.8 4.1\n\n2023-24 Devin Carter, PC 19.4 8.6 3.6\n\nKalk Of The Walk\n\nIn a league that features two of the five finalists for the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Center of the Year Award (Kalkbrenner and Clingan), Creighton's Ryan Kalkbrenner has performed at a high level as he's averaging 17.1 points, 7.3 rebounds and 3.0 blocked shots per game.\n\nPrior to this year, only seven BIG EAST players since 1992-93 have averaged 16.0 points, 7.0 rebounds and 2.5 blocks over the course of a full season, and none since Providence's Herbert Hill in 2006-07.\n\nBIG EAST Players To Average 16 PPG, 7 RPG, 2.5 BPG\n\nSeason Name, School PPG RPG BPG\n\n1993-94 Donyell Marshall, UConn 25.1 8.9 3.3\n\n2000-01 Eddie Griffin, Seton Hall 17.8 10.8 4.4\n\n2001-02 Ryan Humphrey, Notre Dame18.9 10.9 2.8\n\n2002-03 Mike Sweetney, Georgetown 22.8 10.4 3.2\n\n2003-04 Emeka Okafor, UConn 17.6 11.5 4.1\n\n2006-07 Herbert Hill, Providence 18.1 8.8 2.9\n\n2023-24 Ryan Kalkbrenner, Creighton 17.1 7.3 3.0\n\nBlock Party\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner owned a career-high eight blocked shots on Feb. 25 at St. John's. That made him the first Bluejay with eight rejections since Doug Swenson at UMKC on Nov. 18, 1998, and the first BIG EAST player with eight swats in a game since DePaul's Nick Ongenda vs. St. John's on Feb. 14, 2023.\n\nBenoit Benjamin dominates Creighton's single-game blocked shot list, as seen below:\n\nBlk.

Since 2005-06, the only other 7-footer to play 53 minutes or more in any college game was former Connecticut center Hasheem Thabeet. The 7-foot-3 UConn big man played 53 minutes in a memorable six-overtime loss to Syracuse that started on March 12, 2009 at the BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nSpeaking of Kalkbrenner, his seven blocked shots that day tied the most ever by one of Greg McDermott's players in 23 seasons as a Division I head coach. Gregory Echenique also had seven vs. Missouri State on Jan. 22, 2011.\n\nKalkbrenner became the first player from a \"Power 6\" conference with at least 28 points, nine rebounds and seven blocks in a game since Providence's Herbert Hill (29/15/8) vs. Syracuse on Feb. 24, 2007.\n\nBaylor Scheierman (20/10/6/0) became the first BIG EAST player since Georgetown's Jessie Govan (20/10/6/0) vs. UNC Greensboro on Dec. 22, 2016) to finish with at least 20 points, 10 rebounds, six assists and no turnovers.\n\nKadary Richmond attempted 32 field goals were the most against Creighton by a single player in at least 40 seasons, four more than the 28 by Western Michigan's Jim Havrilla on Dec. 8, 1990.\n\nCreighton had 82 field goal attempts at Seton Hall, its most in a game in at least 35 years. Seton Hall had 86 field goal attempts, the most by a Creighton opponent in at least 35 years. It was the first BIG EAST game since at least 2010 in which both teams attempted 80 or more shots.\n\nCreighton made 13 three-pointers and blocked 10 shots in that game vs. Seton Hall. It was its first time with 10 or more in both categories since Feb. 17, 2002 vs. Wichita State.\n\n55 Minutes For Number 55\n\nBaylor Scheierman played all 55 minutes on Jan. 20th at Seton Hall, setting a Creighton single-game record.\n\nHe's the first BIG EAST player to play 55 minutes or more in a game since four men 60 by Eric Atkins; 56 each by Pat Connaughton, Chane Behanan and Russ Smith) did in a five-overtime Louisville/Notre Dame game on Feb. 9, 2013.\n\nHe's the first BIG EAST player to play 55 minutes or more without leaving the floor since DePaul's Will Walker played all 55 minutes vs. St. John's on March 5, 2010.\n\nScheierman is the second player in the country to play 55 minutes or more this season in a game, joining La Salle's Khalil Brantley at Temple on Nov. 29th.\n\nScheierman finished second in the BIG EAST with 38.0 minutes per game in conference action this winter. Take out two lopsided wins against DePaul and Georgetown when he played only 129 of a possible 160 minutes, and he averaged 39.6 minutes per league game.\n\nRoad Work\n\nCreighton's 79-57 win at Butler on Feb. 17th was its third road victory by 20 points or more this season, as the Jays have also dominated Nebraska (89-60) and DePaul (84-58) away from home.\n\nIt's the fifth time in program history that Creighton's had three such wins in a season, but just the second time in the last 30 years.\n\nMost 20+ Point Road Wins, Season, CU History\n\nGames Year Opponents\n\n3 1917-18 Trinity (IA), South Dakota, Parsons\n\n3 1963-64 Nevada, South Dakota, Miami (Fla.)\n\n3 1990-91 Cleveland St., Drake, Notre Dame\n\n3 2012-13 Nebraska, Missouri St., So. Illinois\n\n3 2023-24 Nebraska, DePaul, Butler\n\nBench Provides A Boost\n\nCreighton has won 36 straight games when scoring 17 or more bench points. That's the nation's longest streak since Baylor's streak of 48 games in a row from Nov. 5, 2019 - Jan. 8, 2022.\n\nStability Is Key\n\nOne reason for Creighton's extended run of success has been the continuity within its coaching staff. The Bluejays have had just two head coaches in the last 30 years, Dana Altman (1994-2010) and Greg McDermott (2010-Present).\n\nWith help from Elias Sports Bureau, here's a list of current \"Power 6\" schools to have a coach with 300 wins at that school, and their predecessor also had 300 wins at the school:\n\nSchool Former Coach Current Coach\n\nCreighton Dana Altman Greg McDermott\n\nKansas Roy Williams Bill Self\n\nMichigan State Jud Heathcote Tom Izzo\n\nPurdue Gene Keady Matt Painter\n\nNot Tired Yet\n\nSenior Ryan Kalkbrenner ranks 152nd nationally in minutes per game, averaging 33:45 per contest.\n\nThat ranks tops nationally among 7-footers, just ahead of Kansas All-American Hunter Dickinson (32:12).\n\nLast year while at Michigan, Dickinson (32:42) was narrowly ahead of Kalkbrenner (32:15) among minutes per game among 7-footers.\n\nNo player as tall as 7-foot-1 has averaged more than Kalkbrenner's current 33:45 average since USC's Evan Mobley (33:53) in 2020-21.\n\nMaking History\n\nBaylor Scheierman (26), Steven Ashworth (26), Trey Alexander (22) and Ryan Kalkbrenner (20) all scored 20 or more points against Butler on Feb. 2.\n\nIt was the first time since at least 1980 that Creighton has had four men score 20 or more points in the same game.\n\nThe 26 points were Creighton-highs for both Ashworth and Scheierman, though Scheierman scored 27 his next time out at Providence.\n\nCreighton was the first team nationally with four men to score 20 in the same game since March 5th, 2022 when North Carolina did it vs. Duke (Armando Bacot 23; Caleb Love 22; RJ Davis 21; Brady Manek 20).\n\nCreighton was the first BIG EAST school with four players with 20+ points since Syracuse vs. UConn in their famous six-OT thriller on March 12, 2009 (Jonny Flynn 34; Paul Harris 29; Eric Devendorf 22; Andy Rautins 20).\n\nIt was just the fifth time in 14 seasons under Greg McDermott that Creighton's had three men score 20+ in the same game, but second time in two weeks (also Jan. 20th at Seton Hall).\n\nIt was the first time that Creighton's had two men score 25 or more in the same game since Booker Woodfox (26) and P'Allen Stinnett (30) vs. New Mexico on Nov. 16, 2008.\n\nTwenty Is Plenty\n\nTrey Alexander owns 14 games this season with 20 points or more, while Baylor Scheierman has done it 14 times and Ryan Kalkbrenner on 10 occasions.\n\nIn 14 seasons under Greg McDermott, only Doug McDermott (3x), Marcus Foster (2x), Ryan Kalkbrenner and Marcus Zegarowski have also done that 10 or more times in an entire season.\n\nMost Games With 20+ Points, Season, Since 2005-06\n\n20+ Pts.

The only exception in that time came in 2014-15, when the Jays won nine times at home.\n\nCreighton also surpassed 200,000 total home fans for the season. It is the 18th time in the last 19 years that's happened. The only exception was the 2020-21 season that was impacted by COVID-19, which restricted crowds nationwide.\n\nYearly Pink Out Totals\n\nCreighton has raised $605,089.18 since the start of the 2011-12 season during its annual men's basketball Pink Out auctions, plus additional money collected on gameday, underwriting or matching donations.\n\n2011-12: $20,600\n\n2012-13: $24,444\n\n2013-14: $48,247.11\n\n2014-15: $16,384.03\n\n2015-16: $16,527.90\n\n2016-17: $26,361.64\n\n2017-18: $28,796\n\n2018-19: $19,595\n\n2019-20: $31,803.18\n\n2020-21: $40,381\n\n2021-22: $24,165\n\n2022-23: $27,432\n\n2023-24: $36,002.46\n\nAdditional Donations: $244,349.86\n\n13-Year Totals: $605,089.18\n\nPink Out Auction Raises $36,002.46\n\nWhen Creighton hosted DePaul on January 27th in its 14th Annual Pink Out game, Bluejay players wore pink shooting shirts and pink-trimmed jerseys for the game.\n\nFans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction.\n\nAll funds raised went to benefit American Cancer Society Hope Lodge Omaha, which provides a free home away from home for cancer patients and their caregivers who must travel to Omaha to receive their lifesaving treatment. More than just a roof over their heads, it's a nurturing community that helps patients access the care they need. This year Nebraska Cancer Specialists generously agreed to match all donations to Hope Lodge raised at the game, up to $30,000.\n\nThe annual Creighton Men's Basketball Pink Out game has raised over $605,089.18 (including the 2023-24 auction) benefiting the Hope Lodge facility in Omaha and the guests it serves.\n\nThis year's auction ran from Jan. 11-21 and raised $36,002.46, while the matching donation and in-game donations generated an additional $72,119.54.\n\nBelow is the final numbers for each jersey/item in the auction this year.\n\n#0 $945 #1 $2025 #2 $1050\n\n#4 $887 #5 $1725 #10 $870\n\n#11 $3600 #12 $847.46 #13 $2000\n\n#14 $872 #15 $2250 #23 $3650\n\n#32 $1005 #33 $1675 #41 $1825\n\n#55 $3150 Golf: $3250\n\nGreg McDermott's Shoes $935 Ball 1: $710\n\nBall 2: $710 Ball 3: $680 Ball 4: $655 Ball 5: $686\n\nMcDermott Among The Best\n\nGreg McDermott ranks tied for eighth in league history with 123 regular-season league wins.\n\nMcDermott, along with Ed Cooley and Pitino, are the only three active coaches with 100 regular-season BIG EAST wins. The list contains six different coaches who have won at least one national title.\n\nMcDermott has been at his current job (14 seasons) longer than any active BIG EAST coach, but since his first three years were as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference, Cooley's 13 years in the BIG EAST lead all active league coaches.\n\nMost League Wins, BIG EAST MBB Coaches\n\nRk.

He had also given CU a 90-89 lead with 55.6 left on a jumper.\n\nAlexander has been on the court for all 40 overtime minutes of each of Creighton's last five games to go beyond 40 minutes, and he's been excellent almost every time.\n\nHe's shot 10-for-18 from the field (.556), including 1-for-3 from three-point range (.333) while making 7-of-8 free throws (.875). Alexander also has two assists, two blocked shots and two steals in that span.\n\nAlexander has scored 28 of Creighton's 70 overtime points in those five contests.\n\nScheierman Makes Wooden Award Cut\n\nCreighton's Baylor Scheierman has landed a spot on the Midseason Top 25 for the John R. Wooden® Award presented by Principal®. Chosen by a poll of national college basketball experts, the list is comprised of 25 student-athletes who are the early front-runners for college basketball's most prestigious individual honor.\n\nThis year marks the seventh time in the past 13 seasons that Creighton is represented on the Wooden Award Midseason 25 list. Creighton's Doug McDermott won the Wooden Award following the 2013-14 season after also being a finalist in both 2011-12 and 2012-13. Maurice Watson Jr. was on the list of 25 in 2016-17 and Marcus Foster was among those listed a year later, as was Marcus Zegarowski in 2020-21. None of those three most recent men advanced to the final cut.\n\nThe only other BIG EAST players to make the Midseason Top 25 list are Tyler Kolek and Tristen Newton.\n\nSultan of Swat\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner ranks second in program history in blocked shots with 291.\n\nKalkbrenner has joined Benoit Benjamin as the only Bluejays with three different seasons of 60 or more blocks.\n\nKalkbrenner is just the seventh BIG EAST player since 1992-93 with three campaigns of 72 or more swats, joining Jason Lawson (4x) and Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje (3x), Chris Obekpa (3x), Emeka Okafor (3x), Hasheem Thabeet (3x) and Etan Thomas (3x).\n\nMost Creighton Blocked Shots, Since 1979-80\n\nBlk.

Per Basketball-Reference.com, that makes him one of just two players nationally since 2010-11 with more than 10 such contests, joining Weber State's Dillon Jones (25).\n\nOne other quirky stat about Scheierman? He owned 1,088 career rebounds in his first 145 career games. Those are the exact same numbers that Doug McDermott finished his college career with.\n\nMeet The Alexander's\n\nThough they're not related, the stats of Ty-Shon Alexander (2017-20) and Trey Alexander (2021-Present) are pretty similar. Ty-Shon played 98 games, while Trey has played in 103 contests.\n\nThat's a positive development considering that Ty-Shon was a First Team All-BIG EAST choice who helped Creighton to a share of the 2020 BIG EAST title and later played for the 2021 NBA runner-up Phoenix Suns.\n\nCareer Statistics\n\nName PTS REB AST BLK STL FG% 3FG% FT%\n\nTy-Shon 1241 360 222 22 91 .418 .372 .813\n\nTrey 1305 467 335 42 101 .445 .351 .821\n\nScheierman The Scorer?\n\nBaylor Scheierman is third in the BIG EAST Conference in scoring at 18.5 points per game, and has scored in double-figures every game but one this season.\n\nBefore being held to nine points on Jan. 6 vs. Providence, Scheierman had become just the third Creighton player in the last 25 seasons to score in double-figures each of the first 14 games of a year, joining Doug McDermott (all 35 games in 2011-12) and Marcus Foster (first 15 in 2017-18).\n\nThe fifth-year senior is aiming to become the first Creighton player to lead the BIG EAST in scoring since Doug McDermott in 2013-14. McDermott led the nation with 26.7 points per game en route to National Player of the Year accolades.\n\nKeep in mind that Scheierman has proven he can do way more than score. Two years ago at South Dakota State, Scheierman led the Summit League in the rare combination of both rebounds and assists.\n\nBiggest in the BIG EAST\n\nCreighton's average height of 78.56 inches puts the Bluejays as the nation's 11th-tallest team, and the biggest in the BIG EAST.\n\nThe second-tallest team in the BIG EAST is Connecticut, which ranks tied for 24th-biggest at 78.29 inches per player.\n\nJays Don't Foul...Do You Follow?\n\nCreighton leads the nation with just 11.3 fouls per game...let's take a minute to appreciate just how few that is.\n\nLipscomb is second-best at avoiding fouls, committing 12.9 per game.\n\nCreighton is the only team nationally that has not had a player foul out this season. Per Elias, Creighton's streak of 50 straight games without a foul out is the nation's longest since Purdue's streak of 50 straight games from March 1, 2022 - Nov. 28, 2023, with a 51-game streak by Colgate (Nov. 16, 2021 - Jan. 11, 2023) being the only other streak of 50+ since 2005-06.\n\nOnly two teams total (Nebraska and Alabama), have gotten into the bonus in the first half this season against Creighton.\n\nCreighton has committed three fouls or less in 15 different halves this year.\n\nCreighton has had more than nine fouls in just five halves (including OT) this season, which means its opponents have been in the double-bonus just four times.\n\nCreighton has allowed just 33 made free throws in a 1-and-1 situation all year, and just 12 made free throws in the double bonus all season (6 of those came in an overtime session). Only two of those free throws in a 1-and-1 situation came in the first half (vs. Alabama).\n\nHere's a look at how many fouls Creighton has been called for this season by half:\n\nCreighton Fouls By Half\n\nOpponent First Half Second Half\n\nFlorida A&M 4 5\n\nNorth Dakota State 1 3\n\nIowa 6 8\n\nTexas Southern 1 6\n\nLoyola (Chicago) 3 7\n\nColorado State 2 5\n\nOklahoma State 6 7\n\nNebraska 7 7\n\nCentral Michigan 3 2\n\nUNLV 5 5\n\nAlabama 9 7\n\nVillanova 5 4 (4 more in OT)\n\n#10 Marquette 5 11\n\nGeorgetown 4 6\n\n#23 Providence 5 6\n\nSt. John's 3 5\n\nDePaul 6 10\n\n#1 Connecticut 5 9\n\nSeton Hall 3 5 (6 more in 3 OT's)\n\nXavier 6 8\n\nDePaul 5 4\n\nButler 3 8\n\nat Providence 5 3 (6 more in OT)\n\nat Xavier 6 7\n\nGeorgetown 5 7\n\nat Butler 3 5\n\n#1 Connecticut 4 9\n\nat St. John's 2 10\n\nSeton Hall 6 10\n\n#5 Marquette 2 8\n\nat Villanova 3 3\n\nTotal 133 200 (16 more in OT)\n\nKalkbrenner's A Handful\n\nRyan Kalkbrenner swatted five shots on Dec. 16 at UNLV, then did it again on Jan. 17 at No. 1 UConn. He notched a career-high eight rejections on Feb. 25 at St. John's.\n\nThat's now 13 times in his Bluejay career that he's had five or more rejections. During his four years at Creighton, all his teammates have combined for one such game, a five-swat effort by Fredrick King last year in Las Vegas. Kalkbrenner is the only Creighton player with multiple games of five or more swats since the Bluejays joined the BIG EAST in 2013 as King, Jacob Epperson and Justin Patton have each done it once.\n\nKalkbrenner's 291 career blocked shots rank third among the nation's active players.\n\nIn January, Kalkbrenner had four or more blocks in four straight games, Creighton's longest such streak since Benoit Benjamin did it in an incredible 12 straight games from Jan. 12-, Feb. 20, 1985. The streak featured games of 8, 10, 5, 4, 7, 12, 6, 5, 5, 6, 4 and 4 blocks.\n\nAmong The Nation's Best\n\nBelow is where Creighton ranks nationally since the start of the 2010-11 season among teams to have played 100 or more Division I games, per Basketball-Reference.com.\n\n2010-11 to 3/10/24\n\nCategory CU Stat CU Rank\n\n3FG Made 4276 2nd\n\n2FG Percentage .550 3rd\n\nFG Percentage .477 4th\n\nAssists 7,698 6th\n\n3FG Percentage .374 6th\n\nFG Made 13,167 7th\n\nPoints 36,784 9th\n\nWins 323 23rd\n\nWinning Percentage .672 30th\n\nDon't Forget The Two's\n\nWhile attention tends to focus on Creighton's proficiency from three-point range, the Bluejays are also pretty efficient from inside the arc.\n\nThrough games of March 10, CU ranks third in the country in two-point percentage (.610) in 2023-24 and third-best nationally (.550) among Division I schools to have played 100 or more games since Greg McDermott's arrival in 2010-11.\n\nCreighton shot 26-for-32 (.813) from two-point range on Dec. 9 vs. Central Michigan, just the third time in Greg McDermott's 14 seasons at CU its converted on better than 80 percent of its two-point shots. The only better game was when it shot 22-for-26 (.846) in a March 2, 2013 win over Wichita State in CU's final regular-season game as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nCentury Mark\n\nCreighton's 109 point effort on Dec. 9 vs. Central Michigan was the 25th time under Greg McDermott that Creighton has scored 100 or more points.\n\nThat ranks third-most among all Power 5/BIG EAST teams nationally in that span, trailing only North Carolina (37) and Iowa (26).\n\nNo other BIG EAST team has cracked the century mark more than 13 times since 2010-11.\n\nGreg McDermott's teams at Northern Iowa (153 games) and Iowa State (127 games) never scored more than 100 points in any game.\n\nRoad Dubs\n\nBefore its Dec. 13 loss at UNLV, Creighton had started 2-0 on the road this season, doing so in impressive fashion in both games.\n\nOn Nov. 30 Creighton beat Oklahoma State 79-65, its second-biggest non-conference home loss since 1978.\n\nFour days later on Dec. 3, Creighton won 89-60 at Nebraska, handing the Cornhuskers their largest non-conference home loss since 1938.\n\nIt's the first time that Creighton has won its first two true road games since 2016-17, when the Jays won their first five road contests.\n\nIt's also just the 12th time in the last 50 seasons that CU has won each of its first two true road games. Ten of the 11 most recent teams to do so made the NCAA Tournament, and each won 20 or more games.\n\nStarted 2-0 Or Better On The Road, Last 50 Years\n\nRoad W's to Start Season Final W-L (Postseason)\n\n2 1976-77 21-7 (NCAA)\n\n2 1980-81 21-9 (NCAA)\n\n2 1998-99 22-9 (NCAA)\n\n3 1999-00 23-10 (NCAA)\n\n2 2002-03 29-5 (NCAA)\n\n4 2003-04 20-9 (NIT)\n\n2 2004-05 23-11 (NCAA)\n\n2 2011-12 29-6 (NCAA)\n\n4 2012-13 28-8 (NCAA)\n\n4 2013-14 27-8 (NCAA)\n\n5 2016-17 25-10 (NCAA)\n\n2 2023-24 TBD\n\nHe Does It All\n\nBaylor Scheierman owns 2,159 points, 1,215 rebounds, 568 assists and has made 343 career three-pointers in 158 total games when you combine his Creighton and South Dakota State stats.\n\nCreighton's only other players to reach 1,000 career rebounds (only at Creighton) have been Paul Silas (1,751), Bob Harstad (1,126), Doug McDermott (1,088) and Benoit Benjamin (1,005).\n\nIf you're curious, how many games it took to get to "
