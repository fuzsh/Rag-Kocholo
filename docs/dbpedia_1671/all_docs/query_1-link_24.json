        "text": "The Monday Mailbag has been a little less lengthy since the end of the Nevada basketball season, but we still squeezed almost 3,500 words out of this edition. Let's get to the questions. Thanks, as always, for the inquiries.\n\nTier VI\n\n11. Wyoming: I typically reserve SJSU for this spot, but this time it's Wyoming! As Christopher Turk (played by Donald Faison) used to say onScrubs,\n\nTier V\n\n10. San Jose State: SJSU is in a huge media market and has improved its on-field competitiveness in recent years, but that's a pro sports town where Cal and Stanford are afterthoughts. And with SJSU's only fit being the Pac-12, the conference would hardly want three schools within 50 miles of one another.\n\n9. Utah State: There are small towns in power conferences, but Logan barely breaks 50,000 citizens with Utah State ranking third in the Beehive State in cache behind Utah and BYU, and look how long it took BYU, with much stronger national brand, to get into a power conference.\n\n8. Nevada: The Wolf Pack's case is built on potential, but in the instant-gratification world of college athletics, that's not much of a sell. Reno isn't a top-100 market (it is No. 102), hasn't had enough high-level success in football and has facility and budget issues. Academically, it's not there, either. On the plus side, men's basketball has strong success over the last 20 years.\n\n7. New Mexico:Albuquerque has a top-50 television market, but it's on-field success, especially in football, hasn't been there. And the Lobos' budget has gone in the wrong direction, and believe it or not, budget does matter in realignment. Conferences don't want to add schools whose budgets are not robust.\n\nTier IV\n\n6. Fresno State: I personally do not see the appeal of Fresno State, but the Bulldogs' name has at least been bandied about when it comes to realignment, so I'll give them their own tier. It's a decently sized market, but there's not much more appeal than that. Football has generally been good, and softball and baseball have both won national titles, but the power-conference appeal is middling.\n\nTier III\n\n5. UNLV: Everybody likes to call UNLV a sleeping giant, but at some point that giant must wake up and do something. That's never been the case for Rebels football, and UNLV's basketball success is getting old and musty. Las Vegas offers a big (and expanding) television market that ranks 40th in the nation, and you'd add a new state for distribution. The facilities are solid. But the academics aren't great and the football program is an anchor in a city that cares more and more about pro sports.\n\n4. Colorado State: The Rams have poured a lot of money in their operation in an attempt to get into a power conference, which includes a $220 million football stadium that opened in 2017. CSU claims Denver, but the reality is Fort Collins is a small television market. The biggest issue is the revenue sports have been iffy on the field the last 15-20 years.\n\n3. Air Force: There's a certain appeal to a military school like Air Force, which has tied the Falcons to the Big 12 in years past. That's the only power conference that makes sense. Air Force football is generally strong, but men's basketball would be a drag. The Falcons have a big national fan base, good geographic location, strongacademics and aprestige element, but there's a limited on-field ceiling given the military and academic requirements.\n\nTier II\n\n2. Boise State: The Broncos' star has dimmed but this remains a good football program and an underrated one in men's basketball. The academics aren't ideal and the television market is barely top 100 (98th) with the school being isolated and away from the big cities in the Pacific Northwest. The facilities are solid and the brand among Group of 5 schools is elite. But Boise State's window to jump to a power conference, while not closed, has shrunk as its appeal as an elite football school has waned.\n\nTier I\n\n1. San Diego State: The Aztecs' run to the men's basketball national championship game was well timed and shows the enormous potential SDSU can bring to a power conference. SDSU is elite in one of the revenue sports (men's hoops) and solid in the other (football has averaged more than nine wins per season in the last 12 full years, reaching a bowl in each). It is in a top-30 television market with minimal pro-sport interference (just MLB's Padres) and gives a potential conference a foothold in SoCal. The budget is sizable, the facilities are strong (a new football stadium opened last year) and the academics are among the MW's best. I would add SDSU if I was the Pac-12 (or Big 12).\n\nYes. While a 2-10 record would be a disaster, I don't think Nevada would make a change based on two seasons. The minimum standard these days seems to be three years, barring scandal. It used to be four, but that timeline has sped up and Ken Wilson is working for an athletic director who didn't hire him, which always makes things a little more tenuous. Wilson's buyout is relatively small at just $1 million after this season ( ), but that's still a lot of money for the Wolf Pack. Given the situation Wilson inherited, firing him after two seasons— even if he went 4-20 in those seasons— would be premature. Ideally from Nevada's perspective, the Wolf Pack reaches a bowl this season to show it is making progress. Even a five-win season would be a step in the right direction. There are a lot of winnable games on the schedule in 2023. The only \"unwinnable\" game is the season opener at USC. You might toss the home game against an improved Kansas in there, too. But the remainder of the opponents are beatable. Expecting five wins isn't unrealistic.\n\nNot that short. I'd give him a hot-seat rating of three (out of 10) today, with 10 being the hottest. As noted above, barring some kind ofscandal, Wilson will get a third season. That said, it is a huge year for him and his team. Coaches typically get a pass for first-year struggles, and Wilson inherited as rough a roster as any first-year FBS coach last season. He deserved a pass for the first-year issues, although Nevada easily could have won five games last year— it could have beaten Colorado State, UNLV, Incarnate Word and San Jose State— so the Wolf Pack didn't squeeze everything out of its 2023 roster. If the Wolf Pack, with a better roster this year, goes 2-10 again, that's hugely problematic. The one-year pass is over, so progress must be shown or Wilson will be on the hot seat entering 2024. However, he's not there if the Wolf Pack wins five or six games this fall. If anything, last year's two-win season would make five wins this year look good, whereas if Nevada won five last year and five this year, it would look like a lack of progress. Last year set the bar pretty low to clear.\n\nFootball: 18,000 per game\n\nMen's basketball: 9,000 per game\n\nWomen's basketball: 2,000 per game\n\nBaseball: 1,000 per game\n\nThe closest program to that figure is men's basketball. The biggest issue is football, which probably drew 10,000 below that mark in actual attendance in 2022. The biggest potential revenue increaser for Nevada athletics comes at Mackay Stadium. We've seen Lawlor Events Center legitimately full on a regular basis. That's not been the case in the last 15 years of Nevada football, even in that historic 2010 season. Driving fans into Mackay Stadium is a must.\n\nDepends on whether you're talking about the last three open scholarships on next year's roster or generally speaking moving forward.\n\nSince Steve Alford became Nevada's head coach in April 2019, here's a breakdown of the Wolf Pack's scholarship allocation:\n\nHigh school signees: 11\n\nDivision I transfers: 12\n\nJuCo transfers: 1\n\nThat's basically a 50-50 mix of high school recruits and Division I transfers, which is the right mix in the Mountain West. You can't just stop recruiting high school kids. As for this year's final three remaining scholarships, I'd give two to D-I transfers and one to a high school kid, if that prep product warrants it (there's not a lot of great high school recruits remaining in the 2023 class). Nevada recently , and adding him makes a lot of sense. Nevada's top three backcourt players— Jarod Lucas, Kenan Blackshear, Hunter McIntosh— are all second-year seniors, so each will be gone after the 2023-24 season. Having a player likeRolison get mentored by them this season before playing big minutes next year is a strong selling point to Rolison if he's OK with limited minutes this year. But, overall, Nevada needs two impact transfers from its three remaining scholarships, and I'd define that as starting-level players after the Wolf Pack lost All-MW honorees Will Baker and Darrion Williams to the transfer portal this offseason.\n\nI'd agree the publicly discussed names among Nevada transfer targets thus far seem to be more bench players than starters. We'll see how things shake out in the end, but I do think the Wolf Pack needs some impact-level transfers who will play 20-plus minutes per game. Nevada has a nice six-player nucleus (Blackshear, Lucas, McIntosh, Tré Coleman, Nick Davidson, K.J. Hymes), but adding depth was an important goal this offseason after the Wolf Pack lacked that last year. Maybe Tyler Powell takes a step forward. We'll see whatMichael Folarin has to give. K.J. Hymes staying healthy for a full season would be big for Nevada, but the Wolf Pack can't bank on that given his health issues over the years. Nevada must replace two all-conference talents, so adding a couple of bench players wouldn't be ideal even though Nevada has a fairly solid starting five in place for 2023-24 already.\n\nIn terms of the MW's most improved team this offseason, . Boise State has added three quality players in Roddie Anderson III (from UC San Diego), Cam Martin (from Kansas) and O’Mar Stanley (from St. John's) to what was already a strong trio ofTyson Degenhart, Max Rice andChibuzo Agbo. Fresno State has swapped out guards Jemarl Baker, Anthony Holland, Jordan Campbell and Destin Whitaker for Xavier DuSell (from Wyoming), Enoch Boakye (from Arizona State) and Isaiah Pope (from Utah Tech), which is a small upgrade. Add them to center Eduardo Andre and it's a solid start, although a lot more work is required there. I really like New Mexico's addition of Iona forward Nelly Junior Joseph. He's the best MW transfer add thus far and balances out a roster that includes the star guard duo of Jamaal Mashburn Jr. and Jaelen House. SDSU also has retained all but one of its core players (Keshad Johnson hit the portal) while adding USC guardReese Dixon-Waters. So, I'd say Boise State and Fresno State are the big portal winners thus far, but I'll do a full rundown of that once we get to late May and the dust has settled.\n\nI'm no ameteorologist, but my forecast says you'll have the answer to that question within 48 hours.\n\nForecast noted above, but I do find it funny college players now must announce they're returning to school when they have remaining eligibility. That used to be taken for granted, but certainly times have changed. Lucas is currently practicing with the Wolf Pack this spring with the as a reason to renew season tickets. Those are good signs for the Wolf Pack.\n\nThe name was changed from \"Governor's Cup\" to \"Silver State Series\" a few years ago. That was around the time Brian Sandoval was termed out as governor after he created the series. Here are the all-time results of the Nevada vs. UNLV all-sport athletic competition.\n\n2013: UNLV 37.5, Nevada 10.5\n\n2014: UNLV 30, Nevada 18\n\n2015: UNLV 27, Nevada 21\n\n2016: UNLV 28.5, Nevada 19.5\n\n2017: Nevada 24, UNLV 24 (Wolf Pack won tiebreaker)\n\n2018: UNLV 27, Nevada 21\n\n2019: UNLV 34.5, Nevada 13.5\n\n2020: UNLV 13.5, Nevada 13.5 (Rebels won tiebreaker)\n\n2021: Nevada 24, UNLV 21\n\n2022: Nevada 30, UNLV 18\n\nUNLV leads the all-time series 7-3, but Nevada has won back-to-back Silver State Series. UNLV leads Nevada 18-6 this season with 21 more points to be awarded (three points each in baseball, women's golf, men's golf, women's tennis, men's tennis, outdoor track and field and APR). UNLV baseball leads Nevada 4-2 this season with the Wolf Pack a long shot to make the MW Tournament, so UNLV is essentially leading 21-6 with 18 points left. With UNLV also winning this year's tiebreaker (football), the Rebels only need to win one ofwomen's golf, men's golf, women's tennis, men's tennis, outdoor track and field and APR to clinch this year's Silver State Series. It's basically over. While it's nowhere near as prestigious as the Fremont Cannon, it's a cool competition to gauge which department is stronger on a yearly basis.\n\nGiven mid-major schools Florida Atlantic and San Diego State just reached the Final Four with the Aztecs playing for a national championship, I'd like to say the transfer portal has been beneficial for mid-majors in men's basketball. Obviously we need more years of transfer portal movement to get a data-driven answer. But I don't think it's a killer for mid-majors. NIL makes things more difficult, but the portal itself, if the NCAA upholds its rules of just one free transfer per player, could be a plus for mid-majors. Nevada could get transfers early in their careers who are then \"stuck,\" for the lack of a better term, with the Wolf Pack because a second transfer would require them sitting out a season. All this player movement also makes it hard for power-conference schools to hoard all of the good players for multiple years and build chemistry with them playing together. As I've pointed out many times, almost all of Nevada's good players over the last decade were transfers. These are players the Wolf Pack would not have gotten if not for transferring being allowed. I get that it's annoying for coaches and fans, but it's not going to be the death knell for mid-majors being Top 25 good.\n\nIn terms of football, I don't think it's a good thing for Group of 5 schools. Football teams could cost multiple millions of dollars to keep together, and Group of 5s don't have that money. And while mid-majors in basketball can pluck two of three good transfers and be nationally relevant, that's not the case in football. You need 15 to 20 good players to be elite in football (Nevada's 2010 team had 13 future NFL players plus that many who made rookie/training camps). It's harder to replace the attrition the transfer portal might bring in football than basketball.\n\nThe NBA, but that's largely because the team with the best player typically wins, which is why you see more dynasties in that sport. After the NBA, it's the NFL. After that, it's MLB. After that, it's NHL.\n\nOn second thought, I'd put college football atop the list, and I'm going to call that a pro sport since guys are being paid now. Each of the last six national champions in college football were the favorites entering the championship game. The only upsets since the College Football Playoffs began was Clemson beating Alabama in 2017 and No. 4 seed Ohio State winning in 2015. That's a pretty \"chalk\" sport. We'll see if that changes when the playoffs expand to 12 teams in 2024. Obviously the more rounds the more chance for upsets.\n\nI'd include Vin Scully and/or Tommy Lasorda, but if broadcasters and/or managers aren't allowed, Sandy Koufax, Jackie Robinson and Clayton Kershaw are locks. The fourth and final player is more difficult. It's a toss up between Don Drysdale, Pee Wee Reese, Duke Snider andRoy Campanella. I'd give the slight edge toDrysdale overCampanella, the only multiple-time MVP in Dodgers history (he won it three times). Also, hat tip to Franklin Stubbs. And Pedro Martinez would have been on this list ifLasorda didn't think Martinez was too small to pitch a heavy workload and advocated for trading him for Delino \"F'ing\" DeShields, who hit .246 with 15 homers in370 games with Los Angeles. Martinez, of course, went on to win three Cy Young Awards with seven top-four finishes post-Dodgers.\n\nWolf Pack players in the majors: TJ Friedl (Reds)\n\nOther locals in the majors:Garrett Hampson (Reno High/Marlins)\n\nWolf Pack players in minors:Miles Mastrobuoni (Triple-A Cubs);JoJo Romero (Triple-A Cardinals);Cal Stevenson (Triple-A Athletics, although he was just DFA’d); Trenton Brooks (Triple-A Athletics); Dillan Shrum (Double-A Royals); Ryan Anderson (Class-A Yankees); Owen Sharts (Class-A Pirates); Grant Ford (Class-A Pirates);Josh Zamora (Class-A Marlins)\n\nOther locals in the minors: Ray Kerr (Hug High/Triple-A Padres); Joe Wieland (Bishop Manogue/Triple-A Athletics); Christian Chamberlain (Reno High/Double-A Royals); Robby Snelling (McQueen High/Class-A Padres); Jace Avina (Spanish Springs High/Class-A Brewers); Connor Noland (Bishop Manogue High/Class-A Cubs); DJ Peters (WNC/Tigers organization, no affiliate yet)\n\nOther locals overseas:Drew Anderson (Galena High/Japan Western League); Cy Sneed (Elko High/Japan Eastern League)\n\nSpanish Springs High knuckleballer Mickey Jannis recently played in the Venezuelan League and Spanish Springs alum Jake Prizina pitched in Baltimore's organization last year but has not made a pro appearance this season. I'm sure I've missed somebody. If I have, let me know and I'll update this page.\n\nCody Bellinger: .769 OPS\n\nJason Heyward:.860 OPS\n\nThe Dodgers are paying a combined $720,000 for those two players. The Cubs are paying a combined$38.8 million for those two players. Cubbies definitely getting good value there.\n\n, but I think both proposals are dumb with the extra year of COVID eligibility being super, duper dumb. The transfer thing also is unnecessary. High schools are already stacking teams with players not zoned for their schools via programs. We need less stacking of teams at the high school level, not more, which would happen with free transfers.\n\nI have the Boston Bruins beating the Edmonton Oilers in the Stanley Cup Final. While I noted above the NHL is unpredictable, the Bruins have been overwhelming this season and should win the championship. Edmonton's defense is mediocre, but it led the NHL in scoring and has two amazing talents in Connor McDavid andLeon Draisaitl, who combined for 116 goals. My Kings get to play them in the first round for the second straight season. I hate these new NHL playoff seeding rules. Why can't we go back to 1 vs. 8; 2 vs. 7; 3 vs. 6; and 4 vs. 5 in the first round? If that were the case, the Kings would get the Dallas Stars. Much better.\n\nBefore the series began, I picked the Kings, in part because of the betting juice. They were around +300 despite being the No. 3 seed. I think the series goes seven games, and I don't think the Warriors win that one on the road. Golden State has been terrible on the road. Ultimately, the Warriors probably win the series, but I think it's a lot closer than the betting lines indicated before the series began. The Kings are a historically good offensive team. The defense isn't good and they have almost no playoff experience, so I get why the Warriors were favored. But De'Aaron Fox didn't seem to have any issue with a lack of postseason experience with his 38 points and five assists on13-of-27 shooting in the opener. But you're right it's going to be a fun series. Top first-round matchup along with the Knicks-Cavaliers. And the Western Conference is wide open this year.\n\nHandshakes after an NHL playoff series ends.\n\nMedal ceremonies at the Olympics while the national anthem of the gold-medal winner is played.\n\nDonning the green jacket on the 18th green after winning the Masters.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby's victorious horse getting to walk into the winner's circle.\n\nDrinking the milk after winning the Indianapolis 500.\n\nCutting down the nets and \"One Shining Moment\" playing after the NCAA basketball champion is crowned.\n\nThe Single-A Washoe Little League Dodgers getting post-game snacks after a solid unscored tie (I might be biased as this team's coach).\n\nThose are the things that immediately popped in my head in terms of postgame traditions. There are a lot of traditions before and in the middle of games that are cool, too (like ).\n\nBecause it activates one additional sense, that being smell. As written by :\n\n\"The answer actually lies in the aroma produced by pouring. Specifically, pouring your beer activates its carbonation, which manifests as the head of the beer. This head actually consists of millions of tiny bubbles that constantly pop as the beer sits, releasing hop oils and byproducts of fermentation—spices, alcohol, fusels, and more. All the popping releases a steady flow of flavor-augmenting aroma, which you inevitably inhale as you drink. That’s why beer aficionados are so keen for their beer to have the correctly-sized head — too much makes drinking a chore, while too little gives hardly any aroma.\"\n\nSo, in addition to taste and sight, you get smell and even a little sound when pouring a beer into a glass.\n\nI wear two pairs of socks every day. For most of my life, I also wore two white undershirts below a button up (I was able to downsize to one undershirt during the pandemic). And I also wore a mock turtleneck (I'd purchase them from Kmart) for the better part of six or seven years. I did away with those in 2013. But the two-pairs-of-socks thing seems to surprise people.\n\nThen please do not come to Reno, The Drunk Waitress. We will be just fine without you.\n\nSee y'all next week!
