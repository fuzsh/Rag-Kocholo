The tournament concluded with eight teams competing in the College World Series, a double-elimination tournament in its fifty fourth year. Sixteen regional competitions were held to determine the participants in the final event, with each winner advancing to a best of three series against another regional champion for the right to play in the College World Series. Each region was composed of four teams, resulting in 64 teams participating in the tournament at the conclusion of their regular season, and in some cases, after a conference tournament.[1] The fifty-fourth tournament's champion was LSU, coached by Skip Bertman. The Most Outstanding Player was Trey Hodges of LSU.\n\nBold indicates CWS participant.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLSU\n\nGeorgia Tech\n\nClemson\n\nHouston\n\nFlorida State\n\nArizona State\n\nStanford\n\nBold indicates winner. * indicates host.\n\nHosted by Texas at Disch–Falk Field in Austin, Texas\n\nArmy, Butler, and Wagner were making their first NCAA tournament appearance.[2]\n\nSchool Conference Record (conference) Head coach CWS appearances Best CWS finish CWS record\n\nNot including this year Clemson ACC 50–16 (17–7) Jack Leggett 8\n\n(last: 1996) 3rd\n\n(1996) 6–16 Florida State ACC 51–17 (15–9) Mike Martin 17\n\n(last: 1999) 2nd\n\n(1970, 1986, 1999) 23–34 Louisiana–Lafayette Sun Belt 47–18 (20–10) Tony Robichaux 0\n\n(last: none) none 0–0 LSU SEC 48–17 (19–10) Skip Bertman 10\n\n(last: 1998) 1st\n\n(1991, 1993, 1996, 1997) 25–13 San Jose State WAC 41–22 (n/a) Sam Piraro 0\n\n(last: none) none 0–0 Stanford Pac-10 47–15 (17–7) Mark Marquess 11\n\n(last: 1999) 1st\n\n(1987, 1988) 25–20 Texas Big 12 46–19 (19–10) Augie Garrido 27\n\n(last: 1993) 1st\n\n(1949, 1950, 1975, 1983) 64–47 USC Pac-10 43–18 (16–8) Mike Gillespie 19\n\n(last: 1998) 1st\n\n(1948, 1958, 1961, 1963, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1978, 1998) 72–22\n\nDate Game Winner Score Loser Notes June 9 Game 1 Clemson 10–6 San Jose State Game 2 Stanford 6–4 Louisiana–Lafayette June 10 Game 3 USC 6–4 Florida State Game 4 LSU 13–5 Texas June 11 Game 5 Stanford 10–4 Clemson Game 6 Louisiana–Lafayette 6–3 San Jose State San Jose State eliminated June 12 Game 7 LSU 10–4 USC Game 8 Florida State 6–2 Texas Texas eliminated June 14 Game 9 Louisiana–Lafayette 5–4 Clemson Clemson eliminated Game 10 Florida State 3–2 USC USC eliminated June 15 Game 11 Stanford 19–9 Louisiana–Lafayette Louisiana–Lafayette eliminated Game 12 LSU 6–3 Florida State Florida State eliminated June 17 Final LSU 6–5 Stanford LSU wins CWS\n\nThe following players were members of the College World Series All-Tournament Team.\n\nPosition Player School P Trey Hodges (MOP) LSU Jon McDonald Florida State C Beau Craig USC 1B Craig Thompson Stanford 2B Mike Fontenot LSU 3B Blair Barbier LSU SS Ryan Theriot LSU OF Joe Borchard Stanford Steven Feehan Louisiana–Lafayette Edmund Muth Stanford DH Brad Hawpe LSU\n\nClemson:\n\nFlorida State: Marshall McDougall\n\nLSU: Trey Hodges, Brian Tallet, Ryan Theriot, Mike Fontenot, Brad Hawpe, Brad Cresse, Ray Wright\n\nLouisiana–Lafayette: Scott Dohmann\n\nSan Jose State:\n\nStanford: Joe Borchard, Justin Wayne\n\nTexas: Beau Hale, Phil Seibel, Ryan Hubele, Tommy Nicholson, Todd West, Charlie Thames\n\nUSC: Mark Prior, Anthony Reyes"
