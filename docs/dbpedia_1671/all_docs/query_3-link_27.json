        "text": "SAN DIEGO DOWNTOWN LIONS INVITATIONAL H.S. BASEBALL TOURNAMENT\n\nFounded by Mike Morrow and Les Cassie, in 1951, The San Diego Downtown Lions High School Baseball Tournament is the Oldest and Largest High School Tourney in the United States. Traditionally held in the week between Palm Sunday and Easter, games are played for four days by 128-144 high school varsity teams at fields all over San Diego County. With over 8 divisions that cover all skill levels, we have teams ranked in the top 25 in the nation to teams that come from schools with less than 100 students. One national baseball publication ranked the San Diego Lions Tournament as the fourth best in the nation just behind the Boras Tourney and the National Invitational in South Carolina. MaxPreps ranked us Number 5 in the United States.\n\nLes Cassie played and coached Ted Williams in high school at San Diego’s Hoover High School. It has been reported that Williams only attended Hoover because he did not think he was good enough to play for Mike Morrow at San Diego High School. Cassie went on to replace Morrow at San Diego High when Morrow moved on to coach the University of San Diego baseball squad.\n\nAs the story goes, San Diego schools were having trouble funding teams to participate in spring break tournaments in Riverside, CA. and Los Angeles. Mike Morrow was a Lions Club member. He and Cassie asked the Downtown Lions club to fund various high school teams at the different tournaments. Since funding government entities were prohibited by the Lions club charter at that time, it was decided that the Lions Club would sponsor a tournament in San Diego.\n\nBack in 1951, the site of the current San Diego Convention Center was a U.S. Navy facility which housed recreation services and ferry services to transport sailors to ships anchored in the bay and to the various bases located in Coronado. Near the ferry dock were 4 pristine baseball fields known as Navy Fields. The Lions leased the four fields and held an 8 team tournament consisting of 8 local high schools: La Jolla, Pt. Loma, Grossmont, Sweetwater, San Diego, Hoover, University High School and St. Augustine.\n\nThe tournament grew through out the 1950's to end the decade with 24 teams from throughout the county. The 1960's brought the tourney up to 36 teams. There were 48 teams participating until the mid 1980's when out of town teams started to regularly attend. Under the leadership of Lions Jim Gordon, Bob Hinshaw, John Netterblad, Ray Hummel, Jim Rice and a host of others, the Lions tourney jumped to 80 - 88 teams by 1995. We cracked the 100 team mark around the turn of the century. Coaches Dick Serano at University High and John Baumgartner at Hilltop High lent expert assistance to the tourney in the area of seeding and scheduling. Mission Bay High and Cal State San Marcos Coach Dennis Pugh took over seeding and scheduling after the Serano and Baumgartner retired.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Bob Hinshaw, San Diego Superior Court Judge Peter Gallagher took the reins as tournament chairman in 2003. With assistance from Lions Charlie King, Charlie Silveria, Mike Hernacki, Sharon Mendenhall, Pam Wilmoth-Carlson, Jean Liuzzi, Ron Kempf, Jim Lagrone and a host of others, the tourney has morphed into a monster event with up to 144 teams from the western states depending on the availability of fields due to spring break. We play all of our games all over San Diego County at every high school field that is available. We have also held games in Imperial, Riverside, Orange and Los Angeles counties on occasion.\n\nWe have held our semi finals and finals at some of the best fields in San ‎Diego County....usually college fields, San Diego State, University of ‎San Diego, Pt. Loma Nazarene (great field on a bluff overlooking the ‎Pacific Ocean), Southwest College, Grossmont College, San Diego Community College and Mesa College. The college fields are contingent on ‎the schedules of the university teams. Sometimes they are ‎home...sometimes they are away.‎\n\nWe usually have 60% of the field from San Diego County. The other 40% ‎comes from both Northern and Southern California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Alaska ‎and sometimes back east. In the past few years we had teams from Virginia, Florida, Pennsylvania, New York and ‎Georgia.‎\n\nWe work really hard to make our divisions competitive. Depending on the ‎amount of teams... we have 8- 10 divisions. We try to match the best teams from San Diego with the ‎best teams from out of town. We have a coaches meeting to seed the ‎teams. We have contact with prep newspaper reporters in various cities,‎(Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Anaheim, Oakland-San Francisco) in ‎order to give us information about the various teams for seeding ‎purposes.‎ Other than the smallest Division, we usually have teams in the same conferences avoiding each other until the finals."
