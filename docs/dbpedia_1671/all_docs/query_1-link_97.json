        "text": "Men's Basketball 4/16/2013 5:02:00 PM\n\n2012-13 Creighton Men's Basketball Recap\n\n2012-13 Creighton Bluejays (28-8, 13-5 MVC) Men's Basketball Year-End Recap\n\nCreighton closed its 54th and final season as a member of the Missouri Valley Conference with a memorable year that included the program's first outright league title since 2001-02, a Valley-record 12th Tournament title, and wins in consecutive NCAA Tournaments for the first time during a campaign that saw the Bluejays finish 28-8 overall.\n\nReturning four starters and nine of its top 10 scorers from the 2011-12 team that went 29-6, expectations were at an all-time high entering the season. CU was ranked 15th in the preseason USA Today coaches poll and 16th by the Associated Press, both the highest preseason marks in program history. Add in the first preseason Associated Press All-American in MVC history (Doug McDermott) and record season ticket sales, and the most anticipated campaign in years brought forth considerable anticipation.\n\nThe season tipped off with a highly-anticipated game against Sun Belt Conference favorite North Texas, which featured potential NBA Lottery pick Tony Mitchell. In front of the largest opening day crowd in program history, Creighton throttled the Mean Green, 71-51, behind 21 points and 11 rebounds from McDermott.\n\nCreighton's second game was a 77-60 win over UAB, but required a big second half comeback to remain unbeaten. The Jays trailed by 11 points early in the second half before senior guard Josh Jones got loose. Jones scored 10 points in span of 1:17 to kick-start a game-ending 42-15 flurry.\n\nCU opened play in the 12th Annual Continental Tire Las Vegas Invitational with lopsided home wins over Presbyterian (87-58) and Longwood (105-57) before heading to Las Vegas for two marquee games. One night after Thanksgiving, it was the Bluejays stuffing 84 points on Wisconsin's vaunted defense to advance to the championship game of the event. In the finals, the Jays toppled Arizona State, 87-73, to claim the tournament championship. McDermott was named event MVP while Ethan Wragge joined him on the All-Tourney Team.\n\nWith a 6-0 start and coming off a big weekend, Creighton had a letdown and was beaten by an upstart Boise State team in the Mountain West-Missouri Valley Conference Challenge Series. Little did they know that the Broncos would be a Mountain West Conference contender and reach the NCAA's for the second time in 19 years.\n\nCreighton had a December to remember, playing six games against five eventual postseason qualifiers and not trailing in the second half of any of the wins. The beginning of the eventual season-long 11-game win streak started with a most-impressive 80-51 win over preseason Atlantic-10 favorite Saint Joseph's. Creighton avenged an 80-71 loss in Philadelphia a season ago with a hot start, bolting to a 45-13 lead before settling for a 47-20 halftime lead.\n\nThe Jays played their first true road game on December 6 with a 64-42 win at Nebraska, its first win in Lincoln since 2005. The win was overshadowed by a heart-related setback during pregame warm-ups from Jones, who fainted prior to the game and was hospitalized with an atrial flutter. Jones would stay in Lincoln overnight for additional testing, and hold an emotional press conference one week later where he and coach Greg McDermott discussed his health scare. Two weeks later Jones announced his “retirement” from the game, as the risk to continue playing was too much. Jones would remain around the team the rest of the season, garnering national attention to his plight, while also starring in a documentary “The Josh Jones Story” that came out on March 12th.\n\nThree days after topping Nebraska, the Jays would host eventual Mid-American Conference champion Akron in a Sunday afternoon game. Doug McDermott would score 20 of his game-high 30 points before half and finish the day with a career-best six three-point shots.\n\nCreighton then hit the road for a test at eventual NCAA participant California. Spurred by the defensive effort of Jahenns Manigat, the Jays held All-American guard Allen Crabbe into 6-for-26 shooting and never trailed in an eventual 74-64 win. The Jays then returned home for its final non-conference home game of the year against Tulsa. A career-high 21 points from Avery Dingman helped the Jays in a 71-54 win over the Golden Hurricane as CU closed out the pre-conference portion of the season with a 11-1 record.\n\nAfter a 10-day layoff, Creighton returned to action with the MVC opener vs. Evansville. CU overcame a triple-double by Purple Aces senior guard Troy Taylor in a 87-70 Bliuejay win.\n\nThe preseason MVC favorite Bluejays opened January with a trip to Normal, Ill., to take on second-place Illinois State. Creighton quieted a near-capacity crowd of 8,813 with a 79-72 win over Illinois State to improve to 13-1 overall and 2-0 in Valley action.\n\nCreighton returned home to beat Indiana State and Drake before getting a magical night from Doug McDermott in a 74-52 win on January 11th at Missouri State. McDermott scored 39 points on 15-of-19 shooting, making 14 straight attempts at one point and scoring all of CU's points in an 18-5 run to start the second half. The Jays would then topple Northern Iowa 79-68 on January 15th to set up a showdown with defending league champ, Wichita State.\n\nThe CU-WSU game lived up to the hype on ESPN2, but the Shockers emerged with a 67-64 win after the Jays missed a pair of tying three-pointers in the final 10 seconds. The loss was followed with another surprise setback at Drake, a team CU had beaten by 30 points just 15 days prior.\n\nCreighton would right the ship with an 81-51 win at Southern Illinois, its largest ever road victory in Valley play, on Jan. 27th. That win started a 3-0 stretch that also included triumphs over Missouri State and Bradley.\n\nCreighton would then suffer through a three-game losing streak that would drop CU out of the national polls for the only time all year. The Jays were defeated 76-57 at Indiana State before being upset at home by Illinois State on Feb. 9th and dropping a 61-54 game at UNI. That left the Jays with a 9-5 league mark and a game behind Wichita State in the league standings with just four conference contests to play.\n\nWith the season on the brink, Creighton would go to Evansville and fall behind 31-15 in the first 12 minutes. Just when things were looking dire, CU's maligned defense stepped up and go CU within five points at halftime of an eventual 71-68 victory that saw the Purple Aces miss a three-pointer at the horn. Highlighting the day was the play of Doug McDermott, who became the first junior in MVC history to reach 2,000 career points on the day. CU returned home with a win over Southern Illinois before falling at Saint Mary's in a nationally-televised BracketBusters showdown on ESPN.\n\nCreighton won its final road game, 80-62 at Bradley, and coupled with Wichita State's upset home loss to Evansville would find itself tied for The Valley lead heading into a winner-take-all showdown on March 2nd for the league's outright title. Doug McDermott would make 15-of-18 attempts on the day, scoring a season-high 41 points, in a masterful performance against the future Final Four qualifiers.\n\nCreighton rode that momentum to the MVC Tournament title, picking up wins over Drake, Indiana State and Wichita State en route to the MVC Tournament title. The win in the finals saw Creighton survive a three-point attempt by WSU's Malcolm Armstead bounce off the rim as CU swept the outright title and tournament crown for the first time since 1991. CU's fan base invaded St. Louis in record numbers, as an estimated 6,000 fans clad in blue packed Scottrade Center to cheer on their beloved Bluejays.\n\nThe Valley Tournament title clinched another NCAA Tournament bid for Creighton. The Jays would draw a No. 7 seed and be sent to Philadelphia to take on Cincinnati. Creighton won a physical game with clutch free-throw shooting and hard-nosed defense to pick up wins in back-to-back NCAA Tournaments for the first time in program history.\n\nCreighton faced Duke in the third round with a Sweet 16 berth at stake, but never got it going offensively in a 66-50 season-ending loss. The Jays had season-lows in points, field goal percentage (.302) and three-point percentage (.105), a stark contrast to the norm for one of the nation's most efficient offenses all season long.\n\nDoug McDermott led the Jays with 23.2 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. He repeated honors as a First Team All-American, Larry Bird MVC Player of the Year and MVC Tournament MVP among numerous other accolades. He set single-season school records with 834 points and 49.0 percent shooting from three-point range, while also becoming the program's all-time leading scorer with 2,216 career points.\n\nSeniors Gregory Echenique and Grant Gibbs were both named Honorable-Mention All-MVC. Echenique became the first Bluejay to earn a spot on three straight MVC All-Defensive Teams, pacing the Jays with 62 blocked shots while ranking second on the team with 9.7 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. Gibbs led the MVC in assists for a second straight year with 210 helpers (second-most in CU single-season history) while ranking third on the team in scoring (8.5) and rebounding (4.1).\n\nWragge (7.7 ppg.) would be named MVC Sixth Man of the Year and MVC Scholar-Athlete First Team after leading the team with 78 three-pointers in 36 games off the bench, while starting point guard Austin Chatman (7.4 ppg., 4.2 apg.) would earn the nod on the MVC's Most Improved Team.\n\nGreg McDermott finished his third season with an 80-30 record as Creighton head coach. He was runner-up for MVC Coach of the Year and shared NABC District 16 Coach of the Year honors. His 80 victories are easily the most in CU history after three years, and most by any Valley coach after three seasons in nearly 60 years.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKXSP (“AM 590 - Omaha's ESPN Radio”) will broadcast all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2012-13 season. T. Scott Marr and Nick Bahe called most of the action, while Ross Ferrarini and Brody Deren also handled analyst duties.\n\nWith the exception of the NCAA Tournament games, the audio was also webcast live at www.AM590espnradio.com.\n\nTelevision Broadcast Information\n\nCreighton had 31 games air on television in 2012-13, which does not include three exclusive ESPN3.com web-only broadcasts.\n\nCreighton had five games on KMTV and FSN Midwest, four games on ESPN2, three games on NET, ESPNU, Cox 2, two games on CBS, and one game each on WAQE, Pac-12 Network, WTWO, KWWL, TBS and ESPN.\n\nChase Williams and Nick Bahe served as the KMTV broadcast team.\n\nVideo Webcast Information\n\nCreighton continued to provide a subscription-based video webcast system for several games in 2012-13. Many other games were streamed free of charge as part of the ESPN3 or NET Sports webcast package, as well.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season had free live stats, the third year Creighton teamed with StatBroadcast Systems.\n\nHome games could also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nUpdates were also provided on the athletic department's Twitter page (@gocreighton).\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) finished his third season as head coach at Creighton. He led CU to a 28-8 mark this year, and is now 80-30 with the Bluejays. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 360-225 after 19 seasons and is 229-161 in 12 Division I campaigns. McDermott was assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Steve Merfeld.\n\nMcDermott is 2-4 as a Division I head coach in the NCAA Tournament, having lost five-point games as Northern Iowa's head coach in 2004 (vs. Georgia Tech), 2005 (vs. Wisconsin) and 2006 (vs. Georgetown), and going 1-1 each of the last two seasons in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nHe also made two NCAA Tournament appearances as a Division II head coach at Wayne (Neb.) State in 1999 and 2000. His 2000 team reached the Sweet 16.\n\nPostseason x 16\n\nCreighton has made the postseason in 16 consecutive seasons, the longest streak of postseason bids in MVC history.\n\nThe only eight schools to make the postseason in each of the last 16 years (including this year) are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nPostseason Win Streak\n\nThanks to an NCAA Tournament win over Cincinnati, the Creighton men's basketball team has now won a postseason game in a school-record six straight seasons. The previous mark was three in a row from 1962-64.\n\nThe following five programs are the only ones that have won a postseason game in six straight seasons, including 2012-13: Creighton, Kansas, North Carolina, Purdue and Syracuse.\n\nNCAA Tournament History\n\nCreighton made its 18th NCAA Tournament appearance, and ninth in the last 15 years, this March. The Bluejays are now 11-19 all-time in NCAA action, including an 8-10 record in its first game. In 26 NCAA or NIT appearances, Creighton has never won consecutive games in the same event.\n\nTournament Titles Help\n\nOnly nine teams in the March 11 edition of the Associated Press top-25 poll went on to win their conference tournament title, an elite group that included Creighton, Gonzaga, Louisville, Kansas, Miami (Fla.), Ohio State, New Mexico, Memphis and Saint Louis.\n\nSince 2004, seven of the 10 teams that won a national title, first won their league tournament title. The only exceptions came in 2005 and 2009, both years that North Carolina won the national title, as well as last season (Kentucky).\n\nRepeat Tournament Titles\n\nOnly 10 teams won the same conference tournament title both this season and last year. That list consists of Creighton (MVC), Louisville (Big East), Montana (Big Sky), Memphis (C-USA), South Dakota State (Summit), New Mexico (MWC), Long Island (Northeast), Western Kentucky (Sun Belt) and New Mexico State (WAC).\n\nOf those 10 schools, the only three to win an outright regular-season title this year as well were Creighton, Memphis and Montana.\n\nHistory As An No. 7 Seed\n\nCreighton was a No. 7 seed for the first time in history. It was Creighton's second-best seed ever, trailing only the No. 6 seed in 2002-03.\n\nSince the NCAA began seeding all the teams in 1979, MVC teams are now 5-4 as the seventh seed, including a 4-0 mark in their first game. The MVC's last previous No. 7 seed, Wichita State in 2006, reached the Sweet 16.\n\nSince 1985 (including 2013), the No. 7 seed is 70-46 against No. 10 seeds in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nNineteen different teams seeded No.7 have made the Sweet 16 since 1985, most recently Florida (who played its first two games in Omaha) last season.\n\nNationally, teams seeded No. 7 have combined for three or more wins in each of the last three years (including 2013).\n\nCreighton's NCAA Tourney Seeds\n\n(since seeding began in 1979)\n\nYear Seed Record\n\n2013 7th 1-1\n\n2012 8th 1-1\n\n2007 10th 0-1\n\n2005 10th 0-1\n\n2003 6th 0-1\n\n2002 12th 1-1\n\n2001 10th 0-1\n\n2000 10th 0-1\n\n1999 10th 1-1\n\n1991 11th 1-1\n\n1989 14th 0-1\n\n1981 8th 0-1\n\nFrom 7 Seed To Sweet 16, Since 1985\n\nYear Team NCAA Record\n\n2012 Florida 3-1\n\n2008 West Virginia 2-1\n\n2007 UNLV 2-1\n\n2006 Georgetown 2-1\n\n2006 Wichita State 2-1\n\n2005 West Virginia 3-1\n\n2004 Xavier 3-1\n\n2003 Michigan State 3-1\n\n2001 Penn State 2-1\n\n2000 Tulsa 3-1\n\n1993 Western Kentucky 2-1\n\n1993 Temple 3-1\n\n1992 Georgia Tech 2-1\n\n1990 Virginia 2-1\n\n1990 Alabama 2-1\n\n1988 Vanderbilt 2-1\n\n1986 Navy 2-1\n\n1986 Iowa State 2-1\n\n1985 Alabama 2-1\n\nAgainst NCAA Opponents\n\nCreighton went 6-4 against teams that made the 2013 NCAA Tournament. The Jays were 1-0 against Cincinnati, Wisconsin, Akron and Cal, 2-1 against Wichita State, and 0-1 against Duke, Saint Mary's and Boise State.\n\nCreighton also went 4-1 against NIT qualifiers (wins vs. Saint Joseph's, Arizona State and two over Indiana State), 1-0 vs. CBI teams (Tulsa) and 5-1 vs. CIT teams (two wins vs. Bradley and Evansville, one win vs. UNI).\n\nSweet Valley Success\n\nSince 1994, the MVC is 27-38) in the NCAA Tournament with nine Sweet 16 trips and one Final Four to its credit.\n\nMVC in the NCAA's, Since 1994\n\n(Sweet 16 trips in bold; Final Four in ALL CAPS)\n\nYear Teams NCAA Record\n\n1994 Southern Illinois, Tulsa 2-2\n\n1995 Southern Illinois, Tulsa 2-2\n\n1996 Bradley, Tulsa 0-2\n\n1997 Illinois State 0-1\n\n1998 Illinois State 1-1\n\n1999 Creighton, Evansville, Missouri State 3-3\n\n2000 Creighton, Indiana State 0-2\n\n2001 Creighton, Indiana State 1-2\n\n2002 Creighton, Southern Illinois 3-2\n\n2003 Creighton, Southern Illinois 0-2\n\n2004 Southern Illinois, UNI 0-2\n\n2005 Creighton, UNI, Southern Illinois 1-3\n\n2006 Bradley, UNI, So.

Creighton had the ball in a tie game with the shot clock off, but committed a backcourt violation on Oregon's “unique” floor. The Ducks' E.J. Singler then banked in a game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds left. A desperation three-pointer by Creighton was off the mark.\n\nIn 2009, Creighton rallied from a 14-point deficit and would hang on to beat Bowling Green, 73-71 in the first round of the NIT. The Jays needed a last-second defensive stand, as BGSU's Darryl Clements' game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.\n\nThe following game, Creighton led Kentucky by one with 36 seconds left, only to miss two free throws and see UK All-American Jodie Meeks convert a three-point play. CU's Booker Woodfox, the nation's No. 2 three-point shooter, missed an open trey as time expired, and Creighton lost 65-63.\n\nIn 2008, Creighton rallied from a 12-point deficit in the final 3:07 to top Rhode Island, 73-72, in the first round of the NIT. Cavel Witter hit the game-winner with 3.2 seconds left to give CU its first lead of the game since 3-0.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton had the ball for a final shot in a tie game against Nevada in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Nate Funk's shot attempt missed, and a tip-in try was also not converted. The Jays would eventually lose 77-71 in overtime.\n\nIn second round of the 2006 NIT, Miami (Fla.) guard Guilermo Diaz drained a free throw with 2.6 seconds left to beat Creighton 53-52. A last-second shot attempt by Bluejay senior Johnny Mathies was knocked out of his hands.\n\nIn the 2005 NCAA Tourney, Nate Funk had his three-point try with seven seconds left blocked by Tyrone Sally, and Sally raced downcourt for a breakaway dunk with 2.4 seconds left to give West Virginia a 63-61 win. Funk's three-point try from the corner missed at the buzzer.\n\nIn 2004, Creighton fell 71-70 to Nebraska in the NIT. The Jays led nearly the entire second half before NU's go-ahead basket with 12 seconds left. Nate Funk's game-winning jumper from 18-feet away was blocked by Husker guard Jake Muhleisen.\n\nIn 2003 Creighton lost 79-73 to Central Michigan in the NCAA's. The Jays trailed 50-24 with 16:24 left but a furious rally got them within two points (72-70) with 1:20 left, only to turn it over the next three possessions.\n\nIn the 2002 NCAA's, Creighton beat #15 Florida, 83-82, in Chicago. Terrell Taylor hit a game-winning trey with 0.2 seconds left in double-overtime, his final three of 28 points after a scoreless first half.\n\nBCS Busters, Again\n\nCreighton has gone 9-2 in the past two seasons vs. teams from BCS conferences with wins this year over Cincinnati (Big East), Wisconsin & Nebraska (Big Ten) and Arizona State and Cal (Pacific-12). Last year Creighton defeated Alabama (SEC) as well as Big 10 foes Nebraska, Northwestern and Iowa, losing only to North Carolina (ACC) in the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIn those 11 games, All-American Doug McDermott has averaged 25.0 points and 8.6 rebounds, well above his career averages (20.1 ppg., 7.7 rpg.), as seen below:\n\nMcDermott vs. BCS Schools, Last 2 Years\n\nDate Opponent Pts.

Including 2013, six of the nine times Creighton has entered NCAA action with a streak of five or more wins, it has won its first game.\n\nCreighton Streaks Entering NCAA's\n\nStreak Entering NCAA's Year NCAA Record\n\nWon 9 1961-62 2-1\n\nWon 8 2004-05 0-1\n\nWon 7 1990-91 1-1\n\nWon 7 2011-12 1-1\n\nWon 6 1998-99 1-1\n\nWon 5 2012-13 1-1\n\nWon 5 1999-00 0-1\n\nWon 5 1980-81 0-1\n\nWon 5 1963-64 1-2\n\nFather/Son Duos\n\nAccording to the website CollegeHoopedia.com, Doug McDermott is just the sixth man in NCAA history to be named conference player of the year while playing for his father.\n\nJoining them on that elite list are Dick/Mark Acres (Oral Roberts), Dick/Tony Bennett (UW Green Bay), Homer/Bryce Drew (Valparaiso), Press/Pete Maravich (LSU) and Clifford/C.J. Reed (Bethune-Cookman).\n\nBelow is a list compiled by ESPN.com of most points scored by a guy playing for his dad:\n\nName, School Points Father\n\nPete Maravich,LSU 3,667 Press\n\nAllan Houston, Tennessee 2,801 Wade\n\nTony Bennett, UWGB 2,285 Tony\n\nDoug McDermott, Creighton 2,216 Greg\n\nBryce Drew, Valparaiso 2,142 Homer\n\nJohn Nelson, Portland State 2,123 Sharkey\n\nMcDermott In The Postseason\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott made his third postseason appearance at Creighton, and fifth overall as a Division I head coach when you include his time at Northern Iowa.\n\nMcDermott's Division I teams own a 6-7 record in five previous postseason appearances, including a 6-4 mark at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott's Division I Postseason Appearances\n\nYear Tourney Postseason W-L\n\n2003-04 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2004-05 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2005-06 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2010-11 (CU) CBI 4-2\n\n2011-12 (CU) NCAA 1-1\n\n2012-13 (CU) NCAA 1-1\n\nRepeat All-American\n\nDoug McDermott joined some elite company by being named a First Team All-American by the USBWA, Associated Press and the NABC for a second consecutive season.\n\nHe is the 70th player to repeat the honor from by the USBWA, 55th from the NABC, and 51st in the history of the Associated Press.\n\nMVC Tournament Recap\n\nCreighton won its second straight MVC Tournament title, avenging regular-season defeats to Drake (65-53), Indiana State (64-43) and Wichita State (68-65) en route to the crown.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, the Jays trailed for a total of 48 seconds, all in the first half, during the three wins.\n\nDoug McDermott led the Jays with 62 points on the weekend and earned Most Outstanding Player honors for a second straight year. Gregory Echenique was also named to the MVC's All-Tourney Team.\n\nSpeaking Of All-Tourney\n\nCreighton had two men named to the All-Tournament Team at Arch Madness, MOP Doug McDermott and Gregory Echenique.\n\nMcDermott averaged 20.7 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, shooting 64.3 percent from three-point range.\n\nEchenique averaged 10.0 points, 8.3 rebounds and 4.3 blocks in three games while shooting 63.2 percent from the floor.\n\nThe duo, who were also named to the 2012 MVC All-Tournament Team, are Creighton's first duo honored more than once since Kyle Korver and Brody Deren earned the honors both in 2002 and 2003.\n\nHere's To History\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott is the only head coach in league history to win a Valley Tournament title at more than one school, having earned one at UNI (2004) and two at Creighton (2012 and 2013).\n\nWhen McDermott won his first title in 2004 at Northern Iowa, it made him the first coach in league history to win an MVC Tournament title at his alma mater (class of 1988).\n\nEight Out Of 15 Tourney Titles\n\nCreighton owns eight league tournament titles in the last 15 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Gonzaga (11), Duke (10), Winthrop (9) and Creighton (8).\n\nCreighton's 12 all-time Valley Tournament titles are more than twice as many as the next closest school, Southern Illinois (5).\n\nGentleman And A Scholar\n\nEthan Wragge earned a spot on the MVC Scholar-Athlete First Team, the first Bluejay to earn that honor since Anthony Tolliver in 2006-07.\n\nWragge owns a 3.22 GPA in Finance, Marketing and Entrepreneurship and hails from Eden Prairie, Minn.\n\nDefense Comes Up Clutch!\n\nCreighton's oft-maligned defense stepped up in the MVC Tournament, helping to carry Creighton to a title.\n\nThe Jays held three foes to 53.7 points per game, as those teams shot a collective 32.4 percent from the floor and 25.5 percent from three-point range.\n\nOur Coach Can Dunk\n\nCreighton head coach Greg McDermott was a 6-foot-8 center in his playing days at Northern Iowa in the late 1980's, but that doesn't mean he still can't play.\n\nMcDermott threw down a dunk in at the team's practice in St. Louis on March 7th, something he's done every year of his coaching career, and something he hopes to be able to do until he reaches age 50 in two years.\n\nMcDermott's three dunks at Creighton (one every year he's coached there) give him just seven less slams than his son Doug in 110 career games as a Bluejay.\n\nThe video has already received more than 11,000 hits on YouTube. To watch McDermott's dunk, go to http://youtu.be/31XFCD5TpdQ.\n\nHall of Fame Weekend For Bob Portman\n\nBob Portman entered the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame on March 8.\n\nPortman played for Creighton from 1966-69 and averaged 24.6 points and 12.9 rebounds per game during his college career.\n\nPortman owns the Creighton records for single-game scoring (51), single-season scoring average (29.5) and career scoring average (24.7). He is also fourth for points in a season (738) and ranks fifth in career points (1,876), rebounds (979), free throws (382) and field goals made (747).\n\nPortman was honored by the MVC as an “Institutional Great” since he never played in the MVC due to Creighton's independent affiliation at the time.\n\nJoining Portman in the 16th MVC Hall of Fame class was officials coordinator Jim Bain, Wichita State's Darren Dreifort, UNI's Molly O'Brien and Evansville's Krissy Meek-Engelbrecht.\n\nBack-to-Back Tourney Champs\n\nCreighton won back-to-back MVC Tournament titles for the third time in program history. CU also won the 1999 & 2000 crowns, as well as the 2002 & 2003 titles.\n\nChampionship Duo\n\nCreighton is one of 11 schools that won a conference tournament championship, as well as an outright regular-season league title, this year.\n\nThat elite group consists of New Mexico, Miami (Fla.), Saint Louis, Gonzaga, Memphis, Belmont, Valparaiso, Bucknell, Davidson, Montana and Creighton.\n\nIt's just the fourth time in program history that the team won an outright regular-season and MVC Tournament title, having also done it in 1978, 1989 and 1991.\n\nChampionship Duo, Men & Women\n\nCreighton is one of seven schools that won a regular-season conference title in both men's and women's basketball this year.\n\nThat elite group consists of Montana (Big Sky), Akron (Mid-American), Texas Southern (Southwestern Athletic), South Dakota State (Summit), Middle Tennessee (Sun Belt), Gonzaga (West Coast) and Creighton (Missouri Valley).\n\nMcDermott Named MVC Player of the Year\n\nLast year Doug McDermott became the first sophomore in league history to be named Larry Bird MVC Player of the Year. This year, he became the eighth player in league history to repeat the award, joining an illustrious list that includes Junior Bridgeman, Larry Bird, Lewis Lloyd, Xavier McDaniel, Hersey Hawkins, Kyle Korver and Darren Brooks.\n\nMcDermott led The Valley and ranked second nationally with 23.2 points per game. He was also top-six in the MVC in rebounding, field goal percentage, three-point percentage, free-throw percentage, three-pointers made and defensive rebounds.\n\nMcDermott's honor gives Creighton seven MVC Player of the Year awards, one more than Bradley and Southern Illinois for most all-time.\n\nLast year he became the second player in MVC history to be named both MVC Freshman of the Year (2011) and MVC Player of the Year (2012 and 2013), joining Southern Illinois' great Ashraf Amaya (1990 FOY and 1992 POY).\n\nRepeat Complete\n\nDoug McDermott joined some elite company by duplicating his Most Outstanding Player award from last year's MVC Tournament.\n\nIn league history, only Creighton's Kyle Korver (in 2002 & 2003) has previously won multiple MOP trophies at the MVC Tournament.\n\nMcDermott (in both 2012 and 2013) joined Adam Emmenecker (2008), Kyle Korver (2002 and 2003), Chris Carr (1995) and Hersey Hawkins (1988) as players to be named Most Outstanding Player in the same season they've earned MVC Player of the Year accolades.\n\nMaking History\n\nDoug McDermott scored 21 or more points in 26 of the season's 36 games, becoming Creighton's all-time career scoring leader in the process, with 2,216 career points to also rank eighth in MVC history.\n\nAll-Time Creighton Scoring Leaders\n\nRk.

Xavier McDaniel, Wichita State 2,152\n\n40 Point Man\n\nDoug McDermott had a season-high 41 points in a regular-season finale victory vs. Wichita State on March 2nd.\n\nLeaguewide since 1996-97, there have been just eight games of 40 or more points by one player. McDermott is the only player with multiple games of 41 or more, and Illinois State legend Tarise Bryson (1999-2001) is the only other man with two games of 40+.\n\nOf the 40-point outings, it's interesting to note that three of those performances have come on a Creighton Senior Night since 2008 (Cavel Witter's 42 in 2008, Colt Ryan's 43 in 2012, McDermott's 41 on March 2, 2013).\n\nMcDermott, who also had 39 points at Missouri State on Jan. 11, was the nation's only player with 39 points or more in multiple games this season.\n\nNot Half Bad\n\nDoug McDermott's highest scoring half of his career has been 31 points, done last year in the second half at Bradley when he scored a career-best 44 points.\n\nMcDermott has scored 15 points or more in a half 44 times during his career, and Creighton is 37-2 in those contests (five times he's scored 15 or more in both halves).\n\nMcDermott owns eight halves in his career with 20 or more points, and just six scoreless halves.\n\nFilling It Up\n\nEthan Wragge was third in the MVC with 78 three-pointers made this season, giving him 224 in his career. That places him third in Creighton history.\n\nEach of the other four men in Creighton history with 200 or more three-pointers were named MVC Tournament Most Outstanding Player at some point in their careers.\n\nMost 3FG Made, Career\n\n3FG Name Years\n\n371 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n245 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n224 Ethan Wragge 2009-Pres.\n\n212 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n200 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\nStraight Shooters\n\nCreighton shot 70.2 percent on March 2nd in a win vs. Wichita State. It was the sixth-best performance nationally this season, and best in the MVC. Next best in the league was a 65.6 percent performance by UNI vs. Wartburg.\n\nLast season Creighton shot 70 percent or better twice, including a league-record 77.5 percent marksmanship at Southern Illinois.\n\nPrior to the Jays doing it twice last year, no MVC team had shot 70 percent in any contest since Jan. 10, 2009.\n\nVote Doug!\n\nDoug McDermott was a finalist for the Lou Henson National Player of the Year, an award that collegeinsider.com hands out to the nation's top mid-major player.\n\nFans could vote for McDermott at VoteLouHenson.com.\n\nChampionship History\n\nCreighton claimed its 15th MVC regular-season title in program history this year, matching Oklahoma State for most in league history.\n\nThis year's outright title was the team's eighth overall, and first since 2000-01.\n\nCU's current haul of 15 regular-season titles is more than twice as many as any other current league foe (Wichita State, 7 outright, 0 shared; Southern Illinois, 4 outright, 3 shared).\n\nCU previously won outright crowns in 1990-91, 1988-89, 1977-78, 1942-43, 1940-41 and 1931-32. Only Oklahoma State (11) and Kansas (10) own more outright MVC titles than Creighton.\n\nCreighton owns seven shared titles as well, most recently in 2008-09. CU also shared titles in 2001-02, 1941-42, 1935-36, 1934-35, 1930-31 and 1929-30. Creighton's seven shared titles are three more than any other team (Oklahoma State, 4).\n\nCreighton also owns a record 12 MVC Tournament titles all-time, including 2013. The Jays also won the Valley Tournament in 2012, 2007, 2005, 2003, 2002, 2000, 1999, 1991, 1989, 1981 and 1978.\n\nMVC History - Most Regular-Season Titles\n\n15 - Creighton, Oklahoma State\n\n7 - Southern Illinois, Cincinnati, Wichita State\n\n6 - Bradley, Louisville, Tulsa, Drake\n\nSenior Day Honored Five\n\nCreighton honored five men in its March 2 Senior Day; Gregory Echenique, Taylor Stormberg, Josh Jones, Grant Gibbs and Joe Kelling.\n\nDuring the past four years, the Jays went 98-46 while appearing in the postseason every season and claiming the 2012-13 MVC regular-season title and 2012 and 2013 MVC Tournament titles.\n\nHe Can Play In Peoria\n\nDoug McDermott had his third straight dominating effort at Carver Arena on Feb. 27th, finishing with 32 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nAs a freshman, McDermott had 19 points and a career-high 17 rebounds at Bradley. Last season, he scored a career-best 44 points versus the Braves.\n\nMcDermott is averaging 31.7 points and 12.3 rebounds per game in three career games at Bradley. In the past two years, he's made 30-of-40 field goal attempts.\n\nThe Distributor\n\nGrant Gibbs led the MVC in assists for a second-straight season, something that hadn't been done since Illinois State's Jamar Smiley topped The Valley in three straight campaigns from 1995-98.\n\nGibbs 210 assists are second-most in Creighton single-season history, most by any Bluejay since 1973-74.\n\nGibbs is the only man in Creighton history with multiple seasons of 170 assists or more.\n\nThe 800 Club\n\nCreighton junior Doug McDermott led the nation with 834 points this season after owning a league-high (and second-most nationally) 801 a year ago.\n\nMcDermott joined Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird as the third player in MVC history with multiple 800-point seasons.\n\nNationwide, McDermott was the first player with consecutive seasons of 800 points or more since Stephen Curry (Davidson) and Lester Hudson (Tennessee-Martin) in both 2007-08 and 2008-09.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton attracted six of its nine largest home crowds in program history this season, which included sellouts in seven of the last eight home games. Here's a look at Creighton's top-15 home crowds all-time.\n\nRank Att.

He will be the only newcomer to the committee for the 2013-14 academic year, replacing current chair Mike Bobinski.\n\nPretty Good Stretch\n\nCreighton owns 57 wins in the last two seasons, 80 wins in the past three seasons and 98 wins during the last four years.

The only other MVC school with five league road wins was Wichita State (5-4).\n\nEach of the last seven times Creighton's made the NCAA Tournament (including this year), it's been 5-4 or better on the road in Valley play.\n\nComparing Teams\n\nLast season Creighton had one of the nation's most effective and most efficient offenses. With all but one regular from that squad back, we thought we'd take a second to compare the 2011-12 and 2012-13 teams:\n\nStat 2011-12 2012-13\n\nRecord 29-6 28-8\n\nFG Made 975 942\n\nFG% .504 .501\n\n3FG Made 287 307\n\n3FG% .424 .414\n\nFT Made 535 489\n\nFT% .726 .759\n\nRebound Margin +5.5 +4.6\n\nAssists 616 609\n\nTurnovers 421 443\n\nScoring Average 79.2 74.4\n\nScoring Defense 69.7 63.2\n\nScoring Margin +9.5 +11.3\n\nRacing Past 2,000 Points\n\nAfter not having a player surpass 2,000 career points since 2003, the MVC had two players do it in the span of six days in February. Evansville's Colt Ryan did it on Feb. 10th vs. Drake in his 117th career contest, and Creighton's Doug McDermott did it against Evansville on Feb. 16th in his 101st career game.\n\nBelow is a list of the all the players in MVC history to 2,000 career points, the quickest MVC players to reach 2,000 points, and a listing of the nation's players since 1995-96 to reach 2,000 career points in 101 career games or less, and some other notable players nationwide who reached 2,000 career points with how long it took them to reach the milestone.\n\nAll-Time MVC Scoring Leaders\n\nRk.

It previously happened in 1984-85 (Steve Harris & Xavier McDaniel), then again in 1998-99 (Rodney Buford & Marcus Wilson).\n\n-The Feb. 16, 2013 match-up between Colt Ryan (Evansville) and Doug McDermott (Creighton) marked the first time since March 1, 1999 that two players in the faced each other as members of the 2,000 point club. That match-up was also between Creighton & Evansville, as Rodney Buford's CU team defeated Marcus Wilson's UE squad in the 1999 MVC Tournament final. Buford had 21 points, while Wilson scored 16.\n\n-Doug McDermott is the first player in MVC history to reach the 2,000 point milestone during his junior season. The only other men to reach 2,000 in three years were Larry Bird and Oscar Robertson, though both men played their sophomore through senior seasons at their respective schools.\n\nWill Power\n\nReserve center Will Artino provided a huge boost in Creighton's 59-45 win over Southern Illinois on Feb. 19th.\n\nThe sophomore from Waukee, Iowa, tied his (then) career-high with 13 points and added a season-best five rebounds. He made all six field goal attempts and saw a career-high 17 minutes of playing time.\n\nArtino continued his strong play with 10 points and seven rebounds on Feb. 27 at Bradley.\n\nArtino scored a career-high 14 points vs. Drake in the MVC Tournament quarterfinals on March 8th, making 5-of-7 shots and four foul shots.\n\nEven when Artino misses, it's not all bad. Creighton has won its last 26 games when Artino has a missed field goal, and is 31-1 all-time when Artino has a miss.\n\nRare Bird\n\nAccording to research from STATS Inc., only two men since 1996-97 have compiled at least 2,100 points, 810 rebounds and 150 three-pointers in their career. That list consists of Creighton junior Doug McDermott and former Duke national champion Kyle Singler.\n\nName, School PTS REB 3FG\n\nKyle Singler, Duke 2,392 1,015 267\n\nDoug McDermott, Creighton 2,216 844 178\n\nCompared To The National POY's\n\nDoug McDermott is at 2,216 points in 110 games. He reached the 2,000 point milestone in fewer career games (101) than any Oscar Robertson Trophy or John R. Wooden Award winner in the last 21 years except one (Tyler Hansbrough, 99 games).\n\nWooden Award & Oscar Robertson Trophy Winners To 2,000 Points, Last 21 Years\n\nName, School Games to 2,000\n\nW O Trey Burke, Michigan Didn't reach 2,000\n\nW O Anthony Davis, Kentucky Didn't reach 2,000\n\nW O Jimmer Fredette, BYU 120\n\nW O Evan Turner, Ohio State Didn't reach 2,000\n\nW O Blake Griffin, Oklahoma Didn't reach 2,000\n\nW O Tyler Hansbrough, North Carolina 99\n\nW O Kevin Durant, Texas Didn't reach 2,000\n\nW O J.J.

Impressively, five of those comebacks have come away from home.\n\nBelow is a list of Creighton's 11 comebacks from down 15 points or more since 2000.

McDermott had 21 points and 11 rebounds to produce CU's first double-double in a season-opener since Kyle Korver in 2001-02.\n\nHe was then honored on Nov. 26th after averaging 25.3 points and 7.3 rebounds while earning MVP honors of the Las Vegas Invitational.\n\nMcDermott was honored on Dec. 10th after averaging 28.5 points in wins vs. Nebraska and Akron.\n\nMcDermott was honored on Dec. 17th after scoring 34 points and hauling down nine rebounds in a win at Cal on Dec. 15th. He was also named National Player of the Week by Seth Davis (CBS/Sports Illustrated) and the USBWA for that performance.\n\nHis fifth honor of the year came on Jan. 14th after he averaged 27.5 points and 8.5 rebounds in wins over Missouri State and Drake.\n\nMcDermott averaged 27.0 points and 8.5 rebounds per game in wins vs. Missouri State and Bradley to win his sixth award on Feb. 4th.\n\nHe earned his seventh accolade on Feb. 18th by averaging 18.0 points, 11.0 rebounds and 3.0 assists as Creighton while becoming the first junior in league history to surpass 2,000 career points.\n\nMost recently, McDermott picked up his eighth honor on March 2nd after averaging 36.5 points and 8.5 rebounds in wins vs. Bradley and Wichita State that clinched CU's first outright MVC title since 2001.\n\nMcDermott owns 13 career MVC Player of the Week honors, something only Bradley great Hersey Hawkins (14) can top. His eight honors this year surpass Hawkins' 1987-88 campaign (6) for the most ever in a single-season.\n\nIncluding his seven MVC Newcomer of the Week honors in 2010-11, McDermott has won at least one weekly award from the MVC in 20 of 49 weeks since enrolling at Creighton.\n\n10 Conference Wins x 17\n\nCreighton extended its MVC record by winning 10 or more league games for a 17th consecutive season, picking up the 10th victory on Feb. 16th at Evansville.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 17 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas (19 straight, including this season).\n\nThis was also Creighton's 17th straight season the Jays have finished fourth place or better in the MVC as well.\n\nMcDermott Through 100 Games\n\nCreighton junior Doug McDermott played in his 100th career game on Feb. 13th at UNI.\n\nHe is the first Bluejay since Ryan Sears (1997-2001) to start the first 100 games of his career. Here's a look at the stats from some other recent notable Creighton players through 100 career games.\n\nFirst 100 Career Games\n\nName Pts Rebounds\n\nDoug McDermott 1,980 768\n\nRodney Buford 1,799 584\n\nBob Harstad 1,626 888\n\nChad Gallagher 1,508 695\n\nKyle Korver 1,306 480\n\nNate Funk 1,144 324\n\nRyan Sears 1,061 326\n\nBen Walker 951 530\n\nKenny Lawson Jr. 896 517\n\nDane Watts 830 498\n\nAnthony Tolliver 782 443\n\nPoll Position\n\nCreighton was ranekd nearly all season long before finishing the year 22nd in the final Associated Press poll (released March 18) and 21st in the USA Today Coaches poll (released April 8th at the end of the year).\n\nCreighton's program-record streak of 17 straight weeks in the AP's top-25 was snapped when the Jays dropped out of the Feb. 11th edition.\n\nCreighton's best AP ranking this year was 11th on Nov. 26th, and its best coaches poll rank was 10th.\n\nCreighton was ranked 15th in this year's preseason coaches poll, its first preseason recognition since coming in at No. 23 in 2006-07.\n\nCreighton started this year with a No. 16 preseason ranking by the AP, its highest preseason mark in program history and the best by any MVC school since No. 6 Wichita State in 1981-82.\n\nIncluding the March 18th poll, Creighton has been ranked 28 times in 57 weeks of polls under Greg McDermott, and ranked between 26th-to-28th in five other polls. The 28 weeks in the top-25 under McDermott is more than any coach in Bluejay history.\n\nCoaches Spending Most Weeks in Top 25 at CU\n\nGreg McDermott, 2010-Pres. 28 (of 57)\n\nDana Altman, 1994-2010 18\n\nTom Apke, 1974-81 5\n\nEddie Sutton, 1969-74 5\n\n20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton won 20 or more games for the 14th time in the last 15 seasons, an unprecedented feat in Missouri Valley Conference history that puts the Jays among an exclusive group, nationally.\n\nJust five schools nationally have had 20 or more wins each of the last 15 years: Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas and Syracuse.\n\nCreighton is one of four schools with 20 or more wins in exactly 14 of the past 15 years. That list consists of Creighton, Kent State, Kentucky and Utah State.\n\nThat's better than traditional powers Arizona, Connecticut and Memphis (13 each) and also ahead of Michigan State, Pittsburgh and Wisconsin (12 each).\n\nCreighton secured its 25th all-time 20-win season with a victory on Feb. 2nd, the second-fastest its ever been (by calendar) to that milestone.\n\nMost 20+ Win Seasons, Last 15 Years\n\nSeasons* School 2012-13 W-L Next Game\n\n15 Gonzaga 32-3 Done\n\n15 Kansas 31-6 Done\n\n15 Duke 30-6 Done\n\n15 Syracuse 30-10 Done\n\n15 Florida 29-8 Done\n\n14 Creighton 28-8 Done\n\n14 Utah State 21-10 Done\n\n14 Kentucky 21-12 Done\n\n14 Kent State 21-14 Done\n\n20-Win Seasons\n\nCreighton has earned its 25th 20-win season in program history.

CU is 29-1 under Greg McDermott and 15-0 this year when Wragge shoots 50 percent from three-point range.\n\nCreighton was 8-1 when Austin Chatman (7.4 ppg.) scored in double-figures this year.\n\nCreighton was 6-2 when Jahenns Manigat (5.9 ppg.) scored in double-figures this year. CU is now 19-1 all-time when Manigat makes three or more 3-pointers, including 17 straight wins, and the Jays are 22-2 (with 20 straight wins) when Manigat shoots better than 50 percent from 3-point range.\n\nCreighton is 13-0 all-time when Avery Dingman (3.7 ppg.) makes multiple three-pointers.\n\nCreighton's won its last 26 games when Will Artino (64.6 percent) has missed a field goal attempt, and is 31-1 all-time when it happens.\n\nAbout The Final Seconds\n\nCreighton's Feb. 13 game at Northern Iowa was the first (and only) time all season that Creighton had a lead change in the final five minutes. Unfortunately for CU, its 48-45 lead was squandered as it lost 61-54.\n\nLast year's Creighton team went 5-1 in games that went to overtime or had a lead change in the final five minutes of regulation and were 7-1 in games decided by six points or less.\n\nGrand Poobah\n\nDoug McDermott has scored 1,101 points in his first 55 career home games. He is the all-time leading scorer in CenturyLink Center Omaha history.\n\nMcDermott also owns CenturyLink Center Omaha career records in points per game (20.1) and rebounds per game (7.5).\n\nIn case you're curious Rodney Buford scored 1,056 points in 56 career home games at the Omaha Civic Auditorium.\n\nOn A Roll\n\nSince the start of last season, Creighton is a remarkable 56-14. On a national basis, Creighton's 56 wins since the start of last season ranks tied for seventh, as seen below.\n\nCreighton is one of six schools with 28 wins or more each of the last two years, joining Syracuse, New Mexico, Kansas, Louisville and Ohio State.\n\nMost Wins, Since 2011-12\n\nSchool '11-12 '12-13 W-L Next\n\nLouisville 30-10 35-5 65-15 --\n\nSyracuse 34-3 30-10 64-13 --\n\nKansas 32-7 31-6 63-13 --\n\nOhio State 31-8 29-8 60-16 --\n\nKentucky 38-2 21-12 59-14 --\n\nGonzaga 26-7 32-3 58-10 --\n\nDuke 27-7 30-6 57-13 --\n\nNew Mexico 28-7 29-6 57-13 --\n\nCreighton 29-6 28-8 57-14 --\n\nWichita State 27-6 30-9 57-15 --\n\nNorth Carolina 32-6 25-11 57-17 --\n\nHistorically After 12 MVC Games\n\nCreighton was 9-3 in the MVC after its 12th game of the league slate. This is the 18th straight season that Creighton has had a league record of .500 or better after 12 games, and also the 18th straight year the Jays would go .500 or better in its final six contests as well.\n\nYear W-L After 12 W-L Final 6\n\n2012-13 9-3 4-2\n\n2011-12 11-1 3-3\n\n2010-11 6-6 4-2\n\n2009-10 7-5 3-3\n\n2008-09 8-4 6-0\n\n2007-08 7-5 3-3\n\n2006-07 9-3 4-2\n\n2005-06 9-3 3-3\n\n2004-05 6-6 5-1\n\n2003-04 9-3 3-3\n\n2002-03 11-1 4-2\n\n2001-02 10-2 4-2\n\n2000-01 8-4 6-0\n\n1999-00 7-5 4-2\n\n1998-99 7-5 4-2\n\n1997-98 8-4 4-2\n\n1996-97 7-5 3-3\n\n1995-96 6-6 3-3\n\nTotal 145-71 (.671) 70-38 (.648)\n\nMVC's Best On The Road\n\nIn addition to owning one of the MVC's best home-court advantages, Creighton has easily posted the league's best record in MVC road games since 2000-01 as well.\n\nCreighton is 64-53 in MVC road games in that span, a win percentage of .547. A distant second is Southern Illinois (54-63, .461). As a league, the road winning percentage has been .344 in the same span.\n\nMVC Road Records (since 2000-01)\n\nTeam W L Pct.\n\nCreighton 64 53 .547\n\nSouthern Illinois 54 63 .461\n\nWichita State 51 66 .436\n\nNorthern Iowa 48 69 .410\n\nMissouri State 43 74 .368\n\nDrake 34 83 .291\n\nIllinois State 33 84 .282\n\nBradley 30 87 .256\n\nIndiana State 25 92 .214\n\nEvansville 21 96 .179\n\nAll MVC Teams 403 767 .344\n\nOver .500, Again\n\nCreighton has been better than .500 in either the first or second-half of the league season in 35 straight trips through the league, including both halves this year.\n\nCreighton's 35 consecutive halves above .500 in league play is easily the Valley's longest active streak, with Evansville the next closest at a modest two.\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC season since 1995-96.\n\nYear 1st Half 2nd Half\n\n2012-13 7-2 6-3\n\n2011-12 8-1 6-3\n\n2010-11 5-4 5-4\n\n2009-10 5-4 5-4\n\n2008-09 5-4 9-0\n\n2007-08 5-4 5-4\n\n2006-07 6-3 7-2\n\n2005-06 7-2 5-4\n\n2004-05 5-4 6-3\n\n2003-04 7-2 5-4\n\n2002-03 8-1 7-2\n\n2001-02 8-1 6-3\n\n2000-01 5-4 9-0\n\n1999-00 5-4 6-3\n\n1998-99 6-3 5-4\n\n1997-98 5-4 7-2\n\n1996-97 5-4 5-4\n\n1995-96 4-5 5-4\n\nTotal 106-56 (.654) 109-53 (.673)\n\nClimbing The Charts\n\nGreg McDermott ranks in 12th in league history in wins as well as 11th in MVC wins, as seen below:\n\nMost Coaching Wins, All Games, MVC History\n\n1. 486 Henry P.

According to research by MVC Associate Commissioner Mike Kern, McDermott's 80 wins are third-most by a Valley coach in his first three years at a school.\n\nEd Jucker and Denny Crum both won national titles and are MVC Hall of Famers, while Crum is also in the Naismith and NABC Hall of Fame.\n\nMost Wins, 1st Three Years at an MVC School\n\nW-L Name, School Years\n\n91-19 Forddy Anderson, Bradley 1948-51\n\n82-7 Ed Jucker, Cincinnati 1960-63\n\n80-30 Greg McDermott, Creighton 2010-Pres.\n\n78-26 Chris Lowery, Southern Illinois 2004-07\n\n71-31 Tim Jankovich, Illinois State 2007-10\n\n70-19 Denny Crum, Louisville 1971-74\n\nEmerging Echenique\n\nGregory Echenique scored in double-figures during eight straight games from Dec. 1st - Jan. 5th, but reached double-figures in just seven of 20 games after that.\n\nCreighton was 15-2 this year when Echenique scores in double-figures, and 40-13 all-time when he scored in double-figures.\n\nPoint, Counterpoint\n\nNo player in the MVC owned more assists in the past two seasons than Creighton senior Grant Gibbs' 386.

Teammate Ethan Wragge is third with 224 treys, and fellow junior Jahenns Manigat is 10th with 146.\n\n3FG Name Years\n\n371 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n245 Ryan Sears 1997-01\n\n224 Ethan Wragge 2009-Pres.\n\n212 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n200 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n185 Matt Roggenburk 1986-90\n\n178 Doug McDermott 2010-Pres.\n\n177 Duan Cole 1987-92\n\n147 Booker Woodfox 2007-09\n\n146 Jahenns Manigat 2010-Pres.\n\nWho Will Start?\n\nCreighton utilized the same starting five in every game this season, and four of their five starters had streaks of 71 or more straight starts by year's end.\n\nCreighton was one of two teams to start the same starting five in every game this season, joining Stephen F. Austin.\n\nCU's starting five played together as a group for 424 minutes this season, during which time its outscored the opposition by 129 points.\n\nConsecutive Starts, Creighton (Active)\n\nDoug McDermott 110\n\nGregory Echenique 95\n\nJahenns Manigat 86\n\nGrant Gibbs 71\n\nAustin Chatman 36\n\nWinning Away From Home\n\nCreighton won a school-record 15 games away from home last season. The Jays went 10-3 in true road games and were also 5-1 on neutral floors.\n\nCreighton's lone neutral-site loss came to North Carolina in a not-so “neutral” Greensboro, N.C., in the third round of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nThis year's team went 13-6 away from home, with five of those victories against a BCS school (Wisconsin, Arizona State, Nebraska, Cal, Cincinnati), a 22-point win at Missouri State, a seven-point win at Illinois State, a 30-point win at Southern Illinois, a three-point win at Evansville an 18-point triumph at Bradley, and three MVC Tournament wins in St. Louis.\n\nThis season was the first time since 1942-43 that Creighton has won its first six games away from home.\n\nEach of Creighton's last 10 NCAA Tournament teams (including this year) have won 10 or more games away from home, and nine of those teams (including this year) had a winning record in true road contests.\n\nNation's Best Offense?\n\nYou can make a case that Creighton boasted the nation's best offensive production this year.\n\nCreighton was second in the country in field goal percentage (50.1) and three-point percentage (41.4), third in two-point field goal percentage (55.7), and 10th in three-pointers per game (8.5).\n\nDefense! Defense!\n\nCreighton ranked 222nd nationally last season in field goal percentage defense at 44.1 percent, one area that the program has tried hard to improve on in the off-season.\n\nThe results have been promising, as CU limited foes to 40.7 percent marksmanship. That figure ranked 77th-best nationally in 2012-13.\n\nOnly nine teams shot better than 43.4 percent this season against the Jays.\n\nThe 42 points by Nebraska on Dec. 6th were its fewest against Creighton since 1932, a span of 39 meetings.\n\nEfficiency Improves\n\nBecause Creighton tends to play at a faster pace and have more possessions than the average school, Bluejay coaches place significant emphasis on stats like average points per possession, with data that can be found on a site such as bbstate.com.\n\nCreighton's offense is still clicking as one of the nation's best, but the team has made huge strides on the defensive end of the floor, jumping from 222nd last year to 80th this season.\n\nAll but eight of Creighton's opponents have been held under 1.03 points per possession this season.\n\nPoints Per Possession\n\n2010-11 2011-12 2012-13\n\nOffense 1.065 1.150 1.136\n\nOffense Rank 46th 2nd 3rd\n\nDefense 1.006 1.014 0.948\n\nDefense Rank 192nd 222nd 80th\n\nMcDermott Goes For 39\n\nJunior Doug McDermott had 39 points on Jan. 11th at Missouri State, scoring in nearly every conceivable way. Consider the following aspects of his performance:\n\n-McDermott started the game 1-for-4 from the field, then sank his next 14 shots from the floor. When he missed his final shot of the game with 4:13 to go, the JQH Arena crowd gave a sarcastic Bronx cheer.\n\n-McDermott scored Creighton's first 18 points of the second half as the Jays extended a 32-27 halftime lead into a 50-32 margin.\n\n-McDermott's 39 points were seven more than the previous JQH Arena record.\n\n-McDermott outscored Missouri State by himself in the second half, 28-25, and outscored MSU 35-34, in the final 26:16 of the contest.\n\n-McDermott became the first player in the country this season with 39 points and 10 or more rebounds in the same game this season.\n\n-His 28 points in the second half were the most by a Creighton player in a half since he scored 31 in the second half of his 44-point performance at Bradley on Jan. 7, 2012.\n\nMore on 39\n\nDoug McDermott's 39 points at Missouri State now rank tied for 14th-most in Creighton history, and he joined Bob Portman and Benoit Benjamin as the only players in Creighton history with multiple games of 39 points or more in a career.\n\nPts. Name, Opponent Date\n\n51 Bob Portman vs. UW-Milwaukee 12/16/67\n\n47 Eddie Cole at Morningside 11/29/54\n\n46 Bob Portman vs. Weber State 12/23/68\n\n45 Tim Powers at Idaho State 01/29/66\n\nBenoit Benjamin vs. Indiana State 01/19/85\n\n44 Doug McDermott at Bradley 01/07/12\n\n43 Bob Portman at Kansas State 02/12/68\n\nBenoit Benjamin vs. Southern Illinois 01/17/85\n\n42 Bob Portman vs. LaSalle 01/30/68\n\nCavel Witter vs. Bradley 03/01/08\n\n41 Doug McDermott vs. Wichita State 03/02/13\n\n40 Chad Gallagher vs. Wichita State 02/17/90\n\nRodney Buford vs. Bradley 12/30/98\n\n39 Bob Portman vs. Oklahoma City 01/13/68\n\nDoug McDermott at Missouri State 01/11/13\n\nJays Reach 10 Home Wins, Again\n\nWith a Jan. 8th win vs. Drake, Creighton won its 10th home game this season. Creighton has now won 10 or more home games in 17 straight seasons.\n\nThe streak is easily a school-record, five more than the previous standard of 12 straight seasons from the 1969-70 season to the 1980-81 campaign with 10 or more home wins.\n\nWragge = Instant Offense\n\nEthan Wragge had 22 points in just 17 minutes vs. Drake on Jan. 8th, sinking six three-pointers for the fourth time in his career.\n\nIt's the second time in Wragge's career he's had 20 or more points in 17 minutes or less, having gone for 21 points in 17 minutes as a freshman vs. Xavier.\n\nBefore Wragge arrived on campus four years ago, no other Creighton player had 20 or more points in 19 minutes or less since Vernon Moore put up 21 points in 19 minutes against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 24, 1984.\n\nThe Barometer\n\nJahenns Manigat led the MVC with his 49.2 percent marksmanship from three-point range in league play a year ago. When it came to CU's nine MVC road games last year, he was the barometer.\n\nIn Creighton's seven Valley road wins, Manigat shot a robust 19-of-27 (70.4 percent) from downtown. In CU's two Valley road losses, Manigat was just 2-of-9 (22.2 percent) from downtown.\n\nIn Creighton's five Valley road wins this year, Manigat was 13-for-20 (65.0 percent) from three-point range, while he was 1-for-11 (9.1 percent) from deep in CU's four MVC road losses.\n\nMidseason Wooden Award List\n\nCreighton forward Doug McDermott was the lone MVC representative on the John R. Wooden Award Midseason Top 25. Selected by the Wooden Award National Advisory Board, the list is made up of 25 student-athletes who, based on their performances in November, December, and the beginning of January, are the frontrunners for college basketball's most prestigious honor.\n\nThree-Point Barrage\n\nCreighton started MVC play shooting the daylights out of the ball, making 50 percent or better of its 3-point shots in six straight games for the first time in program history.\n\nThe Jays were 12-of-24 from downtown vs. Evansville, went 13-of-25 at Illinois State, were 11-of-22 from deep vs. Indiana State, an absurd 16-of-27 vs. Drake, 9-of-17 from long-range at Missouri State and 6-of-12 vs. UNI.\n\nCreighton's four-game stretch to start league play was the first time since January of 2008 that Creighton's had four straight games with 10 or more three-pointers.\n\nCreighton's 16 three-pointers vs. Drake were tied for second-most in school history, tied for 10th-most in MVC history and the most in the MVC in 2012-13. The league record for three-pointers in a game is 20, done by Creighton (vs. Chattanooga on 2/19/05) and later matched by Bradley vs. Florida A&M on Nov. 21, 2006.\n\nArmy of Iowans\n\nEvery Creighton team since 1988-89 has had at least one Iowa native, and this season was no exception.\n\nCreighton had four players from Iowa on this season's team, continuing a long trend of relying on some of the Hawkeye State's top preps. CU's Iowans this season included senior Grant Gibbs (Marion), junior Doug McDermott (Ames), sophomore Will Artino (Waukee) and redshirt freshman Alex Olsen (Council Bluffs).\n\nOther past notable Iowans include Kyle Korver (Pella), Ryan Sears (Ankeny), Brody Deren (Harlan), Tyler McKinney (Urbandale) and Nate Funk (Sioux City).\n\nCreighton has played at least one Iowa native in 621 straight games. That streak dates to a Feb. 5, 1994 win against Wichita State. In that time, 943 of Creighton's 3,105 starts (30.4 percent) can be attributed to Iowans. Here's a list of the Iowans and how many starts they've made during this run:\n\nCreighton's Starts By Iowans, Since 2/5/1994\n\nRyan Sears 124\n\nDoug McDermott 110\n\nNate Funk 99\n\nKyle Korver 95\n\nMichael Lindeman 94\n\nTyler McKinney 89\n\nBrody Deren 89\n\nGrant Gibbs 71\n\nJoel Templeman 57\n\nKaleb Korver 46\n\nPierce Hibma 27\n\nAdam Reid 24\n\nCasey Harriman 16\n\nJohn Klein 2\n\nBig Man In The Middle\n\nGregory Echenique scored in double-figures in eight straight games from Dec. 1st - Jan. 5th.\n\nEchenique's 65.7 percent marksmanship from the field led The Valley and approached not only the Creighton (67.4%) mark, but also neared the MVC single-season mark (also 67.4%) as well.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Echenique ranks third in Creighton history with 174 career blocked shots. Echenique also ranks 13th in Rutgers history with 94 career swats, where he spent the first three semesters of college.\n\nMost Blocked Shots, Creighton History\n\n(Since 1979-80)\n\nBlk.

Including this season, all three Creighton teams to start 5-0 in league play would go on to win the MVC Tournament.\n\nCreighton's Best MVC Starts, Since 1977-78\n\nStart Year Finish/Place\n\n7-0 2002-03 15-3/2nd (won MVC Tourney)\n\n6-0 2012-13 13-5/1st (won MVC Tourney)\n\n5-0 1988-89 11-3/1st (won MVC Tourney\n\nHonors Roll In\n\nDoug McDermott picked up two big honors in early January, adding to his collection.\n\nESPN.com named McDermott the National Player of the Month after a December that saw him average a nation-best 26.5 points per game while shooting 57.5 percent from the field, 57.6 percent from three-point range and 88.9 percent in the line in six Creighton victories.\n\nMcDermott was also named the Lute Olson Award Midseason National Player of the Year honoree. McDermott was named the Lute Olson Award National Player of the Year at the end of last season.\n\nMcDermott was named Midseason National Player of the Year by such experts as Seth Davis, Dick Vitale and Andy Katz.\n\nConference Starts Are Big\n\nSince 1993-94, only one team (Northern Iowa, a 2008-09 co-champion) has won at least a share of the regular-season title without winning its league opener. Including this season, 17 of the last 19 regular-season champs (or co-champs) have opened 2-0 or better in MVC play, with UNI in 2008-09 and Wichita State in 2011-12 serving as the exceptions.\n\nTeam of the Millennium?\n\nBelow is the records for each MVC school from the start of the 2000-01 season until the start of this season, ranked by overall winning percentage.\n\nCreighton leads the MVC overall with 308 wins in the millennium, as well as 13 postseason appearances:\n\nMVC Standings (start 2000-01 to 2012-13)\n\nMVC only All Games\n\nTeam W L Pct.

Two of the five that didn't won the MVC Tournament.\n\nThe Bluejays won the MVC in 2000-01 and 2012-13, tied for the title in 2001-02 and 2008-09. CU was second in the MVC in 1997-98 and 2006-07, tied for second in the MVC in 1998-99, 2003-04 and 2005-06, and finished tied for third in 2004-05. The 1999-00 club was fourth in the MVC, but won the MVC Tournament, while the 2010-11 club tied for fourth place.\n\nCreighton's MVC Finishes, Last 16 Years\n\n1st Place 2000-01, 2012-13 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for First 2001-02 (won MVC Tourn.), 2008-09\n\n2nd Place 1997-98, 2002-03 (won MVC Tourn.),\n\n2006-07 (won MVC Tourn.), 2011-12 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\nTied for 2nd 1998-99 (won MVC Tourn.), 2003-04, 2005-06\n\nTied for 3rd Place 2004-05 (won MVC Tourn.)\n\n4th Place 1999-00 (won MVC Tourn.); 2007-08; 2009-10\n\nTied for 4th Place 2010-11\n\nUnbeaten December\n\nCreighton went 6-0 in December wrapping up an unbeaten December with a victory over Evansville on Dec. 29.\n\nSince 1946-47, Creighton's only two other teams to go unbeaten in December were in 2003 and 2008.\n\nThe 2008-09 team went 9-0 in December and would go on to win a share of the MVC regular-season title.\n\nThe 2003-04 squad finished tied for second in the MVC. That team began the season 12-0 before suffering an overtime loss in a game hosted by Northern Iowa and its then-coach, Greg McDermott.\n\nCoaches vs. Cancer Summary\n\nAs part of the nationwide American Cancer Society Coaches Vs. Cancer event, men's basketball fans were encouraged to wear pink to promote cancer awareness and participate in the “Creighton Vs. Cancer Pink Out” game when the Bluejays hosted Bradley on Saturday, Feb. 2.\n\nBluejay players wore pink shooting shirts and pink jerseys for the game and fans had the opportunity to honor a friend or family member who has battled cancer or is currently battling cancer by purchasing the apparel via auction (the shooting shirt could be personalized – last name, nickname, etc.).\n\nThe first 14,000 fans entering the venue on February 2 received a complimentary pink t-shirt courtesy of Alegent Creighton Health and Methodist Estabrook Cancer Center.\n\nLast year's Creighton vs. Cancer jersey auction raised more than $20,600. This year's auction raised $24,444. An additional $7,239.17 was raised from at-the-door collection, bringing the total to $31,683.17. Seven jerseys sold for more than $1,000. Below is a list showing what each jersey sold for:\n\nJersey #00 $2,025\n\nJersey #1 $1,125\n\nJersey #2 $860\n\nJersey #3 $5,002\n\nJersey #4 $406\n\nJersey #5 $2,550\n\nJersey #10 $3,050\n\nJersey #11 $510\n\nJersey #12 $1,020\n\nJersey #13 $450\n\nJersey #22 $910\n\nJersey #23 $585\n\nJersey #24 $960\n\nJersey #30 $556\n\nJersey #31 $710.01\n\nJersey #34 $1,025\n\nJersey #50 $510\n\nDoing It All\n\nReigning MVC Player of the Year Doug McDermott has one of the nation's best set of post moves, and now the junior forward is taking his skills to the perimeter with similar success.\n\nEight days after tying a career-high with five-three pointers in a 29-point thrashing of Atlantic-10 favorite Saint Joseph's, McDermott shot 6-for-8 from downtown in a 77-61 win over defending MAC champion Akron on Dec. 9th.\n\nMcDermott's career 46.4 percent accuracy from three-point range ranks tops in CU history. Since starting his career 15-of-53 (28.3 percent) after 20 games from downtown, McDermott has made 163-of-331 three-pointers (49.2 percent) in his past 90 games.\n\nMcDermott averaged 13.6 points in his first 20 games at Creighton, and has averaged 21.60 points in his past 90 games with the Jays.\n\nFull House\n\nThis year's Creighton team ranked sixth nationally in average home attendance, averaging 17,155 fans per game. It's the seventh straight season that CU has been among the nation's top-25 in average home attendance, and set an MVC average home attendance record.\n\nThe figure ranks ahead of 14 NBA teams, and would rank 17th in the NBA this season.\n\nIn 2011-12, Creighton finished sixth nationally in home attendance, averaging 16,665 fans per home game.\n\nCreighton has now surpassed 200,000 home fans in a season eight times. No other school in the history of the MVC has ever done so even once.\n\nCreighton also ranked seventh nationally in men's soccer attendance and 10th in baseball attendance, the nation's only school in the top-10 of those three sports in 2011-12.\n\n2012-13 Attendance Leaders (Unofficial)\n\nRk.

As can be seen below, good things have happened to the top-scoring juniors in the past nine years:\n\nNCAA's Top-Scoring Juniors, Last Nine Years\n\nNBA\n\nYear Name, School PPG Draft #\n\n2012-13 Doug McDermott, Creighton 23.2 TBA\n\n2011-12 Damian Lillard, Weber St. 24.5 6th\n\n2010-11 Kemba Walker, UConn. 23.5 9th\n\n2009-10 Adnan Hodzic, Lipscomb 22.7 not picked\n\n2008-09 Stephen Curry, Davidson 28.6 7th\n\n2007-08 Lester Hudson, UT-Martin 25.7 58th\n\n2006-07 Reggie Williams, VMI 28.1 not picked*\n\n2005-06 Adam Morrison, Gonzaga 28.1 3rd\n\n2004-05 Ike Diogu, Arizona State 22.6 9th\n\n2003-04 Kevin Martin, W. Carolina 24.9 26th\n\n*wasn't drafted, but currently in fourth year in NBA\n\nCreighton's Exclusive 30/30 Club\n\nDoug McDermott scored 30 points in a Dec. 9 win vs. Akron, then followed that performance with a season-high 34 seven days later at Cal.\n\nMcDermott, who leads the MVC with 23.1 points per game, became the first Creighton player with 30 points in consecutive contests since Bob Harstad in 1990.\n\nMcDermott also scored 30 or more in consecutive wins vs. Missouri State and Northern Iowa in January, then again in consecutive wins vs. Bradley and Wichita State to close the regular-season.\n\nNo Creighton player has had three straight games of 30 or more points since Benoit Benjamin did it three straight games in January of 1985.\n\nJones Hangs Up High Tops\n\nJosh Jones was hospitalized prior to Creighton's Dec. 6 game at Nebraska after he fainted during pre-game warm-ups on the Bob Devaney Sports Center court prior to Creighton's 64-42 win.\n\nJones was released from a Lincoln hospital on Dec. 7th. Jones was underwent a nine-hour medical procedure on Dec. 18th, and on Dec. 26th announced his basketball career is done due to an atrial flutter.\n\nThe senior guard was averaging 7.0 points per game as the team's top guard off the bench.\n\nCreighton outscored the opposition 249-92 off the bench in eight games with Jones, but was outscored 486-463 off the bench with him out of the line-up.\n\nA 45-minute documentary, The Josh Jones Story, has been produced and was shown in theatres on March 12th in Omaha.\n\nMight As Well Jump\n\nCreighton was 16-4 this season when Gregory Echenique wins the opening tip. Creighton's streak of 20 straight wins when winning the jump ball to start the game ended in its Jan. 23 loss at Drake.\n\nCreighton was 46-13 all-time when Echenique wins the opening tip, but 20-10 when he lost the tip.\n\nPizza Pie, Piled High = Wins\n\nThanks to a promotion with Omaha-based Godfather's Pizza, Creighton season ticket-holders can get a free mini pizza any time the Jays score 75 points at home.\n\nHistory has proven that when the team earns the fans pizza, it often leads to a victory as well.\n\nThe first three years of CenturyLink Center Omaha (2003-06), Creighton needed 70 points to earn its fans free pizza, and the Jays went 27-3 when reaching that threshold, closing out that run with 12 straight wins.\n\nSince upping the standard to 75 points prior to the 2006-07 campaign, Creighton is a perfect 67-0 when scoring 75 points or more at CenturyLink Center Omaha.\n\nIn other words, Creighton is a perfect 79-0 in CenturyLink Center Omaha since Feb. 6, 2005 when scoring enough points to earn its fans some free pizza.\n\nA New Streak\n\nSince Greg McDermott took over three years ago, Creighton is averaging 78.16 points per home game (4,299 points in 55 home games).\n\nThat's a vital number since Creighton is 90-0 at home (63-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 78 points or more and 72-0 at home (49-0 at CenturyLink Center Omaha) when scoring 80 points or more at home dating to a 92-83 loss to Southern Illinois on Feb. 19, 2000.\n\nStat Leaders\n\nStatistically, the Creighton team finished in the top-25 of nine different categories, including second in both field goal percentage and three-point field goal percentage. CU was also fourth in assists per game, ninth in free-throw percentage, 10th in three-pointers per game, 13th in assist/turnover ratio, 16th in scoring margin and 23rd in both winning percentage and points scored. One area of great improvement came in field goal percentage defense, where Creighton soared from 222nd a year ago all the way up to 77th this season.\n\nIndividually, Doug McDermott led the country in points scored (834) and field goals made (284). The junior forward was also second in points per game, 18th in free-throw percentage and 37th in field goal percentage. Senior guard Grant Gibbs ranked 13th in assist/turnover ratio and 22nd in assists per game.\n\nBig Road Win\n\nCreighton's 64-42 win at Nebraska matched its largest victory margin in a true road win since an 82-60 win at Southern Illinois on Feb. 14, 2009.\n\nIt was also the largest margin in a non-conference road win since winning at Drexel, 72-48, on Dec. 1, 2007.\n\nBefore Dec. 6th, last time Creighton won a true road game by 22+ points vs. a BCS-league team was 12/18/76 at Oregon State (90-68).\n\nScoring On The Badgers\n\nCreighton scored 84 points on Nov. 23rd against Wisconsin's vaunted defense that has ranked among the nation's top-10 in scoring defense in each of the past seven seasons.\n\nIt was the first time in either of the last two seasons that Wisconsin had allowed 80 points in a game, and the eighth-most allowed in regulation in Bo Ryan's 12 years as a head coach.\n\nThird-Year Coaches Update\n\nGreg McDermott was one of 53 head coaches hired to coach a school prior to 2010-11. His 80 wins in that span are easily the most of that group, and McDermott and Dana Altman (Oregon) are the only men to win a postseason game each of their first three seasons.\n\nBelow is a list of the new coaches with 69 or more wins at their school since being hired.\n\nSchool Coach W-L Next Game\n\nCreighton Greg McDermott 80-30 --\n\nOregon Dana Altman 73-37 --\n\nIona Tim Cluess 70-34 --\n\nColorado Tad Boyle 69-38 --\n\nAustin Powers\n\nAfter spending last year as a back-up to Antoine Young, sophomore Austin Chatman has taken over as Creighton's starting point guard. Creighton's been blessed with a legacy of some of the MVC's best point guards in the last 15 years, a streak that began with four-year starters Ryan Sears (1997-2001), Tyler McKinney (2001-05) and Josh Dotzler (2005-09) at the point before Young ran the offense while starting the last three years.\n\nHere's a look at the stats, by year, of the men that Chatman is trying to replace.\n\nFreshman Sophomore\n\nName PPG APG CU W-L PPG APG CU W-L\n\nSears 10.5 4.8 18-10 8.7 4.0 22-9\n\nMcKinney 4.3 2.1 23-9 5.0 4.1 29-5\n\nDotzler 6.4 4.2 20-10 2.2 2.0 22-11\n\nYoung 4.9 1.4 27-8 7.1 3.1 18-16\n\nChatman 2.4 1.9 29-6 7.4 4.2 28-8\n\nQuick Starts Key To Playing in Postseason\n\nCreighton has started off 3-0 (or better) in 12 of the previous 14 seasons. Each of Creighton's previous 14 3-0 starts (including this year) have been culminated in a postseason tournament appearance at the end of the year.\n\nRare Air\n\nGregory Echenique had one of the best all-around games of his career on Nov. 14 in the win vs. UAB, finishing with 13 points, 16 rebounds and four blocked shots. For good measure, he made 5-of-5 shots from the field and was a perfect 3-for-3 at the line.\n\nEchenique was the first Bluejay with at least 13 points, 16 rebounds and four blocked shots in the same game since Benoit Benjamin had 15 points, 17 rebounds and four swats on Feb. 28, 1985 at Dayton.\n\nEchenique was the first Bluejay to have a 13/16/4 game at home since Benjamin had 26 points, 18 rebounds and seven rejections in a win vs. Marquette on Jan. 27, 1985.\n\nIncredibly, Benjamin had nine different games in his junior season with at least 13 points, 16 rebounds and four blocks before Echenique ended the 27-year drought.\n\nPlaying With The Lead\n\nIn 170 games at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time, Creighton has not trailed in 41 of those contests, a staggering 24.1 percent of the time, including seven wire-to-wire wins at home last season and five wins (Longwood, Saint Joseph's, Tulsa, Drake, Southern Illinois) this season.\n\nCreighton has trailed by double-digits in 37 career games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, only to rally to win 22 of those contests.\n\nOn The Trail\n\nCreighton won six games last season after trailing by 10 or more points, including wins away from home at San Diego State and at Wichita State, on neutral floors vs. Drake and Alabama, and in home triumphs over Long Beach State and Evansville.\n\nIn its Nov. 14 win vs. UAB, Creighton trailed 45-35 in the second stanza, only to rally for a 77-60 win. It was the first time since Feb. 3, 2010 (vs. Evansville) that Creighton trailed by double-digits at any point before rallying to win by double-figures. That UAB game was also the first time in CenturyLink Center Omaha history that Creighton trailed by double-figures in the second half, yet still won by double-digits.\n\nCreighton has two comebacks from 10 or more down this season, having done so vs. UAB (10) and Evansville (16).\n\nPencil Him In\n\nAccording to STATS Inc., Doug McDermott is one of 12 juniors or seniors nationwide to start every game of his career (min. 2 years played):\n\nJuniors/Seniors To Start Every Game\n\nSource: STATS Inc.\n\nStarts Name, School Next Game 147 Brandon Triche, Syracuse --\n\n110 Doug McDermott, Creighton --\n\n102 Ray McCallum, Detroit --\n\n101 Brian Voelkel, Vermont --\n\n99 Cody Doolin, San Francisco --\n\n98 Frantz Massenat, Drexel --\n\n98 Deonte Burton, Nevada --\n\n94 Devon Saddler, Delaware --\n\n94 Holton Hunsaker, Utah Valley --\n\n94 Travis McKie, Wake Forest --\n\n93 Daniel Miller, Georgia Tech --\n\n93 Marshall Bjorklund, N. Dakota St. --\n\nMilestone Man\n\nBecause he's split his college career between Rutgers and Creighton, you might not realize the rather impressive college stats being generated by Gregory Echenique.\n\nEchenique owns 1,364 points, 991 rebounds and 268 blocked shots in 140 games as a collegian. He and Bucknell's Mike Muscala were the nation's only active players with 1,300 points, 950 rebounds and 250 or more blocked shots.\n\nHad all those stats been generated at Creighton, Echenique would rank 16th in career points, fourth in career rebounds and second in career blocked shots at CU.\n\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nSenior center Gregory Echenique played for coach Eric Musselman on the Venezuelan National Team last summer, alongside the likes of former Maryland star and current Memphis Grizzlies guard Greivis Vasquez.\n\nEchenique averaged 7.5 points and 7.5 rebounds in two games at the FIBA Olympic Qualifier in Caracas in July against Lithuania and Nigeria, where he went head-to-head against NBA players such as Linas Kleiza, Jonas Valanciunas, and Al-Farouq Aminu.\n\nDouble-Double Opener\n\nDoug McDermott opened his junior season with 21 points and 11 rebounds on Nov. 9 against North Texas in a 71-51 win.\n\nHe was the first Creighton player to have a double-double in a season-opener since Kyle Korver opened his junior campaign with 14 points and 10 rebounds in a 72-51 victory over North Carolina A&T.\n\nKorver would go on to earn MVC Player of the Year accolades as both a junior and as a senior. Last year McDermott was the first player in MVC history named MVC Player of the Year as a sophomore.\n\nIncluding this year, Creighton has won either the MVC regular-season title or MVC Tournament (or both) each of its last seven seasons it had a player with a double-double in the opener (2012-13, 2001-02, 1999-00, 1998-99, 1990-91, 1989-90, 1988-89).\n\nPreseason MVC Poll\n\nCreighton was picked to win the Missouri Valley Conference in the preseason poll of league coaches, SID's and media. The Bluejays earned 38-of-40 first-place votes and 398 points overall.\n\nIllinois State was second with 327 points and the remaining two first-place votes, while Northern Iowa was third with 316 points. Wichita State (298) and Evansville (240) rounded out the upper half of the league.\n\nIn sixth was Drake (184), while Indiana State (165), Missouri State (122), Bradley (84) and Southern Illinois (66) round out the rest of the league predictions.\n\nCreighton junior Doug McDermott was named preseason MVC Player of the Year. He was joined on the team by repeat selections Jake Odum (Indiana State) and Colt Ryan (Evansville) as well as new picks Ben Simons (Drake) and Jackie Carmichael (Illinois State).\n\nCreighton's women were also picked to win the MVC, just the third time in league history the MVC favorites came from the same schools.\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in a league-best 645 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. That's the longest active streak in the MVC.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Success\n\nCreighton has played 170 regular and postseason contests at CenturyLink Center Omaha all-time in its 10 seasons at the facility.\n\nThe Bluejays own an 145-25 (.853) record all-time at the facility, and have never lost there on a Thursday (7-0) or Friday (6-0).\n\nCreighton has outscored its opponents 12,795-10,788 in games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, an average margin of 11.8 points per game. Creighton has led wire-to-wire 41 different times, including seven times last season and five times this winter (Longwood, Saint Joseph's, Tulsa, Drake, Southern Illinois).\n\nPiling Up The Points, and Wins\n\nCreighton has won 58 straight games when scoring 90 points or more, dating to Jan. 11, 1988.\n\nCreighton has won 19 straight (at all sites) when scoring 100 points or more, dating to Feb. 26, 1977.\n\nMcDermott A Preseason All-American\n\nJunior forward Doug McDermott became the first player in MVC history to be named a preseason First Team All-American by the Associated Press. The team was announced on October 28th.\n\nMcDermott earned acclaim on 62-of-65 ballots, trailing only Indiana's Cody Zeller. The rest of the team consisted of Isaiah Canaan (Murray State), DeShaun Thomas (Ohio State), Trey Burke (Michigan) and C.J. McCollum (Lehigh).\n\nThe preseason All-America team was first announced in 1986-87.\n\nMcDermott and Burke were both on the postseason AP All-America First Team, where they were joined by Victor Oladipo (Indiana), Kelly Olynyk (Gonzaga) and Otto Porter Jr. (Georgetown).\n\nEverybody's All-American\n\nDoug McDermott hauled in All-America honors on a regular basis last year.\n\nHe was named a First Team All-American by the Associated Press, NABC, USBWA, Basketball Times and ESPN.com, and a second-team selection by The Sporting News and CBSSports.com. He was also named to the 10-man John R. Wooden Award All-America team.\n\nPrior to McDermott, the only other player honored by the USBWA with All-America status had been second-team selection Kyle Korver in 2003, and the only prior NABC selections from Creighton had been second-teamer Paul Silas (1964) and third-team selections Benoit Benjamin (1985) and Kyle Korver (2003).\n\nLast year McDermott was named CollegeInsider.com's Lute Olson National Player of the Year. He was also a finalist for the Naismith and Wooden Award, though Anthony Davis won both awards.\n\nScoring In Numbers\n\nDoug McDermott owned 834 points in 36 games this year, an average of 23.2 per contest that ranked him second nationally in scoring.\n\nMcDermott's 23.2 points per game ranked fourth-most in CU single-season history and were the most since Bob Portman averaged 26.2 points per game in 1968-69.\n\nPortman, who finished fifth nationally in scoring in 1967-68 (29.5 ppg.), was the only previous "
