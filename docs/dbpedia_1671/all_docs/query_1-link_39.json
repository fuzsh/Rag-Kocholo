        "text": "CMU recognized in national poll, down one spot in regional rankings after winning 13th RMAC title\n\nGRAND JUNCTION, Colo.— After sweeping their last six games of the regular season to claim an outright Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Regular Season title, the Colorado Mesa University Maverick softball team will play host to the RMAC Tournament for the sixth straight time, beginning Thursday at the CMU Softball Stadium.\n\nIn total, ten or 11 games will be played during the 6-team double-elimination tournament, which will run through Saturday afternoon or evening.\n\nThe winner will receive the RMAC's automatic berth into the South Central Regional portion of the NCAA Division II Tournament.\n\nGames will be played at 10 a.m., 12:30 p.m., 3 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. on both Thursday and Friday. Saturday's schedule begins with an elimination game at Noon followed by the championship game at 2:30 p.m. and the if-necessary game to follow at 5 p.m.\n\nThe Mavericks (43-7, 35-3 RMAC) will be the top seed and will receive a first round bye. They will then open the tournament in Game 4 at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday against the first round winner between No. 4 seed MSU Denver and No. 5 seed UCCS, who will square off in Game 2.\n\nColorado Christian is the No. 2 seed and will face the Game 1 winner of Regis and Fort Lewis in Game 3.\n\nThe RMAC's tournament webpage, which is also where tickets can be purchased, has the complete bracket as well as links to live stats and live streams on the RMAC Network.\n\nParking\n\nDue to the ongoing construction projects on campus adjacent to the CMU Softball Stadium, parking is limited. Fans are encouraged to use lots, CP1, CP3, CP8, CP12 and CP15 found on this parking map. Parking enforcement in those lots only will be relaxed during the tournament. Parking in any other lot is at your own risk for ticketing.\n\nLast Time Out\n\nThe Mavericks took care of business in their regular season capping series against Chadron State, sweeping the Eagles in a 4-game set last Friday and Saturday at home. The Mavericks won three of the four games via shutout and the mercy-rule in five innings after taking the opener, 6-2. The Mavericks out-scored the Eagles, 42-2 throughout the series.\n\nAbout an hour after completing the series sweep, the Mavericks then learned that Colorado Christian dropped their series finale at New Mexico Highlands after run-ruling the last place Cowgirls in the first three games. That Cougar loss then allowed the Mavericks to win the RMAC title outright. CMU would have shared the regular season title with Cougars if CCU had been able to complete their series sweep.\n\nThey honored four players— Paige Adair, Nicole Christensen, Shea Mauser and Lauren Wedman during Senior Day festivities in between games on Sunday's doubleheader.\n\nOffensively, the Mavericks recorded 53 hits throughout the series, hitting .505 as a team. They had 23 extra-base hits, including ten home runs. Christensen had two home runs in Game 2 of the series and then hit three doubles during her Senior Day doubleheader on Sunday. She finished the weekend hitting .600 and slugging at a 1.500 clip while driving in nine runs and scoring six.\n\nReserve catcher Kaley Barker also went 5-for-5 with two doubles and a home run in two starts as one of the nine different Mavericks who recorded a home run and as one of the 15 different Mavs that had at least one hit during the weekend. All 15 such Mavericks had weekend batting averages of .333 or higher.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maverick pitching staff was impressive as all three pitchers recorded a complete game shutout during the series. Ellie Smith pitched a 1-htter and took a perfect game into the top of the fifth inning of Game 2 of the series.\n\nAdair and Mauser then tossed shutouts in Saturday's doubleheader. Adair also picked up the win in the series opener.\n\nThe pitching staff conceded just 13 hits and three walks throughout the series.\n\nTitle Town\n\nThe Mavericks' 2022 RMAC Championship is their 13th in program history, a RMAC record. The Mavs have now also won each of the last six titles, starting in 2016. They were also tied for the RMAC lead in 2020 when that year's season was canceled and no title was officially awarded.\n\nThe Mavericks also won the RMAC Championship in 2014 and had been crowned champions in 1982, 1983, 1989, 2000, 2002 and 2007.\n\nThe 1982 and 1983 and 2000 championships came in years where the RMAC Tournament winner was declared as the official conference champion. Additionally, the Mavericks had the best RMAC regular season record in 1987 (tie) and 2001.\n\nDominant Champions\n\nWith last week's sweep, the Mavericks were able to six-peat as RMAC Champions. As mentioned in the previous note, the Mavericks had also won the 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and 2021 titles. They were also 10-2 and tied for the RMAC standings lead with Colorado Christian and MSU Denver in the 2020 RMAC standings when the remainder that season was canceled by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Mavericks also won the RMAC Tournament title in 2017, 2018 and 2021 and advanced to their fifth straight NCAA Division II tournament last spring.\n\nSince beginning their RMAC title winning streak in 2016, the Mavericks have posted a 277-55 overall record, good for an .834 winning percentage in their 332 games since starting the title-winning streak.\n\nThe Mavs have been even more impressive in conference play, going a 217-21 in their 238 RMAC games since 2016, good for an .912 winning percentage. The Mavs have not lost more than four RMAC games in a single season during that 6-year stretch and lost just three out of 38 this year.\n\nTourney Success\n\nThe Mavericks have also won seven previous RMAC Tournament titles. They won three straight games on the final day of last year's tournament to win it for the first time since going back-to-back in 2017 and 2018. CMU also won the RMAC Tournament in 1982, 1983, 1992 and 2000.\n\nThey had also won their first three games of the 2019 RMAC Tournament before being downed by now Division I Dixie State in the championship and if-necessary game. They were a perfect 8-0 in RMAC Tournament play during the 2017 and 2018 competitions, combined, after going 2-2 in 2016.\n\nIn their current stretch of hosting, the Mavericks are a combined 17-5 in RMAC Tournament play.\n\nStat Dominance\n\nIn looking at the statistics, it is easy to understand why the Mavericks were able to win the RMAC title with an impressive 35-3 conference mark. The Mavericks hit .385 as a team and held their conference opponents to a .175 batting average, an incredible 210 point difference. The Mavericks out-scored their RMAC foes by a combined 327-59 margin and had a team ERA of 1.48.\n\nOpposing pitchers had combined 9.01 ERA.\n\nThe Mavs also hit seven times as many home runs (85) as their RMAC opponents (15) and had an equally gigantic sized difference in doubles (84-14) in their 38 conference games.\n\nFour different Mavericks had .350 or higher batting averages during conference play, including Brandi Haller, who hit .427 while slugging a league-best .976 during conference play.\n\nShe was one of four Mavericks who had double-digit double home run totals (12) in conference play. Ally Distler lead the group and the entire RMAC with 15 conference long balls. Ashley Bradford had 13 while Nicole Christensen, who hit .422 during conference play, had 11.\n\nHomer Fest and Eye on the Record\n\nWith their ten home runs off the bats of nine different players last week, the Mavericks raised their season-long home run total to 95, a mark that now leads the NCAA Division II statistics by seven over Augustana. Colorado Christian is now third in the national statistics with 87.\n\nThe Mavericks also lead the country in home runs per game (1.90) over Augustana (1.73), Valdosta State (1.62) and Colorado Christian (1.61) as they close in on a potential national statistic title, which would be CMU's fifth for home runs per game in program history.\n\nOnly three NCAA Division I squads have hit more home runs than the Mavericks. The heralded Oklahoma Sooners have 116 while Wichita State has hit 109. Georgia has 96 in 52 games and has a lower per game average (1.85) than the Mavs.\n\nGeorge Fox leads NCAA Division III with 64 home runs to date.\n\nThe Mavericks hit a school-record 98 home runs back in 2001 and could potentially break that record this weekend. That mark was a national record at the time. CMU also won the national statistical title for home runs per game in 2000, 2006 and 2007 before RMAC rival MSU Denver won the next three long ball crowns from 2008-2010.\n\nCMU was also tied with Regis for the most home runs in the country (83) back in 2006 but has not led the country in total home runs since.\n\nThe Mavs' current home run total of 95 is tied for the 14th most in a single season in Division II history. Only seven squads have ever hit 100 or more.\n\nThe 2013 Humboldt State squad holds the Division II record of 114 while the 2010 MSU Denver squad holds the RMAC record of 112, which is the second highest Division II total.\n\nValdosta State hit 109 home runs in just 49 games last year en-route to the Division II per game record of 2.22.\n\nRecord Pitching Pace\n\nThe Mavericks are also on pace to set a new school-record for ERA. The Mavs currently have a team ERA of 1.54 this season, well below the current Maverick standard of 2.08, set 20 years ago in 202.\n\nTheir team ERA ranks them seventh nationally and a top the RMAC by a wide margin. Colorado Christian is second in the RMAC and 62nd nationally at 2.78.\n\nNearly un-hit-able\n\nDespite giving up nine hits in two complete game victories and 12 innings last weekend, CMU's Paige Adair continues to lead the NCAA Division II statistics in hits allowed per seven innings.\n\nShe has now conceded just 43 hits in 98 innings pitched, good for a 3.07 per game average. Biola's Paige Austin, who led the Eagles to the national title series in 2021, is second in the country at 3.33.\n\nAdair also now ranks sixth nationally with her 0.74 WHIP (Walks + Hits/Innings Pitched).\n\nThe redshirt senior from Aztec New Mexico, who was the 2021 RMAC Pitcher of the Year, is also on pace to smash the Maverick record for ERA and opposing batting average. She has a 1.21 ERA and opposing hitters are hitting just .130 against her.\n\nStacey Dennis (2013) holds the Mavs' ERA mark of 1.62 while Kimbri Herring set the lowest single-season opposing batting average mark of .207 in 2019.\n\nAdair also has a career ERA of 2.16, under the CMU career record of 2.21 held by McKenize Surface.\n\nAll three Maverick pitchers could finish under that mark as Ellie Smith is currently holding opponents to a .203 mark while Shea Mauser has a .208 opposing batting average.\n\nThey stand 1-2-3 in the RMAC with Alexis Hamilton of Colorado Christian having the fourth best mark of .223.\n\nIn ERA, Adair leads the RMAC while Smith is second at 1.47. Mauser ranks fourth at 1.95 while Hamilton is third at 1.75.\n\nSmith also has a 3-year career ERA of 1.87, even better than Adair's current 4-year mark.\n\nReceiving Votes\n\nFor the first time since sitting 21st in the preseason poll, the Mavericks are receiving votes in the NFCA's Division II Coaches' Poll. The Mavs received four votes and are a pseudo-29th\n\nColorado Christian had been the lone RMAC school to have been receiving votes in the previous two polls.\n\nIn the Rankings\n\nAfter sitting seventh last week and despite their weekend sweep, the Mavericks were dropped a spot to eighth in this week's all-important NCAA Division II South Central Regional Rankings that will eventually determine the at-large selections and seeding for the regional portion of the NCAA Division II Tournament that begins next week. The latest set of rankings were announced early Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThey will be updated one more time with results from the conference tournaments this weekend in advance of the NCAA Tournament selection process, that will include eight teams from the region, including the winners of the RMAC and Lone Star Conference Tournaments, who will both receive automatic berths regardless of their ranking.\n\nThe No. 8 spot is perilous as a non or lower-ranked team could swipe away a potential at-large berth if they were to win the conference tournament.\n\nThe Mavs are ranked behind seven LSC teams. Defending national champion West Texas A&M is ranked ninth while Colorado Christian is ranked tenth as the only other RMAC representative in the rankings.\n\nOklahoma Christian and St. Mary's are just ahead of the Mavs. The Mavs flipped spots with St. Mary's after last week's rankings.\n\nBoth the Colorado Christian Cougars (46) and Mavericks (43) have more wins than any other team in the region. The Mavs also have fewer losses than any other team in the region except for top-ranked UT-Tyler (4), but being weighed down by the RMAC's lower relative strength and thus in the strength of schedule and RPI categories.\n\nThe Mavericks have an region RPI of .580 to rank seventh in the region. CCU's is at .563 and ranked ninth in that category.\n\nCMU has a 2-0 record against Lone Star Conference teams in Eastern and Western New Mexico and sports a 42-7 \"in-region\" record. The Cougars went 6-2 against LSC foes during the early portion of the season but lost their only game against a regionally-ranked squad West Texas A&M. They are 46-7 in \"in-region\" play.\n\nThe Mavs do have better numbers in all but one (strength of schedule) of the ranking criteria categories than St. Mary's in the public-facing data, but are still below the Rattlers in the rankings.\n\nColorado Mesa is also 9-1 while St. Mary's is 6-2 against common opponents.\n\nEye on Texas\n\nThe Lone Star Conference will begin their 10-team single-elimination tournament on Thursday as well in Tyler, Texas. Top seed UT Tyler, ranked No. 1 nationally and in the regional rankings, is hosting it.\n\nCameron and St. Edwards are the lowest two seeds and are the only two teams in the LSC Tournament not in the top-10 of this week's regional rankings.\n\nResults and info about the LSC Tournament can be found at https://lonestarconference.org/tournaments/?id=58\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nAfter sweeping Chadron State in their final regular season series, the Mavericks improved their home-field record to 21-1 this season.\n\nThe home success is nothing new for the Mavericks, who have been tough to beat at the CMU Softball Stadium. The Mavericks went 23-2 at home last season and are now 155-21 at home since the start of the 2015 season, good for a .881 winning percentage over the seven seasons. They were a perfect 24-0 at home back in 2017 and have now recorded 20 or more home wins in each of their last five full seasons.\n\nHere's a look at the Mavericks' home-field records over that span\n\n2015- 18-2\n\n2016- 17-5\n\n2017- 24-0\n\n2018- 22-5\n\n2019-24-4\n\n2020*- 6-2\n\n2021-23-2\n\n2022- 21-1 (current)\n\n*Pandemic abbreviated season.\n\nSmoothing sailing at the helm\n\nSecond-year Maverick Head Coach Mercedes Bohte, a member of the Maverick coaching staff since 2013, now has a 82-12 (.884) career winning percentage as the leader of the program. The Mavericks have won 93.2 percent (69-5) of their RMAC games under her tutelage.\n\nIn 2021, while serving as the program's interim coach, Bohte, led the Mavericks to a 39-5 overall record, good for an .886 winning percentage, which was the best in Division II softball. She was named as the RMAC Coach of the Year for her efforts and then had the interim tag removed over the summer.\n\nUnder her direction, the Mavericks went 34-2 in RMAC play to win the RMAC's regular season title last spring.
