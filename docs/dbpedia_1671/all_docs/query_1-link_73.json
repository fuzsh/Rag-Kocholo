        "text": "WHAT’S HAPPENING: The Arizona women’s soccer team (9-7-3 overall, 4-4-1 Pac-10) will travel to Salt Lake City, Utah to play Utah (14-6-1 overall, 6-0-1 Mountain West) in the first round of the NCAA Tournament at 7 p.m., Thursday, Nov. 10.\n\nBrigham Young (15-2-3 overall, 4-1-2 Mountain West) will play Weber State (14-4-1 overall, 5-1-0 Big-Sky) in the first game in the sub-region at 2 p.m., Thursday, Nov. 10 at 4 p.m.\n\nThe winners of both games will face off on Nov. 12 at 1 p.m.\n\nNCAA Soccer Championship Schedule at Ute Field:\n\nFirst Round (Thursday, November 10)\n\nGame 1 - BYU vs. Weber State 4:30 p.m.\n\nGame 2 - Utah vs. Arizona 7p.m.\n\nSecond Round (Saturday, November 12)\n\nGame 3 - Game 1 Winner vs. Game 2 Winner 1p.m.\n\n(All times Mountain Standard Time)\n\nABOUT UTAH: The Utes enter Thursday’s match coming off a narrow 1-0 loss to New Mexico in the Mountain West Conference semifinals, snapping an eight game unbeaten streak. The Utes wrapped up their regular season with a 14-6-1 record, including an 8-1-0 record at home at Ute Field.\n\nUtah has used a balanced scoring attack much of the season, with 11 different players recording one goal, and seven with at least two goals. The Utes are led by freshman Adele Letro and junior Amanda Feight with seven goals apiece. Freshman Katy Reineke and junior Kim Lloyd have each added three goals and four assists each.\n\nThe Utes have been sound defensively led by goalkeeper Ashley Mason who has started all 21 games for the Utes while allowing only 15 goals. Mason and the Utes’ defense has allowed more than one goal in a game on only one occasion this season, a 4-0 loss to Cal State Fullerton at the Arizona Soccer Classic.\n\nThe Utes are 10-0 in games in which they score more than one goal, and have played four overtime games this season, owning a 1-2-1 record in those games.\n\nRich Manning, who is in his fourth year at the helm, coaches Utah. He has earned a 56-18-9 record during his tenure.\n\nWildcats vs. Utes: The series between the two teams stands at 2-2. In the last meeting on Sept. 16, 2005, Arizona defeated Utah 2-1 in overtime at home.\n\nWildcats vs. Cougars: BYU leads the series 5-1-0. The last meeting came on Oct. 1 with BYU defeating Arizona 2-1 in Tucson.\n\nWildcats vs. Wildcats: Arizona defeated Weber State in Ogden State 2-1 in the two teams’ only meeting on Sept. 25, 2004.\n\nWILDCATS AT UTE FIELD: The Wildcats hold a 1-0 record at Ute field. The only time Arizona played Salt Lake City was on Sept. 30, when the Wildcats lost 4-1 to the Utes.\n\nTWICE AS NICE: Arizona is making its second straight appearance in the NCAA Tournament after the program went without a postseason berth in its first 10 seasons. The Wildcats earned a Top 16 seed in 2004 following their co-Pac-10 Championship and automatic bid. A more than 2,000-mile trek across the country to Storrs, Conn., culminated with a 1-0 loss to Colgate in a game played in snow. Never the less, the NCAA experience was a breakthrough for the Arizona soccer program.\n\nEXPERIENCE PAYS OFF: Or at least the Wildcats are hoping their experience gained from 2004 will pay off. Nine of the 11 starters in last year’s opening round match with Colgate returned this season.\n\nThis year Arizona has five key contributors that are seniors and will end their collegiate careers in the NCAA Tournament. Forwards Mallory Miller and Kelly Nelson as well as midfielders Jennifer Klein, Nikki David and Kamaya Damwijk are looking to build off last season and extend their Arizona careers at least one more week.\n\nFAMILIAR FACES: There won’t be many surprises on the field this weekend in Salt Lake City. Arizona has already faced Utah and BYU this season in Tucson, and traveled to the Beehive state to square off with BYU and Weber State in 2004.\n\nThe Wildcats escaped with a 1-0 overtime victory over then No. 25 Utah in the Arizona Soccer Classic on Sept. 16. The Wildcats comeback bid fell short against BYU on Oct. 1, as the Cougars held on for the road victory, 2-1.\n\nLast season, Arizona picked up a pair of non-conference victories with a 2-1 win over Weber State and shut out BYU 1-0.\n\nSMITH’S HOMECOMING: Arizona goalkeeper McCall Smith is the lone Wildcat from the state of Utah and she will be returning to her hometown to face some familiar competition. Smith, from Salt Lake City’s Skyline High School, will be reunited with former high school teammates and current Cougars Natalie Evans and Alison Haymond.\n\nThe Cougars also have 15 other native Utahans on their roster, while Utah has 10. Weber State, with 20, has the most players from the state of Utah.\n\nCLOSER TO HOME: The NCAA Selection Committee was a bit nicer to the Wildcats this year, sending the club to Salt Lake City. Last year, despite being one of the Top-16 national seeds, Arizona was shipped to Storrs, Conn., where it fell to Colgate 1-0. The Wildcats hope being nearly 1,600 miles closer to home this year will lead to a better showing on the field. Arizona also hopes to face better weather conditions this year compared to the blistering cold temperatures that accompanied a snowstorm in the northeast last November.\n\nWILDCAT OPPONENTS IN THE TOURNEY: Eight of the Wildcats’ 19 opponents earned berths to the 2005 NCAA Tournament. Arizona played Pepperdine, Utah, Portland, BYU, California, Stanford, UCLA and Southern California. Four of the eight teams are a part of the Pac-10 Conference. Five of the eight opponents received a 1-4 seeding and are among the Top 16 teams in the tournament.\n\nStanford vs. St. Louis W\n\nBrigham Young (4) vs. Weber State L\n\nUtah vs. Arizona W\n\nPortland (1) vs. Iowa State L\n\n(1) UCLA vs. Mississippi Valley L\n\nSouthern California vs. UNLV L\n\nCalifornia (3) vs. Rice T\n\nPepperdine (4) vs. Mississippi L\n\n(2005 Arizona opponents in bold)\n\nEight opponents in the NCAA Tournament tops last season’s mark of seven. Additionally, five Pac-10 teams made the tournament over last season’s number of four.\n\nTOUGH ENDING: Four of the Wildcats’ last five regular season opponents all made the NCAA Tournament. The Wildcats finished up the season against California, Stanford, Arizona State, UCLA and USC. The only opponent in those five games not to make the tournament was Arizona State.\n\nWILDCATS vs. TOURNAMENT OPPONENTS:Arizona went 2-5-1 against the eight opponents that received NCAA Tournament bids.\n\nAug. 28 at Pepperdine Loss, 3-1\n\nSept. 16 Utah Win, 1-0 OT\n\nSept. 23 at Portland Loss, 3-0\n\nOct. 1 BYU Loss, 2-1\n\nOct. 21 California Tie, 0-0\n\nOct. 23 Stanford Win, 2-1\n\nNov. 4 at UCLA Loss, 2-1 2OT\n\nNov. 6 at USC Loss, 1-0\n\nWILDCATS vs. NON-TOURNAMENT OPPONENTS: Arizona went 7-2-2 against opponents that did not earn a NCAA Tournament berth. The two losses both came in Pacific-10 play versus Washington State (L, 2-1) and Arizona State (L, 2-1).\n\nREGULAR SEASON PAC: After winning the 2004 Pac-10 Championship, the Wildcats placed in a tie for fifth behind UCLA, California, USC and Stanford.\n\nThe two teams the Wildcats tied with, Arizona State and Washington State, both beat Arizona this season and did not earn a spot in the tournament.\n\nFINAL REGULAR SEASON PAC-10 STANDINGS\n\n1. UCLA (23) 7-0-2, .889; 17-1-2, .900\n\n2. California (22) 7-1-1, .833; 14-3-2, .789\n\n3. USC (19) 6-2-1, .722; 12-5-2, .684\n\n4. Stanford (14) 4-3-2, .556; 10-6-3, .605\n\n5.
