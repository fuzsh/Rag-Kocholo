The season featured several milestones, as Hicks and Vroman earned the program’s first ITA national doubles ranking at #52, while leading the SoCon with a 6-1 mark in-conference and compiling the most doubles wins in a season (16). Vroman received Wofford’s first player of the week honor since 2013 (Julia Paulson) and was also named Player of the Month for the Month of March.

In her final season at Wyoming, Hall guided her team to 11 wins and a first-round victory in the 2008 Mountain West Conference Tournament. The 11 wins matched the most in school history.\n\nThe 2008 tournament win was also just the second for the Cowgirl program.
