        "text": "SAN DIEGO- On Thursday, the Mountain West Conference announced the league's yearly honors, as five Air Force players earned All-Conference placements. More impressively, the Falcons represented three of the Mountain West's four individual honors, including Player of the Year, Pitcher of the Year, and Coach of the Year.\n\nJay Thomason was named Co-Player of the Year along with New Mexico's Jake Holland, as the C1C was among the most potent bats in conference play this spring. Thomason slashed .385/.476/.795 in 30 Mountain West games, equating to a monstrous 1.271 OPS. Thomason's 11 home runs in league play were second only to Holland, as were his 93 total bases.\n\nThomason's 45 total hits were the second-most in Mountain West games. Notably, Thomason's 19 total home runs this season propelled him to 56 career home runs, the most by a player in Mountain West history. He led all Mountain West players with 42 runs scored in conference games.\n\nHe becomes the third-consecutive Air Force player to earn at least a share of Player of the Year honors, as Sam Kulasingam had received outright recognition of the award the past two seasons. Thomason has now claimed First Team honors for three-consecutive seasons.\n\nSeungmin Shim becomes the third player in program history to win Pitcher of the Year honors, joining Griffin Jax and Paul Skenes as the only Falcons to win the award.\n\nShim's 3.72 ERA in 65.1 Mountain West innings led to six conference wins, the most of any pitcher in the league. The big lefty held opponents to a .254 batting average, the second-lowest mark among qualified arms. His 55 strikeouts were fourth-most in league games.\n\nIn 14 total starts this season, Shim managed at least 5.0 innings in 12 starts, and completed at least 7.0 innings in eight of them. Shim's First Team honor becomes his first such yearly distinction.\n\nMike Kazlausky was awarded with Coach of the Year honors following Air Force's first-ever regular season Mountain West Championship. Kazlausky's Air Force team was 18-12 in conference play, tying the 2021 Falcons for the most Mountain West wins in program history, doing so in four fewer games.\n\nAir Force's .600 winning percentage in conference play was the highest in the Academy's Mountain West history. Not since Reed Peters in 2002 had an Air Force head coach earned the award.\n\nDoyle Gehring, along with Thomason and Shim, was named First-Team All-Conference. Gehring proved to be Air Force's bullpen stalwart, tossing 35.0 innings in conference play with a 4.63 ERA. His eight saves were far and away the most as it pertains to Mountain West games, as his .248 opponent batting average was the lowest among qualified pitchers.\n\nHis 14 appearances were tied for second-most in 30 conference games, helping Gehring to his first All-Conference accolade.\n\nKulasingam ends his Air Force tenure with Second Team All-Conference honors, as the two-time Player of the Year in the league slashed .320/.405/.484 in 30 Mountain West contests.\n\nThe C1C was responsible for 41 hits in 30 conference games, including eight doubles, two triples, and two home runs. Kulasingam produced 14 walks to just 13 strikeouts in 128 league at-bats. The 2024 springs marks the third-consecutive year Kulasingam has earned postseason honors.\n\nRounding out Air Force's All-Conference selections is Chase Spencer, who was bestowed with Second Team recognition.\n\nSpencer led all Mountain West players with 17 steals in 20 attempts, the second-consecutive year Spencer has led the league in stolen bases. The C2C was a .311 hitter in 30 conference games while also being responsible for a .407 on-base percentage while slugging .487.\n\nLike Kulasingam, Spencer also managed eight doubles, two triples, and three home runs as part of his 37 hits in league play. The honor is Spencer's first end-of-the-year endowment.\n\nAir Force's five total All-Conference selections match last season's total, tying the program record. The Falcons will begin their Mountain West Tournament run this evening, as top-seeded Air Force takes on #4 Fresno State at 7:00 pm MT at Tony Gwynn Stadium."
