        "text": "Here are the DI college baseball programs with the most Men's College World Series titles:\n\nUSC has won 12 Men's College World Series championships\n\nLSU is alone in second with seven after winning the title in 2023\n\nTexas follows with six\n\nArizona State has won five\n\nArizona, Cal State Fullerton, Miami (Fla.) are tied with four\n\nMinnesota and Oregon State have each won three\n\nVanderbilt, South Carolina, Stanford, Oklahoma, Michigan and California have each won two\n\nHere's more on each team:\n\n12 — Southern California (1948, 1958, 1961, 1963, 1968, 1970-74, 1978, 1998)\n\nThe Trojans dominated college baseball through the 1970s, winners of the most college baseball national championships in MCWS history. Sparked by an unprecedented and still unmatched five title runs in a row, the Trojans have almost double the amount of titles than the next closest school in the history of the Men's College World Series. That run produced future Major League Baseball players like Fred Lynn, Dave Kingman, Roy Smalley and Rich Dauer, amongst a bevy of others.\n\n7 — LSU (1991, 1993, 1996-97, 2000, 2009, 2023)\n\nIt took a while, but once head coach Skip Bertman arrived on campus in 1984, the Tigers began to transform into a national powerhouse. In a 10-year span, he led the Tigers to five championships, becoming one of just three head coaches (Rod Dedeaux and Augie Garrido being the other two) to win five titles. Todd Walker would become a legend at Alex Box Stadium before embarking on a successful MLB career. Jay Johnson then coached the Tigers to their seventh crown in 2023, in only his second season with the program.\n\nHISTORY: Coaches with most MCWS wins | Schools with the most appearances\n\n6 — Texas (1949-50, 1975, 1983, 2002, 2005)\n\nThree iconic head coaches, each with two national championships apiece. Texas baseball has withstood the test of time in the NCAA tournament, and while Southern California may have the most championships, Texas’ sustained success since the earliest years of the Men's College World Series is unrivaled, with as many national runners-up finishes in the Men's College World Series finals as titles. The Longhorns began the illustrious history in Omaha with the first Men's College World Series title at Rosenblatt Stadium. Roger Clemens won a title in 1983 with the Longhorns, and 35 years later, his son Kody Clemens returned to Omaha, but the Longhorns couldn't pull in No. 7.\n\n5 — Arizona State (1965, 1967, 1969, 1977, 1981)\n\nLike the Longhorns, the Sun Devils' success can be marked in wins as well as losses. Jim Brock led them to Omaha 13 times, and Arizona State has been to 10 championship finals, walking away victorious half the time. That first Sun Devils championship team produced Rick Monday, Sal Bando, and Duffy Dyer, who all went on to win at least one MLB World Series title in their careers as well.\n\n4 (tied) — Arizona (1976, 1980, 1986, 2012)\n\nHere’s a fun fact. Coaching legend Jerry Kendall, who led the Wildcats to three national championships in 10 years, won a championship himself as a player with Minnesota in 1956. Arizona was a force in the late 1970s and 1980s and then won again in 2012, ending South Carolina’s quest for a three-peat.\n\n4 (tied) — Cal State Fullerton (1979, 1984, 1995, 2004)\n\nAugie Garrido helped keep the Titans relevant for four straight decades — kind of. Cal State Fullerton won twice during his first tenure, and then once more when he returned in the 1990s from a brief hiatus at Illinois. Ten years later, Garrido was on the losing side of a Cal State Fullerton Men's College World Series title. He was the skipper of the Texas team that lost to George Horton’s lone championship.\n\n4 (tied) — Miami (Fla.) (1982, 1985, 1999, 2001)\n\nMiami has been to Omaha its fair share of times, winning four of its six trips to the finals. The Hurricanes have been involved in some memorable Men's College World Series championship games, pitting iconic coaches and college baseball players against each other like in their 1974 loss to Rod Dedeaux, their 1985 win over Texas and a battle for the Sunshine State against Florida State in 1999.\n\n3 (tied) — Minnesota (1956, 1960, 1964)\n\nMinnesota was amongst the earliest college baseball powerhouses, as Dick Siebert led the Gophers to three titles between 1956 and 1964. Perhaps the most memorable was the 1960 three-game series against USC. Game 1 witnessed the largest comeback in MCWS history as the Gophers came back from down 11-2 to win 12-11 in the 10th, while both Game 2 and Game 3 went to extra innings, as the Gophers downed the Trojans 2-1 in the 10th on a bases-loaded walk in the finale.\n\n3 (tied) — Oregon State (2006-07, 2018)\n\nPat Casey ended his career with the Beavers a winner, taking Oregon State to the 2018 national championship over the Arkansas Razorbacks. It was his third title after becoming the fifth head coach to win back-to-back titles in 2006-07.\n\nMORE MCWS HISTORY: Game 3 results | Longest home runs (we think)\n\n2 — Six tied\n\nVanderbilt (2014, 2019)\n\nThe Vandy Boys are the newest member of the club, winning its second title in six years. Tim Corbin has turned the Commodores into a national powerhouse that also has a runner-up on their resume in 2015.\n\nSouth Carolina (2010-11)\n\nThe Gamecocks went back-to-back, winning in 2010 and then again in 2011. Ray Tanner entered the fraternity of back-to-back champs, joining coaches Bibb Falk (Texas), Dedeaux (Southern California), Mark Marquess (Stanford), Bertman (LSU) and Casey.\n\nStanford (1987-88)\n\nMarquess could easily have more titles to his name, making it to consecutive Men's College World Series finals again in 2000 and 2001. There, he lost to LSU's Bertman and Miami's Jim Morris in a showdown of college baseball coaching greats. Two years later, Stanford reached the MCWS finals, where Marquess lost to Rice.\n\nOklahoma (1951, 1994)\n\nThe Sooners had some space between their national championship seasons, waiting 43 years to get back to the MCWS finals. Oklahoma is one of four teams to make at least two appearances in the MCWS and not lose a championship series.\n\nMichigan (1953, 1962)\n\nThe Wolverines made the Men's College World Series finals twice in a 10-year span, and despite a few more trips in the 1970s and 1980s couldn't get back to the big game. That all changed in 2019 when the Wolverines made a memorable run from the \"last four in\" to the NCAA tournament all the way to the championship series, where they took Vanderbilt to the limit.\n\nCalifornia (1947, 1957)\n\nThe Golden Bears were the winners of the first Men's College World Series in college baseball history, as Clint Evans' squad defeated Yale 8-7. It was one of three MCWS finals not played in Omaha, Nebraska, but instead, was the first of two played in Kalamazoo, Michigan. California returned 10 years later to win over Penn State.\n\nHere's a complete list of the Men's College World Series championship games:"
