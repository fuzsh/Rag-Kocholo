The Red Storm did take last season’s series in South Bend.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame swept the Red Storm over a three-game series at Frank Eck Stadium during the 2006 regular season.\n\nâ€¢ St. John’s had captured four of the previous five in the series with the Irish (three one-run wins and a two-run margin), including a series sweep in Queens during the 2005 campaign (the last Irish visit to Jack Kaiser Stadium).\n\nâ€¢ St. John’s joined Seton Hall (1996), Connecticut (2002), Louisville (2007) and USF (2008) as the only teams ever to sweep a three-game BIG EAST series from the Irish.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame has lost just 26 all-time BIG EAST series (four have come against St. John’s).\n\nâ€¢ The Irish won 9-of-10 in the series from 2000-2004.\n\nTALE OF THE TAPE (2009 STATS)\n\nNotre Dame St. John’s Batting Average .308 .349 Runs Per Game 6.7 9.1 Home Runs 46 39 Slugging Percentage .451 .507 On-Base Percentage .391 .423 Stolen Bases 53-77 54-74 Team ERA 5.24 6.12 Opponent Batting Average .284 .314 Pitchers’ K-BB Ratio 1.5 1.5 Pitchers’ Ks Per 9 Innings 5.8 6.5 Pitchers’ BB Per 9 Innings 3.9 4.4 Fielding Pct.

Angels Mike Scioscia\n\nFREEBIES UPDATE – Over his years as a head coach, Dave Schrage has utilized a formula to measure how many free bases a team allows during a given year. The formula adds walks allowed, errors, stolen bases allowed, hit batters, wild pitches, passed balls, and balks and divides that total by the number of games played. In 2007, the Irish allowed nearly 8.7 “freebies” per game. By comparison, Notre Dame’s 2006 team allowed just 6.2 per game en route to totaling 45 wins. The Irish made tremendous strides a year ago, allowing just 7.4 per game.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame took two of three games in the season opening weekend despite a below-par performance in terms of “freebies.” The Irish walked 12 batters and hit four more en route to an average of 8.7 per game.\n\nâ€¢ Ironically, the Irish dropped two of three games last weekend despite a positive performance in terms of “freebies.” The Irish walked just four batters en route to an average of 5.7 per game.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame captured 10 of 12 games (March 6-20), but the “freebies” formula would not be consistent with the Irish success. Notre Dame averaged 8.1 per game over the stretch.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame has dropped both of its BIG EAST series against Seton Hall and Pittsburgh. The Irish struggled mightily with “freebies.” Notre Dame is averaging 9.7 “freebies” per game, while the Pirates and Panthers averaged just 6.7.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame was just about as good as possible in the “freebie” department in the series sweep of Villanova. The Irish issued only 11 “freebies” over the entire weekend — good for a 3.7 average per game (down almost 5.0 per game from what Notre Dame averaged entering the series).\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame issued 14 “freebies” to West Virginia in its 19-3 loss on April 17, but the Irish only surrendered a total of seven in the doubleheader sweep of the Mountaineers the next day.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame totaled just 21 “freebies” alone in the entire series victory over Louisville (three games).\n\nâ€¢ The Irish set a single-game high with 18 “freebies” in the 10-5 loss to UIC on April 28.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame has won seven of its last nine games and the success carries over to “freebies.” The Irish are yielding just 6.4 “freebies” over the stretch.\n\nâ€¢ Here is a breakdown of Notre Dame’s “freebies” in victories, and defeats in games both home and away.\n\nWins Losses Home Away Freebies 7.1 8.8 7.4 8.6 Freebies 2009 2008 2007 2006 Walks Allowed 205 178 191 170 Errors 69 54 83 68 SB Allowed 55 62 73 65 Hit Batters 48 47 61 50 Wild Pitches 36 35 45 23 Passed Balls 4 8 27 6 Balks 5 9 5 7 TOTAL 422 (7.8/gm) 393 (7.4/gm) 485 (8.7/gm) 389 (6.2/gm)\n\nQUICK HITTERS –\n\nâ€¢ RBI BY COMMITTEE: Notre Dame has 14 players with 12 or more RBI.\n\nâ€¢ IN THE CLUTCH: The Irish are batting .312 with runners in scoring position (.328 in 2008), led by senior Jeremy Barnes (.421, 32-for-76), sophomore David Casey (.379, 11-for-29), junior A.J. Pollock (.386, 22-for-57), sophomore Mick Doyle (.302, 13-for-43), junior David Mills (.319, 15-for-47), junior Casey Martin (.286, 10-for-35), sophomore Greg Sherry (.261, 12-for-46), sophomore Matt Scioscia (.240, 6-for-25) and sophomore Cameron McConnell (.228, 13-for-57).\n\nâ€¢ RIGHT PLACE, RIGHT TIME: Notre Dame is hitting .335 (302-for-902) with runners on base, but just .282 (263-for-962) with the bases empty.\n\nâ€¢ TRENDS: Notre Dame is 21-3 this season when scoring six or more runs and 10-17 when scoring five or fewer runs … the Irish are 20-3 when scoring the game’s first run, but 11-17 when the opponent scores first … Notre Dame is 26-0 when taking a lead to the ninth inning despite being outscored 30-20 in the ninth inning … the Irish are 20-5 when holding their opponent to five runs or less, but just 11-15 when the foe scores more than five runs … Notre Dame is 21-3 when out hitting its opponent and 7-14 when out-hit … the Irish are 10-4 when failing to commit an error … Notre Dame is 23-0 when holding a lead after seven innings and 23-1 when holding a lead after six innings.\n\nIRISH FINDING THEIR HOME RUN STROKE – Notre Dame hit just four home runs of its first 18 games and two of those long balls came in one game against Illinois on Feb. 22. The Irish then hit 25 home runs over their next 28 games, but have exploded over the last 10 days. Notre Dame has homered in eight consecutive games, including five consecutive games with multi-home run contests. The Irish have registered 14 long balls over their last five games, nine this past weekend at St. John’s. Notre Dame smacked eight home runs in its series victory over Louisville.\n\nPOLLOCK A RARE COMBINATION OF TALENT – Notre Dame’s junior OF A.J. Pollock has a rare combination of speed and power rarely seen at Notre Dame. The Hebron, Conn. ranks second on the team with 10 home runs and leads the Irish in stolen bases with 19. Pollock is one of two players in the league that has at least 10 home runs and 15 stolen bases.\n\nâ€¢ Pollock is the 11th player in Notre Dame baseball history to ever eclipse 10 home runs and 10 stolen bases in a single season. He would become thefirst Irish player to ever go 10-20 in a season with his next stolen base.\n\nDan Peltier (’89) – 15 HR, 13 SB (MCC Player of the Year; All-American; Academic All-American; future big-leaguer), hit .446\n\nCraig Counsell (’92) – 12 HR, 13-16 SB (future big-leaguer and two-time World Series champ), hit .339\n\nEdwin Hartwell (’93) – 13 HR, 11 SB, hit .447 (still ND season record)\n\nEric Danapilis (’93) – 13 HR, 13 SB,(MCC Player of the Year; All-American), hit .438\n\nBrant Ust (’98) – 18 HR, 11-16 SB (BE player of the year, All-American, reached AAA), hit .373\n\nBrant Ust (’99) – 17 HR, 10-14 B, hit .359\n\nAlec Porzel (’99) – 13 HR, 11-12 SB, hit .333\n\nPaul O’Toole (’02) – 11 HR, 11-17 SB (CWS team); hit .281\n\nMatt Macri (’04) – 14 HR, 12-16 SB (joined Peltier, Counsell and Danapilis as ND players with 12-plus HR and 12-plus SB in same season); (All-American, reached big-leagues), hit .367\n\nCraig Cooper (’04) – 10 HR, 12-17 SB (BE player of the year, All-American, currently at AA), hit .425\n\nNOTRE DAME STANDS ALONE – The Irish took two of three from Louisville (1st), USF (2nd), West Virginia (3rd) and St. John’s (4th) over the last five weekends of the season. Notre Dame is the only member of the league to take two of three from each of the top four seeds in the 2009 BIG EAST Tournament.\n\nâ€¢ Nine teams remained mathematically alive for the conference tournament heading into the final day of the regular season and Notre Dame was the only squad to play each of those clubs.\n\nâ€¢The two foes that did not appear on Notre Dame’s regular season BIG EAST schedule, Rutgers and Georgetown, who have combined for a 16-37 mark in conference action.\n\nNOTRE DAME AGAINST CONFERENCE CHAMPS – Notre Dame enters the BIG EAST Tournament with an RPI of 61 thanks in part to its schedule strength of 69.\n\nâ€¢ The Irish played regular season champions from not only the BIG EAST (Louisville), but the Big Ten (Ohio State), Atlantic 10 (Dayton), Horizon (UIC), MAC East (Bowling Green), MAC West (Ball State), Summit (Oral Roberts) and West Coast (Gonzaga). The Irish went 6-4 in those matchups.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame also 4-1 against teams that finished second in their respective conferecnes. The Irish upended USF (BIG EAST) twice, Illinois (Big Ten) once and Washington State (Pac 10) once.\n\nNOTRE DAME MIGHT HAVE FOUND A CLOSER – Sophomore Todd Miller has tken his new role of Irish closer and excelled. The right-handed hurler struggled out of the gate this season. Miller opened the season with a 8.00 ERA and 1-2 record in 18.0 innings of work over 10 appearances, including one start (against Toledo on April 1). Since that start, he is 0-0 with a 1.88 ERA and four saves in 14.1 innings of work over seven relief appearances. Miller has struck out 13 and walked just one over that span. He enters the BIG EAST Tournament with a scoreless streak of 9.1 innings of work and has not walked a batter over his last five apperances (10.0 innings).\n\nFighting for a Cure – Senior Ryan Connolly has faced adversity over his career at Notre Dame. The outfielder/catcher has seen limited playing time over the past two years due to a reoccurring shoulder injury — an injury that caused him to miss his entire freshman season in 2006. But, this adversity all pails in comparison to what Connolly faced in 2002 as a 15-year old sophomore in high school.\n\nâ€¢ Connolly’s father, Michael, passed away after a two-year battle with lung cancer despite never smoking a cigarette over his entire life. Connolly, and his mother Penny, along with the assistance of Dr. Leslie Kohman (Michael’s surgeon), began the Michael E. Connolly Endowment for Lung Cancer Research.\n\nâ€¢ The goal was to raise $500,000. The Connollys and the Board of Directors are responsible for all the groundwork fundraising efforts. After just three years of diligently collecting pledges and hosting golf tournaments and other fundraising events, they reached their goal. The Connolly Endowment issued its first grant of $10,000, which was then matched by the Hendrick’s Fund at Upstate Medical University, to a group of researchers trying to determine if lung cancer patients who had surgery would also benefit from a cancer-inhibiting drug.\n\nâ€¢ Connolly made his first career appearance and start at first base in the series opener against USF. His previous nine starts on the season had been at designated hitter. Connolly had a perfect day in the field, recording three putouts.\n\nâ€¢ He also smacked his first career home run and scored two runs.\n\nâ€¢ Connolly added two more runs scored in the second game of the series and a career-high three hits in the series finale.\n\nâ€¢ Connolly has started the last eight games for Notre Dame and the Irish are 6-2 in those contests. He is batting .333 (6-for-18) with a double, three home runs and 10 RBI. Connolly had just 17 career RBI over his first 58 games for the Irish.\n\nâ€¢ Connolly had a remarkable weekend against his near-home rival St. John’s last weekend. He hit .385 (5-for-13) with five runs scored, three home runs and eight RBI. Connolly drilled his first career grand slam before adding a solo shot in the series opening victory over the Red Storm.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame is now 12-3 on the season when Connolly starts.\n\nCARDIAC KIDS – Notre Dame rallied from five runs down in the seventh inning (12-7) to take the rubber game of its series with Louisville, 13-12. It was the largest come back victory for the Irish since they rallied from five runs down against Toledo on April 17, 2007. In fact, Notre Dame rallied from a six-run deficit in the series opener with the Cardinals to take a 7-6 lead before ultimately losing in the ninth inning. That would have been the largest comeback since March 6, 2004.\n\nâ€¢ The Irish continued their late inning heroics in the series victory over league-leading USF. Notre Dame trailed 4-1 heading into the bottom of the fifth inning last Friday, only to rally for an 8-5 triumph, and fell behind 6-0, again, heading into the bottom of the fifth inning, before racing back to take the second game of the series, 7-6. The victory on Saturday against the Bulls marked the first this season for Notre Dame when trailing after eight innings (USF led 6-5) and second walkoff win in three games (senior Jeremy Barnes drew a bases loaded walk in the bottom of the ninth inning).\n\nâ€¢ The Irish nearly recorded their third consecutive come-from-behind win in the series finale with USF, twice erasing two-run deficits in the seventh and eighth inning, but were unable to complete the sweep.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame picked up its first walkoff victory of the season against Conneticut on May 3. Junior Brayden Ashdown singled home senior Jeremy Barnes in the bottom of the ninth inning to give the Irish a 5-4 victory.\n\nâ€¢ The Irish found themselves down 6-1 heading into the top of the sixth inning against Illinois State on May 12. Head coach Dave Schrage called an impromptu team meeting in the dugout just before Notre Dame batted. The Irish quickly tied the game, 6-6, with a five-run sixth and went on to race past the Redbirds, 14-8.\n\nâ€¢ The Irish have posted 17 seperate come-from-behind victories in 2009 and seven came in Notre Dame’s last at-bat.\n\nNO FREE PASSES ALLOWED – Notre Dame’s pitching staff has struggled with walks the entire season. The Irish had walked 187 batters in their 46 games entering the series with USF which averages to just about 4.1 free passes per game. Notre Dame issued just five walks over the entire series with the Bulls. In fact, the Irish weekend rotation of sophomore Cole Johnson, sophomore Brian Dupra and junior Eric Maust combined for 18.1 innings without a free pass.\n\nâ€¢ The five walks were the fewest by Notre Dame in any series this season (the previous low was six in the sweep of Villanova.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame then issued just one walk in its 5-3 win over Western Michigan on May 11.\n\nâ€¢ Dupra continued his excellent control in his victory over St. John’s on May 15. The righty went 6.0 innings and did not issue a free pass. Dupra has now pitched 78.1 innings this season and walked only 15. In fact, he has issued just 25 career walks in 124.2 innings the past two seasons. Dupra has not walked a batter in 14.2 innings of work dating back to his start against Louisville on April 25. He has just two walks in his last 35.0 innings of work.\n\nFewest Career Walks Per 9 IP (min. 60 IP)\n\n1. Brandon Viloria (2000-03 ) 1.61 (15/83.2)\n\n2. Alan Walania (1990-93) 1.64 (59/324.0)\n\n3.

On the other hand, he is hitting just .259 (21-for-81) with a .506 slugging percentage and .348 on-base percentage in Notre Dame’s 21 losses. In fact, the Irish are 29-13 when Barnes has a hit and 18-7 when he has a multi-hit affair.\n\nâ€¢ Barnes is the only player in the BIG EAST Conference and one of six in the entire country with 15 or more double, five or more triples and 10 or more home runs.\n\nâ€¢ Barnes is also climbing the career charts in a number of Notre Dame offensive categories.\n\n223\n\nRuns Batted In Triples 1.

McConnell hosed the only stolen bases attempt all weekend by USF two weekends ago. In fact, it also was his sixth consecutive base stealer gunned down.\n\nâ€¢ The last Irish catcher to throw out 20+ runners in a season was Paul O’Toole in 2002. O’Toole threw out 23 runners (67 attempts) that season. McConnell has thrown out 37.3% (25 of 67) of attempted base stealers on the season, which would be the second highest percentage for an Irish catcher since 1996. O’Toole threw out 40.7% (24 of 59) of runners in 2001. O’Toole’s 24 runners thrown out that season was also the most since 1996.\n\nâ€¢ Notre Dame’s catchers last season, Sean Gaston and McConnell, only pegged 10 the entire year.\n\nâ€¢ McConnell ranks seventh in the NCAA in throwing out base stealers."
