        "text": "Here is a comprehensive guide to the NCAA tournament and its history, for college basketball fans of every level.\n\nFirst, the TL/DR version:\n\nThe first NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament was played in 1939.\n\nIt had eight teams.\n\nOregon is the first NCAA tournament champion, beating Ohio State for the title.\n\nThe NCAA tournament field grew to 16 teams in 1951, doubled to 32 in 1975 and expanded to its current size of 64 teams in 1985.\n\nAn opening-round game was introduced in 2001. Three more games were added to that round in 2011 for the inaugural First Four.\n\nThe term 'March Madness' was first used in reference to basketball by an Illinois high school official, Henry V. Porter, in 1939.\n\nMarch Madness wouldn't become associated with the NCAA tournament until Brent Musberger used it during coverage of the 1982 tournament.\n\nOne Shining Moment, the anthem of March Madness, was first aired following the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in 1987.\n\nIt was initially scheduled to run after Super Bowl XXI but the game coverage ran long.\n\nBelieve it or not, the NIT (1938) was actually founded before the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe NIT field is now usually made up of teams that miss the NCAA tournament.\n\nUMBC first owned the biggest upset in March Madness history, becoming the first 16-seed to win against a 1-seed. The Retrievers beat No. 1 Virginia 74-54 in 2018. In 2023, FDU joined the club by beating No. 1 Purdue\n\nDuke owns the largest comeback and second-largest lead blown in NCAA tournament history\n\nThe 2001 Blue Devils stormed back to beat Maryland after being down 22 points while Duke’s 1989 team lost despite leading Seton Hall by 18.\n\nChristian Laettner (Duke), is the NCAA tournament’s all-time leading scorer with 407 points. Only nine players have more than 300 points in March Madness.\n\nNotre Dame’s Austin Carr is not among the nine, but he holds the NCAA tournament’s single-game scoring record with 61 points in a 1970 game against Ohio.\n\nLoyola Marymount is part of the three highest scoring games in NCAA tournament history. The Lions’ 149-115 win over Michigan in 1990 is the highest scoring game in March Madness.\n\nUCLA has the most NCAA men's basketball national championships with 11, including a stretch of seven titles in a row between 1967 and 1973.\n\nDuke’s Mike Krzyzewski has the most NCAA tournament wins by a single coach (101).\n\nMORE: Browse every NCAA bracket since 1939\n\nWhen did March Madness start?\n\nThe first NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament was in 1939.\n\nWho won the first March Madness?\n\nIn 1939, the Oregon Ducks went 29-5 on the season and beat Ohio State 46-33 to win the national title in the first NCAA tournament.\n\nWhen did March madness expand to 64 teams?\n\nThe 1939 tournament featured just eight teams. In 1951, the field doubled to 16, and kept expanding over the next few decades until 1985, when the modern format of a 64-team tournament began. In 2001, after the Mountain West Conference joined Division I and received an automatic bid, pushing the total teams to 65, a single game was added prior to the first round. In 2011, three more teams were added, and with them, three more games to round out the First Four.\n\nWhere did the phrase “March Madness” come from?\n\nMarch Madness was first used to refer to basketball by an Illinois high school official, Henry V. Porter, in 1939, but the term didn’t find its way to the NCAA tournament until CBS broadcaster Brent Musburger (who used to be a sportswriter in Chicago) used it during coverage of the 1982 tournament. The term has been synonymous with the NCAA Division I men’s basketball tournament ever since.\n\nWhat is One Shining Moment?\n\nOne Shining Moment is the anthem of March Madness. The song was written by David Barrett in 1986, and first used for the NCAA men’s basketball tournament in 1987. After each tournament, the song accompanies a montage of the best moments of March Madness, from every buzzer beater and major upset to reactions of the fans themselves.\n\nBarrett wrote the song as an ode to basketball, but it was first scheduled to run after Super Bowl XXI. After the coverage of the game ran long, the song never aired for the Super Bowl, but CBS producer Doug Towey used it in the following March Madness, where it has lived ever since.\n\nRELATED: The man behind One Shining Moment\n\nIs the NIT part of March Madness?\n\nNo. While the National Invitation Tournament (or NIT), is operated by the NCAA, it is separate from the Division I men's basketball tournament. The NIT was actually founded before the NCAA tournament, in 1938, but did not become as popular as the NCAA tournament. The NIT's field is usually made up of the top Division I teams that did not receive an invitation to the NCAA tournament.\n\nWhat is the biggest March Madness comeback?\n\nWith 6:37 left in the first half of a 2001 NCAA tournament game, Duke trailed Maryland 39-17. The Blue Devils would rally to win 94-84. That 22 point comeback is the largest in the history of the tournament.\n\nStrangely enough, Duke is on the other side of the runner-up, as the Blue Devils blew a 18-point first-half lead against Seton Hall in 1989, as the Pirates eventually won 95-78.\n\nWho has scored the most points in March?\n\nChristian Laettner is the player who has scored the most points in an NCAA tournament career, with 407. From 1989 to 1992, Laettner played in an unprecedented 23 NCAAT games (reminder, one team can only play six games per year if they make it to the title game, i.e. 24 total throughout a four-year period), while averaging 17.7 points per game.\n\nOnly nine players have eclipsed the 300-point mark during NCAA tournament play:\n\nPoints Player Team Years Games PPG 407 Christian Laettner Duke 1989-92 23 17.7 358 Elvin Hayes Houston 1966-68 13 27.5 328 Danny Manning Kansas 1985-88 16 20.5 325 Tyler Hansbrough North Carolina 2006-09 17 19.1 324 Oscar Robertson Cincinnati 1958-60 10 32.4 308 Glen Rice Michigan 1986-89 13 23.7 304 Lew Alcindor UCLA 1967-69 12 25.3 303 Bill Bradley Princeton 1963-65 9 33.7 303 Corliss Williamson Arkansas 1993-95 15 20.2\n\nOscar Robertson's entry on that list is especially impressive, as Robertson played less than half the games that Laettner did, but finished with 80 percent of Laettner's point total.\n\nWhat is the highest scoring March Madness game ever?\n\nThe highest scoring game in NCAA tournament history came on March 18, 1990, when Loyola Marymount beat Michigan by a final score of 149-115 to total 264 points. That score is miles ahead of the second place total of 234, also set by Loyola Marymount.\n\nRELATED: Breaking down the highest scoring games in NCAA March Madness history\n\nHere is the full leaderboard:\n\nPoints Winning team Score Losing team Score Year 264 Loyola Marymount 149 Michigan 115 1990 234 Loyola Marymount 119 Wyoming 115 1988 232 UNLV 131 Loyola Marymount 110 1990 227 Iowa 121 Notre Dame 106 1970 225 Houston 119 Notre Dame 106 1971 223 (OT) Arizona 114 UNLV 109 1976 221 Arkansas 120 Loyola Marymount 101 1989 220 North Carolina 123 Loyola Marymount 97 1988 216 UNLV 121 San Francisco 95 1977 216 (2OT) West Virginia 111 Wake Forest 105 2005\n\nWho scored the most points in a March Madness game?\n\nNotre Dame's Austin Carr holds the record for the most points in an NCAA tournament game, with 61 against Ohio in 1970. Carr was a machine for the Fighting Irish and owns three of the top five single-game NCAA tournament scoring performances.\n\nTo get an idea of how impressive his performance was, we rewatched that game to see how Carr scored every one of his record-setting 61 points.\n\nHere is the list of the top 10 single-game scoring performances:\n\nPoints Player Team Opponent Year 61 Austin Carr Notre Dame Ohio 1970 58 Bill Bradley Princeton Wichita State 1965 56 Oscar Robertson Cincinnati Arkansas 1958 52 Austin Carr Notre Dame Kentucky 1970 52 Austin Carr Notre Dame TCU 1971 50 David Robinson Navy Michigan 1987 49 Elvin Hayes Houston Loyola Chicago 1968 48 Hal Lear Temple SMU 1956 47 Austin Carr Notre Dame Houston 1971 46 Dave Corzine DePaul Louisville 1978\n\nWhat team has the most NCAA tournament appearances?\n\nThere have been 80 NCAA tournaments since 1939, and there are five schools that have been to more than half of them. Kentucky has the most NCAA tournament appearances with 57, followed by North Carolina with 49.\n\nHere is the full list of the top 10 teams:\n\nAppearances Team First appearance Most recent appearance 60 Kentucky 1942 2023 52 North Carolina 1941 2022 50 Kansas 1940 2023 50 UCLA 1950 2023 45 Duke 1955 2023 41 Indiana 1940 2023 40 Villanova 1942 2022 39 Louisville 1951 2019 39 Syracuse 1957 2021 37 Notre Dame 1953 2022\n\nWhich team has the most NCAA tournament wins?\n\nHere is the full top 10:\n\nWins Team 131 North Carolina 130 Kentucky 118 Duke 112 Kansas 110 UCLA 72 Michigan State 68 Indiana 67 Villanova 66 Syracuse 63 UConn 61 Louisville\n\nWho has the most NCAA tournament championships?\n\nIn the 81 years since the tournament’s inception, no team has won more than UCLA, which has 11, 10 of which came a span of 12 years from 1964 to 1975.\n\nWho has won every NCAA tournament?\n\nHere is the list of every men’s basketball national championship since the NCAA tournament first started in 1939.\n\nHow can I find more March Madness records?"
