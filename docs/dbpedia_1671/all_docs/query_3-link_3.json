        "text": "The WIAA began sponsoring a tournament program in spring baseball in 1948.\n\nThe first State Tournament was held in Milwaukee, and a Milwaukee school (then called Boys Tech) was the winner, defeating Madison East, 10-2, in the finals.\n\nMilwaukee was the site of the State Tournament again in 1949, but it was moved in 1950 to Menasha where it was held eight straight years through 1957. Eau Claire became the new home of the State Tournament in1958 and for the next four years as well, then it moved to Oshkosh for 1963 and 1964 and to Wisconsin Rapids in 1965 before returning to Eau Claire for five straight years. Marion held the 1971 and 1972 tournaments, then it moved to Wausau (1973) where it was held through 1997. The tournament moved to its current location at Neuroscience Group Field at Fox Cities Stadium in Grand Chute in 1998. In 2021, the Division 1 quarterfinals were held at Herr-Baker Stadium on the campus of Marian University in Fond du Lac to accommodate COVID-19 guidelines. Since the move to Fox Cities Stadium, weather postponements have required the use of Nienhaus Field in Appleton as a secondary site for games.\n\nThe only interruption in conducting the State Tournament Series to its completion came in 2020. The entire season and Tournament Series were canceled to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBeginning in 1978, competition took place in three Classes (A-B-C). Terminology was changed in 1991 from Classes to Divisions (1-2-3). In 2006, the Tournament Series expanded to four divisions. In 2019, the spring season added 44 programs following the elimination of the summer baseball season in 2018.\n\nSun Prairie, before it split into two schools, leads all member schools in State championships with nine. Appleton West is next on the list with seven titles. Catholic Central and Nekoosa have five titles, while Eau Claire, Kenosha St. Joseph Catholic and Janesville Craig have four State titles. Aquinas, Athens, Denmark, Eau Claire Memorial, Edgewood, Greenwood, Hortonville, Kimberly, Marathon, Milwaukee Lutheran, Oconomowoc, Ripon and Stevens Point each have three titles each.\n\nLa Crosse Central leads in tournament appearances with 18. Sun Prairie has been to State 17 times followed by Stevens Point with 16. Eau Claire North and Milwaukee Bradley Tech are next with 15 appearances. Appleton West, Bay Port, Janesville Craig, Middleton and Oconomowoc have appeared 14 times, and Eau Claire Memorial and Fond du Lac 13 times. Kimberly has qualified for State 12 times, and Waunakee has 10 State appearances.\n\nOnly Denmark, Nekoosa and Sun Prairie have won three consecutive championships. Nekoosa won the Class B titles from 1980-82. Sun Prairie won Division 1 titles from 2012-14, and Denmark won three straight from 2021-2023. Back-to-back championships have been accomplished 17 times, including Nekoosa's and Sun Prairie's consecutive titles. Nekoosa also won two straight Class B championships in 1984-85, and Sun Prairie captured two straight crowns in Division 1 in 2005-06. Eau Claire also won two straight titles twice (1957-58 and 1961-62) before the class system was implemented. Janesville Craig (1983-84) and Oconomowoc (1980-81) each won back-to-back Class A championships, Appleton West also won a pair of consecutive championships (1975-76), and Bay Port matched that accomplishment in 2009-10.\n\nDe Soto won two straight Division 3 titles in 2000-01, as did Catholic Central in 2004-05 and 2010-11. Hortonville won two consecutive Division 2 championships in 1997-98, Milwaukee Lutheran accomplished the feat in 2002-03, and St. Joseph's titles were won in two different divisions, winning the Division 2 title in 2005 and the Division 3 title in 2006. Lake Country Lutheran also won back-to-back championships in different divisions, winning the Division 4 title in the 2014 and the Division 3 title in 2015. Athens won back-to-back Division 4 championships in 2017-18. Webster won two straight championships in 2018-19 but in different divisions. The Tigers won the Division 3 crown in 2018 and in Division 4 in 2019. In 2021-22, Denmark seized the crown in Division 2."
