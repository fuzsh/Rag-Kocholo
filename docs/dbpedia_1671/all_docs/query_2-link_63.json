        "text": "“College Basketball Catch-Up” is a column by Terence Holton discussing the latest college basketball headlines.\n\nI was tricked, hornswoggled, bamboozled and led astray.\n\nMyself, along with much of the country, was convinced that the Mountain West was one of the best college basketball conferences in the country this season.\n\nThis led me to commit errors when creating my bracket. I put New Mexico into my Elite Eight and believed that Colorado State would defeat Tennessee to advance to the Sweet 16.\n\nBoth the Rams and Lobos would lose in blowout fashion in the Round of 64, properly crippling my brackets, where I currently rank 15 millionth of all brackets created on the ESPN Tournament Challenge.\n\nThe Mountain West received six bids into the NCAA Tournament, tied for the third-most of any conference. This included more than two Power Six conferences, such as the Big East, which only had three teams make it — those being No. 1 seed UConn, No. 2 seed Marquette and No. 3 seed Creighton.\n\nThe six Mountain West teams that made the NCAA Tournament finished with a record of 68-8 outside of conference play and were poised to show that they deserved respect as one of college basketball’s best conferences.\n\nThat would not prove to be the case. San Diego State and Utah State were the only teams to make it out of the first round, with many of the conference’s teams showing almost no signs of life in their first-round matchups.\n\nJust to recap how pathetic the Mountain West teams were in the first round:\n\nNew Mexico lost 77-56 to Clemson and was down by 20 points practically the entire game.\n\nNevada was up 17 on Dayton with nearly seven minutes to play, but then proceeded to implode and lose 63-60.\n\nBoise State didn’t even make it out of the First Four, bowing out 60-53 to Colorado.\n\nColorado State did make it out of the First Four, beating Virginia. However, in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the Rams were held to 11 points in the first half and lost 56-44 to Texas.\n\nSan Diego State squeaked by 12-seeded UAB but is still kicking. The Aztecs easily knocked off Yale in the Round of 32 and will now face top-seeded UConn in the Sweet Sixteen — a rematch of last season’s championship game.\n\nUtah State was the only team who looked formidable in the first round, beating TCU by 16. But against one-seeded Purdue, the Aggies seemed to forget that defense is an important part of the game, losing 106-67.\n\nThis infuriating stretch for the Mountain West has solidified it as decidedly worse than the Power Six conferences.\n\nAnd with the Pac-12 exodus taking place upon this season’s conclusion, there is a vacuum of space where one conference could escalate and become that next Power Six league.\n\nThis would have been a golden opportunity for the Mountain West to step up and show they belong near the top of college basketball.\n\nClearly, that won’t be happening any time soon, as this complete and utter self-destruction has guaranteed the Mountain West will not be taken seriously in the near future.\n\nWhen it’s all said and done, the selection committee evidently made a major error when allowing this many Mountain West teams into the Big Dance.\n\nLike I said earlier, though, they tricked me, too. Had I been on the selection committee, I would have ranked these teams even higher. However, it is now clear that unless there are multiple great teams from the conference, the Mountain West should in no way shape or form deserve more bids than the Big East — one of, if not the best conference in college basketball.\n\nI have no one to blame except myself. I was tricked by the media and my own brain into believing that Mountain West teams were primed to make a deep run into the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe Mountain West from here on out is on Terence Holton’s bad side."
