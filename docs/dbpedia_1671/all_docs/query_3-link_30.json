Regional of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nEvansville was selected as the No. 4 seed in the Greenville Regional after earning the Missouri Valley Conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament as the MVC Tournament champions. Evansville will bring a 35-23 overall record into the tournament, and UE has won six-straight games after sweeping through the MVC Tournament with three run-rule victories in four contests. Overall, this is UE's sixth NCAA Tournament appearance, including fourth at the Division I level, as UE also participated in the 1988, 2000, and 2006 NCAA Division I tournaments.\n\nEast Carolina is the No. 1 seed in the Greenville Regional and No. 16 national seed after winning the American Athletic Conference regular-season championship with a 43-15 overall record. Friday's meeting will be the first between Evansville and ECU in the sport of college baseball.\n\nWake Forest will serve as the No. 2 seed (38-20 overall) and will face third-seeded VCU (37-21 overall) in the other first-round match-up in the Greenville Regional on Friday night at 5 p.m. central.\n\nEvery Evansville game in the NCAA Tournament can be heard live in the Tri-State area on 107.1 FM-WJPS, and can be seen live on-line on ESPN+."
