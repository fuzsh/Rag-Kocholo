        "text": "Men's Basketball 4/16/2012 12:18:00 PM None\n\n2011-12 Men's Basketball Season Recap\n\nCreighton Bluejays (29-6, 14-4 MVC) Year-End Recap For 2011-12\n\nA year that began with a preseason trip to the Bahamas in August ended in the third-round of the NCAA Tournament in March, as Creighton racked up 29 wins during a memorable 2011-12 season.\n\nAlong the way Creighton smashed conference records for attendance, tied a school-record for victories, had a consensus First Team All-American, was widely recognized as one of the nation's top offenses, and became a mainstay in the national polls.\n\nOnce every four seasons teams are allowed to take a foreign tour, which also includes 10 days of training prior to the trip. The Jays split their rare summer practices up, with some in July and the balance in August, before leaving August 10th for Nassau, Bahamas. While in the Bahamas, the team posted four double-digit wins, but also gained invaluable trust and an unbreakable bond that helped lay the groundwork for a squad with team chemistry as strong as any club in recent memory.\n\nExpectations were high from the start. Creighton's first practice was one of 11 covered nationally by ESPNU. Six of those 11 teams would go on to reach the Elite Eight. Valley coaches and media proclaimed the Bluejays as the preseason favorite, as CU collected 29-of-40 first-place votes.\n\nAfter lopsided home wins vs. North Carolina A&T and Chicago State to start the season, CU's first test away from home came against defending Conference USA champion UAB. The Jays went to Birmingham and emerged with a 10-point win, snapping UAB's 38-game non-conference regular-season home win streak. A few days later, the Jays hammered regional rival Iowa, 82-59, in Des Moines.\n\nThe Jays improved to 5-0 the day after Thanksgiving, feasting on Campbell to claim a 104-81 victory. CU made its first 13 field goal attempts and shot a then-record 70.4 percent from the field, while also dishing a facility-record 30 assists, to claim the Dale Howard Classic title.\n\nThose inside the program will tell you that the squad's Nov. 30th win at defending Mountain West Conference champion San Diego State was the one that got them believing that something special was in the works. The Jays trailed 31-14 early on at Viejas Arena, and one of the nation's loudest arenas was on full tilt. But slowly, the Jays chipped away, and were down just four at the break. The Jays would take their first lead at 65-62 with 6:34 left, and never trailed again in an 85-83 win. Sharpshooter Ethan Wragge had two rare two-point baskets down the stretch, as CU scored in its final eight possessions to hand the Aztecs an atypical home loss.\n\nCU followed up the SDSU victory with a home win over in-state rival Nebraska, 76-66. A closely-contested game turned in Creighton's favor for good when Nebraska committed a foul, then were assessed two more technical fouls, in a one-point game with 9:14 left. The Jays made 5-of-6 free throws and the Huskers never got within six points the rest of the way.\n\nThe 7-0 start drew the attention of the national media as well, as Creighton joined the Associated Press poll at No. 19 on Dec. 5th. CU would remain in the polls nine of the next 10 weeks, and 13 of the final 17 polls the rest of the way.\n\nCreighton suffered its first loss of the season on an early Saturday morning game in Philadelphia at Saint Joseph's. During halftime, new Creighton president Timothy R. Lannon was inducted into Saint Joseph's Hall of Fame, for his work as SJU's president the previous eight years.\n\nThe loss to Saint Joseph's proved to be a blip on the radar screen, as the Jays closed out pre-conference play with home wins over Houston Baptist and Northwestern sandwiched around a victory at Tulsa. The Northwestern victory gave Creighton a 10-1 record heading into MVC play.\n\nThe strong start helped sophomore forward Doug McDermott became a national name. He was named National Player of the Week by several outlets after the wins vs. Tulsa and Northwestern, and Midseason National Player of the Year by Doug Gottlieb, Jay Bilas, Mike DeCourcy and Len Elmore, as well as CollegeInsider.com.\n\nThe Jays opened Valley play in Omaha with a showdown against defending league champ Missouri State. Creighton led at halftime, but couldn't slow down reigning Valley Player of the Year Kyle Weems in the second half. Weems scored a career-high 31 points, and MSU stunned the Jays, 77-65.\n\nThe 0-1 league start put Creighton behind the eight-ball, with a road test at Wichita State on New Year's Eve up next. Just like it did a month earlier in San Diego, Creighton rallied from a double-digit deficit in a hostile environment, topping the defending NIT champs, 68-61.\n\nThe Wichita State win started a season-long 11-game win streak that included an unbeaten January full of highlights.\n\nA Jan. 7 win at Bradley saw McDermott go for a career-high 44 points, including 31 in the second half. Creighton exacted some revenge on Jan. 18th by going to Springfield and beating Missouri State, 66-65, after getting two defensive stops in the final seconds. Creighton raised nearly $30,000 for cancer research on Jan. 28th vs. Bradley, as the team and most of a then-record crowd of 18,436 fans donned pink as part of a “Creighton vs. Cancer” promotion.\n\nA 102-74 win over Illinois State on February 1st improved Creighton to 21-2 on the year and 11-1 in Valley play. The Jays reached as high as 13th in the AP poll (12th in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll).\n\nCreighton's only extended skid of the season came during a seven-day span in early February. UNI's Anthony James hit a three-pointer at the buzzer to beat the Jays on February 4th. Three days later in Evansville, the Purple Aces used a game-ending 13-1 run to top the Jays, 65-57.\n\nCU had an opportunity to right the ship and move into a tie for first-place in the MVC standings when Wichita State came to town on Feb. 11th, but this time the Shockers came out ahead to split the season series, and give CU a rare three-game losing streak.\n\nCreighton headed to Southern Illinois on Feb. 14th, looking to return to its winning ways. CU missed its first and last shots, but turned in a near-flawless performance in-between. The Jays shot a Valley-record 77.5 percent from the field to escape Carbondale with a 88-69 win and abruptly end premature talk of a late-season slump.\n\nCreighton returned home to win back-to-back thrillers, topping Long Beach State (81-79) and Evansville (93-92 in OT) despite leading for a grand total of 0.3 seconds in the second half of both games.\n\nSenior point guard Antoine Young hit the game-winner against Long Beach State, as part of the crowd spilled onto the court in celebration. CU's win against UE was even more improbable, as the Jays trailed by 14 with eight minutes left and needed a deflected tip-in from Gregory Echenique at the buzzer to force overtime. Once in overtime, the Jays survived a rare miss from UE star guard Colt Ryan, who had scored a facility-record 43 points.\n\nThe trend of narrow victories continued in the regular-season finale, as Creighton got a defensive stand in the closing seconds to top Indiana State, 61-60.\n\nCreighton entered the MVC Tournament as the second seed, five games ahead of a five-team logjam of teams that finished 9-9 and tied for third place.\n\nCreighton's first game at Arch Madness came against third-place, but seventh-seeded Drake. The Jays fell behind 12-2 early before rallying for a 68-61 win. One day later, the Jays walloped third-seeded Evansville, 99-71, to reach the finals for the seventh time in 14 years.\n\nThe Jays won their Valley-record 11th MVC Tournament crown a day later with an 83-79 overtime win over Illinois State. The victory secured CU's first NCAA Tournament bid since 2007, and capped a big weekend that saw Echenique be named MVC Defensive Player of the Year, and McDermott sweep Valley Player of the Year and Valley Tournament Most Outstanding Player accolades.\n\nCreighton was awarded a No. 8 seed in the Midwest Region for the NCAA Tournament, where it was paired against No. 9 Alabama.\n\nFor the sixth time this season, the Bluejays overcame a double-digit deficit to win, as Creighton topped the Crimson Tide, 58-57. Once again, the victory required a defensive stand in the closing seconds, as the Jays claimed their first NCAA Tournament win since 2002.\n\nCU's third-round match-up came against the heavily-favored No. 1 seed, North Carolina. Making the challenge even more daunting was that the game took place in the heart of ACC territory in the Tar Heels' backyard of Greensboro, N.C.\n\nCreighton played valiantly, but in the end UNC”s collection of lottery picks was too much, as the Tar Heels advanced to the Sweet 16 with an 87-73 win.\n\nCreighton's 29 wins tied a school-record, first set by the 2002-03 team. Its 10 true road wins tied a school-record, while the 15 wins away from home (10 road, 5 neutral) were a record. CU's 2,772 points were a record for one season as well.\n\nIndividually, McDermott capped what many consider to be the top individual season in school history. He set a school-record with 801 points, and his 307 field goals were also a record that led the nation in 2011-12. He tied the mark for three-point percentage in a season (48.6 percent), and his 22.9 points per game ranked third nationally this season and were the best by a Bluejay since 1969.\n\nMcDermott was named the Lute Olson National Player of the Year by collegeinsider.com, and also picked up First Team All-America honors by the USBWA, NABC and Associated Press. He was one of 10 men named to the John R. Wooden All-America Team, and a finalist for the Wooden and Naismith Awards.\n\nThe team's only scholarship senior, Young earned second-team all-Valley plaudits for a second straight campaign. He was second on the team with 12.1 points and 4.5 assists per game, and finished his career as CU's first player to score at least 1,325 points and dish 500 or more assists.\n\nEchenique paced the MVC in blocked shots for a second straight campaign with 57 swats, and also added 9.7 points and 7.3 rebounds per game\n\nRounding out the starting five were Jahenns Manigat and Grant Gibbs. Manigat led the MVC in league games with 49.2 percent marksmanship from three-point range. Gibbs handed out a league-high 176 assists on the season and paced CU with 37 steals to earn a place on the MVC's All-Newcomer squad.\n\nCreighton would wind up one of five teams nationally to use the same starting five in every game this season, and did not have a single student-athlete miss a game due to injury/sickness/suspension all year long.\n\nThe Bluejays ranked sixth nationally by averaging 16,664 fans per home game, and also ranked in the top-10 in field goal percentage (2nd), assists per game (2nd), three-point percentage (3rd), winning percentage (7th) and wins (10th).\n\nCreighton will bring back four starters and nine lettermen next season. In addition to Young's graduation, the Jays also lose Derek Sebastian, Matthew Dorwart and Ross Ferrarini to graduation.\n\nRadio Broadcast Information\n\nKXSP (“AM 590 - Omaha's ESPN Radio”) broadcast all Creighton men's basketball games during the 2011-12 season. T. Scott Marr and Nick Bahe called most of the action, while Jimmy Motz, Brody Deren, Rob Anderson, Len Gordy and Kevin Sarver also handled analyst duties.\n\nWith the exception of the NCAA Tournament games, the audio was also webcast live at www.AM590espnradio.com.\n\nTelevision Broadcast Information\n\nCreighton had 25 games air on television in 2011-12, which does not include the two exclusive ESPN3.com web-only broadcasts.\n\nCreighton had eight games air on KMTV, five on FSN, four on ESPN2, two on CBS and NET, and one each on ESPNU, BTN, The Mtn. and TBS.\n\nTravis Justice and Nick Bahe served as the KMTV broadcast team.\n\nVideo Webcast Information\n\nCreighton continued to provide a subscription-based video webcast system in 2011-12. Many other games were streamed free of charge as part of the ESPN3 or NET Sports webcast package.\n\nLive Stats Information\n\nAll of Creighton's games this season had free live stats, the second year Creighton teamed with StatBroadcast Systems after nearly 10 years with CSTV's Gametracker software.\n\nHome games could also be followed by those who have mobile devices with internet capability at www.gocreightonstats.com.\n\nUpdates were also provided on the athletic department's Twitter page (@gocreighton).\n\nSummarizing Creighton\n\nCreighton finished the 2011-12 season with a 29-6 record and finished second in the Missouri Valley Conference with a 14-4 mark. The Jays finished the season ranked 19th in the Associated Press poll and 21st in the USA Today/ESPN Top 25 Coaches Poll.\n\nCreighton earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament after winning the State Farm MVC Tournament championship on March 4th.\n\nThe Bluejays tied a school-record with 29 victories and had separate win streaks of seven, 11 and eight during the campaign.\n\nFirst Team All-America forward Doug McDermott led the MVC and ranked third nationally in scoring (22.9). Also named the Larry Bird MVC Player of the Year, McDermott also finished second in the MVC in rebounding (8.2) and three-point percentage (.486). His 801 points were a single-season record at Creighton and the most in the MVC by any player since 1988.\n\nAlso scoring in double-figures was the team's lone scholarship senior, Antoine Young (12.1 ppg., 4.5 apg.). Young was named second-team all-MVC, while center Gregory Echenique (9.7 ppg., 7.3 rpg., 1.6 bpg.) took home MVC Defensive Player of the Year honors.\n\nOn the wings, Gonzaga transfer Grant Gibbs (7.0 ppg., 5.0 apg., 4.5 rpg.) led the MVC with 176 assists, while Jahenns Manigat (6.6 ppg.) led the MVC in three-point percentage at 49.2 percent during league games.\n\nThe Jays finished 14-2 at home, but did their most impressive work on the road. Included in CU's 10-3 true road record were wins at the defending league champs from the Mountain West (San Diego State), Missouri Valley (Missouri State) and Conference USA (UAB), in addition to league runner-ups from the MVC (Wichita State) and Conference USA (Tulsa) and the defending MVC Tournament champs (Indiana State). The Jays also went 5-1 in neutral site games as well.\n\nCreighton finished the season ranked among the national leaders in most offensive categories, including second in field goal percentage (.504), third in three-point percentage (.424), second in assists per game (17.6), ninth in scoring offense (79.2), sixth average home attendance (16,664), and fifth in assist/turnover ratio (1.46).\n\nThe Coaches\n\nGreg McDermott (Northern Iowa, 1988) finished his second season as head coach at Creighton with a 52-22 mark. McDermott has previously been a head coach at Iowa State (2006-10), Northern Iowa (2001-06), North Dakota State (2000-01) and Wayne State (1994-2000). He owns a career mark of 332-217 in 18 seasons and is 201-153 in 11 Division I campaigns. McDermott is assisted by Darian DeVries, Steve Lutz and Steve Merfeld.\n\nMcDermott is 1-4 as a Division I head coach in the NCAA Tournament after this year's appearance. He also made two NCAA Tournament appearances as a Division II head coach at Wayne (Neb.) State in 1999 and 2000. His 2000 team reached the Sweet 16.\n\nPostseason x 15\n\nIncluding this year, Creighton has made the postseason in 15 consecutive seasons, extending the longest streak of postseason bids in MVC history.\n\nThe only eight schools to make the postseason in each of the last 15 years are Creighton, Duke, Florida, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan State and Syracuse.\n\nNCAA Tournament History\n\nCreighton made its 17th NCAA Tournament appearance, and eighth in the last 14 years. The Bluejays are now 10-18 all-time in NCAA action, including a 7-10 record in its first game.\n\nIn 25 NCAA or NIT appearances, Creighton has never won consecutive games in the same event.\n\nMVC vs. SEC\n\nSince 1998, the Missouri Valley and Southeastern Conferences have met up eight times in the NCAA Tourney. The MVC holds a 6-2 edge.\n\nMVC vs. SEC, Since 1994, in NCAA's\n\nYear MVC (Seed) SEC (seed) Rd.\n\n1998 #9 Illinois State #8 Tennessee 1st\n\n1999 #12 Missouri State #4 Tennessee 2nd\n\n2000 #10 Creighton #7 Auburn 1st\n\n2002 #12 Creighton #5 Florida 1st\n\n2002 #11 So.

Creighton, however, is the first program to do it twice (UNI 2010, Creighton 2002 and 2012, Missouri State 1992, Illinois State 1983).\n\nCreighton baseball broadcaster John Bishop's research incdicates that Creighton and Connecticut are the only two schools who have been to the most recent men's soccer, baseball, women's basketball and men's basketball NCAA Tournaments.\n\nCoaching Experience In The Dance\n\nIncluding this season, Creighton's coaching staff boasts a combined 23 Division I NCAA Tournament games under their collective belts as either a player, graduate manager, assistant coach or head coach.\n\nGreg McDermott is 1-4 in NCAA Tournament action, all of it as head coach at Northern Iowa (0-1 in 2004, 2005 and 2006) or Creighton (1-1 in 2012).\n\nSteve Merfeld is 2-3 in NCAA Tournament action, with that coming as a head coach at Hampton (1-1 in 2001, 0-1 in 2002) and as an assistant coach at Creighton (1-1 in 2012).\n\nDarian DeVries is 3-8 in NCAA Tournament action, all of it as an assistant or graduate manager with Creighton (1-1 in 1999, 2002 and 2012; 0-1 in 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007).\n\nSteve Lutz is now 1-1 in NCAA Tournament action, as the 2012 bid was his first appearance in the Big Dance.\n\nHistory As An Eighth Seed\n\nCreighton was an eighth seed for the second time in history this season. The Jays were also seeded eighth in 1981, where it lost to Saint Joseph's by one point.\n\nSince the NCAA began seeding all the teams in 1979, MVC teams are 2-4 as the eighth seed.\n\nSince 1985, No. 8 seed is 54-58 against No. 9 seeds in the NCAA Tournament. However, the No. 8 seeds are 25-19 in the past 11 tournaments vs. the No. 9 seed.\n\nTen different teams seeded No. 8 have made the Sweet 16 since 1985, most recently Butler last season.\n\nNationally, teams seeded No. 8 have combined for two or more wins in each of the last five years.\n\nCombined with Wichita State's No. 5 seed, this is the first time since 1984 that the MVC owned two top-eight seeds in the same tournament.\n\nCreighton's NCAA Tourney Seeds\n\n(since seeding began in 1979)\n\nYear Seed Record\n\n2012 8th 1-1\n\n2007 10th 0-1\n\n2005 10th 0-1\n\n2003 6th 0-1\n\n2002 12th 1-1\n\n2001 10th 0-1\n\n2000 10th 0-1\n\n1999 10th 1-1\n\n1991 11th 1-1\n\n1989 14th 0-1\n\n1981 8th 0-1\n\nAgainst NCAA Opponents\n\nCreighton went 4-2 against teams that made the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Jays were 1-0 against Alabama, San Diego State and Long Beach State, 1-1 against Wichita State, and 0-1 versus North Carolina.\n\nA Few Postseason Nuggets\n\nCreighton's postseason success in recent years has spawned these nuggets:\n\n- Creighton is one of eight schools with a postseason win each of the last five years. That list consists of Creighton, Kansas, Kansas State, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Syracuse and Wisconsin.\n\n- Creighton is one of 12 schools with a postseason win each of the last four years. That list consists of Creighton, Gonzaga, Kansas, Kansas State, Kentucky, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Syracuse, Washington and Wisconsin.\n\nPostseason Features Last-Second Endings\n\nTen of Creighton's previous 11 postseason runs have included a game that was decided in the final seconds.\n\nIn fact, Creighton's postseason openers in the past 11 years have had four games decided by one point (including a double-OT finish), two by two points, two by six points (including an OT finish) and three games by 11 points.\n\nIn 2012, Creighton missed 4-of-5 free-throws in the final 33 seconds, but still defeated Alabama, 58-57. A shot by Alabama guard Trever Releford at the buzzer came up well short, securing CU's first NCAA Tournament win since 2002.\n\nLast year Creighton's season ended in heartbreaking fashion in the CBI title game at Oregon. Creighton had the ball in a tie game with the shot clock off, but committed a backcourt violation on Oregon's unique floor. The Ducks' E.J. Singler then banked in a game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds left. A desperation three-pointer by Creighton was off the mark.\n\nIn 2009, Creighton rallied from a 14-point deficit and would hang on to beat Bowling Green, 73-71 in the first round of the NIT. The Jays needed a last-second defensive stand, as BGSU's Darryl Clements' game-winning three-pointer at the buzzer was off the mark.\n\nThe following game, Creighton led Kentucky by one with 36 seconds left, only to miss two free throws and see UK All-American Jodie Meeks convert a three-point play. CU's Booker Woodfox, the nation's No. 2 three-point shooter, missed an open trey as time expired, and Creighton lost 65-63.\n\nIn 2008, Creighton rallied from a 12-point deficit in the final 3:07 to top Rhode Island, 73-72, in the first round of the NIT. Cavel Witter hit the game-winner with 3.2 seconds left to give CU its first lead of the game since 3-0.\n\nIn 2007, Creighton had the ball for a final shot in a tie game against Nevada in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. Nate Funk's shot attempt missed, and a tip-in try was also not converted. The Jays would eventually lose 77-71 in overtime.\n\nIn second round of the 2006 NIT, Miami (Fla.) guard Guilermo Diaz drained a free throw with 2.6 seconds left to beat Creighton 53-52. A last-second shot attempt by Bluejay senior Johnny Mathies was knocked out of his hands.\n\nIn the 2005 NCAA Tourney, Nate Funk had his three-point try with seven seconds left blocked by Tyrone Sally, and Sally raced downcourt for a breakaway dunk with 2.4 seconds left to give West Virginia a 63-61 win. Funk's three-point try from the corner missed at the buzzer.\n\nIn 2004, Creighton fell 71-70 to Nebraska in the NIT. The Jays led nearly the entire second half before NU's go-ahead basket with 12 seconds left. Nate Funk's game-winning jumper from 18-feet away was blocked by Husker guard Jake Muhleisen.\n\nIn 2003 Creighton lost 79-73 to Central Michigan in the NCAA's. The Jays trailed 50-24 with 16:24 left but a furious rally got them within two points (72-70) with 1:20 left, only to turn it over the next three possessions.\n\nIn the 2002 NCAA's, Creighton beat #15 Florida, 83-82, in Chicago. Terrell Taylor hit a game-winning trey with 0.2 seconds left in double-overtime, his final three of 28 points after a scoreless first half.\n\nTidbits On Creighton\n\n-Creighton and Murray State entered the NCAA Tournament as the nation's only teams with three top-50 RPI wins and 10 true road wins.\n\n-Creighton went 10-3 in true road games this season, setting a school-record for road wins in a season.\n\n-Creighton was nationally-ranked by either the USA Today/ESPN or Associated Press poll 16 different weeks this season.\n\n-Creighton won road games at San Diego State and Wichita State, making it one of six schools with multiple road wins at top-28 RPI opponents entering the NCAA Tournament.\n\n-Creighton was the nation's only team to claim three non-conference wins over the Big Ten.\n\nOn A Roll\n\nCreighton's seven-game winning streak it took into the NCAA Tournament was the third-longest win streak it had ever taken into the NCAA's. Notably, four of the last five times Creighton has entered NCAA action with a streak of six or more wins, it has won its first game.\n\nCreighton Streaks Entering NCAA's\n\nStreak Entering NCAA's Year NCAA Record\n\nWon 9 1961-62 2-1\n\nWon 8 2004-05 0-1\n\nWon 7 1990-91 1-1\n\nWon 7 2011-12 1-1\n\nWon 6 1998-99 1-1\n\nWon 5 1999-00 0-1\n\nWon 5 1980-81 0-1\n\nWon 5 1963-64 1-2\n\nWon 4 1940-41 1-1\n\nWon 4 1988-89 0-1\n\nWon 4 2002-03 0-1\n\nWon 4 2006-07 0-1\n\nWon 3 2001-02 1-1\n\nWon 2 1977-78 0-1\n\nLost 1 2000-01 0-1\n\nLost 2 1974-75 0-1\n\nLost 2 1973-74 2-1\n\nMVC Tournament Recap\n\nCreighton won its record 11th MVC Tournament title with victories over Drake, Evansville and Illinois State on March 2-4 in St. Louis. Doug McDermott was named Most Outstanding Player after scoring 73 points in the three wins, including 33 in the final. Antoine Young and Gregory Echenique also earned all-Tourney accolades.\n\nFather/Son Duos\n\nAccording to the website CollegeHoopedia.com, Doug McDermott is just the sixth man in NCAA history to be named conference player of the year while playing for his father.\n\nJoining them on that elite list are Dick/Mark Acres (Oral Roberts), Dick/Tony Bennett (UW Green Bay), Homer/Bryce Drew (Valparaiso), Press/Pete Maravich (LSU) and Clifford/C.J. Reed (Bethune-Cookman).\n\nDoug McDermott joined Pete Maravich as the only Associated Press first team All-American to be coached by his father.\n\nSecond-Year Coaches Update\n\nGreg McDermott was one of 53 head coaches hired at a new school prior to 2010-11. His 52 wins thus far are the most of those coaches, and he's one of 10 coaches that has taken his new school to an NCAA Tournament.\n\nBelow is a list of the new coaches with 40 or more wins in those two seasons:\n\nSchool Coach 10-11 11-12 Total\n\nCreighton Greg McDermott 23-16 29-6 52-22\n\nIona Tim Cluess 25-12 25-8 50-20\n\nColorado Tad Boyle 24-14 24-12 48-26\n\nOregon Dana Altman 21-18 24-10 45-28\n\nMarshall Tom Herrion 22-12 21-14 43-26\n\nUCF Donnie Jones 21-12 22-11 43-23\n\nUTEP Tim Floyd 25-10 15-17 40-27\n\nNon-Conference Success\n\nCreighton went 15-2 this year in 17 games outside of league play, including a 8-2 record away from home.\n\nThe Bluejays outscored those opponents by an average of 12.7 points per game and outrebounded foes by 5.7 boards per contest.\n\nIndividually, Doug McDermott averaged 24.9 points and 8.6 rebounds per game, making 61.9 percent from the field and 54.7 percent of his three-point attempts.\n\nWorking Overtime\n\nCreighton's 83-79 win over Illinois State on March 5th improved Creighton's all-time record in single-overtime games to 40-38, and improved the Bluejays to 53-44 all-time in overtime contests of any length.\n\nCreighton has now won each of its last four overtime games, and Greg McDermott is 3-0 in OT on the Bluejay sideline.\n\nMcDermott In The Postseason\n\nCreighton coach Greg McDermott made his second postseason appearance at Creighton, and fourth overall as a Division I head coach if you include his time at Northern Iowa.\n\nMcDermott's Division I teams now own a 5-6 record in five postseason appearances, including a 5-3 mark at Creighton.\n\nMcDermott's Division I Postseason Appearances\n\nYear Tourney Postseason W-L\n\n2003-04 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2004-05 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2005-06 (UNI) NCAA 0-1\n\n2010-11 (CU) CBI 4-2\n\n2011-12 (CU) NCAA 1-1\n\nEverybody's All-American\n\nDoug McDermott continues to haul in All-America honors on a regular basis.\n\nHe was named a First Team All-American by the Associated Press, NABC, USBWA, Basketball Times and ESPN.com, and a second-team selection by The Sporting News and CBSSports.com. He was also named to the 10-man John R. Wooden Award All-America team.\n\nPrior to McDermott, the only other player honored by the USBWA with All-America status had been second-team selection Kyle Korver in 2003, and the only prior NABC selections from Creighton had been second-teamer Paul Silas (1964) and third-team selections Benoit Benjamin (1985) and Kyle Korver (2003).\n\nPlayer of the Year!\n\nDoug McDermott was named CollegeInsider.com's Lute Olson National Player of the Year. He was also a finalist for the Naismith and Wooden Award, though Anthony Davis won both awards.\n\nMore Than The Rest\n\nDoug McDermott's 801 points and 22.9 points per game were more than any other player in the “Big Dance”. Second on that list of NCAA Tourney players is Lehigh's CJ McCollum, who scored 766 points and 21.9 points per game.\n\nMcDermott's 801 points ranked second-nationally in 2011-12 and his 22.9 points per game was third.\n\nJays Remain In AP & Coaches Polls\n\nAfter a two-week absence, Creighton returned to both top-25 polls on February 27th. The Jays finished 19th in the Associated Press poll and 21st in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll.\n\nCreighton has now been in the Associated Press poll 13 of the last 16 weeks. Its' No. 13 ranking on Jan. 30th was Creighton's highest ranking since being 12th on Feb. 10, 2003.\n\nCreighton has now been in the USA Today/ESPN Coaches poll in 16 of the past 18 weeks. The Jays' No. 12 rank on Jan. 30th was the highest ranking since being 12th on Feb. 10, 2003.\n\nCreighton's highest rankings in school history are ninth in the coaches poll and 10th in the AP poll. Both came on Jan. 20, 2003.\n\nFor the sake of Creighton's records and consistency, the school recognizes the Associated Press poll, which can be found on page 165 of the Creighton men's basketball media guide.\n\nOffense Wins Championships?\n\nCreighton once again ignored the saying that “Defense wins championships” this season. The Bluejays led the MVC in scoring offense this season, averaging 79.2 points per game, and won the MVC Tournament.\n\nSince 1997-98, seven of the 15 teams to lead the league in scoring offense went on to win the MVC Tournament (Drake in 2008, ILS in 1998, CU in 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2012).\n\nBy comparison, only two teams that led the league in scoring defense won the MVC Tournament (SIU in 2006, UNI in 2010).\n\nGoing On The Offensive\n\nSpeaking of offense, Creighton ranked second nationally in field goal percentage at 50.39 percent, mere percentage points behind Missouri (50.44).\n\nMcDermott Named MVC Player of the Year\n\nDoug McDermott became the first sophomore in league history to be named Larry Bird MVC Player of the Year.\n\nMcDermott leads The Valley and ranks third nationally with 22.9 points per game and is also ranked second in the conference in both rebounding (8.2 rpg.) and three-point percentage (.486).\n\nMcDermott's five MVC Player of the Week accolades were the most by any individual in a season in 25 years (since National Player of the Year Hersey Hawkins in 1988), and the only sophomores in league history with more points in a season are Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird.\n\nMcDermott is the first Creighton player named MVC Player of the Year since Booker Woodfox in 2009, and fifth different Bluejay overall, a group that also includes Bob Harstad (1989), Chad Gallagher (1991), Kyle Korver (2002 and 2003), and Woodfox (2009).\n\nMcDermott's honor gives Creighton six MVC Player of the Year awards, tying Bradley and Southern Illinois for most all-time.\n\nHe is the first player to be named MVC Player of the Year from a non-championship team since Kyle Korver in 2002-03.\n\nHe is just the second player in MVC history to be named both MVC Freshman of the Year (2011) and MVC Player of the Year (2012) in a career, joining Southern Illinois' great Ashraf Amaya (1990 FOY and 1992 POY).\n\nEchenique Named MVC's Top Defender\n\nJunior center Gregory Echenique became the first player in Creighton history to be named MVC Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nEchenique led the MVC with 57 blocked shots this season and was second with 1.6 blocks per game. He was also fifth in the MVC with 7.3 rebounds per contest, and second with 60.7 percent shooting from the field.\n\nIn league play, Echenique led the MVC with 1.7 blocks per game and 2.8 offensive rebounds per game, while also ranking second in rebounds per game (8.2) and field goal percentage (.630), fifth in defensive rebounds per contest (5.3) and 10th in free throw percentage (.811).\n\nOscar, Bird, Doug\n\nLast year Doug McDermott set a Creighton (and MVC) record for points by a freshman with 581. This season, McDermott had 801 points, the most single-season points in school history by any player.\n\nMcDermott's 1,382 points are the most in school history by a player in their first two seasons, passing Bob Portman (1,195). According to STATS Inc., the only other players since 1996-97 with at least 1,382 points or more by the end of their sophomore season have been Davidson's Stephen Curry (1,661 points from 2006-08), Eastern Washington's Rodney Stuckey (1,438 points from 2005-07) and VMI's Keydren Clark (1,497 points from 2002-04).\n\nHe's also just the third sophomore in MVC history to reach 800 points in a season, and trails only Oscar Robertson and Larry Bird on that list. His 801 points rank 10th-most in MVC single-season history and were the most by any Valley player since 1988.\n\nBelow is a list of the most prolific sophomore scorers in MVC history, as well as the top single-season scorers in Creighton history (all classes):\n\nTop Sophomore Scorers, MVC History\n\nPts.

The 1990 Northern Iowa grad McDermott also holds the honor of being the first coach in league history to win an MVC Tournament title at his alma mater.\n\nSeven Out Of 14 Tourney Titles\n\nCreighton owns seven league tournament titles in the last 14 years. On a national basis, the only schools that can claim this are Duke (10), Gonzaga (10), Winthrop (9) and Creighton (7).\n\nCreighton's 11 all-time Valley Tournament titles are more than twice as many as the next closest school, Southern Illinois (5).\n\nWon By One\n\nCreighton won its NCAA Tournament game vs. Alabama by a thin 58-57 margin. The Bluejays went 4-0 in one-point games this winter after going 0-1 a year ago.\n\nCreighton also went 2-0 this year in games decided by exactly two points after going 0-3 last season in games decided by two points.\n\nAfter going 1-6 in games decided by three points or less last year, the Bluejays were 7-1 in games decided by three points or less this year.\n\nGood To The Last Shot\n\nCreighton took the lead on its final shot of the game to win back-to-back contests vs. both Long Beach State (Feb. 18) and Evansville (Feb. 21). Incredibly, Creighton won both times despite leading for a combined 0.3 seconds in the second half of those games.\n\nThe last time Creighton had won consecutive games on its final shot came on Nov. 24 and 30 of 2004, when Tyler McKinney hit game-winners to beat Ohio State and Xavier.\n\nRecords Fall in St. Louis\n\nCreighton set numerous records in St. Louis during the MVC Tournament. Doug McDermott's 33 points in the final tied the most in CU history in the event, and were also the most of any player in a title game since it moved to St. Louis.\n\nMcDermott's 73 points in the event were a school-record, and his 24 field goals made matched a program record as well.\n\nMcDermott also set Creighton's career-mark for three-point accuracy at the event (min. 4 att.). He's 9-for-16 in his career from downtown in St. Louis, good for 56.3 percent.\n\nIn addition, Josh Jones shot 4-of-5 from the field vs. Evansville from three-point range, matching a single-game record.\n\nDoubling Up\n\nCreighton's Doug McDermott joined some elite company at the 2012 MVC Tournament after taking home Most Outstanding Player honors.\n\nHe is just the fifth player in league history to be named MVC Player of the Year and MOP of the league tournament, joining Drake's Adam Emmenecker (2008), Creighton's Kyle Korver (2002 and 2003), Southern Illinois' Chris Carr (1995) and Bradley's Hersey Hawkins (1988).\n\nRunning Down A Record\n\nCreighton scored 2,772 points this season, most in program history. Creighton's 2002-03 team scored 2,688 points in 34 games to own the previous mark.\n\nRoad Trippers\n\nCreighton had 10 road wins and five victories on a neutral site this year.\n\nIncluding this season, each of Creighton's last nine NCAA Tournament teams have won 10 or more games away from home.\n\nCreighton and Murray State were the only school in the country with three top-50 wins as well as 10 true road wins.\n\nCreighton's 10 true road wins are a school-record, breaking the mark of nine originally set in 1999-91.\n\nRare Bird\n\nDoug McDermott's averages of 22.9 points and 8.2 rebounds per game, combined with his shooting percentages of 60.1 percent overall, 48.6 percent from three-point range and 79.6 percent from the line are something you usually only see in a video game.\n\nMcDermott was the nation's only player to average better than 19 points per game who also shot better than 53 percent from the field.\n\nSince 2008-09, no other player nationally had averaged more than 20 points per game while shooting 48.0 percent from three-point range, regardless of the number of attempts.\n\nMcDermott became one of two sophomores nationally since 2004-05 to average 22.0 points and 8.0 rebounds per game or more. The other player to do that came in 2008-09 and was former Oklahoma and current Los Angeles Clippers standout Blake Griffin. Griffin had 90 dunks in his sophomore season, while McDermott owned one dunk this year (at Bradley).\n\nUpping The Antoine\n\nSenior point guard Antoine Young ascended up a few Creighton charts. He is the only Bluejay in history with at least 1,325 points and 425 career assists.\n\nHe finished 17th on Creighton's all-time scoring chart, and his 505 assists rank third-most in Bluejay annals.\n\nMost Career Points\n\nRank Pts.

John C. Johnson (Omaha) leads that list with 1,526 points, while Schuyler product Gene Harmon (1,369) is second on the list.\n\n20-Win Seasons\n\nCreighton earned its 24th 20-win season in program history, and its 29 wins tied the school record. Here's a look at Creighton's teams with 20 or more wins.\n\nPrevious 20-Win Seasons, Sorted By Wins\n\nW-L Season Postseason?\n\n29-5 2002-03 NCAA (0-1)\n\n29-6 2011-12 NCAA (1-1)\n\n27-8 2008-09 NIT (1-1)\n\n24-8 2000-01 NCAA (0-1)\n\n24-8 1990-91 NCAA (1-1)\n\n23-5 1921-22 --\n\n23-7 1973-74 NCAA (2-1)\n\n23-9 2001-02 NCAA (1-1)\n\n23-10 1999-00 NCAA (0-1)\n\n23-11 2004-05 NCAA (0-1)\n\n23-16 2010-11 CBI (4-2)\n\n22-7 1963-64 NCAA (1-2)\n\n22-9 1998-99 NCAA (1-1)\n\n22-11 2007-08 NIT (1-1)\n\n22-11 2006-07 NCAA (0-1)\n\n21-5 1961-62 NCAA (2-1)\n\n21-7 1976-77 NIT (0-1)\n\n21-9 1980-81 NCAA (0-1)\n\n21-12 1989-90 NIT (0-1)\n\n20-7 1974-75 NCAA (0-1)\n\n20-9 2003-04 NIT (0-1)\n\n20-10 2005-06 NIT (1-1)\n\n20-11 1988-89 NCAA (0-1)\n\n20-12 1984-85 --\n\nCelsius or Fahrenheit ?\n\nSophomore Jahenns Manigat led in the MVC in league play with his 49.2 percent marksmanship from three-point range. When it came to CU's nine MVC road games, he was the barometer.\n\nIn Creighton's seven Valley road wins, Manigat shot a robust 19-of-27 (70.4 percent) from downtown. In CU's two Valley road losses, Manigat was 2-of-9 (22.2 percent) from deep.\n\nWish Granted\n\nGrant Gibbs poured in a career-high 20 points in Creighton's MVC Tournament finals victory vs. Illinois State. Though he had scored in double-figures on nine previous occasions, he had never scored more than 12 points before March 4th.\n\nGibbs finished the title game with 20 points, seven rebounds, five assists and no turnovers. He is Creighton's only player in the past 25 years with at least a 20-7-5 line and no turnovers in a game.\n\nMcDermott Claimed Fifth MVC Honor\n\nDoug McDermott won his fifth MVC Player of the Week award on Feb. 20th after he averaged 27.0 points and 7.5 rebounds in wins over Southern Illinois and Long Beach State.\n\nHis five awards are the second-most in MVC history for a single-season, trailing only the six won by Bradley's Hersey Hawkins in 1987-88 when Hawkins went on to earn National Player of the Year acclaim.\n\nMcDermott was also named Dick Vitale's National Player of the Week on Feb. 20th, the second time this season he's been honored by Vitale.\n\nSenior Group\n\nCreighton honored four men who suited up in their final home game on Feb. 21st; Antoine Young, Matthew Dorwart, Derek Sebastian and Ross Ferrarini, as part of Senior Night festivities.\n\nDuring the past four years, the Jays went 97-46 while appearing in the postseason every season and claiming a share of the 2008-09 MVC regular-season title.\n\nOf the quartet, Young owns the most accomplishments on court. The Bellevue, Neb., native is the only player in school history with 1,325 points and 425 assists. He led the MVC in assist/turnover ratio as both a sophomore and junior, and last season also paced The Valley in assists per game en route to earning second-team all-MVC honors.\n\nA native of Sidney, Neb., Dorwart finished up his fourth year with the program. He played in 28 games as a Bluejay, amassing 11 points, eight rebounds and three blocked shots. Off the court he was part of a film crew that produced the award winning documentary “Mato Oput”, which focused on the civil war in Uganda during the past 20 years.\n\nSebastian hails from Loveland, Colo., and played on the wing. He played in 25 games during his four years in the program, producing 12 points, seven rebounds and four assists. When he's not on the court, Sebastian has spent this semester student-teaching at Omaha North High School.\n\nFerrarini is a guard from Omaha in his third year in the program after transferring in from Nebraska in 2009. One of the team's top threats from long-range, Ferrarini owned 17 points and six rebounds in 45 career minutes played over the course of 24 games. Nicknamed “The Godfather”, he's twice had the hoop that gave the Jays 75 points and earned the home crowd free Godfather's Pizza.\n\nLosses Can Teach Lessons Too\n\nThough Creighton was upset in its Feb. 7 game at Evansville, it didn't necessarily mean horrible things were ahead. Including this year, six of the last seven seasons that Evansville has beaten Creighton, the Jays have recovered to win either the MVC Tournament or regular-season title, as seen below:\n\nDate UE Score MVC Title?\n\n02/07/12 L 57-65 Tournament\n\n02/13/08 L 56-60 --\n\n12/22/04 L 61-63 Tournament\n\n01/22/03 L 66-74 Tournament\n\n01/24/01 L 52-61 Reg.-Season\n\n01/23/00 L 83-88 Tournament\n\n01/04/99 L 79-84 Tournament\n\nHeading Towards The Top 10\n\nUntil Doug McDermott took third this season at 22.9 ppg., the MVC hadn't had a player rank in the top-10 nationally in scoring since Illinois State's Tarise Bryson finished fourth in 2000-01 at 22.8 points per contest.\n\nMcDermott's third-place finish was the best by an MVC player since Bradley's Hersey Hawkins scored a nation-leading 36.3 points per game in 1987-88.\n\nCenturyLink Center Omaha Dramatics\n\nAntoine Young's bucket with 0.3 seconds left vs. Long Beach State on Feb. 18th made him the first player in CenturyLink Center Omaha history with two game-winning scores.\n\nCreighton is now 6-2 in games with a go-ahead score in the final 10 seconds in the nine-year old facility.\n\nCreighton's Go-Ahead Scores in Wins, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n11/26/05 Dayton W 91-90* Funk FG :5.7\n\n01/28/06 Wichita St. W 57-55 Tolliver FG :0.0\n\n11/25/06 George Mason W 58-56 Watts FT :7.5\n\n03/18/08 Rhode Island W 74-73 Witter 3FG :3.2\n\n01/13/10 Southern Illinois W 71-69 Young FG :1.3\n\n02/18/12 Long Beach St. W 81-79 Young FG :0.3\n\n*double-overtime\n\nOpponent Go-Ahead Scores in CU Losses, Last 10 Seconds\n\nDate Opponent Score Player/Score Time\n\n03/20/06 Miami (Fla.) 53-52 G.

His 36 points were the most in CenturyLink Center Omaha history for any game that didn't reach overtime.\n\nThe two highest-scoring games in Creighton history in the building came when Cavel Witter scored 42 points in a double-OT win over Bradley on March 1, 2008, while Nate Funk had 38 points in a Nov. 26, 2005 double-OT triumph over Dayton.\n\nIn a Feb. 21 overtime game vs. Evansville, Purple Aces guard Colt Ryan had a building record 43 points. The previous high by a Bluejay opponent had been 34, done twice previously (Dayton's Brian Roberts & Northwestern's Drew Crawford).\n\nHome Sweet Home\n\nCreighton is 65-16 all-time in MVC games at CenturyLink Center Omaha, including a 9-0 mark vs. Evansville.\n\nAn overtime win on Feb. 21st vs. Evansville guaranteed the fifth straight season Creighton has finished exactly 7-2 in league play at home, and eighth time in those nine years it's been 7-2 or better in Valley play at home.\n\nLights Out Shooting\n\nIn its Feb. 14 road game in Carbondale, Creighton missed its first shot and its last shot, but just seven others in between to set an MVC record by making 77.5 percent from the field (31-40).\n\nThe mark easily eclipsed the previous school-record of 70.4 percent (Nov. 25, 2011 vs. Campbell) and also outdid the previous MVC record of 74.5 percent by Bradley vs. West Texas State (Jan. 28, 1984).\n\nCreighton's marksmanship was the best by any college team since 2005, and tied for the 20th-best mark in NCAA history for one game.\n\nLights Out Shooting, Part II\n\nCreighton shot a season-best 75 percent (15-20) in the first half on Feb. 14th at Southern Illinois, its best half since shooting 18-of-23 in the second half at Drake on Jan. 9, 2007.\n\nThe stellar performance lasted about an hour before CU made 16-of-20 shots in the second half (80 percent).\n\nThe 80 percent effort in the second half is tied for the eighth-best figure in MVC history for one half.\n\nThe Valentine's Day win marked the first time in program history that Creighton shot 70 percent or better in both halves of the same game.\n\nLights Out Shooting Part III\n\nCreighton owned two of the top-three single-game shooting marks nationally in 2011-12.\n\nIn addition to its 77.5 percent shooting on Feb. 14th, third on that list is Creighton's 70.4 percent accuracy vs. Campbell on Nov. 25th, which was just behind the 71.4 percent shot by Middle Tennessee in its win at UCLA on Nov. 15th.\n\nIn the last 15 years (since 1997-98), the only three teams to shoot 70 percent or better twice in the same season have been Creighton (2011-12), Rice (2006-07) and Utah State (2004-05).\n\nLights Out Shooting, Part IV\n\nOne reason Creighton shot at a record rate on Feb. 14th was its proficiency from three-point range.\n\nCreighton's 12-of-14 shooting (85.7 percent) from three-point range was a school record and ranks tied for ninth-best in NCAA history for a team with at least 10 makes from deep.\n\nCreighton is also the only team nationally in the last 15 years to make 10 or more three-pointers in a game in which it shot 76 percent or better from the floor as a team.\n\nFull House\n\nCreighton finished sixth nationally, averaging 16,664 fans per home game in 2011-12. It's the sixth straight season that CU has been among the nation's top-25 in average home attendance, and an MVC average home attendance record.\n\nCreighton surpassed 200,000 home fans in a season for the sixth time. No other school in the history of the MVC has ever done so even once.\n\nLast year Creighton averaged 13,507 fans per home game, which ranked 22nd nationally. The program ranked 14th at the end of the regular-season with an average of 15,026 before four CBI home games brought down the average.\n\n2011-12 Attendance Leaders (Final)\n\nRk.

He handled the ball for a total of 1:23 of actual game time.\n\nWhen Kansas standout forward Thomas Robinson played North Dakota on Dec. 31st, he had 30 points, 21 rebounds and four assists. Robinson had the ball in his hand for a total of 2:50.\n\nWhen Weber State point guard and national scoring runner-up Damian Lillard faced Northern Arizona on Jan. 10th, Lillard had 18 points, six rebounds and six assists. He had the ball in his hand for 7:13 of game time.\n\nSports Illustrated Profiles McDermott\n\nKelli Anderson of Sports Illustrated spent four days with the Bluejays in late January/early February for a feature on Bluejay sophomore Doug McDermott.\n\nHer four-page article, which includes four photos, can be found on pages 54-57 of the Feb. 13, 2012 edition that features Eli Manning on the cover.\n\nIt's Up, And It's Good\n\nDoug McDermott led the nation with 307 field goals made this season. That is a school record, passing Bob Portman's 303 buckets in 1967-68.\n\nBy comparison, no other player in the MVC had more than 199 buckets (Colt Ryan), and next closest nationally was Oakland's Reggie Hamilton with 281.\n\nSophomore's Streak Reaches 36\n\nDoug McDermott has scored in double-figures in 36 straight games, CU's longest stretch since Vernon Moore's streak of 46 straight games from Jan. 30, 1984 to March 5, 1985.\n\nCU's Top 10+ Point Streaks, Since 1981-82\n\nNo. Name Dates\n\n46 Vernon Moore Jan. 30, 1984 - Mar. 5, 1985\n\n36 Doug McDermott April 1, 2011-Present\n\n32 Bob Harstad Feb. 24, 1990-Feb. 25, 1991\n\n31 Benoit Benjamin Mar. 8, 1984 - Feb. 20, 1985\n\nMultiple Weapons From Downtown\n\nBoth Ethan Wragge and Jahenns Manigat drained five three-pointers in its Feb. 14 win over Southern Illinois. In school history, it marked just the fourth time that multiple men had five or more triples in the same game.\n\nIt first happened on Feb. 21, 1989 when Matt Roggenburk and Todd Eisner did it vs. Montana State.

Tech Sr. 20.6\n\nLong-Distance Streak Alive\n\nCreighton has made at least one three-pointer in a league-best 609 straight games since a 59-53 loss at Illinois State on Feb. 20, 1993. That's the longest active streak in the MVC, and longest streak in Valley history.\n\nGibbs > Receiving\n\nThough he's not even his own team's point guard, Grant Gibbs was second in the MVC with 5.0 assists per game and owned a league-high 176 assists. He had six or more assists in 15 different games this season.\n\nNo game shows his importance more than a Dec. 31 win at Wichita State. With Gibbs in the game, Creighton outscored the Shockers 50-25, compared to being outscored 36-18 without him.\n\nCreighton is 26-2 in its last 28 games when one of its players has six or more assists in a game, including a 21-1 mark this winter.\n\nGame Tested\n\nSenior Antoine Young played in 142 games as a Bluejay, second-most in school history. Below is a list of the all-time Creighton leaders in games played:\n\nGP Name Years\n\n143 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2006-11\n\n142 Antoine Young 2008-12\n\n135 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n130 Dane Watts 2004-08\n\n128 Bob Harstad 1987-91\n\n128 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\nThis Is, 20/20\n\nGreg McDermott is the only coach in Creighton history to post 20 or more wins in each of his first two seasons. McDermott, who won 23 games last season, claimed his 20th win this season on Jan. 28 vs. Bradley.\n\nIf you include his last three years at UNI (2003-06), he's won 20 or more games each of his last five years in the MVC.\n\nThe only other coaches to win 20 or more games in five straight seasons while in the MVC was Creighton's Dana Altman (11 from 1998-99 to 2008-09), Bradley's Chuck Orsborn (6 from 1956-57 to 1961-62) and Oklahoma State's Henry Iba (6 from 1943-44 to 1948-49).\n\nAt season's end, McDermott was one of three active MVC coaches to start his Valley career with two straight 20-win seasons, and first since Illinois State's Tim Jankovich did it his first three years (2007-10).\n\nSouthern Illinois' Chris Lowery also began his career with three-straight 20-win campaigns from 2004-07.\n\nMcDermott's 29 wins this season are his most in 11 years as a Division I head coach.\n\nMind-Boggling Road Stats\n\nCredit MVC PR guru Mike Kern with this doozy of a road stat. Entering the postseason, two MVC teams Creighton and Wichita State each owned 10 true road wins. By comparison, the only BCS-member school with more than eight true road wins was Syracuse (9).\n\nIt Went Up To 11\n\nCreighton's 11-game win streak earlier this season was tied for eighth-longest in school history. Below is a list of CU's longest win streaks:.\n\nLongest Win Streaks\n\nW's Dates Postseason?\n\n38 Feb. 22, 1917 - Feb. 11, 1920 --\n\n17 March 25, 1942 - March 4, 1943 NIT/NIT\n\n16 Jan. 31, 1928 - Jan. 23, 1929 --\n\n14 Jan. 3-Feb. 21, 1925 --\n\n14 Jan. 2 - Feb. 22, 1975 NCAA\n\n12 Jan. 21 - March 1, 1922 --\n\n12 Nov. 22, 2003 - Jan. 11, 2004 NIT\n\n11 Jan. 27 - March 3, 2001 NCAA\n\n11 Jan. 27 - March 6, 2009 NIT\n\n11 Dec. 31, 2011 - Feb. 1, 2012 NCAA\n\n10 Jan. 18-Feb. 19, 1927 --\n\n10 Jan. 27 - March 12, 1962 NCAA\n\n10 March 9 - Dec. 20, 1963 NCIT/NCAA\n\n10 Jan. 22 - Feb. 22, 1974 NCAA\n\n10 Nov. 17 - Dec. 29, 2002 NCAA\n\nMcDermott Up For An Oscar, Sort Of\n\nCreighton forward Doug McDermott was among 20 players selected by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association for its 2012 Oscar Robertson Trophy Midseason Watch List.\n\nMembers of the association's board of directors chose the players to be included on the list as contenders for the Oscar Robertson Trophy, to be presented to the national player of the year by its namesake in New Orleans at the USBWA's College Basketball Awards Breakfast on March 30.\n\nMcDermott ranks in the top-10 nationally in scoring (22.9) and field goal percentage (.601) for Creighton, which was 29-6. He was also a finalist for the Naismith and Wooden Awards.\n\nKind of a Big Deal\n\nCreighton played in 13 road games this season. Ten of the 13 schools to host the Bluejays set a season-high in that venue for home attendance, all but Tulsa, Evansville and Southern Illinois.\n\nDate Opponent CU Crowd Previous High\n\n11/16/11 UAB 4,417 --\n\n11/30/11 San Diego State 12,414* 12,414\n\n12/10/11 Saint Joseph's 4,200* 4,200\n\n12/19/11 Tulsa 4,228 4,360\n\n12/31/11 Wichita State 10,506* 10,466\n\n1/7/12 Bradley 8,610 7,777\n\n1/13/12 Illinois State 8,771 5,333\n\n1/18/12 Missouri State 9,124 8,601\n\n1/25/12 Drake 6,110 5,876\n\n2/4/12 Northern Iowa 6,910 6,834\n\n2/7/12 Evansville 5,128 9,640\n\n2/14/12 Southern Illinois 3,408 4,272\n\n2/25/12 Indiana State 6,790 7,911\n\n*sold out\n\nMore Road Streaks\n\nBefore losing on Feb. 4 at UNI, Creighton had won six straight road games for the first time since 1975. Below is a list of Creighton's road win streaks of six or longer:\n\nLongest Road Win Streaks\n\nStreak Dates\n\n14 Feb. 14, 1942 - Dec. 20, 1945\n\n11 Feb. 26, 1917 - Feb. 27, 1919\n\n8 Jan. 10, 1925 - Jan. 16, 1926\n\n7 Jan. 27 - Dec. 1, 1962\n\n7 Jan. 31, 1928 - Jan. 19, 1929\n\n6 Jan. 2 - Feb. 15, 1975\n\n6 Dec. 19, 2011 - Jan. 25, 2012\n\nThe Road Less Traveled\n\nAfter going 6-21 in true road games the previous two seasons, Creighton went 10-3 in true road games this year. This year the Bluejays started 5-0 in league road games for the first time since 1942-43, when the program finished 5-0.\n\nIn 13 road games this season, Creighton shot an impressive 49.8 percent from the floor.\n\nDoug McDermott averaged 24.1 points and 8.1 rebounds per game in those 13 tilts, making 24-of-43 shots from three-point range (55.8 percent).\n\nRoad Warriors\n\nCreighton went 10-3 in true road games this season, with road wins at last year's Mountain West champ (San Diego State), Conference USA champ (UAB), MVC champ (Missouri State), Conference-USA runner-up (Tulsa) and MVC runner-up (Wichita State). CU has also won at Bradley, Illinois State, Drake and defending MVC Tournament champ Indiana State.\n\nThis year marked the first time in program history the Bluejays had been 8-1 or better on the road.\n\nCreighton's 10 true road wins this season far surpasses its total of six combined true road wins over the previous two seasons.\n\nIncluding this year, each of Creighton's last nine NCAA Tournament teams have won 10 or more games away from home, and eight of those teams had a winning record in true road contests.\n\nEntering the postseason, only six teams nationally owned two true road wins vs teams ranked in top-28 of the RPI; Creighton, New Mexico, Ohio State, Michigan State, Duke and Kansas.\n\nJays Reach 20 Wins, Again\n\nCreighton reached the 20-win milestone for the 13th time in 14 years with a win vs. Bradley on Jan. 28.\n\nThe win, which came on Jan. 28th, was the earliest (by calendar) the team has ever won 20 games, just ahead of the 2002-03 squad (Feb. 4).\n\nBelow is a list of the nation's most 20-win seasons since 1998-99.\n\nMost 20+ Win Seasons, Last 14 Years\n\nSeasons School 2011-12 W-L Next Game\n\n14 Syracuse 34-3 --\n\n14 Duke 27-7 --\n\n14 Kansas 32-7 --\n\n14 Gonzaga 26-7 --\n\n14 Florida 26-11 --\n\n13 Kentucky 38-2 --\n\n13 Creighton 29-6 --\n\n13 Kent State 21-12 --\n\n13 Texas 20-14 --\n\n13 Xavier 23-13 --\n\n13 Utah State 21-16 --\n\n10 Conference Wins x 16\n\nThis season's Creighton team has extended its MVC record by winning 10 or more league games for a 16th consecutive season.\n\nOn a national basis, the only other current school with at least 16 straight years of 10 or more league wins is Kansas (18), including this season.\n\nCancer Awareness Raises $$$\n\nCreighton raised more than $29,600 in an auction in conjunction with its Jan. 28 Creighton vs. Cancer game vs. Bradley.\n\nThe Bluejays wore special-edition pink Nike jerseys for the game, in addition to special shooting shirts in warm-ups that honor those affected by cancer.\n\nFans had the chance to bid on a jersey/shooting shirt for each player, with the highest bid going for the #00 combination ($3,275). Six of the jerseys went for $1,000 or more.\n\nDroppin' 30\n\nDoug McDermott scored 33 points on March 4th vs. Illinois State, his sixth outburst of 30 points or more this season. That's the most by a Bluejay in one season since Bob Harstad had eight such games in 1989-90.\n\nIn the last 25 years, the following men have scored 30 or more points in a game for Creighton.\n\nCareer 30+ Point Games, Since 1987-88\n\nNo. Name Years\n\n12 Bob Harstad 1987-91\n\n7 Doug McDermott 2010-Present\n\n5 Rodney Buford 1995-99\n\n4 Rod Mason 1987-88\n\n3 Nate Funk 2002-07\n\n3 Chad Gallagher 1987-91\n\n2 Kyle Korver 1999-03\n\n2 Duan Cole 1987-92\n\n1 Matt Petty 1992-93\n\n1 Johnny Mathies 2003-06\n\n1 Kenny Lawson Jr. 2006-11\n\n1 Cavel Witter 2007-10\n\n1 P'Allen Stinnett 2007-10\n\nField Day\n\nCreighton finished second in the nation in field goal percentage, and had a better shooting percentage than the opposition in 28 of its 29 wins this year. The five times the opposition has had a better field goal percentage, the Jays lost.\n\nOverall, the team with a better field goal percentage has won 39 of CU's last 41 games.\n\nCreighton was 18-0 this season when shooting 50 percent or better from the floor.\n\nMcDermott Scored 44\n\nSophomore Doug McDermott scored a career-best 44 points in Creighton's win at Bradley on Jan. 7th. It was nine more than his previous best, and included 31 points after halftime.\n\nMcDermott made his first 10 shots after halftime and was 18-of-23 for the game to tie the record for field goals made by a Bradley opponent. His 18 field goals were one shy of the Creighton record for field goals in a game, and the most by a Bluejay since Benoit Benjamin in 1985.\n\nMcDermott's 44 points were the most nationally by any sophomore since Akron's Derrick Tarver had 44 points vs. Wright State on Dec. 30, 2003.\n\nOnly four sophomores in MVC history have ever scored more points in a league contest than McDermott's 44 points. Oscar Robertson (Cincinnati) had two 50-point games, while other players to do it once each were Indiana State's John S. Williams (47), Wichita State's Dave Stallworth (46) and Indiana State's Larry Bird (45).\n\nRebounding Ruler\n\nDoug McDermott ranked second in the MVC with 8.2 rebounds per game, just 1.5 behind Illinois State's Jackie Carmichael. The only Creighton player to ever lead the MVC in rebounds per game was Bob Harstad (9.4) in 1988-89.\n\nMcDermott was the first Bluejay to average more than 7.4 rebounds per game since 1993-94, when Nate King averaged 9.0 rebounds per game.\n\nThis year's Creighton team outrebounded foes by 5.5 caroms per contest, the first time since 1998-99 (+5.8) it's had a rebound margin of better than 4.0 per game.\n\nThe Avengers\n\nTwelve different programs combined to hand Creighton its 16 losses last season. While the Jays did not face Iowa State, BYU, Oregon or Akron this year, they've done rather well against the other eight teams to beat them a year ago.\n\nAgainst those eight teams (Northwestern, Nebraska, Missouri State, Wichita State, Indiana State, Northern Iowa, Bradley, Drake), Creighton went 13-2 this season after going a combined 5-11 last year vs. those same foes.\n\nAfter Another Record\n\nLast year Doug McDermott set an MVC freshman record with 581 points, and this season he's got 801.\n\nMcDermott is just the third player in MVC history with 500 or more points as both a freshman and sophomore, joining Mitchell Anderson (Bradley) and John S. Williams (Indiana State). McDermott is the first player in Valley history with 550 points or more as both as freshman and sophomore.\n\nIn Creighton history, the only other players with multiple seasons of 500 or more points are Paul Silas (3), Bob Harstad (3), Rodney Buford (3), Rick Apke (2), Bob Portman (2), Chad Gallagher (2) and Nate Funk (2).\n\nWinning The Close Ones\n\nCreighton's 66-65 win on Jan. 18th helped show the difference between this year's team and last year's squad.\n\nLast year in Springfield, Creighton led nearly the entire game before giving up a lay-up in the final 15 seconds to lose, 67-66.\n\nThis year in Springfield, Creighton got a pair of defensive stops in the final 10 seconds to earn a 66-65 victory.\n\nThis year's club was 7-1 in games decided by three points or less, while last year's team was just 1-6 in such situations.\n\nNear The Top Of His Class\n\nSophomore Doug McDermott owns 1,382 career points in his young career. According to research by Creighton Sports Information's office and STATS Inc., that leads all active sophomores, and is the most by any player at the end of their sophomore season since Davidson's Stephen Curry from 2006-08.\n\nMost Career Points, Active Sophomores\n\nSource: Creighton Sports Information/STATS Inc.\n\nRk.

Barnes fell just short of joining McDermott on the first team, earning honorable-mention accolades.\n\nHere's a look at the two sophomores and how they've performed in college:\n\nName McDermott Barnes\n\nGames Played 74 75\n\nPoints 1,382 1,228\n\nPPG 18.7 16.3\n\nRebounds 568 414\n\nRPG 7.7 5.5\n\nFG-FGA 527-930 439-1017\n\nFG% .567 .432\n\n3FG-3FGA 101-227 116-332\n\n3FG% .445 .349\n\nFT-FTA 227-293 234-319\n\nFT% .775 .734\n\nShades of 2003\n\nCreighton's 29-6 season reminded some fans of the program's 2002-03 squad that finished 29-5 and spent most of the season in the national rankings.\n\nHere's how the 2011-12 club compares to the 2002-03 team, as well as how standout forwards Doug McDermott and Kyle Korver compare:\n\nStat 2011-12 2002-03\n\nW-L Record 29-6 29-5\n\nHome W-L 14-2 17-0\n\nRoad W-L 10-3 7-4\n\nFG 975-1935 974-1956\n\nFG Pct. .504 .498\n\n3FG 287-677 270-693\n\n3FG Pct. .424 .390\n\nFT 535-737 470-678\n\nFT Pct. .726 .693\n\nReb.

The Jays are now 130-23 at the nine-year old facility, which includes a 65-16 mark in MVC games and a 30-9 record in games decided by five points or less.\n\nCreighton has averaged 14,453 fans in the 153 games, including 18 crowds of 17,000 or more.\n\nWhat's Your Twenty?\n\nCreighton has been .500 or better after 20 games in each of the last 17 seasons, including this season.\n\nEven more impressive, Creighton has won 13 of its first 20 games in 14 of the last 15 seasons.\n\nCreighton -- First 20 Games, Last 17 Years\n\nYear First 20 W-L Final W-L Postseason\n\n2011-12 18-2 29-6 NCAA\n\n2010-11 13-7 23-16 CBI\n\n2009-10 10-10 18-16 CIT\n\n2008-09 15-5 27-8 NIT\n\n2007-08 14-6 22-11 NIT\n\n2006-07 13-7 22-11 NCAA\n\n2005-06 15-5 20-10 NIT\n\n2004-05 13-7 23-11 NCAA\n\n2003-04 17-3 20-9 NIT\n\n2002-03 18-2 29-5 NCAA\n\n2001-02 14-6 23-9 NCAA\n\n2000-01 14-6 24-8 NCAA\n\n1999-00 14-6 23-10 NCAA\n\n1998-99 14-6 22-9 NCAA\n\n1997-98 14-6 18-10 NIT\n\n1996-97 10-10 15-15 ---\n\n1995-96 11-9 14-15 ---\n\nOver .500, Again\n\nCreighton has been better than .500 in either the first or second-half of the league season in 33 straight trips through the league, including both halves this year.\n\nCreighton's 32 consecutive halves above .500 in league play is easily the Valley's longest active streak, with Wichita State next closest at eight.\n\nHere's how Creighton's teams have fared in the various halves of the MVC season since 1995-96. Notably, Creighton was 8-1 at the midway mark for the first time since 2002-03.\n\nYear 1st Half 2nd Half\n\n2011-12 8-1 6-3\n\n2010-11 5-4 5-4\n\n2009-10 5-4 5-4\n\n2008-09 5-4 9-0\n\n2007-08 5-4 5-4\n\n2006-07 6-3 7-2\n\n2005-06 7-2 5-4\n\n2004-05 5-4 6-3\n\n2003-04 7-2 5-4\n\n2002-03 8-1 7-2\n\n2001-02 8-1 6-3\n\n2000-01 5-4 9-0\n\n1999-00 5-4 6-3\n\n1998-99 6-3 5-4\n\n1997-98 5-4 7-2\n\n1996-97 5-4 5-4\n\n1995-96 4-5 5-4\n\nTotal 99-54 (.647) 103-49 (.678)\n\nJays Win 10 Home Games, Again\n\nWith a Jan. 21 win vs. Indiana State, Creighton has now won 10 or more home games in 16 straight seasons.\n\nThe current streak extends a school-record, four more than the previous standard of 12 straight seasons from the 1969-70 season to the 1980-81 campaign with 10 or more home wins.\n\nHistorically After 12 MVC Games\n\nCreighton was 11-1 in the MVC after the 12th game of the league slate.\n\nThis is the 17th straight season that Creighton has had a league record of .500 or better after 12 games, and each of those campaigns the Jays would also go .500 or better in its final six contests as well.\n\nYear W-L After 12 W-L Final 6\n\n2011-12 11-1 3-3\n\n2010-11 6-6 4-2\n\n2009-10 7-5 3-3\n\n2008-09 8-4 6-0\n\n2007-08 7-5 3-3\n\n2006-07 9-3 4-2\n\n2005-06 9-3 3-3\n\n2004-05 6-6 5-1\n\n2003-04 9-3 3-3\n\n2002-03 11-1 4-2\n\n2001-02 10-2 4-2\n\n2000-01 8-4 6-0\n\n1999-00 7-5 4-2\n\n1998-99 7-5 4-2\n\n1997-98 8-4 4-2\n\n1996-97 7-5 3-3\n\n1995-96 6-6 3-3\n\nTotal 136-68 (.667) 66-36 (.647)\n\nShooting Stars\n\nCreighton finished second in the country in field goal percentage, making an incredible 50.4 percent from the field.\n\nThe Bluejays shot 55 percent or better 13 times overall this season.\n\nIn Creighton's last 41 games dating to late last season, it has shot 40 percent or better in all but two games.\n\nCreighton, which finished third in the country in three-point percentage, was seeking to join Northern Arizona (in 1998-99) as the only teams in NCAA history to lead the nation in three-point percentage and field goal percentage in the same season.\n\nMcManus To The Hall\n\nFormer Creighton men's basketball coach John J. “Red” McManus will be inducted into the Omaha Sports Hall of Fame on April 19th.\n\nMcManus went 138-118 as head coach of Creighton from 1959-69, and mentored All-Americans Paul Silas and Bob Portman, among others. He remains close to the program to this day and regularly attends home games and the State Farm MVC Tournament.\n\nAlso joining the Hall of Fame will be Lyell Bremser, Al Caniglia, Tom Jaworski, Kelly Lindsay, Erick Strickland and the 1982 Omaha Westside football team.\n\nMidseason Honors\n\nDoug McDermott was named Midseason National Player of the Year by four of the most prominent college basketball experts nationwide. He earned the nod from Mike DeCourcy of The Sporting News, as well as from ESPN experts Jay Bilas, Len Elmore and Doug Gottlieb.\n\nChairman of the Board\n\nCreighton center Gregory Echenique had 10 or more rebounds in six of Creighton's last 21 games, and averaged 8.2 boards in that span.\n\nCreighton is 10-1 all-time when Echenique collects 10 or more rebounds and 12-1 when he scores 15 or more points.\n\nCreighton was also 17-4 this season and is 27-10 in his career when he blocks two shots or more.\n\nDouble-Digit Deficits, No Problem\n\nCreighton overcame a 36-25 second half deficit to beat Alabama on March 16th, the sixth time this year it's won a game after previously trailing by double-digits.\n\nCreighton also won after trailing by 17 at San Diego State and by 12 at Wichita State, a home game vs. UNI when down by 11, a home game after being down 14 to Evansville, and a neutral game after trailing by 10 to Drake.\n\nCreighton has fallen behind by 10 points or more 35 times in CenturyLink Center Omaha history.

He's the second Creighton player this season to surpass the milestone, as Antoine Young reached that feat on Dec. 10 at Saint Joseph's.\n\nYoung & McDermott are the first Bluejay teammates to go over 1,000 in the same season since Ryan Sears & Ben Walker in the Jays' 2000-01 campaign.\n\nWhile it's unknown how many games it's taken every player in school history to get to 1,000 points, it is known that Paul Silas needed 47 games to reach 1,000.\n\nBefore McDermott, the only previous players in Creighton history to score 1,000 points or more in their first two seasons were Bob Portman (1,195), Paul Silas (1,124), Rod Mason (1,023) and Rodney Buford (1,010).\n\nHere's a look at how many games it took Creighton's last 12 players to reach 1,000 career points.\n\nGames To 1,000 Points, Last 12 Bluejays\n\nName Games to 1,000 pts.

He averaged 10.7 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.0 assists per game.\n\nHis week was highlighted by his first career double-double, as he had 10 assists and tied a career-best with 12 points in a win at Illinois State on Jan. 13th.\n\nJays Duo Earn MVC Weekly Awards\n\nDoug McDermott was named MVC Player of the Week for the fourth time this season on Jan. 9th after a week that saw him average 34.0 points and 7.5 rebounds per game in two wins.\n\nMcDermott had 24 points on his 20th birthday on Jan. 3 in a win vs. Drake. He then had a career-high 44 points in a victory at Bradley, making 18-of-23 shots from the floor in a nine-point win. His 44 points are sixth-most in CU history, the most in the nation this year, and the most nationwide by any sophomore since 2003.\n\nMcDermott also earned the National Jesuit Basketball Spotlight Player of the Week for the second time in three weeks.\n\nIn addition, Grant Gibbs was also named MVC Newcomer of the Week. Gibbs averaged 8.5 points, 5.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds a week ago. He began his week with eight points, seven rebounds and five assists in a 17-point win over Drake. He then had nine points, six assists and two rebounds at Bradley on Jan. 7th.\n\nHealthy Half\n\nAs a team, Creighton made its first 11 field goals to start the second half at Bradley on Jan. 9th, not missing until a Grant Gibbs three-point try went awry at the 10:44 mark.\n\nFor the game, Creighton shot 61.1 percent, its best mark on the road since shooting 61.9 percent at Wichita State on Feb. 16, 2005.\n\nEarlier this season Creighton made its first 13 field goal attempts of the game in a win vs. Campbell.\n\nAnother Arena Record Falls\n\nOn Dec. 19, Doug McDermott's 35 points at Tulsa tied a Reynolds Center record for an opponent at the 13-year old facility. On Jan. 7th McDermott claimed another house record, as his 44 points were a Carver Arena mark for an opponent in the 30-year old building.\n\nIn fact only two players have ever scored more against Bradley than McDermott's 44…Detroit's Archie Tullos (49) in 1988 and Cincinnati's Oscar Robertson (46) in 1960. McDermott's 44 points were the most in Peoria by a Bradley opponent since The Big O, and the most ever in a win over Bradley.\n\nSpeaking of arena records, Creighton's 28 assists (on 33 baskets) were the most by a Bradley opponent at Carver Arena. An incredible 17 of McDermott's 18 field goals were assisted, as four different players (Grant Gibbs, Jahenns Manigat, Antoine Young, Josh Jones) had three or more assists to McDermott alone.\n\nOf McDermott's 18 baskets, he used the backboard in 11 of them and used his left hand for five hoops.\n\nFresh 15\n\nDoug McDermott scored 15 or more points in 17 different halves this season, including 31 in the second half at Bradley on Jan. 9th. The Bluejays have gone on to win each contest in which he's scored 15 or more in any half.\n\nBelow is the most points in any half by a Bluejay individual this year:\n\nPts.

By comparison, CU made 40 percent or better from deep in just 15-of-39 contests a year ago.\n\nNot Half Bad\n\nCreighton trailed by 39-31 at halftime on Dec. 31 before outscoring Wichita State 37-22 in the second half and pull out a seven-point road win.\n\nUnder second-year head coach Greg McDermott, the Bluejays are 43-1 when outscoring their foe after halftime.\n\nYoung Follows His Elders\n\nSenior point guard Antoine Young is the only player in Creighton history with more than 1,325 points and 500 career assists. Here's a look at how he compares in his career to some of his point guard predecessors:\n\nName Young Dotzler McKinney Sears\n\nGames 142 117 110 124\n\nStarts 107 96 97 124\n\nPoints 1,342 422 570 1,311\n\nPPG 9.5 3.6 5.2 10.6\n\nAssists 505 388 430 570\n\nAPG 3.6 3.3 3.9 4.6\n\nTurnovers 229 200 188 252\n\nA/TO Ratio 2.21 1.94 2.29 2.03\n\nSteals 101 196 119 283\n\nSPG 0.71 1.68 1.08 2.29\n\nMin./Game 26.9 23.0 26.5 33.7\n\nPassing Fancy\n\nGrant Gibbs had 10 assists at Tulsa on Dec. 19, then added 12 helpers vs. Northwestern three days later. In the win over Northwestern, Gibbs' 12 assists led to 32 points by his Creighton teammates.\n\nHis 12 assists were a CenturyLink Center Omaha single-game record, rank tied for sixth-most in a game in Creighton history for all venues, and most since Tyler McKinney also had 12 on Dec. 21, 2002.\n\nGibbs became the first Bluejay with consecutive games of 10 or more assists since Duan Cole did it on Jan. 27 & 30, 1990.\n\nSophomore Snipers\n\nThree sophomores on the 2011-12 Creighton basketball team rank among the most nine most accurate shooters in school history in three-point field goal percentage.\n\nDoug McDermott is third on that list at 44.5 percent for his career, just behind MVC Players of the Year Booker Woodfox (45.5%) and Kyle Korver (45.3%) and fifth on Creighton's all-time chart. Ethan Wragge is ninth on the list at 41.5 percent, while Jahenns Manigat (43.3 percent) is in sixth place.\n\nThree-Point Field Goal Percentage, Career\n\n(min. 100 attempts)\n\nRk. 3% Name 3FG-3FGA Years\n\n1. .455 Booker Woodfox 147-323 2007-09\n\n2. .453 Kyle Korver 371-819 1999-03\n\n3. .445 Doug McDermott 101-227 2010-Pres.\n\n4. .441 Rod Mason 132-299 1986-88\n\n5. .440 Nerijus Karlikanovas 48-109 1998-00\n\n6. .433 Jahenns Manigat 100-231 2010-Pres.\n\n7. .431 Michael Lindeman 62-144 2000-04\n\n8. .430 Duan Cole 176-410 1987-92\n\n9. .415 Ethan Wragge 146-352 2009-Pres.\n\n10. .407 Nate Funk 200-492 2002-07\n\nJones'ing For MVC Play\n\nJosh Jones opened MVC play with 11 points off the bench on Dec. 28 vs. Missouri State, making 3-of-4 three-point shots. Jones then pumped in eight points in the second half of Creighton's win at Wichita State.\n\nPicking up his production for Valley games is nothing new for the junior from Omaha Central. In his career, he's shot 12-of-55 (21.8 percent) from three-point range prior to MVC play, a figure that improves drastically to 53-of-127 (41.7 percent) in league action.\n\nWeekly Honors Roll In\n\nGrant Gibbs and Doug McDermott were both honored on Dec. 26th by the MVC for their work in wins vs. Tulsa and Northwestern.\n\nGibbs was named MVC Newcomer of the Week after averaging 11.0 assists, 7.5 rebounds and 6.0 points per game. With 10 assists at Tulsa and 12 assists vs. Northwestern, he became the first Bluejay since 1990 with consecutive games of 10 or more assists.\n\nMcDermott was named MVC Player of the Week after averaging 31.0 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.5 assists per game. He scored a career-high 35 points in the win at Tulsa and scored 27 points in 28 minutes vs. Northwestern.\n\nMcDermott also earned National Player of the Week accolades from the USBWA, Dick Vitale, and Andy Katz of ESPN.com for his performance.\n\nScoring In Numbers\n\nDoug McDermott owned 801 points in 35 games, an average of 22.9 per contest that ranked him third nationally in scoring.\n\nMcDermott's 22.9 points per game rank fourth-most in CU single-season history and were the most since Bob Portman averaged 26.2 points per game in 1968-69.\n\nPortman, who finished fifth nationally in scoring in 1967-68 (29.5 ppg.), was the only previous Bluejay to ever rank in the top-10 of the year-end scoring leaders.\n\nMcDermott's 22.9 points per game made him the first MVC player over 20 points per game since Illinois State's Tarise Bryson (2000-01) and the most by a MVC player since Northern Iowa's Randy Blocker (23.0 ppg.) in 1993-94. Bryson had been the only MVC player since 1989 to rank in the top-five nationally in scoring.\n\nNo Bluejay had averaged more than 20 points per game since Bob Harstad's 22.2 average in 1989-90.\n\nBasketball Royalty\n\nCreighton was the only team in the nation with three non-conference wins vs. the Big Ten this season.\n\nThis is the first time that Creighton has defeated three Big Ten teams in the same season in program history.\n\nIn three games against Big Ten competition this year, Doug McDermott averaged 25.3 points, 8.7 rebounds while shooting 29-44 from the floor (65.9 percent) and 7-of-11 from downtown (63.6 percent).\n\nB1G Ten, Big Time\n\nCreighton went 3-0 against the Big Ten this winter, including home wins vs. both Northwestern and Nebraska. This is the first year Creighton has hosted two games against Big Ten competition in the same season since 1936-37.\n\nUnbelievably, Creighton had hosted just one Big Ten team since 1973 (Iowa in 1999) before this year's slate.\n\nDoug vs. Others After 74 Games\n\nDoug McDermott has started all 74 games of his career and will enter 2012-13 with 1,382 career points (18.7 ppg.) and 568 career rebounds (7.7 rpg.).\n\nBy comparison, Creighton's all-time leading scorer, Rodney Buford, had 1,286 career points after 74 games. However, Buford had “just” 1,010 points at the end of his sophomore season (59 games, 17.1 ppg.).\n\nMcDermott also compares favorably to legendary big men Bob Harstad and Chad Gallagher at this point. Harstad finished his career ranked second in CU history with 2,110 career points and 1,126 rebounds, while Gallagher is third with 1,983 points and fifth with 891 rebounds.\n\nThrough 74 Career Games\n\nName Points Rebounds\n\nDoug McDermott 1,382 568\n\nRodney Buford 1,286 391\n\nBob Harstad 1,051 665\n\nChad Gallagher 1,037 453\n\nKyle Korver 893 338\n\nTriple-Double Threat?\n\nCreighton has never had a player with a traditional point-rebound-assist triple-double, but Grant Gibbs is getting closer.\n\nThe junior guard had nine points, seven rebounds and 10 assists on Dec. 19 at Tulsa. He also had 12 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds on Jan. 13 at Illinois State.\n\nGibbs is the first player since at least 1988-89 to have single-game highs of 10 or more points, 10 or more assists and 10 or more rebounds in the same season.\n\nCreighton owns three triple-doubles in school history, all by Benoit Benjamin in 1985. All three were of the point-rebound-blocked shot variety.\n\nAll I Wanted For Christmas Is 10 Wins\n\nCreighton got to the Christmas break with a 10-1 record. In 94 seasons of basketball, this was just the third campaign that the Jays reached 10 wins before Christmas.\n\nThe Jays were 10-1 in 1963-64 and 10-2 in 2008-09 heading into Christmas.\n\nFountains of Doug\n\nDoug McDermott owned 20 or more points 24 times this season and 27 of his last 41 games overall dating to late last season.\n\nMcDermott owned two different stretches where he's scored 25 points or more in four straight games this year. He did it from Nov. 16-30 earlier this year, as well as Dec. 10-22. The last Bluejay with five consecutive games of 25 or more was Benoit Benjamin, who did it in five straight games (Jan. 17-Feb. 2, 1985), a span in which he had 43, 45, 31, 26 and 29 points.\n\nMcDermott, who owned 15 different games of 25 points or more this season, was the first Bluejay with 10 different games of 25 or more points in the same year since Bob Harstad had 15 games like that in 1989-90.\n\nHow To Stop Him?\n\nLeave it to Doug McDermott's father/coach and his roommate to explain the task of trying to slow him down.\n\n“He's difficult to stop in that he scores a lot of different ways,” his coach and father Greg McDermott said. “It's not just on the block, it's not just from the 3-point line, he can slash and score as well. In a lot of his post-up opportunities, the ball is gone before you can even think about double-teaming him. He's difficult to guard because of his versatility, and he has a lot of people scratching their heads trying to stop him. And the good news for us is that he's doing it within the framework of our offense and he's not taken bad shots.”\n\n“Doug's ability to score from just about anywhere on the floor is what amazes me,” guard Jahenns Manigat said. “He has amazing hands and he finishes well. And when he steps back and knocks down a 3, that's when you can see the full extent of his game.”\n\nDon't Take Our Word For It\n\nEx-Tulsa coach Doug Wojcik was similarly impressed after Doug McDermott scored a career-high 35 on Dec. 19. Here's an excerpt of Wojcik's post-game opening statement:\n\n“I tell you what, that was one impressive performance by Doug McDermott. I thought the guy single-handedly broke the spirit of my team. In particular, my three seniors and sophomore post players. He was terrific...My goodness, it really surprised us how good McDermott was, particularly in the post against size, how good his strength is, how good his stamina is, how good his feet are, and how good of hands he has. He was very impressive to me, tonight.”\n\nDish Network\n\nGrant Gibbs turned in an unusual stat line in a Dec. 19 victory over Houston Baptist.
