        "text": "Retired Jersey Numbers\n\nBASEBALL\n\n#1 Ray Tanner (1997-2012)\n\nRay Tanner served as head coach for the Gamecock baseball program for 16 seasons and wore No. 1 from 2002-12. Tanner led South Carolina to back-to-back NCAA Division I Baseball Championships in 2010 and 2011 as well as a pair of national runner-up finishes, six College World Series appearances, three SEC championships, six SEC Eastern division titles and a SEC tournament crown. He went to 10 NCAA Super Regionals in 14 NCAA Tournament appearances as well. Under the direction of Tanner, South Carolina’s postseason success from 2010-2012 is arguably the greatest run in collegiate baseball history. In the three-year span, the Gamecocks established NCAA records with 22 consecutive postseason wins and 12 consecutive wins in the College World Series. Tanner was named Athletics Director for the University of South Carolina on July 13, 2012. Tanner went 738-316 at South Carolina. His winning percentage for the Gamecocks was .700, the second highest winning percentage in SEC history.\n\n#13 Earl Bass (1972-75)\n\nEarl Bass was a two-time ABCA First-Team All-American (1974-75) and holds the school record with a career win-loss record of 34-3. He also has the school record for career shutouts (10) and earned run average (1.34). He set a then-national record by winning 23 consecutive games over two seasons. He set a school freshman record with a 1.50 ERA. He was inducted into the USC Lettermen’s Hall of Fame in 1989 and was an SEC Legend at the 2017 SEC Baseball Tournament. He lost his battle with cancer on Feb. 4, 2018, at the age of 65.\n\nMEN’S BASKETBALL\n\n#3 B.J. McKie (1996-99)\n\nRetired on December 28, 2005. McKie is the school’s all-time leading scorer with 2,119 points and he is the only Gamecock to score more than 2,000 points in a career. He helped lead the Gamecocks to the school’s first ever SEC Championship with a 15-1 record in the 1996-97 campaign.\n\n#11 John Roche (1968-71)\n\nRoche’s number, 11, was retired after a successful three-year tenure from 1968-71. Roche made one or more of the recognized All-America team in each of his three seasons. Roche holds USC records for three-year career point average (22.5) and points in a game, scoring 56 vs. Furman his senior year.\n\n#22 Alex English (1972-76)\n\nRetired after his senior season of 1976, the number 22 worn by Alex English was the last USC jersey number to be retired. English was a consensus All-American at South Carolina and is second on the USC all-time scoring list with 1,972 points. English started every game in a four-year span (111) and was a 52.8% shooter from the field in the process.\n\n#42 Grady Wallace (1955-57)\n\nWallace, who wore 42, was the first South Carolina player to have his jersey number retired. Wallace averaged an amazing 28.0 points per game in his career and led the NCAA in 1957 with 31.3 points per tilt, edging out Kansas’ Wilt Chamberlain. Wallace holds down four of the top six scoring games in school history, scoring 54 points vs. Georgia in his senior year.\n\n#43 Kevin Joyce (1970-71)\n\nThe third number retired in USC history was number 43 of Kevin Joyce. Joyce scored 1,400 points in his three years at South Carolina, averaging 20.4 points per game as a senior. Joyce, though, may be best known for out-jumping UNC’s Lee Dedmon (6-10) with four seconds left in the 1971 ACC Tournament title game, tapping the ball to Tom Owens for the winning bucket. Joyce was a member of the 1972 U.S. Olympic team.\n\nWOMEN’S BASKETBALL\n\n#13 Martha Parker (1985-89)\n\nParker averaged 13.9 points and 5.9 rebounds a game and ranks fifth on the all-time South Carolina scoring list with 1,728 career points was named to the All-American team on three occasions, including a first-team honor in 1988-89. Parker is second on the all-time steals list with 284. Parker started all but two games in her South Carolina career (122 starts in 124 games).\n\n#14 Shannon Johnson (1992-96)\n\nA 5-7 guard from Hartsville, S.C., Shannon Johnson is South Carolina’s second-leading scorer of all time with 2,230 career points, and is the only Gamecock ever to average more than 20 points per game for three consecutive seasons, as she averaged 23.5 points per game in her sophomore year of 1993-94, 23.9 points per game as a junior in 1994-95 and a school-record 24.7 points per game as a senior in 1995-96. Her career average of 20.4 points per game is also a school record by a wide margin. A three-time all-SEC performer, Johnson earned All-America recognition from the Associated Press in 1995-96 and was a finalist for the Wade Trophy.\n\n#53 Sheila Foster (1978-82)\n\nA 6-1 center-forward, Sheila Foster rewrote the South Carolina women’s record book during her tremendous career at USC and many of her records still stand today. The school’s all-time leading scorer with 2,266 points, Foster established herself as one of the dominant power forwards in collegiate basketball. The native of Spartanburg, South Carolina, started every game (134 games) during her four years. In addition, Foster holds the distinction of being the Gamecocks’ all-time leading rebounder 1,427 rebounds. During her four years, Foster averaged 16.9 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. As a senior, she averaged her career high of 20.2 points and 10.9 boards per game.\n\nFOOTBALL\n\n#2 Sterling Sharpe (1983, 85-87)\n\nSharpe, wore #2, is the school’s all-time leading receiver with 169 catches for 2,497 yards and 17 touchdowns. Sharpe had his jersey retired following the 1987 regular season. He became only the second Gamecock to have his jersey retired while he was still active at the school. In fact, both Sharpe and George Rogers played in the Gator Bowl in their final collegiate game. Sharpe was a number one draft pick by the Green Bay Packers.\n\n#37 Steve Wadiak (1948-51)\n\nWadiak wore #37 for Carolina and was the first to have his number retired after a tragic automobile accident claimed his life. Wadiak, who still appears throughout the South Carolina record book, was the school’s all-time rushing leader for 28 years after his senior season.\n\n#38 George Rogers (1977-80)\n\nProbably the school’s most well known player was also USC’s Heisman Trophy winner – George Rogers. He had his #38 retired during halftime ceremonies at Carolina’s final 1980 home game. Rogers was the first USC player to have his jersey retired while still active at the school.\n\n#56 Mike Johnson (1964)\n\nCenter Mike Johnson, #56, became gravely ill before the start of his junior season, and the illness cut short a potentially great football career. Johnson had finished his sophomore campaign as the regular center. When he died in 1965, his number was retired.\n\nSOFTBALL\n\n#11 Trinity Johnson (1995-97)\n\nTrinity Johnson was a three-time NFCA All-American, earning the Honda Award, Fastpitch World and U.S. Olympic Committee National Softball Player of the Year in 1996-97. During the 1997 season, she was also the SEC Female Athlete of the Year, the SEC Softball Pitcher of the Year, unanimous First-Team All-SEC selection, three-time SEC Pitcher of the Week and two-time NFCA National Player of the Week. She continues to hold 11 school records and was inducted into the USC Lettermen’s Hall of Fame in 2004.\n\nJoyce Compton (1987-2010)\n\nInducted into the National Fastpitch Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2002, Compton was instrumental in the Southeastern Conference adopting softball as a sport in the mid 1990’s. Once established, Compton’s teams won four Eastern Division titles, two SEC Tournament trophies and the 1997 SEC Championship, the first season of the league’s existence. Her record at South Carolina closed at 951-486-4 (.661), the winningest coach in South Carolina Athletics history. Under her guidance, 11 Gamecocks earned a total of 21 All-America plaques, 28 earned 62 All-Region honors, while 12 garnered 15 All-SEC honors over the first 14 years of conference play. One player won the Honda Award, which goes to the most outstanding player in softball. Twice, Compton coached the SEC Player of the Year, while she mentored the SEC Female Athlete of the Year once. The matriarch of SEC softball, Compton twice was named the SEC Coach of the Year, while she earned five Region Coach of the Year awards at South Carolina. Her teams performed well in the classroom as well, with 142 SEC Academic Honor Roll selections coming since 1997.\n\nMEN’S TRACK & FIELD\n\nTerrence Trammell (1998-00)\n\nTerrence Trammell was a 13-time All-American, six-time NCAA champion and an eight-time SEC champion during his Gamecock career. He was a silver medalist in the 110-meter hurdles at the 2000 and the 2004 Olympics and a seven-time World Championships medalist, including two gold medals. He was voted the 1999 SEC Athlete of the Year and won the 1999 Cliff Harper Trophy as the SEC Championships leader in points scored. He was inducted into the USC Lettermen’s Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nWOMEN’S TRACK & FIELD"
