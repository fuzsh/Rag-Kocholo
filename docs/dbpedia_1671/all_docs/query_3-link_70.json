Coach Jack Curtice (Cactus Jack), who two years earlier was hired to revive the fortunes of Gaucho football, led his fired-up, take-no-prisoners team to a regular season 8-1 mark and a berth in the Camellia Bowl where the Gauchos played Los Angeles State in the college division western regional championship. Defying overwhelming odds against ever reaching this plateau, Coach Curtice, a Gaucho Hall of Famer, was named the college division Coach of the Year, and his extraordinary team -- although losing to the Diablos, 18-10 in Sacramento -- took its place in history.\n\nTeam Members: Jim Barber, Corky Barrett, Gary Bianchini, Bob Blindbury, Terry Bommer, Dick Booth, John Boyle, Dick Burrill, Gary Cline, Bob Cordero, Jim Coward, Steve Ford, Jason Franci, Tony Goehring, Mel Gregory, Doug Hayes, Greg Heer, Preston Hensley, Bob Heys, Bruce Hitchcock, Mike Hitchman, George Jenkins, John Keever, Dick Kezirian, Allan LaRoche, Ted Maneki, Al Martens, Ron Moser, Fred Oppezzo, Jim Orear, Mike Patitucci, Jack Smith, Larry Swarbrick, Mike Thomas, Paul Vallerga, Jim Wankum, Bart Weitzenberg, Scott Williams, Ernie Zomalt.

Then one day in the fall of 1964, Donn R. Bernstein plunked down his typewriter in an office near the entrance to Robertson Gym and became the oracle of Gaucho sports. The campus was never quiet again. Bernstein had been a journalist in the Bay Area, where a football contest was not just a game, it was a Big Game, and he brought that attitude to sleepy Santa Barbara. He was UCSB's first Sports Information Director. He churned out press releases and features. He cajoled the media to come out and cover the Gauchos. He got to know every UCSB athlete. If you wore the Blue and Gold, you became part of Bernie's family forever. It may not have been a coincidence that Bernie's second year, the Gaucho football team piled up victories and earned an invitation to the Camellia Bowl. Bernie's stay in Gaucho land lasted for eight glorious years, ending with the tragic demise of the football program. But Bernie was ready for the big time, and the University of Washington made him the Husky sports publicist. Seattle was never the same again. Bernie eventually heeded a higher calling from ABC sports. He helped produce the biggest college football games every week on national TV. That job took him to a place that God invented so he'd have a suitable place to live- New York City. Until recently, Bernie retained ownership of his legendary cabin on Del Playa Drive. He would make regular visits and entertain his Gaucho Family. He never forgot them. And they'll never forget him. In 1982, Donn Bernstein was induced into the CoSIDA (College Sports Information Directors of America) Hall of Fame.

He never scored a touchdown, hit a home run, served an ace or assisted on a goal, but for nearly 30 years, he was one of the most valuable members of virtually all Gaucho teams. When an injury ended his football career at Western Michigan University, Harry chose to devote his professional career to athletic training. After earning his master's degree while working as an assistant athletic trainer at the University of Utah, he moved to Santa Barbara and the rest is history. Harry was UCSB's first career Certified Athletic Trainer. His level of dedication to the student athlete was unsurpassed. While some are more comfortable with paper work and administrative duties, Harry was more comfortable helping student-athletes. Whether he was taping ankles, rehabilitating or evaluating an injury, or just getting to know them better, he preferred to be with the athletes. Harry understood the demands and the ins and outs of each athlete's particular sport. He would adjust his taping, bracing and rehabilitation style to fit that athlete. If he needed to improvise to get the job done, then he did so. This was just another form of his devotion to the university and its student-athletes. Harry was responsible for upgrading the facilities and staffing of the UCSB Athletic Training Room. He is highly respected by his peers, coaches, athletes and community. In fact, there were few, if any athletes who came through UCSB during his time that were not touched in some way by Harry Callihan. The athletic training facility at UCSB is now and will always be the Harry Callihan Athletic Training Room.\n\nNick Carter\n\nTrack & Field Head Coach (1934-67)\n\nSeven of his athletes placed in the top six at the NCAA and AAU National Championships...Javelin thrower, Delf Pickarts, was UCSB's first Division I All-American under Carter's direction in 1951...His 1951 team went unbeaten in conference...Responsible for organizing the Gaucho Track & Field Club in 1958...A 1928 U.S. Olympian in the 1,500m.\n\nSam Cathcart\n\nBoxing, Football, Track & Field (1946-48)\n\nOutstanding Football Award winner in 1947 and 1948...An all-conference selection in football in 1947 and 1948...A member of the boxing team in 1947...Played pro football for the San Francisco 49ers (1949-50, 1952).\n\nIgnacio Caudillo\n\nBasketball (1939-41)\n\nA member of one of UCSB's most successful basketball teams...First postseason National Championship Tournament Invitation...Three-year starter...Returned to graduate following a distinguished military service\n\nScott Cerny\n\nBaseball (1985-86)\n\nA 1986 all-American as a second baseman...Tabbed the 1986 Big West Co-Player of the Year...Named to the all-district first team in 1986...Named to the All-West Regional team in 1986...An All-Big West Conference First Team pick in 1986...Listed among the top-10 in UCSB's record books in the following categories: single season batting average (4th, .403 in 1986), hits in a season (4th, 91 in 1986), triples in a season (1st, 8 in 1986), runs scored in a season (3rd, 71 in 1986), and career triples (5th with 10)...Played professionally in the Angels organization.\n\nDave Chapple\n\nFootball (1965-68)\n\nInducted 2010\n\nSelected First Team All-American by the Sporting News and Pro Football Weekly as a punter in 1968...Holds UCSB record for points in a career with 123...Holds Gaucho records for most points after touchdown in a career (84), single season (31), and game (eight)...Set UCSB records for most field goals in a career (13), single season (nine), and game (two)...His career average of 41.8 yards per punt for 126 punts is the highest in UCSB history...Set single season punting average record at 42.5 yards per kick in 1966...Finished third in the nation in scoring in 1966...His 75 yard punt on Sept. 14, 1968, at UTEP is the longest in school history...Was the first punter drafted in the 1969 NFL Draft...During his seven-year NFL career, he played with the Buffalo Bills, Los Angeles Rams, and New England Patriots...In 1972, as a member of the Los Angeles Rams, he led the NFL in punting at 44.2 yards per kick and played in the 1973 Pro Bowl...Selected to the UPI, NEA, NFC, Sporting News, and Pro Football Weekly All-Pro Teams in 1972...Had the NFL's longest punt in 1972 - 71 yards...Holds NFL record for highest net punting average - 42.1 yards - for a single season.\n\nClark J.
