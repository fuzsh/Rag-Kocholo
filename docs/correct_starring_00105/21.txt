Gojira vs Godzilla

The old Godzilla movies vs those newer versions. (The full 30+ list of films). After seeing the 2014 film at the beginning of this year and really liking it,I have decided to watch some other Godzilla films. Since there’s about 30 films (and one more soon to come in July), I’ll only be doing a few of them at this moment. I most certainly have the original 1954 film on my agenda.

Godzilla (1998)

5 out of 10 Eye-Rolling Stars 🌟

1998 Science Fiction film. Starring: Matthew Broderick, Kevin Dunn, Hank Azaria, Vicki Lewis, Jean Reno and Maria Pitillo.

Short Synopsis: Nuclear testing in the South Pacific produces a giant mutated lizard that wreaks havoc upon New York City.

First a note of how long we see Godzilla in this movie. This 1998 version, out of 2 hours and 20 minutes, we see Godzilla for 11 minutes and 18 seconds (or so says this YouTube video below). And according to some comments in the video for the 2014 Godzilla film, the 1954 film and 2014 film both had a total of about 9 minutes of Godzilla scene time (although the 2014 also had the MUTO monsters too).

This video will have spoilers (as will my review), but then I think that watching this movie is not worth watching. So I suggest watching the video anyway and then my review which will pretty much give a quick break down of each certain scenes. I truly do suggest just skipping this movie. It even won the award for Worst Remake or Sequel at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards.

So despite the spoilers in this video and review, it’s worth it rather than watching this entire 2+ hours of rubbish!

And now on to our feature presentation… that being my review…

My Thoughts: Despite the presence of Matthew Broderick, Jean Reno, Kevin Dunn and Hank Azaria, this film sucked. Halfway through this film I was really bored and expecting it to end already. They put the scenes with Godzilla in the story way too soon. And the character development was horrible, like they were there just to fill in the storyline with their dull humor. And the CGI with Godzilla and it’s babies reminded me all too much of the movie Jurassic Park. Sure Godzilla is tall, but is it supposed to have human-like legs? Blah.

Oh and what is up with the monsoon weather for days on end at New York? It was really ridiculous!

The Play by Play of My Thoughts…

French Polynesian Pacific. The opening credits gives us a quick explanation on how Godzilla was born without words, just some dramatic video of a ocean lizard swimming out of the water to lay it’s eggs and then the atomic bomb is tested. Naturally we get a quick “Alien’s” look at the egg of Godzilla before lightning strikes and the movie begins. Fast forward to what time is unknown but we’re still in the South Pacific somewhere because there’s a ship with Japanese people on board and you know they’ll get attacked by the fully grown Godzilla.

Matthew who? But thankfully it cuts to Matthew Broderick’s character before we see too much of what Godzilla is to look like. It’s a good thing they cut to him singing the song “Singing in the Rain” because it was starting to get a little too dreary. And Matthew’s humor is needed when he goes to the atomic testing sight it do some soil research with some gross worms all over, like they dumped gallons of worms all over for this filming shot.

“Is that a footprint?” – Dr. Niko “Nick” Tatopoulos

Jamaica baby. So “Gojira” has traveled from the ocean to somewhere in Jamaica? I don’t know. And somehow the Japanese survivor gets sent to the French for some testing where Jean Reno asks him who did this. Poor guy is so much in shock that it takes Jean’s lighter to spark the Japanese guy’s attention. Anyway off to Jamaica where Godzilla and the scientists are, oh and New York City where Tatopoulos’s girl is.

“She thinks I’m cute.” – Tatopoulos

Yes he is cute. Now onto finding out what Gojira is along with the dramatic music and the remnants of the Japanese ship. Oh and here’s Jean Reno’s character – a property insurance agent.

Eastern Seaboard – U.S. And now we’re back with another scene in the ocean, this time with a fishing boat. Three boats actually and they think they’ve caught something. Nope, but Godzilla did catch them. And now it’s off to this poor schmuck lone fisherman who thinks it’s his lucky day to catch something in the East River. Right, like we need more “humor and laughs” like this one here…

Tatopoulos: “This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur.”

Colonel Hicks: “Don’t tell me what it isn’t. Tell me what the hell it is.”

What? Yes I would like to know what’s going on too, especially when the worms the Doc was inspecting earlier seemed to only grow 17%. And this lizard has grown to… well to the size of a Dinosaur.

“We’re looking at a completely incipient creature, the dawn of a new species, the first of it’s kind.” – Tatopoulos

So that’s what that thing is? But I thought this is like the 30-something Godzilla movie so it isn’t the first of it’s kind.

Caiman’s Secretary: “Sir I think your story just walked by the window”

Caiman: “What?” Turns around and sees nothing.

Gojira. And just like that Godzilla has vanished inside New York City. A good thing too because the Special Effects on Godzilla looks funny.

23 Street Subway Station. And now after 40 minutes into the movie, we finally get to see the military try and draw Godzilla out of it’s hiding spot. Plus we also get to see how mysterious those French insurance men are. But even Jean Reno’s humor with our French Roast coffee isn’t helping anything. Yes more cream indeed, please Jean.

Audrey took the “Top Secret Tape”. Well of course she did because it turns out that Audrey and Nick were only college sweethearts. Now the poor schmuck is kicked off the Godzilla hunting team. And it looks like that good for nothing reporter, Charles Caiman stole Audrey’s story.

DGES. Oh but look, it’s Jean Reno again. Ha. He’s a DGES. What? Ya, Nick asked the same thing and Jean’s character had to simplify as a French Secret Service. Good thing he’s there because apparently the American’s are too stupid to go after Godzilla’s eggs. So while the Americans try to kill Godzilla with another fish trap at the park, Nick, the French guys, Audrey and “Animal” the camera guy go looking for the eggs. Leave it up to the Navy to destroy Godzilla.

Madison Square Garden. Or as I would call these scenes, “Welcome to Jurassic Park.” Meanwhile Nick and the others have found the eggs. Ya more than 20 eggs? As Jean’s character says, “Start counting.”

Well it looks like there’s more eggs than they have explosives. And just as Phillipe (Jean) tells Nick that they don’t have enough explosives the eggs start hatching. But don’t worry, the U.S. Military does.

Godzilla Strikes Back. aka Godzilla vs a Taxi car. Hmm. A huge monster as tall as the skyscraper buildings vs this little Taxi car, and the car is winning? I smell something fishy here. Speaking of, why don’t they just trick Godzilla into getting stuck on the Brooklyn Bridge. And then the missile air strike. And did that do it? Well Godzilla looks dead now. Matthew even checked before walking off into the sunrise.
