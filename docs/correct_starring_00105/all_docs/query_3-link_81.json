        "text": "While plans to further TriStar’s Godzilla franchise on the big screen fell through, the animated sequel turned out to be a great alternative. Godzilla: The Series debuted mere months after the 1998 film was released, and it went on to become a popular part of Fox Kids’ Saturday morning programming. And although this continuation had a limited lifespan of just two seasons, it still managed to do the impossible and redeem Roland Emmerich’s widely disliked adaptation.\n\nSimilar to Ultra Q, Godzilla: The Series saw Dr. Niko “Nick” Tatopoulos (out with Matthew Broderick, in with Ian Ziering) leading a specialized team — Humanitarian Environmental Analysis Team, or H.E.A.T. for short — in the struggle against the giant and disruptive creatures (often referred to as “mutants”) who have begun to appear all across the globe. Aiding them was the lone, surviving offspring of Godzilla teased at the end of the film. And to ensure the juvenile Godzilla stood with humanity rather than against it, the spawn imprinted on Nick and saw him as his parent.\n\nAlong with “worm guy” Tatopoulos, the animated Godzilla: The Series brought back supporting characters from the film and gave them lead parts. Namely H.E.A.T. members Dr. Elsie Chapman and Dr. Mendel Craven. Charity James filled in for Vicki Lewis while Malcolm Danare was one of several actors from the film to reprise their roles in the cartoon. Paleobiologist Chapman was the snarky animal-behavior expert, and engineer Craven served as the show’s comic relief (which was always done at his own expense). On top of Craven’s many ridiculous allergies and other vulnerable quirks, his talking robot-buddy N.I.G.E.L. (short for Next Millennium Intelligence Gathering Electronic Liaison) drew cheap laughs; the machine routinely met a fate in the vein of South Park’s “oh my god, they killed Kenny” running gag.\n\nRounding out H.E.A.T. were two new characters: DGSE secret agent Monique Dupré (Brigitte Bako) and young computer whiz Randy Hernandez (Rino Romano). The former started out like Jean Reno’s character from the film; Dupré was sent by the French government to “clean up” its mess after incidentally creating the Godzilla species, and after Philippe Roaché’s failure to eliminate all of the hatchlings. The steely servicewoman gradually warmed up as she became more involved in H.E.A.T. and realized this new Godzilla was vastly different from his father. As for Randy, he is the team’s genius slacker-hacker who still has a lot to learn from his older colleagues.\n\nThe previously mentioned Agent Roaché popped up in the cartoon, although now he was voiced by Keith Szarabajka. Reporter Audrey Timmonds (Paget Brewster) continued to be overly ambitious, much to the detriment of her already strained relationship with Nick, and her cameraman, Victor “Animal” Palotti, was downright testy now that Joe Pantoliano took over for Hank Azaria. On top of Malcolm Danare, other returning actors included Kevin Dunn as H.E.A.T.’s military associate and one of Godzilla’s reluctant supporters, Major Anthony Hicks, and Michael Lerner as Mayor Ebert. The latter character’s naming was, by the way, Emmerich’s petty response to critic Roger Ebert’s negative reviews of his previous films.\n\nMissteps regarding the ‘98 film’s namesake were decisively corrected in the animated sequel. For starters, Godzilla’s trademark atomic fire breath was reintroduced without questioning; the progeny now emitted a green flame, whereas later on in the story, its revived father suddenly possessed the traditional blue variant. Moreover, Godzilla Junior was not only bigger and stronger than his parent, he was far more resilient to military attacks and whatnot. The power upgrade was necessary if the new Big G was tangling with other colossal critters. Most importantly, though, was the addition of a personality. The film treated its enormous star as nothing more than a wrecking ball with legs and claws. Any attempt at creating character was saved for the human cast, however dull they turned out. Meanwhile, the series managed to imbue the King of Monsters with a sense of individuality without also veering into anthropomorphism. The prolific Frank Welker, who provided various creature sounds both here and in the ’98 film, helped vocalize Godzilla’s subtle but growing selfhood.\n\nAs beloved as Godzilla is, it failed to bring back any other Toho creations. Big hitters like Ghidorah and Mothra are nowhere to be found in the cartoon on account of the fact that licensing them would have been too pricey. To get around this obstacle, though, the staff periodically conceived parallels to Toho’s classic kaijū. There are those monsters whose references are subtle or obscure — Megapede, a prodigious breed of spider and a gigantic turtle respectively bear physical traits of Battra, Kumonga and Kamoebas — while others, such as Quetzalcoatl (Rodan), Robo-Yeti (Mechani-Kong) and Cyber-Godzilla (Mechagodzilla and Mecha-King Ghidorah), were blatant analogs. The remainder of the monster gallery had a tendency to be oversized, run-of-the-mill fauna brought on by chemical pollution, climate change and ecocide. Jumbo bugs were especially overused in the show. Nevertheless, Fil Barlow’s superb creature designs compensated for the more generic adversaries.\n\nGodzilla: The Series was, of course, not the first animated adaptation; Hanna-Barbera’s Godzilla aired between 1978 and ‘79. In several ways, the newer cartoon is an update of the aforesaid series. Both casts traveled by boat to foreign locales and tangled with regional monstrosities, and each show had specific technology that could summon Godzilla to their rescue at a moment’s notice. The ‘70s version had a fair share of outlandish stories, yet nothing quite compared to the far-out plots of its successor. On occasion, H.E.A.T. battled aliens (in a saga akin to Destroy All Monsters) and tackled time-travel (à la Marvel’s Days of Future Past). The cartoon route made all of these more fantastical adventures easier to swallow, not to mention feasible.\n\nJeff Kline and Richard Raynis (Extreme Ghostbusters, Men in Black: The Series) faced an uphill battle when they developed this series. And despite the cartoon raking in consistently good ratings and positive reviews, it still had no chance of surviving without tie-in toys to turn a profit. The staggering amount of unsold film merchandise led to retailers refusing to sell the toys for the TV show, thus leading to its cancellation. Even so, this small-screen sequel was captivating while it lasted. The characters were likable, the writing was punchy, the animation was solid, and the monster-on-monster action was plentiful and exciting. It was simply hard not to enjoy Godzilla: The Series. Even the film’s biggest detractors were — and still are — charmed by the overall quality of this animated follow-up.\n\n“There’s some whores in this house!” blasts from the speakers. The stage lights brighten, and the queens strut out onstage. In Jem Garrard’s camp classic Slay, a Tubi original that dropped earlier this year, four drag queens – Mama Sue Flay (Trinity the Tuck), Robin Banks (Heidi N Closet), Bella Da Boys (Crystal Methyd), and Olive Wood (Cara Melle) – descend upon a sleazy redneck dive to deliver the performance of their lives.\n\nSet to Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion’s “WAP,” the salacious musical number bursts at the seams with the magic of queerness, drag performance, and community. As our dolled-up and dazzling quartet flits and flutters around the stage, the crowd looks on in both wonder and disgust. While country bumpkins like Travis (Daniel Janks) wrinkle their noses and scoff in between chugs of beer, bar regular Shiela (Robyn Scott) applauds the performance and even expresses her jealousy. Adoring fans Jax (Donia Kash) and Steven (Gabriel Harry Meltz) also show up to support the show – giving the performance great significance for the queer crowd.\n\nDrag as a real art form wasn’t something I had growing up. I wasn’t introduced to it until college. Coming from a small town, I lived a pretty secluded life surrounded by cows, crows, and cornfields. The only queer media I was familiar with was Will & Grace. While the popular NBC show featured drag queens occasionally, I didn’t yet understand the importance of drag performance. When I moved for college, I traded out those cows, crows, and cornfields for theatre studies, a rail system that never worked, and a flourishing LGBTQ+ culture.\n\nA whole new world opened up before me. I frequented the prominent gay fixture Vice Versa every weekend with my friends, and that’s where I witnessed my first drag show. I was in awe. Newly out as a gay man (I now identify as non-binary), I found myself entranced by the queens sashaying around the stage, wanting desperately to live my life just as fearlessly. The exaggerated makeup, the flowing costumes, and the big pop hits all conspired to make nights I’ll remember forever.\n\nThat’s the feeling I get every time I watch Slay.\n\nA refreshing mix of terror and humor, the film cherishes queerness in a very real way. The four leads, whose chemistry oozes in each frame, embody living as your most authentic self. In spite of the outside world, you accept who you are and let the shackles of the past loosen and fall off your body. The world might hate you, but you wear self-love and the love of other queer people like armor that repels hate and permits you to live a life worth living.\n\nIt’s too cliché to say “it gets better,” when sweeping anti-trans and anti-gay legislation makes it hard to believe it actually will get better for us. It might not, truth be told – but we forge ahead anyway because we value ourselves and the community we’ve built since Stonewall. What Slay represents to me is knowing that hatred has nothing to do with me but speaks to another person’s fear of the unknown.\n\nThat fear presents itself in the film as a horde of vampires that seek only one thing: blood. In the opening, the bar’s vendor Rufus (Shane John Kruger) makes a pitstop on his way to The Bold Buck, a biker bar on the outskirts of town. While taking a leak out by his truck, a vampire pounces and takes a hearty chunk out of his neck. Rufus’ transformation leads to a rampage in true From Dusk Till Dawn fashion. Later that night, he saunters into the bar, walks up to an unsuspecting local, and sinks his razor-sharp fangs into their neck. Chaos ensues as the others scramble, with other locals tossing Rufus out into the dirt. But he’s just getting started.\n\nThe groups (the bikers vs the queers) blockade the entrances in hopes of warding off the growing mass of vampires outside. Tensions reach a fevered pitch, and before long, they must set aside their differences and work together to survive the night. Travis doesn’t necessarily accept Mama Sue Flay and her friends, but he does grow increasingly tolerant – baby steps! Throughout the film, he teams up with Mama Sue to fight vampires down in the basement, and their shared traumas bring them just a few inches closer. They learn from each other, and while it’s not full acceptance, they come to respect one another in a mutual understanding.\n\nThese character moments tangle together with another underlying subplot involving the bartender, Dusty (Neil Sandilands), a closeted gay man, who harbors his share of childhood trauma. Early in the vampire attacks, Dusty heads to the drag queens’ dressing room to hide out. He tip-toes over to the vanity, where he eyes an array of makeup on the tabletop. His eyes widen in interest. Mama Sue and Robin Banks dash into the room moments later and spot Dusty seated at the vanity wiping on some blush. Caught in the act, he shrugs it off, clearly ashamed of what he’s done. But Robin is quick to the rescue, telling Mama Sue that “he needs this.”\n\nMama Sue and Robin transform Dusty into a flaming-haired drag queen. Dusty’s face changes. Gone is the shame his father beat into him. Instead, he glows. His posture shifts, too. Packed into a red little number, he appears back in the barroom carrying a double-barrel shotgun. Just because he’s now embracing his femininity doesn’t mean he doesn’t know how to take care of business. In fact, he’s far stronger and more self-assured than he’s ever been.\n\nDusty’s transformation is a beautiful thing. The moment he claims himself, he casts the past aside and learns exactly what it means to love yourself. That’s the marvel in drag performance. It’s taking up the mantel of identity, clenching your fists, and charging ahead. Femininity, often perceived as a weakness in a patriarchal society, is not a bad thing. And embracing female energy is an act of bravery. It’s looking toxic masculinity straight in the eyes and spitting in its face.\n\nWhile I’ve never performed in drag onstage, I have done drag for Halloween. And it was never just a costume for me. A few of the characters – Queen of Hearts, Miss Lucky, Sporty Spice – gave me access to femininity in a way I’d never felt before. It permitted me to finally love myself and see the value in honest living. While it’s been ages since I last dressed up, I have unlocked female power in other ways – like wearing eyeshadow, earrings, women’s clothing, etc. – and continued supporting drag whenever I can.\n\nSlay arrives as such a special experience. Aside from its exploration of queerness, the film is a damn fun vampiric romp with crisp, stylish cinematography (shout-out to the director of photography Trevor Calverley). Real care has been taken in every aspect, from script to filming. The characters feel like real people, and the performances are honest, pulsating with immense heart.\n\nIf you were ever skeptical about Tubi Originals, I implore you to give Slay a shot. It just might surprise you, too."
