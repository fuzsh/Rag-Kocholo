        "text": "“Collaborative Piano is a term used to denote a field of the piano profession where a pianist works in collaboration with one or more instrumentalists, singers, dancers, or other artists.”\n\n–The Collaborative Piano Blog, 11/7/2005\n\nAccompanist…or Collaborative Pianist?\n\nOver the past 15 years, I have enjoyed the privilege (most of the time) of playing the piano with countless individuals, ensembles, and events around the world – choirs, orchestras, instrumental and vocal soloists, congregations, house parties, conferences, nursing homes, and even political primaries. The definition from The Collaborative Piano Blog is fairly on point, but I struggle with this conversation around identity. The term “collaborative pianist” is a fairly recent term (1990s), and the reasons for its emergence cause me to wonder: what’s the deal with the new nomenclature for pianists?\n\nEach time I have sat at the piano and performed, my role has been acknowledged in a variety of ways, and my practice of retaining a program from every piano performance has yielded the following results:\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Piano\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Pianist\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Accompanist\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Musician\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Keys\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Collaborative Pianist\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Collaborative Artist\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Collaborator\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Keyboard\n\nKevin T. Padworski, Keyboarder (favorite)\n\n…and very often, no mention at all.\n\nWhy the inconsistency and confusion around how folk understand this role?\n\nThe Collaborative Piano Blog continues its definition of the “collaborative pianist” with the following statements:\n\n“This field is also referred to with its former name as Piano Accompanying, a term which has traditionally implied inferiority, subservience, working “for” rather than “with” a recital partner. Collaborative piano, on the other hand, is a term that implies equality, association, and teamwork.”\n\nOnce this term hit the American academic realms, many schools began offering degrees in Collaborative Piano. Over 100 schools now offer this degree, seemingly distinguishing those who actively seek experience working with other musicians as opposed to a solo piano career. But most of the world doesn’t know that this degree exists, or that there is a difference – most simply hear, I got a degree in piano. (This usually results in a comment like, Well, I hope you find a spouse/partner with a good paying job…HAHA.)\n\nIt appears that this term resulted from a general feeling from pianists that their role as “accompanist” was accompanied (ha) by an apparent lack of appreciation felt from those with whom they worked. Certainly, most pianists can attest that the amount of gratitude received does not often equate to the felt significance of his or her role. But do we need to create a title just to feel justified or affirmed? Indeed, pianists are incredibly versatile and can fulfill many roles in performance. This could cause confusion among non-musicians about how to address these people. But does the creation of a new term actually help eradicate the insecurities that this term sought to fix?\n\nThe author of the other blog does follow up with a post seeking to define what it is not. The following statement from that post sums up what I believe has been the result of the new term:\n\n“Having a distinction between collaborative pianists and accompanists creates an apartheid system in the profession where:\n\nAccompanists = hack pianists that suck\n\nCollaborative Pianists = really good accompanists.”\n\nThis is obviously not true, yet it remains as a toxic thought that permeates the performing world.\n\nHowever, pianists seem to be the only performing medium that seeks to redefine themselves in order to gain more attention. I don’t see instrumentalists or vocalists listing themselves as a collaborative oboist, collaborative cellist, or collaborative soprano (insert joke here).\n\n…I don’t believe I can support the creation of a new term or degree simply to appease the insecurities of a few. Obviously, there are many Collaborative Pianists out there that can attest that neither their relationship nor their sense of appreciation from their respective ensemble has changed due to their re-naming in a concert program. So, what’s the point?\n\nI have worked hard to set professional boundaries and expectations with each of the ensembles with whom I work as “pianist.” Similarly, I have intentionally crafted my career to include both roles as conductor and pianist so that I am continually reminded of how it feels from both perspectives of collaboration… With those that don’t respect the work that I do, I sever that relationship. Instead of seeking to find worth from a title, create worth in the way that you work with people.\n\nWhere do we go from here?\n\nSeeing as there are many thoughts surrounding titles and roles for pianists, and acknowledging that there is no right or wrong, here is a basic guideline for working with a pianist for your particular music group:"
