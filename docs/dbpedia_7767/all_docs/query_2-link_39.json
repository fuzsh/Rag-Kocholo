        "text": "No disrespect to the band, but does anyone think they may have been jealous at Jim Martinâ€™s growing celebrity at the time?\n\nMy take is that Bill makes himself the defacto leader of the band.\n\nIf that's the end of the story, maybe it's harder to get Jim back.\n\nJim is Jim, he'll do what he does and expect those around him to sort of understand, is what I can read as an outsider fan.\n\nBill will talk to you, but he also will play your guitar part or keyboard part if someone has to.\n\nAlbum Of The Year and Sol Invictus are as much Billy driving the music as We Care a Lot, Introduce Yourself, The Real Thing, definitely Angel Dust (Jim's contributions are MASSIVE, 'Caffeine', 'Smaller and Smaller', 'Kindergarten', 'Jizzlobber', are all heavily-constructed Jim Martin guitar parts). King For a Day... had Patton endeared himself better to Jim*...\n\nBill Gould is the keeper of the flame, and Jon Hudson has been the wicker of the flame and the base chemical that's kept Faith No More existing and able to exist.\n\nThere's a lot of interpersonal... ya know.. safenesss... feeling safe around each other, that has to get working and safely and somewhat easily develop, I think, before they could properly and able-y re-introduce Jim.\n\nThey reintroduced Chuck , and there's a fun book you can read about that.\n\nJim? His personal life is his own, but that's what we're talking about when we go \"Oh bring Jim back\".\n\nRoddy, well he's mother ****ing killing it with MANONMAN right now, and if you want his keyboarding tensions he did a month of them and made a Bandcamp page to post them.\n\nBut Roddy wasn't into King For a Day, and maybe he didn't care for 'Surprise! You're Dead' or even Patton's versions with 'Gentle Art of Making Enemys' and 'Got That Feeling', the \"stop-start thing\"; but he's open to Jim and I think its because he's more open to \"differentness\" in people's behaviors, and better with letting people be loud and unpredictable, or even forceful if that's what they need to do.\n\nI say that because Roddy, in the way he voices his parts AND his voice in the band, is as integral to the etherial ongoing Faith No More as Bill is, and that maybe through Roddy being able to tolerate and live with Chuck, that Bill's immediate \"maybe I don't like this guy\" reactions to Jim can be given greater context, and a modern version of Faith No More *with* Jim (and/or Trey, but defintely also WITH Jon Hudson) can exist.\n\nUntil then, Bill is the keeper of the flame. And Jon enables it. So the Faith No More than can still exist.. might require some ongoing interpersonal finessing, and maybe that's the situation.\n\n*I still think Patton, Jim Martin, and Mike Bordin..... imagine Fantomas, but it's Patton, Jim Martin, and much-much-better current day Mike Bordin. King For A Day could've been 'Surprise! You're Dead' the album, I reckon the only thing stopping that was interpersonal development\n\nedit: I can only imagine what it would've taken to reintroduce Chuck and Jim, but again I tout the stable feature that is Jon Hudson. And genuinely I think Jon considers himself there until the \"proper\" player shows up, and yet Jon brought to the band, showing a proper understanding of not only the history of the band but where they were headed, he brought\n\nto them 'Stripsearch'"
