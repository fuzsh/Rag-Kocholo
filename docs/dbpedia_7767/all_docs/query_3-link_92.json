Symptoms may be prevented or alleviated by primary control measures at work and some cases of disease are compensable. Following a general description of the disorder, its epidemiology, and some of the difficulties surrounding diagnosis, this review focuses on the role of occupational factors in causation of CTS and factors that can mitigate risk. Areas of uncertainty, debate and research interest are emphasised where relevant.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a peripheral mono-neuropathy of the upper limb, caused by compression of the median nerve as it passes through the carpal tunnel into the wrist. In the carpal tunnel the median nerve lies immediately beneath the palmaris longus tendon and anterior to the flexor tendons. Conditions which decrease the tunnel’s size, or swell the structures contained within it, compress the median nerve against the transverse ligament bounding the tunnel’s roof. Such circumstances can arise traumatically, congenitally, or due to systemic or inflammatory effects. Known causes of CTS include diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, acromegaly, hypothyroidism, pregnancy and tenosynovitis [1]. This review focuses, however, on putative occupational causes. Following a general description of CTS, its epidemiology in the working age population, its presenting clinical features and investigation, attention is given to well-established and suspected risk factors in the workplace, and the compensation, prevention and optimum management of work-associated cases.\n\nClinical features\n\nClassically, the syndrome of CTS comprises sensory and motor features in the median nerve distribution of the hand, together with evidence of delayed nerve conduction. The history is of gradual onset of numbness and tingling in the median nerve distribution of the hand. Pain is also reported. Strenuous use of the hand tends to aggravate symptoms, although this may not become apparent until several hours after activity. Night time pain disturbs sleep, and patients often hang the affected hand over the side of the bed to gain relief. Many sufferers complain of progressive weakness and clumsiness in their hands. Tinel’s test (percussion over the flexor retinaculum) and Phalen’s test (sustained complete flexion of the wrist for a minute or so) may provoke parasthesiae over a median nerve distribution.\n\nCompression of the nerve results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities: electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere.\n\nCase definitions and diagnosis\n\nNerve conduction, with its objectivity and relationship to mechanism, is treated as a reference standard. However, diagnosis is less simple in clinical experience (and especially in surveys of general and working populations) than implied by the foregoing description. Sensory symptoms are common in the absence of obvious pathology (>30% of adults in one British population survey reported sensory symptoms in the digits in the past 7 days [2]); patients may forget the distribution of their symptoms; and questions arise as to the interpretation of compatible but non-classical presentations (e.g. whether symptoms confined to only one of the three median digits is indicative of CTS). ‘Classical’ symptoms, and improvement with surgery, occur despite normal nerve conduction; delayed nerve conduction occurs fairly often in asymptomatic individuals; and Tinel’s and Phalen’s signs can be found in the absence of other syndromic features [1]. Thus, the relation between elements of the triad (symptoms, signs, and nerve conduction) is inconstant, making for a reference standard that is imperfect.\n\nThe ensuing uncertainty contributes to variation in practice, with physicians entertaining differing views about essential diagnostic features. Thus, when Graham et al (2006) asked 99 physicians and surgeons to score 57 potential criteria on a visual analogue scale, they found remarkably little agreement beyond chance within and between specialties [3].\n\nIn research, the situation – though far from ideal – is rather better. The hand diagrams of Katz et al [4] represent a standardised, widely used method of collecting patients’ symptom histories. By pre-specifying and agreeing the shading patterns of ‘classical’, ‘probable’ and ‘possible’ distributions of CTS-like symptoms, different observers have reached acceptable agreement over case history. In one workplace study two observers achieved a 96% agreement over the rating of 255 hand diagrams collected from workers at 12 worksites [5]; and in another, good agreement was found between three experienced clinicians assessing the hand diagrams of 333 employees [6]. Others, by pre-specifying a combination of symptoms and signs, have shown that research-trained observers can agree reasonably well [7].\n\nReproducibility of case history is a useful achievement, although not synonymous with validity of diagnosis. (By analogy, badly calibrated weighing scales can offer repeatable but erroneous data.) Nor has disagreement in research been eliminated entirely; rather it is manifest in debate about interpretation of the hand diagram. Katz and Stirrat [4] have defined symptoms of CTS as “classical” if they affect at least two of digits 1–3 but not the palm or dorsum of the hand, as “probable” if the palm is also involved, and as “possible” if symptoms are reported in only one of digits 1–3. Minor modifications to these criteria have been suggested by Franzblau et al [8] and Rempel et al [9].\n\nThe Katz hand diagram (and other features like Tinel’s and Phalen’s signs) have been assessed for their positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs), assuming that nerve conduction is a sufficient, if imperfect reference standard ( ) [5,10,11]. LRs assess how much a positive diagnostic test raises (or a negative test lowers) the post-probability of disease, and so offer an appealing framework for judging a test’s influence on clinical decision-making – the higher the +LR the better a test will be at ruling in a disease, the lower the −LR the better at ruling out a disease. However, by the criteria of Jaeschke et al 1994 [12], the LRs in do not suggest a ‘significant’ shift in the post-test likelihood.\n\nTable 1\n\nStudySettingSubgroupStandard+LR−LR Classical/probable hand diagram Bonauto (2008)5workplaceallnerve conduction1.830.95Bonauto (2008)5workplacecurrent symptomsnerve conduction1.250.94Bonauto (2008)5workplacecurrent N, T, or Pnerve conduction1.100.96 Phalen’s test Descatha (2010)10workplace-nerve conduction +\n\nsymptoms2.000.90Descatha (2010)10workplace+ classic symptomsnerve conduction +\n\nsymptoms11.550.78De Krom (1990)11general populationnight symptomsnerve conduction1.020.98 Tinel’s test Descatha (2010)10workplace-nerve conduction +\n\nsymptoms2.190.85Descatha (2010)10workplace+ classic symptomsnerve conduction +\n\nsymptoms8.560.86De Krom (1990)11general populationnight symptomsnerve conduction0.791.14\n\nThe failure may be one of case mix among the generally milder cases found in workplace and the community. Thus, a ‘classical’ distribution of (Katz definition) is reported to be sensitive and specific for delayed median nerve conduction in patients under hospital investigation [4]; but the criteria have not predicted delayed nerve conduction in community [8] or occupational [9] samples. A community survey by Ferry et al. [13] also explored the relation of delayed nerve conduction to various other symptom patterns, including hand symptoms that excluded the fifth digit, the dorsum, or both of these sites, but found the correlation to be similarly poor.\n\nThe want of an ideal reference standard, especially beyond the hospital confines, has knock on effects for the descriptive epidemiology of CTS and for research aimed at prevention and treatment.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nEstimates of the prevalence and incidence of CTS depend critically on the adopted case definition. The partial concordance of the diagnostic triad (above) allows for several choices, and a range of plausible cut-points exists for defining electrophysiological abnormality. Different choices generate markedly different estimates of prevalence [13].\n\nIn a large Dutch population survey that defined CTS as sensory disturbance in the median nerve distribution occurring at least twice a week, generally awakening the patient from sleep, and associated with nerve conduction abnormalities, the point prevalence was 0.6% in men and 8% in women [11].\n\nIn a British population survey, estimates were made of sensory symptoms in various anatomical distributions ( ) [2]. ‘Classical’ CTS – defined as symptoms extensively affecting the palmar surfaces of the medial three digits and not felt elsewhere – was reported by 1.2% of adults and ‘probable CTS (less extensive symptoms, but still restricted to the median nerve distribution) affected a further 2.2% of adults. Symptomatic respondents from the same survey were examined for physical signs, and this resulted in an estimated population prevalence of 0.9%, rising somewhat with age [14]. shows that other patterns of sensory involvement in the digits are very common, with 6-7% of respondents shading all of the digits in one or both of their hands as affected: thus, surveys which define cases on ‘soft’ definitions of symptom distribution generate markedly higher estimates of prevalence (14-19% in some investigations [15,16]).\n\nTable 2\n\n% (N)Right handLeft handEither/both handsExtensive mediana0.7 (16)0.8 (18)1.2 (25)Limited medianb1.4 (31)1.3 (27)2.2 (47)Non-median4.4 (94)4.6 (98)6.8 (146)All fingers6.0 (128)6.1 (131)7.8 (167)Mixed11.0 (237)9.4 (202)13.7 (293)Total23.6 (505)22.2 (476)31.7 (678)\n\nEstimates of prevalence and incidence depend on the setting in which inquiries are made. The crude incidence rate is reported to be one per thousand person years in hospital-diagnosed patients [17,18] and around two per thousand person-years in primary care [19]. In selected working populations, CTS is somewhat more common (1-2%), using clinically-based criteria [20,21].\n\nThe age-adjusted incidence rate of CTS may be increasing in the general population [17,22], but exact comparisons between surveys are difficult as case definitions have changed over time, following the introduction of electrophysiological testing.\n\nResearch-driven case definitions\n\nFerry et al have developed an instrument to assess the disability from CTS, which incorporates domains such as sleep disturbance, clumsiness, and difficulty with writing, dressing and driving [15]. The researchers explored case definitions based on symptoms and nerve conduction in the community, and found consistently higher levels of self-reported disability in those with electrophysiological abnormalities.\n\nThis example suggests a research-driven basis for refinement of case definition: ‘more correct’ definitions (those closer to ‘the truth’) should display stronger correlations with prognosis, effective treatments, and established causes of disease [23]. This phenomenon arises because the natural gradients between exposure and response are attenuated by diagnostic misclassification; good case definitions involve less misclassification, allowing dose-response effects to shine through. Where stronger associations (risks from exposure or benefits from treatment) are found, two useful conclusions flow – case definition A is more accurate than case definition B, while the magnitude of risk (or benefit) is greater than might be supposed from research with B as the operational case definition.\n\nillustrates the principle. The data derive from a survey of workers manufacturing ski equipment [24], some in jobs with frequent hand-wrist repetition and some in non-repetitive work. Both groups were classified as having CTS by several case definitions. The more specific detailed case definition (delayed nerve conduction with a positive Tinel’s or Phalen’s test) showed a much stronger association with repetition than non-specific symptoms (e.g. nocturnal hand pain), suggesting both that this definition is a better marker of CTS and that risks of the activity are reasonably high.\n\nTable 3\n\nCriteriaRepetitive\n\n(%)Non-\n\nrepetitive (%)RRTingling85701.2Nocturnal hand pain67461.5One/more signs*45212.2Nerve conduction only34191.8Nerve conduction + signs*1534.9\n\nAnalogously, in the British population survey mentioned above, associations were explored between various symptom patterns and risk factors for sensory hand symptoms ( ) [2]. Repetitive work activity was associated only with the extensive median pattern of sensory symptoms (classical CTS-like symptoms), whereas low vitality and painfully restricted neck movements were associated only with non-median symptoms. Studies like these vindicate textbook clinical teaching, and help to define tools for field research, despite ongoing debate about the optimum reference standard.\n\nTable 4\n\nPattern of numbness/tingling in past 7\n\ndaysPR (95%CI)Low vitalityNeck pain +\n\nrestricted\n\nmovementRepeated\n\nfinger/wrist\n\nmovements >4\n\nh/dayBending &\n\nstraightening the\n\nelbow for >1 h/dayExtensive median in one/both hands0.8 (0.3 to 3.1)1.4 (0.2 to 9.5)2.6 (1.0 to 6.8)3.1 (1.0 to 9.5)Limited median in one/both hands1.2 (0.6 to 2.7)3.7 (1.5 to 8.9)1.2 (0.6 to 2.4)1.1 (0.6 to 2.3)Non-median in one/both hands1.9 (1.3 to 2.8)3.2 (1.8 to 5.7)1.4 (0.9 to 2.1)1.3 (0.9 to 2.0)All fingers, both hands2.5 (1.4 to 4.3)4.9 (2.8 to 8.6)1.4 (0.8 to 2.2)1.3 (0.8 to 2.1)All fingers, one hand1.6 (0.8 to 2.9)2.8 (1.2 to 6.8)1.1 (0.6 to 2.0)1.1 (0.89 to 2.5)No symptoms, either hand1111\n\nClassifying occupational exposures\n\nIn evaluating occupational risk factors, problems of misclassification beset estimation of exposures, just as they do the determination of disease outcome. Factors such as the degree of repetition inherent in a job, the pacing of work activities, the work-rest cycle, and the torques acting at the wrist are challenging to measure; in most jobs they are highly variable; representativeness of sampling is an issue, as is the appropriate method of integrating exposures (e.g. how short-term exposures should be weighted relative to cumulative lifetime ones).\n\nMany assessment methods have been advocated, though none has achieved primacy. Some time-consuming expensive techniques have value in research, mainly as a means of validating simpler metrics. In some studies, analysis of work activities has been undertaken using panels of video cameras, and with reflective spots or small lights fixed to workers’ clothing, so that movements can be tracked, digitally encoded and analysed by computer; in other studies, workers have worn electronic pendulum potentiometers and flexible lightweight strain gauges, to enable computer reconstruction of postures and movements; static postures and joint angles have been mapped using photographs and goniometers; workload and muscle fatigue have been investigated using surface EMG and needle electrodes; and computer key strokes counted using dedicated software. These methods enable biomechanical measurements of force, posture, frequency, and duration to be compared with known human capability, while comparison across jobs allows those with higher risks to be identified. The OSWAS [25] and RULA [26] methods are alternative, simpler approaches to exposure assessment, although still requiring systematic observation of ‘representative’ work activities by expert observers.\n\nLarge scale field research requires cruder methods, ranging from job title through to self-reported exposures. The scope for measurement error is considerable: in one survey, intermittent users of hand-powered tools (a known cause of CTS) over-estimated the time that vibration entered their hands by some 2.5-fold compared with a time and motion study in which they were observed working [27].\n\nNon-systematic errors in exposure assessment tend to attenuate estimates of exposure-response, in the same fashion as errors of case classification. The degree of error is usually unknown. However, analyses that classify exposures in broad categories (‘highly’, ‘moderately’, ‘slightly’ exposed) can still demonstrate exposure-response effects, as placing workers in rough rank order and contrasting the extremes of exposure (very high vs. none) is more feasible than assigning a correct numerical estimate of exposure.\n\nIn the following section, which summarises current knowledge on workplace risk factors and CTS, the various estimates of risk should be read with the above limitations in mind.\n\nOccupational associations\n\nA review by Hagberg et al in 1992 identified 15 cross-sectional studies and six case-control studies with reasonably high quality information on occupational associations with CTS [28]. Most investigations analysed risks by job title, finding high prevalence rates and relative risks (RR) in a number of jobs believed to involve repetitive and forceful gripping. A second systematic review in the 1990s, by the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, concluded that there was ‘evidence’ of positive associations with work that entailed highly repetitive or forceful movements of the hands, and ‘strong evidence’ in relation to the combination of these exposures, but ‘insufficient evidence’ that the syndrome was caused by extreme wrist postures [29]. A textbook from the same period [30], while not finding positive evidence on all of the so-called Bradford Hill criteria for causality, concluded that there was ‘strong evidence supporting the contribution of work-related factors to the development of CTS’.\n\nUpdating these earlier reviews, Palmer et al [31] identified 38 relevant reports. shows risks of CTS by job title and by activities in the job. The occupations and industries studied ranged widely, but most fell into three broad classes – jobs entailing the use of vibratory tools, assembly work, and food processing and packing.\n\nTable 5\n\nAuthor (date)Exposed groupReference groupDiagnostic criteriaSubgroupRR (95% CI) Hand-transmitted vibration: Bovenzi et al 19913265 forestry workers31 mixed blue collar\n\nworkersSymptoms + signs21.3 (p = 0.002)Bovenzi 199433145 quarry drillers and 425\n\nstone carvers258 polishers and machine\n\noperators (not exposed)Symptoms + signs3.4 (1.4 - 8.3)Chatterjee et al\n\n19823416 rock drillers15 matched controlsElectrodiagnosis10.9 (1.0 - 5.2)Farkkila et al 19883579 chainsaw workers with >500\n\nhrs of sawing per yearNoneSymptoms + nerve\n\nconductionPrevalence 26%Koskimies et al\n\n199036217 forestry workers using chain\n\nsaws >500 hrs in past 3 yearsNoneSymptoms + nerve\n\nconductionPrevalence 20% Assembly workers, food processors and retailers: Abbas et al 200137104 electrical (TV) assembly\n\nworkers94 clerical workersSymptoms and nerve\n\nconduction11.4 (3.6 - 40.2)Barnhart et al 199124106 ski manufacturing workers\n\nin repetitive jobs67 non-repetitive jobsElectrophysiology +\n\nphysical signs4.0 (1.0 - 15.8)Bystrom et al 19953860 female automobile\n\nassembly workers90 female general\n\npopulation referentsSymptoms + signs2.9 (0.1 - 60.0)Cannon et al 198139Cases - 30 cases of CTS in\n\naircraft engine workersControls - 90 randomly\n\nselected workers from the\n\nsame plantWorkman’s claims +\n\nmedical records of CTS7.0 (3.0 - 17.0)Leclerc et al 199840Workers from assembly lines\n\n(479), clothing and shoe\n\nindustry (264), food industry\n\n(307), packaging (160)337 controlsSigns or positive nerve\n\nconductionAssembly\n\nClothing\n\nFood\n\nPackaging4.5 (2.3 - 9.1)\n\n4.1 (2.0 - 8.7)\n\n3.1 (1.4 - 7.2)\n\n6.6 (3.0 - 14.2)Leclerc et al 200141Cohort study of 598 workers from 5 sectors - assembly,\n\nclothing manufacture, food and packaging, and cashiers;\n\nestimates for baseline prevalence and incidence over 3\n\nyearsSigns or positive nerve\n\nconductionPrevalence/incidence varied <2-fold\n\nbetween groupsChiang et al 199042121 frozen food packers49 office staff and\n\ntechniciansSymptoms, signs, and/or\n\ndelayed nerve conduction11.7 (2.9 - 46.6)Kim et al 20044369 fish processors28 managers and\n\nsecretariesSymptoms + nerve\n\nconductionPrevalence 26% (exposed) vs. 0% (unexposed)Schottland et al\n\n19914493 poultry workers85 job applicants for\n\npoultry jobsDelayed nerve\n\nconduction2.9 (1.1 - 7.9)Morgenstern et al\n\n1991451058 female grocery\n\ncashiersNone (internal comparison)Self-reported symptoms<26 hrs/wk\n\n26 - 34 hrs/wk\n\n>34 hs/wk1.0\n\n1.5 (1.0 - 2.4)\n\n1.9 (1.1 - 3.1)Osorio et al 19944656 supermarket workers -\n\nbakery icers, meat cutters\n\nand cashiers working ≥20\n\nhrs per weekLow exposure group (others)Symptoms\n\nSymptoms + nerve\n\nconduction8.3 (2.6 - 26.4)\n\n6.7 (0.8 - 52.9) Textile workers: McCormack et al\n\n199047Textile workers involved in\n\nboarding (296), knitting\n\n(352), packaging/folding\n\n(369) and sewing (562)Non-office workers (468)Symptoms + signsBoarding\n\nSewing\n\nPackaging\n\nKnitting0.5 (0.05 - 2.9)\n\n0.9 (0.3 - 2.9)\n\n0.4 (0.04 - 2.4)\n\n0.6 (0.1 - 3.1)Punnett et al 198648162 female garment\n\nworkers (85% sewing and\n\ntrimming by hand)76 hospital workersMedian nerve symptoms2.7 (1.2 - 7.6) Other : Liss et al 1995491066 Canadian dental\n\nhygienists157 dental assistantsDoctor-diagnosed CTS\n\nMedian nerve symptoms\n\n5.2 (0.9 - 32.0)\n\n3.7 (1.1 - 11.9)Rosecrance et al\n\n200250Apprentice trades union\n\nconstruction worker: sheet\n\nmetal workers (136),\n\nengineers (486),\n\nplumbers/pipe fitters (330)Apprentice electricians\n\n(163)Symptoms and nerve\n\nconductionSheet metal workers\n\nEngineers\n\nPlumbers/pipe fitters2.0 (0.8 - 5.0)\n\n1.0 (0.5 - 2.2)\n\n1.2 (0.5 - 2.0)\n\nTable 6\n\nAuthor (date)Study populationDiagnostic criteriaActivityRR(95% CI)Abbas et al 200137104 TV assembly workers;

Exposures to vibratory tools tended to be relatively prolonged and intense. In one study, cases had used rock drills for an average of 10 years [34]; in another, foresters had used chainsaws occupationally for >11 years [32]; and in two further studies of foresters, cumulative exposures exceeded 8 years of continuous tool use [35,36]. A case-control study of surgically-treated CTS found a more than doubling of risk from work with hand-held vibratory tools, but with exposure durations defined very broadly (between 1 and 20 years) [60], and a second reported a RR of 3.3 for exposure to power tools or machinery for >6 hours/day [57].\n\nAssembly work\n\nIncreased risks were reported in ski assembly workers employed an average of five years in jobs involving ‘repeated and/or sustained’ flexion, extension, or ulnar or radial deviation of the wrist (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.0) [24]; in automobile assembly workers (OR 2.9) [38]; in electrical assembly workers (OR 11.4) [37]; and in workers assembling small electrical appliances, and motor vehicle and ski accessories (OR 4.5) [40].\n\nExcess risks were also reported In food processing and food packing – in poultry workers (OR 2.9) [44]; in food processors (two studies) [43,52],; and in frozen food packers (OR 11.7) [42].\n\nMany of these occupations involve prolonged or repeated flexion and extension of the wrist, and in keeping, assessments of risk by main activity ( ) find higher risks with these exposures. Four studies [53,57,59,60] found that repeated flexion and extension of the wrist increased the risk of physician-confirmed CTS. Three studies pointed to wrist flexion or extension for at least half of the working day as carrying a notably high risk. In one study risks were elevated 5-8-fold when the self-reported time spent in activities with the wrist flexed or extended was ≥20 hours/week [53], and in a second the OR for CTS was 2.1 to 2.7 for those estimating that they bent/twisted their wrists for >3.5 hours per day vs. 0 hours/day [57]. The most telling evidence on force and repetition comes, however, from a well-known and careful survey by Silverstein et al [21], which videotaped workers from 7 different industries. When repetitive work (hand-wrist flexion and extension) was defined by a cycle time of <30 seconds or >50% of cycle time involving the same activities, the OR was 2.7 in low force (hand force <1kg) jobs and 15.5 in high force (hand force >4 kg) jobs – highlighting an interaction between force and repetition. A study by Tanaka et al [59] found that risks were increased nearly six-fold in workers bending/twisting the hand or wrist ‘many times per hour’. Other studies, by Leclerc et al [40,41] and Roquelaure et al [58] found associations with assembly tasks involving a short elemental cycle time (<10 seconds/repetition).\n\nUse of the computer keyboard and mouse have also been closely studied, but with far less evidence of elevated risk. A painstaking cohort study of 5,000 Danish professional technicians found an association between incident, self-reported sensory symptoms in the median nerve distribution and use of a right-handed mouse, but no association with use of keyboards, and the overall incidence of symptoms was very low, causing the authors to conclude that “computer use does not pose a severe occupational hazard for developing symptoms of CTS” [51]. Other surveys have also proved generally reassuring [57,61].\n\nThe studies mentioned here are not without individual limitations. In particular, almost all collected information about exposures retrospectively, with potential for information bias. Some studies were small and some may not have fully controlled for confounding. Conceivably, a few investigations were prompted by workplace clusters, which would lead to unrepresentatively high estimates of risk. Notwithstanding these problems, the body of evidence as a whole is consistent, and the stronger studies, including those that undertook direct assessments of exposure rather than relying on self-report, point in the same direction [31]. Finally, from a biomechanical viewpoint, the findings are plausible. It can be demonstrated experimentally, in human cadavers and animal models, that extreme flexion and extreme extension of the wrist increase the pressure in the carpal tunnel sufficiently to impair blood perfusion of the median nerve [62,63], so that epidemiological and physiological investigations offer a coherent view of causation.\n\nCompensation and statutory reporting\n\nIn many countries industrial diseases are compensated by state welfare benefit for workers who develop illness because of their occupation. In Britain, for example, provisions have existed to cover occupational accidents since 1897 and occupationally-related diseases since 1906. CTS is potentially compensable in users of vibratory tools; and also in those whose jobs entail repeated palmar flexion and dorsiflexion of the wrist for at least 20 hours per week for at least 12 months in aggregate in the 24 months prior to symptom onset (“repeated” means at least once every 30 seconds) [64]. However, only willing, knowledgeable and insured workers (employees rather than the self-employed) can lodge a claim, and benefit is only paid under qualifying conditions of occupation and severity. Altogether, the Department for Works and Pensions confirms only about a few hundred cases per year from these causes, most likely the tip of a morbidity iceberg.\n\nIn many countries there is also a legal duty to report a scheduled list of work-related illnesses to health and safety enforcement agencies. In Britain, most of the illnesses which are compensable by the State, including CTS, must be notified to the Health and Safety Executive or to local Environmental Health Officers when they occur in qualifying circumstances of exposure. The onus falls on informed employers to submit a return, and under-reporting is recognised to be a wide-spread and significant problem.\n\nCase management and prevention\n\nThe management of work-associated CTS is similar to that of non-occupational CTS, with the important exception of advice on control of causal or aggravating exposures. Conservative measures may suffice. Recently updated Cochrane reviews report “significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation” and also from local corticosteroid injections [65,66]. Electrophysiological evidence of nerve entrapment is generally sought before proceeding to the ultimate step of surgical release, which is usually effective. Ahead of this, measures to mitigate workplace exposures, temporarily (hand-wrist repetition) or permanently (hand-transmitted vibration), may be appropriate. Preventive measures, based on an assumed mechanical pathogenesis, may include: (i) job rotation or job enlargement, to provide respite from work that requires repetitive monotonous use of the same muscles and tendons; (ii) rest breaks; (iii) task optimisation (e.g. better design of tools and equipment, and a better work lay-out make the task easier to perform); (iv) training, to ensure better working practices; (v) an induction period, to allow new employees to start out at a slower pace; (vi) a rehabilitation programme, to ease affected workers back into work, with redeployment, in recalcitrant and recurrent cases. Box 1 summarises some principles of good ergonomic practice drawn from general principles.\n\nPhysical risk factors in industry include: short cycle repetitive activities; static loading (e.g. standing, and carrying); awkward postures; undesirable load on muscles and torques on joints.\n\nTo avoid injury, ergonomic theory advocates\n\nminimising work effort by adopting ‘good’ postures, which allow strong muscles to contribute\n\navoiding prolonged static loading (which interrupts the blood supply)\n\nminimising the forces that have to be applied (e.g. by improving tool design)\n\nensuring the tool fits the worker (e.g. correct sized handle) and is fit for purpose\n\navoiding application of forces at the extremes of joint movement\n\navoiding repetition of the same movements– by mixing the pattern of work and slowing the cycle time\n\nallowing enough rest breaks\n\navoiding forceful twisting or rotation of the wrist, movement of the wrist from side to side, highly flexed fingers and wrist, and upper limb motions beyond the range of comfort\n\nminimising adverse co-factors (e.g. reducing the vibration of tools by damping; improving lighting and layout)\n\nDirect empirical evidence on prevention of CTS is limited, however, with few relevant intervention studies. Assuming a precautionary line, highly repetitive wrist-hand work should be avoided by ergonomic design of tasks and tools, and by appropriate scheduling of work and rest periods. It is also important to avoid prolonged use of hand-held vibratory tools insofar as this is possible.\n\nSummary\n\nCTS is a reasonably common disorder in people of working age, although its diagnosis is not without elements of difficulty and controversy. The disorder can cause functional handicap and is compensable under some circumstances when occupationally related. Clear associations have been established between CTS and workplace activities involving exposure to hand-transmitted vibration and/or repeated and forceful movements of the hand/wrist; many occupations are at increased risk. Symptoms may be avoidable if good ergonomic practices are followed, and control of mechanical risk factors in the workplace can aid rehabilitation of the affected worker. In vibration-induced CTS, a change of occupation is often indicated.\n\n​\n\nCTS probably affects 0.6%-2% of working-aged people, depending on case definition\n\nHand diagrams are an aid to clear and reproducible history taking\n\nLook for an ‘extensive median’ distribution of symptoms (extensively affecting the palmar surfaces of the medial three digits and not elsewhere) – this is a good marker of CTS\n\nAlthough the classical triad (median nerve distributions, physical signs and delayed nerve conduction) forms the basis of diagnosis, patients with only some of these features may benefit from treatment\n\nReasonable evidence exists that regular, prolonged use of hand-held powered vibratory tools more than doubles the risk of CTS\n\nThere is substantial evidence for similar or even higher risks from prolonged and highly repetitious flexion and extension of the wrist, especially when allied with a forceful grip.\n\nOn the balance of evidence keyboard and computer use do not cause CTS.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nElements of this review were supported by a grant from the Health and Safety Executive with a remit related to optimising case definitions of upper limb disorders.
