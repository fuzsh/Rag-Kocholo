        "text": "From: San Francisco, California\n\nActive: 1996-present\n\nI first heard of them: when I saw some mentions in magazines that Roddy Bottum of Faith No More had put together his own band\n\nSound: I picked up the Seasick album in 1996, and yeah, this could hardly have been more of a departure from Faith No More while still staying under the heading of rock. Instead of abrasive, symphonically complex tracks with dramatic keyboard parts, these were bubblegum punk-pop songs that sounded like they'd been recorded on a boombox on someone's back patio on a lazy weekend afternoon.\n\nListening station: And yet I'm not going to post any of those songs here, because while I lost track of Imperial Teen at the turn of the century, the few songs I heard from their post-Seasick career impressed me a bit more. (Note: the \"Open Season\" here is a completely different song from the one that's #1 on my chart.)"
