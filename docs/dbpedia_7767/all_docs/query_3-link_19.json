For several hundred years, the most popular piano style was classical piano. Since its invention in the early 18th century, and continuing to this day, the piano has been a dominant force in the development of classical music.Â\n\nThe piano likewise became a driving force behind the development of several crucial American music styles such as ragtime, boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, and rock and roll. All of these styles owe a debt of gratitude to the dynamic expressiveness of the piano and the range of sounds and possibilities the instrument is capable of producing. There are some key differences between jazz and classical piano including the role of improvisation and rhythm that are worth exploring.\n\nClassical styles of piano\n\nThe piano, or pianoforte as it was originally called, was initially invented around the year 1700 by the Italian instrument builder Bartolomeo Cristofori. Since then it has become the dominant force in the progression of classical music and harmony in general. The dynamic range of the piano combined with the ability to easily produce chords with up to 10 voices helped to revolutionize composerâs sonorities and concepts.\n\nFamous classical piano playing styles\n\nOne of the most famous classical piano playing styles comes from the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven. âFur Eliseâ sheet music is one of the best examples of romantic-era styles of piano and a standard piece of piano repertoire for beginning to intermediate pianists.\n\nGo to the lesson\n\nAnother wonderful example in the classical piano music genre is âCanon in Dâ by Johann Pachelbel.

The piano played a crucial role in the development of all of these styles, in various ways.\n\nFamous jazz piano playing styles\n\nOne of the most influential pieces of jazz piano styles is the Scott Joplin tune âThe Entertainer.â The tune is one of the best examples of ragtime playing.\n\nGo to the lesson\n\nRagtime involves an alternating pattern of bass notes and chords in the left hand, with repetitive melodies and riffs in the right hand. Like most piano playing styles, there are easy piano song arrangements of âThe Entertainerâ and other more difficult ragtime and jazz pieces.\n\nAnother great example of the jazz piano music genre is the standard tune âAutumn Leaves.â Jazz standards are typically songs that are considered part of the âGreat American Songbook.â They were most frequently composed to be included in musicals or early films. The tune âAutumn Leavesâ was originally composed in 1946 by Joseph Kosma for the film Les Portes de la nuit (Gates of the Night). The song is an excellent way for pianistâs to learn jazz melody in music.\n\nRock and pop piano styles\n\nThe influence of the piano in rock and pop music cannot be overstated, with many famous black piano players among the icons who started their careers on the keys. Many iconic rock and pop musicians started their musical careers learning how to play the piano and many call upon its strengths as their primary composing instrument. From the driving riffs of Elton John to the emotional depths of Freddie Mercury to the simple elegance of the Beatles, the piano has a major role in the worlds of rock and pop music.\n\nFamous rock piano styles\n\nOne of the best examples of rock piano style is from the prolific pianist and songwriter Billy Joel. His tune âPiano Manâ is a classic piece for the beginning to intermediate pianist.
