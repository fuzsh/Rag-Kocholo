        "text": "Paisley Radicals: free, creative online workshops if you live in Renfrewshire – CLOSED\n\nPosted: 3rd April 2020\n\nAs part of the Paisley Radicals project, Civil Disobedience and Renfrewshire Council are running a series of free, creative online workshops, starting in April 2020.\n\nThe workshops are open to anyone 14+ with a Renfrewshire postcode and will cover:\n\nHeritage\n\nCreative writing\n\nActing\n\nPhysical theatre\n\nDesign\n\nYou’ll be asked to take part in group video conferencing online, so you’ll need access to a PC, laptop or smartphone with WIFI/data. Each session will last no longer than 90 minutes.\n\nThere’s no cost for the workshops; you’ll simply need to fill out and return an evaluation form after the close of project.\n\nIf you take part in the workshops, you’ll also have the opportunity to take part in the live performance elements of Paisley Radicals later in the year. (More details and dates to be confirmed as soon as we have guidelines from the authorities around public gatherings.)\n\nWant more information?\n\nFor more information and to sign up for the workshops, please contact Civil Disobedience Director Barry Church-Woods.\n\nEmail: barry@wearecivildisobedience.com\n\nIllustrator/graphic design job – CLOSED\n\nPosted: 7th March 2019\n\nWe’re looking for a fantastic illustrator/graphic designer to make us a striking, possibly retro-feel poster/leaflet for a show we’re producing at the Edinburgh Fringe this year. We want to kick off ASAP, with a preliminary delivery deadline set for later this month.\n\nThe show (created by PNME, the Pittsburgh New Music Ensemble) is called The Gray Cat and the Flounder, and although it’s (mostly) not about an actual cat and flounder, these two characters are very central to the narrative.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of this work, which makes it quite unique in a Fringe context, is that it uses binaural technology – meaning all audience members are supplied with special headphones to wear during the show.\n\nMotif and design notes\n\nOur top idea for the motif is a striking image of a cat under a full moon (perhaps even just a silhouette), wearing a set of headphones.\n\nWe’re thinking a “retro” look would work well for the marketing collateral, perhaps with a nod to Art Deco or a vintage Hollywood film poster. We reckon something a bit more quirky/playful could also be a good fit…possibly a homage to 1950s retro kitsch, or even Keith Haring.\n\nWe’re not 100% set on any one style at this stage, so we’re open to ideas and suggestions from any designer we commission.\n\nThe colour lime green (pantone 375c) needs to be incorporated somewhere in the image, as this is part of PNME’s brand identity.\n\nWe’re currently considering two options:\n\n1) Illustrator and graphic designer\n\nWe commission an illustrator to create original artwork for the poster/leaflet and prime it for graphics, then get a graphic designer to build the poster/leaflet/advert design around the illustration. Ideally, we’d like to find one person who can do both these elements (or an established team who can collaborate to get it all done), but we may also hire an illustrator to create the original artwork, then work with a separate graphic designer to create the marketing collateral.\n\n2) Graphic designer only\n\nWe commission a graphic designer to create a strong poster/leaflet design, based on the above brief, but without any original illustration (presumably using stock illustrations or other techniques to build the image).\n\nEnd product: delivery requirements\n\nIn terms of the finished product, we’d be looking for print-ready files of a poster design (A3), a leaflet design (A5), and 4-6 other variations of the final image in different dimensions – at least one landscape – to be used for railing boards, banner etc. (dimensions TBC when the job starts).\n\nIf possible, we’d also be keen to factor in a little bit of post-delivery work in the quote, in case we need additional versions/file formats.\n\nInterested?\n\nIf you want to be considered for the job, please send us an email specifying what you could deliver (illustration only; an image based on graphic design work only; both illustration and graphic design work), along with:\n\nany ideas/suggestions you have on the image/design\n\na ballpark quote (for your total fee)\n\nlinks to work samples (if you haven’t already submitted this)\n\nWhen quoting, it would be really helpful if you could provide an estimate of your fee as a whole (assuming a reasonable amount of feedback/edits), not just an hourly rate.\n\nPlease send the above info to:\n\njosef@wearecivildisobedience.com\n\nApplication deadline and delivery\n\nPlease get in touch by Sunday 10th March 2019. We are hoping to start work on this w/c 11th March, with the aim to have the finished marketing collateral artwork finalised and delivered by 31st March.\n\nCasting call for ‘Bugle Boys’ – CLOSED\n\nCivil Disobedience is currently casting triple threat male (and male-identifying) performers for our 2018 co-production with Moira Bennett, Bugle Boys: A salute to The Andrews Sisters.\n\nIndustry rates apply.\n\nKey words: Drag. Dames. Singer. Harmonies. Comedy Chops. Ad-lib\n\nA bit about the show\n\nLong before The Spice Girls, Bananarama, and The Supremes, The Andrews Sisters ruled the charts. As the original girl group they were a global sensation during their heyday in the late 1930s and throughout the 1940s, selling records by the millions.\n\nIn Bugle Boys, a side-splitting celebration of The Andrews Sisters’ legacy, Patty, Maxene and LaVerne are played by three over-the-top men, frocked-up to the nines. Singing live, the “girls” perform some of the group’s most beloved classics, complete with sassy dance moves and epic eyerolls. Between numbers, they bitch and squabble, delivering a ludicrously fictitious tale of their life and career, as well as a generous side of shade.\n\nBugle Boys: A salute to The Andrews Sisters is an original Australian production, conceived and written by John Livings.\n\nBugle Boys invade the UK\n\nBuilding on the show’s Australian success, a UK production of Bugle Boys is currently in development, due to hit Edinburgh stages this summer for a scratch night run, followed by a full run at the 2018 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. The Edinburgh show will star an all-new cast of UK talent, and a freshly adapted script by John.\n\nThe show’s original Australian producer Moira Bennett is leading the development, with the Civil Disobedience team on-board as co-producers. Barry Church-Woods is directing the UK production.\n\nCasting call\n\nWe’re currently casting for the three leads.\n\nWe’re keen to hear from male-identifying triple threat performers with great singing voices and excellent comedy chops. You’ll need to have a good ear for harmonies and be used to playing in tight ensembles.\n\nThink: Scotch & Wry, Victor and Barry, Ginger Minj, bawdry, vaudeville, dames, glamour, vintage, 1930s, theatre for the masses.\n\nInitial availability: July-September 2018 for Phase 1\n\nExpressions of interest:\n\nKeen? Send an email to Barry Church-Woods telling him why you should be considered for audition with links to supporting materials.\n\nbarry@wearecivildisobedience.com\n\nCivil Disobedience is an equal opportunities employer and as such welcomes applications from any performer who feels they can fulfil the criteria creatively. We particularly welcome applications from the BAME community.\n\n15/07/17\n\nEdinburgh Fringe Street Team – CLOSED\n\nWe’re currently recruiting a street team to support the marketing of shows across our entire Fringe portfolio. A fun, energetic and engaging personality is essential. As is a love of art.\n\nOur programme…\n\nThis year at the Edinburgh Fringe we are presenting an ambitious season of work, including drag superstars, misunderstood monsters, digital aficionados, a German, accordion-wielding pop icon, deliciously freaky songbirds, international sex symbols, 1960s zombies with a modern twist, an immersive theatre happening that is already taking the US by storm, and a Grammy-nominated music legend. Add to that world class new theatre addressing social justice, digital addiction, and forgotten icons, and you’ll understand why we’re so proud of what we do.\n\nYou’ll find a full listing of the shows we’re producing on our live projects page.\n\nWe genuinely believe our 2017 Fringe portfolio is one of the best on the Fringe, with something to suit all types and tastes – but we need help letting people know about it.\n\nWho we’re looking for…\n\nWe’re want to recruit a team of freaks, geeks and uniques who will get to know the work, and then be willing to pound the pavements 6 hours per day chatting about it (while flyering individual shows and our programme as a whole).\n\nYou’ll need to be outgoing, positive, and enjoy chatting to strangers. You don’t necessarily need lots of experience to do this job, but a keen interest in all things art, comedy, music, cabaret, and theatre is a given.\n\nIt’s also essential that you’re punctual and reliable, as we are working with a whole host of artists who will be paying for your services and depending on your help to push their shows.\n\nContracts and pay…\n\nContracts are for 36 hours per week over 6 days, though we are open to negotiation. A standard fee of £300 per week applies.\n\nHow to apply/deadline…\n\nApply in the way you think is most appropriate, by emailing Barry Church-Woods on:\n\nbarry@wearecivildisobedience.com\n\nThe deadline for applications is 5pm on 19th of July 2017.\n\nFace to face/Skype interviews will be held on July 21st.\n\nLocation: Edinburgh\n\nFor further information, please contact Barry Church-Woods), or have a look around our website:\n\nAbout Civil Disobedience\n\nMeet the team\n\nShows currently on sale\n\nOur services\n\nThe deadline for applications is Wednesday 19th July 2017 at 17:00.\n\n02/06/17\n\nMusicians/chorus wanted: Sasquatch, The Opera – CLOSED\n\nRoddy Bottum (film composer and founding member of rock group Faith No More) is debuting a new, experimental work, Sasquatch, The Opera, at the Edinburgh Fringe this year. Produced by Civil Disobedience, it will be playing a full run at Summerhall this August and is currently casting for musicians and chorus members.\n\nMUSICIANS\n\nRoddy himself will be playing synths along with the MD, Victoria Falconer. We are looking for the following musicians:\n\nA timpani player\n\nTwo trumpets or french horns\n\nArtists must be available 20:30 – 22:30 nightly, 2-27 August, and for some rehearsal time in the days leading up to the 2nd. A negotiable show fee will be paid, no but accommodation provided.\n\nIdeally we’d like to work with performers either based in Edinburgh, or who will be here for the Fringe anyway.\n\nCHORUS\n\nPrincipal singing roles have been cast in NYC, but we’re now casting for the chorus. Again, we’d like to draw from local artists, or those already presenting at the Fringe. You need to be a competent (but not necessarily trained) singer, and keen to push yourself towards the avant-garde. Diversity is key here.\n\nArtists must be available 20:30 – 22:30 nightly, 2-27 August, and for some rehearsal time in the days leading up to the 2nd. Per diems will be paid, but no accommodation provided.\n\nThere is potential for the Edinburgh cast to be involved with further touring opportunities, both within the UK and abroad, later in the year and beyond.\n\nAesthetic key words: Talent, Diversity, Unconventional, Meth Lab, Experimental, Trailer Trash.\n\nWe are looking to fill the following roles:\n\n2 x bass/baritone\n\n2 x tenor\n\n2 x alto (non-gender specific)\n\nHOW TO APPLY\n\nPlease email expressions of interest and supporting materials to MD, Vicky Falconer:\n\nhello@victoriafalconer.com\n\nTitle the email ‘Sasquatch Ensemble’.\n\nAUDITIONS\n\nLive auditions will be held in London for both musicians and singers on Monday 5th / Tuesday 6th June, but filmed audition clips will also be accepted until Monday 12th June.\n\nFore more details, contact Vicky (see above).\n\nMORE ABOUT THE SHOW\n\nThis modern opera is a drug-fuelled and surreal take on the tale of the Sasquatch – a tragic myth retold, in which Bottum holds a mirror up to his own experience as the first openly gay man in the extremely macho world of rock and roll.\n\nIt’s also a dark love story that revolves around a backwoods family who make a living selling the story of the Sasquatch to willing tourists – and what happens when they come across the real monster.\n\nHere’s what Roddy has to say about it:\n\n“The impetus for my opera is a theme I’m particularly fond of – that of the misunderstood monster. I reference the Elephant Man, Frankenstein, King Kong and a 100lb four-year-old I one saw on Jerry Springer as characters of inspiration… It’s not your typical opera and I’m looking for unorthodox creatively adventurous types, even newcomers to the world of theatre. Definitely seeking a queer-friendly cast, as culturally and racially diverse as possible.”\n\nSome further words from Roddy on the project can be viewed here.\n\n19/01/17\n\nModels wanted for St Andrews runway show – CLOSED\n\nWe’re currently working with BID St Andrews to help deliver the live elements of the St Andrews Fashion Festival (STAFF) in February 2017, including a multimedia runway show, ‘FASHION’, on Saturday 11th Feb.\n\nFASHION is an exciting showcase of some of the best collections in town, and we want to make it as much a live performance as a runway show.
