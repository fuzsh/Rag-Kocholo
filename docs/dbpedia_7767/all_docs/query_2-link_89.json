        "text": "The bloated and enthusiastic teenage reviews are intruding ever more on the concise adult summaries. Good. Fifteen-year-old Dave may be a bit of an idiot, but he generally has better taste. Stop listening to single-one-hour-long-song albums and stick some Green Day on.\n\nReviews of albums from bands beginning with E, F, G and H, written for dooyoo.co.uk from 2001–2008.\n\nE\n\nEarth\n\nThe Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull\n\n***\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nEarth continue to play their Western-tinged drone doom rock on this year's release, but the style has subtly changed since the days of 'HEX' to favour a more bluesy and, overall, more optimistic approach.\n\nThe songs are still extended, minimal, repetitive compositions based around seriously sloooooow guitar melodies, but the atmosphere is less depressing and much more uplifting this time round, with only a couple of exceptions in the form of later songs such as 'Omens and Portents II: Carrion Crow' that return to the old, darker style. The piano comes to the fore in 'Engine of Ruin' to add some variety, but this is still essentially an album geared towards hypnotic repetition of simplistic but effective melodies. This is its strength and its weakness.\n\nThe main problem here is that the album can be incredibly dull if you're not in the right mood, and the relative absence of sound effects and psychedelic elements compared to earlier albums makes it less atmospheric. Still a nice album to fall asleep to, or to listen through headphones while wandering a desert road in the setting sun.\n\n1. Omens and Portents I: The Driver\n\n2. Rise to Glory\n\n3.

The Bees Made Honey in the Lion's Skull\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nNothing But Death Remains\n\n***\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nThe first album from Swedish death metal legends Edge of Sanity is a modest debut indeed, entirely lacking the progressive tendencies that would characterise the rest of the band's career in varying degrees, and instead serving up some comparatively simple and catchy old-school death metal riffs. While the band doesn't have its own identity at this point, and the lo-fi sound quality is annoying at times (particularly the tinny drums), this is still an enjoyable collection of early death metal songs.\n\nThe use of keyboards is perhaps the closest the music comes to 'progressive,' adding a horror film feel, and each song varies between fast and slow sections to keep the listener guessing. 'Human Aberration' contains the most instantly gratifying guitar riff, while other such as 'Maze of Existence' concentrate on slower melodies performed by both guitarists in harmonic unison. There's nothing amateur about this album, especially in the arrangement of the tracks that sees 'Angel of Distress' speeding along and overlapping into the slower 'Impulsive Necroplasma,' but anyone approaching from later in the band's discography may be disappointed by its simplicity.\n\n1. Tales...\n\n2. Human Aberration\n\n3. Maze of Existence (Epidemic Reign, Part I)\n\n4. The Dead\n\n5. Decepted By the Cross\n\n6. Angel of Distress\n\n7. Impulsive Necroplasma (Epidemic Reign, Part II)\n\n8. Immortal Souls\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nThe Spectral Sorrows\n\n****\n\nWritten on .07.08\n\n'The Spectral Sorrows' is a natural half-way point between the densely progressive and heavy 'Unorthodox' and the more accessible death metal sound of 'Purgatory Afterglow,' and strikes a nice balance between the two. The melodic quotient is increased significantly, from the slow guitar harmonies and atmospheric sections that pervade almost every track to the occasional clean vocals, culminating in the surprising deviation of 'Sacrified,' a gothic rock song that sounds just like Sisters of Mercy. There's also a punk-influenced song in the form of 'Feedin' the Charlatan,' an effective Manowar cover that doesn't ruin the song with growled vocals as most death covers of classic heavy metal tend to, and melodic interludes in the first and last tracks.\n\nIf this is the point at which Edge of Sanity started to move towards a more mainstream sound, it's also the point at which their experiments became less coherent and more prone to failure. There are some excellent moments on this album, memorably the tremolo-picking guitar riffs of 'Darkday' that foreshadow the later sound of Amon Amarth, but a few too many deviations from the death metal sound to allow for complete credibility, particularly with the upbeat drums that often don't suit the songs at all.\n\n1.

On the Other Side\n\n10. Sacrified\n\n11. Waiting to Die\n\n12. Feedin' the Charlatan\n\n13. A Serenade for the Dead\n\nAdvantages: Talented death metal with a nice melodic angle.\n\nDisadvantages: Concessions towards accessibility are mostly disappointing.\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nUntil Eternity Ends\n\n**\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nThis four-song E.P. was released prior to 'Purgatory Afterglow' containing original material that, according to the band's view, \"didn't fit\" with their new style. The style here is certainly a fairly radical departure from the band's traditional death metal sound into avenues more melodic and mainstream than they had attempted previously, but despite a few cool guitars here and there, this ends up being a largely unsatisfying and somewhat pointless release.\n\nThe title song follows a more traditional rock direction than metal, the deathy style only being maintained by the heavy instruments. The riffs are medium tempo and wouldn't be out of place in a stoner rock band, and the vocals are accordingly sung in a deep spoken word style rather than growled. This song is led by a memorable guitar riff of the type sadly absent hereafter on the release. 'Eternal Eclipse' is a chorus-centric song with clean singing vocals, and almost as a conscious reactionary move, 'Bleed' is a fast, hard and energetic piece of punk-death-metal that sounds forced.\n\nI have no idea whether the final cover of the Police's 'Invisible Sun' compares to the original, but like their earlier cover of Manowar, this sounds very authentic, with minimal conversion to death metal. The harmony singing will be enough to scare away genre purists, and although it's a nice idea, it doesn't really work.\n\n1. Until Eternity Ends\n\n2. Eternal Eclipse\n\n3. Bleed\n\n4. Invisible Sun (The Police cover)\n\nAdvantages: Continuing to experiment with melody in the death metal genre.\n\nDisadvantages: Four sub-standard songs.\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nPurgatory Afterglow\n\n***\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\n'Purgatory Afterglow' had the potential to be a phenomenal classic of death metal, but sadly Dan Swanö and co. didn't always succeed in their experiments. Continuing the band's advancement towards a more commercially viable sound, this is truly one of the most approachable death metal albums I've ever heard, with songs such as the opener 'Twilight' in particular fusing solid death metal riffs with a catchy chorus and progressive sections, but too many songs fail to impress.\n\nSwanö's vocals are the most noticeable element here, for better and worse. His death metal vocals range from a low growl to a piercing shriek, the two alternating successfully in 'Of Darksome Origin,' but some of his 'clean' vocals are less well managed. The sung and spoken word sections of 'Twilight' work well, but the entirely sung 'Blood-Colored' is a mediocre attempt at death-influenced groove metal, while 'Black Tears' and 'Song of Sirens' respectively flirt with gothic metal and hardcore punk to irritating extents. There are some great ideas here, but too many negatives cancel them out.\n\n1. Twilight\n\n2. Of Darksome Origin\n\n3. Blood-Colored\n\n4. Silent\n\n5. Black Tears\n\n6. Elegy\n\n7. Velvet Dreams\n\n8. Enter Chaos\n\n9. The Sinner and the Sadness\n\n10. Song of Sirens\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nCrimson\n\n****\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nDan Swanö's forty-minute death metal composition 'Crimson' is far from a masterpiece or inspired extreme metal classic, but it's still perfectly admirable and enjoyable as a bold experiment in progressive metal that avoids the usual pitfalls. This album/song never seems indulgent or showy in the slightest, and makes for a genuinely enjoyable, coherent and varied listening experience for the patient death metal fan.\n\nComparisons to Green Carnation's hour-long 'Light of Day, Day of Darkness' and Opeth's work around the period are inevitable, especially due to the guest presence of Mikael Åkerfeldt, but I'd say this is a little less accomplished than either, and certainly suffers from over-stretching an idea. The frequency of repeated melodies and sections is a nice touch that maintains the sense that this is genuinely all the same song despite the frequent lapses into different styles, but its main failing is probably that it attempts a little too much, a little too often. Each movement lasts for a couple of minutes before launching into the next, often radically different section, meaning this is quite a bumpy ride.\n\n'Crimson' should, however, be of particular interest to prog fans looking for something a bit darker, and with its sci-fi concept reminiscent of Rush, it's certainly true to the prog rock tradition, even if it doesn't make quite as much of an impact as it would like to.\n\n1. Crimson\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nInfernal\n\n***\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nEdge of Sanity's then-final album with Dan Swanö (he would reform the band briefly for 2003's 'Crimson II') suffers immensely from the very obvious inner turmoil of the band at this late stage, evidenced by the wide gulf between the more progressive songs written by Swanö and the more consciously death metal works of the others. By contrast to the band's earlier work, this can't help but sound like a severely half-assed excuse for an album, as the band goes through the motions and rarely hits on the classic melodies that used to come so naturally.\n\n'Hell Is Where the Heart Is' is a reasonable opener, even if it steals its opening riff from Testament, but after this the album goes rapidly downhill. Songs like 'Helter Skelter' and 'The Bleakness of It All' are nothing but fast and repetitive, tedious death metal, while Swanö's clean vocals continue to be unreliable when called in for the always compulsory gothic metal song that here takes the form of the weak 'Losing Myself.' More successful are the attempts to sound like Opeth, '15:36' beginning nice and moody before ending in a more upbeat manner reminiscent of Edge of Sanity's classic 'Twilight,' but the best song has to be the aptly-named 'The Last Song' with its dark piano opening and slow, haunting melodies, the only song on here that I would really recommend.\n\n1. Hell Is Where the Heart Is\n\n2. Helter Skelter\n\n3. 15:36\n\n4. The Bleakness of It All\n\n5. Damned (By the Damned)\n\n6. Forever Together Forever\n\n7. Losing Myself\n\n8. Hollow\n\n9. Inferno\n\n10. Burn the Sun\n\n11. The Last Song\n\nEdge of Sanity\n\nCrimson II\n\n***\n\nWritten on 01.07.08\n\nSeven years after recording the forty-minute death metal epic 'Crimson,' Dan Swanö reformed Edge of Sanity one time only, to record this direct sequel. With very few direct call-backs to its predecessor, added keyboards and a slightly longer playing time of forty-three minutes, this stands proudly apart from the first album as a separate entity, which is probably for the best as its inferior quality doesn't serve to tarnish the enjoyable original.\n\nThis isn't a bad album, but it's a little unnecessary, and certainly nowhere near as accomplished as 'Crimson,' even at its messiest points. Swanö re-uses many of the ideas here, but this time the album is handily/annoyingly (delete as appropriate) arranged with each separate movement as a distinct track. This is a hugely pointless exercise that only serves to highlight the repetitive nature of the music, and as each track only lasts for one minute (on average) it's not as if listeners are going to be picking and choosing their favourites to put on their iPod.\n\nMy main grievance with this album is the over-reliance on keyboards, something that serves to align this release with modern melodic death metal from the likes of Dark Tranquillity and Soilwork, rather than harking back to the classic nineties. The melodic guitars are also a lot less memorable, and the greatest example of this sequel's comparative inferiority is that the resurgence of the main riff from the 1996 album in 'The Silent Threat' is by far its stand-out moment (exactly the same thing happened when I heard Queenryche's disappointing 'Operation: Mindcrime II'). A nice idea in concept, but flawed in execution, it should still be of interest to those entranced by long songs.\n\n1. The Forbidden Words I\n\n2. The Forbidden Words II\n\n3. Incantation I\n\n4.

As well as some fairly generic stuff like their second album 'Kingdom of Madness,' which at least sows the seeds for the greatness to follow, from a band that was very young at the time.\n\nThe album is hindered by poor production quality that affects the guitar tone particularly, but most of the elements are still here that make for great Edguy songs, they're just a little unconfident and jumbled in their execution. Tobias Sammet's Angra-style vocals aren't quite up to their later standard and vary very little, while attempts to be more epic in 'Angel Rebellion' and most notably the severely overlong eighteen-minute finale 'The Kingdom' are rather amateurish. This is understandable and necessary however, in order that the band could later move forward with classics like 'Theatre of Salvation.'\n\nThis is pure power metal with a nice melodic angle and some catchy choruses, but anyone approaching from later in the Edguy discography, as listeners inevitably will, may be disappointed. Then again, if all they're heard is the abominable 'Rocket Ride,' this could help to steer them on a more rewarding path.\n\n1. Paradise\n\n2. Wings of a Dream\n\n3. Heart of Twilight\n\n4.

The Kingdom\n\nEdguy\n\nVain Glory Opera\n\n****\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\nOnly a year after the mediocre 'Kingdom of Madness,' Edguy's career takes a huge leap with the excellent 'Vain Glory Opera,' an album that would surely be one of the great classics of German power metal if the band hadn't topped it with the even better follow-ups. The big change here comes in the increased prominence of (synthesised) orchestral elements, supplemented by a whole lot of acoustic guitar and melody in surprising places, but at its core this is simple, fun and incredibly catchy power metal at its best. It also possesses the distinctive Edguy sound that's all too easy to love.\n\nSongs like the fairly epic 'Until We Rise Again' are bombastic power metal in the style Tobias Sammet would later take over to side project Avantasia, featuring memorable guitar melodies and vocal lines, but the best songs here come in the centre of the album, the section I listen to the most. 'Out of Control' is an energetic and wailing song featuring a chorus duet with Blind Guardian's Hansi Kürsch, and is certainly high among my favourite Edguy songs. 'Vain Glory Opera' itself shamelessly steals from Europe in its blaring keyboard melody but is still irresistible, and 'Fairytale' is a great fast and hard song with a nice guitar solo. The album's weaker moments come in the form of the ballads 'Scarlet Rose' and 'Tomorrow,' but the band would never really learn its lesson here.\n\n1. Overture\n\n2. Until We Rise Again\n\n3.

Hymn (Ultravox cover)\n\nEdguy\n\nTheatre of Salvation\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\n'Theatre of Salvation' is one of Edguy's finest albums, the beginning of a classic trilogy that led to 'Mandrake' and 'Hellfire Club' (a trilogy only in as far as they're my three favourites). Tobias Sammet's operatic and symphonic flair reaches its zenith here before exploding into the side project Avantasia to let off steam and allow Edguy to regain a little simplicity, but the distinctive sound benefits this album and doesn't impede its more straightforward moments.\n\nThe orchestral elements are more expertly integrated than on 'Vain Glory Opera,' and the songs here tend to be a little more progressive, evidenced by the multiple choruses of the excellent opener 'Babylon,' a song that just seems to keep on reinventing itself until the very end without seeming overbearing. The closing title track perhaps goes a little too far with its incorporation of a choir and extended length, but it's saved by a magnificent chorus that is guaranteed to stay with the listener for a long time afterwards.\n\nEven the token power ballad 'Land of the Miracle' fails to be completely awful as previous ones were, despite being admittedly one of the cheesiest things I've ever heard, and the only real disappointment of this album is that the central section (tracks five to eight) doesn't really stand out, comprising songs that are strong in their own right, but lack any real distinctiveness.\n\n1. The Healing Vision\n\n2. Babylon\n\n3. The Headless Game\n\n4. Land of the Miracle\n\n5. Wake Up the King\n\n6. Falling Down\n\n7. Arrows Fly\n\n8. Holy Shadows\n\n9. Another Time\n\n10. The Unbeliever\n\n11. Theater of Salvation\n\nEdguy\n\nMandrake\n\nThe Joker Smiles\n\n****\n\nWritten on 28.09.06\n\nTobias Sammett’s ambitious side project ‘Avantasia’ provided the Edguy songwriter with an outlet to let off his grandiose epic steam, allowing for 2002’s ‘Mandrake’ to follow a more stripped and laid-back approach that works a lot better as a result. While the young Germans’ most recent album sees them finally stepping over the dreaded Bon Jovi threshold, the older ‘Mandrake’ is fast and fun heavy metal at its most simplistically entertaining.\n\nThe longer songs don’t signify a greater degree of progression as much as a tendency for extended guitar solos and chorus reprises, the exception being the reasonably epic ‘The Pharaoh,’ Edguy’s inevitable Ancient Egypt themed song (doesn’t every metal band have at least one?) Divided into three distinct movements, this song flows along as a traditional rock epic, led by the vocals and customary instruments without feeling the need for the sort of additional orchestral and symphonic distractions present on the band’s earlier work. It’s one of the album’s finest offerings, a long song that truly lasts out and keeps the listener entertained, thus following in the footsteps of Iron Maiden rather than Helloween.\n\nThe other songs that come in longer than average follow far more simplistic frameworks, and utilise intrusive synthesisers in a blatant attempt to repeat the success of Europe’s ‘The Final Countdown.’ ‘Tears of a Mandrake’ and ‘The Devil & the Savant’ are similar in this way to the band’s earlier ‘Vain Glory Opera,’ but the whole thing sounds a lot more accomplished this time. The choruses are also justifiably fantastic, and the inevitable resurgences towards the end become genuinely eagerly anticipated. You know, if you’re into that whole mellow wailing chorus thing that I clearly am.\n\nThe majority of the album follows classic power metal territory, with four- to five-minute speedy anthems led by distinct riffs and featuring catchy choruses. None stand out as particularly unique or ground-breaking, but that’s not really the goal of any album that so unashamedly attempts to revive an ’80s sound in the 21st century. ‘Golden Dawn’ and ‘Fallen Angels’ could easily be Iron Maiden B-sides with a slightly different voice, while the duller ‘All the Clowns’ and 'Save Us Now' follow more of a mellow glam rock pathfinder. ‘Nailed to the Wheel’ attempts something of a heavier sound aided by modern production.\n\nAll of these are good songs, but sound so generic and interchangeable as to be easily forgettable, despite the primitivistic enjoyment they could bring to denim-clad Neanderthal metalheads. ‘Jerusalem’ is a different story, and is perhaps the most ambitious song on the album, incorporating unusual percussion and synthesiser techniques and playing around somewhat with structure. It’s not a cover of Blake in case you’re wondering – I have enough of those already. ‘Wash Away the Poison’ and ‘Painting on the Wall’ are the necessary power ballads, the second one being several times better than the first; despite all that unoriginality, I never feel it’s lasted quite long enough by the advent of the sad fade-out.\n\nEdguy would go on to produce a very similar and slightly better album with 2004’s ‘Hellfire Club,’ but ‘Mandrake’ remains one of their best, and could easily have formed a coherent double album with its successor. The eerily frosty cover art depicting a sinister jester type doll thing adds a nice visual topping to an excellent feast of an album that proudly boasts cheese as its primary ingredient. ‘The Pharaoh’ is a pretty great song, and the rest is a whole lot of outdated German fun that really appeals to imbeciles stuck in a time warp like myself.\n\n1. Tears of a Mandrake\n\n2. Golden Dawn\n\n3. Jerusalem\n\n4. All the Clowns\n\n5. Nailed to the Wheel\n\n6. The Pharaoh\n\n7. Wash Away the Poison\n\n8. Fallen Angels\n\n9. Painting on the Wall\n\n10.

The Devil & the Savant\n\nAdvantages: Excellent heavy metal from excited Europeans.\n\nDisadvantages: It's all been heard before.\n\nEdguy\n\nHellfire Club\n\nStriking Out From Paradise\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 13.01.05\n\nInnuendo-heavy power metal band Edguy formed while still at high school in Fulda, and these crazy young Germans already have an impressive discography behind them. 'Hellfire Club' is their most recent release and made for one of the most enjoyable metal albums of 2004. Edguy have a knack for producing songs that teeter on the edge of cheesy and unlistenable but somehow become instant classics that never grow old. I like them.\n\nTHE EDGUYS\n\nTobias Sammet - vocals\n\nDirk Sauer - guitars\n\nJens Ludwig - guitars\n\nTobias Exxel - bass\n\nFelix Bohnke - drums\n\nPower metal is always a fun genre, but Hellfire Club's perfect grasp of traditional heavy metal from the likes of Judas Priest and Helloween to their more flamboyant European contemporaries Blind Guardian and Stratovarius makes for an album that may not be strictly original, but that brings back the fun side of heavy metal to the fore. Unlike some of the band's previous albums (and Tobias' excellent side project 'Avantasia'), the experimentation on this album is toned down to make way for more straightforward but varied guitar riffs, solos and classic sing-along choruses.\n\nHELLFIRE CLUB\n\n1. Mysteria\n\n2. The Piper Never Dies\n\n3. We Don't Need a Hero\n\n4. Down to the Devil\n\n5. King of Fools\n\n6. Forever\n\n7. Under the Moon\n\n8. Lavatory Love Machine\n\n9. Rise of the Morning Glory\n\n10. Lucifer in Love\n\n11. Navigator\n\n12. The Spirit Will Remain\n\nThe album opens with a scream from Tobias: 'ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the freak show!' A nice and polite introduction that promises tragically deformed humans being forced to perform for your perversions (you people make me sick, I hate you all) but delivers twelve ace tracks. I know which I would prefer, how about you?\n\nOriginally planned as the title for the album, but later changed for reasons that wouldn't be worth going in to even if I was aware of them, 'Mysteria' is a classic speedy opening anthem that starts the CD as it means to go on with a memorable overblown chorus, the staple of good power metal as well as the fairly rubbish stuff. Along with 'Under the Moon' and the aggressive but inspired 'Rise of the Morning Glory,' this forms the heavier part of the album.\n\nA softer approach comes from the (dare I say it) Bon Jovi-esque power ballad 'Forever' and the orchestral climax 'The Spirit Will Remain,' both of which show a more progressive side to Edguy. The ten minute epic 'The Piper Never Dies' also somehow manages to retain interest throughout, and my mind rarely allows the chorus to leave my head. Get out.\n\nFor all this variety, Edguy are at their very best when pounding out a fast and light rocking anthem. 'King of Fools' and the uncompromisingly double-entendric 'Lavatory Love Machine' were released as singles, although 'Down to the Devil,' 'We Don't Need a Hero' and 'Navigator' catch the band at their very, very best. A satisfying and fun album from the boys who brought you 'Mandrake.'\n\nAnd 'Lucifer in Love' is just a silly interlude thing with the Devil having sex or something. You can't see it, but you can almost imagine, although I don't.\n\nVERDICT\n\nEverything on here has been heard before in some form or another, but 'Hellfire Club' deserves the acclaim it has received within the genre. Fun, fast and incredibly energetic, Edguy are clearly among the leaders of power metal and thankfully seem able to balance overblown artistic expression with fun, crowd-pleasing songs thanks to the presence of side projects. Not everyone's cup of tea, but fans of Iron Maiden, Gamma Ray or anything else that has ever featured rip-roaring verses and classy guitar solos should pick up a copy today.\n\n\"And when she asks me what I'd like to eat\n\nI realise the domina feels the same\n\nAnd I reply: 'What about your pie?'\"\n\n- Edguy, Lavatory Love Machine\n\nEdguy\n\nSuperheroes\n\n**\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\nThis short release towards the end of 2005 brought my appreciation of Edguy to an end, as they descended overnight from power metal leaders to bland, commercial hard rock imitation act. The excellent album 'Hellfire Club' already hinted at this new direction to an extent, but managed to pull it off without being overwhelmingly cheesy and awful as this one sadly turns out to be.\n\n'Superheroes' itself is a fair song, if you're a fan of Bon Jovi style anthemic rock (which I don't happen to be). The chorus is memorable, if completely derivative, and the main guitar riff is overburdened by shiny pop keyboard so as to completely ruin it. Even worse is the entirely pointless 'epic version' tagged on to the end of the E.P., which replaces the rock instruments with piano and orchestra in a wholly unsatisfying remake.\n\n'Spooks in the Attic' is faster and more energetic, but fails to stand out, and the best thing that can be said about the weak ballad 'Blessing in Disguise' is that it at least manages to be atmospheric. 'Judas at the Opera' seems like a failed attempt to recapture the epic style of old Edguy, and the Magnum cover is merely acceptable. A weak release in every way, foreboding of bad things to come from what was, at the time, one of my favourite bands.\n\n1. Superheroes\n\n2. Spooks in the Attic\n\n3. Blessing in Disguise\n\n4. Judas at the Opera\n\n5. The Spirit (Magnum cover)\n\n6. Superheroes (Epic version)\n\nAdvantages: Teaser of the next album avoided the disappointment being too great when it arrived.\n\nDisadvantages: Weak reinvention as hair metal band.\n\nEdguy\n\nRocket Ride\n\n**\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\nI'm not a fan of Edguy's career move from power metal to hard rock, but I'll credit this album with containing a few decent songs in the new style, even if it still hurts to hear Tobias Sammet fall so disastrously from his previous height at the top of his game. The direction here owes much to half-hearted toilet humour and eighties hair metal, and the band no longer concerns itself with writing finely tuned songs.\n\n'Sacrifice' is a long-winded but reasonable opener with a memorable enough chorus, but very little else. The same could be said for 'Rocket Ride' and 'Superheroes,' which are led by guitar riffs that are simple but lacking the charm of the band's usual standard. 'Return to the Tribe' and 'Out of Vogue' are the only fast songs, but still not really power metal, and the token poor ballad comes in the form of 'Save Me.' The album lacks distinctive or classic material, and its influences are all too obvious, culminating in 'F**king With Fire' which owes its guitars to AC/DC and its chorus to Bon Jovi. I'm not terribly excited about Edguy's future releases.\n\n1. Sacrifice\n\n2. Rocket Ride\n\n3. Wasted Time\n\n4. Matrix\n\n5. Return to the Tribe\n\n6. The Asylum\n\n7. Save Me\n\n8.

F**king With Fire (Hair Force One)\n\nEinherjer\n\nNative Norwegian Art\n\n****\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\nEinherjer were one of the more creative bands in the Viking metal genre, retaining a distinct, well-produced sound incorporating orchestra and piano and a very unusual style of guitar playing indebted to the folk tradition. The vocals are performed in gruff singing rather than the more typical growls, and indeed the black metal elements that underpin much Viking metal are all but absent even in the rare faster songs such as 'Burning Yggdrasil.'\n\nThe keyboard is a little distracting to the sense of ancient atmosphere conjured here, but the use of orchestra is superbly done, reminiscent of Therion in its more full-blown moments. This is predominantly slow-to-medium-paced epic metal based around the guitar, and the longer song lengths allow each piece to stand strong. The music is still heavy and loud without being overbearing for those less fond of extreme metal, with a convincingly thunderous sound suited to the apocalyptic Viking themes.\n\n1. Wyrd of the Dead\n\n2. Doomfaring\n\n3. Hugin's Eyes\n\n4. Burning Yggdrasil\n\n5. Crimson Rain\n\n6. Howl Ravens Come\n\n7. Draconian Umpire\n\n8. Regicide\n\nEinherjer\n\nBlot\n\n****\n\nWritten on 02.07.08\n\nEinherjer's final album prior to their amicable disbanding sees something of a return to their roots as a more black metal influenced band, principally extending to the resurgence of rasped vocals and drum blast beats. The album sounds a little overproduced which weakens the effect of the drums, but this was perhaps necessary to accommodate the sound of the orchestra, which is used excellently here, more rooted in the bass and brass end than higher strings.\n\nOpening instrumental 'Einherjermarsjen' paints the perfect historic Scandinavian scene, even if it sounds a little too much like video game background music, and after this the album is led by strong, repeated riffs that unfortunately tend to be a little over-repeated. The quantity of tracks also means that the songs tend to blur together a little more with less individual character and little variation, but there are still a few notable exceptions, especially the faster 'Wolf-Age' with its great guitar solo and the melodic 'Ride the Gallows' that makes effective use of a choir.\n\n1.

Venomtongue\n\nElectric Wizard\n\nElectric Wizard\n\n****\n\nWritten on 03.07.08\n\nThe first release from Dorset's drug-fuelled doom metal band Electric Wizard is less distinctive than their later works, more directly derivative of the classic doom tradition pioneered by bands like Black Sabbath in the seventies, but still applying a more modern sound with production trickery. These songs are long, sloooow and heavy, crawling along with frank disregard for musical convention, though lacking the effective wall-of-sound approach of subsequent releases.\n\nNone of these songs really stand out apart from the atmospheric instrumental 'Mountains of Mars,' but this is still a high quality album of stoner doom, with some blues-influenced guitar solos and a nice vocal performance from Jus Osborn, even if he hasn't quite found his voice yet. The emphasis on reverb and feedback effects is deliberately alienating to the faint-hearted and aids the atmosphere immensely, while doom fans should enjoy the more overtly Sabbathesque songs such as the band's fantasy-themed title song.\n\n1. Stone Magnet\n\n2. Mourning Prayer\n\n3. Mountains of Mars\n\n4. Behemoth\n\n5. Devil's Bride\n\n6. Black Butterfly\n\n7. Electric Wizard\n\n8. Wooden Pipe\n\nElectric Wizard\n\nSupercoven\n\n***\n\nWritten on 03.07.08\n\nAnyone who was put off by the stoned sound of 'Come My Fanatics...' should steer well clear of this strange little E.P., which comprises two long songs of growling feedback and crunchy, warbled guitar riffs for thirteen and eighteen minutes respectively. This seems like a release aimed directly at existing fans, but unfortunately goes a little too far as Electric Wizard try too hard to sound like Electric Wizard.\n\nThere's only a very basic and gradual evolution in these songs, certainly not what may be expected of such lengthy compositions (even if the music is played at a significantly slower tempo than the average band). They're both distinctive enough, 'Burnout' being a little more bluesy than the blaring 'Supercoven' with its loud chorus, but I can't help feeling that four songs of half the length would have been more satisfying. 'Supercoven' features some surprising guitar solos towards the end that mark the album's only real change in speed, but this is all perhaps best viewed as an experimental release.\n\n1. Supercoven\n\n2. Burnout\n\nAdvantages: Extreme stoner doom for the seriously stoned.\n\nDisadvantages: Alienating.\n\nElectric Wizard\n\nDopethrone\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 03.07.08\n\n'Dopethrone' is simultaneously Electric Wizard's finest offering and one of the defining albums of modern doom metal. Making no small display of the band's orientation towards drug worship, this isn't permitted to take over the music or lyrics to a ridiculous extent (not like the work of Bongzilla for example), but it would still prove immensely satisfying to like-minded listeners (I imagine).\n\nJus Osborn's vocals are now more distorted, adding to the slightly inhuman and synthetic atmosphere, and the guitar riffs are actually fun and memorable for once, a little reminiscent of Cathedral (though their extremely stoned take on the story of Hopkins, Witchfinder General is less instantly gratifying than Cathedral's version). Songs merge together to grant a sense of continuity, but still stand apart and individual, and although this is a pretty extreme example of stoner doom, I'd still recommend it to curious newcomers. It's only in the final song that the growling tone of the down-tuned, infinitely distorted instruments actually starts to turn the stomach.\n\n1. Vinum Sabbathi\n\n2. Funeralopolis\n\n3. Weird Tales:\n\n... i) Electric Frost\n\n... ii) Golgotha\n\n... iii) Alter Of Melektaus\n\n4. Barbarian\n\n5. I, The Witchfinder\n\n6. The Hills Have Eyes\n\n7. We Hate You\n\n8. Dopethrone\n\nElectric Wizard\n\nLet Us Prey\n\n****\n\nWritten on 03.07.08\n\nThere wasn't really anywhere left to go after 'Dopethrone,' thus Electric Wizard decided to turn backwards a little, back into the realm of easily digested guitar riffs and less overwhelming distortion. This album is fairly easy to listen to, at least by comparison, though song lengths in excess of nine minutes with very little in the way of internal deviation require a patient listener.\n\nThe sound is still authentic doom, heavy on the bass guitar with blues-influenced guitar, and if anything the performance is even angrier here than before, particularly in the form of Jus Osborn's vocals in 'We, the Undead' and the heavier, grittier 'The Outsider.' Most of the songs will inevitably flow together before the listener develops familiarity with the album, and only 'Night of the Shape' offers something very different with its haunting keyboards over a relatively upbeat drum beat, an effective change from the norm just when the norm was starting to get a little old.\n\n1.

Many of these songs wouldn't sound out of place on the first Black Sabbath album, but carry an extra burden of severe heaviness that penetrates right into the listener's internal organs and reduces their lifespan significantly with each listen. But it might just be worth it.\n\nWhile the band's earlier classic 'Dopethrone' didn't seem to have been written and composed so much as condensed out of bong smoke on the CD's surface, this album feels more relaxed and concentrated, with songs of varying lengths and an effort being made to play catchy, memorable guitar riffs and choruses. Jus Osborn's voice now resembles a sixties psychedelic singer, which works excellently against the bass-heavy, heavily-distorted guitar riffs, and the clichéd tribal touches in songs like 'Black Magic Rituals & Perversions' lend a great Hammer Horror atmosphere.\n\n1.

Elend's fourth album 'The Umbersun' is more accurately a neoclassical album, rooted in the classical tradition with the dynamic aesthetic of a modern film soundtrack, supplemented by angry spoken word narrating a tale of Lucifer in incomprehensible French (except, perhaps, to the French).\n\nThis is no symphonic metal band combining rock instruments with a supplementary orchestral backdrop, and not even a perfect fusion as happens on rare occasions with bands such as Haggard and Therion. Rather, this is a full-on orchestral assault that combines tranquil beauty and blaring aggression often within the same movement, utilising a large band and choir to their full extent. These songs are long and intricate, but often become a little dull as the action fades, requiring more patience than the average rock fan is experienced at demonstrating.\n\n1.

Au tréfonds des ténèbres\n\nElend\n\nA World in Their Screams\n\n****\n\nWritten on 03.07.08\n\nElend's most recent release is another enjoyable and dynamic neoclassical album, one that avoids tedious repetition by striking an intriguing balance between melodic, classical beauty and blaring, electronic ugliness. This balance is shifted significantly towards the former, with only 'Ondes de sang' and the synthetically screaming 'Borée' crossing over into electronic territory.\n\nThis album apparently forms the third part of a trilogy, but as the lyrics are all in French, it's a tale entirely lost on me. The band utilises an impressive male and female choir and a large complement of classical musicians, while the rock end of things is only held up by a drum beat pervading most of the songs. The album makes interesting use of silences without resorting to minimalism, and is rarely ambient, occasionally going (deliberately) too far in the layering of instruments.\n\nAn experienced classical music scholar would doubtless have more technical bones to pick, but for me it's a fine modern classical album, even if it's a bit of a shame to have no idea what it's about.\n\n1.

Urserpens\n\nElis\n\nGriefshire\n\n****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nWritten and sung by Sabine Dünser and released shortly after her untimely death, 'Griefshire' ran the risk of being overrated to the extreme in a Kurt Cobain manner, but fortunately it lives up to expectations of being an above-average gothic metal album.\n\nDünser's vocal performance is pleasant, especially when singing in her native German in tracks two and five, but her support from growled male vocals in 'Beauty-and-the-Beast' style still feels like an overused gimmick of the genre, a contrived means to balance the songs between light and darkness without having to put in the effort musically. The instruments are all fairly standard, the guitar mainly being there to define a rhythm, but there are still some nice solos scattered throughout.\n\nThere's an enjoyable degree of diversity in this album, even if it takes fairly obvious forms. 'Remember the Promise' is a bit faster and more energetic than the rest, while 'How Long' and 'Forgotten Love' are both standard ballads, but excusable and indeed relevant thanks to the conceptual story linking the album together.\n\n1.

A New Decade\n\nEluveitie\n\nVen\n\n**\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nEluveitie's first official release shows a lot of promise, but is still only an ever-so-slightly trumped-up reworking of their demo recording. A metal band with a heavy emphasis on folk, this is at least a little different from the norm, and unlike most folk metal releases that supplement the fairly straightforward metal performance with flute flourishes, the rock instruments take a distinct backseat here, partly thanks to the poor production job that relegates them to little more than a fuzz at times.\n\nFlutes and pipes are the primary instruments in roughly half of the E.P., with only 'Ôrô' and 'Druid' being full-blown metal songs with growled vocals and folk instruments still in the foreground. As the production quality weakens the effect of these more extreme sections, not to mention the fact that they're pretty generic anyway, it tends to be the shorter instrumental tracks that hold the most interest, where the elements strike more of a balance.\n\n1.

This Italian band clearly has its precedent in the classic metal tradition which allows for some great guitar work and an evolving sense of song structure comparable to Iron Maiden, but it's the folk elements that stand out the most, and they're not merely restricted to the occasional guest appearance by a flute or violin.\n\nEvery one of these songs has a folk core, whether it's in the melody of the chorus or the guitar playing, and even the heavier, thrashier offerings such as 'White Willow' can't escape it entirely. This presents a problem if the listener isn't so into the folk elements, but the solution there is to merely avoid this completely and check out something safer by Blind Guardian. The songs do become a little too similar as the album continues, with only the acoustic ballad 'Skywards' and the short, fun 'Hobs an' Feathers' breakings things up.\n\n1. To Oak Woods Bestowed\n\n2.

Seasonspeech\n\nEmerson, Lake and Palmer\n\nPictures at an Exhibition\n\nProg Nerve\n\n***\n\nWritten on 28.09.05\n\nCombining classical and electronic instruments was still something of an innovation in 1971. Pink Floyd’s 20-minute symphonic extravaganza ‘Atom Heart Mother’ had built on the Moody Blues’ efforts in the late sixties, then Emerson, Lake and Palmer, at the time a fresh and original presence in the musical world, took this idea a little further.\n\nTheir live performance of ‘Pictures at an Exhibition’ takes Mussorgsky’s famous composition – specifically the popular orchestral arrangement by Ravel (Mussorgsky’s original was written for piano) – and adds the keyboard talents of Keith Emerson, the vocals and guitars of Greg Lake and percussion by Carl Palmer.\n\nReleased in 1972 at a budget price, this was an affordable way for a curious public to introduce themselves to ELP and react with a disgusted frown or a thoughtful ‘hmm, I like what you did there. I think.’\n\nPICTURES AT AN EXHIBITION\n\n1. Promenade (Mussorgsky)\n\n2. The Gnome (Mussorgsky / Palmer)\n\n3. Promenade (Mussorgsky / Lake)\n\n4. The Sage (Lake)\n\n5. The Old Castle (Mussorgsky / Emerson)\n\n6. Blues Variations (Emerson / Lake / Palmer)\n\n7. Promenade (Mussorgsky)\n\n8. The Hut of Baba Yaga (Mussorgsky)\n\n9. The Curse of Baga Yaga (Emerson / Lake / Palmer)\n\n10. The Hut of Baba Yaga (Mussorgsky)\n\n11. The Great Gates of Kiev (Mussorgsky / Lake)\n\n12. Nutrocker (Kim Fowley, arranged by Emerson / Lake / Palmer)\n\n‘Pictures…’ is Mussorgsky’s most famous and recognised composition, with the possible exception of the hellish ‘Night on a Bare Mountain.’ The opening horns of ‘Promenade’ will unfortunately be remembered by some as the opening theme to Rik Mayall’s unimpressive sitcom ‘The New Statesman,’ while ‘The Hut of Baba Yaga’ and ‘The Great Gates of Kiev’ were spectacularly synthesised in the bestselling early 90s computer game ‘Frontier.’ Mussorgsky’s music attempts to express his feelings about a number of paintings in a gallery, the tone and content of which can hopefully be understood through these pieces. The recurring ‘Promenade’ is the theme of the visitor, moving between the pictures at the exhibition.\n\nObviously fans of Mussorgsky’s seminal work, ELP present the Promenade in its untampered orchestrated version, while the orchestrated ‘Hut of Baba Yaga’ is played faithfully, but overlaid with increasingly hasty electronic playing from the trio. Vocals are an interesting if distracting addition, most notable in the uplifting ‘Great Gates of Kiev’ that concludes ELP’s ‘Pictures’ set.\n\nNot all of Mussorgsky’s ‘Pictures’ are represented here, attention being directed towards the aforementioned Baba Yaga and Great Gates as well as ‘The Gnome,’ ‘The Sage’ and ‘The Old Castle’ in the first half. Gnome and Castle are taken over by Emerson’s impressive keyboards, while The Sage becomes an unexpected acoustic piece from Lake.\n\nThe set closes, after a huge appreciative uproar from the crowd, with the band’s rendition of Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker (renamed ‘Nutrocker’), itself apparently based on a piano reworking by B Bumble and the Stingers ten years earlier. Although it lacks the atmosphere maintained through the rest of the set, this is a fun (if irritating at times) display of Keith Emerson at his best.\n\nVERDICT\n\nReleased after the well-received ‘Tarkus,’ ELP’s Pictures at an Exhibition is a lot of fun, especially for fans of classical music and progressive rock. Some will see it as superior to Mussorgsky, others will track me down and slaughter me for even suggesting that such blasphemers could exist. Now commonly available only as a full-priced CD, rather than the cheap novelty it once was, Pictures could be seen as more arrogant and pretentious than its original intention – a memorable addition to ELP’s first tour.\n\nThe sound quality is far from excellent, owing to the fact that this is a live album from the early seventies. Although the instrumentation is near perfect, Greg Lake’s voice isn’t up to the standards of studio recordings. The band later recorded a portion of this set in Dolby surround sound on their otherwise disappointing ‘In the Hot Seat’ album, but taking this as a live addition to a prog rock collection, it’s not all bad. Who knows: Modest Mussorgsky might even be proud.\n\nNah. But I like it.\n\nAdvantages: Entertainment for fans of either school of music\n\nDisadvantages: Imperfect sound quality, short length, extortionate modern prices\n\nEmperor\n\nIn the Nightside Eclipse\n\n****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nEmperor were one of the defining bands of Norwegian black metal, and 'In the Nightside Eclipse' was their first full-length recording after several equally iconic shorter releases. Blasted with atmospheric keyboards and tremolo-plucking guitar riffs creating a desolate wintry soundscape, this is seen as a classic of the genre by many, and probably as a load of treble-heavy screaming noise by others. But what do they know. Actually, that's partly accurate.\n\nThis is a harsh album first and foremost, and the melodic elements that are certainly present are only ever secondary. Samoth's guitars rarely deviate from the wall of sound approach, and it's only Ihsahn's keyboards that pioneer the symphonic element. There's very little variation here to the untrained ear, but increased familiarity with the album will reveal its nuances, such as the steady, almost doom metal riffs of 'Beyond the Great Vast Forest' and the increased melodic quotient of the excellent 'The Majesty of the Nightsky.'\n\n1.

The Majesty of the Nightsky\n\n8. I Am the Black Wizards\n\n9. Inno a Satana\n\nEmperor\n\nAnthems to the Welkin at Dusk\n\n****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nOpinion seems to be divided among fans whether Emperor's first or second album captures the band at its best (with most unanimously agreeing that they spiralled downwards after this point). There's a distinct difference between the comparatively eloquent, melodic clarity of 'Anthems to the Welkin at Dusk' and the frosty growl of its predecessor 'In the Nightside Eclipse,' and for its greater variety and more approachable sound, I've always favoured this second effort.\n\nRight from the start, this album refuses to be pinned down as typical second-wave Norwegian black metal. 'Alsvartr' is led by slow and atmospheric melodies from the guitar and keyboards with rasped vocals delivered in a spoken word style, before 'Ye Entrancemperium' explodes into the familiar black metal sound, albeit with much higher and clearer production values than was typical for their contemporaries. The keyboards still reign dominant in this album as they did on its predecessor, the difference being that every instrument now stands apart from the rest with greater clarity.\n\nAlong with Dissection's 'The Somberlain,' I'd recommend Emperor's 'Anthems' as a great introductory album to black metal for bold newcomers, less off-putting than some of the more hardcore releases but more authentic than the popular bands such as Dimmu Borgir.\n\n1. Alsvartr (The Oath)\n\n2. Ye Entrancemperium\n\n3. Thus Spake the Nightspirit\n\n4. Ensorcelled By Khaos\n\n5. The Loss and Curse of Reverence\n\n6. The Acclamation of Bonds\n\n7. With Strength I Burn\n\n8. The Wanderer\n\nAdvantages: Varied and accessible black metal.\n\nDisadvantages: Lacks authentic atmosphere of its predecessor.\n\nEmperor\n\nIX Equilibrium\n\n***\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nEmperor's third album was the point at which Ihsahn started to take over, Roger Water style, playing most of the instruments and spearheading pretty much the entire direction of the music, which frequently seems to be going nowhere. An album full of incoherent ideas, this isn't so much progressive as stubbornly chaotic for the sake of it, but it still works in a way.\n\nThis is a fairly intense album, with ferocious, tangential guitar riffs and other black metal staples such as harsh vocals and drum blast beats, but Emperor introduce enough intriguing melodic elements to keep things varied, from the clean electric guitar of 'Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers' to the sombre violin opening of 'Decrystallizing Reason.' At times, this album comes perilously close to being an overly random noise, possessing volume without feeling or direction as tends to happen with bands like Dimmu Borgir, but there are still enough memorable riffs and songs to allow the album to stand strongly apart.\n\n1. Curse You All Men!\n\n2. Decrystallizing Reason\n\n3. An Elegy of Icaros\n\n4. The Source of Icon E\n\n5. Sworn\n\n6. Nonus Aequilibrium\n\n7. The Warriors of Modern Death\n\n8. Of Blindness and Subsequent Seers\n\nAdvantages: Original sound.\n\nDisadvantages: Experiment isn't entirely successful.\n\nEmpyrium\n\nA Wintersunset...\n\n****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nEmpyrium's first album is a classic of folk metal, of the rare variety that doesn't end up sounding irritatingly upbeat. While this doesn't quite possess the melancholy gloom of their second release, 'A Wintersunset...' sounds like an incredibly effective and atmospheric attempt to capture the essence of nature in its various forms, communicated through folk-inspired melodies and a prominent synthesised orchestra. This album has all the grandeur and beauty of a soundtrack, without any of the tedium.\n\nThe slow pace and mournful atmosphere should appeal to doom metal fans, but the harsh black metal vocals that crop up in places do sound a little out of place against the sweeping orchestration, and are probably the album's main failing merely for sticking out so much. The guitar and keyboard melodies are memorable enough for this to become a firm favourite after a single listen, and the sound quality is just about perfect: polished enough to discern the orchestration and keyboards, but not over-produced to spoil the raw effect of the guitars.\n\n1. Moonromanticism\n\n2. Under Dreamskies\n\n3. The Franconian Woods In Winter`s Silence\n\n4. The Yearning\n\n5. Autumn Grey Views\n\n6. Ordain'd to Thee\n\n7. A Gentle Grieving Farewell Kiss\n\nEmpyrium\n\nSongs of Moors & Misty Fields\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\n'Songs of Moors and Misty Fields' is the aptly-titled second album from Empyrium, one that continues to conjure pastoral images albeit this time with an added degree of sadness. The combination of heavy metal with folk almost invariably ends up sounding positively jolly, as is the case with Finntroll and folk-power bands, but Empyrium have succeeded in breaking this barrier and using the natural, archaic instruments (and synthesised equivalents) to create a genuine mournful and elegiac atmosphere in these long, slow songs.\n\nThere's enough variation between the tracks for each one to stand out, the possible exception being 'Lover's Grief' which sounds rather like an inferior version of the previous song, and the tone varies also, the first substantial song 'The Blue Mists of Night' leading with a comparatively bouncy and energetic guitar melody reminiscent of Opeth. The rasped black metal vocals now sound more coherent thanks to the louder performance all-round, but the predominant style is still clean, folk style vocals, here supplemented with effective use of male choral vocals.\n\n1. When Shadows Grow Longer\n\n2. The Blue Mists of Night\n\n3. Mourners\n\n4. Ode to Melancholy\n\n5. Lover's Grief\n\n6. The Ensemble of Silence\n\nEmpyrium\n\nWhere at Night the Wood Grouse Plays\n\n****\n\nWritten on 04.07.08\n\nWith their third album, Empyrium took the bold leap into acoustic folk territory, entirely abandoning their metal elements and risking alienating their previously loyal fans. Fortunately, this band excels at the folk style, as can be heard on the previous albums which essentially apply rock instruments to a folk foundation, and this stands strong as an equally valid album rather than a one-off attempt, such as Ulver's 'Kveldssanger' or Borknagar's 'Origin.' Unlike most metal bands incorporating folk elements for diversity, there was always an equal balance in Empyrium's work, and eradicating one of the elements could have led either way.\n\nThe album still uses keyboards, but abandons the rock instruments and rasped vocals in favour of a traditional approach, though the guitar melodies are still recognisable as the same band. Without the overbearing, doomy atmosphere, this lacks the sorrow of the previous album, but is still incredibly atmospheric, and the shorter compositions should also make it more appealing to those whose attention spans previously deterred them from the band's work.\n\n1. Where at Night the Wood Grouse Plays\n\n2. Dying Brokenhearted\n\n3. The Shepherd and the Maiden Ghost\n\n4. The Sad Song of the Wind\n\n5. Wehmut\n\n6. A Pastoral Theme\n\n7. Abendrot\n\n8. Many Moons Ago...\n\n9. When Shadows Grow Longer\n\nEnsiferum\n\nIron\n\n****\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\nEnsiferum's second album is faster and heavier than their first, but this also invites unavoidable comparison to the bands whose sound it mimics, most expressly their fellow Finns Children of Bodom, Norther and Kalmah in its use of harsh metal elements over a classic speed metal tempo. Most songs are fast, energetic and a little upbeat, though without the over-enthusiasm of Finntroll, and the guitar work is excellent, leading to numerous memorable guitar melodies and highly enjoyable solos, but I can't help feeling that the acoustic folk elements sound out of place and even a little on the amateur side.\n\nThe production quality is crystal clear, which does serve to rob this of some of its atmosphere but at least allows every nuance to be properly heard, and there's a greater degree of variation than on the first album, with songs 'Tale of Revenge,' 'Lost in Despair' and 'LAI LAI HEI' becoming progressively slower until finale 'Tears' abandons metal altogether.\n\n1. Ferrum Aeternum\n\n2. Iron\n\n3. Sword Chant\n\n4. Mourning Heart\n\n5. Tale of Revenge\n\n6. Lost in Despair\n\n7. Slayer of Light\n\n8. Into Battle\n\n9. LAI LAI HEI\n\n10. Tears\n\nEnslaved\n\nBlodhemn\n\n****\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\nThe final album of Enslaved's early career, to speak broadly, is a slight disappointment after the magnificent 'Eld,' simply because it doesn't advance the Viking black metal sound in any way. With higher production values, this remains as intense and heavy as the older albums with added volume, but the discordant riffs end up sounding a little too similar to Emperor for the band to retain much individuality here.\n\nThe songs are less varied, most falling back onto simplistic black metal foundations and others attempting diversity through contrived and ultimately unsuccessful means, most notably the rasped spoken word approach and screaming guitar solos of 'Ansuz Astral' that don't really fit in. 'Urtical Gods' has the energetic pace of punk which keeps this album lively, but it's only really the more substantial finale 'Suttungs Mjod / Perkulator' that's in any way comparable to this album's predecessor, with its more thoughtful and eloquent take on things.\n\n1. Audhumla: Birth of the Worlds\n\n2. I Lenker Til Ragnarok\n\n3. Urtical Gods\n\n4. Ansuz Astral\n\n5. Nidingaslakt\n\n6. Eit Auga Til Mimir\n\n7. Blodhemn\n\n8. Brisinghamen\n\n9. Suttungs Mjod / Perkulator\n\nEnslaved\n\nMonumension\n\n****\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\n'Monumension' improves upon its predecessor 'Mardraum' and helps define Enslaved's progressive black metal sound, while still retaining some of the folk elements that would be absent later on.The biggest difference here is the complete or partial absence of extreme metal elements in numerous tracks, as 'Hollow Inside,' 'The Sleep' and 'Sigmundskvadet' owe more to the classic prog rock tradition, and end up sounding more like something Pain of Salvation might do than the band that released 'Frost' a decade earlier.\n\nMany songs feature psychedelic elements reminiscent of Pink Floyd, certainly not as full-blown as those found in Subterranean Masquerade's work, but still potentially something to alienate the black metal purists (but what do they know). This is a great album that boldly experiments with combinations that shouldn't really work, and occasionally don't, but in attempting to spearhead several genres at once, the band reveals its comparative weaknesses in some areas.\n\n1. Convoys to Nothingness\n\n2. The Voices\n\n3. Vision: Sphere of the Elements - A Monument Part II\n\n4. Hollow Inside\n\n5. The Cromlech Gate\n\n6. Enemy I\n\n7. Smirr\n\n8. The Sleep: Floating Diversity - A Monument Part III\n\n9. Outro: Self-Zero\n\n10. Sigmundskvadet\n\nEnslaved\n\nIsa\n\n***\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\n'Isa' is the only album Enslaved have released in their turbulent and creative career that I would consider something of a disappointment, if only in comparison to their usual high standard. Reinventing their approach to black metal with every album or two, it was perhaps inevitable that one would fall through, and while 'Isa' isn't bad by any means, it's distinctly average in its ideas and execution.\n\nThe songs don't all sound the same, but each one is led by a dominant guitar riff or melody that is repeated a little too often, while gimmicks such as a repetitive keyboard thrum effect show up far too often, perhaps in a contrived attempt to create a sense of coherence across the tracks. 'Lunar Force' is driven by a tremolo-plucking riff that's fun for a couple of minutes before it starts to lose its charm, and 'Ascension' only stands out for being a little slower than the rest. 'Return to Yggdrasil' features melodic sections seemingly for the sake of it, and the final (significant) song 'Neogenesis' feels overlong and lacking in good ideas, despite some enjoyable guitars.\n\n1. Intro: Green Reflection\n\n2. Lunar Force\n\n3. Isa\n\n4. Ascension\n\n5. Bounded By Allegiance\n\n6. Violet Dawning\n\n7. Return to Yggdrasil\n\n8. Secrets of the Flesh\n\n9. Neogenesis\n\n10. Outro: Communion\n\nEnslaved\n\nRuun\n\n****\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\nCelebrated at the time as a landmark release in progressive extreme metal, Enslaved's 'Ruun' isn't really all that special or innovative, but is still an improvement over the comparatively dull 'Isa.' Most songs are fairly slow paced and full of melodic moments owing more to prog rock than black metal, while almost pop elements prevail in some of the accessible riffs to songs like 'Entroper.'\n\nThere aren't any weak moments here, but at the same time, few songs really scream out for attention. The opener is intriguing with its heavy bass presence and alternation between growls and clean singing, 'Path to Vanir' is slower and evolves into a gloomy acoustic song by the end, and the title song is a great example of mellow black metal, which some may have previously seen as an oxymoron. The only real disappointment with this album is that for all its purported attempts to be different, the songs do end up sounding largely the same.\n\n1. Entroper\n\n2. Path to Vanir\n\n3. Fusion of Sense and Earth\n\n4. Ruun\n\n5. Tides of Chaos\n\n6. Essence\n\n7. Api-vat\n\n8. Heir to the Cosmic Seed\n\nEnthroned\n\nTetra Karcist\n\n***\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\nEnthroned's latest album is a little too self-consciously 'dark,' over-using gimmicks such as monk chants that start out sounding convincingly haunting, but later lose their power. This Belgian band takes a fairly standard and unsurprising approach to black metal, and is either blessed or cursed with high production values depending on the listener's preference for clear, hammering guitars and drums or the fuzzy warble of the lo-fi black metal old-school. This album loses some of its atmosphere through the clinical accuracy of the instruments.\n\nNornagest is the new vocalist here, but he really doesn't make any kind of grand entrance, sounding the same as every other screaming black metal singer. The album is saved by the guitar work, which erupts into solos and lead melodies with enjoyable regularity, though the riffs themselves tend towards extreme repetition, more concerned with maintaining rhythm than anything else. The most interesting songs here are the few that deviate from full-pelt black metal, such as the slightly slower 'The Seven Ensigns of Creation' with its tremolo-picking leading riff that I would have liked to hear more of elsewhere, and the interlude 'Deviant Nerve Angelus' that starts out as a standard, uninspired keyboard break, but evolves into an impressive mini-instrumental.\n\n1. Ingressus Regnum Spiritus\n\n2. Pray\n\n3. Tellum Scorpionis\n\n4. Deviant Nerve Angelus\n\n5. The Burning Dawn\n\n6. Through the Cortex\n\n7. The Seven Ensigns of Creation\n\n8. Nox\n\n9. Vermin\n\n10. Antares\n\nEntwine\n\nFatal Design\n\n***\n\nWritten on 05.07.08\n\n'Fatal Design' is an incredibly obvious album of gothic metal for those who enjoy their music being predictable. Yet another Finnish band mixing light metal elements with eighties gothic rock and glam, Entwine don't stand up to the leaders of the genre primarily because their sound is so generic and lacking in character.\n\nMika Tauriainen's vocals are a little more gravelly than those of other gothic metal singers, but this doesn't lend an extra punch to the music, which is still based around medium-speed guitars. Each song is cut to a radio-friendly length and based around overly repetitive choruses, which obviously isn't a bad thing in itself, but does become a little tedious and grating over time, as most songs are lacking creativity.\n\nThe only song that really stands out as different is 'My Serenity,' led by odd funk melodies reminiscent of nu-metal, while more obvious contrived differences come in the obvious power ballads that clinically bisect the album at its half-way point and finale.\n\n1. Fatal Design\n\n2. Chameleon Halo\n\n3. Out of You\n\n4. Surrender\n\n5. Oblivion\n\n6. Twisted\n\n7. Insomniac\n\n8. My Serenity\n\n9. Break Me\n\n10. Curtained Life\n\nEphel Duath\n\nThe Painter's Palette\n\n***\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\nThis Italian band is certainly innovative in its approach to metal, but the ambition isn't entirely supported by the quality of the finished product. Most grating for me are the distinct traces of metalcore evident in the alternation between screamed and sung vocals, handled by two different singers which just smacks of a lack of ability, and the unnecessary anger spoils songs such as 'The Picture' that would otherwise be fairly enjoyable in a more mellow manner.\n\nThe most interesting element for me is the use of saxophone, which avant-garde metal bands have been experimenting with to various degrees of success since John Zorn started collaborating with hardcore musicians in the early nineties, and although it works well in the hectic 'The Passage' and the slower songs later on, it isn't as convincingly done as in something like Subterranean Masquerade. Even the hardcore elements seem like an inferior version of Kayo Dot's work, and Maudlin of the Well before them, making this a distinctly average release from Ephel Duath that I admire for its creativity, but can't appreciate on its musical merit.\n\n1. The Passage (Pearl Grey)\n\n2. The Unpoetic Circle (Bottle Green)\n\n3. Labyrinthine (Crimson)\n\n4. Praha (Ancient Gold)\n\n5. The Picture (Bordeaux)\n\n6. Ruins (Deep Blue and Violet)\n\n7.

The Other's Touch (Amaranth)\n\nEpica\n\nConsign to Oblivion\n\n****\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\nEpica's second album is a more satisfying effort than their first, taking a more severe approach to orchestral metal that comes close to the sound of Therion, though without that other band's mastery. With Simone Simons' pleasant singing voice making songs such as 'Dance of Fate' and 'Another Me - In Lack'ech' more accessible as potential singles, and her soprano style working similarly effectively in 'Force of the Shore' when pitted against male growls, this album gets everything right, but still fails a little due to the necessary restrictions of the rock instruments drowned out by the symphony.\n\nThe interlude tracks and longer finale 'Consign to Oblivion' demonstrate a real affinity with Hollywood film soundtracks in their dynamic orchestration, comparable to Basil Poledouris, but even for all its ambition and flair, this still isn't the most effective incorporation of orchestra into heavy metal that I've heard, the aforementioned Therion being miles ahead, and even bands such as Virgin Steele being competitive.\n\n1.

Consign to Oblivion (A New Age Dawns - Part III)\n\nEquilibrium\n\nTuris Fratyr\n\n****\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\nEquilibrium's debut is a great album of folk metal in the roughly-defined Viking style, albeit this time focusing on the band's native German ancestry and mythology. The music is frequently fast and heavy in a speed metal style, complimented by keyboards that add the all-important folk element but occasionally go a little too far and become grating, as is the case in 'Widars Hallen.'\n\nFor the most part, this is fairly predictable but fun folk metal in the style of Ensiferum, as fast songs like 'Wingthors Hammer' are balanced by slower offerings such as 'Unter der Eiche.' The album is at its best when combining the synthesised folk elements with the metal in a truer fusion rather than acting as a parallel, and this reaches its height in 'Nordheim,' before finale 'Wald der Freiheit' abandons the metal side of things altogether and proves that the band would still have what it takes as a neofolk outfit.\n\n1. Turis Fratyr\n\n2. Wingthors Hammer\n\n3. Unter der Eiche\n\n4. Der Sturm\n\n5. Widars Hallen\n\n6. Met\n\n7. Heimdalls Ruf\n\n8. Die Prophezeiung\n\n9. Nordheim\n\n10. Im Fackelschein\n\n11. Tote Heldensagen\n\n12. Wald der Freiheit\n\nEsoteric\n\nMetamorphogenesis\n\n****\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\nBirmingham's Esoteric are one of the more impressive funeral doom metal bands, a genre pioneered by the likes of Thergothon who took the already crawling pace of traditional doom metal and stretched it out to new extremes of glacial tedium. Unlike boring drone bands such as Sunn O))) who merely sustain notes for far longer than the average human attention span permits, Esoteric use the slower pace to their advantage in creating an engulfing, wholly depressive and somewhat alien atmosphere.\n\nThese three songs are slow and demanding of the listener, but possess enough internal variation to keep them interesting. They become increasingly shorter as the album continues, from seventeen to fifteen and finally eleven minutes, and are some of the most haunting and hypnotic compositions I've ever heard. That said, this is only an album for a specific mood, and one that could very easily bore the listener to tears if played inappropriately. The distorted effect of the vocals and fuzzing guitar riffs are incredibly sinister, and balanced out by elegiac guitar melodies and effective use of sparse keyboards in the ambient sections.\n\n1. Dissident\n\n2. The Secret of the Secret\n\n3. Psychotropic Transgression\n\nAdvantages: Haunting funeral doom metal that won't bore the patient listener.\n\nDisadvantages: Third song is too similar to the second.\n\nEstatic Fear\n\nA Sombre Dance\n\n*****\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\nOne of the most distinctive and compelling doom metal albums I've heard, Estatic Fear's second and final album is essentially the project of Austrian Matthias Kogler, the only remaining original band member who drafted in guest musicians and a female singer to record his magnum opus. A heavily symphonic album, this is one of the most effective combinations of rock instruments with orchestration that I've ever heard, one that never goes over the top to spoil its sombre, pastoral, historical atmosphere, and perhaps the closest you can get to true Medieval metal (however much of an oxymoron that may be).\n\nEach song flows perfectly into the next, and all possess enough internal variation for the album to work as an epic and beautiful musical story. The metal itself never feels overbearing, despite approaching an impressive degree of heaviness in Chapter II and others, and the dual guitar melodies that lead the way in most songs are instantly gratifying and memorable. Even gimmicks such as the thunder and rain that pervade Chapter II contribute excellently to the atmosphere, whereas on other albums I would consider them cheesy and unnecessary.\n\n1. Intro (Unisono Lute Instrumental)\n\n2. Chapter I\n\n3. Chapter II\n\n4. Chapter III\n\n5. Chapter IV\n\n6. Chapter V\n\n7. Chapter VI\n\n8. Chapter VII\n\n9. Chapter VIII\n\n10. Chapter IX\n\nAdvantages: Perfectly composed and executed symphonic doom metal.\n\nDisadvantages: Twinkly keyboards are slightly irritating in Chapter VIII.\n\nEternal Tears of Sorrow\n\nA Virgin and a Whore\n\n****\n\nWritten on 06.07.08\n\n'A Virgin and a Whore' is the fourth album of Finland's Eternal Tears of Sorrow, and a fine work of melodic death metal that stands out in an increasingly generic and stagnant genre. With its generally slower tempo and emphasis on keyboards bearing a sound reminiscent of early video game music, this isn't necessarily going to appeal to fans of Dark Tranquillity, In Flames or the other Gothenburg bands, but it's still a varied and enjoyable album, if somewhat lacking on the technical front.\n\n'Aurora Borealis' is almost a doom metal song with its slow, rhythmic riffs and drawn-out melodic guitars, and while it doesn't have the same instant gratification as the more energetic 'Heart of Wilderness' and 'Blood of Hatred,' it's a fantastic opener that established a great atmosphere. 'The River Flows Frozen' is similarly effective and even more varied, beginning with acoustic work and ending in a piano outro with plenty of guitar harmonies in-between, and even those normally averse to death metal may find elements of these songs surprisingly soothing.\n\n1. Aurora Borealis\n\n2. Heart of Wilderness\n\n3. Prophetian\n\n4. Fall of Man\n\n5. The River Flows Frozen\n\n6. The Last One for Life\n\n7. Sick, Dirty and Mean (Accept cover)\n\n8. Blood of Hatred\n\n9. Aeon\n\nEvergrey\n\nSolitude Dominance Tragedy\n\n****\n\nWritten on 07.07.08\n\nEvergrey are one of the more distinctive progressive metal bands, achieving a recognisable sound of their own rather than merely following in the footsteps of the big genre names such as Dream Theater, Tool or Fates Warning, though comparison to the latter is occasionally relevant. Their early albums were fairly dark and sombre offerings of prog metal infused with power metal elements, and 'Solitude Dominance Tragedy' is a highly enjoyable album that will appeal to those who enjoy the less showy prog metal of bands like Pain of Salvation.\n\nTom Englund's vocals are the stand-out element of the band, and may also be the make-or-break aspect, due to the level of melodrama. The other instruments don't stand out quite as much, but the prevalence of keyboard adds a haunting atmosphere, while chugging guitars in songs like 'She Speaks to the Dead' and the more energetic 'Nosferatu' maintain the inertia. The band has a flair for ballads that is perhaps at its best on this album, 'The Shocking Truth' being reminiscent of Kevin Moore's 'Space Dye Vest' composed for Dream Theater in its voice samples, though the later ballad 'Words Mean Nothing' is more typical and a little dull as a result, saved only by sweeping keyboards.\n\n1.

The Corey Curse\n\nEvergrey\n\nIn Search of Truth\n\n****\n\nWritten on 07.07.08\n\nI've always been frustrated that this album comes so close to being a prog metal classic, but is held back by the prevalence of frankly rubbish ballads. Evergrey have an excellent grasp of atmosphere, and songs frequently indulge in slower, more melodic sections to balance out the heavy riffs elsewhere, but the ballad songs 'State of Paralysis,' 'Mark of the Triangle' and 'Different Worlds' push this to extremes of boredom.\n\nWith that major gripe out of the way, this is an otherwise excellent work of progressive power metal, drowned in keyboards that add an epic flair and intersected with spoken word sections narrating the story of the central character's paranoia over his suspected alien abduction. Many songs are instantly memorable, from the somewhat poppy chorus of 'The Masterplan' to the effective use of piano in 'Rulers of the Mind' and the solo in 'Watching the Skies,' and with its generally steady pace the musicians make the few faster sections all the more effective.\n\n1.

Misled\n\nEvergrey\n\nMonday Morning Apocalypse\n\n***\n\nWritten on 07.07.08\n\nEvergrey's 2006 release is largely a disappointment, lacking the epic scale and lyrical intrigue of their earlier works in favour of a more accessible and tightly edited direction that ultimately fails to impress, topped off with a meagre production job that kills the impact of the guitars and makes this more of a rock album than heavy metal, especially disappointing considering how Evergrey were previously one of the heavier bands playing in this style.\n\nThe chorus of the opening title song is particularly offensive in its obvious theft of seventies pop-rock, and most songs end up sounding very generic, with only the contrived weird vocal stylings of 'Still in the Water' making that song stand out a mile, at least in its first half. One saving grace of this album is that the band finally seems to have ceased relying on ballads, with only the finale 'Closure' being a true ballad led by a dull piano, and the earlier 'In Remembrance' opting for slow metal rather than full-blown power ballad.\n\n1.

Closure\n\nExodus\n\nBonded by Blood\n\n***\n\nWritten on 07.07.08\n\n'Bonded By Blood' is widely hailed as a thrash metal classic, but viewed outside of the hype it's actually a rather standard offering. As a thrash debut it fares better than Metallica's 'Kill 'Em All' but doesn't come close to Testament's 'The Legacy,' and its punk energy and repetitive riffs make it distinctly average.\n\nPaul Ballof is the star here, his alternately shrieking and yelling vocals summing up the aesthetic and ideology of the genre, but the other performers seem to be too comfortable in their niches. Songs such as the title track are led by enjoyable guitar riffs that begin to grate after a while due to the repetition, and there's very little variation between songs, the notable exception being 'Metal Command' which sounds more like classic heavy metal indulgence.\n\nThe somewhat weak mid-eighties production values mean this isn't particularly hard-hitting no matter how loud you play it, and although it's pretty fast at times, it's certainly no Megadeth.\n\n1.

Having written a large number of reviews on heavy metal albums I have recently begun to branch out and explore different types of music. You may argue that Faith No More are an established band that are still within the rock genre, and I would answer that I'm not that brave yet; their blend of almost Chili Peppers-style funk in the vocals and rhythms, and some of the best guitars I've ever heard, led me to pick up this album for a bargain price.\n\nTHE BAND\n\nFaith No More were one of the most influential and best-selling rock bands of the late eighties to early nineties, and this was their first hugely successful album, featuring what is considered to be the classic line-up.\n\nVOCALS - MIKE PATTON\n\nPatton, formerly of Mr. Bungle, is a very talented vocalist who sings in a fairly high register that never overpowers the music. As I'm not completely used to him I find he can get annoying at times, but his range is evident on tracks such as 'Zombie Eaters'; he is often considered to improve with the band's later albums.\n\nLEAD GUITAR - JIM MARTIN\n\nWhat a guy: Jim Martin's solo in 'Epic' sounds like electrified metal harnessed by a master axeman, or something. His obvious talent shines through in instances such as this, but most of the time he is content to stick to more straightforward driving riffs to keep the tracks flowing. This is a bit of a shame, although Jim later left the band to pursue other avenues that I will have to check out.\n\nDRUMS - MIKE BORDIN\n\nSince Faith No More disbanded in the nineties, Mike can often be found filling in for prominent bands when their drummers are unavailable, such as Korn. Bordin has perfect timing, but is essentially used to drive the tracks along, rarely getting any opportunities to show off the extent of his talents in this album.\n\nBASS GUITAR - BILLY GOULD\n\nThe funky nature of this album means that there is a large amount of bass presence, certainly more than in many other rock albums, and Billy Gould is highly skilled at playing both subtle and leading bass lines.\n\nKEYBOARDS - RODDY BUTTOM\n\nThis odd-named guy lends an extra touch to a number of tracks, but is mainly used to introduce some atmospheric elements.\n\nTHE MUSIC\n\n1. FROM OUT OF NOWHERE\n\nThis is an upbeat, fast track that leaves nothing to the imagination regarding the style of this album. Patton sings in a high voice that adapts to the quite basic melody, and this is a very straightforward song without any breaks or solo sections that isn't particularly interesting.\n\n\"Obsession rules me-\n\nI'm yours from the start\n\nI know you see me-\n\nOur eyes interlock\"\n\n2. EPIC\n\nOne of the band's most well-known songs, this was the only track I had previously heard and it contains one of my favourite guitar sections in history, earning Jim Martin the distinction as one of my favourite guitarists. (He was in Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey too, which may impress about one person reading this). Quirky funk-rap style vocals in the verses and some great singing in the chorus make this my favourite track on the album, and the piano outro is a pleasant ending. Not quite an epic although the length makes it very manageable and suitable for radio play, but anyone who appreciates a good high guitar needs to hear that solo.\n\n\"You want it all but you can't have it\n\nIt's in your face but you can't grab it\"\n\n3. FALLING TO PIECES\n\nBeginning with a bass beat, this is a great song for Billy Gould and his four-string as it relies less on guitar riffs than the norm. Patton's vocals are a little irritating in this, especially as they seem too sing-song at times (or like a very nasal woman), but it's a track that's grown on me and is suitably different from what I normally listen to. Nice use of keyboard accompaniment in the second half also.\n\n\"The plot thickens every day And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away\"\n\n4. SURPRISE YOU'RE DEAD\n\nSurely the best title, the song's pretty cool too. The unison shouting matches the more aggressive riff well, and makes this more of a metal track than some of the others. Coming in at only 2:27 it's a nice addition to the CD, although the lyrics are pretty daft.\n\n\"The hatred I bestowed\n\nUpon your neck with a fatal blow\"\n\n5. ZOMBIE EATERS\n\nSurprisingly less of a horror theme than the last track, this is a soft ballad that evolves into a galloping rock anthem after two minutes. Patton demonstrates his vocal range on this one, and although I don't often like ballads I really enjoy the heaviness of the rest of it.\n\n\"I like to make a mess\n\nI laugh at your distress\"\n\n6. THE REAL THING\n\nThe title track is an eight-minute affair, much more deserving the title 'Epic' than the earlier track. All instruments are used to their full potential here, and some really great guitar rhythms make this another of the more metal tracks, sounding similar to classic Metallica in places. There is enough progression to keep the song interesting throughout, alternating between the chugging rhythm with staccato vocals, and more sombre sections in this condemnation of drug abuse.\n\n\"It's like the pattern below the skin\n\nYou gotta reach out and pull it all in\n\nAnd you feel like you're too close\n\nSo you swallow another dose\"\n\n7. UNDERWATER LOVE\n\nBeginning with some very eighties keyboards, it's clear that this is a more commercial track aimed at radio play, but it doesn?t feel out of place. One of my least favourite tracks as Mike's voice grates a little, and the quite bland keyboards overpower all the other instruments (although there is a great bass presence), but it's suitably placed after the dark nature of the previous few tracks - one of the funkier ones.\n\n\"Liquid seeps into your lungs\n\nBut your eyes look so serene\"\n\n8. THE MORNING AFTER\n\nThis song has a great drum beat that sets the pace, and the guitar presence is back where it belongs. Great use of quiet, almost orchestral keyboards from Roddy Buttom and more good vocals from Patton - who I have often become used to by this point - but I'm biased in favour of this song as it has some guitar solo action from Jim Martin. The end of the song is very fast and energetic as well, which is always a great touch.\n\n\"Is this my blood dried upon my face?\n\nOr is it the love of someone else?\"\n\n9. WOODPECKER FROM MARS\n\nThis instrumental is a distinctive track, although with a name like that it would have to be, and it seems that everything goes here. It begins with an Eastern-inspired melody before the main guitar kicks in with a fantastic driving riff that sounds very reminiscent of thrash bands of the time, notably Metallica and Slayer, but isn't too heavy to break out of this album's style. I don't miss Patton?s vocals, and if 'Epic' wasn't such a classic song this would certainly be my favourite offering from the album as it is far deeper and more experimental than the rest, again highlighting the talents of Jim Martin.\n\n10. WAR PIGS\n\nThe band's successful cover of one of Black Sabbath's most popular early songs, I much prefer this version in spite of how murdered I may get by Sabbath fans. The sound quality of the instruments is obviously infinitely clearer and I was never a huge fan of Ozzy Osbourne's screechy vocals so I'm fairly indifferent to Patton's recreation of them here. A good track that sounds a little out of place, as covers mostly do, but an interesting song to recreate.\n\n\"Generals gathered in their masses\n\nJust like witches at black masses\"\n\n11. EDGE OF THE WORLD\n\nI do not like this song. In fact, I would go as far as to say I hate this song. Not that it's inherently terrible, just really not for me. This track is an anti-climactic piano jazz-esque song without any rock elements and as such may prove popular with less metal-oriented fans, but isn't my cup of tea.\n\n\"Hey, little girl\n\nWould you like some candy?\"\n\nVERDICT\n\nMike Patton is not one of my favourite vocalists, and I much prefer some of his later efforts where he utilises a deeper singing voice, but in terms of musical skill and fun this is a great album. 'Woodpecker From Mars' is a fantastic instrumental, and there is a perfect balance of funky, heavy and melancholy tracks to appeal to most music fans.\n\nThe band's follow-up album, Angel Dust, is considered hugely influential and certainly offers chances throughout for the excellent musicians to show off the full range of their talents, but it is a little too experimental for me (and for the record buying public it turns out). It has been commented that Faith No More were ahead of their time and I think this is largely true; 'Epic' precedes the rap-rock bands that unfortunately dominated 2001, although in terms of the funk and thrash metal influences it's clear that this comes from the late eighties. This album is enjoyable, fast, fun, thought-provoking and, most importantly, groovy.\n\nFaith No More\n\nAngel Dust\n\nHeron on Crack\n\n****\n\nWritten on 11.06.07\n\nFaith No More’s second album with Mike Patton was the first on which his strange influence became a driving force, deviating vastly in many cases from the previous huge-selling alternative metal release ‘The Real Thing’ as the band explored more unusual, experimental territory more in the vein of Patton’s side-project Mr. Bungle.\n\nMany of the songs, particularly the singles towards the beginning of the album, stick to the highly influential funk metal sound that they had pioneered in the late eighties along with the likes of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, while some of the later songs expand on the hip hop influence of ‘The Real Thing,’ making this album largely, and sadly responsible for the rap metal boom of the late nineties, which now thankfully seems to have slumped again. I can’t imagine any other situation where I would be recommending an album favoured by Fieldy, the maize-field-haired gangsta bassist from Korn, but the impact of ‘Angel Dust’ has been far reaching to all sections of alternative metal, particularly some of the large progressive metal bands, and Kerrang! magazine has rated it the most influential album of all time (presumably in the world of alternative rock that Kerrang! pretends it caters for).\n\nThis wild mix of styles may appear, on first listen, to divide the album into complex and remedial sections to appeal to different breeds of listeners, but closer examination reveals that the depth of this material spans the majority of the disc, introducing subtle background nuances and changes of direction even in the more commercial sounding songs. This isn’t true for the entire album however, as songs like the white-trash piano song ‘RV’ are fairly easy to take at face value. Later versions of the album, and the one commonly available today, closes with the band’s popular cover of the Commodores’ hit ‘Easy,’ which provides some necessary easy-listening relief after the crazed likes of ‘Crack Hitler’ and ‘Jizzlobber.’ The guitars on this album vary between heavy metal and melodic pop-rock, and unfortunately move away from the centre stage they took on the previous album, unfortunate because this would be Jim Martin’s last album with the band and he could have had a more impressive swan (heron?) song than this.\n\n1. Land of Sunshine\n\n2. Caffeine\n\n3. Midlife Crisis\n\n4. RV\n\n5. Smaller and Smaller\n\n6. Everything’s Ruined\n\n7. Malpractice\n\n8. Kindergarten\n\n9. Be Aggressive\n\n10. A Small Victory\n\n11. Crack Hitler\n\n12. Jizzlobber\n\n13. Midnight Cowboy\n\n14. Easy\n\nAfter a heavy riff that lasts for a few bars, ‘Land of Sunshine’ belongs almost completely to the clunking rhythm of Billy Gould’s bass. Patton’s vocals alternate between a kind of crazy shouting and a more accessible clean singing voice in the chorus and most of the verses, a style he uses on all the songs the band intended to make money from as singles, and despite this accessibility this song does go beneath the surface largely due to the keyboards of Roddy Bottum. This minimalist synthesiser sounds very eighties, but provides a nice ‘falling’ or cascading effect that sounds mock-classical. There’s a very brief guitar solo, but it’s kept very short and sweet. Both this and the next song particularly, ‘Caffeine,’ were written while Patton was depriving himself of sleep, presumably with the intention of seeing what it did to his ability to write songs. Oddly, these are some of the more restrained pieces on the disc, though ‘Caffeine’ is more hard-edged, based more on loud guitars and pounding drums to create not so much a dreamy atmosphere as one in which the listener tries to become relaxed, but is prevented from doing so, fitting to Patton’s experiment. There are some real hardcore-style screams hidden in the mix a little towards the end, perhaps passing unnoticed on first listen, and Patton sounds very angry, in a funky, Chili Peppers way, throughout.\n\n‘Midlife Crisis’ is one of the most approachable songs, and the one most similar to the previous album, lacking most but not all of the weirdness of this one. The song begins in a minimalist soundscape of light percussion and quiet synth, as Patton whispers the lyrics, before picking up volume in the uplifting choruses. The guitar sounds noticeably stilted on this song, perhaps wary of alienating non-rock fans on the radio, and is forced to chug along in the background even in the louder sections. The problem with this song, which is otherwise pretty great, is its repetition and lack of new ideas, as pretty much everything has been heard after the first minute, leaving repetition until fade-out the only course of action. The afore-mentioned ‘RV’ follows, and this angry, depressing ditty spoken in a harsh white-trash old man voice always makes me picture a guy sitting out on his porch. It’s not as bad as some of the country-influenced stuff Metallica would later indulge in for the ‘Load’ and ‘Reload’ albums, being an obvious joke and stab at certain aspects of America, and in a way sounds like that raving, drunk Q.C. from ‘The Fast Show,’ particularly as only his final words are very clearly legible amidst the general murmur. The piano melody is in waltz time, and there’s quite a nice guitar hidden in the background for most of it that’s possibly influenced by rockabilly or something equally hillbillyish. This song is well placed on the album, providing some nice relief and interrupting the flow a little without having to be something terrible and distracting like a piano love song. No, trailer park yokel is what I like.\n\nAfter this relief comes perhaps the most challenging part of the album, and my favourite (if we are to assume, as I do despite obvious evidence to the contrary, that the album can be divided into sections). ‘Smaller and Smaller’ is the first song to properly make use of Martin’s guitar abilities, sounding almost Arabian in places though not enough to be clichéd, and dominating in the wordless chorus. Patton’s vocals are similarly at their most freestyle, overlapping and elusive and culminating in an echoed screech reminiscent of black metal, again hidden a little in the soundscape in the same way as the screams in Pink Floyd’s ‘Careful With That Axe, Eugene.’ A quieter psychedelic section ends the song, led by light drums, and a short solo finishes things off. This was never going to be a single, but it characterises the album well. ‘Everything’s Ruined’ initially threatens to be a ballad with Bottum’s soft piano intro, but remains more energetic despite the lack of guitars in all but a few sections, filled in with the piano melody. This is a great melodic song with a catchy chorus, catchy enough to be ripped off by Dream Theater for their 2001 album that, to be fair, steals ideas from all the big bands in the alternative scene, with the guitar soaring overhead and the bass providing a great rhythm without sounding clunky and funky this time.\n\nWith ‘Malpractice,’ one of the few songs never played live, aggression returns. Patton alternates between shouting and singing, and unleashes another of those black metal screams, while Martin plays a really discordant solo that hurts my ears. It’s very bleak and loud, taking more influence from hardcore than heavy metal however, and takes time out to play what sounds like a lullaby or child’s mobile, perhaps inspiring similar but more gaudy conceits in the music of teen angst bands like Slipknot to imply child abuse. Appropriately, ‘Kindergarten’ follows, and the album again alternates to a more melodic song, as well as starting to introduce the hip hop elements more prominently. Patton’s near-rap vocals don’t ruin the pleasant atmosphere of the keyboards and guitars, and are mostly modulated to a deep, masculine singing in the choruses.\n\nThe pattern continues with the next two songs: the deliberately confrontational song about gay oral sex, ‘Be Aggressive,’ which is suitably aggressive despite being based on sixties organs and seventies funk, certainly the height of funk on this album while also including the only real, extended guitar solo, and the contrastingly pleasant sounding ‘A Small Victory’ which begins with a beautifully melodic guitar and seems to finally crack this melodic song business that the previous two even-numbered tracks didn’t quite manage. With the guitars doing their soaring thing, taking a little time out for a squeaky Primus / Rage Against The Machine style solo, this song really belongs to the vocal deviance of Patton, who sings the verses pleasantly, scats a little in-between verses (basically opening his mouth and letting some sounds come out, despite the song’s lyrics about keeping your mouth shut), and even introducing some Michael Jackson sounding ‘woo’ bits towards the end. There appears to be more to this song than at first meets the ear, but it’s mainly just some sound effects in the background. This is one of my favourites, and certainly the peak of the album’s softer, feminine side.\n\nThe final ‘section’ of the album (alright, I’ll admit there doesn’t seem to be that much of a pattern. I guess it’s more down to my listening habits of this CD that I tend to play the songs in groups of four) begins aggressively and ends calmly, though it’s a gradual and interesting process. ‘Crack Hitler’ is one of the weirder songs on the album, fading in slowly with the bass playing what sounds like a techno rhythm, and with Patton joining in after a while speaking in tongues, through distortion that sounds like a police radio. This song is split into two styles, which repeat in tandem: the first is a soothing keyboard melody backed up by a nice rhythm section, and the other is a louder, roaring crowd chant led by Martin’s thrash metal guitar riffs. Faith No More’s direct influence on modern prog band Pain of Salvation is especially evident here, as pretty much the entire PoS discography sounds like this song. Faith No More takes its own influence from elsewhere however, with Patton attempting a heavy metal style ‘woah-oah-oah’ section towards the end, similar to the sing-along incentive added to pretty much every Iron Maiden hit single, and a Black Sabbath ‘War Pigs’ style air raid siren to boot, a song the band covered on their previous album. The distastefully titled ‘Jizzlobber’ is one of the more disconcerting songs on the album, perhaps even more so than ‘Smaller and Smaller,’ ‘Malpractice’ and ‘Be Aggressive’ combined, opening with weird, indeterminate sound effects and moving on to a keyboard melody influenced by classic horror films. The vocals are all over the place, sometimes distorted and sometimes even singing quite pleasantly and legibly, but becoming more tortured and screamed towards the end. Martin’s guitars are at their most ‘metal’ here, executing a real headbanging thrash riff and making quite a lot of noise that is nevertheless usurped in the end by the r"
