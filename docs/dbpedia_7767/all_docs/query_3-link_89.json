Not Being Defensive When It Comes To Criticism\n\n8. A Successful Musician Is A Humble Musician\n\nThere are those that make it in the music industry, and those that don’t.\n\nWhat separates successful musicians from those who aren’t able to carve out their desired career in music?\n\nIt's not random, there are reasons why some people 'make it' and some people don't.\n\nWhether or not you agree that luck may play a role in ‘success’ as a concept, hard work and other personality traits are necessary to achieve our goals, especially in music.\n\nMusic is notoriously one of the competitive and saturated industries to make a living from.\n\nThere are a plethora of professional musicians out there looking for ways to turn their passion into a thriving musical career.\n\nI think it's important to look at the habits of a successful musician, personality traits that allow them to stand out, and what specific qualities you can adopt in your own mindset to give you the best chance possible of succeeding within the music industry.\n\nHere are 8 characteristics, habits and qualities that successful musicians possess in abundance.\n\n1. Caring About Your Audience More Than Vanity Metrics And Numbers\n\nIt's important to pay attention to your growing audience and there are many ways of measuring this growth.\n\nWhether you are paying attention to your Spotify streams, your Instagram likes, or TikTok followers, it can often be a distraction from the bigger goal of looking after your audience and creating a lasting legacy as an artist.\n\nSuccessful musicians are able to separate themselves from these vanity metrics.\n\nNot getting caught up in the numbers and exercising a more complete perspective about why they do what they do.\n\nYes, it's great to get more recognition, more views on your youtube videos, more followers, more streams, more income and money from playing music... but chasing numbers often stems from comparing yourself to someone else's path and journey.\n\nIt usually ends in never feeling good enough. Managing your expectations and focusing on the basics of looking after your followers is how you really make your way to becoming a successful musician.\n\n2. Being Consistent And Making Time Every Single Day To Create\n\nYou think \"I'm just as motivated as them\", \"I'm just as good as them\" or \"I work HARDER than them\"...\n\nBut for some reason, they're getting the numbers and traction that you want to get.\n\nThere is always natural talent.\n\nBut I promise you, hard work beats talent hands down every single day.\n\nThe secret is consistency.\n\nBut think to yourself honestly...\n\nDo you wake up in the morning and go again?\n\nAnd again?\n\nDo you give up seeing friends at the weekend for your music?\n\nDo you invest in yourself first and don't buy that new game second?\n\nDo you allocate time every day to actually get better?\n\nDo you throw yourself into it 100%?\n\nWhen you find something that resonates with your audience, the key to growth is repeating it.\n\nAgain and again.\n\nBringing new people into your journey.\n\nIf you are serious about have a successful career in music, you have to practice consistency, be persistent in your music marketing strategies and commit to showing up every day.\n\n3. Exercising Patience With Your Music Career\n\nIf you are in this for the long game, patience is everything.\n\nPatience isn't one month of trying something and giving up.\n\nTrue patience is keeping going every day, adjusting your processes, and not getting stressed when you're not seeing the results you think you deserve straight away.\n\nPatience = Success.\n\nBeing patient comes with managing your expectations of what's possible in the immediate future.\n\nYou're not going to hit 1 million streams in 2 weeks.\n\nWrite down attainable goals to become a successful musician, don't set yourself up to fail.\n\nThen when you hit these goals, it keeps you motivated. These are qualities that the most successful musicians and artists understand and live by.\n\n4. Being Willing To Take The Hard Road, Not The Easy One\n\nDo the hard things for an awesome life, and do easy things for a difficult life.\n\nDo you want to contact 100 spotify playlist curators today?\n\n… Probably not.\n\nDo you want to constantly feel like you’re on the hamster wheel of content never feeling like you’re getting anywhere?\n\n… Probably not again.\n\nDo you want to write 50 songs for one single that you release?\n\n… Sounds like a lot of work.\n\nWhen you choose the hard option every time, life is better in the long run and you succeed.\n\nIf you choose easy like everyone else, you’ll always find that everything is hard.\n\nThe more you do, the easier it gets.\n\nToo many musicians rely on their creativity alone to see them through.\n\nIt's great to be blessed with talent and the ability to be a professional artist, but creativity and passion does not equal being a successful musician.\n\nGrowing your music fanbase isn't easy. It requires you to work hard and also do the hard things from time to time.\n\nReady to join DK-MBA?\n\n5. Not Chasing Quick Wins In The Music Industry\n\nWe live in a world of immediate gratification.\n\nEveryone wants their wins quickly. They believe that a successful music career can come in an instant.\n\nQuick wins are BS, it's that simple.\n\nNothing worth having is easy.\n\nBuilding a fanbase takes real work.\n\nNot giving up when things get tough or you don't get the results you want takes real work. If you're looking for the easiest, fastest way to get the numbers you want then just pay some bots for some streams and see where that gets you.\n\nIf you want to build a real and genuine music fanbase it takes time.\n\nIf you're just here to chase quick wins, this attitude will come back to bite you.\n\nWhat leads musicians into thinking that quick wins are the path to being successful?\n\nComparison.\n\nComparison always leads to despair. You're comparing your worst days with someone else's highlights.\n\nRemember that you never know someone else's journey and you're on your own path.\n\n6. Practicing & Improving Your Craft\n\nProfessional musicians don't become so without consistent practice.\n\nIf you want to be confident, amazing on your instrument, ready to perform at gigs, create art that people will resonate with, and work your way towards a potentially stable music career, you have to practice. It's that simple.\n\nDedicate time every single day to honing your craft and learning.\n\nTry to learn something new every single day (especially in fields you know you need to work on!). You can't be amazing overnight, but you can get 1% better every day. And that really is all you need.\n\nResults come from painstaking practice, hard work, learning, and education.\n\nThe process of learning and practicing for musicians isn't just about getting better at your instrument. It's everything.\n\nYour attitude, your commitment to showing up regularly on socials, your content creation strategy, time management and so much more.\n\n7. Not Being Defensive When It Comes To Criticism\n\nMusicians have it tough in this regard.\n\nWe pour our heart and soul into multiple hours grinding in the studio, shaping our art, working on our band, and using our years of musical skills and passion to create something we feel emotionally attached to.\n\nSo yeah. It absolutely sucks when you go through all of that hard work and as a musician, and you spot a negative or bad comment about your music.\n\nIt requires a whole new level of resilience and mindset to be able to deal with haters.\n\nThese are qualities that don't come easy for musicians.\n\nIn music promotion, you have to learn how to deal with rejection and the simple fact that not everybody is going to like what you do.\n\nIt's a tough world out there in the music industry. It's never easy to deal with criticism in any field, but it feels even more personal when it comes to musicians and their art.\n\nDon't take it personally. Control what you can. Your own mindset, music, and content.\n\n8. A Successful Musician Is A Humble Musician\n\nIndependent artists and musicians should pay more attention to authenticity.\n\nBeing real, humble, and true to yourself is how you create a long-lasting legacy with your music and your career.\n\nYou can spot a fake a mile off.\n\nDisingenuous artists don't often get very far.\n\nRecognizing where you came from, the journey you are on, and sharing that with the world is how you can share your passion through a lens of authenticity.\n\nThe most successful musicians are grateful for every fan and every person that chooses to follow them on their journey.\n\nBe thankful and give more than you take.\n\nIf you are humble and take a genuine interest in your fans, they will take a genuine interest in your music and success."
