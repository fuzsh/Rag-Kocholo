        "text": "What Musicians and Singers Do About this section\n\nMusicians and singers play instruments or sing for live audiences and in recording studios. They perform a variety of genres, such as classical, jazz, and rock.\n\nDuties\n\nMusicians and singers typically do the following:\n\nPerform music for live audiences and recordings\n\nAudition for positions in orchestras, choirs, bands, and other types of music groups\n\nPractice playing instruments or singing to improve their technique\n\nRehearse music and parts to prepare for performances\n\nFind and book locations for performances or concerts\n\nPromote their careers by maintaining a website or social media presence or by doing photo shoots and interviews\n\nMusicians play one or more instruments. To make themselves more marketable, many become proficient in multiple musical instruments or styles. Some diversify by both singing and playing instruments.\n\nMusicians play solo or in orchestras, bands, or limited-size groups, such as trios. Those in bands or groups may play at small venues, such as private parties or bars, sometimes building enough of a fan base to get a recording contract or representation by an agent. Musicians who work in orchestras perform in venues with a stage large enough to accommodate all the musicians and their instruments. A few orchestra musicians become section leaders, who may be responsible for assigning parts to other musicians or for leading rehearsals.\n\nSingers perform vocal music in a variety of genres. Some specialize in a particular vocal style, such as opera or jazz. Singers may perform in different languages, such as French or Italian, particularly if they specialize in classical music or opera. In addition to singing, those in opera and musical theater productions must act during their performances.\n\nMusicians who specialize in playing backup for a singer or band leader during recording sessions and live performances are known as session musicians. Singers who provide background vocals to harmonize with or support a lead singer are known as backup singers or backing vocalists.\n\nSometimes, musicians and singers write their own music to record and perform. For more information about careers in songwriting, see the profile on music directors and composers.\n\nSome musicians and singers give private music lessons to children and adults. Others with a background in music may teach music in elementary, middle, and high schools, which typically requires a bachelor’s degree and a teaching license. For more information, see the profiles on kindergarten and elementary school teachers, middle school teachers, and high school teachers.\n\nHow to Become a Musician or Singer About this section\n\nMusicians and singers typically do not need formal postsecondary education to enter the occupation. However, those pursuing careers in some genres, such as classical or opera, may choose to earn a bachelor’s or higher degree. Musicians and singers need extensive training and regular practice to acquire their skills.\n\nEducation\n\nMusicians and singers typically need no postsecondary education to enter the occupation. Musicians and singers of some genres, such as classical music and opera, may pursue training that leads to a bachelor’s degree in a field such as music theory or performance. To be accepted into one of these programs, applicants typically are required to submit recordings or to audition in person and sometimes must do both.\n\nUndergraduate music programs teach students about music history and styles. In addition, they teach methods for improving instrumental and vocal techniques and musical expression. Undergraduate voice programs also may include courses in diction. Courses in a foreign language may benefit students who intend to perform in that language. Some business courses, such as marketing, may be helpful for learning about the self-promotion often required for professional musicians and singers.\n\nSome musicians and singers choose to continue their education by pursuing a master’s degree in fine arts or music.\n\nTraining\n\nMusicians and singers need extensive training and regular practice to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to perform music professionally. They typically begin singing or learning to play an instrument at a young age by taking private lessons and school classes. As they advance, they may participate in music camps, festivals, or fellowships.\n\nAdvancement\n\nAs with other occupations in which people perform, advancement for musicians and singers means becoming better known, finding work more easily, and earning more money for each performance. Successful musicians and singers often rely on agents or managers to find them jobs, negotiate contracts, and develop their careers. Some musicians and singers advance to leading musical groups or becoming section leaders in an orchestra. Others may advance to become music directors and composers.\n\nImportant Qualities\n\nDedication. Auditioning for jobs can be a frustrating process because it may take many different auditions to get hired. Musicians and singers must be determined to continue auditioning after receiving rejections.\n\nDiscipline. Talent is not enough for most musicians and singers to find employment in this field. They must practice and rehearse consistently to improve their technique, style, and performance.\n\nInterpersonal skills. Musicians and singers need to work well with a variety of people, such as agents, producers, and conductors. They must be able to build connections and create good working relationships.\n\nMusical talent. Professional musicians or singers must have superior musical abilities.\n\nPhysical stamina. Musicians and singers who perform on stage or go on tour for weeks or months must be able to endure frequent travel and irregular performance schedules.\n\nPromotional skills. To build a fan base, musicians and singers need to promote their music and performances through local communities, word of mouth, and social media.\n\nPay About this section\n\nMusicians and Singers\n\nMedian hourly wages, May 2023\n\nMusicians and singers\n\n$39.14\n\nEntertainers and performers, sports and related workers\n\n$25.65\n\nTotal, all occupations\n\n$23.11\n\nThe median hourly wage for musicians and singers was $39.14 in May 2023.
