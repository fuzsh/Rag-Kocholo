        "text": "Faith No More\n\nThe Real Thing\n\n5.0\n\nclassic\n\nReview\n\nby Theleftside2 USER (9 Reviews)\n\nJanuary 14th, 2005 | 28 replies\n\nRelease Date: 1989 | Tracklist\n\nFaith No More - The Real Thing\n\nI had written a really long and good review for this album and the page didn't work for me! Then when I went back, The page was expired! Now I remember why I didn't want to make these anymore. :upset:\n\nWell here goes nothing...I'm going to try and do it by memory.\n\nFaith No More\n\nMike Bordin - drums\n\nRoddy Bottum - keyboards\n\nJim Martin - Guitar\n\nBilly Gould - bass\n\nMike Patton - Vocals\n\nThis was Faith No More's first album with Mike Patton (previously of Mr. Bungle) as the frontman. the lyrics were written by Mike within a period of just a few weeks of joining the band, taking over Chuck Mosely's spot after he was kicked out for his drug/alcohol problems and erratic behavior. Patton would later say he got sick of The Real Thing because it seemed so one-dimensional to him.\n\n1. From Out Of Nowhere\n\nthis is a perfect album opener. Fast paced and loaded with a nice catchy melody. Mike's singing flows smoothly with the music on this song. This song has been covered by the Power Metal band Helloween. But of course, no one can top Mike's vocal abilities. No One! :evil: 4.5/5\n\n2. Epic\n\nThis is the song that put Faith No More on the mainstream, and changed music alone. It is considered their supposed 'one hit wonder.' This is probably Mike's lowest point vocally, but his rap-type vocals during the verses shouldn't be ignored, especially the chorus. This song has some of my favorite moments in all of music. Even the music video has these moments...from the bright color paint, fake rain, eyeballs everywhere, Mike's craziness, the band's hilarious Lip sinching, and the unforgetable flipping fish.\n\nhttp://www.fnm.com/news/goldfish.gif :D\n\nMusically, Jim Martin has a nice guitar solo that I wish they had gave him a bit more chances at guitar soloing. His fill right before the chorus is one of my favorite parts in all of music. Same goes for Roddy Bottum's keyboard ending. A perfect way to end this Classic. 5/5\n\n3. Falling to Pieces\n\nOne of the poppiest tracks on the album. This song simply is too catchy. the lyric \"My life is falling to pieces, somebody put me together\" will not fail to get embedded in your head. I love how before each chorus, every member gets chance to have a fill. This is a Really good song. 5/5\n\n4. Surprise! You're Dead!\n\nWritten mostly by Jim Martin. This song has an almost slayer-like feel to it. Mike chooses to go with a more deeper almost Tom Araya/Buzz Ozborne type of vocal approach on this track. Jim Martin's gallopping guitar riffs are great! You can notice how much they lacked \"Big Ugly Jim's\" crunchy guitar tone from their first 4 albums after they kicked him out. This is one of my favorite songs on here, my band is planning on covering this song real soon. 4/5\n\n5. Zombie Eaters\n\nThis song is gorgeous. Starts off very melodic and atmospheric. then after a minute it goes into a frenzy of hard rock guitar while Mike Patton sings/raps about being a baby. It's just a really good song. 4.5/5\n\n6. The Real Thing\n\nThis is another brilliant epic by Faith No More. Almost identical to Zombie Eaters, it has some of the nicest lyrics I've read from Mike Patton. It has a very haunting feel to it. This is one of the songs off this album where I could lay back and listen to on repeat at least 2-3 times. 4.5/5\n\n7. Underwater Love\n\nThis song almost feels out of place. It really brings a lot from Roddy Bottum's keyboards. Also Billy Gould's bassline is one of the grooviest I've heard around. The lyrics are about a man who drowns his wife in the bathtub so she wont leave him. Crazy stuff, eh? 4/5\n\n8. The Morning After\n\nThis is the lowest point of the album. Even though it is reminiscent to their Chuck Mosely era (The lyrics were originally written by Chuck) this song is overshadowed by the rest of the album. The drum and bass are really the strength of this song. 3.5/5\n\n9. Woodpecker From Mars\n\nThis is one of my favorite instrumentals around. Billy Gould's bass skills really shine the most on this song. It's like a speed metal Primus type of song.\n\nIt may seem like it drags on a just little. But it's still a really good track. 4/5\n\n10. War Pigs\n\nThis is the cover of Black Sabbath's War Pigs. and In my opinion, Faith No More rip the original to shreds. Mike Patton's voice is a hell of a lot better than Ozzy's. And you can't argue with that. ;) Also, if you can check out their Live at the Brixton Academy version of this song, do so. It's even better. 4.5/5\n\n11. Edge Of The World\n\nThis song really displays Mike's vocal abilities. it's just one nice loungy twisted love tune with Mike singing about being a pedophile. :lol: \"Give me a smile. Let me see those pearlies. I’ll do anything for the little girlies.\" Usually at first you can't make out the words but when you do, It's hilarious. 4.5/5\n\n\"Faith No More will one day be regarded as one of the most influential bands of the 1990s. Bands from KoRn to Our Lady Peace have gone on the record praising the abilities of Faith No More. It has been confirmed by MTV and VH-1 that without the video for \"Epic\" there probably would be no Limp Bizkit or Incubus—at least in their current incarnations—for better or worse. \"Epic\" mortally injured “hair band�? music so that Nirvana’s \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" could put the nail in the hairspray coffin.\" - Culturedose.net\n\nThis is one masterpiece of an album, that everyone seemed to love.\n\nBut little did they know what was about to be unleashed on their next album.:evil:\n\nI gave The Real Thing 4.9/5. :p\n\nTweet\n\nRecent reviews by this authorBeastie Boys Licensed to IllDe La Soul 3 Feet High and RisingDe La Soul Buhloone MindstateBeck Mellow GoldHarlingtox A.D.
