        "text": "In 1988, off the back of a pair of modestly successful albums, Faith No More split ties with frontman Chuck Mosely, whose erratic drug and alcohol abuse was affecting the image of the band—Mosely reportedly fell asleep onstage during a record release show for their Introduce Yourself album. After appointing Mike Patton as their new singer, their third studio album, The Real Thing (June, 1989), was a surprising success, which catapulted the band right into the American rock’n’roll consciousness.\n\nOnce dismissing Mosley, the band went to work, writing all of the music for the album before even considering a new singer. After this process was complete, Patton, the then front man of progressive outfit Mr. Bungle, offered up his services. With only two weeks up his sleeve, he somehow managed to write every lyric for the album.\n\nBy early 1990s, the album, unfortunately, had disappeared from the Billboard charts, with only one track reaching the top ten; the band felt destined to maintain their cult status as outsiders, unable to achieve true commercial success. But then, in late February, The Real Thing was nominated for a Grammy (Best Heavy Metal Performance) and the album returned to the charts at 188. By March, MTV was more than interested, airing the surreal and off-centre video clip for the single Epic. Many have since argued this is what solicited their success— steady movement down the charts meant that by late July the album was in the Top Twenty. With continued momentum, shortly thereafter, it was certified gold. In this period, the band went from virtual anonymity to being stalked up and down the streets by bizarre fans and crazed paparazzi.\n\nThe album cover, which features a scorched earth background with a liquid-like flame sprouting from a splash of what seems milk (itself shaped strangely like a dish) was produced exclusively by the record label. The band, apparently, originally wanted their signature star to feature prominently on the cover, but their record label Slash argued this was too derivative and ultimately the band wasn’t afforded any creative decisions on what was eventually released.\n\nThe image of the splash of milk featured on the cover was reportedly inspired by ‘Milk Drop Coronet’, the work of revolutionary photographer Harold Edgerton. An electrical engineer by profession, Harold used a camera of his own invention to freeze the impact of a droplet of milk on a table— an image indiscernible to traditional cameras. Up-ending stop motion photography, he showed that the camera could advance human perception, essentially changing the world of photography. In 1937 one version of the image was featured in the first photography exhibition at New York City’s Museum of Modern Art.\n\nToday, his work is considered among the first step towards the modern electronic flash.\n\nReturning to the album, it was not without controversy. Despite the appealing, driven rhythms of the music, the intense lyrical content, and the inherent artistry, many fans were upset by the removal of Mosey, some going as far as accusing the remaining band members of white-washing the band (removing Mosey because of his race). Meanwhile, Anthony Kiedis, frontman for The Red Hot Chilli Peppers, accused Patton of trying to steal his style in the Epic video; this is despite the fact Faith No More had previously played with The Chili Peppers on The Uplift Mofo Party Tour.\n\nRegardless, The Real Thing, considered by many as genre-redefining heavy metal, remains their most successful album to date."
