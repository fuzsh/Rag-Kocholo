        "text": "Faith No More is an American rock band from San Francisco, California, formed in 1979. Before settling on the current name, the band performed under the names Sharp Young Men and later Faith No Man. Bassist Billy Gould, keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Roddy Bottum and drummer Mike Bordin are the longest-remaining members of the band, having been involved since its inception. The band underwent several early lineup changes, and some major changes later on. The current lineup of Faith No More consists of Gould, Bordin, Bottum, lead guitarist Jon Hudson, and vocalist/lyricist Mike Patton.\n\nAfter releasing six studio albums, including best-selling records The Real Thing (1989) and Angel Dust (1992), Faith No More officially announced its breakup on April 20, 1998. The band has since reunited, conducting The Second Coming Tour between 2009 and 2010, and releasing its seventh studio album, Sol Invictus, in May 2015. Following the touring cycle of Sol Invictus, Faith No More went on hiatus once again. In November 2019, the band made the announcement that they would be reuniting to embark on a 2020 UK and European tour. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the start of the tour was postponed until June 2021.\n\nLive[]\n\nRecorded live in Norwich on 1990-02-06 for the Friday Rock Show. Broadcast: 02 March 1990.
