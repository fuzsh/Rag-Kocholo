        "text": "For most of my years working with worship teams, I have been both the Worship Leader (WL) and the Music Director (MD) or Band Leader. But, many worship leaders prefer having someone else to direct the musicians so they can concentrate on leading the congregation in worship.\n\nA few years back, I worked for a 7,000 member church that had four worship teams that rotate. I lead worship on one of the teams and with the other three I served as the MD.\n\nIn my role as a Music Director, here is what I have found gets the best overall results from our teams. Special note: we use an MD mic that is programmed by the sound-man so that only the worship team can hear the MD in their ‘in-ear’ monitors.\n\nPre-rehearsal\n\nContact the worship band and set up the rehearsal. This is usually done 4-6 weeks in advance. (We use Planning Center Online).\n\nAbout a week before the rehearsal, I double-check and follow-up on any team members who haven’t responded yet. (texting usually gets the best response)\n\nRecruit (and/or audition) any subs that might be needed.\n\nPray for the team and the church.\n\nAfter receiving the worship list from the worship leader (usually 5-10 days before the rehearsal), I may make suggestions on keys, songs and flow.\n\nWrite any new charts that might be needed for that week. This can include any choir, string, brass or orchestra parts if they are involved that week.\n\nUpdate all the charts and Mp3’s online for the band to rehearse with. (note: Planning Center has the ability to transpose MP3’s. I’ve also done this using Garageband. Currently Multitracks Rehearsal Mix does the transposing for you)\n\nEmail out notes to the band & singers (on the Monday before) with reminders of areas to pay special attention to and practice before the mid-week rehearsal.\n\nProgram the click for each song and any back-ground tracks for the service. (Currently I use Multitracks.com and Playback for the clicks and tracks.)\n\nServe as IT help for any members having trouble with Planning Center.\n\nDo my own personal rehearsal (vocal, keys, acoustic guitar and/or woodwinds). This usually includes practicing with the original recordings (often in a new key) and reviewing the arrangements, instrumental groove and vocal parts.\n\nIf I need to sing and also talk to the band, I use an A/B switcher on my mic.\n\nWork with the sound-man on the band set-up for that week.\n\nLately I have been using ‘Multitracks.com‘ Playback app on most of the songs. This usually involves loading the songs on my iPad, editing the arrangements, ending and transitions between songs.\n\nMid-week Rehearsal (Thursday PM)\n\nShow up early and do my personal set-up.\n\nGreet all the team members as they arrive.\n\nIntroduce any subs for that week.\n\nWork on getting the rehearsal started as soon as possible.\n\nRun the in-ear or monitor soundcheck.\n\nHave the worship leader open in prayer.\n\nWork with the worship leader on a song order for the rehearsal.\n\nSet-up my iPad or iPhone with Multitracks.com Playback app.\n\nRun an optional in-ear click off my 2nd iPad.\n\nCount-in the songs (via MD mic) and give musical cues.\n\nIf the band plays without music. Give in-ear ‘Nashville Numbers’ cues.\n\nAddress any problem areas that arise.\n\nKeep the rehearsal moving and productive.\n\nGive vocal and instrumental suggestions.\n\nMake musical suggestions to team members on areas to work on before Sunday.\n\nClose in prayer.\n\nProduction meeting (Thursday)\n\nReview last weeks services with the pastors, usher co-ordinator, sound and media.\n\nWe work on this week’s service order.\n\nClose in prayer\n\nPre-Service Rehearsal\n\nShow up early and do my personal set-up.\n\nWork on getting the rehearsal started as soon as possible.\n\nPray.\n\nReview the service order, lyrics and video shots with the worship team, pastors, sound, media, camera operators and floor director.\n\nWork with the team and sound on any last-minute adjustments.\n\nWork on musical transitions from one song to the next.\n\nEncourage the worship team to get past the music and worship God.\n\nPray.\n\nServices (9 AM & 11 AM)\n\nThe band goes on early to tune.\n\nCue and count-in all the clicks.\n\nGive all the live musical cues (via MD mic). This usually includes cueing the team for the introduction, verses, chorus, bridge, any solos, a cappella sections, transitions and endings. (lately I have been using the app ‘Playback’ from Multitracks.com to do that). If the band doesn’t use music, then cueing the band via ‘The Nashville Numbering System’ is also helpful.\n\nPlay and worship God.\n\nRemind the worship team to smile and worship.\n\nSocialize, eat and build community with the team between services.\n\nPlay keyboard for the pastor at the end of the service.\n\nWhat is your experience with the Worship Leader – Music Director dynamic? What is working in your situation?\n\nCheck out my new book.. “Leading Worship ~ Notes from a Grand Adventure’ available in Kindle or Soft Cover Editions. This is a great gift for the musician or worshipper in your life.\n\nIf you have learned from this or any of my 300+ blogs may I suggest giving a small donation. You may do so via credit card on this PayPal account.\n\nComments from Facebook:\n\nTamarah ~ Great article – very helpful, thanks! I am the worship leader and music director, but as my team is growing, I have been looking at how to move to having the two roles separate.? In your article, you list out the job of the music director, and I would love to see a list of the job responsibilities for the worship leader working with a music director.\n\nMark Cole ~ That’s a good thought.. I’ll work on that..\n\nAndrew ~ We use an MD each week, and it’s amazing how much flexibility that has created in what we do. His role looks super similar to what you’ve laid out. One of the most important things we’ve learned is to really develop the chemistry between the WL and the MD. When that is done, I (WL) know that we’re on the same page. He has full authority to make calls for repeated sections, structure changes, etc, because he can sense where I might want to lead the congregation. It’s awesome!\n\nMark Cole ~ Cool.. thanks for that feedback.. I totally agree about the WL-MD relationship.. it can make the whole team & worship stronger."
