        "text": "photo manipulation & text by nacrowe\n\nif you havent seen an INTERVIEW hosted by JOHN RUSKIN, a.k.a. NARDWUAR THE HUMAN SERVIETTE, they are absolutely something to behold. he specializes in IDIOSYNCRATIC dialogues with NOTABLE MUSICIANS on tour in his hometown of VANCOUVER, where he is the longtime SINGER and KEYBOARD PLAYER for the OBSCURE GARAGE ROCK band THE EVAPORATORS. the dude is a bit OUTRAGEOUS given his NERVOUS, HIGH-STRUNG ENERGY, wavering and nasally SPEAKING TONE and his OVER-THE-TOP choice in attire that is very much on a SERIOUS PAYNE STEWART (RIP) tip.\n\nthis is all a bit of a ruse really meant to diminish the expectations of the subject (and audience) from an INTERVIEW that is RESEARCHED, PREPARED and COORDINATED in the extreme. often he will have OBSCURE VINYL RECORDS, BOOKS, TOYS and MISCELLANEOUS PARAPHERNALIA of SIGNIFICANT importance to the subject, who are often absolutely GOBSMACKED and STUNNED into silence but how INTIMATE his KNOWLEDGE of their lives is. the fun of watching a NARDWUAR interview is the anticipation of a POPULAR FIGURE or CULTURAL ICON who no doubt has been routinely pampered and catered to by fans and entourage alike lose their shit at this odd CANADIAN's ability to expose their INNERMOST PREDILECTIONS and OBSESSIONS. in essence, professional cool people losing their cool in public.\n\nNOTEWORTHY past PARTICIPANTS include PHARRELL WILLIAMS (N.E.R.D., THE NEPTUNES), IAN MACKAYE (MINOR THREAT, FUGAZI), J. COLE, JELLO BIAFRA (DEAD KENNEDYS), MAC MILLER, A$AP ROCKY, HENRY ROLLINS (BLACK FLAG, ROLLINS BAND), TYLER THE CREATOR (ODD FUTURE), STEVE ALBINI, SNOOP DOGG and even KURT COBAIN (NIRVANA) among countless others over a decades long career.\n\nmost definitely worth checking out as these INTERVIEWS are as INFORMATIVE as they are ENTERTAINING. and WEIRD. just WEIRD.\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\ni always found it a particularly CURIOUS decision that BRITISH ALTERNATIVE ROCK band BUSH decided to utilize the services of notoriously SPARTAN record \"producer\" STEVE ALBINI (PIXIES, THE JESUS LIZARD, PJ HARVEY, HELMET, THE BREEDERS, FUGAZI) on their second album RAZORBLADE SUITCASE (TRAUMA, 1996) and the follow-up to their incredibly commercially SUCCESSFUL debut SIXTEEN STONE (review linked HERE). ALBINI is a recording PURIST who sees his role solely as a vehicle via his audio engineering skills for bands and songwriters to effectively communicate their art. he does not have a sound per se and is not interested in assisting with compositional or artistic decisions. the CELEBRATED records that ALBINI is associated with are all sonically DIVERSE and showcase the recording artist usually unadorned with little reverb or studio trickery. just precise mic-ing techniques in dry studios with minimal takes, the result being rather BARE and INTIMATE portraits of the artists themselves.\n\nfor KURT COBAIN and NIRVANA this was exactly the vibe they wanted given the LUSH, largely OVERDUBBED and wide-screen aural landscape present in BUTCH VIG's recording of NEVERMIND (DGC, 1991). the sound of IN UTERO (DGC, 1993) was a direct reaction to the previous record, which in turn was a reaction to the decidedly RUDIMENTARY and GRUNGY sound of the JACK ENDINO-produced BLEACH (SUB POP, 1989) before it. there is a sonic transition taking place that showcased the EVER-EVOLVING sound COBAIN was chasing that led him from ENDINO to VIG to ALBINI.\n\nwith BUSH, from the get-go they were critically MALIGNED for being OPPORTUNISTIC NIRVANA wannabes, which was a little UNFAIR but you can see from a marketing angle the niche singer and main songwriter GAVIN ROSSDALE was filling. NIRVANA left a massive void on radio, MTV and in the culture at large and post-GRUNGE bands like BUSH, CANDLEBOX, EVERCLEAR and even the FOO FIGHTERS were attempting to address. what i dont understand is that if you are being critiqued as being a clone of another band, why would your sophomore album be produced by the same producer of said band's sophomore effort. that decision wreaks of a criminal lack of SELF-REFLECTION and outright ARROGANCE because RAZORBLADE SUITCASE is not on the same level as IN UTERO.\n\nand its not like BUSH was alone with this dynamic. take the STONE TEMPLE PILOTS, whose CORE (review linked HERE) was constantly and unfavorably being compared with PEARL JAM at the time of its release. looking back i dont hear the commonalities, but that might be in part because STONE TEMPLE PILOTS and frontman SCOTT WEILAND effectively EVOLVED on subsequent releases that brought in outside DISPARATE and ENERGETIC elements (70s GLAM ROCK, 60s PSYCHEDELIA) to their sound that veered far away from the more INTROSPECTIVE FOLK and CLASSIC ROCK elements mined by PEARL JAM.\n\nat the time i just didnt understand why BUSH attempted to sound (again) like NIRVANA so explicitly on their second go around. song-wise the material was sub-par to their debut, with singles like \"GREEDY FLY,\" \"COLD CONTAGIOUS\" and \"SWALLOWED\" not being the MEMORABLE and ANTHEMIC numbers that songs like \"EVERYTHING ZEN,\" \"GLYCERINE,\" \"MACHINEHEAD\" and \"LITTLE THINGS\" were previously. its really a stretch to buy into the notion that ROSSDALE was SOCIALLY INEPT and SULLEN given his model looks and celebrity romantic dalliances throughout this period, which seems to be the narratorial perspective throughout the songs on RAZORBLADE SUITCASE. it just wreaks of INAUTHENTICITY. before his death, COBAIN repeatedly voiced his DISCOMFORT with AMERICAN celebrity culture and sought valiantly to utilize such a platform to advocate for political causes he supported (anti-homophobia, sexism and racism) and bands and songwriters he felt deserved more shine from the national press (THE RAINCOATS, MELVINS, DANIEL JOHNSTON, THE VASELINES, THE MEAT PUPPETS, SHONEN KNIFE, THE BREEDERS, HALF JAPANESE). ROSSDALE in comparison has no DISTINGUISHING agenda or cultural community he is representing outside of himself. dude felt like a scab at the time.\n\nthe next album with its electronic embellishments seems to be when BUSH finally found his lane as a musician. id advocated to start with THE SCIENCE OF THINGS (TRAUMA, 1999) and work your way backwards. maybe even skip RAZORBLADE SUITCASE entirely.\n\nparodies by nacrowe\n\nthere is something REFRESHING about the manner in which RECORDING ENGINEER STEVE ALBINI goes about his business. too often people, me included, lionize PRODUCERS as if they are MOSES navigating clueless bands through the RECORDING PROCESS and to the promised land. at best, some producers have HUMILITY and perceive themselves as COLLABORATORS or vehicles for artists to utilize in realizing their vision. with ALBINI he strips all of that pomp and circumstance to the core, instead viewing himself as a COMMON engineer attempting to capture the live sound of the band with no input or outside manipulation. being a musician himself as a founding member of the SEMINAL CHICAGO noise rock band BIG BLACK and later projects such as SHELLAC and RAPEMAN, ALBINI wholeheartedly believes in enabling the artist. as a RECORDING ENGINEER (he scoffs at the title and never refers to himself as a \"PRODUCER\"), ALBINI believes in a STRICT division of LABOR whereby creative decisions are the sphere of influence of the artist and the tracking of which is his.\n\nhe is known for recording quickly with MINIMAL if no overdubs altogether, which leads to music that has an IMMEDIATE, UNVARNISHED quality such as CELEBRATED albums like PJ HARVEY's RID OF ME (ISLAND, 1993), PIXIES' SURFER ROSA (4AD, 1988), HELMET's MEANTIME (INTERSCOPE, 1992), NEUROSIS' TIMES OF GRACE (RELAPSE, 1999), THE BREEDERS' POD (4AD, 1990) and arguably most famously NIRVANA's IN UTERO (DGC, 1994). he also charges a SET RATE with NO FUTURE POINTS on the album. in this way he sees his work as a form of LABOR akin to a plumber or electrician. he comes in, completes his SERVICE, and lets the artist keep the results with no strings attached.\n\nwhat is AMAZING is that there is almost FANATICAL PURITY to that WORKINGMAN ETHOS as ALBINI has refused time and again to leverage his position to create FINANCIAL WINDFALLS for himself and his family. again, as an artist himself, such GAINS would be perceived at the EXPENSE of his clients and result in a COMPROMISED DEBASEMENT of the RECORDING PROCESS. in his perspective, such would be a blaring CONFLICT OF INTEREST. for him, his experiences and IMMENSE abilities are a resource for use by the creative community with NO ELITISM or expectation attached. the more i think about it the more REMARKABLE his BUSINESS ETHICS are.\n\nive made no qualms about hiding the fact that i am currently enrolled in business school pursuing an MBA. everything there is seemingly done with the end objective of extracting as much ECONOMIC VALUE from any product or service as mathematically and ETHICALLY possible, with an emphasis on the former. it is not that ALBINI's method is an anomaly in the music industry, it feels like an outlier in general. i cant even begin to imagine how much MONEY he left on the table with IN UTERO alone. but thats kind of the point.\n\nFINANCIAL CONCERNS will come and go, but art lives on forever. best to maintain and ensure the PURITY of that PROCESS and let the other matters come to its own equilibrium and conclusion. ALBINI is someone i am continually FASCINATED by both musically and ETHICALLY and i find myself coming to terms with his since of BUSINESS ETHOS all the time.\n\n​\n\n​embedded below is the second DEER GOD RADIO episode on nonprofit internet radio station MAKERPARKRADIO.NYC, which originally aired a little over three years ago. the playlist includes music from throughout STEVE ALBINI's 'PRODUCTION' catalogue. enjoy!\n\nphoto & text by nacrowe\n\nTHE BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD EXPERIENCE (GEFFEN, 1993) is quite the interesting 1990s CULTURAL ARTIFACT. produced by none other than STEVE ALBINI, this compilation was obviously a bit of a cash grab at the height of the ALTERNATIVE ROCK movement that the BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD TV SHOW had no small part in helping popularize (just as WINGER and all those HAIR METAL bands that got pilloried and became instant cultural pariahs), but as such go this one had staying power.\n\nthe unquestioned standout track by a mile is the strong NIRVANA track \"I HATE MYSELF AND WANT TO DIE\" which was one of the last tracks released prior to his suicide. in fact, this song was the would-be title track to IN UTERO (review linked HERE), as I HATE MYSELF AND WANT TO DIE was the original working title for their third album. other notable tracks include a memorable ANTHRAX cover of the BEASTIE BOYS' \"LOOKING DOWN THE BARREL OF A GUN\" track (off PAUL'S BOUTIQUE) and the hard-charging WHITE ZOMBIE song \"I AM HELL.\" the album is rounded out by largely forgettable, hit-or-miss tracks by the likes of THE RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, PRIMUS and MEGADETH.\n\ni originally had this record on cd back in elementary school in SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA and the two songs i remember pretty distinctly (aside from the NIRVANA, ANTHRAX and WHITE ZOMBIE tracks) was the updated CHER duet \"I'VE GOT YOU BABE\" with BEAVIS & BUTTHEAD and of course the epic BUTTHEAD slow jam \"COME TO BUTTHEAD.\" looking back now you have to hand it to CHER that she had a sense of humor and was able to laugh at herself. you wonder how much her inclusion may have also been to show how cool she was to her young son ELIJAH BLUE ALLMAN (of much later DEADSY fame). i wouldnt blame her for a second if that was the case. it's pretty badass. \"COME TO BUTTHEAD\" is also surprisingly well-produced and no wonder, it was composed and recorded by none other than funk brother par excellence NILE RODGERS himself. BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD creatorMIKE JUDGE definitely had lots of surprises on this cash grab no doubt.\n\nthe humor surrounding teenage attitudes towards BODILY-FUNCTIONS and SEXUALITY would be a hard sell in today's environment, but that is why it is interesting to revisit this record from time to time. it also makes you consider how the reboot of this show will fair now 30 years later from a different historical moment with TECHNOLOGY and CULTURE moving at speeds unheard of back in the day. it is an interesting conceit nonetheless.\n\ni love this record but i am completely biased. i listened to this record during my formative years so of course id recommend it. definitely worth checking out."
