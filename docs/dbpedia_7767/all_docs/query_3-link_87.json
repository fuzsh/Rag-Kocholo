Here is a complete glossary of common piano terms you‚Äôll encounter throughout your musical journey.\n\nThe piano has been around for a very long time and many music terms are Italian due to Italy‚Äôs influence on classical music. However, the piano is a truly multidisciplinary instrument with a big role in genres like blues, jazz, pop, and rock. So, we‚Äôve included piano terms here from as many musical genres as possible.\n\nüéπ Your Go-To Place for All Things Piano\n\nSubscribe to The Note for exclusive interviews, fascinating articles, and inspiring lessons delivered straight to your inbox. Unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHOW TO USE THIS PIANO TERMS GLOSSARY\n\nWe‚Äôve organized piano terms in alphabetical order in this glossary. You can also browse sections by clicking on topics in the Table of Contents above.\n\nIf you have a specific term in mind and are on desktop, press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) and then type in the term in question. Your computer will find the term and highlight it.\n\nHere‚Äôs how to do the same on mobile:\n\nARTICULATION\n\nPiano terms to do with how notes are played.\n\nAcciaccatura\n\nAn acciaccatura looks like a small note before a main note with a slash through it. Acciaccaturas are played briefly as a small, passing ornament that resolves to the main note. Unlike appoggiaturas, they are not played on the downbeat. Acciaccaturas and appoggiaturas are types of grace note.\n\nAppoggiatura\n\nAn appoggiatura looks like a small note before a main note. Appoggiaturas are brief ornaments that resolve toward the main note. Unlike acciaccaturas, appoggiaturas are played on the downbeat and get more emphasis, taking some of the note value away from the main note. Acciaccaturas and appoggiaturas are types of grace note.\n\nFermata\n\nA fermata resembles half a circle with a dot above or below a note or a rest. It indicates that the note should be held or sustained longer than its written value.\n\nGlissando\n\nA glissando looks like a squiggly line between two notes, indicating sliding from one note to the other.\n\nGrace note\n\nA grace note looks like a small note written right before a main one. Meant as an embellishment to the main note, it adds decorative flair and is typically performed quickly. Grace notes can be acciaccaturas or appoggiaturas.\n\nLegato\n\nPlay smoothly and connected.\n\nLeggiero\n\nPlay with a light touch.\n\nMordent\n\nMordents are ornamental markings that look like short squiggly lines above notes. They are played as short trills, with variations of the mordent indicating the direction of the trill:\n\nAn upper mordent is represented by a short squiggle with no line through it. It means to quickly alternate between the main note and the note above it.\n\nA lower mordent is represented by a short squiggle with a line through it. It means to quickly alternate between the main note and the note below it.\n\nSlur\n\nA slur is a curved line connecting two or more notes of different pitches, indicating that they should be played smoothly and without separation, creating a legato effect.\n\nStaccato\n\nA staccato is represented by a small dot above or below a note and indicates playing in a short, detached manner.\n\nTenuto\n\nTenuto indicates that a note should be sustained for its full duration, receiving full value. It is often represented by a horizontal line placed above or below the note and is used to emphasize a note.\n\nTie\n\nA tie is a curved line connecting two or more notes of the same pitch, indicating that their durations should be combined and played as a single note.\n\nTremolo\n\nTo tremolo means to play the note rapidly and tremolos are often used to build tension. A tremolo is indicated by diagonal lines or slashes drawn through the stem of the note having the tremolo, with the number of lines representing speed or intensity.\n\nTrill\n\nA trill is a rapid alternation between two adjacent notes. Trills are often represented by the letters ‚Äútr‚Äù above the note being trilled or by a long horizontal squiggly line.\n\nTurn\n\nA turn is represented by a sideways, S-shaped symbol above a note. It‚Äôs a quick ornamentation that involves rapidly playing the note above the main note, the main note, the note below, and back to the main note.\n\nDYNAMICS AND EXPRESSION\n\nWords to do with dynamics (loudness and softness) and expression.\n\nAccelerando\n\nGradually get faster.\n\nAdagio\n\nSlowly.\n\nCantabile\n\nIn a singing style.\n\nCon brio\n\n‚ÄúWith vigor.‚Äù\n\nCrescendo\n\nGradually get louder.\n\nDecrescendo\n\nGradually get softer.\n\nDiminuendo\n\nGradually get softer.\n\nFun fact: Schubert interpreted ‚Äúdiminuendo‚Äù as meaning to gradually get softer and slow down, while ‚Äúdecrescendo‚Äù for Schubert just meant to get softer.\n\nDolce\n\nSweetly.\n\nForte\n\nLoud.\n\nFortissimo\n\nVery loud; louder than forte.\n\nMezzo-forte\n\nModerately loud.\n\nMezzo-piano\n\nModerately soft.\n\nPianissimo\n\nVery soft; softer than piano.\n\nPiano\n\nSoft.\n\nFORM AND STRUCTURE\n\nTerms about a piece‚Äôs flow, form, and structure.\n\nA-A-A\n\nAlso called strophic form, each section is set to the same music in this structure.

You can also think of Locrian mode as starting and ending the major scale on the seventh degree.\n\nLydian mode\n\nLydian mode is a scale whose formula (based on the major scale) is 1-2-3-#4-5-6-7. You can also think of Lydian mode as starting and ending the major scale on the fourth degree.\n\n> Piano Scales: Types of Scales & How to Apply Them\n\nMediant\n\nThird note of the scale. The mediant of C major is E.\n\nMelodic minor\n\nThe melodic minor is a minor scale variation that raises the sixth and seventh degrees up one half step when ascending, but lowers them back down to the natural minor when descending.\n\nMixolydian mode\n\nMixolydian mode is a scale whose formula (based on the major scale) is 1-2-3-4-5-6-‚ô≠7. You can think of Mixolydian mode as starting and ending the major scale on the fifth degree.\n\nMode\n\nA mode is a scale with a specific pattern of whole and half steps that give it a distinct tonal character and mood.\n\n> Piano Scales: Types of Scales & How to Apply Them\n\nNatural\n\nThe natural symbol looks like a square with jutting sides. When placed before a note, it cancels any previous sharp or flat alterations, restoring the note to its natural, unaltered pitch.\n\nPassing tone\n\nA passing tone is a non-chord tone that connects two chord tones.\n\nPentatonic scale\n\nPentatonic scales are five-note scales. The major pentatonic scale consists of the major scale degrees 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. The minor pentatonic scale consists of the major scale degrees 1, ‚ô≠3, 4, 5, and ‚ô≠7.\n\nPhrygian mode\n\nPhrygian mode is a scale whose formula (based on the major scale) is 1-‚ô≠2-‚ô≠3-4-5-‚ô≠6-‚ô≠7. You can think of Phrygian mode as starting and ending the major scale on the third degree.\n\nRelative major/minor\n\nRelative major and minor scales share the same key signature but start and end on different notes and have different tonal centers.\n\nScale\n\nA scale is a sequence of musical pitches played in ascending or descending order, often following a specific pattern of whole and half steps.\n\n> Piano Scales: Types of Scales & How to Apply Them\n\nScale degree\n\nScale degree refers to the position of a note within a scale. For example, G is the fifth scale degree (or ‚Äúdominant‚Äù) in the C major scale.\n\nSecondary dominant\n\nA chord outside the key of a given piece, which is the dominant (V) chord of the chord it is resolving towards. For example, if our piece is in C major, the E7 in the following progression is a secondary dominant because it is the dominant 7th chord in the key of A.\n\nE7 ‚Äì Am ‚Äì C\n\nSharp\n\nRaise a note up by one half step.\n\nSubdominant\n\nFourth degree of the scale. F is the subdominant of C major.\n\nSubmediant\n\nSixth degree of the scale. A is the submediant of C major.\n\nSupertonic\n\nSecond degree of the scale. D is the supertonic of C major.\n\nTonal center\n\nThe tonal center is the main or central pitch within a piece or key. It serves as a point of stability, focus, and resolution. For example, the tonal center of a piece in C major or the C major scale is C.\n\nTonic\n\nFirst degree of the scale. C is the tonic of C major.\n\nTriad\n\nA triad is a three-note chord that consists of a root, third, and fifth.\n\nTritone\n\nAlso known as a diminished 5th or augmented 4th, a tritone is an interval of three whole steps. It‚Äôs often considered dissonant and unstable, and is commonly used to create tension in music.\n\nWhole tone / Whole step\n\nA ‚Äúwhole step‚Äù or ‚Äúwhole tone‚Äù is an interval that spans two half steps or two semitones. It is equivalent to the distance between two keys one key apart on the piano keyboard.\n\nüéπ Learn Piano For Free\n\nInspiring tutorials. Fascinating articles. Exclusive interviews.
