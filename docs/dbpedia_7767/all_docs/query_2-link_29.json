        "text": "godDAMN i could not have had a more awesome day.\n\ni just came home from a random surprise Melbourne dinner with fucking mike patton and the entire reunited Faith No More.\n\nall incredibly down-to-earth, inspiring guys. i sat next to roddy bottum and we had great talks about bands and music and what it’s like to leave and re-unite again.\n\nme & roddy:\n\nthey weren’t at the rally; they’re in town for their own shows & for soundwave (my nemesis festival!), but i literally bumped into a mutual pal (well, our promotor-in-common, michael gudinski, not SO random)\n\nand he invited me out with them.\n\nwe ate delicious vegetarian chinese….\n\n….my plans in life have officially collapsed. and you know what? i’m fucking fine with it.\n\nwhen huge street protests and vegetarian chinese dinners with amazing people call, you FUCKING GO. you GO.\n\nhonestly – my goal in hitting the studio in adelaide was to…i don’t know. make good things happen?\n\nsometimes your plans get fucked up and other things come about. so you make other good things happen.\n\nwho fucking cares. you leave your plans by the side of the street, festering in a pile. go, you go, you go.\n\nand then you blog about it and waste more time.\n\nYAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!\n\nand so\n\nsome great pictures form the rally. i took them all unless otherwise noted:\n\ni heard the count was over 70k people attended.\n\nit was so, so inspiring to see so many people in a city rally around a cause like this: keeping music thriving int he small club scene.\n\nnot every city would take up arms like this if it’s music scene came under threat from lame liquor licensing.\n\nseriously. would yours?\n\nyou can feel the pulse of this city,it beats with art and love.\n\nthat is why i love it here so much.\n\nhere’s a wee lass hanging out in the bar before we marched:\n\nrandom hot background blonde: paris wells.\n\nthe gathering crowd below….\n\n(photo by justin from The Age)\n\nthe march.\n\nbehind me, the guys from the Drones, next to me, angie hart and missy higgins:\n\n(photo by mark burban. lifted from http://www.flickr.com/photos/giveaphuk/4381823674/)\n\namanda fucking palmer photographs the press:\n\nbest. clown. ever.\n\nthe uber-awesome paul kelly, one of my songwriting heroes, in front of parliament…\n\nthe crowd in front of parliament….\n\nwhen we finished the march and took to the parliament steps for the speeches, i found myself standing next to a handsome gentleman i didn’t recognize.\n\nhe told me he’d heard of the dresden dolls and liked our music and was happy to meet me.\n\nthen he told me he was fucking MICK HARVEY from nick cave & the bad seeds.\n\ni almost shit a brick.\n\ni own tons of his records and have just never known exactly what he looked like.\n\ni tried to make amends and would have prostrated myself in *worship worship* stance on the parliament stairs if there hadn’t been all those thousands of australians watching.\n\nMICK HARVEY. gaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.\n\nthe speeches touched on the really important fundamentals, and i found my head bobbing in agreement constantly.\n\nthe basic, overarching theme: MUSIC IS FOOD FOR THE HUMAN SOUL.\n\nit needs to exist in little, fertile places, not just huge, soulless arenas.\n\nif i may run with this metaphor: small music clubs are the kitchens of musician culture, where our souls get baked.\n\nas paul kelly put it (more or less): there are no rule books for being a musician.\n\ninstead: the small clubs, bars and venues are our universities.\n\na-fucking-men.\n\nthe speeches:\n\njonnie von go from RRR JVG radio, the Rockwiz BAND, paul kelly, missy higgins, angie hart.\n\nfootage from this speech, and some cool random clips of protesters HERE.\n\nan awesome t-shirt, if i do say so myself…\n\nand a song to match…..\n\ni did a mini-ninja gig right after the rally in a hidden nook and someone requested “sing”, which i’ve never learned on uke.\n\nluckily three people busted out their own ukes and started playing it.\n\nand we SANG…all together now.\n\nand there was this little peanut of a fan…\n\nphoto by rebecca dickson\n\ni can kind of die happy today. i will sleep like a rock."
