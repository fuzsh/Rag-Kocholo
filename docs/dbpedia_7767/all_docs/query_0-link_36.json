        "text": "Faith No More‘s return to touring this year doesn’t mean they’ll be back with new music. The band’s keyboardist Roddy Bottum recently told Kerrang! of that:\n\n“You know, there’s no plans right now to record any new music, there’s no plans at all. I think we’re all at an age, or at a time in our lives, where looking back at what we’ve done is a profound place to be. I’m super-proud of what we’ve done in a way that I haven’t been before. I think maybe some years ago it did feel a little bit dirty, like we were taking advantage of the world by just going out there and playing old songs, but for whatever reason I’m in a different place with that right now.\n\nI think our legacy speaks for itself in the way the world is right now. It’s refreshing and it’s appropriately provocative to throw ourselves into the world again. It’s a good example of eccentric leftism, if you will.”\n\nThe group are currently booked for a number of European and UK festivals this year after having last hit the stage back in 2016. The band returned with their first new album in nearly twenty years back in 2015 with “Sol Invictus“. While Bottum himself previously mentioned work was underway on a follow-up, it would appear that those sessions have fizzled out for now. Bottum further told Kerrang! of their return:\n\n“I think all of us were at the point collectively where we felt like what we had done five years ago in reforming, and the subsequent recording and touring of that recording [‘Sol Invictus‘], was an unfinished task. There were places that we didn’t go, things we didn’t do, and ways that we would have liked to perform but hadn’t. The option to do it again was still there, but it kind of took us a while to get our head around how we wanted to do it, and what the impetus for going forward was.”\n\nThe band’s current dates include:\n\n06/10 Manchester, UK – O2 Apollo (tickets)\n\n06/11 Glasgow, UK – O2 Academy (tickets)\n\n06/13 Punchestown, IRE – Sunstroke Festival\n\n06/15 Birmingham, UK – Birmingham Academy (tickets)\n\n06/16 London, UK – O2 Academy Brixton (tickets)\n\n06/17 London, UK – O2 Academy Brixton (tickets)\n\n06/19 Dessel, BEL – Graspop Metal Meeting (tickets)\n\n06/20 Clisson, FRA – Hellfest Open Air (Tickets)\n\n06/26 Oslo, NOR – Tons Of Rock\n\n06/28 Helsinki, FIN – Tuska Open Air\n\n07/07 Werchter, BEL – Rock Werchter\n\n07/10 Lisbon, POR – NOS Alive\n\n07/11 Madrid, SPA – Mad Cool Festival (Tickets)\n\nTheprp.com may receive a commission from tickets purchased through the links in the above post."
