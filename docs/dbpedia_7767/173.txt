Roddy Bottum of Faith No More is taking advantage of the global pandemic to release some of his queerest work yet.

The musician, best known as the keyboardist for the San Francisco alternative metal band, revealed that he’s been working on music with his boyfriend Joey Holman.

Roddy Bottum is releasing lockdown music with his boyfriend.

The project, aptly titled MAN ON MAN, is apparently set to feature the track “Daddy”.

He tweeted: “We’ve talked about projects in quarantine, y’all n [sic] me.

“I’m happy to announce that me and Joey’s record is finished and we’ll release our first single, ‘Daddy’, next week. We’re calling it MAN ON MAN. Love yous.”

Faith No More musician: Coming out in 1993 was a ‘provocative statement’.

The musician came out back in 1993 in an interview with The Advocate.

In an interview with Kerrang! earlier this year, he reflected: “I certainly did feel that the rock community was a tolerant place when I came out. But the rock community was not why I made that gesture – in fact, it was the least of my worries.

“It was more important for me to make that statement and make that gesture for the gay community and for the unrecognised people of that time. Back then, Judas Priest’s Rob Halford wasn’t even out of the closet.

“My statement was a provocative statement for the straight world in general, but more important to me was the fact that it needed to be said for the gay community, for my community. It needed to be said, and to be heard as a way of signifying gratitude and compassion for my people.”
