When she loves for the very first time, she loves with her heart and soul and we aren’t sure if it’s the only time she would ever feel that away..again..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHow Adele eats, is also how she loves.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHe her appetite for food is symbolic of her undying love for Emma, how much she desires her, how much she can’t get enough of her, and how much she’ll always want her.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAdele is naivee, young, and honest. When she first came into the bar, hoping to run into Emma and when she did, you can see her anxiety and feel her nervousness.\n\nWhen Emma first called her at home, you could tell how ecstatic, but very shy and timid at the same time and not sure what to think of it.\n\n.\n\nAdele became a source of inspiration for Emma as she became her muse. Adele would only pose for Emma, would only cook for Emma because Emma is her source of happiness, her world, her EVERYTHING. Her investment is in EMMA ONLY.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAdele’s insecurities started at the party she worked so hard to perfection for Emma and the result was Emma flirting with Elise ..\n\n.\n\nand leaving her alone to to host Emma’s friends.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAt the party, Emma tells her friends that Adele is a great writer\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand at night, tried to tell Adele she should trying writing and explore that side of her because she feels Adele won’t be completely fulfilled.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBUT Adele is extremely fulfilled and happy because Emma is her happiness.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEmma is not convinced she can be completely happy by just teaching and going home to cook and clean for her.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe shows her frustration when Adele said she was hurt that Emma kept insisting and didn’t want to make love to her that night.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAdele asks Emma if Lise was her ex…Emma said no, she’s a painter as well..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNights of being lonely because Emma is not home when Adele gets home at night…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEmma is not around to pay attention to her so she turns to the closest source for attention, her co-worker who shows interest in her for a while…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe cheated on Emma because she was lonely.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEmma was neglecting her, physically and emotionally.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe only did it because she was lonely.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe doesn’t love the guy.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe never meant to hurt Emma.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe doesn’t know why she did it. Her fear of losing Emma and loneliness let her to infidelity. This when when she realized the consequences of her action.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAdele had no idea it was coming..so soon, so fast, so sudden. Her world shattered in matter of minutes, her heart was torn into pieces.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe wander aimlessly in the dark street, shocked from what happened and completely lost and heart broken.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDuring her 3 years after being thrown out by Emma, she can’t enjoy anything that she used to, like teaching her kids and all she could feel was pain\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPAIN\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand more pain..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAdele tries to keep herself busy and go out..but she’s still very alone..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe has nightmares of Emma and Lise having sex (this is from a deleted scene) and is unable to sleep at night..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe has a hard time getting attached to people\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis is her last intimate meeting with Emma…and we see that both suffered but Emma has moved on and wouldn’t take Adele back, even though she has’ infinite tenderness for her, all her life long.’\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis was Adele’s ending…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI feel that it’s better to have NO HOPE than to have some hope and nothing comes out of it…\n\n.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n.\n\nTHIS REALLY HELPS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND ADELE’S CHARACTER.\n\n.\n\nsource: http://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/topic/5143411/1085/\n\nQuestion/comment: “i can’t believe this guy asked her to eat all the time. weird obsession. what for?”\n\nKechiche does multiple takes, so Adele had to keep eating for all the shots. The point of these shots (and constant references to her mouth) is that these scenes are a metaphor for desire. Emma notes that Adele is ravenous. Adele says even when she is full, she can’t get enough. Adele is youthful and everything about her and her desires are overpowering and “too much”, one of several reasons her relationship with Emma is ill-fated. When they first meet, Emma foreshadows and observes “With you, it’s all or nothing”. This is what is great about Adele and also her fatal character flaw if you will. She can’t do things in moderation, she has an insatiable appetite. For food, for sex, for love. Emma is a free spirit. She doesn’t like to box herself in and spreads herself thin. She loves Adele but also has friends and hobbies. Adele exists solely for Emma and the attention she craves from her. When she doesn’t get it, she cheats. Not because she doesn’t love Emma, but because she is an all-or-nothing person and can’t handle that Emma’s life isn’t constantly revolving exclusively around her and she feels lonely because this is an insecurity. Emma mentions she should develop hobbies, Adele notes that her happiness derives from Emma, something Emma has mixed feelings about – also because Adele can’t exist in the same social circles and world Emma lives in. The shots of her eating spaghetti have multiple purposes. To showcase her overflowing and endless desire – she doesn’t just eat the spaghetti but also licks the silverware, her fingers – she can’t get enough and doesn’t feel full. Even if Emma could give her 150% of her time and energy, it probably wouldn’t suffice for Adele still, she is so passionate. She does everything with intensity, from her emotions and feelings to sex. She wants ALL of everything and is discovering her desires and herself, as she is naive and this is her first love, she doesn’t yet have the maturity or wisdom to moderate, something older Emma has more of a handle on. The spaghetti scene is also crucial because it showcases another reason this couple is doomed – social inequality (a theme of Kechiche’s films). The food is a clue that Adele comes from a working class background, spaghetti is inexpensive and plentiful – it is consequently the dish she also serves to Emma’s bourgois friends. Emma’s family comes from money and they eat oysters (also metaphoric of sexual innuendo and Emma’s androgynous characteristics – clams can be masculine and feminine and change sex or be both). The food is a clue as to where the family comes from and the dinner scenes showcase the family dynamics and how different the worlds these two grew up in are. No shot is pointless, even if on the surface it appears to be. All media are intentional constructions, delivered with an intended purpose.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nCOMMENT: “It’s actually kind of a ridiculous scene and not sexy at all. If someone slobbered on my hand like that, I would wonder what the hell is wrong with them.”\n\nThis scene plays into the ultimate desperation and “all or nothing” mode is part of Adele’s character (above, spaghetti scene post). Adele is so consumed with emotion and loss, she can’t rationalize. She admits in this scene it is beyond her control. She wants Emma so badly she doesn’t have a sense of time or space or even caring where she is or who is around. She has that insatiable appetite, and her mouth is metaphoric for desire, she just wants to feel and taste Emma and there doesn’t seem to be another way to have her inside of her. I didn’t perceive it as ridiculous but as ultimately so profoundly sad. You realize how much she made Emma her world and how much Emma truly meant to her. This is part of young love, this notion that the end of a relationship is the end of the world, she can’t find moderation or comfort. Some people have suggested this scene is unrealistic. I disagree. People do shocking and desperate things during moments of profound loss, I have seen it. From smashing someone’s car window in because they couldn’t be with someone to shocking words or acts. Something happened to me once in a crowded restaurant by a person I was in love with and I totally didn’t expect it and let’s just leave it to your imagination but it’s the kind of thing that could find it’s way into a movie and people still wouldn’t believe it. Art imitates life. You’d be surprised what someone who feels they have lost their universe will do. Love can be a very powerful ally but also produce irrational thoughts and reactions, it’s part of that reptilian brain. That whole scene felt so utterly honest and heartbreaking to me.\n\nhttp://www.filmjunkies.de/news/blau-warme-farbe-interview-adle-56160.html\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nGerman interview with Adele E ON WHY SHE THINKS THEY BROKE UP AND WHY ADELE CHEATED\n\nSource: http://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/topic/5143411/1206/\n\nInteresting bits from the interview:\n\nWaren es denn wirklich die sozialen Unterschiede, die Adèles und Emmas Beziehung zerstört haben?\n\nViele denken das. Und auch Abdel ist dieser Meinung. Ich denke da etwas anders. Natürlich haben die Unterschiede mit dazu beigetragen, aber für mich ist es ein Problem der Kommunikation und der Einsamkeit. Mein Charakter wollte schon immer Lehrerin werden und ist sehr glücklich mit dieser Wahl. Aber Emma denkt nicht, dass dies das beste für sie ist. Sie verurteilt diesen Traum etwas. Adèle schmeißt den Haushalt für eine Frau, die vor ihr mit einem anderen Mädchen flirtet. Ich würde das niemals tun. Aber Adèle bleibt. Sie glaubt, dass es irgendwann besser wird. Und Emma war sehr eigennützig meiner Meinung nach. Sie ist Künstlerin und glaubt, sie sei unabhängig, was sie natürlich nicht ist. Die Dialoge in der Trennungsszene waren zum Beispiel komplett improvisiert und mir fiel nur ein, dass ich wirklich einsam war. Ja, ich habe dich betrogen, aber ich war so einsam. Selbst im selben Haus, im selben Bett war ich einfach zu einsam. Du warst nicht mehr für mich da. […] Und nach der Trennung kann sie nicht mehr zu ihren Eltern, weil sie einfach alles für dieses Mädchen aufgegeben hat.\n\nWas it really the social differences that have destroyed Adèle and Emma’s relationship?\n\nMany people think so. And also Abdel is of this opinion. I’m thinking something different. Of course the differences have contributed to it, but for me it is a problem of communication and loneliness.\n\nMy character has always wanted to be a teacher and is very happy with this choice.\n\n.\n\nBut Emma does not think that this is the best for her.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nShe condemns this dream a bit. Adèle manages the household for a woman who flirts in front of her with another girl.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI would never do that. But Adèle remains. She believes that it will get better eventually. And Emma was very selfish in my opinion. She is an artist and believes she is independent (self-contained/unattached), which she is not of course. The dialogues in the break-up scene were, for example, completely improvised, and it only occurred to me that I was really lonely. Yes, I have cheated on you, but I was so lonely. Even in the same house, in the same bed I was just too lonely. You were no longer there for me. […] And after the break-up, she can no longer go to her parents because she has given up everything for this girl\n\n.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n.\n\nhttp://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/topic/5143411/1677/\n\nMy minority opinion is that Adele took the the blame for their relationship failing (I’m not saying Emma hurt and suffer less though).\n\nEmma was already (subconciously) waiting for an excuse to break up with Adele because of irreconcilable differences in character she realized during the party. When they first talked about art and philosophy at the park bench, these were the early ‘warning signs’ that Adele is out of Emma’s league. But Adele is still young, and Emma is older. And it’s easy blindside these things in early stages of love.\n\nEven at cafe reconciliation, as with the breakup scene, Emma chooses not to address her part of their breakup, while Adele says she can pay in flesh and blood. Emma’s internal conflict here is tremendous, she tries so very hard and struggles to explain her part of blame in their breakup but chooses in the end to just tell Adele that she doesnt love her anymore, instead of telling Adele she’s not ‘good enough’ for her. Because either way she can’t avoid hurting the other.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSource: mypublicdiary07\n\nWhy Do People Cheat?"
