        "text": "Comedy helps contribute to social change when done in the right way\n\nComedy can play an important role in challenging people to address critical social issues, says Lauren Feldman, associate professor at Rutgers’ School of Communication and Information.\n\nThe co-author of A Comedian and an Activist Walk into a Bar: The Serious Role of Comedy in Social Justice says media and technological disruption – combined with newly invigorated calls for justice – have created the ideal conditions for boundary-pushing, socially critical, comedy to not only thrive in the entertainment marketplace but also play a strategic role in efforts to call attention to global poverty, climate change, immigration, racial justice and sexual assault.\n\nFeldman discusses how comedy and shows like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Black-ish can be used in serious advocacy work to confront injustice.\n\nWhy is comedy a misunderstood vehicle for serious public engagement?\n\nPeople often incorrectly assume that comedy – because it is funny and entertaining – is inappropriate for communicating about serious issues, or that it can serve as a distraction from important problems. However, our research shows that it is precisely because comedy is funny and entertaining that it is capable of engaging and motivating people around challenging issues. Comedy pulls people in and creates a positive emotional connection, which can, in turn, inspire engagement and action. More recently, digital-era mediated comedy – including satirical news, sitcoms, sketch, stand-up, and funny documentaries – has served as a powerful influencer in contemporary social justice issues.\n\nHow can it help shape social justice movements?\n\nComedy can, through its effects on audiences, help contribute to social change by drawing attention, disarming audiences, lowering resistance to persuasion, breaking down social barriers and stimulating sharing and discussion. In addition to its effects on individuals, comedy also can have broader cultural effects, shaping news coverage and social media discourse, providing visibility to alternative ideas and marginalized groups, and serving as a resource for collective action. Given comedy’s potential for social influence, activists and advocacy organizations are increasingly using it in their strategic communication efforts.\n\nCan you provide an example of how this can be done appropriately?\n\nRise is an organization that advocates for civil rights protections for sexual assault survivors. Amanda Nguyen founded the organization, after she survived a sexual assault at Harvard and was appalled at the challenges she faced in navigating the criminal justice system. In 2016, Nguyen partnered with Funny or Die to create a sketch comedy video that exposed the absurdity of existing sexual assault laws. The video was designed to promote a new bill in the Senate called the “Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights Act.” It drove more than 100,000 signatures to a Change.org petition in support of the legislation, which Rise delivered to Congress to show public demand. The bill ended up passing unanimously at the federal level and was signed into law by President Obama in October 2016. Nguyen attributed this success, in part, to the attention driven to the issue by the comedy sketch. Rise went on to partner with Funny or Die on a second comedy videoin 2017 to launch the organization’s state-level campaign, and on a third video in 2018 to launch their international work with the United Nations and respond to the #MeToo movement.\n\nWhat have you seen during the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought into stark relief how much we need humor during crises. Comedy brings people together by highlighting our common experiences – for example, every funny social distancing meme or video reminds us that other people are going through similar things and can provide optimism and solidarity. Comedy about the crisis also reminds us that what is happening right now isn’t normal and shouldn’t be normal, and that can help motivate us to take action and do our part. Of course, as we argue, comedy also provides a powerful form of critique. For example, comedians like Trevor Noah (The Daily Show), John Oliver (Last Week Tonight), and Hasan Minhaj (Patriot Act) have been providing critical information and perspectives about the pandemic, calling out misinformation and holding leaders accountable.\n\nWhat are actionable recommendations for people who want to use comedy in their efforts to improve the world?"
