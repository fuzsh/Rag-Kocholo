They represented an extraordinary and potent cross-fertilization of American and European cultures, creating their own superstar - Clint Eastwood - and revitalizing the careers of a posse of western veterans such as Lee Van Cleef and Guy Madison. Like some of Sergio Leone's best-known films, Christopher Frayling's scholarly study of the Spaghetti Western, first published in 1981, has now achieved classic status. For years it has been cited as a seminal work and second-hand copies have been at a premium. We are delighted to be able to reprint it as part of a policy of making available again important critical texts. Frayling took seriously a genre which many at the time dismissed\n\nVI\n\nas at best a bastardization and at worst a perversion of the Hollywood Western. He combines detailed readings of individual films with an analysis of the production context and of the then little-known tradition of European westerns in literature and film. He explores the social and political dimensions of the spaghettis as well as their distinctive cinematicity. He examines the landscape, the costumes, the music, the acting, the violence. He has contributed a new introduction bringing his thinking on the genre up to date, correcting errors and looking back at the intellectual milieu which produced the book in the first place. Beautifully illustrated and stylishly written, this study makes a welcome return to the cinema bookshelves.

I would also like to thank the participants in a joint Exeter and Warwick Universities Conference on Cultural Responses to Mexico, with whom I had many interesting discussions; the Italian Society at the University of Bath (who listened); and\n\nex-Professor Christopher Cornford of the Department of General Studies at the Royal College of Art (who allowed me to lecture on the subject): all these experiences helped clarify my ideas. I hope they still seem clear. My aim throughout has been, if possible, to enhance the reader's appreciation of these movies, rather than simply to exploit it. The stills reproduced in this book first appeared in films distributed by the following companies, to whom thanks are due: Avco Embassy, Columbia, Gala, Golden Era, MGM, Miracle, Paramount, Toho, 20th Century-Fox, United Artists, Universal, Warner, and especially Rafran (Rome).

The following day we all went on an inland tour of Italian Western locations, walked down the cobbled main street of the tiny village of Los Albaricoques where the final sequences of For a Few Dollars More were filmed – our shoes made a scrunching sound which was exactly right – and looked in on 'Mini Hollywood', designer Carlo Simi's town of El Paso, sturdily built for the second 'Dollars' film in 1965 and still in expanded form a tourist attraction. Since then, there have been several Spanish-language television documentaries about Almeria during the Western boom, and in 2002 a Spanish feature film called 800 Balas/ 800 Bullets (directed by Alex de la Iglesia) told the story of the last stand of a bunch of film extras working in Almeria who hadn't moved with the times since the mid-1960s: at the fadeout, the Man With No Name comes to the funeral of their leader, to pay his last respects. In 1998, I noted how much the reputation of Italian Westerns had changed since the late 1970s when I wrote Spaghetti Westerns - Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone. And since 1998, there have been even more changes. As I write, the 49th London Film Festival is showcasing a new print of Sergio Corbucci's Il Grande Silenzio/The Great Silence (1969), restored by Munich Film Museum from a negative belonging to a German co–producer. Broadcasts of Sergio Leone's Westerns on television regularly earn the maximum five stars in accompanying film guides. DVD versions of Italian Westerns – sometimes with trailers, voiceovers, documentaries and stills galleries as extras – are issued often: a better-than-usual print of Sergio Sollima's La Resa dei Conti/The Big Gundown, with subtitles, from Germany; a series of box sets, under the generic title 'Macaroni Western', from Japan; A Fistful of Trailers vols i and ii from the United States. A book\n\ncalled Il Western all'ltaliana by Alberto Castagna and Maurizio Graziosi has just arrived – revealing that A Fistful of Dollars was at one brief stage to have been released as Sfida a Texas City/Duel in Texas City, with Sergio Leone hiding under the pseudonym Daniel P. Lion; that the screenplay was submitted to the Italian Ministero dello Spettacolo in January 1964 under three titles Il magnifico straniero/The Magnificent Stranger, Sputafuoco Joe and Texas Joe; and that A Fistful of Dollars did not open at a Florentine fleapit in September 1964 – as the legend has told – but at the Supercinema there ('home of the biggest spectaculars') under the headline 'the most recent and sensational of the Western films, with the new American idol'. This Italian study follows hot on the heels of Howard Hughes's Once Upon a Time in the Italian West and the same author's Pocket Essential Guide to Spaghetti Westerns (a title which really has caught on). The loving scholarship devoted to these films is becoming more and more detailed, and the available primary documentation is swelling every year. Italian Westerns are probably more fashionable worldwide in 2005 than their American counterparts – the films, the music, the look, the clothes, the irony. In 2005, I co-curated a major exhibition of props, costumes (including the poncho), firearms, designs, scripts, posters, clips, records and interviews called 'Once upon a time in Italy – the Westerns of Sergio Leone' at the Autry Museum of the American West, Glendale Los Angeles. At the opening, I was asked why a European film-maker should be celebrated in such style in a major Museum which is devoted to the American West. I replied that one of Gene Autry's signature tunes 'South of the Border/Down Mexico Way' was written by two British composers – one from Co. Armagh – who'd blagged their way into an Autry concert in Dublin in 1939 and handed him the song. A little-known example of a 'European Western'. When they used the phrase 'South of the Border', the songwriters could just as well have been referring to Dublin... There have been a few festivals more, as well, attended by a growing band of fans and scholars many IX\n\nX\n\nPREFACE (2005)\n\nof whom weren't even born when Euro-Westerns were first released. At the Montpellier Film Festival in 1998 I sat on a discussion panel with Carla Leone, designer Carlo Simi, and cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli (who referred to me as 'the professor' throughout – it was not intended as a compliment). At Madonna di Campiglio – where Victor Mature was born – in 2001 I sat on another discussion panel, this time with actors Giuliano Gemma (Ringo), Gianni Garko (Sartana) and Eli Wallach (Tuco) who informed a packed audience that although he was now of an age where he could no longer get on a horse and was reduced to playing Mafia Dons and elderly Rabbis, he still looked back on 'The Ugly' as a highpoint of his career; maybe he would have inscribed on his gravestone the words 'Here lies the Ugly'. Wallach has subsequently published his autobiography The Good, The Bad and Me and his friend Micky Knox (who created the English-language versions of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West) has published The Good, The Bad and the Dolce Vita, with a preface by Norman Mailer, who wrote one of the drafts of Once upon a Time in America. Knox was blacklisted in the 1950s and the role of left-wing American expatriates in the making of some ItalianSpanish Westerns in the 1960s would make an interesting study in itself. At Taormina in 2002 during a Sergio Leone Festival which launched the Italian version of my biography Sergio Leone – something to do with death, on yet another panel I had the chance to talk with director Franco Giraldi (who ran the second unit on Fistful), Dario Argento (who contributed to the treatment of Once Upon a Time in the West, and went on to cowrite among others Cemetery without Crosses and The Five Man Army before becoming the Sergio Leone of Italian horror films), Andrea Crisanti (designer of A Fistful of Dynamite) and Tonino Delli Colli again – who told me that the trouble with film critics was that they\n\ntreated films as if they were made by Pablo Picasso: 'painting with light? I just try to put the lights in the right place!'. Both Carlo Simi and Tonino Delli Colli have died since the last edition of this book. The text of Spaghetti Westerns has not been updated, though the Preface of 1998 included some new information and a list of corrections. One error which I did not mention in 1998 was brought home forcefully to me when, following a tip-off, I drove to see the remains of a brick Roman arch which survives just to the north of Monument Valley on the road towards Mexican Hat. To judge by the number of broken bottles and crushed cans decorating the site, Carlo Simi's arch from Once upon a Time in the West has become the party location of choice for itinerant bikers. When I wrote Spaghetti Westerns, I was convinced that the flashbacks in Once Upon a Time were shot in a studio against a large backdrop. They look as though they were but I can now vouch for the fact that the light really does look as artificial as that just north of Monument Valley in May. I am delighted that this book has somehow achieved – in Jeffrey Richards' generous words – 'classic status' over the last quarter of a century; scarcely a month goes by without a Masters or Doctoral student writing to me about it. Questions of 'the politics of identity', 'images of masculinity', 'cinema in developing countries', 'the western and gender', 'hybrid cultures' and 'the distinctiveness (or not) of European films' have become intellectually fashionable and Italian Westerns seem to provide fascinating case studies for discussions of all of them. I hope, though, that the text continues to appeal to the fan base – as well as to film scholars –just as it did way back in 1981.\n\nChristopher Frayling October 2005\n\nPreface (1998)\n\nAt the end of April 1997, I was invited to join a panel of speakers at an international Festival of Eurowestern which took place in a cinema next to a railway station in Udine, near Venice. The other panellists at the festival included Horst Wendlandt (who produced the best of the Karl May Winnetou films in the mid-1960s), Gojko Mitic (who played a succession of noble Indian chiefs in East German historical epics of the 1970s, and who now plays Winnetou the Warrior at the annual Karl May Festspiele at Bad Segeberg), Tonino Valerii (who was Sergio Leone's assistant before directing My Name Is Nobody), Joaquin Romero Marchent (whose career in Spanish Westerns began with El Coyote in 1954 and ended with the notoriously bloody Cut-Throats Nine in 1973), Luis Enrique Bacalov (the Buenos Aires born composer of soundtracks for Django, Sugar Colt, Quien Sabe?, The Price of Power and others), Tinto Brass (director of the over-the-topgothic Yankee), Enzo Castellari (director of the stylish and anti-racist Keoma) and Franco Nero (best known in this context for his performance as Django and as Polish/Swedish mercenaries in Sergio Corbucci's political Westerns), plus two young scholars of the Italian Western Luca Beatrice (author of Al cuore, Ramon, al cuore/Aim for the Heart, Ramon – an art historical analysis) and Carlos Aguilar (author of a Spanish analysis of the films of Sergio Leone). Which just about covered the territory. The climax of the festival was a screening of five Lumière fragments of 1896 and some Joe Hamman French Westerns of 1912, accompanied by Bacalov on the piano. At one point, he played variations on The Good, the Bad & the Ugly. There was also an evening of British Westerns pre-1913 (including two produced by Cecil Hepworth), but I had to leave before then. Discussion wasn't easy: the many languages which were spoken in that railroad cinema resembled the babel of sound on the set of an\n\ninternational Western of thirty years before. But it was certainly animated. In my panel session (called, alarmingly, Faccia A Faccia), the first question from the floor concerned the title of this book. Wasn't the phrase 'Spaghetti Westerns' – which the book had made famous, said the speaker, and launched into the public domain in Europe – an insult to Italian film-makers? A phrase, like 'Pizza Express' and 'Burger King', which implied junk food, mass-production and a total lack of individuality? A phrase which had led to countless jokes about 'heavy on the bolognaise' and thus encouraged a flip attitude to \"a significant Euro-contribution to film history\". Perhaps I would care to explain what thoughts the phrase conjured up in my mind – for the benefit of the assembled film buffs, most of whom were Italian, under thirtyfive, and had never seen these films on the big screen before. I replied that Sergio Leone himself had once told me that he, too, had been unsure whether or not the phrase was intended as a put-down: so unsure that he delayed reading this book for a while (or rather, delayed having it read to him by a long-suffering and bilingual assistant in 1981–2) because he feared from the title that it might be patronising and condescending – like the earliest reviews of his films in Europe and America. But Leone had come to realize that the phrase 'Spaghetti Westerns' could, in fact, be a term of endearment. Originally, he said, he had taken its meaning too literally: \"I thought it was quite subtle – maybe the spaghetti had replaced the lassoo\". Then he realized that the word 'Spaghetti' was simply being used as a synonym for 'Italian': \"Like today, when we talk of 'Pizza Connection'; today, though, Spaghetti is out of fashion – no? Pizza is in. But there was nothing malicious about the phrase. Just a way of defining national origins, taken up by the Americans. It was some Europeans who took this label in a XI\n\nXII\n\nPREFACE (1998)\n\ncritical spirit to stigmatise an entire genre. It's crazy. As if one were to criticise American films set in ancient Rome by calling them 'Hamburger Romans'. I've never heard Spartacus or Ben-Hur referred to as 'Hamburger Romans'. Have you?\" Actually, the term 'Spaghetti Western' was often used as a pejorative in America in the 1960s and 1970s, meaning \"not at all like the real thing\". But it was this book which persuaded Leone that 'Spaghetti Westerns' need not necessarily be a put-down. True, Leone was still keen to distance his work from rotgut Spaghettis – \"when they tell me that I am the father of the Spaghetti Western\", he once said to me through a haze of cigar smoke, \"I have to reply 'how many sons of bitches do you think I have spawned?'\" – but he accepted that, until the craze got completely out of hand in the late 1960s, there were interesting things to be said and written about at least some of them; the legitimate ones, rather than the \"products of the great gold rush which followed Fistful of Dollars\". I then quoted, for the benefit of the audience at Eurowestern, from Professor René Konig's sociological study of fashion The Restless Image (1973), where he had had this to say about Spaghetti as a type of food: \"It originated in the East; it is now a food known throughout the world that has spread far beyond the borders of Italy. It even changed its function as it did so: to begin with it was a typical poor man's food; today, particularly outside Italy, it has become a symbol of sophisticated cuisine, and is a popular speciality\". Fistful of Dollars, too, originated in the East – with Kurosawa's Yojimbo – and the resulting gold rush of between four hundred and four hundred and fifty films had indeed \"spread far beyond the borders of Italy\": originally treated as typical poor man's cinema (especially if the poor man happened to come from south of Rome), it had since become a symbol of... well, not quite sophistication, but let us say innovative and sometimes fascinating and exciting film-making while remaining a popular speciality. So, 'Spaghetti Westerns' was more apt than it looked. Enough said? The questioner seemed happier. But there were\n\nstill a few murmurs of discontent from around the Cinema Ferroviario. There were, incidentally, no Americans present so far as I could tell. What struck me most forcibly about this exchange and indeed about the whole Festival – apart from the fact that I had never shared a cinema with hundreds of Eurowestern buffs before – was just how much had changed since I wrote Spaghetti Westerns way back in the late 1970s. Young scholars all over Europe now write learned monographs about the Italian or Italian-Spanish Western boom of the 1960s, or deconstruct Karl May's novels and the films derived from them (Old Shatterhand ritt nicht im Auftrag der Arbeiterklasse, by Christian Heermann, 1995, and Karl May im Film by Christian Unucka, 1980), or analyse the East German epics of the 1970s (Gojko Mitic, mustangs, marterphäle by Frank-Burkhard Habel, 1997). And they turn to this book – as I learned to my surprise at Eurowestern – for intellectual stimulus; it has become the text that launched a thousand theses – the text which 'founded' the serious study of Eurowesterns as Italian or Spanish or German phenomena rather than ersatz American ones. Websites are full of unacknowledged chunks of it. The growth of research in this area has opened up some interesting new questions, to which Spaghetti Westerns did not and could not supply the answers. Like, what was the role of Spanish expertise/ directors/precursors in the making of 'Italian Westerns'? Many of these films were in fact Spanish co-productions, most of them had Spanish desert locations, while a significant number were wholly Spanish even though they've been subsumed under the wrong generic title. This book concentrates on the Italian production context. And what of the contribution of the pioneering films of Joaquin Romero Marchent? The town of 'San Miguel' in Fistful of Dollars was originally built for one of his Zorro movies. Carlos Aguilar has begun to research this topic, but there is still much basic fact-finding to be done. Another question: what of the distinction between films pitched at 'third run' cinemas in Italy, and those – such as the bigger budget Leones, Corbuccis, Tessaris and Sollimas – which played at 'first run' cinemas in the big cities? The distinction seems to go well beyond the size of the budget and the eminence of the stars. Christopher Wagstaff (in the essay A Fistful of Westerns – a contribution to Popular European Cinema, ed. Dyer & Vincendeau, 1992) has mapped out a fascinating study of\n\nPREFACE (1998) XIII\n\naudiences in 1960s Italy – which partly reinforces my conclusions, partly shows how I tended to approach these different 'levels' of film-making in different ways rather than analysing and revealing how the 'levels' really operated. Your average low-budget Spaghetti played to audiences which went to the pictures several times a week, talked through the boring bits, enjoyed plenty of action and noise, liked heroes who dressed in style and smoked a lot of toscani cigars, were accustomed to an arbitrary intermission while the projectionist changed reels, and unless captivated by a surprise ending liked to walk out before the end. This sociology of cinema-going helps to explain at least some of the recurring features of the films themselves. Franco Nero speculated in a 1993 interview that \"Spaghetti Westerns were for a certain kind of audience – the workers, I think. Mainly workers, boys . .. yes, all kinds of workers – and the workers they fantasize a lot, and they would like to go to the boss in the office and be the hero and say 'Sir, from today, something's gonna happen'. And then – bam, bam! they want to clean up the whole world\". He was probably right. In this sense, the Italian Westerns hark back to the era of silent movies in America, or 'B' movies of the 1930s, when films made direct contact with similar audiences (in the city and the country), and when the horse did as much thinking as the itinerant cowboy. There have, since the publication of Spaghetti Westerns, been further full-length studies of the films of Sergio Leone and especially the Westerns – from Italy (Sergio Leone by Oreste de Fornari, 1984; Sergio Leone by Francesco Mininni, 1989; Directed by Sergio Leone by Gianni di Claudio, 1990; Sergio ' Leone by Roberto Lasagna, 1996); from France (Sergio Leone by Gilles Cèbe, 1984; Leone by Gilles Gressard, 1989); and from America (Film Semiotics, Metz and Leone's trilogy by Lane Roth, 1982; Once Upon a Time by Robert C. Cumbrow, 1987). Plus surveys of the entire genre (Westerns all' italiana by Massimo Moscati, 1980; C'era Una VoltaIlWestern Italiano by Lorenzo De Luca, 1987; Seul Au Monde dans le Western Italien by Gian Lhassa, 3 vols, 1983; Macaroni Westerns in Japan by Takuya Nikaido and others, 1995) and even an informative journal devoted to the subject and called Westerns all'Italiana, published since 1983 in Anaheim, California, under the editorship of Tom Betts and Tim Ferrante. There have been ten full-length books in the English language alone about Clint Eastwood\n\n(including one by me), all of which have at least one chapter on the 'Dollars' films, most of which attribute the innovations in these films to the actor as well as the director. A huge, and sad to report not always accurate, filmography of Spaghetti Westerns – the Good, the Bad & the Violent, by Thomas Weisser, was published by McFarland in 1992: given the many different titles of individual Spaghetti Westerns – when they were released in different territories and on video – not to mention the occasional 'American' pseudonyms of cast and crew, anyone who takes on a \"complete filmography\" is living very dangerously. Meanwhile, directors and actors now look back on the era of the Spaghetti Western as a golden age of popular Italian film-making. When Rome and Madrid (for interiors) and Almeria (for locations) were bustling with wranglers, technicians, set-builders, actors, translators and all the paraphernalia of international co-productions. When Fellini, Pasolini and Bertolucci were at the height of their very considerable powers – part of a film economy which was booming, sustained by more visits to the cinema per week per adult than any other country in the world (540 million cinema visits per annum to 13,000 cinemas). Today, the surviving directors and actors of that era tend to observe ruefully that most of Cinecittà has gone, all of Italy has television, and the spread of terrestrial and satellite channels plus home video has killed off the popular genres which sustained and dominated the industry of thirty years ago. Many of the key figures have died since I wrote this book: among them, directors Sergio Leone, Sergio Corbucci and Duccio Tessari; actors Lee Van Cleef, Gian Maria Volonté, Klaus Kinski, Fernando Rey, Fernando Sancho and Henry Fonda. The Karl May Museum in the Villa Shatterhand, Radebeul, near Dresden – which was turned by the Communist regime in the 1950s and 1960s into a museum of American imperialism: same collection of Native American artefacts, very different captions – has, since the dismantling of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism, turned back unashamedly into the Karl May Museum. Dean Reed – the Woody Guthrie of the DDR, who appeared in five Spaghetti Westerns and several East German ones, having defected from the U.S.A. in the late 1960s – was found face down in a lake on his estate in 1985, after announcing on television that \"I fear growing old in a country that's not mine\". 'Ringo' is now a brand of Italian chocolate biscuit, and\n\nXIV PREFACE (1998)\n\nthe name 'Django' at last seems to have been copyrighted: in the 1960s, anyone could use it in a film's title; between 1966 and 1973, twenty to thirty Westerns claimed to feature 'Django' somewhere in the story whether or not the scriptwriters originally put him there. The character proved especially popular in West Germany. According to Franco Nero, a film of his called Mafia was retitled Django in Sicily when released there. At the time Spaghetti Westerns was written, Django was banned in Britain: now it is available on video and the notorious Django, Kill was recently shown (in a fuller version than was released in the 1960s) on BBC television. Mainstream surveys of Italian cinema, and indeed of the Western, still tend to be dismissive and patronising about Spaghettis – even thirty years on. Exceptions, where the Western is concerned, include Phil Hardy's Aurum Film Encyclopedia (1983), Ed Buscombe's BFI Companion to the Western (1988) and Kim Newman's Wild West Movies (1990): all British. American surveys on the whole agree with Brian Garfield, whose Western Films (1982) expresses \"a deep disgusted revulsion toward them\", refers to Italian Westerns as \"childish, contrived, morally offensive but fitfully entertaining\" and to this book as \"a dense tome which tells us much more than we want to know about the subject\". Mr. Garfield, incidentally, is the author of Death Wish, so it might be dangerous to disagree. Where Italian cinema is concerned, most serious commentators seem in the end to agree with the critic Lino Miccichè, who wrote – of Leone in particular and Italian Westerns in general – in Il cinema Italiano degli anni '60 (1975): \"[Leone's] exclusive point of reference turns out to be, not the history of the West, even as filtered through the epic that the American film industry has made of it, but the cinema epic itself – that is to say, not history, nor the myth, but the history of cinema and the representation of the myth. A case of 'cinema about cinema' – a phenomenon which is not infrequent in contemporary films, and which is generally indicative (with rare exceptions) of a notable impotence in the perception and definition of 'what is real', since these films bear witness to a kind of closed (and aesthetically vicious) circle, an inert 'perpetual motion' within the form. Far from being 'critical cinema' (as some critics, with\n\na fetish for such categories, have suggested), this parasitic cinema of the dilation of allusion and hyperbole which is always to be compared with 'what has already been said' – risks becoming a showy apology for existing cinema, a passive re-reading of the myth via the 'myth', all leading to the words 'The End', for the end credits and the blank screen can be the only coherent conclusion.\" Good Italian films, added Miccichè, are about the real world and lived experience: these Westerns were about the world as refracted by the cinema; about going to the pictures. He wrote this in 1975. A few years later he would surely, like everyone else in town, have applied the term 'postmodernism' to this phenomenon – for the Italian Westerns, whether they were in some cases a form of 'critical cinema' or not (a reference to an article I wrote for the journal Cinema in 1970), were certainly a very early example in popular cinema of film explicitly about film: a reworking of a traditional genre, with the addition of a lot of irony, a suspicion of grand narratives and a lexicon of \"references\" or allusions which would make sense to local Italian audiences and hold their attention while mainstream critics from further North wrung their hands about \"perpetual motion\". Historical surveys of Italian cinema prefer to concentrate on neo-realism, existential angst and Visconti, rather than on films which are every bit as Italian but which tip their hats to Hollywood. The generation of Hollywood directors known as 'the movie brats', who went to film school in the late 1960s and studied the films of Leone and Corbucci on moviolas in the classroom, picked up on this attempt to make a tired genre feel fresh again and used similar strategies in their own work – especially John Carpenter, George Lucas, John Milius and Steven Spielberg; they were followed in this by 'the video brats' Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez. And so it came to pass that a hero who had started life in Italy as a mixture of James Bond, Che Guevara, Hercules and Judas, had become by the late 1970s a new kind of Hollywood hero as well: the hero as style statement, rather than as crusader. The superhuman hero whose catch-phrases and clothing tell you all you need to know about him. Part of the hall of mirrors of big budget film-making, in the post-studio era. Another important change which has happened\n\nPREFACE (1998) XV\n\nsince Spaghetti Westerns was first published is the spread of videotape and laserdisc, which have made available many of the European Westerns of the 1960s in a bewildering variety of versions: for some reason, Japan is the place for laserdiscs of minor Spaghettis. When this book was being researched, I either had to see the films in out-of-the-way cinemas (with a tape recorder secreted on my lap, to capture the dialogue and the music), or if I wanted to freezeframe I had to hire 16 mm versions and thread them up on a Steenbeck. Now, Spaghetti can be studied and tasted in the home. I know collectors with literally hundreds of these Westerns – recorded off-air somewhere in the world, or else prerecorded. Great for research, but one of the joys of the Eurowestern Festival was seeing these films on the big screen, in glorious Techniscope, projected as they were originally intended to be projected. This does not happen very often these days. On television, Spaghetti Westerns either look like big faces and empty yellow landscapes – in pan and scan versions – or like letterboxes inside rectangles: either way, much of the impact is lost. And, since Spaghettis were an attempt by Italian film-makers to recapture all the wide-eyed excitement of films they had first seen in their childhood during the 1930s and 1940s – before Freud and alienation rode the range – the impact was a very important ingredient. Although it has had – and maybe will continue to have – quite a shelf-life, Spaghetti Westerns is very much of its time where method and argument are concerned. A time when the 'holy trinity' of Linguistics, Marxism and Psychoanalysis tended to dominate film studies, and when many of us hoped these theoretical perspectives would answer all the BIG QUESTIONS about cinema. In fact, they were to turn 'meeja studies' into a discipline which seems terrified of the visual image: we thought then that they might help to explain the image rather than explain it away. When I wrote Spaghetti Westerns in the late 1970s, the redhot debates of the moment were: • could popular cinema (as distinct from the arthouse work of Godard, Godard and Godard) ever be really political? • was the Italian Western just another example of cultural imperialism? • was Brecht a useful guide to the distancing effects of some of these films, or were they just a form of cinematic showing-off?\n\n• why did the 'moment' of the Italian Westerns appeal so much to children of Marx and Coca Cola in Europe, especially the generation of May 1968? • was there a general theory of ideology which could usefully explain the repertoire of themes which recurred in these films, or was such a general theory too undialectical? • was the comic-strip violence of Italian Westerns preferable to the crusading variety of its Hollywood counterpart? I have to confess that sometimes the prose in which these big questions were discussed was as leaden as the bullets in Django's machine gun – like a wall of words between the readers and the movies: my defence, after some seventeen years, is that the book was written in the firm belief that cinema really mattered, and that too much heavy analysis was being devoted to Hollywood in general and John Ford in particular. The answer at the time was not to avoid heavy analysis in itself but to apply it to non-Hollywood cinema. The book was also written in defensive mode: I wanted to persuade someone out there to take these movies seriously; and I wanted to blaze a trail through the then-new discipline of cultural studies by adopting as wide a variety of critical approaches as possible. If I was completely re-writing the book today, I would try and avoid some of the over-complicated arguments and much of the technical language. I would certainly avoid the lengthy sub-clauses, full of second thoughts, which often break up my sentences. And the over-use of the word \"perhaps\". One argument I would beef up, though, would be the argument about images of masculinity and the role of female characters in the Italian Western. At the Eurowestern Festival in Udine, I happened to mention to fellow-delegates during the coffee break between two afternoon films that, unlike all the other popular Cinecittà genres of the 1960s – the sentimental weepy, the commedia all'Italiana, the peplum, the horror film, the 'Mondo'filmand the spy story – the Spaghetti Western was almost exclusively concerned with a masculine universe in which men strutted their stuff and did nasty things to one another, usually in homo-social spaces such as saloons or gun duels or hideouts in the desert. It was as if the stylish, self-contained hero would be diminished in some way if ever he happened to\n\nXVI PREFACE (1998)\n\ndevelop a relationship with a woman. As for gay characters, when they appeared at all they were usually fetishists and/or giggling psychopaths who enjoyed torturing people. The film cycle which preceded the Italian Westerns – the 'sword and sandal' adventure, or 'peplum' – was much more sophisticated in this respect. Why might this be? Where the delegates at Udine were concerned, it was as if I had thrown down a public challenge to Italian manhood. Not only had I been guilty of promoting the phrase 'Spaghetti Westerns', I had also implied that machismo might be out of date. There were plenty of women in Italian Westerns, said one. The West in reality was a mainly masculine place, like the epics of ancient Greece, added another. Granted there was an unusual emphasis on the 'style' of the hero, but what on earth was wrong with that? I replied that one of my female students had likened the experience of watching The Good, the Bad & the Ugly to \"being at a football match where all the men stare at each other\". She had felt excluded from the party. The Eurowestern delegates, of both genders, did not see the point of the discussion at all. Time to watch the next film, Franco Giraldi's Sugar Colt (1966), where the bespectacled hero begins the story working as a Professor in an academy for the self-defence of young ladies. Several jokes later, he becomes an unbeatable gunslinger. Spaghetti Westerns were, with one or two exceptions, a celebration of a masculine world where men were men and women – on the rare occasions they appeared – seemed to like it that way: the understated masculinity of the classic Hollywood Western (which belonged to the same world, only less so) had turned into in-your-face closeups of rugged faces, twitching hands and fetishised weaponry, maleness as spectacle and style, and sometimes into extraordinary feats of atheleticism and grace. The audience stared at the protagonists staring at each other. The women were usually, as the cliche goes, madonnas or whores and sometimes both at once. The politics of the Spaghetti Western, which could be quite radical, did not extend very far into sexual politics – and in this they were quintessentially mid-1960s movies. Surprisingly, the violence – or more accurately the brutality – of Italian Westerns has become less of an issue over the last twenty years. A recent survey of Screen Violence (edited by Karl French, 1996) scarcely mentions them, preferring to\n\nconcentrate on Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch as the watershed film. And yet, Peckinpah himself said he would never have made the films he did in the late 1960s if it hadn't been for Leone's example. Maybe the rural quality of much of the violence in Italian Westerns – like a farmer putting an animal out of its misery – plus their emphasis on the elaborate rituals which precede the moment of death, as well as their puppet-show atmosphere, now look quaint beside the more sophisticated urban mayhem of Lynch, Cronenberg, Tarantino and Rodriguez and the post-1960s emphasis on schlock-horror special effects. Assorted errors of fact in Spaghetti Westerns have been pointed out to me – in reviews at the time of first publication, letters from readers since, magazine articles, and as a result of the hard work of filmographer extraordinaire John Exshaw. These errors usually arose from the patchiness of my research sources at the time, or from the fact that I was translating titles and lines of dialogue – from Italian or French – of films which had not been released in the U.K. I am delighted to have the opportunity to put them right, in the order they appear (page numbers in brackets). Where the Prologue is concerned, the early Italian Western La vampira indiana (p. 29) was in fact directed in 1913 by Vincenzo Leone (or 'Roberto Roberti'); I should also have mentioned a 1916 American film called Argonauts of California – restored in the late 1970s – which plays like Birth of a Nation II and has the San Francisco vigilante committee hanging Spaniards from out of courtroom windows: this would have helped reinforce the chapter's main argument. Cabiria was made in 1914, not 1913. In the chapter on The Studio (chart pp. 71–2), some nomographic confusions inevitably crept in. Hercules: The Strength of Hercules (1960) is not a peplum, but a modern-day comedy; and three extra Italian 'Herculeses' should have been added – Maciste against Hercules in the Valley of Woe (1962), The Conqueror of Atlantis (1965, with Kirk Morris as 'Eracle'), and The Avenger of the Mayas/Hercules against the giant Goliath (1965). Maciste: The Gladiator of Rome (1962) was not in fact a Maciste movie; but The Valley of the Resounding Echo (1964) is. The Ursus list omits The Invincible Three (1963) William Price Fox, in his article for The Saturday Evening Post (p. 70) referred to \"the producer Mr. Mattei\": he must have misheard; the associate producer of The Greatest Robberty in the West was in\n\nPREFACE (1998) XVII\n\nfact called Maffei. Illustration 28 (p. 80), which purports to be from Django, is in fact from Lucio Fulci's Colt Concert aka The Brute and the Beast or Massacre Time (1966) which was re-titled as a Django movie for German release. The full title of the notorious Django, Kill (p. 82) was Django, Kill! (If You Live Shoot!) and it is Mexican baddie Zorro, or Sorro – rather than Hagerman or Alderman – who is extremely fond of his pet parrot: the Italian print reveals this not to have been a Django film at all; the Tomas Milian character was originally called Barney. My list of seventeen Django films released between 1966 and 1974 was based on French sources (so the dates and titles refer to that particular market), and includes other entries which were not strictly-speaking Djangos: Django the Condemned (1967), a Spanish production, originally featured a hero called 'Reese O'Brien' and was re-titled a year after original release; Nude Django (1968) was a German sexploiter rather than an Italian Western; Django Always Draws Second (1971) started life, bizarrely, as His Name was Pot.. . But They Called Him Allegria. On the other hand, Kill, Django . . . Kill First (1970, directed by Sergio Garrone), Even Django Has His Price (1971, released on video in Britain with the delirious title Django's Cut Price Corpses and directed by Luigi Batzella), and the Spanish Diango, A Bullet for You (1966, directed by Leon Klimovsky) should have been included on the list. A Corbucci-approved sequel to the original Django – called, inevitably, Django Strikes Again – was released in 1987, directed by Nello Rossati with Franco Nero again in the lead role. Sandokan (p. 92) was in fact played by Ray Danton, although Lex Barker did appear in some of the Salgari adaptations. Mario Bava's Arizona Bill and La Strada per Fort Alamo (also p. 92) were one and the same film released under different titles. Vincenzo Leone's Fra Diavolo (p. 96) was made in 1925, and was the first feature-length version of this old standby. In the Karl May and the Noble Savage chapter, I wrote that \"not one\" of the Winnetou stories was available in English – unaware that Winnetou 1 and 2 had just been translated by Michael Shaw for The Seabury Press, New York (I read the books in French translation, as by 'Charles May'); I also somehow confused (p. 113) James Bond villain Adolfo Celi with Mario Adorf, the Swiss actor who later appeared in Peckinpah's Major Dundee. The chapter The 'Dollars*\\' Trilogy – Decors and Details states that a mortar shell breaks\n\nthe beam from which The Good is about to be hanged (p. 171) in The Good, The Bad & The Ugly when in fact the shell breaks just about everything but the beam; the farmer in the same film is not played by Fernando Rey (p. 173) but by Spanish actor Antonio Casas - who resembles him. Later in The Good.. ., the Union captain at Langstone (or Langston) Bridge refers to \"the most potent weapon in war\": since his preferred drink comes in green glass bottles wrapped in straw, it is more likely to have been wine than whisky. One of the stills from Once upon a Time in the West (p. 211, top right) needs reversing. At the beginning of the critical filmography (p. 256), I should have mentioned The Monthly Film Bulletin for November 1971 – making a total of three checklists of pseudonymns. Corbucci's The Great Silence (1968) was finally given its British première on BBC television a few years ago under the title The Big Silence. In A Professional Gun (1968), the Tony Musante character was known as Eufemio in Spain and as Paco Roman everywhere else; in Companeros (1970), which was not really \"a sequel\" (p. 236) the Tomas Milian equivalent was called Vasco or El Vasco rather than Basco; in A Genius, aka Nobody's the Greatest, Terence Hill played a character called 'Joe Thanks' who was later rechristened 'Nobody', at least in the title, on wider European release. Sergio Leone (p. 258) was born in Rome rather than Naples – although he spent part of his childhood in wartime Naples; The Colossus of Rhodes was an Italian-Spanish-French co-production; and actor Gary Raymond wasn't in Sodom and Gomorrah. My filmography of Leone's Westerns – through a series of typos – includes German actress Marianne Koch three times: in fact, the part of the Colonel's sister in For a Few Dollars More was played by Rosemary Dexter, the part of Maria in The Good... by Rada Rassimov. The credits for My Name is Nobody should have read \"Photography: Giuseppe Ruzzolini (Italy/Spain), Armando Nannuzzi (America)''. Domenico Paolella was born on 15 October 1915 (rather than 1918). Winnetou the Warrior (1963) had an Italian production input. Sergio Sollima was born on 17 April 1921, in Rome; in his film Run, Man, Run (1968), John Ireland played 'Santillana' while Donald O'Brien was Cassidy. Composer Luis Enrique Bacalov was born in Argentina rather than Spain. Still with the critical filmography, Gianni Garko\n\nXVIII PREFACE (1998)\n\ndid not first appear as Sartana in Guns of Violence (1967): his first appearance as the character, in the same year, was as a villain in One Thousand Dollars On the Black, directed by Alberto Cardone. Guns of Violence was an alternative title for 10,000 Dollars Blood Money (1967, directed by Romolo Guerrieri). The Sartana character then came to be associated with director Giuliano Carmineo (or Carnimeo – the sources just cannot agree about this). Klaus Kinski's autobiography has at last been translated – after twenty years – as Kinski Uncut (1996). It seems that Riz Ortolani may not, in fact, have written the score for Apaches' Last Battle – a German-YugoslavianItalian-French co-production: some sources claim that Winnetou regular Martin Bottcher wrote it, while others have stuck with Ortolani. Whoever the composer, the film starred Lex Barker as Old Shatterhand rather than Stewart Granger as Old Surehand. In Today It's Me, Tomorrow You, Tatsuya Nakadai plays a mad Mexican rather than \"a samurai warrior\". Perhaps the most significant error in my filmography is the treatment of the creative relationship between Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai. I tended for some reason to present them as equal partners ('Music: Ennio Morricone and Bruno Nicolai') when I should have written 'Music by Ennio Morricone, conducted (or sometimes directed) by Bruno Nicolai'. Nicolai did write the scores for a couple of Italian Westerns, but they are nowhere near the quality of Morricone's. Where the 'cut sequences in Leone's Westerns' are concerned, many of these sequences have now been restored in Italian video versions, or in international videos and laserdiscs. So readers can compare my versions – translated from Italian scripts – with the real thing: they are pretty close. Less close are my hastily scribbled lines of dialogue from films I saw in the darkness of the cinema. I quote Ramon Rojo (in Fistful of Dollars) as saying (p. 185): \"When a man with a Winchester meets a man with a pistol, the man with a pistol is a dead man\". In fact, the old Mexican proverb goes \"when a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, the man with a pistol will be a dead man\". I still prefer my version, but it is not quite accurate.\n\nAnd I quote Calvera (in The Magnificent Seven) as saying (p. 219) \"You stayed... why?\" In fact, the line goes: \"You came back – for a place like this. Why? A man like you – why?\" Finally, some typos: Zinneman should be Zinnemann; Fernando Sancha should be Fernando Sancho – throughout; Carlo Ponto should be Carlo Ponti; Aldo Guiffrè should be Aldo Giuffrè; Bice Valerian should be Bice Walerian; Dalia (in The Colossus) should be Diala; Helzapoppin' should be Hellzapoppin'; and Gian Maria Volonté \"starred in\" rather than \"appeared in\" the two films mentioned (p. 146). I would like warmly to thank John Exshaw, whose eagle eye spotted a number of these errors, the many readers who have written to me with suggested amendments over the years, and Lorenzo Codelli who invited me to be a panel speaker at Eurowestern in Udine. Also Ed Buscombe, who put me in touch with Lorenzo and who sat next to me at the Festival taking notes – for some reason – on cowboys in bathtubs. When Spaghetti Westerns was first published, most of the reviews were generous. \"A critical model for future genre studies\", wrote Gary Crowdus in Cinéaste. \"Unquestionably the single best book written about the Western\", added Scott Simmon in The Journal of Popular Film and Television. Philip French in The Observer recalled the gauntlet he had thrown down in 1977 – \"A major study remains to be written on the European Western and its relationship to the American version\" – and added \"He's written it\". Robert Reiner, in New Society, concluded that \"the book is a major contribution to the understanding of film in society, and is as much fun as the movies it discusses\". A double-edged comment? I hope not. My favourite line came from Robert Hewison in the Times Literary Supplement, when he began his review \"The Professor of Cultural History at the Royal College of Art has taken his chair in both hands\". Some were bemused by the subject. Others appalled by it. Most were pleased that I had adopted a contextual approach – with plenty of material on the social, economic, historical and\n\nPREFACE (1998) XIX\n\npolitical background – and that I had concentrated so heavily (from pp. 141–216) on the films of Sergio Leone. The characteristic Variety headline read US WEST, ITALO STYLE IN BRITON'S ANALYSIS. One of the recurring comments was that I had somehow managed, in Spaghetti Westerns, to write for \"film scholars and the hang 'em high brigade\" both at the same time. Which I take to be a great complement. At the end of the Preface to the 1981 edition, I wrote: \"The written sources which I have found most useful are listed in the Select Bibliography. In addition to the books about how best to approach the problems of film and society, these include several interviews with Sergio Leone and other directors of Spaghettis (in French, Belgian, German, Italian, Spanish and American periodicals), surveys of Italian formula cinema, critical writings on aspects of Italian and American Westerns, and articles on the political sociology of Southern Italy. The emphasis I have given to Westerns made in other European countries than Italy and Spain may seem rather surprising. It was not originally intended. But I discovered, during the writing of this book, that an understanding of the Italian Western to some extent depended on an understanding of the European Western in general – and that meant that the German Westerns of the 1930s and 1960s (and, to a lesser extent, some French and Soviet Westerns) had to be taken into account as well. Some books and articles about these are also listed in the Bibliography. The rest of my research took place 'in the field' – the field being cinemas in England, France, Switzerland, West Germany and Italy. This research led me into some bizarre situations. Two stand out in my mind.\n\nOne is sitting in a tiny village hall near the shores of Lake Geneva, watching the infamous Django. The print of this Italian-Spanish co-production which I saw was dubbed into French (from Italian), and had German subtitles. I was surrounded by Italians who could not understand a word of it. But when Django (Franco Nero) yelled, 'Espèce de salaud', before dispatching a bunch of Mexican bandits, the audience roared its approval. That, apparently, was a language which was internationally recognised. The other is sitting in the dining hall of Trinity College, Cambridge, opposite the guest of a Fellow in Classics (the guest was at that time studying the love poetry of Catullus), who, when the port came round, lowered his voice and admitted me how he had once worked as an extra (a Mexican heavy) in a Spaghetti Western called Seven Golden Boys (he thought produced by Cathay Films), which was being shot in North Africa when he happened to be there on his holidays; apparently, his job was to hold the horses. What better symbol of the connections between Cinecittà's 'classical' epics and the Italian Western?\" Well actually, the film had the working title – I have subsequently discovered – of Tre ragazzi d'oro or Three Golden Boys (1966), but was released as Tre pistole Contro Cesare or Three Guns Against Cesare and re-released in 1968 as Tre pistole per un massacro or Three Guns for a Massacre. The co-producers were De Laurentiis (Rome) and Casbah Film (Algeria). It was called in America Death Walks In Laredo. So it wasn't in fact Cathay Films. And there were far less than Seven Golden Boys. But what the hell? It is still a great anecdote. Christopher Frayling February 1998\n\nPreface\n\nFirst, a word about the title of this book. The term 'Spaghetti Western' was first coined by American critics of the Italian Western, and was intended as a pejorative; back home in Italy, the films came to be known —rather defensively —as 'Macaroni Westerns'. This started a craze among film journalists for applying culinary labels to Unauthentic' or 'alien' Westerns: 'Sauerkraut Westerns' (produced in West Germany), 'Paella Westerns' (international coproductions shot in Spain), 'Camembert Westerns' (produced at Fontainebleau), 'Chop Suey Westerns' (made in Hong Kong), and, most recently, 'Curry Westerns' (financed and made in India). Hollywood Westerns have traditionally been known as 'oaters'; perhaps a more suitable label, in the light of this craze, would now be 'Hamburger Westerns' (John Wayne representing the pure beef variety). It is doubtful whether the Duke would have found much to say in favour of yet another European brand — the 'Borsch Western': yet, late in 1977, a blockbusting Western based on the stories of Bret Harte and called Armed and Very Dangerous was packing them in all over Moscow; it was filmed (by the veteran Soviet director Vladimir Vainshtok) in Romania, Czechoslovakia and Southern Russia, and had as its main theme the discovery of oil in the Arizona desert. The oil-barons were the baddies. I prefer to use 'Spaghetti Western' in a descriptive sense (for movies made in Italy and Spain) — and also as a term of endearment. No 'racist' slur is intended. Professor René Konig, in his sociological analysis of fashion, The Restless Image, has this to say about spaghetti : It originated in the East; it is now a food known throughout the world that has spread far beyond the borders of Italy. It even changed its function as it did so: to begin with it was a typical poor man's food; today, particularly outside Italy, it has become a symbol of sophisticated cuisine, and is a popular speciality.\n\nA more appropriate label (despite its origins) to apply to the better Westerns made in Italy would be difficult to imagine. So 'Spaghetti Westerns' it is. Second, in answer to the question 'Where does this book stand?' — a question which reviewers always seem to ask about film books these days — it will become readily apparent that it adopts several different critical perspectives, derived in the main from sociology, history and film theory. Although I firmly believe that the only film criticism that is worthwhile is located within a coherent framework of theory, I also believe that a study of formula cinema (of the type represented by a genre such as the Spaghetti Western) demands a transdisciplinary approach to questions about production (the studios) and consumption (the Italian film-going public, in the first instance), thus a variety of critical perspectives which can help inform the reading of a specific body of film texts. These perspectives can then be brought into focus through the actual process of reading. Such a bombardment of formula films from a variety of disciplinary perspectives will not, I hope, be confused with methodological timidity — for timidity of this kind can all too easily fall into the trap of hedging every single statement with a multitude of 'pluralistic' qualifications, and such qualifications, often a hidden defence against accusations of 'Formalism', 'Marxism', 'Structuralism', or, perish the thought, 'Freudianism', can in turn all too easily become simply an excuse for panic-stricken woollymindedness. In short, a transdisciplinary approach seems to me to be appropriate for a study of formula films; pluralism for its own sake, or eclecticism, does not. Rather than being a theoretical maverick who wanders, dazed, into every available academic corral, I have attempted to pen my object of study within as many of the contemporary theories about how best to approach the problem of film and society as seemed useful for a full understanding of it: these include narrative analysis (Will Wright's XXI\n\nXXII PREFACE\n\nSixguns and Society and especially Frederic Jameson's critique of that book), generic criticism (John G. Cawelti's Six-Gun Mystique), structuralism (Umberto Eco's 'Myth of Superman'), the sociology of the cinema (Jeremy Tunstall's The Media Are American), political sociology (Edward Banfield on 'amoral familism') and a Marxian critique (James Roy MacBean's Film and Revolution). There are, of course, other theoretical perspectives which could have contributed to my frame of reference: I could, for example, have referred more explicitly to the current debate about the production and distribution of social knowledge (the 'market place' of ideology) which is so central to fashionably marxisant writings on cinematic practice. This mode of inquiry can undeniably help to establish the 'limits of consciousness' (in Lucien Goldmann's phrase), or the repertoire of preferred definitions of reality, out of which the film industry may construct a coherent consensus at a given time (making this consensus seem 'natural', or 'responsible', in the process); it can even provide an explanation, in these terms, as to why a specific film production seems to look like this, rather than like that. To give an example: auteurist critics of the Western (such as Andrew Sarris) are fond of celebrating what is special about an individual director's 'vision of the West' — as if an unlimited number of such 'visions' were available to the director at any one time; by locating, or situating, this director's films within an all-embracing theory of ideology, a critic can reduce this unlimited number of 'visions' to one dominant 'vision' (supported by a socially constructed 'consensus') to which the director may be said to subscribe, of which he may (in rare cases) be attempting a critique, or 'fragments' of which may be identifiable in his work. That is why I have discussed the 'quasi-narrative' function of ideology in my analysis of Will Wright's Sixguns and Society. But there must come a point when such an approach can provide no more than one context within which to read specific film texts. The Althusserians' emphasis on the 'social knowledge' inscribed within the text as an object — to the exclusion of questions about production ('How did this film come to be made?' 'What process did the film go through, to become the finished product?'), or about reception ('Why did audiences choose this film or this genre of films as opposed to that one?', 'What was particularly exciting or attractive about this director's work?') — often encourages them to elevate\n\nthat 'social knowledge' (or ideology) to the status of a simple, exclusive grid through which the director must see and the audience must look. In consequence, to adapt John Berger's comment on this mode of analysing specific artefacts, they cannot incorporate the act of film-making, or the act of looking at films, into their theoretical model. The experience of the film-maker must be irrelevant, as must the audience's experience of his experience. If one wants to ask the sort of questions about culture and society that a critic like John Berger seeks to ask, then one's conclusion (like his) will surely be that 'ideology partly determines the finished result, but it does not determine the energy flowing through the current. And it is with this energy that the spectator identifies.' In the case of the pure hack (and there are plenty of those working in Italian formula cinema), this 'energy' may be minimal; but that does not, of course, mean that it is thus to be excluded from one's theoretical model. Further, the concept of the 'Ideological State Apparatus' (much loved by these fashionably marxisant critics) has recently been misinterpreted to mean that social knowledge is produced by the ruling class, and transmitted through cultural and educational institutions controlled by the bourgeoisie into the otherwise empty minds of the working class; it thus ignores (in John Mepham's words) that 'it is not the bourgeois class that produces ideas, but bourgeois society. And the effective dissemination of ideas is only possible because, or to the extent that, the ideas thus disseminated are ideas which for quite different reasons do have a sufficient degree of effectiveness both in rendering social reality intelligible and in guiding practice within it for them to be apparently acceptable.' In other words, the dominant ideology may set the limits of 'popular' forms of knowledge (as we have seen), but it rests for the most part on the voluntary and spontaneous 'consent' of subordinate classes (rather than directly on repressive State Apparatuses), and is, in consequence, most significantly manifest in commonsense, everyday 'knowledge'. So the recovery of the 'deep structures' latent in everyday 'knowledge', if it is to avoid the accusation of bland reductionism, can only take the form of 'concrete analysis of concrete situations' (in Paul Hirst's words). From the point of view of this study, I found the self-styled Althusserians' opaque restatement of the old base/superstructure heresy of little\n\nPREFACE XXIII\n\nuse: for the relationship between Italian formula cinema and Italian society is clearly a relationship (in these terms) within the superstructure, and thus requires some understanding of the internal dynamics of that superstructure (an understanding which must take into account, specifically, the production methods of the studios, the audiences at which the films are aimed, and the fact that those audiences tend to vote with their feet). Some of these 'Althusserians' have not only succeeded in misrepresenting Althusser (by caricaturing his concept of 'State Apparatuses'), but have also preferred to look out of the library window, rather than at the screen. In short, I chose not to rest my analysis, or to base the questions I sought to ask, on the current debate about the production and distribution of social knowledge, for three main reasons. First, because I believe that there is more to a film, even a formula film, than simply a static text for experts in social theory to decipher. Films may even have a purpose beyond the simple propagation of commonplaces: a great deal more than 'raw' ideology seems to me to be running through the gate of the projector. Second, because I do not believe that film audiences are as mindless as these experts have had to presuppose. Indeed, the labels which are currently applied to the general subject-matter of this study all seem to presuppose a mindlessness, or supineness, on the part of film audiences — perhaps an index of how prevalent the concept of 'repressive apparatuses' really is, even among non-Marxists. Some call it 'mass culture', others 'popular culture', others 'media culture'; but as Frederic Jameson has pointed out, the term 'masses' is an anachronism probably dating from the 1920s and 1930s, the idea of 'the people' comes to us from nineteenth-century populism, and the concept of a media culture is derived from McLuhan, with his stress on technological determinism. Italian formula films of the 1960s and early 1970s were certainly popular, and were the product of an industry which seems to have been directly in touch with its audience: towards the end of this period, Italy, with help from co-producers, was producing over 200 feature films a year (a total surpassed only by India, especially Bombay, and Japan), could support nearly 13,000 cinemas (a total surpassed only by the USSR and the USA), and registered over 540 million cinema attendances per annum (a total surpassed only by the USSR and India); perhaps\n\nthis had something to do with the fact that Italians (mainly Northern and Central Italians) only owned 11 million television sets (a total surpassed by the USA, USSR, Japan, West Germany, the UK and France). So 'popular culture' was certainly a going concern. But the main trouble with these labers ('mass', 'popular' and 'media') is that they all imply that formula films are something to be enjoyed by 'them', not 'us'. The third reason why I did not wish to become deeply embroiled in the current debate about ideology is that this book is about one specific film genre — the European Western, and, in parti cular, the Italian Western: I did not intend to end up on the platform of some critical guillotine, muttering, 'It is a far, far meta thing that I do now, than I have ever done before . ..' To have had both feet planted firmly in the air would surely not have helped me come to grips with this particular film genre, one of the most down-to-earth in modern formula cinema. The need for a systematic study of the Italian Western phenomenon has been noted by many critics, both here and in Italy, for some time. In the most recent edition of Westerns (1977), Philip French says that he feels that 'a major study remains to be written on the European Western and its relationship to the American ver sion': French now considers that the things he said about Spaghettis in the 1973 edition of his book were 'patronizing and unduly dismissive'. And Lino Miccichè, in Il cinema Italiano degli anni '60 (1976), reckons that the Italian Westerns are 'a curious and important cultural phenomenon, about which a full, general study would be most welcome, covering not only the common — and variant — archetypes in the films, but also the common (and more rarely different) sociological implications'. The recent full length studies of the American Western (by Cawelti, Nachbar and Wright) have tended to neglect Italian Westerns — and, on occasion, have even included actively misleading statements about then), My book is intended to fill what I take to be a siginificant gap in the literature about this particular type of formula cinema. And, as far as possible, to set the record straight. Why 'formula cinema'? The term seems to me to sidestep some of the problems associated with the more general labels which academics have applied to lumpen culture. It has a strong economic connotation (describing, as it does, films which emerge from an industry substantial enough to produced\n\nXXIV PREFACE\n\nconveyor-belt products) — as well as a generic one. And with reservations one might add that the term implies a judgment about how films are received by the audiences which pay to see them. John G. Cawelti (in Adventure, Mystery and Romance, 1976) neatly (perhaps too neatly) distinguishes between 'formula' products, and their 'serious' counterparts, precisely in terms of their reception: 'serious' works 'tend toward some sort of encounter with our sense of the limitation of reality, while formulas embody moral fantasies of a world more exciting, more fulfilling, or more benevolent than the one we inhabit'. This distinction has been recently made in another way, by Pierre Barberis, as one between 'works which engage in a process of enhancing our understanding of reality' (a process which involves both author and audience) and 'ideological productions, which accept a given view of the world, and transmit it' (of statistical, or perhaps sociological interest only); and in yet another way by Roland Barthes, as a distinction between 'the text of bliss .. . the text that disconnects . . . unsettles the reader's historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, brings to a crisis his relation with language' and 'the text of pleasure . . . the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a comfortable practice of reading'. If we accept this distinction completely, we must assume that 'formula cinema' characteristically operates from within the heart of a particular society's ideological consensus. To take the example of the traditional Hollywood Western again: if explicitly political themes happen to be introduced into the formula, the field of ideological battle is a well-prepared one, in which the values of 'individualism' or 'populism' fight it out with each other in a variety of combinations — all keeping well within the broad consensus of opinion. This meltingpot of ideas is labelled 'pluralism', yet the contents somehow never come to the boil — with the ingredients actually struggling with each other, or challenging any foreign bodies which might have fallen into the soup. Films which stand outside this broad consensus ('oppositional films', 'serious works', 'texts of bliss') may thus be expected to challenge not only prevailing ideas, but also the accepted 'naturalistic' ways in which these ideas tend to be represented: an aesthetic challenge (and, of course, an economic one — since formulas are great box-office) as well as a political challenge. If such films wish to 'enhance our understanding of\n\nreality', to set up an 'encounter with our sense of the limitation of reality', they must first unmask the confidence trick of 'naturalism', and somehow teach the viewer not to accept the reproduction of the world in its immediate appearance as the only 'reality', or as something to do with 'nature'. This is the way, it seems, in which films can 'bring to a crisis' the audience's 'relation with language'. It is, of course, asking a lot of 'serious works' — for the whole of Western cinema (and especially formula cinema) has up until very recently been dominated by a 'naturalistic' aesthetic: to make such an explicit challenge financially viable, with a sizeable public, can only be an uphill task. Nevertheless the challenge must in some way be financially viable, since movies cost so much. Which brings me to another controversy, very much alive since the release of Bertolucci's 1900 — and that is whether such a challenge can ever emerge, however tentatively, from within formula cinema. If we accept the rock-hard distinction between 'formula' works and their 'serious' counterparts, this would seem to be an impossibility. After all, if an industry is large enough to produce films in a conveyor-belt way, and if the products of this process are defined as 'ideological productions, which accept a given view of the world', then it is pretty unlikely — to say the least — that they will ever overstep the consensus in a significant way. In the case of the Italian Westerns — which were produced (with the aid of American capital) by Cinecittà (a giant studio which is partly owned and controlled by the Italian state and which was opened by Mussolini in April 1937) — it is even more unlikely. Lino Miccichè, writing about the films of Sergio Leone, concludes that they are really 'a showy apology for existing cinema' — and the various stages of his argument locate his conclusion very much within this debate about the consensual role of formula cinema: Leone's later films provide abundant evidence of the basically abstract nature of his cinema. In fact, his exclusive point of reference turns out to be, not the history of the West, even as filtered through the epic that the American film industry has made of it, but the cinema epic itself — that is to say, not history, nor the myth, but the history of the cinema and the representation of the myth. A case of 'cinema about cinema' —a phenomenon which is not infrequent in\n\nPREFACE\n\ncontemporary films, and which is generally indicative (with rare exceptions) of a notable impotence in the perception and definition of 'what is real', since these films bear witness to a kind of closed (and aesthetically vicious) circle, an inert 'perpetual motion' within the form. Far from being 'critical cinema' (as some critics, with a fetish for such categories, have suggested), this parasitic cinema of the dilation of allusion and hyperbole — which is always to be compared with 'what has already been said' — risks becoming a showy apology for existing cinema, a passive re-reading of the myth via the 'myth', all leading to the words 'The End', for the end credits and the blank screen can be the only coherent conclusion. For Miccichè, Leone's films — the best of the Italian Westerns — not only accept the traditional ways in which Hollywood has represented 'the myth of the West', but, by implication, actively support them as well. Any suggestion that out of the Italian Western formula may have emerged a form of 'critical cinema' (this is a reference to an article I wrote for Cinema in 1970) is reading too much into a genre which continued to operate from well within the consensus. Yet, it will be one of the contentions of this book that the two main strategies which 'critical cinema' has adopted — to shock the spectator into a questioning of what he or she is seeing, and a recognition of ideas which he or she can think about after the film is over — are discernible in the better Italian Westerns. The first strategy is a Brechtian one — 'laying bare the device', stimulating the audience to question the visual conventions being used, reminding the audience that it is watching a film, and so on: this can take the form of 'a film within a film' (Fellini's 8½), or using the camera and soundtrack in unexpected ways (Godard's Wind from the East). It can also take the form of making accepted visual conventions more obvious, more explicit than ever before — and a film like Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West seems to me to fit into this category: Leone does not exactly 'lay bare the device', but he does draw attention to devices which have characteristically been understated, or unobtrusive. And in this way he keeps the audience at arm's length. The second strategy takes the form of an extreme stylisation which is intended to be at odds with the (accepted) reproduction of\n\nXXV\n\nthe world in its immediate appearance, or with the everyday experience of the viewer: the melodramatic expressionism of a Chabrol or a Fassbinder is perhaps the most obvious example of this at the moment. Leone's melodramatic expressionism (an extension of the formulae of the traditional Western) perhaps qualifies as well. These two strategies — as much as the more explicit criticisms of the 'myth of the West' contained within his films — appear to constitute the bases of Leone's 'critical cinema': he exploits the Hollywood Western, at the same time as 'deconstructing' it — an act of demythologisation, rather than demythicisation, if one may put it that way. Such an exercise, both a celebration and a denunciation, could only have happened from outside Hollywood, from inside a formula genre, and from an industry which has a lot of confidence in its audience. Perhaps this form of 'critical cinema' was even possible within the consensus represented by the Italian film-going public, in which case the definitions of 'the formula' outlined above may perhaps be adapted to accommodate the phenomenon. Of course, the vast majority of Italian Westerns, embodying as they do 'fantasies of a world more exciting . . . than the one we inhabit', do not require such an adaptation. So perhaps the Cawelti/Barberis/Barthes concept of 'formula products' remains unscathed. But it seems to me equally possible that a formula system (such as Cinecittà's) can produce variations the value of which is more than 'just sociological'. In Panofsky's famous words, 'while it is true that commercial art is always in danger of ending up as a prostitute, it is equally true that non-commercial art is always in danger of ending up as an old maid'. To put it another way, a few of the best Italian Westerns deserve to be taken very seriously indeed. One final point. If I have pillaged the language of literary criticism to analyse what I consider to be the most significant aspects of these works ('style', 'authorship', and so on), and the terminology of linguistics ('syntax', 'grammar', etc.) to communicate their unusual emphasis on 'critical cinema', this does not necessarily mean that I believe (1) in the direct application of literary critical methods to cinema or (2) in the sign-language (or even cliche-language) of cinema as directly related to linguistics: it simply means that the analogies have proved useful to me, given the fact that cinema criticism has yet to evolve a technical language of its own (Saussure reckoned that linguistics would be just one branch\n\nXXVI PREFACE\n\nof semiology — but the omniverous conceptual equipment of linguistics seems to have swallowed up the whole 'science' of semiology in one gulp). Indeed, the transdisciplinary nature of this book reflects my belief that recent attempts to make film criticism into an autonomous discipline have been far from convincing. They may even have been misleading. The written sources which I have found most useful are listed in the (very) Select Bibliography. In addition to the books — already mentioned — about how best to approach the problem of film and society, these include several interviews with Sergio Leone and other directors of Spaghettis (in French, Belgian, German, Italian, Spanish and American periodicals), surveys of Italian formula cinema, critical writings on aspects of Italian and American Westerns, and articles on the political sociology of Southern Italy. The emphasis I have given to Westerns made in other European countries may seem rather surprising. It was not originally intended. But I discovered, during the writing of this book, that an understanding of the Italian Western to some extent depended on an understanding of the European Western in general — and that meant that the German Westerns of the 1930s and 1960s (and, to a lesser extent, some French and Soviet Westerns) had to be taken into account as well. Some books and articles about these are also\n\nlisted in the Bibliography. The rest of my research took place 'in the field' — the field being cinemas in England, France, Switzerland, West Germany, and Italy. This research led me into some bizarre situations. Two stand out in my mind. One is sitting in a tiny village hall near the shores of Lake Geneva, watching the infamous Django. The print of this Italian-Spanish co-production which I saw was dubbed into French (from Italian), and had German subtitles. I was surrounded by Italians who could not understand a word of it. But when Django (Franco Nero) yelled, 'Espèce de salaud,' before dispatching a bunch of Mexican bandits, the audience started shouting its approval. That, apparently, was a language which was internationally recognised. The other is sitting in the dining hall of Trinity College, Cambridge, opposite the guest of a Fellow in Classics (the guest was at that time studying the love poetry of Catullus), who, when the port came round, lowered his voice and told me how he had once worked as an extra (a Mexican heavy) in a Spaghetti Western called Seven Golden Boys (Cathay Films), which was being shot in North Africa when he happened to be there on his holidays; apparently, his job was to hold the horses.

Marshall found 'some kind of yellow mettle' near Sutter's Mill, in the Sacramento Valley, California. By 1849, claims had been registered all over the valley, on land which had been granted to Johann August Suter (or Sutter) by the Mexican Governor of California some seven years before. At the close of 1850, there were 50,000 men panning for gold in the area. Up until that time, Sutter's dramatic rise to fame (which made him the first self-made multi-millionaire in American history) had followed the classic pattern. He had emigrated from Europe (dodging a bankruptcy charge and deserting his wife and children in the process) without a thaler in his pocket. On arrival in New York, he had managed to earn enough dollars from odd jobs to join a wagon train to the West. He had reached California (after various adventures en route), determined to make the inhospitable virgin land (then a province of the Republic of Mexico, ruled from Monterey) into a profitable garden. By 'fabricating' a colourful European past, he had managed to acquire some letters of recommendation, and, ultimately, a land grant from Governor Alvarado. By 1848, a combination of entrepreneurial initiative, cheap labour (mainly Mormons, Indians, Hawaian Islanders, white half-castes, and out-of-work soldiers), original ideas about irrigation, the first steam-mill ever built in the Far West, the cash to buy out surrounding small farms, and a lot of luck, had made Sutter's New Helvetia project (at the mouth of the Sacramento River, near the site of what is now the city of Sacramento) into a fabulously successful concern. Sutter's empire included distilleries, grist-mills, agricultural land, and stock-raising compounds, and he was in the process of building a saw-mill — to sell timber to the neighbouring settlers. But in 1849, when the Gold Rush began in earnest, this empire abruptly collapsed. The events of 1848-9 shattered Sutter's faith in the rewards which the Lord showered on hard-working entrepreneurs. He spent\n\nthe rest of his life trying to persuade the American authorities to grant him some compensation for the land which the forty-niners had stolen from him (apart from anything else, in law he owned most of what had become the great city of San Francisco). But he was unsuccessful, and, although he was solemnly presented with a commission as General during the celebration of California's fourth anniversary as the Golden State, he died disillusioned, broke, and more than a little crazy, at the age of seventy-three. The standard near-contemporary accounts of Sutter's experiences (which include The Sunset Land by the Rev. John Todd (1870), Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine (1857), and Simeon Ide's Conquest of California) are unclear about Sutter's response to the discovery of gold on his property. When Marshall (the contractor on his mill) first told him about the yellow nuggets, Sutter 'thought he had gone mad'; but after various on-thespot experiments, and consultation of an encyclopaedia, he was convinced. Marshall immediately rode back to the mill (over thirty miles away) in the pouring rain, 'with no supper'. The following morning, when they both went to look at the 'strike', 'they were equally excited', and were mainly concerned about keeping it a secret. A Mormon soldier (one of Sutter's workers), or the female cook at the mill — the accounts differ — overheard them, however, and the news had spread around the Rio de Los Americanos within a matter of days. 'Sutter's own indiscretion' may have added fuel to the flames; but there was a delay of about a month (probably because the story took a lot of believing), before panning began in earnest. Todd, in particular, was committed to the notion that the Gold Rush which resulted from Marshall's 'strike' had 'greatly benefitted the great mass of people' and had 'advanced civilisation' by the great migration of miners from all over the world which ensued. He was also impressed by what Captain\n\n4\n\nTHE EUROPEAN WESTERN: SUTTER AND HIS GOLD\n\nSutter had achieved on his 'grant of land' before 1848. The first part of Sutter's life clearly contained most of the ingredients of a classic 'pioneer' Western (penniless and flamboyant European Protestant makes good, by turning the desert into a garden). But those, like Todd, who sought to mythologise it always had a problem with the events which followed the Gold Rush. If Sutter was in the right, then the forty-niners were all trespassers, claim-jumpers and arsonists: in other words, the popular stereotype of 'Gramps', with his pick-axe and prospector's burro, was the stereotype of a villain. Not a very auspicious start to a series of events which so 'greatly benefitted the great mass of people'. If, on the other hand, Sutter was in the wrong (a land giant from Monterey no longer being valid, perhaps), then his earlier career as an enterprising pioneer must in some way have been tainted. The ambiguity is nicely captured in the portrait of General Sutter done by the Swiss painter Frank Buscher in 1866. In this portrait (painted nearly a quarter of a century after Sutter's 'fall'), the General is shown standing against a background which represents 'the wilderness' (the Great American Desert, and the Rocky Mountains). He is wearing a straw hat, and is dressed in 'urban' clothes (frock-coat, formal shirt and tie); he sports a flamboyant grey cavalry moustache, and sideburns. The relationship between the figure of Sutter and the 'wilderness' is thus a relationship between tamer and tamed. But Buscher's treatment of the General's eyes clearly shows the ambiguity of this relationship: there is a twinkle in them, but also a sadness and a world-weariness. Hugh Honour has interpreted the portrait as 'the very image of the genial adventurer': but Buscher seems to me to have been trying to capture the image of a man who had been 'the genial adventurer', and who had a reputation as a 'pioneer', but who could only look back on the experience with regret. Whether or not this is so, the dime-novelists and others concerned with popular stereotypes of the West were in no doubt about the symbolic significance of the Gold Rush, and about the need to write Sutter out of history: they opted decisively for 'Gramps'; New Helvetia became the wilderness, and the nuggets became the Holy Grail. There were, of course, mythological precedents for this (did they but know it): the geologists now tell us that the story of Jason and the Golden Fleece was also the story of an arduous 'pioneer' trail, followed by a flagrant example of claim-jumping (Medea being the mine-owner's wife).\n\nThe Rev. Todd also had strong views about Sutter's relationship with the Mexicans. He asserted that the owner of New Helvetia was relying on the expected takeover of power when California became a State of the Union; the border country which (largely due to Sutter's efforts) was by 1848 a highly productive sector, had become one of the most valuable tracts of land in the West even before the Gold Rush, and according to Todd, Sutter was convinced that California's 'unavoidable' destiny would prove very much to his advantage. (There is some evidence that the Mexican authorities were becoming increasingly alarmed by rumours of Sutter's connivance with American agitators.) The most recent account of the development of the West (Richard A. Bartlett's The New Country, Oxford, 1974) in a sense continues this tradition by analysing the Gold Rush in terms of the foundation of frontier democracy, and the inevitable advantages which statehood brought to those who were lucky enough to be participating in that foundation. Gold was, of course, the beginning of modern California, and was the principal source of her wealth for at least a generation after 1848. The gold seekers came in just after the treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo (the treaty which in effect recognised the inevitability of the sweep across the Continent), and for the first score of months after the great rush of 1849, there was hardly the shadow of government control there. Political scientists and sociologists have always been intrigued at the remarkable way in which mining communities, exploiting streams and digging up lands and constructing jerry-built hovels, liveries, saloons, assay offices, and hotels where they had no legal ownership, ran their affairs by means of buckskin-and-flannel governments that had evolved of themselves. Surely a part of their success lay in the general prosperity of the thousands who flocked in. It was equality to begin with, or very nearly so, and every man for himself; and for a time, almost any hard-working man could make a living. In such a free society the man with ingenuity could greatly enhance his chances by applying his resourcefulness to the conditions at hand. For Bartlett, the Gold Rush has 'something unreal, storybookish about it', and he demonstrates the significance of the sudden and overwhelming\n\nTHE EUROPEAN WESTERN: SUTTER AND HIS GOLD\n\nresponse that the discovery of gold produced, by a suitably 'storybookish' example. James Marshall, the man credited with the discovery, was not Spanish, nor Mexican, nor a mountain man, nor, as far as we know, had he ever trapped or hunted. Marshall was instead one of those thousands of men, most of them nameless, who drifted west with the times. He and thousands of others were like dust devils, whirling hither and yon in search of a destiny they rarely contemplated and never wholly understood. Probably they sought primarily the One Big Chance, but their restlessness, one suspects, is not wholly explained by the lust for great riches. There must have been present the elements of curiosity and adventure too. Call it some aspect of the human spirit. What else explains Marshall and his kind? . . : Drifting men of Marshall's type, for whom the entire West had become a piece of real estate to hunt over and exploit — these were the kind of people who first felt a faster pulse at the news of gold. By the summer of 1848 settlers, sailors and soldiers, Mexicans — everyone in California it seemed — was after gold. But it was Marshall's kind who constituted the vanguard. So, the story of the forty-niners tells us much about the origins of 'buckskin-and-flannel governments', and about the spirit which enabled American drifters like Marshall to endure such hardships for a destiny they never wholly understood. The fall of a charlatan like Sutter seems a tiny price to pay. Between 1925 and 1936, three European artists (of radically different political persuasions) saw in the Sutter story a chance to relate the classic 'Western' to Old World cultural and socio-political concerns of the moment. The clash between the 'storybook' account of the Gold Rush, and the allegory of Sutter's rise to fame, provided them with a perfect opportunity to view the 'Western' from a European perspective. In 1925, the French novelist, poet and intellectual 'Blaise Cendrars' (FrédéricLouis Sausser) published L'Or. La Merveilleuse Histoire du General Johann August Suter. Cendrars' novel was an attempt, in the words of one critic, to 'seize the world of travel and marvellous adventure with the speed, and at the unusual angles, of a cinema camera'. (Cendrars had collaborated with Abel Gance, and was keen to explore the possibilities of what he called 'a cinematic use of lan-\n\n5\n\nguage'.) This was translated into American a year later as Sutter's Gold. In 1930, the Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein (who was visiting Hollywood at the time) made Cendrars' novel into a screenplay for Paramount; the film was never shot, but the screenplay (written 'with some help' from Ivor Montagu and Grigori Alexandrov, Eisenstein's co-director on some of his most famous Soviet features of the 1920s), entitled Sutter's Gold, together with Eisenstein's sketches for its shooting, have survived. In 1936, the Tyrolean film-maker Luis Trenker (then an ardent supporter of the Nazi regime) made Der Kaiser von Kalifornien (The Emperor of California), also based on Cendrars' L'Or. In the same year, Hollywood's 'reply' came in the form of Sutter's Gold, a film made by James Cruze for Universal Studios. A French novel, a screenplay by the most inventive of Soviet directors, a Nazi propaganda film, and a classic Hollywood Western by one of the founding fathers of the genre, who had already made The Covered Wagon and The Pony Express — the story of Sutter's gold, in all its various incarnations, is a unique example of what happens to a classic Western in the hands of those who attempt to relate it to 'alien' views about politics and society, and there is even a standard Hollywood account for comparison. It thus provides a useful context for studying the European Western. The story had obvious appeal for Cendrars, Eisenstein and Trenker: in addition to the 'travelogue' aspects (Sutter's odyssey), it contained the symbolic ingredients for a critique of unrestrained American capitalism, for an analysis of the relationship between European cultural values and the myth of the frontier, and for a close look at the values of popular Hollywood cinema. Hollywood could not cope with the Eisenstein version — but James Cruze (whose career was on the skids) was given the chance to 'reply', by presenting Sutter as the central character in a traditional Western drama. Of course, these European artists did not decide to adapt Sutter's Gold in vacuo: in each case, there was an appropriate cinematic tradition, and a structure within the home film industry which made the productions feasible. These structures — sharply differentiated by the type of relationship which existed between the political regime in power and the established means of film production — did, however, all have one major characteristic in common: they favoured some 'comment' on the value-\n\n6\n\nTHE EUROPEAN WESTERN: SUTTER AND HIS GOLD\n\nsystem of Hollywood"
