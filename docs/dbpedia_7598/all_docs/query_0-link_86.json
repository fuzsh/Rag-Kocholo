The Spaghetti Western, as a transatlantic meeting place, is of necessity a cinematic category to be considered in international contexts, the hundreds of films which the category comprises documenting shifts in Italy’s cultural outlook, as the reference points of American popular culture became ever more visible in the post-war years. Yet an Italo-American focus tells only a fraction of a story in which myriad strands of influence converged within, and continue to emanate from, this amorphous group of films. Spaghetti Western is a classification constantly in transit between cultures, genres and conceptions of taste, and its patterns of production, distribution and consumption display diverse acts of ‘border crossing’ and translation. By appraising a broad selection of films – from the internationally famed works of Sergio Leone to the cult cachet of Sergio Corbucci and the more obscure outputs of such directors as Giuseppe Colizzi and Ferdinando Baldi – this volume seeks to reconsider the cultural significance of the Italian Western, its position within global cinema and its continuing trends of reception and appropriation around the globe. Scholarly volumes are always at pains to stress their timeliness in relation to trends within their broader disciplines, and in this respect this one is no different. What Mette Hjort has termed Film Studies’ ‘transnational turn’ (2010: 13) highlights a desire to understand the ways in which cinema has offered a means to document the movement of peoples and identities across perceived cultural and spatial boundaries. A medium whose development through the twentieth and twenty-first centuries has coincided with a marked historical fluctuation of inherited borders, cinema has been pertinently described by Tom Conley as ‘the privileged geopolitical medium . . . at once local and global’ (2013: x). Thus, what might at first appear to be a merely modish application of ‘trans-’ prefixes – ‘transnational’, ‘transcultural’, ‘translocal’ – in fact signifies wider\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 1\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n2\n\naustin fisher\n\nhistorical approaches to cinematic output that scrutinise nationallyconstituted discourses and thereby seek to understand the complexities of specific cultural-political moments. Even such a seemingly nationallybased discipline as Italian Film Studies increasingly embraces these concerns, recognising and interrogating the unstable, movable nature of the ‘national’ referent in a globalised era, and thereby questioning notions of a local industry talking to or for its nation state. The Journal of Italian Cinema and Media Studies, for example, introduces its inaugural edition with a mission statement that places Italian cinema ‘within the realm of a post-national and trans-cultural debate . . . transcending geo-ethnic land and sea borders and moving away from merely celebratory local cinematic experiences’ (Laviosa 2013: 4). Such undertakings are also characteristic of recent scholarship around the Western genre, whose well-worn tropes are increasingly studied for how they have been decoupled from their supposed roots in US culture. Multifarious strands of international Westerns are being repositioned within a polycentric cultural landscape (rather than one approaching the USA as the genre’s ‘centre’), revealing the Western to be a malleable space of cultural blending that has traversed national and political boundaries. Recent research into how the genre has obtained diverse meanings upon contact with particular historical, cultural and political contexts includes volumes edited by Miller and Van Riper (2013), Klein et al. (2012) and Higgins et al. (2015), along with special journal editions of Frames (Iverson 2013) and Transformations (Cooke et al. 2014). As Miller and Van Riper explain, issues central to the Western’s dynamics such as imperialism, industrialisation, the relationship between individual and community, and the rights of indigenous peoples are not unique to the USA or to the late nineteenth century: ‘They were, and are, part of the shared experience of all expansionist nations, and the international appeal of the Western rests, in part, on the potential for the historical experiences of one culture to resonate with audiences from another’ (Miller and Van Riper 2013: xiv). The approach summarised in the quotation above makes a valuable point about the genre’s cross-cultural appeal, but still positions the Western genre as one that originated in the USA, to then be embraced and adapted by other cultures: ‘a genre with its roots on the latenineteenth-century American frontier . . . relocated to other frontiers’ (Miller and Van Riper 2013: xvi). Neil Campbell goes a step further down this transnational route, arguing that ‘the West’ breaks away from notions of ‘rootedness’ in the USA altogether, constantly renewing and transforming itself in various cultural forms. Campbell applies Mary Louise Pratt’s notion of interlocking ‘contact zones’ to escape\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 2\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n3\n\napproaches that identify a single point of generic origin: ‘To examine the West in the twenty-first century is to think of it as always already transnational, a more routed and complex rendition, a traveling concept whose meanings move between cultures, crossing, bridging, and intruding simultaneously’ (Campbell 2008: 4). Indeed, this line of enquiry is now flourishing, with recent scholarship following Campbell’s lead by examining how the Western narrative format and its various iconographies have been deployed for the negotiation of multifarious national and sub-cultural identities since before Hollywood’s golden age. To cite just a few notable examples, this includes studies of pre-World War I Westerns shot in the French Camargue region (Wessels 2014), socialistera Hungarian Westerns (Simonyi 2013), Latin American ‘Third’ Westerns (Wessels 2015) and Australian outback Westerns (Cooke 2014, Wessels 2014). Such approaches allow for a broader picture to emerge: one of alternative trajectories from generic building blocks, which emerge from no single point of origin and thus result not in American Westerns and copies of (or reactions to) American Westerns, but instead countless global offshoots of a format that has by the whims of historical circumstance become known as a ‘Western’ due to the economic hegemony of the USA in the first half of the twentieth century.1 By focusing on the globally-oriented origins and legacies of Westerns produced or co-produced by Italian studios, this volume seeks to engage with these evolving fields of enquiry, addressing routes of cultural, political and ethnic relocation that lie at the heart of the ‘Spaghetti’ Western phenomenon. By analysing these films’ processes of production, distribution and consumption as sites of dynamic cultural exchange wherein supposed boundaries become blurred, the book aims to widen the sociohistorical debate around this much-loved filone.2 It is for precisely this reason that this volume does not reject the USA as one of its contextual reference points (as do Miller and Van Riper, for example, whose remit is ‘Westerns produced outside the United States’ (2013: xvi)), since this would paradoxically serve to perpetuate a US-centric perspective by dividing the Western into ‘American’ and ‘others’. If, as Campbell argues, the Western was never firmly moored to US national experience in the first place, then the Spaghetti Westerns must be considered a constituent part of this continuum, rather than an anomalous reaction to a founding text. Though the Italian Western has become one of the most culturally visible variants to contemporary eyes, it is nevertheless one of many manifestations of an innately transcultural genre. In my own past work on the Spaghetti Western (Fisher 2010, 2011), I approached the films as historical documents, following well-established fields of academic enquiry that analyse film’s role\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 3\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n4\n\naustin fisher\n\nin negotiating, questioning and shaping conceptions of the past and its relationship to the present.3 I specifically investigated the connection between the politicised strands of this filone that emerged in the second half of the 1960s and the contemporaneous ideological ferments that were erupting in Italian factories and university campuses, in response to global events in the various theatres of conflict at the height of the Cold War. The function of such films as A Bullet for the General (Quién sabe?, Damiano Damiani, 1966), Face to Face (Faccia a faccia, Sergio Sollima, 1967) and Tepepa (Giulio Petroni, 1969) was, for the purposes of my study, one of registering the immediate concerns, confusions and conflicts of the films’ time and place. Yet, particularly given the extraordinarily long and influential reception tail of the Spaghetti Western, such an approach raises an important question: if this filone is indeed to be read as a document of ‘time and place’, which times and which places? The immediate concerns of 1960s and 1970s Italy are certainly pivotal to an understanding of these films’ cultural-political significance, but so too are their varied antecedents and legacies in Italian neorealism, French comic books, Japanese chanbara films, Bollywood, Eastern Bloc film distribution and the contemporary cinema of Quentin Tarantino.4 It is to be hoped that, by examining these and other disparate contexts, this volume will go some way to enriching our comprehension of this broad vista. This is by no means to say that scholarship on the Spaghetti Western has hitherto been manacled to the concerns of a narrowly Italian milieu: far from it. Dimitris Eleftheriotis influentially approached this filone as one that highlights ‘the accelerated mobility of cultural products around the world and their increasing detachment from national contexts’ (Eleftheriotis 2001: 98). Indeed, the various scholarly trends outlined above increasingly converge to throw light on the diverse contexts of the Spaghetti Western’s transnational production histories, reception patterns and afterlives. David MartinJones’s examination of Django Kill . . . If You Live, Shoot! (Se sei vivo, spara!, Giulio Questi, 1967), for example, considers how the film spoke to diverse shared experiences of the Cold War era, and thus offered ‘open-ended transnational political resonances for different audiences around the world’ (Martin-Jones 2011: 180). In a similar vein, Christopher Robé analyses the Spaghetti Western’s politicised strands for how they provide an understanding of cultural flows between ‘First’ and ‘Third’ world markets (Robé 2014). Michelle Cho’s study of The Good, the Bad, the Weird (Choŭnnom, Nappŭnnom, Isanghannom, Kim Jee-woon, 2008) adopts a more culturally-specific approach, by examining the film’s merging of overt\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 4\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nFigure I.1: The Good, the Bad, the Weird (2008) deploys Spaghetti Western stylistics within a Manchurian action schema.\n\nquotations from Sergio Leone’s ‘Dollars’ trilogy with equally explicit references to Manchurian action films such as Break Up the Chain (Yonghwa chusik hoesa, Lee Manhee, 1971). Cho compellingly links The Good, the Bad, the Weird’s historical setting in Manchuria during Korea’s period of Japanese occupation to the region’s broader status as a liminal frontier land with a ‘hallowed position of being one of the Korean independence movement’s sites of development [and] an important symbolic role as the birthplace of Korean nationalism’ (Cho 2015: 53). Thus, in this context, the Spaghetti Western’s ‘transnational’ legacy is one of co-optation for the task of negotiating an East Asian national identity. Cho’s approach highlights an important point: that, while the analysis of Italian Westerns’ innately ‘transnational’ aspects provides insight into the films’ ongoing global significance, it is through situating particular manifestations of this process in their historical and cultural ‘moments’ (locally, regionally, nationally or industrially) that we can best obtain a meaningful apperception of this point. If the ‘trans-’ prefix is to avoid becoming a merely trendy scholarly accoutrement, it should work to aid understanding of complexities within specific national, local and sub-cultural contexts. As Will Higbee and Song Hwee Lim have argued, a ‘critical transnationalism’ is one that interrogates ‘how these film-making activities negotiate with the national on all levels – from cultural policy to financial sources, from the multiculturalism of difference to how it reconfigures the nation’s image of itself’ (Higbee and Lim 2010: 18). This volume can only scratch the surface of the Spaghetti\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 5\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n6\n\naustin fisher\n\nWestern’s multifarious paths of hybridity and its continuing global reach across perceived boundaries of genre, nation and identity. The analysis offered in these pages, however, seeks to advance this field of enquiry by offering a set of case studies grounded firmly in their historical, cultural and political circumstances. The volume opens with an extended piece from the undisputed father of scholarly enquiry into the Spaghetti Western, Sir Christopher Frayling. Frayling’s seminal book Spaghetti Westerns: Cowboys and Europeans from Karl May to Sergio Leone (1981) has surely been a key inspiration for all subsequent serious analysis of this filone: this one included. It is therefore apt that his latest work opens proceedings, both providing new perspectives on the filone’s cross-cultural significance and offering methodological challenges for the chapters that follow. Four sections then progress from the Spaghetti Western’s antecedents to its legacies. In Part I, two chapters uncovering hitherto overlooked inspirations and influences (from post-war neorealism and nineteenth-century literature) illuminate the complex interweaving of cultural reference points in Italy prior to the 1960s. Part II then considers the diverse ways in which this filone addressed issues of ethnicity and identity through three chapters that reconsider its position vis-à-vis the global politics of its era. Part III interrogates oft-drawn parallels between the Spaghetti Western and Asian cinema, by charting complex routes of reinterpretation that belie linear readings of cultural influence, and by introducing the perspective of the filone’s extensive appropriation in India. Finally, Part IV assesses three further examples of how the Spaghetti Western’s legacies have been negotiated as its global distribution left its mark on East German censorship, on French comic books, and, finally, on the contemporary Hollywood Western. Christopher Frayling’s chapter charts a personal journey, continuing his pioneering work questioning conceptions of ‘authenticity’ by looking at how Italian Westerns responded to well-established ethnic images within Hollywood Westerns which were themselves ‘inauthentic’ in the first place: those of ‘Irishness’. Considering whether the contemporaneity of Ireland’s ‘Troubles’ with both a growing fascination with anti-colonialist movements in Western Europe and the zenith of the Italian Western might have played a role, Frayling investigates the hitherto overlooked issue of how images of Irishness filtered through into Italy’s version of the genre. As Italians forged their own interpretation of the Western myth, transposing numerous elements from Hollywood while cutting the genre adrift from its nation-building imperative, Frayling asks, in what form did the Hollywood genre’s ubiquitous negotiation with a stereotyped Irish ethnicity survive, and what significance\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 6\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\ndid this hold in this cultural moment? He discovers, intriguingly, that a secondary (or even tertiary) conception of ‘Irishness’ abounds in the Spaghetti Western. Taking Sergio Leone’s Duck, You Sucker! (Giù la testa, 1971) as a key case study, Frayling charts the labyrinthine intertextual journey through Hollywood’s representations of Irish culture on which Leone and his crew embarked: most pertinently, through the films of John Ford. He concludes that in the Italian Western, ‘Irishness’ exists as part of a larger signifying structure surrounding a reworked, magnified and updated cinematic imaginary, rather than a purposeful reference to contemporary events in Ireland. Frayling thus lays down a gauntlet to beware of drawing direct parallels between films and the contemporary events that surround them too readily. Part I opens with Pasquale Iannone’s study of Western tropes in Italian cinema’s ‘neorealist’ phase. Taking as his key case studies In the Name of the Law (In nome della legge, Pietro Germi, 1949) and The Bandit of Tacca del Lupo (Il brigante di Tacca del Lupo, Pietro Germi, 1952), Iannone explores the complex ways in which Germi worked references to American genres into his work, thereby debunking approaches presupposing an Italian neorealism separated from ‘popular’ cinema, and demonstrating an oft-overlooked precursor to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 1960s and 1970s. Identifying in Germi’s two films a representational equivalence between the Italian South and the American West, this chapter charts a lineage of tales of banditry that blended the international and the local. Aliza Wong then identifies the influence on Spaghetti Western director Sergio Sollima of Emilio Salgari’s nineteenth-century hero Sandokan. Drawing a detailed line of continuity from this iconic character of Italian children’s literature to the postcolonial heroes of Sollima’s westerns all’italiana, Wong illustrates a genealogy of ‘Other-ed’ hero archetypes who, through their resistance to imperialist might, were designed to appeal to revolutionary sentiments within Italian national identity from the Risorgimento onwards. By extending the focus to Sollima’s own ‘Sandokan’ television series, Wong’s analysis also identifies a melding of the Spaghetti Western’s anarchic borderlands and the primitive wilds of South-East Asia, through which Sollima sought to expound anti-imperialist rhetoric. This chapter thus uncovers continuities in imagined, exotic spaces offering Italians a politicised outlet for fantasy fulfilment. Part II begins with David Hyman and Patrick Wynne’s response to my analysis of the popular politics of the Spaghetti Western (Fisher 2011). Taking A Professional Gun (Il mercenario, Sergio Corbucci, 1968) as their key example, they argue that the ‘incoherence’ I identified as a political weakness of this filone’s ‘insurgency’ variant is rather a\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 7\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n8\n\naustin fisher\n\nmanifestation of decontextualised transnational bricolage that, by blurring the boundary between ‘text’ and ‘paratext’, allows us to appreciate the possibilities open to an audience for creative participation within revolutionary discourses.5 The film is therefore read as a temporal dislocation that exists within images of the Mexican Revolution, and as a conduit through which a plurality of fluid meanings open up for the fomenting of a revolutionary sensibility. Lee Broughton’s chapter then offers an alternative take on representations of ethnicity in the Spaghetti Western. While much has been written about this filone’s portrayal of Mexican ethnicity, this chapter examines its representation of African Americans, and asks what this might tell us about the politics of race in Italy and the USA in the 1960s. Specifically, Broughton identifies in the films of Giuseppe Colizzi a lineage from the commedia dell’arte and Mikhail Bakhtin’s notion of the ‘carnivalesque’, through which the Spaghetti Western facilitates an inclusive racial discourse that found a particular resonance in an era of mass protest. Part II then ends with Mikel J. Koven’s study of this filone’s extraordinarily influential afterlife, interrogating a critical commonplace that labels the cinema of Quentin Tarantino (as well as that of his collaborators such as Miike Takashi) ‘postmodern’. Examining the precise implications of this term, Koven identifies in Tarantino’s curation of the Spaghettis’ afterlife a particular kind of postmodern engagement, examining Django Unchained (2012) not as reductive pastiche (as many critics hold), but rather as an ironic ‘language of grindhouse cinema allusions’. The chapter thus identifies, charts and examines a complex web of references traversing cultural boundaries, which ultimately provides a subversive ‘paracinematic’ discourse. Part III appraises three overlapping instances of appropriation in Asian film industries. Firstly, Thomas Klein revisits the Japanese chanbara, or ‘sword film’. Challenging notions that focus solely on the kinship between the Japanese format and the US Western, Klein instead charts the chanbara’s relationship to the Italian version. In the equivalence between the outlaw heroes of the Spaghetti Western and the ‘sword film’, he identifies documents of Italy’s and Japan’s respective processes of post-war Americanisation. Ivo Ritzer then takes the Italian Western’s iterative negotiation with Asian identities as a case study to chart multidimensional routes of cultural transfer. Deploying scholarly approaches around the ‘transnational’, he frames the Italian Western as a junction in a global network of cultural exchange, both borrowing from and influencing Asian cinematic discourses. Using The Warrior’s Way (Sngmoo Lee, 2010) as a key example, he therefore sees the Italian\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 8\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n9\n\nWestern’s most significant legacy to be its decoupling of the Western from its ideological and historical reference points, freeing the format up for myriad, heterogeneous cultural contexts. To conclude Part III, Iain Robert Smith continues this methodological focus on processes of cultural transfer, by examining how the Spaghetti Western has played a part in the negotiation of cosmopolitan identities within Indian cinema. By focusing on the network of transnational borrowings that resulted in the ‘Curry’ or ‘Masala’ Western, Smith goes beyond ‘unidirectional models of cross-cultural influence’ to illuminate the networks through which cultures overlap, and the transformations that result from combinations, borrowings and exchanges across national contexts. He also compellingly enters into the debates outlined at the start of this Introduction, eschewing approaches that interpret ‘international’ Westerns as translations of the genre designed to conform to the specificities of local cultural practices. Deploying a memetic model of cultural hybridisation, he argues for close attention to the specifics of historical context, while warning against the privileging of national signifiers and the attendant misrepresentation of complex negotiations with global cultural flows and exchanges. Part IV opens with William Grady holding a common point of throwaway critical reference for the Spaghetti Western – the comic book – up to close scrutiny. Relocating this filone in a continuum of subversive, surreal treatments of the Wild West, Grady identifies a more substantive alienation effect in both the Spaghetti Western and the Western comic book, whereby familiar generic space is ‘made strange’ in both formats. Further, by assessing the Spaghetti’s influence on later comic books from around the world, Grady’s study illuminates another transcultural exchange that took place around this nomadic filone. Focusing in particular on the French bande dessinée, the chapter charts a rich history of transnational negotiation with the Wild West. In the Blueberry series, Grady presents a fascinating tension between appropriation of, and resistance to, US popular culture, making reference to French national crises while becoming mediated through the surreality of the Spaghetti Western. Rosemary Stott then illuminates the Spaghetti Western’s hitherto under-researched patterns of release and ‘official’ reception in the German Democratic Republic, identifying a conduit for transcultural currents that were crossing the Iron Curtain at the height of the Cold War. Taking Once Upon a Time in the West (C’era una volta il West, Sergio Leone, 1968) as a case study, her chapter uncovers a process of international cultural transfer causing this object of cultural production to be repositioned as it\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 9\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n10\n\naustin fisher\n\nentered a new, state-controlled, reception context. Stott’s key insight concerns the film’s borderline acceptability for the East German censors, which marked a shift in the selection criteria for foreign imports upon its release in 1981. Once again, we see the Spaghetti Western providing us with insights into larger processes of cultural-political change, as this filone obtains fresh meanings in a new cultural backdrop: this time, one of ideologically-driven aversion to the Classical Western genre. This case study therefore offers insights into the peculiarities of this cultural moment, when East German authorities were juggling the appeal of Western culture with socialist ideological imperatives. Finally, the volume closes with Pete Falconer’s interrogation of the ever-disputed ‘death’ of the Western. Considering how the genre and its attendant tropes have functioned since its departure from mainstream production, Falconer uses the Spaghetti Western as a touchstone for understanding the implications for how the Western more broadly is produced and understood to the present day. By analysing varying levels of familiarity with the genre’s traditions, Falconer holds that the Italian Western makes the genre ‘strange’, and alienates the viewer from the world of the Wild West. This final chapter thus makes a compelling case for how the seemingly familiar codes of the Western have in fact been rendered alien in differing ways upon contact with various contexts, and thereby offers insights into the representational practices of twenty-first-century Westerns such as Appaloosa (Ed Harris, 2008), 3:10 to Yuma (James Mangold, 2007) and True Grit (Ethan and Joel Cohen, 2010): films that insistently place themselves in a longgone past through painstaking attention to historical details. Falconer’s intervention illuminates the extent to which the Spaghetti Western has come to hold sway over the dominant lexicon of the Western genre’s cultural memory. Falconer’s chapter is therefore an apt note on which to end this volume. Throughout the book, the Spaghetti Western is approached as a unit of culture that has traversed space and time, encompassing temporal journeys as well as physical ones within ‘transcultural’ readings. Taken together, and through their very diversity, the various chapters attest to this filone’s survival instinct, as it has adapted and morphed in response to multifarious cultural conditions, and continues to do so in an era when familiarity with the larger Western genre and its traditions can no longer be assumed. This collection therefore seeks to advance scholarly debates around both the significance of Italy’s popular cinema of the 1960s and 1970s and its ongoing influences on our contemporary culture.\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 10\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nintroduction\n\n11\n\nnotes 1. Iain Robert Smith’s chapter in this volume further explores this scholarly trend with specific reference to the Indian ‘Curry’ or ‘Masala’ Western, and situates the tendency within the Western’s ‘cultural roots controversy’ as outlined by Christopher Frayling ([1981] 1998: 121–40), which branded international Westerns as culturally ‘inauthentic’. 2. The word ‘filone’ is generally preferred to ‘genre’ in scholarship around popular Italian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s, as a way of distinguishing this industrial context from that of Hollywood. This of course runs the risk of making rather broad generalisations about both the popular cinema of the USA and the scholarly field of ‘genre studies’, both of which are vast and heterogeneous: a trap into which I have fallen in the past (Fisher 2011: 36). This caveat notwithstanding, ‘filone’ remains a useful descriptor for this set of culturally- and temporallyspecific production and distribution practices, in which numerous trends of very rapid replication would ebb and flow according to the whims of the market, often existing for only a short period before ceasing to be profitable. 3. The work of Marc Ferro ([1977] 1988) and Pierre Sorlin (1980), for example, influentially investigated how cinematic representations of the past illuminate films’ contemporary condition. 4. While my own work has considered the uses made of the Spaghetti Western by Quentin Tarantino, this was done purely to back up an argument that, divorced from their immediate contexts, the films are stripped of their intended political meanings (Fisher 2011: 193–201). I now consider this to be an oversimplification, since detailed analysis of the cultural moments in which the films have been distributed and received is just as valuable in the appraisal of their ongoing cultural significance. Had Django Unchained (2012) been released before I wrote the book in question, I like to think that I would have approached the subject somewhat differently. Mikel Koven does precisely this in these pages. 5. This is indeed a justified criticism of my previous work. I argued too forcefully and too defensively for the necessity of political coherence within the films’ texts. Hyman and Wynne’s chapter therefore offers a valuable entry point into a re-evaluation of the Spaghetti Western’s politics.\n\nreferences Campbell, Neil (2008), The Rhizomatic West: Representing the American West in a Transnational, Global, Media Age, Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press.

The Hollywood Western is the real thing; the Italian product is ersatz: an example of hybridity, with Hollywood as the original plant. But what of ‘inauthentic’ Italian Westerns, if such they were, responding to images within Hollywood Westerns which themselves were palpably inauthentic in the first place? This chapter started life with the thought that images of Irish people in Italian Westerns might be an example of just such a phenomenon: part of a hall of mirrors, rather than of ‘other’ and ‘self’; a reflection of a reflection, which is not how the issue of identity is usually addressed. As Joseph M. Curran wrote in Hibernian Green on the Silver Screen: The Irish have indeed lost most of their ethnic distinctiveness in today’s America, but a good deal of what has been lost can be found in the movies. Despite their factual distortion, movies since the days of Edison reveal a lot about how America perceived the Irish, how that perception gradually changed and what role moviemakers had in changing it. (Curran 1989: 121) Maybe this was a case of a perception of a perception . . . Then I read three texts about the role of Irish immigrants in the myths and realities of the American Wild West: the book How the\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 13\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n14\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nIrish Won the West by broadcaster Myles Dungan (Dungan 2006, 1–10, 160–254) and the articles ‘Seeing is Believing’ and ‘Land Beyond the Waves’ in A Mass for Jesse James by cultural commentator Fintan O’Toole (O’Toole 1990: 16–22, 82–5); plus an analysis of the main differences, within cultural history, between ideas of ‘the West’ in America (a land of promise, which was there to be ‘won’, once upon a time in the west) and ideas of ‘the West’ in Ireland during the Irish Literary Revival (a land which was lost, and waiting to be rediscovered, once upon a time when there was the west) – ‘Synge, Country and Western: the Myth of the West in Irish and American Culture’ by the cultural theorist Luke Gibbons (Gibbons 1996: 23–36). Then someone sent me a cutting from the Irish Daily Star of 30 January 1990, headlined ‘Gunslinger Clint Eastwood is descended from the Lord Mayor of Dublin’: ‘Clint Eastwood is believed to be descended from Alderman John Eastwood, mayor of Dublin in 1679’, thus ‘on the opposite side of the fence to the stubble-jawed outlaw of the Spaghetti Westerns’. The elision of history (1679) and myth (‘Gunslinger Clint Eastwood’) – not to mention the casual inaccuracy (‘stubblejawed outlaw’) – seemed by now to be part of the story being told. Maybe the Man with No Name was Irish . . . It occurred to me, after thinking about these pieces, that it would be interesting to look more closely at the depiction of Irish people in Italian Westerns rather than the more usually studied American ones: after all, both Italy and the Republic of Ireland were largely Catholic countries; the Irish historically played a major role in the evolution of the urban frontier in America – sometimes as the sons and daughters of the gangs of New York – as well as in entrepreneurship on the Western frontier and in the US Cavalry during the ‘Indian Wars’; Irish-American filmmakers (most notably, John Ford and Raoul Walsh) and actors (such as William S. Hart, Harry Carey Sr and Tim McCoy) had made decisive contributions to the American Western genre in film (see Brennan and O’Neill 2007: 66–78, 104–14); and, where topicality or timeliness was concerned, there was the prominence being given in the media to the ‘Troubles’ in the North of Ireland from autumn 1968 onwards – precisely the same time as the most radical of the Italian Westerns were being made and released. Another North, another South (see Bew and Gillespie 1999: 2–46). Actually, the headlines started a little earlier with the blowing-up in March 1966 of the top half of the Nelson Pillar in O’Connell Street in Dublin – a monument which had somehow survived the Easter Rising of 1916 and the subsequent Civil War – by a splinter group of disenfranchised Republicans. This attracted considerably more publicity than the official 50th anniversary of the Rising itself.\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 14\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n15\n\nOctober and November 1968: the Civil Rights marches in Derry, which ‘opened up’ the modern Ulster crisis. January 1969: the transition from Civil Rights as the key issue to age-old nationalist and religious animosities. August 1969: the sharp deterioration into sectarian conflict and the decision to send in British troops. December 1969– January 1970: the split within the IRA between the ‘Officials’ and the ‘Provisionals’ – the name being a deliberate echo of the Easter 1916 Proclamation of the ‘Provisional Government of the Irish Republic’. April 1970: the first major clash between Nationalists and the British army. June 1970: the first military action by the Provisionals. August 1971: the introduction of internment without trial. September 1971: the hundredth victim killed. January 1972: thirteen men shot by members of the Parachute Regiment during a Civil Rights rally in Derry on ‘Bloody Sunday’, with heated arguments about who fired first and a steep rise in recruitment to the Provisionals. The annual Derry marches to commemorate the Easter Rising – in March 1970 and April 1971– proved particular flashpoints. In short, the ‘Troubles’, and the contested meanings and legacy of Easter 1916, were very much in the news on the continent of Europe in the late 1960s. In Italy, the events listed above tended to be treated in the press as a struggle for liberation: on a par with simultaneous struggles in what was then known as the Third World, only closer to home.2 Maybe there would be some reflection of this in the Italian Westerns, matching the ways in which these films reflected other concerns of the New Left, as studied by Austin Fisher (Fisher 2011: 77–160) and myself (Frayling [1981] 1998: 217–44). Fisher (2011: 151) cites the French commentator Gérard Chaliand writing about youthful versions of the New Left at the time. His account was based on eyewitness observations: The anti-imperialist movement which condemned the wars waged by the West was, apparently paradoxically, fascinated by armed struggle and guerrilla warfare. This young left absorbed pell-mell into its imagination fragments of the Spanish Civil War [especially from the film For Whom the Bell Tolls], the October Revolution [Eisenstein’s film October was reissued in 1967], the resistance to Nazism [several directors of Italian Westerns recalled this], the Mexican Revolution, the Long March [in China] and Che Guevara . . . In France after 1968, Third Worldism, hitherto involving relatively few people, capitalised on the recruits from the May Movement . . . [In] West Germany and Italy, terrorist-type movements made their appearance modelled on [the Latin American model of] the Tupamaros in Uruguay . . . The Red Army faction,\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 15\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n16\n\nchristopher frayling the Baader-Meinhof Group and the Red Brigades thought that they could use a spiral of violence and repression to mobilise the masses by showing them that the democratic state is in fact repressive and unpopular. Great names lent their voices (Sartre, Genet) to . . . this mishmash of populism and anti-Imperialist Third Worldism. (Chaliand 1989: 217–21)\n\nIt was a time when there was much talk of ‘fascism’ in the Italian political establishment; of Togliatti’s ‘historic compromise’ between socialism and the middle class; an increasing disillusionment with formal politics and at the same time discussion about the ‘imperialism’ of American forces in South-East Asia and in some countries of Latin America. A time when the writings of Frantz Fanon – especially The Wretched of the Earth and Black Skin, White Masks – were very fashionable on university and college campuses, as were the recently translated writings of Herbert Marcuse, and of others who argued that since the working class in Western Europe and America had become so thoroughly absorbed into capitalism, the political energy had shifted to capitalism’s supplying bases in the Third World. In Western Europe, there was the ‘rivoluzione mancata’, the revolution that might have been; in the Third World, there was the possibility of real revolution. Maybe there was one about to happen in Ireland. There were earnest seminars on the neglected importance of culture in the early writings of Karl Marx, such as the Grundrisse. A time when the famous poster of Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara, with his beard, long hair, beret and defiant gaze – known to many, after Sergeant Pepper, as ‘Che in the sky with jacket’ – was pinned to student walls all over Europe, sometimes next to Clint Eastwood with his poncho, stubble and cigar, and soon to be joined by Bob Dylan in his ‘outlaw’ phase on the cover of John Wesley Harding. The ‘Che’ photograph, suitably cropped, had been published and widely distributed for the first time by the left-wing Italian publisher Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, without crediting the original photographer Alberto ‘Korda’ Diaz Gutiérrez.3 And, finally, it was a time when, according to Jean-Luc Godard’s collaborator J.-P. Gorin, ‘every Marxist on the block wanted to make a Western’. After May 1968, student leader Daniel Cohn-Bendit went to Rome to prepare a ‘left-wing Western . . . about miners on strike, who fight against their masters, about the boss with his gang of thugs who attacks the workers, the workers who take over the mine, and so on. At one point, there was to have been a duel’ (Frayling, 1993: 27). Of course there was. Maybe Ireland should be added to the list of fragments on the minds of some of the generation whom Jean-Luc\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 16\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n17\n\nGodard dubbed the ‘children of Karl Marx and Coca-Cola’. I can remember that after a performance in London by a visiting Italian theatre troupe, in spring 1972, there was a collection on behalf of the Provisional IRA. Perhaps this is more than a question of the image of Irish people in film and popular culture, then: a question, too, of how some Italian films responded to social unrest not at home in Italy (studied by Fisher), but in another corner of Western Europe; social unrest that was topical and – in its civil rights phase at least – presumably of some interest to radical Italian students who were simultaneously demonstrating in the streets of Rome. In other words, if ‘Mexico’ sometimes stood for South-East Asia and Central America in Italian Westerns, and the political stance of a few screenwriters/directors stood for Italian leftwing concerns of the moment, was there a place as well for other (less theoretical) issues from one of the outer reaches of Europe? Were the ‘Troubles’ as fashionable as the other causes in Chaliand’s eclectic list? After all, one Italian Western responded, albeit belatedly, to the assassination of Irish-American President Kennedy – The Price of Power (Il prezzo del potere, Tonino Valerii, 1969) – by transposing the tragic events which took place in Dallas in 1963 to a main street in post-Civil War Dallas in 1881 during the era of Reconstruction: in this, the legacy of the naïve President (a red-haired Van Johnson, ex-matinée idol, of Swedish-Dutch extraction), his race reforms and the gospel of peace, is thwarted by a syndicate of nasty and influential Southern politicians. The main purpose of Dungan’s book is to explore the historical contribution of Irish-born immigrants to rural America in the era depicted in the traditional Western, but he introduces his study by outlining the two basic stereotypes of the Irish – thanks to Hollywood and popular literature – in stories set in nineteenth-century America. First, on the urban frontier, particularly in the eastern cities of Boston and New York, when America was going through her growing pains: the wheeler-dealers of local politics; the corrupt elections on behalf of the Irish Democratic Party and the rise of the Tammany Hall political machine and the local bosses; Catholic Irish in a Protestant American ‘nativist’ culture, and the tensions this created – less a melting-pot than vegetable soup with all the ingredients remaining separate. Dungan writes: The classic image of the nineteenth-century Irish immigrant to the USA is of the peasant fleeing economic and political serfdom and sailing to North America in an unseaworthy ‘coffin ship’ – the indigent vassal on a leaking vessel. He (for the stereotypical\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 17\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n18\n\nchristopher frayling Irish emigrant is male) would arrive in Boston or New York, stick close to his own, settle in an eastern urban ghetto and endure poverty and bigotry at the hands of the dominant WASP culture. He would probably become political fodder for an Irish Democratic Party ward heeler, probably become a trade union activist and his children and grandchildren might, slowly and painstakingly, climb the political and economic ladder. (Dungan 2006: 4–5)\n\nOr they might – according to Hollywood – if they were played by James Cagney, become gangsters, growing up in the crowded Hell’s Kitchen district of the Lower East Side – counselled by a local priest played by Pat O’Brien or Spencer Tracy – both of them . . . Irish Mafia. Cagney’s Tom Powers in The Public Enemy (William A. Wellman, 1931) was based on the real-life Bugs Moran; Vincent ‘Mad Dog’ Coll inspired other gangster films of the era. Or they might work in vaudeville like George M. Cohan, with the sentimental songs of Ernest R. Ball (‘Mother Machree’, ‘When Irish Eyes are Smiling’, ‘A Little Bit of Heaven (Shure They Call It Ireland)’) as background music. Or become pugilists such as ‘Gentleman Jim’ Corbett or John L. Sullivan. Or they might become policemen on the beat – from Riley the Cop (John Ford, 1928) via Lieutenant Finlay in Crossfire (Edward Dmytryk, 1947) to Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (Don Siegel, 1971) – in countless films set on city streets. Several screen Irish joined the armed forces, serving for example in the Fighting 69th in the trenches of the First World War. The prominent role played by Irish Catholics in the Legion of Decency and the post-Code administration helped to ensure that the stereotypes did not get out of hand, and that rags-to-riches stories remained on the whole optimistic.4 Then, on the rural frontier – since ‘a significant percentage didn’t remain on the eastern seaboard’ (Dungan 2006: 5) – where Irish immigrants became working cowboys or railroad workers, sergeants or other ranks in the Far Western outposts of the US Cavalry, having joined the army during the American Civil War. These were the sorts of character played by Victor McLaglen in John Ford’s ‘Cavalry’ trilogy – Sergeant Mulcahy and Sergeant Quincannon – keen on bluster and the bottle, with a short fuse and a taste for slapstick fistfights or ‘donnybrooks’, very sentimental and with a heart of gold. Thirty of the men who died at Little Big Horn were born in Ireland, 140 members of Colonel Custer’s 7th Cavalry – out of a total of 800 – were also Irish, and that is not counting the second-generation immigrants, born in the USA of Irish parents. An officer of the 4th Cavalry observed of his Irish\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 18\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n19\n\ntroops: ‘I prefer the Irish; they were more intelligent and resourceful as a rule’ – which does rather challenge the Fordian stereotype.5 Dungan then looks at some of the Irish individuals who made an important mark – in non-military settings – on the rural frontier: the ‘Silver Kings’ of Virginia City chronicled by Mark Twain, and the ‘Copper Kings’ of Montana, mining entrepreneurs and tycoons; Thomas Fitzpatrick – mountain man, Indian agent and friend of Jedediah Smith; several members of the Donner Party of covered-wagon pioneers, who famously became marooned in the snow of the High Sierras in 1854, with gruesome consequences; Oscar Wilde lecturing the miners in Leadville, Colorado in April 1892 about the decorative arts and being asked by members of his audience ‘who shot’ Benvenuto Cellini; and the courtesan Lola Montez, born either in Limerick in 1818 or in Grange, Co. Sligo in 1821 though she never admitted to either the date or the exact place. The list also includes several of the participants in the ‘Lincoln County War’, in New Mexico in the late 1870s: on one side, Lawrence Murphy from Wexford, James Dolan from Loughrea, Sheriff William Brady from Cavan town and John H. Riley from Kerry, forming the Murphy–Dolan–Riley ranching and retail combine; on the other side the Englishman John Henry Tunstall (from South London), the Scots-Canadian Presbyterian Alexander McSween and, as a Regulator, Henry McCarty or McCarthy or Henry Antrim – better known as Billy the Kid when he changed his name to William Bonney, born in the Five Points of New York City (or maybe, according to some contemporary accounts, in Ireland) to an Irish immigrant family. Very few Hollywood films, says Dungan, have stressed the Irishness – even the England versus Irishness – of the conflict. Only Young Guns (Christopher Cain, 1988) – made when identity politics had moved centre stage – offers an exception, with Jack Palance attempting an Irish accent as Murphy, location filming in New Mexico, Billy played by Emilio Estevez (whose grandmother was Irish and who was the great-grandson of a Famine immigrant), and Terence Stamp as Tunstall (who in fact was shot at the age of twenty-four and was thus an unlikely candidate to become Billy’s kindly surrogate father). Billy the Kid was killed by another Irish-American, Pat Garrett, on 14 July 1881 (Dungan 2006: 206–54). Other Irish celebrities in the West included Captain Thomas Mayne Reid (born in Co. Down), who between 1848 and 1883 wrote seventy adventure novels – many set in the Southwest – including the best-selling The Scalp-Hunters (1860), and in the process became one of the first to mythologise the Far West and its maverick heroes: an Irish Karl May, except that he had actually worked as a fur-trader and\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 19\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n20\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nfought in the Mexican–American War during the decade he spent in America. Add to this Frank Butler, sharpshooter husband and manager of Annie Oakley, who worked with Buffalo Bill for seventeen years, and the character portrayed in the musical Annie Get Your Gun (1946). Buffalo Bill liked to claim Irish ancestry as well. Frank Harris, born in Galway, wrote a semi-autobiographical novel Reminiscences as a Cowboy which formed the basis of Cowboy (Delmer Daves, 1958) with Jack Lemmon in the Greenhorn Harris role as a Chicago hotel clerk who dreams of riding the range. Dungan’s robust study does not include Wild West characters of so-called ‘Scotch-Irish’ extraction such as Davy Crockett (fifteen of those who died in the Alamo were Irish), Kit Carson, Sam Houston and the Civil War General Ulysses S. Grant, and the Confederates Thomas ‘Stonewall’ Jackson and J. E. B. Stuart.6 Dungan is concerned mainly with Catholic immigrants from south of today’s line. The articles by Fintan O’Toole, about A Mass for Jesse James, concern a former parish priest in Asdee near the North Kerry coast who on 4 April every year until 1959 would say a solemn Requiem Mass for the repose of the souls of Frank and Jesse, whose grandfather left the village in 1847 (the year Jesse was born in Montana). The surviving members of the Irish branch of the family, who had stayed in Asdee, would join in the prayers. Jesse, he would remind the congregation, was shot in the back by Bob Ford – also Irish – as he nailed a simple icon of the Virgin Mary to his cabin wall (the James family were, in fact, Protestants). For O’Toole, this strange commemoration was a tribute ‘to the abiding power in Ireland of the images and icons of the American myth’, ‘a dramatised version of someone else’s dramatised version of ourselves’ (O’Toole 1990: 16–22, 82–5).7 The Jesse James Tavern, next door to St Mary’s Church where the Masses were said, still contains colour photographs of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood above the bar. So I wondered if any of this rich mix of history, myth and movie stereotyping – as well as contemporaneous events in the North of Ireland – had somehow filtered into the Italian Western of the 1960s and early 1970s and, if so, in what particular forms. The earliest Spanish and/or Italian Westerns of 1963–5 tended to try to emulate traditional American Westerns – by then an endangered species – in the hope that Italian audiences would think that was what they were. They included The Secret of Captain O’Hara (El secreto del capitán O’Hara, Arturo Ruiz Castillo, 1965), a formulaic cavalry-versus-Indians Western; Buffalo Bill (Buffalo Bill, l’eroe del far west, Mario Costa/John W. Fordson, 1964); Billy the Kid (Fuera de la ley, Léon Klimovsky, 1964)\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 20\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n21\n\nwith Francisco Martínez Celeiro/George Martin in the lead role; and Son of Jesse James (Solo contro tutti, Antonio del Amo, 1965), with Claudio Undari/Robert Hundar. The novelist Alberto Moravia in a January 1967 review article noted that during this early phase of the European Western, the process of ‘Italianisation’ had not yet really begun (Moravia 2010: 645–7). Nor, it should be added, was there anything remotely Irish about the Italian versions of the Billy the Kid and Jesse James legends. The companion-piece to Sergio Leone’s A Fistful of Dollars (Per un pugno di dollari, 1964) – Mario Caiano’s/ Mike Perkins’s Bullets Don’t Argue (Le pistole non discutono, 1964), also produced by Jolly Films – was a reworking of the Billy the Kid and OK Corral stories with Pat Garrett (Rod Cameron) tracking the Clanton brothers George (Angel Aranda) and Billy (Horst Frank) into Mexico. Caiano himself recalled of this film that it was ‘a traditional film that followed all the classic schemes of the American Western’ (Grant 2011: 42–3). Garrett was not presented as Irish-American, but then again he never was in the Hollywood versions either. After this initial phase – and indeed during it – Italian Westerns never showed much interest in the melting-pot of different waves of immigration, or the significance of the Frontier in American political rhetoric, or the promise/winning of the West, or even the sense of a burgeoning community in frontier towns. There was to be no transformation of the desert into a garden. Italian and Spanish filmmakers were detached from these ‘foundation myths’, even when they were emulating Hollywood films. So the image of Irish people was likely to be very different, and for very different purposes – perhaps reflecting/ subverting the predominant Hollywood images for European consumption. One aspect of history they certainly did absorb was the ‘code duello’ – regulating the rituals of pistol duels – which was drawn up in Ireland in 1777. There was certainly no shortage of ritualised duels in Italian Westerns. In researching this, I felt an affinity with another book I had recently been reading: Hogarth’s Blacks: Images of Blacks in Eighteenth Century English Art by Guyanese-born David Dabydeen (1987). When this book was first announced, many art historians were surprised by its title. Black people in Hogarth’s paintings? Surely there were only one or two, and they were in the background. Actually, Dabydeen had found and analysed examples in two dozen paintings – servants, pages, street-vendors, chambermaids, companions and others: it was just that nobody had noticed them before, or if they had they had not considered them worthy of comment. Hogarth’s Blacks started to put this particular record straight.\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 21\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n22\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the use of Irish surnames: in Sergio Leone’s Westerns, Baby ‘Red’ Cavanagh (his first Irishman with curly red hair in For a Few Dollars More (Per qualche dollaro in più, 1965), in league with a crooked sheriff), Bill Carson and Arch Stanton (the name next to the grave) in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo, 1966), not to mention Sean Mallory in Duck, You Sucker (Giù la testa, 1971) and Jimmy O’Donnell the Union organiser played by Treat Williams in Once Upon a Time in America (1984). The name ‘Mallory’ was most likely derived from the Gregory Peck character, the mountaineer Captain Keith Mallory, in The Guns of Navarone (J. Lee Thompson, 1961), and it led in Italy to My Name is Mallory (Il mio nome è Mallory . . . M come morte, Mario Moroni, 1971) with the American Robert Woods in the title role. Once Upon a Time in America, in its earliest pre-production phase 1967–9, was to have been centred on the conflicts between Irish and Jewish immigrant gangsters in 1920s New York before the Italians arrived and turned crime into big business. Then there were the surnames Corbett in The Big Gundown (La resa dei conti, Sergio Sollima, 1967) and Ryan in Death Rides a Horse (Da uomo a uomo, Giulio Petroni, 1967) – both played by Lee Van Cleef – or the former lawman Murph (Walter Rilla) in Day of Anger (I giorni dell’ira, Tonino Valerii, 1967) and the Rev. Riley (Adolfo Lastretti) in Find a Place to Die (Joe . . . cercati un posto per morire!, Giuliano Carnimeo, 1968): a phoney ‘wandering missionary’, conman and pervert, like a fair number of priests in Spaghetti Westerns (though monks (and Mormons) tended to be better treated). In They Call Me Trinity (Lo chiamavano Trinità . . ., Enzo Barboni, 1970), Sheriff Bud Spencer’s assistant in Alliance City is called Jonathan Swift. In these cases, such Irish flavour as there was came largely through the characters’ names and appearance rather than plot, dialogue or characterisation. Then, in the 1970s – coinciding with reports of the ‘Troubles’ – Lynn Redgrave played Mary O’Donnell, a distant version of her reallife sister Vanessa, as an intense, bespectacled, virginal, red-haired Irish colleen-journalist who takes the Mexican Revolution much more seriously than the other lead characters in Don’t Turn the Other Cheek (¡Viva la muerte . . . tua!, Duccio Tessari, 1971); this was a send-up of the recent, more radical Italian Westerns written or suggested by Franco Solinas. In the final sequence, Lynn Redgrave yells an uncharacteristic expletive at her two mercenary companions (Franco Nero as conman Orlansky, Eli Wallach as cowardly Lozola posing as revolutionary leader ‘El Salvador’) and resolves to find another revolution to write about in Guatemala, while her companions ride off in\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 22\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n23\n\ndisgust. O’Donnell seems well-intentioned, but the cynical Orlansky is convinced that she is ‘someone who creates an idol and then destroys him’: a celebrity-stalker who masks her careerism with apparent revolutionary commitment. This was followed by Lynne Frederick playing Emanuelle ‘Bunny’ O’Neill, a pregnant prostitute (her first name is a clue) who survives a vigilante attack on a flyblown Western town, only to be viciously treated by a psychopathic bandit called Chaco who looks and behaves like Charles Manson (Tomas Milian) in Lucio Fulci’s late entry Four of the Apocalypse (I quattro dell’apocalisse, 1975), very loosely based on two Bret Harte stories ‘The Luck of Roaring Camp’ and ‘The Outcasts of Poker Flat’. In the original Harte, the prostitute was called ‘Duchess’. ‘Bunny’ O’Neill eventually dies while giving birth, and her lover Stubby (Fabio Testi) takes his protracted, cruel revenge on Chaco. Fabio Testi also starred in China 9, Liberty 37 (Amore, piombo e furore, Monte Hellman, 1978), opposite Jenny Agutter as Catherine, the conflicted wife of grizzled Warren Oates. She has an Irish accent throughout, but this is never explained. In White Apache (Bianco Apache, Bruno Mattei, 1987), the central character is an Irish boy who is the sole survivor of an Indian massacre and is brought up by the Apaches to become Shining Sky (Sebastian Harrison, son of Richard), a man who does not quite fit into either American or Apache society. Cowboy turns Indian this time, in a variation on Little Big Man (Arthur Penn, 1970). There were certainly more explicitly Irish figures in Italian Westerns, post-1968 – first male, then female. One of the most significant is featured in The Return of Sabata (È tornato Sabata . . . hai chiuso un’altra volta!), directed by Gianfranco Parolini/Frank Kramer at Elios Studios in 1971. Sabata (Lee Van Cleef) is reduced to showing off his gun-stunts in a circus, and finds himself in Hobsonville, Texas. Hobsonville, he soon discovers, is being run by a corrupt Irishman, a leprechaun-figure usually dressed in a three-piece tweed suit, bowler hat and chianti-red hair, called Joseph McLintock: a name derived from the character played by John Wayne in the relatively recent Andrew V. McLaglen comedy Western McLintock! (1963). McLintock! also starred Maureen O’Hara as Wayne’s estranged wife, and was a reworking for more senior citizens of The Taming of the Shrew – the same distant literary source as John Ford’s The Quiet Man (1952). McLaglen had been assistant director on The Quiet Man, and McLintock! tried hard, in its sprawling way, to appear neo-Fordian. Hobsonville, in The Return of Sabata, resembles Lawrence Murphy’s Lincoln town (in some versions of the Billy the Kid story, notably Chisum – also directed by McLaglen). Joseph\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 23\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n24\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nMcLintock (Giampiero Albertini) seems on the surface to be a pillar of the local community, and enjoys quoting selectively from the Bible; he also likes levying heavy taxes on the locals – for gambling, drinking and prostitution – and issuing counterfeit coins and banknotes while stashing the gold he amasses as a result. He gives hypocritical speeches outside City Hall about ‘a city we can all be proud of – a shining and moral home for men and women’. His entrances tend to be accompanied by Bach-style organ music scored by Marsello Giombini, and when Sabata finds his gold in the last reel, hidden behind a sacred tapestry, it falls down McLintock’s chimney to the sound of the Hallelujah Chorus. McLintock is most prominently featured in a sequence set in his private Catholic oratory which doubles as his bandit headquarters. This sequence begins with a solemn church service (cue organ music) and a homily from an Irish priest (who also has chianti-hair, this time curly): We pray to the good Lord to keep us away from being possessed of the fleeting pleasures of the carnal urge, of violence, of the will to create discord – O Father, let us go back to the innocence we knew originally so we can claim our future in Christ. The priest then recovers from delivering this homily to a congregation of hypocrites by coughing loudly, and taking two big swigs from a bottle of whiskey secreted in his pulpit. ‘A splendid ceremony, Father’, says McLintock, who is dressed in his best shirt with grey cravat. A man rushes up to him, whispers something in his ear, McLintock replies ‘not here’ and leads the man to the high altar. ‘You’re supposed to eliminate an enemy of the organisation and you’ve failed in your mission.’ McLintock then turns the bejewelled crucifix on the altar away from him so the crucified Christ cannot see what he is about to do, swivels round and punches the hapless man in the face with his left hand. ‘Thank the Lord you are alive, because you really owe it to him.’ Then, as the camera zooms in on his face and as he looks lovingly at the cross, now back to its usual position on the altar, he says ‘Mercy we have learned from him.’ He crosses himself. McLintock acts throughout the film like a Mafia boss—and is clearly meant to be a riff on the Hollywood stereotype of the corrupt Boston politician as well as a version of Lawrence Murphy. His cultural roots come from well before the ‘Troubles’: more a case of the Italian Western amplifying, and parodying, one of the cherished myths of classic Hollywood cinema. The Italian version of the genre was full of corrupt governors, sheriffs, marshals and lawyers: officialdom was\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 24\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n25\n\nusually presented as an excuse for freelance gunfighters to take over, even in some films pre-dating A Fistful of Dollars. But the McLintock character was presented in unusual detail. The reason he looked the way he did was clearly because of another Italian Western, which had been released three years earlier. This was Once Upon a Time in the West (C’era una volta il West, Sergio Leone, 1968), which features another pivotal Irish character. I have written extensively about the gestation of this film elsewhere (see Frayling 2000: 247–301), but for the purposes of this chapter the most important element is that amid all the many citations of American Westerns contained in Leone’s film (High Noon, The Iron Horse, Johnny Guitar, Shane, Pursued and The Searchers in the opening two sequences alone) the focal point of the whole postmodernist enterprise was the films of John Ford: the surprising use made of Woody Strode and Henry Fonda, both of them members of what was called ‘Hollywood’s Irish Mafia’; the location in Monument Valley, on the Arizona–Utah border, where Ford had made ten of his Westerns, between Stagecoach (1939) and Cheyenne Autumn (1964); explicit visual references to Wagon Master, My Darling Clementine, The Searchers, Sergeant Rutledge, Two Rode Together and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. Once Upon a Time in the West was part of a European cinematic ‘moment’ which included Chabrol’s take on Hitchcock, Melville’s on Hollywood gangster films, Godard’s on the ‘B’ movies from Republic Studio, Bertolucci’s on film noir and Leone’s take on Ford. When Bertolucci, Argento and Leone were preparing their original treatment in Rome, they talked a lot about Ford’s Westerns and their memories of first watching them dubbed into Italian as they were growing up in Italy. They wanted to include a sequence which would distil their responses to Ford’s utopian communities out West with their ‘dreams of a lifetime’ and sense of promise, symbolising Ford’s gratitude to the USA as the son of an immigrant family from the West of Ireland (the Once Upon a Time element), which they would then collide with a brutal massacre of an entire family in the desert by railroad agents (the In the West element). Sergio Leone observed of John Ford, in retrospect: As Romans, we have a strong sense of the fragility of empires. It is enough to look around us. I admire very much that great optimist, John Ford. His naïveté permitted him to make Cinderella – I mean, The Quiet Man. But, as Italians, we see things differently. That is what I have tried to show in my films. The great plains – they are very beautiful, but, when the storm comes, should people\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 25\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n26\n\nchristopher frayling bury their heads in the sand? I believe that people like to be treated as adults from time to time. Because a man is wearing a sombrero, and because he rides a horse, does not necessarily mean that he is an imbecile. (Frayling [1981] 1998: 135) So what remains in the end? The family. Which is my final archetype – handed down to us from prehistory . . . What else is there? Friendship. And that is all. I’m a pessimist by nature. With John Ford, people look out of the window with hope. Me, I show people who are scared even to open the door. And if they do, they tend to get a bullet right between the eyes. But that’s how it is. Politics are never absent from my films. (Frayling 2000: 306) John Ford is a film-maker whose work I admired enormously, more than any other director of Westerns. I could almost say that it was thanks to him that I even considered making Westerns myself. I was very influenced by Ford’s honesty and his directness. Because he was an Irish immigrant who was full of gratitude to the United States of America, Ford was also full of optimism . . . If he sometimes de-mythologizes the West . . . it is always with a certain romanticism, which is his greatness but which also takes him a long way away from historical truth. (Frayling 2000: 258) There is a visual influence there as well, because [Ford] was the one who tried most carefully to find a true visual image to stand for ‘the West’. The dust, the wooden towns, the clothes, the desert. The Ford film I like most of all – because we are getting nearer to shared values – is also the least sentimental, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. We certainly watched that when we were preparing Once Upon a Time in the West. Why? Because Ford finally, at the age of almost sixty-five, finally understood what pessimism is all about. (Frayling 2000: 258) John Ford regarded America as a land of opportunity where, a long time before, the promise of liberty, peace, adventure and bread had been made – a promise that was not going to be forgotten. As far as he was concerned, the promise had undoubtedly been kept . . . His America was a utopian land, but it was an Irish utopia! In other words, an immigrant land, deeply Catholic, full of pietàs and camaraderie and communities with a lot of humour but without irony – and, more important, without cruelty. I know that my vision of America is very different and that in my films I have always looked at the wrong side of the dollar, the hidden side rather than the face. I also know that the sunny and humane West of John Ford led the way into the arid prairies of my cinema, right up to the last slate of Giù la testa . . . If you think about\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 26\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n27\n\nit, Fordian heroes are never individuals or solitary riders. Instead they are men who are always deeply rooted in their community, exactly like Irish immigrants who are happy with their new life. (Frayling 2008: 168–9) As Leone often noted, John Ford’s American films felt Irish, while his Irish films felt American. The sequence of the massacre takes place at the remote Sweetwater ranch in ‘a stinking piece of desert’ near Monument Valley, built by the pioneer Irish Catholic Brett McBain (Frank Wolff) – Bertolucci was reading the paperback police precinct novels of Brett Halliday and Ed McBain at the time. McBain’s wife has died, and he has been bringing up his two sons Patrick and little Timmy (Enzo Santaniello) and his daughter Maureen (Simonetta Santaniello). Was this name perhaps a reference to Maureen O’Hara in The Quiet Man? Or was it because actor Frank Wolff’s wife was called Maureen? After all, Woody Strode’s wife Luana appeared uncredited in the opening sequence at the remote railroad station – as a nervous Native American woman. Bertolucci, Argento and Leone had been watching together The Searchers (the attack on the Edwards ranch by the Comanche), My Darling Clementine (the barn-dance in the makeshift church, as a celebration of nascent community values) and The Iron Horse (the locomotive hurtling over the camera, on its way to rescue the beleaguered workforce). They had also screened Raoul Walsh’s Pursued (1947), in which Robert Mitchum as Jeb Rand sings the ‘Londonderry Air’ – ‘an old-fashioned tune’ – with musical-box accompaniment, on his return from the war, and his adopted family joins in to reassure themselves that ‘the best and finest thing there is – is family’. In Pursued, the tune was the ‘Londonderry Air’ – public domain – but the words were specially written for the film. In Once Upon a Time in the West, Maureen gaily sings the words of ‘Danny Boy’, which goes with the general sense of Irish domesticity and the red gingham tablecloths laid out for the delayed wedding reception.8 Brett McBain was played by American actor Frank Wolff, who was born in San Francisco and had settled in Europe to make a career in 1960. For Once Upon a Time in the West, Wolff dyed his curly hair, sideburns and moustache bright red – a colour that evidently runs in the McBain family. McBain was presented as an Irishman who seemed crazy – building a ranch in the middle of nowhere – but who was in fact more savvy than anyone had realised, spotting a massive investment opportunity when the railroad lines reached his well. If all had gone to plan, Brett might well have been running the town of Sweetwater – like\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 27\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n28\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nLawrence Murphy in Lincoln – but then again, as Harmonica says, ‘You don’t sell the dream of a lifetime’. As it is, Brett, Maureen, Patrick and Timmy are all gunned down by Henry Fonda and his gang of hitmen employed by the railroad. By turning Fonda into a ruthless, blueeyed, smiling child-killer, Leone was, he said, building on ‘the intuition which John Ford brought to Fort Apache’ when he cast Fonda as ‘an unpleasant, authoritarian colonel who violates moral codes and treaties with the Indians’. The audience would be struck in an instant by the profound contrast between the pitiless character Fonda is playing, and Fonda’s face, a face which for so many years (in Young Mr Lincoln, The Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine and elsewhere) ‘had signified justice and goodness’ (Frayling 2000: 271). The images on the screen no longer signified just themselves, or their original significations (although the ‘cinematic memory’ was still there) – but they signified Leonian variations as well, a process he called ‘cinema cinema’. Semiotics was fast becoming intellectually fashionable in Italy and France at the time. Fonda’s face – like Ford’s Westerns – had been turned by Leone and his scriptwriters into an abstraction. But the sequence of Once Upon a Time in the West where Sergio Leone most explicitly refers to Ford, and to the destruction of his utopian dream by the railroad, occurs when Harmonica and Cheyenne are examining the kit of wooden parts that has been delivered posthumously to Brett McBain’s farm. They take the measure of what will become the train station. The Sweetwater farmhouse, centre of McBain’s little community, is in the background. Harmonica figures out the Irishman McBain’s stratagem. (‘He knew sooner or later that the railroad coming through Flagstone would continue on West. So he looked over all this country out here until he found this hunk of desert. Nobody wanted it, but he bought it. Then he tightened his belt and for years he waited.’) Cheyenne catches on quickly: ‘Aha, he was no fool, our dead friend, huh? He was going to sell this piece of desert for its weight in gold, wasn’t he?’ To which the reply is, ‘You don’t sell the dream of a lifetime.’ McBain is ‘our dead friend’, because agents of the railroad company have massacred him and his entire family: Leone’s most extreme take on what really might have happened to ‘the dream of a lifetime’ and the utopian community which supported it in the films of John Ford. When promoting Once Upon a Time in the West, Sergio Leone announced to the press that as his next project he intended to make a revisionist version of Gone with the Wind (Victor Fleming, 1939), a film he considered ‘artificial and untruthful’ (see Frayling 2000: 301). He was of course being provocative – it had recently been noted that\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 28\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n29\n\nhis films were getting bigger and bigger in scale – but it would have been fascinating to see his take on the character of the idealistic Gerald O’Hara (originally played by Thomas Mitchell), who believes that ‘the land’s the only thing that matters’, and who names his plantation in Georgia after his beloved Tara Hill in County Meath, but who backs the wrong side in the Civil War and after Gettysburg sees his cocooned world of romance and chivalry collapse around him. ‘There was a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields called the Old South’, ran the nostalgic opening caption, Walter Scott-style. ‘Here in this pretty world, gallantry took its last bow . . . Here are the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair . . . a civilization gone with the wind.’ Leone’s opening caption would no doubt have been very different: something about ‘where life had no value . . .’ perhaps. Instead, Sergio Leone went on to make, after an on–off gap of eighteen months, Duck, You Sucker (Giù la testa, 1971): a belated critique of the more overtly ‘political’ Italian Westerns and of Hollywood’s Mexico, as well as – through its two main characters – a study of the destructive potential of revolutionary or political commitment of any kind.9 Whereas the Franco Solinas scripts appealed to legal left-wing groups, the cynicism of Giù la testa appealed more to the very far left at the time.10 Juan Miranda is a naïve Mexican peasant, a born anarchist believing only in his family and friends, who crosses the path of a professional revolutionary and explosives expert with a guilty past, Sean Mallory, who uses him for his own purposes. They come to depend on one another, in an uneasy but touching friendship, and the peasant teaches the intellectual a lesson. The encounter – and the dialectic – proves disastrous for both of them. The setting is a particular historical moment, in 1913, when the initial excitement of the Mexican Revolution is over, and General Victoriano Huerta is trying to put the initial revolutionary impulse into reverse. His downfall is imminent, and his brutal attempts to hold on to power resemble the decadence and cruelty of the last days of Fascism. Giù la testa was filmed between April and July 1970 on location in Spain – Almeria, Los Filabres, Gergal, Guadix, Burgos, Granada, Medinaceli sixty miles from Guadalajara (standing in for the town of Mesa Verde) – and in Ireland at Toner’s Pub on Baggot Street Lower in Dublin (established 1818), the Sally Gap in Wicklow, and the drive and demesne of Howth Castle (the sequences in a vintage car and around the tree). Edited in autumn 1970 and released in 1971 under various titles, it was the only Italian Western to feature sequences filmed on location in Ireland, with Leone’s characteristic mix of realism, fable and abstraction. Originally based on a treatment called ‘Mexico’, which Leone\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 29\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n30\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nhad read during post-production of Once Upon a Time in the West, it became Giù la testa (‘Keep Your Head Down’, after a popular Italian slang phrase ‘Giù la testa, coglione’), then in the United States Duck, You Sucker (a phrase which Leone had convinced himself was in common parlance) before a title change to A Fistful of Dynamite following poor box-office returns. United Artists hoped the ‘Fistful’ brand might pack audiences in: it didn’t. In France, the film was released as Il était une fois la révolution, Leone’s preferred title and the one he originally wanted before being dissuaded. He always stressed, in interviews, that the film was intended as a critique of the image of the Mexican Revolution, rather than its historical reality; it was also about ‘all wars and revolutions’ at some level, rather than just Mexico – hence the visual references in the film to the young Mussolini, the flight of the King, the Nazi massacre at the Fosse Ardeatine, the cattle-wagons carrying Jewish victims to their doom in Poland, and the last days of Fascism: These are signs which are there to connote all wars and revolutions. Whether in Ireland or Spain, or wherever. Here, the Mexican Revolution is only a symbol. Not the historical one. It only interested me in relation to cinema: Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, ‘La Cucaracha’. A true mythology.11 Giù la testa was in some ways reacting against Hollywood’s Mexican Revolution, ‘and also against the romance of the sombrero, the picturepostcard Mexico of the Cisco Kid and Zorro, and the singing cowboys’. Leone also related this to contemporary (mid-1969) debates in Italy about ‘the disillusionment of my generation with the subject of revolution’; when Sean Mallory throws away the Bakunin book Patriotism, ‘you suspect damn well that this gesture is a symbolic reference to everything my generation has been told in the way of promises . . . But don’t imagine that there weren’t continuities with earlier Westerns as well.’ By ‘continuities’, Leone seemed to mean: sandy Spanish locations standing in for New Mexico, the border and Northern Mexico; flamboyant and noisy Spanish bad guys in decorated sombreros, and gipsy extras; German co-stars in co-productions; the contrast between two styles of acting – flamboyant (Spanish), quiet (American); regular doses of ‘chilli con carnage’, to keep the audience from getting bored; an emphasis on elaborate firearms; a duel – or settling of accounts – in the last reel; Ennio Morricone or Morricone-style music; a ‘Mexicanisation’ of the traditional Hollywood Western; and Catholic iconography – crosses, cemeteries, churches, bell-towers, sculptures and priests – rather than the traditional Protestant imagery of the Hollywood Western. In Giù la testa,\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 30\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n31\n\nfor example, there is a ‘halo’ around Sean Mallory’s head, an altar with ‘holy water’ (nitro) consecrated on it, and the window of the bank at Mesa Verde is presented as if it was the Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament with the Host at its centre. ‘It only interested me in relation to cinema . . .’ There was the reaction against the recent tendency within Italian Westerns, but more importantly – for Leone anyway – there were the ways in which Hollywood films such as Viva Villa! (Jack Conway, 1934),12 Juarez (William Dieterle, 1939)13 and Viva Zapata! (Elia Kazan, 1952)14 had reinterpreted the Revolution for largely North American audiences and in the process made it a projection of North American values, and of how the United States hoped it would be seen across the border. These films did, in their distinctive ways, treat the Mexican Revolution as a historical event in its own right. But then there were the popular Hollywood adventureWesterns of the 1950s and 1960s – where American soldiers of fortune ride across the border Gary Cooper-style in search of lost illusions, spiritual renewal, ‘la revolución’, gold, a bullshit-free zone, and America’s libido. Between The Magnificent Seven (John Sturges, 1960) and The Professionals (Richard Brooks, 1966), these films, in their different ways, all enacted President Kennedy’s famous promise of technical and military assistance, as part of the new frontier, to ‘those people in the huts and villages across the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery’. In these films, the redemptive power of America’s intervention is measured against old-style colonialism, banditry, vulgarity and primitive folklore. By 1966, though, these soldiers of fortune were beginning to ask – with Burt Lancaster in The Professionals – ‘Maybe there’s only one revolution, since the beginning. The good guys against the bad guys. The question is: who are the good guys?’ Everything in these films was seen from the point of view, the perspective, of the North American heroes – which was assumed to be the audience’s point of view as well. The films are also about the USA’s self-perception on the world’s stage. But the question ‘who are the good guys?’ was about to get a very different answer, in Italy, where the adventure-Westerns were particularly popular: an answer that reacted against the Americanisation of the Revolution, and of the journey across the border, in a very postmodern way. Since the 1930s, Mexico had been the Third World country to which the Hollywood community felt the closest affinity, as indeed they were the closest geographically. From the mid-1960s, that was all to change – in Italy, anyhow. As for the picture-postcard presentation of Mexico mentioned by Sergio Leone, the Hollywood settings for these exotic adventures, over and over again – in features, ‘B’ movies and serials – had tended to\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 31\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n32\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nconsist of sleepy villages with peasants in white cotton calzóns photogenically patting tortillas in the background, in a country which seems regularly to host violent coups engineered by European-style heelclicking dictators from the world of operetta. Local colour consisted in peacetime of mules, siestas, serenades, crucifixes and bell towers, cacti, huge sombreros, folkloric fiestas against high-contrast skies and machismo rather than toughness; and during la revolución – a time of transition – of automobiles and flying machines, machetes and machine-guns, motorcycles and locomotives, barbed wire, automatic weapons and spectacular set-piece raids. The music was usually derived from Aaron Copland’s El Salón México – written in the mid-1930s and heavy on the trumpets/syncopated strings/strumming Spanish guitars/ dance rhythms – via his students such as Elmer Bernstein, who scored The Magnificent Seven. Then there were of course the singing cowboys who went ‘south of the border, down Mexico way’, a song by the way which was written by two British songwriters who had blagged their way into Gene Autry’s dressing-room in Dublin. Then for Sergio Leone there was always John Ford: not the Ford of the Westerns this time, but the Ford of films set in Ireland. Leone was keen enough on the Fordian connection to suggest Peter Bogdanovich – Ford’s biographer in 1967 and a well-known fan of his storytelling abilities – as the possible director of Giù la testa, until the two men fell out. There had, in fact, been a recent film reference, which may have set a kind of precedent – in Louis Malle’s Viva Maria! (1965). The opening sequence of this film made an explicit link between the ‘Irish’ and ‘Mexican’ Revolutions. It was set in ‘Ireland, 1891’, and showed the juvenile Maria O’Malley – in a blue ‘sailor suit’ dress designed by Pierre Cardin – playfully laying a fuse, for her father to detonate. It is as if she is playing with a ball of cotton. The British garrison on a castle esplanade, with drilling soldiers in scarlet tunics and black bearskins and a Union Jack up the flagpole, is nearby. Mr O’Malley is dressed in tweed trousers and waistcoat and a tweed cap, Quiet Manstyle. There is an explosion, and Maria gaily walks away hand in hand with her father, humming a nursery rhyme. Later, she will grow up to become a revolutionary in Central America (Brigitte Bardot), after her father is blown up in 1907. Asked by critic Philip French if Viva Maria! might in fact have inspired the ‘political’ phase of the Italian Westerns, Louis Malle replied: ‘I didn’t think of that – that’s funny.’ (French 1992: 50–1). Maybe, he added, they had a common source in Vera Cruz (Robert Aldrich, 1954): ‘We thought it would be fun to put Bardot and Moreau in the same situation as Cooper and Lancaster in Vera Cruz and to do a pastiche of those buddy films.’\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 32\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\nthe quiet man gets noisy\n\n33\n\nThe transformation of the treatment of ‘Mexico’ into a workable screenplay for Giù la testa was largely the work of Sergio Donati (in spring and summer 1969), embellished with some comedy by Luciano Vincenzoni and revisited by Donati early in 1970. These were Leone’s Dollars screenwriters. In this lengthy process, the character of Sean Mallory grew in importance and depth. While Juan Miranda was a characteristically ‘Leone’ character – a carnivalesque Sancho Panza who puts camaraderie and family before any civic responsibilities – Sean Mallory seems to have been largely Donati’s contribution. As he has recalled: ‘Mallory is my character. If you read my first mystery novels, this kind of hero is my particular hero . . . he’s a character from my repertory – the unlikely hero, the disenchanted hero’.15 Mallory started life in early drafts as an absinthe-drinking, romantic revolutionary who has become disillusioned with the ideals of his youth because of a personal tragedy. He displaces his bitterness into dope and drink, and has come to thrive on chaos and destruction. This survived into the finished film. He gives a conscience to Juan Miranda, ‘which makes him a lost soul forever’, as Leone put it. Through the dialectic of Juan/Sean, Leone/Donati, he grows as a character throughout the story – a first for Leone. Up to now, by his own admission, Leone had treated his main characters as ‘puppets’. A cutting from The United Irishman, discovered near Sean’s motorbike, tells us that the British government has placed a £300 bounty on his head. Juan happily assumes Sean is a fellow bandit, though the latter is diffident about the nature of the trouble he is in (‘Oh, we had a wee fart of a revolution in Ireland’). Sean is an explosives specialist. So instead of the usual gun duel, there is much cat-and-mouse business involving dynamite and nitro-glycerine. He carries his equipment – short fuse, medium fuse, long fuse – inside the lining of his long duster-coat (‘If you pull that trigger and shoot me, I fall, and if I fall, they’ll have to alter all the maps. You see, when I go, half this bloody country goes with me. Including yourself’). However, he has lost his illusions. He drinks too much: in one sequence, he is so paralytic that he is incapable of operating his detonator, so Juan has to blow up the mine-owner Aschenbach and his escort of soldiers by putting his foot on the handle. He also smokes dope, and behaves like a suicidal dilettante, saying things like: ‘If it’s a revolution, it’s confusion’ and ‘When I started using dynamite, I believed in many things . . . finally I believe only in dynamite’. For much of the story, he manipulates the naïve Juan. But unlike the double-crosses of Leone’s earlier films, this manipulation leads to personal tragedy, and Sean learns something from it. In a very touching\n\n4944_Fisher.indd 33\n\n23/03/16 6:12 PM\n\n34\n\nchristopher frayling\n\nscene in a cattle-wagon, he realises the depth of Juan’s grief, and begins to recall a time when he, too, was capable of experiencing the normal range of emotions. In a final slow-motion flashback, he fantasises about an idyllic moment in rural Ireland, when he was young, in love, and with his ideals intact. Juan, who is somehow in synch with this fantasy, instinctively turns to look at his friend. The Irishman has just confessed to his Mexican partner, as Juan shows Sean the rosary he has kept since the massacre of his family in the grotto, ‘Oh, my friend, I did give you a royal screwing.’ Juan shakes his head, as if to signal, ‘No, don’t say that.’ Sean, mortally wounded in the spine, then blows himself up, in a variation on Jean-Luc Godard’s Pierrot le Fou (1965), a film which Leone judged ‘a masterpiece: when cinematic researches lead to such perfection and such emotion, I really am profoundly respectful’ (Simsolo 1987: 148–9). In Pierrot, Ferdinand (Jean-Paul Belmondo), having wrapped his face in multi-coloured sticks of dynamite and lit the fuse, then changes his mind and fumbles for the burning tip: ‘how stupid!’ are his last words. In Giù la testa, Sean takes a deep drag on his joint of marijuana which doubles as a detonator, smiles and relaxes into his idyllic fantasy just before the huge explosion. Ferdinand’s gesture is impetuous and pointless; Sean’s is calculated: he has been deliberately dicing with death ever since the two men met. The betrayals in this story have serious consequences, such as that of Dr Villega (Romolo Valli), the intellectual strategist tortured by Reza into giving away his co-conspirators. This also marks a development in Leone. As he was to"
