        "text": "1. Comedy Genre Conventions By Jordan Farley\n\n3. Setting • Comedy films can be set almost anywhere, however the most typical setting for Comedy films is suburban areas in places such as high schools and bars. The areas that they are set in are usually happy, sunny towns or neighbourhoods. These areas could also be slightly more rural (or possibly artificial) and have nice, large houses.\n\n5. Technical Codes • • • There tends to be a lot of establishing shots to show changed locations, characters, new themes etc. Scenes are usually well lit using natural lighting (sunlight) or atmospheric lighting such as low key lighting and smoke to give effect. You get a lot of close ups, mid shots and long shots, these work well with the use of establishing shots, this range of shots is effective as they can be used with conversation, but also to show the characters full bodies, where the audience only really see the top of the characters bodies, sometimes you see their whole bodies in montages etc.\n\n7. Iconography • • • Visual Style : Light/modern/normal colours, links with having a normal life etc. Lighting is mainly natural (sunlight), high key, highlighting the main characters. There are a few common props that are seen in many comedy films used by the main characters such as beer bottles, bongs and possibly guns. This shows that drinking, drugs and violence are common themes in lots of comedy films.\n\n9. Narrative Structure • • The common narrative structure for comedy films is very similar within a lot of comedy films and often ends on a teaser for a sequel, for example, 21 Jump Street ends with Captain Dickinson saying, ‘You two sons of bitches are going to college’. This teases the audience with the possibility of a second movie where the main characters attend college. There is always more than one protagonist as comedy films often feature multiple main characters that go through the story as almost one person.\n\n11. Character Types • • • • The Main Protagonist, often 2-4 different characters, usually all different in their own ways, one idiot, one that worries about everything and a leader, go through the main story together. The Villain, often someone that has something that belongs the protagonist or someone that the protagonist has been told to find/kill. The person in charge, such as Captain Dickinson in 21 Jump Street, gives orders to the protagonist, often gets annoyed with them. The person that the protagonist meets during the story, may seem good but commonly ends up being bad and screwing over the protagonist. Similar to Chow in The Hangover.\n\n14. Todorov’s Narrative Theory • • • • • • Equilibrium – The normal, day to day, happy normal life Disruption - Something, often bad, happens that changes the equilibrium Recognition Of Disruption – The main character notices the disruption Attempt To Repair Disruption - The protagonist tries to fix the disruption Climax – Usually a part of the film where everything ‘kicks off’, commonly in the form of a fight or battle New Equilibrium – Things go back to normal, maybe with a few slight differences, for the better\n\n15. Propp’s Character Roles 1 • The Hero or Anti-hero - The central protagonist who drives the story forward on some kind of quest in return for a reward. • The Villain - The Antagonist who seeks riches, power, glory or maybe the Princess. Tries to stop the Hero in his quest. May have started the disruption. • The Princess - Acts as a reward for the Hero for succeeding. May need to be rescued. May be quite a passive character. • The Princess’ father - Gives the task to the hero, identifies the false hero."
