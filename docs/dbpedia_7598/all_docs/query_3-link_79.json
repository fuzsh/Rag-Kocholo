        "text": "COMEDY HISTORY\n\nA comedy is a story of the rise in fortune of a sympathetic central character.\n\nComedy is one of the oldest genres in film; some of the first silent movies were comedies. Charlie Chaplin is probably the most famous comedian of silent films. The 1920’s and the introduction of sound into movies made verbal humor possible. Silent film comedy was replaced by dialogue from comedians like W.C. Fields and the Marx Brothers. In the 30’s screwball comedies were introduced. For example the three stooges. At the end of the 50’s comedy started to become darker and more serious themes emerged. In the 80’s gag-based films like “Young Frankenstein” became popular. One of the major developments in the 90’s was the romantic comedy. “Four weddings and a funeral”. Recently we have seen a rise in Stoner comedies “Pineapple Express”, gross-out humor “American Pie” and sex comedies. Like Superbad, and most of Judd Apatows films.\n\nComedy originated from classical Greek words Komos meaning Revel and Kome meaning Village. Greeks and Romans confined the word comedy to descriptions of stage-plays with happy ending. It was during the Middle Ages where comedy became associated with satire and humor in general.\n\nAristotle defined comedy as one of the four original genres of literature. According to Aristotle all comedies begin with low, typically “ugly” guy who cant do anything right. By the end of the story the ugly guys usually wins the pretty girl. Comedy includes the unrealistic in order to portray the realistic.\n\nEXPLANATION OF THE GENRE AND ELEMENTS\n\nIn this film genre, many aspects that go into making the film (mise-en-scene, cinematography, editing, screenwriting, etc.) often share one common goal: to make absurd a situation that is inherently natural or normal. Because of this tendency within the genre, comedy and slapstick make use of very natural mise-en-scene, building sets and lighting schemes that often mimick everyday life, the natural, if you will.\n\nIn terms of lighting, comedies often make use of neither high- or low-key lighting and rarely use the “three-point” lighting technique as a way to identify or emphasize a certain element or character in the scene due to the fact it would be highly unnatural and formalistic, as opposed to real and naturalistic. The same applies to the way many shots are composed and/or angled in a given scene, using visual information and perspective that creates an illusion in which the viewer believes themselves to be part of the scene, employing the use of many medium and medium-close up shots and eye-level angles. By doing so, the viewer is able to visually consume what is onscreen very easily and believes they can relate to the action that is taking place in the film. Again, the same line of reasoning applies to the use of color values and lens filters: the less use of the two, the more realistic and palpable the situation being filmed is for the viewers to understand.\n\nObviously not all comedy films share this same tendency for creating a very realistic and “liveable” atmostphere in a film, but the genre is inherently created to emphasize writing and plot to be more significant in terms to trying make absurd the very plain and boring phenomenon that is everyday life. To communicate this, the genre resorts to using very realistic mise-en-scene and cinematography to carry out this point. On the other hand, the subgenre of slapstick often deviates from the rather realistic mise-en-scene normally found in comedies, incorporating a more varied array of camera techniques, as well as a more unusual and formalistic mise-en-scene.\n\nFor example, the film “Caddyshack” is seen as slapstick in the sense that it diffentiates from a normal comedy by refusing to retain realistic or natural character intercourse and plot. This is evidenced by the more the higher contrasts in lighting, higher color values, higher contrasts in camera proxemics, use of puppets as characters and more spread-out organization of visual information. These aspects all tend to be hallmarks of the slapstick subgenre and differ from the normal comedy genre by not always using natural enviornments or situations and instead use more formalistic and Hollywood-type effects that emphasize the very physical and gesture-driven genre. In a sense, the absurd is made more absurd by letting go of coherent time and space within the natural world of comedy. But on the whole, the genre still stands as a testament to people’s ability to abuse and deform everyday life and try to confuse and comment upon it with humor.\n\nEXPLANATION OF MISE-EN-SCENE IN GENRE (70’S-00’S)\n\nMis-en-scene of Woody Allens Movie Bananas\n\nMis En Scene- literally “placing on stage” refers to arrangement of all the visual elements of a theatrical production within a given playing area- the stage. And has 4 formal elements:\n\nThe physical setting and décor,\n\nA magazine store. A store where on wall is covered in magazines and the wall parallel to the wall with magazines has a long glass counter. The room is long and narrow giving the effect of a closed in environment.\n\n2. The staging of the action,\n\nThe staging of the main characters actions range from profile to three quarter turn, providing a sense of trying to hide something while still observing his surroundings. His stance shows a sense of secrecy.\n\n3. The manner in which these elements are framed.\n\nThe view is from the side. This provides a view of the magazines and the décor, the main character and the people in the background in a closed in space. The angle changes sporadically from the side angle to an angle behind the main character, focusing on encounter between the woman watching the main character and the main characters response.\n\n4. The manner in which they are photographed\n\nThe camera ranges from a medium shot to a close shot in this scene as it changes angles to envelope certain points and direct the viewers focus. The camera is at eye level with the characters. This shot angle suggests a realistic observation point, providing a more realistic viewpoint, making the scene more realistic as a result. The lighting in this scene is very natural. There seems to be one high key light to give the element of a natural element, providing minimal shadows without over illuminating the scene.\n\nDominant: Where is our eye attracted first? Why?\n\nThe viewers eye is attracted to the main character first, due to the contrast in movement between the still background and the moving main character. The main character is also pinpointed as the thing that stands out in the scene as he is blocking the rest of the scene, taking up most of the space on the left side of the screen. The characters immediate interaction with the wall of magazines makes the viewers attention move to the wall right after noticing the main character, making the wall the subsidiary contrast.\n\nLighting Key: High Key? Low Key? High Contrast? Some combination of these?\n\nThe lighting in this scene is very natural. There seems to be one high key light to give the element of a natural element, providing minimal shadows without over illuminating the scene.\n\nShot and Camera Proxemics: What Type of shot? How Far away is the camera from the action?\n\nThe camera ranges from a medium shot to a close shot in this scene as it changes angles to envelope certain points and direct the viewers focus.\n\nAngle: Are we (and the camera) looking up or down on the subject? Or is the camera neutral (eye level)?\n\nThe camera is at eye level with the characters. This shot angle suggests a realistic observation point, providing a more realistic viewpoint, making the scene more realistic as a result.\n\nColor values: What is the dominant color? Are there contrasting foils? Is there color symbolism?\n\nThere are lots of colors in this scene. The wall of magazines is a plethora of colors, providing the illusion of organized chaos. As a contrast from the wall of magazines which has many colors, the rest of the store in the scene is plain. The only other elements of color in this scene are the main character and the woman he awkwardly attempts to avoid, both of whom are wearing bright colors. The rest of the background consists of fairly neutral colors, and the existence of the background characters and the other things within the store provides a sense of texture and depth within the scene.\n\nLens/ Filter/ Stock: How do these distort or comment on the photographed materials?\n\nThe lens used is probably a wide angled lens, because of the sense of depth and the fact that several panes are in view. The film stock is a fast paced film stock as it can register an image with very little illumination but often appears grainy, often seen in older films.\n\nSubsidiary contrasts: What are the main eye-stops after taking in the dominant?\n\nThe background is fairly still while the main character is moving. This movement attracts the eye to the main character first. The main characters immediate interaction with the wall of magazines, along with the walls abundant colors then draws our attention to the wall.\n\nDensity: How much visual information is packed into the image? Is the texture stark, moderate, or highly detailed?\n\nThere is a great deal of texture in this scene. The texture is all clear and though all of it may not be as prominent as the brightly colored objects, they are still able to make this scene dense through the highly detailed texture.\n\nComposition: How is the two dimensional space segmented and organized? What is the underlying design?\n\nThe composition is triangular, as the scene largely consists of the interactions between 3 characters within the scene: First the woman, the main character and the wall of magazines then the store owner, the woman and the main character.\n\nForm: Open or closed? Does the image suggest a window that arbitrarily isolates a fragment of the scene? Or a proscenium arch, in the visual elements are carefully arranged and held in balance?\n\nThis scene is closed. It arbitrarily isolates a fragment of the scene through its close shots. The elements of the scene are carefully arranged, there seems to be a crass difference between the main characters and things involved in the scene and the background elements.\n\nFraming: Tight or loose? Do the characters have no room to move around, or can they move freely without impediments?\n\nThe framing is loose, as the characters have room to move around.\n\nMis En Scene- literally “placing on stage” refers to arrangement of all the visual elements of a theatrical production within a given playing area- the stage. And has 4 formal elements:\n\n1. The physical setting and décor,\n\nThe physical décor is a runway of an airport. The setting is very open and plain, which allows for the viewer to focus more attentively on the main characters.\n\n2. The staging of the action,\n\nThe staging of the characters actions is at a quarter turn, allowing for a semi-personal encounter to occur between the audience and the actors during the encounter between the characters.\n\n3. The manner in which these elements are framed.\n\nThe scene is shot at medium range, giving the illusion of a closed in environment, because the people are all closed in, however the people are all free to move around and the space is very open. The camera angle is at eye level for the entire scene, looking head on at the image. This provides a more personal feel to the scene.\n\n4. The manner in which they are photographed\n\nThe angle of the scene changes from the beginning until when the men get off the plane. The constant angle of during the discussion allows for a constant flow. The direction that the people are standing also allows for\n\nMise en Scene Film Analysis questions\n\nDominant: Where is our eye attracted first? Why?\n\nThe eye is first attracted to the airplane , because it is the only object in the scene. It is also in the center of the screen.\n\nLighting Key: High Key? Low Key? High Contrast? Some combination of these?\n\nThe lighting in this scene is natural, with very few shadows, meaning that the lighting is a high key.\n\nShot and Camera Proxemics: What Type of shot? How Far away is the camera from the action?\n\nIn the beginning of the scene the shot is an extreme long shot, however when the plane lands the shot moves to a medium shot, incorporating much of the peoples bodies and a good deal of the background.\n\nAngle: Are we (and the camera) looking up or down on the subject? Or is the camera neutral (eye level)?\n\nThe camera angle is at eye level for all of the scene, looking head on at the image.\n\nColor values: What is the dominant color? Are there contrasting foils? Is there color symbolism?\n\nThere are 3 main color groups in this scene. First, there’s the background, which includes a good deal of white and pale colors. The light colors give a sense of daytime, and cool weather. Second are the two men that greet the men that come off the plane, who are wearing dark colors. These dark colors give a sense of importance in their business like clothes, making the men appear to be related to the government of a large corporation. Third there are the two men that come off the plane that are dressed in army greens. This plain green wear along with the style of dress conveys a sense of rebellion and violence or change.\n\nLens/ Filter/ Stock: How do these distort or comment on the photographed materials?\n\nSubsidiary contrasts: What are the main eye-stops after taking in the dominant?\n\nThe lens is a wide angled lens that captures various panes in the scene and stock is most likely a fast paced stock, providing for the dirty picture.\n\nDensity: How much visual information is packed into the image? Is the texture stark, moderate, or highly detailed?\n\nThough there are a lot of objects in the background, the colors make the viewer focus on the four characters in the scene. The picture is not very dense because the colors limit the viewer to taking in only four main object, which are segregated by color. The texture is stark.\n\nComposition: How is the two dimensional space segmented and organized? What is the underlying design?\n\nThough three elements are relating the composition of this scene is not triangular, because the diagonal visual element of the scene suggests diagonal composition, reflecting dialogue and tension.\n\nForm: Open or closed? Does the image suggest a window that arbitrarily isolates a fragment of the scene? Or a proscenium arch, in the visual elements are carefully arranged and held in balance?\n\nThe scene is open. The scene suggests a window that is arbitrarily isolating a fragment of the scene do to the camera angle and proximity of the characters to the camera.\n\nFraming: Tight or loose? Do the characters have no room to move around, or can they move freely without impediments?\n\nThe framing is loose as the characters have room to move around freely."
