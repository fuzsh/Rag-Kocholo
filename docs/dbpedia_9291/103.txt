Cher is used to commercial success on the Billboard charts, but throughout the past few weeks, she’s been managing new feats and demonstrating her ongoing popularity once again thanks to a popular new release. Now, she’s reached the top of another ranking, one she’s never ruled before.

This week, Cher sits atop the Holiday Digital Song Sales chart. Billboard recently reinstated the ranking of the bestselling tunes in America that fall under the “holiday” label, though the tracks featured on the list can vary in terms of genre and style.

Cher dominates the Holiday Digital Song Sales chart with her current single “DJ Play a Christmas Song.” The track sold just over 6,200 copies in the past tracking period, according to Luminate.

“DJ Play a Christmas Song” marks Cher’s first No. 1 hit on the Holiday Digital Song Sales chart. The tune replaces the Kelce brothers–Travis and Jason–whose charity single “Fairytale of Philadelphia” sold well enough to run the show recently.

Last week, “DJ Play a Christmas Song” broke onto the Holiday Digital Song Sales chart. It debuted at No. 3, giving Cher her first placement on the tally, which only runs for a few weeks each year. Now, it’s become her inaugural champion.

“DJ Play a Christmas Song” is featured on Cher’s latest album, the simply-titled Christmas. The set sold well upon its arrival several weeks ago, and it is being kept afloat largely by the success of its single. The title rose to No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Holiday Albums chart when it dropped, giving Cher her first champion on yet another ranking.
