        "text": "Cher opens up about her new relationship with music executive, Alexander ‘A.E’ Edwards.\n\nWe previously reported that the pop icon confirmed their relationship back in November by tweeting alongside a viral picture of the two,“I’m Not Defending us. Haters are Gonna Hate…Doesn’ Matter That we’re Happy & Not Bothering Anyone..”\n\nWhile on the Kelly Clarkson show, Cher gushes over her man. She says, “On paper, it’s kind of ridiculous,” Cher said of the couple. “But in real life, we get along great. He’s fabulous. And I don’t give men qualities that they don’t deserve.”\n\n“He’s very kind, very smart, he’s very talented, and he’s really funny,” she said. “And I think he’s quite handsome.”\n\nShe then goes on to explain why she’s dating a younger man. “Older men just didn’t like me all that much,” Cher said. “Do you know what I mean? I have had a couple boyfriends that were hovering around my age, but they just didn’t like me for some reason. And maybe younger men don’t care if you’re funny or outrageous and want to do stupid things, and you have the strong personality. I’m not giving up my personality for anybody, okay?”\n\nA.E was previously romantically linked to Amber Rose. The two have a 3-year-old son together. Reports claim that he and Cher met at Paris Fashion Week."
