        "text": "Cher’s customized tour bus comes barreling down a Connecticut back road, heading for the local fairground, on the latest leg of an eight-month tour that will ultimately take the studded star across America, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Seventy people, including security guards, are needed each night to put on her newest show, a garishly costumed combination of Las Vegas outlandishness and rude rock ‘n’ roll aptly titled “Heart of Stone.” Why, I am thinking, after winning an Oscar for best actress in Moonstruck, is Cher still busting (and exposing) her tattooed butt doing one-night stands? “I gotta make a living” is her simple explanation. Though it costs $10,000 just to house the crew each time they stop on the road, Cher is grossing more than $1 million every week. Indeed, money has remained the most important cosmetic for Cher, the poor California girl who ran away from home when she was sixteen. Twenty-eight years later, she may not be an instinctive businesswoman, but she is an instinctive spender.\n\n“I don’t have a boss,” Cher tells me, still sounding like that sixteen-year-old girl. “I’m my own boss.” Four million dollars is now her asking price for a motion picture, and according to her divorce settlement with her husband of ten years, Sonny Bono (who is now a restaurateur and mayor of Palm Springs, California), she is entitled to 50 percent of the hefty royalties from all the songs they wrote together. She has also been getting royalties for twenty-five years from her best-selling albums. Though she doesn’t enjoy playing Las Vegas, she commands $400,000 a night there, and her latest contract with Steve Wynn requires her to spend four weeks at his Mirage hotel within the next two years. She is just finishing a seven-year contract promoting Bally’s Health & Tennis Corp., and has co-written a book called Forever Fit, which Bantam will publish in January.\n\nShe is less successful in her other business dealings. After much initial brouhaha, she pulled out of her last endeavor, Uninhibited perfume. The only company that Cher herself has created, Isis, a film-production firm now headquartered at Tri-Star Pictures, has been in existence for five years and still hasn’t produced a movie. “She likes the idea of being in the business of controlling her creativity, like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas,” says someone who has watched her dealings close up, “but she hates the business side of it. She hates to sit down and take a meeting with a studio executive.”\n\n“I expect Cher to direct films when she’s ready to make that commitment,” says Tri-Star’s new chairman, Mike Medavoy. “She’s too busy now doing her concerts and cutting another album. But she’s got what it takes to direct.”\n\nShe’s also got what it takes to maneuver. She expertly handled two entertainment giants, CBS and HBO, in their recent efforts to televise her tour concert at the Mirage. The day before HBO was set to start shooting, CBS somehow discovered that Cher had not signed her contract with the cable network. Steve Wynn, whose Golden Nugget, Inc., was the driving force behind the deal, named musician and director Richard Baskin as one of the executive producers for the special, and some say it was Baskin, an ex-boyfriend of Barbra Streisand’s and heir to the ice-cream fortune, who helped pave the way for CBS to snatch the show away. At the direction of the new president of CBS Entertainment, Jeff Sagansky, the network went after Cher with open pockets. CBS came away with the deal; Cher came away with $2 million. “Cher takes more chances with her talents than almost any other performer around,” says Sagansky.\n\nThe bus finally arrives fifteen minutes before Cher is scheduled to perform and docks right next to the stage, scattering the requisite rock ‘n’ roll retinue: tough, girly men with hair down to their asses; tough, girly women with skirts up to theirs. A skinny fellow carrying a Styrofoam head with a wild black wig on it scampers toward Cher’s dressing room, grandly allowing the wig’s hair to flow behind him like the flames from an exotic torch. “She’s coming!” shout several fans pressed against the other side of the chain-link fence that separates the backstage area from the rest of the fairground, where 40,000 more fans have shown up to hear Cher’s bad-girl baritone and gawk at her bad-girl body.\n\nCher is already wearing her Cleopatra stage makeup when she disembarks from the bus. A court of beautiful women cluster around her: her younger sister, Georganne; her best friend, Paulette Betts, who was once married to Dickey Betts, a guitarist in the Allman Brothers Band with Cher’s second husband, Gregg Allman; and her workout partner, Angela Best. “We all live together all the time,” Cher tells me. “Paulette and I ‘live together’ live together. And Ange is almost always there. My sister was there for a long time, but now she’s getting married [to Cher’s close-cropped head of security, Ed Bartylak]. We’re like The Golden Girls. Paulette is Rose. Angela is Blanche. I’m Dorothy. And Georganne is Sophia. We’ve even got robes monogrammed with our Golden Girls names.”\n\nFrom the first word she sings—“I’m no angel!”—to the last—“If I could turn back time!”—the show takes an hour. In the fifth row sit a mother and her daughter, a child of about six. When Cher appears in one of her see-through costumes, the mother pumps the air with a clenched fist, jumps to her feet, and dances with abandon. The child stares in disbelief at the sight of her mother acting so frighteningly young, but by the time Cher is complaining in her lower register that she’s “driven by perfection!” the six-year-old is dancing, too. Cher turns her back on them and prances upstage; she touches the beads of sweat forming above her lacquered upper lip with the back of her hand, rolls her eyes with exhaustion, then abruptly turns back toward the audience. “You drive me crazy with perfection!” she sings at the top of her tired lungs.\n\nThe instant the show is over, Cher races from the stage and is back on the bus, heading toward Jersey, where she has been hanging out with her latest boyfriend, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora. She is swathed in the costume from her last number—black velvet lounging pajamas covered with crystal-like beads—and wears the black wig that earlier crowned the Styrofoam. “I’m getting too old for this,” she groans, and removes her shoes. Someone brings her a bowl of fresh cherries. She waves it away. “I can barely move around onstage.”\n\nWe are in the back of the bus, where a comfortable bedroom has been designed for her in a palette of beiges—her favorite color. “Can you see a spur or anything on my foot?” she asks, putting her sole in my face. All I can see is the seductive swirl of a tattoo heading up her leg beneath a velvet cuff. “Do you mind if we lie down?” she asks.\n\nWhat sounds like jaded ennui is really Epstein-Barr. Cher discovered she carried the energy-sapping virus during the filming of The Witches of Eastwick in 1986, but she wasn’t fully aware of the disease’s debilitating force until she began her latest film, Mermaids, which opens next month. Production had to be shut down while she regained her strength. “I was so sick I thought I was going to die. I went to doctor after doctor.” During the hiatus, the studio replaced the film’s director, Lasse Hallström (My Life as a Dog), with Frank Oz (Little Shop of Horrors). Cher, after putting up with rumors that she had had Emily Lloyd replaced with Winona Ryder in the role of her older daughter, took aim at Oz, often questioning his authority. “She emotionally beat the shit out of him,” says someone familiar with the set. Oz finally left the project, and Richard Benjamin (My Favorite Year) was brought in to calm everyone down.\n\n“Look, I’m only difficult if you’re an idiot,” Cher says as we make ourselves comfortable on the bed and she begins to string bead necklaces for the band members. “If you don’t know more than I know, then I’ll be really difficult. I know you’re not even supposed to say it, but nobody ever says anything if an actor gets fired, but if a director gets fired, then everybody has a heart attack.”\n\n“Cher was absolutely generous,” says Kurt Russell, who played Meryl Streep’s love interest in Silkwood, for which Cher received her first Oscar nomination, for her portrayal of Streep’s lesbian friend. “Now, Cher’s got a personality that could make it difficult for someone if she’s not getting her point across. Her moods change quickly, but all good actors are like that.”\n\n“I know I won’t make many more films,” says Cher. “There are already parts I can’t do. I’m just too old for them.” After raising twenty-one-year-old Chastity, her daughter by Bono, and still in the midst of raising her son by Allman, fourteen-year-old Elijah, Cher is, as Mermaids attests, ripe for the Righteous Mother roles that Hollywood has always foisted upon its middle-aged female stars. Recently she even had to play the part in real life.\n\nChastity’s rock band, which is currently recording a demo for Geffen Records, is called Vicious Rumor, according to Cher. The name is no coincidence. Earlier this year, a tabloid ran a front-page story alleging Chastity’s lesbianism and Cher’s distraught reaction to it. “I’ve always had a problem with those newspapers,” Cher tells me. “The couple of weeks that that stuff came out, there were also some things that weren’t of as much interest to people—about Elijah being a Satanist, and a guy who cut off his ear and sent it to me. Fuck it, I’m tired of dealing with those people. It’s just too difficult to prove that they are doing it with complete malice. I’ll tell you something: if Chastity joined the Ku Klux Klan, then I would be out of my mind. There are certain things that I think are bad and certain things that I don’t really care about. It would be a lot more important to me that Chastity be a good person than what her sexuality is. She is everything I would want her to be—sensitive, smart, talented. But it made a lot better story to say that I was out of my mind about it.”\n\nCher proudly holds up a necklace for me to inspect, then immediately starts another, picking up one tiny bead at a time and running it out the length of the string. As she works, she seems unable to squint, and her brow never furrows.\n\n“There was an article once about my sister and I having an affair,” she says. “This is not the first time it’s come up for me.”\n\n“Cher is more of a loner right now than at any time since I’ve known her,” says someone who has known her a long time. The romance with Richie Sambora is rumored to be in its last days, but can Cher ever be a loner? When she finally left Sonny, back in 1974, it wasn’t because she was ready to go solo, but because she was read to sing a duet with herself.\n\n“Cher truly is a figment of her own imagination,” says her friend David Geffen, the entertainment mogul for whose company she records.\n\n“When we design the costumes for her, it has nothing to do with fashion,” says Bob Mackie. “It has nothing to do with anything but the fact that we are attempting to present to the world this…creature in her own right.”\n\nThe shock value of Cher’s exhibitionism, which Mackie helped mastermind, was the precursor of Madonna’s more evangelical prurience. “I must say, I understand Madonna,” Cher says. “But I can’t say that I like her. I understand wanting to make something out of yourself and working really hard and having people make it really difficult for you. But she’s too rude. For me to like Madonna, she’d have to be nicer.”\n\nOne thing Cher and Madonna have in common is Warren Beatty. “That was before Sonny,” she says. “Warren has probably been with everybody I know, and unfortunately I am one of them. But since I was only sixteen, maybe I can get out of it with that. I don’t know if I was a bimbo then, but I had pretty low self-esteem, and I had never really been around men. I still don’t know anything about them. But you want to know what? I honestly don’t care what people think of who I choose to be with.”\n\nMany people have been shocked by Cher’s successful propensity for younger men, including, before Sambora, Josh Donen, executive vice president of production at Universal; Gene Simmons of the rock band Kiss; Les Dudek, with whom she formed a band called Black Rose; Val Kilmer, the young actor she cast as Jim Morrison in her life long before Oliver Stone chose him to play the part in his movie based on the Doors; and, of course, Rob Camilletti, the actor, whom she discovered in a New York club on the night of her fortieth birthday, when he was twenty-two. “These are not American Gigolo relationships we are talking about,” says one of Cher’s friends. “She’s not some matron having a stud. These guys are all really smart. Take Rob. I certainly didn’t find him the stud bimbo.”\n\n“Val left me,” Cher says, “Robert left me,” as if her abandonment were a validation of their manliness. “The two of them were really young, and they were both looking for their own identity, and I’m a big shadow. The men I pick aren’t very much impressed with my lifestyle. I always pick men who are more work-ethic sorts. I like straight men.”\n\nThe man with whom she ended up right after her split with Sonny doesn’t exactly fit that description. David Geffen became not only Cher’s mentor during those first eighteen months but also her lover. “I know everybody thinks it’s bizarre,” says Cher, “but it was great. David was one of the best relationships I’ve ever had. He was different than he is now, because he was only thirty when I met him. He wasn’t very sure of himself, and he certainly wasn’t very sure of having a relationship with me. Neither of us intended it to happen. We just fell in love. We’ve said the meanest things to each other, but we always come back to being really close friends.”\n\n“Cher is an incredibly loving person,” says Geffen. “And incredibly willful.”\n\nAt forty-four, Cher seems finally to have willed herself to stop a lifelong habit of running away—from home at sixteen, from Sonny when she was in her twenties, even from the aging process, which she has tried to stave off with cosmetic surgery. There have been rumors, over the years—though she denies all but breast, teeth, and nose work—that she has had her buttocks lifted, two ribs removed to shrink her waist, her chin restructured, her cheeks reconstructed, her eyes lifted, her belly button reshaped, her lips collagen’d, and the planes of her face smoothed to windless surfaces.\n\nThrough it all, Cher—both sculptor and sculpture—has never lost her grip, has never cracked. The private person is an equal partner with the public persona. The brash tabloid diva is really a New Age mensch who has Patric Walker’s horoscope column in the New York Post faxed to her on a daily basis. Though Cher has become as famous for the many relationships in her life as she has for her talent, she is discovering that maybe she never really needed a boyfriend, or even a husband. Cher, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, is her own couple.\n\n“I’m in therapy and I think that’s good for me,” she says. “It’s been about two years. A couple of years ago I had three surgeries in a row, which made me feel unbelievably bad. It was supposed to be two surgeries, but it turned into three. There was a process between the last two that I had to go through, and it was the worst experience of my life. I was reading The Road Less Traveled, and out of the blue I called the doctor who wrote it, Scott Peck. I said, ‘Hi, I’m Cher. I’m having a really rough time. I need some help.’”\n\nCher’s new film, Mermaids, is a warped tribute to her mother, Georgia Holt, a perennially aspiring singer and actress in Hollywood who is frighteningly youthful-looking for a woman of sixty-three. Even though Cher bought her a white Mercedes three months ago, at the moment they are not speaking. “Every once in a while I miss my mother,” says Cher, “but it’s better for me right now for us not to talk. Because we weren’t communicating, and it was starting to wear on me heavily.” The character called Mrs. Flax in Mermaids is always in a state of flux; she moves her two daughters from town to town at the drop of a love affair. “My mother was Mrs. Flax,” says Cher. “She dressed really provocatively. We lived with all women in our house, too. She had three best friends, and they were beautiful women. My God, these women were knockouts! It was sort of like me and my girlfriends, I guess.”\n\n“When I saw Mermaids, I went, ‘Jesus Christ, is that the way I did with my children?’” says Georgia Holt, smiling. “And Cher says, ‘Mother, do you know how many times you made us move?’ But I was always trying to move us to a better place. And I also don’t remember being, you know, a sex machine. Maybe I was. When I went in to get a part, my agent always told me to wet my lips and pad my bra, do the number, and that’s what I did.”\n\nWe are sitting in the St. James’s Club in Los Angeles. With six husbands behind her, Holt is still extraordinarily beautiful. A beige sweater shows off a perfect figure beneath a beige linen coat. Her frosted hair is a palette of beiges. Though fair-skinned, she looks remarkably like Cher. Or, more precisely, Cher now looks like Holt.\n\nCher’s father, a gambler and drug addict, abandoned the family when she was only a few months old, and Holt, unable to support a child, had to put her in a Catholic home. It took her months to save up the money to retrieve Cher. “That mother superior was a bitch to me. She wanted me to put Cher up for adoption. I would go over and look through this little window, and Cher would be standing at her crib crying. I didn’t know how to buck authority then. But now, boy, I’m telling you, I’d go through that woman so fast she wouldn’t know what hit her.\n\n“I think the anger Cher has toward me now is that I was real beautiful and blonde,” Holt says. “I won several beauty contests. And she was dark. Nobody ever thought she was my child. And then Georganne comes along, this little blonde, blue-eyed beauty. I think Cher felt she was the ugly duckling. She never believed she was pretty. Of course, I never believed I was, either. My mother was highly critical of me, and even to this day I can’t own beauty. Maybe that’s what it is with Cher. She can’t own it, either.”\n\n“We were lying on the floor one night watching a video of Giant,” recalls Mark Patton, who acted with Cher in Come Back to the 5 & Dime Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean. “She turned to me during one of Elizabeth Taylor’s scenes and whispered, ‘When did you first know?’ I told her I was five when I knew I wanted to be an actor. I’ll never forget her response. ‘I just wanted to be famous,’ she said. ‘The first thing I did when I learned to write was to practice my autograph.’”\n\n“I never knew that Cher was going to hit the heights she has until she and Sonny opened at my brother’s club, the Purple Onion, on Sunset,” Georgia Holt told me. “It reminded me of when I was getting my second divorce in Vegas. I was lonesome for Cher, so my mother brought her over. I bought her a little velvet dress and Mary Jane shoes—she couldn’t have been more than four years old. Frankie Laine was real popular then, and I took her to one of his shows. We sat right at ringside, and Frankie Laine sang ‘Little Coquette’ to her. And she just…well, you know when somebody lights up? That’s what she did at my brother’s club. It wasn’t even the voice. There was just tremendous power. And some kind of shining quality.”\n\nCherilyn Sarkisian La Piere (Sarkisian was her father’s name; La Piere was the name of her mother’s fifth husband, who adopted her) met Salvatore Phillip Bono at Aldo’s, an L.A. coffee shop. Bono was a general assistant to record producer Phil Spector, and he pushed Cher to sing backup for some of Spector’s artists. Spector noticed her and produced her very first song, “Ringo, I Love You,” which she recorded under the name Bonnie Jo Mason.\n\nSonny married Cher in 1964. They first billed themselves as Caesar and Cleo, and finally hit it big in 1965 with the single “I Got You Babe,” which sold more than three million copies. A string of lesser hits followed, but soon their career was in trouble. For five years they struggled to make ends meet. In 1971, CBS offered them a summer variety show, and they again found favor with the public. The show and the marriage were canceled in 1974. The next year, Cher attempted a solo show on CBS, but it was not a hit. Neither was the revised Sonny and Cher Show, which CBS tried to promote in 1976.\n\nCher turned to Vegas, but the glitzy grind frustrated her, and she couldn’t get work as an actress in Hollywood. Unbowed, she moved to New York. Robert Altman cast her in Jimmy Dean. Mike Nichols saw her in it and cast her in Silkwood. Her fortitude had paid off.\n\n“The way that Cher functions is quite extraordinary,” says Eric Stoltz, who portrayed her son in Mask, for which she won the best-actress award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1985. “There is absolutely no bullshit about her. She is incapable of self-censorship.”\n\n“It’s not that I can’t accept no,” Cher explains. “I just don’t believe it. If I believed no, then I wouldn’t be in any of the places that I am.”\n\nBohdan Zachary, who was executive vice president of Cher’s film-production company for its first two years and is now a producer at the Fox network, insists that she is not the confrontational person that people on the Mermaids set had to deal with. “Cher is very low-key. Internally, I think, she must have some kind of scars from the Sonny period. She was intimidated by him. I think she lost so much of her life to that period that she decided she was going to be her own woman.”\n\n“I don’t talk to Sonny anymore unless I have to,” Cher says. “Sonny didn’t even love me, I don’t think. He just didn’t want me to get away from him. I certainly don’t miss him. It just seems like another person was with him, when I look back on it. It’s amazing when you get old—you do have all these lives. If I met that person now, I’d tolerate her.”\n\nCher’s reputation for being difficult began during the filming of Mask, when she and her director, Peter Bogdanovich, developed a famous enmity. Many of the problems stemmed from Bogdanovich’s approach. Cher doesn’t take orders very well. “People can manipulate her in a very clever way and she doesn’t even know it,” says Zachary. “I would find that certain people in her professional life were able to tell her what to do by not telling her what to do.”\n\nBob Mackie agrees. “There is a teenage-girl quality to Cher,” he says. “If you tell her that she can’t wear a certain dress, that it’s not quite right, then you’ll see it in every newspaper the next day.”\n\n“We are like single girls back in the seventies again,” says Paulette Betts about the women who surround Cher like a floating slumber party, which, when her schedule permits, includes Michelle Pfeiffer. “Chastity called the other day,” Cher says, “and we were all doing face masks or something, and she said, ‘You girls are like teenagers.’ Our topics of conversation are even still the same. It’s all about men and our bodies.”\n\nIf there is one thing Cher loves more than men, it is women. She obviously finds a solace in their company that surpasses sexuality. But how does a woman in the music business deal with the ramifications of the misogyny that is so inbred in it, not only in its boardrooms but also increasingly in the lyrics that are being sold to the public? “Well, if you’re talking about rap music, I have to admit that it is hard for me to defend it. The tone against women in rap music isn’t helpful to anybody. It isn’t about black against white; it’s about people against their own people.”\n\nSurprisingly, she defends the work of the controversial comic Andrew Dice Clay. “I took my son, Elijah, to see him. What he talks about…well, it’s every teenage boy’s fantasy to be able to dominate a girl. It’s maybe part of growing up. I think if women felt their power more, then they wouldn’t take it so personally. When I listen to someone else like him, I don’t pay any attention to it. Elijah doesn’t really take it seriously either, I don’t think. He laughs at it, but he’s going through puberty full-tilt-boogie and he’s terrified of women, and he’s hoping you can have that kind of control over them. He lives in a world dominated by women. He sees women kicking ass and taking names.”\n\nCher’s audience is cross-generational, and she convincingly fulfills all of their fantasies: wicked daughter, strict mother, wanton whore, feminist folk hero. It is a part of her native genius, and it borders on the political in its demographic savviness.\n\nPolitics is a passion of hers. The friendship she developed with Meryl Streep on the set of Silkwood has deepened through their shared commitment to environmental causes. And she became involved with the plight of the homeless while filming Suspect in Washington, D.C., where she struck up a close friendship with homeless activist Mitch Snyder. She took time off from her tour to attend his funeral after he committed suicide. Her other heroes include her friends Jane Fonda and Gloria Steinem, as well as Malcolm X. She also admires Jimmy Carter and recalls his first night in office. “Gregory [Allman] was from Georgia, and we supported him, so after the inauguration we were sort of just looking around the White House when Miz Lillian stuck her head out from around the corner and asked us to stay for dinner.”\n\nA professed wicked-daughter liberal, Cher the strict mother can be downright conservative on certain issues, even if they affect her professionally. For instance, she is for the labeling of records as obscene content. “It’s a real tough call, but movies are rated. I don’t know why everybody makes a big deal about rating albums, because young people buy them. When they pulled my video from MTV, I understood it. [MTV refused to air her video of “If I Could Turn Back Time” before nine P.M. because of her lewd costume and cannon-straddling antics with thousands of nineteen-year-old sailors.] I didn’t care that they banned it. I really didn’t. It might not be suitable for very young children.”\n\nOne of the most glaring contradictions about Cher’s politics is the support she is receiving on her tour from the Coors Brewing Company, the principle owner of which, the Coors family, is an influential donor to a Jesse Helms wish list of right-wing causes and organizations. Through clever marketing, Coors is attempting to soften its image with America’s more moderate beer drinkers. Cher is the latest member of the left that the company has co-opted. For four dates on the tour, Cher agreed to be affiliated with Coors so that the company-sponsored literacy campaign could be publicized and earn its money through promotional channels instead of being strictly endowed. “I don’t give a fuck what people think about what I’m doing,” she says. “I think it’s important to do literacy work, so if people don’t like Coors, fuck ‘em. I don’t see a lot of other people spending money to teach grownups and children how to read. It’s not like I drink Coors and I’m saying to everybody to go out and drink it. But who gives a shit? I’m just living my life. I’m not a role model. I’m not running for office.”\n\nPeople have jokingly said that if Sonny could be elected mayor of Palm Springs, then Cher might make a good governor of California. Cher laughs, but has to agree. “Yeah. O.K. That’ll be a good place for me at sixty.”\n\n‘What the fuck?” Cher says when she enters her dressing room at the Oakland Coliseum, where she is performing after her Connecticut show. “In most of these places they’ve still got jockstraps hanging from the pipes,” she adds, giggling. Tonight the room looks like a Gypsy fortune-teller’s storefront parlor. The walls have been draped with fringed fabric. Peacock feathers sprout from a vase. A gold ceramic cupid is hung from one wall. On another hangs a ceramic bust of Cleopatra, her nipples broken off. Inside, around Cher’s dressing table, are many stuffed animals, including a white tiger that was a present from Siegfried and Roy, the well-coiffed Las Vegas magicians. A huge autographed poster of a female bodybuilder adorns the wall by her mirror. Ugly but heartfelt Cher portraits, painted by her fans, are propped up around the table. Family snapshots are taped to the mirror next to those of her with a few of the facially deformed children who have been helped by her pet charity, the International Craniofacial Foundation.\n\nThe decibel level of the female court is high tonight. Debbie Paull, Cher’s personal assistant for many years, is telling everyone who will listen about getting her lips tattooed. Her swollen mouth, a bit scabbed right now, has been outlined in red by a tattoo needle in order to make her lips appear more voluptuous. Cher and her friends are amazed that Paull had the guts to go through with the procedure. It is all they can talk about until Cher has to leave to do her show.\n\nThe next night we are in her hotel room in San Francisco. The bed is a canopied one, and open Louis Vuitton luggage is spread out around it on the floor, clothes streaming from the bags like fountains of fabric. Cher is wearing ripped jeans. No makeup masks her extraordinary beauty. She has on a black crocheted top that reveals her perfect belly button. She and Paulette have been shopping on her day off, and the purchases she is most proud of are her new crystals, which come equipped with stands fashioned from opium pipes. She silently holds them up to the light. About her on the bed are more beaded necklaces; she is now making more intricate ones for herself.\n\nCher is much more relaxed than she was on the bus. “When you and I were on the road I had a lump in my breast,” she explains. “I decided not to go to a doctor out on the road, because if there was something wrong with me, then it would hit the papers. It was three weeks that I waited, and I was really frightened. When I got back, I went in and had a mammogram and a sonogram. I was fine; it was just a cyst. But I was so nervous about it.”\n\nHome for Cher is an ever changing place. She sold her New York apartment above Tower Records to rap entrepreneur Russell Simmons for $1.6 million, and her famous Egyptian palace on Mulholland Drive in Los Angeles to Eddie Murphy for $6.5 million. She recently purchased an Aspen getaway for $2.5 million and a new Malibu home for more than $4 million, and will spend an extra $2 million improving it while she builds yet another dream mansion in Malibu on a two-acre bluff overlooking the Pacific which she bought for $3 million. “I cut the plans down to 12,000 square feet from 16,000,” she says with an air of practicality.\n\nThe new Malibu home sounds perfect for parties. “When you work so much, you want your peaceful time,” says Cher. “You don’t care about being with the ‘in’ group. To my friends I’m a notorious hermit. I’m also a terrible hostess. Paulette loves it. That’s what makes Paulette and I perfect together. We did have a party the other day, and I went up and read. I want everybody to have a great time and I want to supply it. But I don’t want to be it.”\n\n“It’s a beautiful piece of land,” Paulette says of the property on the bluff. “It juts out over the beach all by itself. It’s like being the queen of Malibu.”\n\n“I call what I want from my new house ‘prehistoric futuristic,’” says Cher. “I like things made of stone and I like everything one color—very beige. I’m using the house that I’m living in now as a prototype for the next one. I just do it as I do it. It’s like designing my beads.”\n\nOr her body. Her favorite tattoo parlor is Red Devil, an all-female one on La Brea in Los Angeles, and the tattoo count on her body has just risen to six with the latest addition down her left arm. The largest to date, it is a necklace that holds an array of charms. “I don’t know why I like tattoos so much. I know it’s crazy. I can’t defend them. I’ve had some of my tattoos for twenty years. I love getting them. The women at Red Devil do piercing too. Now, I’m really frightened of piercing. That seems so extreme—like noses and lips and belly buttons and nipples and tongues.”\n\nBut how about the cosmetic surgery she’s undergone? “I don’t know why people are preoccupied with my cosmetic surgery,” Cher says. “I really don’t. It mystifies me that people would care what I do to my body. I remember when I was young, all the people that were really popular—Sandra Dee and Doris Day—were people I really couldn’t identify with. So then you feel inhibited and you feel ashamed, or you feel less good because you don’t look in style, so I think what you have to do is create your own style. Everyone can say that they hate what Michael Jackson has done to himself. But it’s none of our business. Just because you become famous shouldn’t deter you from doing what you want with your life. If you let that happen, then you become like Elvis, where you have no life at all. I’m not just talking about cosmetic changes; it translates into your everyday life.”\n\nBut what, at the source, causes the need for such drastic physical resculpting? With so much painful surgery involved, isn’t it a fine line one must walk between the self-loving reasons for it (I love myself, therefore I will make myself more beautiful) and the self-loathing ones (I hate myself, therefore I will submit myself to this torture)? “If I tried to tell you which of those I fall under, I couldn’t do it,” Cher says softly, “because I really don’t know.”\n\nShe slides from the bed and kneels beside it. She reaches for the largest crystal—a beige orb—and holds it up to the lamp’s light. She seems intensely interested in the prism’d patterns, as if the orb were a crystal ball and all were revealed before her.\n\nCher puts her face closer to the crystal. “This is the color of my houses,” she whispers, sounding as seductive as an ageless astrologer—not possessive, like a real-estate addict, or a rock diva, or a Righteous Mother. For the first time I see Cher dare to squint, and a few finely etched wrinkles, as feathery as the patterns embedded in the crystal, suddenly appear."
