        "text": "This article first appeared on Billboard.com.\n\nCher says her record label “hasn’t got a great deal of interest in my CD” and that the “decision makers” at the company “don’t seem to care that much.”\n\nCher released her most recent album, Closer to the Truth, last September on Warner Bros. Records. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart, marking the diva’s highest charting solo album ever.\n\nCher took to Twitter on Thursday, Feb. 6, to gripe about her label but noted that “not all” the folks at the company are indifferent, adding that “there (are) hard working adorable” people there, too.\n\nSo far, Closer to the Truth has sold 285,000 copies in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan. It debuted with 63,000 in its first week. The album was her first studio release since 2002’s Living Proof. Cher has been with the Warner family of labels since 1996.\n\nWarner Bros. Records has not responded to Billboard’s email request for comment.\n\nCloser to the Truth has notched two hit singles on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart: “Woman’s World” hit No. 1 last year, and “Take It Like a Man” recently peaked at No. 2 for two weeks.\n\nCher’s been extra busy as of late, preparing for her upcoming Dressed to Kill concert tour, which kicks off on Mar. 22 in Phoenix. The trek will be her first since her successful Farewell Tour, which circled the globe from 2002 through 2005."
