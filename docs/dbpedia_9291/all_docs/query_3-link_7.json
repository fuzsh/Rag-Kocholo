        "text": "Here is a list of some of my vinyl collection by Cher/Sonny and Cher that I consider to be rare. Have you guys ever heard any of these?\n\nSonny and Cher single only from UK You Gotta Have a Thing Of Your Own (never on CD) on Red Atlantic label 584215 from 1968 2:48 b/w I Got You Babe\n\nCher - Ma Piano (Per Non Svegliarmi) Lib 12049 b/w Nel Mio Cielo Ci Sei Tu (neither of these on cd)\n\nCher- Chastity's Song (Band of Theieves) Atco 45-6684 from the 1969 film 'Chastity' b/w I Walk on Guilded Splinters. Both badly remastered on cd by Rhino handmade. Altho I don't think the mono single mix of I Walk on Guilded Splinters was included.\n\nCher and Harry Nilsson - A Love Like Yours SPS 0402 on Warner/Spector b/w (Just Enough to Keep me) Hangin' On (never on cd)\n\nI have two copies of Sonny and Cher's last single on WBR in 1977 from their last album which remains unreleased in its entirety to this day. WBS 8341 \"You're Not Right for Me\" b/w \"Wrong Number\" one is a promo with Stereo/Mono WBS 8341 (never on cd)\n\nCher - Some Guys is the B side to the \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" single (never on cd)\n\nCher - A Woman's Story/ Baby, I Love You 1974 on Warner/Spector SPS 0400 (never on cd)\n\nSonny and Cher - You're a Friend of Mine b/w Sonny solo I Would Marry You Today Atco 45-6683 (never on cd) 1969 I believe it doesn't say on the vinyl\n\nSonny solo under the name of Little Tootsie - Comin' Down the Chimney I have two copies of this one has some other artist on the flip side the 2nd has another Sonny solo track called \"One Little Answer\" on Specialty Records there doesn't seem to be a catalog number for this one\n\nSonny and Cher - Get it Together on Atco 6758 b/w Hold You Tighter (again no year but i think it's 1969) (never on cd)\n\nSonny and Cher - Circus (never on cd) on Atco 6555X b/w I Would Marry You Today (Sonny solo)\n\nSonny and Cher - Petit Homme (Sonny and Cher sing their hit \"Little Man\" in French) b/w Mais Tu Es A Moi (their hit \"But You're Mine\" in French) Atco F 117X (never on cd)\n\nI also have the 4 sealed albums Cher did for WBR. Stars from 1975 produced by Jimmy Webb, I'd Rather Believe in You 1976 produced by Steve Barri and Michael Omartian, Allman and Woman - Two The Hard Way (with Gregg Allman) 1977, and Cherished 1977 produced by Snuff Garrett and Al Capps. All four of these are sealed and have never been put on cd either. I spent some time reviewing the vinyl as well. I noticed that most all of them are pretty prestine...but they may need some professional cleaning. I don't have a turntable or unfortunately, the finances to afford the nice setups I read about here but I was hoping someone might be interested in this material.\n\nI would love to find somebody to 'drop them.\n\nTo answer your question Reader, the b side to A Love Like Yours is a solo Cher song from her 1969 album '3614 Jackson Hwy'.\n\nThe Cher and Gregg album along with the other 3 albums Cher did on that same WBR label will likely never be released to CD unless Cher has something to do with it because she owns them all...I'd be willing to bet she may even have the master tapes. Someone actually wrote in to Rolling Stone or Billboard (cant remember which) and they featured the response in an issue and it was about the 1st album Cher did on WBR in 1975 called Stars and they stated they did some research and found Cher owned the albums. Another interesting fact is that Cher put a lot of money out of her own pocket into the Allman and Woman album at the time."
