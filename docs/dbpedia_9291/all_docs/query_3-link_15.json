        "text": "Yes this album was really excellent. I feel like Cher has taken a few artistic chances over the years with 3614 JACKSON HIGHWAY, STARS, ALLMAN AND WOMAN, BLACK ROSE, IT'S A MAN'S WORLD and this album, and sadly none were big commercial or critical successes as far as I can recall. Cher deserves more respect for her music over the years and I truly wish she'd move away from the autotune vocals. I would love Cher to tour with just a band and perhaps an orchestra and just SING! No dancers, costume changes and an extravagant stage -- just Cher singing...\n\nI really like Cher. I saw her twice on the Farewell Tour in 2004. I lived in Malibu briefly and used to drive past what was then her home on the Pacific Coast Highway, daily. The Sonny era is my favourite and the Kapp records are good too. I have everything of hers (okay, not the Chastity soundtrack yet) and the only records I don’t play much are Living Proof and Love Hurts. IMHO the influence of men over her personal life is overestimated. Cher’s ambition and her drive are a match for and exceed that of many of the men she was with. I see the Sonny relationship very differently to others here. The way I see it, he was always struggling to meet Cher’s expectations. And yet what Sonny achieved, with so little natural talent of his own to work with, is extraordinary. He had some skills as a record producer. The rest was chutzpah or its Italian equivalent. But what really matters is Cher’s body of work. It is inconsistent certainly. But taken as a whole, it’s a remarkable legacy. It’s regrettable that it is frequently overlooked in favour of dresses and hair. I deplore the fact that Bob Mackie’s name appears now to more closely associated with Cher than Sonny’s is. Obviously, Mackie made a contribution. One cannot hear it on the records."
