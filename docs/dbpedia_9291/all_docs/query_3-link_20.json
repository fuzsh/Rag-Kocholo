        "text": "Get to know Alexander \"AE\" Edwards.\n\nThe music executive made headlines when he was first photographed holding hands with Cher in November 2022.\n\nIn the days that followed, the music legend received criticism for the 40-year age gap between the two. But true to form, Cher responded on Twitter with a series of tweets implying that she wasn't bothered by the age difference.\n\nAmong the string of Twitter posts, the \"Believe\" superstar confirmed her relationship with Edwards when she shared a photo of him, simply writing, \"Alexander ❤️.\" When asked if he was her \"new man,\" she responded with a \"🥰\" emoji, and to another Twitter user, she simply said, \"Love doesn't know math.\"\n\nCher spoke about her boyfriend again in December 2022, while appearing on The Kelly Clarkson Show. \"On paper, it's kind of ridiculous,\" the singer said of their relationship. \"But in real life, we get along great. He's fabulous. And I don't give men qualities that they don't deserve.\"\n\nEdwards is no stranger to the spotlight or dating in the music industry. He was previously in a relationship with Amber Rose for three years before calling it quits in August 2021, with Rose appearing to accuse Edwards of cheating on her with at least 12 different people. The exes share a son together.\n\nFrom his family history to his musical background, here's everything to know about Edwards.\n\nHe's a music executive at Universal Music Group\n\nEdwards works as a music executive at Universal Music Group, one of three major record labels in the industry along with Sony Music and Warner Music Group. Some of the artists on its roster include Post Malone, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande.\n\nHe produced music on Tyga's record label\n\nIn addition, Edwards is a music producer and artist who's worked on rapper Tyga's independent label Last Kings Records. He has a close friendship with the hip-hop artist; they're often seen in each other's photos or stepping out together in L.A.\n\nHe shares a child with ex-girlfriend Amber Rose\n\nEdwards and Amber Rose welcomed a child together in October 2019. The couple (who split in 2021 after multiple instances of infidelity) made sure to give their baby a very musical name, Slash Electric Alexander Edwards.\n\nIn March 2024, Rose appeared on The Jason Lee Podcast and discussed Slash's relationship with Cher.\n\n\"I’m very happy that [Alexander is] with Cher because it creates stability for when [our] son goes over there,” she said. \"It's not all mayhem and stuff.\"\n\nHe met Cher during Paris Fashion Week\n\nEdwards and Cher met for the first time at Paris Fashion Week in September 2022. Although they weren't photographed together at the time, the Grammy winner posed for photos with Edwards' friend Tyga.\n\nIn September 2023, Edwards and Cher attended PFW as a full-fledged couple. The pair sat front row at the Balmain Womenswear Spring/Summer 2024 show.\n\nHe's 40 years younger than Cher\n\nEdwards is 37 years old and Cher is 77, but the Grammy winner isn't fazed by the decades between the two. \"LOVE DOESN'T KNOW MATH, IT SEES ❤️ ❤️,\" Cher wrote in a since-deleted tweet captured by The Shade Room.\n\nCher has a history of dating men her junior, including Val Kilmer, Tom Cruise and Rob Camilletti in the 1980s.\n\n\"The truth was if I hadn't gone out with younger men, I would have never had a date,\" Cher told PEOPLE in 2021. \"Younger men weren't intimidated by older women. But older men in my age category, they weren't having it.\"\n\nIn October 2023, Cher spoke to PEOPLE about finding love in her seventies.\n\n\"What I learned is that it’s never too late,\" she said. \"If you wrote out all the statistics, you would go, ‘Well, this is doomed.’ But we’ve been together a year, and if it was just a year, it would’ve been worth it. I’ve had the best time.\"\n\nCher continued, \"He’s special. No matter what happens, I love being with him. He makes me laugh, and we have fun.\"\n\nHe bought Cher an engagement-like ring\n\nEngagement rumors began swirling after Edwards bought Cher a massive diamond ring for Christmas.\n\n\"THERE R NO WORDS,\" the \"Believe\" singer captioned an image of the ring on Twitter.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Cher showed off her new bling in a photo with Edwards — but she was not wearing the diamond on her ring finger.\n\nIn February 2023, a source told PEOPLE that the couple \"aren't talking marriage\" just yet.\n\n\"They are very much in love. They are exclusive and serious,\" the source added. \"Cher likes that he's young. It's exciting for her.\"\n\nHe helped Cher cope with the loss of her mother\n\nIn December 2022, Cher's mother died at the age of 96. A music industry source later told PEOPLE that Cher's relationship with Edwards \"has helped ease the pain of the loss.\"\n\nThe source also weighed in on the engagement-like ring that Edwards bought the \"Strong Enough\" singer for Christmas, calling it a \"nice and beautiful gift.\"\n\nA second insider said: \"The ring was the perfect present to help her get through this bittersweet time.\"\n\nHe has worked on music with Cher\n\nEdwards collaborated with Cher on her first-ever holiday album, Christmas, which was released in October 2023.\n\n\"He's a producer and a writer. He does everything, so I'm happy about that,\" she told E! News.\n\nCher fell in love with him via text\n\nDuring a Chicken Shop Date with Amelia Dimoldenberg, Cher opened up about her first texting conversation with Edwards.\n\n\"I left to go to Switzerland, and he texted me. He said, 'Where are you going?' I said, 'I'm going to Switzerland, I'm a little tired.' And then he wrote me, 'Well, get some rest babyyy.' And I went, he doesn't know me well enough to put three y's on baby,\" the \"Believe\" singer said. \"I was kind of pissed off. And then he just started texting me.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I told my friends, don't fall in love with a younger man, we're too old, and don't ever fall in love by text. There goes that theory.\"\n\nHe and Cher have walked many red carpets together\n\nSince getting together, Cher and Edwards have attended numerous high-profile events, including Balmain's Paris Fashion Week show and the Equal Justice Now Awards. The couple also walked the red carpet at the iHeartRadio Music Awards, where the \"Believe\" singer was honored with the icon award."
