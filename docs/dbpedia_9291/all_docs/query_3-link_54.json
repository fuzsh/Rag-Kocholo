        "text": "If any of Cher’s songs best describe her ability to overcome any challenges thrown her way, the two most likely choices are “Strong Enough” and “Believe.”\n\nChallenges of a dyslexic movie star\n\nHer exotic looks: One would think Cher would love her dark beauty. But like so many stunning women, she actually hated her exotic appearance which she inherited from her father, a truck driver of Armenian descent. (Source: legendary-celebrity\n\nHer tumultuous early years: Cher found herself in foster care several times when her mother, a struggling actress, simply couldn’t make a living for herself and her daughter.\n\nHer inability to read: As Cher herself said: “I never read in school. I got really bad grades, D’s and F’s and C’s in some classes, and A’s and B’s in other classes.” She did manage to earn good grades in a few subjects, excelling in French and English classes. Small wonder – Cher was diagnosed with dyslexia when she was in her 30s.\n\nHer struggles in school led to her dropping out: Despite her intelligence and natural flair for creativity, Cher found school an incredibly trying experience.\n\n“In the second week of the 11th grade, I just quit. When I was in school, it was really difficult. Almost everything I learned, I had to learn by listening. My report cards always said that I was not living up to my potential.”\n\nSource: David Morgan Education\n\nA Vision and a Determination to Succeed\n\nCher, (full name Cherilyn Sarkisian) was born in 1946 in California. From the moment she saw her first movie, Disney’s Dumbo, this iconic celebrity was determined to become a “star.”\n\nLike her mother, Cher took up acting. A former classmate vouched for Cher’s undeniable charisma. “I’ll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special … She was like a movie star, right then and there … She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would.” Not too shabby for a poor kid with dyslexia.\n\nHowever, it was her singing that launched her career. Together with Sonny Bono, she recorded “I Got You Babe” and “Baby Don’t Go.” As a soloist, she recorded hits that included “If I Could Turn Back Time,” “Believe,” and “I Found Someone.” Of course, “The Sonny and Cher” show, which premiered in 1971, solidified her singing career and introduced millions of viewers to her comedic flair. But this world-renowned singer and a much-beloved TV personality didn’t stop there. She also pursued a career in films which culminated with an Academy Award for her role in the film Moonstruck.\n\nHow did Cher copes with dyslexia?\n\nLike so many other celebrities who are dyslexic, Cher had the determination to succeed and a voice and talent that took her to the top. She may not have liked her appearance, but she made it work for her, with outrageous outfits that could not be overlooked.\n\nCher has said that she finds it easy to cope now. She always reads her scripts slowly at first and then is able to memorize her lines quickly without a problem. Her dyslexia may slow down her reading, but it never hindered her from becoming a great actress and singer.\n\nThe Dyslexic who Succeeded\n\nHer unique accomplishments were recognized by President Reagan on October 31, 1985 when Cher was included among several other prominent people as “outstanding learning disabled achievers” in a ceremony in the White House. Wow!\n\nStill Going Strong\n\nReleased in June 2013, when Cher was 67 years young, “Woman’s World” is, by the singer’s own estimation, her best work. Then, in 2018, Cher was cast as Meryl Streep’s mother in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again. Once again, Cher proved that she is ageless, timeless and legendary.\n\nBut if you think Cher is resting on her laurels, think again. In 2019, you can catch her at MGM Resorts in Vegas if you’re lucky enough to get a hot ticket.\n\nStill can’t get enough Cher. Get a ticket to The Cher Show on Broadway. “This is a look behind the headlines to see what Cher was actually going through during her life’s many roller coasters. Cher worked with book writer Rick Elice to share the details and experiences of her amazing story and has been closely involved with the show’s development. Cher is “portrayed by three different actresses, each representing different eras of her life.”\n\nCher’s experience as a dyslexic is a thread throughout the show. In the 50s, when Cher was a child, dyslexia and learning disabilities were labeled a form of mental retardation. In the first act, we see how Cher was bullied and shamed throughout her school days. The show does not skimp on the difficulties Cher had to overcome. As a young adult, she couldn’t even read the contracts she signed and had to rely on her husband, Sonny Bono, to look out for her welfare. To this day, Cher has trouble navigating the written word. But did she let it stop her? No way! That’s the inspiring theme of Cher, a biographical musical that will leave you uplifted and singing Cher’s hit songs.\n\nSo, is this dyslexic, high school dropout “strong enough” to beat all the odds? Believe it.\n\nSources:"
