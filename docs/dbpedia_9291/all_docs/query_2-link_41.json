To satisfy viewer demand, the theme was made into a full song and released as a single.\n\nRock LobsterThe B-52s\n\nVegetarian Fred Schneider of the B-52's got the idea for \"Rock Lobster\" at an Atlanta disco when a projector displayed images of lobsters on a grill.\n\nYou Should Be DancingBee Gees\n\nStephens Stills played timbales on the Bee Gees hit, \"You Should Be Dancing.\" He was in the next door studio laying down a Crosby, Stills and Nash album and could hear Saturday Night Fever being recorded. Stills recognized its potential to be a monster hit and he wanted to contribute.\n\nBrand New BookTrain\n\nTrain wrote the 2011 song \"Brand New Book\" for the TV show The Biggest Loser - part of the song was used in the opening credits.\n\nSpace OddityDavid Bowie\n\nDavid Bowie's \"Space Oddity\" tells the story of an astronaut who cuts off communication and floats into space. The BBC used it extensively in their coverage of the 1969 moon landing - an odd choice considering the lyrics.\n\nShe's A RainbowThe Rolling Stones\n\nIt was never a big hit, but \"She's A Rainbow\" became one of the most popular Rolling Stones songs in the digital age when it started showing up in commercials (iMac, Photoshop), and TV shows (American Horror Story: Coven, Ted Lasso).\n\nThe Punk Photography of Chris SteinSong Writing\n\nChris Stein of Blondie shares photos and stories from his book about the New York City punk scene.\n\nWhich Restaurants Are Most Mentioned In Song Lyrics?Song Writing\n\nKaty Perry mentions McDonald's, Beyonc√© calls out Red Lobster, and Supertramp shouts out Taco Bell - we found the 10 restaurants most often mentioned in songs.\n\nEmmylou HarrisSongwriter Interviews\n\nShe thinks of herself as a \"song interpreter,\" but back in the '80s another country star convinced Emmylou to take a crack at songwriting."
