        "text": "The Today Show With Cher.jpg\n\nCher, seen here in a performance on NBC's \"Today\" show on Sept. 23, 2013 in New York City. (AP photo).\n\nThere probably isn't much that Cher's devoted legion of followers don't know about her, but the more casual fan may be surprised at some of the lesser-known facts about the pop diva.\n\nCher will bring her always-larger-than-life show to Mohegan Sun Arena on Saturday. At age 67 – and more than 50 of those years in the public spotlight – there isn't a lot for people to discover about the singer.\n\nBut here are 10 facts that may have escaped you over the years.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nEvent:\n\nCher in concert\n\nWhen:\n\nSaturday, 8 p.m.\n\nWhere:\n\nMohegan Sun Casino, Uncasville, Conn.\n\nCost:\n\n$124.75 and $154.75\n\nFor more info:\n\nCall (800) 745-3000 or online at\n\n• Long before she became the mononymical pop goddess, Cher's voice could be heard on numerous hits–as a background vocalist. She sang on such Phil Spector-produced songs as \"Be My Baby,\" by The Ronettes, The Crystals' \"Da Do Ron Ron,\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" among others.\n\n• Cher did put out a few records of her own before becoming part of the successful Sonny and Cher duo with husband Sonny Bono. But you will have a hard time finding them if you search under her name. Her first single was 1964's \"Ringo, I Love You\" but it was released under the stage name Bonnie Jo Mason.\n\n• Speaking of her name, although she was born Cher Sarkisian, she had it legally changed to just Cher in 1978.\n\n• Speaking of her name, part two: When she first started performing with Sonny, they did so under the name \"Caesar and Cleo.\" Sonny mainly wanted to promote Cher as a solo act, but sang harmonies.\n\n• When she was a teenager, Cher was arrested for stealing a car, but the story isn't quite as dramatic as it sounds. She was watching a friend's car while he was running an errand and when he took too long, she decided to take it to the drive-in theater. The incident was more embarrassing than criminal.\n\n• Cher is one of just six people to have achieved both a No. 1 single and an Oscar for acting. The others are Frank Sinatra, Jamie Foxx, Barbra Steisand, Bing Crosby, and Judy Garland (who received an Honorary Oscar in 1939).\n\n• Cher's acting talent seems to come from her mother's side. Her mom, Georgia Holt had roles on 1950s sitcoms \"I Love Lucy\" and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.\"\n\n• Cher's career is a testament to her longevity, but so is her success: She is the only female artist in history to have had U.S. No. 1 singles in the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s.\n\n• She turned down the part of Thelma in \"Thelma & Louise.\" The role later went to Geena Davis.\n\n• Cher never graduated from high school, having suffered from undiagnosed dyslexia as a child."
