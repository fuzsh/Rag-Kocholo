        "text": "Cher’s life story, in her own words, officially has a cover.\n\nThe music icon takes control of her narrative in her upcoming and deeply personal book, “Cher: The Memoir, Part One” — and TODAY has your first at the memoir, which will be published in the U.S. on Nov. 19, 2024.\n\nThe newly unveiled cover features a black-and-white photograph of Cher in her signature dark locks and winged eyeliner, her face resting on its side with her hand over her head.\n\nThe “Believe” singer’s name is boldly displayed in a transitioning blue to hot pink shade, with the rest of the memoir’s title at the bottom.\n\n“Cher: The Memoir, Part One,” published by Dey Street Books, an imprint of the William Morrow Group at HarperCollins Publishers, will give fans an inside look at the 78-year-old superstar's groundbreaking and successful career.\n\nIn the first part, Cher shares her story of growing up as a dyslexic child with a chaotic upbringing and dreams of becoming famous. She also touches on meeting and marrying Sonny Bono, and their tumultuous relationship that made them famous worldwide — yet drove them apart.\n\nKnown as singing duo Sonny & Cher, the couple married in 1964 and famously co-hosted “The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour” and “The Sonny & Cher Show.” They welcomed their first child together, Chaz Bono, in 1969. In 1974, Cher filed for divorce, which was finalized a year later.\n\nThe Grammy winner is also mother to son Elijah Blue Allman, whom she shared with her second ex-husband, the late Gregg Allman.\n\nCher’s story is described as “a life too immense for only one book,” by her publisher. “Cher: The Memoir, Part Two” is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nBack in November, while on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” Cher spoke about not being fully prepared to share her whole story with the world.\n\nAt the time, she didn’t have a title for her memoir, and Jimmy Fallon joked it should be called, “I Got Scoops Babe,” a play off her and Bono’s song “I Got You Babe.”\n\n“I just totally chickened out. I didn’t put in some things that need to be in, and they’re not comfortable,” she said. “But they need to be put in, so I have to go back and man up.”\n\nAdding, “I’ve lived too long and done too much, and so it’s like it should be the encyclopedia.”"
