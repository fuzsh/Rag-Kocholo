YOU AND CFS ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM.

Code tit. 10 § 5701 et seq, without regard to choice of law principles. (The AAA Rules are available at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.)

Unless you and we mutually agree otherwise, any in-person arbitration hearings between you and us will take place in the applicable jurisdiction listed in the table in Section 15 below.\n\nExcept as provided herein, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Terms are void, voidable or otherwise invalid.

Any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and we agree that neither party shall appeal any award of the arbitrator, including any appeal on a question of law, question of fact or question of mixed fact and law.\n\nWe will be responsible for paying any individual consumer's arbitration/arbitrator fees. If an individual consumer prevails on any claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to you under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 14(E) shall only apply to individual consumers.\n\nYou agree to an arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, NEITHER YOU NOR CFS WILL BE ENTITLED TO JOIN OR CONSOLIDATE CLAIMS BY OR AGAINST OTHER CUSTOMERS IN COURT OR IN ARBITRATION OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN ANY CLAIM AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. The arbitral tribunal shall not consolidate more than one person's claims and shall not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the jurisdiction set forth in Section 15 below.\n\nIf any provision of this Section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced; provided, that in the event subsection (F) is found to be unenforceable, all of this Section 14 shall be deemed null and void and of no effect.\n\nContracting Entity; Governing Law.
