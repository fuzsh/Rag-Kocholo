        "text": "We included these products chosen by Cher because we think you'll like her picks. Cher is a paid spokesperson for Ugg. E! has affiliate relationships, so we may get a commission if you purchase something through our links. Items are sold by the retailer, not E!. Prices are accurate as of publish time.\n\nWhen I had the opportunity to talk to Cher about the UGG \"FEEL ___\" campaign, I was shocked when the first words out of her mouth were about me (of all people). She said, \"I am so excited to talk to you. I am really excited because back in the day, I never got to talk to women. Very very few people who interviewed me were women. I mean, there were women, but they were not in the majority.\"\n\nThe icon recalled, \"Through history, we've had to fight for everything that we have gotten and it never came easy. There were no women executives in music. You were supposed to sing and then someone patted you on the head and then you went and sat down.\" Of course, some positive changes have been made, but there's still so much work to go, with Cher advising, \"You have to push the envelope and that's so cliche, but you have to. When men are forceful or know what they want, they're respected and viewed as 'tough.' When women are not even pushing it, but just say 'I can't do this. I'm not comfortable with that,' then they're thought of as a 'bitch,' when that isn't the case.\"\n\nCher reflected on her success, shared invaluable advice, and she dished on her UGG campaign in an exclusive interview with E! News.\n\nE!: Success isn't easy to come by, but you've been killing it for decades. When you reflect on that, what comes to mind?\n\nC: I chose to be an artist, but when you fail, you fail in front of the entire world. That's just something I took on. People don't realize that I have failed almost as many times as I've succeeded. It's just when you're in failure mode, nobody is interested. So nobody's aware that you're around and then you do something else and they go, 'Oh my God, you really reinvented yourself.' I've been the same since I was four. I've never actually reinvented myself.\n\nE! That's so funny that you think that because I feel like that concept of 'reinvention' and even the word itself is something that a lot of people associate with you.\n\nC: I know, but it's silly. It's just so silly. I mean, truthfully, I have been my same stubborn, funny self since, well, I wanted to run away from home when I was about four. I just had a suitcase packed. I went outside and I told my mom, 'It's getting dark. I'll go tomorrow.'\n\nE!: What are some things women should keep in mind to stick to their goals?\n\nC: I think if you're strong, try to be smart, trust your intuitions, and you're kind, you have half the battle won.\n\nI think kindness is major in life and I just learned it all from my mom and continued to expand on it in my life because I was able to. I learned so much from my mom about kindness. We were kind of poor, but my mom always found a way to show us that we had so much more than some people and she taught us to stop, talk, and help out. My sister and I were in the car going someplace and I never have any money for some reason. I saw a homeless man on the street and I'm talking to him. I yell to my sister, 'Jen, do we have any money?' And, then my sister goes, 'Oh my God, you're just like mom.' And, I went, 'Yeah.' In many ways, I'm just like mom. My mom is 95 and still an ass kicker."
