        "text": "I guess I loved Cher the most the night she showed up at the Academy Awards looking like a tarantula. The academy had, pointedly, failed to nominate her for her top-calibre work in ''Mask'' - a calculated disciplinary action that sent shivers down the spine of every former teen-age girl in the audience who had ever been called into the principal's office for yet another futile round of ''life style correction'' measures.\n\nCher's blasphemous black horror-show of a costume was her own way of thumbing her famous nose at the academy, in front of millions of witnesses. And furthermore, the act had movie-history resonance. I thought immediately of Scarlett O'Hara showing up in a flaming red ball gown at the main Atlanta social event of the season, after she'd just been publicly trapped in a sex scandal with another woman's husband.\n\nIt's possible that every generation needs a Cher. When Cher is bad, she's very satisfyingly bad, and when she's good, you can count on her not to make it into People that week.\n\nIf Cher's private life were a trivia game, many of us would be expert players, whether we want to admit to this or not. I personally can tell you where her crucial tattoos are, and the model of the plane she eloped with Greg Allman on in 1975, and the name of the character her half-sister Georganne once played on ''General Hospital.'' I can tell you the name of the New York disco where she met her current boyfriend, and that she was born in El Centro, Calif. I don't want to know these things, but I do.\n\nPerhaps there is a Federal law stating that the press must hold a major retrospective on Cher's career on roughly an annual basis, since they have been doing it for nearly a quarter of a century now, and I see little sign of their stopping. Plowing through the stack of clippings, you can usually carbon-date the article in question by boyfriend (statistical half-life: two years), although Cher herself always looks and sounds amazingly the same.\n\nMore than flesh-and-blood person, Cher has always been something of a public Rorschach test. When people tell you how they feel about her, they're really telling you just as much about themselves - in much the way that, when people give you their reasons for liking or disliking cats, it usually develops that cats themselves are rarely the issue.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
