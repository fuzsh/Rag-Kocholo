        "text": "The news of pop icon Cher launching her own gelato has got our mouths’ watering over the formula behind successful celebrity brands.\n\nAt TASTE, we've had the pleasure of working with brilliant examples like Veg trailblazer, Linda McCartney's. So, what's the magic formula?\n\nIt all boils down to tapping into culture while truly embracing the essence of the celebrity. Authenticity is the key. Gone are the days of mere badging exercises; consumers demand more than just a famous name on a label. They crave a genuine connection and seamless story from celeb to product.\n\nRyan Reynolds is a shining example. His brand of humour, wit, and relatability shines through in all his ventures. His Aviation Gin is a roaring success, and it's no surprise—Ryan's signature style permeates its content, captivating audiences and making them feel in on the joke.\n\nCherlato's arrival on the food scene, infused with her signature brand of camp and colour, alongside a brilliantly produced product, exemplifies the winning combination. We can’t wait to get our hands on a tub when it arrives on this side of the pond."
