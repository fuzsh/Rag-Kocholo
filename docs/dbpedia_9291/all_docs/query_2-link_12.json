        "text": "Truthfully? The first time I saw “The Cher Show,” I walked in with a splitting headache. On that Saturday in early December, the men in sailor suits who strolled out at the top of the show to back Cher up on “If I Could Turn Back Time” didn’t make much of an impression on me. Neither did her words as she informed them that they were free to go.\n\n“Thank you for your service, gentlemen!” said this version of Cher, imbued with potent charisma by Stephanie J. Block. “Ladies, front and center!”\n\nAs the male dancers exited into the wings of the Neil Simon Theater and a chorus of female dancers entered, the mission of the show had been spelled out. This blindingly sparkly jukebox-musical celebration of Cher’s life, which opened on Broadway this month, isn’t actually for the guys. It’s aimed at the women.\n\nMirrored walls and Bob Mackie costumes notwithstanding, “The Cher Show” — which has a book by Rick Elice (“Peter and the Starcatcher”) and stars three actresses playing Cher at different periods in her life, from her childhood in the 1950s to the present — is no winking ode to a camp icon. It’s something gentler and more compassionate, albeit with a wry sense of humor: the story of a female human being who became a superstar.\n\nGranted, that is also more or less the arc of the earnestly elegant “Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,” which has been running for five years at the Stephen Sondheim Theater, and the chilly, plastic “Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” whose much shorter residency at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater will end on Dec. 30. Phyllida Lloyd’s production of “Tina: The Tina Turner Musical,” which opened in London in the spring with a book by Katori Hall, is expected on Broadway next fall.\n\nLike them, “The Cher Show” (props to its creators for deviating from the title template) doesn’t mean to be highbrow entertainment; the constraints of the genre don’t allow it. As a pop-culture amusement, though, it’s analgesic fun. (My headache? Swiftly vanished.) And for all its comedy, it takes Cher — who is one of its producers — seriously.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
