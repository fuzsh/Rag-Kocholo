        "text": "Cher has claimed that her label Warner Records no longer cares about her.\n\nThe singer took to Twitter to respond to criticism of her latest single Take It Like A Man.\n\nAfter reading a review of the song and its accompanying remix music video, Cher tweeted: “Just read mean TILAM [‘Take It Like A Man’] review.\n\n“The video had nothing 2 do with me.I was told it would only be shown in gay bars.It’s true WB’s hasn’t got a Great Deal of Interest In My CD.\n\n“Not ALL,THERE R HARD WORKING ADORABLE PPL.,But Decision Makers Don’t Seem 2CareThat Much. It’s Ok YHSTLOM.”\n\nWe would like to add that Take It Like A Man and its accompanying remix video is amazing, and we will not hear otherwise (check it out below).\n\n> Cher and Cyndi Lauper going on tour together\n\n> David Guetta covers Cher for new single\n\n[youtube height=”HEIGHT” width=”WIDTH”]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=261df8mruZo[/youtube]"
