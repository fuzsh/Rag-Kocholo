        "text": "Definition of “Dyslexia”\n\nHistorical Perspective\n\nBefore the National Institutes of Health began their research in the 1980's, the only definition of dyslexia was an exclusionary one. If a child's difficulty with reading could not be explained by low intelligence, poor eyesight, poor hearing, inadequate educational opportunities, or any other problem, then the child must be dyslexic.\n\nThat definition was not satisfactory to parents, teachers, or researchers. So here are three different definitions in use today.\n\nSimple Definition\n\nDyslexia is an inherited condition that makes it extremely difficult to read, write, and spell in your native language—despite at least average intelligence.\n\nRevised Definition from the International Dyslexia Association\n\nDyslexia is a neurologically-based, often familial, disorder which interferes with the acquisition and processing of language. Varying in degrees of severity, it is manifested by difficulties in receptive and expressive language, including phonological processing, in reading, writing, spelling, handwriting, and sometimes in arithmetic.\n\nDyslexia is not the result of lack of motivation, sensory impairment, inadequate instructional or environmental opportunities, or other limiting conditions, but may occur together with these conditions.\n\nAlthough dyslexia is lifelong, individuals with dyslexia frequently respond successfully to timely and appropriate intervention.\n\nResearch Definition used by the National Institutes of Health\n\nDyslexia is a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin.\n\nIt is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition, and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.\n\nThese difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction.\n\nSecondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.\n\nDefinition of “Learning Disability”\n\n“Learning Disability” is not a specific term; it is a category containing many specific disabilities, all of which cause learning to be difficult. The following definition of “learning disability” is used for legislative, financial, and educational purposes only. It is not a definition of dyslexia, which is one specific learning disability.\n\nThe term “learning disability” means a disorder in one or more of the basic processes involved in understanding spoken or written language. It may show up as a problem in listening, thinking, speaking, reading, writing, or spelling or in a person's ability to do math, despite at least average intelligence.\n\nThe term does not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or physical handicaps, or mental retardation, or emotional disturbance, or of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.\n\nSymptoms\n\nSummary of warning signs\n\nDisclaimer: No two people with dyslexia are exactly alike because dyslexia ranges from mild to moderate to severe to profound. Some people with dyslexia also have ADD/ADHD.\n\nTherefore, someone with dyslexia may not have every single symptom listed below. But they will have many of them. Professional testers look for a “constellation” or cluster of symptoms in the following areas.\n\nIf someone struggles with spelling, is a slow reader who has a difficult time sounding out unknown words, and has difficulty getting their great thoughts down on paper in acceptable form, and that person has 3 or more of these classic warning signs, it is worth getting that person tested for dyslexia.\n\nThese problems are unexpected when compared to the person's proven abilities in other areas.\n\nNew – One-page summary sheet of the warning signs of dyslexia\n\nClick here for the sheet. One is also available on the warning signs of ADD/ADHD. We will mail it to you, free. Just click here, then type in your home or work mailing address.\n\nNew – Watch our “Dyslexia: Symptoms & Solutions” video, FREE\n\nJust click here to watch it now.\n\nPreschool and kindergarten warning signs\n\nIf three or more of these warning signs exist, especially if there is dyslexia or ADD/ADHD in the family tree, the child should be tested for dyslexia when the child becomes five years old. Also, phonemic awareness games and other reading readiness activities should be done daily during the preschool years.\n\nDelayed Speech: Not speaking any words by the child's first birthday. Often, they don't start talking until they are 2, 2½, 3, or even older.\n\nMixing up sounds in multi-syllabic words: For example, aminal for animal, bisghetti for spaghetti, hekalopter for helicopter, hangaberg for hamburger, mazageen for magazine, etc.\n\nEarly stuttering or cluttering.\n\nLots of ear infections.\n\nCan't master tying shoes.\n\nConfusion over left versus right, over versus under, before versus after, and other directionality words and concepts.\n\nLate to establish a dominant hand: May switch from right hand to left hand while coloring, writing, or doing any other task. Eventually, the child will usually establish a preferred hand, but it may not be until they are 7 or 8. Even then, they may use one hand for writing, but the other hand for sports.\n\nInability to correctly complete phonemic awareness tasks.\n\nDespite listening to stories that contain lots of rhyming words, such as Dr. Seuss, cannot tell you words that rhyme with cat or seat by the age of 4½.\n\nDifficulty learning the names of the letters or sounds in the alphabet; difficulty writing the alphabet in order.\n\nTrouble correctly articulating R's and L's as well as M's and N's. They often have “immature” speech. They may still be saying “wed and gween” instead of “red and green” in 2nd or 3rd grade.\n\nReading and spelling difficulties\n\nPeople with dyslexia do not make random reading errors. They make very specific types of errors. Their spelling reflects the same types of errors. Watch for these errors:\n\nReading\n\nCan read a word on one page, but won't recognize it on the next page.\n\nKnows phonics, but can't—or won't—sound out an unknown word.\n\nSlow, labored, inaccurate reading of single words in isolation (when there is no story line or pictures to provide clues).\n\nWhen they misread, they often say a word that has the same first and last letters, and the same shape, such as house-horse or beach-bench.\n\nThey may insert or leave out letters, such as could–cold or star–stair.\n\nThey may say a word that has the same letters, but in a different sequence, such as who–how, lots–lost, saw–was, or girl–grill.\n\nWhen reading aloud, reads in a slow, choppy cadence (not in smooth phrases), and often ignores punctuation.\n\nBecomes visibly tired after reading for only a short time.\n\nReading comprehension may be low due to spending so much energy trying to figure out the words. Listening comprehension is usually significantly higher than reading comprehension.\n\nDirectionality confusion shows up when reading and when writing.\n\nb–d confusion is a classic warning sign. One points to the left, the other points to the right, and they are left–right confused.\n\nb–p, n–u, or m–w confusion. One points up, the other points down. That's also directionality confusion.\n\nSubstitutes similar-looking words, even if it changes the meaning of the sentence, such as sunrise for surprise, house for horse, while for white, wanting for walking.\n\nWhen reading a story or a sentence, substitutes a word that means the same thing but doesn't look at all similar, such as trip for journey, fast for speed, or cry for weep.\n\nMisreads, omits, or even adds small function words, such as an, a, from, the, to, were, are, of.\n\nOmits or changes suffixes, saying need for needed, talks for talking, or late for lately.\n\nSpelling\n\nTheir spelling is far worse than their reading. They sometimes flunk inventive spelling. They have extreme difficulty with vowel sounds, and often leave them out.\n\nWith enormous effort, they may be able to “memorize” Monday's spelling list long enough to pass Friday's spelling test, but they can't spell those very same words two hours later when writing those words in sentences.\n\nContinually misspells high frequency sight words (nonphonetic but very common words) such as they, what, where, does and because—despite extensive practice.\n\nMisspells even when copying something from the board or from a book.\n\nWritten work shows signs of spelling uncertainty—numerous erasures, cross outs, etc.\n\nHandwriting issues (dysgraphia)\n\nAlso known as a visual-motor integration problem, people with dyslexia often have poor, nearly illegible handwriting. Signs of dysgraphia include:\n\nUnusual pencil grip, often with the thumb on top of the fingers (a “fist grip”).\n\nYoung children will often put their head down on the desk to watch the tip of the pencil as they write.\n\nThe pencil is gripped so tightly that the child's hand cramps. The child will frequently put the pencil down and shake out his/her hand.\n\nWriting is a slow, labored, non-automatic chore.\n\nChild writes letters with unusual starting and ending points.\n\nChild has great difficulty getting letters to “sit” on the horizontal lines.\n\nCopying off of the board is slow, painful, and tedious. Child looks up and visually “grabs” just one or two letters at a time, repeatedly subvocalizes the names of those letters, then stares intensely at their paper when writing those one or two letters. This process is repeated over and over. Child frequently loses his/her place when copying, misspells when copying, and doesn't always match capitalization or punctuation when copying—even though the child can read what was on the board.\n\nUnusual spatial organization of the page. Words may be widely spaced or tightly pushed together. Margins are often ignored.\n\nChild has an unusually difficult time learning cursive writing, and shows chronic confusion about similarly-formed cursive letters such as f and b, m and n, w and u. They will also have difficulty remembering how to form capital cursive letters.\n\nQuality of written work\n\nPeople with dyslexia usually have an “impoverished written product.” That means there is a huge difference between their ability to tell you something and their ability to write it down. They tend to:\n\nAvoid writing whenever possible.\n\nWrite everything as one very long sentence.\n\nNot understand that a sentence has to start with a capital letter and end with punctuation.\n\nBe confused about what is a complete sentence versus a fragment.\n\nMisspell many words—even though they often use only very simple one-syllable words that they are “sure” they know how to spell.\n\nTake an unusually long time to write, due to dysgraphia.\n\nHave nearly illegible handwriting, due to dysgraphia.\n\nUse space poorly on the page; odd spacing between words, may ignore margins, sentences tightly packed into one section of the page instead of being evenly spread out.\n\nDo not notice their errors when “proofreading.” They will read back what they wanted to say, not what is actually on the page.\n\nDirectionality issues\n\nMost dyslexic children and adults have significant directionality confusion.\n\nLeft–Right confusion:\n\nEven adults have to use whatever tricks their mother or teacher taught them to tell left from right. It never becomes rapid and automatic.\n\nA common saying in households with dyslexic people is, “It's on the left. The other left.”\n\nThat's why they are b–d confused. One points to the left and one points to the right.\n\nThey will often start math problems on the wrong side, or want to carry a number the wrong way.\n\nUp–Down confusion:\n\nSome children with dyslexia are also up-down confused. They confuse b–p or d–q, n–u, and m–w.\n\nConfusion about directionality words:\n\nFirst–last, before–after, next–previous, over–under\n\nYesterday–tomorrow (directionality in time)\n\nNorth, South, East, West confusion:\n\nAdults with dyslexia get lost a lot when driving around, even in cities where they've lived for many years\n\nOften have difficulty reading or understanding maps.\n\nSequencing steps in a task\n\nLearning any task that has a series of steps which must be completed in a specific order can be difficult. That's because you must memorize the sequence of steps, and often, there is no logic in the sequence.\n\nThese tasks are usually challenging for people with dyslexia:\n\nTying shoelaces: This task not only has a series of steps, but many steps have directionality as part of them. Many children do not master this task until they're teenagers.\n\nPrinting letters: The reason they form letters with such unusual beginning and ending points is that they can't remember the sequence of pencil strokes necessary to form that letter. So they start somewhere and then keep going until the letter looks approximately right.\n\nDoing long division: To successfully complete a long division problem, you must do a series of five steps, in exactly the right sequence, over and over again.\n\nThey will often know how to do every step in the sequence, but if they get the steps out of sequence, they'll end up with the wrong answer.\n\nTouch typing: Learning to touch type is an essential skill for people with dysgraphia. But it is usually more difficult (and requires much more effort) for a dyslexic child to learn to type since the keys on the keyboard are laid out in a random order (which requires rote memorization).\n\nRote memory of non-meaningful facts\n\nMemorizing non-meaningful facts (facts that are not personally interesting and personally relevant) is extremely difficult for most dyslexic children and adults. In school, this leads to difficulty learning:\n\nMultiplication tables.\n\nDays of the week or months of the year in order.\n\nScience facts: Water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit, the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second, etc.\n\nHistory facts: Dates, names, and places. Dyslexic students do well in history classes that emphasize why some event happened, and the consequences of that event, rather than rote memorization of dates and names.\n\nTelling time on a clock with hands\n\nPeople with dyslexia have extreme difficulty telling time on a clock with hands:\n\nWhen asked what time it is, they may say something ridiculous, such as, “It's ten past quarter to.”\n\nThey may be able to tell whole hours and half hours (5:00, 5:30, etc.) but not smaller chunks, such as 5:12.\n\nConcepts such as before and after on a clock are confusing. Therefore, time arithmetic is impossible.\n\nGetting them a digital clock only helps a little bit. Now they can tell what time it is at the moment, but if you tell them to be home in 15 minutes, they can't figure out when that would be.\n\nExtremely messy bedrooms\n\nPeople with dyslexia have an extremely difficult time organizing their belongings. They tend to pile things rather than to organize them and put them away. It is almost as though if they can't see the item (if it is behind a door or in a drawer), they will forget where it is.\n\nSo they have extremely messy bedrooms, lockers, desks, backpacks, purses, offices, and garages.\n\nMath difficulties\n\nPeople with dyslexia are often gifted in math. Their three-dimensional visualization skills help them “see” math concepts more quickly and clearly than non-dyslexic people. Unfortunately, difficulties in directionality, rote memorization, reading, and sequencing can make the following math tasks so difficult that their math gifts are never discovered.\n\nMemorizing addition and subtraction facts.\n\nMemorizing multiplication tables.\n\nRemembering the sequence of steps in long division.\n\nReading word problems.\n\nCopying an answer from one spot to a different spot.\n\nStarting a math problem on the wrong side.\n\nShowing their work: They often “see” math in their head, so showing their work is almost impossible.\n\nDoing math rapidly.\n\nThey often excel at higher levels of math, such as algebra, geometry, and calculus—if they have a teacher who works around the math problems caused by their dyslexia.\n\nOrganizational skills\n\nStudents with dyslexia and/or ADD/ADHD do not know how to organize school materials, backpacks, homework calendars, or notebooks. Those skills can and must be taught and modeled.\n\nCo-existing conditions\n\nAttention Deficit Disorder (with or without Hyperactivity)\n\nAttention Deficit Disorder is a completely separate condition than dyslexia. However, research has shown that at least 40% of people with dyslexia also have ADD/ADHD.\n\nTo read more, click here.\n\nLight Sensitivity (Scotopic Sensitivity)\n\nA small percentage (3% to 8%) of people with dyslexia also have light sensitivity (sometimes called scotopic sensitivity). These people have a hard time seeing small black print on white paper. The print seems to shimmer or move; some see the rivers of white more strongly than the black words. These people tend to dislike fluorescent lighting, and often “shade” the page with their hand or head when they read.\n\nColored plastic overlays and/or colored lenses can eliminate the harsh black print against white paper contrast, and may make letters stand still for the first time in someone's life. However, the plastic overlays or colored lenses will not “cure” dyslexia, nor will they teach a dyslexic person how to read.\n\nPhonemic Awareness\n\nWhat is Phonemic Awareness?\n\nNIH research has repeatedly demonstrated that lack of phonemic awareness is the root cause of reading failure. Phonemes are the smallest unit of spoken language, not written language.\n\nChildren who lack phonemic awareness are unable to distinguish or manipulate sounds within spoken words or syllables. They would be unable to do the following tasks:\n\nPhoneme Segmentation: What sounds do you hear in the word hot? What's the last sound in the word map?\n\nPhoneme Deletion: What word would be left if the /k/ sound were taken away from cat?\n\nPhoneme Matching: Do pen and pipe start with the same sound?\n\nPhoneme Counting: How many sounds do you hear in the word cake?\n\nPhoneme Substitution: What word would you have if you changed the /h/ in hot to /p/?\n\nBlending: What word would you have if you put these sounds together? /s/ /a/ /t/\n\nRhyming: Tell me as many words as you can that rhyme with the word eat.\n\nIf a child lacks phonemic awareness, they will have difficulty learning the relationship between letters and the sounds they represent in words, as well as applying those letter/sound correspondences to help them “sound out” unknown words.\n\nSo children who perform poorly on phonemic awareness tasks via oral language in kindergarten are very likely to experience difficulties acquiring the early word reading skills that provide the foundation for growth of reading ability throughout elementary school.\n\nPhonemic awareness skills can and must be directly and explicitly taught to children who lack this awareness.\n\nImportance of Phonemic Awareness\n\nQuotes from prominent NIH researchers:\n\n“The lack of phonemic awareness is the most powerful determinant of the likelihood of failure to learn to read.”\n\n“Phonemic awareness is more highly related to learning to read…than tests of general intelligence, reading readiness, and listening comprehension.”\n\n“Phonemic awareness is the most important core and causal factor separating normal and disabled readers.”\n\nPhonological Processing and Phonics\n\nPhonemic awareness must exist or be explicitly and directly taught before phonics instruction begins. Otherwise, the phonics instruction will not make sense to the dyslexic child.\n\nPhonological processing refers to understanding of sounds used in our language, ranging from big chunks of sound (words), to smaller chunks (syllables) and eventually to phonemic awareness (every sound within a syllable). Both phonemic awareness and phonological processing are auditory processing skills. Therefore, they can (and should) be taught before letters are introduced.\n\nThe goal of teaching phonics is to link the individual sounds to letters, and to make that process fluent and automatic, for both reading and spelling. In other words, phonics teaches students symbol-to-sound and sound-to-symbol.\n\nBut for phonics to work, a student must first have solid phonological processing and phonemic awareness.\n\nTo see how these different items are taught, take a look at our How to Get Help page.\n\nCauses of Dyslexia\n\nDyslexia is an inherited condition. Researchers have determined that a gene on the short arm of chromosome #6 is responsible for dyslexia. That gene is dominant, making dyslexia highly heritable. It definitely runs in families.\n\nNeurological Differences\n\nDyslexia results from a neurological difference; that is, a brain difference. People with dyslexia have a larger right hemisphere in their brains than those of normal readers. That may be one reason people with dyslexia often have significant strengths in areas controlled by the right side of the brain, such as:\n\nartistic, athletic, and mechanical gifts\n\n3-D visualization ability\n\nmusical talent\n\ncreative problem solving skills\n\nand intuitive people skills\n\nIn addition to unique brain architecture, people with dyslexia have unusual “wiring.” Neurons are found in unusual places in the brain, and they are not as neatly ordered as in non-dyslexic brains.\n\nIn addition to unique brain architecture and unusual wiring, f/MRI studies have shown that people with dyslexia do not use the same part of their brain when reading as other people. Regular readers consistently use the same part of their brain when they read. People with dyslexia do not use that part of their brain, and there appears to be no consistent part used among dyslexic readers.\n\nIt is therefore assumed that people with dyslexia are not using the most efficient part of their brain when they read. A different part of their brain has taken over that function.\n\nGenes\n\nDissecting Dyslexia\n\nExcerpt from “Dissecting Dyslexia”\n\nReading Rockets.org\n\nChildren who cannot read fluently or spell accurately are often thought to lack intelligence or motivation. But in most cases, they are neither stupid nor lazy. They have dyslexia, which makes it difficult for them to understand written language despite having a normal—or higher than normal—IQ.\n\nRecent studies suggest that their reading difficulties are caused by identifiable genetic variations that create “faulty wiring” in certain areas of the brain.\n\nLuckily, most of our brain development occurs after we are born, when we interact with our environment. This means that the right teaching techniques can actually re-train the brain, especially when used early.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nFrom Genes to Behavior\n\nExcerpt from “From Genes to Behavior in Developmental Dyslexia”\n\nAlbert M. Galaburda et al\n\nNature Neuroscience, October 2006\n\nThis scholarly research article expands on the following:\n\nAll four genes thus far linked to dyslexia impact brain development. Comparable abnormalities induced in young rodent brains cause auditory deficits, underscoring the potential relevance of these brain changes to dyslexia.\n\nOur perspective on dyslexia is that some of the brain changes cause phonological processing abnormalities as well as auditory processing abnormalities.\n\nThus, we propose a pathway between a genetic effect, developmental brain changes, and perceptual deficits associated with dyslexia.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nScientists Tie Two Additional Genes to Dyslexia\n\nExcerpt from “Scientists tie two additional genes to dyslexia”\n\nSandra Blakeslee\n\nNew York Times, November 2, 2005\n\nOne year after scientists discovered a gene whose flaw contributes to dyslexia, two more such genes have been identified.\n\nThe findings, described yesterday in Salt Lake City at a meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics, support the idea that many people deemed simply lazy or stupid, because of their severe reading problems, may instead have a genetic disorder that interfered with the wiring of their brains before birth.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nDyslexia Susceptibility Gene\n\nExcerpt from “Association of the KIAA0319 Dyslexia Susceptibility Gene With Reading Skills in the General Population”\n\nSilvia Paracchini, D.Phil., et al\n\nAmerican Journal of Psychiatry, December 2008\n\nDyslexia (reading disability) is a complex trait determined in large part by genetic factors. Association studies and translocation breakpoint analyses have proposed several genes as susceptibility candidates at some of the quantitative trait loci linked to dyslexia: DYX1C1 on chromosome 15, KIAA0319 and DCDC2 on chromosome 6, ROBO1 on chromosome 3, and MRPL19 and C20RF3 on chromosome 2.\n\nThe results of this study both support the role of KIAA0319 in the development of dyslexia and and suggest that this gene influence reading ability in the general population. Moreover, the data implicate the three-SNP haplotype and its tagging SNP rs2143340 as genetic risk factors for poor reading performance.\n\nThis research article is extremely technical but is a “must read” for those who want to understand the latest in genetic research.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nDyslexia Gene Controls Cilia in Brain Neurons\n\nScientists at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have discovered that a gene linked to dyslexia has a surprising biological function: it controls cilia, the antenna-like projections that cells use to communicate.\n\nDyslelxia is largely hereditary and linked to a number of genes. One of these genes, DCDC2, is involved in regulating the signaling of cilia in brain neurons.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nMusical Ability Connected to Dyslexia Gene\n\nExcerpt from “Genome wide linkage scan for loci of musical aptitude in Finnish families:Evidence for a major locus at 4q22”\n\nKristiina Pulli, et al\n\nJournal of Medical Genetics, April 18, 2008\n\nA team of Finnish and American geneticists have found that, for some people at least, music is in their genes. In what the researchers called the first study of its kind, they found specific regions of chromosomes that were connected to musical ability.\n\nThe chromosomal regions that were found to be connected to music are known to be involved in the migration of neurons during development. And the study also found that the musical DNA overlapped with a region associated with dyslexia.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nSame Gene in Chinese Dyslexics\n\nDyslexia exists in every country, even countries in which the written language is not phonetic.\n\nGenetic studies in western populations have suggested that DYX1C1 is a candidate gene for dyslexia.\n\nThis study of 393 Chinese children determined that the very same gene is responsible for dyslexia in Chinese children. And those children have difficulty with rapid naming, phonological memory, and orthographic skills – just as dyslexic children in western countries do.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nRecent Research\n\nNIH Research Project\n\nIn the early 1980's, the United States Congress mandated the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research learning disabilities and answer 7 specific questions.\n\nAfter conducting longitudinal research plus numerous studies on genetics, interventions, and brain function, we now have a great deal of independent, scientific, replicated, published research on dyslexia.\n\nThis section shares the research results released by the National Institutes of Health from 1994 to the present, as well as from dyslexia researchers in several others countries.\n\nNIH Research Questions\n\nNIH coordinated 18 top-notch university research teams throughout the United States to answer the following questions posed by Congress:\n\nHow many children are learning disabled?\n\nClearly define each specific type of learning disability.\n\nWhat causes each learning disability?\n\nHow can we identify each learning disability?\n\nHow long does each disability last? Map its developmental course.\n\nWhat is the best way to teach these children?\n\nCan we prevent any of these learning disabilities?\n\nNIH investigated dyslexia first because it is the most prevalent learning disability.\n\nNIH Results Released in 1994\n\nThese research results have been independently replicated and are now considered to be irrefutable.\n\nDyslexia affects at least 1 out of every 5 children in the United States.\n\nDyslexia represents the most common and prevalent of all known learning disabilities.\n\nDyslexia is the most researched of all learning disabilities.\n\nDyslexia affects as many boys as girls.\n\nSome forms of dyslexia are highly heritable.\n\nDyslexia is the leading cause of reading failure and school dropouts in our nation.\n\nReading failure is the most commonly shared characteristic of juvenile justice offenders.\n\nDyslexia has been shown to be clearly related to neurophysiological differences in brain function. Dyslexic children display difficulty with the sound/symbol correspondences of our written code because of these differences in brain function.\n\nEarly intervention is essential for this population.\n\nDyslexia is identifiable, with 92% accuracy, at ages 5½ to 6½.\n\nDyslexia is primarily due to linguistic deficits. We now know dyslexia is due to a difficulty processing language. It is not due to visual problems, and people with dyslexia do not see words or letters backwards.\n\nReading failure caused by dyslexia is highly preventable through direct, explicit instruction in phonemic awareness.\n\nChildren do not outgrow reading failure or dyslexia.\n\nOf children who display reading problems in the first grade, 74% will be poor readers in the ninth grade and into adulthood unless they receive informed and explicit instruction on phonemic awareness. Children do not mature out of their reading difficulties.\n\nResearch evidence does not support the use of “whole language” reading approaches to teach dyslexic children.\n\nDyslexia and ADD/ADHD are two separate and identifiable entities.\n\nDyslexia and ADD/ADHD so frequently coexist within the same child that it is always best to test for both.\n\nChildren with both dyslexia and ADD/ADHD are at dramatically increased risk for substance abuse and felony convictions if they do not receive appropriate interventions.\n\nThe current “discrepancy model” testing utilized by our nation's public schools to establish eligibility for special education services is not a valid diagnostic marker for dyslexia.\n\nResearch Results Released After 1994\n\nWord recognition difficulties are the most reliable indicators of reading disability in older children and adults. Slow, labored, and inaccurate reading of real and nonsense words in isolation are key warning signs.\n\nThis laborious reading of single words frequently impedes the individual's ability to comprehend what has been read, even though listening comprehension is adequate.\n\nEven among children and adults who score within normal ranges on reading achievement tests, many report that reading is so laborious and unproductive that they rarely read either for learning or for pleasure.\n\nDeveloping adequate awareness of phonemes is not dependent on intelligence, socio-economic status, or parents' education, but can be fostered through direct, explicit instruction. Such instruction is shown to accelerate reading acquisition in general, even as it reduces the incidence of reading failure.\n\nDisabled readers must be provided highly structured programs that explicitly teach application of phonologic rules to print. Longitudinal data (studies that follow children over time) indicate that explicit systematic phonics instruction results in more favorable outcomes for disabled readers than does a context-emphasis (whole-language) approach.\n\nLongitudinal Research\n\nThe National Institutes of Health conducted a longitudinal study by tracking 5,000 children at random from all over the country starting when they were 4 years old until they graduated from high school. The researchers had no idea which children would develop reading difficulties and which ones would not.\n\nThere were many theories at that time as to what caused reading difficulties, and which tests best predicted reading failure. The researchers tested these children 3 times a year for 14 years using a variety of tests that would either support or disprove the competing theories. But the researchers did NOT provide any type of training or intervention. They simply watched and tested.\n\nFrom that research, they were able to determine which tests are most predictive of reading failure, at what age we can test children, and whether children outgrow their reading difficulties. This study also spawned numerous other NIH research projects. The results of these studies were released in 1994.\n\nSpeech Delays Related to Later Reading Difficulty\n\nSpeech Delays Turn Into Reading Problems\n\nExcerpt from: “The Relationship Between Language and Learning Disabilities”\n\nFrank R. Brown III, et al\n\nLDOline.org\n\nIn 1980, Snyder predicted that the language-delayed preschooler of today may well become the learning-disabled child of tomorrow. A growing body of evidence supports her prediction and suggests that many of these children do not “outgrow” these problems, and that “simple” delays in communication may, in fact, be stable predictors of later learning disabilities.\n\nOne set of researchers followed a group of children from ages 2 to 6. The children were identified at age 2 as “late talkers”. Although the majority outgrew their oral language delay by age 4, they demonstrated academic delays at ages 5 and 6.\n\nAnother set of researchers found that the oral language disorders decreased over time, giving the impression of “recovery” by age 5. However, the majority of those children experienced reading disabilities by grade 2.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nDetecting Dyslexia In Preschoolers\n\nExcerpt from: “Pre-school Age Exercises Can Prevent Dyslexia, New Research Shows”\n\nScience Daily, August 22, 2008\n\nAtypical characteristics of children's linguistic development are early signs of the risk of dyslexia, and new research points to preventive exercises as an effective means to tackle the challenges children face when learning to read.\n\nThe results achieved at the Centre of Excellence in Learning and Motivation Research were presented at Finland's Academy of Science breakfast on 21 August.\n\nHeaded by Professor Lyytinen at the University of Jyvaskyla, the study compared 107 children with a dyslexic parent to a control group of children without a hereditary predisposition to dyslexia. The researchers followed the children from birth through school age.\n\n“Half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group. The atypical characteristics of these children's linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early age,” says Lyytinen.\n\nAccording to Lyytinen, the predictors of reading and writing difficulties are evident primarily in two contexts: a delayed ability to perceive and mentally process the subtleties of a person's voice, and a sluggishness in naming familiar, visually presented objects.\n\nTo read the entire study, click here.\n\nSpelling Difficulties\n\nSpelling & Dyslexia\n\nSignificant difficulty with spelling, when writing sentences and stories, is the most obvious warning sign of dyslexia. That's why spelling is mentioned in the research-based definition of dyslexia used by the International Dyslexia Association and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), which is:\n\nDyslexia is characterized by difficulties with accurate and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction.\n\nSecondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.\n\nReading Problems Show Up In Spelling\n\nPoor spelling when writing essays and stories is a huge red flag of dyslexia.\n\nAs part of Reading Rocketâs Meet The Experts series, Dr. Louisa Moats shares how reading problems show up first in spelling. She then explains the importance of reading and spelling nonsense words.\n\nTo watch that short video, click here.\n\nSpelling Fact Sheet\n\nThe International Dyslexia Association has recently released a 4-page fact sheet on Spelling (“Just the Facts…Spelling”), which states that people with dyslexia have “conspicuous problems” with spelling and writing. The fact sheet quotes the research and explains how spelling needs to be taught.\n\nTo download that Spelling Fact Sheet, click here. Produced by the International Dyslexia Association, posted on their website in 2008 www.InterDys.org.\n\nSpelling Gene\n\nExcerpt from: “Spelling bee: Bad at spelling? Could be your genes”\n\nKate Wighton\n\nwww.TimesOnline.co.uk, October 25, 2008\n\nIn the past, poor spelling was attributed to all manner of things, from bad schooling to a lack of moral fiber. But science is offering a new explanation. A difficulty with spelling could be rooted in your genes and in the way your brain is wired. These findings stem from research into the language disorder dyslexia, but they are proving important for the wider population.\n\nTony Monaco, a scientist at the Wellcome Centre Trust for Human Genetics, Oxford University, believes that our ability to spell lies partly in our DNA. In his study, his lab tracked the development of 6,000 children born in the early Nineties. Previous studies highlighted a particular gene that might affect reading ability, KIAA0319. We all carry it, but he found that 15 percent of the population have a slightly different version than normal.\n\nAccording to Professor Monaco, the normal version of the gene helps to guide brain cells into the cortex when a child is developing in the womb. When the gene is different, however, it is unable to properly fulfill its function; brain cells get lost on the journey and end up in the wrong place. “This may disrupt the processing of information,” he says.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nSpelling Changes the Brain\n\nExcerpt from: “Brain Images Show Individual Dyslexic Children Respond To Spelling Treatment”\n\nMedicalNewsToday.com, February 15, 2006\n\nBrain images of children with dyslexia taken before they received spelling instruction show that they have different patterns of neural activity than do good spellers when doing language tasks related to spelling. But after specialized treatment emphasizing the letters in words, they showed similar patterns of brain activity.\n\nThese findings are important because they show the human brain can change and normalize in response to spelling instruction, even in dyslexia, the most common learning disability.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nBrain Research\n\nReading and the Brain\n\nThis 30-minute video, hosted by Henry Winkler, who has his own struggles with reading, explores how brain scientists are working to solve the puzzle of why some children struggle to read and others don't. Startling new research shows the answer may lie in how a child's brain is wired from birth.\n\nThis program is the newest episode on Launching Young Readers, WETA's award-winning series of innovative half-hour programs about how children learn to read, why so many struggle, and what we can do to help.\n\nTo watch “Reading and the Brain” FREE, click here.\n\nDyslexia Begins When Wires Don't Meet\n\nExcerpt from: “Dyslexia begins when the wires don't meet”\n\nMark Roth\n\nPittsburgh Post-Gazette, February 11, 2007\n\nDr. Just, a brain researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, and his colleagues, as well as brain imaging carried out at Georgetown University, Yale University and other centers, has proven that seeing letters in reverse or out of order is NOT the cause of dyslexia.\n\nUsing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures blood flow to different parts of the brain, researchers now know that dyslexia involves a weakness in the part of the brain that decodes the sounds of written language.\n\nThat region sits above the left ear, at the junction of the brain's temporal and parietal lobes.\n\nResearchers have also shown that the right kind of intensive instruction can rewire the brain and help overcome reading deficits. When Carnegie Mellon scanned the brains of youngsters who received a year of concentrated reading instruction, they showed 40 percent more activity in the word decoding areas of their brains, Dr. Just said.\n\nA similar study at Yale showed that a year after receiving such instruction, boys and girls continued to show increased activity in both the word-decoding and word-forming areas of their brains.\n\nA study at Georgetown University showed that intensive intervention also helps adults with dyslexia.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nSlow Reading in Dyslexia Tied to Disorganized Brain Tracks\n\nExcerpt from: “Slow Reading In Dyslexia Tied To Disorganized Brain Tracts”\n\nScience Daily, December 4, 2007\n\nDyslexia marked by poor reading fluency—slow and choppy reading—may be caused by disorganized, meandering tracts of nerve fibers in the brain, according to researchers at Children's Hospital Boston and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.\n\nThe study, using the latest imaging methods, gives researchers a glimpse of what may go wrong in the structure of some dyslexic readers' brains, making it difficult to integrate the information needed for rapid, “automatic” reading.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nOvercoming Dyslexia: Timing of “Connections” in Brain is Key\n\nExcerpt from: “Overcoming Dyslexia: Timing of ‘Connections’ in Brain is Key”\n\nScience Daily, September 5, 2007\n\nUsing new software developed to investigate how the brains of dyslexic children are organized, University of Washington researchers have found that key areas for language and working memory involved in reading are connected differently in dyslexics than in children who are good readers and spellers.\n\nHowever, once the children with dyslexia received an intense and specialized instructional program, their patterns of functional brain connectivity normalized and were similar to those of good readers when deciding if sounds went with groups of letters in words.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nDyslexic Children Use Nearly Five Times the Brain Area\n\nExcerpt from: “Dyslexic children use nearly five times the brain area”\n\nUniversity of Washington press release\n\nUWNews.org, October 4, 1999\n\nDyslexic children use nearly five times the brain area as normal children while performing a simple language task, according to a new study by an interdisciplinary team of University of Washington researchers. The study shows, for the first time, that there are chemical differences in the brain function of dyslexic and non-dyslexic children.\n\nThe research, published in the current issue of the American Journal of Neuroradiology, also provides new evidence that dyslexia is a brain-based disorder.\n\nThis study, part of a wider UW effort to understand the basis of dyslexia and develop treatments for it, was funded by the National Institutes of Children Health and Human Development, a branch of the National Institutes of Health.\n\nTo read the entire press release, click here.\n\nNIH-Funded Study Finds Dyslexia is Not Tied to IQ\n\nRegardless of high or low overall scores on an IQ test, children with dyslexia show similar patterns of brain activity, according to researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe results call into question the discrepancy model – the current practice of classifying a child as dyslexic on the basis of a lag between reading ability and IQ score.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nRemediation Rewires Dyslexic Brains, Provides Lasting Results\n\nExcerpt from: “Remedial Instruction Rewires Dyslexic Brains, Provides Lasting Results, Study Shows”\n\nCarnegie Mellon University\n\nScienceDaily, August 7, 2008\n\nA new Carnegie Mellon University brain imaging study of dyslexic students shows that the brain can permanently rewire itself and overcome reading deficits, if students are given 100 hours of intensive remedial instruction.\n\nThe study, published in the August issue of the journal Neuropsychologia, shows that the remedial instruction resulted in an increase in brain activity in several cortical regions associated with reading, and that gains became further solidified during the year following instruction.\n\n“This study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement,” said neuroscientist Marcel Just, director of Carnegie Mellon's Center for Cognitive Brain Imaging (CCBI) and senior author of the study. “Focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their brain proficiency.”\n\nTo read the entire article describing this study, click here.\n\nNeural Systems Predict Long-Term Outcome\n\nPeople with dyslexia vary in their ability to improve reading skills, but the brain basis for improvement remains largely unknown.\n\nThese researchers performed a prospective, longitudinal study over 2.5 years on 25 children with and without dyslexia to discover whether initial behavioral or brain measures, including fMRI and DTI, could predict future long-term reading gains in dyslexia.\n\nThis study showed that greater right prefrontal activation during a reading task that demanded phonological awareness, and right superior longitudinal fasciculus white-matter organization, significantly predicted future reading gains.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nScanning for Early Signs of Reading Woes\n\nThe average dyslexic child is not diagnosed – and so does not begin to receive intensive reading help – until she is in 2nd or 3rd grade. But intervening in kindergarten, or earlier, is known to be effective.\n\nStudies in preschoolers have shown that glitches in certain prereading skills, such as rhyming or rapid object naming, are associated with later dyslexia. Nadine Gaab, a researcher at Childrenâs Hospital in Boston, hopes to pin down markers in younger children, perhaps even infants.\n\nUsing brain scans, Gaab and her colleagues have found less gray matter in brain areas involved in mapping sounds in preschoolers, and neural deficits that prevent them from properly processing fast-changing sounds.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nLatest Brain Research\n\nDr. Sally Shaywitz\n\nOvercoming Dyslexia by Sally Shaywitz\n\nFinally.

That telltale signature of dyslexia now can be detected reliably in brain scans of children as young as 7, researchers say.\n\nThe scans showed that people with dyslexia have a much lower level of activity in areas at the back of the brain thought to be responsible for quickly matching words, sounds and meaning, compared to normal readers.\n\n“We know now that this disruption is not due simply to a lifetime of poor reading because we see it in children as young as age 7,” said Dr. Sally Shaywitz, director of the Yale University Center for Learning and Attention and co-author of the study published this month in the research journal Biological Psychiatry.\n\nTo read the National Institutes of Health's press release on this study, see NIH News Release: Children's Reading Disability Attributed to Brain Impairment.\n\nFor additional background on brain research and reading, see the Q&A with Dr. Gordon Sherman by SchwabLearning.org.\n\nDyslexia & Standardized Tests\n\nExcerpt from: “55% of students who fail SATs have dyslexia or a learning disability”\n\nUniversity of Hull\n\nXtraordinary People publication, March 17, 2008\n\nA new report released by Xtraordinary People on March 17, 2008, as part of their “No To Failure” project, has revealed the full extent of the hidden problem of dyslexia in classrooms around the country.\n\nHere is a summary of their results:\n\nIn the screening phase of the study, a total of 1,341 pupils were screened in Year 3 and Year 7 in 20 schools across three different local authorities in England. This sample is reasonably representative of schools nationally, although slightly biased towards the lower end of the socio-economic spectrum.\n\nOverall, 55% of all pupils who failed to reach expected targets on the national Standard Assessment Tests (SATs) were found to be “at risk” for dyslexia, indicating that unidentified dyslexia is a major cause of educational failure that could be remedied, but which at present, is largely ignored.\n\nXtraordinary People, a dyslexia charity supported by Sir Richard Branson, who is also dyslexic, is calling for the government to implement mandatory dyslexia awareness training for all teachers and to commit to providing dyslexia specialist training for one teacher in every school.\n\nTheir No To Failure project is an empirical study to:\n\ndemonstrate the educational importance and efficacy of screening for dyslexia\n\nunderstand how dyslexia, if ignored, can lead to educational failure and\n\nevaluate the impact of specialist teaching on the literacy skills and educational development of pupils found to be at risk of dyslexia\n\n“The link between dyslexia and academic failure has been made shockingly clear in our report. This level of failure is unacceptable and unnecessary because with a correct ‘diagnosis’ and support from trained specialists, dyslexic children can flourish. There is simply no need for these children to be slipping through the academic net,” said Kate Griggs, founder of Xtraordinary People.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nAuditory Processing\n\nDyslexia Makes Voices Hard to Discern\n\nBecause people with dyslexia are known to struggle with phonemes when reading, a US-based team of scientists at MIT wondered if they would also struggle hearing them in peopleâs voices.\n\nTo investigate, the team grouped 30 people of similar age, education and IQ into two camps: those with and without dyslexia.\n\nThe subjects went through a training period to learn to associate 10 different voices – half speaking English and half speaking Chinese – with 10 computer-generated avatars.\n\nNon-dyslexics outperformed people with dyslexia by 40% when listening to English. However, that advantage disappeared when the groups were listening to Chinese – because neither group had learned to hear Chinese phonemes.\n\n“Our results are the first to explicitly link impairment in reading ability to impairment in ecologically processing spoken language,” said researcher Tyler Perrachione.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nAbnormality in Auditory Processing Underlies Dyslexia\n\nPeople with dyslexia often struggle with the ability to accurately decode and identify what they read. Although disrupted processing of speech sounds has been implicated in the underlying pathology of dyslexia, the basis for that disruption and how it interferes with reading has not been fully explained.\n\nNow, new research published by Cell Press in the December 22, 2011 issue of the journal Neuron finds that a specific abnormality in the processing of auditory signals accounts for the main symptoms of dyslexia.\n\nThis new study shows that their left auditory cortex may be less responsive to modulations at specific frequencies that are optimal for analysis of speech sounds.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nBrain Changes Occur Early\n\nNew imaging research shows that the reduced brain activity associated with the onset of dyslexia develops before, not after, a child starts to read.\n\nKey parts of the brainâs rear left hemisphere critical to language processing do not undergo activity changes, the study suggests, which may be part of the cause.\n\nGuinevere Eden, director of the Center for the Study of Learning, a professor of pediatrics at Georgetown University, and past president of the International Dyslexia Association shared, “This means they have found a physiological signature for a child who is likely at risk for dyslexia, which will be of great help in doing what everyone really wants to do: identify and treat children with dyslexia as early as possible.”\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nStrengths of Dyslexics\n\nCommon Strengths\n\nAlthough their unique brain architecture and “unusual wiring” make reading, writing, and spelling difficult, most people with dyslexia have gifts in areas controlled by the right hemisphere of the brain. The right side controls:\n\nartistic skill\n\nathletic ability\n\nmusical ability\n\nmechanical ability\n\npeople skills\n\n3-D visual-spatial skills\n\nvivid imagination\n\nintuition\n\ncreative, global thinking\n\ncuriosity\n\nGood Careers for Dyslexics\n\nYou'll find people with dyslexia in every field.

Dyslexics lose their desire to read, or they never gain a desire, or they can't seem to maintain a desire to continue along the written page.\n\nDyslexia is more than erroneous spelling.\n\nDyslexia is an issue of desire. My mind does not desire the written word. No matter the scolding, the guilt, the prodding or the pushing, my mind does not enjoy reading.\n\nReading is a race I've never enjoyed running. While others sprinted ahead, I lumbered forward, pausing between words and sentences as if they were high hurdles or steeple chase walls.\n\nAs I grew older, I began to tell people the story about how I used to be dyslexic, about how I grew out of my disability. It sounded right to me and it made me feel special, even though it was not true. Dyslexia does not go away. It does not disappear.\n\nI host a daily radio show and a few months back decided it would be nice to do a show on dyslexia, and share how I learned to read and “grow out” of dyslexia. I found a professor from Yale (Sally Shaywitz) who began to describe my life. But she didn't use my name. She used the word dyslexic.\n\nIn the middle of our interview, I proudly blurted out, “I'm dyslexic!” I said those words as if I'd won a prize or at least found a place to stand without shame.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nSteven Cannell, Emmy-winning writer and producer\n\nSteven Cannell overcame severe dyslexia to become one of television's most prolific writers. He has created more than 40 shows, of which he has scripted more than 450 episodes. His hits include The Rockford Files, Greatest American Hero, The A-Team, Hunter, Riptide, Hardcastle & McCormick, 21 Jump Street, Wiseguy, The Commish, Profit, and the hit syndicated shows, Renegade and Silk Stalkings.\n\nHe shares:\n\nI was 35 years old when I found out that I was dyslexic. My daughter, who is now 30, was being thrown out of the sixth grade at her private school. I met with the head of the school and he said: “She may not be up to what we're trying to accomplish.\" What he was really saying was that she didn't have the intelligence.\n\nI got really mad because I knew from talking to my daughter that she was smart, just as my father had known that I was smart when I was failing in school. We had her tested and all of the things that were going on with her were the same things that had been going on with me. I decided to get tested as well. The results showed she is dyslexic, and so am I.\n\nBy the time I got to college I had come to realize that I couldn't spell, no matter how hard I tried. So at the University of Oregon, I would sign up for extra courses. I'd be in registration lines all day. Then I would go around the first day of class and ask each professor: “What's your policy on misspelling?”\n\nIf the professor said: “This is history. Let your English department worry about spelling,” I'd keep the course. If he said, “Three misspellings is a flunk,” I'd drop it.\n\nSteven Cannell is an avid spokesperson on dyslexia. In an inspiring video series, he explains what dyslexia is, recalls his experiences, and provides advice.

There was a 10-year period where I had to memorize pages of dialogue and invest so much of my time and energy into every audition, going in knowing I wouldn't get it anyway,” Patrick Dempsey says with a trace of bitterness.\n\nGrey's creator, Shonda Rhimes, admits Dempsey's dyslexia threw her at first, particularly at the first few “table readings”—meetings when the cast gathers to read fresh scripts aloud. “I did not know about Patrick's dyslexia in the beginning,\" she says. “I actually thought that he didn't like the scripts from the way he approached the readings.”\n\n“When I found out, I completely understood his hesitation. Now that we all know, if he is struggling with a word, the other actors are quick to step up and help him out. Everyone is very respectful.”\n\nTo read the entire interview, click here.\n\nSarah Entine, filmmaker\n\nFrom the ReadMeDifferently.com website:\n\nSara Entine, a talented independent filmmaker, has created a film that tells the story of her family, whose complicated relationships stem from misunderstandings due to unidentified dyslexia and AD/HD. It is the story of a mother, daughter, and granddaughter who long to feel seen, accepted, and loved for who they are.\n\nTo watch a 10-minute trailer, free, on her website, click here.\n\nLuke Ford, actor\n\nExcerpt from: “Dyslexic youth discovers talent as an actor”\n\nJamie Portman\n\nCanada.com\n\nWhen Luke Ford was diagnosed with dyslexia as a child in Australia, the last thing he expected was that it would launch him into an acting career and pave the way for a major role in a big Hollywood film like The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.\n\nHe was told one of the best ways of dealing with dyslexia was to make his brain work in new areas.\n\n“So I went and tried to be a musician, but that didn't work,” he grins. Then he tried to be a painter and discovered he was pretty untalented in that area as well. “So then I thought, ‘All right, I'll do this drama class.’ They told me I was really good, and I got an A—but the next thing they did was to drop drama from my high school.”\n\nFord's response to that was to quit school and try to become a professional actor.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nMusicians\n\nTony Bennett, singer\n\nExcerpt from: “Tony Bennett says he's ‘never felt better’”\n\nCassandra Szklarski\n\njam.canoe.ca\n\nBennett says coping with dyslexia, a learning disability that causes difficulty in reading and writing, has been an ongoing struggle throughout his impressive career.\n\n“I've always had a bit of dyslexia, so it's very hard for me to read proficiently,” says Bennett, known for a rich, natural vocal style that appears effortless.\n\n“It's very difficult. My eyes bounce, so it's difficult for me to follow musically that way. I have to do it instinctively and intuitively.”\n\nTo read his story, click here.\n\nJohn Lennon, lead singer, Beatles\n\nExcerpt from: “John Lennon: Imagine Dyslexia”\n\nRafael Scarnati\n\nLearningFoundations.wordpress.com, December 13, 2010\n\nGrowing up, few people expected John Lennon to be any more successful than a pot scrubber or factory worker in Liverpool. Like many dyslexic children going to school, he was extremely bright yet grossly underestimated.\n\nHe couldn't spell, even though he loved to read and write stories. He couldn't memorize the lyrics to other people's songs, but wrote amazingly creative lyrics himself. Except for his art classes, he got terrible grades.\n\nHe was deemed a troublemaker, yet even when he dropped out of high school, his strong people skills and creativity moved his headmaster to make a special recommendation to get him into college.\n\nHe was an artist, a storyteller and a poet from a very early age. He was a leader among his peers. His ideas were always ahead of his time.\n\nHis is also a story that reveals both the challenges, and the gifts, of dyslexia.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nTom Mulcahy, jazz musician\n\nExcerpt from: “Seamless move to jazz music”\n\nMichelle McDonagh\n\nIrishTimes.com\n\nTom Mulcahy finds it difficult to put into words the impact that being diagnosed with dyslexia had on him after a lifetime of failing exams and feeling inadequate.\n\nIt was not until ten years ago, while he was in college pursing a degree in jazz performance, that he was finally diagnosed with dyslexia. After the nightmare of his school days, the diagnosis came as an enormous relief.\n\n“Everybody thought I was stupid in school. My older siblings were clever in class, but I was regarded as being lazy. There was no help from the teachers in those days.”\n\nIt is his passion for music, and jazz in particular, that kept him going through the many obstacles he faced.\n\n“I could not have accomplished what I have without having a passion for music and a strong commitment to my goals. As a student, I have had to embrace struggle as a necessary part of my growth.”\n\n“Understanding that I wasn't stupid, and that I just learned differently was a long journey that required a lot of reflection, perseverance and hard work. I learned that just the label of dyslexia is not enough to help a struggling learner.”\n\nHe devised ingenious methods of using technologies such as slow-speed transcribers, digital dictaphones, computers, and iPods to help him in his studies. He now advises others with dyslexia to do the same.\n\nIn teaching children with dyslexia, Mulcahy believes the best approach is to focus on their strengths.\n\nTo read the entire interview, click here.\n\nArtists, Designers, Architects, and Chefs\n\nJeremy Emerson, chef\n\nExcerpt from: “Seasoned Chef Still Perfecting His Recipe for Success”\n\nLinda Broatch\n\nGreatSchools.org\n\nAs the sous chef at a five-star hotel in Florida, Jeremy Emerson once faced a situation so terrifying that he briefly imagined abandoning the career he loved. What pushed this accomplished man to the edge? He was asked, without warning, to read aloud during a meeting of the hotel's 30-plus department heads.\n\nJeremy has dyslexia. And he did what many dyslexic adults do in such situations, no matter how confident they usually are—he panicked.\n\nRaised in England in the 1970's and 80's, Jeremy spent his elementary and secondary school years struggling to learn, not aware that he had dyslexia. Picking up on cues from the adults around him, he assumed that he must be lazy or stupid.\n\nDyslexia runs in families, and both of Jeremy's brothers are dyslexic. Jeremy's older brother, Julian, had been “asked to leave school.” Yet he is now a software engineer for Intel.\n\nJeremy has been the Executive Chef at San Francisco's Four Seasons Hotel since 2003, where he manages a staff of 50.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nRichard Rogers, Pritzker-winning architect\n\nExcerpt from: “Richard Rogers, architect behind Pompidou Center, wins Pritzker”\n\nRobin Pogrebin\n\nInternational Herald Tribune\n\nThree decades after his Pompidou Center in Paris turned the architecture world upside down and brought him global fame, the British architect Richard Rogers has been named the 2007 winner of the Pritzker Prize, the profession's highest honor.\n\nThe award—a $100,000 grant and a bronze medallion—is to be presented to Rogers on June 4, 2007 at the Banqueting House in London.\n\nOther high profile projects by Rogers include the sprawling Millennium Dome in Greenwich, England; the new terminal at Barajas International Airport in Madrid; and Terminal 5 at London's Heathrow Airport.\n\nYet when his family moved to England in 1938, Richard struggled through the public school system. It was not until many years later that he received a diagnosis of dyslexia.\n\n“I was called backwards,” Rogers said. “We didn't know about dyslexia.”\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nTakanao Todo, architect\n\nExcerpt from: “Architect helps other dyslexics succeed”\n\nMidori Matsuzawa\n\nDaily Yomiuri Online (Japanese)\n\nSince his primary school days, Todo felt his efforts to write kanji were in vain, no matter how hard he tried.\n\nFor Todo, kanji are images. When he was in primary school, his mother taught him how to pronounce and guess the meaning of kanji by breaking them into their elements, much the way that foreign students study kanji. He still makes major mistakes when writing in kanji, and often confuses certain hiragana characters.\n\nHe describes reading as a sort of visual overload. “It's like all the textual information is coming out to me at once,” he explained. “It's so tiring to find my place.”\n\nTodo's memories of school life in Japan are bitter. In primary, his teachers did not accept students as they were, but instead, insisted on forcing the “different” students to become “normal.” Todo was labeled a difficult student and was treated as such. He became even more frustrated while at boarding school during his middle school years.\n\n“But my mother always accepted me the way I am,” he said. “If you can realize, even just once, that someone appreciates who you are, that feeling can last long, give you hope, and eventually the courage to try something.”\n\nHis mother sent him to Britain for high school, where his relatives had once worked or studied. While there, he was diagnosed with dyslexia. The testing also revealed his strengths, in particular, excellent spatial perception. He studied 3-D modeling and graphic design when he took his A-levels at Cambridge.\n\nIn 2002, he matriculated to London's Architectural Association School of Architecture, where he graduated this summer.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, his mother, Eiko, established a nonprofit organization in Japan called EDGE (Extraordinary Dyslexic Gifted Eclectic) to help those with dyslexia improve their innate strengths further so they can live with self-confidence.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nWriters and Poets\n\nChristie Craig, award-winning author\n\nExcerpt from interview: “Christie Craig—from dyslexic to humorous romantic suspense writer extraordinaire”\n\nTeri Thackston\n\nHouston Examiner\n\nChristie Craig is an award-winning writer, whose zany, humorous tales of romance, suspense, and life at its wackiest is one reason four of her books were accepted for publication on the very same day.\n\nDuring the interview, the reporter asked about her dyslexia:\n\nQ: How difficult was it for a kid with dyslexia to grow into a successful romance novelist?\n\nA: I seriously believe that I succeeded in this very hard business not in spite of my dyslexia, but in part, because of it.\n\nNothing came easy to me, and I didn't expect writing to be any different. The most needed tool to make it in this business I already had tucked inside—perseverance. So what if I got 10,000 rejections? Maybe the next one would not be a rejection.\n\nAlso, dyslexics have a knack of being intuitive. We pick up on people's emotions, body language, and tone of voice. So I could easily tap into human emotions, add my imagination, and—bingo.\n\nTo read the entire interview, click here.

She has sold more than 60 million books worldwide, and is a New York Times bestselling author. Not bad for someone who couldn't read until she was 11.\n\n“I am dyslexic, but they didn't have a word for that when I was a child,” says Debbie, who is from Washington State. “I was just considered slow. School was difficult.” That is an understatement.\n\n“I was the only girl in the slow reading group,” says Debbie, on a visit to Dublin to publicize her latest book. “My teacher said, ‘Debbie is a nice girl, but she will never do well at school.’ And I didn't.”\n\nTo read the rest of this story, click here.\n\nPhilip Schultz, Pulitzer Prize Winner\n\nExcerpt from: “Schultz wins Pulitzer Prize”\n\nDeepti Hajela\n\nDemocratAndChronicle.com\n\nRochester, New York, native and poet Philip Schultz is among this year's winners of the Pulitzer Prizes.\n\nIn a recent interview with Garrison Keillor, Schultz said he was a “terrible student” who suffered from dyslexia. He did not learn to read until he was in the fifth grade.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nAthletes\n\nGeorge Archer, champion golfer\n\nAssociated Press\n\nMSNBC.com\n\nGeorge Archer, the former Masters champion who died in September, kept a lifelong secret that his widow recently revealed in Golf for Women magazine.\n\nHe was illiterate.\n\n“Despite years of effort, he never learned to read beyond a rudimentary level. He never could write more than a few crude sentences,” Donna Archer wrote in the article, “The Secret They Shared”.\n\n“Eventually, he was able to get through an article on the sports page, and he learned to write his name for autographs,” she wrote, “But that was it.”\n\n“Over the years, George became incredibly adept at covering up his disability. But he was always afraid fans would want him to personalize an autograph, or that he'd have to read some prepared sentences on television.”\n\nDuncan Goodhew, olympic swimmer\n\nDavid Kelly\n\nBelfast Telegraph\n\nWhen Duncan Goodhew won the 100 meter breaststroke gold medal at the Moscow Olympics in 1980, he knew his life would never be the same. He said, “For me, the whole process of swimming was to change the deck of cards, because dyslexia is incredibly corrosive to your spirit.\n\n“At the age of seven, I was asked to read out loud in class. I was laughed at because I was struggling. I was fidgeting so much that I was literally tied to a chair and put in a corner with the dunce's hat on.\n\n“There was a lack of understanding then—and it's still happening.\n\n“Dyslexia is like being in a job you're not qualified for, and you don't speak the language. You're sitting there being told you are stupid all day, every day.\n\n“School gave me a fundamental understanding of what I was not good at. It gave me an acute desire to find something, a life preserver, and I found swimming.”\n\nMolly Sliney, Olympic fencer\n\nExcerpt from: “Olympic fencer Molly Sliney shares story of struggle and triumph”\n\nSally Kerans\n\nDanvers Herald, September 27, 2007\n\nOlympic fencer Molly Sliney spent the day at Highlands School last Friday.\n\nThe athlete, coach and motivational speaker shared not only her fencing expertise, but also her struggle with dyslexia, telling students that she is proof that anyone can set goals and achieve them if they learn to believe in themselves.\n\nHer many accomplishments in sports are impressive:\n\nShe was the youngest person ever to qualify for the Junior World Competition at age 13, just 3 years after her first lesson.\n\nIn addition to her 2 Olympic berths, in 1988 and 1992, she also earned a Gold medal in the U.S. Pan American Women's Fall Competitions twice.\n\nShe was a 4-time NCAA team champion.\n\nShe was named Notre Dame's Female Athlete of the Decade.\n\nYet her proudest accomplishment was receiving her degree from Notre Dame.\n\nNot bad for a kid who couldn't read until the age of 9.\n\nShe still remembers the spelling bee in 4th grade. She studied her spelling words every night. Her teacher gave her “the easiest word on the list” to spell. She got it wrong. Some of her classmates laughed. She returned to her seat, frustrated and stung by their taunts of “dumb” and “stupid.”\n\n“Boys and girls, when people say bad things about you,” she said, “you have two choices. You can ignore them or you can believe them. That day in 4th grade, I made the wrong choice. I decided to believe that I was dumb and stupid.”\n\nTo learn how she turned her life around by reading the entire story, click here.\n\nJackie Stewart, motor sports and business\n\nExcerpt from: “Please look after the poor wee boy at the back”\n\nDavid Leafe\n\nTelegraph.co.uk\n\nReclining in the comfort of an executive limousine and looking every inch the motor-racing legend and multimillionaire businessman that he is, Sir Jackie Stewart shared that his parents were baffled by his poor performance at school. He remembers with horror one occasion when, as a little boy, he was asked to read in front of the class.\n\n“All I could see as I looked at the book was a jungle: a whole clutter of words. My teacher, Miss Shaw, was telling me to get on with it, but I was blushing and couldn't swallow.\n\n“All around me, the other children were sniggering, or pretending to blow their noses to hide their laughter.”\n\nDescribing school as “the most painful and humiliating period of my life,” he recalls his desire to leave school at the age of 15.\n\n“When you are being called thick, dumb and stupid, you end up leaning towards others who are like you, who won't humiliate and abuse you. Unfortunately, I ended up in a very bad crowd.”\n\nIt was not until he was 42, and one of his sons was diagnosed with dyslexia, that he discovered, “I wasn't stupid after all. I felt like I had been saved from drowning.”\n\nTo read the entire story, click here.\n\nEntrepreneurs and Business Leaders\n\nTerri Bowersock, entrepreneur\n\nExcerpt from: “Show, don't tell: A CEO defies dyslexia”\n\nTerri Bowersock\n\nFortune, April 2, 2008\n\nWith a $2,000 loan from my mother, I have grown my Tempe-based firm, Terri's Consign & Design Furnishings, into the largest U.S. resale furniture retailer, with 16 stores and $36 million in annual sales. And I've done it despite my dyslexia.\n\nI wasn't always open about my dyslexia. Because I was teased in school, I became a master at “fake it until you make it.” In meetings, I'd pretend I could read the papers being passed out.\n\nPeople ask if I attribute my success to overcoming dyslexia. I tell them that I have not, and never will, overcome dyslexia. Yes, I run a national company, but I still use a Franklin Talking Dictionary to try to spell fifth-grade vocabulary words.\n\nBut at least I've shown my grade school teachers that it is not that I wasn't trying hard enough.\n\nTo read the entire article, and learn about the many tools Terri uses to compensate, click here.\n\nJohn Chambers, CEO Cisco Systems\n\nExcerpt from: “Leaders & Success: Chambers Has Cisco In Gear”\n\nBrian Womack\n\nInvestor's Business Daily, June 27, 2007\n\nJohn Chambers leads one of the largest high tech firms in the world—networking gear maker Cisco Systems—but the West Virginia native could not keep up with classmates as an elementary student.\n\nChambers suffered from dyslexia, crippling his reading abilities and damaging his confidence.\n\n“There's nothing harder on you than when people come around the classroom in first, second, and third grade and call on you. Your stomach tightens up; you know you'll mess up the reading,” he told IBD.\n\nChambers says dyslexia is especially frustrating because more effort couldn't fix the problem. “My parents would sit and read with me in the evening, and it would get worse, not better,” he said.\n\nEventually his parents found expert help. The process did more than help him read more easily.\n\n“Once you understand that you can overcome something that you doubted you would ever overcome, you gain more inner confidence. It helped me learn to deal with the challenges in life.”\n\nTo read the entire story, click here.\n\nBarbara Corcoran, business\n\nExcerpt from: “Barbara Corcoran: ‘Jersey girl’ trumped Trump with street smarts”\n\nJay McDonald\n\nBankrate.com\n\nAs a girl growing up in New Jersey, Barbara Corcoran would gaze across the Hudson River at the Manhattan skyline, not knowing that one day, she would reign as queen of New York residential real estate.\n\nAfter all, she was hardly a born deal maker.

She nearly gave up.\n\n“It was my dyslexia,” Jo admits. “I was terrified that I would make a huge mistake.”\n\nThe night before filming began, Jo was sick all night long.\n\nThe next morning, she told the editor, “I can't do this.

He is founder and CEO of the online game-trading site, eGamePlace.com, valued at $30 million.\n\n“Going through school, I felt like I was a stupid failure,” Evan shared. “Slowly but surely, because I did not give up, I eventually began to learn to read and things began to come together for me. It was by no means easy.”\n\nEvan would play video games when he came home from school, after a long day of bullying and struggling in class.\n\n“When I was younger, the only people who believed in me were myself and my family.”\n\nLast year, he started the Dyslexic Dream Foundation, and he donates 70 to 80 percent of his earnings to fund programs to help students overcome dyslexia.\n\n“The goal of the foundation is to raise awareness, and to educate teachers and schools,” he said. “I also set up scholarships because some of the great private schools cost more than some colleges.”\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nTommy Spaulding, former CEO of Up With People\n\nExcerpt from: “Leadership guru addresses chamber”\n\nReflector.com, October 6, 2010\n\nFormer CEO and president of Up With People, the largest non-profit in the world, Tommy Spaulding has become a guru on the topic of leadership. In a luncheon speech to promote his book, he shared how he won a prestigious Rotary Ambassadorial Scholarship to get an MBA—despite struggling with dyslexia in school.\n\nAs an East Carolina University graduate with only a 2.0 GPA, he faced stiff competition for the scholarship from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton graduates with perfect academic records.\n\nHis experience with his college roommate who was paralyzed in his freshman year, plus his rejection by 35 law schools, pulled at the heart strings of the committee.\n\nBut it was his treatment of the bartender at the hotel where the scholarship committee held interviews that got him the award. The committee was deadlocked between Spaulding and a Harvard graduate when the chairman asked the bartender what he thought.\n\nSpaulding had spent hours talking to the bartender about his life and family, while the other applicants ignored him.\n\n“The committee heard about my heart and passion from the bartender, and they overlooked my grades,” he said.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nSpaulding's book, It's Not Just Who You Know, which he co-wrote with Ken Blanchard, was released in August.\n\nTracing Business Success to Dyslexia\n\nExcerpt from: “Tracing Business Acumen to Dyslexia”\n\nBrent Bowers\n\nNew York Times, December 6, 2007\n\nIt has long been known that dyslexics are drawn to running their own businesses, where they can get around their weaknesses in reading and writing and play on their strengths. But a new study of entrepreneurs in the United States suggests that dyslexia is much more common among small-business owners than even the experts had thought.\n\nThe report, compiled by Julie Logan, a professor of entrepreneurship at the Cass Business School in London, found that more than a third of the entrepreneurs she surveyed identified themselves as dyslexic.\n\n“We found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills,” said Professor Logan. “If you tell your friends that you plan to start a business, you'll hear over and over, ‘It won't work. It can't be done.’ But dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about maneuvering their way around problems.”\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nGovernment\n\nJeffrey Gallet, judge\n\nExcerpt from: “First Person: A Judge's Story”\n\nJeffrey H. Gallet\n\nLDOnline.org\n\nEveryone at school said that I was lazy or stupid or both. After a while, I began to believe them. Sometimes, I just gave up. I couldn't write, spell, or read, or answer questions quickly. I didn't even know which hand to put over my heart when we recited the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nMy mother was a trained teacher, but even she did not understand dyslexia. The term was almost unknown when I was a child. But my parents never gave up on me, although it must have been a great disappointment to those two scholarly people that their first born could barely graduate from high school.\n\nThey encouraged me to go to college and I did, graduating last in my class.\n\nI wanted to go to law school, and Brooklyn Law School took a chance on me. I was lucky to have loving parents, as well as a college professor and a law school roommate who supported me, encouraged me, tutored me, and refused to let me fall victim to my frustrations and give up. I graduated in the middle of my class.\n\nI wasn't diagnosed with a learning disability until I was 35. By the age of 37, I was a judge.\n\nHaving failed English courses in both high school and college, I finally learned how to write. But today, with 5 books and over 30 articles to my credit, I still suffer from an irrational fear that I am about to make a fool of myself every time I sit down to write.\n\nI agreed to write this article, after first refusing, because as a judge, almost every week I see a learning disabled child who, undiagnosed or untreated, is venting his or her frustrations in anti-social ways. I could have stood in that same spot. If not for loving, caring, involved parents, my frustrations at not being able to keep up in class, and to some extent in the play yard, could have burst forth in the same self-destructive way.\n\nThe schools and the courts have not met their responsibilities to LD children. They have not allocated the resources to do what must be done.\n\nTo read the entire article, which includes Judge Gallet's attempts to improve the judicial system, click here.\n\nDan Malloy, governor of Connecticut\n\nExcerpt from: “AP Interview: Malloy overcame dyslexia, physical struggles”\n\nSusan Haigh\n\nBoston.com, May 29, 2006\n\nWhen Dan Malloy accepted the Democratic Party's nomination for governor at this month's state convention, he mentioned how proud his mother would have been had she lived to see that moment.\n\nAs a child, Malloy struggled to read, calculate math problems, and even tie his shoes. He suffered from dyslexia at a time when the term “learning disabilities” was uncommon.\n\nAs late as fourth grade, Malloy's teachers thought he was mentally retarded.\n\nHe recalls how one teacher posted his failing spelling grades on the chalkboard.\n\nMalloy, 50, and mayor of Stamford, said “People from my childhood would not have predicted the level of success I've been able to accomplish.”\n\nTo read the entire interview, click here.\n\nScientists, Doctors, Engineers, and Inventors\n\nDr. Maggie Aderin, rocket scientist\n\nExcerpt from: “Seeing stars”\n\nTrudy Simpson\n\nVOICE Online, August 1, 2007\n\nDr. Maggie Aderin, who holds a Bachelors degree in Physics and a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering, has built telescopes, has helped create instruments to test missile warning systems and detect landmines, as well as satellites that monitor climate change.\n\nYet her teachers dismissed her when she declared she wanted to study science because she had dyslexia. She shared:\n\nI was not considered very bright because I had dyslexia. When I first told my teachers I wanted to study science, they shook their heads and said I should consider something else.\n\nBut I received encouragement at home. My father always said if you work hard, you can achieve so much. So I pushed myself. Although I suffered from dyslexia, I was quite logical, and I really loved science because I loved being hands on.\n\nWhen people realized I was good at science, I got lots of tuition and encouragement.\n\nIn her first year at Imperial College in London, she was one of only two black people, and one of only ten women, in her class of 200.\n\nScientists have a good life. The work is hard, the pay is good, and it can be fun. Her company, Science Innovation Limited, has a program to get the public engaged in science, especially girls and minorities.\n\nShe'll also appear in two of the BBC's upcoming six-part science series, “The Cosmos: A Beginner's Guide.”\n\nTo read the rest of her story, click here.\n\nMark Fairbank, winner Presidential Award for Excellence in Teaching\n\nExcerpt from: “Obama picks alumnus for teaching excellence award”\n\nCayla Gales\n\nStateHornet.com, December 8, 2010\n\nShortly after failing third grade, Mark Fairbank found out he had dyslexia. But that did not stop him from becoming an award-winning teacher.\n\nPresident Obama recently declared Fairbank one of the top science and math teachers in the country. He will receive the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching.\n\nEven as a third grader, Fairbank knew he wanted to teach chemistry.\n\n“I struggled through my entire career at school. So I went to community college for three years,” Fairbank said. “At Sacramento State, I studied from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. every single day, including Saturdays and Sundays, so I could make it through.”\n\nHe received help from his mother, who read textbooks to him, and from his wife and best friend who typed his papers.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nJack Horner, paleontologist\n\nExcerpt from: “Jack Horner: An Intellectual Autobiography”\n\nJack Horner\n\nLDOnline.org\n\nI suffered from a lack of confidence due to dyslexia. I wasn't diagnosed until well after I had reached adulthood, had struggled through school being considered lazy, dumb, and perhaps even retarded, and had flunked out of college seven times. Most people expected I'd wind up working at a service station, or if I was really lucky, I might get to drive a truck at my father's gravel plant.\n\nKindergarten through eighth grade was extremely difficult for me because my progress in reading, writing, and mathematics was excruciatingly slow. I would never read out loud in class, even if the teachers threatened to give me failing grades. The joke was that I only carried schoolbooks to ballast my lanky body against the strong winds of Montana. Eventually, I managed to graduate from high school, but just barely, having received Ds in all required classes, including English, in which my grade was a D minus, minus, minus. The teacher told me that this was essentially an F, but that he never wanted to see me again.\n\nThere was, however, one area of school besides P.E. in which I excelled: science projects.”\n\nJack Horner became one of the most well known paleontologists in the world. He has discovered the most dinosaur eggs, the first dinosaur embryos, and three species of dinosaurs. Although he never graduated from college, Jack received the MacArthur Foundation Award (called the “Genius Award”), several honorary doctorate degrees, and served as technical advisor for all of the Jurassic Park films.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nJames Sorenson, billionaire inventor\n\nExcerpt from: “Billionaire inventor James Sorenson dies at 86”\n\nDiana Rosenthal\n\nCNNMoney.com, January 22, 2008\n\nJames Sorenson, inventor of the computerized heart monitor and of disposable paper surgical masks, died on Sunday.\n\nAlthough he was the richest man in Utah when he died, with a fortune estimated at $4.5 billion, he struggled through the Great Depression, and dyslexia, to emerge as one of the century's great inventors.\n\nTo read the entire article, click here.\n\nDr. Ronald Thompson, professor and NIH researcher\n\nExcerpt from: “Professor transcended dyslexia for a life of the mind”\n\nStephanie Hayes\n\nTampaBay.com, November 3, 2007\n\nHe was the kid with the butterfly net.
