        "text": "1\n\nMary Fowler\n\nAustralian soccer star Mary Fowler now has a mini-me … in plastic form! The 21-year-old was amongst nine other trailblazing sportswomen globally, including tennis champion Venus Williams, to be transformed into a Barbie doll ahead of the Paris Olympics. Mattel revealed the “Role Model” dolls on May 22, each with their own bespoke (and adorable) accessories. Created in Fowler’s likeness, her bubble-braid doll dons a pink uniform, gloves and holds a soccer ball. She shared the exciting news to her Instagram shortly after the line-up was revealed.\n\n“Super grateful for the opportunity to capture and share a version of myself when I feel my strongest, and most confident,” Fowler shared in a caption. “Thanks @Barbie for making a mini Mary and reminding me how important it is to be yourself.”\n\n2\n\nBarbie Doll With Down Syndrome\n\nBarbie is launching its first-ever doll with Down’s syndrome so all children can “see themselves in Barbie.” In a bid to offer a more diverse range, Mattel partnered with the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS) in the US to advise on how to “accurately represent a person with Down’s syndrome.” Ellie Goldstein, a British model with Down’s syndrome, fronted the campaign and said she was “so thrilled” to see a doll like her.\n\n“When I saw the doll, I felt so emotional and proud,” Goldstein wrote to Instagram, “It means a lot to me that children will be able to play with the doll and learn that everyone is different. I am proud that Barbie chose me to show the dolls to the world.” According to a press release, the new Barbie will have “a rounder shape, smaller ears, and a flat nasal bridge, while the eyes are almond-shaped. The doll’s palms even include a single line, a characteristic often associated with those with Down’s syndrome.” The doll will also wear a pink pendant necklace with three chevrons, representing how people with Down’s syndrome have three copies of their 21st chromosome. “Diversity is important as people need to see more people like me out there in the world and not be hidden away, Barbie will help make this happen,” Goldstein said.\n\n3\n\nJane Goodall\n\nIn honour of World Chimpanzee Day, Mattel unveiled a green Barbie modelled after Dr. Jane Goodall on July 11. The doll, which shares a likeness with one of the world’s top primatologists, was made from 90 per cent recycled plastic. The Goodall doll wears a khaki shirt and shorts, holds a notebook and has a pair of binoculars around her neck. She also includes a replica of David Greybeard — the first chimpanzee Goodall studied at Gombe National Park in East Africa.\n\nGoodall told Reuters she was “thrilled” to be made into a Barbie, with many children learning about her at school. “I wanted a doll to be me even before this idea came up. I’ve seen…little girls playing with Barbie dolls and certainly at the beginning, they were all very girly girly and I thought little girls need…some choice.”\n\n4\n\nDavid Bowie\n\nBarbie marked the 50th anniversary of David Bowie’s iconic fourth studio album Hunky Dory on June 29 with a limited-edition doll. The Bowie Barbie dons a dapper powder blue suit, just like the one the singer wore during his ‘Life on Mars’ music video. The statement doll was also accessorised with a pin-striped shirt, polka dot tie and ’70s-style brown platform boots. However, it’s not the first Bowie doll Mattel has made. Back in 2019, the US toy manufacturer replicated his Space Oddity era with a recreation of his ‘Ziggy Stardust’ look.\n\n“Barbie honors the ultimate pop chameleon with a tribute to @DavidBowieReal & his impact on music, art, fashion & film,” Barbie tweeted.\n\n5\n\nLaverne Cox\n\nLaverne Cox said all her “Barbie party dreams [came] true” when she became the first transgender Barbie doll. Cox celebrated her 50th birthday by twinning with her newly-released doll, which saw the Orange is the New Black actress wear a sparkling silver catsuit overlaid with a red leather corset and sheer tulle skirt by American designer Garo Sparo. Like Cox’s birthday ‘fit, the doll comes with two outfits which the star conceptualised as a cost-effective way for children to have more play options with one Barbie.\n\n“It’s been a dream for years to work with Barbie to create my own doll. I can’t wait for fans to find my doll on shelves and have the opportunity to add a Barbie doll modelled after a transgender person to their collection.” Cox said she hopes the doll could inspire more to “dream big” in their careers.\n\n6\n\nQueen Elizabeth II\n\nMattel commemorated the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee with a limited edition figure of Britain’s longest reigning monarch. The doll’s face was sculpted to resemble Queen Elizabeth II with a tiara also based on the very one she wore during her wedding day. The ivory outfit also pays homage to the Queen’s customary gown for royal portraits — which features an attached pink ribbon given to her by her father George VI and a pale blue sash from her grandfather George V. The doll was also packaged in a Buckingham Palace inspired box. Mattel only made 20,000 Queen Elizabeth II dolls.\n\nRoyalists reportedly snapped up the £95 (AUD $167) Barbie just three seconds after it was released online. However, those still interested in the doll may be able to purchase it via re-seller sites — but it’ll cost you a small Barbie fortune. Some eBay lists have seen the Queen doll priced at £1,000 (AUD $1764).\n\n9\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton\n\nBarbie naturally celebrated the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s first wedding anniversary in 2012 with replica dolls. Each Barbie, while sharing facial likeness to the royals, was also dressed in a miniature reproduction of their wedding attire. The Kate Middleton doll wore a near-identical floor-length ivory gown, like that of her majestic Alexander McQueen bridal dress, meanwhile the William doll resembled his specially-commissioned Irish Guards uniform. Mattel made just 438 variations of the pair for the occasion.\n\nThe covetable collectors item has since been displayed at museums and exhibitions, including the Fundación Canal in Madrid. The dolls’ value also reportedly skyrocketed in the lead up to the Platinum Jubilee with some eBay listings showing a minimum £300 (AUD $526) price tag.\n\n10\n\nJulie Bishop\n\nBelieve it or not but Julie Bishop also made the Barbie cut. In June 2021, Mattel revealed their newest ‘Role Model’ doll — that being our former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. As a member of the newly-formed G7 Gender Equality Advisory Council, the first female Chancellor of the Australian National University and “first Australian politician to take fashion seriously,” Mattel called Bishop a “true trailblazer.” However, the doll is extra exclusive — meaning it isn’t actually for sale. Mattel simply gifted Bishop with a one-off replica.\n\nAccording to The Sydney Morning Herald, Bishop has long been a Barbie girl herself. She still has her Jackie Kennedy doll her parents gave her as a child. “Knowing how much Barbie had meant to me as a little girl, knowing how Barbie had evolved into this doll that inspired young girls to choose fascinating careers, I jumped at this opportunity,” Bishop said.\n\n11\n\nZendaya\n\nAfter Zendaya was controversially criticised for her 2015 Oscars look by Giuliana Rancic on E!’s Fashion Police, Barbie honoured the star for “standing up for her culture.” The lookalike doll replicated the-then 19-year-old’s full outfit and glam, which included locks and a recreation of her ivory Vivienne Westwood gown. “She’s a role model who is focused on standing up for yourself, your culture, and for what you believe in — that’s very relevant for girls,” Michelle Chidoni, a spokesperson for Mattel told TODAY.com. Like the Julie Bishop doll, sadly the Zendaya Barbie isn’t for sale — however, we certainly see another doll in the Euphoria actresses future!\n\n“When I was little I couldn’t find a Barbie that looked like me, my…how times have changed,” Zendaya shared to Instagram. “Thank you @barbie for this honor and for allowing me to be apart of your diversification and expansion of the definition of beauty. Can’t wait to keep doing amazing things with you😘😘😘.”\n\n12\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\nMattel enshrined Naomi Osaka in plastic shortly after the tennis star took a mental health break in July 2021. The doll also reportedly sold out within just hours of its release. The Osaka Barbie sports a Nike dress and white visor and holds a Yonex tennis racket, inspired by her 2020 Australian Open outfit. Barbie commissioned designer Carlyle Nuera to make the doll, who praised the player for raising awareness about social injustices. “Obviously Naomi’s athletic skill is unmatched, that’s a fact,” Nuera said in a press release.”But what I personally admire the most about Naomi Osaka is how she uses her platform, the spotlight on her and her voice, to raise awareness about social justice.”\n\nOsaka also tweeted about the Barbie, sharing she hoped it’d serve (no pun intended) as a reminder that every child can achieve their dreams. “I hope every child is reminded that they can be and do anything,” Osaka said.\n\n13\n\nAshley Graham\n\nAshley Graham became a Barbie in 2016 — but the supermodel made one body-positive request. “She had to have her thighs touch. No ands, ifs or buts about it,” Graham told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. Graham also wanted the doll to have cellulite — she’s long shared images of cellulite to her social media — however, Mattel said it would look more like a production mistake as opposed to body dimples.\n\nDespite this, Graham was still ecstatic with the result. After the doll was unveiled she said: “She got a round belly. She got round hips. She got round everything, yes!” She also said it was encouraging to see that anyone can be Barbie. “Beyond the fashion, it’s so incredible because, now, I’m not striving to be Barbie. I am Barbie. Everyone can be Barbie.”\n\n14\n\nCher\n\nCher has had a number of Barbie’s modelled after her over the years but in 2007, Mattel paid tribute to her ’80s music video ‘Turn Back Time. The doll was designed by Bob Mackie, Cher’s habitual designer, and featured a back studded faux leather jacket, sheer bodysuit, garter belt and over-the-knee boots. The Cher Barbie also comes with a miniature microphone. It’s also part of Barbie’s ‘Black Label’ line intended for collectors and those 14 and over.\n\nYears before Mattel began designing Cher Barbies, the legendary performer had her own line of dolls during her ‘The Sonny and Cher Show’ days. So popular was the doll during the mid 1970s that it reportedly beat out Barbie sales."
