        "text": "It may surprise some that Cher isn’t a big fan of Cher.\n\nDuring a recent interview with Paper magazine, published online Thursday, the Grammy-winning singer admitted that she “just never liked my voice that much.”\n\n“If I had my choice, I probably would have another one, but I didn’t get my choice. I got my mother’s voice,” she said.\n\nThough Cher may not be the biggest fan of herself, she has millions of other fans who are happy to claim that title. After getting her start in the ‘60s as one-half of the pop duo Sonny & Cher, she eventually headed out on a solo career, which resulted in several chart-topping hits.\n\nWhen asked how she would want her voice to be different, the Oscar-winning actress explained, “I don’t know, it’s weird. It doesn’t sound like a man, it doesn’t sound like a woman. I’m somewhere more in between. I have this strange style.”\n\nShe added, “I do what you do when you can’t hold a note: I don’t pronounce my Rs. I guess some consonants are hard to sing, so I just gotta leave them open.”\n\nCher noted that throughout her decades-long career, she has never really liked her voice very much, but that she’s “happy as a clam” that other people enjoy listening to it.\n\n“I wouldn’t have picked it,” the singer said. “I liked it on my mother, and it’s definitely my mom’s voice. My mom’s is softer, mine is edgier — different, but the same — but I don’t think I would have picked it.”\n\nOver the course of her music career, Cher has scored four No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including “Believe,” “Half-Breed,” “Dark Lady” and “Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves.” She also had eight other tracks that were Top 10 Hits.\n\nEarlier in the interview, Cher told the outlet that out of all the albums she has made, “some of the ones I thought were as good as I could like an album of mine weren’t hits. And then other ones that I was not that excited about [were]. But my career has been like this [makes an up-and-down motion].”\n\nShe does like her latest studio album, Christmas, however, which was released on Oct. 20, adding, “When I listen to it, I think this worked out. It wasn’t planned out, but it worked out.”"
