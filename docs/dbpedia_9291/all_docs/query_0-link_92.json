        "text": "The early 1990s were tough years for Cher. Battling chronic fatigue syndrome and unsure of her next career move, she signed up for some easy dough by appearing in that most maligned of TV contrivances, the infomercial. In a three-part series for Lori Davis hair-care products, the statuesque chanteuse perched on a sofa and marveled at the moisturizing might of shampoo.\n\nFans were confused. Fellow celebs looked on in horror. So campy were the infomercials that Saturday Night Live’s send-up—featuring Chris Farley, in drag, as Lori Davis—didn’t have to exaggerate that much."
