        "text": "Itâs Monday night, and though youâre at a concert, youâre still a Northwestern student, so your to-do list looms in the back of your mind no matter what else youâre doing.\n\nYouâre at SPACE, the Society for the Preservation of Art and Culture in Evanston, and just as youâre getting settled in your surroundings while simultaneously crafting your history paperâs thesis statement in your head, electronic artist Lawless enters. His effortless stage presence instantly draws in the crowd, and you miraculously forget about all eight of your student groups. The audience is completely engrossed, following him through every twist the music takesâevery riff on his guitar, every unexpected Nirvana clip incorporated into his music. Then you realize that he is your\n\nfellow classmate.\n\nSheridan Road Records is Northwesternâs first student-run record label, and the organization wants to give exposure to as many campus musicians as possible. They organize concerts to give performance opportunities to everyone from seasoned producers with Chicago gigs under their belts to your dorm neighbor who responds to requests to silence his 2 a.m. guitar playing by countering that âmaybe you should quit hating on these dope licks.â Northwestern is swarming with musical talent, and Sheridan Road Records is the platform ensuring that audiences hear it.\n\nThe group formed last Winter Quarter under co-founders Kate Camarata and Melissa Codd, both Bienen seniors. They aimed to organize live performance events to create a unified music scene at Northwestern by bringing together artists of all genres. Since then, theyâve staged concerts in a range of venues, including the labelâs launch party at a memberâs house, a concert-turned-open mic at Norris this quarter and âstudy breakâ event at Kafein. One recent event, Space Jam, was their largest, located at SPACE in November.\n\nâThere are a lot of music groups on campus, but they all promote a different style or a different genre, and the opportunities to play on campus are really slim,â Camarata says. She notes that the wide array of settings in which Sheridan Road Records organizes concerts, particularly informal venues, helps facilitate an inclusive, communal mentality among artists. âItâs very much an attitude that anyone can do it if you want to,â she adds.\n\nThere is no shortage of artists itching to get onstage. Victor Lalo, a junior in McCormick who performs under the name Lawless and produces music with electro, hip-hop and reggae influences, relished the opportunity to perform with Sheridan Road Records at SPACE in the fall.\n\n\"That was the most fun Iâve had,â he says about his opportunity to work with the label. âIt was a really high point. To actually be onstage â¦ Youâre just in the zone, in the moment, and itâs surreal. Itâs a unique experience that I donât have anywhere else.â\n\nThe labelâs founders and the performers agreed that the live performances Sheridan Road Records organizes expose a new dimension of studentsâ musical personas, benefitting musicians and audiences alike. The âphysical aspect of bringing [musicians] together is huge,â according to Jacob Skaggs, a 2015 Communication graduate and member of Northwestern-based band Coffee Breath. From the artistsâ point of view, Sheridan Road Records provides musicians with âthe benefit of having a show bigger than they would normally have on their own,â he says.\n\nâItâs surprising that theyâre just students,â Camarata says. âSometimes you forget. When youâre watching, youâre like, âI was in math class with this dude.ââ\n\nIn order to offer exposure to a growing number of artists, however, the Sheridan Road Records founders says they must spread more awareness of the label itself, which has progressed considerably since its formation. They shared that they frequently receive emails from Northwestern musicians asking about performance and collaboration opportunities, along with other aspects of production that the label helps with in addition to promoting artists, but they say making the Sheridan Road Records name more prominent on campus is still the toughest challenge.\n\nâItâs gotten a lot better, but itâs also difficult because youâre always inundated with flyers or Facebook invitations or notifications,â Camarata says. âThereâs so much stuff to join here.â\n\nBut both Camarata and Codd predicted a promising future for their label.\n\nâEveryone likes music, just like they like food. And everyone knows about Spoon. So why canât we be like Spoon?â Codd reasons.\n\nDespite their senior status, the founders have ambitious plans for the labelâs future, which was clear when they quickly rattled off a long list of ideas for future events and ways they plan to expand the label beyond the concerts they regularly hold. This included compiling a recording session video series, which they would release as a way to promote artists, and the creation of an offshoot campus music publication â anything they can think of to increase awareness of the vast talent pool of student artists and build a true community surrounding it.\n\nâItâs just a cool culture to have around if you can just go across the street and listen to live performances of your fellow Northwestern peers,â Codd says. âThatâs a great opportunity.â"
