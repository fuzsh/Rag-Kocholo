        "text": "New Arabic (and Arab) writing in translation published (online, free) this month:\n\nNOVEL EXCERPTS\n\nExcerpt from Barbarians’ Paradise, by Khalil Sweileh, trans. Michele Henjum (Jadaliyya)\n\nSomeone was finishing his coffee when the mortar was dropped. The cardamom scent of his coffee mixed with that of his blood, while his right arm flew out the window like a blind bird and minutes later bumped—and this is pure speculation— against the body of a woman who’d just lost her left arm. No matter, the dead have divine arrangements for the use of amputated limbs as needed, at least for souvenir photographs.\n\nExcerpt from The Cat That Taught Me How To Fly, by Hashem Ghraibeh, trans. Nesreen Akhtarkhavari (Banipal)\n\nImad’s friendship with The Cat grew. That angered Asaf. He objected to The Cat and Abu Zahra joining their circle. Their close, small group prepared dinner and ate together, and Asaf didn’t want those two to be part of it. “Abu Zahra, I can understand,” Asaf said. “He can wash the dishes and light the Primus stove. But The Cat – a plumber – that repulses me.”\n\nOld Man rubbed his large nose: “Cleaner than you,” he said to Asaf.\n\nPOETRY\n\n“If One Day the People” and “Demonstration” by Ahmed Douma, trans. Elliott Colla (ElliotColla.Com)\n\nIf one day the People wills to live,\n\nThen they can go revolt.\n\nAnd the echo of their songs can chase away palace dogs\n\nAnd they can raise their banners whose cloth has been dragged in the dirt\n\nDragged through streets, servility and surrender.\n\nAnd they can turn those banners into a plan of attack\n\nAnd hang the darkness of their night on the gallows.\n\n“Look,” “Translation,” and “Train,” by Marwan Ali, trans. Raphael Cohen (Banipal)\n\nI stop\n\nunder the tree\n\nunder\n\nyour balcony.\n\nI give it a good shake\n\nperhaps I’ll enjoy\n\nan old look\n\nof yours.\n\n“Exile Was Born At This Moment,” by Osama Esber, trans. the author (Words Without Borders)\n\nThe door we knock on is always closed,\n\nand when it is opened,\n\nwe glimpse another that is closed.\n\nWe linger inside\n\ndarkness injected with the opium\n\nof what is glowing there.\n\n“Untitled,” by Derar Soltan, trans. Fawaz Azem (ArabLit)\n\nThree years have passed, and you have to be ecstatic whenever you live to see another day. Whenever you tear off impatiently another page from the calendar, and then begin to contemplate the new wrinkles in your face and check the expiration date of your heart that resembles a cemetery for rent, you have to smile and be extremely courteous and handsome so that the shot will be suitable for the coming story of your death, because our reputation is at stake, and the world will not feature our recurrent, boring death on its screens.\n\nSHORT STORIES\n\n“Turning Thirty,” by Abdellah Taïa, trans. Daniel Simon (World Literature Today)\n\nI feel weak. I’m no longer able to sleep at night, so I think about Isabelle Adjani, about her singing voice. I’m ashamed, having spent years in France, seven years already, that Adjani’s voice has replaced my mother’s in my head. No, no, it’s not that I’ve forgotten her, my mother, no, it’s simply that everything in me comes from her, everything that I am is marked by her, her indelible imprint. I suffocate.\n\n“The Curse of the South,” by Mohammad Ali Diriye, trans. Xavier Luffin (Words Without Borders)\n\nSuch are the barefoot persons, always in a hurry, with the same pace. He didn’t know monotonous days before he suffered from hunger in Yemen. The Red Sea had rejected him just like a father who chases his disrespectful son away and forbids him to cross over the threshold of his house ever again.\n\nCREATIVE NONFICTION\n\n“On Dead and Living Characters,” by Sinan Antoon (Jadaliyya)\n\nThese catastrophic events in Iraq remind me of a real person I knew very well, my aunt Na’ima, who lived with us in Baghdad and was a second mother to me.\n\n“Chicago: Present-Day Paradise, Future Magic,” by Mahmoud Saeed, trans. William Hutchins (Words Without Borders)\n\nThus the ordinary resident of Chicago cannot see the river at all, and that is the exact opposite from my country. For us Iraqis, the river is a simple, unassuming, popular being that belongs to everyone, even though it is the unrivaled master of the city. You see it when you cross one of Baghdad’s numerous bridges. You see it only steps away when you sit in a coffeehouse built on its shore. You see it from the hundreds of restaurants on both banks. You see it when you enjoy a beer in a bar or drink juice or coffee.\n\nESSAYS\n\nIdentity, Power, and a Prayer to Our Lady of Repatriation: On Translating and Writing Poetry, by Khaled Mattawa (Kenyon Review)\n\nWhat I’m saying is that translation contains one of the essential gifts of poetry. The great poets, to me, are those who have a wider sense of what they can see, of what they allow themselves to see, let alone what they allow themselves to feel or empathize with. This is a lesson to us both as poets and as translators.\n\nALSO, WORK BY RECENTLY DECEASED PALESTINIAN POET SAMIH AL-QASIM\n\nA letter from Samih al-Qasim to Mahmoud Darwish, trans. by Zeina Azzam (Jadaliyya)\n\nA letter from Samih al-Qasim to Rashid Hussein, trans. Elliott Colla (Jadaliyya)"
