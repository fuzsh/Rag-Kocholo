        "text": "Jenin's militants and Israel's military have made this city notorious as a place of death. But to Imad Abu Zahra, it was home, and as a journalist he struggled to express its history, its turbulent politics and its desperation.\n\nToday, he died of a wound he suffered on Thursday, when he made his last effort to tell the world about life here by photographing Israeli tanks downtown.\n\nTwo other Palestinians, including a 13-year-old boy, were killed today, by Israeli gunfire in the Gaza Strip, bringing to at least 36 the number of Palestinians killed since June 20, when Israel began seizing West Bank cities in response to back-to-back suicide bombings in Jerusalem. Another death was reported though not confirmed.\n\nAt least 17 of those killed have been unarmed civilians, said the Israeli human rights group B'tselem.\n\nThe Israeli offensive in the West Bank, which has the tacit backing of the Bush administration, has succeeded so far in stopping suicide attacks in Israel. Cafes in Jerusalem -- at least those that stayed open on the Jewish Sabbath -- were jumping tonight, after weeks of fearful silence.\n\nThe price to Palestinians has been high, with hundreds of thousands of people who Israel acknowledges are innocent virtually prisoners in their homes, under 24-hour curfew and stringent travel restrictions.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
