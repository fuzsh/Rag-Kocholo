        "text": "2022 has been the deadliest year for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation in decades. In the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem specifically, this year marked the highest number of killings of Palestinians in the territories since the UN began recording fatalities in 2005.\n\nThe killings began almost instantaneously, with the first two Palestinians killed within the first week of January — one by an Israeli soldier, and one by an Israeli settler. From then on, the killings did not stop.\n\nSince the start of the year, Mondoweiss has kept a record of all the Palestinians killed by Israeli forces and settlers. As part of our documentation efforts, we have cross referenced the numbers and names of those killed with reports from the Palestinian Ministry of Health, local and international news agencies, and independent journalists.\n\nAt the time of publication, the total number of Palestinians killed in 2022 stood at 231. This number also includes 53 killed in Gaza, 49 of whom were killed during Operation Breaking Dawn in August, and five Palestinians with Israeli citizenship who were killed inside the territory of the Israeli state.\n\nThe vast majority of the deaths this year, however, came from the occupied West Bank, with 173 Palestinians killed. For the purpose of this report, we will focus on those who were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, or those who were residents of the West Bank and Jerusalem but were killed in other parts of occupied Palestine.\n\nThis list does not only include Palestinians who were shot dead by Israeli soldiers, or run over by Israeli settlers. It also includes Palestinian political prisoners who died inside Israeli prisons as a result of “direct medical negligence,” or those who died while resisting Israeli apartheid and colonialism, and are thus considered “martyrs” — those who died for the cause — by the Palestinian public.\n\nAmong the 173 killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were 39 children aged 17 and under, making them close to 27% of the total deaths in the territory.\n\nAccording to our documentation, the least amount of Palestinians killed in a month this year was six, and the highest number was recorded in October, when 30 Palestinians were killed — almost one person every day on average.\n\nWithin the West Bank, the highest number of casualties occurred in two specific regions: Nablus and Jenin, representing 19% and 34% of the total casualties, respectively. The particularly high number of deaths in the two regions of the northern West Bank can be attributed to the resurgence of armed resistance witnessed in both areas, which the Israeli military focused its efforts on quashing this year.\n\nIn late 2021, the Israeli army amended its already loose open-fire regulations in the occupied West Bank, officially allowing troops to shoot at Palestinians who had thrown rocks or Molotov cocktails at civilian vehicles, even if the Palestinian no longer presented an immediate threat.\n\nThe military spokesperson has maintained that the amended regulations only apply when rocks or fire bombs are thrown towards civilian vehicles, not when such objects are thrown towards forces during military raids, and that soldiers are to follow a protocol in which the use of deadly force is a last resort. The nature of the killings this year, however, tell a different story.\n\nAccording to documentation collected by Mondoweiss, the vast majority of those killed were shot by Israeli police, border police, and the military during confrontations with Israeli forces. While there was a significant rise in armed confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli armed forces this year, many of those killed were shot while unarmed, or while throwing stones or Molotov cocktails towards Israeli army vehicles and armed soldiers. In many cases, rights groups deemed that those killed did not pose an explicit threat to the lives of the Israeli soldiers when they were killed.\n\nThese are the names and faces of every Palestinian who, according to our records, was killed or died as a result of Israeli military, settler, and colonial violence in 2022.\n\nOccupied West Bank & East Jerusalem\n\nTotal deaths: 173\n\n1. Bakeer Hashash, 21\n\nDate: January 6\n\nLocation: Balata Refugee Camp, Nablus, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: shot with live ammunition\n\nBakeer Hashash was shot in the head during an Israeli military night raid into Balata Refugee Camp in southern Nablus, where he lived. The military was conducting an arrest raid, and was met with resistance from armed groups in the camp. Hashash was reportedly confronting the soldiers when he was shot; it remained unconfirmed if he was armed. Hashash was the first Palestinian killed by Israeli forces in 2022.\n\n2. Mustafa Falaneh, 25\n\nDate: January 6\n\nLocation: Beit Sira Checkpoint, Ramallah, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: vehicular ramming\n\nMustafa Falaneh was on his way to work, and was crossing the street near the Beit Sira checkpoint west of Ramallah when an Israeli settler rammed him with a car, killing him. At the time, Israeli media reported that Israeli police were “investigating the incident,” though no one was arrested. Falaneh was a husband and father of an 18-month-old girl, and was from the Ramallah-area village of Safa. He was the first Palestinian killed by an Israeli settler in 2022.\n\n3. Omar Asad, 80\n\nDate: January 12\n\nLocation: Jiljilya, Ramallah, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: heart attack\n\nOmar Asad, a Palestinian-American, was on his way home from visiting relatives when an Israeli military patrol in his town pulled him over. When he reportedly “resisted a check,” the soldiers dragged him out of his car, blindfolded him, tied his hands behind his back with zip ties, gagged him, and took him to a warehouse where he was left for several hours in the cold. Asad died of a heart attack during that time, and his unconscious body was left behind by the soldiers.\n\n4. Suleiman al-Hathalin, 80\n\nDate: January 16\n\nLocation: Umm al-Khair, Hebron, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: vehicular ramming\n\nSuleiman al-Hathalin, an icon of the popular resistance movement in the South Hebron Hills and across the occupied West Bank, was run over by an Israeli truck on January 5 during a protest in his village. He sustained critical injuries, including a fractured skull and serious injuries to his spine, ribs, and hip. He succumbed to his wounds on January 16. The truck that ran him over had been contracted by the Israeli police to tow unlicensed vehicles in Hathalin’s village of Umm al-Khair. The police claimed the incident was an accident, and that al-Hathalin was in the middle of the road, while local eyewitnesses said he was on the side of the road and was “deliberately” rammed by the truck, which fled the scene. Israeli police who were also at the scene reportedly left without stopping to assess the damage done by the truck, or to call an ambulance.\n\n5. Faleh Musa Jaradat, 39\n\nDate: January 17\n\nLocation: Gush Etzion settlement, Bethlehem, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: shot with live ammunition\n\nFaleh Jaradat was shot and killed by Israeli forces outside the illegal Gush Etzion settlement in the southern West Bank, after he allegedly attempted to stab an Israeli soldier in the area. His body was reportedly seized by Israeli forces and withheld from his family.\n\n6. Fahmi Hamad, 57\n\nDate: January 24\n\nLocation: Qalandiya Refugee Camp, Jerusalem, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: tear gas inhalation\n\nFahmi Hamad, a resident of the Qalandiya refugee camp, was on his way to the local clinic to get his diabetes medication when Israeli forces raided the camp, firing dozens of rounds of tear gas into the area, including near the clinic where Hamad was located. UNRWA said the raid lasted several hours, and that their appeals to Israeli authorities to stop firing tear gas and allow their staff and patients to evacuate the clinic were “regrettably not addressed.” Hamad suffered from suffocation due to tear gas inhalation, and was treated at a local hospital. His family said that even after he was released, he continued to cough and had trouble breathing. He died that same night. The Qalandiya refugee camp lies between Jerusalem and Ramallah, and is considered part of the Jerusalem district, though it lies on the West Bank side of the separation wall.\n\n7. Ashraf Mubasalat, 21,\n\n8. Mohammad Dakhil, 22\n\n9. Adham Mabroukeh, 26\n\nDate: February 8\n\nLocation: Nablus, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: shot with live ammunition\n\nAshraf Mubasalat, Mohammad Dakhil, and Adham Mabroukeh were shot and killed by Israeli forces during an ambush of their vehicle in the city of Nablus’s Makhfiyeh neighborhood. The three were members of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades, the armed wing of the Fatah movement, and were founding members of the novel Lions’ Den group in Nablus. The three were killed as part of Israeli military operations targeting Palestinian resistance fighters who were suspected of carrying out operations against Israeli targets in the West Bank.\n\n10. Mohammad Abu Salah, 16\n\nDate: February 14\n\nLocation: al-Sila al-Harithiya, Jenin, occupied West Bank\n\nCause of death: shot with live ammunition\n\nMohammad Abu Salah was shot and killed by the Israeli army while it was raiding the village of al-Sila al-Harithiya. The raid sparked protests in the village, which drew crowds of Palestinians from al-Sila al-Harithiya and the surrounding villages, including the neighboring town of al-Yamoun, where Abu Salah was from. According to Defense for Children International – Palestine (DCIP), Israeli forces “suddenly and without warning” began firing indiscriminately at the crowds of Palestinians, injuring dozens of people, including Abu Salah, who was shot in the eye, and his cousin, who was shot in the hand while attempting to aid Abu Salah. DCIP said the two were running away when an Israeli sniper shot them. Abu Salah was the first Palestinian child killed in 2022.\n\n11.
