Since Ariel Sharon became prime minister in February 2001, 17 journalists have been wounded, 70 have come under fire and 15 foreign or Palestinian media offices have been occupied by the Israeli army. Since the start of Operation Rampart on 29 March 2002, at least 30 journalists have been arrested and six of them – all Palestinians – are still being detained.\n\n“The Israeli army is acting with complete impunity. This is also intolerable. How many more must die before the army stops attacking the media? Reporters Without Borders has decided to add Sharon to its worldwide list of predators of press freedom,” Ménard said.\n\nAbu Zahra, who was 35, died in hospital. The previous day, at around noon (local time), after a curfew had been lifted, the photographer was in the centre of Jenin with Said el-Dahla, a photographer from the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, when Israeli tanks fired on them without warning, wounding both in the legs.\n\nAbu Zahra was more seriously hurt and lost a great deal of blood over more than an hour because Israeli troops refused to allow an ambulance to reach him. He was eventually taken to hospital in a car where he was placed in intensive care. Witnesses said there had been no clash underway when the pair were hit. An Israeli army spokesman said, “the mob threw stones and firebombs at the vehicles.”\n\nRaffaele Ciriello, special correspondent for the Italian daily “Corriere della Sera”, was killed in Ramallah on 13 March, also after being wounded by Israeli gunfire. He was hit by six bullets fired from a tank near al-Manara Square, in the city centre (see IFEX alerts of 19, 14 and 13 March 2002)."
