He added that IOF demolished 2 dwellings belonging to the brothers first time on 14 December 2020 only 3 months after their marriage while in the second time their dwellings were demolished on 16 June 2021.\n\nIt should be noted that Bab al-Shams village was established in 2014 in az-Za’ayyem village, northeast of occupied East Jerusalem, upon a decision issued by the Palestinian Cabinet to challenge the Israeli settlement activity in the area. Days after establishing it and setting tents, IOF issued a decision to demolish the village.\n\nAt approximately 10:30, IOF backed by military vehicles and accompanied with an Israeli Civil Administration vehicle moved into Tal Ma’in area, east of Yatta, south of Hebron. IOF deployed in the area, and the Civil Administration officer handed Sa’id Hamamdah a notice to stop construction works in his land, according to the Israeli Civil Administration’s claims that he infringed upon the monuments in the area. The Israeli authorities use different claims for the notices they handed to civilians to prevent them from building in Area C.\n\nOn Sunday, 10 October 2021, the Israeli municipality bulldozers continued excavation works in al-Shuhadaa’ Cemetery adjacent to al-Yousifiyah Cemetery in al-Asbat Gate area in central occupied East Jerusalem. As a result, bones and bodies of those who were buried there appeared, enticing rage among civilians who gathered to stop the excavations there.\n\nHead of the Islamic Cemeteries Committee in Jerusalem, Mustafa Abu Zahra, said that the Israeli occupation authorities have continued the razing and excavation works to turn al-Shuhadaa’ Cemetery into a park. While working in the morning, bodies of Muslims buried there were exhumed, so parts of their bodies appeared. Abu Zahra added that the Israeli Antiquities Authority claimed when it arrived at the cemetery that the workers made a mistake as the instructions directed to them were to work on the site and lay sand without any razing work because it already knows there is a cemetery there. Abu Zahra explained that desecration of the cemetery is humiliating, shocking and unjustified. He added that it is clear that the attack on Al-Shuhadaa’ and Yousifiyah Cemeteries has been ongoing for years, until the excavation and razing works reached archaeological ruins close to the threshold of Bab Al-Asbat.\n\nTherefore, tens of outraged civilians gathered to protest against the desecration of the cemetery in front of it and performed the Maghreb and ‘Ishaa at the entrance. After the protesters finished ‘Ishaa prayer, IOF attacked them and fired sound bombs at them to disperse them forcibly.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the al-Shuhadaa’ and al-Yousifyah cemeteries have been under systematic attack over the past years. In 2014, IOF prevented the burial at al-Shuhadaa’ cemetery and removed 20 graves of Jordanian soldiers who were martyred in 1967. Meanwhile, in November 2020, they demolished the wall of the cemetery adjacent to al-Asbat Gate, removed its archaeological staircase, closed the stairs leading to it, and built the street that leads from the gate to the Friday Market along the northern wall to Burj al-Laqlaq, under the pretext of excavation and maintenance works. It is noteworthy that the Islamic Cemeteries Committee resorted to the Israeli court and submitted documents proving that the cemetery belongs to the Islamic Endowments. At the time, the court issued a decision to ban any works in the cemetery, but after a while, a person was buried there; as a result, the grave was taken as an excuse to abolish the decision. In late July, the court’s judge responded to the Israeli municipality and Nature Authority’s request to resume razing the cemetery land after seven months of issuing a precautionary order to stop it. The Yousifiyah cemetery is one of the most famous Islamic cemeteries in Jerusalem. It is located to the north of Al-Asbat Gate and houses the graves of Palestinian families who live in Jerusalem.

When they were on their way out from the hospital to go home, his son fainted, so he took him back to the hospital. He added when they were at the Emergency Department with his brother, ‘Alaa’, the medical crews there asked them to leave; they were treated in a very humiliating way and pushed out of the department. When the father refused leaving his son unconscious alone, the emergency crew called the hospital security, who assaulted the father and his brother.
