        "text": "An Israeli soldier shot and killed a cameraman with Associated Press television news who was covering a skirmish between troops and rock-throwing Palestinians in the West Bank city of Nablus today, witnesses said.\n\nThe Israeli military had no immediate comment but said it was looking into the shooting.\n\nNazeh Darwazeh, 45, was filming clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians that began early today. Doctors said Darwazeh died of a bullet wound to the head.\n\nVideo footage taken by a Reuters cameraman showed young Palestinian men running up an alley toward a parked armoured personnel carrier. After they threw rocks at the vehicle, troops fired shots. Witnesses said several firebombs were thrown toward the vehicle, and later footage showed a part of it on fire.\n\nThe footage then showed a man with a rifle in green combat fatigues kneeling down between the armoured personnel carrier and the wall of a house at the top of the alley. Witnesses identified the man as an Israeli soldier.\n\nThe footage showed him pointing his weapon toward the journalists. Seconds later, Darwazeh was seen lying in a doorway in a pool of blood.\n\nHe and other cameramen, still photographers and reporters had been at the bottom of the alley and were wearing brightly coloured vests that said \"Press.\" It was unclear whether there was anyone behind Darwazeh at whom the soldiers might have been aiming when he was shot.\n\n\"A soldier came from under the tank and shot towards us,\" said Hassan Titi, a Reuters cameraman who witnessed and filmed the shooting.\n\nAnother witness, Sami al-Assi, a cameraman with a local TV station, said \"The Israelis shot him and aimed specifically at us.\"\n\nBefore the shooting, there were clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian gunmen in an area near the alley. Seventeen Palestinians were injured, doctors said. Nablus has been a flashpoint of recent tensions between Israeli troops and Palestinians.\n\nDr Hussam Johari of the Rafidieh Hospital said Mr Darwazeh died from a bullet wound to his head.\n\nHe had been shot above the right eye as he peered into the camera viewfinder, doctors said. Reuters photographer Abdel Rahim Quesini said there were five photographers in the group that had been filming the clashes.\n\nMr Darwazeh had lived in Nablus all his life and had worked for Associated Press for two years. He is survived by a wife, Raeda, and by five children ranging in age from 6 months to 9 years. Mr Darwazeh is the 27th AP journalist to be killed on duty since the founding of the news cooperative in 1848.\n\nHe is the fifth AP television cameraman or producer to be killed since the news agency created its news video service in 1994.\n\nThe conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories remains one of the world's most dangerous assignments for journalists.\n\nRaffaele Ciriello, an Italian freelance photographer, was killed on March 13 in Ramallah by Israeli gunfire, according to reports by journalists and witnesses. Ciriello was the first foreign journalist killed while covering the current Palestinian uprising, which began in September 2000.\n\nImad Abu Zahra, a Palestinian freelance photographer, was killed by army gunfire on July 12 in the West Bank city of Jenin, witnesses said.\n\nIssam Tillawi, a reporter for the Voice of Palestine, died on September 22 last year in Ramallah. Tillawi, a journalist and program host for the official Palestinian Authority radio station, was shot in the head by Israeli gunfire during protests."
