        "text": "A joint project of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP); US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (USACBI); and the Association of Academics for the Respect of International Law in Palestine (AURDIP)\n\nOpen Letter on Behalf of Professor Imad Ahmad Barghouthi\n\nBenjamin Netanyahuâ¨\n\nPrime Minister of Israelâ¨\n\nPrime Ministerâs Officeâ¨\n\n3 Kaplan St. Hakiryaâ¨\n\nJerusalem 91950, Israel\n\nPM_ENG2@pmo.gov.il\n\nDear Prime Minister Netanyahu:\n\nWe are writing to urge you to order the immediate release of Dr. Imad Ahmad Barghouthi from Israeli military custody.\n\nDr. Barghouthi, a Palestinian resident of the West Bank, is an astrophysicist and professor of physics at Al-Quds University in Jerusalem. He was reportedly arrested by Israeli soldiers at the military checkpoint at Nabi Saleh in the West Bank, northwest of Ramallah on 24 April 2016. The Times of Israel reported that \"neither the IDF nor Israel Police would comment on the matter, and it remains unclear which branch of the Israeli security forces was responsible for his arrest.\" The Palestine Information Center reported that on 2 May 2016, \"An Israeli court ... issued an administrative detention order against Professor Barghouthi \" [1]. Professor Barghouthi is being held without charge [2], a serious violation of human rights.\n\nAs described in the journal Nature, Professor Barghouthi was previously arrested without charge by Israeli Border Police on 6 December 2014 when he attempted to cross the border from the West Bank to Jordan to board a flight to the United Arab Emirates so that he could attend a meeting of the Arab Union of Astronomy and Space Sciences, an organization he helped to found [3].\n\nProfessor Barghouthi's attorney at that time, Jawad Boulos, alleged that Dr. Barghouthi was arrested because of his statements in support of Palestinian activities during Israelâs invasion of the Gaza Strip the previous summer, and that during interrogations Dr. Barghouthi was asked what statements he wrote on Facebook and what he said on television in opposition to the Israeli occupation [3]. Following letters of protest from international scientific organizations, including the Committee of Concerned Scientists in the United States, Dr. Barghouthi was released on 22 January 2015 [4].\n\nThe re-arrest of Professor Barghouthi is part of a broader pattern of disruption and suppression of Palestinian educational systems. The University of Gaza has been bombed multiple times [5]. Birzeit University in the West Bank has been closed down at least 15 times by the Israeli military, and its former president, Dr. Hanna Nasir, a physicist, was deported and remained in exile for 19 years. Arrests of faculty and students, in some cases because of Facebook posts in opposition to military occupation, have continued into 2016 [6]. Israel has destroyed or damaged hundreds of Palestinian schools, even kindergartens [7].\n\nArticle 26 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to which Israel is a signatory, grants all people the right to education. We urge you henceforth to respect those principles and to order the immediate release of Professor Imad Barghouthi.\n\nSincerely,"
