        "text": "On 11 May, Israeli forces shot and killed Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Unbelievably, the Israeli army then attacked her funeral. Video footage shows Israeli soldiers targeting mourners. The soldiers ripped down the Palestinian flag and beat mourners, who then almost dropped Shireen’s casket:\n\nVICE journalist Hind Hassan pointed out how many Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israeli forces:\n\nAnd rapper Lowkey shared the names of other Palestinian journalists Israeli forces have killed:\n\nIsraeli forces shot and killed Shireen in cold blood. This was an attack on freedom of the press. It was an attack on the right of Palestinians to exist. And it was an attack on everything Shireen stood for, including fearless reporting on the actions of an apartheid state.\n\nMake no mistake, the Israeli army knew of Shireen Abu Akleh – as Al Jazeera producer Linah Alsaafin pointed out:\n\nMedia pattern\n\nPredictably, just as Shireen’s killing was spun by mainstream media, so too was her funeral.\n\nThe BBC News world edition tried to disguise the despicable actions of Israeli forces:\n\nAnd CBS News brought up the fabled ‘clashes’ again:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SbsEsq/status/1525286203909582849?s=20&t=PfsB0Gex_lBhiao9MX672A\n\nThe willingness of so many media outlets to use such weak language only shows how fundamentally opposed they are to the existence of Palestinians. Israeli forces killed Shireen Abu Akleh. She spent her life reporting on those same forces. They attacked her funeral and stopped mourners from grieving the loss of a beloved reporter.\n\nMiddle East Eye shared an article which argued that misreporting is free propaganda:\n\nAs Middle East Eye argued, the silence from fellow journalists is directly propping up an apartheid state.\n\nSilence is violence\n\nAl Jazeera producer Laila Al-Arian pointed to this same silence from many journalists:\n\nMoreover, VICE producer Lama Al-Arian also shared thoughts on the lack of solidarity:\n\nMeanwhile AJ+ presenter and producer Dena Takruri pointed to the dehumanisation of Palestinians:\n\nAlso, Takruri explained how media outlets dismiss and distrust eyewitness accounts from Palestinians:\n\nAnd one of Shireen’s friends and co-workers, foreign policy expert Rula Jebreal, shared her grief:\n\nCommunity grief\n\nHowever, that grief – as Palestinians know all too well – is conditional. The inaccurate reporting from many outlets reflects the fact that Palestinians are abandoned both in life and in death. Palestinians cannot grieve the same as everybody else. Palestinian deaths cannot be mourned without interference.\n\nAs AJ+ presenter Sana Saeed said:\n\nSo we must grieve openly and hold Shireen in our hearts. Her killing is indescribably painful, as is the attack on her funeral. Her family and loved ones must feel the outpourings of love and solidarity from the global community."
