        "text": "STEVE INSKEEP, host:\n\nA verdict is expected Monday in Europe's biggest al-Qaeda trial so far. Since April, judges in Madrid have heard evidence against 24 men accused of belonging to an al-Qaeda cell based in Spain. One of the defendants is a correspondent for the Arabic satellite television channel Al-Jazeera. Jerome Socolovsky reports from Madrid.\n\nJEROME SOCOLOVSKY reporting:\n\nOne of the highlights of Tayssir Alouny's career was his exclusive interview with Osama bin Laden shortly after the September 11th attacks. During the trial here in Madrid, Alouny was asked how he managed to land that interview. He said he'd already explained that to an investigating magistrate.\n\nMr. TAYSSIR ALOUNY (Al-Jazeera Correspondent): (Foreign language spoken)\n\nSOCOLOVSKY: `I told him, your honor, that I was neither privileged nor favored because I was the only television correspondent in Kabul at the time, so bin Laden had no alternative,' he said. But prosecutors have presented the interview as evidence that Alouny was in fact a member of al-Qaeda. They say he belonged to a cell known as the Soldiers of Allah, which allegedly recruited terrorists in Europe and helped plan the September 11th attacks. Alouny, who's 50 years old, was born in Syria. After moving to Grenada in southern Spain, he worked as a translator for the Spanish national news agency. Then in early 2000, Al-Jazeera hired him and sent him to Afghanistan. Jose Yoldi is covering the Madrid trial for the Spanish newspaper, El Pais.\n\nMr. JOSE YOLDI (El Pais): (Foreign language spoken)\n\nSOCOLOVSKY: `Perhaps what the court sees as significant,' he says, `is that Alouny doesn't appear to have had a serious journalistic career before he became Al-Jazeera correspondent in Kabul.' The indictment says Alouny maintained intense contacts with another Syrian immigrant in Grenada called Imad Yarkas, also known as Abu Dahdah. He's the key defendant in the trial, accused of being the leader of the al-Qaeda cell in Spain. Prosecutors say Abu Dahdah gave Alouny money to take to al-Qaeda during his reporting trips to Afghanistan. Fatima al-Zahra is Tayssir Alouny's wife. Speaking from her home in Grenada, she says Alouny and Abu Dahdah were merely casual acquaintances.\n\nMs. FATIMA al-ZAHRA (Tayssir Alouny's Wife): (Foreign language spoken)\n\nSOCOLOVSKY: `The Syrian community in Spain is relatively small. Everybody knows each other,' she says. Many of Tayssir Alouny's defenders in the Arab world believe his trial is the result of a conspiracy involving America, Israel and Western intelligence agencies. His wife says Washington did not like his reports from Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nMs. al-ZAHRA: (Foreign language spoken)\n\nSOCOLOVSKY: `Tayssir filmed images of brutalized children, of women being buried,' she says. `They killed civilians and aid workers, so he showed that it was a lie that these were surgical strikes.' Al-Jazeera's editor in chief is Ahmed Sheikh. He says Alouny is being scapegoated for having given bin Laden publicity.\n\nMr. AHMED SHEIKH (Editor-in-Chief, Al-Jazeera): And if they want to go on on this basis, this means that all the journalists who interviewed bin Laden in the past should be brought to justice and tried by a Spanish court. It's unbelievable actually.\n\nSOCOLOVSKY: The press freedom group, Reporters without Borders, worries that the trial's focus on the bin Laden interview could set a dangerous precedent that any journalist could be prosecuted for having contacts with terrorists. Alouny's testimony has been broadcast live on Al-Jazeera. The trial is being closely followed in the Arab world.
