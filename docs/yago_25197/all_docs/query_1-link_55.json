        "text": "QuizInc presents the second edition of Global Glimpses where we revisit the history of the Forgotten City in Beijing, China. Built during the Ming Dynasty in the early 15th century, the Forbidden City served as the imperial palace and political center of China for over five centuries, housing emperors and their households. Covering over 180 acres and containing over 980 buildings, the Forbidden City is renowned for its traditional Chinese architecture, grand halls, pavilions, and courtyards adorned with intricate decorations and imperial treasures. As a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1987, the Forbidden City symbolizes China's imperial history and cultural heritage. It attracts millions of visitors annually, offering insights into the country's dynastic past and influencing global perceptions of Chinese art, architecture, and governance.\n\nAbout 12,000 years ago, one of the oldest civilizations known to man left a big chunk of history called G√∂bekli Tepe in √ñrencik, Turkey. It was in form of Architecture. Another 7,500 years after that, another part of history is made with what stands today as the Giza Pyramids. Also Architecture. Needless to say that also after that, the Roman empire changed the face of the earth and left huge imprints still in our societies today. Architecture. From then on, religions, cultures, societies, ideologies and much more was carved in history the same way, through creative minds and passionate people willing to tell their story for much longer than they can as human beings, So they turn to Architecture. Now that you know this, note every time you sit on your desk that : your idea, your sketch, your interventions and thoughts can be shaping the future and making history more than any other person in the world as an Architect. And that's how important you are! If you made it this far and this really was for you, share so other Architects in need of this message would get it. Cheers! üçª\n\nArticle published EXPLORING THE INTRICATE ARCHITECTURAL FABRIC OF A HISTORIC ARAB MEDINA: A STUDY OF NABLUS OLD TOWN Core to the Yalla Project is to cultivate a collaborative network among researchers to generate trustworthy knowledge concerning our built environment. We closed the last year with one of the initial achievements towards this objective, exemplified by the publication of an article. This paper was conceived, discussed, and developed through collaborative efforts with Dr. Ameen Abu Bakr, a distinguished history professor at An-Najah National University. Our collaboration was born through our social caf√© Antique, in the historic precinct of Nablus, which we used to sit in for a break from time to time. Our amicable coffee table chats took off towards a substantial academic collaboration. This contribution unveils noteworthy and unexpected methodologies employed by our ancestors in crafting a refined yet sustainable built environment. The article particularly elucidates the intriguing practices of micro place-making as observed among the populace of Nablus in Palestine during the Ottoman era. This publication is the outcome of an extensive multi-year investigation into the processes of place-making within the Islamic city, based on the interdisciplinary analysis of Ottoman archives in the Nablus area. The study was conducted through a meticulous examination of archival materials spanning 400 years. The study reveals a high degree of freedom to act, reciprocity, and distinctive perspectives regarding architectural compositions.
