        "text": "For part II, I thought we might wade into books. Here are the top 125 books on Douban. For your reference, Douban does not disclose the algorithm that determines the top 250 books or movies. it’s presumed that both the rating score and the number of people who rated a certain movie or film are weighed.\n\n1. Dream of the Red Chamber（红楼梦）\n\nAuthor: Cao Xueqin（曹雪芹）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: mid-18th century\n\nCelebrated as one of the best Chinese language literature, the Dream of the Red Chamber chronicles the fall of a great noble family in imperial China. Its masterful writing and intricate plots have something to offer for everyone. Chinese literature giant Lu Xun famously commented that in this novel scholars of classics can find reminiscent of the I-Ching, the prude can find corruption, literature masters can find romance, and the revolutionary can find anti-Manchu sentiments, and the gossiper sees juicy stories of the court.\n\nAnother great fan of the novel is no other than Mao Zedong, who praised the book for its profound critique of China’s feudal system and traits of feminism, which was rare in works during the imperial age.\n\nThe book is one of the big four classics of Chinese literature (四大名著), but is unfortunately an incomplete work. Some of the mysteries surrounding the proper ending of the story, as well as some of the plots, have spurred the emergence of “Redology”, or the study of the Red Chamber.\n\nThere are plenty of translations of the book in foreign languages, grab one that’s to your liking and unlock this Chinese literary treasure.\n\n2. To Live（活着）\n\nAuthor: Yu Hua（余华）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1993\n\nThis is the novel that inspired the namesake movie ranked 30 on the film’s list. For obvious reasons, the pictures painted in the original novel were even grimmer than in the movie adaption.\n\nThe novel follows the main character through China’s civil war era, the great leap forward, and the Cultural Revolution, recording his struggles against fate and sorrows as his loved ones die.\n\nThe novel is celebrated both for its faithful depiction of the resilience and grit of the Chinese people and the hardships they faced.\n\nThe novel itself is not long, but as one critic describes it, the book is the ultimate collection of major themes that frequently appear in other literature depicting the same period.\n\n3. 1984\n\nAuthor: George Orwell\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1949\n\nNow this book claiming the number 3 spot may surprise a few of you. Or at least that’s how Peter Hessler felt when he remarked in his latest New Yorker piece that “In 2021, more than two hundred thousand copies of “1984” were sold in Chinese editions, along with a hundred thousand copies of “Animal Farm.”\n\n4. One Hundred Years of Solitude\n\nAuthor: Gabriel García Márquez\n\nCountry: Argentina\n\nPublication: 1967\n\nA section of this novel, the very beginning, was included in China’s literature textbook for high school students, ensuring that Márquez’s masterpiece is the second most famous Spanish literature in China (after Don Quixote).\n\nWhile not that many can claim to know the entire plot of the book, its opening line will certainly be familiar to those who are on Chinese social media, as wordplay on the classic opening line is a favorite of some web users.\n\n5. The Three-Body Problem（三体）\n\nAuthor: Liu Cixin（刘慈欣）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 2008\n\nThis is probably the best science fiction novel China has offered the world in the 21st century. WSJ called it “War of the Worlds for the 21st century.”\n\nThe trilogy is set against the backdrop of China’s Cultural Revolution, a secret military project that sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, rivaling camps form on whether to welcome or fight the aliens.\n\nJust before this newsletter is published, a movie adaptation of the book has just released a trailer.\n\n6. Gone with the Wind\n\nAuthor: Margaret Mitchell\n\nCountry: United States\n\nPublication: 1936\n\nHonestly, what’s not to love about the book? The gripping love story of the upper class? The heroic actions of protecting the homeland and ways of life? Or the upbeat ending reminding the readers that tomorrow is another day? These are what won the book its popularity among Chinese readers, who may relate little to the cruel realities of slavery in the plot’s background.\n\n7. Harry Potter\n\nAuthor: J. K. Rowling\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1997 - 2007\n\nYes as with anywhere else in the world, the boy who lived enjoys a great fan base in China. With the newly opened Beijing Universal Studios which features a majestic Hogwarts castle, Chinese wizards and witches now have just a place to demonstrate their magic.\n\n8. Romance of the Three Kingdoms（三国演义）\n\nAuthor: Luo Guanzhong（罗贯中）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 14th century\n\nRomance of the Three Kingdoms, attributed to Luo Guanzhong, is a historical novel set in the turbulent years stretching from the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty to the beginning of the Western Jin Dynasty better known as the era of the Three Kingdoms.\n\nThe story dramatizes a game of thrones by more than 100 colorful characters who mostly pledge allegiance to three kingdoms, the Wei, the Shu, and the Wu. So popular is the work that it forever changed how the Chinese view this part of history, and some of its characters are given godlike qualities and were worshiped throughout the age.\n\nInterestingly, the novel also has a huge readership in Japan, which is why many of their most popular video games and animes have taken this theme.\n\n9. Fang Si-Chi’s First Love Paradise（房思琪的初恋乐园）\n\nAuthor: Lin Yihan（林奕含）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 2017\n\nThe most influential book of Taiwan’s #MeToo movement, Fang SiChi’s First Love Paradise is a chilling tale of pedophilia, sexual assault, and structural inequality in upper-class Taiwanese society. Author Lin Yi-Han’s intense stream-of-consciousness narrative style brings us directly into the young minds that are targeted, displaying before their and our very eyes how sexual assault can shatter human life, and how far unequal social institutions will go to hide the damage and protect abusers.\n\nFang Si-Chi’s First Love Paradise was Lin Yi-Han’s gift to the world before she took her own life. As a work of both literature and literary activism, the book lives on to inspire readers and raise consciousness all over the world.\n\n10. Animal Farm\n\nAuthor: George Orwell\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1945\n\nOrwell takes another spot in the top 10 list.\n\n11. The Complete Sherlock Holmes\n\nAuthor: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1986\n\nYes, there are master detective novelists Agatha Christie and Keigo Higashino, but for novels of this genre, Sherlock Holmes is like the original coca-cola and classic flavor Lays potato chips.\n\n12. Journey Under the Midnight Sun\n\nAuthor: Keigo Higashino\n\nCountry: Japan\n\nPublication: 1999\n\nSpeaking of the devil, here’s Higashino with his best-known work in China. The Japanese detective novel master will return many times on this list.\n\n13. The Little Prince\n\nAuthor: Antoine de Saint-Exupéry\n\nCountry: France\n\nPublication: 1943\n\nAs one of the world’s most translated books, The Little Prince is loved by many in China as well.\n\n14. Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils（天龙八部）\n\nAuthor: Jin Yong/Louis Cha（金庸）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1963\n\nThe martial hero (武侠) novel is perhaps the most original of Chinese literature. Novels of this genre usually feature heroes with unworldly martial art skills and their 江湖. (The “jianghu” , literally rivers and lakes, is the milieu, environment, or sub-community, often fictional, in which many Chinese wuxia stories are set. It is used to describe the martial arts world of Historical China.)\n\nThis masterpiece is set in the Northern Song Dynasty, with the main thematic element of the novel concerning the complex, troubled relationships between characters from various kingdoms and sects and the inherent bond that underlies the struggles of each.\n\nJin Yong is the unparalleled master of martial hero novels. He leaves behind 14 main works, some of which will appear in this list. His works are steeped in Chinese culture and are highly recommended, if not extremely pleasurable, to read.\n\n15. The Complete Hans Christian Andersen Fairy Tales\n\nAuthor: Hans Christian Andersen\n\nCountry: Denmark\n\nPublication: 1835-1872\n\nWhen it comes to foreign fables, Andersen, Aesop, and the Grimm Brothers are in their own league. But while Aesop’s stories are often laden with moral values and the German stories sometimes showing a dash of darkness, Andersen’s G-rated fairy tales perhaps have the widest audience.\n\n16. Stories of the Sahara（撒哈拉的故事）\n\nAuthor: Sanmao（三毛）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1976\n\nStories of the Sahara is an autobiographical account of the life and love of the Taiwanese author Sanmao while she was living in the Sahara Desert with her boyfriend José. “Stories of the Sahara” is a breathtaking exploration of the adventures―and misadventures―of untamable wanderlust. Sanmao, with her fearless independence, has become an inspiration for a generation of Chinese.\n\n17. To Kill a Mockingbird\n\nAuthor: Harper Lee\n\nCountry: United States\n\nPublication: 1960\n\nHow far is one willing to go to preserve honesty and bravery in an adverse environment? This book prod readers of all ages and backgrounds to reflect.\n\n18. Call to Arms（呐喊）\n\nAuthor: Lu Xun（鲁迅）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1923\n\nI’m slightly disappointed that Lu Xun, perhaps the biggest name in modern Chinese literature, only came in 18th place in the ranking.\n\nLu Xun became the flag-bearer of the new culture movement in China soon after the demise of the Qing Dynasty. As a weakened China loses direction and conviction, Lu Xun was a beacon of light in guiding the path forward. Originally trained as a doctor, Lu Xun picked up the pen after coming to realize that “learning medicine cannot save the Chinese”.\n\nMany of his short essays or novellas are included in Chinese literature textbooks and dropping his works from textbooks has always been a sensitive issue on social media. Lu Xun gave his name to one of the four most prestigious Chinese literary awards.\n\nCall to Arms, a short fiction collection, depicts the social life in China from the Revolution of 1911 to the May Fourth Movement.\n\n19. Stories about Ming Dynasty（明朝那些事儿）\n\nAuthor: Dangnian Mingyue（当年明月）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 2006\n\nStories about Ming Dynasty depict the history of the Ming Dynasty from 1344 to 1644 in a novelistic and humorous tone. Based on historical materials, the author successfully balanced accuracy and storytelling in this 7-parter that triggered widespread interest in the history of Ming.\n\nThe book was first posted on the internet forum Tianya in 2006. The book has sold over 5 million copies, being the best-selling book in the 2007-2008 period.\n\nThe author’s real name is Shi Yue and was an official of the Guangdong customs when he wrote the books. He now serves as deputy director of the Shanghai government research office.\n\n20. The Silent Majority（沉默的大多数）\n\nAuthor: Wang Xiaobo（王小波）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1997\n\nThe Silent Majority is a collection of philosophical essays, covering social morality and ethics, cultural debates, Sinology and new Confucianism, etc, representing Wang Xiaobo’s thoughts on modern Chinese culture. In the 21st century, Wang Xiaobo is among the most-read of 1990s Chinese novelists. His unique black humor runs through his works.\n\n21. The Stranger\n\nAuthor: Albert Camus\n\nCountry: France\n\nPublication: 1942\n\nPerhaps once in a while, we all need to examine our ties with this world.\n\n22. The Story of the Lost Child\n\nAuthor: Elena Ferrante\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nPublication: 2014\n\nThe Story of the Lost Child is the fourth volume of the bestselling saga Neapolitan Novels, which tells the story of a lifelong friendship between two women with unmatched honesty and brilliance, against the backdrop of a Naples that is as seductive as it is perilous and a world undergoing epochal change. This exotic story has also struck a chord with Chinese readers.\n\n23. The Story of a New Name\n\nAuthor: Elena Ferrante\n\nCountry: Italy\n\nPublication: 2012\n\nThe Story of a New Name is the second book in the epic New York Times-bestselling literary quartet that has inspired an HBO series. With these books, which the New Yorker’s James Wood described as “large, captivating, amiably peopled ... a beautiful and delicate tale of confluence and reversal,” Ferrante has created a world in which readers will recognize themselves and has drawn a marvelously nuanced portrait of friendship.\n\n24. Merits and Demerits of Political Systems in Dynastic China（中国历代政治得失）\n\nAuthor: Qian Mu（钱穆）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1955\n\nWith broad strokes, this booklet illustrates how each Chinese imperial dynasty seeks to learn from the successes and failures of the past as they chart their way forward. Collectively, these lessons formed China’s political traditions and system.\n\nCombining historical facts and anecdotes from history to make the discussion straightforward, interesting, and easy to understand, this is an ideal book for beginners in Chinese history and the political system. The author was a Chinese historian, philosopher, and writer. He is considered to be one of the greatest historians and philosophers of 20th-century China.\n\n25. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\n\nAuthor: Yuval Noah Harari\n\nCountry: Israel\n\nPublication: 2011\n\nIn Sapiens, Dr. Yuval Noah Harari spans the whole of human history, from the very first humans to walk the earth to the radical – and sometimes devastating – breakthroughs of the Cognitive, Agricultural and Scientific Revolutions.\n\nThis international bestseller explores the ways in which biology and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” The book is also widely read in China.\n\n26. Ordinary World（平凡的世界）\n\nAuthor: Lu Yao（路遥）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1986\n\nOrdinary World tells the story of the impoverished family of Sun, which struggle to make a living in the years after the founding of the PRC.\n\nWriting from his first-hand observation and experience, Lu Yao accurately portrays the lives of farmers in Shaanxi.\n\nIn 1991, this masterpiece won the Mao Dun Literature Prize with an honor “a bright pearl of the Mao Dun Literature Prize crown.”\n\nInterestingly, Lu Yao’s village of Guo Jia Gou is only about 10 km from Liang Jia He, the village Xi Jinping worked in between 1969 and 1975. That was the time when Lu Yao first began to write, publishing essays in local publications. Xi later told an interviewer that he bonded with Lu Yao during his years in Shaanxi as the two shared an interest in literature.\n\n27. Fortress Besieged（围城）\n\nAuthor: Qian Zhongshu（钱钟书）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1947\n\nFortress Besieged written by Qian Zhongshu is a masterpiece of parodic fiction about middle-class Chinese society in the late 1930s. The novel also discussed topics such as identity, women, marriage, education, and middle-class snobbery during the Chinese Republic period.\n\nIn this book, Qian reflected on “harmony without uniformity” in Sino-Western intercultural dialogue by incorporating cultural relativism and the principle of “diversity”.\n\nThe literary critic C.T. Hsia has called Fortress Besieged, “the most delightful and carefully wrought novel in modern Chinese literature” and “perhaps ... the greatest.”\n\nThe book’s title has become somewhat of a euphemism for marriage, as the book describes it as “those on the outside want in while those on the inside want out.”\n\n28. The Smiling, Proud Wanderer（笑傲江湖）\n\nAuthor: Jin Yong/Louis Cha（金庸）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1967\n\nThis work is another famous wuxia novel by Louis Cha. Unlike his other works, this novel purposefully omits the historic era of the setting, instead directing attention to the political struggle between the sects and characters. Jin Yong mentions that The Smiling, Proud Wanderer can be read as a political allegory disguised as a wuxia novel, which can happen in “any dynasty or organization.”\n\n29. From the Soil: The Foundations of Chinese Society（乡土中国）\n\nAuthor: Fei Xiaotong（费孝通）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1947\n\nThis classic text by Fei Xiaotong, China’s finest social scientist, is Fei’s chief theoretical statement about the distinctive characteristics of Chinese society. From a Chinese point of view, From the Soil describes the contrasting organizational principles of Chinese and Western societies, thereby conveying the essential features of both. Fei shows how these unique features reflect and are reflected in the moral and ethical characters of people in these societies. This profound, challenging book is both succinct and accessible.\n\n30. Wild Grass（野草）\n\nAuthor: Lu Xun（鲁迅）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1924-1926\n\nWild Grass is a collection of twenty-three prose poems written by Lu Xun. The poems, written between 1924 and 1926, record the social conditions under the rule of the Beiyang government. It also reflects the author’s loneliness during the New Culture Movement. It shows the author’s appeal to revolutionary forces, the deep sympathy for the working class, and the profound analysis of the Chinese people’s character.\n\n31. Love in the Time of Cholera\n\nAuthor: Gabriel García Márquez\n\nCountry: Colombia\n\nPublication: 1988\n\nUndoubtedly this masterpiece’s readership saw a big bump after the Covid outbreak.\n\n32. White Deer Plain（白鹿原）\n\nAuthor: Chen Zhongshi（陈忠实）\n\nCountry: China\n\nPublication: 1992\n\nWhite Deer Plain is the story of two landowner families, Bai and Lu, over half a century and three generations, in a rural area called White Deer Plain, in Shaanxi. The story starts around 1900 and ends in the 1950s, the early years of the PRC. The characters witness all the major events that took place during that period of Chinese history, from the Revolution of 1911 to the founding of the PRC.\n\nIn the epigraph to the book, Chen quotes Balzac, who believed that “the novel is no less than the secret history of nations.”\n\nFirst published in 1993, it was the winner of the 1997 Mao Dun Literature Prize, the highest literature prize for novelists in China, and was adapted into a popular film in 2011.\n\n33. Murder on the Orient Express\n\nAuthor: Agatha Christie\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1934\n\nI distinctively remember reading this novel at a young age and marveled at the idea of international travel on a luxurious train. I didn’t know that passenger trains could be so luxurious, or that it can cross continents, but after reading the novel I learned that they could be deadly.\n\n34. Different Seasons\n\nAuthor: Stephen King\n\nCountry: United States\n\nPublication: 1982\n\nThe popularity of Shawshank Redemption likely has led to the wide recognition of these novellas.\n\n35. The Count of Monte Cristo\n\nAuthor: Alexandre Dumas (père)\n\nCountry: France\n\nPublication: 1943\n\nThe first of the more western literary classics on this list.\n\n36. Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China\n\nAuthor: Ezra F. Vogel（傅高义）\n\nCountry: United States\n\nPublication: 1976\n\nMuch of China’s wealth today is owed to Deng Xiaoping and his Reform and Opening-up Policy. This is one of the best works chronicling his life.\n\n37. The Moon and Sixpence\n\nAuthor: W. Somerset Maugham\n\nCountry: United Kingdom\n\nPublication: 1919\n\nThis book is particularly popular among China’s young generation, who grew up amid China’s economic boom and found themselves often conflict between the pursuit of material wealth and desires of the heart.\n\n38.

The image of the autobiographical essayist, a withdrawn young man sitting alone in a wheelchair somewhere in the park of the Temple of Earth, has impressed many readers. Many critics consider the book one of the best Chinese essays of the 20th century.\n\nThe Temple of Earth is just a block north of the Yonghegong Lama Temple in Central Beijing.\n\n40. 1587, A Year of No Significance: The Ming Dynasty in Decline\n\nAuthor: Ray Huang（黄仁宇）\n\nCountry: United States\n\nPublication: 1981\n\nHistorian Ray Huang’s most famous work, 1587, A Year of No Significance examines how a number of seemingly insignificant events in 1587 might have caused the downfall of the Ming empire.
