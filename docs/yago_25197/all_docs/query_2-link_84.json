        "text": "Despite a considerable body of research focusing on the preservation and promotion of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), the actual impact of ICH on shaping the cultural life of local communities needs further acknowledgement. Since 2004, China has rapidly engaged with ICH and the associated practices stipulated by UNESCO. Based on a critical analysis of two cultural festivals in China, this study illustrates the impact of official heritage discourse on local communities. Heritage policies have adopted a particular understanding of “culture” that certifies and beautifies related cultural practices and products for commercial purposes. However, these processes of cultural reproduction transform community-based leisure activities into tourism consumption for an external public. Such changes legitimize and reinforce social inequalities within state-society relationships. This study contributes to the broader discussion on the “right to heritage” – whose rights and what rights should be considered in the issues that ICH creates as a form of cultural reproduction.\n\nAs one of the most popular tourism destinations of China, the World Heritage Site Old Town of Lijiang has attracted millions of tourists from around the world. The commoditization of local culture and its manifestation in the indigenous religion have emerged to satisfy the demand of its booming mass tourism. Taking three cultural performances as case studies—namely, Naxi Ancient Music, Lijiang Impression, and Naxi Marriage Courtyard—this article aims to explore the influence of globalization and localization on the development of tourism in Lijiang. It examines how these performances are interpreted and transformed into cultural productions by the local tourism market. During this endless flow between the global and the local, cultural performances show the dynamic forms of encounter, combining the homogenization of global capital and the heterogenization of local ethnicity\n\nThis paper explores how the dongba as the ritual practitioner perceives his authenticity during the marriage ceremony in the Naxi Wedding Courtyard in Lijiang, China. Through the dongba’s life story, the paper indicates that, the power of his making judgment is not entirely related to the toured objects, socially constructed reality or the existential feeling, but also has to do with what happens in between. The ritual performance, integrated with the external world, gives rise to the performative experience of the authenticity and offers a deep understanding of the link between memory, habitus and embodied practice. The dynamic process of “becoming” authentic weaves the interaction between the individual agency and the reality.\n\nSince China’s signing of UNESCO’s World Heritage Convention in 1985, cultural heritage in China has become a booming industry and a key area of scholarly investigation. The mainstream literature on China’s heritage and urbanization tends to view heritage as a civilizing agent to regulate and improve the urban population. Drawing on Clifford Geertz’s notion of ‘theatre state’ and through a case study of Jiangmen, this article reconceptualizes China’s urban heritage industry as ‘theatre’. It shifts the focus away from neat political rationalities to messy ‘magical assemblages’, such as dramatic museum representation, monumental architecture and expressive ceremonies, in state-led heritage-making processes. It argues that the Chinese government makes heritage by using not only the means of political rationalities but also, and perhaps more importantly, the power of spectacle, sensation and awe. China’s heritage industry is thus as much ‘a technique of enchantment’ as ‘a technique of go...\n\nThe study investigates heritage practices in a Chinese village, by describing the tensions that have played out among different voices, meanings and understandings centred on the village’s heritage. In the process of heritageisation’, stakeholders that include the state, the local government, the villagers and the principal lineage strive to negotiate different cultural meanings, values and the traditions. Consequently, three different heritage discourses coexist alongside each other in one locality. On the one hand, the ‘authorised heritage discourse’ is taken up by the government to weave and frame a narrative of nation-building around a Memorial Park. On the other hand, the village uses the past to foster local identity of the place in an attempt to attract tourists. For its part, the major lineage in the village uses the ancestral hall to continue the long tradition of remembering their ancestors via worshiping ceremonies. In between are a medley of heritage sites and artefacts existing in a state of flux and struggle over their conservation. The authors contend that, no matter how mundane, grand or hybrid, assemblages of rich and locally meaningful heritage, such as depicted in this article, should be cherished and utilised for the present agenda of cultural construction in rural China.\n\nThis article examines the dynamics of the Feitao ritual, a traditional practice of the Maonan ethnic minority, within the broader context of globalization and heritagization in China. It addresses the challenge of preserving the cultural identity and memory of ethnic minorities amidst economic development imperatives, a dilemma common to many late-developing countries. By focusing on transforming the Feitao ritual from a communal practice to a performative spectacle, this study unravels the intricate process of heritage ecology within minority rituals. Utilizing a combination of ethnological fieldwork and interviews, this article explores the perceptions and approaches toward the post-heritagization of the ritual among the Maonan community members and policymakers. It also emphasizes on the evolution of the ritual into a significant tourist attraction, showcasing the performative transformation of religious practices by an ethnic minority in China. The central argument of this article is that this ritual is formed in ecological interactions; it also symbolizes a self-defense for the rights and a pursuit of recognition for a minority group. It has been a vital medium for the Maonan people to construct and uphold a positive self-perception. This study endorses a faith-aware and community memory-focused approach to preserve the cultural heritage of ethnic minorities. The authors contend that this approach is essential to safeguard the cultural memory and identity of minorities in developing countries like China against the homogenizing forces brought by globalization in China."
