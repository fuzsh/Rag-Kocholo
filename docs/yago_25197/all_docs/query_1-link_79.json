        "text": "Actress Zhang Ziyi (left) and architect-writer Lin Huiyin [CRI]\n\nZhang Ziyi's next character will be Lin Huiyin, the first female architect in modern China, the Qilu Evening News reports.\n\nThe newspaper quoted Dong Zhaohui, whose company, Joy Media, is investing in the film \"Lin Huiyin\", as saying that Zhang has been cast as Lin and filming is scheduled to begin later this year.\n\nLin Huiyin (1904-1955), has been widely adored in China for her beauty and achievements in architecture and literature. She ranked first in a survey last year on modern China's most beautiful women. (Zhang Ziyi is the 12th.) Lin and her husband Liang Sicheng were involved in the design of China's national emblem, as well as the Monument to the People's Heroes that now stands in the heart of Beijing's Tian'anmen Square. Award-winning Chinese-American architect Maya Lin is Huiyin's niece.\n\nOutside of her professional achievements, Lin Huiyin was also known for her friendship with poet Xu Zhimo, who was romantically attracted to Lin.\n\nIn the film, Ethan Ruan (\"Monga\") will play Xu, and Chang Chen (\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\") will play Lin's husband, Liang.\n\nZhang Ziyi is currently working on Gu Changwei's drama \"A Tale of Magic\", in which she plays an AIDS patient."
