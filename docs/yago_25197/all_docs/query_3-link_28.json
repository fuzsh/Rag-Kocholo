Photo: Courtesy of Shanghai Art Collection Museum\n\nBy Huang Xi\n\nEvery so often, a real-life love story captures the imagination, and the story of Lin Huiyin (1904-55) and Liang Sicheng (1901-72) has survived because of the incredible nature of their love and their amazing accomplishments.\n\nAn exhibition at the Shanghai Art Collection Museum, entitled The Tender Month of April, the name of one of Lin's poems, showcases the love and achievements of one of China's most famous couples.\n\nThere are altogether more than 40 exhibits, including calligraphy, manuscripts, paintings and porcelain.\n\nMany of the exhibits were contributed by the families of the couple, but some were donated by Lin Zhu, Liang's second wife. For most of the exhibits, it is the first time they have been displayed.\n\nThe most valuable exhibit in this display is a manuscript of Lin Zhu's book Liang Sicheng, Lin Huiyin and Me, a story of trial and love.\n\n\"There are 16 pages of the manuscript that have never been published, and we have one page on display,\" said Hu Muqing, the director of the museum.\n\nThe manuscript has many details about Lin and Liang which were previously unknown. \"Lin Zhu didn't want to put these in this exhibition to protect the couple's privacy,\" said Hu.\n\n\"But, as a counselor of the museum and to better understand Liang's life, Lin finally agreed to show one page.\"\n\nLiang, an important architect and scholar, dedicated his life to researching ancient architecture and wrote many books and essays on the protection of architectural heritage such as old buildings in Datong, Shanxi Province, the Anji Bridge in Zhao county, Hebei Province, the Wanshou Pavilion on Jingshan Mountain, the Pavilion of the Source of Literature in the Forbidden City and the Confucius Temple in Qufu, Shandong Province.\n\nHe also suggested preserving several buildings in Shanghai, including the Xujiahui Catholic Cathedral, the ancient pagoda in Longhua Temple, the Guyi Garden in Nanxiang Town and the City God Temple.\n\nThanks to Liang's efforts in 1944, Kyoto and Nara, two cities in Japan, escaped bombing from the Americans during World War II.\n\nIn appreciation, Nara will unveil bronze statue of Liang this coming fall to celebrate his 110th birthday.\n\nAn 80-page manuscript of Chinese Sculpture is also on display in the exhibition. \"Liang was not only an architect, but also had a profound understanding of literature, which is rare nowadays,\" said Hu.\n\nLiang's literary achievements are partly due to his father Liang Qichao, a well-known Chinese scholar, philosopher and reformist during the Qing Dynasty (1644â1911), and partly from his wife Lin Huiyin.\n\nLin, was born in Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province, moved to Shanghai at 8 and was considered the most beautiful writer and architect in China.\n\nShe wrote many poems, essays, short stories and plays. \"With intelligence and enchanting beauty, she was the envy of every woman of her time,\" said Li Jianwu, a celebrated Chinese writer.\n\nÂ\n\nA copy of the national emblem of China designed by Lin and Liang. Photo: Courtesy of Shanghai Art Collection Museum\n\nHer love life also made her famous, beloved by three men: Liang, Xu Zhimo, a famous romantic poet, and Jin Yuelin, an important logician and philosopher.\n\nLin and Liang married in 1928 and were given a great many gifts.\n\nYu Shaosong, a scholar and close friend, made four works of calligraphy for the couple entitled Wishing Your Love Lives Longer than the Rock of Thousands of Years, which is also on display at the exhibition.\n\nOne of the most impressive and long-lasting accomplishments Liang and Lin created was the national emblem of China in 1950.\n\nThey researched, discussed and drafted the design which was eventually presented in the second session of the first CPPCC conference, where it was approved.\n\nLin died in 1955 and Liang married Lin Zhu in 1962. Hu said the city is planning to build a museum commemorating Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng.\n\n\"I believe that the museum will provide a whole new view of their achievements and their love story for younger generations,\" said Hu.\n\nDate: Until July 26, 9 am to 5 pm\n\nVenue: Shanghai Art Collection Museum\n\nÃ¤Â¸Å Ã¦ÂµÂ·Ã¨â°ÂºÃ¦ÅÂ¯Ã§Â¤Â¼Ã¥\"ÂÃ¥ÂÅ¡Ã§â°Â©Ã©Â¦â\n\nAddress: 555 Gubei Road Ã¥ÂÂ¤Ã¥ÅâÃ¨Â·Â¯555Ã¥ÂÂ·\n\nAdmission: 20 yuan\n\nCall 5206-7259 for details"
