The following discussion will focus on the art-song setting of 1936 by Weining Lee 李惟寧. For details on the poem, please refer to: goldfishodyssey.com/2022/01/04/chinese-poetry-xvii-chance-encounter-偶然/\n\n__ Lee Weining李惟寧 (1906-1985)[2]\n\nLee Weining 李惟寧 was born into a prominent family in Ningyuan Prefecture 寧遠府 of Sichuan Province.[3] In the early 1920, he entered Tsinghua College, a program funded with Boxer Indemnity Scholarship, preparing students for overseas study in the United States.[4] Instead of focusing on his academic works, Lee was attracted to the music activities around him. He learned to play to the violin, trumpet, trombone and French horn, and began taking piano lessons. His poor attendance and failing grades eventually led to his expulsion from the school in 1928. Briefly, while making a living by teaching English and piano, he became active in local musical groups and appeared in performances—partially to raise fund for studying abroad.\n\nLee won the Sino-French Cultural Foundation Scholarship and obtained a tuition waiver at Schola Cantorium in Paris. For two years (1930?-1931), he studied Piano under Léon Kartun, and Lazare Levy; counterpoint under Bertlin; and composition under Vincent d’Indy.[5] After the death of d’Indy, he left for Vienna. There, he attended the Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst, studying composition with Franz Schmidt and Joseph Marx. After Marx’s retirement, he studied counterpoint and compositions with Karl Weigl and took private piano lessons from Frau Prof. Leonie Gombrich.\n\nIn 1933, Lee passed the Staatsprüfung (State Exam) with honor and married Elisabeth Heinrich on June 11.[6] He began working at the Konsularakademie. On July 16, 1934, eight compositions of his were broadcast on Radio-Verkehrs AG (RAVAG). The performers were Erika Rokyta, soprano; Bertha Jahn-Beer, piano solo; and the composer also at the piano.[7]\n\nAn article in the July 13 issue of Radio-Wien introduced Lee as a young Chinese composer from an illustrated literary family in a province near the headwater of the Yangtze River. It explained how his years in Tsinghua, though led to conflicts between him and his father, paved the way for his musical life. While accredited his mentors, the author also praised Lee for his ability to acculture to the essence of European music in his compositions.[8]\n\nA detailed playlist was provided in the same issue of the weekly, translated and amended here in English:[9]\n\n__Part 1:\n\na) “Chance Encounter,” Xu Zhimo;\n\nb) “Laments in Exile,” Li Yu;\n\nc) “The Crane,” [Su Shi]\n\n(Rokyta)\n\n“Variations and Fugue on an Original Theme” for piano\n\n(Bertha Jahn-Beer)\n\n__Part 2:\n\na) “Song of the Fisher Boy,” Schiller, [Chinese translation by] Guo Moro;\n\nb) “Deep Night,” Lee Wei’e\n\nc) “The Fisherman,” Zhang Zhihe\n\nd) “Parables of the Pond,” Bai Letian[10]\n\n(Rokyta)\n\nSix of the seven songs included in Lee’s solo collection Du chang ge ji 獨唱歌集 of 1937 appeared in this playlist. The last piece “Chi sheng yu xing 池上寓興” [Parables of the Pond] later became a four-part chorus work.[11]\n\nThe reviewer at Der Wiener Tag gave high praise to the only instrumental piece—the “Variations and Fuge”—on the program: “. . . one would not sense at all that it was a foreigner at work here. This keyboard piece was fully tailored to the emotional capacity of the instrument. The delicate, transparent keyboard work that Lee wrote, reminds one of his models such as François Couperin and d’Indy, to which romantic piano works of Schubert, Mendelssohn und Schumann should also be added.” The same reviewer also commented on the inner European spirit of Lee’s vocal works underneath a folk-song-like appearance.[12]\n\nLee Weining chose Guo Moro’s translation of Friedrich Schiller’s Wilhelm Tell as his source of lyrics.[13] In his 1981 article, “Im Reich der Töne fließen Jangtse und Donau zusammen” (In the Realm of Sounds, Yangtze and Donau Flowing Together), Liao Naixiong 廖乃雄 compared Lee’s “Lied des Fischerknaben” with the reverse efforts, translating Chinese verses into German lyrics, in Gustav Mahler’s Das Lied von der Erde, Ernst Tochs’ Chinesische Flöte, and Anton Webern’s “Die geheimnisvolle Flöte.”[14]\n\nHaving achieved a certain level of success in assimilating to European culture and life in the early 1930s, Lee returned to China in autumn of 1934. He taught piano and theory briefly at the Central University of Nanking, then joined the faculty of the National Conservatory of Music, Shanghai in October of 1935. After the death of Xiao Yomei in January of 1941, Lee became the interim Director. When Wang Jingwei’s puppet state of the Japanese occupiers (汪精衛偽政府) took over the Conservatory in June of 1942, Lee was appointed the Director.[15]\n\nIn addition to teaching theory, composition, and piano after returning to China, Lee Weining should be credited to introducing Western repertoire to the Chinese audience as a solo pianist, an administrator, and a conductor. To fully appreciate the significance of his activities, one must first understand the cultural and social divisions between Westerners and natives in Shanghai in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nUnder unequal treaties, sections of Shanghai became foreign concessions. In 1854, a group of businessmen founded “Shanghai Municipal Council 工部局”—a self-governing body—to manage the daily function within the confines of the International Settlement.[16] While the Westerners benefited from the extraterritorial rights, Chinese locals were prevented from entering public venues and, consequentially, attending public events.\n\nIn 1879, the “Shanghai Public Band 工部局樂隊” was formed to provide entertainment and ceremonial music for audience from the concessions. In 1922, the band was renamed “Shanghai Municipal Orchestra.”[17] Under the increasing public pressure, the SMO finally opened its door to the Chinese community in 1925. Two years later, Tan Shuzhen 譚抒真, a violinist, became the first Chinese musician in the orchestra.[18] In 1930, SMO performed the work of a Chinese composer—In Memoriam by Huang Zi—for the first time.[19]\n\nThroughout the 1930s, the involvement of Chinese musicians in SMO grew gradually. Huang Zi was invited to join the Orchestra and Band Committee of the Municipal Council in 1931. After his death, Lee Weining served as a committee member from 1938 to 1942. Beginning with the appearance of Ma Sicong 馬思聰, a 17-year-old violinist, in 1929, Chinese soloists, both instrumentalists and vocalists, were featured in the SMO concerts.[20] On February 21, 1937, Lee Weining performed Mozart, D minor Piano Concerto (K. 466) using his own cadenza in the third movement. Also included in the same program were “Overture” to Marriage of Figaro, Cello Concerto by Luigi Boccherini, and the New World Symphony by Dvorak.[21] By its programming of standard Western repertoire, the SMO concerts inspired many young musicians and stimulated the development of modern Chinese music.[22]\n\nLee’s brief biography in the Curriculum Catalogue of Boston Conservatory of Music indicated that he “organized and conducted [the] first Symphony Orchestra in Shanghai.” This “first Symphony Orchestra” in the statement was not SMO. Instead, it was an all-Chinese orchestra, Shanghai Orchestra 上海管弦樂團, founded by Huang Zi and Tan Xiaolin 譚小麟 on November 1, 1935. Wu Bochao 吳伯超 and Lee Weining were named the chief and deputy conductors.\n\nOn May 15, 1937, Lee conducted Shanghai Orchestra’s first public performance at Ba Xian Qiao YMCA 八仙橋青年會.[23] In addition to works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and Mendelssohn, the program also included two songs— “Yi wangmu憶亡母” [Remembering late mother] by Lee and “Ständchen” by Schubert—sung by bass baritone Yi-Kwei Sze 斯藝桂.[24] The performance seemed to have been well-received.[25]\n\nBetween April and May of 1937, three of Lee’s vocal collections were published as part of the National Music Academy Series by the Commercial Press: Shuqing Hechangqu 抒情合唱曲 contains lyrical choral works with traditional texts. Du chang ge ji 獨唱歌集 was his first solo collection of seven pieces. Aiquo Geji: Junge 愛國歌集: 軍歌 were patriotic and military songs. In June the same year, Lee orchestrated the Nationalist Party Song, recently adopted as the National Anthem.\n\nActing against the Zeitgeist and the spirit of his patriotic compositions, Lee Weining remained in Shanghai after the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out and collaborated with the Japanese occupiers. As the war ended, he was removed from his administrative position at the Conservatory in 1946 but continued teaching there for another year. He moved to the United States in 1947 and taught at Boston Conservatory of Music until his retirement in 1976.\n\nPublicity materials of various events indicated that Lee Weining began writing piano works before studying abroad.[26] It was also clear that he had written chamber music as well as orchestral works. Unlike his songs and choral compositions, which were preserved and appeared in concerts, his instrumental works—most of them well-received by critics—seemed to have been lost. His avid creative works as a composer and performer ended abruptly with his move to America.\n\n— “Ou ran”\n\nLee Weining’s setting of Xu Zhimo’s most beloved work was believed to have been set almost immediately after the publication of the poem in May of 1926. The source of this date seemed to have been an anecdotal account in Xishu Changge Xing 西蜀長歌行 by Guo Hongqiao 顧鴻喬.[27] Lee was twenty years old and enrolled at Qinghua in 1926. As enthusiastic as he was about learning western music, he might not have acquired the skills needed to compose an art song.\n\n“Ou-ran 偶然” was the last of the forty songs in Volume 2 of Centennial Chinese Art Song Collection (2020), published by Shanghai Conservatory Press.[28] There, 1936 was listed as the compositional date. Nonetheless, since the song was included in Lee’s 1934 RAVAG recital, it would have been written prior to July 1934.\n\nCorresponding to the contemporary nature of the poem, Lee utilized western tonality and style for his setting. The song is in simple ternary form with a brief piano introduction. The text is set syllabically throughout. The opening motive first appears in the bass line of the introduction. The first stanza is set in E-flat major with smoothly arpeggiated accompaniment.\n\nIn the second section, quick triplets in the vocal part and the repeating chords in the piano part invoke a sense of uneasiness which is enhanced by the C-minor tonality. The third section is a complete recapitulation of the first.\n\nLee drew upon a few musical gestures to enhance the emotions of the words. In mm. 9 and 10, there is a juxtaposition of E-flat major and C minor to highlight verses 3 and 4—”你不必訝異, 更無需歡心 You need not be surprised, nor should you be overjoyed.” The so-far smooth vocal line is interrupted by grace notes, chromatic steps, large interval, portamenti and widened range. The excitement is, nevertheless, short-lived.\n\nThe musical reaches a climax in m. 17 with a g2 in the voice. The text reads: “你記得也好, . . . It’s fine, should you remember. . ..” Then, as the lyrics makes a dramatic turn at “最好你忘掉, Better that you forget,” the vocal line stops abruptly. The piano, with accented chords, repeats the last three notes/words. The second section ends with a cadence in the dominant B-flat major, giving way to the reiteration of the first stanza.\n\nLee Weining’s “Ou ran” is uncomplicated yet not oversimplified. The singer needs to find the right tempo which allows clear and smooth delivery of the word. The occasional leaps in the vocal line should sound effortless. The pianist should pay attention to the counter-melody in the bass line which pairs with the voice throughout the piece. The key musical moments in each section will require the collaboration of both performers.\n\n[1] The literary pronunciation [ㄉㄧˋ, di4] is applied here for the word 的. To maintain the vernacular style of the poem, it should be sung naturally without strenuousness.\n\n[2] In western documents, Lee’s given name is sometimes hyphenated (Wei-Ning) or with two separated syllables without hyphenation (Wei Ning). His family name appears both as “Li” and/or “Lee.”\n\nLee’s grandfather Lee Liyuan 李立元 was the minister of Ningyuan Prefecture at the time of his birth.\n\n[3] Geni, a genealogical site, listed Chengdu, Sichuan as his birthplace.\n\nhttps://www.geni.com/people/Lee-Wei-Ning/6000000010110054635\n\n[4]. Exact dates of Lee’s activities and works varied from source to source.

Eric Gombrich provided the German translation of the Chinese lyrics.\n\n[10] A direct translation of the German title “Die Parabel vom See“ should have been “The Parable of the Lake.” Nevertheless, 池上 [chi shang] in the original Chinese title means “on the pond.”\n\n[11] The seventh work in Lee’s 1937 collection was “Nian shanzhong ke 念山中客” [Thinking of a friend who lives in the mountains] with words by Wei Yingwu 韋應物 of the Tang Dynasty.\n\n[12] Der Wiener Tag, July 17, 1934, page 8:\n\n„Gestern im Radio/Kompositionestunde Lee-Wei-Ning“\n\nEin junger Chinesischer Komponist, Herr Lee-Wei-Ning, Stipendist der „Schola cantorum“ in Paris und Schüler von Vincent d‘Indy, Joseph Marx und Karl Weigl, kam gestern im Radio mit eigenen Werken zu Wort. Tiefe Proben seines Schaffens, ein Variationen wert für Klavier und eine Reihe Lieder, zeugten von der großen Einfühlungsgabe der heutigen Chinesen in die abendländische Musik.\n\nBei den von Berta Jahn-Beer virtuos gespielten „Variationen und Fuge über ein eigenes Thema“ hat man überhaupt nicht des Gefühl, daß ein exotischer Fremdling hier am Werke war. Der Klaviersatz ist ganz den Ausdrucksmöglichkeiten des Instruments angepaßt. Der locker, durchsichtige Klaviersatz, den Lee-Wei-Ning schreibt, erinnert an Vorbilder wie François Couperin und d‘Indy, denen aber auch die romantischen Klavierstücke von Schubert, Mendelssohn und Schumann hinzuzuzählen sein dürften.\n\nStärker bricht das exotische Empfinden in den von tiefem Ausdruck erfüllten Liedern durch, die Erika Rokyta sang. Hier begegnen wir einem eigentümlichen Nebeneinander von freien Rhapsodischen, fast möchte man sagen: rezitativischen Wendungen, ariosen Clementen, imitatorisch gehaltenen Partien und—so merkwürdig es fliegen mag—einem volksliedartigen Einschlag in europäischem Sinne. Lästerer trat sehr auffällig in der „Parabel vom See“ nach Worten von Pe-Lo-Tien hervor.\n\n[13] Lee was not the first composer to set a translated text.

In winter of 1930, Hu Shi invited Xu to teach at Beijing University as well as the Women’s College. Xu’s letters to Hu dated January 28, and February 7, 1931, revealed his desire to move away from Shanghai not only for financial reasons but also for a personal and professional reboot. However, the complications of making such a move, including consents from his parents, caused him to hesitate. On February 9, he finalized the decision to accept the positions.[2]\n\nSince Lu insisted on remaining in Shanghai, Xu became a frequent traveler between the two cities. While considering the job offer, Xu politely asked to board with Hu’s family at their new residence, 4 Miliangku Hutong (米糧庫衚衕四號).[3] Blocks away from the northern border of the Forbidden City, the alley, with its influential residents, was a gathering place for elites in the 1930s. In his letter to Lu on February 24, Xu described the comfortable setup of the guestroom on the second floor with gas heat and a bathroom nearby:[4]\n\n眉：前一天信諒到, 我已安到北平… 胡家一切都已替我預備好. 我的房間在樓上, 一大間, 後面是祖望的房, 再過去是澡室, 房間里有汽爐舒適的很.\n\nA courtyard lined with pines, separating Hu’s western-styled, multi-story house from the street and its clamors, was the backdrop of this poem. Without mentioning her name, Xu expressed his affections and concerns for Lin Huiyin 林徽因 who was convalescing from tuberculosis at Shuangqing Villa 雙清別墅 on Xiangshan 香山 (Fragrant Hill).[5]\n\nHaving completed her studies in America, Lin Huiyin returned to China with her newly wedded husband Liang Sicheng 梁思成 in 1928. Together, they founded the Department of Architecture at Northeastern University in Shenyang. In autumn of 1930, Xu visited them and found Lin in poor health. He persuaded her to go to Beijing for medical treatment. Soon, due to the severity of her condition, the doctors ordered her to receive care at a sanatorium. In March of 1931, Lin moved into Shuangqing Villa for a six-months seclusion with limited visitation.\n\nIn the opening stanza, we found the poet, alone in the courtyard, immersed in total silence. Born into wealth, he was experiencing serious financial difficulties—his silk garments, one torn and one burned (cigarette?), had to be mended by his hostess.[6] The heavy teaching load—new courses at two colleges—was physically demanding. This moment of peacefulness must have brought him much needed clarity and inspiration.\n\nThe moonlight, the breeze and the shifting shadows of the pines transported his thoughts to another place of similar scenery where someone he cared about deeply might be resting peacefully. He wished to be by her side yet not to disturb her—like a breeze patting her windows with pine needles.\n\nStructurally, this poem is clearly defined with four sets of quatrains of 5-6-5-6 word counts. The rhyme scheme is ABAB, except for the odd-number lines in the third stanza. The final [ŋ/ㄥ] is used heavily in the rhymes. Technically, it involves all three disciplines in Shijing [Classic of Poetry]: 賦 fù—description—in the first stanza; 比 bi—comparison, the second; 興 xing—association, the later and more personal stanzas.[7] Instead of narrating the story, interpreters should seek to deliver the sincerity and intimacy reflected in the words.\n\n__Chen Tianhe 陳田鶴 (1911-1955)\n\nChen Tianhe, birth name Qidong 啓東, was from Wenzhou 溫州 of Zhenjiang Province. His father’s surname was Zhan 詹. His mother passed away when he was nine years old. Raised by his grandparents on his mother’s side, he also took up their family name Chen 陳. He showed great interest in literature, fine arts and music from an early age. Although the family was poor, they provided him with the best education possible.\n\nIn 1928, he entered newly established Wenzhou Arts Professional School 溫州藝術專業學校, majoring in Chinese painting. Soon, he changed his focus to music under the tutelage of Miao Tianrui 繆天瑞, another Wenzhou native and one of the founders of the school.\n\nAs the school closed due to lack of funding, he transferred to Shanghai Fine Arts School 上海美術專科學校 in the following year. While there, he became friends with Li Zhongchao 李仲超. Their participation in a student protest which turned into physical clashes with the authorities led to their expulsion from the school. They were also prohibited from attending any other school in the area. To overcome such obstacles, they changed their names—Li Zhongchoa became Jiang Dingshan 江定山; Chen Qidong, Tianhe, and were accepted at the Shanghai National Conservatory of Music. They studied theory with Xiao Youmei and composition with Huang Zi.\n\nEven though his study at the conservatory was intermittent,[8] he was the first to publish his compositions and essays among the so-called “four great disciples” of Huang Zi.[9] His early works appeared in periodicals, such as Yueyi 樂藝, Music Education (monthly)[10] and Music Magazine (quarterly). Several songs were included in Fuxing Chuji Zhongxue Jiaokeshu 復興初級中學音樂教科書.[11] In February of 1937, his first song collection Huiyi ji 回憶集 [nostalgia collection] was released in Shanghai.[12]\n\nFrom August of 1936 to September of 1937, Chen worked at Provincial Theater of Shandong in Jinan 濟南. While there, he collaborated with Wang Bosheng 王泊生, a Chinese opera singer and the leader of the “new opera” movement,[13] on Yuefei 岳飛, a large stage production of 7 acts and 12 scenes, integrating traditional theater, songs, and dance with mixed instrumentation.[14] He also composed a four-act opera Jingke 荆軻 with libretto by Wang.[15] It was structured in the western style with prelude, interlude, arias, vocal ensembles, and chorus. These experiences prepared him for his large scale works in later years.\n\nA true patriot, Chen devoted his efforts on anti-Japanese activism during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In late 1937, he gave up his work in Shandong and returned to Shanghai. He and several colleagues cofounded “Chinese Composers Association 中國作曲者協會,” publishing Zhange 戰歌 [war song] weekly. When Japanese military occupied the Chinese-controlled areas of the city, he relocated to the war-time capital Chongqing.[16] He administered training courses for music educators; edited teaching materials; and continued to write and compose—mostly patriotic songs. Works in his second song collection Jiansheng ji 劍聲集 [sounds-of-sword collection] (1943) reflected his focus of this period.[17]\n\nChen contributed greatly to the development of cantatas in modern China. As he fled the Japanese-controlled Shanghai, he safeguarded the manuscript of Huang Zi’s cantata Changhen ge 長恨歌 [Song of perpetual longing]—a dramatic depiction of the love story between Emperor Tang Xuanzhong 唐玄宗 and his concubine Yang Yuhuan 楊玉環, drawing inspiration from Bai Juyi’s epic poem of the same name.[18] While in Chongqing, Chen wrote Heliang huabie 河梁話別 (1943), a cantata based on the misadventure of Su Wu 蘇武 (Western Han Dynasty, c. 140 BC-60 BC)—his diplomatic expedition to Xiongnu, exile, and his unyielding loyalty to the court.[19]\n\nIn 1935, Huang Zi composed Fantasy of City Scenes 都市風光幻想曲 for the title sequence of Scenes of City Life 都市風光.[20] It was the first professionally written film score by a Chinese composer. Following in his mentor’s footsteps, Chen also wrote theme songs for several movies, mostly in art-song style with piano accompaniment. They became the pioneers of Chinese film composers.\n\nChen turned to teaching, collecting folk music, and score arrangements in the later years. From 1940 to 1945, he held teaching position at Qingmuguan National Music Conservatory 青木關國立音樂院. His piano accompaniments helped to popularize Man jian hong 滿江紅—a traditional tune with ci lyrics attributed to Yue Fei, and Zai na yaoyuan de difang 在那遙遠的地方 [in the faraway land]—a Tibetan folk song. In December 1949, he produced a piano reduction of the Yellow River Cantata黃河大合唱 by Xian Xinghai 冼星海 for students at Fujian Music Professional School 福建音樂專科學校. In 1951, he became of a member of the music composition team at the Beijing People’s Art Theater 北京人民藝術劇院. His assignments, however, were mostly orchestration and arrangements.\n\nIn 1953, Chen and his colleagues were sent to Yicun 伊春 in the forest of Lesser Khingan 小興安嶺, Heilongjiang Province 黑龍江省 for ideological reform. He wrote his last composition “Senlin ah! Lüse de haiyang 森林啊！綠色的海洋” [Ah forests! green ocean], a chorus work with lyrics by Jin Fan 金帆 depicting the scenery of the region. In declining health, he died of a heart attack in 1955.\n\n__ “Shan Zhong,” Chen Tianhe’s setting (1934)\n\nChen Tianhe’s setting of Xu’s words first appeared in the inaugural issue of Music Magazine (Shanghai, January 1934). The clearly defined musical sections are in accordance with the poetic structure.\n\nThe first section, marked Andante molto cantabile, opens in A-flat major. The two-bar motif which weaves through the piece like a needle first appears in the lower voice of the piano introduction and, immediately, the opening vocal line. Since its appearances almost always link to the images of pine, it is appropriate to call it the “pine” motif:\n\nA variation of this motif became the counter melody, paring with the voices until measure 10, corresponding to the end of the first stanza.\n\nThe first musical phrase ends with a half cadence in m. 6. The second one ends in m. 10, again on e-flat, however, fully cadenced.\n\nAs a change of thoughts, in the same measure, with a d-flat bass note, the music turns right back to A-flat major. The movements in the piano accompaniment intensify slightly in mm. 11-14, only to return to the calmness of the opening duet. The second stanza of the poem concluded in the original key quietly—”with profound silence.”\n\nTo reflect the fantastic transformation of the poet’s thoughts in the third stanza, the pace of the music increases. After a quick hint of D-flat major in mm. 19-20, the tonality shifts to its parallel C-sharp minor. Quick and light arpeggios in the piano part emulate the gentle breeze, flowing freely. Large leaps and chromatic movements in the vocal part throughout the section reveal the hidden emotions in the words.\n\nThe “pine” motif in the piano part in mm. 30-31 brings back the calmness of the opening section. A slightly-extended version of the motif, gently exchanged between the voice and the piano, concludes the final stanza of the poem.\n\n“Shan Zhong” is a carefully designed work, organized in its structure and imaginary in its details. It is full of Chinese characters without intentionally “being Chinese.” For singers, the primary technical challenge is to carry out smooth phrases. In the middle—Allegretto—section, the voice must be well-balanced between registers. The pianist must take on the role of an intimate partner, threading through all the emotional changes and be sensitive to all the symbolic features. Whether the repeating chords in the opening section or the flowing arpeggios in the middle, all the technical issues must be skillfully handled. The utmost important task for both performers is to deliver the emotional vulnerability sincerely.\n\n[1] For biographical details of Xu Zhimo: goldfishodyssey.com_chinese-poetry-xvii-chance-encounter-偶然\n\n[2] Xu Zhimo Quanji 徐志摩全集 [The complete works of Xu Zhimo], ed.

The titles of individual movements were taken from Bai Juyi’s poem. The work consisted of ten movements. The fourth, seventh, and nineth movements were incomplete at the time of Huang Zi’s death. Lin Shengxi 林聲翕, Huang’s pupil, completed and edited the work with Wei in 1972.\n\n[19] In the Preface to Heliang huabie 河梁話別, Lu Qian 盧前, the librettist, detailed his early encounter and collaboration with Chen Tianhe, his colleagues at the Music Educators Training Course 音樂師資訓練班 in Shapingba 沙坪壩 in 1939. Chen admired Lu’s lyrics and encouraged him to write a long-form cantata [康達達]. Inspired by Su Wu’s biology in Hanshu 漢書, he completed the libretto in ten days. Although the scores of a few individual movements were in circulation, the completion of the entire work came much later in autumn of 1943. It was published by Yongkui Music Printing Press 詠葵樂譜刊印社 in January 1946 in Chengdu 成都.\n\ncommons.wikimedia.org_河梁話別_清唱劇.pdf\n\n[20] Youtube_Huang-Zi-Fantasia of City Scenes"
