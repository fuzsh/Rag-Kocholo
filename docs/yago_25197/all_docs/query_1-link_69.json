        "text": "Lin Huiyin, 1904-1955 (Unknown author/Wikimedia Commons/Public Domain)\n\nMike Fu’s Note: I find myself drawn to Chinese writers situated at the interstices of history, culture, and language, and whose literary works demonstrate a hybrid subjectivity, whether overt or implicit. Lin Huiyin came of age in the period following the May Fourth Movement of 1919, which revolutionised and vernacularised Chinese literature and profoundly influenced the culture and society of the Republic of China. Her upbringing and education in the anglophone world, as well as her ties to the ill-fated poet Xu Zhimo and passionate architect Liang Sicheng, provide another frame of reference for her literary style.\n\n“You Are an April Day Incarnate” is one of Lin’s most famous works. Both this poem and “After the Rain” deploy uneven end rhymes and rhythmic repetition. Lin’s evocations of the natural world are a sublimation of her emotional landscape and interiority, in the spirit of the English Romantics. I strive to capture the essence of her words by establishing a deliberate diction and cadence in English, even when it means deviating slightly from a literal translation.\n\nFor instance, the first and last lines of “You Are an April Day Incarnate” are essentially identical in Chinese, but I offer two separate renditions of the same phrase to more elegantly open and close the framework of the poem in English. In the same vein, I have elided the repetition of the last two characters in “After the Rain” in favour of presenting a fragment, which I believe functionally conveys the same decisiveness of the original text. I also play with definite and indefinite particles in the limited space of this poem to create a whimsical texture and tone. These and other choices represent my highly personal interpretation of Lin’s writing and the modern subjectivity that she embodied and performed.\n\nYOU ARE AN APRIL DAY INCARNATE\n\n你是人間的四月天\n\nI say, you are an April day incarnate,\n\nYour laughter casts brightness to the wind;\n\nAnd to the light of spring, twirling ardent.\n\nYou are the soft clouds of an April morn,\n\nTwilight’s tender breeze,\n\nThe stars’ twinkling ease,\n\nUpon flowers a gentle rainstorm.\n\nThat lightness, that charm, you are,\n\nOf flowers you wear a glorious crown,\n\nYou are innocent and profound,\n\nThe moon in the night sky unbound.\n\nLike golden earth beneath snowmelt\n\nAnd freshly sprouted green, you are,\n\nA tender and joyful plume,\n\nWhite lotuses drifting through dreams.\n\nYou are bloom after bloom,\n\nSongbirds twittering in roof beams.\n\n—You are love, warmth, and hope unfurled,\n\nYou are an April day in this world!\n\n你是人間的四月天\n\n我說你是人間的四月天\n\n笑響點亮了四面風;\n\n輕靈在春的光豔中交舞著變。\n\n你是四月早天里的雲煙，\n\n黃昏吹着風的軟，\n\n星子在無意中閃，\n\n細雨點灑在花前。\n\n那輕，那娉婷，你是，\n\n鮮妍百花的冠冕你戴著，\n\n你是天真，莊嚴，\n\n你是夜夜的月圆。\n\n雪化後那片鵝黃，你像;\n\n新鮮初放芽的綠，你是;\n\n柔嫩喜悅，\n\n水光浮動著你夢期待中白蓮。\n\n你是一樹一樹的花開，\n\n是燕在梁間呢喃，\n\n——你是愛，是暖，是希望，\n\n你是人間的四月天!\n\nAFTER THE RAIN\n\n雨後天\n\nHow lovely the day after the rain,\n\nA swath of lush grass across this plain!\n\nMy heart wafts onward as the wind twirls,\n\nA wind whirls:\n\nWhirling wild grass, leaves crisp,\n\nTwirling a cloud mass into a wisp—\n\nOf smoke.\n\n雨後天\n\n我愛這雨後天，\n\n這平原的青草一片!\n\n我的心没底止的跟著風吹，\n\n風吹:\n\n吹遠了香草，落葉，\n\n吹遠了一縷雲，象煙——\n\n象煙。\n\nHow to cite: Fu, Mike and Lin Huiyin. “Two New Translations of Lin Huiyin.” Cha: An Asian Literary Journal, 27 Jan. 2024, chajournal.blog/2024/01/27/lin-huiyin.\n\nLin Huiyin Portrait. Photograph retrieved from Fujian Daily. Date Unknown.\n\nLin Huiyin (poet; 1904–1955) was a pioneering architect, writer, and historian. Born in Hangzhou, China, she was educated in England and the United States, where she pursued courses in fine arts, architecture, and set design at the University of Pennsylvania and Yale University. Lin was romantically linked to the romantic poet Xu Zhimo before his untimely demise. She married Liang Sicheng, son of a prominent politician, and together they established the first architecture programmes at Chinese universities. She wrote poetry, stories, and essays throughout her life and sought to integrate Chinese aesthetics with modernist techniques. Lin died from tuberculosis in 1955. The Chinese American architect Maya Lin, designer of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is her niece."
