        "text": "In 1932, two young architectural historians, Lin Huiyin (1904–1955) and Liang Sicheng (1901–1972), established an intellectual blueprint that would be a defining moment in the historiography of Chinese architecture. Lin’s essay from that year, ‘On the Principal Characteristics of Chinese Architecture’, portrayed Chinese architecture as a system with an evolution over thousands of years, exerting a strong influence across the Asian continent. Lin believed that the ‘structural rationalism’ of China’s wooden architecture resonated with both the western Gothic system and a modernist architecture then being built worldwide; since China’s timber‑frame construction shared the same structural principles as modern reinforced-concrete and steel‑frame construction, ‘one only needs to change the building materials, without radically changing the major structural parts’.\n\nConcurring with Lin, Liang’s essay of that year, ‘Architecture of the Tang Dynasty’, demonstrated how history evolved similarly to life’s cyclical growth, leading to a nationalist conviction, shared by many Chinese intellectuals, that Chinese culture reached its peak during the Tang dynasty (618–907), gained its refinement during the Song dynasty (960–1279), then declined during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, finally being usurped and overshadowed by western imperialist culture in the early 20th century. Liang believed that kudos should be given to Tang architecture, but at the time he was not certain that any examples survived in China. He could only view photos of the Dunhuang Murals (dating from the eighth to 10th centuries) in the Mogao Caves in north-east China, and take reference from Hōryū‑ji, a well‑preserved Tang temple in Nara, Japan.\n\nTracing China’s architectural history was paramount to Liang and Lin, who believed that China’s civilisation could only be repaired and rebuilt through ‘the re‑examination of its national heritage’. So eager were Lin and Liang to portray China’s traditional architecture as a singular system – equivalent to the Greek or Roman in the west – that they homogenised the concept of Chinese architecture, claiming that only one architectural style could best represent China’s ‘national style’: the timber structures exemplified by the Northern Chinese royal palaces and Buddhist temples, especially ones built from the seventh to 13th centuries. They overlooked China’s diverse architectural culture: the multiple construction systems and building types, particularly the vernacular buildings, of different regions and ethnic groups.\n\nThis point of view originated in their training at the University of Pennsylvania. After meeting in 1919 in Beijing, the pair were among the first Chinese students to study architecture at Penn. Although Lin took architecture classes, she could not enrol in the architecture school because she was a woman. While Liang received his Bachelor and Master of Architecture in 1927, Lin received a Bachelor of Fine Arts instead (Penn announced last year that Lin will be posthumously awarded a Bachelor of Architecture).\n\nIn 1927, Lin went to Yale’s School of Drama to take a course on stage design, and Liang enrolled at Harvard for a PhD on ‘oriental architecture’, but he found the materials on Chinese architecture available in Harvard’s libraries inadequate. Persuading Lin to cut short her course at Yale, they married in Ottawa in 1928, and, via a trip to Europe, returned to China. In 1931, the couple moved to Beijing and Liang accepted a position as a director at the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture. While recuperating from pulmonary disease, Lin became a volunteer member and proofreader for the society.\n\nThe pair’s essays in 1932 were published before they had carried out a thorough empirical survey. A month after publication, Liang conducted his first rural field study, followed by more than ten years’ field research conducted with Lin. Liang, Lin and their colleagues, such as Liu Dunzhen and Mo Zongjiang, painstakingly surveyed each ancient building they found, incorporating it into the historical framework they had previously developed. Their greatest triumph was in July 1937, identifying the Foguang Temple, a timber structure dating back to 857, in the Wutai Mountains. This breakthrough was a decisive repudiation of Japan’s declaration that Tang structures could only be found in Japan, a position that tormented Liang and Lin for years.\n\nThe most glorious moment in the couple’s careers was also one of the darkest in China’s modern history. While they were deep in the Wutai Mountains, fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops broke out in Beijing’s outskirts. Japan invaded China, sparking the Second Sino‑Japanese War. This war forced Liang and Lin to flee to southwest China, where they would stay in hiding for nine years. Despite the misery they experienced – Lin contracted tuberculosis and was much less involved in field trips – their exile turned into a fruitful grand tour that greatly expanded their horizons. Their escape across the continent opened their eyes to China’s diverse building types and construction systems. Of all their research, vernacular housing provided a significant path of interest for architectural study. Between 1932 and 1941, Liang and Lin visited more than 200 counties across 15 provinces, examining more than 2,000 structures.\n\nHowever, the heterogeneous materials they collected during their exile – the vernacular, ordinary and unorthodox – were generally excluded or repressed in Liang’s writing. His 1944 History of Chinese Architecture, in Chinese, did mention some other elements – such as masonry structures, vernacular housing and gardens – but this work was dwarfed by his extensive accounts of timber royal palaces and temples. Chinese Architecture, A Pictorial History, written in English in 1946, focused only on the structural rationalist principles of Chinese timber construction and its evolution.\n\nDuring the war, Liang and Lin kept themselves updated on architectural developments in the west by reading books sent by American friends. Their passion for modernism continued to grow and further expanded to social housing and town planning. Immediately after the Second World War, Liang made a year‑long trip to the US, joining the design team for the UN Headquarters (alongside Le Corbusier and Oscar Niemeyer, among others). He taught Chinese architecture at Yale and visited Frank Lloyd Wright, Eliel Saarinen and Walter Gropius. In July 1947, Liang, fully recharged, returned to China. He was determined to establish a Bauhaus model of architectural education, hoping to implement the wide range of modernist exemplars he had learnt in the US to aid in China’s postwar reconstruction.\n\n‘Between 1932 and 1941, Liang and Lin visited more than 200 counties across 15 provinces and examined more than 2,000 structures’\n\nBut the war in China did not stop. The Chinese Civil War continued until 1949 when Mao Zedong seized power and founded his ‘New China’. The couple chose to stay in Mainland China rather than flee; they hoped that the revolution would be a testbed to realise their visions and to connect Chinese architecture’s glorious past to its modern future, under a supposedly socialist regime. In the first few years of Mao’s ‘New China’, Liang and Lin were entrusted with several prominent tasks, such as participating in the National Emblem design (1950), the Monument to the People’s Heroes (1952–58), and the Central Government’s Administrative District (1950, unbuilt).\n\nHowever, they quickly found their spatial vision in fundamental contradiction to Mao’s sociopolitical ideal. Mao believed history could only progress through violent class struggle and thorough revolution, but many Chinese intellectuals, including Liang and Lin, were still clinging to their ‘bourgeois’ thoughts. Nothing but the radical ‘Thought Reform’ could rectify their minds. From 1950, Mao launched a series of campaigns that required intellectuals to convert their ‘feudalist and bourgeois thoughts’ to Marxism‑Leninism and proletarianism, and to purge their American and western European sympathies to ‘lean single‑sidedly’ towards the Soviet Union. Numerous Chinese intellectuals were pressured to write self‑criticism; among Chinese architects, Liang wrote the most systematic, thoroughly self‑debasing confessions, renouncing his past to embrace the new. But to develop a ‘progressive’ architectural style suitable for Mao’s new regime, Liang had to renounce the structural rationalism and modernism that he had insisted on since the 1930s. Now Liang suggested that the new Chinese architecture should follow classical tripartite composition, an approach later nicknamed the ‘Big Roof’.\n\nBut Liang’s proposal for a neoclassical National Form was, in fact, at odds with Mao’s distaste for Chinese traditional architecture. Mao, unlike Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin and Nehru, had no clear agenda for architecture in his grand scheme of China’s modernisation. Counterintuitively, Mao preferred the colonial buildings constructed by western imperialists in Chinese coastal cities, hating ancient city walls and courtyard houses and dismissing the Big Roof, describing it as a ‘turtle shell and Taoist priest’s hat’. On a personal level, Mao loathed Liang’s insistence on preserving Beijing’s ancient city, against Mao’s intention to demolish its walls and locate the central Government’s Administrative District in the ancient core.\n\nAs Lin’s health deteriorated, Mao launched his Anti-Waste, Anti-Retroism, Anti-Formalism Campaign in spring 1955, the primary target of which was Liang. Liang’s thinking was condemned as ‘bourgeois idealism, formalism and revivalism’; his National Form was considered extravagant and wasteful, and he was accused of being reactionary and not in support of Mao and the Communist Party of China’s leadership. In 1958, the Beijing municipality finally declared that the old feudalist city of Beijing would be ‘fundamentally transformed’, to Liang’s great distress. Within a year, the city lost many of its ancient buildings, including temples, pagodas, bridges, courtyard houses, and a big portion of its city walls, to make room for massive boulevards, squares and gigantic buildings. Beijing’s city walls were completely dismantled by the mid 1960s; Liang and Lin’s former courtyard compound was demolished by a developer in 2009, even though it had been listed as a ‘national cultural relic’.\n\nLin died in 1955 from tuberculosis and only witnessed the beginning of the campaign against Liang. By 1959, after a decade of Thought Reform and having witnessed the obliteration of his cherished Beijing, Liang wrote a series of articles that praised the array of new monumental buildings for bringing ‘a new sense of scale to Beijing’. For the rest of his years, Liang was busy writing self‑criticism or directing criticism at his colleagues on behalf of the Communist Party. He died in great agony in 1972 amid Mao’s most destructive Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."
