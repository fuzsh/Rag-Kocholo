Foguang Temple is currently known to be the third-oldest wooden temple in China after subsequent discoveries.\n\nOne of the key features of traditional Chinese architecture that sees continuity since the Tang is the lack of use of nails to secure buildings.\n\nInstead, the ‘dougong’, which is a series of cleverly designed interlocking structures are used to support weight of buildings.\n\nReferences\n\nRujivacharakul, Vimalin, and Deyin, Luo. 2015.
