        "text": "They come over ’ere…\n\nOn the recommendation of Satnam Sanghera’s Empireland, I’ve been reading\n\nRobert Winder, Bloody foreigners: the story of immigration to Britain (2004, with new chapter for the 2013 edition).\n\nAs I write, it’s a horribly topical theme—but it always is (for Winder’s thoughts on this month’s riots, click here).\n\nImmigration has always been a “nuanced and uneven affair”. Migrants are diverse; loyalties can be fluid and overlapping. While Britain has a chronic history of race riots, social unrest has varied. But “the political language remains morose”, irrational—venting prejudice rather than debate. Emigration “strikes us as daring and sprightly […] yet we habitually see immigrants not as brave voyagers but as needy beggars”. Britain has been both resistant and accommodating, with successive assimilations, new prejudices, routine kindness, and adaptability. Besides all the unsung workers who keep the economy afloat, immigration has long invigorated our institutions, architecture, music, literature, and our very language; “immigration is a form of enrichment and renewal”. But Bloody foreigners is no naive celebration; of course it’s a plea for tolerance, but Winder offers no simple solutions.\n\nEven in recent times (in the war-inspired propaganda of the 20th century, for instance) we have cultivated a belief in Britain as unconquerable; mighty forces such as the Spanish Armada, Napoleon’s war machine, and the Luftwaffe, we told ourselves, failed to breach our ramshackle but resolute defences. This indoctrination has left a false but distinct impression that we have never been invaded. Indeed, the famous insularity of the British is often attributed to the fact that we do not, unlike our continental friends, have a folk memory of foreign occupation. But this means only that our memories are short and unreliable, because our early history is one of little else.\n\nOn the eve of the Norman conquest,\n\nWhat we now think of as the archetypal English character was already, at this early stage, a robust mixture of Mediterranean, Celtic, Saxon, Roman, Jute, Angle, Danish, and Norwegian, all moulded and rain-streaked by the British climate and landscape.\n\nTraders, craftspeople, entrepreneurs, artisans, and heretics all began finding a home in Britain, and were resisted. Among many disturbances, what Winder describes as a “race riot” erupted in Norwich in 1312, attacking foreign traders, mainly Flemish and Walloon weavers. Chapter 3 relates the prospering of the Jews and pogroms leading up to their expulsion in 1290—“both a tragedy and a national disgrace”. Chapter 4, “Onlie to seek woorck”, tells how migrants filled a gap in the labour market left by the 1348 Black Death. Gypsies arrived from around 1500, also suffering discrimination. By this time there were 3,000 foreigners in London, 6% of the civic population. In towns like Sandwich and Canterbury as much as a third of the population were immigrants, both bringing prosperity and causing antagonism.\n\nThe luckless foreigners incurred the wrath of the locals in two contrasting ways: they were hated if they became rich, and even more if they remained poor. If wealthy, they were gimlet-eyed exploiters; if starving, they were good-for-nothing trespassers.\n\nConcluding a section on the Jews who found a haven from the 1648 pogroms in Ukraine, Winder has a prophetic comment:\n\nIn its bumbling way, England was providing a precious sanctuary for those persecuted in brasher countries. Soon however, this newfound tolerance would be tested on a scale never before imagined.\n\nFrench Huguenots:\n\nLeft, refugees landing at Dover in 1685, engraving by Godefroy Durand, 1885 (source).\n\nRight, Hogarth, Noon, 1736 (source)—\n\nWinder’s caption: “Affluent Huguenot churchgoers tiptoe past the ill-kempt natives”.\n\nHuguenots (one of the most inspired vignettes in Stewart Lee’s debunking of UKIP! cf. Rachel Parris) had fled persecution after the 1572 St Bartholomew’s Day massacre, but the main influx began from the late 17th century. Along with their expertise in making clothes, hats, paper, pins, needles, watches, clocks, and shoes, they possessed financial and mercantile skills. [1] The Huguenot merchants\n\nprobably thought of themselves as working temporarily from the London office. The rest were waiting for civilisation to return to France so that they could go home and pick up the threads of their former lives. This is true of a great many immigrants, even today. Immigration, indeed, might be a rather grandiose unequivocal word for what is often a diffident decision, full of hesitations and reluctant compromises. The drip-drip process of acclimatisation becomes immigration only in retrospect. […]\n\nThe Huguenot exodus was torrid, and only with the benefit of several hundred years’ distance can it strike us as inspiring. But from that vantage-point we can hardly deny that they came, saw, and prospered. Nor that “we”, after a certain amount of bluster and some clenched-fist bitterness, in the end accepted them without much more than a murmur.\n\nUnder the Hanoverian empire (George I, “most important immigrant of the 18th century—according to the traditional definition of what counts as important”), Germans came to Britain to work as businessmen and artisans; German architects, playwrights, and musicians played a major role in our cultural life. Migrants arrived from Holland, France, Poland, Italy, and the British colony of India; the population of Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews kept growing.\n\nChapter 9, “Servants and slaves”, describes the African slave trade and its immense profits—a story of coercion that contrasts with the choices of previous generations of immigrants.\n\n18th-century England was home to several thousand Africans who carried messages, steered horses through crowds, cooked, swept, busked, scrimped, saved, gambled, drank, slipped into secret doorways, clenched their teeth and cowered in fear, all in plain view of so-called polite society. Most social histories of the period see it as a time of elegant country houses, […] a neoclassical arcadia, in short, shot through with bolts of sexy exuberance, gluttony, and inventive industry.\n\nAfricans in Britain were “living among those who were growing rich on their suffering”. Winder sifts the piecemeal material on their shadowy lives. Slavery and racism reinforced each other: “through the slave trade, hostility to foreigners achieved a clearer definition”. (One theme that I dared broach: as the fortepiano was becoming an emblem of gentility, the trade in slaves and ivory must have played a role in the colour reversal of its keys—see Black and white).\n\nThrough the Victorian era (another German lineage), Britain continued to provide refuge for cliques of intellectual refugees from Italy, Germany, Hungary, and Poland—”not tolerance so much as indifference”. Meanwhile Winder offers some “industrial revelations”. By 1871 Germans were the largest foreign-born minority in Britain, with roughly 50,000 living here by the end of the century, lured by the industrial boom and freedom from state interference.\n\nChapter 12 is devoted to “Little Italy”—subject of a forthcoming post. From unsanitary lodgings around Clerkenwell, puppeteers, pantomime artistes, and jesters worked the streets. Juvenile organ-grinders led wretched lives, subject to ruthless exploitation by padroni gangmasters, the street urchins bolstering anti-Italian prejudice. In a process of what would be called “chain migration”, service industries emerged: besides instrument makers, delicatessens and restaurants started a revolution in Britain’s eating habits. Italian schools, churches, and barbers were also established. By the early 20th century the “barrel-organ menace” was a remote memory.\n\nNext Winder turns to the influx of the Irish, with around 400,000 arriving in the wake of the 1840s’ potato famine—“penniless, unhealthy, unshod, and unclean, few immigrants have been less welcome”. Though they made a source of cheap labour, resentment at their presence also revived religious sectarianism, and riots were common.\n\nThe police, urged on by a sensationalist or malicious public opinion, moved in to confront the hard core, but ended up having pitched battles with the disaffected residents.\n\nWinder sifts through the stereotypes prompting such enmity, noting a significant middle-class component and assimilation. “From unpromising beginnings the Irish developed into a success story”.\n\nEast London, 1890. Source.\n\nIn 1889 the Shah Jahan mosque was built at Woking, the first in the country, commissioned by the orientalist Dr Leitner, a Hungarian Jew. A new influx came in the 1890s with around 150,000 Jewish evacuees from the pogroms of Tsarist Russia—some prospering while others toiled in murky sweatshops. The anti-immigration lobby grew; fears of being “swamped” had little justification: “between 1871 and 1910, nearly two million Britons emigrated, far more than the number who arrived”. “Lascars”, a broad term for “Asiatic” seamen, established communities in Liverpool, London, and other ports; Chinatowns began to form. Meanwhile “religion, science, and philosophy joined hands to offer a new vocabulary for racial antipathy”.\n\nDuring World War One anti-German feeling ran high, egged on by the popular press. Like Satnam Sanghera and Fatima Manji, Winder reminds us of the major contribution of Indian soldiers on the battlefield. But\n\nThe First World War was the first time that Britain’s working class had travelled overseas in numbers, and when it returned home, it brought with it a sharpened hatred of all things foreign.\n\nStill, foreign food seemed attractive. Curry had already appeared on the menu of a coffee house in the Haymarket in 1773, and in Hidden heritage Fatima Manji notes a short-lived curry-house in 1810—with a delivery service, to boot. Winder goes on:\n\nIn 1931 the Bombay Emporium opened near the Tottenham Court Road, providing the first glimmer of what would later become an indispensable part of British life: the Asian shop. In Portobello, you could buy curry powder, poppadoms, and mango chutney.\n\nSeveral Indian restaurants opened in Soho, as well as in Glasgow and Cambridge—the beginnings of another culinary revolution. By 1970 there were 2,000 Indian restaurants in Britain (cf. Musical joke-dating).\n\nWinder constantly notes both the stars of industry and culture, and the wretched lives of the exploited sweatshop labourers. Between the wars, new arrivals came from Africa and the Caribbean, mostly students. National independence movements grew. In the 1930s a surge of arrivals from the Irish Free State went largely unopposed. Between 1933 and 1939, some 60,000 Jewish refugees managed to reach Britain—including a dazzling array of cultural figures. Still, anti-Semitism, if “only a pale flaring of the venomous feelings in continental Europe”, was substantial. Nicolas Winton’s Kindertransport stood in rebuke to the British government’s exclusionary policies.\n\nThough Britain’s colonial troops again played a major role in World War Two, fear of aliens was again reinforced. Britain recognised its debt to Polish troops, whose naturalisation after the war attracted little controversy. The following waves of immigrants were not so lucky.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile all this early history is fascinating, it tends to recede from memory as the story enters the period since World War Two. These were desperate times in Britain, as on the continent (see Lowe, Savage continent). Amidst a labour shortage, the substantial new wave of Irish immigrants was accepted, as were Italian workers—the official beginning of our affair with Italian restaurants and fancy coffee machines. But British racism was clear. The term “immigrants” was fast becoming a polite euphemism for “coloured people”. The popularity of black American troops stationed in Britain during the war had been temporary.\n\nThe 1948 Nationality Act gave all imperial subjects the right of free entry to Britain. Despite Britain’s postwar poverty, this seemed a tempting opportunity to a fraction of those now entitled to do so. The voyage of the Empire Windrush attracted much publicity (and anxiety), but it didn’t create a surge of similar voyages; only after 1954 did the exodus gather pace, with London Transport initiating a recruitment drive in 1956. The new West Indian arrivals, though few in number, were unpopular. Caricatures represented by Enid Blyton were being ingrained in children—and their parents.\n\nOver the next decade nearly a quarter of a million migrants arrived from the Caribbean, India, Africa, and Hong Kong, making their way “to the country whose authority they were at last shrugging off”. Migrants were unwelcome in all but the poorest neighbourhoods. Jobs were available, but trade unions were largely hostile; housing was a source of exploitation. The migrants soon became disenchanted with their drab, hostile new home. The government seemed to have no plan:\n\nIt declined to take any overzealous measures to prevent immigration, while refusing also to stand up for the migrants themselves.\n\nFrom India came Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims. Cypriots and Hungarians fled conflict in their home countries. By 1958 the Home Office estimated that there were 210,000 people from the Commonwealth living and working in Britain, three-quarters of them male. Racist resentment grew; teddy boys, egged on by Oswald Mosley, caused havoc.\n\nWhereas male workers had formed the core of previous migrants, the 1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act (“a preference for muddle over clarity, a refusal to be entirely guided by the promptings of either conscience or prejudice”) led indirectly to the consolidation of migrant families and communities. They became more assertive.\n\nKenyan Asians found refuge from 1967, and then Ugandan Asians from 1970. But emigration also soared through the 1960s. As tourism and package holidays took off, more Italian and Mediterranean migrants arrived. By 1971 there were a million Irish migrants, who no longer prompted resentment—though the anti-German temperament endured, recalled by my orchestral colleague Hildi.\n\nMigrants arrived from India and Pakistan, working in factories and setting up corner shops. As National Front youths indulged in “Paki-bashing” rampages, Brick lane, its population now largely from Bangladesh, again became a centre of racist violence.\n\nThe Chinese takeaway was becoming a national institution, largely staffed by migrants from Hong Kong. From 50 Chinese restaurants in 1957, numbers grew to 4,000 in 1970 (at a time when there were around 500 French restaurants!). In Sour sweet Timothy Mo gives a gripping fictional portrayal of the Chinese immigrant experience (cf. Ray Man). Despite the common complaint that newcomers refused to “fit in”,\n\nThe group of immigrants who made the least effort of all to fit in were the Chinese, who kept themselves to themselves and socialised almost entirely within their own families. Yet they were the least disliked. They kept their distance, and Britain seemed to like it just fine that way.\n\nThe Thatcher era from 1979 exacerbated relations. Still, her government soon had to accept 15,000 Vietnamese boat people, rescuing them from “the twin evils of communism and drowning”. Riots took place in Brixton, Toxteth, and Southall. While noting the violence unleashed between different communities from the Indian subcontinent, Winder observes that no-one liked to admit that “Britain’s urban culture was itself incorrigibly tough and brawling”. The terms “ethnic minorities” and “multiculturalism” came into use; schooling and religious instruction became hotly-debated issues. But\n\nNo-one could deny by now that Britain’s railways, hospitals, shops, cafés, and restaurants would have ceased to function without migrant workers.\n\nThe collapse of the Soviet bloc regimes, along with ongoing crises around the world, led to new surges. Fundamentalist Islam, the Rushdie affair, and 9/11 posed yet another challenge to Britain’s tolerance of migrants. In 2005 the 7th July suicide bombings in London reinvigorated Islamophobic sentiments in some quarters and made others question the nation’s cosmopolitanism. But somehow a violent backlash was avoided.\n\nDistinctions collapsed between refugees, asylum-seekers, and economic migrants. Measures of successive governments became more draconian while the processing system descended into chaos. The idea that Britain might benefit from migration held little sway. The mass media “seemed eager not just to report discord but to sow it”. The “debate”, if it can be called that, was (and remains) rancid and polarised.\n\nLeaving aside the barmier claims that migrants are all disease-ridden, criminally inclined scoundrels who have no place in our well-mannered, sceptred land, there is a sensible argument that they have been arriving on a scale that stretches our strained welfare resources, provokes social unease (true, though holding the migrants alone responsible is mischievous) and provides, in some cases, cover and opportunity for criminals. The opposing argument states that the demonisation of asylum-seekers is both vindictive and misjudged. It looks at a system that imprisons young children for months, and concludes that we are neglecting our moral duty. It suggests that asylum-seekers bring cultural enrichment as well as entrepreneurial drive: above all, they are individuals striving to live by our own ideals for self-improvement and betterment.\n\nThe awkward thing about these two extreme views is that they are both true, or contain truth. Immigrants are not all the same. They represent the full spectrum of human types: dreamers and schemers, rascals and rogues, saints and villains.\n\nFor the 2013 edition Winder added the chapter “Choppy waters”, with the Conclusion “Identity Parade”. Though forecasters wildly underestimated the number of those who would take advantage of the 2004 enlargement of the EU to come to Britain, it didn’t submerge the island—and it did provide us with a new generation of trusty Polish workers. Many of the new arrivals didn’t intend to stay.\n\nOn nostalgic portraits of English life by Betjeman and Orwell, Winder comments\n\nPeople who contrive thumbnail sketches of national identity are usually lamenting the passing of their own youth, the fraying of the iconography with which they grew up.\n\nHe ponders issues of identity and belonging, observing that statistics are unreliable and open to conflicting interpretations. Aware of the problems of segregation, Winder is not uncritical of multiculturalism. He explores whether integration and diversity are mutually exclusive.\n\n* * *\n\nSo I’m not sure quite what we can learn here from the famous Lesson of History. In the Preface to the 2013 edition, Winder explains:\n\nI was not seeking to imply that Britain owes everything to immigration; I was merely drawing attention to a common oversight, which was that the role played by immigrants in the story of Britain has been understated and overlooked. […]\n\nEven if entrenched communities were open to such messages, they might hardly profit from realising that we’ve always been both xenophobic and hospitable, or that migrants assimilate eventually. Still, it’s highly necessary to press the case, and among the vast literature on the topic beyond the rabid pages of the Daily Hatemail, this is a great place to start.\n\nNote also the Migration museum in Lewisham. Cf. Hidden heritage, Vermeer’s hat, and Pomodoro!.\n\n[1] Reflecting the history of migration, a 1743 Huguenot church in Brick Lane became a synagogue in 1898 (after an interlude as a Wesleyan chapel), and then a mosque in 1976 (see also this site).\n\nI’ve often cited Nicolas Slonimsky’s brilliant Lexicon of musical invective. So I enjoyed reading his fascinating memoir\n\nPerfect Pitch,\n\nin a revised third edition from 2023, ably edited by his daughter Electra Slonimsky Yourke.\n\nWritten with wit and wisdom at the age of 94, and first published in 1988, it’s a captivating blend of substance and gossip, packed with wonderful anecdotes—a Who’s Who of figures that seemed to matter at the time, part of a niche zeitgeist.\n\nNicolas Slonimsky (1894–1995) (fine website, with A/V; books, including Writings on music, 4 vols., 2005; wiki) was “a typical product of the Russian intelligentsia”—in the early chapters he gives a detailed account of his Russian family history and political turmoil. Already by 1912 his early musical facility led him to describe himself as a “failed wunderkind”.\n\nIn autumn 1918 he left St Petersburg. After stays in Kiev and Yalta, in 1920 he reached Constantinople (pp.85–90), where he found many musicians among the throng of Russian refugees. Lodging with a Greek family, he accompanied Russian dancers, and played for restaurants and silent movies. He composed Obsolete foxtrot and Danse du faux Orient, later included in his Minitudes. After following a girlfriend, a Russian dancer, to Sofia, by late 1921 he arrived in Paris—also inundated by Russian emigrés. There he worked for Serge Koussevitzky for the first time, who introduced him to Stravinsky in Biarritz. Koussevitzky, sorely challenged by irregular time signatures, * asked him to rebar The Rite of Spring for him. Despite moving in cultured circles, Koussevitzky (like Tennstedt later) was not a great reader.\n\nSlonimsky was impressed by Nikolai Obukhov, a “religious fanatic” who made a living as a bricklayer. Inspired by Scriabin, and an unlikely protégé of Ravel, his magnum opus Le livre de vie for voices, orchestras, and two pianos (Preface here) contained “moaning, groaning, screaming, shrieking, and hissing”. He dreamed of “having his music performed in an open-air amphitheatre, perhaps in the Himalayas or some other exotic place”. He developed the croix sonore, a prototype of the theremin.\n\nIn 1923 Slonimsky docked in New York, travelling on a Nansen passport, “an abomination of desolation, the mark of Cain, the red spot of a pariah”. He soon found work as opera coach for the new Eastman School of Music in Rochester, at the invitation of Vladimir Rosing. He now confronted the challenge of learning English. Indeed, the book is full of gleeful comments on language learning. Taking advertising slogans as his textbook, Slonimsky’s arrangements (particularly Children cry for Castoria!) became popular. America seemed a fairy-tale land. At Eastman he found a kindred soul in author Paul Horgan.\n\nIn 1924 Koussevitzky replaced Pierre Monteux as conductor of the Symphony Orchestra (whose musicians were mainly German, French, and Russian), and the following year he invited Slonimsky to become his secretary (feeling more like a “serf”). Koussevitzky was in awe of Rachmaninoff’s genius, and despite his withering assessments of rival conductors, he did promote Mitropoulos and Bernstein; he was dismissive of Arthur Fiedler’s Boston Pops (cf. the splendid Erich Leinsdorf story). Much as he valued Slonimsky’s talents, his insecurity meant that his young protégé always had to tread carefully, and in 1927 they parted company.\n\nStill, he now enjoyed a “meteoric” conducting career. With no illusions about his rudimentary technique, he founded the Chamber Orchestra of Boston, promoting contemporary composers—notably Henry Cowell, Edgard Varèse, and Charles Ives. After a performance of a work by Cowell, they rejoiced in the headline “”Uses egg to show off piano”. Slonimsky introduced Aaron Copland to George Gershwin. After Cowell introduced Slonimsky to Charles Ives, they became close.\n\nHenry Cowell with Charles Ives, 1952.\n\nSlonimsky was full of praise for Ives:\n\nI learned to admire the nobility of his thought, his total lack of selfishness, and his faith in the inherent goodness of mankind. […] He inveighed mightily against self-inflated mediocrity, in politics and art alike. The most disparaging word in his vocabulary was “nice”. To him, it signified smugness, self-satisfaction, lack of imagination. He removed himself from the ephemeral concerns of the world at large. He never read newspapers. He did not own a radio or a phonograph, and he rarely if ever attended concerts.\n\nIn 1931 (the year he gained US citizenship), Slonimsky gave the première of Ives’s Three places in New England in New York. Promoting the work with passion, in Perfect pitch he waxes lyrical about its genius.\n\nSlonimsky conducting Varèse’s Ionisation in Havana.\n\nHe was invited to conduct in Havana, his first experience of modern Cuban music. He conducted revelatory concerts in Paris, sponsored by Ives, encouraged by Varèse. There too he married Dorothy Adlow.\n\nHe returned to Europe for more concerts in 1932—with Bartók giving the Paris premiere of his 1st piano concerto, and Rubinstein playing Brahms’s 2nd piano concerto!!! In Berlin (in the nick of time before the grip of Nazism) he conducted the Berlin Phil in a modern programme including Three places in New England and Varèse’s Arcana. He repeated the programme in Budapest.\n\nHe reflects on this ephemeral phase of his career:\n\nThe art of conducting is paradoxical, for its skills range from the mechanical to the inspirational. A conductor can be a semaphore endowed with artificial intelligence, or an illuminating spirit of music. The derisive assertion that “anyone can conduct” is literally true: musicians will play no matter how meaningless or incoherent the gestures of a baton wielder may be. In this respect, conductors stand apart from other performers. A violinist, even a beginner, must be able to play on pitch with a reasonable degree of proficiency. A pianist must have enough technical skill to get through a piece with a minimum of wrong notes. But a conductor is exempt from such obligations. He does not have to play; he orders others to play for him.\n\nThis leads him to some wonderful stories about badly-behaved conductors (cf. Viola jokes and maestro-baiting); Toscanini, Klemperer—and this story, evoking the unwelcome posturings of many a later maestro:\n\nMengelberg once apostrophised his first cello player with a long diatribe expounding the spiritual significance of a certain passage. “Your soul in distress yearns for salvation,”, he recited. “Your unhappiness mounts with every passing moment. You must pray for surcease of sorrow!” “Oh, you mean mezzo forte,” the cellist interrupted impatiently.\n\nI’m eternally grateful to Slonimsky for relating some classic Ormandy maxims (now joyously expanded here by members of the Philadelphia orchestra)—OK then, just a couple:\n\nSuddenly I was in the right tempo, but it wasn’t.\n\nWho is sitting in that empty chair?\n\nIn “Disaster in Hollywood” he tells how his first appearance with the LA Phil in 1932 ended in tears. When the programmes for his eight-week season at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1933 proved far too challenging for the “moneyed dowagers”, his conducting career came to an inglorious end. He takes consolation in the later admission of the works that he championed to the pantheon (cf. the fine story of Salonen’s interview for the LA Phil!). Meanwhile in New York he conducted, and recorded, Varèse’s revolutionary Ionisation.\n\nWith typical linguistic flourishes, he devotes a proud chapter to the birth of his daughter Electra, editor of the volume. He rearranged a limerick:\n\nThere was a young woman named Hatch\n\nWho was fond of the music of Batch\n\nIt isn’t so fussy\n\nAs that of Debussy\n\nSit down, I’ll play you a snatch.\n\nHe would have enjoyed these limericks, and one by Alan Watts, n.2 here.\n\n“Like gaseous remnants of a shattered comet lost in an erratic orbit”, occasional conducting engagements still came his way. In “Lofty baton to lowly pen” he recalls his transition to musical lexicography. He met fellow Russian emigrés Léon Theremin (whose life was to take a very different course) and the iconoclastic theoretician Joseph Schillinger. As Slonimsky compiled his book Music since 1900 (1937!), he became interested in the savage reception of new music, leading to his brilliant Lexicon of musical invective.\n\nStill, he was never tied to his desk. His appetite whetted by his trips to Cuba, in “Exotic journeys” he recalls his 1941–42 tour of Brazil (hearing Villa Lobos’s tales of his Amazonian adventures), Argentina, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Mexico. His book Music of Latin America was published in 1945.\n\nReturning to Boston, he was plunged into family duties. In 1947 he published Thesaurus of scales and melodic patterns.\n\nIn 1935, armed with a US passport, he returned to his birthplace, now called Leningrad, visiting long-lost relatives. He reflects on the death of his mother in 1944, and the life of his aunt Isabelle Vengerova (1877–1956), who became a legendary piano teacher in the States.\n\nAfter the war, with Russia in vogue in the USA, Slonimsky enjoyed revising his proficiency in his mother tongue, updating old manuals to teach students and taking on work as translator. While he was largely free of McCarthyite suspicion of sympathising with Communism, back in the USSR his brother Michael was at far greater risk for being suspected of opposing it (for Soviet life, note The whisperers).\n\nDissatisfied with previous compendia and nerdily meticulous, he found a new mission in updating Baker’s biographical dictionary of musicians. He was proud of his 1960 article “The weather at Mozart’s funeral”. In 1956 he achieved unprecedented celebrity through appearing on the quiz show The big surprise.\n\nIn “The future of my past” he describes another trip to the USSR and the Soviet bloc in 1962–63, funded by the State Department—an Appendix to the third edition provides a detailed account. He visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, as well as Greece and Israel. On his meetings with musicians, he was inspired by the energy of Ukrainian and Georgian composers.\n\nHis diary is punctuated by his curiosity about language, starting in Moscow:\n\nTo my Americanised ears, the new Soviet language sounded almost theatrical in its emphasis, deliberate articulation, and expressive caesuras. I also noticed a proliferation of diminutives….\n\nIn Prague he learned the vowel-less tongue-twister Strc prst skrz krk:\n\nI used this phrase as the supposed title of a choral work by the mythical Czech composer Krsto Zyžik, whom I invented and whose name I was tempted (I ultimately desisted) to include as the last entry in my edition of Baker’s.\n\nBut soon after his return to Boston his wife Dorothy had a heart attack, which was to be fatal. Bereft after her death in January 1964, he welcomed the offer of a post at distant UCLA. He composed musical limericks for his students’ benefit, but was not always impressed by their aptitude, citing gems from their essays such as “A piano quintet is a piece for five pianos”.\n\nAfter two seasons he reached compulsory retirement age, but he was never going to go quietly. In LA he enjoyed a wide social circle. Besides many “flaky” composer friends was John Cage, now a guru (Slonimsky cites Pravda: “His music demoralises the listeners by its neurotic drive and by so doing depresses the proletarian urge to rise en masse against capitalism and imperialism”!).\n\nWith John Cage, and Frank Zappa.\n\nBack in LA, he made friends with Frank Zappa, who invited him to play at his gig.\n\nDancing Zappa, wild audience, and befuddled me: I felt like an intruder in a mad scene from Alice in Wonderland. I had reached my Age of Absurdity.\n\nMeanwhile with perestroika in the Soviet Union, Slonimsky was becoming quite a celebrity there too, making several more visits and admiring composers’ creativity in new idioms.\n\n* * *\n\nFar more than a mere entertainer, Slonimsky was a major figure in promoting new music. With his eclectic tastes, I can’t help thinking that he would have enjoyed gravitating to ethnomusicology, questioning the wider meanings of “musician” or “composer” (see e.g. Nettl); but he was deeply rooted in the WAM styles of Russian classics and the American avant-garde. Still, within the world of WAM literature it makes a most fascinating memoir.\n\nFor some reason it fills me with joy to learn that a Japanese translation of Lexicon of musical invective has been published.\n\n* Even 5/8 was too much for Koussevitzky:\n\nHe had a tendency to stretch out the last beat, counting “one, two, three, four, five, uh”. This ‘uh” constituted the sixth beat, reducing Stravinsky’s spasmodic rhythms to the regular heartbeat. When I pointed this out to him, he became quite upset. It was just a luftpause, he said. The insertion of an “air pause” reduced the passage to a nice waltz time, making it very comfortable to play for the violin section, who bore the brunt of the syncopation, but wrecking Stravinsky’s asymmetric rhythms.\n\nTaipei: Daoist priests working for the Hsien-miao altar 顯妙壇,\n\nled by master Chu K’un-ts’an 朱堃燦, “open the eyes” of a god statue damaged in a temple fire.\n\nAll images courtesy of Yves Menheere. [1]\n\nPursuing a major theme that I broached in my superficial survey of music-ritual cultures in Taiwan, I learn much from\n\nYves Menheere, The Way and its powers: an ethnographic account of Taoist practice and religious authority in northern Taiwan (2020),\n\na lucid study which helps further my education on a topic that I previously found somewhat indigestible.\n\nThe Introduction sets the tone for Menheere’s enquiry:\n\nWhy do people put their faith in religious specialists? Why are some people considered to be more adept at communicating with deities, explaining scriptures, blessing objects, or solving problems with ghosts and other malevolent forces?\n\nContrasting rituals that are “supposed to work” with those that are meant to be carried out “in the correct way”, Menheere finds that “neither efficacy nor proper performance can explain why people put more faith in one particular priest and not another”. In exploring authority and charisma he considers the work of Max Weber, Stephan Feuchtwang and Wang Mingming, Vincent Goossaert, and Pierre Bourdieu.\n\nHis useful summary of previous research starts with J.J.M. De Groot in late-19th-century Xiamen (in mainland Fujian); and for Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), studies by Japanese scholars and colonial administrators, notably a 1919 report under the supervision of Marui Keijirō. After World War Two, the pioneering work of Kristofer Schipper (on south Taiwan) and Michael Saso (for Hsinchu in the north) was continued by John Lagerwey for both north and south. Taiwanese scholars have also been industrious, from Liu Chi-wan and Lee Fong-mao to Lü Ch’ui-k’uan, followed by Lin Chen-yuan and others. As Menheere notes, the main focus of such studies has been the description of rituals and the search for the origins of particular practices and traditions; however, scholars adopting more anthropological approaches include Stephan Feuchtwang, David Jordan, John McCreery, Robert Weller, and Chang Hsun.\n\nOffering and Sending Away (che-sang 祭送) ritual segment.\n\nLeft: 1930s (from Kajiwara Michiyoshi 梶原通好, Taiwan nōmin seikatsu kō\n\n台灣農民生活考, 1939).\n\nRight: Lim Ch’ing-chih 林清智 (b.1952), 2015.\n\nFor ritual studies, I’ve outlined how by the early 1980s, as the PRC opened up after three decades of Maoist repression, the scope of fieldwork at last expanded to mainland China—fanning out from south Fujian (ancestral home of the Taiwanese Daoist altars) in a succession of major projects, mostly led by scholars with experience of the religious scene in Taiwan. So whereas previously the island was almost the only accessible site where scholars could study the riches of Daoist ritual, a wealth of local traditions now beckoned all over the vast expanses of the PRC, “if not eclipsing the reputation of Taiwan’s heritage, then at least putting it into perspective”, as I wrote (cf. The resilience of tradition).\n\nHowever, it’s always worth paying attention to the ritual life of Taiwan, subject to fewer disruptions than in the PRC—with research now enriched by access to traditions shared with the southeastern mainland. And since scholarship on both sides of the strait, though based on fieldwork, has stressed the early origins of rituals rather than social ethnography (cf. Debunking “living fossils”—combining these approaches for Fujian, though, is Ken Dean), Menheere offers a fresh perspective.\n\n* * *\n\nThe distinction between Redhead (ang-thau 紅頭) and Blackhead (o-͘thau 烏頭) ritual specialists is particular to Taiwan and Fujian; while much discussed, it remains complex. In north Taiwan, Blackhead priests specialise in performing mortuary rituals, and are either Sek-kau 釋教 Buddhists, or Daoists sometimes described by the name Numinous Treasure (Leng-po / Lingbao 靈寶). Redhead Daoists—Menheere’s focus, whom he describes as “the Northern Priests”—refrain from performing funerals. While belonging to the Cheng-it / Zhengyi 正一 branch (like Daoists further south in Taiwan), they\n\ncarried out rites in ways that were broadly similar, and they were able to work together in ritual performances, which frequently occurred. Their way of working set them apart from priests from central or southern Taiwan, who performed rituals in different ways and were generally unable to work in concert with priests from northern Taiwan. These priests agreed that they belong to the same phai 派 or “branch” of Taoism and that priests from central and southern Taiwan belonged to a different branch. [2]\n\nAs Menheere observes, authority is relational: “it depends on the position of the individual priest in a wider network of priests, and it is always socially constructed and cannot be reduced to a particular priest’s personality or individual qualities”.\n\nBetween the Introduction and Conclusion, the book is arranged in six unnumbered chapters, to which I will award numbers here.\n\nChapter 1 (“Gods, ghosts and ancestors”) opens with a description of an exorcistic ritual intended to deter malignant forces of the road (lo-͘soah 路煞) from causing traffic accidents and other misfortunes besetting the community. Menheere goes on to give an overview of the religious environment in which the Northern Priests operate. Apart from large-scale temple ceremonies like the Chio / Jiao 醮 Offering, brief “minor rites” (sio-hoat 小法, or “little things” sio-su-a 小事) are also a regular part of the priests’ duties, often requiring only a single officiant. (I was glad to learn that priests in Taiwan describe the performance of ceremonies as “doing things” (cho-su 做事), cf. banshi 办事 in north China).\n\nAlways favouring practical grassroots perspectives above historical theory, Menheere unpacks the meaning of Cheng-it (Zhengyi)—”a term used by priests who shared their particular way of working, which presumed knowledge of two particular sets of rites; and did not perform funerary rites”.\n\nBy contrast with Schipper’s account for south Taiwan (e.g. his influential 1985 article), where “classical” and “vernacular” rites are carried out by different specialists, the Northern Priests practise a hybrid tradition, with two categories of rites, the “Way” (Tō / Dao 道) and “Methods” (Hoat / Fa 法): “two separate systems of rites, different in their performance, but referred to by the priests as complementary and sometimes even overlapping”. So Menheere ponders Schipper’s classical / vernacular dichotomy in the northern context, under the headings of language, pantheon, transmission, and the “mental states” of meditation and trance. Again working from the practical standpoint of the priests themselves, he confounds any simple distinction between the two types. Valuably, he notes contingency and modern change:\n\nWhen we consider the meaning of Tō and Hoat and their associated ritual traditions, we must account for how the terms take shape in local practice and acquire different meanings, rather than ascribe them meaning devoid of social and historical context.\n\nStill, “whether a rite was Tō or Hoat did not, for the priests at least, depend on its historical origins, but on the type of ceremony with which it was associated and on the way it was performed”. Noting that priests freely made use of the two categories during both exorcisms and offerings, Menheere illustrates this with Tō and Hoat versions of the “Worshipping the Lord of Heaven” ritual segment (pai Thin-kong 拜天公).\n\nChapter 2, a history of the Northern Priests from the Qing dynasty through the Japanese era to modern times, is full of detail on modern developments in their practice, showing that it is not immune to change. For the period since the 1980s, Menheere notes a shift away from healing rituals towards large-scale Offerings—which was attributed to perceived modernisation, notably in medical care. Thus “knowledge of the Tō rites for multiple-day Chio […] was slowly acquired by priests who initially performed mostly Hoat rites”. Moreover,\n\nThe expanding ritual market of the 1980s enabled several altars that at the time had only recently been established to rise to prominence. Indeed, some of the most successful and notable altars I observed doing fieldwork only began conducting offerings on a regular basis in the 1980s.\n\nHe also suggests a rather recent shift in the way the priests referred to themselves, with the autonym Cheng-it becoming more common.\n\nChapter 3, “Work and training”, looks at how ceremonies are performed and how the required knowledge to do so is transmitted. Menheere provides a good discussion of the role of “altars” (toan / tan 壇, an important term in south China that is seldom applied to household Daoists in the north), the physical and conceptual locus of a Daoist family tradition; and he gives a useful account of hierarchy and roles within the ritual group. As to personnel,\n\ncomposition of groups varied from altar to altar and depended on the position of the priest in the field. Priests with more successful altars usually limited hires to their apprentices and a small group of priests that worked almost exclusively for them. Priests with fewer apprentices or fewer opportunities to organise ceremonies, however, had to look outside their immediate ties.\n\nMenheere notes that “family was the principal source of knowledge for a small majority of the priests I observed”, but “recognising a master” from an unrelated family was also rather common. As to training in practice, he again finds variety, followed by a section on how priests assess competency:\n\nA priest’s skills were described with the word kang-hu [gongfu] 功夫, and priests who lacked the physical attributes of the ideal priests—priests that were too short, for instance—could compensate for such perceived shortcomings with their kang-hu.\n\nHe continues with a most salient reminder:\n\nIt is perhaps worth noting that being familiar with the intricacies of Taoist doctrine as found in its classical texts did not play a role in the training of the priests or judgment of their competency.\n\nThe following two sections discuss the major ceremonies associated with the two ritual traditions. Chapter 4 explores the links between authority and the correct performance of rituals through a discussion of changes in the programme of the Chio Offering over the past century (with rich material in Appendix A listing sequences for ten such rituals).\n\nAfter introducing the old “orthopraxy” trope and considering factors inhibiting change, Menheere argues “that despite the importance attached to correct performance, priests did occasionally—at least to a certain degree—have the ability to change the contents of rites and ceremonies and that such changes would not necessarily affect a priest’s authority”.\n\nWhile the structure of three-day Chio seems quite constant over the century for which we have evidence, five-day Chio (an expanded version of the three-day programme) have also become increasingly common. The main addition here was the fast chanting of various [nationally standard] jing 經 scriptures—which household Daoists in north China have tended to omit in modern times, even though they comprise a major part of their ritual manuals (e.g. Daoist priests of the Li family, pp.211–13, 375–8).\n\nMenheere continues with a detailed account of versions of the recently-elaborated ritual segment Ascending the Platform (teng-tai pai-pio 登台拜表) as interpreted by three different priests (cf. my account of Li Qing’s Pardon ritual):\n\nAll priests who performed the versions of the rite had access to Zhang Enpu’s text, yet none chose to follow his text to the letter. Even Master Tiong, who adhered to it most strictly, chose to add elements, attempting to, as he indicated in our discussions, make the rite more “correct”. It is possible that the priests in the other two cases chose to perform a much shorter rite because it was more convenient, not only for themselves, but also for all lay participants, who had to stand and watch the rite throughout.\n\nHe concludes the chapter thus:\n\nThe example of “Ascending the Platform” demonstrates that priests did have flexibility in revising rites in ways that did not transform them altogether. They were the experts, and as long as the performance of particular rites fulfilled expectations, the patrons neither grasped minor changes nor challenged a priest’s authority.\n\nScene from the Great Improvement of Luck ritual:\n\nthe patron blows out a flame to send away the im 陰 fire.\n\nChapter 5 focuses on the links between authority and efficacy in the exorcistic Toa-po-͘un 大補運 Great Improvement of Luck, the major healing ceremony of the Northern Priests, when the patron often suffers from a serious medical condition. While careful not to add further layers of anthropological abstraction to the complexities of the ritual system itself, Menheere again begins with theoretical perspectives; [3] then, setting forth from the research of Hsu Li-ling, he moves on to elements in the adaptable programme for the Great Improvement of Luck ritual, and five vivid case studies from his own fieldwork (note the lists of ritual segments in Appendix C).\n\nIf patrons were not familiar with the logic of the Toa-po-͘un, they were generally free to interpret the ceremonies in ways not directly derived from the meanings enacted in the rites. For patrons, the “effective meaning” was found, not so much in the symbolism of the rite, but in the fact that a priest, possessing a body of specialised knowledge to which they had no access, was involved and employed his knowledge to interact with and implore deities to intercede. Such an attitude, combined with the spectacle of the ceremony and the impressions it left on the spectators, predisposed observers to connect the performance to any event during or after the ritual proceedings.\n\nMenheere ends the chapter by considering efficacy (ling 靈)—the core of Chinese popular religion, according to Valerie Hansen and Adam Yuet Chau:\n\nPatrons did not hire priests to conduct Toa-po-͘un because they knew the rituals would work. They hired priests because they believed in the potential of the ritual and that it was the right course of action. These beliefs were bolstered by, not so much prior successes in Toa-po-un performances, but by a priest’s connections with institutions and trusted individuals.\n\nHe argues that\n\nefficacy was the product of authority, rather than the other way around. A priest did not become a great priest because he cured his patients, he came in the position to cure his patients—or not—because he had become a great priest.\n\nThe Wei Yuan Altar 威遠壇 in suburban Taipei,\n\nwith Lin Ch’ang-tung 林昌桐 (1947–2019) presiding.\n\nIn Chapter 6 Menheere further ponders the way the organisation of ceremonies is distributed and how this relates to the idea of a field of priests. Recurring occasions include\n\nceremonies organised in honour of a deity’s anniversary; Worshipping the Dipper ceremonies, which many temples organised once or twice a year; ceremonies conducted for the construction of a new temple, the restoration of an old one, or the consecration of a new statue; and ceremonies held to feed the hungry ghosts during the seventh lunar month. Priests also commonly performed exorcisms […] as well as temple ceremonies held for the benefit of the ancestors of the faithful. On some of these occasions, temples could also choose to organise a Chio, but this was less common.\n\nWhile he notes some exceptions,\n\nmore common, recurring ceremonies were typically conducted by the same priest; that is, the priest responsible for a ceremony on one occasion returned to perform the ritual again.[…] In some cases, relationships between temples and altars spanned multiple generations.\n\nHe finds that “patrons unconnected to either a priest or a temple resorted to other ways to find a priest”, mainly through local or personal networks.\n\nPriests occasionally recounted how territorial claims were violently enforced in the past, but during my fieldwork, I was not aware of any violent incidents. Still, priests could be visibly displeased when they felt other priests were infringing on their perceived territory and would try to use their own local connections to displace the infringing priests if they felt that this was indeed happening.\n\nMenheere details various procedures in organising the Chio Offering—“the most elaborate and important ceremonies in the Northern Priests’ repertoire”, which (nonetheless) few of them had a chance to organise during their career. There was considerable competition between priests for the task of presiding over this ritual. Temples might appoint a chief priest directly, solicit bids, or appoint through divination.\n\nKnowledge of particular forms of ritual was a prerequisite to conduct ceremonies, but knowledge in itself did not guarantee success. The most knowledgeable priests were not necessarily those conducting the most ceremonies.\n\nStill, “priests who inherited a successful altar had the best chances at claiming a dominant position in the field”. He ends the chapter thoughtfully by suggesting further factors that may need including:\n\nIt would probably be easier to develop new contacts and lead a flourishing altar in areas where fewer priests operated than in an area with many active priests. We must also consider historical conditions and change. The situation was quite different in the 1980s, when the market for religious services, including the ceremonies of the priests, was quickly expanding and a priest’s method of entering the field may have been less important.\n\nIn his Conclusion, Menheere reminds us that\n\nterms like Tō, Hoat, Chio, and Cheng-it (and their Mandarin equivalents) have specific meanings that are locally and historically embedded, can change over time, and should not be taken for granted. […] Ritual practices can change, even if they are part of a tradition that highly values correct practices and sees immutability as a defining feature of what actually constitutes correct practice. While such changes can be triggered by external factors, specialists themselves do play an important role in shaping changes.\n\n* * *\n\nTime for my inevitable spiel: after silent, immobile text, nothing can compare to experiencing the “heat and bustle” (cf. Chau, Religion in China, pp.67–8) of Daoist ritual for real—here, for instance, is a “Great Improvement of Luck” ritual in 2022, just one of many online videos uploaded by the Wei Yuan Altar:\n\nAnd to sample the more “classical” Tō tradition, click here for a 1977 introduction to a temple inauguration, filmed by Patrice Fava (another scholar whose grounding in Taiwanese ritual bore fruit on the mainland)—see his Un taoïste n’a pas d’ombre: mémoires d’un ethnologue en Chine (2023), pp.30–31, 53.\n\n* * *\n\nWhile I’m in awe of their erudition, some scholars of Daoist ritual seem so committed to the Wisdom of the Ancient Sages that their accounts may seem more prescriptive than descriptive, almost evangelical; in both Chinese and English, they can speak only to a highly limited audience. Instead Menheere, with his clear style, refrains from unduly mystifying either the priests or their rituals.\n\nThe Way and its powers is valuable for incorporating ethnography, modern change, and ritual theory—all largely absent from the field as it took shape—into the established concerns of scholarship on Daoist ritual, which (first for Taiwan, later for the PRC) has come to be dominated by the salvage of medieval ritual structures and texts. The study of ritual traditions in mainland China might look quite different if the ethnographic approach had found more of a voice in Taiwan.\n\nSJ, Easter 2024.\n\n[1] Sadly, Menheere’s original PhD thesis (2017) contains a mere three images (the published version has none!), so I’m grateful to him for helping me illustrate this post with some of his splendid fieldwork photos. Images by Patrice Fava are found in John Lagerwey’s attractively-illustrated book Le continent des esprits (1991); though the captions don’t give locations, I’m told that they show rituals and priests from both north and south Taiwan.\n\nFor transliterations of terms and names I have followed Menheere’s practice, based (for Taiwanese) on the “Church” romanization and (for Mandarin) on Wade-Giles, with some pinyin equivalents added for terms with wider significance (such as Cheng-it / Zhengyi 正一).\n\n[2] Menheere comments further: “Taoist Blackhead priests were active in different areas in northern Taiwan, but only in locations such as Hsinchu and Tamsui would they regularly carry out other ceremonies in addition to funerals. In both areas, however, they had to compete with the Northern Priests”. Michael Saso gave an early taxonomy of the ritual life of Hsinchu in “The Taoist tradition in Taiwan” (1970).\n\nSimilar distinctions are commonly found in mainland south China, e.g. in Hunan; in the north I don’t recall hearing of household Daoists who refrain from performing funerals—if there are any areas where they do so (also for regions such as south Jiangsu), then I’m keen to learn. In north Shanxi the Li family Daoists used to perform rituals for both the living and the dead, but mortuary rituals now comprise the great majority of their business (see Ritual change in north Shanxi, and my film). Note also my major rethink of the Zhengyi–Quanzhen dichotomy.\n\n[3] Here, besides the sources that he cites, it’s worth consulting Catherine Bell’s surveys of the field of ritual studies.\n\nOld Bukhara (screenshot from Invisible Face of the Beloved).\n\nLast week on the eve of Nowruz, just back from Istanbul, I was happy to attend a concert of shashmaqom in the Brunei Gallery at SOAS, featuring two fine musicians from the Academy of Maqam in Dushanbe, Tajikistan: Sirojiddin Juraev on long-necked lutes and Khurshed Ibrohimzoda on vocals and tanbur plucked lute.\n\nAs I seek a rudimentary education on this suite repertoire of refined Sufi poetry accompanied by instrumental ensemble, in my explorations below (typically) I merely “gaze at flowers from horseback” 走马观花.\n\nShashmaqom originated from the numinous cultural metropolis of Bukhara, with related traditions evolving in centres such as Tashkent and Ferghana. For the greater region, Theodore Levin has adopted the term Transoxania, favoured by his fieldwork colleague Otanazar Matyabukov (“OM”)—stressing its “underlying geographic and social coherence rather than its more recent ethnic and political divisiveness”.\n\nFrom The hundred thousand fools of God.\n\nBasic sources on shashmaqom include an essay by Alexander Djumaev, the Musics of Central Asia site; Will Sumits’ chapter 15 in Michael Church, The other classical musics (cf. Musics lost and found, chapter 17); “Central Asian Republics” in The Rough Guide to world music: Europe, Asia, and Pacific; and sections in the New Grove Dictionary of music and musicians and The Garland Encyclopedia of world music.\n\nRather than attempting to define “classical” (cf. What is serious music?!, Joining the elite musical club, and in the introduction to my series on the Beatles) or to regard shashmaqom as a “living fossil” of courtly art music from a bygone society, it surely makes sense to understand such a tradition as part of the widespread, shifting maqam family of repertoires crossing national and class boundaries, albeit subject to canonisation (“maqām-isation”) even before the interventions of modern state regimes (see Rachel Harris, The making of a musical canon in Chinese Central Asia, pp.9–10, 97–9, 107–8).\n\nUnder the Soviet era, while shashmaqom was the object of official posturings about its “national”, “elite”, or “popular” status, it “found itself at the centre of a nationalistic tug-of-war” (in Sumits’ phrase), with competing Tajik and Uzbek versions.\n\nSo it’s high time for me to revisit Theodore Levin‘s “pioneering cultural odyssey” The hundred thousand fools of God: musical travels in Central Asia (and Queens, New York) (1996, with CD). Despite its brilliant title, I suppose I was somewhat resistant to the book at first: reading it just at a time when I was deep in Chinese traditions of village ritual that were (then) remarkably unmediated by conservatoire-style remoulding, I found it unfortunate that so many of Levin’s interlocutors were representatives of state ensembles. Whereas Veronica Doubleday and John Baily, living in Herat on the eve of the Soviet invasion, had been able to immerse themselves in the grassroots world of social musicking, Tashkent was different; when Levin arrived there in 1977 his institutional base was doubtless inevitable. On that initial stay he can have had little access to the social milieu that OM later described to him (pp.33–4):\n\nThe entire unofficial cultural network and economic system that supported the central events in Uzbek social life—the toy (wedding), âsh (literally, “food”—an early morning quasi-religious gathering of men given separately by the fathers of both bride and groom before every Uzbek marriage), and ziyâfat, gap, gurung, or majlis, as intimate evening gatherings of friends for conversation, food, and music are variously called—had existed all along in the shadow of the official cultural life played out in concert halls and theatres, at public ceremonies and on radio and television.\n\nSource: The other classical musics.\n\nThe tradition of gap is related to the Uyghur mäshräp, now the object of a new wave of repression in Xinjiang.\n\nBut if Levin too was perhaps frustrated that his initial clues to this elusive world were largely based on second-hand accounts rather than direct observation, he writes most insightfully about his encounters, with revealing stories of senior musicians’ lives. On his later visits to Tashkent with OM from 1990, he was able to attend gap and âsh ceremonies, meeting latter-day abdâl Sufi dervish “fools of God” (cf. Uyghur ashiq).\n\nBack in 1977 Levin regarded the shashmaqom as stagnating—”a musical system propped up from above by the policies of Uzbekistan’s culture apparat” (“Frozen music”, pp.47–51):\n\nThough I couldn’t put my finger on it, something had seemed not right about the performances of Shash maqâm I heard when I first came to Tashkent. Put simply, they lacked life. As taught at the Tashkent Conservatory, the Shash maqâm could have been compared to a dying person being kept clinically alive on a respirator. The respirator was controlled by the Ministry of Culture. It was the Ministry that had approved of the resuscitation of the moribund Shash maqâm in the late 1950s and had stage-managed its ideological repositioning as a leading exemplar of Uzbekistan’s “national” music (this after a near-death experience in the early 1950s in which the Ministry had decreed that the Shash maqâm had been too close to the feudal culture of the emirs, too distant from “the people”, too infused with undercurrents of Sufism, and thus had to be suppressed).\n\nStill, as I learned of the troubled maintenance of folk ritual activity in China through the Maoist decades (see e.g. Gaoluo), I doubted if the turgid state ensembles could really have monopolised the musical market before 1990. Indeed, Levin continues with a vivid section on Turgun Alimatov (1922–2008), whom he met between 1990 and 1994. As Alimatov recalled, after his radio ensemble was disbanded in 1952,\n\nI played at weddings with two brothers named Bâbâ Khan and Akmal Khan Sofixânov. Their father, Sofi Khan, was a famous hafiz [classical singer]. In those years, there were several musical dynasties which had a high calling […]. In contrast to other singers, the Sofixânovs performed exclusively songs with a religious content. They were religious people themselves, even during the time when religion was strictly forbidden. People who rejected religion simply didn’t associate with them, and for their part, the Sofixânovs stayed away from atheists. They were invited to the houses of believers.\n\nAlimatov told Levin how he used to take part in many Sufi zikr-samâ rituals at which the Sofixânovs would perform (cf. Turkey). And he contrasted such devout behaviour with that of a lowly class of musician known as attarchi—with whom he also used to associate (cf. the underworld of old Lhasa). On this CD (Ocora, 1995), recorded by Levin, Alimatov moves from long-necked bowed lute sato to the plucked tanbur:\n\nThe ghijak spike fiddle is common to Transoxania and Xinjiang. But whereas in Xinjiang the soulful satar had long been at the heart of the Uyghur muqam, in Transoxania the sato had long been dormant when Alimatov revived it in the 1950s, followed by his pupil Abduvali Abdurashidov in Dushanbe (see below). And here is Alimatov on tanbur in 2001, recorded by Jean During, leading scholar of Central Asian maqam:\n\nLevin continues with a revealing account of Arif Xatamov, another “unrepentant traditionalist who bemoaned the spiritual superficiality of contemporary music”—here’s a 2013 CD from Alchemy (as playlist):\n\nAnd in the following chapter on Bukhara (note Levin’s CD Bukhara: musical crossroads of Asia [Smithsonian Folkways, 1991] and Shashmaqam: the tradition of Bukhara [New Samarkand Records, 1999]), while learning of the depth of Sufi and Jewish traditions he pursues shashmaqom in greater depth, finding more “frozen music”:\n\nThe worker’s state whose goal had been to eliminate class barriers in art had vilified the Shash maqâm as an elite art and tried to expunge it from cultural life. When that had failed, it had then tried to transform the Shash maqâm into a popular art. But Soviet cultural stategists had gotten everything reversed. In Bukhara, the Shash maqâm and other “heavy” music had been a popular art. And when they had tried to turn this music into a “national” folk art, they had inadvertently created an elite art: elite, that is, because it had all but lost its audience. No-one wanted to listen to a music whose soul had been usurped by the state.\n\nThe ponderous ideology of the state troupes still persisted in the early years after independence from Soviet rule. But since then, as the concert market has liberalised, shashmaqom has found a niche in the “Heritage” and “world music” industries, affording a home for some fine, creative musicians.\n\nThe hundred thousand fools of God continues with chapters on musical life in the south of Uzbekistan, Khorezm, the Upper Zarafshan and Yagnâb, and Shahristan, where Levin encounters a range of musical activity in social contexts—Sufi rituals, weddings, epic singers, healers. The book is another accessible classic of ethnomusicology, valuable both as an account of the nuanced views of musicians striving to emerge from the Soviet-style cultural yoke, and in paving the way for detailed ethnographies of traditional musicking in Transoxania.\n\n* * *\n\nAnyway, if I find a radical gulf (or might I say gap) between folk and conservatoire in Han-Chinese musicking, it seems I should be rather more broad-minded on the journey further west. In 1950s’ China, when “old artists” were recruited to the new state song-and-dance ensembles and arts-work troupes, they often found themselves busy accompanying a bland, politicized repertoire quite divorced from their former folk practice, which they now abandoned. [1] Conversely, prestigious musicians in the Uyghur homeland and in Central Asia, rather separately from their duties in the state ensembles, often seem to have quietly maintained more traditional styles and contexts.\n\nWhile I’m keen to learn more about shashmaqom-related grassroots social life (however attenuated by modernization), this kind of music is always easier to find online in commodified versions on stage—including this short UNESCO presentation. Here’s a film from the Aga Khan Music Programme, which has played a major role in enhancing the global profile of Central Asian musics, and in sponsoring centres such as the Academy of Maqam:\n\nInvisible face of the beloved: classical music of the Tajiks and Uzbeks. Music of Central Asia, vol. 2 (2006):\n\nVol. 7, In the shrine of the heart: popular classics from Bukhara and beyond (2010), introduces other regional traditions worth pursuing.\n\nAbduvali Abdurashidov, the main guide in Invisible face of the beloved, leads this fine Tajik chamber ensemble on sato at a 2010 Paris concert, with singer Ozoda Ashurova, [2] Pasha Hanjani on ney—and a young Sirojiddin Juraev, whose visit to SOAS inspired this little survey:\n\nAbdurashidov appears on the CD Tadjikistan: chants et musiques classiques (Ocora, 2013):\n\nI’m enthralled by the CD Shashmaqom: Dugoh maqomi (Inédit, 2002), again recorded by Jean During:\n\nFor more, see again here, under Audio and video recordings, §8.\n\nAgain (cf. Taiwan), I note that one consequence of a superficial survey like mine is an undue attention to the “star” performers, rather than the unsung participants who are at the heart of grassroots musicking (cf. China).\n\nThe hundred thousand fools of God concludes in Queens, New York, where a notable Bukharan Jewish tradition of shashmuqom has taken root. The Ensemble Shashmaqam there is comprised of emigrés from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan (heard on Levin’s 1991 Smithsonian Folkways CD Central Asia in Forest Hills); in this concert they celebrate the artistry of three leading women performers who have performed with the ensemble over the years. In 2014 Evan Rapport supplemented Levin’s account in Greeted with smiles: Bukharian Jewish music and musicians in New York.\n\n* * *\n\nThe SOAS concert. Via Twitter.\n\nSo much for homework. Since China opened my eyes and ears to musicking as a vital part of social gatherings (life-cycle and calendrical ceremonies, and so on; cf. Society and soundscape), I’ve had conflicting feelings about “concerts”—events that we so easily take for granted. Of course I grew up with Western Art Music in concert (see e.g. here), and I’ve been complicit in presenting Chinese ritual traditions on stage (e.g. here, and on tour with the Li family Daoists—contrast my film); just that I’m sometimes struck by how such reification can skew our impression of the vitality of expressive culture in local society.\n\nAs Djumaev observes, while the new academies seek to adapt the traditional master-apprentice (ustod-shogird) system, a range of strategies for transmission has emerged in response to changing times. Still, however sensitively accomplished musicians may devise classroom teaching, I still find it an alien, stultifying environment for such a culture (cf. Training Daoists in Shanghai).\n\nAt SOAS last week, the concert and the preceding workshop were engagingly introduced by Saeid Kordmafi, new lecturer in the Music Department. In duet Sirojiddin Juraev (YouTube playlist) and Khurshed Ibrohimzoda have a wonderful understanding, their musicking at once natural and intense, never showy. Ibrohimzoda’s vocal items (some incorporating a vertiginously high tessitura—apparently his personal taste rather than a feature of the tradition) alternated with instrumental solos on plucked lutes and an intimate meditation on bowed sato. For all my concerns about the academy, their spiritual focus would surely have impressed venerable senior masters like Turgun Alimatov and Arif Xatamov. The dancer Madina Sabirova adorned two items, the singing in the lively finale revealing a more popular folk style.\n\nAcross the muqam world, as Levin (pp.55–6) notes, “rigidly structured, closed repertoires like the Shash maqâm had given way to autonomous pieces performed in a relatively personalised style”. The innovations of Turgun Alimatov remind him of Jean During’s remarks on modern change in Persian art music, characterising the shift as a “transformation from classical formalism to Romanticism”,\n\nin which music is cleansed of its status as a sacred object in order to become recentred in the interiority of the individual. […] The values of inspiration, creativity, originality, and personality of style and improvisation have become exalted to the detriment of conformity to standards, fidelity to repertoire, and fixed composition.\n\nWhile I might suspect that this downplays the creative individuality of the master musicians of Yore, it looks like an inexhaustible topic for debate.\n\nIn its latest reinvention of tradition for the concert platform, shashmaqom is most beguiling—I just wonder whether it might be creating a new kind of “frozen music”. As always, I’d like to learn about its prospects for a viable social life beyond the concert hall.\n\n* * *\n\nSee also under West/Central Asia: a roundup, Posts on Uyghur culture, and The 2002 Silk Road Festival. For other expressive cultures under state socialism and since its demise, see Resisting fakelore, Musical cultures of East Europe, Folk traditions of Poland, and Sound and sovereignty in Ukraine.\n\nThere’s always much to learn from Bruno Nettl, such as his taxonomy of responses to the growing hegemony of Western musics (Abandonment, Impoverishment/reduction, and Isolated preservation—the latter perhaps especially salient here); his wide-ranging unpacking of “improvisation“; and his insights on the conservatoire ethos in Western Art Music.\n\nWith thanks to Rachel Harris.\n\n[1] See e.g. A Daoist serves a state troupe. Though the opera and narrative-singing troupes were also the objects of intense remoulding (see e.g. my post on Gansu, and sequel), their musicians were often better able to preserve a more traditional style.\n\nRe my aversion to the conservatoire, I’m reminded of the Chinese text on the SOAS T-shirt, magnificently misread by one of my Daoist mentors as “anti-academy”…\n\n[2] For the modern admission of female singers into maqam ensembles, see again Djumaev.

In Europe, CDs have been issued by Ocora (1994, 1998) and World Network (1997). Here she is in concert:\n\n*Part of my education in the travails of modern Tibet*\n\nBendi Tso, Marnyi Gyatso, Naljor Tsering, Mark Turin, and members of the Choné Tibetan community, Shépa: The Tibetan oral tradition in Choné (2023)\n\n(free access here).\n\nShépa (bshad pa) * is an encyclopaedic repertoire of antiphonal songs performed by ritual specialists and prestigious elders of the Choné people (Co ne pa), a Tibetan subgroup in the Luchu river valley of Kenlho (Kan lho; in Chinese, Gannan 甘南) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Gansu province in northwest China. The region straddles both the Tibetan regions of Amdo and Kham and the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Gansu, bordering territory managed by the great monastery of Labrang (cf. this post, including further readings on Amdo, and sequel).\n\nShépa “encapsulates the evolution of Tibetan civilisation through time and serves as a repository of the cultural, religious, and historical knowledge of the Choné people”. As the authors explain, Choné history is profoundly shaped both by intricate interactions with close neighbours (Han, Hui, and Monguor) and by distant political and religious centres. From creation myths to Bon and Buddhist cosmologies and wedding songs, shépa engages with and draws on elements of religious traditions, historical legacies, and deep-seated cultural memories.\n\n“A collaboration with and between members of the local community, including narrators, monks, and scholars”, with its trilingual format (in English, Tibetan, and Chinese) the book’s 778 pages become less daunting.\n\nBendi Tso’s preface opens with a promising vignette, in what has become a classic juxtaposition (for Chinese instances, see e.g. my film Li Manshan, from 30.32 and 1.07.34):\n\nLeaning against the living room window the night before Sangye Men’s wedding, I felt as if I was straddling two worlds, separated by a thin pane of glass. In the yard, Sangye Men’s friends formed a circle and took it in turns to sing and dance, accompanied by a giant stereo speaker and a rotating rainbow globe light. Their playlist ranged from Tibetan ballads to Chinese songs, and from the traditional Tibetan lute (sgra snyan) to nightclub music. When Arabian Night started, a popular dance song appreciated by younger generations, the guests turned up the volume as high as it would go, swaying their bodies to the music and showing their enjoyment.\n\nRight across the window and inside a living room, four elders were sitting on tsatap (tsha thab / rdza rdo), a raised clay platform where people eat and sleep, drinking Tibetan spirits (bod rag). The flickering rays of the rainbow globe danced on their faces. Occasionally looking out of the window, the elders continued intermittent conversations while singing Shépa. I wondered whether they were able to catch each other’s words on account of the loud noise emanating from the speaker next door.\n\nThe co-authored Introduction (pp.1–64 in the English version) gives a nuanced definition of shépa, which has been considered as “poetic recitals”, “speeches”, “oral literature” or “oral tradition”—a combination of verse and prose in recitation and song. In their broad understanding, it is “an umbrella category including all local oral performances that have survived to the present”, on a spectrum from religious to secular. They discuss the relation of shépa to other oral traditions both in Choné and in the wider Tibetan and Himalayan cultural spheres.\n\nThe authors introduce ritual specialists (cf. Tibet: some folk ritual performers):\n\nAlmost every Choné village had an anyé bonpo (a myes bon po) household belonging to a lay Bon priest or an anyé gompa (a myes sgom pa) household of a lay Nyingma practitioner, who would be in charge of performing rituals for individuals and community before the 1950s. Nowadays, ever fewer villages have these priests.\n\nAs they surely know, this leap in time begs some basic questions. Again:\n\nLeu (le’u / lhe’u), who appear in Shépa, are a type of anyé bonpo. In Choné, Leu are crucial figures who conduct the protection ritual (srung) during the marriage ceremony. Over the past decades, ever fewer households of anyé bonpo have been in a position to transmit their heritage and duties to the next generation. Based on our current research, there remain only a handful of anyé bonpo, and no leu, in Choné.\n\nThe emblem of the anyé bonpo’s ritual expertise is the anyé zhidak (a myes gzhi bdag), “a built-in wooden cabinet designed for storing arrows (mda’) that represent lineage, fortune, and fertility, located beside the main pillar in the living room”.\n\nAmong the main performance contexts are wedding ceremonies, as well as horse racing and arrow shooting over New Year (cf. Bhutan). Weddings have “changed significantly over recent decades”, but we are not offered details on the process. Other material on change also begs questions:\n\nThese days, almost all of the critical moments in the lives of Choné people now involve Geluk monks and lamas, from naming newborn children to blessing newlyweds to performing funeral rituals. Since the 18th century, the majority of Choné people have become Geluk followers. Major festivals, fairs, and pilgrimage dates in the local calendar are arranged according to the religious schedule of Choné Monastery and its branches. In recent years, with village ritual specialists ageing and passing away, villagers offer their non-Buddhist ritual texts to Geluk monks and ask them to perform rituals that were once conducted solely by anyé bonpo and anyé gompa. Monks usually conduct these rituals with some Buddhist modifications.\n\nI applaud the intent of this study. Salvage projects can be valuable to document a kind of maximum repertoire, and the authors’ diligence in recording the community elders is commendable. But after that promising opening vignette, we are never told if shépa has taken on a new life, perhaps modified in new popular forms, beyond the reified stagings of the Intangible Cultural Heritage—whose many problems they recognise:\n\nIn recent years, “traditional” ways to learn and perform Shépa have undergone rapid transformation in the Choné Tibetan community. The transmission of Shépa is increasingly privatised and its performance is becoming standardised in response to the inscription of this oral tradition into the Kenlho Prefectural-level register of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2016. The performative setting and standards for what constitutes a “good” performer are fast changing, and this process has also been accompanied by a reconceptualisation of what Shépa was, is, and will be.\n\nThe remaining seven sections of the Introduction document texts—myths, ** and wedding songs—without any further social-political analysis of changes in wedding customs and New Year’s observances over the previous decades. The book has no index.\n\n* * *\n\nOutside the PRC, the field of Tibetan studies has made immense progress in recognising the legacy of the Maoist era, and the ongoing consequences of Chinese occupation—with research both from Tibetans based abroad (such as Tsering Shakya, and the High Peaks Pure Earth team) and from Western scholars (under my roundup of posts on Tibet, see e.g. Conflicting memories, When the iron bird flies). Among fine ethnographers in the field of customary life and expressive culture (note this bibliography) are Charlene Makley, Isabelle Henrion-Dourcy, Katia Buffetrille, Gerald Roche, and Anna Morcom (see also Keila Diehl’s Echoes of Dharamsala); the monographs of the Asian Highland Perspectives series were compiled by trained local fieldworkers.\n\nSuch research hardly features among the Shépa authors’ references. The book provides useful material on early history (migration, the Choné kings, Bon, Buddhist sects, warfare), but is entirely silent about social and political change since the 1950 Chinese occupation. So this is the last episode in their historical overview:\n\nFrom the mid-19th century, the Luchu valley suffered several regional wars. The Choné people were at that point the largest Tibetan group ruled by the Choné kings. Time and again, they were either conscripted into the king’s militia to suppress insurgents for the Qing and the Republic of China (1912–49) or slaughtered by insurgents. Throughout this period, the Choné people suffered serious depopulation. Most Tibetan villages on the northern bank of the Luchu River were destroyed in warfare. To collect tax and recruit militiamen, the kings leased destroyed, bankrupted or empty [sic] households to Chinese migrants who had narrowly escaped with their lives from social unrest and natural catastrophes in neighbouring areas. This resulted in a steady inflow of Chinese migrants into Choné. By 1949, the Choné people had already become a minority within an ever-growing Chinese population.\n\nThe authors state their goal:\n\nWe hope that this book may serve as an entry point for the Choné Tibetan community in support of their goal of Shépa revitalisation and at the same time uplift their linguistic heritage and cultural dignity.\n\nThis is laudable, yet while they are well aware of “the socio-cultural dilemma facing all Choné people over the past several decades”, political constraints hamper their analysis. Cultural impoverishment in communities like these is not simply a function of some generalised modernisation; it is also indivisible from political history since the 1950s.\n\nOf course we always have to read between the lines of PRC publications (see e.g. under Cultural Revolutions, and my two recent posts on opera and narrative-singing among Han Chinese communities in Gansu during the famine). The book’s four named authors are all based outside the PRC, and (like Amdo dwellers) doubtless have insights on the radical changes in society following the Chinese invasion in 1950, the devastation of communities as political campaigns escalated from 1956, and the new transformations since the 1980s. Even within the PRC, perspectives on the traumatic history of Tibetans (indeed, particularly Amdowa) under Maoism—and since—have not always been entirely off-limits.\n\nBut the period since 2015, when the authors were carrying out their own fieldwork, has been marked by intensified state surveillance amidst a severe deterioration in Tibetan–Chinese relations, with serious conflicts which they also pass over in silence, such as the 2008 unrest (e.g. here, under 15th June) and 2015 self-immolations (cf. Eat the Buddha). Their reluctance to broach such issues doubtless follows in part from their noble decision to involve as co-authors “the members of the Choné Tibetan community”; and the authors themselves, even while based outside the PRC, may not feel secure enough to avoid self-censorship. So my caveats are critical not of them, but of the extent of the climate of fear beyond the PRC.\n\nGiven that the book’s whole subject is cultural transmission, for which the era of Maoist extremism was a crucial period, I find it disturbing that discretion has obliged the authors to exclude all but the vaguest of allusions to it. Other topics left unexplored include migration, state education, and the vast influence of pop and mass media. Thus their account of “history” comes to an abrupt halt in 1950. While one must respect their decision, it limits the book’s value. I still wonder if there might be a way of giving some tactful clues to the painful maintenance of shépa; otherwise there’s a glaring lacuna, risking the kind of reified, timeless, rosy portrayals that are de rigueur in the Intangible Cultural Heritage mission.\n\nSince the authors quite rightly esteem the elders of the community such as Grandfathers Meng Tusktor and Zhang Gyatso, * one wants to know more about the vicissitudes of their lives—through the late 1950s’ uprisings, the famine, the Cultural Revolution; did they manage to continue singing shépa in the early 1950s, the late 50s, even the 60s? Were any of them recruited to the new song-and-dance troupes funded by the Chinese state—and what was happening to the traditional contexts for shépa in local communities? Have performers and audiences expressed any opinions about all this?\n\nAnd of course, apart from silent, immobile texts, we also need accessible audio/video recordings (see e.g. Amdo rituals: early and recent films)—something eminently realisable with online publishing.\n\nDespite such lacunae, there is substantial material here for historians of (pre-1950) Amdo; with its trilingual format, it is designed to serve the Choné community, under the conditions in which they find themselves.\n\n* On the minefield of Tibetan and Amdo transliteration, see Robbie Barnett’s introduction to Conflicting Memories.\n\n** Including the bird-like deity Khyung, and Rübel (Cosmic Tortoise, a name just begging to be taken up by a Choné rock band—cf. the Croatian metal combo Teddy Bear Autopsy).\n\nby Nicolas Robertson\n\nFor links to the complete anagram series, click here.\n\nPrelude—SJ\n\nSince Nick has Ascended to the Great Pinball Table in the Sky, I’ve found two more of his mind-blowing anagram tales. Alceste, which I posted recently, is relatively economical; this one—among stiff competition—is surely his most virtuosic, fantastical (and lengthy) creation. Even the introduction is highly challenging, before we reach the “story” and the final gnomic anagram tale itself. In the absence of Nick’s eagle eye, formatting his text has also been a severe challenge.\n\nNick’s penchant for tombstones as a medium to connect with the spirits of the past, especially evident here, now seems all the more poignant.\n\n* * *\n\nSALZBURG\n\nLeonore, first version of opera by Beethoven, 1805; shelved and reworked in 1814 as Fidelio.\n\nFidelio was one act shorter with reordered music; and had a brand new overture.

By day, monsoons and the heavy sun of Mitteleuropa; fading into night, a great still, bulging moon, hanging like a distant punchball, haunting the baroque fountains of a city with too much to remember. Here, one dreams—and sings—of escape: Mozart, from Archbishop Colloredo; Florestan, from prison, and Leonore from half-life to bliss.\n\nPerhaps it was no more than normal for the times, but I could not but be torn by the silent witness of those who escaped far too soon, from a world which had hardly begun to hold out its arms to them. St Sebastian’s Friedhof is a lovely shaded cemetery in a cloister on the other side of the Salzach, and just look what memories call to us from it: of Constanze Weber, Mozart’s wife, yes, and his father Leopold too, but also of the great-grandchildren (I surmise) of stone-cutting master Johann Doppler:\n\nMaria and Anna, born 2 November 1859, died 23 November and 4 December 1860; Otto, 17 February 1868–30 January 1870, and Rudolf, 13 April 1865–5 February 1870 (Johann could have had the melancholy task of engraving their stones, had he not died, aged 45, in 1838). And look, too, Therese Patera, b.1859, d.1861, “geliebtes Kindlein”,\n\nand, without even such ado, “Egbert Almeric Henry-Henry / born Feb 22 1859 / died March 22 1859” (the stone, high up and reticent, is inscribed, without any other words than these, in English).\n\nWhat was happening in Salzburg in the mid-19th century? Paracelsus, buried in the same St Sebastian’s church in 1541, would have plunged in, reckless of his own health, to fortify the unprotected, even though he well knew that\n\nAll, what is, lives.\n\nNothing is annihilabl,\n\neven Mouldering is transition to new life.\n\n(Tomb of Dominic Oberlechner, d.1821 aged 23, St Peter’s Friedhof, Salzburg—and in English, though you will find a similar text on the same monument in German, French, Latin, and Greek…)\n\nThis has, to me, a profound assonance with these words of Claude Lévi-Strauss (as quoted by Douglas Hyde, and printed in the latter’s Guardian obituary, where I read them on the day I wrote this, 22 September 1996):\n\n“Nothing is settled; everything can still be altered. What was done but turned out wrong can be done again. The Golden Age, which blind superstition had placed behind (or ahead of) us is in us.” [1]\n\n[1] “Si les hommes ne sont jamais attaqués qu’à une besogne, qui est de faire une société vivable, les forces qui ont animés nos lointains ancêtres sont aussi présentes en nous. Rien n’est joué; nous pouvons tout reprendre. Ce qui fut fait et manqué peut être refait: «L’âge d’or qu’une aveugle superstition avait placé derrière (ou devant) nous, est en nous.» I’m not sure from where Lévi-Strauss is quoting (Rousseau?); the whole passage in context is cumulatively inspiring. [Tristes Tropiques, 1955, p.471.] The English version above is as used for the epigraph to Alexander Cockburn’s book of essays The Golden Age Is In Us (1995).]\n\nWhat is this but the quiet request of the Zen master, Hōgen Daidō: “Why not here? Why not now?”, which translated into the high art terms of the western world would find its parallel in the manifesto of Hölderlin quoted by Geoff Boycott later in this story. But, though I happen to be writing these last (preliminary) words in Japan, I find it more appropriate to round the little life of this squib with the Biblical version of that long sleep which was written on the very slab of Johann Doppler (Steinmetzer, der unvergesslicher Gatte)’s descendants; for it’s worth knowing where we came from, even if we don’t know where we’re going (an apothegm which could well apply to this whole anagram lark):\n\n“Der Herr hat sie gegeben, der Herr hat sie genomen,\n\nder Name des Herrn sei gebenedeit!\n\nWie es dem Herrn gefallenhat, alsoistesgeschehen.” (Job 1.21.)\n\n* * *\n\nThere’s a more dynamic, equally important, side to this theme, though: “Soltai os encarcerados!” (“Let loose the prisoners!”)—when Lídia (die ferne Geliebte) sang these words of Gil Vicente in the tiny eponymous theatre in Cascais in 1969, she was banned, along with the play (“Um Breve Somário da História de Deus”) and the recording made of the songs, by Salazar’s nervous jackboots. But now we’re in the realm of heroes (and heroines, I prefer not to draw the distinction, after all Hero was—is—a girl’s name): the world of Carlyle, of Nietzsche’s Übermensch—not remotely, let us be clear, to be equated with the dummkopf Siegfried whose only quality is that he is “freer than the god”: Nietzsche, and his superman, win their status by thought—as well as, rather engagingly, superior nutrition. (Paracelsus to a T.) *\n\n* [What do I make of the fact that in Salzburg I am staying in the outreach of Himmelreich?—is this not Paracelsus?—whose given names are, Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim. What a place to site an airport… “Ich fühle Luft von anderen Planeten”—so wrote Stefan George, Rosicrucian, Paracelsan poet; another Stefan, Zweig, author of Beware of Pity (thank you to the one who lent me this book those years ago, a lucid notion on her part) eviscerated the Hapsburg heritage, counted the human cost of the dereliction immanent in those huge Tartar plains, and has a -Weg named after him, directly overlooking St Sebastian’s Friedhof, on the Kapuzinerberg where he lived.\n\nThe bust, now, to be found at the airport, of Christian Andreas Doppler (can I guess him to be a relative of Johann?—I haven’t been able to do all the necessary research, there must be allowed some holes, to breathe through)—born within metres of Mozart’s Wohnhaus, in 1803, died in Venice fifty years later—is cast however in bronze, not the familiar stone. Furthermore his phenomenal description, known to the English as the “Doppler Effect”, is here called “Doppler-Prinzip”. Cause and effect are not as automatic a sequence as we’d like to think. Cause and effect (I descend from A440 to A430 as the repeating sound waves lengthen) are not as automatic a sequence as we think we’d like… as likeable a sequence as we automatically think…]\n\nI was talking about heroes, heroics. Napoleon was once a hero to Beethoven, until he declared himself Emperor and had to be scratched from the title page of the Eroica—written at the same sort of time as Leonore. It’s maybe not so curious, then, to find echoes of this preoccupation with great men (and women) amongst the jumble of possibilities offered by a shake-up of Beethoven’s Leonore and Beethoven’s Fidelio (to be roughly precise, 230 shake-ups, Fidelio having the tiny edge). Less to be expected, though logical enough if you care to dwell on it, is that one should begin in an atmosphere half-Carlyle (“The Hero can be Poet, Prophet, King, Priest or what you will, according to the kind of world he finds himself born into”—Heroes and Hero-Worship, iii.) and half-Kipling. I append, first, a “translation” (one of finitely many possible) of the jumbly text, and, last, the (re)strained artefact itself.\n\nI owe thanks, indirectly to Nicholas McNair and John Eliot Gardiner (who laid on the raw material), directly to Charles Pott, consistent finder of most of the best individual anagrams (including the title), and essentially to Louis d’Antin van Rooten, author of Mots d’heures, gousses, rames, to Georges Perec, of course, and to those—or the One—responsible for Himmelreich.\n\nFinally, for any who wonder if I shouldn’t indicate the point where “Leonore” anagrams give way to “Fidelio”—I draw the line at that.\n\n____________________________________________________\n\nO BENEVOLENT HEROES\n\nStalky & Co.

Shoving the hapless Beetle forward, he suggests that a music-loving Roman emperor would draw the line at fellow Italian modernists: too subversive, and what’s more unacquainted with Nordic countries.\n\nThe same, apparently, could be said for the gifted, unhappy rulers of Ferrara, not least the lovely one who became married to Gesualdo. The only thing to do is concentrate on the job in hand, whittle a snowy-weather vacuum-cleaner which runs on glue. Tony Benn, who’s certainly not to be likened, in his loose diction, to C.S. Lewis’s wonderful talking horse, boy do you stir things up:\n\n“The only pershon to be compawed to Newo ish Beethoven!”\n\nHe’s not listened to: there’s more urgent matter. The very vacuum-cleaner’s been nicked: I don’t believe it, I retreat into my shack (the super cabana I staked out myself) and weep.\n\nA multi-national cricket (hockey? football?) competition is a severe rival to track athletics, especially when the star Kenyan’s injured his foot. He goes so far as to contemplate suicide, in Grecian mode, but Helen, dear reposeful one, rules this out, on pain of calling off her Anglo-Saxon lessons. This threat is not esteemed by a couple of more-or-less heavyweight members of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, who call upon a patriarch for help, but it’s left up to the Stage Manager, [2] alert, honourable, to pace around scenting trouble and sorting it out. When I say “pace”, I properly mean “jet”: he checks out Lancashire, the Home Counties, young navvies in south-east Asia, Italy, Africa… where an Afrikaner, salivating with envy, asks if he’s stayed in an Ibis hotel. Of course he has—but not in Egypt, probably only on the outskirts of a French provincial capital.\n\n[2] The Monteverdi stage manager at this time was Noel Mann (see * below).\n\nThe African connection turns up a more sinister figure: a Ugandan dictator, whose hurly-burly discourse bears nasty connotations of genocide (though pertinently pointing out that Beethoven’s heroine is not in fact Italian), hardly mitigated by attempts at Shakespeare. His interlocutors, perhaps maliciously taunting him with the Othello role he’d have loved, callously ditch him when another mountainous actor drops by. Trans-sexual badinage involving Spartan slavery and a voracious Russian threatens mayhem; but you only need to regard one bordel, one low-cut tee-shirt, to see that eroticism and spiritual affection aren’t remotely separate—they’re the same thing, whether in English or ancient Greek!\n\n* * *\n\nBehold an oboist at rest: except he never is, worrying about his reeds, his obbligato, the last to be heard still practicing in his hotel room before the bus leaves [this passage is inexplicably interspersed with culinary quotidia, as well as uncalled-for speculation on intra-musical relationships]; opining on tempi in what passes for early music nowadays, multiple instrument-making by an eccentric on the South Coast. Lazily he exhorts Sven (who will reappear) to rock on, man (though mistrusting the quality of his sound system, which appears antiquated), calls on my brother to drink to Robert Burt’s exhilarating song to freedom—and, to placate the authorities, ends up paying homage to the author of “La Disparition”, where no “e” is used, proposing a variety of fun lipograms, including “o” and “c”, all of which are turned down, most forcibly by an American law-enforcement agency:\n\n“You can’t trust your alumni, dammit, they can’t spell and they cover up their sloth by using the duplicating machine.”\n\nA Belgian woman, her accent influenced by long residence in the southern hemisphere, says Davie [3] —a friend of hers—gets very upset by not being able to use another vowel, but reckons he’s nothing better than a golfer who can’t complete a round, having played the first 7/18 of the course like an automaton.\n\nThe Ryder Cup captain, recalling unexpected speculation on waterbirds, agrees. So much for Divie.\n\n[3] See n.9 and ** in second part, amongst the anagrams.\n\n* * *\n\nLess is known than should be, perhaps, about the Gothic king who was born an Australian woman, descended from the celebrated gin family: who despite his/her facility for dismembering Celtic émigrés gained a reputation as a good man (/woman). Thus do sanguinary impulses and high culture go hand in hand; even the most austere of Japanese art-forms is welcomed.\n\nYet the threat of plague hangs over his house. Bovine spongiform encephaly has been identified in one of his pet hares—surely it can’t have reached Cornwall? A jumble of thoughts whirls around Otho’s brain, thus:\n\n“Get rid of that rodent Sussexman [4] on TV, he must of done it, I’ll make the old retainer sort him out. Or… was it an insect bite in Nevada? or the early closing times in Rostock? One’s friends’ girlfriends? Disappointment on Merseyside? Devil take it, even the best come to grief. Ooh…” (here a lateral thought carves a wolfish smile across his/her care-worn features) “Game, eh? Well, if not hare, then hoopoe? three poussins? tandoori venison?… oh, praise my Yugoslav aide’s heavenly logic! We dream of Eden, where the classics are easily available in authoritative parallel texts, and great Venetian painters’ (yes, including the one who did St Antony preaching to the fish) works can be enjoyed inalienably, without fear of predatory preemptions by the Getty Museum.” It’s an honourable vision.\n\n[4] Noel Osborne, distinguished Chichester publisher, bass singer and Cathedral volunteer (see n.10, among the anagrams)\n\n* * *\n\n“Is it really you?” Eve gasped.\n\n“It is,” Noel replied, “but do you mind if I call you Joyce? You’ve come to my help at such moments of need, as he did.”\n\n“Then – let me call you Dedalus! You’re so good to cyclostomes out in Dublin Bay, and you single-handedly keep the bar running. I’m only sorry you haven’t persuaded them to do dawn sugar-cups.”\n\n“You’re not telling me – oh, that cupbearer, ye Gods! She’s Greek, you see, she doesn’t seem to understand what I say. But – don’t take it into your own hands – ” Too late. Eve flung her bouquet of roses at Noel’s face, and, missing him, caught Liz, standing isolated apart, snagging her shirt.\n\n“Eve, don’t!” she cried, “these chapel flowers ruin my outfit!” And it’s ruined alright.\n\n“Yes, Eve, it’s all very well…”\n\nEthel broke in adventitiously, “ ’Ere, I do think Noelene idealises Noel, don’t you?” But Noel, intent on Eve, and spotting that the sun was over the yard-arm, offered her crustaceans; and, giggling, she was his.\n\n* * *\n\nI wish it weren’t the case that traditional Japanese theatre left even distinguished bass singers cold. But, mi love, don’t take it as a slur on west country mores, for there’s more at stake t"
