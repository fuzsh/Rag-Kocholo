        "text": "The state of English in Bangladesh in the twenty-first century is indeed all-embracing. The use and role of English in media, press, education, commerce, and industries, courts, information and technology, national and international communication signify that English is a highly functional language in this country. Such exhilarating linguistic circumstance of English raises a very significant linguistic issue: How and why has English become very pragmatic in the life of the people in Bangladesh. This article attempts to answer this question from a historical perspective. It analyzes the use and spread of English in Bangladesh since independence in 1971. It also gives evidence of the presence of English in the important domains of national life. Finally, the paper concludes with some recommendations towards bringing effective language policies that will remove the confusion regarding language use and allow people to use English for development purposes.\n\nThis paper aims to make a contribution to the study of history and evolution of English in Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a young country, twice-split once from India as a part of Pakistan and then from Pakistan as an independent nation. Therefore, to look at the history, we have to look at the history of English education first in India upto 1947, then in Pakistan (1947-1971) and then only in Bangladesh (since 1971 onwards). The paper begins with how English was brought into Bangladesh; language policy and use in Bangladesh; medium of instruction and also shed lights on the current status of English in Bangladesh.\n\nThis paper addresses the current importance of English in Bangladesh through an investigation of attitudes towards English by twenty-two Bangladeshi people living in Bangladesh and sixteen Bangladeshi immigrants in Australia. The findings suggest Bangladeshi people's general positive attitudes towards English irrespective of their current residential status either in Bangladesh or in Australia, gender, fluency in English, age, hours of watching English programs on TV, or code-switching to English while speaking Bengali. First, an overview of the historical and ongoing language situations and the place of English in Language policy, and current socioeconomic conditions in Bangladesh, will be provided. Second, the concept of attitudes, attitudes towards English in different countries, if they are affected by other variables and whether this kind of study might be useful for Bangladesh will be outlined. The following section will discuss the research questions and the methodology for the investigation. The penultimate section will present the results of the investigation, followed by discussion. The final section will conclude by outlining the research limitations and future research implications, with an emphasis on developing the language policy and curriculum in Bangladesh about this research outcome.\n\nOver the past few years, there has been a revival of interest in the English language in Bangladesh with the government putting a lot of emphasis on the teaching and learning of English. There have been a plethora of initiatives at the macro-level to strengthen English language education in urban as well as rural areas in the country which are to a certain extent complemented by micro-level initiatives at the family level. Parents aspire for their children to master the English language and spend on private tuition according to their abilities to ensure that learners achieve good results in English and other subjects. Young people, on their part, are keen to learn and use English alongside Bangla, sometimes mixing them together in the same breath in ways that appear outrageous and ridiculous to a lot of people holding tenaciously onto rather conservative views about roles and use of language in national identity formation. Although there is a general consensus that Bangladeshis need English to move ahead in the context of globalization, how English should be used, where and to what extent are issues that are far from being resolved. English is viewed both as an essential lingua franca and a threat to the vitality of Bangla. English is also often blamed for the perceived corruption of Bangla in the media. This paper focuses on the ambiguities and tensions surrounding the roles and use of English vis-Ã -vis Bangla in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 2016 World Bank report on worldwide per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) identified Bangladesh as a lower middle-income country based on its consistent GDP growth throughout last decade (World Bank, 2016). To maintain this growth rate and meet the radical demand for human resources in increasingly globalised world markets, the country needs to communicate more effectively with the outside world. Inevitably, this means improving the quality of English teaching and learning. The significance of English, as the globallingua franca, to Bangladeshi learners is at its zenith. In this developing country, however, economic constraints mean that funds allocated to education are limited compared to many other Southeast Asian countries (Habib & Adhikary, 2016). Even given the generally low level of educational standards in Bangladesh (Islam, 2015), the standard of English language teaching and learning has decreased alarmingly in recent years (Hamid, 2011). English language education in...\n\nLanguage is one of the strong driving forces in shaping the identity and culture of people of a community, therefore, issues related to language is always dealt with tact and imminence. One of the noteworthy traits of language is change and progressiveness, which is prevalent in Bangla (native language or L1 of Bangladesh) language as well. These changing trends of language include code switching/mixing tendency (Bangla, English or Hindi), violation of standard form of Bangla, transliteration of Bangla into English, use of English accent in pronouncing Bangla, deliberate attempt of young generation to use English as a fashion statement etc. This paper intends to explore the existing realities behind this linguistic changes and the impact of this changes on Bangla. To do so, examples of a few conversations from private radio amp Television channels and face book pages have been provided and analyzed to give a glimpse of the current linguistic situation of Bangladesh that is evident i..."
