        "text": "As part of the international project Teamwork2: “Combating Sexual Harassment in the Workplace”, the second in a series of planned workshops was held on April 30, 2024, at the Croatian Employers’ Association. The workshop participants, commissioners for protecting workers’ dignity, came from various companies and institutions, including the Faculty of Law, Zagreb Holding, Croatian Employers’ Association, Croatian Chamber of Economy, Croatian Radio Television, and Kumrovec Elementary School. The workshop was led by Nebojša Paunović, legal advisor to the Ombudswoman for Gender Equality, and Radojka Kraljević, a psychologist and associate professor at Libertas University.\n\nThe workshop aimed to develop a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment and violence, and to adopt an internal legal architecture for violence prevention, victim protection, perpetrator punishment, and reintegration into the collective.\n\nPaunović emphasized the importance of continuous education on gender equality for all employees, a concrete policy of gender and sexual equality, zero tolerance for non-consensual sexual relations, and the adoption of an internal legal architecture that enables effective victim protection and fair prosecution and punishment of perpetrators.\n\nDuring the workshop, participants discussed adapting legal and internal regulations to the institution, organizing general education on gender equality, professional education, and problems with punishment due to the difficulty of regulating the structure of sexual discrimination punishment.\n\nRadojka Kraljević led the workshop segment on establishing contact between the commissioner and the victim of workplace harassment. In the practical part of the workshop, a communication strategy and establishing contact with the victim were practiced. Participants learned how to ensure the necessary conditions for conversation, understand the emotional and physical state of the victim, familiarize themselves with the protocol of action and legal regulation. It was particularly emphasized that it is most important to ensure that the victim feels safe and a supportive atmosphere so that the report can be effectively carried out.\n\nSpecial attention was paid to reporting and presenting cases of sexual harassment in the media. Recommendations were made on how to report on workplace sexual harassment when it comes to the media, and in the practical part, good and bad practices in reporting were analyzed on prepared examples.\n\nEach company must adopt an internal legal framework according to which the commissioner operates. Despite possible formal-legal omissions, the victim must be protected. The court may refer to procedural errors, but the procedure does not necessarily have to be completed within eight days, but must be initiated within eight days.\n\nAccording to the regulations of the Faculty of Law in Zagreb, the procedure for extraordinary dismissal of the perpetrator, in the case of sexual harassment, must be carried out within eight days. Every employer is obliged to define their regulations and act according to them, and make them available.\n\nThe commissioner’s procedure sends a message about the employer’s equality and worker protection. Suppose it is a criminal offense, such as sexual harassment under Article 156 of the Criminal Code. In that case, a report must be submitted to the competent state attorney’s office, regardless of the victim’s position. Without the victim’s admission, the legal procedure cannot be carried out, and reporting may not be inclined if the victim does not want it. However, we must all report a criminal offense and report that we have information.\n\nThe final discussion and evaluation were conducted by Višnja Ljubičić, Ombudswoman for Gender Equality, and Lovorka Marinović, project manager in Croatia, president of the Center for New Initiatives. Lovorka Marinović thanked everyone for participating and expressed hope that this initiative will help everyone in their further work.\n\nVišnja Ljubičić, Ombudswoman for Gender Equality, emphasized that the Ombudswoman’s institution is available to all institutions for the development of legal architecture and internal acts for employers. She pointed out that victims of sexual discrimination often leave the labor market for a long time.\n\nLast year, nine criminal charges were filed, always with the consent of the victim. Sexual harassment is a taboo topic that is difficult to discuss. The role of the Ombudswoman includes protecting the identity and anonymity of the report. It is possible to act on an anonymous report, but the information must be well presented. Regardless of whether the reports are anonymous or with a name and surname, the Ombudswoman will conduct the procedure. However, victims need to report such incidents so that perpetrators can be properly prosecuted.\n\nIt was concluded that efforts need to be made to educate workers, employers, and students, and to raise awareness in society through education. Examples of good practice and equal rules for everyone are key to changing society. Through such initiatives, we can hope that society will change for the better.\n\nThe project is being implemented in seven countries: Greece, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Italy, Spain, and Belgium, and is funded by the European Union as part of the CERV program. In Croatia, the project is being implemented by the Center for New Initiatives in cooperation with the Office of the Ombudswoman for Gender Equality.\n\nInternational Women’s Day was marked through various events throughout the day. In the morning, we participated in demonstrations at Markov Square, followed by the award ceremony for Woman of the Year, honoring Sanja Sarnavka, a prominent feminist. Later, we joined the Night March. However, the most significant part of our day was speaking about sexual harassment during the Women’s Film Festival at the Trešnjevka Cultural Center, located in the oldest working-class neighborhood, at 7:00 PM. – ZAGREB – Park Stara Trešnjevka 1.\n\nWe joined the fight against workplace sexual harassment! The Women’s Film Festival and One Billion Rising invited us to an interesting and important event on International Women’s Day, March 8, 2024, at 7:00 PM. The event opened our eyes and inspired us to take action.\n\nFirst, we watched the classic Croatian film “From 3 to 22” from 1967, directed by Krešo Golik (Zagreb Film), which portrayed the position of women in society.\n\nThis segment of the WFF program was part of a European project conducted in collaboration with the Gender Equality Ombudsman and the Center for New Initiatives, addressing the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace. The project had already conducted workshops with employees from HRT, ADU, HUP, and other organizations. They’d also launched a Help Desk at the Gender Equality Ombudsman to report cases and provide legal assistance. Future steps included a media campaign in partnership with the Women’s Film Festival and the creation of a new handbook applicable to all EU countries involved in the project. Additionally, they planned to establish collaboration agreements with journalists’ unions.\n\nAfter the film, we participated in a panel discussion on “Sexual Harassment in the Workplace and the Importance of Unions”, featuring distinguished experts:\n\nVišnja Ljubičić, Gender Equality Ombudsman\n\nRadojka Kraljević, Psychologist\n\nLovorka Marinović, Center for New Initiatives in the Workplace\n\nMaja Sever, President of the Journalists’ Union and President of the European Federation of Journalists (as the moderator)\n\nDanijela Stanojević, Artistic Director and Producer of WFF/OBR(opening and closing remarks)\n\nOn February 6, 2024, an international conference on combating sexual harassment in the workplace was held at the European House of Europe in Zagreb. The conference addressed the issue of sexual harassment, which is a common and serious occurrence that undermines the dignity and safety of workers, particularly women. Many victims hesitate to report such incidents due to fear of job loss, stigmatization, and lack of trust in institutions. Society often downplays or justifies violence, sending discouraging messages to victims.\n\nDuring the meeting, which took place in Zagreb, representatives from organizations implementing the project in Belgium, Spain, Bulgaria, Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Croatia decided to continue media campaigns and awareness-raising efforts until the end of the year. Additionally, they plan to create a handbook that explains the reporting systems and mechanisms for addressing workplace sexual harassment.\n\nThe “Teamwork 2” project, funded by the European Union through the Rights, Equality, and Citizenship program, focuses on preventing and addressing cases of sexual harassment in the workplace. The project aims to educate and empower victims, employers, trade unions, and civil society organizations to recognize, report, and address violence. It also seeks to improve mechanisms for victim protection and perpetrator accountability.\n\nThirteen civil society organizations from seven European countries—Croatia, Greece, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Cyprus—participate in the project alongside the Gender Equality Ombudswoman. Together, they aim to establish a functional victim protection system through the “Teamwork 2” initiative.\n\nNikos Moraitis, from the Industrial and Business Training Institute in Greece, succinctly described the project as follows: raising awareness in companies about the issue of sexual harassment in the workplace, empowering workers to come forward and report incidents of sexual harassment, and assisting companies in improving their mechanisms to combat sexual harassment through workshops and education.\n\nLovorka Marinović, from the Center for New Initiatives, highlighted a grim reality based on statistical data from the UNDP’s Gender Social Norms Index. Over the past decade, there has been no improvement in attitudes toward women. The research, conducted across 80 countries representing 80% of the world’s population, revealed the following:\n\n49% of respondents believe that men make better politicians than women.\n\nOnly 27% think that gender equality is crucial for democracy.\n\n46% believe that men have greater rights in the workplace.\n\n25% consider it acceptable for a man to physically harm his partner.\n\nThese findings did not surprise Daša Šilović from the Central and East European Network for Gender Issues. She emphasized that this project aims to confront a culture of violence, particularly in our region. The roots of this violence lie in wars, poverty, fear, and hopelessness, which then manifest across various levels. The issue of power dynamics plays a crucial role—those who are stronger and dominant perpetuate violence. Real change requires policy shifts at decision-making levels; merely taking to the streets is insufficient. The problem persists universally, even when laws exist but are not effectively enforced due to political indifference.\n\nNebojša Paunović, a legal advisor at the Office of the Ombudswoman for Gender Equality, emphasized that they are partners in the project and that the Ombudswoman offers assistance and support to victims of sexual harassment. He highlighted that through education and continuous training, sensitivity to such offenses is developed, and victims are empowered with the help of their surroundings. By reporting incidents, victims understand the purpose of their complaint. He encouraged both women and men to reach out to the Ombudswoman if they experience sexual harassment in the workplace and their employer fails to protect them. He emphasized that the Office will penalize employers who do not provide mechanisms to safeguard workers’ dignity.\n\nAs part of Project Teamwork 2, several companies and public institutions in Croatia will undergo training to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. Each of us can take action starting tomorrow by not turning a blind eye to violence but instead assisting victims and standing up against perpetrators."
