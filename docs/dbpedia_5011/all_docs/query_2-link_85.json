        "text": "\"Remote Learning During the Global School Lockdown: Multi-Country Lessons” and “Remote Learning During COVID-19: Lessons from Today, Principles for Tomorrow\"\n\nWHY A TWIN REPORT ON THE IMPACT OF COVID IN EDUCATION?\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted education in over 150 countries and affected 1.6 billion students. In response, many countries implemented some form of remote learning. The education response during the early phase of COVID-19 focused on implementing remote learning modalities as an emergency response. These were intended to reach all students but were not always successful. As the pandemic has evolved, so too have education responses. Schools are now partially or fully open in many jurisdictions.\n\nA complete understanding of the short-, medium- and long-term implications of this crisis is still forming. The twin reports analyze how this crisis has amplified inequalities and also document a unique opportunity to reimagine the traditional model of school-based learning.\n\nWHAT CAN YOU FIND IN EACH REPORT?\n\nThe reports were developed at different times during the pandemic and are complementary:\n\nThe first one follows a qualitative research approach to document the opinions of education experts regarding the effectiveness of remote and remedial learning programs implemented across 17 countries. DOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT\n\nThe second one uses mixed-methods to examine how countries adopted different remote learning strategies, analyzing the take up, but also documenting -when available- the effectiveness of remote learning during COVID-19. This publication not only documents lessons being learned but also provides countries with principles to reimagine learning tomorrow. DOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT\n\nWHAT ARE THE LESSONS LEARNED OF THE TWIN REPORTS?"
