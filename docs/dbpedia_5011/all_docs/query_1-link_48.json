The support of the RCC, the European Commission and the EBU in this respect is extremely valuable.”\n\nThe aim of the agreement is to enable staff at all levels to meet present and future challenges; and strengthen contribution of the public service media to the development of modern, democratic societies in South East Europe, through a set of activities enhancing the public service remit of the signatories.\n\nMehmed Agovic, Director General of the Radio-Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina, highlighted the extraordinary importance of the Protocol for strengthening the mission and credibility of the public service media in South East Europe.\n\n“For us, at the BHRT, the Protocol provides a possibility to keep abreast with technological advances in the field of electronic media and be ready to work in a digital environment.”\n\nThe signing of the Protocol was supported by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). A European Union representative also took part in the meeting.\n\nThe third Meeting of the Education Committee of the Association was held in advance of the Protocol signing, on 29 September 2011.\n\nThe Protocol on Regional Cooperation in Education and Training among members of the European Association of Public Service Media in South East Europe is available HERE."
