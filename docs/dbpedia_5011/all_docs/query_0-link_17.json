By using the Website you are accepting the terms of this Privacy Notice.\n\nLegal basis\n\nWe are only processing your personal data because you have given us specific consent or because such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party. When the legal basis of the processing is consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of any processing carried out before the withdrawal of consent.\n\nPersonal data collected\n\nWe collect personal data relating to you (referred to hereinafter as “Personal Data”) in two ways, through registration and through cookies.\n\nRegistration may be required to access certain pages of our Website or to register to certain of our events. It may be done via email or via third-party registration tools.\n\nTo access restricted parts of our Website a log-in is required.

In any event, prior to using Personal Data for other purposes, our Privacy Notice will be updated and we will inform you of the change. For consent-based activities, we will not process your Personal Data for new purposes without first obtaining your consent.\n\nSpecial categories of personal data\n\nTo ensure optimal onsite access to our events, we may ask you to let us know if you have a disability that would require implementation of special measures to facilitate your attendance, or if you have any dietary restrictions. We will not collect or process any other special category of personal data relating to you, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or other beliefs of a similar nature, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data for uniquely identifying a natural person, health, sex life or sexual orientation.\n\nDirect marketing\n\nWe will not use your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes without your explicit prior consent, except where authorised under applicable law.\n\nIf at any time you decide to no longer receive commercial or promotional information from us, you may, free of charge and without providing any justification, opt out of any direct marketing campaigns and oppose future processing of your Personal Data for such purposes on this page. Alternatively, you may use the opt-out procedure provided in any promotional message you receive from us.\n\nPlease note that opting out from receiving promotional messages from us will not prevent you from receiving information that relates to any contract you may have entered into with us.\n\nNo automated decision-making\n\nWe will not make use of automated decision-making processes, including profiling, except where authorised under applicable law.

You may obtain a copy of the safeguards we have implemented or information as to where your data has been made available by filling in the appropriate form on this page.\n\nUse of cookies\n\nCookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or other device by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the website.\n\nGeneral information about the cookies used\n\nWhen you visit our Website for the first time, the entry page will show information on privacy through a “cookie banner” allowing you to provide your consent to the use of specific cookies or to reject them and manage cookies preferences.\n\nWe may also use cookies which are required for technical reasons and for which we do not require your consent. For additional information about specific cookies click here.\n\nTo set your cookie preferences click on the button below.\n\nSharing on social networks\n\nWe use a social plug-in to enable you to share our Website’s information on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other Social Media platforms of your choice through “Share” buttons.\n\nFor data privacy reasons, we have deliberately opted against the use of direct social network plug-ins on our Website. Instead, we employ an alternative technical solution that allows you to decide whether to transmit data to the social network operators and when. Thus when you visit the Website, data is never automatically transmitted to a social network. Only when you actively click on the respective button yourself will your web browser connect to the servers of the social network, i.e. clicking on elements and then clicking on the social network’s icon indicates your consent to your browser connecting to the servers of the social network and sending data to that social network operator, whether or not you are a subscriber of that social network.\n\nWe have no influence over the nature or scope of data that social networks may then gather. For information regarding the purpose and scope of data collection, further processing and use of data by social networks and regarding your data privacy rights and relevant configuration settings, see the social networks’ respective data privacy advisories.\n\nLinks to third party websites\n\nOn certain sections of this Website, we provide links to third party websites which are not subject to this Privacy Notice. This may notably the case for third party registration tools used for registering to our events. These links are provided as a convenience to you; however please be aware that we have no control over these third parties or their websites and that they will have a different privacy notice applying to information collected from you when you are on their websites. We encourage you to read the privacy notices of all websites carefully before providing personally identifiable information.\n\nStorage duration\n\nWe will retain your Personal Data only as long as necessary for the fulfilment of the purposes described above or as required by applicable data retention laws and statutory limitation periods for claims\n\nSecurity and confidentiality\n\nWe have implemented technical and organisational measures in accordance with standard industry practices to ensure an appropriate level of security of the Personal Data processed. Nevertheless, security requires efforts from all parties involved. We thus encourage you to contribute to these efforts by taking appropriate security measures yourself, including by using strong passwords and keeping all user names and passwords (if any) confidential.\n\nChildren on the Website\n\nThis Website is not intended for or directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect any information from such individuals. If you believe your child has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at privacy@ebu.ch.\n\nYour rights\n\nAt any time, you may exercise your right to request access to, rectification of, and, as the case may be, erasure of any Personal Data relating to you. You may also object to data processing or request a restriction of processing and benefit from a right to data portability (as the case may be), in compliance with applicable data protection law. You may do so by fulfilling a specific request form accessible on our dedicated Data Subject Rights online platform.\n\nWhere applicable, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time, this does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent made prior to such withdrawal.\n\nAs a data subject, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in particular in the Member State of the European Union of your usual place of residence, your place of work or the place where the violation occurred) if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the applicable legislation relating to data protection.\n\nData protection officer\n\nWe have designated a data protection officer whose contact email address is dpo@ebu.ch. You may contact our data protection officer with regard to all issues related to the processing of your Personal Data and to the exercise of your rights under the applicable national and European legislation relating to data protection.\n\nRepresentative in the European Union\n\nWe have designated EBU UER AISBL, Avenue des Arts 56, 1000 Brussels, Belgium as our representative in the European Union.\n\nEffective date and changes\n\nThis Privacy Notice is effective from 24 May 2018. We reserve the right, at our complete discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. We encourage you to check this page periodically to read the most recent version of this Privacy Notice as a continued use of this Website after the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you acknowledge these changes.\n\nThank you for visiting this Website."
