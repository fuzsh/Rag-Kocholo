        "text": "IMPROVING THE NORMATIVE FRAMEWORK FOR THE MEDIA\n\nImplementation of the measure began on 1 April 2018 and will last until 30 August 2020\n\nLeader of the measure MINISTRY OF CULTURE\n\nDescription of the measure\n\nWhich public issue does the measure address? The recession which began in 2008 had a negative effect on all types of\n\nmedia in Croatia. As a result of reduced revenues from advertising,\n\nbetween 2010 and 2015 the number of journalists fell, and many media\n\nhouses ceased to operate. The development of technology and\n\nconvergences, access to broadband internet and the invasion of\n\nsmartphones radically changed the media ecosystem. The boundary\n\nbetween electronic and printed media became blurred, as both now had\n\nextensions via many non-linear services. On the Croatia media market, we\n\nneed to bear in mind that regulation and support must include all media:\n\npublic, commercial (electronic and print) and non-profit. The sustainability\n\nof media products with contents of public interest must be the obligation of\n\nall participants, while of course the public and non-profit media have a\n\nspecial role. Foreign entertainment media contents dominate all platforms,\n\nwhether linear or non-linear, so that domestic products and the European\n\nparts would barely be able to survive on the competitive global market\n\nwere it not for envisaged quotas. As part of talks on the revision of the\n\nAVMS Directive, there has been much discussion of how the quota system\n\nand option of gathering resources for producing and distributing European\n\nAV and encouraging media pluralism can be assured, through a regime of\n\nregulating non-linear platforms and services.\n\nIn Croatia, the enforcement of the Media Act has not been assured, which\n\nhas had a largely negative effect on respecting journalism ethics and\n\nstandards in general (the pressure of the market economy). Today, there\n\nis increasing talk of 'fake news' and the lack of editorial accountability,\n\nparticularly on all non-linear platforms. Croatia is one of only a few\n\ncountries which does not have a regulatory body for print or some form of\n\nPress Council.\n\n51\n\nIt is necessary to strengthen co-regulation and self-regulation as models\n\nwhich contribute in a significant way to restoring damaged professional\n\njournalism standards and raising awareness of the phenomenon of 'fake\n\nnews'. In this context, the issue of public trust in the media is very\n\nimportant, along with the issue of developing media literacy in\n\nparticularly. Protecting minors and fighting hate speech are special\n\nchallenges in regulating non-linear services.\n\nIn media legislation and the production of support models, it is necessary\n\nto define potential non-profit media service providers. The key term of\n\nreference used to define non-profit media/public service providers should\n\nnot be reduced to mere registration of the founder, but should primarily\n\nconcern the provision of content of particular public interest. This kind of\n\ndefinition would on the whole answer the real need to increase the\n\nnumber of non-profit media, and would make it easier to bring some\n\nelectronic media closer to the concept of a 'media community', which still\n\nneeds to be worked out in detail.\n\nWhat does the measure include? The implementation of the measure will guarantee a new normative\n\nframework to enable a more functional system for working in the new\n\ndigital environment, and assure more transparent work, protection of\n\njournalists, and access to support resources.\n\nThe establishment of working groups is needed to produce the draft\n\nElectronic Media Act, Media Act, and an in-depth analysis, including, if\n\nnecessary, amendments to the Croatian Radio and Television Act and the\n\nCroatian News Agency Act.\n\nAll stakeholders to whom the provisions of these Acts apply will participate\n\nin the working groups, from non-profit media service providers to state\n\nadministration bodies, and when the draft document is ready, consultations\n\nwill be held with the interested public.\n\nHow does the measure contribute to resolving the public\n\nissue?\n\nAmendments to the normative framework will facilitate the work of the\n\nmedia in the new conditions of the digital society, the publication of\n\ninformation on the proprietors of all media to the level of physical\n\npersons, the publication of relevant information linked to the work of the\n\nmedia, and the further development of media literacy.\n\n52\n\nWhy is this measure relevant to the values of the Open\n\nGovernment Partnership?\n\nThe measure is relevant to the more transparent, more efficient work of\n\nthe media.\n\nAdditional information Resources are guaranteed in the State Budget, section Ministry of\n\nCulture P3901, A564000 – within the regular work of the Ministry of\n\nCulture.\n\nActivities Implementation start date Implementation end date\n\n8.1.

Improving legal provisions related to the transparency of media ownership\n\nProposal for changes to the relevant legislative framework to allow the transparency of information on media proprietors to the level of physical persons (reusable, easily searchable, open code format).\n\nStart date: 1 April 2018\n\nEnd date: 30 August 2020\n\nContext and Objectives\n\nThis commitment strives to ensure greater transparency and independence of media and primarily involves legislative changes for media activities. [65] This commitment builds on milestones from the second OGP action plan, [66] two of which were aimed at increasing transparency via legal changes. At the time, the Ministry of Culture envisaged a new media policy [67] to feed into the legislative changes. However, this media policy creation process held back implementation of activities in both milestones. Exacerbating the matter, the launch of the new media policy and legislation was postponed indefinitely since parliamentary elections held in November 2015. [68]\n\nIn recent years, media freedoms and the state of the media in Croatia have seen a noticeable decline. A 2016 report on media freedoms in Croatia [69] noted political interference in the Croatian public broadcaster (HRT), increasing public intimidation of critical media, continued impunity for physical attacts against journalists, [70] the use of criminal slander and libel legislation to silence investigative journalism, and a reduced arena for media pluralism, including minority and nonprofit media. This is corroborated by the World Press Freedom Index [71] and relevant CSOs in Croatia. [72] In this context, the commitment aims to ensure changes to the Electronic Media Act (Milestone 8.1), the Media Act (8.2) and to legal provisions related to media ownership transparency (8.3). The commitment is specific and verifiable, and is relevant to access to information, as all proposed legislative changes will improve the existing media environment. The last milestone will create a registry of beneficial ownership of the media in reusable and searchable open code, making it relevant for use of technology and innovation to improve transparency and accountablity. Various organizations are represented in drafting the laws in question, including several CSOs, making this commitment relevant to civic participation. In that regard, the envisioned proposal for the Electronic Media Act, followed by the umbrella Media Act, and other media legislation should achieve a more transparent and effective media environment.\n\nFor comparison, current media regulation and support does not include all media (i.e., public, commercial, electronic and print, and nonprofit), which is important for supporting domestic media production. It is also important to ensure the new legislation alligns with the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which was adopted by the European Parliament in late 2018, [73] especially in encouraging of media pluralism via regulating non-linear platforms and services. [74] There are also issues regarding journalism ethics and standards, lack of editorial accountability, and increasing problems with \"fake news,\" particularly on non-linear platforms. This commitment also aims to improve the low level of public trust in the media and legal definition of potential nonprofit media service providers (\"community media\").\n\nThis commitment is moderate in its scale and scope, as transparency in media ownership could reduce the risk of media monopolies, prevent political interference and corruption, and decrease backhanded dealings in media enterprises.\n\nNext steps\n\nDuring action plan implementation, the IRM researcher reccomends the Ministry of Culture does the following:\n\nInclude strong regulations to erradicate the key problems with media freedoms, especially political interference, intimidation of journalists and their employers, reduced space for nonprofit, minority, and community media in general;\n\nEnsure representation of all relevant stakeholders: independent media experts, CSOs dealing with media freedoms and democratic values, the academic sector, journalist and media professional associations, etc. Use established mechanisms of sharing important information with the interested public.\n\nShould the government continue working on this issue, the next action plan could include:\n\nStimulating investigative journalism in Croatia by reducing or abolishing the use of criminal slander and libel legislation on journalists and their employers;\n\nOpening more media data and information to the public, such as information on beneficial ownership of all media outlets, especially electronic media.\n\n[64] Editorial note: The text contained herein is the abridged version of the commitment.
