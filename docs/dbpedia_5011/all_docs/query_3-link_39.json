There is nothing wrong with sceptical opinions; the important thing is to be sceptical in a constructive way, without the influence of prevailing disinformation or political bias.\n\nFIGHTING MODE: That’s when media literacy comes in! We facilitate access to clear information about the most relevant and latest policies implemented by EU in this field, fighting fake news which inevitably nourish Euroscepticism.\n\nMEDIA LITERACY DOESN’T STAND ALONE: Media literacy plays a key role also in detecting and discerning the impact of other policies, cornerstones of the development of EU.\n\nNowadays, for example, environmental communication is a field that straddles many disciplines. It isn’t any more just about science. It is related to media studies, advertising, marketing and public relations. Being media literate provides a powerful key to understanding the field as a whole. Thanks to social media, people are now sensible to threats to the ecological systems that were less visible in the past and might go unnoticed. Community involvement is important, but viewers should have the right tools to fully comprehend EU environmental news and policies.\n\nSO WHAT? THE ERADICATION PHASE: Euroscepticism has long been utilised by populist and right-wing parties who capitalize on domestic difficulties by blaming the EU, thereby not finding real solutions, rather creating an imaginary enemy in the “other”. This propaganda often falls into the category of disinformation and even hate speech.\n\nThe 2019 European Parliamentarian Elections are coming and we all need to save Europe from this disinformation and propaganda. EAVI’s contribution to this is by way of its media literacy tool, which allows us to critically analyse the information which individuals are exposed to.

It is our mission is to prevent Euroscepticism turning into hate speech and propaganda in all forms of media.\n\nABOUT US: At EAVI, we believe:\n\nEuroscepticism is not bad per se, but it needs to be applied cautiously in order to not develop into hate speech;\n\nThe EU is not perfect, but it’s best of all possible worlds at the moment;\n\nYoung people took the benefits of EU citizenship for granted, if they are reminded of the benefits, they are more likely to be politically active to keep them.\n\nHere, you will find all our activities launched to fight Euroscepticism, spreading information and knowledge about EU policies, relevant for the sake of European Union and its citizens in the years to come.\n\nOur approach consists in underlining how media and digital literacy can break down false claims about EU, unfortunately more and more nourished by increasingly wide spread disinformation.\n\nCan media literacy break down Euroscepticism?\n\nDEFINITION: Euroscepticism is an attitude of extreme criticism of EU policies and its integration processes, which is not dangerous in and of itself.
