It was founded in 2004 as a B2B music services company building music download stores for brands and retailers. In 2005 it launched a direct to consumer store offering digital rights management free downloads.\n\nAAJA Asia\n\nAsia chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association\n\nThe Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA) is a membership, non-profit educational and professional organization with more than 1,500 members across the United States and Asia. It is committed to advancing diversity in newsrooms and ensuring fair and accurate coverage of black, Asian and ethnic minority communities.\n\nABC News (Australia)\n\nNews broadcaster\n\nABC News in Australia submitted its performance for the March 2021 challenge. Overall ABC News saw 51% female representation - and 75% of their participating teams reached 50:50, compared to 29% when they first joined the project.\n\nEmma Pearce and Rhiannon Hobbins\n\n50:50 Equality Project Leads\n\nOnce the coronavirus pandemic began to dominate global headlines in March 2020, ABC News' 50:50 Project team swiftly realised we needed to rethink our plans for the remainder of the year.\n\nWith leaders in health and policy skewing male, both globally and domestically, our coverage of the COVID-19 response meant our gender balance data started to follow suit. So, we asked teams what support they needed from us to stay on track with the 50:50 Project.\n\nWe also asked them to consider how the pandemic was specifically impacting Australian women, to tell the story of the health crisis in a way that surfaced womenâs perspectives and gave voice to those on the frontline - nurses, doctors, care workers and teachers. In consultation with female representatives and organisations, we told stories of home-schooling, flexible working, the need for cheaper childcare and the increased âmental loadâ experienced by women as they found themselves doing even more on the home, work and family fronts.\n\nOne unexpected benefit quickly emerged: Some teams found it easier to reach and engage female talent, particularly in our afternoon and evening timeslots. As working from home became the norm, school pick-ups and commuter runs no longer affected availability to do a quick Zoom, Skype or Slack interview.\n\nOur 50:50 work fed into and enhanced our journalism...(alerting) our teams to the need to empower and respect the agency of women at the centre of the stories.\n\nâ Emma Pearce and Rhiannon Hobbins, ABC News\n\nAs we continued to sign new teams up, our data for female representation flatlined for about six months at 45%. So, in August 2020, we launched a 10-week challenge to inspire teams to achieve 50% by the end of the year, building a toolkit of ways to increase the number of women in their stories. We saw steady progress with many teams achieving our target of at least 50% and an overall final figure of 49.4% female representation.\n\nIn early 2021 a series of major stories concerning the treatment of women in politics and the culture faced by women working in Canberra Parliament House put gender equality issues at the top of the news agenda. Our 50:50 work fed into and enhanced our journalism on these issues, with our coverage incorporating female perspectives and the specific impacts on women and our teams alert to the need to empower and respect the agency of women at the centre of the stories.\n\nIn March 2021, ABC News held another community engagement event with Australian womenâs organisations and NGOs to report on the projectâs achievements and enlist their help as we expand this work to include greater representation of disabled, Indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse communities.\n\nAlongside this event, in March we again challenged content teams to push to achieve the 50:50 goal. Our overall figure for the month was 51% female representation -- and 75% of our participating teams reached 50:50, compared to 29% when we first joined the project.\n\nAmanda Shalala, ABC Sport\n\nABC News 50:50 Sport\n\nAt the beginning of 2020, the ABC News network sports department made a commitment to increase our coverage of women in sport, include more women in our stories, and grow our female audience. The task was relatively simple in summer, which is the peak period for elite womenâs sport in Australia. But the reality is for most of the year, the daily news cycle is dominated by menâs sport, and so weâve had to think of other ways to bring women to the front.\n\nThe biggest factor in making this happen has been having a dedicated womenâs sport reporter creating original content, and driving broader strategy and implementation. In this role, I also track the talent we use and the number of women in sport stories we produce on a monthly basis, and report back to our wider team. This is a crucial part of the process â we need to see what progress weâre making to highlight our achievements but also to monitor areas for improvement.\n\nOne of our special projects this year has been the creation of a digital first video series called âIn Her Wordsâ, looking at various challenges facing women in sport at all levels such as fertility struggles, cultural barriers, body image issues, transphobia and maternity protections.\n\nUltimately, itâs a long game for us, but we believe we can reach an equal playing field.\n\nâ Amanda Shalala, ABC Sport\n\nWeâve found itâs important not just to profile elite or professional sportswomen, but also the everyday people who engage in sport and physical activity â as their stories are often more relatable and appeal to more women, beyond the rusted-on sports fans.\n\nSport intersects with so many parts of society so weâve looked to other divisions within ABC News, like business, parenting, health, to see what has worked for them, and what we can learn to help achieve our aims.\n\nWhen we are covering menâs sport, we try and bring women into the conversation as experts, whether theyâre commentators, current/former athletes and coaches, academics, executives, etc.\n\nItâs been important to get buy in from across the organisation too. The entire ABC News team is dedicated to 50:50, giving our reporters the motivation to pursue more womenâs sport stories, as they know it ties into one of our core goals. It also means that when we produce this content, itâs given a chance to succeed, by being given appropriate air time, or space on our websiteâs front page. We know that womenâs sport can attract a huge audience â it just needs to be given a platform.\n\nAnd even when weâre in the midst of the male dominated winter season, thereâs no excuse not to feature women in sport. There are countless amazing stories ready to be shared, it just takes some initiative to find them. Ultimately, itâs a long game for us, but we believe we can reach an equal playing field.\n\nAddleshaw Goddard\n\nLaw firm\n\nAddleshaw Goddard submitted the proportion of their spokespeople that were women for the March challenge. 59% of their speakers were women, compared 42% when the law firm first joined the project.\n\nJustine Delroy\n\nPartner and Co-head of Gender Diversity, Addleshaw Goddard LLP\n\nIn October, we became the first law firm to join as a 50:50 Partner. Raising the external profile of women further is crucial in the legal sector. Not only is reputation part of the route to success in law (seeing your name in the media means you are being recognised as a specialist), it is also important for younger lawyers to see positive female role models with strong voices in senior positions.\n\nThe 50:50 Project came to our attention as something unique, using data to evoke change. We initially chose to start tracking the number of women contributors in media relations. From November, driven by AG's communications team, we started to count every male and female voice put forward for media opportunities, press releases and awards submissions. We continue to keep count and share our data with the 50:50 team monthly, as well as internally, in an email from our senior partner to the whole firm.\n\nWe collaborated with our technology team to create a new digital platform - High Q â which means we are able to log every single interaction and create visual charts displaying an overall percentage breakdown of female versus male voices for that month. It also shows which practice areas are most active, details on the individuals (seniority, location) and what type of media activity we have put them forward for.\n\nThe data we have collected so far shows that we need to do further work in certain areas, and we have committed to discovering new female voices within the firm.\n\nâ Justine Delroy, Addleshaw Goddard\n\nItâs early days, but the project has already had a big impact. The collection of the data means we can drive change and measure what we control without compromising on quality. The data we have collected so far shows that we need to do further work in certain areas, and we have committed to discovering new female voices within the firm. We are also developing a media training programme to train more women to talk about traditionally male-dominated legal practice areas like private equity and M&A, as well as conducting a media training session for younger, female lawyers including legal directors and managing associates.\n\nWe are also planning to apply the methodology more widely, specifically in client engagement opportunities when we pitch for new business and then in internal communications (with more women leading internal events). This is particularly important when looking at career paths, as a lot of success stems from influencing people within your own firm. There is also the scope to widen the project to increase our representation of people from ethnicity minority backgrounds.\n\nAshoka University\n\nHigher Education\n\nAshoka University is a Liberal Arts and Sciences University. Ashoka says that its aim is to help students become well-rounded individuals who can think critically about issues from multiple perspectives, communicate effectively and become leaders with a commitment to public service.\n\nAsia-Pacific Broadcasting Union\n\nBroadcasting association\n\nThe Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union is a non-profit, professional association of broadcasting organisations.

The ABU covers an area stretching from Turkey in the west to Samoa in the east, and from Mongolia in the north to New Zealand in the south.\n\nAsian College of Journalism\n\nPostgraduate journalism school\n\nThe Asian College of Journalism (ACJ) has collaborated with the BBCâS 50:50 Equality Project since early 2020. Six of their core faculty members are actively involved in the project.\n\nOn the ACJ website, they write: \"The aim of the project is to achieve gender balance in news gathering, by reporters and contributors. While more than 50% of ACJ comprises women students, we try to sensitise all students in awareness of gender imbalances while collecting material for their stories. How many women are interviewed and how many women experts are consulted by reporters while working on their stories? Once this awareness is created, there will be some attempt by our students to consciously strive for gender balance, wherever possible, in storytelling.\"\n\nAudio Always\n\nIndependent production company\n\n100% of Audio Always content reach 50:50 in March 2021 compared to 75% when they first started monitoring.

BR operates broadcast centres in Munich and Nuremberg and over twenty regional offices throughout Bavaria.\n\nVeronika Wagner\n\nBayerischer Rundfunk\n\nâThere are no women.â These words may sound familiar to editorial staff, especially to those working in male-dominated fields like science, sport and politics. At the Bayerischer Rundfunk something remarkable happened since becoming a 50:50 partner: You barely hear this phrase anymore within the 50:50 teams.\n\nBuilding on this great BBC initiative, we were able to initiate profound change. All our teams are highly motivated and ambitious to get female voices on air. Of course it's challenging, especially under time pressure. 50:50 has not only increased awareness but has also sparked enthusiasm within the teams, which is the best way for sustainable, positive change.\n\nAnd data proves that we are on the right track. Six months after joining the 50:50 Project, 73% of the teams increased female representation and70% reached gender balance of their contributors in at least one month.

We created by it around the idea of uniting around issues from different perspectives.\n\nUnity for us means the him and her conversation.

For some specialist titles tailored targets for increasing womenâs representation were set to reflect the workforce of their sector. All titles improved their female representation compared to when they first joined. The most dramatic improvement was at Ground Engineering magazine, which went from 0% women representation in their first month to 39% in March 2021.\n\nMartin Quinn\n\nHeadlinemoney, Head of Sales and EMAP 50:50 Lead\n\nItâs safe to say 2020 was a very tough year for all trade magazine titles. COVID-19 led to a decline in advertising revenue and as companies cut costs, print costs have simultaneously risen while shifting many of our Awards and events online means they are less profitable.\n\nIn spite of the ongoing health crisis, we have kept up the momentum on 50:50 The Equality Project. It had already been adopted across our financial titles (headlinemoney, Mortgage Strategy and Money Marketing) in 2019, but we have now moved the project further into other traditionally male-dominated sectors like engineering, architecture, and petroleum refining.\n\nSuccesses have included New Civil Engineer, tracking the gender split across events, podcasts and the features on the website and in the print magazine, and their sister title Ground Engineering who joined the project at the start of 2021.\n\nA big thanks to editors Claire Smith and Nia Kajastie for proving change can happen even in a very male-dominated industry: Just 12% of engineers in the UK are women according to Engineering UK. The Architectural Review has also joined the project.\n\nParticipation in 50:50 gives us a benchmark from which the industry can work to make women leaders more visible, which in turn will have the effect of attracting and including talent from a more diverse range of demographics.\n\nâ Jill Geoghegan, Drapers\n\nDrapers magazine, which covers the fashion sector, has used the 50:50 Project to highlight the additional burden the pandemic has placed on women, particularly in terms of career prospects in retail alongside extra family responsibilities.\n\nDrapers acting editor Jill Geoghegan said: âAs the voice of the fashion retail industry, we take our responsibilities in representation and commitment to the 50:50 project seriously.\n\nâOur International Womenâs Day content plus 50:50 Challenge Month is highlighting the contribution of female professionals to business.

The Mortgage Strategy edition for March was particularly impressive. Editor Rebekah Commane said 26 out of 28 content pages in the issue were âeither written by women or were about equality in the mortgage profession, so we are very proud of the end resultâ.\n\nAcross EMAP we now have nine trade titles involved in 50:50 and the editorial teams are making a real difference in their published content to reflect their specialist audiences.\n\nEmpart Media\n\nDigital media outlet\n\nEmpart Media is an independent media outlet producing online content that aims to amplify the voices of the unheard by raising awareness, inspiring conversation and facilitating change.

We know from research that visible role models are key to inspiring people into different careers, so encouraging companies to think about the diverse, credible voices they can use externally will help attract a wider range of people to our sector.\n\nAs an industry, we are working hard to improve diversity of all kinds, at all levels, and we encourage energy companies to join 50:50 and challenge themselves to think carefully about the voices they use to represent their organisations.\n\nEnvironment Agency\n\nPublic body\n\nThe Environment Agency is an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

That is a positive change of 16 percentage points.\n\nRoula Khalaf\n\nEditor\n\nThe Financial Times joined the 50:50 Project because we like the straightforward approach of the initiative, based on data tracking, voluntary self-monitoring and friendly internal competition.\n\nWe joined to help achieve two goals that are important to us.\n\nFirst, to raise awareness in the newsroom and help increase the proportion of women featured in the FT; and, second, to support our company-wide efforts to reach a broader audience.\n\nSince then the 50:50 Project has expanded, with several more FT teams and products â including my Editor's Choice newsletter â volunteering to track gender representation in their output.\n\nSimply counting things like bylines, quotes and pictures is proving to be quite revealing.\n\nIâm encouraging all my FT colleagues to think about how we represent women in our coverage.\n\nI hope to see more teams from editorial and beyond join. Iâd like to see more of our global network take part, too.\n\nWe know some of our journalists find it harder because their beats are traditionally dominated by men. So I like the fact that our teams are focused on improving the ratio of women contributors in the longer term, working out what we need to do differently to make this happen.\n\nItâs also good to see colleagues exchanging simple, effective tips that have helped them find women experts.\n\nNot least - and especially amid the current upheaval â I value the extra effort our colleagues are making to represent both women and men in the FT.\n\nFIPP\n\nInternational digital magazine platform\n\nFIPP was founded in France in 1925 and is one of the worldâs oldest membership associations.

We started working on this project in 2019, because we believe that gender representation matters. We track our articles on a monthly basis since May 2020 after perfecting our process with the support of Google Digital News Innovation Fund.\n\nWe were originally focused on science and health, but launched some new sections in the middle of 2020: education, culture, innovation, economy, climate, along with some new newsletters. After this experience, we thought it would be easy to change our collective mindset about gender representation in our articles. But itâs not that simple!\n\nFirst because every journalist had their own sources, and also because our stories depend on current events. Covering the Covid-19 crisis added a sense of urgency. Sometimes, we didnât have the choice: we just had to cite the relevant Covid-19 national task force expert, or some members of the government. Our coverage reflected, in some ways, the structural biases of society towards gender representation.\n\nI think that journalism holds a responsibility not only to show the world as it is, but also to make it a better place - or at least try. Representing diversity is part of this.\n\nâ Heidi Gender Tracker project manager and science editor\n\nOur results varied a lot according to the months and to the sections. In March 2021, we achieved 40% of women out of all the experts cited in the science section. In the health section, we attained 29%, in line with our general (all section included) figure of 30% for all the articles produced in the same period. Compared with the average figure of 24% in the Swiss media industry in 2015, these results are encouraging.\n\nIt shows that we have room for improvement. For instance, sections such as education achieved better results than science or health, which reflects the fact that more men occupy high positions in hospitals or in academia. But on the other hand, most of the healthcare workers (nurses, paramedics...) are women. That simple example shows why gender representation matters.\n\nHow can we do better? This project sparked a healthy conversation about gender representation in our newsroom. Now, we have to keep it alive. Thatâs why weâre currently designing a reporting tool that will make our monthly figures available to both our editorial team and our readers.\n\nWe hope that it will help raise awareness - both in the newsroom and for our readers. I think that journalism holds a responsibility not only to show the world as it is, but also to make it a better place - or at least try. Representing diversity is part of this.\n\nHromadske Radio\n\nPublic Radio in Ukraine\n\nWorking with our partners in the BBC World Service charitable arm, MediaAction, Hromadske Radio (Community/Public Radio in Ukrainian) have joined the 5050 Project.

Our students have got so much out if it â itâs really pushed them to think about who they talk to and interview for their pieces. Weâre able to encourage them to think more broadly than just asking âwhatâs the story?â.\n\nThey also have to ask themselves how they can tell it in the most inclusive way possible. These are skills which ultimately will help make them better journalists and will stay with them through the rest of their careers.\n\nPersonally, Iâm thrilled to see the latest set of results have remained so good in extremely challenging circumstances.\n\nIt tells me gender equality in news is being taken seriously, and that in turn offers me great hope for journalism students at LJMU â the next generation of story-tellers.\n\nIsabelle, Level 5 Journalism student at LJMU, said: âThe 50:50 Project has really helped me to take into account gender equality when preparing and writing my stories.\n\nIt was interesting to see how easy it can be to make stories gender-biased, and the 50:50 Project helped me to avoid this by taking into account voices equally from both sexesâ.\n\nRobyn, Level 5 Journalism student at LJMU, added: âThe 50:50 Project was fascinating. When I was analysing the genders of my interviewees, I was almost expecting the opposite result. I felt I had spoken to more male participants than I did women, based on memory of stories. On reflection I would say I felt more comfortable approaching women to interview.\"\n\nLoftus Media\n\nProduction company\n\nLoftus Media is a content production company that was established in 1997.

So it figures that speaking to the widest range of people possible is paramount and this has been thrown into sharper focus by the period of reckoning experienced after last summerâs Black Lives Matter protests, which had an outsize impact on the UKâs creative industries.\n\nWe know when seeking out the next scoop it is easy to return to the âusual suspectsâ â contacts weâve known for years but may not reflect the full gamut of the UKâs multicultural communities â but keeping an eye on who weâre speaking with should help us on the path to widening our story base and boosting diversity of thought.\n\nWe want to both improve our coverage of diversity and inclusion-related topics and simultaneously bake representation into everything we do. Diversity monitoring is a big step towards achieving that.\n\nMedia Council of Mongolia\n\nIndependent media regulator\n\nThe Media Council of Mongolia was set up in 2015 as a collaboration of journalistsâ associations and media organisations. It is the independent regulator for the printed press, broadcast media and online media. Mongolia is a landlocked country in East Asia bordered by Russia to the north and China to the south with a population of 3.3 million, half of whom live in the capital Ulaanbaatar. The MCM aims to support freedom of the media by following professional journalistic standards to serve the public interest and protect against censorship. It provides training for journalists. It implements 5050 Project in its own work but also explaining its value to news organisations across the country.\n\nMoldova.org\n\nNews website\n\nWorking with our partners in the BBC World Service charitable arm, MediaAction, the news website Moldova.org has joined the 5050 Project. It was one of the first websites create in Moldova in 1997. Moldova is located between Ukraine and Romania in Eastern Europe with a population of 2.5 million.

They regard searching out diverse voices, representing society fairly, as simply a part â a critically important one - of being a good journalist. Colleagues and I also take great care to source journalism and media content for our teaching that better reflects our society. Three years as a BBC 50:50 partner have embedded these values in the fabric of our programmes: across content, delivery, the marking criteria for assignments. And we are now sharing what we have learned with our colleagues in other subject areas.\n\nThe Newmark School\n\nat the City University of New York\n\nThe Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York is a publicly funded institution. Their mission is to âserve the public interest â by training new journalists who will bring much-needed diversity to newsrooms, by helping mid-career journalists retool their skills, and by partnering with other media organisations to find new paths to excellence.â\n\nNHK\n\nJapan Broadcasting Corporation\n\nEriko Hase\n\nSenior Producer, NHK\n\nMy journey with 50:50 started modestly. First with small chats with colleagues in the canteen and corridors, then organizing several workshops, and eventually giving a presentation to our executives.\n\nThe key in this process was to reach out to as many male colleagues as possible. While shared experience enables a smooth discussion in a female-dominated group, we may unintentionally make male colleagues feel defensive. But once men accept D&I as their own issue, they stand by you and become a powerful driving force for consensus building, which is still a prerequisite in Japanese society.\n\nNHK started to trial 50:50 in April 2021 with six programmes, including documentaries and dramas. It started small because we wanted to demonstrate the benefit of counting before expanding to different departments.\n\nWhen the counting started, the impact was huge. My colleagues say it made them see the world differently, think outside the box, and stretch their creativity:\n\nâWe realized the gender bias as a filmmaker and re-acknowledged the structural gender imbalance in Japanese society.â\n\nâI intuitionally thought 5050 would be a restriction, but in fact, it was a powerful device to break stereotypes! â\n\nWe recently expanded our trial to primetime News. The rough ratio of women to men was 3:7, and the team decided to take on full-scale counting in its new program starting this April. News, by its nature, may be a complex area to see the change, but this move will surely push NHKâs challenge to the next stage.\n\nNorth East Film Festival\n\nEvents organisation\n\nThe festival organisers are looking to create âa new, inclusive and innovative film festival in the North East of England but aimed internationally and beyond the film industry reachâ.\n\nNottingham Trent University\n\nHigher Education\n\nStudents at Nottingham Trent University took part in the March challenge and reached 49% women contributor in their final news week.\n\nEmilia Roman\n\nBA Journalism student, Nottingham Trent University\n\nAs a trainee journalist, taking part in the 50:50 Project at Nottingham Trent University has been an eye-opening experience for me!\n\nTwo groups of NTU journalism students from the final year BA Journalism and the MA News Journalism courses monitored the gender balance in their reporting across two Newsweeks, running in January and February 2021.\n\nIn the first week of practical production, students were asked not to adjust the way they normally source their interviewees, story topics and multimedia content, or pay any particular attention to equal representation. This follows the approach both BBC teams and 50:50 Partner organisations are advised to take when they roll out monitoring. They donât make radical changes at first, they just implement the counting and monitoring into the workflow and identify a baseline to improve from.\n\nDuring this first period we recorded the lowest representation: an average of just 29% women contributors were featured across the entire website. In the second week, students were encouraged to make a more concerted effort to focus on equal representation. We definitely found this hardest to achieve in the sports section, but knowing we were working towards 50:50 prompted sports editors and reporters to think outside the box and to create more top stories which were focused on local womenâs sports teams.\n\nItâs pretty clear to us that recognising the need for equal representation can significantly change the way your content looks.\n\nâ BA Journalism student, Nottingham Trent University\n\nFor us, the challenge of incorporating the principals of 50:50 into our work came down to one crucial element of story development - research.\n\nIf a female interviewee no longer wanted to participate, for example, it was essential to try and find a like-for-like. Accepting the first reply and focusing on âgetting the story upâ was not enough to help us drive a significant change in our coverage.\n\nOpinion pieces written by female reporters really helped increase representation too. These articles touched on important topics such as race, eating disorders, mental health, and female athletes. They not only attracted a lot of readers but boosted the confidence of women student reporters in pursuing more stories. The popularity of these pieces also indicated that we do have a female audience that we need to cater for and not ignore.\n\nAlong with fellow students, I have actively taken part in gathering the data for the project. Unsurprisingly, when sharing daily updates on our numbers, trainee journalists have welcomed the feedback and strived for gender balance.\n\nFocusing on research and creating a welcoming environment for women reporters to explore topics important to them helped us achieve an average of 49% women across the CBJ Target website on our last day of practical production.\n\nItâs pretty clear to us that recognising the need for equal representation can significantly change the way your content looks.\n\nNOW: Pensions\n\nPensions providers\n\nNOW: Pensions: one of the biggest UK workplace pensions providers.

It is an independent UK Regulatory Authority with a remit to protect consumers by working to deliver a greener, fairer energy system.\n\nPriya Brahmbhatt-Patel\n\nDirector of Communications, Ofgem\n\nAfter launching the 50:50 Project last year, I am pleased to see all the hard work paying off. We are seeing a real improvement in representation in our content and have received positive feedback from stakeholders. It has even led to some taking an interest in joining 50:50 themselves, and we hope that there will soon be a visible cultural shift across the energy sector and civil service.\n\nAs a senior female leader from an ethnic minority, Iâve often struggled to see role models that look like me to aspire to. Initiatives like 50:50 are exactly how we empower our up-and-coming stars, and inspire a new generation to enter industries where they can see people just like them.\n\nOra et Labora\n\nProduction company\n\nOra Et Labora is a production company owned by Dermot O'Leary and international agent John Noel. Based in London, it has been making radio programmes for BBC Radio 2 and 6Music since 2005.\n\nORF\n\nAustrian public service broadcaster\n\nORFâs data shows overall progress since they started monitoring, with 51% of their content reaching 50:50 â up three percentage points on their starting month.\n\nKatia RÃ¶ssner\n\nEqual Opportunity Commissioner, ORF\n\nThe ORF, Austriaâs public broadcaster, has been a 50:50 Equality Project partner for over a year.\n\nWe committed to the 50:50 Challenge for the first time in October 2020, with 29 programmes coming on board. These shows cover a broad range from radio to television; regional studios to national outlets; news and science to entertainment, sport and religion. More than a third of the teams were already at 50:50 when they signed up to the Challenge.\n\nOur Challenge launch included a video presentation on the ORF Intranet featuring ORF pioneers, ORFâs CEO and the 50:50 Project founder. This drew a lot of attention and, one month later, 59 programmes had signed up.\n\nFeedback from participants has been motivating. The chief editor of a regional news bulletin noted, â50:50 is a crucial step towards a change in awareness, especially on the part of team leaders. At first there was some scepticism regarding âtoken womenâ, but the team started focusing on interviewing a female intensive care doctor instead of a man. We found a great doctor who has the potential to become a new coronavirus expert on our show.â\n\nThe competitive and sporting spirit of the 50:50 Challenge is appealing to many programme-makers, including those who were initially hesitant.\n\nâ Katia RÃ¶ssner, ORF Equal Opportunity Commissioner\n\nBy the beginning of February 2021, the number of participating ORF programmes had increased to 86 and, as a next step towards achieving our 50:50 goals, the ORF also launched a database of female experts in March 2021.\n\nData analysis showed that, on average, the hosts of participating programs are half women and half men. However, 36% of all guests and interviewees are female, so there needs to be greater effort to address this imbalance. Recent data also indicate that, as more programmes joined the challenge, the overall average proportion of women on air compared to men decreased. This is a good sign, because it shows that programmes with low female participation were also willing to get on board, not just the teams already at or close to 50:50.\n\nThe competitive and sporting spirit of the 50:50 Challenge is appealing to many programme-makers, including those who were initially hesitant. Honest engagement and even small steps towards 50:50, no matter where you start, make you a winner.\n\nPwC\n\nProfessional services network\n\nPwC submitted six datasets and saw an overall improvement in their performance. A third reached 50:50, compared to 17% of datasets when they first joined the project.\n\nEmma Thorogood\n\nDirector of Corporate Affairs, PwC\n\nWe initially signed up to the BBCâs 50:50 initiative in 2020. We started with our economics team as a Pilot Group testing out the process, in part because it is a male dominated subject area but also because our economics research garners a lot of the firmâs press coverage.\n\nThe economics team were very receptive to the idea from the get-go, not least because they believed that we should showcase more female talent but also because of the additional media coverage it might lead to - particularly in broadcast.\n\nWe actively monitor the balance of men and women from the team used in commentary on air (television and radio) and online. We then report back every month with these 50:50 statistics, and thereâs a sense of collective pride when our coverage consists of more female voices than male. Gaining top tier coverage and ensuring we have at least as many women quoted as men are unquestionably of equal importance now - which is no small feat.\n\nThis injects a bit of healthy competition into the process, which everyone very much enjoys!\n\nâ Emma Thorogood, PwC Director of Corporate Affairs\n\nOne of the most positive outcomes has been it has genuinely changed the way the team thinks. When considering who to nominate for media training, or who to quote in press releases and put forward for interviews, there is now always the question: âWhat will this mean for our 50:50 coverage?â. As such, we recently media trained four young female economists, with the hope that over time they will become some of our most prominent spokespeople.\n\nFollowing the success of the initiative with economics, we have rolled it out to other media-facing PwC teams, notably financial services, technology, cybersecurity and climate change. Again, there has been huge interest from members of these teams and a genuine desire to ensure that there is more female representation - not just in their media but in other areas too, such as internal panels or client webcasts. Again, helping our experts to be more attuned to the 50:50 issue has been a key success.\n\nAs well as reporting back to our stakeholders, corporate affairs collate the monthly 50:50 breakdowns from the various teams we support in order to see whoâs doing the best with their female spokespeople. This injects a bit of healthy competition into the process, which everyone very much enjoys!\n\nGoing forward, weâll be looking to roll the initiative out to other areas of the business and expect the same enthusiastic uptake.\n\nRadio Free Asia\n\nGovernment-funded, non-profit broadcaster\n\nRAI\n\nItalian public service broadcaster\n\nReed Smith\n\nInternational law firm\n\nReed Smith is an international law firm which focusses on sectors including Entertainment and Media, Financial Services and Life Sciences.

We believe that our coverage has to reflect the reality of society. Not only in terms of the issues and values, but also in the diversity of genders that we highlight in news reports. We began this campaign with an awareness that the sources we interviewed for our reports do not yet represent the gender balance in our society.\n\nThis was not an easy task, because we first needed to change our collective mindset inside the newsroom. Only when a newsroom realises its own shortcomings and is willing to transform can we start making progress. Thatâs another important part of the campaign: we can only change others if we first change ourselves. We have to walk the talk!\n\nThat is why, for us, the 50:50 Project is not only about making sure we have the right representation in the media; it is also about setting an example for others. We report on the powerful every day. We demand accountability and transparency from our elected officials. We want a society that is free and fair, for all. Itâs time for the media to apply the same standard to ourselves.\n\nMoreover, we believe the 50:50 campaign will make our journalism better. Our duty in the media is to help citizens make informed decision, to assist them in understanding the context of events and to initiate conversation around important issues. We cannot do that if we ignore half of society.\n\nGender inequality in media coverage has been a persistent problem for years â it reflects other imbalances in the newsroom such as diversity in the workforce. Joining this campaign is our first step towards solving those issues. We will need a lot of support to succeed, but we know we are on the right path.\n\nTimes Radio\n\nUK commercial digital broadcaster\n\nTimes Radio is the digital radio station associated with The Times newspaper. The Afternoon Show is the first programme to adopt 50:50.\n\nTVNZ\n\nPublic broadcaster, New Zealand\n\nTVNZ submitted the data for five of its teams for the March challenge with a fifth reaching 50:50.\n\nSophie Baird\n\nExecutive Producer\n\nSince TVNZ's daily Breakfast programme started tracking gender representation there's been a noticeable shift in terms of on-screen talent used. They have taken on board the BBC's advice to ask organisations if there's a woman available to talk, and in many cases there has been! As a team they are thinking smarter about how to achieve 50:50 representation and where there's the opportunity to control the talent used, they are actively looking for women. This has resulted in more female experts going on the show, and bringing with them a different energy and alternative angles. Some industries are easier than others, certainly in NZ there still seems to be a shortage of female experts in areas like technology, security and terrorism - however we're still actively looking!\n\nFair Go, TVNZ's weekly consumer current affairs programme, often uses experts as part of its stories. Since taking part in the BBC's 50:50 Project, the team has changed its thinking and is focusing on female representation. A recent series about smart technology saw three of us searching for a female expert on technology, instead of using tried and true male experts we have used in the past. Admittedly it did take more time - however the payoff was having a fresh new voice talking about an industry that's generally so male dominated.\n\nBoth the Breakfast and Fair Go teams have changed the way they think and work since starting the BBC 50:50 Project. Female representation has very much become part of the conversation when talking about talent, stories and experts.\n\nWeâre feeling really pleased that the numbers are consistently being recorded and members of each programme are getting behind this concept wholeheartedly.\n\nâ Sophie Baird, TVNZ Executive Producer\n\nBeing part of the 50:50 Project has changed the way we look at our bulletins and find our experts and commentators. It is so heartening to hear people talking about whether there is a female able to talk, or indeed what the female perspective would be.\n\nWhile we might not have hit 50:50 across the board for March 2021, weâre finding each month really does fluctuate and some months are quite simply better than others. Weâre feeling really pleased that the numbers are consistently being recorded and members of each programme are getting behind this concept wholeheartedly.\n\nUA:PBC\n\nUkrainian public broadcaster\n\nWorking with our partners in the BBC World Service charitable arm, MediaAction, UA:PBC the largest independent media company in Ukraine, has joined 5050 Project.

Therefore when we signed up to 50:50 we decided that we would go global and drive the change we want to see.\n\nStarting by understanding our baseline is an obvious first step and has given us a great foundation. We are already seeing early signs of the mindset shift we need to make, with teams increasingly building consideration of the gender representation of our spokespeople into our communications plans and media training more of our female experts, supporting not just our 50:50 ambitions, but our readiness to be able to engage on key topics.\n\nFor example, in March 2020 we profiled some of our brilliant young female scientists for âBritish Science Weekâ, a great opportunity for them to talk about their passion and commitment to innovation and sustainable business.\n\nIt has been really valuable to work with the team from the BBC who have been so supportive of the journey weâre on and brilliant to align with like-minded organisations, driving a more diverse and richer public discourse.\n\nUniversity of Bedfordshire\n\nFaculty of Creative Arts, Technologies and Science\n\nThe University of Bedfordshire is based in five campuses across the county.

Students are challenged to create content that represents our diverse communities, and with many journalism programmes now educating as many young women as men, the opportunity to be involved in BBC 50:50 was obvious.\n\nHaving read and heard about the project, it became very obvious to me as a journalism educator that this is something that I could do in a more formal way to encourage my students to think about their own practice in terms of who they speak to in the creation of their news and features output. I knew I wanted to be involved, but more, I knew that many of my colleagues would too, which is why I suggested to the BBC 50:50 team that we work collaboratively with the Association for Journalism Education to promote the project to the professional journalists of tomorrow.\n\nColleagues from seven universities were keen to get involved in our pilot project, to have their students benefit from an initiative that is seeking to change how we represent our society. The opportunity to, in quite an explicit way, get our students to begin to content gather in far more inclusive ways is a chance to instil in them practices that they will continue in to their professional lives. It was about asking them to stop and think and act.\n\nThe AJE hopes that we can continue to work to promote BBC 50:50 across our membership of 50 universities, but also that we can see greater awareness among our students, so we can hear more womenâs voices across the wide range of journalism that is being produced by them both now and in the future.\n\nUniversity of Westminster\n\nHigher Education\n\nUniversity of Westminster started 180 years ago as the first polytechnic in London. Today it continues to support students from a variety of backgrounds. As part of its 50:50 partnership, the university has been the pilot ground for 50:50 The Pitch. This has led to the create of two pieces of work â a mini-series in October 2020 and the first News Voices portrait series in April 2021. The studentsâ successful delivery of both projects now sees 50:50 pitch opportunities opened to the whole university network.\n\nUniversity of Worcester\n\nHigher Education\n\nUniversity of Worcester journalism department focusses on a range of potential media and communications careers with opportunities to study media strategies, search engine optimisation, PR, advanced communications and social influencing.\n\nVoice of America\n\nNews agency and broadcaster\n\nThe Voice of America (VOA) took part in the 2021 challenge and saw their overall performance improve by 23 percentage points on when they started monitoring.
