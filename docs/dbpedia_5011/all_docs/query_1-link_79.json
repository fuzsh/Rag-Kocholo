        "text": "Kosovo’s intention to be a part of the Eurovision family is no secret. RTK has tried for years to secure the nation’s spots to EBU’s shows, since the nation’s independence declaration.\n\nMoreover and as we have previously informed you, RTK has announced that they will make an official application in order to participate in the next edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2025, which will be held in Switzerland.\n\nThe application has now been sent on behalf of RTK. Via a formal letter, RTK asks Kosovo to be invited to participate in Eurovision 2025, in a similar way Australia also participates. Specifically, the letter sent to the EBU mentions that:\n\nDear Mr. Osterdahl,\n\nAs Director General of Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) I am writing to you on behalf of RTK to ask for an invitation to participate in the upcoming Eurovision Song Contest, organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Participation in this high-level cultural event in Europe is our strong ambition and of great importance for our European Union integration.\n\nRTK has been actively fostering musical talent and promoting cultural exchange within Kosovo. We have successfully organized our own national song contest, which has garnered significant popularity among Kosovans. This year, we will proudly host the second edition of our contest, with the hope that the winning song will represent Kosovo in the next year’s Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nAlthough Kosovo currently has a special Agreement and a status with the EBU, we are inspired by the example of countries like Australia, which have been invited to participate in Eurovision. We firmly believe that the Eurovision Song Contest is a non-political event that celebrates music, diversity, and unity, values that resonate deeply with our nation.\n\nWe respectfully requést your consideration in extending an invitation to RTK to participate in the next Eurovision Song Contest. Our participation would not only showcase the vibrant talent of Kosovo but also reinforce the spirit of inclusion and cultural exchange that Eurovision embodies.\n\nLast but not least, the EBU has played a crucial role in establishing RTK back in 1999, thus we hope that you will look into helping us to achieve this goal, enshrined in our mission as public broadcaster.\n\nThank you for considering our request. We look forward to the possibility of contributing to and enriching this prestigious event.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nShkumbin Ahmetxhekaj\n\nDirector General of Radio Television of Kosova\n\nWhat has been holding RTK from its Eurovision participation?\n\nIn order for Kosovo to become a member of the EBU, and thus be able to participate in Eurovision, it must first join the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Council of Europe. Kosovo has yet to achieve any of these, due to its partial recognition.\n\nConsidering the political implications that occurred during Eurovision 2024, the inclusion of a country that is not recognized by all the participating states will be a harder decision than it may seem.\n\nFestivali i Këngës në RTK the selection process!\n\nKosovo’s ambition to participate in Eurovision is that high that they have already prepared a festival via which a potential future Eurovision entry will be selected. Festivali i Këngës në RTK, which was first organized in 2023, will probably serve as the nation’s selection format in case their permitted a Eurovision participation.\n\nIn fact, La Fazani with his song “Oj Kosova” was the first winner of FiK në RTK and would represent Kosovo in Malmö in case he was allowed to.\n\nStay tuned to EurovisionFun for all the news!"
