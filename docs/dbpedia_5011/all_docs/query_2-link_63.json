However from 2013, the running order of all three shows will be established by new procedures.\n\nAs before, the particular semi-final in which a country participates will be determined by a draw that traditionally takes place late January. Countries are divided into pools based on historical voting patterns.\n\nHowever, in a new twist, the show's producers will determine the exact running order of the semi-finals.\n\nThe running order for the final will be determined by the same method: the producers of the show will determine the performance order, with the exception of the host country's position, which will be determined by draw."
