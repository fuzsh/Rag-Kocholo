Share your session proposal with MML by March 1 for the MML Annual Conference that takes place Sept. 15-18 in Branson!\n\nToday Sam and I are joined by Ryan Burge on The Burge Report to discuss what's happening and what the future may hold for the SBC.

Considering that AnaEE received its ERIC status in 2022, it is still a reasonably young member, but has already been very successful in partnering with other RIs and gathering funding from projects at a European level. That demonstrates that the field we work in is very relevant, serving a wide community from food and health to environmental clusters. #researchinfrastructure #collaboration #environment"
