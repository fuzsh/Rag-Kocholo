KEY POLICY POINTERS\n\nSerbian unions win historic deal\n\nThe first collective agreement between unions and management of the Chinese-owned Zijin Copper mine in Serbia has secured a wage increase and better working conditions.\n\nNorth Macedonian union listens to the concerns of young journalists\n\nThe Independent Trade Union of Journalists and Media Workers (SSNM) of Macedonia has been working with international trade union organisations to help young journalists address the challenges posed by digital media and understand the benefits of joining a trade union.\n\nAlbania & North Macedonia accession must prioritise workers' & social rights\n\nEuropean trade unions support the opening of EU accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia. &nbsp;Liina Carr, ETUC Confederal Secretary, said “Albania and North Macedonia need to join the EU to secure workers’ rights, a brighter economic future and safeguard democracy. At the same time the EU needs to reassure the people of the western Balkans that there really is a place for them under the democratic and social umbrella of the social market economy of the EU.\n\nWestern Balkans trade union cooperation protects seasonal workers\n\nA cooperation agreement reached last June by Croatian, North Macedonian and Montenegrin trade unions is bringing concrete benefits for workers.\n\nAttacks on journalists must stop says ETUC\n\nThe European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) condemns the threats and insults by Bosnian Serb politician Milorad Dodik against journalist Tanja Topic. Currently a member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Dodik called the journalist a German agent and ‘quisling’. It is the latest in his campaign of threats and insults against journalists who is he disagrees with.\n\nMontenegrin unions lay out programme for progress\n\nThe Union of Free Trade Unions of Montenegro has adopted a platform setting out policy proposals for the newly formed government, covering the economy and labour market, taxation, public administration reform, social policy and trade union rights and freedoms.\n\nWestern Balkans Summit needs positive accession message from EU\n\nThe European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) welcomes today’s EU-Western Balkans Zagreb Summit going ahead. But despite the recent positive decision to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, a broader message on positive prospects of the future of the accession process for the Western Balkans is missing. The Summit hopefully will strengthen political dialogue and socio-economic cooperation between the EU and the region and show solidarity and joint effort in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNorth Macedonian partners back European charter on journalists’ working conditions\n\nThe Trade Union of Macedonian Journalists and Media Workers (SSNM) has teamed up with the Association of Journalists (AJM), the Council of Media Ethics, NGO Onlimit Media and news portal Vidi Vaka to sign the European\n\nTrade union pressure restores retirement age\n\nThe Croatian government has backed down on amendments to its pension system, reinstating a retirement age of 65, after sustained pressure from trade unions. The changes would have raised the retirement age to 67 for both men and women from 2033, instead of 2038 as previously planned, and cut back payments for workers retiring early.\n\nMore labour disputes settled peacefully\n\nThe number of labour disputes settled without industrial action in Serbia doubled this year compared to 2018, says the Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions of Serbia, the biggest trade union confederation in the country, affiliated to the ETUC.\n\nA better deal for broadcasting staff\n\nThe Media Trade Union of Montenegro (SMCG) signed a historic&nbsp;collective agreement with the public broadcaster Radio Television of Montenegro (RTCG) in June, after three years of collective bargaining.\n\nBalkan unions agree to cooperate\n\nThe Union of Free Trade Unions of Montenegro (UFTUM) and the Union of Independent Trade Unions of Albania (BSPSH) have concluded a cooperation agreement for the next four years, pledging mutual respect and an exchange of knowledge and experience. Srdja Kekovic, the Secretary General of UFTUM – an existing ETUC affiliate – and Gezim Kalaja, President of BSPSH, which has requested affiliation, signed&nbsp;the deal in the Montenegrin capital, Podgorica.\n\nDeclaration of the International Trade Union Conference: \"The Voice of Integration of the Western Balkans\"\n\nDeclaration of the International Trade Union&nbsp;Conference “The Voice of Integration of the Western Balkans”, Sofia, 9 May 2018 As the EU-Western Balkans Summit is about to take place in Sofia on 17 May 2018, under the auspices of the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, at which the EU is expected to reaffirm its commitment to the integration of its partners in the Western Balkan countries and once again emphasise the region's place within the European family:\n\nETUC on EU enlargement\n\nAccording to media reports the European Commission will today recommend that Albania and Macedonia start EU accession negotiations, and be critical about Turkey’s lack of progress towards EU fundamental human rights, justice and freedom of expression. The European Trade Union Confederation\n\nETUC Declaration on Montenegro\n\nIn its meeting in March 2015, the ETUC Executive Committee affiliated the two representative confederations from Montenegro, CTUM and UFTUM.&nbsp; CTUM was affiliated because the new leadership, elected at their congress in November 2013, engaged in a serious and complex reform process. This process clearly disturbs those forces who want to keep CTUM under full control. The same are responsible for enormous financial abuses that ruin the trade union’s reputation.\n\nMontenegro - ETUC supports Marko Nikcevic\n\nLast night the car of the General Secretary of the Confederation of Trade unions of Montenegro (CTUM), Marko Nikcevic, was destroyed by a car bomb. Mr Nikcevic has been in office since November 2013 and has started a far-reaching reform of the union, including external audits. Massive financial abuse has been discovered and reported to the Prosecutor for Organised Crime.&nbsp; In later March 2015 opponents of the CTUM leadership organized a putsch supported by the Ministry of Labour to oust Mr Nikcevic from office.\n\nThe ETUC today welcomed in to the European trade union family, as full members, CTUM-Montenegro, UFTUM-Montenegro and FTUM-FYRO Macedonia\n\n“We welcome our colleagues from Montenegro and FYRO Macedonia into the European trade union movement” said Bernadette Ségol, General Secretary of the ETUC, “and will work with CTUM, UFTUM and FTUM to improve working conditions for all people in Montenegro and FYRO Macedonia, and to ensure the full adoption of EU social and trade union rights on the way to full EU membership. The destiny of the people of Montenegro and FYRO Macedonia and of the EU is together.” &nbsp;\n\nBernadette Ségol demands Serbian government to come back to dialogue\n\nBernadette Ségol, General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC), in a solidarity declaration addressed to its two Serbian confederations CATUS and NEZAVISNOST, underlined the need for a proper social dialogue in Serbia."
