On this occasion I wanted to open this editorial section with a photo not only of me, but of this artistic team that has worked on one of my milestones of the year, the show Beyond Al-Andalus, for which I have collaborated with Birgit Ellinghaus, from alba Kultur. She is in charge of several concerts each season in the Mozart Hall of the Alte Oper Frankfurt.\n\nThe artists have been Vigüela (old friends, you probably already know), the sister duo from León Tsacianiegas and the charming Galician singer and tambourine player Tania Caamaño. Each time something like this happens I feel that magic has been created, that the stars have aligned, that providence has seen fit to give me this unforgettable moment. On the other hand, as the world goes, it seems that this is a delicate marvel that could break at any moment.\n\nHonestly, I am in one of those very stressful moments, I hope you will forgive me if there are any typos. I am writing this the day before I travel again, to Manchester this time, to the annual meeting of the European Folk Network, at the same time as for English Folk Expo. Back on Saturday night and early Tuesday morning, flying again, to Coruña. I have the honor of being called to mentor some delegates (by the way, this is starting to be more or less usual and I am open to requests of mentoring) and I love it but I’ll have to get up at 3am…. As my father would say, may all sorrows be like that. Totally agree.\n\nI hope this content is of interest to you. I have enjoyed it very much. The conversation with Said was great. And to be able to announce that in my land there is a new world music programming initiative is a great joy. You will see it below and they are open to proposals. Thank you for your attention.\n\nRemember: if you have any news of interest for our community, let me know. Thank you very much for your attention.\n\nAraceli Tzigane | Mapamundi Música | +34 676 30 28 82\n\nINTRODUCING MADRID WORLD MUSIC (MWM), A NEW CONCERT SERIES, BY MADRESIERRA\n\nA couple of weeks ago I saw on Instagram that Huun-Huur-Tu were coming to Madrid. It was announced by Madresierra‘s profile, whose slogans in the Bio are “💫 Cultural promoter of exclusive sounds 💫 🥁 World Music Movement 🌍”.\n\nI didn’t know about this initiative so I inquired and saw that my friend Patricia Alvarez, dancer, researcher and creator, had them in her circle of contacts. She put me in the background and I got in touch. I asked Juan Cobo for a statement to present his initiative. And here they are. Obviously, I was very happy to learn about this new initiative in Madrid and I hope it goes very well and that they can establish themselves strongly.\n\nThey are open to proposals so, if you have something for them, contact them on their Instagram. I leave you with Juan’s words:\n\n“I am Juan Cobo, creator of Madresierra, a Spanish cultural promoter of exclusive sounds. We present Madrid World Music (MWM), a cycle that aims to bring to Madrid (Spain) root music, ethnic music, music from any corner of the planet that has emerged from the earth itself. A place for the restless spectator, who wants to feed his soul and intends to discover other sound and cultural worlds.\n\nMWM only has a start date, not an end date, nor intermediate dates. We are collecting proposals, and when they touch our hearts, we look for the best way to program them. Likewise, it will be itinerant, since depending on the type of artist, the space will be one or another: concert hall, theater, auditorium, non-conventional spaces…\n\nWe know that it is a difficult job, since in our country it is difficult to spread this kind of sounds, but we also know that there is a huge minority of people who love this kind of music. We see it as an opportunity to attract a type of public that, in our opinion, is becoming orphaned of “ethnic” spaces. Festivals like Etnosur, Pirineos Sur or La Mar de Músicas, which were born with this “label”, are turning to a more commercial programming, without so much exclusivity, since they repeat names that are already in other Spanish “multi-style” festivals.\n\nWe will cover this target and we are waiting for your proposals!”\n\nVISA FOR MUSIC WILL TAKE PLACE: RABAT 22-25 NOVEMBER\n\nWhen we knew about the earthquake in the Atlas mountains and it’s effect in cities like Marrakech, I though Visa for Music might be cancelled but no: not only is it not cancelled, but also, the box office income will be donated to special funds to support earthquake relief efforts.\n\nThis will be the 10th edition of the event. Learn more on their website.\n\n– MEET ME IN BRUSSELS –\n\nWhile I was writitting this, I received an email that made me very happy, with this drawing of Ali Doğan Gönültaş’s in for the banner for Muziekpublique. This is the reason why I can’t attend Visa for Music. On day 22nd I will be in Brussels for the premiere in Belgium of Ali Doğan Gönültaş. Here you have all the details. It will be at the Théâtre Molière, managed by Muziekpublique, the organization of Peter Van Rompaey, a lantern of culture in Europe. I made a long interview with Peter, that you can read in this previous edition. This concert is part of the tour Klangkosmos, produced by alba Kultur, lead by Birgit Ellinghaus, another landmark for our community, who has been mentioned often here. For instance, here you are an interview with her.\n\nAND NOW THE FLOOR IS FOR:\n\nSAID CHAOUCH, FROM WORLDMUSIC OASIS\n\nSaid will attend Visa for Music. He told me that this is the reason why he won’t come to WOMEX this year. He explained to me about the meaning of this kind of events, like Visa for Music, for him. Below you can read about it.\n\nI took this so nice portrait of Said from the page About us, from www.worldmusicoasis.com. I think I may have crossed paths with Said at a Womex but we never spoke in person until a few days ago. I think that in this photo, the photographer has captured the warmth that I have felt in Said in the long conversation we had through the screen. That’s why I have chosen it to open this interview.\n\nWhen we spoke to make the appointment, he told me that he was finishing a job. It’s about the book of which you have the cover here below. He was going on a trip soon and we would talk when he returned. The purpose of the book is to explain the concept or term “world music” from his own experience. He explains that “The term has been subject of criticism since it have been created. What is world music, how to define the term, why people dislike the term.” In the book, he is trying answer those questions through interviews with 50 music experts, journalists, producers, etc… and telling the story about how he started a music store in Sweden. The book will be published and available on his website soon. I will send news about it when it is already available.\n\nHere below you will learn the steps that made he set the store Worldmusic Oasis, and many other interesting facts.\n\nMapamundi Música: You founded Worldmusic Oasis, a shop in Gothenburg, to sell world music mainly, you sell also jazz and other styles… but what led you to establish the store? Why did you start this?\n\nSaid Chaouch: This is an interesting question. In my book, which hopefully will come soon – but this book is not to sell, it is book just for friends and the people who like music – there I explain a little bit more how when I moved from France. I was living in Paris before, and I was playing in France as musician street. Just as a hobby, you know. I´m born as a painter and studied painting, not as a musician but both go into each other. I´have been playing music for fan but don’t want to call myself a musician.\n\nAkli D comes from the same area in Algeria. We lived not far from each other. He did play music already in Algeria before he left to France in the beginning of the 80s. We meet often in Paris outside Centre Georges Pompidou where we shared the place and played for fun for tourists. Akli didn’t have a band at that time, he was just playing with his guitar. We were many sharing the place and the streets in Saint Michel. I left him in Paris where he succeeded with his career and met 20 years later in a concert in Paris. He recognized me.\n\nManu Chao helped, Akli, like he did with Amadou and Marian, at the same time. He made a big success, he was everywhere, but was really a short time. He made and international career and I moved to Sweden because, at the time, I have met a girlfriend in Sweden. That’s reason I moved to Sweden.\n\nMM: The usual reason to move, hehe.\n\nSC: But then, the problem was that when you arrived in Sweden it was not like if you move from Paris to Madrid or to Milano or to Athena. Sweden was special that time. There were not many foreigners. Now it’s something else. But at that time, it was a cold, quiet, calm country… So, I thought “Here, I can’t stay”. And at the same I had my girlfriend; I had moved for her. So, I had to find something to compensate. So, at that time, 1985 it was that time when the word music had start in France: between 1983 until 1987 it’s that time where there were many many artists playing in France. So, the world music had started exactly that period when I left. So, Sweden was for me really empty. I had to find a compensation in Sweden. I am musician and if I went to a shop to buy a North African record or a Latin record, they were not. Even in the three big stores in Sweden, in the three biggest ones, you could find, maybe, in the world music section, maybe 10 records and that 10 records were traditional drums records. It was empty, there was nothing.\n\nSo, each time went to Paris there were friends who told me “Please, Said, can you bring for me Franco’s album? Can you take me…?” You know, so each time I went to Paris I returned with a bag of 50 CDs. So, I thought there was a market in Sweden. And I had to find something both to get money and to get back to me the atmosphere that I had in France and that I was missing. It was for me as oxygen. I need it. It was not for the money. I needed to get this people around me. That is how I started the store. And the store was really unique, except one which had opened a few years before me in Stockholm called Multi Kulti, but now they don’t exist anymore. But after them, mine was the second biggest store in…, not only Sweden, maybe in whole Scandinavia, even from Norway, Denmark and Finland. My specialty was world music. And it was the people who gave it’s the name. They said it was an oasis of world music, which was true. So the name is really meaningful.\n\nImportant – I would never have been able to have such a long career in music without the enormous work of my wife Eva, who encouraged me to open the store and who supported me in the shadows during all these years while working as much as me in addition to her full-time job.\n\nYou may feel like reading on while listening to the aforementioned Akli D:\n\nMM: Where were you born?\n\nSC: I was born in Algeria and I have grown in Algeria. But after the high school I moved to Paris. I moved to study painting. I have made many exhibitions. My career should have been more of a painter than a musician but it was difficult. It was difficult for a foreigner to get a job, as a painter or as an artist, it was difficult to survive. So I had to leave it on the side and continue with music. And it worked well, especially at the beginning with the store, because it was needed. It was an empty market in Sweden. At that time, there were people maybe from 100 nationalities who came to the store: people from Namibia… There were two persons from… let’s say, from India living here. They spoke to each other. At that time there was no WhatsApp, there was no Facebook… The people told to each other about the shop in Gothenburg where you could find music from Sri Lanka or music from Sudan or music from Somalia… The news spread really quickly.\n\nMM: So you had those two objectives when you made the shop, the make your living, to get income, and also to fulfil this gap that you were feeling. And it run well between the people. You didn’t need to make advertisements or nothing…\n\nSC: No, no, no, that time there was no Facebook no WhatsApp. But the information spread really quickly. People talked on the telephone. And they called me on the phone. It was fun but it was also too much work, because I learnt about the artists from the people, from the customers who came to buy. Let’s say there was someone from India who came to the store and asked about about Zakir Hussein. At that time, I didn’t know about Zakir. So I learned all the artists through the customers who had come and asked me about their musicians. There was not a book where to read about all the artists.\n\nMM: What is the situation right now about this? Because it’s totally different. Now everybody’s on the internet.\n\nSC: Exactly. That is one of the reason why I am writing in this book I talked about before. 10 years ago, when the CDs began to disappear, when it came the crisis with the CDs, it was really difficult: I found myself with a stock of CDs. All my economy, all that I have got under 20 years buying records, I found that I can’t sell them anymore. So it affected me really too much. And it was before Covid. But at the same time I lucky because the vinyl came back. It made a compensation for the CDs. The price of the vinyls is high, so all the vinyls I had allowed me to continue.\n\nAnd at the same time what have helped me is that, thanks to the contacts I made through the records, I began to book artists. At that time, around 1995, I was maybe the only one in Sweden who had the telephone number to call the African artists. There was no Internet, and I had the contact of most of the African and Arab artists in France through the records companies I bought records from. And the records companies, each time I went to France to buy records, asked me if I can book their artist in Sweden. That’s how I booked Papa Wemba. That’s how I book him the first time he came to Sweden. Or Tinariwen, with whom I have good contact, I was the first who booked them in Gothenburg. Or Orquestra National de Barbes. So when the crisis of CDs came, I compensated it with clubs, I have different music clubs, and booking artists. I compensated it with clubs, opening different music clubs, booking artists, DJing and giving lectures about world music.\n\nAnd then the Covid, of course, came and destroyed everything again. There were no concerts, I could not sell records… It was a really tough period where I thought it was not possible to continue to pay the rent for a big local… At that time, I started to think to make the website. Until that time, I have thought about website because it was for me enough to sell for the people here and I didn’t need to sell for the people outside Sweden. Already the market in Sweden was already enough. But when the crisis came, I thought now it’s the new world we are living in, so we have to make now good website and try to get more contact with the world.\n\nIn addition to ordering records, the Worldmusic Oasis website has a lot of interesting content. For example, the summary of Said’s presentation about world music, which you can read here.\n\nMM: So you make also bookings… So you have all these different lines of activity with music but why do you have this engagement with music? You say you were a musician yourself when you were in Paris. But your path was going to be a painter, not a musician. But what is your relationship with music? Because at the end all your life has been devoted to music. How did this start in your life? Were your parents musicians or did you study music in Algeria?\n\nSC: About the painting, when I was in school, at six or seven years, I was already the best in painting. That was already in my heart, in my mind. But you know, I have grown in a country where the artists don’t have a high value so I was a good artist but I knew that I couldn’t make the living as an artist because I can make an exhibition and people come, they can write good review, “oh, you are wonderful” and that’s all. So I came to France to continue study painting in the University. It didn’t work as planned for different reasons. I worked in small jobs and left behind the studies.\n\nBut in France I started to play music for fun, not professional, just in the weekend to meet friends. And then I moved to Sweden and I was missing the world music. When you have grown listening to listen African music, Arabic music and you find yourself with nothing… I am a social person. I have grown up in society where there are 100 persons around me. So to find yourself just with your love, in a small apartment… It’s it was not enough for me. In Sweden that time you had to choose to work in Volvo and I was not made for Volvo, you know, I am and artist. And the world music has given me the chance to travel all around. I have been everywhere in the world, I have met people and that’s for me… it’s not the money, you know.\n\n“Maybe if you compare all that money I have spent on this, maybe I could have six big houses but it’s not that what I was looking for.”\n\nThere is someone who writes in a newspaper here in Sweden and said when Said’s career is finished, he will not be rich in money but his career is full of meetings, of all these people I have met, all these artists I have met, I have a book, I have spent the time. For me that is the sense of the life. It’s not to get a big house, you know. Maybe if you compare all that money I have spent on this, maybe I could have six big houses but it’s not that what I was looking for.\n\nMM: No, no, of course, you need to make meaningful things for you and also for the world, I think. Your passing through the Earth must make something, not just being one part of the chain. I feel very similar, not with the recordings, but with the booking and management of artists so I feel very identified with all this you are explaining about traveling in the world for music. Yeah, I understand you.\n\nI wanted to ask you, you are advisor for several organizations that make concerts there. When you book or advice about an artist, which could be the characteristics that the artist will have for being interesting for you?\n\nSC: There is a hard competitions today for artists. My personal advice for an artist is to find a new music concept and:\n\n• Forget the boring artists’ standard\n\n• Mix your music with other genres, like that you can hear everywhere in the planet.\n\n• Make your music universal\n\n• Find your own look to attract curiousity\n\n• use Youtube\n\n• Invest to participate into music markets\n\n• Keep a good relations with promotors\n\n• Don’t give up\n\nI work with different venues in Gothenburg, with Norway too, with Oslo I have a good collaboration. Each time they bring an artist to Oslo they send it to me to Gothenburg. We have four venues in Gothenburg. So when I find an interesting artist, I contact the venues. Sometimes, if it’s empty, I mean, it’s not booked already… To compare with my friend in Oslo, they have their own venue but I collaborate with different venues. But as I have said, if I have to give advice of what artist was working well, let’s say we have two different category of artist: you have artists like Fatoumata Diawara, Amadou and Marian, Salif Keita, it is something else. Those artists cost a lot and you need big budget. So for a small booker it’s a little bit difficult, especially now. With these big artists you have to be 100 % sure that the money you give for Fatoumata Diawara or Salif Keita, you’ll get it. But at the same time, me personally I have followed Amadou and Marian since 15 years, I’ve see them in their career, but there are today good artists, like Ali (Doğan Gönültaş), Bab L’ Bluz … all these small artists who are making really fantastic work you know… Altin Gun… I have booked Tamikrest the last time… These artists are really good and don’t cost too much and they are interesting.\n\nFor me, you know, I get too many emails from different artist, each day we get, sometimes from promoters, sometime from the artists themselves… And we are limited in how much we can book. I mean I can’t book just to satisfy the artist because it must work, of course. So that sometimes can be a bit difficult to explain to the artist that, of course, I like it, you know, but you have to find the right time, the moment, the place…\n\nA good advice for a promotor is to work work work work work work work, I mean, for instance, like Thijs, the promotor of Tamikrest, he is a good promoter, working, sending mail, calling… You have to develop a good contact between promoters as friendly contact, not only business contact. Personal contact really helps a lot.\n\nMM: Especially in this field of music, the world music, I mean, the personal contact is especially important. Because maybe in in pop and rock is not.\n\nSC: No, no, no, that is different because in the pop the work is already done. But for the world music… Ali, a good artist, very known in Turkey but not too many people know him in Europe, so if you just send an email about Ali, it’s not enough. But when you get the contact, I mean, you trust the promoter, I became more curious with Ali now. That is the way to get a good contact for both, for the artist, for the promoter… Sometimes to be honest you don’t have the time to read all the mail.\n\nMM: I understand, it happens to me in the other side, I am contacted by many artist who want to me to be their manager…\n\nSC: That’s why I like Visa for Music, which I have helped a lot from Sweden to promote it, because there you come closer to the artists, really closer, as friends, and even promoters. You come really close. You go to take a cup of coffee with the promoter, you speak, you get more information from promoter around the cup of coffee… It’s more than just to send an mail for thousands of persons.\n\nLet’s listen to Tamikrest and send a greeting to Thijs Vandewalle:\n\nMM: Which do you think is the future for the recorded music? You explained to me how it was with the CDs, after CDs went down, vynils came super strong and so… What is going to be the future of recording music? Do you think there will still be needed physical editions or will they disappear?\n\nSC: I think it will disappear, honestly. Now, for the record labels, it is good to produce vinyl. Everybody want to have the vinyl but nobody listen. They have it as a decoration at home. And the price of a normal vinyl is 30 euro. But the young people won’t buy them. This period of the vinyl will take maybe 5 or 10 years but it will not survive, because now the people need to listen quickly they, to find quickly and everything go fast today.\n\nMM: I wanted to tell you something that I learned yesterday. A journalist here from Spain explained to us something that can give you a hope about the physical editions. There is an online distributor here in Spain called Altafonte. They are distributors not only for Spanish artists also for American artists, but they are working internationally. And recently they decided to remove the accounts, first for the artists in the Spotify who had less than 500 listeners every month, and after, less than 1000. So you are in the hands of this third part, the distributor, and you are not independent, you depend totally on this third part for your distribution of your music. So maybe this is a risk that the artist have to face. They have to understand that this can happen at any moment. Spotify or any of the others can change their criteria or your digital distributor in which you delegated your distribution, can change the rules and can say “okay, I delete your account, or you have to pay me X amount or whatever…” and they don’t own the channel. So they are in the risk of losing all their distribution. Maybe this will start to happen more often.\n\nThis I am talking about, Altafonte, is a Spanish distributor, founded in Spain, but they are working not only for Spain, they work for all the world, they are a digital distributor who puts the music of the artists in the several platforms. Ad they decided that they are not going to support little artists. They will remove them from the platforms because it doesn’t return money, even when the cost is very little because it is only administrative work, but it is not worthy for them to deal with the administration of having very little accounts of a musicians.\n\nI wanted to tell you because they don’t get money from very little artists who have very few listeners, but they have to work in the administration, making reports and these kinds of things. So they deleted them.\n\nSC: But they have to understand that each artist needs a time to be known, to get more people. If you take for instance Altin Gun, from Turkey, no one knew them at the beginning. So the distributor has to support them. To this is not Rolling Stones what you are distributing, let’s say, it is not Manu Chao.\n\nMM: Yes, but these digital distributors, these companies who are making this, they have thousands of artists. There is not an editorial line that they support, no. They just give the service, they put your music in Spotify and in other platforms and they have thousands of artists. So if you are one of those artists, they are not going to push you because they have thousands. If you don’t have enough return, they remove you. There is no editorial or promotional intention in these companies.\n\nSC: That’s the monopole of the Big Industry who decides now who can be good or not good, you know. That’s why when I have been to Visa for Music, there I have met really young people, new people, good artists who need support. That’s why one of my goals working with world music is to try how to help these good artists who haven’t money. I mean, you can come to WOMEX, but which artists have enough money to come to WOMEX? So if at some time I have to make speech at WOMEX I have to say that WOMEX needs to help, to try to make small WOMEX in India one time, like they are doing with WOMAD, you know WOMAD is changing the place. So we have to do the same with WOMEX, to get little bit chance for people in Sri Lanka, in Vietnam… to be known. So that is the big challenge for the future. It’s not having Salif turning 60 years. I mean, I am happy that he still works but… you understand what I mean, you know.\n\n“One of my goals working with world music is to try how to help these good artists who haven’t money […] to get little bit chance for people in Sri Lanka, in Vietnam… to be known. So that is the big challenge for the future.”\n\nMM: Yes, Said… This that you are talking about now is a big concern I am having recently, especially when I started to work with Ali but not only. The last times I’ve have been interviewing people from more complicated countries like Lebanon for instance, or Imed Alibi from Tunisia. And well this the people I talk with, of course, they are inside the industry, let’s say. But I think about so many artists that are excluded from this. You say “how are they going to come to WOMEX? They don’t have money to fly, of course, of course. But even, more basically, many artists they are out from the circuit of even knowing what WOMEX is. And they are there, and they are making wonderful things but they are not in the industry. The industry is totally looking to other side. And there is the other world that we don’t imagine, out from the industry. And me, Mapamundi is me. With Juan Antonio we make Mundofonías. But we are so little… And you are also you one person fighting all your life against all those crises. So what are we going to do to, somehow, try to amend this? Because there are so many artists totally excluded. They won’t even apply for WOMEX. What can we do?\n\nSC: Your initiative to contact me is itself a great idea to cooperate in the future. Yes, I’m someone with long experience in the world music, working without a big publicity about me. You found me because you are curious about music and musicians. Each person, artist, have something to give. Never underestimate people. The people should learn to take intitiative like you, so that together we can get through the monoply of the music industry. Your contact made me very happy. I said to myself, here’s someone who understood what is going on. Together we can do a lot for the musicians and for the world in general. Music bring peace, help poverty and create jobs. We talk always about the new releases, the music charts, concerts, festivals but never how complicated it is the situation of artists. The visa problem, the war in Niger, sub-Saharan refugees. The problem of today is that we don’t know each other well as promoters or music experts, except by Facebook or Instagram or when we meet it is always in hurry somewhere in some exhibitions changing visit card witch we don’t know from where it comes. We need to come closer.\n\nBut we have to meet to speak about these problems. Because no one speaks about these problems. You go to WOMEX, you have artists performing, people they come, they sign a contract and that’s it. But all the work behind, like we have said, all the small artists who need to come, all the small promoters… I was on the way to go to Bangladesh but their Festival is cancel… I was very interested in going to Bangladesh to discover musicians there which I know they can do much in Europe when the people discovered them and at the same time you help these artists. I mean we can’t only think about the money, we have to think to find the better way than just to meet five minutes, interchange visit cards quickly. From Sweden I have tried to help Visa for Music because I know there are poor artists who are coming there and who are good. And through Visa for Music, many artists have succeeded, gnawa groups are touring now in the world, you have Bab L’ Bluz, you have really many artists who have been discovered through this small festival.\n\nFor us, small promoter and small artists, we need each other and to be closer and again, this contact can by the chance for the artist. It’s not a favour you make for the friend, no, it’s not that concept. I mean if Ali come to Stockholm I will try because he’s a good artist. I believe that people need to discover these artists. So of course, I do my best to help the artist best and the audience, because I know the audience trust me. When I bring an artist they know that Said brings something good.\n\n“For us, small promoter and small artists, we need each other and to be closer and again, this contact can by the chance for the artist. It’s not a favour you make for the friend.”\n\nMM: It’s a great idea to talk between us about these things because, as you said, WOMEX is a is a business and I understand we can’t ask them to resolve this situation because it is a private company. They also have to fight for their salaries, they have to make their work and they have to have profit. So all this conversation of the last minutes is something parallel to the industry and how to include these people. For me, the important is that these people in those countries get a better living and that their art is not lost and is known in the rest of the world. Because it makes me so happy when I listen wonderful things. For instance I have tried to bring an Albanian band to Western Europe. The musicians that are wonderful but they don’t speak English. The flights are super complicated and they have to go by road to Tirana… So it’s so complicated for someone like me. I have to convince someone to give me 10,000 euros for bringing them to Spain or to Portugal. And sometimes who has that money doesn’t have that sensitivity to realise this is worth of it. So this is the fight I have inside me, how to make this, because these people are over there and the rest of the world is losing their art, we are not enjoying that and, also, the people in those countries, with the time they will just do other things. If they can’t make a good living in their life with music they will just quit music, they will do other things and we all will lose this. So I’m very concerned about this.\n\nSC: There is something too which we have think about, there is a second problem with visas, you know. It makes me sick because I have direct contact with artists. Now from Niger, the last time they haven’t come, even Tinariwen, you know, they are big. They have cancelled the tours of the last year. I have been with Tinariwen in their home in Sahara, they are not interested in living in Paris or in New York, you know. They are not. They are making their job and they return. There are big artists like Fatoumata Diawara and Amadou and Marian, they have to unite and to speak about these problems, to put pressure on the government. The artists together they can make too much pressure on the government. Like in the 80s, there was a big gala of solidarity for the people in Ethiopia.Now there are too many things happening with all these refugees in Mali, in Niger… you know. I mean, who can speak about them. if they are not the artists? Some artists don’t even get visa, even if there is a promoter to pay everything. Me and you, of course, together with the artists, with all these people, we can make pressure to the governments. For instance, if you get a card of artist, you have to get visa, there’s no discussion about it. But this solidarity is again needed but no one speaks about it. Maybe if an artist didn’t come, the day after, the newspaper writes that it is because they didn’t get the visa. So, again, we have to together, media, promoters, artists… There is too much work left.\n\nMM: Yes and we have to identify who else has this thinking because maybe not everybody cares about this, yeah.\n\nSC: Exactly, you are right, that’s why we have to make people understand that. We must be united to fight against the monopoly of the big industry, as an exemple, the ones from Spotify. The meetings on WOMEX can’t be just to promote artists and be a meeting place for promoters. There are other problems we need to talk about. It needed more panels and people engaged to raise visa problem.I’d hope there will be more engagement from artists as Youssou Ndour, Salif Keita, Manu Chao, etc… to organize charity concerts, to find a way how to do charity concerts to help people, as it was done before. These artists has a big power to put pressure on government.\n\nMM: Next year WOMEX is in Manchester. For some more people it is a problem because even the Serbians, for instance, need visa for going to United Kingdom. So it could be a good frame to talk about this.\n\n– After this latest reflection, we made some little plans for the future, but the interview hasn’t ended yet –\n\nMM: I wanted to talk with you because I think your example can be very inspiring, you have a broad vision of what has happen and I wanted, before ending, you to talk a bit about this new book that you have prepared.\n\nSC: To work on it is really interesting. I have always been fascinated about this concept of “world music”, created by English people in 1987. Some people don’t like it because they bring all the music from the world in the same the bag, you know. In France you have the parallel term, that is is “sono mondiale”, created in 1983. At that time, according to the director of the music distribution company Melody, at the beginning of the 1980s, if you went to America to promote an African artist, there were no shops of world music, there were of pop, rock, jazz, classic… So he went to the jazz store and they didn’t want albums of African music together with the others. So, where to find African records in France? In the African small stores, that are selling food, textiles… they know each other and they had some cassettes and CDs.When the producers began to find this music, they got fascinated music and began to promote it but they didn’t have where to put them in the stores. That’s why those English people created the term “world music”, so, when you go to the store and you want to find Salif Keita or Boubacar Traoré or Ali, you go to “world music”. Many people don’t like the term because they say that those English people put all the world music in the same bag: Latinos, African, Arab, Indian…\n\n“ What I have done, better than reading 100 books, is to find that people who created the concept in England in 1987. […] I wanted to know exactly which is the definition from that people who are criticized”\n\nWhat have I done? I have tried to make a definition of “world music”. Each people have their own definition. The reason to make this book is when I was invited to make a lecture about world music in a school. I thought it would be easy, it could take me five minutes to prepare the lecture. And when I began to read the books, each one has his/her own explanation. So what I have done, better than reading 100 books, is to find that people who created the concept in England in 1987. It was not easy. 27 promotors, journalists and music lovers met in London in a pub and decided to create the term “world music”. I wanted to know exactly which is the definition from that people who are criticized. It was not easy because they are in higher positions and they don’t know me. I sent them emails and they didn’t answer. Thanks to my contacts, like the manager of Tinariwen, I met people like Ben Mandelson, he gave me other contacts… After a few years I have met all that people. Sometimes it took six months before the answer. At the end, it was a long work, I have succeeded in interviewing all these people, asking them how the idea began, what was the purpose and why some people don’t like it.\n\nAll this is the book, to say the truth of what is “world music”. You don’t need to buy 100 books; I have made all those interviews and I have made a retrospective of before 1987 how they arrived to “world music”, from the African music of the 50s, how it has grown.Before France, Abidjan was the capital of the world music. And then in the 80s, because of the economic problems in Ivory Coast, all the people moved to Paris: Salif Keita, Mori Kante, Youssou N’Dour, Manu Dibango… all those people moved to Paris at the beginning of the 80s and there they began to produce. The book is not to about my life, it is about this complexity of the term “world music”. You understand this better from someone who have been close than from the books. I’ve got the information direct from the mouth of those people.\n\nThank you very much, Said!!! 🙏🏻 We look forward to the book launch.\n\nUPBEAT PLATFORM: BEST NEW TALENT AWARD FOR ZARINA PRVASEVDA\n\nI like this news. When I participated as a jury for this award together with Balázs Weyer and Chris Eckman, this Macedonian singer was one of those I supported to pass to the next step. After our judging, a shortlist of 10 finalists was created, which went on to the voting phase by the public. The truth is that there has been an extraordinary level and several other artists would have also been excellent winners. You can consult here the list of those 10 finalists. I hope they have the best of luck in their careers and, for now, congratulations, Zarina!\n\nHere is Zarina live with her band:\n\nBRIEF NEWS FROM THE MEDIA, CHARTS AND SISTER PROJECTS\n\n#1 for Transglobal World Music Chart in October 2023 is: Jarak Qaribak, by Dudu Tassa & Jonny Greenwood\n\nMundofonías: the three favourites of the month are Aga Khan Master Musicians’s Nowruz, Bolinus brandaris [V.A.] and Eliza Carthy Trio’s Conversations we’ve had before.\n\nReminder\n\nTALK AT WOMEX: RESHAPING THE NARRATIVE\n\nThe complete name of this panel is Reshaping the Narrative – Gender, authority and new approaches to music journalism.\n\nThe other ladies are Martyna van Nieuwland and Andrea Voets.

I begin this editorial with a photo of myself and Ludovico Esposito. He is the protagonist of this edition. I met him at Balkan:MOST, but I had previously had my eye on him and contacted him to have a chat there.Some ideas I had seen on his profile on the festival’s intranet had caught my attention: “Ludovico uses music as a medium for recreational, educational, tourism, and humanitarian-environmental purposes, producing concerts, festivals, capacity-building programs, and fundraising events in support of devastated geographical areas“. In recent times I have been reflecting a lot on questions concerning the use of music (and also the use of the musicians). Also on other issues that I am recurrently mentioning here, such as the exclusion from the world music industry of many artists who make “world music”, caused by several issues. I will not dwell on this now.\n\nBut related to this issues, at Balkan:MOST I also met Amita Vempati, development manager of the organisation Artistic Freedom Initiative, which is dedicated to creating the conditions for artists who are unable to develop their work in their countries because they are experiencing censorship, persecution, forced displacement, armed conflict or humanitarian crisis.\n\nThey support them in several ways, like through legal and practical support to settle in the USA. They are also starting to work in Europe. We are talking about artists in situations like those who can be getting support from the French organisation L’Atelier des Artistes en Exil, about which I spoke in the previous edition in the conversation with Imed Alibi. Read that edition, the #62, here.\n\nThese people I am talking about have been an important part of my Balkan:MOST experience. Another essential part has been David Sierra, my colleague with whom I share many things (I made him an interview for this newsletter, that is available here). I want to mention him because we had some fascinating conversations. I was also able to meet other old friends who have been through this newsletter before, such as Bojan Djordjevic, from the Todo Mundo festival (his interview, from 2019, is here) and to meet in person others with whom I was in contact from afar, such as András Halmos, who was also a protagonist (his interview, much recent, is here).\n\nThe truth is that I feel very privileged to meet these people and to be at these events. All of this gives me a lot of food for thought. Perhaps for other people, being in these environments comes as no surprise. For me, it is still very exciting. Well, I have a lot of excitement coming up in October… I’ll tell you about it below. But now, it’s time to give a voice to others. They are sure to be of great interest to you.\n\nRemember: if you have any news of interest for our community, let me know. Thank you very much for your attention.\n\nAraceli Tzigane | Mapamundi Música | +34 676 30 28 82\n\nA&A MUSIC BOOKING, JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN MAPAMUNDI MÚSICA AND ASYA MUSIC & MANAGEMENT\n\nLet me tell you a story. In February I travelled to Istanbul. It was the same week as the earthquakes. I’m sure you remember it. I almost didn’t go… I was going to travel for a concert of Ali Doğan Gönültaş. We were going to shoot a video of the concert and do a photo session.\n\nBoth things were cancelled but I kept the trip. I had already paid for everything and I had some meetings that we were still able to keep.\n\nOne of the meetings was with Martin Greve, who I was going to meet for the first time, after the suggestion by Birgit Ellinghaus. Martin and me had arranged to meet in Üsküdar, in the Asian part of Istanbul. But due to a misunderstanding, I ended up in Kadıköy…\n\nMartin came over, we had coffee, dinner, and at one point it occurred to him to call his friend Asya Arslantaş, who is in more or less the same line of work as me and she lived close to that place. Well, all this seems like a chain of events linked in a very fragile way, which led us to meet each other.\n\nThe truth is that everything in life is like that. It has all been so improbable as to be almost impossible. But it happened!\n\nAsya was my protagonist in this edition of March. The truth is that we saw that we had a very similar approach to working with music and after several conversations, we decided to start a common path, of which this concert programme that you have here is the first proposal. Soon we will also have a website 🥳.\n\nYou can download a dossier with more information, here.\n\nAND NOW THE FLOOR IS FOR: LUDOVICO ESPOSITO\n\nLudovico is the president of Sud Sonico. He was invited to Balkan:MOST to make a keynote during the pitching session. I took the picture above during his speech. He talked there for 4 minutes. But I was priviledged with more than 40 minutes of conversation with him 🥳.\n\nHis artistic focus is what he calls as advanced music, with a strong pressence of electronics. That is a very different focus than mine, as I work mainly with acoustic music connected with the tradition. However, many of the things he explains seem to me to be very interesting and useful and applicable to any cultural initiative, especially when we work with material that is far from the mainstream.\n\nBut without further ado, I will share the content of the interview.\n\nMapamundi Música: You have the Association Sud Sonico, the Festival Avant, the Xenomorph Sounds concert series, and Sagra Elettronica.\n\nLudovico Esposito: Sagra Elettronica is not going on. The project stopped since Covid. It was designed to be a modern food and electronic music event. In South of Italy, sagra is a street food format dedicated to specific ingredients. It might be sagra of octopus, sagra of aubergine… So the usual is to go there and listen to folk music and eat non-quality dishes. We wanted to create a modern sagra as a very high-quality street food and with quality electronic music. So we did two editions, but since Covid we could not bring it forward. As a 1000-people capacity event, it was challenging to keep the public security-capacity balanced. Although it was a successful project, we just stopped investing energies in it, and instead worked on “safer” and smaller event concepts. Food, installations, people gathering, dancing and eating in old farms… Sagra Elettronica has been a great format, it has been done in the right time, and looked ahead of it proudly.\n\nSagra Elettronica @ Atraz Emilia\n\n.\n\nOn the other hand, we invested in another project, in Avant, a different concept but the same soul. It is a boutique festival to create an intimate atmosphere and unite the beauties of our traditions with avantgarde music. We basically welcome 300 guests over a weekend of events. We have daytime and evening activities. During the day, we present wine tasting, food tasting and hiking or trekking on the Adriatic Sea. And in the evening, we present avantgarde music concerts, electronica, experimental electroacoustic and any hybrid sound or performance. But also, DJ sets. So we listen to quality music and we dance and we enjoy a weekend of togetherness in our spectacular panoramas and with our spectacular food and wine. It functions as a slow intimate tourism experiences, through music. It is a “more-adult” and intimate format than Sagra Elettronica. It is basically the same concept, but designed for a different fruition and for different targets.\n\nMM: I have seen that your approach to music or to art is recreational, educational and therapeutic. And you focus the art somehow for equality, it has kind of political or philosophical approach…\n\nLE: Yes, we have a benefit approach, so our association works and, in general, uses music for different purposes. When I mean recreational purposes, I refer to social cohesion and togetherness through live events like the festivals Sagra Electronica and AVANT, or the concert series Xenomorph sounds. These are different projects that serve to enable people to have fun and to stay together.\n\n.\n\n“The idea of our educational approach is that, today, a sustainable and impactful project needs vertical skills and vertical vision. So it’s not only about marketing, communication or fundraising, but it’s about having a vertical approach, a vertical vision on projects.”\n\n.\n\nAbout educational. We produce “Avant Learn – Advanced Music XLR8R”, a training program to enable young people or even freelancers to work better on music projects. This project was funded by MusicAIRE last year and it is pretty unique in Europe. The idea of our educational approach is that, today, a sustainable and impactful project needs vertical skills and vertical vision. So it’s not only about marketing, communication or fundraising, but it’s about having a vertical approach, a vertical vision on projects. So we organize free-entry master classes about music marketing, communication, fundraising, production, but also contemporary and modern ones like music tourism, sustainability, international fundraising, digital project management, data & science, copyright. We help the students to be independent to and produce independently any sort of projects, from a festival, a record label, a technology start-up. I think that the reason why it got co-funded is because it is – and looked – as necessary for music organizations to cover so many different areas in terms of management, or at least, to have a clue on what it means to work on sustainability, music tourism or fundraising, and be able to delegate. We cannot do everything by ourselves, but we must be able to handle any area of a project and to delegate, to supervise and to track the impact.\n\nAbout the therapeutical approach: we did few seminar and laboratories on music therapy, we did such activities for children, but even for adults or for disabled people. So we help people to feel better through sound and music. We recently slowed down our focus on music therapy too, at the moment is not a primary activity for us.\n\nMM: You, about the educational part. You have at least to know that those areas of activity are there and they must be covered. You have to know that they exist.\n\nLE: “Avant Learn” is indeed meant to compensate such gap. For any educational section of the program, we hire a specialized professor, or we cover them ourselves. I can teach myself fundraising, project management, administration… For music tourism, I ask a colleague from Milan. For sustainability, I asked an Italian collegue, plus we collaborate with other entities in Italy and Europe that works on music festival impact reduction in terms of energy, water, waste recycling, purchase – any sustainability topics of the Agenda 2030.\n\n“Avant Learn” offers a highly advanced learning model, as the students satisfaction rate was very high. In terms of scaleup, we work on different scaling approaches. We are considering if and how to evolve in also in a e-learning program, to develop a digital methodology-sharing platform and not only an in-presence project. We also envision it as a point of touch between European organisations seeking to hire new talents, and new talents looking for traineeships in Europe.\n\nWe are working to export it in several nations, by designing training programs tailored for the needs and goals of music organizations. For example, an organization in Europe asked us to train five of their volunteers in arts fundraising. So we designed an advanced learning project for that organization. A booking agency ask us to design a program for their artists to reinforce their skills in digital copyright, contracting, intellectual property… So we just produced one course, and not a complete training program. It results to be scalable, and shaped specifically for one organization or one specific project. We aim to help organizations, citizens, people in any form which is possible through sound and music.\n\nMM: My newsletter is sent to professionals working on what I do and also from festivals. If they want to have a consultancy with you about those topics, can they contact you for that service?\n\nLE: Of course. This specific project “Avant Learn”, but in general our organization Sud Sonico, works in two different fields: the production of our own projects and advise and support to improve specific areas of an organization or project in terms of management, fundraising, cooperation and scaleup, engaging with citizens, artists, public administration and municipalities, cultural bodies or festival organizations… We can cover pretty much any area which is needed today to make projects sustainable, make individuals independent, smarter, more flexible and ready to afford the new challenges of the music and creative industries.\n\nMM: And do you make all this under the frame of Sud Sonico?\n\nLE: Yes and no, my role in Sud Sonico as a President is not only to do fundraising, but to improve the non-profit projects of the organization in any possible capacity and scale. As a freelance, I offer music fundraising and project management consultancies. Our organization can collaborate with you mostly in some capacities, me as an individual, in others. Our associates and volunteers are amazing and their support in production and execution is fundamental. We are always open for collaboration ideas.\n\nWe recently launched a new project, that expanded our vision. It is called Música Etica (in English, Etic Music). It is a project which aim is to use music as a medium for humanitarian or environmental awareness purposes. We produced one even this year. As simple as it may sound, we played electronic music and we choose a humanitarian cause to support, asking donations to help us supporting it. This year, we wanted to support the victims of the earthquake in Syria and Turkey. So, we settled a partnership with Save The Children Italy, and they were happy to help us promote the event and distribute the donations on site to children and families. We are trying and open to boost this project on an international scale, to open bridges with Middle East and, in general, with real humanitarian and environmental organizations supporting the planet in any form.\n\nSud Sonico is using music in many capacities, with many ideas and concepts, but the key goal is the same: to create benefits, to create a positive impact, not locally but worldwide.\n\nBanner of Musica Etica, from Sud Sonico’s Facebook page\n\nMM: About Xenomorph Sounds, tell me more.\n\nLE: It is a concert series, so it is a single one-day event. It is a kind of Avant Festival, in a smaller proportion. If there are not enough financial resources, we produce smaller, but always quality events, and Xenomorph Sounds is Sud Sonico’s live music event project. We have produced 4 events with Italian and international experimental solo performers. Xenomorph is about showcasing a wide range of new music genres: electronic, experimental, electroacoustic, ambient, jazz, impro, and anything we think can fit the context. Equally to Avant or Sagra Elettronica, or like Musica Etica, we have no sound limit: as far is it avantgarde music, we can book any act. And depending on the venue, the atmosphere, the period, if it is summer or autumn… we shape, we design a program that unites a series of goals and needs. We produced this concert series in castles, in cultural centres, in bars… our aim is to make avantgarde music the most accessible as possible. We invited exceptional musicians like Italy’s ambient wizard Gigi Masin, Italian saxophonist Laura Agnusdei, Austrian drummer Katharina Ernst, Japanese noise performer Yuko Araki, the band Give Guitars to People.\n\nMM: Why did you come here to Balkan:MOST?\n\nLE: Because I was invited as a delegate from the festival to run keynote about the topic “Music as a Medium for Impact”. I was invited in Athens earlier this year for another conference festival, Athens Music week, and in a panel we discussed a few project ideas – funding opportunities – to create a new expanded Southern Europe Network including Balkans. It is a vivid geographical area that has a lot of potential, and still not much attention from corporate and media. So, Georges Perot, the founder of Athens Music Week, together with other delegates, discussed the possibility of expanding the cooperation, vision and operational projects from Spain and Portugal until the end of the Balkans, with the idea to create a network for cooperation and collaboration in a broader sense and capacity. I’m here at Balkan:MOST to try bringing ahead this idea, and share it with other music professionals.\n\nAthens Music Week 2023\n\nMM: So, in the artistic part, the focus of your work is the avantgarde music. Do you have any relationship also with the traditional music from the region of Lecce?\n\nLE: Not that much, because of my personal choice, or yes, depending on the perspective. The music heritage traditional music in Lecce is mainly traditional music, and has little to do with avantgarde. Not many traditional musicians here contaminate with contemporary languages. If musicians play just one instrument, it normally doesn’t fit on our idea of avantgarde programming, although we made exceptions. It is not that we don’t like traditional music, but our artistic direction selects avant-garde music and not traditional-only artists. One exception is Maria Mazzotta: a local singer who recently started a project with Raul Refree, a Spanish composer and producer who also released music on Mute Records. I appreciate much their new project, because it is about our tradition, and about electronic music. We have several folk avantgarde projects that we would like to invite but it depends on the kind of event, the funding… There are many things that should come together for us to give space to an avantgarde yet traditional performers.\n\nMM: Why do you do all this? Which is your personal background that took you finally to make this?\n\nLE: I started to work in the field almost 10 years ago. I started to play music by case, 15 years ago I played electric guitar, and 10 years ago I started to collaborate for the organization of some music events. I attended a lot of events in Berlin, which shaped my vision and taste very much. When in Berlin, my taste and my vision kept improving and I started my own agency We Care PR. It was a promotional & pr agency for artists, record labels and festivals. I collaborated from the smallest blog to BBC Radio, placing electronic, experimental and club music in different channels, media and helping artists to reach new audiences. At the same time, I was organizing club events in Lecce, my city. First, semi-legal techno events, inviting the artists I was dancing to when in Berlin. The success and network were getting stronger and stronger… And 8 years ago, I started to realise that the projects should find a sustainability in medium-long term. As I have a degree in social & consumer psychology, and a master in marketing and communication, it was natural to me to approach fundraising. So, my background helped me approach medium-big corporations and get funding from the beginning. And I continued to diversify my vision and skills. I continued to invest on myself in advanced training, and to share new skills and goals with my team. I started to do fundraising myself, starting from corporate, and moving to public funding and philanthropy. I think there must always be space and time to learn new skills. In my opinion, individual donations and philanthropy are the solution for music, arts and creative industry on an international scale.\n\n.\n\n“I work on Sud Sonico’s fundraising, but also support other organizations in achieving new funding, and expanding the network of potential funding partners. I believe this is the solution for us to be independent and to continue to work with creativity even without public funding which, in my opinion, will be continued to be cut down, year per year for the next 15 years.”\n\n.\n\nHere on Balkan:MOST we have just listened to Mila Georgieva talking about the major part of the cultural organizations relying too much on public funding. I realised this myself 5 years ago and I started to work on fundraising diversification for my own organization, but as well to advice other organizations to start diversify and not relying only on municipalities, Minister or Creative Europe. I work on Sud Sonico’s fundraising, but also support other organizations in achieving new funding, and expanding the network of potential funding partners. I believe this is the solution for us to be independent and to continue to work with creativity even without public funding which, in my opinion, will be continued to be cut down, year per year for the next 15 years. The cultural and economic panorama of Europe is changing, it is decreasing, and we need to work on other directions. As a person with wide interests in geopolitics, humanitarian topics, cultural topics, circular economy topics… I try to look very much ahead and be ready for the change that is imposed for the cultural organization.\n\nMM: What are the corporations searching for, to decide to give you some thousands of euros?\n\nLE: The goal of corporate can be focussed on the improvement of different areas: social & cultural impact; environmental & green sustainability goals; employees’ welfare; sponsorships. Corporate basically support non-profit projects to achieve results in one or more of the aforementioned areas of public interest. Marketing and external relation offices do look actively for projects, and the best fundraising consultants would analyse the profile of the corporation, the marketing managers, the corporate external relations manager and, from the analysis, the consultant will find strategy to penetrate. Which is not easy. It takes time, effort and knowledge, sensibility and capacity of negotiation, flexibility of approach.\n\nThe goals of corporations are different from the goal of other private bodies, like foundations. Private foundations release funding in order to pursue social, cultural, environmental purposes, and more. Of course, there are some foundations supporting health, foundations supporting welfare and so on. Foundations are ruled by their own statutes, so it is necessary to analysing the formal aspects too. The analytical process we applied for corporate, should be reshaped for other funding partners.\n\nAnd the approach to request funds is different from corporation to corporation. It needs to be a tailored fundraising approach, it is not possible to automatize the process: I would never suggest a non-profit organization to send the identical request to many corporations and many foundations. Fundraising is about a constant analysis, design and craft of words, goals, perspective of project development, perspective of project scale up, impact tracking, and budgeting. It’s very complex: there are many areas to enhance in one system. This approach to project management and development is, in my opinion, the only solution for non-profit organizations to survive, be independent, and getting a decent remuneration.\n\nMM: Do you want to share any last idea?\n\nLE: I would like to specify once again – in case it was not clear – and I and we want to use sound and music as a medium for worldwide impact. We desire and want to cooperate for humanitarian projects, environmental projects, cultural projects, cultural heritage projects, tourism projects, educational projects, performing projects, networking projects. We are a young organization but incredible skilled and ready to face any project in any capacity, and we look forward to continue our growing path and continue helping as many people as possible.\n\nThank you, Ludovico! 🙏\n\nUPDATE ABOUT BABEL MUSIC XP FROM ITS DIRECTOR, OLIVIER REY\n\nA few days ago I corresponded with Olivier Rey. I asked him if they already have the jury for the selection of the Babel Music XP showcases. He told me that they are working on it and updated me on a few things. Of course, he mentioned the decease of Bernard Aubert.\n\nI asked him for permission to shape his message and share it with you, as I find it interesting:\n\n“The Fiesta des Suds, Marseille’s biggest and most historic festival, runs from 5 to 8 October. Its director and founder, Bernard Aubert, passed away in mid-August. This news has obviously affected the teams and has forced us to offer additional content to pay tribute to Bernard’s character.\n\nAbout Babel Music XP, we’re delighted with this relaunch edition in 2023, which has been acclaimed by everyone. We brought together 1,500 professionals from 72 countries.but we’re also aware of the areas we need to develop to make the market more attractive. This means going international, working with world music players, opening up to contemporary music, which often programmes our styles without realising it, and many other things.\n\nThe dates for Babel Music XP 2024 are 28 to 30 March. A number of projects have already been launched. The call for applications received 2,300 projects, demonstrating the extraordinary expectations surrounding an event like Babel. The good news is that we’ll be able to use the Dock des Suds for showcases once again this year. Quite apart from the acoustics (especially of the venue), it’s vital for me to have the 3 stages under the same roof, so that all the professionals can come together. The showcases are open to both professionals and the general public (10,000 spectators last year).\n\nAs far as the selection committee is concerned, it will meet in mid-November and we hope to announce the selection in mid-December (a month earlier than last year) so that everyone can get organised and plan their visit to Marseille. The jury is currently being finalised. I’d like to renew a third of it each year, both to bring in new blood and to keep a record of our work from one year to the next.”\n\nThank you, Olivier! 🙏\n\nUpdate\n\nEUROPEAN FOLK DAY\n\nFinally, the first ever European Folk Day took place on 23rd of September. It gathered 226 events in 32 countries.

It started even in Ostrava for the Czech Music Crossroads…\n\n🟨 Czech Music Crossroads 🟨\n\nThis professional meeting took place in Ostrava from 28 June to 1 July. As I mentioned earlier, Mapamundi Música sponsored the participation of Spain as the guest country, with performances by Vigüela, Xabi Aburruzaga and Xurxo Fernandes. I chose three artists from three of the cultures that make up my country of birth. Besides them, I especially enjoyed the concerts of two of the bands from Slovenia, which was the other guest country: the very young Gugutke and the more experienced and also extraordinary Teo Collori & Momento Cigano. And also Sutari, the Polish women’s trio, who also won the Crossroads professional award.\n\nBesides the concerts there was also a series of talks. Among them, I myself spoke on behalf of Transglobal World Music Chart, together with Milan Tesař, coordinator of World Music Charts Europe, about both initiatives. Svenja Mahlstede gave a very interesting talk about sync licensing. Piotr Pucyło gave a series of practical tips for artists and managers on issues such as technical rider and photography.\n\nIn addition, there were formal and informal moments for the exchange of ideas. I have captured one of them in a very specific way: the conversation with Nabil Canaan during the speed datings. I had not planned to interview him beforehand, but as soon as we started talking I understood that it was of great interest to give him space here. So he is the protagonist of this edition.\n\nIn this picture you have all or almost all the international delegates and part of the Crossroads team:\n\nI hope you enjoy the content. I think it is very interesting. And as always, if you have something to share with the global community that is dedicated in one way or another to these musics, let me know.\n\nRemember: if you have any news of interest for our community, let me know. Thank you very much for your attention.\n\nAraceli Tzigane | Mapamundi Música | +34 676 30 28 82\n\nAND NOW THE FLOOR IS FOR: NABIL CANAAN\n\nWhile you read, listen to the the playlist of Shuruq Sessions, here 🎧\n\nIt is quite obvious that I have been thinking for some time about the situation in many parts of the world regarding the access of artists to the so-called world music circuits and how there are various mechanisms of exclusion.\n\nThe economic ones are very obvious, of course. The other day I was talking to Ali Doğan Gönültaş in the van after his concert at the SoNna Festival, about the money that has to be advanced for flights and other aspects before receiving payment from the festival. In Spain practically no public entity pays in advance, not even for travel expenses, so the agent or the artist has to advance all that money. If they can’t, they will be excluded from that program because the regulation is very strict in these respects.\n\nThere are administrative barriers as well. Last year I helped a colleague from Italy to issue an invoice, fulfilling the bureaucratic requirements of his client, a Spanish municipality. Even within the EU itself it was a pain to get the invoice issued, imagine if you don’t have a European agent.\n\nAnd of course, there is the issue of visas, an extra source of stress.\n\nAll these limitations apply to artists who are somehow in the “industry”. Many others will not even come to deal with them and will never transcend into the international arena. I’m fine with that if that’s what they want and if they can make a living in their local or national market. In many cases this is not the situation.\n\nAll this is to say that I found it very interesting to talk to Nabil Canaan about his initiatives. You will understand very soon. I met Nabil Canaan during the last edition of Czech Music Crossroads that took place in Ostrava from 28th of June to 1st of July. In his profile as delegate of the event he is presented as “co-founder of Station Beirut arts platform, director of its cultural centre in Beirut, producer of its international projects. After an earlier career in marketing and technology, Nabil pivoted into the creative industries twenty years ago as a cultural change agent in journalism, film and arts.” The complete profile is available here.\n\nBefore reading the interview, it is useful to check out the platform Shuruq Music, that is mentioned below. And the website of Station Beirut.\n\nMapamundi Música: You are the founder of the cultural center Station Beirut. You are Lebanese, aren’t you?\n\nNabil Canaan: I was born in Lebanon. I’ve lived in Nigeria, Switzerland, France, New York, Cyprus… I’ve worked with Japanese companies, Korean companies… and we opened Station in an old wood factory in Beirut in 2013.\n\nMM: 10 years ago. Is it your job currently?\n\nNC: Yes, I’m the director, booker, I handle artistic direction and other management roles as well.\n\nMM: And when you decided to make this, I suppose you were taking some risks… Because you have been working in places, let’s say, economically developed and without any problems, with a lot of regulations and so. Why did you want to make this?\n\nNC: I’ve been working for about 30 years. First ten years I worked in corporate environments in marketing and technology and then after that, I was looking for something more meaningful in life. So I moved into journalism (with The New York Times in New York), film, and development, working with UN agencies on projects in West Africa, Levant region and North Africa. Combining all that with my partner at the time we said “okay, what can we do within the Middle East/North Africa region through arts and culture to try and advance some social aspects?”. We decided to set up Station with a mission of “arts and culture for social transformation”. We deliver this through our programming in visual arts, live arts, and via more mainstream events like urban markets and stand-up comedy. All of it is geared towards programming artists with a social practice, meaning people who have socially engaged arts projects that address human rights, women’s rights, gay rights, the environment… Projects that invite critical thinking towards social and political change.\n\n“There’s a lack of, let’s say, professional structures and market linkages for exports. So there’s a lot of potential for development, to say it positively.”\n\n.\n\nWe worked a lot with photography, film, video art, visual arts in general… And on the live side our core focus is Music, but we also program theatre, stand up and storytelling, looking to identify and present the next generation of artists from the region who are collectively trying to make some change. We work in a region where, in general, there’s a lot of censorship, where there are still some conservative views. There are, you know, infrastructural issues as well. There’s a lack of, let’s say, professional structures and market linkages for exports. So there’s a lot of potential for development, to say it positively.\n\n“The idea for the Shuruq platform is to identify, elevate and transmit music productions from the SWANA region to the world.”\n\n.\n\nGiven my development background working on sector strengthening projects, in 2019 we created the concept for a platform called “SHURUQ”, which in Arabic means sunrise, a metaphor for emerging talents, new beginnings, moving towards the light. The idea for the Shuruq platform is to identify, elevate and transmit music productions from the SWANA* region to the world.\n\n* Swana: South West Asia/North Africa.\n\nMM: For my newsletter I am trying to talk about these issues that affect the music… You have talked about censorships. For instance, I work with an artist with whom I’m facing this situation because of his background and the place where he lives, he faces discrimination for several reasons. When I started with him, I didn’t really know about him, but we must face the visa issue, we have the Schengen visa for one year, so it’s going quite well with him. He sings in minority languages. About the censorship, he has suffered cancellations of concerts… But let’s continue about Station Beirut and Shuruq.\n\nNC: Keep in mind that during the past three weird years living through corona, in Lebanon you have to add revolution, economic meltdown, explosion of the Beirut port, the dramatic 90% devaluation of the currency, exodus of talent… It’s really a lot of challenges for a small country. We’ve also had the Syria war next door since 2011, with over 2 million refugees in Lebanon. There are a lot of issues still going on.So, in the midst of all these challenges, we created Shuruq Music Platform as a way to elevate and transmit artists and music productions from the region to the rest of the world. Shuruq is built on four pillars: there’s a Capacity Building/Training side, there’s a Content Production side, Music Marketing and International Bookings. We’ve already delivered a set of trainings, produced live performance music videos and we launched a Shuruq Music YouTube channel that you can follow. Shuruq is also of course on Instagram, Spotify, Anghami and the other main DSPs.In November 2022 I reopened our Station venue in Beirut to restart presenting live music. We’ve booked about 16 bands since, about two concerts a month. It’s what the country can handle right now. People don’t mind going clubbing but live concerts…that’s more challenging. We have to re-engage audiences. I think this week we found out that everyone’s having challenges with audiences.\n\n“We’re looking to build partnerships for export development, first within the region, then across the Mediterranean, Balkans, onto Western Europe and beyond.”\n\n.\n\nWhat we’re looking to develop now are bookings. We started already last year at The Great Escape in the UK by booking Rasha Nahas, a Palestinian artist based in Berlin. Last week we booked Lebanese hip-hop artist El Rass in Canada, two dates in Toronto and Montreal. In September we’re booking a band at the Arabesques Festival in Montpellier, France, and in October, three bands at Les Docks in Lausanne, Switzerland… We want to help promote not just from Lebanon, but from across the southern Mediterranean region and Levant. We’re looking to build partnerships for export development, first within the region, then across the Mediterranean, Balkans, onto Western Europe and beyond.\n\n“By calling it Swana, and not Middle East North Africa, it allows us to also go beyond Arabic-speaking music alone, to include Kurdish, Berber, Turkic languages, Farsi, Armenian, etc, where there is a shared history, shared culture, food, instruments and somehow the microtonal modal sounds.”\n\n.\n\nWe’re very confident that there’s a lot of very good talent in this region. What they need is to understand better how to export, how to develop export strategies, how to package that, how to start building circuits and networks of venues, festivals, helpful people around us. I think today for the music industry there’s probably two areas of growth: technology and emerging markets. Latin America is doing a good job. In Africa generally they are also working well, key markets being obviously Nigeria, South Africa, Senegal, Uganda. But I think the third region that’s the next growth area is what we call SWANA: Southwest Asia – North Africa. This covers the North African countries from the Maghreb all the way across to the Levant (Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Iraq), the Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Emirates and beyond into Turkey and the Caucasus countries like Armenia, Georgia and the like… By calling it Swana, and not Middle East, North Africa, it allows us to also go beyond Arabic-speaking music alone, to include Kurdish, Berber, Turkic languages, Farsi, Armenian, etc, where there is a shared history, shared culture, food, instruments and somehow the microtonal modal sounds, which we can find even here actually in the Czech Republic. Two bands ago that we were listening to I was sitting next to the Tunisian percussionist, Imed Alibi who was saying to me “Man, this sounds like it comes from our region”, talking about the rhythms by the East European band.\n\n“It has been 20 years of “Arab equals terrorist”, which is wrong obviously. We have always worked to change perceptions internationally through the arts and culture.”\n\nSo obviously if you go into Spain, 700 years of Arab presence, there’s a lot of references that you can also find in Flamenco. We think this mixture of culture is way overdue. We need to know that the time for getting people from this region to the West is now. And thankfully the stigmatization of Arabs seems like it’s diminishing somewhat. It has been 20 years of “Arab equals terrorist”, which is wrong obviously. We have always worked to change perceptions internationally through the arts and culture. So we now look forward to partnering with people who share the same values.\n\nI am very grateful to Nabil for the conversation. Before I say goodbye, I want to share something about one of the artists he mentioned, Rasha Nahas, in a collaboration with Dina Elwedidi:\n\nBEST NEW TALENT AWARD 2023, BY UPBEAT PLATFORM\n\nAs mentioned above, I had the honour to be part of the jury for the Best New Talent Award in the framework of Upbeat Platform, together with Balázs Weyer from Hangvető and Chris Eckman from Glitterbeat.\n\nBetween the three of us we came up with a list of 10 artists who met the criteria to be considered “emerging” and who had performed at one of the events that make up the platform. Click the picture to watch a video with the nominees ➡️.\n\nWhat are these events? You have them here. And what were those criteria? Literally:\n\n“The performer has to fit at least 5 of the following conditions:\n\n● max 3 albums released\n\n● max 5 years passed since the release of their first album\n\n● no more than 20.000 followers on either of their social media channels\n\n● the average age of band members does not exceed 35 years\n\n● had at least one concert in a professional setting\n\n● the band did not go on an international tour of 10 gigs\n\n● the band does not have a contract with a non-national record label\n\n● the band has an up-to-date web presence (website, social media)\n\nThe nominated artists also have to be legal residents in any country participating in the\n\nCreative Europe programme.”\n\nAnd now the voting is open to everyone, here, until 12 September. The vote gives you the chance to win a double pass for the Tallinn Music Week. The chosen band will get the chance to perform at the PIN MUSIC Conference & Showcase & to record a clip with the mighty La Blogothèque in Paris.\n\nTALK AT WOMEX: RESHAPING THE NARRATIVE. GENDER, AUTHORITY AND NEW APPROACHES TO MUSIC JOURNALISM\n\nThis week WOMEX has announced the conference program. It is going to be the first time that I actually participate in this WOMEX activity and I am very happy to do it with two tremendous colleagues: Martyna van Nieuwland and Andrea Voets. Click on their names to read a bio.\n\nSpecific day and time details will be announced at a later date.\n\nAnd another conference I’d like to highlight\n\nI would like to mention another conference in which I am not going to participate but with which I have a certain relationship because it was born within the European Folk Network, of which I am a member of the board. The conference is “Archives: Living Heritage or History? Using archives and assessing their value to a contemporary scene” and it will be chaired by Nod Knowles, the coordinator of the European Folk Network, with Miklós Both (Hungary) from the Hungarian Heritage House, Mariet Calsius (Belgium) from CEMPER – Center for Music and Performing Arts Heritage and Prof. Simon McKerrell (Scotland).\n\nA PERSONAL FAREWELL TO MAD SHEER KHAN\n\nIn 2005 there was no Mapamundi Música. But I was already working on these things and I had the opportunity to bring Mad Sheer Khan to perform in Spain for his first time. Specifically, to Murcia Tres Culturas. He was the first international artist I brought to perform in my country. I knew his work from the album 1001 Nights. You can listen to it here.That concert was in quartet formation, with Celia, his wife and harmonium player from France, a Cuban percussionist and one from Congo. Some time later, with Mapamundi, I worked with him again on several occasions.\n\nMad Sheer Khan has been a very particular artist, with a very special life and professional career. His voice has always been deeply pacifist. On his website you have more information.\n\nThis week I learned of his death at the age of 67. I didn’t expect it, really. In recent years we have not had much contact. His last album was in 2012. I think he’s been sick for a while until this fatal end. Several artists have passed away lately. Everyone is talking about Sinead O’Connor. Her decease is pity, without a doubt. Ceferina Banquez, the queen of bullerengue, has also passed away at the age of 80. Some people talk about her. I’m sorry too. Thanks to all three. It will take you a long time to be forgotten.\n\nBRIEF NEWS FROM THE MEDIA, CHARTS AND SISTER PROJECTS\n\n#1 forTransglobal World Music Chart in July 2023 is: London Ko by Fatoumata Diawara (Fatoumata Diawara)\n\nMundofonías: our three favourites of the month are Sourdurent’s L’herbe de détourne, the compilation Afghan music in exile: Mashhad 2022 [V.A.] and Saîdê Goyî’s Jinê.\n\nOPEN CALLS AND PROFESSIONAL EVENTS\n\nIf you have anything to share in this section in a future edition, let me know.\n\nFestival Au Fil des Voix.

This is the 60th edition of this newsletter and 5 years since I started this initiative. Here is the first edition. At that time Sherezade was with me. I have already explained that the pandemic made me unable to keep her as an employee. I have not recovered her. She found another job and is doing well. Although we are still in regular contact and she collaborates with me on some occasions. I think that all that took away a part of innocence and brought a part of temperance and experience.I know that during these 5 years I have learned a lot. My world is now much bigger and I feel that I perceive deeper and deeper layers of reality. Maybe it happens to everyone as time goes by. I feel that it happens to me thanks to being exposed to so many human realities.\n\nRegarding this topic of layers, lately I have been reflecting on all the content that the musics I work with contain, on the relationship between the aesthetic pleasure they produce and the whole load of history and worldviews that go with them. Approaching these musics confronts you with an unfathomable universe that can give you vertigo… The other day I was at the presentation of the concert season of an important public organization of reference in Spain, dedicated above all to classical music, with some nods to other types (mainly jazz and flamenco). I couldn’t help but think that their world was smaller. The other day at the gym, a classic rock playlist was playing on the background music system and Cream’s Sunshine Of Your Love, a song that I love, was included. I posted about that on my Instagram and tagged the gym. They responded by thanking me for the mention and saying that you had to hear “everything”. Holy cow. That “everything” means current Anglo pop hits, urban Latin music and, rarely, an hits of the rock of some decades ago. The truth is, I don’t know if anything has changed in the past five years regarding all of this. I don’t believe we are better off. Further down, I talk about the European Folk Day. It relates to this reflection.\n\nI also reflect a lot lately on how there are other worlds outside of the one we tend to see in our realm of world music. In fact, taking action to address this situation fueled the creation of the Transglobal World Music Chart (if you’re not familiar with it, visit the website) already in 2015. This is a topic I discussed with Dan Rosenberg recently when we met in Madrid for Silent Tears’ performance. Below you’ll find the conversation with him. I was lucky to spend a couple of moments with him and I made him a little interview just before the concert.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, a contact from another continent was asking on Facebook for professional opinions on showcases. Obviously the issue of the barrier of access to artists without an organization behind them that can cover the costs of travelling to play for free is a very clear problem of showcase festivals. This situation is obvious for artists like the Kurds, many minorities in China, such as the Uighurs or many minorities from republics of the Russian Federation. And, of course, countries without structures such as culture export offices or an industry with an international vision. For instance, what happens in Paraguay regarding music? I wondered about this with my friend Fernando Martínez, the director of the radio show Tráfico de Tarareos, a few days ago.\n\nThis topic of the support to the artists from the showcases festivals briefly came up in the conversation with Peter Dimitrov regarding the new showcase associated with the Bulgarian festival A To Jazz. That edition is here. It also came up in the conversation with Andrea del Favero regarding the new showcase associated with the Italian festival Folkest. That edition is here. By the way, the Folkest is taking place now and the showcase will happens next week, between 30th of June and 2nd of July. I want to send a warm greeting to Piero Cremaschi! I hope it is a great success! Both of these showcases provide financial support to artists. In fact, many of them do. These two are part of Upbeat Platform, which is co-funded by the European Union. Other showcase or mixed festivals, such as Fira-B or the Fira Mediterrània de Manresa, that are not part of this platform, also provide significant support to artists.\n\nThis issue touches me very closely now that I work with Ali Doğan Gönültaş shoulder to shoulder because there isn’t an organization beyond myself that supports him to do something like going to perform in a showcase festival that would not give any support for the expenses. The organizations that coul"
