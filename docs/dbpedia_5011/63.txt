Geneva, 9 July 2001 – The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the association of Europe’s public service broadcasters, announced today that it had admitted Radio Television of Serbia (RTS) and Radio Television of Crna Gora

(RTVCG, Montenegro) with immediate effect.

The announcement followed an EBU General Assembly in Madrid on 6-7 July. The two broadcasters serve what remains of Yugoslavia, except for the UN-administered territory of Kosovo, where the public broadcaster RTK is operated by the EBU. They were accepted for joint membership, as EBU members

must have national coverage.

Before the break-up of Yugoslavia into separate independent states in 1992, RTS and RTVCG were constituent parts of the Yugoslav Radio Television (JRT), a founder member of the EBU in 1950. RTV Bosnia-Herzegovina, RTV Croatia, RTV Macedonia and RTV Slovenia were admitted to the EBU in 1993, but the remaining components of JRT were not admitted – in particular because Serbia/Montenegro was not recognised by the International Telecommunications Union. (The ITU admitted Serbia/Montenegro on 1 June 2001).

The admission of RTS and RTVCG means that the EBU now has 70 full (or ‘active’) members in 51 countries. With the readmission in Madrid of MBC Korea and Radiodiffusion Télévision Sénégalaise, the Union also has 47 associate members in 29 countries further beyond the European Broadcasting Area.

EBU activities include operation of the Eurovision and Euroradio networks; the purchase of sports rights on behalf of members; co-ordination of news and sports programming; technical research; co-productions; and the defence of public service broadcasting.
