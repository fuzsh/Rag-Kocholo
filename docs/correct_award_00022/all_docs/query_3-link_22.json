Fourteen years later another German physicist, Johannes Stark, was awarded the prize for discoveries in the field of atomic science.\n\nThe two Nobel laureates became extremely famous. They also, in due course, became Nazis, raging antisemitic extremists who tried to destroy Albert Einstein and other Jewish scientists and impose their brand of “Aryan physics” on Germany and the world."
