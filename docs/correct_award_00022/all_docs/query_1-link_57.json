        "text": "Born Schichenhof, Bavaria, Germany, 15 April 1874\n\nDied Traunstein, Bavaria, (Germany), 21 June 1957\n\nGerman experimental physicist Johannes Stark is important within astronomy for the Stark effect, the broadening or splitting of atomic emission and absorption lines when the atoms producing them are in an ambient electric field, such as that due to the surrounding ions and electrons in the atmosphere of a star.\n\nStark was born to a landed proprietor and his wife. Stark's early life included an education at the Gymnasium in Bayreuth and later in Regensburg. Upon graduation, he enrolled at Munich University in 1894 to study physics, mathematics, chemistry, and crystallography. Stark completed his doctorate in 1897 with a dissertation on Isaac Newton's electrochronic rings in dim media. Upon completion of his doctorate, he worked as an assistant at the Physics Institute at Munich University, a post Stark held until 1900, when he became an unsalaried lecturer in physics at the University...\n\nRights and permissions\n\nReprints and permissions\n\nCopyright information\n\nÂ© 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.\n\nAbout this entry\n\nCite this entry\n\nDurham, I.T.
