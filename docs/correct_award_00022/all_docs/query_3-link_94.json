        "text": "Johannes Diderik van der Waals (November 23, 1837 â€“ March 8, 1923) was a Dutch scientist and van der Waals force.\n\nA second great discovery of van der Waals was published in 1880: The Law of Corresponding States. This law shows, that after scaling temperature, pressure, and volume by their respective critical values, a general form of the equation of state is obtained which is applicable to all substances. This law served as a guide during the experiments that led to the liquefaction of helium by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes."
