        "text": "1. Born: April 15, 1875 Died: June 21, 1957 Greatest accomplishment: Stark was a prolific writer and published more than 300 scientific papers. Quote: Many scientists will have to contribute to the solution of the great problem; they will have to follow up and measure all those phenomena in which the atomic structure is directly expressed. Johannes Stark\n\n2. Ethnicity : Schickenhof, Bavaria Germany Personal life & family history: His father was a landed proprietor. He was married to Luise Uepler. They had five children. His recreations were forestry and cultivation of fruit trees. Education: He was educated at the Gymnasium (grammar school) in Bayreuth. Later he continued his studies in Regensburg and proceeded to Munich University in 1894 to read physics, mathematics, chemistry and crystallography. Stark graduated in 1897 on the basis of his doctoral dissertation on Newton's electrochronic rings in a certain type of dim media. Positions held: He worked as assistant to von Lommel at the Physics Institute at Munich University from 1897 until 1900 and then became unsalaried university lecturer of physics at the University of Göttingen. In 1906 he was appointed extraordinary professor at the Technische Hochschule in Hannover and in 1909 he followed the invitation of the Technische Hochschule in Aachen to become Professor there.He moved to the Physics Institute of the University of Würzburg, where he stayed until 1922.\n\n3. Contributions:Stark's scientific works cover three large fields: the electric currents in gases, spectroscopic analysis, and chemical valency. Stark was a prolific writer and published more than 300 scientific papers. His book Die Elektrizität in Gasen was published in 1902. This was followed by works on elementary radiation and electrical spectroscopic analysis of chemical atoms. In connection with his work on chemical valency he wrote a book Die Elektrizität im chemischen Atom. Stark founded the Jahrbuch der Radioaktivität und Elektronik and edited this publication from 1904 until 1913. Awards Received: In 1919 Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics for his \"discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields\". He was also awarded the Baumgartner Prize of the Vienna Academy of Sciences in 1910 and the Vahlbruch Prize of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in 1914, and also the Matteucci Medal of the Rome Academy.\n\n4.
