But on the invitation of the editorial staff I would still like to add the following remarks.[2] It is generally known that during National Socialism’s time of struggle [Kampfzeit] the great majority of professors at German universities and colleges failed disgracefully, nationally speaking. They were unsympathetic toward Hitler and his movement; and some even repudiated him. At many universities serious conflicts arose between the National Socialist student body and the faculty linked to the black-red political system.[3] In 1933 Reich Minister Rust [4] justifiably had bitter words in this regard for the professoriate in Berlin.[5] The dominant Jewish influence at German universities was the decisive cause of the political failure of the majority of German professors in the National Socialist struggle for German liberty.[6]"
