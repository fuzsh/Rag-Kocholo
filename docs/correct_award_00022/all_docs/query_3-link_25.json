        "text": "Born: 15-Apr-1874\n\nBirthplace: Schickenhof, Bavaria, Germany\n\nDied: 21-Jun-1957\n\nLocation of death: Traunstein, Germany\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Christian\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Physicist\n\nNationality: Germany\n\nExecutive summary: Discovered the Stark Effect\n\nGerman physicist Johannes Stark studied chemical valency, electric currents in gases, and spectroscopic analysis. In 1905 he reported a Doppler effect in the radiation released by rapidly-moving charged particles, and in 1919 he detailed the splitting of spectral lines in an electric field, a phenomenon now termed the Stark effect. He won the Nobel Prize in the same year, but quit physics in 1922 to start his own porcelain-making business, which soon failed. He subsequently tried to re-enter academia, but a dour personality and his increasing denunciation of \"Jewish physics\" (i.e., Albert Einstein) make him unpopular, as even in the anti-Semitic environment of pre-Nazi Germany it was clear to most leading physicists that Einstein's theories were correct. He was rejected for membership in the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences, but became President of the government-aligned Berlin Institute of Physics and Technology and used this position to further denounce quantum physics and suppress Jews in German science.\n\nWife: Luise Uepler (five children)\n\nHigh School: Regensburg Gymnasium, Regensburg, Germany (1894)\n\nUniversity: PhD, University of Munich (1897)\n\nTeacher: Physics, University of Munich (1897-1900)\n\nLecturer: Physics, University of Göttingen (1900-06)\n\nProfessor: Technische Hochschule, Hannover (1906-09)\n\nProfessor: Technische Hochschule, Aachen (1909-17)\n\nProfessor: University of Greifswald (1917-20)\n\nProfessor: University of Würzburg (1920-22)\n\nFerenc Ferdinánd Baumgarten Prize 1910\n\nMatteucci Medal 1915\n\nNobel Prize for Physics 1919\n\nYearbook of Radioactivity and Electronics Founder & Editor (1904-13)\n\nBerlin Institute of Physics and Technology President (1933-39)\n\nLunar Crater Stark (25.5°S 134.6°E, 49 km. diameter)\n\nGerman Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nDie Elektrizität im Gasen (Electricity in Gases) (1902, non-fiction)\n\nDie Elektrizität im Chemischen Atom (Electricity in the Chemical Atom) (1902, non-fiction)\n\nDie Elementare Strahlung (The Elementary Radiation) (1911, non-fiction)\n\nAnregung der Spektren (Suggestions of the Spectrum) (1927, non-fiction)\n\nNationalsozialismus und Katholische Kirche (Nazism and the Catholic Church) (1931, non-fiction)\n\nFortschritte und Probleme der Atomforschung (Problems and Progress in Nuclear Research) (1931, non-fiction)\n\nNationalsozialismus und Wissenschaft (Nazism and Science) (1934, non-fiction)\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
