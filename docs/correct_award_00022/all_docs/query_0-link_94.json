        "text": "When do you know that your new product is successful? It's the 55th anniversary of the first Moon landing and I've just published a new article about the different types of success - both for landing on the Moon and for using a new kind of AI tool to help you write your Ansible code. watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible Lightspeed’s goal is to “help automation teams learn, create, and maintain Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform content more efficiently.” Helping teams create content more efficiently is slightly less romantic than walking on the Moon, though it is certainly more practical for day-to-day matters! The office of the CIO in IBM supports all of IBM’s internal systems and we’ve been using Ansible Lightspeed ever since it was a not-yet-ready-for-primetime prototype. When did each of these projects — the Apollo 11 Moon landing and Ansible Lightspeed in the IBM CIO office — achieve success? The definition of success depends very much on what one means by “success” and who the audience of success is. For an executive, the success of a proof of concept may be meaningless, until the business value of more efficient development can be unlocked. On the other hand, for the engineer investigating the capabilities of a system, the matter of how to get other people to use it may be of scant interest compared to the technology itself. My articles goes over the different types of successes and when you know you've achieved each of them. #ibm #ansible #ansiblelightspeed #moon #sre #ai #watsonx #redhat #success #apollo11 #apollo #moonlanding #nasa #ibmwatsonx\n\nAfter we've spent a few months kicking the tires with watsonx Code Assistant for Ansible, I'm delighted to be able to talk about our experiences as early adopters of this very useful - and enjoyable - tool! I'll be at #RedHatSummit 2024 in Denver, May 6-9, sharing insights as a speaker at the event. Let's connect, learn, and explore the world of IT & #AIOps together. If you're attending, please join Xavier Lecauchois, Michael Lloyd, and myself at our Wednesday session. If you're not attending - and you're interested in how Ansible Lightspeed can help you make Ansible even more available to your team - feel free to reach out directly. Register today: https://lnkd.in/dekf-MsM #RHSummit Red Hat #AnsibleFest IBM #Ansible #AnsibleLightspeed #watsonx IBM watsonx\n\nToday is the 54th anniversary of the #Apollo11 Moon landing - and I've just published a new article about IBM, #computers, the #MoonLanding, #AI, and something new from #IBM called #watsonx, already in use by NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration. July is an auspicious month! July was the first full month of operations by the CTR Company, the precursor to IBM, which was founded on June 16, 1911. July 1969 was a high water mark for humanity — the first Moon landing by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. As well as a triumph of human effort, ingenuity, and dedication, it was no less a triumph for some of the newest tools in humanity’s ever-growing tool-chest — the computer. IBM's computers played a central and critical part in the success of the first lunar landing. We’ve just launched our watsonx artificial intelligence and data platform. While light-years more advanced than the mainframes of the 1960s, they have a similar goal. Read about it in my article below. #apollo #lunar #softwaredevelopement #technologyinnovation #technologyforgood #aiapplications #aiops #nasa #moonlanding #moonmission #moonlanding2023 #moon"
