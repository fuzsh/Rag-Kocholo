        "text": "Professor Mike Kosterlitz and Professor David Thouless were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 2016 for their work into the discoveries of the properties of matter.\n\nProfessor Kosterlitz (left) was a Research Fellow in high energy physics before becoming Lecturer and then Reader at the University of Birmingham from 1970 to 1982. He is now Professor of Physics at Brown University, Rhode Island, US. During his time at Birmingham, he collaborated with Professor David Thouless on phase transitions driven by topological defects â€“ work which later led to their Nobel Prize."
