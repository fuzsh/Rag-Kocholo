Johannes Stark was a Bavarian-born German physicist awarded the 1919 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering the Stark effect (1913), the splitting of degenerate spectral lines through the application of a powerful electric field, and for his work demonstrating the Doppler effect. The explanation of the Stark effect was an early triumph of quantum theory, although in the 1920s Stark rejected both quantum theory and the theory of relativity.
