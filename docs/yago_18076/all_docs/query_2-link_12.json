        "text": "Listen to the podcast Season on Women in Cannes competition\n\nA history of women in competition at Cannes\n\nThese films compete for the Palme d’or and receive the most attention at the festival. Approximately 21 narrative fiction films are included in the competition. The Cannes Competition did have a history of occasionally programming documentaries in the past, but there has been a strong shift toward narrative filmmaking in the last 20 years. The Grand Prix is awarded to second place. The Jury Prize is an honourable mention prize emphasizing originality. The festival also awards Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, and Best Director. A film can only win one of the awards, except for Best Screenplay or Jury Prize and an acting award.\n\nAn overview of the different sections and sidebars of the Cannes Film Festival\n\nUn certain regard (UCR): The festival selection committee also programs Un certain regard (from a different angle) 20 films highlighting young directors and innovative style. The films are usually narrative fiction, but can include documentaries. The section was introduced in 1978 and a top prize introduced in 1998.\n\nOut of Competition (OC) and special screenings (SPS): Approximately ten to twenty films are invited to each festival. They are usually blockbuster films, auteur films which are not eligible for competition due to premiering elsewhere, or documentaries on high profile issues\n\nCannes Classics (CC): Introduced in 2002, the section primarily screens restored prints of classic films. It also screens approximately five to ten documentaries on cinema history, often focused on careers of auteurs.\n\nInternational Critics’ Week (ICW): The section was introduced in 1962 and features seven films which are the director’s either first or second feature. It is programmed by a selection committee from the French Syndicate of Cinema Critics. The International Critics’ Week has had a stronger history of programming women directors since its inception than the official selection. This may, in part, be due to its focus on early career films, and many women filmmakers are not afforded the opportunity to have a long career in filmmaking (especially fiction filmmaking).\n\nDirectors’ Fortnight (DF): Introduced in 1969, this section is programmed by its own team. The section aims to showcase a wide range of film styles. It features approximately 20 films. The Directors’ Fortnight has had a stronger history of programming women directors since its inception than the official selection.\n\nAssociation for the Distribution of Independent Cinema section (ACID): Introduced in 1992, this section focuses on approximately eight films by young directors which do not already have French distribution. It is programmed by a panel of fifteen directors who are members of ACID.\n\nPerspectives du cinéma français & Cinémas en France (PCF/CF): A section which ran from 1973 to 1998, focusing on primarily young French language directors.\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 2020s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 2010s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 2000s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 1990s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 1980s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 1970s\n\nA history of women directors at Cannes sidebars in the 1960s\n\n* = documentary film\n\nFurther reading"
