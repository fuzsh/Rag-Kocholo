        "text": "43rd NATIONAL COMPETITION AWARDS\n\nThe jury of the 43rd Drama Greek Short Film Festival, consisting of\n\nPresident:\n\nArgiris Papadimitropoulos\n\nMembers:\n\nGiannis Stankoglou\n\nAlexia Theodoraki\n\nEvi Kalogiropoulou\n\nRomanna Lobach\n\nMaking movies is a difficult business. Making movies in Greece, even more so. All of you not only managed to do this, but you also did it well. The films we watched during this festival were personal, daring, and truly spectacular. For this, we thank you.\n\nDuring the final meeting, the jury decided to present the following awards\n\nGOLDEN DIONYSOS\n\nThe Golden Dionysos Award is awarded to the film “Bella”, directed by Thelyia Petraki.\n\nThe award is accompanied by three prizes:\n\nFinos Film Productions offers a cash prize of 4,000 Euro\n\nThe Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) offers a cash prize of 3,000 Euro\n\nThe Greek Film Centre (GFC) offers a cash prize of 2,000 Euro\n\nSPECIAL AWARD BY THE SELECTION JURY\n\nThis award is presented to the film “Vouta”, by Dimitris Zahos.\n\nBecause it is a film that moved us profoundly from start to finish. Personally, the ending moved me to such an extent, that I still think of it on every hour of the day.\n\nBEST DIRECTION “TONIA MARKETAKI” AWARD\n\nThis award is presented to the film “Harmonica Man”, by Alexandros Skouras,\n\nfor managing to extract stellar performances, not only from its main, but from all peripheral actors, too, in order to create a finely-tuned film which stole our hearts.\n\nThe award is accompanied by\n\nA cash prize of 3,500 Euro, offered by the Greek Film Centre (awarded to the director),\n\nAnd Post-Production provisions by Stefilm\n\nDocumentary Award\n\nThis award is presented to the film “Teo, My Neighbour”, by Christos Karteris.\n\nWe were somewhat concerned with the absence of more films of a purely documentary nature; still, a film with a strong outlook, a lively rhythm, a sense of humour and a sensitivity in observing its hero, managed to stand out.\n\nThe award is accompanied by\n\nA cash prize of 3,500 Euro, offered by the Greek Film Centre\n\nAnd a cash prize of 1,000 Euro, offered by the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT)\n\nDrama Queer\n\nThis award is presented to the film “Madonna F64.0”, by Stavros Markoulakis.\n\nThis year, the selection panel asks the Festival to establish an award which, up until now, is resoundingly absent from the competition. An award which will be awarded every year, until there are no more people who are denied the chance to live a normal life and suffer because of their diversity.\n\nAll people have a right to equal chances, a right to love, to happiness, and to life itself.\n\nThis year, we will be giving out an award to a film that takes a stand in favour of diversity.\n\nCinema can be far richer when it includes all of us, male, female, or other.\n\nBest Script Award\n\nThis award is presented to Giorgos Teltzidis, for the script of the film “Vouta” by Dimitris Zahos,\n\nfor sharp dialogue and faithfulness in all the factors chosen to realise the narration.\n\nThe award is accompanied by\n\nA cash prize of 3,500 Euro, offered by the Greek Film Centre\n\nHonorary Distinction for Best Female Actor\n\nAwarded to Elena Topalidou, for her performance in the film “Bella”, by Thelyia Petraki,\n\nfor her non-pretentious and unrivalled rendition of the voice-over, her movement plasticity and her compelling gaze.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Best Male Actor\n\nAwarded to Pavlos Iordanopoulos, for his performance in the film “The Meaning of August”, by Manos Papadakis, for his frugal, moving and simultaneously reserved and personal performance.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Photography\n\nAwarded to Manu Tilinski, for his photography in the film “Bella”, by Thelyia Petraki,\n\nfor cinematographic particularity, for the harmonious combination of live shooting and archive materials, and for the use of a unique colour palette.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Film Editing\n\nAwarded to Smaro Papaevangelou, for her editing work in the film “Escaping the Fragile Planet”, by Thanasis Tsimpinis,\n\nfor her meticulous organisation of each cut and her respect towards the actors’ each and every breath.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Stage Design\n\nAwarded to Danai Elefsinioti, for the film “Vouta”, by Dimitris Zahos,\n\nfor the exceptional rendition of places, the credibility of representation and the natural and precise description of the places of action.\n\nHonorary Distinction ‘Ioulia Stavridou’ for Costume Design\n\nAwarded to Vassilia Rozana, for her work in the film “Bella” by Thelyia Petraki,\n\nfor the meticulous costume design which ensured consistency with the film’s particular aesthetic.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a cash prize of 2,000 Euro, offered by the Trianon Cinema,\n\nAnd a sponsorship for the costume designer by the company Enjoy.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Original Score\n\nAwarded to Yannis Veslemes, for the music in the film “Melatonin” by Nikos Pastras,\n\nfor the composition of the original music which provided a very special in situ project with an intense pulse.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Sound Design\n\nAwarded to Kostis Charamountanis, for his film “Anthology of a Butterfly”, also directed by him,\n\nfor the creative collation and use of sound in a way that renders it an indispensable part of the composition.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Sound\n\nAwarded to Simos Lazaridis, for the film “The Meaning of August” by Manos Papadakis, for his important contribution in the narration of the film.\n\nHonorary Distinction for Makeup\n\nAwarded to Ioanna Lygizou, for her work in the film “Bella” by Thelyia Petraki,\n\nfor her detail-oriented and discreet contribution in the representation of the era.\n\nHonourable Mention\n\nAn honourable mention is given to the creative team of the film “Dakar” by Stelios Moraitidis, for the film’s frugal approach, poetic dimension and comprehensive development of a story doomed to be lost.\n\nHonourable Mention\n\nAn honourable mention is given to the film “The Call” by Marios Psaras,\n\nFor its targeted use of cinematography as a means for servicing the film’s sensitive subject\n\nmatter.\n\nHonourable Mention\n\nAn honourable mention is given to the film “Pashka” by Oltjon Lipe,\n\nfor its subversive outlook on the topic of a young hero’s homecoming, as well as for its concept’s resounding impact.\n\nInternational Competition Awards 2020\n\nThe jury of the International Competition Section of the 43rd Drama Short Film Festival, consisting of\n\nPawel Pawlikowski\n\nThemis Bazaca\n\nLefteris Charitos\n\nLena Divani\n\nStergios Paschos\n\nGood evening. We’re all products of our era. Both the people, and our works.\n\nAnd this wildly improbable era, gathered, from the four corners of the world, wildly bizarre fruit which we relished on the silver screen. They were many, they were diverse, they were tantalising, and they fed endless discussions each evening. Here, we ought to thank the Artistic Director and his collaborators, the people whose difficult task it was to select these 35 out of 2,000 films from around the world.\n\nAt the end of the screenings, through this colourful explosion, two distinct trends and an absence could clearly be seen:\n\n– Loneliness; unbearable, impossible to humanly handle loneliness; which leads us to the next trend.\n\n– Escape. More and more new creators escape reality through their work. They create a world that’s utterly their own, in which they set the rules themselves. They’re no longer powerless.\n\nFinally, we find the complete lack of political films, concerning. In an era that is in desperate need of political thought, we felt that new creators conceive politics as a fixed game that they have no part in.\n\nSo, in turn, they give it no part. Is that the solution, though? Or does it reflect the uncertainty of an era that’s dying, while a new one hasn’t yet been born.\n\nWith all this in mind, we tried to select films that attempted to explore the boundaries of filmmaking, while at the same time holding up the human dimension of cinema. As you will see, we embraced the films that, while dealing with existential darkness, left a ray of light in through the cracks. These cracks are sometimes the films themselves.\n\nDuring the final meeting, the jury decided to present the following awards\n\nGrand Prix 2020\n\nAwarded to the film “And she hisses” directed by Monica Lek – Spain/USA.\n\nA film that the jury members unanimously agreed was deserving of the main award. A film that grows inside you, that stretches the boundaries of the medium, that dares to touch the limits, that provokes traditional cinematic narratives and comes out a winner, that fascinates with its subject matter, as well as the protagonists’ interpretations.\n\nThe award is accompanied by 4,000 euros, offered by Raycap.\n\nBest Director\n\nAwarded to the film “Chen Chen” directed by Kargo Chen – Hong Kong.\n\nA modest, simple, honest, touching film, almost healing, one that our soul desperately needed.\n\nBest Southeastern European Film Award\n\nAwarded to the film “As if underwater / Όπως θα συνέβαιναν μέσα στο νερό” directed by Anthi Daoutaki from Greece.\n\nFor its bold and imaginative direction, for the whole world created in a solitary room, and because, although it deals with a very bleak subject, it put a smile on our faces.\n\nBest Animation Film\n\nAwarded to the film “Portrait of Suzanne” by Izabela Plucinska – Poland/Germany/France.\n\nBecause we adored the film of the award-winning director in Drama, which sculpted-literally and metaphorically- the most tragicomedic, surreal, delightful character in the competition.\n\nBest Production Awards “TV5 MONDE”\n\nAwarded to the film “Anna” directed by Dekel Berenson – UK/Ukraine/Israel.\n\nA high quality production, moderate and efficient on every level. From the extras, to the selection of settings.\n\nSpecial award Environment & Climate change\n\nAwarded to the film “The End of Suffering (a proposal)” directed by Jacqueline Lentzou from Greece.\n\nA film that manages, among other things, to give the clearest and most substantial message on climate change. The universe converses with its desperate heroine, and tells her how people made their own cages and turned Earth into a hostile planet.\n\nThe award is accompanied by 4,000 euros, offered by the non-profit organization Cylops\n\n#ThisisEU- European Values\n\nAwarded to the film “Virago” directed by Kerli Kirch Schneider – Estonia.\n\nA film that views history through a comedic prism, a privilege of European thinking, and highlights Eastern-European trauma. In this instance, the heavy burden that fell on women’s shoulders in a disintegrating post-communist society.\n\nNomination EFA Drama 2020\n\nDirected to the film “Favourites” by Martin Monk – Austria/Germany\n\nfor its simplicity, solid construction and its great actors.\n\nSpecial Mention Male Part\n\nAwarded to Kostis Koroneos for his performance in the film “Premier Amour” by Haris Raftogiannis – Greece/France.\n\nfor managing to humanise a completely marginal hero.\n\nSpecial Mention Female Part\n\nAwarded to Stella Vogiatzaki for her performance in the film “As if underwater” by Anthi Daoutaki – Greece.\n\nfor embodying the melancholia of a lonely heroine, gracefully displaying every aspect of her complex psyche.\n\nFIPRESCI Award\n\nThe jury of FIPRESCI consisting of:\n\nΗelene Robert from France\n\nMarla Jacarilla from Spain\n\nDespina Triantafillidou from Greece\n\npresent the FIPRESCI Award to the film “The End of Suffering (a proposal)” by Jacqueline Lentzou from Greece.\n\nThe members of the Fipresci jury have decided to give the International Award to “The End of Suffering” by Jacqueline Lentzou. We appreciate the originality, depth, and simplicity of the project, the aesthetic of the images, and her ability to develop a dreamlike low fi science fiction movie. Furthermore, there is a nice attempt to explain non-duality spiritual concepts.\n\nGreek Society of Film Critics\n\n«Goads», Iris Baglanea.\n\nHellenic Parliament TV Channel Award\n\n“Human Values”\n\nThe television channel of the Parliament bestows the “Human Values” Award to a film of the international program of the festival, which narrates with minimalism and boldness the effort of a woman to approach her underage son, a rural prison inmate, after many years of her being absent.\n\nThe award is bestowed to the film “In her steps” by Anastasia Kratidi from Greece.\n\nInternational Student Awards 2020\n\nThe jury of the International Student Competition of the 43rd Drama International Short Film Festival, consisting of:\n\nLida Vartzioti & Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nAlexandros Diakosavvas\n\nAlki Politi\n\nDuring the final meeting, the jury decided to present the following awards:\n\nGRAND PRIX STUDENT\n\n“ALMOST FAMOUS”\n\nTo the film “The best orchestra in the world” by Henning Backhaus from Austria.\n\nFor the compelling and humour-laden depiction of the need for diversity representation in art, institutions, and society, the modern viewpoint and the hope that we’ll all soon be identifying as “socks”.\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\n“RISING STAR”\n\nTo the film “A mess at Apartment 14″ by Radu Barbu freom Romania\n\nFor the realism in the depiction of everyday life, the balance between boldness, simplicity, and underlying irony, the unpretentious acting, and rounded sketching of multifaceted characters.\n\nHONORARY DISTINCTION\n\nTo the film “22:47 LINIE 34” by Michael Karrer from Switzerland\n\nFor the clear eye and mindful approach of a burning social issue, the entirely current dialogue, the artful rhythm and its deeply existential quality.\n\nSPECIAL AWARD FOR THE BEST NEWCOMER DIRECTOR\n\n“DINOS KATSOURIDIS”\n\nTo the film “Rosa Kairo” by Jacques Simha\n\nTo the film “Violetta” by Fivos Imellos\n\nTo the film “The jar” by Kyriakos Rontsis\n\nAUDIENCE AWARDS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPETITION\n\nTo the film The Jar by Kyriakos Rontsis.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION\n\nTo the film As if underwater by Anthi Daoutaki.\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITION"
