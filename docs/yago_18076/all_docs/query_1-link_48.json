        "text": "A funny thing happened in the rehearsal room of “Mr. Saturday Night” a few weeks ago. Billy Crystal was performing a scene from this new Broadway musical in which his lead character, an aging, out-of-touch comedian named Buddy Young Jr., has learned that he was mistakenly included in an in memoriam segment on the Emmy Awards.\n\nInvited to appear on the “Today” Show to correct the error, Buddy sees an opportunity to reclaim the spotlight he once commanded. With that motivation, Crystal turned to his co-star David Paymer, who plays Buddy’s endlessly loyal brother, Stan, and he began to sing a song about his deep yearning for a crowd’s attention:\n\nWhat I was, way back then\n\nI could have that back again\n\nI could be — still could be\n\nThat guy\n\nIt’s an essentially comedic song, delivered in the warm, warbling voice we heard Crystal employ each year when he was a ubiquitous comedy star and a reliably genial Academy Awards host."
