Check back here next year for our 2024 events!\n\nLast summer, the Office of Council Member Hudson launched our inaugural Summer Youth Series for young people across District 35. With the closure of the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club Navy Yard Club House, we teamed up with organizations and institutions across the District to host diverse youth programming every Friday throughout the summer.

The story is told through previously unearthed archival footage and never-before-seen interviews with legendary players like Satchel Paige and Buck O’Neil – whose early careers paved the way for the Jackie Robinson era – as well as celebrated Hall of Famers Willie Mays and Hank Aaron who started out in the Negro Leagues. From entrepreneurial titans Cumberland Posey and Gus Greenlee, whose intense rivalry fueled the rise of two of the best baseball teams ever to play the game, to Effa Manley, the activist owner of the Newark Eagles and the only woman ever admitted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, The League explores Black baseball as an economic and social pillar of Black communities and a stage for some of the greatest athletes to ever play the game, while also examining the unintended consequences of integration.
