        "text": "The Invisible Gorilla. You might be wondering why out of nowhere I am writing a post with such a weird title… Well it is the name of a short film. In this film, two teams pass a basketball. One team wears white shirts and the other wears black. Viewers are told to count the number of passes made by the white team and ignore the black team. Sounds simple, right? But here's the surprising part. Halfway through the film, a woman in a gorilla suit walks across the court, thumps her chest, and then leaves. She’s on screen for 9 seconds. Can you guess what’s astonishing about this film? Almost half of the viewers don’t notice the gorilla at all. They are so focused on counting the passes that they miss it entirely. They don’t realize the gorilla was there until they are told about it. This tells us something important about ourselves: Sometimes we are blind to the obvious. We are also blind to our own blindness. In our lives, we often repeat this mistake. We get so busy counting our problems that we miss the opportunities right in front of us. Take a moment today to look around. What are you missing while you’re focused on something else? P.S. Have you heard of this movie before? #Leadership #Opportunities #Focus #Mindset #MondayMotivation\n\n\"Late Night with the Devil\" intriguingly captures a live late-night TV horror that unfolds in real-time, an hour after midnight, binding viewers to the clock as supernatural chaos seeps into a 1977 broadcast. Directed by the Cairnes brothers, the film cleverly toggles between the live broadcast and behind-the-scenes intermissions, revealing the ambitions and secret motives of the show's host, Jack Delroy, and his guests. This narrative structure not only enriches character development but also amplifies the tension, especially during a Halloween special themed around paranormal events. Despite its gripping premise and the authentic recreation of the 1970s setting—from the meticulously designed set and costumes to the period-specific dialogue—the film's tight 90-minute runtime does it a disservice. Just as the suspense reaches its peak, the story rushes towards a conclusion, undermining the carefully constructed atmosphere and leaving several plot threads feeling unresolved. Another 30 minutes could have provided a more satisfying resolution and allowed the suspense to culminate more naturally. The performances are a standout feature, with the cast delivering convincingly tense and engaging portrayals that anchor the film's ambitious concept. \"Late Night with the Devil\" eschews conventional horror tropes, opting instead for a suspense-driven narrative that skillfully keeps viewers on edge without resorting to jump scares. This approach pays off, making the film a compelling watch for those who prefer psychological thrills over straightforward horror. #cinema #movies #movienight #horror #tv\n\nI normally don’t do this but I had to write a film review. I know what you’re wondering, “LinkedIn is not for reviews”, it’s for “learning and building workplace connections” But would you believe me if I said this is exactly that. Me, sharing content that I believe we all can learn from, and in the process build connections? Now you might be also wondering, what film is worthy of a review on LinkedIn by an amateur. Well, a kind of film that is simple yet complex in its emotions and has a deafening silence that leaves you speechless. ‘If anything happens, I still love you’ is a 2020 Oscar winning short animated film by Will McCormack and Michael Govier that discusses grief, loss, acceptance, coping, and hope. Yes you heard that right! All of the above emotions beautifully conveyed in less than 13 minutes, and you know what’s even more interesting? there’s barely a single sentence spoken in the entire film. The directors of the film have managed to tell an extremely powerful story about the implications of Gun Violence and what overcoming tragedies can look like. A young and passionate life being cut short, parents struggling to cope with the loss of their beloved child, and how one still manages to find hope and live life remembering their loved ones forms the basic crux of the film. If you have a little extra time today and don’t mind watching something a little different, then please do watch this film on Netflix. It’ll convey a thousand things without saying a single word and in that process, make you human all over again :) #films #review #oscar #gunviolence #animated #powerful\n\nHow Yorgos Lanthimos' Films Make Us Squirm, Yet Keep Us Watching In the past decade, only 5 directors have had multiple films with a 90%+ Rotten Tomatoes score. One of those directors is Yorgos Lanthimos. His films like \"The Lobster,\" \"The Killing of a Sacred Deer,\" and most recently, \"Poor Things,\" are profoundly discomfiting. With stilted dialogue, bizarre premises, and matter-of-fact violence, Lanthimos purposefully crafts viewer discomfort. Yet I can't look away. These films confront me with the uneasy sides of human nature, relationships, and morality. As film critic Richard Brody wrote, Lanthimos \"forces the audience to look unflinchingly at what it would rather ignore.\" The discomfort lingers long after the credits roll. It prods introspection, challenging me to examine my own live and choice. As Lanthimos said, \"I prefer audiences to go through an experience that disturbs them, and that they need to think about after they've seen the film.\" In the end, Lanthimos reminds me that stepping outside my comfort zone can reveal deeper emotional truths. As he pushes past the threshold of discomfort, i squirm - but i am rewarded with insight. So next time a Lanthimos film has you shifting in your seat, remember: the most memorable journeys often start from a place of unease. Allow the discomfort to open your eyes. Have you watched \"Poor Things\" or other films by Lanthimos? #PersonalGrowth #EmbraceChange #LeadershipDevelopment #UnlockYourPotential #mentalhealth #wellnessjourney #emotionalwellbeing #healingjourney #hypnotherapy\n\nRebel Moon: Part Two didn’t quite reach Part One numbers. Image: Netflix After a fourth-month wait, Netflix viewers turned up by the tens of millions to see how Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon saga finished, but the number didn’t quite hit that of the first film. Zack Snyder Digs Into His “Rebel Moon vs Barbie” Ratings Discourse Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver was Netflix’s number-one English-language film last week with a reported 21.4 million views, hitting the top 10 in 92 countries. It even brought some viewers back to the first part as Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire also had 5.5 million viewers during the week. However, the new film did not reach the viewership of the first one’s December debut, which had 23.9 million views. So, what does that tell us? Was everyone too busy listening to Taylor Swift? It’s possible. But the most obvious and likely scenario is after the largely negative reviews for the first, as well as the second, film, there just wasn’t as much desire and excitement for people to rush to their TVs and stream it. Now, to be fair, it’s still only 2.5 million viewers fewer. That’s not bad at all for the exact same reasons. Another way to look at it is of the 23.9 million people who watched Rebel Moon – Part One on its first weekend, all but 2.5 million came back to see Part Two. Roughly, of course. The question from there becomes, is 21.4 million a big enough number for Snyder to keep returning to his universe? The Scargiver does not finish the story of its main characters, not by a long shot, and Snyder has said he has more story he’d like to tell. We’ll have to see in the coming weeks what Netflix decides to do. Want more io9 news?

The Evil Fairy Queen follows a family that moved from a suburban town to a large, seemingly normal house in a rural area. However, this house and the family’s experiences there are anything but normal. Something seems off from the day they arrive, when a neighbor creepily warns them of the house’s dangers. The younger daughter, Violet (#KittySudbery), discovers the fairy queen but doesn’t realize the dangers of keeping it a secret. Eventually, the rest of the family figures out what’s going on, but not until it’s too late and the entire family is in grave danger. This film has strong, relatable characters that pulled me in and allowed me to connect with the storyline. The older daughter, Adelaide (#AnielaLeyland), is a typical teenager while the younger daughter is still an innocent, sweet, explorative little girl. This contrast is typical for siblings, no matter what the age difference or similarity in interests. The dynamics between the family members make the film relevant and also demonstrates the character motives in the more suspenseful parts. Because this film includes many fantastical aspects, it’s important that viewers can relate to the characters, even if their situation is a bit unrealistic. With all that said, the story has some issues - there are some unclear parts of the fantasy world and a lot of things are never explained. That makes some sections of the film slightly confusing and diminishes its overall suspense. However, the concept of the fantasy world is interesting and it’s a wonderful idea.
