A cycle of cork extraction in a village in central Portugal. A father and a daughter in a technological clash. A friend, a vegetable garden. The portrait of a hanging community.\n\nNÔS DANÇA\n\nby Rui Lopes da Silva\n\n21 OUT / 18H00 / Cinema São Jorge\n\n22 OUT / 22H00 / Cinema São Jorge\n\nCape Verde has a mixture of cultures that transformed and recreated the original elements with others brought from different latitudes. Nôs Dança is a journey in search of the dances spread throughout the archipelago, from traditional rhythms to contemporary styles\n\nHER BODY\n\nby Ana Moreira\n\n(in development)\n\n+\n\nAna is a dancer. She lives with her parents and her brother in Póvoa de Varzim. A glimpse of her day-to-day and how it merges with her artistic practice, which expresses itself on and off stage, when her body is simultaneously a being, an instrument and a medium.\n\nTRUTH OR DARE? by Sofia Marques in Serralves\n\n\"Truth or Dare?\" (original title: Verdade ou Consequência?), directed by Sofia Marques and featuring Luis Miguel Cintra, will have its first exhibition in the Serralves Foundation, on the 12th of September, at 22:00. The official world premiere will be in Doclisboa International Film Festival, on the 22th of October, at 16H45!\n\nTheatre is life, as movement is life. In \"Truth or Dare?\", Sofia Marques sets off in search of her friend and actor Luis Miguel Cintra; and Cintra is in search of himself, both excavating the matter and memory of theatre, the matter and memory of life. At home surrounded by statuary and by his Porto, by the sea and in Spain where he was born, on a stage of light and shadow, in the films of Manoel de Oliveira or in the poems of Ruy Belo.\n\nCARMEN TROUBLES by Vasco Araújo World Premiere @IndieLisboa 2023\n\nposter by Sara Vicente\n\n4.05.2023 - 19h00\n\n6.05.2023 - 16h30\n\nCinema S.
