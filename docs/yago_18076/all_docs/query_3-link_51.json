        "text": "Includes image: &#39;the night responds to my complaints&#39;, 1932. Abstract Maria Plyta’s films are almost completely forgotten today despite the continuing popularity they enjoy when screened on television. There is something parochial and paradoxical in them that ignites more bewilderment and confusion than acceptance or enthusiasm. It is interesting to note that after so many decades of intense feminist film criticism there is only one significant study of her work by Eliza-Anna Delveroudi which deals with her contribution as the first female director. Consequently, we do not possess a digital remastering of none of her films, which circulate in bad and incomplete versions.\n\nRepresentations of women, or more exactly of gender, and the presence and works of women filmmakers constitute an important area of analysis for gender studies and feminist film theories. In Turkey the presence and the participation of women in the public sphere have been one of the important objectives of the Kemalist modernization project since the founding of the modern nation-state in 1923. However, despite the modernizing efforts to empower women in different spheres of life there was no woman director in Turkish commercial feature cinema until the beginning of the 1950s. Since the beginning of the 2000s the number of women directors has increased significantly, reaching a number well above that of the entire period before. This article investigates the reasons behind this increase based on quantitative data gathered from secondary sources and in-depth interviews with women producers and directors. It also questions whether and to what extent the increase in the number of women film directors contributed to the production of 'women's films', based on a qualitative analysis of films produced by women directors between the years 2004 and 2013. The results show that in addition to technological and aesthetic changes in the industry, the increase in the availability of international and national public funding for low-budget independent film productions and the enlargement of the women's movement allowed more women directors to enter the film industry. While half of the films made by women directors in the 2000s could be qualified as 'women films', the other half remained, largely due to market forces, within the conventions of popular or art house cinema.\n\nThis study focuses on how female characters are represented in the films of contemporary female directors in Turkey. In this study, the films of female directors Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Ahu Öztürk, and Emine Emel Balcı are examined in the context of women’s cinema and feminist film reading. In this study, the films Tereddüt (“Clair-Obscur,” 2016), Gözetleme Kulesi (“Watchtower,” 2012), Toz Bezi (“Dust Cloth,” 2015), and Nefesim Kesilene Kadar (“Until I Lose My Breath,” 2015) are discussed using sociological film analysis. Unlike mainstream films, the female characters in the narratives of these films do not succeed even when they engage in a struggle for liberation. The female characters are imprisoned in the masculine ideology and find their salvation in relation to being with a man.\n\nFilm or cinema is known as a powerful medium of communication across the world. As a result, the discussion of gender issues related to men and women in films has come up in various studies. The construction of women in the language of men in a patriarchal society results in women being seen in commercial films as neglected, omnipotent, male-dominated entities; Commodification of women is also noticeable in most cases. Because of this, it is not easy to find stories that glorify women and embody their power on the film screen. Several women filmmakers are working in the film world of Bangladesh. Therefore, it is important to see how the representation of women, women&#39;s aspirations, personal freedom, economic freedom and contribution are being highlighted in the films of domestic women producers. To find the self-identity of female characters, it is necessary to research the female gaze in films by women filmmakers. In this study the film Under Construction directed by Rubaiyat H..."
