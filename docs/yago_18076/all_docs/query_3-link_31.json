        "text": "46th Drama International Short Film Festival Awards\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITION PROGRAMME AWARDS 2023\n\nJURY\n\nLefteris Charitos (President), director, Alexia Roider, artistic director of the Cyprus Short Film Festival, Menos Deliotzakis, director, Alexandra Matthaiou, director/screenwriter, and Asimina Proedrou, director/screenwriter.\n\nGOLDEN DIONYSUS – BEST FILM AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Bearcave’, directed by Krysianna Papadakis and Stergios Dinopoulos\n\nAn independent film that stole our hearts by managing to touch upon important issues while remaining penetrating, authentic, and brave. Breaking away from the stereotypical documentations of rural Greece in a way we rarely see in Greek cinema, the film’s creators placed a big bet and won. A film full of daring stylistic contradictions, natural performances, and character complexity, whose two heroines keep us on our toes, despite the film’s long duration. Up until the credits roll, emotion is prevalent, through the reminder that cinema has always needed and will always need real and deeply human stories.\n\nThe award is accompanied by the following prizes: Finos Film offers a prize of 4,000 euro, the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT) offers a prize of 3,000 euro, and the Greek Film Centre offers a prize of 2,500 euro.\n\nSILVER DIONYSUS – “TONIA MARKETAKI” BEST DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto Alexis Koukias-Pantelis, for the film ‘Aerolin’\n\nFor his exceptional guidance of the main actress, the tight rhythm and all other elements which effortlessly compose this film, we singled out a film which conveyed successfully and humorously the heroine’s struggle to survive in a modern urban environment, presenting on the big screen a character who ultimately represents a whole generation.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 3,500 euro offered by the Greek Film Centre, as well as by Post Production services worth 2,500 euro offered by Stefilm, original music composition for the creator’s next project offered by the company Musou, a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year free Premium Member subscription on Crew United’s platform.\n\nDOCUMENTARY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Light of Light’, directed by Neritan Zinxhiria\n\nBy composing a deeply sacramental world through the use of archive material and daring cinematic choices, the director converses with the past, the present and the future, and expands time. We selected a deeply poetic and existential film for this award.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 3,500-euro prize offered by the Greek Film Centre and a 1,000-euro prize offered by the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation (ERT).\n\nBEST SCRIPT AWARD\n\nto Michalis Mathoudiakis and Alexis Koukias-Pantelis for the film ‘Aerolin’, directed by Alexis Koukias-Pantelis\n\nA script which handles the short film form masterfully and economically, while remaining consistent to the tone and dramatic development of its heroine.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 3,500 euro, offered by the Greek Film Centre.\n\nDRAMA QUEER AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Buffer Zone’, directed by Savvas Stavrou\n\nThe film reminded us that, beyond any man-made or other border, love will always prevail as the ultimate affirmation of life and hope.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a cash prize of 2,000 euro, offered by Onassis Culture.\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘The first setting sun of summer’, directed by Asteris Tziolas\n\nBEST MALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto Andreas Markou, for his performance in the film ‘Buffer Zone’, directed by Savvas Stavrou\n\nWe decided to present this award to a young actor who managed to convey the hero’s struggle in a sensitive, natural, and innocent way, in stark contrast to the toxic masculinity environment which surrounds him.\n\nBEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nto Chara Kyriazi, for her performance in the film ‘Bearcave’, directed by Stergios Dinopoulos\n\nTo the actress that moved us with a refreshingly authentic and realistic performance. Through a personal and austere performance, the actress makes us privy to the emotional state of a heroine who, even when remaining silent, manages to tell us everything.\n\nBEST SOUND DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Panagiotis Papagiannopoulos and Stelios Koupetoris for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nFor the atmospheric building of an idiosyncratic dystopia which follows the viewer around throughout the duration of the film.\n\nBEST SOUND AWARD\n\nto Nikos Konstantinou for the film ‘Unorthodox’, directed by Konstantinos Antonopoulos\n\nFor its integral sound engineering in a highly demanding natural environment.\n\nSound design services and 5.1 surround mixing by Costas Chrysogelos & DIAL\n\nBEST EDITING AWARD\n\nto Marios Kleftakis, for the film ‘Arizones’, directed by Giorgos Iliopoulos\n\nFor its skilled, thorough, delicate and precise editing, which, through its paced rhythm manages to immerse the viewer into the hero’s subjective world.\n\nBEST PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD\n\nto Manu Tilinski for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nHigh quality photography, both aesthetically and technically intact, which showcases the director’s particular aesthetic in every frame, and takes the viewer on a journey through a world which tiptoes between the realistic, the metaphysical, the dreamlike, and the subconscious.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year Premium Member membership on Crew United’s platform.\n\nORIGINAL MUSIC AWARD\n\nto Petros Sotiropoulos & The Aqua Barons for the film ‘Crossing’, directed by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor its distinct identity which plays a decisive part in the film’s universe.\n\n“IOULIA STAVRIDOU” COSTUME AWARD\n\nto Rectifier + Tzo for the film ‘Good Girls Club: A Virginity Odyssey’, directed by Lida Vartzioti and Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nFor imaginatively combining the element of kitsch with the freshness of pop aesthetic, through a variety of outfit choices.\n\nSET DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Artemis Flessa for the film ‘Crossing’, directed by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor the excellent construction of a set which defines the film’s world in full and organic connection with the natural environment.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a Crew United Pass, and a 5-year free Premium Member membership on Crew United’s platform.\n\nSPECIAL EFFECTS AWARD\n\nto Kameleon Studio (Prosthetics) Morgan Hildebrand / Aurelia Monnier, for the film ‘Midnight Skin’, directed by Manolis Mavris\n\nFor the impressively masterful design of the film’s special effects, which are incorporated naturally in the transcendental universe of the film.\n\nMAKE-UP AND HAIR STYLING AWARD\n\nto Elina Trantou, for the film ‘Good Girls Club: A Virginity Odyssey’, directed by Lida Vartzioti and Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nFor the consistency which is used to serve the overall aesthetic of the film.\n\nJURY REASONING\n\nAnother festival reaches its end; a week full of films, with both new and seasoned filmmakers gathering in the welcoming city of Drama, and, most of all, with cinemas full to capacity for every screening.\n\nAt the same time that Yorgos Lanthimos is honoured with the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival and Drama celebrates the short film form, our country is drowning from end to end and sees people use senseless and shocking violence against their fellow man. When we consider all these happenings, we cannot be celebrating anything.\n\nHowever, Art exists to bring us face to face with darkness and to ultimately lead us towards the light. And this is what the 35 films competing in the National Competition Programme did, in the midst of all this devastation.\n\nThe Jury of the National Competition Programme of the 46th Drama International Short Film Festival considers it its obligation to highlight certain positive elements, as well as certain problematic aspects.\n\nLet us start with the positives.\n\nWe were happy to note a plethora of subjects being addressed this year: Human relationships, childhood, the multiple forms of violence, the coming-of-age process, life in rural Greece, and many others. We watched noteworthy first filmmaking attempts by new artists, as well as works by seasoned creators of the Festival. This goes to show that short film can function as a standalone category and is not necessarily, as it was previously thought, a mere first step towards feature film.\n\nFurthermore, we saw many remarkable independent productions. This demonstrates the persistence of creators who will not wait for State aid in order to make their films. Despite the fact that the Greek Film Centre and the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation consistently support the creation of short films, independent production is intensified and firmly shows that there is an alternative way.\n\nFinally, we saw in improvement in both the artistic and the technical quality of production. Watching the beautiful short film of this year’s Festival, created by Artistic Director Yannis Sakaridis, we can see that quality is on a steady upward course. One can no longer discern a short film just by a still. Furthermore, the quality of costume, set, and sound design all function to masterfully serve the script.\n\nIn an effort to provide constructive criticism to new creators, we feel the need to mention a few points of concern.\n\nJudging by the level of this year’s film selection, we would like to encourage creators to experiment with more film genres and techniques. Additionally, with narrative films constituting the greater part of the selection, we suggest that creators further develop the dramaturgy, explore character depth, and incorporate authenticity and time economy, elements which will all lead to a more effective management of the short film form.\n\nWith this year’s achievement of inclusion in the list for the Oscars nominations, the Drama International Short Film Festival seems to be becoming one of the most important festivals in the world. This brings all of us participants face to face with a process of constant maturing, which cannot be overlooked. I am particularly happy that I shared the jury duty with many prominent and unique colleagues, and we all enjoyed talking passionately about film during the days of the Festival.\n\nI would like to personally thank the Festival’s Artistic Director Yannis Sakaridis, who honoured me with the position of Jury President, and to also wish that this institution will continue to grow and mature, as the years go by.\n\nLefteris Charitos, director\n\nPresident of the Jury of the National Competition Programme 2023\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION PROGRAMME 2023 AWARDS\n\nJURY\n\nEva Stefani (President), director, Philip Ilson, Artistic Director of the London Film Festival, Marie-Pauline Mollaret, head of the short film selection at the Cannes Film Festival, cinema critic\n\nGRAND PRIX 2023\n\nto the film ‘AQUERONTE’, directed by Manuel Muñoz Rivas from Spain\n\nA film which presents the rare qualities of purely visual cinema: clarity, spirituality, the ability to perceive reality with eyes both open and closed, paired with masterful sound design. The film is also a reminder of the power of water, a force of the earth which can be equally vital and destructive, as we have witnessed in our country recently.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 4,000-euro prize, offered by the company Raycap.\n\nBEST DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto the film ‘THE OPEN HOUSE’, directed by Julieta Lasarte from Spain\n\nThrough archival material and family footage, the film offers a masterfully executed cinematic vision, while simultaneously maintaining a discreet approach to issues of personal memory, trauma, and loss. At the same time, the film is a discreet celebration of life.\n\nBEST SOUTHEASTERN EUROPEAN FILM AWARD\n\nto the film ‘UNORTHODOX’, directed by Konstantinos Antonopoulos from Greece\n\nA black comedic approach to history, which pokes fun on family and religion, making the viewer simultaneously laugh and question, through a clever undermining of these institutions.\n\nBEST PRODUCTION AWARD “TV5 MONDE”\n\nto the Ajabu Ajabu collective, for the film ‘APOSTLES OF CINEMA’ from Tanzania\n\nWe absolutely love this ode to the power of collective and popular cinema. The way people meet to experience strong images on the big screen and talk excitedly about everything they watched is what brings all of us here in Drama. At the same time, it is equally important to see this experience in the cities and villages of Tanzania, where the DJs breathe life into a film and the ‘bandas’ invite the communities to share into the magic of cinema.\n\nGRAND AWARD OF THE JURY\n\nto the film ‘MIDNIGHT SKIN’, directed by Manolis Mavris from Greece\n\nA film that astounds us with its masterful use of set design and photography direction. An ambitious and sophisticated film that depicts the tendency of dreams to progressively corrupt reality, exposing the desire hidden beneath the surface of habit.\n\nEFA CANDIDACY DRAMA – European Film Academy Award Nomination for Best Short Film\n\nTo the film AQUERONTE, directed by Manuel Muñoz Rivas. M astounds us with its masterful use of set design and photography direction.\n\nThe power of the image and the importance of sound are perfectly aligned in a film that confidently observes with a spiritual eye. Time and space is blurred as we see a myriad of people in this mysterious landscape framed by a misty early morning and across day and night as they silently travel to an unknown destiny.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto Ian Capille for the film ‘THE RIVER AND THE LABYRINTH’ from Portugal and Brazil\n\nA story about friendships and relationships which were lost and found again unfolds through the recollections of two young Brazilian women living in Lisbon. The film eavesdrops on their personal conversations and spies on their private and special moments, in order to paint a moving portrait of the life of young people today.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto the film ‘THE AGE OF INNOCENCE’ by Maximilian Bungarten from Germany\n\nWe would like to showcase a film which constantly surprised us with its unique narration and extremely personal tone.\n\nNATIONAL

DIRECTION AWARD\n\nto Nikos Kolioukos, for the film ‘The Chaos She Left Behind’\n\nFor its sturdy handling of the subject of father-daughter relationships, the exquisite direction of the actors, the

of Sexual Solitude’, directed by Nina Alexandraki\n\nFor its exceptional structure, the escalation of the narration, and its daring and humorous confessions, elements which are all combined with the moving image that both cancels and complements the confessions about the female orgasm.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 1,500-euro prize, offered by the ANT1 Screenplay School.\n\n“DINOS KATSOURIDIS” PHOTOGRAPHY AWARD\n\nto Giorgos Karavoulias, for the film ‘How to Light a Cigarette Without Burning Yourself’, directed by Konstantinos Spanoudakis\n\nFor his exemplary use of lighting, particularly during the sex scenes, which highlight the power of the flesh, as well as for the correct combination of natural and artificial lighting.\n\nThe award is accompanied by full technical coverage for the production of the photographer’s next film, courtesy of the Katsouridis family.\n\nThe award is also accompanied by a six-month contract for a paid internship at the Green Pixel company.\n\nEDITING AWARD\n\nto Antoine Flahaut, for the film ‘The Parade’, directed by Michalis Galanopoulos\n\nFor the exceptional rhythm which harmoniously combines various characters and situations, in order to

Metrage Rendez-Vous industry, Anne Gaschutz, artistic director of the Film Festival in Dresden, Thanos Tokakis, director, actor\n\nGRAND PRIX STUDENT: Almost Famous\n\nto the film ‘Klette’ by Michael Abay from Belgium\n\nAchieving a delicate balance between youthful carefreeness and harsh reality, this coming-of-age film invades a seemingly carefree yet actually harsh life, with a penetrative gaze. For its powerful narration which makes us privy to the unbearable pressure of achieving success in the future, as well as for the exceptional portrayal by the main actress.\n\nThe film is accompanied by a 1,500-euro cash prize, offered by Metropolitan College.\n\nQueer Student Award “ Loud & Proud”\n\nto the film ‘Kokuryo: The Untold Story of bb. Undas 2019’ by Diokko Manuel Dionisio from the Philippines\n\nFor its raw approach to storytelling, lovingly portrayed characters and quick-witted humour. Friendship and loyalty are tested in this tale of two queer protagonists who venture into the night after a beauty pageant gone awry. Meandering between the farcical and hard-hitting reality, this film uses the element of the absurd to highlight the trials and discrimination transgender people face on a daily basis.\n\nSpecial Jury Award “Rising Star”\n\nto the film ‘PHALÈNE’ by Sarah–Anaïs Desbenoit from France\n\nThrough a particularly delicate aesthetic, and without being focused on the narration, this short stands out as a call for tenderness and care in a world stuck in repetition. When replicating gestures becomes a way of subjugation and leads to servitude, there is no other choice than to question if the latent calmness isn’t hiding the enslavement of the women we witness in this polished setup.\n\nDISTRIBUTION AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Sea Urchin’ by Alex Scholz from Greece\n\nThe Distribution Award is sponsored by Radiator IP Sales, and is presented to a Greek film of the programme. The award offers representation for the development of a comprehensive commercial strategy targeting buyers abroad (TV stations and platforms).\n\nSHORT AND GREEN AWARDS 2023\n\nJURY\n\nYorgos Gousis (President), director, Sofia Stavrianidou, director of the Greek Film Festival Berlin, Natasa Christia, curator, journalist, and educator in the field of artistic photography.\n\nDRAMA GREEN AWARD\n\nto the film ‘SEAGULLS SCREAM ON THE WEEKEND’, directed by Maria Stuut and Frederik Stuut from the Netherlands\n\nThe Drama Green Award is presented to a film that managed to successfully present a scientific research project with a poetic and cinematic gaze, through fictionally elevating a documentary-making convention in a soft, humorous, and emotional manner.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 4,000-euro prize, offered by CYCLOPS AMKE\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘TIME TO LIVE’, directed by Hawar Rahimi\n\nProduction: Iraqi Kurdistan, Islamic Republic of Iran\n\nThe Special Jury Award is presented to a film that, by focusing initially on a rural woman performing caregiving duties, manages to turn our gaze to the primordial and equal symbiosis of man and animal.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ANIMATION PROGRAMME 2023 AWARDS\n\nJURY\n\nJutta Wille, director of AGKurzFilm, producer, Alekos Papadatos, animator/director, Anthi Samartzidou, illustrator\n\nBEST ANIMATION FILM – ASIFA HELLAS YANNIS VASILEIADIS AWARD\n\nTo Alec Green and Finbar Watson for the film ‘TEACUPS’\n\nThe jury believes that this film combines a high artistic quality and an elevated production level with the element of compassion to the human soul, conveying, thus, its message masterfully and successfully. The directors do not try to manipulate the feelings of the audience by using the protagonist’s traumatic experience, but rather prefer to showcase his decision to act in this very personal way. The choice to employ animation to depict this non-fictional subject, as well as the use of the voice of the particular narrator, both contribute to the plausibility and perceptibility of the film. We particularly appreciate the directors, who managed to find the appropriate imagery to depict the thoughts and actions of the protagonist, which do not render exclusively the things described by the narrator.\n\nThe award includes a one-year free membership at ASIFA HELLAS, with the full privileges of a registered member (information, visibility, participation in animation extroversion missions at international forums and festivals, etc).\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\nto the film ‘The Tornado Outside’, directed by Maria Tomazou\n\nProduction: United Kingdom\n\nA film that masterfully combines artistic quality and integrity in terms of production. The film relays its story with skill, humour, and intelligence. Many films of the animation programme have touched upon the notion of the fragility of the human soul, as we live in a chaotic, unknown, unbalanced and even evil world. The particular quality of this film hides in the compassion with which it approaches this difficult idea. On the one hand, it helps the viewer playfully connect with the problems and concerns of the protagonist, while on the other, it restores the feelings of safety, certainty, and balance through the course of the story, resulting in a relieving catharsis. We believe it to be a deeply human and emotional film.\n\nKIDDO AWARDS 2023\n\nJury\n\n*The jury of the KIDDO Programme is composed by children and teenagers between the ages of 11-18:\n\nPetros Georgiadis, Tatiana Mavridou, Anna Panagiotopoulou, Christos Sapanidis, Vasiliki Stefanidou\n\nBEST KIDDO FILM\n\nto the film ‘Crab Day’ by Ross Stringer from the United Kingdom\n\nA film that emotionally combines a simple artistic style with a straightforward yet deep meaning. The conception of the film shows us that we don’t need to follow the wrong ideas of a society in order to fit in. Instead, one must love and strive to be the best version of themselves. Love and compassion can transform us all into something good.\n\nSPECIAL MENTION\n\nto the film ‘Ativio, Pieces of Wood’ by Juliette Boucheny from France and Togo\n\nA film that renders its story with creativity, tenderness, humour, and emotion. The conception of this film shows us that we all naturally have an inner guide in our hearts, which protects us and helps us find ourselves. The support children get from people in their lives gives them the hope and encouragement to follow their dreams.\n\nDRAMA PITCHING LAB AWARDS 2023\n\nWe are delighted to be here for the tenth year in a row, and we have had the pleasure to once again welcome participants from all around the world, who felt it important to visit the festival taking place in this small city of Greece; this city which, thanks to this institution, has become so large, that it can embrace many different ideas, concerns, images, and talents from many different countries.\n\nFor our small team, comprised by myself, Georgina Kakoudaki, and John Stevens, the yearly reception of applications by new artists from all around the world is always a lesson; by receiving approximately 120 film drafts, we instantly get a taste of how the rest of the world is thinking at that moment. These are the themes we discovered this year: anxiety about survival, about people, cities, and the entire planet. We saw places we barely know, where people struggle to survive, something that we, the members of the privileged white race, cannot even imagine. We saw films that touched on subjects like trauma and memory of the past, personal and collective stories, compassion, reconciliation, and, ultimately, the highly coveted healing.\n\nThis is why we firmly believe that our workshop at the Pitching Lab is not only useful for the preparation of adequate drafts which will succeed in getting funding, but also for showcasing good ideas, so that they can be made into great films.\n\nBarbara Douka\n\nFINOS FILM AWARD\n\nto the project ‘The Station’ by Isidoros Rostadakis from Greece.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize offered by FINOS FILM.\n\nGREEK FILM CENTRE AWARD\n\nBest Pitching for Development\n\nto the film ‘My Tears, a Sea for Jakarta to Sink’, by Andrea Nirmala Widjajanto from Indonesia\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize offered by the Greek Film Centre.\n\nSTATHIS PARASKEVOPOULOS AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Heaven on Earth’ by Martin Vallejos from Chile\n\nand to the film ‘The Blind Man at the End of the World’ by Jake Muñoz Consing from the Philippines\n\nThe awards are accompanied by sessions for the further development and correction of scripts for selected drafts.\n\nWishing to honour the memory of our dear colleague and mentor Stathis Paraskevopoulos, the Drama International Short Film Festival and the Pitching Lab team have decided to rename the guidance and mentorship awards, so that they will bear his name: These are the Stathis Paraskevopoulos Awards.\n\n“HUMAN VALUES” AWARD BY THE HELLENIC PARLIAMENT\n\nto the film ‘Aqueronte’ by Manuel Muñoz Rivas from Spain\n\nAn exceptional cinematic allegory about life and death, inspired by Greek mythology.\n\nThe Hellenic Parliament presents the “Human Values” award to a film from the International Competition Programme.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a 1,500-euro prize, offered by the Hellenic Parliament.\n\nDEVELOPMENT AWARD (ONASSIS FILM DEVELOPMENT GRANT)\n\nto the film ‘Super’ by Nikolas Kouloglou from Greece\n\nThe Onassis Award is presented to a film that touches upon the themes of chemistry, love, and the decay of human relationships in a modern world where everything is expendable, through a spontaneous, daring, and honest approach.\n\nThe award is accompanied by a prize of 10,000 euro for the development of the director’s first feature film.\n\nFILM SOCIETIES AWARDS 2023\n\nGreek Society of Cinematographers (G.S.C.)\n\nGSC 2023 Merit\n\nto Sotiris Tzatzakis for the film ‘The First Setting Sun of Summer’, directed by Asteris Tziolas\n\nFor its exceptional image, which remained consistently focused on the particular needs of the film’s script.\n\nJury\n\nGiorgos Valsamis, Konstantinos Koukoulios, Giorgos Frentzos\n\nREASONING\n\nThe Greek Society of Cinematographers is happy to be part of the National Competition Programme of the Drama International Short Film Festival for yet another year. We are following the development of visual narration in cinema with great interest, and particularly in festivals like the Drama International Short Film Festival, where both prominent and experienced colleagues are participating, as well as many new creators. And, once again this year, we are presenting our Best Filmmaking Award to a new creator.\n\nThe lens captures the warm light of summer, the rays and shadows of the sun, the vivid colours. It follows the film’s protagonists, the children, in their games both by the sea and inside it. Thanks to the use of the 4:3 frame, we experience nostalgia through the imagery and we travel back to a time of carefree childhood.\n\nThe award of the GSC is accompanied by a 2,000-euro prize, offered by the AN-MAP Film Lab image editing laboratory, for Colour Correction and DCP services to be used in the award-winning filmmaker’s next film.\n\nGreek Union of Film, Television and Audiovisual Technicians\n\n“Technical Integrity” Award\n\nto Mary Kolonia for the film ‘The Armchair on the Pavement”\n\nFor accomplishing a functionally structured result derived from the whole set of cinematic specialties.\n\nGreek Film Critics Association Award\n\nto the film ‘Crossing’ by Aineias Tsamatis and Katerina Mavrogeorgi\n\nFor its tender depiction of the co-existence of two incompatible characters, which is abruptly interrupted by unexpected love and the inevitability of death.\n\nThe Greek Film Critics Association is always present at the Drama International Short Film Festival, which is the most important institution for the promotion of new creators in our country.

The power of love and familial bonds brings people together, even when they are far apart.\n\nFEDERATION OF CINEMATIC CLUBS OF GREECE (OKLE) AWARD\n\nto the film ‘Aerolin’, directed by Alexis Koukias-Pantelis\n\nFor its textured and realistic depiction of a young artist’s everyday struggle to survive. Her stressful, daily battle in adverse and suffocating conditions is recorded through a dynamic narration and an intense and flowing pace, and the film is elevated through the main actress’s expressive performance.\n\nAUDIENCE AWARD 2023\n\nto the film ‘A Piece of Liberty’, directed by Antigoni Kapaka\n\nDISFF 45 (2022) And the winner is…!!!\n\n45th DRAMA INTERNATIONAL SHORT FILM FESTIVAL NATIONAL COMPETITION PROGRAMME AWARDS\n\nJURY\n\nJury Head: Konstantinos Giannaris, Director\n\nJury Members:\n\nMarkella Giannatou, Actress\n\nMarina Gioti, Filmmaker and visual artist\n\nAris Dimokidis, Journalist\n\nIoakim Mylonas, Director, Artistic Director of International Short Film Festival of Cyprus\n\nJURY QUOTE:\n\nThank you Drama and Drama International Short Film Festival for the hospitality and for giving us the opportunity to be here. Thanks to a successful preselection process, we had the opportunity to judge a wide and strong range of films, from first time directors to established filmmakers. Our main interest was the sincere and sometimes successful attempt of the creators to deal with current social issues but also – something very pleasant to us – with different genres of cinema. They conveyed it to us in their own unique and quirky way and impressed us with their maturity, passion and humor.\n\nWe felt very satisfied that the issues related to the personal and social life of women were high up in the agenda and also with the strong presence of female creators, regardless of the fact that we often had objections to the final result, and that we would definitely like even more strong female roles. At the same time we saw surprisingly mature and sensitive depictions of both toxic and non-toxic masculinity, while also successful and hilarious satire on male narcissism.\n\nThe social integration of immigrant communities, or more to the point: the depiction of the lives of second generation children were themes that pleased us with their presence. However, we would also have liked a more robust and contemporary approach, devoid of stereotypes and facts deriving from past times.\n\nSexual identity, in all its forms, was depicted in a guilt-free mood, finally conveying real life without prudence or deciet. But still, in some cases, we would have liked a more complete result in terms of script and direction.\n\nRegarding the depiction of urban violence and marginalized groups, there was an honest attempt from the creators to convey these worlds to us, but we also believe that the strength and effectiveness of this brave effort was undermined by fruitless obsessions with ethics and morals.\n\nThe sea and the water elements have obviously been the protagonists of this year’s prοductions, and we hope next year you will take the mountains!\n\nAbove all, however, as our role as jury demands, we looked without prejudice for quality and for the finest exploration of cinema as art.\n\nAwards\n\nGolder Dionysus – Best Film Award\n\nTo the film “5pm seaside” directed by Valentin Stejskal\n\nA truly

Stefilm.\n\nSpecial Jury Award\n\nto Evi Kalogiropoulou for the film “On Xerxes Throne”\n\nBecause it is a film that depicts the male, female and non-binary body at the limits of fluidity and seeks forbidden affection and contact within a harsh and archetypal masculine industrial environment.\n\nDOCUMENTARY AWARD\n\nto Nasos Gatzoulis for the film “Toxic Magnus”\n\nAn inventive hybrid documentary, a torrential and honest confession of an insecure and self-destructive protagonist-victim of toxic masculinity, which also made us honestly laugh with our hearts.\n\nThe award is

the Greek Cycladic Society.\n\nDRAMA QUEER AWARD\n\nto Dimitris Zouras for the film “Cactus”\n\nA bold perspective that is particularly well served by the performance of its up-and-coming young

Antonis Tsiotsiopoulos for his performance in the film “5pm Seaside” by Valentin Stejskal\n\nBecause Tsitsiopoulos, with finesse and austerity – and with a wounded interiority – managed to convey the psyche of a man trying to negotiate love and lust.\n\nBEST FEMALE PERFORMANCE AWARD\n\nTo Niovi Charalabous for her performance in the film “Daphne” by Tonia Misiali\n\nFor the honest and direct

contrast between the natural and the industrial environment.\n\nBEST EDITING AWARD\n\nto Nikos Vavouris for the film “Last Sigh“ by Haris Raftogiannis.\n\nIn this film, we really liked the masterful, sharp and yet simple changes of pace.\n\nBEST CINEMATOGRAPHY AWARD\n\nto Yiannis Kanakis for the film “Magma” by Lia Tsalta\n\nAn impressive picture that effectively served a difficult cinematic genre

with a dizzying change of attires with references to Greek kitsch that delightfully followed the speedy pace of the film.\n\nThe Greek clothing company Enjoy Fashion Point dresses the next film of the costume designer with its products.\n\nSET DESIGN AWARD\n\nto Eva Goulakou for the film “KIDDO” by Michalis Kimonas\n\nBecause he experimented with conventions of the traditional form successfully bringing them into the present day and found inventive solutions that were highly imaginative and artistic.\n\nMAKEUP, HAIR & SPECIAL EFFECTS AWARD\n\nTo Ioanna Lygizou for Make-up, to Panos Kondylis

We’re all products of our era. Both the people, and our works.\n\nAnd this wildly improbable era, gathered, from the four corners of the world, wildly bizarre fruit which we relished on the silver screen. They were many, they were diverse, they were tantalising, and they fed endless discussions each evening. Here, we ought to thank the Artistic Director and his collaborators, the people whose difficult task it was to select these 35 out of 2,000 films from around the world.\n\nAt the end of the screenings, through this colourful explosion, two distinct trends and an absence could clearly be seen:\n\n– Loneliness; unbearable, impossible to humanly handle loneliness; which leads us to the next trend.\n\n– Escape. More and more new creators escape reality through their work. They create a world that’s utterly their own, in which they set the rules themselves. They’re no longer powerless.\n\nFinally, we find the complete lack of political films, concerning. In an era that is in desperate need of political thought, we felt that new creators conceive politics as a fixed game that they have no part in.\n\nSo, in turn, they give it no part. Is that the solution, though? Or does it reflect the uncertainty of an era that’s dying, while a new one hasn’t yet been born.\n\nWith all this in mind, we tried to select films that attempted to explore the boundaries of filmmaking, while at the same time holding up the human dimension of cinema. As you will see, we embraced the films that, while dealing with existential darkness, left a ray of light in through the cracks. These cracks are sometimes the films themselves.\n\nDuring the final meeting, the jury decided to present the following awards\n\nGrand Prix 2020\n\nAwarded to the film “And she hisses” directed by Monica Lek – Spain/USA.\n\nA film that the jury members unanimously agreed was deserving of the main award. A film that grows inside you, that stretches the boundaries of the medium, that dares to touch the limits, that provokes traditional cinematic narratives and comes out a winner, that fascinates with its subject matter, as well as the protagonists’ interpretations.\n\nThe award is accompanied by 4,000 euros, offered by Raycap.\n\nBest Director\n\nAwarded to the film “Chen Chen” directed by Kargo Chen – Hong Kong.\n\nA modest, simple, honest, touching film, almost healing, one that our soul desperately needed.\n\nBest Southeastern European Film Award\n\nAwarded to the film “As if underwater / Όπως θα συνέβαιναν μέσα στο νερό” directed by Anthi Daoutaki from Greece.\n\nFor its bold and imaginative direction, for the whole world created in a solitary room, and because, although it deals with a very bleak subject, it put a smile on our faces.\n\nBest Animation Film\n\nAwarded to the film “Portrait of Suzanne” by Izabela Plucinska – Poland/Germany/France.\n\nBecause we adored the film of the award-winning director in Drama, which sculpted-literally and metaphorically- the most tragicomedic, surreal, delightful character in the competition.\n\nBest Production Awards “TV5 MONDE”\n\nAwarded to the film “Anna” directed by Dekel Berenson – UK/Ukraine/Israel.\n\nA high quality production, moderate and efficient on every level. From the extras, to the selection of settings.\n\nSpecial award Environment & Climate change\n\nAwarded to the film “The End of Suffering (a proposal)” directed by Jacqueline Lentzou from Greece.\n\nA film that manages, among other things, to give the clearest and most substantial message on climate change. The universe converses with its desperate heroine, and tells her how people made their own cages and turned Earth into a hostile planet.\n\nThe award is accompanied by 4,000 euros, offered by the non-profit organization Cylops\n\n#ThisisEU- European Values\n\nAwarded to the film “Virago” directed by Kerli Kirch Schneider – Estonia.\n\nA film that views history through a comedic prism, a privilege of European thinking, and highlights Eastern-European trauma. In this instance, the heavy burden that fell on women’s shoulders in a disintegrating post-communist society.\n\nNomination EFA Drama 2020\n\nDirected to the film “Favourites” by Martin Monk – Austria/Germany\n\nfor its simplicity, solid construction and its great actors.\n\nSpecial Mention Male Part\n\nAwarded to Kostis Koroneos for his performance in the film “Premier Amour” by Haris Raftogiannis – Greece/France.\n\nfor managing to humanise a completely marginal hero.\n\nSpecial Mention Female Part\n\nAwarded to Stella Vogiatzaki for her performance in the film “As if underwater” by Anthi Daoutaki – Greece.\n\nfor embodying the melancholia of a lonely heroine, gracefully displaying every aspect of her complex psyche.\n\nFIPRESCI Award\n\nThe jury of FIPRESCI consisting of:\n\nΗelene Robert from France\n\nMarla Jacarilla from Spain\n\nDespina Triantafillidou from Greece\n\npresent the FIPRESCI Award to the film “The End of Suffering (a proposal)” by Jacqueline Lentzou from Greece.\n\nThe members of the Fipresci jury have decided to give the International Award to “The End of Suffering” by Jacqueline Lentzou. We appreciate the originality, depth, and simplicity of the project, the aesthetic of the images, and her ability to develop a dreamlike low fi science fiction movie. Furthermore, there is a nice attempt to explain non-duality spiritual concepts.\n\nGreek Society of Film Critics\n\n«Goads», Iris Baglanea.\n\nHellenic Parliament TV Channel Award\n\n“Human Values”\n\nThe television channel of the Parliament bestows the “Human Values” Award to a film of the international program of the festival, which narrates with minimalism and boldness the effort of a woman to approach her underage son, a rural prison inmate, after many years of her being absent.\n\nThe award is bestowed to the film “In her steps” by Anastasia Kratidi from Greece.\n\nInternational Student Awards 2020\n\nThe jury of the International Student Competition of the 43rd Drama International Short Film Festival, consisting of:\n\nLida Vartzioti & Dimitris Tsakaleas\n\nAlexandros Diakosavvas\n\nAlki Politi\n\nDuring the final meeting, the jury decided to present the following awards:\n\nGRAND PRIX STUDENT\n\n“ALMOST FAMOUS”\n\nTo the film “The best orchestra in the world” by Henning Backhaus from Austria.\n\nFor the compelling and humour-laden depiction of the need for diversity representation in art, institutions, and society, the modern viewpoint and the hope that we’ll all soon be identifying as “socks”.\n\nSPECIAL JURY AWARD\n\n“RISING STAR”\n\nTo the film “A mess at Apartment 14″ by Radu Barbu freom Romania\n\nFor the realism in the depiction of everyday life, the balance between boldness, simplicity, and underlying irony, the unpretentious acting, and rounded sketching of multifaceted characters.\n\nHONORARY DISTINCTION\n\nTo the film “22:47 LINIE 34” by Michael Karrer from Switzerland\n\nFor the clear eye and mindful approach of a burning social issue, the entirely current dialogue, the artful rhythm and its deeply existential quality.\n\nSPECIAL AWARD FOR THE BEST NEWCOMER DIRECTOR\n\n“DINOS KATSOURIDIS”\n\nTo the film “Rosa Kairo” by Jacques Simha\n\nTo the film “Violetta” by Fivos Imellos\n\nTo the film “The jar” by Kyriakos Rontsis\n\nAUDIENCE AWARDS\n\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENT COMPETITION\n\nTo the film The Jar by Kyriakos Rontsis.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COMPETITION\n\nTo the film As if underwater by Anthi Daoutaki.\n\nNATIONAL COMPETITION\n\nTo the film Antivirus by Anastasia Sima."
