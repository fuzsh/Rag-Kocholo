        "text": "Where do you live (City, State, or Country)?\n\nI am currently spending some time in Florida.\n\nYour script stood out among hundreds of others. What was the inspiration for your story and why did you write a script instead of a short story or a novel?\n\nI’m a screenwriter, so novels or short stories aren’t my thing. I wrote my story partly to depict today’s political climate but partly to pay homage to and reimagine shows like “House or Cards” and “Homeland.”\n\nHow long did it take you to write your script...and what is your writing process? Do you outline...use index cards...white board...or just start with FADE IN?\n\nI did use an outline first when I initially wrote it as a feature and then I used index cards when I decided to expand “Kill List” into a series. I would say that I spent a year or two writing both the feature and then doing all the research/writing involved to create season one of the series.\n\nWhat is your ultimate ambition as a writer?\n\nWe may have an ultimate goal as a writer when we first start out, but then we learn the reality and challenges one must face to actually get a script produced. That’s the main goal now, the main ambition, to see to it that my work is produced and on the big or small screen.\n\nWas your entry at The Wiki Screenplay Contest a full script or “the first ten pages”? Why did you make that choice?\n\nI entered the first ten pages just for fun, it’s always good to know how people are going to respond to your opening pages.\n\nWhat’s your all-time favorite movie or television show...and why?\n\nI have so many favorites! Early on, my favorites were “The Godfather” and “Goodfellas,” and every Tennessee Williams film ever made. In terms of series, “Game of Thrones” is Number One. I’m also a big fan of the aforementioned “House of Cards” and “Homeland.”\n\nWhat advice do you have for writers hoping to win a contest or place as a finalist as you have?\n\nPractice makes perfect. Write, rewrite, and then do it again 😊\n\nWhat else are you working on that the world needs to know about?\n\nRecently, another feature of mine was optioned, “Unholy Nights” an original screenplay that I wrote several years ago. and I’m very excited about that!"
