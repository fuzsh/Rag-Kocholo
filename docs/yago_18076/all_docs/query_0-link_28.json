        "text": "Most productions of ancient drama in modern Greece were held primarily in the restored open-air theatres of antiquity: initially at Delphi and Epidaurus, and later at Philippi, Thasos, Dodoni, etc. It was the existence of these theatres precisely that gave Greek directors, actors, set and costume designers the opportunity to work systematically on the site where these enduring masterpieces of the ancient dramatic poets were first played. This essay is the English translation of a research paper published in Greek in the exhibition catalogue Ελληνες σκηνογράφοι – ενδυματολόγοι και αρχαίο δράμα (Greek Set-Costume Designers and Ancient Drama)1 which was edited by the author. The essay focuses on the creators, milestones, problems and achievements of set and costume design for the production of ancient drama from 1919 to the end of 20th century. Essential issues are touched upon regarding the tradition, originality and vanguard. The English tranlation is more richly illustrated than the original Greek paper. 1 The touring exhibition Ελληνες σκηνογράφοι – ενδυματολόγοι και αρχαίο δράμα (Greek Set-Costume Designers and Ancient Drama), curated by the H. Fessas-Emmanouil, was organised by the Department of Theatre Studies of the University of Athens (UOA) and the Greek Ministry of Culture. It took place in March-April 1999 at the UOA Kostis Palamas Building and then toured cities in Greece and the Balkans. The topic of the exhibition and of the exhibition catalogue was the adventure of the “look” of Greek productions of ancient drama from 1919 to the end of 20th century, presented through the work of 54 set and costume designers. Α part of the original material of the exhibition and of the exhibition catalogue was the product of primary sources research of 30 undergraduate and postgraduate students of the UOA Department of Theatre Studies. _______________________________________________________________________\n\nTh e present book follows my published history of Greek cinema in an attempt at a closer look at certain filmmakers whose work I briefly analysed there. Each chapter delineates their persistent concern for a cinematic visuality of the lived experience, accented by the social imaginary of Greek culture through the transcultural narrative codes and transnational modes of representation provided by the global medium of cinema. What we are interested in here is not only what made the cinematic ‘product’ possible but how it achieved its accepted form so that its industry could become viable. The work of Michael Cacoyannis, Nikos Koundouros, Yannis Dalianidis, Theo Angelopoulos, Antouaneta Angelidi and Yorgos Lanthimos is presented analytically its historical development (some of them it is their presentation in English).\n\nAfter being awarded an Oscar for his work as artistic director on the film Zorba the Greek, the Greek painter and set designer Vassilis Fotopoulos decided to put himself behind the camera and recreate the ancient myth of The Atridae in his home country. Despite the censorship and the restrictions imposed by the Regime of the Colonels, Fotopoulos' film Orestes was able to be filmed without any complications and would become a valiant allegation for freedom and world peace. From the perspective of the new American concept of underground film and of the hippy culture that was prevalent at the time, Fotopoulos produced a very personal reinterpretation of the ancient myth, updating and modernizing it. His film is today considered a strong example of the reception and transmission of Greek Mythology, highly worthy of in-depth analysis."
