        "text": "Film Independent’s Fiscal Sponsorship program opens the door to nonprofit funding for independent filmmakers and media artists. Donate today and help bring Crystal to life.\n\nLogline\n\nWhen a divorced middle-aged city bus driver crosses paths with a beautiful young trans wouldbe starlet, their attraction for each other becomes an unexpected lesson in rediscovery.\n\nSynopsis\n\nWith her sights once set to perform on Broadway, Crystal Emerald Greene (32) now finds herself working multiple jobs and supporting her non-supportive live-in boyfriend Shawn (30’s). Questioning him regarding the text she’s viewed on his phone, Shawn angrily storms out. Later, at her Jazz Club gig, Crystal performs a stunning finale making us understand her incredible talent, but also, where her current life is as an entertainer. Backstage after her performance, the glamorous matriarch club owner Ms. Blue (60’s) visits Crystal’s dressing room. Wanting only the best for her, Ms. Blue finds out Crystal’s car is being fixed and Shawn won’t be picking her up from work, which impels Crystal to ride the bus home. Not music to her ears, Ms. Blue endearingly reminds Crystal to really understand her worth, and value those who value her. Boarding the bus, Crystal meets the robust Bus Driver John Max (46), who takes an immediate interest. As he works on getting to know her, he begins to share his history of kids, divorce and feeling old. Crystal’s uplifting response stamps her interest in John, igniting him to extend an invite for a drink after his shift—she accepts. Through conversation, John becomes an unexpected catalyst in Crystal rediscovering her self-worth, getting her to understand the importance of moving forward in pursuing her Broadway dreams, while she gives John a newfound connection of feeling desired. Exuberant, they arrive at his car after a wonderful evening. Crystal’s curiosity leads her to ask John about the number of Trans-women that he’s dated–John, not clear about her question, makes Crystal realize he doesn’t know she’s Trans—immediately she shares her truth, and John’s now challenged with this reality. Surprising Crystal, John insightfully embraces why they actually met. Months later, Crystal finds herself at her first big Off-Broadway audition.\n\nMeet the Filmmakers\n\nJeffrey L Relf – Writer/Director\n\nFresh voice, fresh perspective, Relf has written three feature-length screenplays 85, An American Punk Tale and Burgen.
