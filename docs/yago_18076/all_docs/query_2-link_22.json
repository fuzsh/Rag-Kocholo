        "text": "I have received my MA in Film and Television Production from the University of Bristol, UK and my BA (with High Honors) in Communication and Cinema Studies with an emphasis on Experimental Filmmaking from the University of Iowa, USA. I have been very fortunate to have studied and mentored under the guidance of the experimental filmmaker Leighton Pierce (currently the Dean of the School of Film/Video at CalArts). I have acted as the Head of MEDIA Cyprus (Creative Europe Programme) for over ten years but my true passion for filmmaking and directing forced me to make challenging decisions in following my dreams. My short films have been screened at many important International Film Festivals such as Rotterdam International Film Festival, Oberhausen International Short Film Festival, and have received prestigious awards from Hamburg IFF, Drama IFF, and Cyprus International Short Film Festival.\n\n​\n\nMy short film titled Lullaby received the prestigious award Tonia Marketaki for Best Directing in Drama International Short Film Festival in 2009 while it was taken by STOP International in Geneva and Anti Human Trafficking Organizations in Cyprus in order to promote anti-trafficking legislation throughout the island and awareness through various screenings and discussions while it was screened in all major military camps in Cyprus.\n\n​\n\nMy debut feature film .dog has received funding for Script Development and Production by the Cyprus Cinema Advisory Committee, ERT, the Greek Film Center, and SEE Cinema Network and International Distribution by URBAN FRANCE.\n\n​\n\nI am a member of the Cyprus Directors Union, a member of the European Women’s Audiovisual Network and President of the Committee of the International Motion Film Festival, Cyprus.\n\n​\n\nI am currently working on the script development of my second feature film, My Name Is Lilyand the TV Series ReCLAIMED aimed at the International Market and Platforms (Video On Demand).\n\n​"
