        "text": "Crystal Castle is a dream world in NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams and Helen's second level. This level is also known as Dream of Glass and World of Glass and its music theme is Crystal Choir.\n\nOverview[]\n\nCrystal Castle is a dream world representing the fragility of Helen's heart, with almost everything being made of crystalline glass. The outside of the castle looks like a desert area, with giant purple crystals growing from the ground and floating rocks made of glass. Inside the castle, there are invisible glass cubes and mirror rooms which show hidden secrets.\n\nThis level has a special dash ball, which turns NiGHTS giant and prisms that split them into five tiny clones of themself. There are also floating diamonds throughout the garden, that will shoot a laser beam if NiGHTS bumps into them. These lasers serve to destroy giant glass cages, keeping secret items inside them, one of them even has a Dream Drop. Sometimes it is necessary to hit multiple diamonds in a specific order to destroy the glass gates.\n\nThis level's boss is Bomamba and its hidden ideya is Helen's Blue Ideya.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMissions[]\n\nChase Mission[]\n\nHelen climbs the chain on NiGHTS' cage in order to dualize with them and chase after the Goodles, to get the keys and unlock the three NiGHTS cages. Once all of the cages have been opened, the player will be sent to battle Bomamba for the first time.\n\nLink Challenge[]\n\nNiGHTS spots an Octopaw and with Helen, they chase after him. The player will need to make a chain of at least 30 links, going through the rings Octopaw leaves behind. In addition, NiGHTS may slam into some crystal icicles and will earn bonus points for smashing through.\n\nLabyrinth Guide[]\n\nHelen goes back to Crystal Castle without NiGHTS, and finds a boy lost inside the castle. The boy says he needs to help a friend very quickly and doesn't know how to leave, so Helen leads him through a maze of mirrors (in which some rooms have mirrored walls or don't) in the castle and out of it and to the door. The boy thanks her, they introduce each other, and then he leaves. The player will be timed on how much time they took to help Will out of the castle.\n\nJewel Mountain[]\n\nBecause the Nightmarens try to steal jewels from the Jewel Mountain (they are part of the Ideya), it starts to erupt. Helen and NiGHTS must collect more than 50 jewels erupting from the mountain. If the player manages to do so, no jewels will be taken by Nightmarens.\n\nBony Bomamba[]\n\nNiGHTS will fight Bomamba for the second and last time, who now has cats with no bodies sitting around on her hat. NiGHTS must tilt Bomamba's magic seals to drop the black cats into the holes. The cats will eventually turn into balls if the seals keep on moving, and NiGHTS must direct the seals in order for the cats to fall into the holes. NiGHTS must do this twice in order to win. However, the cats may turn back into form if the seals aren't rocking hard enough, and will rocket towards NiGHTS (if the cats hit them, the player loses five seconds of time). Bomamba also may aim green magic balls at NiGHTS if not moving fast enough. Once the wicked witch is beaten, the player gains the Blue Ideya of Intelligence, the Rocket Persona, and access to Memory Forest.\n\nGallery[]\n\nVideos[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nCuriously, Crystal Castle makes a cameo in Helen's ending cutscene, as a poster on Helen's room. For unknown reasons though, Crystal Castle is called \"The Crystal Palace\" in the poster.\n\nCrystal Castle is the only dream world where Reala didn't make an appearance in a cutscene.\n\nReala does appear in Crystal Castle in the game's Multiplayer mode though.\n\nCrystal Castle is the only level where the Beezes aren't spawned by the Beez Pods.\n\nIn the Labyrinth Guide mission, it is possible to make Will get stuck and thus, the player can finish the mission without him.[2]"
