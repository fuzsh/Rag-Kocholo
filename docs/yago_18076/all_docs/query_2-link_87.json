        "text": "It is a commonplace in film scholarship that during the 1950s and 1960s the links between the cinema of Greece and that of the former socialist countries, including the Balkans, were either non-existent or extremely limited. As a major reason for this isolation of Greece from the cinemas of communist Europe, apart from linguistic, religious and other cultural barriers, is often highlighted the deep political divide caused by the Cold War since Greece was part of the Western block. In contrast to these assumptions, however, I will demonstrate that this supposed isolation and disconnectedness is a misconception and that there was a significant degree of cinematic interaction between Greece and Eastern Europe especially in the 1960s. In order to briefly explore film exchange between Greece and the former socialist countries during 1950-1967 – the first two post civil-war decades until the rise to power of the dictatorship of the Colonels – I will focus mainly on the availability of Eastern European films in Greece and their popularity with Greek audiences, the First Balkan Film Festival held in Varna in 1965 and the transnational collaborations and co-production initiatives that took place at the time. Simultaneously, I will put emphasis on the political framework that affected this exchange focusing on both Greek left-wing and governmental policies including censorship. I am fully aware that there are further crucial aspects of the phenomenon, such as the flow of Greek films to Eastern Europe, the cinema made by Greek political refugees in the host communist countries, the thematic and stylistic influences of Eastern European films on Greek cinema, or the work of Greek filmmakers who were trained in Eastern European film academies. I have to make clear, however, that these are beyond the scope of this paper which is non- exhaustive but an introduction to a topic that requires further research and detailed study."
