        "text": "About CPIFF\n\nMike Reiss, writer of The Simpsons since it began said:\n\nYou run the very best festival we’ve ever been to, and we’ve been to a lot. This is as good as it gets! It’s a very casual setting but there’s nothing casual about how it’s put together and how high the quality of the films are. There’s food and drink everywhere, they filled the house, it’s been A LOT of fun every night. Really top notch.\n\nAs well as being lauded as ‘the coolest’, we are also one of the most inclusive festivals. Since our beginning in 2009, we have ensured every screening night has films starring and made by various ethnic groups and include as many LGBTQIA+ films as possible.\n\nCPIFF receives films from across the globe and screens only the very best with fabulous food and drink in awesome venues. We use Everyman’s flagship cinema in Crystal Palace (pictured below) and the incredible West Norwood Picturehouse. A huge thank you to both for supporting CPIFF and independent film. The film quality is remarkable and each night is a social event to remember, a one time opportunity to catch these incredible films. Many attendees say they enjoy CPIFF more than most mainstream Hollywood films. Filmmakers fly in from around the world for fascinating Q&As, and many comment on the higher quality of film at CPIFF. We vigilantly curate each night so each section is pure quality with an eclectic mix of genres. That’s why most nights sell out in advance. Filmmakers want an audience and the public want to be entertained—CPIFF provides both.\n\nTom Scurr, producer:\n\nWhat you’ve created with CPIFF is phenomenal, it’s such an asset to filmmakers. The film industry and festival circuit is like the wild west but you’re so passionate and you care about film – it’s glorious! All filmmakers are grateful to you, thank you!\n\nPhil Dunn, writer/director:\n\nOUTSTANDING festival. This is how you do it. Other festivals take note. Tons of sold out nights, amazing selection of high calibre films and beautiful screenings at gorgeous Everyman Cinemas. Topped off by amazing awards event with food, drinks, desserts, stand-up comedy and hilarious comedy shorts (like really LOL funny). Thanks for nominating The Stupid Boy for Best Short Film. Such an honour when the selections were so high class!\n\nCat White, writer/producer/director:\n\nI’m absolutely blown away with what you’ve done. Firstly, a full house—congratulations! I’ve been speaking to everyone here—the films are INCREDIBLE. I honestly think it’s the most incredible curation of film I’ve seen and I’ve done a lot of these festivals.\n\nVolunteering\n\nCPIFF is only made possible each year with the help of its volunteers. Fill out this form if you’d like to get involved.\n\nBuy previous posters and merchandise\n\nPrevious CPIFF winners\n\nFOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM"
