        "text": "Absolutely amazed by how this film manages to speak on so many social issues on a more subtextual level, while also maintaining an interesting story for its entirety.\n\nIts themes, are clearly still present, to this day, and will probably continue to be, as it is obvious that no real change has taken place regarding such issues.\n\nIt's really insane to think about how it's been almost 60 years since the incident, that inspired this film, took place, and yet the story is more relevant than ever, with a striking number of almost 20 femicides taking place in Greece just in the last year.\n\nThis is, besides everything else, a really depressing film, considering how much similar it seems to today's reality.\n\n9.3/10\n\nI really liked this.\n\nTonia Marketaki did a very nice job with directing and the cinematopraphy was really good.\n\nIt reminded me of the movie Reconstruction (1970) of Angelopoulos.\n\nThe perfomances were good but the only drawback is that the movie was 3 hours when it should have been 2 hours.\n\nI found the last part in the court that different people were discussing about madness and crime ,irrelevant and not interesting because it just prolonged the plot but it might was a good thing for 70's people to watch and think.\n\nAlso the main character is a copy of Raskolnikiv of the famous novel of Fyodor Dostoyevsky \"Crime and Punishment\" .\n\nQuite an achievement. Marketaki unravels her tale with a sure, steady hand, taking her time to shed light on every side of the story at every corner, and delivers a 3-hour epic that almost never drags and laudably shifts its focus halfway through with no hesitation. Some of the acting is decidedly amateurish and I found the court scenes a bit overlong and occasionally unsubtle, but overall this is a gripping, acute and sadly apropos portrayal of an unabashed society cruelly hijacking a femicide."
