The film is full of subtle and often not-so-subtle cues evoking the desire to escape Franco’s Spain. I’ve read, though I don’t know if it is true, that the censorship difficulties that the film faced were connected to its use of Catalan dialogue. If this is true, the version that survives today (in a reconstruction made in the early 1980s from two incomplete 16mm positive prints), is missing that important element. The reconstruction appears to me to have taken some liberties with the film in terms of editing technique. Unfortunately, in the state we have it, it is difficult to see all of the time Llobet Gracia’s sophisticated use of depth of field.\n\n‘Vida en sombras’ [Life in shadows] is a film by Llobet Gràcia, a Catalan filmmaker coming from amateur cinema, who, during the post-war period, with modest means and far from the official sanction of the Fascist government, delved into the power of cinema to heal personal and collective wounds.\n\nLlorenç Llobet Gracia (Barcelona, 1911-Sabadell, 1976) had bonded intimately with the world of cinema from the time his his father gave him a Pathé-Baby camera in his youth. This childhood experience is re-enacted at the beginning of ‘Vida en sombras’, the only commercial film he made in 1948, after having developed an intense activity in amateur cinema circles. Produced by himself, under the name Castilla Films, the film, which went through serious financial and censorship obstacles, has a free almost experimental style, outside the established codes of industrial cinema.\n\nTechnical specs:\n\nFile name : Life in Shadows.avi\n\nFormat : AVI at 1 609 Kbps\n\nLength : 855 MiB for 1h 14mn 16s 800ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual (XviD)\n\nAspect : 656 x 496 (4:3 display AR) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio (MP3)\n\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nDownload Links:\n\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!jAt1yZAT!y0kCyK5NDWBe3BaPcJZo4cI1uE16M1KYyIbOABlKlZE\n\nRating: 8.2/10\n\nRuntime: 74\n\nLanguage: Serbo-Croatian\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nCountry: Yugoslavia\n\nColor: Color | Black & White\n\nIMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173015\n\nDirector: Vatroslav Mimica\n\nCast:\n\nSlobodan Dimitrijevic … Marko Pozgaj\n\nPavle Vuisic … Markov otac (as Pavle Vujisic)\n\nGizela Huml … Markova baka\n\nFabijan Sovagovic … Golubar boltek\n\nSergio Mimica-Gezzan … mali Marko (as Srdjan Mimica)\n\nRudolf Kukic … gospon Haller\n\nZoran Konstantinovic\n\nJagoda Kaloper … Rajka\n\nRenata Freiskorn … Bivsa supruga Milada\n\nOlivera Katarina … Markova ljubavnica (as Olivera Vuco)\n\nLada Milic … Barbara, nova ljubav\n\nIvo Kadic … Fotograf\n\nMarcel Cukli\n\nAndro Lusicic … Kolega novinar\n\nNedim Omerbegovic … Inzenjer u pogonu\n\nBranko Spoljar … Muz Markove ljubavnice\n\nMirko Vojkovic … Covjek iz kafica\n\nRadojko Jezic … Kolega sa sastanka\n\nFahro Konjhodzic … Vodja pogrebnog orkestra\n\nAdam Vedernjak … Bozo, kolega sa sastanka\n\nBranko Bonacci … Kolega sa sastanka\n\nDusan Radmanovic\n\nVelimir Chytil … Automehanicar (as Velimir Hitil)\n\nZdenka Hersak … Majka\n\nKruno Valentic … Vozac konjske zaprege\n\nMladen Hanzlovsky … Novinar na sahrani s novinama u rukama\n\nLjubo Kapor … mornar Janko\n\nBranko Koivanic\n\nBranko Majer … Sudac\n\nDragan Jankovic\n\nDragutin Kolman\n\nDrago Bahun … Poznanik\n\nZeljko Mazur\n\nBiserka Alibegovic … Markova kolegica koja ga poziva na telefon\n\nIvo Skrabalo … Kolega sa sastanka\n\nNikola Otrzan … Luka, Markov kolega\n\nIvo Baltic\n\nFinka Pavicic-Budak\n\nLeo Butorac\n\nArsen Dedic … Pjevac (uncredited)\n\nDescription: The film follows a day in the life of a divorced Zagreb journalist Marko Požgaj (played by Dimitrijević), an average modern intellectual who goes about his daily business. Mundane scenes of Požgaj’s day are shown interspersed with flashbacks and fantastic imagery reflecting his inner life. These include his recollections of childhood, his feelings about the present and past, including memories of his first marriage, his current girlfriend Rajka (Jagoda Kaloper) and his father killed in World War II (Pavle Vuisić), as well as his fantasies and hopes about the future.\n\nThe film is today regarded as a logical continuation in Mimica’s body of work as it replicates the stream of consciousness concept previously seen in his critically acclaimed 1964 film Prometheus of the Island. The film’s visual structure (based on a collage of scenes set in the past and present mixed with fantastic imagery, which are indicated by changes in picture quality and colour) and the theme of contemporary social alienation (in part resulting from the trauma of War World II) have urged critics to draw comparisons to his animated film The Inspector Is Back! (Inspektor se vratio kući, 1957) and have been called “trademarks of Mimica’s entire body of work”. Andrew James Horton, writing for the film journal Kinoeye wrote in 2001: “Some of the devices now seem a little dated. Changes in image quality and colour are probably less exciting now than they were then, and the intercutting of documentary footage of the concentration camps particularly now has a somewhat heavy-handed and “obvious” feel to it. But the film still exudes the appeal of what the New Wave must have looked like when it first emerged as a trend, with its concentration on ordinary people and charmingly observed street scenes. And its this that makes the film endearing. There’s none of the removed coldness that formal experimentation can bring to a film as an unfortunate by-product.”\n\nTechnical specs:\n\nFile name : Monday or Tuesday.avi\n\nFormat : AVI at 1 314 Kbps\n\nLength : 700 MiB for 1h 14mn 25s 920ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual (XviD)\n\nAspect : 720 x 524 (1.374 display AR) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio (MP3)\n\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nDownload Links:\n\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!fdxiWa4L!SKurPQt6VcsWIPFCkAZARwBnU-Ebw5wJb5LorufZWHs\n\nRating: Awaiting 5 votes\n\nRuntime: 260\n\nLanguage: Mandarin\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nCountry: North Korea\n\nColor: Black & White\n\nIMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2226515\n\nDirector: Ik Kyu-choe, Kim Jong-il\n\nCast:\n\nN/A\n\nDescription: Are you ready for something completely out of left field? Today, I present to you the infamous North Korean war epic, Sea of Blood. Based on a revolutionary play supposedly written by the Eternal President of the Democratic People’s Republic, Kim Il-sung, and rumored to have been co-directed by the late, great Kim Jong-il (The North Korean film museum claims it was during the shooting of this film that his Kimness invented multi-camera shooting). Clocking in at a whopping 260 minutes, there is more propaganda here than you can shake a bust of Kim Il-sung at. Within North Korea, the operatic version of Sea of Blood is the only show at Pyongyang’s main theater, and is staged three to four times a week. This revolutionary work is also popular among the Chinese, especially those who lived through the Cultural Revolution, and have fond memories of revolutionary antics.

In the film symbolism and realism become one. But above all, CRYSTAL NIGHTS is a film about absolute love, about the love that overcomes the barriers of time, that swings magically between “always” and “never”, that remains haughtily aloof when everything else bows down (in the Song of Songs it borders on religious worship). And it contains one of the most beautiful love scenes ever shot in the Greek cinema something like a mystical rite, like a flower of devotion to life.\n\nDownload Links:\n\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!gNsyVKDI!IazSoA-dqR_9wouHOIcTg9j3AK3XC8LtEKTvx51b7js\n\nTechnical specs:\n\nFile name : Crystal Nights.mkv\n\nFormat : Matroska at 1 330 Kbps\n\nLength : 1.3 GiB for 2h 14mn 32s 127ms\n\nVideo #0 : AVC\n\nAspect : 656 x 368 (16:9 display AR) at\n\nAudio #0 : AAC\n\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nLanguage : el\n\nText #0 : UTF-8\n\nLanguage : en\n\nRating: 8.7/10\n\nRuntime: 106\n\nLanguage: Croatian\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nCountry: Yugoslavia\n\nColor: Black & White\n\nIMDb Link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0171246\n\nDirector: Fadil Hadzic\n\nCast:\n\nJudita Hahn … Eva Ruzic (as Judita Han)\n\nRade Markovic … Ognjen Ruzic\n\nFranjo Kumer … Ludvig Farkas\n\nToma Jovanovic … Policijski inspektor Hribar (as Tomo Jovanovic)\n\nVoja Miric … Zavodnik (as Vojo Miric)\n\nSonja Hlebs … Prostitutka Silvija\n\nKarlo Bulic … Advokat Bruno\n\nVanja Drach … Ognjenov prijatelj\n\nFabijan Sovagovic … Ustaski policajac zvani ‘Beba’\n\nVeljko Maricic … Sudac\n\nHermina Pipinic … Vera, zavodnikova zenska\n\nMirko Boman … Stranac na granici\n\nMilan Bosiljcic … Pijani mornar\n\nMaria Braico … Leonina, Brunova domacica\n\nRajko Dukcevic … Vlado, policijski inspektor\n\nDjurdja Ivezic … Ruza, Ruziceva ljubavnica\n\nMiodrag Loncar\n\nDanilo Maricic … Carinik\n\nGordana Petrovic … Talijanka s naocalima\n\nSemka Sokolovic-Bertok … Prostitutka Andja (as Semka Sokolovic)\n\nZdenka Trach … Farkaseva susjeda\n\nFranek Trefalt … Dezurni policajac na Sezani (as Franc Trefalt)\n\nDjuro Turinski\n\nDusan Dobrosavljevic … Policajac (uncredited)\n\nVladimir Susic … Kartas (uncredited)\n\nDescription: An inspector looks for motives that made a woman he doesn’t consider a criminal perform a fraud.

A very interesting and tense drama/thriller from the specialist of the genre, Fadil Hadžić.\n\nTechnical specs:\n\nFile name : Back of the Medal.avi\n\nFormat : AVI at 1 017 Kbps\n\nLength : 699 MiB for 1h 36mn 5s 760ms\n\nVideo #0 : MPEG-4 Visual (XviD)\n\nAspect : 640 x 480 (4:3 display AR) at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0 : MPEG Audio (MP3)\n\nInfos : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nDownload Links:\n\nhttps://mega.co.nz/#!GJFBiYSA!FQJDy16nrMF_Qlvqpa4br-FT50CkWzdHKNrs4r2ADsU"
