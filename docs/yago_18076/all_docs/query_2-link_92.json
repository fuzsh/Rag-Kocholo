The Festival is going to attempt to make the audience aware of some crucial topics that require its critical stance and participation, in order to be resolved. The large catalogue of the selected documentaries and the conversations, the speeches, the master-classes and the exhibitions -that are going to accompany the screenings- are the mediums of the Festival.\n\nThe Thessaloniki Documentary Festival – Images of the 21st Century celebrates its 15th anniversary and honors the highly creative, cinematic, socially-committed and constantly evolving art of the documentary by presenting a collection of beloved films that epitomize the Thessaloniki Documentary Festival from its inception until today.\n\nThe selected documentaries challenged perceptions, exposed truths, entertained, provoked fruitful dialogue and helped shape the Festival character, playing a formative role in its journey throughout the past 15 years. Many of the both acclaimed and neophyte filmmakers that made the films attended the Documentary Festival, to present and discuss them with the Thessaloniki audiences, enriching the viewing experience and providing valuable insight. The anniversary tribute is named 15 Festival Years: a Fascinating Journey. In Addition, a special tribute to the Chilean documentary film director Patricio Guzman is planned. He will be at Thessaloniki, in order to meet his audience.\n\nThe tribute 15 Festival Years: an Fascinating Journey, the homage to Patricio Guzman, the festivals sections HUMAN RIGHTS, SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT, VIEWS OF THE WORLD, STORIES TO TELL, PORTRAITS: HUMAN JOURNEYS, GREEK PANORAMA, all the Greek documentaries of the festival, the photographic exhibition Thessaloniki 101 and the happenings at Thessaloniki Film Achieves are sponsored by the European Union – European Regional Development Fund 2007-2013.\n\nFiles"
