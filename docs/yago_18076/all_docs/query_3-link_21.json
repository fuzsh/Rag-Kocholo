With the support of the Greek Film Archive and Finos Film.\n\nWe hope to see you at the movie theaters so we can discover and rediscover shadows, brilliant flashes, colors and sound together – a country as it was lit, narrated and redefined by the unique gaze of Greek 20th Century filmmakers.\n\nLAGFF was one of few film festivals around the world chosen to participate in screening films from this unique collection of classic films. We have selected 10 films in total. Four films for theatrical screening and six films for virtual screenings."
