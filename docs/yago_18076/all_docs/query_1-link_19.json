        "text": "Due to a heat advisory, this event is moving indoors to the Great Hall.\n\nComing this summer to a museum near you: movies, music, puppets, and more!\n\nPresented in partnership with the Arkansas Cinema Society, enjoy a “puppet-palooza” of family-friendly fun in the Great Hall as we celebrate the art of puppetry and movie magic pioneered by artists like Jim Henson. Start your night off with creative activities inspired by Henson’s films, including artmaking, presentations, and more.\n\nThen, once the sun begins to set (around 8:30 p.m.), we’ll settle in for an outdoor screening of our feature film: The Dark Crystal. Directed by cinematic legends Jim Henson and Frank Oz, The Dark Crystal follows the fantastical adventures of Jen, a Gelfling on a quest to restore balance to the world of Thra and overthrow the tyrannical and sorcerous Skeksis. A masterfully crafted dark fairy tale, this 1982 classic has been praised for its heartfelt story, imaginative character designs, and unique aesthetic.\n\nSo whether you’re 8 or 80, stop on by—there’s plenty of indoor, creative fun to enjoy this summer at Crystal Bridges. See you there!"
