        "text": "Your Why is a deeply personal thing. You are the only person who can unlock your Why (...and keep it that way). Your Why is not something as simple and obvious as: ‚ÄúTo help as many people as possible!‚Äù (...which is what people usually tell me on strategy calls). And it‚Äôs not something like, ‚ÄúI want to make a lot of money to be financially free.‚Äù Go deeper. Why is that your Why? Imagine an onion. We need to peel back a layer to see what‚Äôs beneath, then another layer and another layer. I want you to keep going deeper and deeper into your Why until you fully understand what drives your decisions. Remember, while your Vision is centered around what your company/message will do \"for others\", your Why is centered around what your company/message will do \"for you.\" That said, what is YOUR Why? üëá\n\nWhy? Why? Why? When kids turn a certain age they start asking why for everything... We find this annoying often, yes cute, but it gets too much. However, I believe we must return to this stage in our lives more often. Asking WHY to all we do and envision. Why am I doing this? Why do I believe what I believe? Why do I act like this? Why do I work here? Why this business? you get the picture.... So what is your Why? Why that? Why? Why? Why? Now you are getting to the real reasons....\n\nA word about snakes. Basically there are three kinds. One kind will seek warmth for a short time and move on. A second will rattle, hiss, or rise up to let you know they are there, similar to a challenge or a warning before they bite. The third kind uses a method that is much like a combination of the first two but more subtle. It recognizes you have something to offer, like body heat, and shows you their interest with a great big hug until the very life is drawn from you. All snakes have mouths that seems small but when unhinged manage to take much more than you could have imagined. Learn to recognize the snakes in life and business.\n\nDo you TRUST yourself? There are many things we work on in the Body for Business. TRUST is one of them Trusting your decisions, trusting your gut, knowing what it feels like in your body to make those choices confidently. Here is a tip... you want to work with someone because everyone else is, but you get a feeling that you do not like them. You just can't put your finger on it. That is a RED FLAG right there and it is a NO. Straight out. When you want to work with someone and it is a yes you are more likely to have reservations that looks like... I can't possibly spend that kind of money on me (if you have the money, then you need to need look at your beliefs around being worthy and deserving) I want to but this may not work for me (then you need to ask how is this going to benefit me?) Your body holds all the signals, it knows whether something is right or not. You are the decision maker and empowering yourself to know the difference is a huge step.\n\nWant to stand out? Be the Zebra in a world full of Horses. Everyone wants to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù their business. They want to be: ‚Ä¢ Faster ‚Ä¢ More Useful ‚Ä¢ More Efficient But they end up being a carbon copy of everyone else. Trying to win the same rat race to the top. Remove competition through authenticity. ‚Ä¢ Share your story ‚Ä¢ Lean on your strengths ‚Ä¢ Solve your specific problems Show your stripes and you‚Äôll be a business no one can ignore.\n\nGood morning, connection enthusiasts! When you're in the world of business, reputation is everything, right? Much like high school, but with less acne and more coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è üòé Here's the scoop: ‚Ä¢ Reputation is more than just a catchy Taylor Swift song. It's the backbone of your business persona üï¥Ô∏è. ‚Ä¢ It paints a picture of your values, ethics, and service quality before clients or competitors even say hello . ‚Ä¢ It's an open secret: we are all being rated and ranked all the time. Star systems, thumbs up or thumbs down, emojis - you get the picture. üåüüëçüëé Remember my friends, building a solid reputation is like creating a masterpiece. It's about pausing at the blank canvas that is your business and channeling your inner Van Gogh\n\nIn the story of your business, you are not the hero! Remember that, because everyone wants to be the hero. Including your clients. Your job is to make them the hero and help them solve their problems, accomplish their goals, and improve their lives. That makes you the guide. Yes, you are wise old Ob-Wan Kenobi. Your clients are wandering, searching for answers to a problem. Offer to guide them on a journey to peace, freedom, prosperity, or wherever they want to go. If you do, they will truly understand what you do and why it‚Äôs so valuable. And they‚Äôll follow wherever you lead."
