        "text": "Every year, Norske Skog Golbey buys and recycles 450,000 tonnes of waste paper for its newsprint production. From 2024, we will also consume 610,000 tonnes of old corrugated containers for our containerboard production.\n\nTo meet our newsprint production requirements, this waste paper must consist exclusively of newspapers, magazines and leaflets. Unfortunately, since 2017, we have seen a deterioration in the quality of our raw material. It contains too many non-fibrous materials (plastic, metal, glass, staples, sand, etc.).\n\nTo avoid reducing the final quality of our products, our Procurement department has had to adapt by regularly communicating with our suppliers in coordination with production and the quality department. We therefore changed our specifications in 2021 to take this deterioration in quality into account. This work seems to be paying off.\n\nAt the same time, we continue to work alongside waste operators, local authorities and public organisations to explain to the general public how to sort their waste, and we take part in many awareness-raising operations.\n\nThe traceability of our finished products is ensured by labels enabling them to be identified. This gives our customers essential information about the reels: weight, grammage, width, etc.\n\nThe barcode can become a valuable help in managing their stock.\n\nFinally, if a reel is not fully satisfactory, this code allows us to identify the circumstances of its production and to find out why."
