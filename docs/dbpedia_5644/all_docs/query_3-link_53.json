My synagogue community in Staunton, Virginia when I was an undergrad at James Madison University: Several families, mostly couples with grown kids, took me in, inviting me to weekly dinners and having long conversations after services.

One line in particular really spoke to me: “Do we settle for the world as it is, or do we work for the world as it should be?” Reading this line in July 2020 and looking at the world around me, I wanted to do something to help, but I didn’t yet know what.

I hope that we can find empathy for both the people around us and ourselves. Also, please listen to the experts and wear a mask!\n\nWhat do you miss most during social distancing? I miss seeing my family. We’ve had to postpone indefinitely a trip to see my parents, and that’s been hard.\n\nWhat makes you laugh? My kids are pretty funny.

My husband is the greatest man I know; steady, kind, gracious... I want to be more like him. He challenges me to be better everyday 🙂 My boys. Working to raise good people is exhausting, but seeing glimpses of their future selves is worth all of the work.\n\nWho has had a lasting impact on your life? So many special people have left their footprints on my heart... This one is tough. Is have to say my patients.

It pushes me to be a better healthcare provider.\n\nWhat movie or book would you recommend? Go to movies: Secondhand Lions, Love Actually, and Heartbreak Ridge. All of the inappropriate humor and feel good stuff you could ever ask for. I read everything so too many books to list.\n\nWhat advice or thoughts would you like to share regarding the pandemic?

Sometimes all you can do is all you can do - and that is just fine Keep your chin up ❤️ Oh! Wear a mask and wash your hands 😉\n\nWhat do you miss most during social distancing? Hugs. When it is safe again, I am freaking hugging everyone - so watch out!\n\nWhat makes you laugh? I love to laugh. I have a deep appreciation so sarcasm, dark humor and quick wit.
