More than 50,000 forest owners in southern Sweden already know this. Together we find new solutions, help create the products of tomorrow – and share the profits. Together, we also form a leading forest industry group, big enough to be an important influencer in many contexts.\n\nSustainable forestry\n\nOwning a forest comes with a lot of responsibility, but it can also be simple, fun and profitable. Södra is happy to help in this regard. In our services for members, forest and business management as well as prospective development are obvious parts. And we know that lasting values are created by keeping sustainability and long-term thinking first in mind.\n\nWant to learn more?\n\nDo you wish to know more about membership and ownership in Södra? Or perhaps you have questions about your forest and its development? We are always close at hand and our forest inspectors are happy to help you with expert advice – on everything from planting to spruce bark beetles."
