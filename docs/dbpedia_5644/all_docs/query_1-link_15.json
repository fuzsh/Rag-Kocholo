        "text": "Environmentally friendly labels that are sustainable both for our customers products and for our common future are a matter of utmost importance for us at Nordvalls. Our label experts know that many product developers and label customers are faced with the challenge of developing a label that is aesthetically pleasing, meets functional requirements, is within budget and at the same time contributes to sustainable development. An important part of our future work is to protect our environment through sustainable production and environmentally friendly labels.\n\nToday, Nordvalls offer many different materials that are simply divided into four environmentally friendly categories.\n\nRecycled material\n\nThere are several ways for you as a purchaser of label to contribute to a more sustainable world. At Nordvalls, we help companies that want to benefit from the concept of circular economy. By repurposing material of what has already been used and choose label materials with up to 30% recycled content, important resources such as water and electricity are saved while Co2 emissions are reduced.\n\nResponsible sources\n\nNordvalls is a FSC®-certified printing company, which means that we follow the FSC®’s (Forest Stewardship Council®) standards for forestry and traceability. As a purchaser of labels you can feel confident that the material comes from responsible sources who take both people and the environment into consideration.\n\nThinner material\n\nAn environmentally friendly label is good at using only the amount needed. It is cleverly designed and makes sure to use the material to the fullest while not using anything unnecessarily. In Nordvalls production, we aim to reduce waste, make room for more labels on the roll and more rolls in each box. Reduced material consumption produces less oil, water and energy, which leads to a reduced carbon dioxide footprint.\n\nSimplify recycling and reuse\n\nMaterial used to your products can be used again. Nordvalls helps you find a label that meets your goals while creating a high recycling possibility. Today’s consumers have even higher demands on both products and packaging, and the right choice of label affects how well it is possible to recycle the entire packaging. Nordvalls takes responsibility all the way to the end user and our label solutions support more efficient recycling.\n\nThe label is of importance and makes a difference. By choosing wisely, you can ensure that it makes a difference both for the product it is on, but also for the climate footprint it leaves behind. We help you integrate the label into your overall sustainability thinking."
