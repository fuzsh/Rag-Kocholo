        "text": "I inherited a forest\n\nI never wanted to come here always longed to get away.\n\nAs soon as I could I traveled out into the world and when I got home it wasnât voluntarily but reluctantly.\n\nBut my father died and I inherited a forest it drew me here again to the mountains, the colors and the shapes. Now I wonât come home reluctantly but voluntarily.\n\nStockholm was my world â and then it was Dorotea\n\nMy parents lived on ÃstgÃ¶tagatan on the island of SÃ¶dermalm in Stockholm when I was born. Thatâs where I learned to read and to dance ballet. Itâs where my friends were, my whole world.\n\nWhen I was eight years old, my parents took over the Dorotea hotel and restaurant, and we moved here, to my motherâs home turf. But I never wanted to come here; I never wanted to live here. In Dorotea, people called out, âYou and I are fourth cousins!â but I didnât know what that meant, and I didnât think the other kids at school knew anything at all.\n\nThey did, of course â much more than me â but not about what I thought was important.\n\nDorotea is so small that it had no upper secondary school. You had to drive to Vilhelmina, 70 km north â either round-trip, 140 km a day, or you stayed in town and went home on weekends. I moved to Vilhelmina when I began upper secondary school, and then to UmeÃ¥, Munich and Brighton before I attended Beckmans College of Design in Stockholm.\n\nMy sights were set outward: I was always going elsewhere, and even if I went home regularly, I never craved to come here.\n\nIf you drive off the road, it can be dangerous\n\nThe forest I inherited was divided into six forest plots, each one slightly different in character. One has water and fishing, and all are situated near the village of AvatrÃ¤sk, northwest of Dorotea.\n\nDorotea is in southern Lappland, north of the border between JÃ¤mtland and VÃ¤sterbotten counties, at the same latitude as SkellefteÃ¥, but much closer to the Norwegian coast than the Swedish one.\n\nThis municipality is rich with untouched nature â marshes, lakes, forests and mountains, but not many people. It isnât built up here, like it is in Ã re. Itâs wilder and more pure, but also harder to access.\n\nDriving from Stockholm can take eight to ten hours or more. If you fly to FrÃ¶sÃ¶n in Ãstersund then you can rent a car and drive two and a half hours north to Dorotea, plus another 15 minutes to AvatrÃ¤sk. Or you can fly to Vilhelmina ina teeny-tiny plane, rent a car, and drive an hour south to AvatrÃ¤sk.\n\nSometimes there are animals on the roads, which arenât always plowed, and sometimes there isnât a drop of light â itâs pure wilderness. If youâre coming from the south, the last toilet is in Ramsele. Then youâve got close to 100 km without anyone to help you. If you drive off the road, it can be dangerous.\n\nThen we moved even further north\n\nLater, my parents sold the Dorotea hotel and bought a farm with a lake and woods in AvatrÃ¤sk, a village with about 30 houses located northwest of Dorotea and even higher up in the mountain.\n\nI didnât realize it then, but when my father died, my mother was experiencing the onset of Alzheimerâs. I had to help her with everything â the farm, the woods, everything that has to be arranged when someone dies.\n\nThe farm consisted of a house, a machine hall, a big barn with a slaughterhouse and a bakerâs cottage. It gets unbelievably cold here in wintertime, so you canât just close up a building. All of the buildings need service if the electricity goes off and the pipes freeze, so someone has to be there the entire winter. I had to sell the farm.\n\nThe forest was nothing but trees to me\n\nTo me, the forest had only ever been a bunch of trees. I didnât see what I see now. I thought about selling that too initially, but I didnât want to be hasty, and maybe I didnât want to cut ties altogether. There were six forest plots and I didnât know what was expected to be done with them or how to care for them. There is a law that regulates how to care for forests, but I didnât even know where my forest was located or how to find it.\n\nHow was it for them that it wasnât for you?\n\nâThis is a tree that fell into the marsh. You can tell itâs been there a while, because itâs sunken down and overgrown.\n\nHow was it for them that you didnât want to live there?\n\nâIt really hurt them. None of us ever came to any understanding, not on my part or on theirs.\n\nI found a forest management plan\n\nI found a forest management plan among my fatherâs papers and understood that it covered what had been done, if they had planted or felled. Later, I remembered that they had said that about the forest: we went out and planted trees, but I never thought about what they meant and I never understood just how much forest it was.\n\nA few times, I went with my dad to the woods. He would point and say: hereâs a plot, and thereâs another one. In my world, you pick up a map and it shows you where the plots are, and then you get there by car or snowmobile and take a look. But he just said: itâs over there. I donât remember which trees he pointed to; it was really hard for me to understand.\n\nWe learned to read the woods\n\nI realized eventually that I was going to need help to care for the forest, that I had to hire a forest manager. First Andreas Hedberg, then Adrian Nilsson, both of whom are trained forest inspectors, went into the woods with me and my son Bruno, and showed us where the plots were and how to read the woods. They said that here a moose has rubbed up against the tree trunk, and there it has rested, and here the moose has recently passed by, and there you can tell it was a while ago.\n\nI donât know what my father thought\n\nWhat did your parents think of you becoming an internationally established designer?\n\nâI donât think they understood it. My father was a famous television chef. He sat on the Chef of the Year jury; he was established in that world and it was strange to him that I could be more established than he was. It wasnât necessarily positive.\n\nI had a complicated relationship with my father and I donât know what he thought about these woods why he didnât prepare me to take care of them. He never said what he thought about anything.\n\nI did what I did because I had to. I had to get out and get away.\n\nThey answered you in their way, gave you the forest and brought you back here. Could we say they were right?\n\nâMaybe so.\n\nI turned the forest into rugs\n\nâSweden is so big and the forest is a part of us. It is the origin for many, and an enormous source of our countryâs prosperity.\n\nI learned that there are many ways to own a forest, that you donât have to do everything they initially said.\n\nThe forest inspired me to create rugs, and it wasnât only the forest that taught me about the rugs â the rugs taught me about the forest, too.\n\nYou have to walk carefully\n\nItâs soft and squishy in the marsh, and when you walk you have to be careful not to step through and get your boot stuck. It will sink in even further, and you have to balance on tufts of marsh grass and hope you donât step the wrong way. The marsh grass grows mightily from a heavy base, forming these streams or strips that curve in different directions. They have a lovely movement when the wind takes hold of them.\n\nIâd say that the marsh is at its loveliest when covered in frost. Itâs like a sheer, delicate silver blanket has been spread over all the colors.\n\nThen the bottom water freezes, and you can walk on the marsh differently, so much more freely.\n\nI made the marsh into a rug. To me itâs about texture, evolution, movement, those changing colors â it looks like this right now, but in a week, maybe it will have snowed. The rug is composed of cut strands, and the color and texture change depending on how you walk.\n\nThrough the ravine to the mountain peak\n\nNow weâve reached northern BorgafjÃ¤ll, which is home to many mountains. One is BorgahÃ¤llan, which is so beautifully situated on BorgasjÃ¶n Lake, and which means so much to me.\n\nBorgahÃ¤llan is special to me because I climbed it with my friends so many times while growing up. You go up through the ravine, a crevice further to the right, where there was year-round snow when I was a child. The top has a view and a little lake that you can swim in, even though itâs cold.\n\nPeople live off the land here\n\nA lot of people live off the land up here, eating berries and mushrooms picked in the woods. They hunt grouse, small game and moose, and fish for trout and char in the river and lakes by boat in summer and through the ice the rest of the year. They live off timber from thinning and logging.\n\nI think we should listen more to the people who live off the land, and not just to what people who live in Stockholm or the EU think should be done in a forest.\n\nItâs only wilderness from here\n\nSannaren Lake is located more than 600 meters above sea level and this is the end of the road. You canât get any further by car, and there are no buildings, just untouched nature.\n\nIf youâre going further into the mountains, it has to be on foot. In winter, you can drive a snowmobile or be picked up by a pontoon plane or helicopter. From hereon out, itâs only wilderness.\n\nMy motherâs family, a rug and a tapestry of heather\n\nMy mother has many relatives up here. They were farmers; they fished and worked the land and woods. They made handicrafts â bowls out of tree limbs, furniture, instruments, all with a beautiful feel. My grandfather often played the fiddle at parties. It was the culture of Norrland, probably with Sami roots.\n\nHeather grows in the mountains and woods, and has also become a rug. Being able to experiment has been important to me. Helene Ogeborg and I visited the factory in Portugal. When we were there, we saw how it looks when the yarn gets caught in the machine, causing it to stop and run in one place. It was beautiful, so we applied that to a bigger rug and a small tapestry.\n\nThe error was intentionally programmed so that the machine would do it again. It creates a lovely texture, and the combination of glossy and matte threads results in a shimmering quality, reminding of heather.\n\nI was angry with him, but not her\n\nI am angry with him, because I think he could have prepared me better.\n\nI could have been mad at her too, but she wasnât the one in charge of the forest. It was a conservative environment.\n\nShe took care of everything at home and he took care of everything on the farm.\n\nI wonder if she knew where the plots were.\n\nI think she just went with him in the car.\n\nThe significance of owning land\n\nMy fatherâs family had a farm with a lot of land in what is now the Czech Republic. After the war, everything was taken from them. One Christmas Eve, Russian soldiers came and said they had to leave. Thereâs a lot we never talked about, things he carried that I donât know much about.\n\nMy motherâs parents also had a lot of land, but of eleven children, only one inherited the forest, and it wasnât the eldest son.\n\nWhat do I know about the feelings that stirred up? Almost nothing, but there are surely more reasons why owning land meant so much to both of them.\n\nHe managed everything there was to manage here\n\nMy father hunted, fished and managed everything there was to manage here, but he didnât have a lot of access to his emotions.\n\nHe came to Sweden as a âmÃ¢itre pÃ¢tissier,â a master pastry chef. He was on his way to Greenland when he met my mother, got a job at the Grand HÃ´tel and Werner VÃ¶geli took him to OperakÃ¤llaren. Later, he managed the restaurantat Hotell Foresta on LidingÃ¶.\n\nWhen he and my mother were going to start their own business, they had two choices: a hotel in Gambia and one in Dorotea. Someone else got Gambia, but Dorotea was perfect for him; he fit into this setting.\n\nItâs easy to get lost\n\nThe weather can change in a matter of minutes in the mountains â itâs like being at sea, but even more dramatic.\n\nThe crosses are there to keep you from getting lost in winter, when visibility can suddenly be so poor that you canât see more than a few meters ahead of you.\n\nWhen you live here, you learn to have great respect for nature.\n\nI didnât know I knew\n\nWhen I was growing up, my mother and father went into the woods all the time. They picked berries and mushrooms, went fishing and hunting â they did everything in nature, while I waited in the car, reading books.\n\nI didnât want to go out into nature. That desire came much later for me.\n\nStill, I knew the names of plants here that I didnât realize I remembered. I was raised on hunted grouse; that was everyday food for me. But it would be a while before I would realize that all of this is mine, that I belong here too, that I know the words for the things that grow and live here.\n\nI knew much more than I realized.\n\nNature doesnât need us â we need nature\n\nThe forest and mountains donât need us; whether or not we are here, they are steadfastly there, if not more so without us.\n\nThereâs so much power in nature, and I like that all of this just continues without us.\n\nWeâre living in a time when so much is about the environment and sustainability. Thatâs a good thing, but I think aesthetics has had to take a step back, and weâre forgetting the importance of beauty to our well-being.\n\nWhy do we go into the woods and up into the mountains? Why do we sit and behold the ocean? What does it mean for us as people?\n\nTo me, the rugs have been a way to come closer to that, and I think this is the beginning of an artistic exploration that has the potential to become much more.\n\nWhen he inherits, he wonât be unprepared\n\nNow weâve reached the end of the KorpÃ¥n river, between BorgafjÃ¤ll and AvatrÃ¤sk.\n\nMy son visited my parents often when he was a child, at least one week every summer. He really liked them. Being here was easier for him, maybe because he wasnât stuck, and they were in a better place than they were when I was a child.\n\nIt means so much to me that heâs wanted to be part of this, that he wants to learn about the forest.\n\nItâs his forest too, and when Bruno takes over one day, he wonât be unprepared.\n\nOgeborg\n\nTimeless carpets in sustainable materials, carefully selected yarns, skilled craftsmanship, established designers, lowest possible climate footprint and a company with a long family tradition.\n\nThe rugs in this catalog are made by Ogeborg â a company that is also a story of parents, childhood and heritage.\n\nFor 20 years, Helene Ogeborg has been CEO of the carpet company that was founded in 1963 by her father Paul Ogeborg, and in which her motherG ull-Britt Ogeborg soon also worked with the company.\n\nIn the first years, Ogeborg was run from home from at the kitchen table, and during the upbringing of Helene and her brother Jan â the whole family was involved. The focus was high-quality carpets for private and public environments, and when Jan Ogeborg became CEO in the 1990s, he brought a contemporary and innovative focus on the environment.\n\nAn important decision was to operate in Europe to ensure good working conditions, non-toxic manufacturing and reduced transport footprint.\n\nWhen Helene Ogeborg took over in 2003, high quality and durability were still a matter of course, and to that she has added a strong design orientation with her sense for the expressive.\n\nIt includes collaborations with designers such as Axel BjurstrÃ¶m, Claesson Koivisto Rune, Josefin Tolstoy, Sundling KickÃ©n, Alexander Lervik, Tekla Evelina Severin, Luca Nichetto and Note Design Studio.\n\nIn addition to hand-tufted and hand-woven carpets, the range includes all types of textile floors as well as leather, cork and quartz stone.\n\nOver the years, Ogeborg has received several design prizes and awards, including the âGermanDesign Award 2018,â âResidence Grand Design Award 2019 â Accessory of the year,â and âPlaza InteriÃ¶râs Honorary Award 2022 â On the floor.â"
