        "text": "Hello! My name is Patric and I am a professional guitarist from Stockholm, Sweden. I would love to record any electric or acoustic guitar tracks for your songs.\n\nI provide clients around the world with high quality acoustic and electric guitar tracks from my professional studio in Stockholm, Sweden. All I need is an mp3 or wav of your song with any instruction and I will deliver tracks to you within a few short days! I also play mandolin, Lap steel and electric bass.\n\nThere's nothing I enjoy more than communicating with artists and songwriters, taking the music to the next level. I use my collection of vintage guitars, amps, but also modern gear and my favorite plug-ins. My goal is to make your track as great as it can be!\n\nI have extensive experience from 20 years of live and studio work, a large number of tracks recorded for various artists in the \"Eurovision Song Contest\", experience in film scoring (composing and recording),also a Berklee alumni.\n\nI'd love to hear about your project. Click the 'Contact' button above to get in touch.\n\nTell me about your project and how I can help, through the 'Contact' button above."
