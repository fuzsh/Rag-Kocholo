        "text": "Analysis of chip quality and value at Norske Skog Pisa Mill, Brazil.\n\nThese decisions enabled a long-term market for LBG in the region.The municipality of Levanger where Norske Skog Skogn is located was very much in favour of the biogas plant and also functioned as an important enabler.As a result of the collaboration, Biokraft will process waste water from the pulp and paper plant, which is a mixture of biological sludge and water.\n\nNorske Skog has been highly specialised in the production of newspaper paper and its first newspaper paper plant opened inSkogn in 1966.\n\nAfter processing the waste water together with the fish residues, Biokraft delivers water back to Norske Skog Skogn.\n\nNorske Skog uses bark as an input for thermal energy in the production of newsprint paper and the plant recycles newspaper paper in the production of its newsprint paper.\n\nA small embedded geothermal generator was installed in 1966 and was finally replaced by Norske Skog Tasman in 2005.\n\nNorske Skog Skogn and Biokraft planned to exploit rest resources from pulp and paper production together with the rest resources from salmon aquaculture (category 2) in order to produce biogas and upgrade it to lique- fied biogas (LBG).\n\nNorske Skog Skogn has been able to survive demand swings and financial turmoil because of process innovations, without moving away from paper as a core product.\n\nSeveral of the pulp and paper plants had to be closed, but the one in Skogn has remained open in Norway, with three paper machines in operation.While the mother company has declared bankruptcy, both Norske Skog Skogn and the other Norwegian plant, Norske Skog Saugbrugs AS in Halden, which specialises in magazine paper, are still in business; indeed they are earning steady incomes and do not fear for the future because of increased demand.\n\nOver the years Norske Skog put all its efforts into becoming the worldâ€™s leading paper producer, acquiring many foreign pulp and paper mills globally and consequently losing a great deal of its economic power as a result of a globally diminished demand for paper."
