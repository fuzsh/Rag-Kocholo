The brief was to make the cover express the fear and terror of the abused. Illustrated so that you are experiencing the abuser from the point of view of a child.\n\nHow was the illustration used:\n\nFor the cover of G2 on Thursday the 28th of June 2018\n\nHow did you make this work:\n\nMy approach to this brief was to make the cover dark and unpleasant. I used a texture brush I made in photoshop, to create the dark texture in the back. I used the same brush to create the light source in the left bottom corner. The light source represents the hope or the moving on that is adressed in the article.\n\nCommissioner Name :\n\nThe Guardian, art director Sarah Habershon\n\nCommissioner Company :\n\nThe Guardian\n\nSocial Media:\n\ninstagram.com/alva.skog/\n\nPersonal Website:\n\nalvaskog.com\n\nAgent Website:\n\nhttps://www.jellylondon.com\n\nYear of Graduation:\n\n2018\n\nBiography:\n\nI am a Swedish illustrator based in London, UK. In 2018 I graduated with a bachelor in graphic design from Central Saint Martins. Clients I have worked with include Apple, The Guardian and The New York Times."
