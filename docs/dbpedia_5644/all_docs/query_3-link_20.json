        "text": "Young Guns\n\nYoung Guns is a portfolio competition awarding creative professionals 30 years and under, including designers, illustrators, entrepreneurs, and more!\n\n2019: In a year that could arguably be described as the most diverse class in Young Guns history, a jury of more than 60 respected creatives — half of them past Young Guns winners themselves — spent two months reviewing hundreds of submissions from a record 45 different countries.\n\nAfter several rounds of judging, which narrowed down the vast pool of talent to a finalist list of 81 creatives, the jury debated, discussed and ultimately selected 28 superstars to be part of Young Guns 17. This year's class runs across a wide variety of disciplines, and with only three YG17 winners being American-born, the global nature of this accolade is becoming even greater."
