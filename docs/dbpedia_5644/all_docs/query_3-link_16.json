        "text": "General Order & Product Information\n\nWhen will my order ship?\n\nOur goal is to process and ship all orders within 48 hrs. Please note for orders placed after 2pm EST on a Friday will begin processing the following Monday morning.\n\nCan I cancel or make changes to my order?\n\nWe process and ship all orders as quickly as possible. Please contact us as soon as possible if you need to modify or cancel your order. We are unable to cancel or modify orders once they have been processed for shipping.\n\nWhat's your return policy?\n\nLove S.Å.K or your money back! You have 30 days to return your item if it is in the original, unused condition. For details on initiating a return, head to our returns page.\n\nWhat sort of warranty/guarantee do you offer on your products?\n\nWe warrant our products against any defects in materials and workmanship for the intended life of the product under normal use. For more information please visit our warranty page.\n\nI have not received my order, what should I do?\n\nThe first step is to check your tracking information. You should have received an email from us as when your order shipped. That email will contain the relevant tracking information. If you didn’t receive that email, please contact us with your order information and we can help you track it down.\n\nIf the tracking shows as delivered, but you never got the package, you will have to pursue a claim with the carrier. We are not responsible for customer data entry errors regarding shipping or delivery instructions.\n\nThe product or variation I want is out of stock, when will it be available?\n\nIf a product is out of stock, you can enter your email address and be notified as soon as that product is back in stock. Simply enter your email address in the notification box after you select the product and size/color you would like to purchase. Once that product is available you will receive an email letting you know.\n\nHow do I place a bulk/wholesale order?\n\nPlease see our wholesale inquiries page or contact us for bulk pricing.\n\nDo you offer customized products? Can get my organization’s logo printed on your products?\n\nYes! We would be happy to work with you to customize our products to fit your organization’s needs. Please contact us for more information about available options, minimum order quantities and pricing.\n\nWhat’s with the name? What does it mean?\n\nSkog Å Kust is Swedish for “forest, creek, coast” representing the range of natural environments for which our products are designed and intended.\n\nWhere is your company based, where are your products manufactured?\n\nWe are a small family owned and operated company based in Pennsylvania, USA. When you contact us you will get a response one of the members of our US based team. All of our orders ship from our US based warehouse. Our products are designed/tested in the USA, and manufactured in China.\n\nProduct Use & Care\n\nWill the bag float?\n\nMost of our products will float if they fall into the water. To help keep them buoyant, we recommend leaving some extra air in the bag when you seal it. Please note our roll-down style bags are not intended to be used under water, or as a life saving device, but are rated for brief shallow submersions (if they were dropped off of a boat or capsized kayak, for example).\n\nWhat will each bag/size fit?\n\nPlease see our sizing information under the technical specifications. If you have questions about specific items fitting in a particular bag you can always contact us.\n\nHow do I clean my bags?\n\nCleaning our bags are very simple: you can remove most dirt simply with warm water and a non-detergent soap. It’s best to wash your them by hand. If they’re really dirty, you can hose them out first. Once you’ve hand washed your bags, leave them to air-dry. Make sure they’re completely dry before you store them as damp fabrics are subject to mildew.\n\nIf you are using your bags in desert/beach conditions, clean the teeth of your zippered pockets after use. Even though zippers are rust proof, if they are exposed to salt they should be washed with fresh water after use to avoid any salt build up. We recommend using zipper lubricant on all zippers before long term storage.\n\nWhat sort of chemicals should I avoid contact with?\n\nDEET from bug sprays will dissolve polyurethane, so be aware of this and keep them away from our PVC based bags.\n\nGasoline/mineral oil will also delaminate coatings and remove water-repellent finishes. Alcohol (the kind found in spray sunscreen and in iodine water treatments) is also bad, so avoid spraying these types of products directly on your bags.\n\nThe sun’s ultraviolet light can weaken the fabrics over time: the lighter the fabric, the more pronounced the effect. Keeping your gear out of the sunlight whenever possible will help it to last longer."
