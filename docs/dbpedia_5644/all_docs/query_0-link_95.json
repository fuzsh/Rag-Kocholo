        "text": "From: Dead Rheteric\n\nPublished: March 6, 2019\n\nEveryone’s favorite caveat to ‘atmospheric black metal’: depressive black metal.\n\nI stumbled onto NONE thanks to their first album, 2017’s self-titled NONE, largely thanks to its album cover: a fog-drenched and snowed-over oblivion, presumably somewhere in the Pacific Northwest (the band hails from Portland, Oregon). Its three tracks are a dense foray into the miserable, a proper sonic accompaniment to the album’s cover art. I fo...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Grizzly Butts\n\nPublished: November 25, 2018\n\nPortland, Oregon atmospheric/depressive black metal duo None have an exceptional sense of ‘depth’ within sonic landscape; The best proof of this is in the guitar tones and layering therein where the scraping buzz of distortion never outshines or grates upon the listener. For music appearing as personal expression and release the expected value is a pointed but not exploitative catharsis. ‘Life Has Gone On Long Enough’ wrings ...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Cadaver Garden\n\nPublished: November 25, 2018\n\nThrough eight tracks of soul crushing melancholy, NONE creates an ultimately devastating sound that wraps you up in dismal hymns. Life Has Gone On Long Enough is pure depressive black metal in its most raw and powerful form as it provides you with track after track of bone chilling black metal. From beginning to end you are subject to the cold and ever biting atmospheres that NONE provides only for them to wrap you up in a solemn fo...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Infernal Masquerade Magazine\n\nPublished: July 25, 2018\n\nMaking justice to such a bleak title, today we have NONE’s sophomore release. Featuring over 50 minutes of the most demoralizing and gut wrenching music you will ever hear, “Life Has Gone On Long Enough” is a brutally emotional Atmospheric Black Metal release that any fan of Austere, Lifelover, Mortualia, etc. cannot miss.\n\nAfter a moody opener, “A World, Dead and Gray” kicks off with crushingly dissonant guitars a...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Metal Purgatory\n\nPublished: May 14, 2018\n\nI do not know what it is about the depressive black metal scene lately but new albums pop up almost daily and a lot of these bands are making some solid releases. One of these bands is Portland, Oregon’s None which blends a unique mix of both atmospheric and depressive black metal. Life Has Gone On Long Enough is the second album by None, released this year through Hypnotic Dirge Records. The album features eight tracks of organic ble...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: The Headbanging Moose\n\nPublished: May 14, 2018\n\nWritten and recorded throughout the latter half of 2017, Life Has Gone On Long Enough, the brand new album by American Atmospheric/Depressive Black Metal entity NONE, takes its haunting shape through eight organic tracks of foggy mountainous atmosphere and bleak music. On this new chapter, NONE delves deeper into the blackest woods to find abandonment, and developing its tortured personality further. Moving in and out like the lon...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Ave Noctum Webzine\n\nPublished: May 14, 2018\n\nAint that album title the truth? Well it must feel like that to everyone at some point and None as their name suggests have probably not got the best outlook on life and are here making music and at least, even if it is in a negative respect, doing something worthwhile before they shuffle off this mortal coil. Not that we have any inkling of who the band are, nothing more is known than when they released their debut ‘None’ back i...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Kaje Music\n\nPublished: May 10, 2018\n\nEven on a hot spring day the second full length Life Has Gone On Long Enough from Portland’s NONE can make you feel cold. Fuzzy distortion and depressive vocals lure you into the bleak world of misery and grief and swallow you. You can feel yourself being sucked into a desolate wasteland and caressed by a shroud of doom. The slow and steady march into the darkness of your own thoughts ushered by the anguished screams that surround you for...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Merchants of Air\n\nPublished: April 30, 2018\n\nLife has gone on long enough is the most recent album by Cascadian black metal project None. An extensive record, fifty two minutes and a half long, it has eight tracks: Bleak, damp, and dead, A world, dead and gray, Bed the cold earth, Hypoxic, Corroded, Desiderate, Life is long enough and Illa Tiðandi. A more conventional atmospheric black metal record, permeated with the intuitive lucidity of slow harmonies, the album has a stro...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: ItDjents\n\nPublished: April 29, 2018\n\nOregon based duo NONE return with their sophomore full length record after dropping their fantastic self-titled debut just last year. Once again built around the structural mainframe of atmospheric black metal, NONE experiment with post-rock and doom elements in crafting the sophomore record Life Has Gone On Long Enough.\n\nWith the self-titled debut, NONE had already shown the world that they were the masters of crafting long, epic tracks that ...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Valley of Steel\n\nPublished: April 12, 2018\n\nYesterday, Hypnotic Dirge released the second album by None. The label describes them as a “two-piece Depressive Black Metal entity from the Pacific Northwest.” Digging a bit further reveals that they are in fact from the northwestern USA (to avoid confusion since the label itself is from Canada). And that is literally all we’ve been able to uncover, as “none” also accurately describes how much of an online presence this b...\n\nContinue reading ...\n\nFrom: Metal Injection\n\nPublished: April 10, 2018\n\nExpectations can be a prickly thing. When NONE's Life has gone on long enough was first previewed over at Invisible Oranges, I was genuinely enraptured. Lead single \"Bed the cold earth\" was a somber, contemplative, and suitably desolate experience. If that were a sign of things to come, NONE's sophomore record could've been a modern black metal gem. The music was appropriately thin and chilling but offered just enough melody and ambia...\n\nContinue reading ..."
