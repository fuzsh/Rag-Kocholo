        "text": "The surname Skog was first found in Peebles-shire in the lands of Stobo in Scotland where they held a family seat at Scrogges from the 12th century. 4 5 \"Robert de Scrogges lost his life in the service of David de Lyne, and because of that his son Simon had a grant of the lands of Scrogges, c. 1208, from David de Line, and a few years later he sold the lands to Walter, bishop of Glasgow.\" 6\n\nSome of the family were found further south in England where Thomas Scrag was listed in Yorkshire as a Knights Templar in 1185. The Pipe Rolls for Wiltshire included an entry for Osebert Scragg in 1218. 2"
