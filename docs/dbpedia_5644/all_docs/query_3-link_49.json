        "text": "United States Attorney Gregory G. Brooker today announced an indictment charging BARRY RON SKOG, 67, with five counts of sale of counterfeit coins and one count of mail fraud. The defendant made his initial appearance earlier today before Magistrate Judge Franklin L. Noel in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nAccording to the indictment, from June 2012 through October 2016, SKOG devised a scheme to advertise and sell counterfeit coins by fraudulently representing that the coins were legitimate U.S. coins worth hundreds of dollars.\n\nAccording to the indictment, SKOG owned and operated a business called Burnsville Coin Company and through his business, he posted advertisements for coins in a publication called Numismatic News. When victims responded to the ads, SKOG would mail them lists of available coins for purchase, many of which were counterfeit. In his communications with the victims, SKOG would often represent himself as an employee of the Burnsville Coin Company named “Ron Peterson,” when, in fact, there are no other owners or employees of the company other than SKOG. In total, SKOG fraudulently obtained more than $80,000 from his victims.\n\nThis case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Minnesota Commerce Fraud Bureau and the Burnsville Police Department.\n\nBased on the evidence obtained in this case, authorities believe there may be additional victims who have not yet been identified. Anyone with information about this matter is encouraged to call the Minnesota Commerce Fraud Bureau at 651-539-1617. Callers may remain anonymous.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Manda M. Sertich is prosecuting the case.\n\nDefendant Information:\n\nBARRY RON SKOG, 67\n\nBurnsville, Minn.\n\nCharges:\n\nSale of counterfeit coins, 5 counts\n\nMail fraud, 1 count"
