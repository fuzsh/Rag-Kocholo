SKOG art space is not a gallery, not a studio, not a collection, but something unique in between. SKOG will have exhibitions regularly. SKOG means FOREST in Norwegian.

Our aim is to create a vibrant and unconventional art space in Oslo's East End for people living in Oslo and abroad.

At SKOG you will discover the undiscovered: Established and new artists, young and old, used and new objects. We promise to exhibit collections made by innovative artists, traditional creators and to give you different experiences.

SKOG takes you into a forest of new experiences, objects and art. At SKOG, no work is too old, too young or unimportant. As in the forest, you will discover objects we have brought with us on our way back home. Objects that are beautiful, curious, eternal or perishable - just like nature.
