Due to some recent (and ongoing) issues with the phrase "Ranger Bands", we're experimenting with the name "Skog Bands" for our American-made EPDM Ranger Bands. Skog is a Norwegian and Swedish word that means "Forest", but it also looks like it should be an acronym for something. What can you guys come up with for S.K.O.G.?

This thread will be a giveaway, and the recipient will get a Gibson Pinch Knife from ESEE Knives. This little 1095 carbon steel knife is designed for inclusion in survival kits, and comes with a magnetic sheath. It's a cool little knife. You can check it out here in our store.

Recipient will be chosen by random number generator. Simply reply to this thread by suggesting what SKOG stands for to be considered for the giveaway.

By making a suggestion, you agree to surrender all rights to the suggested acronym to 5col Survival Supply. We have no further obligation to you, nor you to us. We are not obligated to use any of the acronyms suggested.
