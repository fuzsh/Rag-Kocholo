*I am always accepting new OB patients and newborns*

Dr. Skog has interests in maternal and child health, lactation, reproductive health, family planning, gender affirming care and chronic disease management.

"I chose to practice Family Medicine because I love taking care of people from birth to their 100th (and beyond!) birthday." Dr. Skog particularly loves providing obstetric care and continuing to provide longitudinal care to the entire family. As a certified lactation consultant as well, Dr. Skog can help manage lactation support postpartum.

Dr. Skog is passionate about family medicine. She believes a holistic approach to patient care is essential to keeping patients happy and healthy. She believes providing excellent primary care is the best way to assure patients get the most out of life no matter where they are in their journey.

When she is not in the hospital or clinic, Dr. Skog enjoys running after two busy young children with her husband, watching plants grow in their garden and raising chickens. She loves to bike, hike and enjoy the culinary wonders of Portland. When time allows, she and her family love to travel abroad and experience different cultures.

Before scheduling your appointment, we recommend you contact your insurance company to verify that the OHSU Health location or provider you plan to visit is included in your network. Your insurance company will also be able to inform you of any copayments, coâ€“insurance, or deductibles that will be your responsibility. If you proceed in scheduling an appointment and your health insurance benefits do not participate with OHSU providers, your out of pocket liability may be higher.
