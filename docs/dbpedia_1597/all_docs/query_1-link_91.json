        "text": "Mediums: oil, canvas.\n\nLocation: The Cadaqués Art Museum (Girona) (Spain).\n\nThe most uncomplicated plot by the Spanish master turns into a picture full of mysteries as if invoking thoughts. All the objects in the composition are recognizable, except the sea; usually, Planells depicted it as calm and smooth, but here it makes small waves. Perhaps, here is the key to the meaning of this picture: we lock our desires, and they excite us even more. The sharpened pencil miraculously held on the edge of a solid table and a ring in the form of a snake on a gloved hand evoke other thoughts. Moreover, each item is not surprising – they are real, like in a photo."
