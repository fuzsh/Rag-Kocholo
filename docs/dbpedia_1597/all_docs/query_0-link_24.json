        "text": "I am glad to attend the webinar from Protein Foods and Nutrition Development Association of India (PFNDAI) and IFF on Plant Based Proteins: The Canvas for Innovation: 17th May 2024. The webinar underscored the multifaceted significance of plant-based proteins, emphasizing not only their role in addressing food insecurity and population growth but also their impact on our health, advocating for a shift towards a more vegetarian diet. l extend my sincere gratitude to all the panelists and esteemed speakers for their invaluable contributions to this exceptional session. #nutrition #plantbaseddiet #vegetarian #foodinsecurity #pfndai #diet #holisticlife #health #dietitics #foodindustries .\n\nDid you know that, as per the Pakistan Protein Perception Study, there is high awareness of non-vegetarian protein foods, but limited awareness of plant-based proteins? Here are some of the reasons to ponder upon: 1. Livestock is considered a central component of the agricultural sector in Pakistan 2. Traditional Pakistani cuisine often includes meat, contributing to familiarity with non-vegetarian protein options 3. Limited exposure and promotion of plant-based diets These are some of the factors that contribute to the lower awareness of plant-based protein foods as compared to animal-based protein foods.

They are 36 to 44-year olds, who eat a lot of conventional #meat. * Who are less likely to try or regularly consume #plantbasedmeat alternatives are Skeptics. They consume animal #meat least frequently. This data was consistent across Southeast Asia (SEA) and it indicates that the population in SEA is looking for #proteindiversity rather than #meat replacement.

It's incredible to see all the places across the country (including Alaska & Hawaii) and throughout Canada where people are ordering from too!! To experience Ruvi going from a big idea that can be a solution to the world problem of fruit & veggie deficiency, that's plagued almost everyone's health for generations (only 9/10 people eat their daily recommend servings), to seeing so many people in so many places transforming thier health through the basic powers of more fruits & veggies in thier diet is nothing short of amazing. If you haven't experienced the life changing effect of Ruvi yet, there's no better time than now start feeling your best in as little as 30 seconds a day! If you know someone who could use Ruvi in their life too, let's get shipping to them as well! Looking forward to seeing these stacks of orders continue to grow and ship to even more places around the country and the world! Let's do this!! üôåüèΩ #utah #utahbusiness #startup #utahcompany #business #wholefood #nutrition #betterforyou #healthyeating #healthylifestle #fruitsandveggies #healthyliving #simplenutrition #easynutrition #eatgoodfeelgood\n\nTraditional Herbal Medicine Around Us: Goat's Cheese Goats produce high-quality, nutrition-rich milk in even the most difficult environments making them valuable to arid or mountainous areas where cows and sheep can‚Äôt survive. Goats were one of the earliest animals domesticated to suit human needs - more specifically milk production- going back to 8,000 B.C., 10,000 years ago. Goat cheese has been made at least as far back as 5,000 B.C. Meanwhile, the first documented proof of humans making cheese is 7,500 years ago in Poland. #OrientalMedicine #GoatsCheeseBenefits #TraditionalHealing #HolisticHealth #NaturalRemedies #Nutrition #WellnessJourney #DairyBenefits #HealthyLiving #EasternMedicine #MindBodySpirit #FoodAsMedicine #AlternativeMedicine #GoatMilk #GoatCheeseWisdom #GoatMilkMagic #GoatDairy #OrientalNutrition #GoatMilkElixir #HealingFoods #GoatCheeseRecipes #AncientWisdom #NatureHeals #HealthyEating #NutrientRich\n\nA recent survey commissioned by @GFI APAC has determined that Southeast Asian #consumers : * Who try and regularly consume #plantbasedmeat alternatives are Enthusiasts.
