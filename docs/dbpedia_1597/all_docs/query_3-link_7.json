Remember that change begins with you and your effort. No one can do it for you.\n\nCONFESSION: I like using Facebook, YouTube, & Instagram. I feel like it's a great way to connect with people outside my normal circles and pursue hobbies that are, shall I say, a little less controversial than what I typically share. When it was available, I auto-syndicated YouTube content to Rumble when it was allowed (no longer). I just spent some time clearing out all the videos and will be uploading them to my Rumble channel from now on. It's yet another place to post and I'll be honest, the site/app is clunky. It simply cannot keep up with YouTube‚Äôs updates or technology. Rumble videos aren‚Äôt going to be at the top of major search engine results either. The reach potential is less and it's why I haven‚Äôt focused on it. The fact that it might be the only place to post certain types of content in the future thanks to ‚Äúcommunity standards,‚Äù policies and political motivation makes me sad. For sites that are supposed hubs for connection, they are becoming more and more cliquey and discriminatory. Here‚Äôs a link to my first video on Rumble - a 60-second look at who I am and what I do. Let me know what you think and if you Rumble, please consider following me there too. https://lnkd.in/gdjAFscT\n\nThe Biggest Powerline Pre-Launch of 2024 Just Started Dear Prospects I'd like to invite you to the Biggest Pre-Launch Platform that you can ethically make income even without referring a single person. 1- Make daily income by simply Watching Ads. 2- Create your account to position yourself soonest possible on our global powerline and benefit from the spillovers of the thousands registering after you 3- Expose your primary opportunity to thousands of individuals who are the perfect targeted audience, with an extremely low fee https://lnkd.in/egdPs5xz Simply watch just the 1st minute of the CEO's video below, and you will understand that there has never been anything in the industry so transparent and simple to prosper: ‚óè Business Promotion Global Premier Officially Launches on July 1st, 2024 at 10PM UK Time.

Regards, Paul Thompson .\n\nI set a goal for Q4 that felt like a long shot... üòë But it DID look simple on paper... Hit 1k followers on LinkedIn. Today, tears came to my eyes when I looked at my account. After a 10-day holiday hiatus, I've officially hit 1400... üéâ A 40% outperformance of my STRETCH goal for this quarter. The first thing that comes to my mind is an EXPLOSIVE thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. To every person who has listened to me. To every person who has encouraged me. To every person who has asked for my advice. To every person that has told me that what I share here matters. I know that 1400 isn't all that big of a number... But the quality of connection I have here is EXACTLY what I wanted. And at the start of 2023, I was... ‚û° Lost for ideas ‚û° Too scared to show up ‚û° And deleting at least half of my own posts and comments But when I sat down on a call with James Martin... He told me that the only thing in my way was myself. And truer words have never been spoken. (Thanks for that, friend! üòÅ) So if Q1 me sounds a lot like you... I'd like to echo that message... And urge you to stop second guessing yourself. üí° Your perspective, ideas, and opinions matter üí° You'll only get better through a whole lot of practice üí° And there's no better time than today to get started Just think where you could be in nine months. (The sky is the limit.) üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ\n\nSummer is almost over. What did you do with it? This summer, I: - Finished a full gym routine for 3 solid months (Started in May). - Sighted in my rifle for deer season (look out Bambi). - Started a new exercise program. - Kicked butt at work. I built all this awesome stuff I can't tell you about üòÇ - Spent a lot of time with family. - Got my 2 mile run time back down to 15:30. - Learned 4 new kicks. - Discovered new music - Looked at like 5 houses to buy - Screwed up buying a house and blew like $5000 on it (and learned why you should never try to buy a house with an HOA). - Tried StarLink - Wrote a lot in my journal Did you guys accomplish anything or did everyone just spam crap on Linkedin for like 3 months straight?"
