        "text": "Charlene here! The first time I tried blenderized feeds was in a tube fed child who was tolerating nothing. His quality of life was awful. He was vomiting SO MUCH. And it didn't matter what we tried, different formulas, different rates, bolus, continuous, a combination of both ... nothing helped. I remember walking into the home and you could smell the vomit. If you've ever done home visits for tube fed patients, you know the smell 🤢 Blenderized feeds were our last resort. I had a rough template of what to do that someone had shared with me and with the blessing of the family, we just went for it. And it worked. It was life changing. This little guy did so well. From that point on, blenderized feeds were never my last resort. They became my go-to. But thinking back to what I had as a starting point, if I had felt more comfortable with blenderized feeds, if I hadn't felt like I was totally winging it ... I would have tried this MUCH sooner. Which brings us to Hilarie Geurink, RD, CSP (Hilarie Dreyer) Hilarie is a dietitian with a private practice dedicated to using real foods in tube feedings. If only I'd had access to someone like Hilarie back in the day! We're pumped to have Hilarie a speaker in our upcoming Pediatric Enteral Nutrition Series. Early Bird deadline is May 21st @ 4pm! Pending approval for 6 CPEUs with CDR. Here is your link with all the details: https://lnkd.in/esw2Nqu7\n\nAttached is a link to a webinar that I am a guest speaker at which is hosted by South Florida Association of Dietetics and Nutrition on 10/28 at 9 AM (CDT). Sneak Peak: “I hear a lot of dietitians say ‘I can lead someone to the watering hole but I can’t force them to drink.’ I do not think we are supposed to lead people to a watering hole and force them to drink. That’s not the point. The point is to empower to choose the watering hole, then walk with them to go take a drink. 🫴 💦 This means establishing a line of trust, and breaking up with the idea that you are not the sole authority of their destiny, but the client the authority. You (the dietitian) are there to be with them though the journey. sign-up below!
