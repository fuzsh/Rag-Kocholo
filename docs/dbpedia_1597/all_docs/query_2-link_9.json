        "text": "This is the latest post in our “Meet the Board” series. Each Monday, we’ll feature one of our 2017-18 board members, not stopping until we run out of board members (in late January).\n\nAngel Planells, MS, RDN\n\nPresident\n\nI’m a clinical dietitian with the Home Based Primary Care program at VA Puget Sound, and owner of ACP Nutrition, a private practice and consulting firm. I am currently serving as a media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, and also am the president-elect for the Washington State Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics. In 2016, I received multiple accolades: Today’s Dietitian TD10 for 2016 (with Chris Vogliano, legislative chair), Clinical Nutrition Practice award from the Veterans Health Administration, and Outstanding Dietitian of the year for Washington State. I’ve coached youth soccer for the past 18 years and am currently the development director at Emerald City Football Club. My family (wife – Danielle, son – Matteo (8), and daughter – Mina (4)) and I have enjoyed residing in the Emerald City after moving from the Big Apple in 2011. Here’s more about me:\n\nFavorite meal: I have many favorite foods, but I think my favorite is Korean BBQ. The flavors are delicious and you just want to keep eating. Rice, lettuce, cucumbers, carrots, Kimchi, and grilled kalbi – I’m salivating thinking about it.\n\nFavorite form of physical activity: I really enjoy hiking with my wife, kids, and dog. I wish we could do it more often (with our hectic schedules and lifestyles), but when we have free time, you will usually catch us somewhere in the mountains or along the water hiking.\n\nFavorite travel destination: I enjoy traveling so this is going to be difficult to pinpoint my favorite travel destination. In the states, it’s going to be funny that we live here and I enjoy visiting the four corners of the country – I love Maine for it’s beauty, I love California for the diversity in landscapes, and I love Miami because it was my favorite place to visit as a kid. Internationally, I love going to Switzerland for the sights, the sounds, and the double and triple cream.\n\nFavorite food city: I am going to have to pick 2 cities as my favorite…\n\nNew Orleans, LA. My birthplace and childhood home – I love the diversity of tastes and flavors. Many people try to replicate it but they can’t.\n\nNew York City. I lived here for 9 years, and it truly is the crossroads of the world. So many options, and so little time.\n\nFavorite hobby: I have coached soccer for 19 years (boys and girls, from 3 years old up to college Division I players.) I was blessed to have some great coaches, and feel this is a great way to stay connected and give back. Amazingly, some of the kids I coached now have their own kids. I also am proud that a number of my former players have played in college, on the US Youth national team, or playing professionally in the United States or overseas."
