        "text": "My path into the health and wellness world began during my sophomore year (spring of 1999) at Tulane University. I was doing well in my engineering courses, but felt that I needed more interaction with people. After meeting the chairperson for the Exercise and Sports Sciences department, I immediately made a switch to the this major. This was an amazing fit for me - I played many sports as a youth, was still involved with athletics (coaching and playing soccer and more), and I was very passionate about the sciences. This felt like the ultimate win/win - I could study the human body, exercise, and performance and have an impact on human beings. The chairperson was a sports psychologist by training, so I decided to pursue a dual Bachelor's of Science degree in Psychology, with an overall goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in Sports Psychology.\n\nTwo things led me into the nutrition world. I took a Sports Nutrition course and developed a serious interest in food as fuel for athletic performance. Secondly, my chairperson/mentor encouraged me to seek out a Master's degree in a subject that would complement the whole exercise/sports performance genre. Nutrition became a strong interest and so I moved to New York City to pursue a Master's degree in Nutrition & Exercise Physiology at Teachers College, Columbia University. I will write a blog post about how the whole Ph.D. situation worked out later.\n\nAfter being in the health, wellness, and nutrition field for many years, I feel very strongly about being an advocate for quality of life - whether you are young child, an adolescent, a collegiate athlete, a young mother or father, a recent retiree, or in your golden years. Perhaps this comes from me growing up in New Orleans, Louisiana where we have the famous Cajun saying \"Laissez les bon temps roulez\" which translates to \"Let the good times roll.\"\n\nSince 2006, I have provided medical nutrition therapy to a broad spectrum of patients with various medical/nutritional issues throughout the lifecycle. I have had the honor of serving our Nation's Veterans for 10-plus years with the Veterans Health Administration. I have worked with youth and collegiate athletes on fueling themselves for optimal performance. I have worked with friends and co-workers on a number of nutritional issues.\n\nI am currently serving as a national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, Immediate Past-President of the Washington State Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, Past-President of the Greater Seattle Dietetic Association and Past Chair for the National Organization of Men in Nutrition (NOMIN). I am also a youth soccer coach with Emerald City Football Club (ECFC) in Seattle and have been coaching for past 19 years (in New Orleans, New York City metropolitan area, and Seattle) working with pre-school to collegiate-aged athletes.\n\nI currently reside in the Greenwood neighborhood of Seattle, Washington with my two children, Matteo (13-year old son) and Mina (9-year old daughter). When not working with clients, or coaching soccer, you can usually find the family on an adventure or hike enjoying the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n​"
