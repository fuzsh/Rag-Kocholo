        "text": "Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dangerous complication of cholecystectomy, with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term quality of life. BDIs have an estimated incidence of 0.4–1.5%, but considering the number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, mostly by laparoscopy, surgeons must be prepared to manage this surgical challenge. Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success. Subsequently, the choice and timing of the appropriate reconstructive strategy have a critical role in long-term prognosis. Currently, a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary interventions with different degrees of invasiveness is indicated for BDI management. These World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines have been produced following an exhaustive review of the current literature and an international expert panel discussion with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate and standardize the detection and management of BDIs during cholecystectomy. In particular, the 2020 WSES guidelines cover the following key aspects: (1) strategies to minimize the risk of BDI during cholecystectomy; (2) BDI rates in general surgery units and review of surgical practice; (3) how to classify, stage, and report BDI once detected; (4) how to manage an intraoperatively detected BDI; (5) indications for antibiotic treatment; (6) indications for clinical, biochemical, and imaging investigations for suspected BDI; and (7) how to manage a postoperatively detected BDI.\n\nTY - JOUR\n\nT1 - 2020 WSES guidelines for the detection and management of bile duct injury during cholecystectomy\n\nAU - de’Angelis, Nicola\n\nAU - Catena, Fausto\n\nAU - Memeo, Riccardo\n\nAU - Coccolini, Federico\n\nAU - Martínez-Pérez, Aleix\n\nAU - Romeo, Oreste M.\n\nAU - De Simone, Belinda\n\nAU - Di Saverio, Salomone\n\nAU - Brustia, Raffaele\n\nAU - Rhaiem, Rami\n\nAU - Piardi, Tullio\n\nAU - Conticchio, Maria\n\nAU - Marchegiani, Francesco\n\nAU - Beghdadi, Nassiba\n\nAU - Abu-Zidan, Fikri M.\n\nAU - Alikhanov, Ruslan\n\nAU - Allard, Marc Antoine\n\nAU - Allievi, Niccolò\n\nAU - Amaddeo, Giuliana\n\nAU - Ansaloni, Luca\n\nAU - Andersson, Roland\n\nAU - Andolfi, Enrico\n\nAU - Azfar, Mohammad\n\nAU - Bala, Miklosh\n\nAU - Benkabbou, Amine\n\nAU - Ben-Ishay, Offir\n\nAU - Bianchi, Giorgio\n\nAU - Biffl, Walter L.\n\nAU - Brunetti, Francesco\n\nAU - Carra, Maria Clotilde\n\nAU - Casanova, Daniel\n\nAU - Celentano, Valerio\n\nAU - Ceresoli, Marco\n\nAU - Chiara, Osvaldo\n\nAU - Cimbanassi, Stefania\n\nAU - Bini, Roberto\n\nAU - Coimbra, Raul\n\nAU - Luigi de’Angelis, Gian\n\nAU - Decembrino, Francesco\n\nAU - De Palma, Andrea\n\nAU - de Reuver, Philip R.\n\nAU - Domingo, Carlos\n\nAU - Cotsoglou, Christian\n\nAU - Ferrero, Alessandro\n\nAU - Fraga, Gustavo P.\n\nAU - Gaiani, Federica\n\nAU - Gheza, Federico\n\nAU - Gurrado, Angela\n\nAU - Harrison, Ewen\n\nAU - Henriquez, Angel\n\nAU - Hofmeyr, Stefan\n\nAU - Iadarola, Roberta\n\nAU - Kashuk, Jeffry L.\n\nAU - Kianmanesh, Reza\n\nAU - Kirkpatrick, Andrew W.\n\nAU - Kluger, Yoram\n\nAU - Landi, Filippo\n\nAU - Langella, Serena\n\nAU - Lapointe, Real\n\nAU - Le Roy, Bertrand\n\nAU - Luciani, Alain\n\nAU - Machado, Fernando\n\nAU - Maggi, Umberto\n\nAU - Maier, Ronald V.\n\nAU - Mefire, Alain Chichom\n\nAU - Hiramatsu, Kazuhiro\n\nAU - Ordoñez, Carlos\n\nAU - Patrizi, Franca\n\nAU - Planells, Manuel\n\nAU - Peitzman, Andrew B.\n\nAU - Pekolj, Juan\n\nAU - Perdigao, Fabiano\n\nAU - Pereira, Bruno M.\n\nAU - Pessaux, Patrick\n\nAU - Pisano, Michele\n\nAU - Puyana, Juan Carlos\n\nAU - Rizoli, Sandro\n\nAU - Portigliotti, Luca\n\nAU - Romito, Raffaele\n\nAU - Sakakushev, Boris\n\nAU - Sanei, Behnam\n\nAU - Scatton, Olivier\n\nAU - Serradilla-Martin, Mario\n\nAU - Schneck, Anne Sophie\n\nAU - Sissoko, Mohammed Lamine\n\nAU - Sobhani, Iradj\n\nAU - ten Broek, Richard P.\n\nAU - Testini, Mario\n\nAU - Valinas, Roberto\n\nAU - Veloudis, Giorgos\n\nAU - Vitali, Giulio Cesare\n\nAU - Weber, Dieter\n\nAU - Zorcolo, Luigi\n\nAU - Giuliante, Felice\n\nAU - Gavriilidis, Paschalis\n\nAU - Fuks, David\n\nAU - Sommacale, Daniele\n\nN1 - Publisher Copyright: © 2021, The Author(s).\n\nPY - 2021/12\n\nY1 - 2021/12\n\nN2 - Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dangerous complication of cholecystectomy, with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term quality of life.
