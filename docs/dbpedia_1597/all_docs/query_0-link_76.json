While GVP, its authors and editors make every effort to see that no inaccurate or misleading data, opinion, or statements appear in the Content, including, without limitation, articles and continuing education programs, they wish to state that the data and opinions in the Content are the responsibility of the contributor concerned. Accordingly, the publisher, editors, and their respective employers, employees, officers, and agents accept no liability whatsoever for the consequences of any such inaccurate or misleading data, opinion, or statement. Additionally, standards and practices in nutrition, dietetics and healthcare change as new data become available and the individual professional should consult a variety of sources in making clinical decisions for individual patients and clients.\n\nGVP describes basic principles of assessment, treatment and therapy. The information provided in GVP is no substitute for individual patient/client assessment based upon the professional’s examination of each patient/client and consideration of laboratory data and other factors unique to the patient/client.\n\nNotification of Infringement\n\nNotifications regarding any alleged intellectual property infringement should be directed to the GVP Legal Department by email addressed toÂ legal@gvpub.com.\n\nLinks\n\nThe Site may contain links to third-party sites or resources. GVP is not responsible for the availability of external sites or resources linked to the Site, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. Transactions that occur between you and any third party are strictly between you and the third party and are not the responsibility of GVP. Because GVP is not responsible for the availability or accuracy of these outside resources or their contents, you should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of these linked sites, as their policies may differ from those of GVP.
