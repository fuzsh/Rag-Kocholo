The most studied forms of intermittent fasting to date include alternate day fasting (‘fast day’ alternating with ‘feast days’), the 5:2 diet (two fast days and five feast days per week), and time-restricted eating (only eating within a specific window of time each day). However, only a few studies have examined the health benefits of these diets in humans.

They also play an important role in fetal brain and eye development and reducing the risk of early preterm birth. However, 95 percent of Americans – and 80 percent of people worldwide – are not getting enough of these vital nutrients.\n\nWhile it is possible to obtain EPA and DHA omega-3s through the diet from fatty fish, seafood and some fortified foods, dietary supplements may be helpful or necessary in some cases.\n\nBefore starting any supplement regimen, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, as individual needs can vary. Additionally, it’s worthwhile to choose high-quality supplements that undergo testing for purity and potency.\n\nTune into this episode to learn about:\n\n· different types of omega-3s, recommended amounts and average intakes\n\n· health benefits of and common myths about omega-3s\n\n· food sources of omega-3s and barriers/challenges in increasing consumption\n\n· an overview of the amount of research and the GOED clinical study database\n\n· latest research related to diabetes, brain health and mental health\n\n· limitations of research and future research opportunities\n\n· practical tips for increasing intake of omega-3 rich foods\n\n· what to look for in a supplement\n\n· where to order at-home omega-3 index tests\n\n· resources for the public and health professionals\n\nFull shownotes, transcript and resources at: https://soundbitesrd.com/251\n\nProtein Quality, Nutrient Bioavailability & A Global Perspective on Animal Agriculture\n\nWhile plant-source foods provide important nutrients in our diets, animal-source foods contain more bioavailable sources of multiple critically needed macro- and micronutrients that can contribute to proper physical and cognitive growth of children. In rural parts of developing countries, these animal-source foods are vital for preventing undernutrition and allowing proper growth and brain development in children.\n\nTune into this episode to learn about:\n\n· The latest research on animal-source foods in healthy and sustainable diets\n\n· Nutrient intake of children in developing countries\n\n· How developing countries approach sustainable agriculture differently than the U.S.\n\n· Protein quality of different foods and food groups\n\n· Bioavailability of micro and macronutrients\n\n· Global biofortification efforts\n\n· Challenges in increasing consumption of animal-source foods in developing countries\n\n· A global perspective on animal agriculture\n\n· The Dublin Declaration of Scientists and the societal role of meat\n\n· Climate-smart approaches to livestock production\n\n· Pros/cons of cultured meat\n\nFull shownotes, transcript and resources at: https://soundbitesrd.com/250\n\nA considerable amount of misinformation exists about food allergies among the public and health professionals alike. This episode delves into the prevalence and pathophysiology of food allergies, emphasizing the difference between self-reported and diagnosed cases, with around 6% of both U.S. adults and children affected. The immune-mediated nature of food allergies and the various types of reactions they can trigger are discussed as well as the importance of clinical correlation with test results, because tests like blood, skin prick and patch tests can yield false positives. The food elimination diet and oral challenge process are employed to eliminate and reintroduce suspected food allergens, however potential nutrient deficiencies can become a concern when omitting multiple foods or food groups. Strategies to reduce the risk of food allergies, including early introduction of allergenic foods to infants are highlighted. The role of dietitians in managing complex cases involving multiple allergies, infants and comorbidities is emphasized.\n\nTune into this episode with Sara Glanz to learn about:\n\n· What are the “Big 8” food allergens and what additional food has recently been added to that list\n\n· Prevalence of food allergies in the U.S.\n\n· The difference between food allergies and intolerances\n\n· The 5 different categories that food allergy reactions are classified into\n\n· Various types of food allergy tests\n\n· What you need to know about at-home tests\n\n· How the elimination diet works\n\n· What an oral challenge entails\n\n· The potential for micro- or macronutrient deficiencies\n\n· Current guidelines for infant feeding to help reduce the risk of food allergies\n\n· When and how dietitians should get involved\n\nFull shownotes, transcript and resources at: https://soundbitesrd.com/249\n\nShow more"
