        "text": "Introduction\n\nB lymphocytes comprise the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system. They undergo a well-orchestrated series of clonal expansion and differentiation programs in the bone marrow (BM) to become mature B cells that reside in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes (LeBien and Tedder, 2008; Pieper et al., 2013). During an adaptive immune response, B cells are recruited into the germinal center (GC) where they adopt one of two cellular fates before exiting the GC: memory B cells that confer immunological memory and plasma cells that produce antibodies of high affinity and specificity (Mesin et al., 2016; Victora and Nussenzweig, 2022). B lymphocytes are unique among other immune cells in that they initiate programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) both as developing precursors in the BM and as GC B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (Alt et al., 2013). V(D)J recombination generates a primary repertoire of B cell receptors that can be further diversified when GC B cells employ the DNA-modifying enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to instigate the formation of DSBs in the immunoglobulin heavy loci (IgH) for class-switch recombination and to somatically hypermutate the variable regions of the immunoglobulin loci (Feng et al., 2020; Schatz and Swanson, 2011; Xu et al., 2012). To outcompete other clonal cells and be selected for survival and differentiation, GC B cells not only are required to express the correct antigen-specific receptor of high affinity and specificity, but they must also satisfy the formidable replicative, transcriptional, and metabolic demands for clonal expansion (Young and Brink, 2021). These cellular activities pose significant collateral genotoxic hazards to GC B cells; therefore, safeguarding the cells’ genomic integrity is paramount for accurate duplication and propagation of genetic information.\n\nImpediments to the progression of the replication fork—termed replication stress—represent a significant endogenous source of DSBs in proliferating cells, producing up to 50 DSBs per cell cycle in a cell (Mehta and Haber, 2014; Zeman and Cimprich, 2014). Factors that impair the functionality of the replication machinery include repetitive sequences, secondary structures (such as R-loops and G-quadruplexes), transcription-replication conflicts, lesions such as thymidine dimers and single-stranded breaks, oxidative stress, and imbalance or depletion of the nucleotide pool (Zeman and Cimprich, 2014). To ensure completion of DNA synthesis before mitosis commences, replication forks that have stalled or collapsed can be restarted via recombination-dependent or -independent pathways, the choice of which is contingent upon the nature of the replication barrier, the duration of stalling, the nature of the intermediates generated after fork stalling, and the type of processing these intermediates undergo (Berti et al., 2020; Petermann and Helleday, 2010; Zeman and Cimprich, 2014). Though primarily studied in the context of DSB repair, proteins involved in homologous recombination (HR) including BRCA2 and RAD51 are also critical for the protection, remodeling, and recombination-dependent restart of replication forks, highlighting the necessity of HR in mitigating replication stress and assisting the timely completion of DNA synthesis (Ait Saada et al., 2018; Carr and Lambert, 2013; Scully et al., 2021).\n\nRecombination-dependent repair of DSBs and restart of replication forks entail strand invasion and homology search of an intact duplex DNA, generating a nascent joint intermediate termed the displacement loop (D-loop) that culminates in the formation of Holliday junctions (HJs) that physically link the two sister chromatids (Falquet and Rass, 2019). Several mechanisms have evolved to process these intermediates, as failure to eliminate them prohibits chromosomal segregation during mitosis, interfering with the faithful transmission of genetic material to the daughter cells (West and Chan, 2017). The BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex dissolves double HJs to generate non-crossover products while structure-selective endonucleases (SSEs) such as the SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex and GEN1 resolve single and double HJs to generate both crossover and non-crossover products, depending on the position of the nicks introduced (Blanco and Matos, 2015). Due to their in vitro 3′-flap endonuclease activity and the formation of 3′ flaps during synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), MUS81 complexes may also participate in the resolution of non-HJ-mediated recombination by cleaving such overhangs (Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004). Moreover, mus81 and yen1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can process D-loops to influence the pathway choice and outcome of HR-mediated DSB repair as the absence of these enzymes promote break-induced replication (BIR) instead of SDSA (Ho et al., 2010). Because these SSEs are active against a broad spectrum of branched DNA structures, they are subjected to multiple cell cycle-dependent regulatory mechanisms so that replication can proceed without interference and that toxic recombination outcomes due to uncontrolled cleavage are minimized (Wild and Matos, 2016). Although the deletion of BLM itself causes embryonic lethality in mice, individual loss of GEN1 or MUS81 does not confer a strong DNA repair-deficient phenotype in unperturbed cells, implying some degree of functional overlap between the two proteins (McDaniel et al., 2003; Sarbajna et al., 2014). Only when GEN1 and MUS81 are both absent is the genomic integrity of the cells severely subverted, resulting in aberrant mitotic structures including bulky chromatin bridges and ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) that lead to compromised viability, gross chromosomal mis-segregation and abnormalities, multinucleation, and heightened formation of micronuclei (Chan et al., 2018; Chan and West, 2018; Garner et al., 2013; Sarbajna et al., 2014; Sarlós et al., 2017; Wechsler et al., 2011; West et al., 2015).\n\nBesides removing HR intermediates arising from recombinational DNA transactions, both SSEs process persistent replication intermediates to promote the completion of genome replication and sister chromatid disentanglement (Falquet and Rass, 2019). MUS81 complexes can cleave replication forks, structures resembling intact HJs such as four-way reversed forks, and D-loops to initiate and regulate BIR as a mechanism to repair dysfunctional forks (Hanada et al., 2007; Hua et al., 2022; Kikuchi et al., 2013; Mayle et al., 2015; Pepe and West, 2014a; Pepe and West, 2014b). MUS81 is also essential for the ‘expression’ of common fragile sites (CFSs)—sites that are prone to under-replication during stressed conditions—by cleaving stalled replication forks to enable POLD3-mediated mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) (Debatisse et al., 2012; Minocherhomji et al., 2015; Naim et al., 2013; Ying et al., 2013). Generation of DSBs via MUS81-dependent cleavage of stalled replication forks, however, is not a prerequisite for HR-dependent replication restart as the uncoupling of the DNA strands at collapsed forks generates ssDNA that can invade and re-initiate DNA synthesis (Lambert et al., 2010; Rass, 2013). Though GEN1 has been implicated in maintaining replication fork progression alongside MUS81 and in eliminating persistent replication intermediates in Dna2 helicase-defective yeast cells to potentially facilitate MiDAS, its importance in rectifying replication stress and DNA under-replication in a genetically intact background remains to be determined (Ölmezer et al., 2016; Sarbajna et al., 2014).\n\nThe role of GEN1 and MUS81 in replication-challenged in vitro settings employing ionizing irradiation, DNA-damaging chemicals, and replication inhibitors is well established. Less is known, however, of these enzymes’ importance in an unperturbed in vivo context as the use of such genotoxic agents may not accurately reproduce the nature and composition of various DNA lesions generated during cellular proliferation. Because B cells face an elevated risk of cell death and oncogenic transformation due to the high level of replication stress and DSBs inflicted on their genome by AID-dependent and -independent activities (Alt et al., 2013; Barlow et al., 2013; Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2015; Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015), we asked whether B cells require GEN1 and MUS81 to develop, survive, and perform their immunological functions. By employing different stage-specific Cre strains and a global Gen1-knockout mouse carrying floxed Mus81 alleles, we report that the loss of both Gen1 and Mus81 in early pro-B cells severely impaired B cell development whereas double-null mature B cells failed to form competent GCs at steady-state and after immunization. Ex vivo characterization of the endonuclease-knockout cells uncovered a proliferation block caused by G2/M arrest, potent activation of p53 and apoptotic pathways, induction of type I interferon (IFN) response, and widespread chromosomal aberrations. Our findings support the notion that the function of GEN1 and MUS81 in highly proliferative somatic cells such as B cells is in eliminating replication- and recombination-born junction and branched DNA molecules ranging from stalled and reversed replication forks to D-loops and dHJs to maintain replication and genomic fidelity, ensure proper chromosome segregation, and avert mitotic catastrophe.\n\nResults\n\nGEN1 and MUS81 are critical to normal B cell lymphopoiesis\n\nWe analyzed a publicly accessible RNA-seq data set ({\"type\":\"entrez-geo\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"GSE72018\",\"term_id\":\"72018\"}}GSE72018) to ascertain the expression pattern of Gen1 and Mus81 in various developing and mature B cell subsets (Brazão et al., 2016). Expression of Gen1 is higher in the proliferating pro-B, pre-B, and GC B cells than in follicular B, marginal zone B, and peritoneal B1a cells ( ). Conversely, Mus81 RNA expression is relatively similar across all B cell subsets examined except in peritoneal B1a cells ( ). RT-qPCR analysis of primary splenic naïve B lymphocytes stimulated in culture with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) revealed a 10-fold increase in Gen1 expression as early as 24-hr post-activation, while the expression of Mus81 was not altered following activation ( ). We surmise that Gen1 expression is more closely associated with the activation and proliferation of B cells than is Mus81 expression.\n\nTo interrogate the roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in B cell development and function, we generated Gen1−/− mice by deleting the XPG nuclease domain encoded in exon 4 of Gen1 and subsequently crossed them to Mus81−/− mice (Dendouga et al., 2005; ). Whereas Gen1−/− and Mus81−/− mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequencies, no live Gen1−/− Mus81−/− pups were produced, indicating that constitutive loss of both GEN1 and MUS81 leads to embryonic death ( ). To circumvent this lethality, we generated floxed Mus81 (Mus81fl/fl) mice in which exons 3–10 encoding for the ERCC4 nuclease domain are flanked by loxP sites ( ). We bred these mice to the Mb1 (Cd79a)-Cre strain, wherein Cre recombinase expression is driven by the Cd79a promoter and the excision of the floxed allele is initiated at the pre-pro B cell stage (Fahl et al., 2009; Hobeika et al., 2006). The Mb1-Cre: Mus81fl/fl mice were mated to Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice to produce the conditional knockout Mb1-Cre: Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl, the single knockouts Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl and Mb1-Cre: Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl, and the control Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl.\n\nWe analyzed the spleen of the Mb1-Cre Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice and found that its cellularity was reduced by ninefold compared with that of control and single knockout mice ( ). The near complete ablation of mature B220+CD43+ and B220+CD43− cellular compartments indicated a significantly perturbed development or maintenance of peripheral B-lineage cells ( ). Examination of the BM revealed a 75% reduction in total cell number that was caused by the severe loss of the total B cell population; the T cell fraction remained unaltered ( ). Quantification of the B-lineage subpopulations showed that both immature and mature recirculating B cells were absent in the Mb1-Cre Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl BMs ( ), and that the endonuclease-deficient B cell progenitors produced few CD19+ CD43+ BP1– CD24var pro-B cells ( ). Quantitative genomic PCR of the unrecombined Mus81fl/fl allele in Mb1-Cre: Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl pro-B (fractions B+C) cells confirmed efficient Cre-mediated deletion of the loxP-flanked exons ( ). We further validated by RT-qPCR the absence of Gen1 and Mus81 mRNA expression in Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl and Mb1-Cre: Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl pro-B cells, respectively ( ). These findings indicate that Gen1 and Mus81 in early B-cell precursors are necessary for the differentiation, expansion, or maintenance of developing pro-B cells.\n\nGEN1 and MUS81 are required for robust GC responses\n\nTo circumvent the B cell developmental block in Mb1-Cre: Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice, we employed the Cd23-Cre deleter that expresses Cre specifically in naïve B cells under the control of a transgenic Cd23 promoter (Kwon et al., 2008). We crossed the Cd23-Cre strain to Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice, generating Cd23-Cre: Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl (designated henceforth as DKO), Cd23-Cre: Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl (Mus81-KO), Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl (Gen1-KO), Cd23-Cre: Gen1+/− Mus81fl/+ (Cre control), and Gen1+/− Mus81fl/fl (control) littermates. Though the B cell precursor subsets in the BM of the DKO mice did not exhibit any major alterations in their frequencies or absolute numbers ( ), the total BM cellularity was reduced by 30%, attributed to the 60% decrease in the number of the mature recirculating B cells ( ). In the spleens of DKO mice, the frequencies and absolute numbers of the various B cell subsets were comparable to those of control and the Gen1-KO and Mus81-KO (collectively referred to as SKO) mice ( ). RT-qPCR analysis of splenic mature DKO B cells activated with LPS+IL-4 confirmed the ablation of Gen1 and Mus81 transcripts ( ). These data show that the deletion of Gen1 and Mus81 in naïve, mature B cells does not markedly impact the development and maintenance of homeostatic B cell compartments; thus, the DKO mouse can serve as a genetic tool to investigate the requirement of Gen1 and Mus81 in activated, mature B cells.\n\nWe next characterized the impact of Gen1 and Mus81 deletion on the steady-state GC response in the mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer’s patches—sites where B cells continuously encounter and are activated by microbial and food antigens ( ). We found that the frequency and absolute number of GC B cells were decreased by 1.5- to 2-fold in DKO mice compared with control and SKO mice ( ). The presence of residual DKO GC B cells could be attributed to the selection of GC B cells that have escaped Cre-mediated deletion of the Mus81fl/fl allele, as evidenced by the detection of unrecombined Mus81fl/fl allelic copies and Mus81 mRNA transcript within the DKO GC B cell population compared with the near-complete deletion of Mus81fl/fl allele in the non-GC B cell counterpart ( ). Gen1 mRNA expression, however, was absent in both DKO GC and non-GC B cells ( ).\n\nTo assess the importance of GEN1 and MUS81 in supporting the formation and integrity of induced GCs, we immunized mice with sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) to elicit a T cell-dependent GC response. Mice were boosted 10 days after the primary dose and the GCs in the spleen were analyzed at day 14 ( ). Only in the DKO mice was GC formation abrogated: the frequency and absolute number of the GCs were 5% of that observed in control and SKO mice ( ). Within the sparse population of DKO GC B cells that we could reliably detect, the frequency of IgG1-switched cells was reduced by twofold compared to that in control and SKO GCs; more importantly, the absolute count of these switched DKO cells was almost negligible ( ). Such disruption in GC formation and IgG1 class-switching was also observed when DKO mice were challenged with another T-cell-dependent antigen, NP-CGG ( and ). Despite the compromised GC response, the frequencies and absolute numbers of total B220+CD19+B cells in the immunized DKO mice were comparable to their SKO and control littermates ( ). These experiments indicate that although Gen1-Mus81-null naïve B cells can persist in the periphery, they are unable to mount a productive GC reaction upon antigenic exposure at the barrier sites and in secondary lymphoid organs.\n\nGEN1 and MUS81 are necessary for B cell proliferation and survival\n\nTo mechanistically investigate the causes underlying the abrogated GC response in the DKO mice, we leveraged a tractable ex vivo culture system wherein purified splenic naïve B cells are induced to proliferate upon stimulation with various cocktails of mitogens and cytokines. The expansion of splenic B cell cultures stimulated with LPS alone, LPS+IL-4 (LI), or LPS+TGF-β+anti-IgD dextran (LTD) was monitored by enumerating the live cells in culture using flow cytometry. Across all stimulation conditions, the DKO B cells were unable to expand—after 96 hr of culture, the number of live DKO cells was only 10% of that of control and SKO B cells ( and ). We then examined the proliferation dynamics of DKO B cells by labeling the cells with CellTrace Violet and tracking the dilution of the dye over time ( ). We noted that at 72-hr post-stimulation, between 51% (LTD culture) and 68% (LPS culture) of the DKO cells had underwent at least three rounds of cell division, in contrast to between 72% (LTD culture) and 86% (LPS culture) of the corresponding control and SKO populations ( and ). Although the DKO LI and LPS cultures contained a comparatively higher frequency of undivided (division zero) cells, the absolute numbers of division zero cells in both stimulations were similar across all genotypes, supporting the notion that the accumulation of division zero cells reflects a disproportionate representation of undivided DKO cells in the cultures caused by the progressive attrition of proliferating DKO cells, rather than by the specific inability of DKO cells to initiate cell division ( and ). As cellular proliferation is intimately linked to class switching (Hodgkin et al., 1996; Rush et al., 2005), the lack of proliferative expansion of DKO B cells led to a minimal production of class-switched cells ( and ).\n\nTo gain additional insight into the proliferation defect sustained by the activated DKO cells, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of these cells. Cultured B cells were pulse labeled with the nucleoside analog EdU to mark cells in S phase and stained with DAPI to quantify DNA content; the proportion of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases was determined by flow cytometry ( ). As early as 48-hr post-stimulation, the DKO cultures were enriched for cells in G2/M phase and depleted for cells in S phase ( ). This skewed cell cycle distribution of the DKO cells persisted up till 96-hr post-activation and was observed in all culture conditions ( ). Additionally, in the LTD culture, the fraction of DKO cells in the G0/G1 stage was reduced across all the time points examined ( ). Altogether, these results suggest that the concomitant loss of GEN1 and MUS81 causes the cells to stall in G2/M, impeding the completion of the cell cycle.\n\nAside from the proliferation deficiency, we also observed a 2- to 3-fold higher proportion of dead cells in the DKO cultures relative to that in control and SKO cultures ( and ). To ascertain whether elevated apoptosis contributed to the perturbed expansion of DKO B cell cultures, we quantified by flow cytometry the frequency of cells that stained for anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody. As early as 48-hr post-stimulation, the proportion of caspase-3+ cells was 2- to 5-fold higher in DKO cultures compared with control and SKO cultures. The size of the caspase-3+ population peaked at 72-hr post-stimulation before declining (LI and LTD cultures) or remaining unchanged (LPS culture) at 96-hr post-stimulation ( and ). When we quantified the fraction of caspase 3+ cells in the different cell cycle phases, we found that across all the time points and stimulation conditions examined, DKO cells in G2/M and G0/G1 phases experienced a 2- to 5-fold higher level of apoptosis than their control and SKO counterparts ( and ). Taken together, these observations underscore an indispensable role for GEN1 and MUS81 in supporting the proliferative capacity and viability of activated B lymphocytes.\n\nAblation of GEN1 and MUS81 induces p53 and type I interferon transcriptional programs\n\nTo assess the genome-wide transcriptional alterations underlying the proliferation and survival defects of ex vivo-activated DKO B cells, we conducted RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on activated B cells harvested at 48-hr post-stimulation, the time point at which the DKO cells were viable while displaying early signs of cell cycle perturbation and apoptosis. The RNA-seq analysis showed that the activated control and Gen1-KO B lymphocytes resembled each other transcriptomically, consistent with the lack of overt perturbations in Gen1-KO B cells ( ). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis comparing Mus81-KO to control cells, however, identified 8 genes with a minimum of twofold upregulation in Mus81-KO cells ( ). The induction of only a few genes in Mus81-KO cells could be explained by the mild proliferation and survival perturbations that we had observed in our in vivo and ex vivo experiments. Between Gen1-KO and Mus81-KO cells, the transcript level of only four genes, including Mus81, were differentially altered ( ). These findings collectively illustrate that the deletion of either Gen1 or Mus81 alone does not substantially alter the transcriptional landscape of activated B lymphocytes.\n\nDGE analysis of control versus DKO cells, on the contrary, revealed that 279 genes were upregulated by at least twofold (log2 fold change≥1; FDR<0.05) and 167 genes were downregulated by a minimum of log2 fold change of –0.3 in the DKO B cells (corresponding to a ≥19% de-enrichment relative to control cells) ( ). To identify the functional modules to which the differentially expressed genes in the DKO cells belong, we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) with the Hallmark Gene Sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Liberzon et al., 2015). We identified the p53 pathway (25/200 genes with log2 fold change≥1; e.g., Ccng1, Zfp365, Plk2, Phlda3, Cdkn1a, and Zmat3) and apoptosis (15/161 genes with log2 fold change≥0.5) signatures among the top five enriched gene sets whereas gene sets containing targets of the transcription factors MYC and E2F and genes involved in progression through the G2/M checkpoint were among the most de-enriched in the DKO cells ( and ), concurring with our findings that DKO cultures exhibit perturbed cell cycle progression, G2/M arrest, proliferation irregularities, and heightened apoptosis. We also noted that the ex vivo-activated DKO B cells displayed a robust type I IFN gene signature, as exemplified by the high enrichment score (NES=2.35; FDR=6.34×10–3) and the induction (log2 fold change≥0.5) of 21/97 genes in the gene set (e.g., Ifit3, Ifit3b, Ifitm3, Mx1, and Rsad2) ( ). We posit from this analysis that the deficiency of both GEN1 and MUS81 in cells activates p53-dependent pathways to arrest cell cycle for the repair of genomic insults sustained during cellular growth and proliferation, and to initiate apoptosis when such DNA lesions are beyond tolerance and repair.\n\np53 deficiency fails to ameliorate the proliferative and viability defects of GEN1-MUS81-double-null B cells\n\nSince the DKO cells exhibit a strong p53 transcriptional signature that could drive their apoptosis and G2/M arrest, we wanted to determine whether the deletion of p53 would mitigate these detrimental events and restore the growth and functionality of DKO cells. To test this hypothesis, we bred Trp53fl/fl mice to the DKO mouse to generate Cd23-Cre: Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl Trp53fl/fl (DKO Trp53-KO) mice.\n\nExamination of the GCs in the mLN and Peyer’s patches of DKO Trp53-KO mice and their p53-expressing littermates (DKO Trp53-WT and DKO Trp53-Het) revealed no difference in the absolute number of total B cells and in the frequency of GC B cells among these groups ( ). Likewise, growth curve and CellTrace Violet dilution analyses showed no alterations in the proliferative competence of DKO Trp53-KO B cells ( ). These cells, however, did exhibit small but incongruent differences in their class-switching capacities ( ). Further, the cell cycle profile of the DKO Trp53-KO cells was not substantively different from that of the DKO Trp53-WT and DKO Trp53-Het cells ( ).\n\nDespite the comparable percentage of dead DKO cells independent of their p53 status ( ), the DKO Trp53-KO B cells underwent reduced level of apoptosis at 48-hr post-stimulation compared with their p53-expressing counterparts ( ). This decrease was not sustained at subsequent time points; instead, the fraction of apoptotic DKO Trp53-KO cells increased and became higher than that of p53-expressing DKO B cells ( ). Assessment of apoptosis in the individual cell cycle phase showed that the temporal changes in the cell death of p53-null DKO cells occurred consistently in the G2/M phase ( ). These data together show that the severe proliferative and survival deficiencies of DKO B cells cannot be overcome by the removal of p53.\n\nGEN1 and MUS81 maintain the genome stability of activated B lymphocytes\n\nGEN1 and MUS81 resolve structural intermediates arising from replication and HR to prevent genome destabilization caused by the toxic accumulation of erroneously processed branched and joint DNA structures (Chan et al., 2018; Sarbajna et al., 2014). Reasoning that the genomic integrity of proliferating DKO B cells might similarly be compromised, we prepared metaphase spreads from ex vivo-stimulated B cells for evaluation of chromosomal integrity. DKO B cells displayed approximately six times as many abnormalities per metaphase as control and SKOs B cells ( ). Furthermore, whereas almost 95% of control and SKO metaphases had no more than two aberrations, 45% of DKO metaphases showed three or more chromosomal defects ( ). Chromosomal aberrations, including breaks, DNA fragments, fusions, and radials, were detected at an elevated rate in DKO B cells compared with control and SKOs cells ( ). Notably, 67% of the breaks observed were chromosome-type breaks that occur at the same position on both sister chromatids ( ). To better understand the origins and nature of the chromosomal irregularities occurring in the activated DKO B cells, we performed telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (Tel-FISH). In DKO cells, the breakage occurred proximal to the telomeres, resulting in paired DNA fragments containing telomeric DNA ( ). Such symmetrical breakage has been proposed to arise from unresolved recombination intermediates (Garner et al., 2013). Additionally, the Tel-FISH analysis revealed that the aberrations identified by Giemsa staining as acentric chromosomes in fact often involved two separate chromosomes, and thus likely represent a class of radials involving acrocentric short arms ( ). These observations show that the absence of GEN1 and MUS81 engenders an assortment of chromosomal lesions in proliferating B cells.\n\nBecause AID-instigated DSBs within and outside of the IgH loci constitute a source of DNA damage in B lymphocytes, we generated Cd23-Cre: Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl Aicda−/− (DKO Aicda-KO) mice to ascertain whether ablation of AID can rescue the viability and proliferation defects of DKO B cells. Ex vivo culture studies showed that the deletion of AID did not restore the proliferative and survival capacities of DKO cells ( ). Additionally, the average number of chromosomal aberrations in the DKO Aicda-KO cells was similar to that of DKO Aicda-Het B cells ( ). These findings illustrate that AID-driven DSBs contribute little to the severe proliferation and viability defects exhibited by Gen1-Mus81-null B lymphocytes and that the chromosomal aberrations occurring within the DKO B cells are likely caused by unrepaired replication-associated DNA damage.\n\nDiscussion\n\nB cells encounter a diverse array of genotoxic stresses throughout their life cycle, of which DSBs—both spontaneously and deliberately generated—are considered among the most deleterious genomic lesions. HR constitutes one of the two major pathways cells utilize to repair DSBs. This mode of repair is largely restricted to late S and G2 phases as it requires the sister chromatid as a template to restore the fidelity of the damaged DNA strand (Heyer, 2015). Recombinational repair of DSB lesions produces various joint and branched molecules that must be processed accurately and timely by SSEs to maintain the integrity of the genome (Blanco and Matos, 2015; Dehé and Gaillard, 2017). Due to their broad substrate specificity, SSEs are stringently regulated within a physiological environment via multiple mechanisms including binding with regulatory proteins and post-translational modifications that constrain their in vivo target recognition, thus endowing them with context-specific cellular functions (Wild and Matos, 2016). To examine the genome-stabilizing role of GEN1 and MUS81 at various stages of B cell development, we established a Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mouse model and utilized early and late B-cell-specific Cre drivers for the conditional deletion of MUS81. Inactivation of both enzymes in early B cell precursors abolished the production of mature B cells in the BM and periphery, whereas ablation in mature, naïve B cells impaired GC formation in response to antigenic stimulation. Ex vivo cellular and transcriptomics analyses revealed that these endonuclease-deficient B cells exhibited significant proliferation and viability perturbations underpinned by widespread chromosomal abnormalities and activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to protracted p53 signaling elicited by extensive DNA damage.\n\nThe severe attrition of pro-B cells in the Mb1-Cre Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice could be caused by a developmental arrest during the transition from pre-pro B cell to pro-B cell stage, by proliferation and survival defects of the pro-B cells, or both. Pro-B cells, compared to the mitotically inactive pre-pro B cells, undergo IL-7R-dependent proliferative expansion prior to V(D)J recombination and so are more likely to suffer from intense replication stress that could necessitate commensurate effort of replication restart (Hardy et al., 1991; Peschon et al., 1994). As the SSE-knockout pro-B cells are unable to resolve both stalled replication forks and recombination-associated DNA structures formed during such restart activities, they would fail to thrive and proliferate further. Similarly, the lack of robust chronic and induced GC responses in the Cd23-Cre Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice can be ascribed to the inability of DKO cells to alleviate replication stress generated during sustained proliferation by eliminating replication-induced junction molecules, leading to G2/M stalling and abrogation of a complete cell division. High levels of concurrent DNA replication and transcriptional activities within the GC B cells could promote replication-transcription conflicts and R-loop formation that further exacerbate replication stress. We did not observe a time-dependent G2/M accumulation in the DKO culture, suggesting that the arrested DKO cells could not tolerate for long periods the high level of DNA damage incurred from multiple rounds of cell division and consequently undergo mitotic catastrophe, evidenced in the comparatively higher rate of apoptosis among cells in the G2/M phase. Resting mature DKO cells, however, persisted unscathed in the spleen, as exemplified by the normal frequencies and numbers of splenic B cell subpopulations in the Cd23-Cre Gen1−/− Mus81fl/fl mice. Splenic naïve B cells do not self-renew; instead, they are constantly replenished from immature precursors produced in the BM and maintained homeostatically by the survival signals BAFF and APRIL (Hao and Rajewsky, 2001; Mackay and Gommerman, 2015). Hence, resting mature B cells are spared from replication-derived genotoxicity, rendering GEN1 and MUS81 dispensable in these cells.\n\nThe inability of the BTR complex to compensate for the concomitant deficiencies of GEN1 and MUS81 and maintain the viability of proliferating DKO B cells suggests that DNA replication and recombination events generate persistent double HJs and multiple BTR-refractory HJ species such as single HJs and nicked HJs that must be resolved by these endonucleases to suppress genomic instability and catastrophic mitosis (García-Luis and Machín, 2014). Nevertheless, the absence of these SSEs may also preclude the processing of aberrant replication intermediates that could deleteriously impact the genome duplication process and undermine the proliferative capacity of the cells. In particular, the MUS81-EME2 complex has been shown to mediate replication fork restart by endonucleolytic cleavage of stalled replication forks during S phase to protect genome integrity (Pepe and West, 2014a). Although the in vivo relevance of GEN1 in processing such intermediates remains to be formally established, our genetic analysis and others suggest that when MUS81 is unavailable, GEN1 can potentially act on these substrates (or a processed form of them) that persist into mitosis upon nuclear breakdown to initiate HR-dependent fork restart (García-Luis and Machín, 2014; Ho et al., 2010; Sarbajna et al., 2014). Deregulated mutagenic synthesis of the DNA strand during BIR can also contribute to the genomic instability of the DKO cells. Deficiency in these SSEs enables the uncleaved D-loop to undergo prolonged extension, promoting mutagenesis, template switching, and nonreciprocal loss of heterozygosity (Ho et al., 2010; Mayle et al., 2015). SSEs can presumably act on nascent D-loops to promote the less deleterious genetic outcome of half crossovers and on extended D-loops to restrict error-prone DNA synthesis (Mayle et al., 2015; Schwartz and Heyer, 2011). Alternatively, the inability to eliminate single HJ intermediates formed from the merger of an incoming replication fork with the extending D-loop may explain the genotoxicity of BIR in Gen1-Mus81-DKO cells (Mayle et al., 2015). Although the disruption of the D-loop is central to the initiation of SDSA, no experimental evidence has emerged thus far to support such a role by MUS81, and we believe this to be highly unlikely due to its nicking mechanism. The MUS81 complexes, nonetheless, may be implicated in facilitating SDSA because of their 3′-flap cleavage activity (Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004).\n\nOur observation of extensive chromosomal aberrations in the endonuclease-null mouse B cells concur with that of Sarbajna et al., 2014 that employed siRNA depletion of Gen1 and Mus81 in cells treated with replication inhibitors. Recombination intermediates generated in S phase that fail to be resolved in the absence of GEN1 and MUS81 evade the checkpoint response and persist into mitosis, generating homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) (Chan et al., 2018; Mohebi et al., 2015; Tiwari et al., 2018). Breakage of the HR-UFBs during cytokinesis engenders chromosomal breaks that activate the DNA damage checkpoint in the next cell cycle, triggering non-homologous end joining-mediated fusion of DNA ends that leads to widespread chromosomal rearrangements (Chan et al., 2018). The preponderance of chromosome breaks that appear to occur at identical sites on sister chromatids suggest that the aberrations result from defective resolution of inter-chromatid recombination intermediates (Kikuchi et al., 2013; Shimizu et al., 2020; Wechsler et al., 2011). This phenotype is distinct from that of irradiated HR-defective mutants in which chromatid breaks predominate (Fujita et al., 2013; Shimizu et al., 2020). Unresolved HJs have been implicated to impede DNA condensation in mitosis, manifesting as ‘pinches’ in the chromosome (Wechsler et al., 2011); thus, a subset of the chromosome breaks observed in DKO cells may not be actual breaks but rather intact HJs. Although these chromosome-type breaks may also arise due to defective NHEJ, the established roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in HJ resolution render this explanation unlikely. We also cannot completely exclude the role of MUS81—and potentially GEN1—in cleaving stalled replication forks to initiate BIR and MiDAS at CFS and other under-replicated regions where such failure leads to the formation of FANCD2-flanking fragile site-UFBs (FS-UFBs) between the segregating chromatids (Naim et al., 2013; Ying et al., 2013). However, the frequent occurrence of breaks at corresponding locations on paired sister chromatids argues for a failure of DKO B cells to resolve HR intermediates. Visualization of UFBs in these cells hence may help delineate the molecular origins of these unique aberrations.\n\nDetailed investigations into whether HR-UFBs derive predominantly from genomic loci where stalled replication forks are preferentially restarted through recombination-dependent mechanisms could provide mechanistic insights into the genomic instability of SSE-null B cells and clarify the manner by which GEN1 and MUS81 resolve replication stress—do they cleave persistent and late-occurring replication intermediates such as reversed forks or do they process HR intermediates (e.g., D-loops and HJs) arising from recombination-mediated restart of perturbed forks? Further studies to determine whether the loci where HR-UFBs manifest encompass early replication fragile sites (ERFSs) should be pursued given that ERFSs exhibit higher level of HR-dependent sister chromatid exchanges than CFSs upon chemical induction of replication stress (Waisertreiger et al., 2020). More importantly, such sites have recently been identified as hotspots for transcription-replication conflicts and breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements in B lymphocytes; hence, elucidating the molecular events involved in rectifying replication stress at ERFSs will be critical to better understanding the drivers of genomic instability (Barlow et al., 2013).\n\nThe robust transcriptional upregulation of p53 signaling and apoptosis gene programs coupled with the de-enrichment of gene sets related to G2/M checkpoint progression, E2F targets, and MYC targets in activated DKO cells is consistent with the cell cycle and survival perturbations exhibited by these cells. Cellular stresses including DSBs trigger the p53 stress response that entails global transcriptional inhibition with activation of specific gene programs to induce metabolic rewiring, DNA damage repair, G1 and G2 arrests, apoptosis, and senescence (Levine, 2020). Although the loss of GEN1 and MUS81 has not been directly linked to the downregulation of MYC signaling, the DNA damage response activated in the DKO cells causes the accumulation of p53 protein, resulting in elevated p53 binding to an enhancer element within a MYC super-enhancer and consequent repression of Myc mRNA transcription (Porter et al., 2017). Moreover, p53 can directly impact the expression of Myc via other transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. p53 can activate the transcription of the long noncoding RNA Pvt1b to suppress in cis Myc transcription (Olivero et al., 2020). miR-34 family and miR-145 are transcriptional targets of p53 and they contribute to the silencing of Myc expression by eliciting the degradation of Myc mRNA transcripts (He et al., 2007; Sachdeva et al., 2009). Other transcriptional targets of p53, including PTEN, TSC2, and AMPKβ, can impinge on MYC expression via their inhibition of the upstream regulator mTORC1 complex (Cui et al., 2021; Levine, 2020). These MYC-counteracting mechanisms are crucial to the proper enforcement of p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our genetic study showed that the loss of p53 was insufficient to rescue the abrogated GC response and proliferative expansion of DKO B cells. Though p53 deletion did prevent apoptosis of ex vivo-activated DKO B cells early on, this survival benefit was only temporary as the p53-null DKO B cells experienced much higher level of cell death at later time points. We infer that the absence of p53 precludes the DKO p53-KO cells from arresting their cell cycle despite incurring extensive replication-associated DNA damage, leading to mitotic catastrophe and their eventual demise.\n\nOur study presents the first evidence that the ablation of both GEN1 and MUS81 induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), most likely attributed to the elevated levels of micronuclei in the DKO cells (Sarbajna et al., 2014). Primary human fibroblast cells lacking the BLM dissolvase exhibit an enhanced ISG gene expression signature due to the increased level of cytoplasmic DNA and cGAS-positive micronuclei in these cells, suggesting a common transcriptional outcome in cells that fail to eliminate recombination-associated structures (Gratia et al., 2019). Micronuclei are formed when chromosomal fragments or lagging chromosomes—manifestations of mitotic or DNA repair defects—become enveloped in a rupture-prone nuclear membrane after failing to be incorporated into the nucleus after mitosis (Miller et al., 2021). Recognition of the micronuclei by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) triggers the catalytic production of the second messenger cyclic 2′3′-GMP-AMP (2′3′-cGAMP), promoting the phosphorylation of the adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that mediates the activation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to drive the transcription of ISGs (Harding et al., 2017; Li and Chen, 2018; Mackenzie et al., 2017). Production and release of chromatin fragments from spontaneously ruptured micronuclei and from improper degradation of nascent DNA at unprotected, stalled replication forks further contribute to the cytosolic pool of immunostimulatory DNA fragments (Coquel et al., 2018; Dou et al., 2017; Emam et al., 2022; Glück et al., 2017; Ragu et al., 2020). DNA-stimulated type I IFN signaling, besides promoting the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, triggers various cell death programs including apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagic cell death (Paludan et al., 2019). Recent evidence in T cells, however, suggests that p53 signaling can be directly activated by STING via cyclic dinucleotides to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis independent of type I IFN production (Concepcion et al., 2022). We speculate that the cytoplasm of the DKO B cells could accumulate a panoply of self-DNA materials that fosters the production of 2′3-cGAMP and type I IFNs, initiating multiple cell death pathways simultaneously. This raises the question as to whether the cGAS-STING cascade comprises a secondary cell death signaling axis in the SSE-null cells, and whether micronucleated DKO B cells could elicit cell death in neighboring cells through the paracrine release of 2′3′-cGAMP and type I IFNs, given that macrophages and T cells can import 2′3′-cGAMP via the heteromeric anion channels LRRC8A-LRRC8E and LRRC8A-LRRC8C, respectively, to activate STING and type I IFN production (Concepcion et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2020). Future studies examining the impact of cGAS or STING inhibition on the viability DKO B cells will be warranted to assess the role of these factors in DNA-stimulated intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways.\n\nWe posit that the illegitimate processing of branched DNA structures and the persistence of unresolved HR intermediates generated following replication fork stalling and recombination-mediated fork restart in proliferating B cells lacking GEN1 and MUS81 lead to the manifestation of aberrant mitotic structures including chromatin bridges, HR-UFBs, and micronuclei that enable rampant fusions of broken chromosomes and amplification of replication-derived DNA damage during the next cell cycle. Our studies show that such extensive chromosomal instability and genomic damage consequently activate p53-dependent G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Concurrently, these endonuclease-deficient B cells exhibit a type I IFN transcriptional signature, potentially a ramification of high levels of cytoplasmic self-DNA. The synthetic lethality of GEN1 and MUS81 deficiencies in B cells highlights the essentiality of SSEs in eliminating branched and joint DNA intermediates formed during replication, recombination, and repair events to safeguard the genomic integrity of proliferating cells and to confer the proliferative and survival capacities required for the proper development and functionality of B lymphocytes, and possibly other immune cells.\n\n11: e77073.\n\nDecision letter\n\nWolf-Dietrich Heyer, Reviewing Editor\n\nWolf-Dietrich Heyer, University of California, Davis United States ;\n\nReviewed by Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, Reviewer\n\nWolf-Dietrich Heyer\n\nUniversity of California, Davis United States\n\nFind articles by Wolf-Dietrich Heyer\n\nOur editorial process produces two outputs: (i) public reviews designed to be posted alongside the preprint for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This terminology mischaracterizes the enzymes and inherently limits the type of DNA substrates that may be involved here. GEN1 can cleave HJs but also has a very broad substrate spectrum cleaving many types of branched and junction DNA molecules. MUS81 by itself is inactive, it requires EME1 to become a functional nuclease. MUS81-EME1 cannot cleave HJs, only in the context of the tri-nuclease SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, XPF-ERCC1. While I suspect the authors use this terminology as a shorthand and are aware of these complexities, many readers are not and will be misled. For this reason, the terminology, description, and discussion of these enzymes should be more precise. Both enzymes are structure-selective endonucleases. Just focusing on the HJ intermediate is also too narrow, as SDSA does not involve HJs and may be relevant here. MUS81-EME1 can cleave D-loops, another central HR intermediate, which may be of significance here. For these reasons, the concluding sentence of the introduction (line 135 ff) and many other passages should be rephrased to broaden the discussion of which specific molecular defects (dHJ resolution, other junction substrates, including stalled replication forks, etc.) underlie the observed phenotypes.\n\nNote in Line 106, also MUS81-EME1 can cleave replication fork-type substrates.\n\n2) The Mus81 flox allele should be described in more detail to indicate what exactly is predicted to be deleted in the encoded protein.\n\n3) The results from the cell cycle analysis underline the indispensable role of GEN1 and MUS81 in supporting proliferation of activated B lymphocytes. These conclusions disregard another potentially interesting observation. The peak of the double knock-out splenocytes accumulated at 0 cell divisions (Figure 3B) is interpreted as cells that have not divided. How does deletion of proteins that participate in late homologous recombination repair affect the initiation of cell division? Could the authors provide a possible explanation?\n\n4) Figure 5: The data presented on DNA damage are not convincing. It is the primary evidence that defective HR resolution is the cause, i.e. breaks at the same place on both sister arms. The images provided with damage classifications can be interpreted to either be different types of damage or undamaged chromosomes:\n\na) The picture labeled exchange can be caused by metaphase dropping – chromosome arms lay over each other does not mean that crossover occurred. It appears to be a radial or radial-like chromosome fusion.\n\nb) The image labeled acentric is not an acentric chromosome, rather it is 2 chromosomes with 2 centromeres – the twin telomere foci in the middle look like the acrocentric arms at the centromere. Again, it is likely a fusion/damage event but appears to have a centromere by DNA + telomere staining.\n\nc) The chromosome labeled dicentric has only one centromere at the top – again the twin telomere dots label the acrocentric arms at the centromere.\n\nA commercially available centromere probe would aid with chromosome rearrangement analyses.\n\nThe interpretation in the manuscript relies heavily on published results to support the claim that the DKO mice are suffering from defective double Holliday junction (dHJ) resolution. However, if a dHJ persisted into mitosis without being resolved, why would this manifest as a chromosome break in a metaphase chromosome spread where the spindle has been destabilized with colcemid to \"trap\" cells in mitosis? Rather chromosome arms should be intertwined at the dHJ site which may not be visible at all, or visible as a \"pinch\" in the chromosome (picture 5F top left may actually be this, the \"pinch\" looking like a break -the DNA may be decondensed because of a HJ/dHJ?). This may be visible in the spreads: there are 4 chromosomes with this gap in them on both arms in Figure 5A. The HJ/dHJ and resulting UFB would only snap and create a \"true\" DSB on both sisters in anaphase when the spindle pulls the two sisters apart.\n\nAn increase in chromosome breaks is also a hallmark of defective NHEJ – double-strand breaks occurring in G1 are not repaired and then replicated leading to a chromosome break at same places on the sister. While this is unlikely for Gen1/Mus81-deficient cells, it is still formally possible.\n\n5) Western Blot or genomic DNA analysis are necessary to assess the efficiency of Cre-mediated gene deletion in the different bone marrow cell populations. Deletion may be incomplete due to the late stage at which it acts and explain why germinal centers cells are only reduced ~2-fold in Figure 2A? The discussion regarding germinal center B cells independent of GEN1-MUS81 expression could be expanded.\n\n6) The discussion of the results of the RNA-Seq analysis should be expanded. One of the most significantly downregulated pathways in the RNA-Seq are related to MYC targets. How does the deletion of the two resolvases connect to MYC?\n\n7) The results of the RNA-Seq study are poorly discussed. While there is a clear experimental follow up on p53 pathway and apoptosis activation, What are the possible implications or causes of the interferon α response upregulation?\n\nReviewer #1 (Comments for the Authors):\n\nEssential revision\n\n1) The authors refer to GEN1 and MUS81 as Holliday junction resolvases.

In reference to point 1 above, it would be of interest to see the consequences of p53 deficiency on the accumulation of the undivided population.\n\n3) On the same line, one of the most significantly downregulated pathways in the RNA-Seq are related to MYC targets.

Do these cells exhibit reduced replication fork progression by DNA fiber analysis and/or activation of replication stress checkpoints (ATR / Chk1 phosphorylation)?"
