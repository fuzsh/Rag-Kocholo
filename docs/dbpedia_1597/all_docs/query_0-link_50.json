        "text": "Júlia is kind to the children and empathetic with complicated situations with the little ones. I appreciate her flexibility in taking the necessary time with my children’s hehehehe.\n\nMy twins posed for her two years in her third and fourth birthdays, they just hugged her, they felt comfortable. Today we live in the US but I certainly hope to be close to her again to be able to have more works of art from her hand.\n\nI received the work done as what it is… A magnificent work of art.\n\nI decided to do the photo session with Júlia, because I saw her work she did with my niece and I really liked it. She took photos of my eldest and youngest son, and they were spectacular, the unbeatable treatment, the affection, and of course the work.\n\nUpon receiving the photos, hair stood on end, a great reflection of her dedication of that special and magical day. I thank her for her professionalism and for being the way she is.\n\nI will repeat soon.\n\nThank you Júlia for immortalizing moments, smiles, …\n\nWe didn’t like the typical communion photos and I found Júlia by chance on Instagram. Seeing her photos, we were amazed at how beautiful and original they were, nothing to do with what we have seen so far.\n\nIt was a great experience; we had a great family afternoon to remember.\n\nEveryone has said that the photos are beautiful and very original in unique landscapes.\n\nBoth Julia and Merche are great with children. We would choose her again, without a doubt."
