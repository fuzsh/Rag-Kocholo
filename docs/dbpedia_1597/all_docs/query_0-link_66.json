They can also be a great source of motivation, providing support through active online communities.\n\nAnd if you need some help on the fitness front, the best weight loss apps are equipped with on-demand workouts from top trainers that you can do right at home.

Entering a calorie deficit can lead to weight loss, which can be done by safely eating less calories or exercising to burn calories. You can log your calories, learn healthy recipes, follow workouts, and log your exercise to track your progress. Just make sure you talk with your doctor before making any sudden changes to your diet and lifestyle, and it’s best to avoid weight loss apps if you have a history of disordered eating.\n\nMeet the experts: Rebecca Gahan, C.P.T., and owner of Kick@55 Fitness in Chicago; and Brooke Zigler, R.D.N., L.D.; Angel Planells, M.S., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and National Media Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics; and Jim White, R.D.N., A.C.S.M., exercise physiologist and the owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios.\n\nSo, if you’re looking for a little extra support in meeting your goals, read on for the only health and fitness apps worth downloading right now.\n\nThe best weight loss apps\n\nMyFitnessPal\n\nPrice: Free with in-app purchases\n\nOperating system: and Android\n\nThis weight loss app has an overall 4.7 rating out of five stars for its simple design and 360-degree approach to overall health. The app helps you learn more about your eating habits and teaches you how to make smarter nutrition habits, with a database of over 14 million foods, food tracking tools, a barcode scanner, water log, and more.\n\n“If you are wanting to start your journey into getting healthy but feel overwhelmed with the idea of meal tracking I’d highly suggest this app!” one reviewer wrote. “The fact that you can just scan the barcode and then input the serving size makes it so easy!”\n\nPros:\n\nLarge database of food calories\n\nBarcode scanner\n\nCompatible with other fitness apps\n\nCons:\n\nSome reviewers say it underestimates users’ calorie requirements\n\nWW (Weight Watchers)\n\nPrice: Free trial with in-app purchases\n\nOperating system: and Android\n\nWW, previously known as Weight Watchers, is one of the most famous weight loss programs—so it comes as no surprise that its app does an excellent job at inspiring and teaching users to make nutritious choices. You can track your food and fitness progress and even chat with others in the community for motivation and support, says Rebecca Gahan, C.P.T. and owner of Kick@55 Fitness in Chicago. Plus, the app connects to smart devices like watches to track movement.\n\nAn iOS reviewer raved, “With the Weight Watchers App I am already becoming very successful with over 5 pounds of weight lost on my goal to lose 60 pounds. The app is extremely user friendly in every way! There is even a scanner that scans the food label and you can find out how many points each food item is. There is a tremendous amount of social media-related groups as well where I find fantastic support, recipes, and encouragement! For the price of using the app it is a steal! Truly remarkable!”\n\nPros:\n\nBarcode scanner\n\nCan see calories of meals at restaurants\n\nFood and fitness tracker\n\nCons:\n\nCan be costly\n\nNoom\n\nPrice: $70 per month\n\nOperating system: and Android\n\nNoom is an app that encourages daily behavior changes for long-term weight loss and focuses on fitness and nutrition to help users “stop dieting,” according to the company. The program uses psychology-based approaches to foster healthy habits and offers a team of health experts and coaches to guide you, per the company. The app also offers custom programs for those with medical conditions like type 2 diabetes or heart disease.\n\n“I’ve been with Noom for a month now and I’m really enjoying the platform. The information they give you is broken down into easily digestible groups, their approach to weight loss is different than anything I’ve tried before,” wrote on iOS user. “There is the calorie tracking element, water intake tracking, steps taken, all that stuff but, it’s more there for you to see how you are progressing instead of being drilled into your head that you have to do all those things without fail everyday to see success. I’m down 10 pounds as of this morning and I’m very pleased with that.”\n\nPros:\n\nPrograms for different health conditions\n\nHealthy recipes available\n\nUses psychology to understand your eating patterns\n\nCons:\n\nPricey\n\nFooducate\n\nPice: Free with in-app purchases\n\nOperating system: and Android\n\nFooducate aims to educate you about the food you eat by grading each item by its quality—helping you truly understand what you’re putting in your body and how to read nutrition labels.

You can also personalize your experience with a number of eating plan programs including low FODMAP, keto, low-carb, heart health, and more.\n\nAn iOS reviewer wrote, “I’m a nutritionally illiterate 40-year-old with terrible eating habits. I like everything I’m not supposed to eat, and I sometimes feel like I hate all healthy options. I was overjoyed to discover that this app existed — and links with Apple Health — to give me much-needed insight and feedback into my eating habits so I can make some adjustments to my diet.”\n\nPros:\n\n50k healthy recipes\n\nProvides info on nutrition\n\nBarcode scanner\n\nCons:\n\nSome reviewers report a faulty barcode scanner\n\nLose It!\n\nPrice: Free with in-app purchases\n\nOperating system: and Android\n\nGoal-setting is one of the most important aspects of a weight loss plan, and Lose It! gives users the tools to set the measures that are right for them. The app includes a custom daily calorie budget, plus a barcode scanner and food database to give you an accurate idea of the calorie and nutrient content of every meal.

Before downloading an app or paying for a subscription, Angel Planells, M.S., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and national media spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics, says to consider if the app does a good job of tracking food intake, allows for exercise input, syncs with any fitness watch you already own, and how complex it is to use. He also says to consider if “it will provide the data you need to help motivate you to persevere on your weight journey.” Here are some more details on these tips to keep in mind while downloading an app for weight loss:\n\nDecide what you want to track: The main purpose of most weight loss apps is to track what you eat. However, some apps have more options than just calories, allowing you to track macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat). This is ideal for people looking to build muscle, follow a keto diet, or ensure they’re eating enough protein.\n\nConsider your exercise goals: If you know you strongly dislike cardio, you’re not going to get much use out of an app like Strava, Peloton, or AllTrails. Before you pay for a subscription with a fitness app, think about what type of exercise you will stick to and that you enjoy. Whether it’s weightlifting, hiking, yoga, or running—there’s an app out there for you.\n\nLook at the app’s resources: Does it provide recipe ideas? Does the app have workout and training plans? Or, does it work more as a digital journal for logging workouts and calories? Think if you’re looking for a place to log information or a resource of guides and information.\n\nConsider the price: Most of these apps are free of charge, but many come with premium memberships or subscription options. These paid plans typically offer more resources, but some you can most certainly use without paying extra. Try downloading a collection of free apps (calorie counting, running tracker, meal planning) to have everything you need on your phone, rather than relying on just one app.\n\nChoose an app with a simple design: It may sound obvious, but sometimes an app with a ton of bells and whistles can make things more complicated and frustrating. Opt for an app that has an easy-to-use design. The goal is to use it consistently, so it’s best to keep it simple.\n\nWho should not use weight loss apps?\n\nWhile there may not be specific people who should use weight loss apps, there are definitely some individuals who should not use them. Planells advises children and teenagers to not use weight loss apps. “This is a time of life where individuals are growing, and the apps can inadvertently teach growing teens and kids to restrict food intake or the potential to start dieting and may lead to future disordered eating,” Planells says.\n\nPeople with a history of eating disorders should also avoid weight loss apps, especially ones that track calories. “The unfortunate side effect of using these apps is people are focusing on the numbers, their diet can become very restrictive, the app is providing feedback on a constant basis, and there ends up being a competitive aspect which can lead to compulsion,” Planells says.\n\nEven those without a history of disordered eating should stay mindful, and check in with themselves regularly about how they are feeling mentally and physically while using weight loss apps. Planells explains that someone may stop eating early in the day because they reached their maximum calorie intake, but this can lead to malnutrition, body dysmorphia, and injuries. “If a patient finds themselves becoming obsessed with the numbers, a diet app may do more harm than good,” White says. “Some app users may become too focused on calorie counting or weight tracking and begin to have obsessive thoughts or guilt about consuming ‘bad’ foods.’”\n\nIf you find yourself feeling fatigued, lightheaded, or weak, you may not be eating enough throughout the day. It’s always a good idea to check with your doctor and meet with a registered dietitian to ensure you are not being too restrictive and fueling your body properly.\n\nAre weight loss apps helpful?\n\nFor many, logging calories and exercise can be beneficial for their weight loss journey. But, if you have a history of disordered eating or a strained relationship with food, weight loss apps can do more harm than good. It’s best to speak with a registered dietitian and/or your healthcare provider to find the best plan for you.\n\nSome fitness or weight loss apps focus on physical activity, which is also a large proponent in losing weight. However, simply tracking physical activity or following workout plans is not necessarily the end-all-be-all to losing weight. The real key to weight loss is consistency. Jim White, R.D.N., A.C.S.M., exercise physiologist and the owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios, says he believes weight loss apps will only work if they teach you sustainable habits. “If they are used in the right way and promote healthy routines, then these apps can be a great resource or tool to provide accountability, motivation, and structure to patients who are looking to lose weight,” White says.\n\nIf apps like Strava help motivate you to go on a run and log mileage, or if AllTrails encourages you to go on a rigorous hike, then that can be helpful in your weight loss journey. Physical fitness apps can be used as motivation and inspiration, but it’s your own dedication that will help you achieve your goals.\n\nHow do you use a weight loss app?\n\nA weight loss app can be used in a variety of ways, depending on its tools and resources. “I think that the most important aspect of a weight loss app in helping someone attain their goals is the calorie balance element,” White says. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), weight gain stems from eating more calories than your body is using. A healthy and safe calorie deficit can help you lose weight, and logging what you eat in an app allows you to keep track of your daily calorie intake.\n\n“I think the best part of the apps (if you want to use them) is that it provides feedback and allows you to assess how you are doing when it comes to eating and activity,” Planells says. “It is making you aware of how you are doing, and there are always opportunities for improvement.” For example, you may see you are not eating enough vegetables and add more to your next meal.\n\nPlanells advises to not focus too much on the number on the scale. Instead, he encourages checking in with your mental state, physical fitness, sleep patterns, and quality of life. If you notice you’re particularly tired one day, and you’ve been tracking your meals, you can see if you were lacking in any macronutrients or did not eat enough calories. On the flip side, you can also gauge if you’re in a brighter mood on days you work out.\n\nWho should use weight loss apps?\n\nAlmost anyone with a smartphone can use a weight loss app and White says there is no certain person that should use weight loss apps. Someone who is looking to lose weight through dieting can use an app with a calorie tracker or meal planning element. Those with exercise and fitness goals can use apps to follow workout programs or track their physical activity. Overall, anyone with health and wellness goals can use weight loss apps, but certain apps will make more sense for different people.\n\nIf you’re wondering whether or not you should use a weight loss app, speak with your doctor about weight management and your health.\n\nHow we chose the best weight loss apps\n\nWe consulted expert input from Rebecca Gahan, C.P.T., and owner of Kick@55 Fitness in Chicago; Brooke Zigler, R.D.N., L.D.; Angel Planells, M.S., R.D.N., registered dietitian nutritionist and National Media Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition & Dietetics; and Jim White, R.D.N., A.C.S.M., exercise physiologist and the owner of Jim White Fitness & Nutrition Studios to narrow down the best weight loss apps.
