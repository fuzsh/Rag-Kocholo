        "text": "Healthy and Fit | Tip of the Week\n\nPosted by JCC Pittsburgh on August 8, 2024\n\nEver feel like you’re having your own personal energy crisis? Like you just can’t quite figure out how to boost your energy to get through the day?\n\nWe get it. Life is busy. With work, kids, family, tending to the house, and volunteer or other commitments, you may find energy in short supply.\n\nAnd as much as you try to get enough sleep, sometimes, the hours don’t add up. That’s when you find yourself trudging through an eternal afternoon, wondering how to get more energy.\n\nWe’ve pulled together seven tips, hacks, and surprisingly simple things you can do to increase natural energy. Some of these natural energy boosters may require some planning ahead. But others require no equipment or trips to the grocery store.\n\n1. Exercise (Yes, Really)\n\nForcing your body to move more when you feel most fatigued can seem counterintuitive. But that’s exactly the right time to do it.\n\nResearch has shown that exercise is beneficial for mitochondrial health. Mitochondria are organelles — special compartments in our cells — that convert energy from food into adenosine triphospate (ATP), which are the packets of energy our body uses. Think of mitochondria as miniature generators: They create the energy that fuels your cells, which, in turn, fuels your body. They use both glucose and oxygen to do this.\n\nSo, as you exercise, you breathe more. This increased breathing gets more oxygen circulating inside your body, which makes you feel more alert. It also helps the mitochondria keep making more energy.\n\nIt’s a win-win.\n\nUnsurprisingly, a 2022 Frontiers in Psychology study found that people who regularly did moderate exercise:\n\nFelt less fatigued.\n\nFelt more energetic.\n\nFelt more vital.\n\nWe also know from other research that exercise can benefit people with chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\nRegular exercise is your best friend when it comes to increasing energy levels in general. But to wake up in the moment, try these things:\n\nDo exercises in your desk chair (like leg lifts, shoulder shrugs, and stretches).\n\nRun up and down a set of stairs (just make sure you have the right footwear).\n\nTake a 10-minute fitness class online (there are plenty of paid and free apps that offer classes).\n\nTake a walk around the block. (Bonus points if it’s cold because frigid air can wake you up. Also, sunlight can help you feel more alert.)\n\n2. Take a Microbreak\n\nWe know what you’re thinking: You just told me to exercise! Now you’re saying to take a break when I’m tired?\n\nBut sometimes, two things are true at once. Exercise can boost mood and energy but so can a well-timed, five-minute (or less) pause. This isn’t the same as a nap (though some people swear by naps to help with energy).\n\nTo take your break, find a place where you can sit or lie undisturbed at home or at work. Turn off notifications or silence your phone. And breathe — big, full, deep breaths.\n\nIf listening to music relaxes you, do that. Or enjoy some silence if that’s what you need. Some people may also enjoy sitting in child’s pose for their microbreak.\n\nTaking short breaks a few times a day can help give you a small boost to keep going.\n\n3. Drink Water (Avoid Alcohol)\n\nDid you know that dehydration can cause fatigue? Though there are many energy drinks and powders you can mix into water, you don’t always need them.\n\nThirst can sneak up on you. By the time you feel thirsty, you’re already on your way to dehydration. Drink water as soon as you feel thirsty and keep a water bottle with you.\n\nHere’s what isn’t helpful to drink when you feel tired: alcohol. In fact, drinking alcohol can increase feelings of fatigue. Drinking alcohol can also interfere with your sleep.\n\n4. Chew Gum\n\nPsychology researchers broke people into two groups to study a nine-minute lesson. One group chewed gum, and the other didn’t. Then they tested everyone on what they studied.\n\nThe people who chewed gum did better on the test than the non-chewers. They also reported feeling more alert after the test.\n\nDoes this mean you should go out and buy gum in bulk? Not necessarily. But perhaps it’s worth a try as a quick pick-me-up.\n\n5. Sing a Song\n\nWe know from research on group singing that singing together with others helps forge emotional bonds. But singing all by yourself has its benefits, too.\n\nFirst of all, singing increases breathing. This extra oxygen helps deliver more oxygenated blood all over your body. That alone can help increase alertness.\n\nWhen you sing, your brain also releases endorphins and oxytocin. These are your body’s “feel good” chemicals. And it does feel good to belt it out — cathartic, even.\n\nSo when the sleepiness hits, break into song.\n\n6. Try Aromatherapy\n\nThere’s a reason that people used to use smelling salts to rouse someone. You don’t have to try anything that drastic, though. You can use essential oils — either breathing them or rubbing them on your skin.\n\nPeppermint (or any type of mint smell) may increase alertness. Researchers have actually tested combinations of aromas to see which help boost energy.\n\nA 2022 Elsevier study focused on women who’d had COVID. It found that a specific blend helped increase energy in these women. The blend contained:\n\nClove bud\n\nFrankincense\n\nOrange\n\nThyme\n\nUltimately, you have to find an aroma you enjoy. Experiment with essential oils, diffusers, candles, and wax melts.\n\n7. Stock Your Pantry with Energizing Foods\n\nWhen your energy dips, reaching for a bag of chips or a sugary drink can prove tempting. But with some planning, you can reach for healthier alternatives.\n\nTo avoid a sugar rush (followed by a crash), pair lean protein with complex carbs. This helps to slow down how your body absorbs sugar.\n\nFor example, try whole-grain pita chips and hummus. Or whole-grain crackers with a piece of cheese.\n\nNotice when your energy dip happens during the day. For many people, adding some protein early in the day can help even out energy. Good protein options to add to breakfast include nuts and nut butter, eggs, yogurt, or avocado slices.\n\nOther foods that may offer a natural energy boost include:\n\nBananas\n\nDark chocolate\n\nPopcorn\n\nOranges\n\nTart cherries\n\nHealthy and Fit | Tip\n\nWHY AM I CRAVING SUGAR? | Rachel Sproat, RD, UPMC Nutrition Services\n\nIs dessert your favorite food group? Have you ever wondered, “Why do I crave sugar?” or “Why am I craving sweets all the time?” If so, you’re not alone.\n\nWhen it comes to food cravings, sugar is at the top of the list for many people. It’s a tasty treat, but too much, too often, can become a problem. Learn the surprising reasons behind sugar cravings and tips to help you curb your sugar habit.\n\nIs Sugar Addiction Real?\n\nMany people swear they have a sugar addiction and can’t live without sweets. However, sugar isn’t quite as powerful as addictive drugs, so it’s unlikely to cause dependency.\n\nStill, there is no denying that sugary foods taste good. And for many people, sugar increases feelings of happiness, pleasure, and reward. It sparks “feel good” chemicals like serotonin and dopamine in your brain.\n\nIf sweets taste good and make you feel good, it’s tempting to eat them more often. Once you develop a sugar habit, it’s often hard to break. Understanding the power of sugar is an important step to overcoming your cravings.\n\nThe Problem With Too Much Sugar\n\nSugar isn’t necessarily bad for you. It supplies your body with glucose, an essential nutrient that fuels every cell in your body.\n\nVarious forms of sugar occur naturally in fruits, vegetables, milk, and natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup. These natural sugars provide energy plus vital nutrients to fuel your body.\n\nBut food manufacturers also add sugar to many foods, from cereals to salad dressings, yogurt, and, of course, sweets. Added sugar doesn’t provide nutritional benefits, but it makes many packaged foods taste better. Eventually, you get used to the sweeter taste and crave more.\n\nThe Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends limiting added sugar to no more than 10 percent of your daily calories. If you eat 2,000 calories a day, aim to keep added sugar below 200 calories or 50 grams daily. Food manufacturers list added sugar on the nutrition facts label.\n\nIf you crave sweets, it’s easy to surpass your daily added sugar goal. Over time, too much sugar has adverse effects on your body and brain. It can cause or worsen these problems:\n\nCognitive decline, memory problems, and dementia.\n\nExcess weight gain and obesity.\n\nFatty liver disease.\n\nHeart disease.\n\nInsulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nMood disorders like anxiety and depression.\n\nNutrient deficiencies if sugary foods replace a healthy diet.\n\nCommon Reasons for Sugar Cravings\n\nBesides the fact that sugar tastes good, you might crave it for these reasons:\n\nIt’s comforting. Many people turn to sweets when they’re sad or depressed because sugar provides a short-term boost in feelings of happiness and pleasure.\n\nIt provides a quick energy boost. If you don’t eat enough throughout the day, you may crave sugar in the late afternoon or evening. Your body requires glucose when blood sugar drops and sugary foods or drinks can raise your blood glucose quickly.\n\nIt’s a habit. If you crave something sweet after a meal, it’s likely because you’re in the habit of eating dessert. The same is true if you stop to buy a donut or a sweet coffee drink every morning on the way to work.\n\nIt raises serotonin, a brain chemical that affects your mood. Extended periods of darkness in the winter can decrease serotonin levels in some people, causing the winter blues. Sugar and other forms of carbohydrates help increase serotonin levels.\n\nIt’s that time of the month. Hormones fluctuate throughout your menstrual period. For some women, premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms can include sugar cravings.\n\nYou’re not sleeping enough. Lack of sleep or poor sleep quality can wreak havoc with your hunger hormones. Even occasional sleep deprivation causes higher levels of ghrelin, the hormone that triggers hunger, and lower levels of leptin, the satiety hormone. Many people crave sugary foods in the morning to satisfy that hunger.\n\nOften, a combination of these factors causes or worsens sugar cravings.\n\nHow to Stop Sugar Cravings\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all solution to curbing sugar cravings. Nutritionists often recommend starting with the following strategies to see what works best for you:\n\nAim for seven to nine hours of quality sleep each night. Get in bed earlier so you can unwind, and turn off all blue-light devices at least one hour before bedtime.\n\nDon’t skip meals or snacks. Eating every three to four hours keeps your stomach full and blood sugar balanced. That makes it easier to say no to sugar. If you eat two or three large meals daily, try eating three smaller meals with snacks in between.\n\nEat balanced meals and snacks. Your body digests sugar and carbohydrate-rich foods quickly. Including some protein and healthy fat with each meal and snack slows digestion and keeps you fuller for longer. Balance meals and snacks with protein from lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, or Greek yogurt, and fat from nuts or avocado.\n\nExercise regularly — ideally outside in the fresh air and sunshine. Exercise provides the same emotional boost as sugar. It also counteracts many of the adverse effects of excess sugar while promoting a healthy weight, heart, and blood sugar levels.\n\nOpt for whole foods with complex carbohydrates. Highly processed foods, like fast foods, frozen dinners, or packaged snacks often contain added sugar or refined carbohydrates and can worsen cravings. Instead, choose fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and beans for your carbohydrates.\n\nRevamp your habits and lifestyle to avoid sugar temptation. Keep sweets out of your house, stock up on healthy snacks like fruit and yogurt, and brush your teeth immediately after a meal.\n\nBehavior change takes time and practice, so go slowly. Make one or two small changes at a time and build on them.\n\nAlso, consider working with a nutritionist, behavioral health therapist, or health coach. Having a support network can increase your chances of conquering your sugar cravings.\n\nBENEFITS OF WALKING: HOW A DAILY WALK CAN IMPROVE YOUR HEALTH | Andrew Robert Eckert, Internal Medicine, UPMC\n\nWhat if there was one simple activity you could do each day that carried dozens of health benefits? An activity that only required a pair of shoes and a good attitude?\n\nWe’re talking, of course, about taking a daily walk.\n\nWalking is the most popular exercise for Americans and with good reason. The health benefits of a daily walk are numerous. From lowering blood pressure to boosting mood, walking can bring positive changes to both your mind and body.\n\nHere are the top 10 benefits of walking.\n\n1. Helps You Meet Exercise Guidelines The Centers for Disease Control recommends that you get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week. That number can feel like a lot when you look at it as a whole.\n\nBut it’s just 30 minutes, 5 days a week. Or a little over 20 minutes every day. A daily walking practice can help you meet, and even surpass, the guidelines.\n\nPeople often wonder: Is walking the same as running, when it comes to health? Walking and running each carry mental and physical benefits. But for many people, walking is more accessible than running because it’s easier on your joints.\n\nHowever, even if you’re an avid runner, don’t discount the magic of adding in a daily walk!\n\n2. Helps Reduce Your Risk for Many Diseases A daily walk of 20 minutes or more helps lower your blood pressure. When you lower your blood pressure, you reduce your risk of developing:\n\nHeart disease.\n\nStroke.\n\nDiabetes.\n\nSeveral types of cancer.\n\nIn fact, research from the American Heart Association found that walking just 1,000 extra steps could increase your life span. By analyzing several studies, researchers found a link between steps and mortality. Every 1,000-step increase gave people a 22% lower chance of dying from all causes.\n\nWalking can also lower your risk for sleep apnea, reflux disease, and depression. The numbers are clear: The more steps you take each day, the healthier your body will be.\n\n3. Helps Lower Blood Sugar People living with diabetes need to constantly be aware of their blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels. Taking a daily walk is a great way to keep blood sugar in check.\n\nIn fact, newer research has found that taking a walk after a meal helps improve blood sugar even more. A 2022 review study in the journal Sports Medicine examined seven studies about how walking could impact measures of heart health. Blood sugar levels are a common measure of heart health.\n\nLooking at the data, researchers found that one of the benefits of walking after a meal is to control blood sugar levels. Even just five minutes of walking helped. So, if you’re trying to decide what time of day to take your walk, consider doing it post-meal.\n\n4. Helps Strengthen Bones and Muscles Walking forces you to use muscles you don’t necessarily use when going about your daily life. It engages your leg muscles, your lower back, and even your core.\n\nWalking is also a bone-building exercise. It helps strengthen joints by circulating more blood to your cartilage. The cartilage in your ankles, knees, and hips gets oxygen and nutrients from the circulating blood.\n\nEven just walking 10 minutes a day can help prevent disability and improve arthritis pain. Walking can also help prevent bone loss from osteoporosis. For women over the age of 65, this is especially important.\n\n5. Boosts Your Mood Walking helps release your body’s feel-good chemicals, like dopamine and endorphins. It’s one reason why a walk can help improve mental health.\n\nIn one study of younger adults, a 10-minute bout of brisk walking helped improve mood. It also helps improve mental well-being for older adults. In fact, some researchers are exploring the idea that walking is one of the best anti-aging strategies.\n\nAnd if you’re wondering where to walk to get the most mental benefit, consider heading to the woods. Scientists found that taking a 1-hour walk in nature actually changes (for the better) the part of the brain that processes stress. This stress-reduction effect wasn’t as strong for participants who walked in an urban area.\n\n6. Improves Your Immune System Walking gets all systems in your body moving. Blood and oxygen circulate more, and this increased blood flow helps improve immunity. It means you can eliminate waste products faster, allowing you to heal more quickly,\n\nWalking also increases the circulation of your white blood cells. White blood cells are the heroes of your immune system. An American College of Sports Medicine study found that 30 minutes of brisk walking helps the circulation of white blood cells.\n\n7. Helps You Sleep Better We know that tiring your body out with exercise helps you sleep better. But why?\n\nFor one, it helps boost your body’s sleep hormone, melatonin. There’s also a connection between walking and sleep quality. Research consistently finds that people who walk regularly sleep better.\n\nUltimately, it’s a chain reaction. Walking reduces stress, helps with chronic pain, and helps keep you from getting sick. All of these things add up to less nighttime disturbances\n\n8. Can Stimulate Creativity Have you ever been stuck trying to solve a problem, and you go for a walk, and suddenly, the answer becomes clear? You’re not imagining it!\n\nTaking a walk is one of the best ways to get your ideas flowing. Like showering or driving, it creates a state of openness or flow. The fresh air, the change of scenery, the increased blood flow: it moves you forward, in all the best ways.\n\n9. Helps Prevent Dementia We know that regular walking can help with memory decline and Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers have been trying to quantify just how much.\n\nAccording to a 2022 study in JAMA Neurology, increasing how many steps you take each day can cut your dementia risk. For the greatest benefit (a 50% reduction in dementia risk), study participants had to walk about 9,800 steps a day. But even 3,800 more steps reduced their risk by 25%.\n\n10. Helps You Make Other Lifestyle Changes Forming a healthy habit like daily walking is a great jump-start to achieve your other health goals. You gain confidence from your daily steps, and it helps create a sense of purpose.\n\nThe formula is simple: Put one foot in front of the other, day after day. Rinse, repeat, and be well.\n\nHOW TO TREAT ANXIETY NATURALLY | UPMC Health Beat\n\nWhat Is Anxiety? Anxiety is the body’s normal response to danger and other stressful situations. It affects your body and mind and prompts feelings of fear, dread, and worry.\n\nIt’s normal to feel anxious if you’re giving a speech, taking a test, or entering a new social situation. But anxiety can also be persistent and interfere with daily life. If you’re consistently feeling anxious or worried, your doctor may diagnose you with a generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).\n\nOther more severe anxiety disorders are panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nAccording to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the U.S. They affect about 40 million adults.\n\nWhether your anxiety is mild or severe, it can cause both physical and mental symptoms.\n\nSymptoms of anxiety include:\n\nAvoiding situations that create anxiety.\n\nChest pain.\n\nCompulsive behavior (constantly checking things).\n\nDizziness.\n\nFast or irregular heartbeat.\n\nFearing the worst will happen.\n\nFeeling overheated.\n\nFeeling tense or nervous.\n\nHaving trouble concentrating on tasks.\n\nHeadaches.\n\nInsomnia.\n\nIntrusive thoughts and memories.\n\nLoss of appetite.\n\nLoss of interest in hobbies or leisure time activities.\n\nNot being able to catch your breath.\n\nNot wanting to try new things.\n\nObsessive thoughts.\n\nShakiness.\n\nSweating.\n\nTrouble concentrating.\n\nTrouble maintaining friendships and other relationships.\n\nWorry about the past or future.\n\nHow to Treat Anxiety Naturally\n\nIf you suffer from GAD, your doctor may recommend medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Both approaches can help calm those with anxiety disorders.\n\nBut there are also steps you can take by yourself to relieve symptoms of anxiety. These lifestyle changes may be enough to help you feel better without medication.\n\nBuild downtime into your daily routine You can help manage anxious feelings by taking time for yourself each day. Whether it’s prayer, meditation, a soothing bath, or a walk in the woods — time to de-stress is an important part of your mental health.\n\nConnect with family and friends Being around other people in a positive setting can help you banish anxious thoughts. Talking about your feelings with trusted friends, family, or a counselor can also help put them in perspective.\n\nTake time to connect with friends and family on a regular basis. To build your social network, join a community group, worship center, or book club. Sometimes just being around other people can help you gain perspective on your worries.\n\nEat healthfully A diet of whole grains, lean meat, and fresh vegetables may not prevent anxiety but can help you combat it. Avoid eating sugar, white flour, and food that’s fried or full of preservatives. A poor diet can lead to mood swings and leave you feeling lethargic, run-down, and more prone to depression and anxiety.\n\nExercise regularly When your body feels better, your mind will too. Physical activity produces brain chemicals (endorphins) that act as natural painkillers.\n\nChoose an activity you enjoy, whether it’s swimming, jogging, dancing, or walking. Thirty minutes of cardiovascular exercise five times a week is ideal. But even a brisk 10-minute walk can improve your mood and help you feel more able to cope with stress.\n\nLimit alcohol and caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that can greatly increase feelings of anxiety and contribute to insomnia. Alcohol is a depressant but can also interfere with sleep and general feelings of well-being. Eliminating or cutting down on both can help you feel calmer and more in control of your worries.\n\nPractice deep breathing One of the simplest ways to calm anxiety is to take deep, slow breaths. By focusing on the process of inhaling and exhaling (which you normally don’t think about) you divert your mind from your anxiety. Deep breathing also stimulates the vagus nerve, which prompts a state of relaxation.\n\nPractice good sleep habits Your body and mind function best when you’re well-rested, but worry and fear can keep you up at night. Not getting enough sleep creates more anxiety, triggering a vicious cycle.\n\nConsistent sleep habits are key to a good night’s rest. They include:\n\nAvoiding any type of screen (TV, computer, phone) at least an hour before bedtime.\n\nAbstaining from caffeine and alcohol before bedtime.\n\nGoing to bed and waking up at the same time each day, including weekends.\n\nKeeping your bedroom cool and dark.\n\nNot using your bedroom for anything but sleep and sex.\n\nUnplug at regular intervals It’s great to know what’s happening in the world, but getting caught in a 24-hour news cycle can trigger anxiety. You may start to feel like the world is a terrible place and you can’t control anything. It’s better to take breaks (schedule them if you need to) and unplug completely.\n\nWhether it’s television news or social media, it’s also best to set overall limits on screen time, especially at night. The blue light from screens can reduce melatonin production, a hormone that makes you feel sleepy.\n\nWhen to See a Doctor for Anxiety Anxiety becomes a serious problem when it interferes with your everyday life. Worrisome thoughts may prevent you from going to work or school, or cause you to avoid social situations. Anxiety can affect personal relationships with friends and family.\n\nIf you’ve had consistent anxiety for six months or more, you should talk to your doctor. They may recommend medication, therapy, or treating your anxiety with natural methods. They may suggest a combination of those things as part of your treatment.\n\nThe good news is that there is help for every form of anxiety.\n\nYOUR GUIDE TO WHOLE GRAINS — AND WHY THEY’RE SO GOOD FOR YOU | Matthew Kadey, R.D., SilverSneakers\n\nIf you’re still mostly a white-bread person, it’s time to make the switch to whole-grain foods. The anti-aging reasons for doing so are hard to argue.\n\nThere wasn’t much talk about whole grains versus refined grains back in the day. We ate our Wonder® bread sandwiches for lunch and enjoyed them. But food science has changed a lot over the past few decades. The research is clear that whole grains of all stripes are nutritionally superior to their processed and paler cousins.\n\nIf you’ve been slow to make the switch, it’s a great time to hop aboard the whole-grain train. Food companies have been hard at work to make whole-grain products tastier and easier to find. Explore the health benefits — and flavor variety — that comes with adding more whole grains to your daily meals.\n\nWhat Makes a Whole Grain, Whole\n\nBy definition, a grain is considered whole if it still contains the original three parts of the seed: bran, germ, and endosperm.\n\nWith refined grains, like those found in white pasta, white rice, or all-purpose white flour, the bran and germ are stripped away when they are milled. This leaves behind only the starchy endosperm.\n\nWhy is that a bad thing? The bran and germ are where most of the fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants are found in grains. Those are the components of food that keep us feeling full or help protect us against disease. Many refined grain products are enriched with a handful of nutrients like folate and iron, but that doesn’t replace all the nutrition that is lost.\n\nDietary guidelines recommend that at least half of our daily grain servings should come from whole sources. But most Americans buy far more packaged food products made with refined grain ingredients than whole grains.\n\nThe Many Health Benefits of Whole Grains\n\nMaking the switch from refined grains to whole ones is a smart move for healthier living — even if you still eat some refined grains from time to time. Their impressive mix of nutrients have been shown to have a positive impact on the health conditions below:\n\nHeart Health\n\nA study of more than a million people in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that consuming whole grains instead of refined ones can lower the risk for heart disease and death by all causes.\n\nDiabetes\n\nResearchers at Harvard University discovered that eating more whole-grain foods, such as whole-grain breads and breakfast cereals, was significantly associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n\nCancer\n\nA diet that contains a larger proportion of whole grains can slash the risk for certain cancers, including colorectal and pancreatic, according to a study published in the journal\n\nBelly Fat\n\nResearch in the Journal of Nutrition found that older adults who consumed at least three servings of whole grains every day accumulated less belly fat than their peers who chose more foods that contained refined grains. Excess weight in the middle is linked to a higher risk of health problems including heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhich foods are whole grain?\n\nThere are a lot more of them than you probably realize. Expanding the variety of whole grains in your diet can expose you to a broader spectrum of nutrients. It also adds excitement to your meals through different colors, textures, shapes, and flavors. Use this list to add some new ones to your dietary repertoire:\n\nAmaranth\n\nBarley\n\nBlack (Forbidden) Rice\n\nBrown Rice\n\nBuckwheat\n\nBulgur\n\nEinkorn\n\nFarro\n\nFreekeh\n\nKamut\n\nKaniwa\n\nMillet\n\nOats\n\nQuinoa\n\nRye\n\nSorghum\n\nSpelt\n\nTeff\n\nTriticale\n\nWheat berries\n\nWild Rice\n\nWhere should I buy them?\n\nMost grocery stores carry a large variety of whole grains, both flours and intact grains. But if there is a bulk-food store in your area, that can be an affordable place to buy the exact amount you need.\n\nWhole grains stay fresh much longer than produce, but they’re still better when they haven’t lived in your pantry for too long. That’s because their outer layer, known as the germ, contains oils that go rancid over time. Most whole grains keep for about six months. Whole-grain flours last for about half that time but storing them in the refrigerator or freezer will extend that by a month or two.\n\nHow do I know of a product is made with whole grains?\n\nDon’t assume that a product is 100% whole grain until you investigate the product label. Many people are fooled into buying refined grains in disguise.\n\nLoafs touting things like “made with whole grains,” “7-grain,” “multi-grain” or “rye” are often made mostly with nutritionally inferior refined flour. Manufacturers may include some whole grains like whole wheat or whole rye flour in the mix, but the amount added is anyone’s guess.\n\nThe first item listed on the ingredient label should be a whole grain rather than “wheat flour” or “enriched flour.” That’s just another way of saying refined white flour. Ingredients are ordered from highest to lowest amounts in the package. Products with the FDA regulated label “100% whole grain” cannot include any refined flour.\n\nAre any of the whole grains better for me than others?\n\nWhile whole grains are all good for you, try to eat ones that are still wholly intact. They are even less processed and require more chewing and effort from the digestive system to break down. Research says this may improve your blood sugar levels.\n\nWhen you’re able, choose wheat berries (which look similar to brown rice) instead of whole wheat bread, steel-cut oats instead of rolled oats, and buckwheat groats (the hulled seed of buckwheat plant) instead of buckwheat flour pancakes.\n\nHow can I boost my whole grain intake?\n\nThere are seemingly endless and tasty ways to accomplish this nutritional goal. Here’s how to easily incorporate them into your regular mix of meals:\n\nUse brown rice or quinoa in stir-fries.\n\nAdd barley or spelt berries to soups.\n\nTry a side of farro or freekeh instead of potatoes.\n\nTuck into a bowl of steel-cut oat porridge for breakfast.\n\nUpgrade your salads with cooked whole grains like wheat berries, sorghum, wild rice, quinoa, or millet.\n\nMake homemade veggie burgers with bulgur.\n\nFill tacos and burritos with brown rice or farro.\n\nSubstitute whole grain flours while baking. You can usually substitute 1/3 to 1/2 of the white flour in a recipe with whole wheat without any discernable difference.\n\nWhat recipes should I try?\n\nIf you’re looking to make a whole-grain swap for tonight’s dinner, here are two great recipes that deliciously fit the bill.\n\nChicken Quinoa Soup\n\nMakes 4 Servings\n\n2 teaspoons oil\n\n1 yellow onion, diced\n\n2 large carrots, chopped\n\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n\n1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs, sliced\n\n1 cup sliced brown mushrooms\n\n2 sliced celery stalks\n\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n\n4 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth\n\n1 cup quinoa\n\n1 teaspoon Italian seasoning\n\n1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes\n\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n\n½ cup chopped parsley\n\nHeat oil in a large saucepan; cook onion, carrots, and salt for 6 minutes.\n\nAdd chicken thighs, mushrooms, celery, and garlic; cook 5 minutes more.\n\nAdd broth, 1 cup water, quinoa, Italian seasoning, chili flakes, and black pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until quinoa is tender, about 15 minutes.\n\nGarnish with parsley.\n\nPumpkin Apple Baked Oatmeal\n\nMakes 6 Servings\n\n1 cup steel-cut oats\n\n1 1/2 cups rolled oats or rye flakes\n\n1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon\n\n1/2 teaspoon cardamom\n\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n\n1/2 cup sliced almonds, walnuts or pecans\n\n2 large eggs\n\n1 cup pure pumpkin puree\n\n1/2 cup milk of choice\n\n4 apples, chopped\n\n2 tablespoons maple syrup\n\n1/2 teaspoon ginger powder\n\n2 cups plain Greek yogurt\n\n2 cups blueberries\n\nCover steel-cut oats with water and let soak for at least 4 hours. Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease a 9×13-inch casserole pan.\n\nDrain steel-cut oats and stir together with rolled oats, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cardamom, salt, and nuts together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, and pumpkin. Add liquid mixture to oats and gently mix until everything is moist.\n\nPlace apple slices in the bottom of the baking dish and drizzle on maple syrup and sprinkle on 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and ginger powder. Top with oat mixture. Bake until topping is set, about 35 minutes.\n\nServe wedges warm topped with yogurt and blueberries.\n\nRecipes by Matthew Kadey, R.D.\n\nGET ENOUGH SLEEP | Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Office of the Secretary, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\n\nRETHINKING THE GOAL OF 10,000 STEPS A DAY | Amanda Loudin, webmd.com\n\n7 NUTRITIONIST-APPROVED FOODS TO BOOST YOUR MOOD | Matthew Kadey, R.D., SilverSneakers\n\nWhat you put in your mouth matters greatly to mental health. Learn how to tweak your diet with these good-mood foods. Few people have any doubt that the quality of your diet has a direct impact on physical health. But what you eat and how well your brain works are also closely connected. Nutritional psychiatry is a growing field that investigates how the foods you choose impact your mental well-being.Research shows that older people who follow a healthier diet are nearly 40% less likely to have major depressive episodes than those who eat much worse. Nutritional deficiencies have been linked to depression in other research too. This is important information to know, since seniors appear to be more likely to suffer from this problem. Over time, depression can have significant impacts on your health and longevity.Like any other body part, our brains are built out of the food we eat. If you consistently feel down in the dumps — to the point where it impacts your life — it might be worth considering what you put on your plate. Here are the good-mood foods that can help you feel brighter.Fruit Blueberries or strawberries? Apples or pears? No matter what your preference, eating plenty of fruit can likely help boost your mental health. A study in the British Journal of Nutrition found that a higher intake of fruit was associated with fewer symptoms of depression and a better sense of well-being. In contrast, frequently eating savory snacks was linked to higher rates of both anxiety and depression.While scientists aren’t yet certain how eating extra servings of fruit can help with mood, it could have to do with the bounty of antioxidant compounds they contain which work to improve brain health.Try this: Up your glee factor by eating at least 2 cups of fruit a day.Mushrooms Nutrition experts are increasingly touting mushrooms for their various health benefits — including mental wellness. A recent study of more than 24,000 U.S. adults found that mushroom consumption was associated with a lower risk of depression. This was after factoring in major risk factors, including demographics, health, and medications.The researchers found that mushrooms contain a compound called ergothioneine, which is an antioxidant that may protect against brain cell damage and reduce symptoms of depression.We still don’t know how many mushrooms you need to eat to have a benefit and which types are most effective, but button (white) and shiitake mushrooms add low-calorie flavor to meals. Be generous with them in the kitchen to help lift your spirits.Try this: Aim to eat 2 to 3 cups of feel-good mushrooms weeklyRainbow Trout This cold-water fish is among the best dietary sources of vitamin B12, a nutrient that can be a mood-booster. Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver and plays a major role in cognitive functioning. Adults aged 50 and older with low vitamin B12 levels were at greater risk for depression, found one recent study.Older people are more likely to develop vitamin B12 deficiencies because the nutrient is absorbed from food by stomach acid. As you age, stomach-acid production starts to decline. That’s why it is important to get tested for a vitamin B12 deficiency and eat enough foods that provide a good daily dose. A 3-ounce serving of trout supplies more than the daily requirement for vitamin B12.As a bonus, it’s also a good source of omega-3 fat which could also help fend off depression. Salmon, tuna, sardines, and shellfish including mussels and oysters are other seafood options that are bursting with feel-good vitamin B12.Try this: Help boost your outlook by eating at least 3 servings of seafood like trout weeklyPepitas Spanish for “little seeds of squash,” pepitas are a variety of green-hued pumpkin seeds that are an excellent source of magnesium. Several studies suggest that a greater dietary intake of magnesium can lower the chances of suffering from depression.This mineral has an important impact on brain chemistry and hormonal balance, both of which play a role in keeping you from feeling like the world is shrinking in on you. Most Americans don’t nearly eat enough magnesium, which is also found in other seeds, beans, lentils, and whole grains. Pepitas are great sprinkled over yogurt, oatmeal, salads, or soups.Try this: Feel better with about 2 tablespoons each dayYogurt If you want to look on the bright side more often, it’s worth buying yogurt at the grocery store. A investigation in the journal Nutritional Neuroscience found that people who had a more robust population of gut microbes tended to have fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression. Yogurt and other fermented foods like kefir, miso, and sauerkraut, contain beneficial gut microbes like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium that are good for the brain.It’s not exactly clear how that works, but these microorganisms may affect mood by sending signals to the brain. They also can help regulate mood hormones.Try this: Enjoy a cup serving of yogurt daily and 3 to 5 servings of other fermented foods weekly.Walnuts Are you nuts for nuts? It may be giving your outlook a big assist. According to a study of more than 26,000 people published in the journal Nutrients, people who regularly ate nuts — particularly walnuts — were found to exhibit fewer depressive symptoms, less hopelessness, and greater energy than people who didn’t eat them. Walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids that help make them a crunchy food for a better mood.Try this: Perk up with 1 ounce of walnuts a day.Green Tea This ancient beverage may hold the answer to fending off modern-day unhappiness. A report in Public Health Nutrition showed that those who sipped four or more cups of green tea each day were 51% less likely to feel down in the dumps.There could be a couple of factors at play here. Tea, especially the green variety, provides antioxidants that improve brain functioning and lessen levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Plus, when you are drinking multiple cups of tea every day, there is less opportunity to guzzle sugary drinks, which are linked to a greater chance of developing depression or anxiety.To reap the most mood-improving benefits, use a loose-leaf green tea and steep it in warm water for a few minutes. That helps it release its beneficial compounds.Try this: Sip and smile with 2 to 4 cups daily\n\nTHE JCC CAN HELP YOU REACH YOUR WELLNESS AND FITNESS GOALS! | Kelly Hont, JCC Membership and DEKA Director, On Your Mark Fitness\n\nAs we welcome the New Year, many of us will set goals or resolutions to meet a goal.

Of course, all the shopping, cooking, and company, can make the holidays stressful, and stress can lead to overeating and unwanted weight gain.\n\nMindful eating can help, says Rachel Stahl, MS, a registered dietician in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism. When you are mindful, you are aware and present in the moment. Thoughts may preoccupy you, but you can learn to return to the now. “Eating can be a mindful activity when you become more aware of your physical hunger and satiety, and use all your senses when eating,” Stahl says. This technique can help you manage or even reduce holiday stress, so that you can fully enjoy your favorite foods in moderation. But, Stahl adds, “Mindful eating takes practice and doesn’t happen overnight.”\n\nShe offers these tips to get you started:\n\nUse small plates. This can help with portion control.\n\nLimit distractions. Disconnect from electronics like your phone, computer, or TV. Sit down at the table to be fully present in the meal.\n\nSlow down and taste your food. Chew slowly, utilize all your senses, and lower your utensils every few bites. “It takes about 20 minutes for your stomach to signal to your brain that it’s full. Giving yourself time to digest a meal will help you notice your body’s signals.”\n\nEnjoy meals with others. “Use mealtime as an opportunity to connect with one another. This will help you take breaks between bites, so you don’t eat too quickly.”\n\nDon’t skip meals or healthy snacks. ‘Saving’ your appetite for holiday feasts can lead to low blood sugar, intense food cravings, and over-eating.\n\nSnack smart. Eat a high-protein snack—a handful of nuts, veggies and hummus, or fruit with 1-2 tablespoons of nut butter–before a holiday party so you’ll be less tempted by all the chips, crackers, and cheese.\n\nEat sitting down. You’re less likely to appreciate and keep track of what you eat if you’re eating on the go.\n\nServe dedicated portions. Eating straight from a bag or box makes it easy to overeat because you can’t see how much you’ve had.\n\nDitch the Clean Plate Club. Wasting food feels bad but stuffing yourself won’t help the hungry.\n\nHonor your fullness, even if it means passing up dessert or a second helping of food that someone spent hours preparing. Just politely say, “No, thank you, really.”\n\nAllow yourself to enjoy your favorite holiday foods. “Try to let go of any food rules. Shift your mindset from labeling food ‘good’ or ‘bad’ to focusing on having a healthy relationship around food. Practice moderation so that you can eat the foods you enjoy without overeating. Restricting too much can leave you feeling deprived and guilty which can set you up for overeating later on.”\n\nManage stress by meditating, taking short walks, reaching for a warm cup of herbal tea, spending time with people who make you laugh, getting enough sleep, eating a well-balanced diet, staying hydrated, and embracing social support. “For some people, high levels of stress can increase hormones, notably cortisol, and the “hunger” hormone ghrelin, which are linked to increased appetite. Stress can contribute to cravings that lead us to crave more foods high in fat, sugar, or both.”\n\nDump New Year’s Diet Resolutions. “Instead of thinking, ‘I’ll just eat whatever I want during the holidays,’ plan ahead before the holidays by adding more exercise, eating a well-balanced diet (no “fad” or “crash diets” or juice cleanses) and approaching holiday meals in a more balanced way.” After the holidays, don’t try to lose a lot of weight fast. “It’s better to lose weight at a slow, steady pace, 1–2 pounds per week. People who lose weight slowly are more likely to keep it off long-term.”\n\n6 WAYS TO EAT HEALTHIER AT THANKSGIVING DINNER | Jesse Hirsch, Consumers Reports\n\nIt’s easy to boost the nutrition and healthfulness of this traditional meal\n\n8 COMMON NUTRITION MYTHS—BUSTED! | Matthew Kadey, R.D., SilverSneakers\n\nA registered dietitian shares the myths about nutrition and eating that you shouldn’t believe.\n\nThe best way to eat healthy is a hotly contested topic, and unfortunately the internet is full of misinformation. It can be confusing to tell what’s true and what isn’t, and false theories that were previously passed through word-of-mouth now spread like wildfire on social media.\n\nPopular nutrition myths can impact your food choices and make eating healthfully seem harder than it needs to be. You’ve likely heard most of these common food and nutrition misconceptions repeated at one time or another. Let’s set the record straight.\n\nMyth #1: Fat-Free or Low-Fat Is Better Than Full Fat Fat was once the villain, but nutrition experts have rethought that idea. When you avoid eating fat, you miss out on foods that help keep you feeling full. Plus, low-fat foods can backfire: They often are high in sugar and sodium to make up for the lack of texture and flavor that happens when fat is removed from food. So, they’re not necessarily healthier, and they may not save you any calories either.\n\nPeanut butter is a good example. Many reduced-fat versions of this nut butter replace some of the healthy unsaturated fat found in peanuts with not-so-healthy sugar. Fat-free salad dressing is problematic too. It won’t increase your absorption of important fat-soluble nutrients and antioxidants like vitamin K and beta-carotene that are found in the vegetables in your salad. And an argument can be made that it’s better to enjoy a plain version of full-fat yogurt instead of the same amount of a high-sugar, fat-free one. Recent research is questioning the link between dairy fat and heart disease, and there is mounting evidence that added sugar harms your health.\n\nIf you’ve avoided fat for years, it may be time to give it a try again. Be sure to read the nutrition label on food packages to see how the calories, sodium and sugar stack up between the non- or lower-fat and original versions.\n\nMyth #2: Fasting Is the Path to Weight Loss Intermittent fasting is a popular eating pattern where you eat during a limited number of hours during the day—and eat nothing the rest of the time. It’s promoted as a better way to drop pounds than cutting back on total daily calories. But it’s effect on weight loss is smaller than you would think.\n\nStudies show that intermittent calorie restriction doesn’t necessarily lead to more weight loss than a diet where you eat when you want to—as long as your calorie intake is controlled to a level that promotes a drop in body weight. For the most part, calories are calories no matter when you eat them.\n\nThere is more than one way to eat for a slimmer body, and skipping meals isn’t necessary. What’s most important is that you determine what your overall calorie intake should be to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight.\n\nMyth #3: Natural Sweeteners Are Healthier Than Sugar Most so-called “natural sweeteners” like honey, maple syrup, and coconut sugar are marketed as being more nutritious than high fructose corn syrup and white sugar. This leaves people thinking they can use more of it without the health risks.\n\nThat isn’t true: The nutritional difference between these sweeteners is less than you want it to be.\n\nSweeteners like honey and maple syrup do contain some nutrients and antioxidants, but not enough to contribute to your nutritional needs. Unless you consume large amounts, which would be a bad idea. Honey and maple syrup contain slightly more calories than granulated sugars. Honey has 64 calories in a tablespoon serving, maple syrup has 52, and white sugar has 49. And their impact on your health may be very similar.\n\nOne study in the Journal of Nutrition discovered that when consumed in the same amounts, honey, high fructose corn syrup, and regular sugar can result in the same detrimental metabolic effects that may raise heart disease risk.\n\nAll sweeteners should be used with restraint. Use just enough to add a touch of sweetness to foods, but not so much where it becomes problematic. Make it a goal to limit all added sweeteners in your diet instead of just zeroing in on the ones that get the worst publicity.\n\nMyth #4: White Poultry Meat Is Better for You Than Dark Meat This idea is completely without merit. What gives dark chicken or turkey meat their darker appearance is the presence of high amounts of a protein called myoglobin, which provides oxygen to your muscles. Since chickens and turkeys walk and don’t fly, their thigh meat is saturated with myoglobin. The breast meat is paler due to lower levels of this compound.\n\nOunce for ounce, white meat like chicken breasts has nearly the same calories and just one fewer gram of fat as chicken thighs. Hardly worth losing sleep over. Dark meat also contains just as much protein and even more zinc, iron, and B vitamins. Plus, you get the extra juicy taste and a lower price.\n\nOne caveat though: Remove the skin after cooking, since it contains a significant amount of unhealthy saturated fat.\n\nMyth #5: Eating More Often Boosts Metabolism Unfortunately for grazers who want to lose weight, there is little scientific evidence that this is true. Yes, there is a temporary uptick in your metabolic rate when your body is digesting and processing food. But it’s not enough to have much of an impact on body weight. The evidence shows that given an equal amount of daily calories, the number of meals makes no significant difference in fat loss.\n\nIn other words, how often you eat has less effect on your weight than your total daily calorie intake. For some, spreading meals and snacks throughout the day reduces hunger and overeating. If that’s the case for you, it is a good idea to eat this way. But if you are someone who has a hard time with portion control, eating less frequently may make it easier for you to eat less.\n\nMyth #6: Gluten Is Bad News Everyone seems to be beating up on gluten these days. So what is it? Gluten is a protein found in grains like wheat, rye, and barley, and it is found in many different foods like breads and pasta.\n\nMany people blame gluten for inflammation, digestive problems, brain fog, and a host of other ills. But many people who avoid it don’t need to be. Research in the journal Digestion found that among people who believed they were sensitive to gluten, 86% could eat it just fine without health issues.\n\nUnless you have celiac disease, which is an illness caused by an immune reaction to eating gluten—or a diagnosed non-celiac gluten sensitivity—you can continue to cook and eat foods that contain gluten, such as your whole-grain morning toast.\n\nIf you unnecessarily replace all your conventional bread, pasta, and baked goods with gluten-free alternatives, you’d see a spike in your grocery bill without doing much to improve the nutritional quality of your diet. Many packaged gluten-free products are less nutritious, not more.\n\nMyth #7: Plant-Based Milk Is Healthier Than Dairy Milk There are dozens of different milk options available out there — from regular old cow’s milk to soy, pea, oat, almond, and seemingly everything in between. (Learn more about five common types of milk here.)\n\nOften, plant-based milks are touted as healthier options, but this is rarely the case. Except for soy and pea, plant-based milks rarely contain anywhere close to the amount of protein found in dairy milk.\n\nFor instance, a cup of almond milk has only a single gram of protein compared to the 8 grams in cow’s milk. Also, many plant-based milks don’t contain important nutrients like vitamin D, vitamin B12, and calcium you get from dairy milk. Some producers fortify their plant milk with those nutrients. But plant-based milks, if they’re not marked “unsweetened,” can also have troubling amounts of added sugar.\n\nDespite what you may have heard, there is little evidence to show that consuming dairy can cause inflammation or heart disease. Ultimately, the milk you choose comes down to personal choice. Plant-based milks are a good option for those who are lactose intolerant or who eat a plant-only diet. But they are largely undeserving of their health halo, and you’ll need to consume more protein and nutrients elsewhere in your meals.\n\nMyth #8: Don’t Eat at Night\n\nThe popular idea is that if you eat after sunset, you’ll be more likely to gain weight and ruin your sleep. But eating food late at night does not make your body store more fat—unless you are consuming more calories than you’ve burned for the day.\n\nIt’s fairly simple math: If you have already met your caloric needs then, yes, the calories you consume later in the day can make you gain weight.\n\nHere are the real problems with late-night eating:\n\nYou may choose less healthy foods at this time, like chips, ice cream, and baked goods.\n\nYou may be eating emotionally or mindlessly, and not because you’re hungry.\n\nAs for messing with your sleep, there isn’t much research to prove that. We all likely have individual responses to this. Some people may be able to eat a big bowl of food at night and still quickly zonk out, while others need more digestion time to sleep well. If you decide to eat at night, it’s important to make healthier choices and not mindlessly snack in front of the television.\n\n10 METABOLISM-BOOSTING FOODS TO WORK INTO YOUR DIET | UPMC Health Beat\n\nMany different factors can affect your metabolism — the process by which your body converts food and drink into energy. Diet itself is one factor. Certain foods and drinks take longer to break down than others, burning more calories in the process.\n\nNo one food will completely turbocharge your metabolism. But many simple foods can play a small role in encouraging metabolism. Combining some of these foods with other factors like exercise and sleep can help your metabolism.\n\n“There are no magic bullet kinds of foods,” says Megan Klucinec, bariatric lifestyle program coordinator, UPMC. “We believe that foods can fit into a healthy meal plan, but it often comes down to moderation, portion sizing, and balance.”\n\nWhat Is Metabolism? Metabolism is the natural process by which our body turns our food and drink into the energy our body needs to run. That includes functions like our heartbeat and breathing. Metabolism is going on at all times, even when we’re sleeping.\n\nYour basal metabolic rate is the amount of energy your body expends while at rest. Different people have different metabolic rates. Many different factors can cause a metabolic speed up or slow down, including:\n\nAge\n\nBiological sex\n\nBody composition\n\nBody size\n\nDiet\n\nGenetics\n\nHealth conditions\n\nMuscle mass\n\nPhysical activity\n\nAlthough some people link metabolism to weight gain and weight loss, slow metabolism is not usually to blame for weight gain. Your diet and physical activity play a larger role in that.\n\n10 Foods That Can Promote Metabolism\n\nDiet can play a part in your metabolism. However, it’s not the only factor — and it’s far from the biggest. So, though some foods may promote metabolism more than others, they’re not going to magically make your metabolic rate faster.\n\n“Sometimes we think there’s specific foods or beverages that can rev up your metabolism, and some foods really do take more time to digest than others,” Klucinec says. “That can slightly increase our metabolism, but not by much.\n\n“The foods that I like to encourage or incorporate are more whole foods. They’re more recognizable by the body, they can break down, are not ultra-processed, and will fit into a multitude of healthy meal plans.”\n\nThe following are 10 foods or drinks that Klucinec recommends as part of a healthy metabolic diet.\n\n1. Lean proteins (eggs or lean meats)\n\nYour body expends much more energy breaking down proteins than it does carbohydrates and fats. Klucinec says studies have shown people with a higher intake of protein in their diet have a higher metabolic rate.\n\nConsuming protein-rich foods can benefit metabolism. One large egg contains 7 grams of protein. Lean meats like chicken, fish, turkey, and even lean beef — 20% fat content or less — are also good choices.\n\n“Really, having about 60 to 80 grams minimally of protein in a day is what’s recommended,” Klucinec says. “That helps us to feel fuller both when we finish a meal and in between our next meal or snack.”\n\n2. Coffee\n\nThe caffeine in coffee is a stimulant, which can help your metabolism, Klucinec says. However, you should limit the number of additives like sugar and creamer, which can pack on the empty calories.\n\nAdditionally, increased caffeine intake may negatively impact sleep. Lack of quality sleep may also contribute to weight gain and/or slower weight loss.\n\n3. Green tea/green tea extract\n\nLike coffee, green tea contains caffeine. It also contains compounds known as catechins. Some studies have linked the consumption of catechins to a higher metabolic rate, especially when combined with exercise.\n\nGreen tea contains more catechins than other forms of tea. Green tea extract — a concentrated form of green tea that can take the form of a supplement — contains even more catechins.\n\nLike coffee, you should avoid adding too much sugar to green tea because it contains empty calories.\n\n4. Chili peppers\n\nChili peppers contain a compound called capsaicin, which provides their burning effect. Klucinec says studies have shown capsaicin in a supplemental form can help metabolism. When added to food, it can have the same metabolic benefit and also work as an appetite suppressant.\n\nKlucinec suggests adding chili pepper to vegetables or lean meat to add flavor.\n\n“Why not have your healthy food taste good?” she says.\n\n5. Ginger\n\nGinger is another metabolism-encouraging food that you can use as a flavor additive to food and drink. Klucinec says adding ginger powder to a hot beverage like tea can increase your metabolic rate. It can also suppress your appetite.\n\nIn addition, ginger can affect metabolism by improving digestion. It may even help you feel fuller after meals.\n\n6. Beans/lentils/legumes\n\nBeans, lentils, and legumes are good sources of protein and fiber. The protein takes longer for your body to break down, and you’ll feel fuller for longer.\n\n“Carbohydrates get a bad rap, but when we look at beans and foods like lentils or legumes, that’s a great choice for being a metabolism booster,” Klucinec says. “Having one-third of a cup of beans — you can put that in soup, you can put it in your salad, it could be a bit of a side dish for you. It will help you feel fuller for a longer period of time, so you may not grab for something else to eat.”\n\nKlucinec says to avoid beans with sauces and other accompaniments, like baked beans. But most of these foods — navy beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, chickpeas, and more — have value.\n\n7. Flaxseed\n\nFlaxseed provides proteins and vitamins, along with other health benefits, Klucinec says. Researchers are studying its effects on metabolic syndrome, a group of conditions that can raise your risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and other problems. It also may help the bacterial profile of the gut, leading to better gut health.\n\nYou can add flaxseeds to oatmeal, soup, smoothies, yogurt, and many other foods you already eat.\n\n8. Brazil nuts\n\nBrazil nuts contain selenium, a mineral with many potential health benefits. Selenium can improve the health of your thyroid, which regulates metabolism, and can also boost your immune function. In addition, Brazil nuts are a good source of protein and healthy fats.\n\nJust make sure to watch your portion sizes, Klucinec says.\n\n“Sometimes we like that crunch, but having too many nuts isn’t great for the fat content,” she says. “Thinking about Brazil nuts, what would fill up a small shot glass might be a serving.”\n\n9. Broccoli\n\nBroccoli is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family. Its health benefits include reducing blood fat levels like cholesterol and reducing the risk of some cancers and age-related diseases like dementia. It also contains a compound called glucoraphanin, which showed metabolic benefits in studies involving mice.\n\n“(Glucoraphanin) is helpful for retuning metabolism in particular,” Klucinec says.\n\n10. Spinach and kale\n\nMany different green, leafy vegetables offer metabolic benefits. But you can prepare spinach and kale in many different ways — as kale chips, in smoothies, in side salads, and more. Their high iron content makes them good for growth, development, and metabolism, Klucinec says.\n\nKlucinec suggests pairing green leafy vegetables with foods rich in vitamin C, such as lemons, tomatoes, squash, and more.\n\n“When you have some of those high-iron foods and vitamin C foods together, they taste good, most importantly, but they are good for you,” she says. “It helps with absorption.”\n\nTips for a More Metabolic-Friendly Diet\n\nYou don’t have to completely change your diet right away and start eating solely metabolism-encouraging foods. You can incorporate many of these foods into your current diet. You can also opt for leaner meats for protein, eat beans as a side dish, add chili peppers or ginger for flavoring, or add flaxseeds to yogurt.\n\n“That’s a way to get that in there without making it seem like you’re changing everything all at once,” Klucinec says. “Because making any of these small changes in the right direction is really impactful, and it will help get you on the right step for your journey.”\n\nKlucinec says you should also watch your portion sizes and aim for balance in your diet. Half your plate should consist of fruits and vegetables, while the other half should consist of a lean protein and a healthy carbohydrate. When snacking, have two bites of a protein per one bite of a carbohydrate.\n\nNon-Dietary Metabolic Tips\n\nYour metabolic rate depends on many factors out of your control. Diet is one factor you can control. Other simple things you can do to help your metabolism include:\n\nExercise. Do resistance exercises on two non-consecutive days per week. Examples include weightlifting, resistance bands, swimming, and more. “Just doing that at least two non-consecutive days in a week can help you burn more calories and even be a little more in tune to burn up calories when you’re done exercising for the next 48 hours,” Klucinec says.\n\nHydrate, especially before meals. Drinking water throughout the day can help you feel fuller and less inclined to grab a snack. Drinking an 8-ounce glass of water before a meal can help fill you up.\n\nSleep. Aim for seven to nine hours a night. When your body doesn’t get enough sleep, it releases more cortisol, a hormone that can lead to weight gain.\n\nThese factors are important not only for metabolism but for our overall health. Just know that it’s important to have patience — you may not see an impact right away, but you should stick with it. Set reasonable expectations and don’t set yourself up for failure by setting unrealistic goals.\n\n“You’re asking yourself to change habits, and that’s one of the most difficult things you can ever do,” Klucinec says. “There aren’t any quick fixes to that. You might have to start by changing your mind, changing your focus, changing your expectations, being more patient, and giving yourself time.”\n\nHOW EXERCISE CAN BOOST YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM | Elizabeth Millard, SilverSneakers\n\nCold and flu season is here. Could exercise be your secret to staying healthy?\n\nWhen it comes to bracing for cold and flu season, the tried-and-true advice still holds true: Wash your hands more often, focus on plenty of quality sleep, get a flu shot, eat fruits and vegetables, and make sure you’re hydrated enough.\n\nThere’s one more item to add to this prevention list, and that’s exercise.\n\n“The connection between healthy habits, including physical activity and stronger immune function can’t be overstated,” says Vivek Cherian, M.D., a Baltimore-based internal medicine physician. “What you do every day can have a major impact on fighting off viruses and infections, and as with anything in medicine, prevention is the preferred approach.”\n\nWith that in mind, here’s a look at how exercise strengthens the immune response, and whether that means you should stay active when you do get sick.\n\nHow Exercise Impacts the Immune System A breadth of research links regular physical activity with better immune function, for people of all ages, says Dr. Cherian. For older adults, exercise may even mitigate some age-related changes that tend to lower immunity.\n\nA study in Frontiers in Immunology looked at 29 women over age 65 who took part in a six-week exercise program. When researchers compared before-and-after samples of their immune cells, they found that exercise fired up the immune system by producing more threat-fighting cells.\n\n(A bonus result was improvement in the women’s body composition and overall mobility. Win-win!)\n\nIn explaining their findings, the researchers noted that age inevitably brings a decline in immune function. It’s a process called immunosenescence. It makes you more susceptible to colds and flu.\n\nRegular workouts, however, have the power to help slow this process considerably, the study showed. This means you not only have better protection against colds and flu, but also against a wide range of other illnesses.\n\nA 2018 research review focusing on immunosenescence, also published in Frontiers in Immunology, noted that exercise can actually improve the effectiveness of flu vaccines in older adults, since the immune system is more efficient.\n\nAnother big bonus: Regular exercise helps flush bacteria out of the lungs and airways. This action cuts your chances of catching a cold or flu. What’s more, the slight rise in body temperature that comes when you exercise may even prevent bacteria from growing in the first place.\n\n3 Tips for Maximizing the Immune-Boosting Benefits of Exercise\n\nTo reap the immune-boosting advantages of your workouts, follow these strategies:\n\nBe consistent. Getting some physical activity every day can keep the immune system primed and is better than trying to load up all your exercise on the weekend or one day per week.\n\nMove more throughout the day. Although getting to the gym and taking fitness classes can keep you motivated, remember that all movement can count toward your physical activity total — and the more the better.\n\nFor example, housework, walking the dog, playing with grandkids, or gardening are all hobbies that keep you active.\n\nFocus on variety. In terms of the best workout for immune system building, the answer is all of them, says Dr. Cherian. From aerobic exercise like stationary cycling and Zumba Gold to strength training with weights or bodyweight exercises, all types of exercise help build up your immunity. Doing a variety of activities also lets you move in more ways — plus, it keeps exercise fresh and interesting.\n\nChoose workouts that make you feel uplifted and empowered, as that reduces stress, adds Jessica Schatz, RYT, a Los Angeles–based yoga teacher. Chronic or even short-term stress has been shown to have a significant and negative effect on immune function, she explains. And physical activity in general tends to be a stress buster.\n\nSchatz says yoga is a good example of how exercise influences immunity because it connects deep breathing — which has been shown to lower the stress response — with poses that build strength and increase mobility and flexibility.\n\n“Even just a few yoga sessions per week can be helpful,” she says. “A regular practice can help with immunity, sleep, and stress, and improving all of those can be powerful.”\n\nShould You Exercise When You’re Sick?\n\nConsidering that physical activity provides a boost for immune function, it might seem like getting more exercise when you’re starting to feel sick would be advantageous. But it doesn’t work that way, according to Dr. Cherian.\n\n“If you’re symptomatic, which means you have fever, chills, or respiratory issues, you should refrain from exercising,” he says. “It’s best to wait seven to 10 days before you ease back into your exercise routine. Ultimately, the timeframe will be different for everyone, so it’s important to listen to your body.”\n\nWhen you do return to exercise, he suggests starting gradually, especially if your symptoms haven’t fully resolved. That doesn’t mean no exercise at all — physical activity like walking or gentle yoga can be helpful for getting you back on track. If you have mild symptoms, you may be able to do more, says Dr. Cherian.\n\n“If you have a runny nose but otherwise feel fine, it’s absolutely okay to resume exercising,” he adds. “If you still have some congestion or shortness of breath, I’d recommend holding off. Bottom line is that if you’re unsure, ask your primary care doctor, especially if your symptoms are lingering after 10 days.”\n\n10 WAYS TO COPE WITH CURRENT WORLD EVENTS | Nilagia McCoy (Boston University SPH’24)\n\nFeelings of powerlessness and uncertainty in response to disturbing current events can be difficult to cope with. While these tips may not directly address the causes of this stress, they can help you manage it and keep going.\n\n1. Limit your intake of news and social media. If you’re feeling distressed by the news, it’s OK to take breaks. If disengaging completely feels like too much, create limits for yourself: set a timer that allows you to engage, but reminds you to stop. Read a book, take a walk, or find some time without media. Remember, taking time for yourself is not selfish.\n\n2. Let your voice be heard. When we feel powerless, it’s important to find ways to have a voice. You could get involved in forms of activism, join organizations, attend events, talk to others about what you value, make a donation, or work to protect the rights of others. Consider how to balance action with rest.\n\n3. Maintain your routine and engage in healthy activities. Try to strike a balance between keeping up with current events and going about your daily life. Basic acts of self-care can make a real difference during times of stress: take breaks, connect with family and friends, take on fewer commitments, engage in spiritual or religious practices, or go for a walk. Find what feels good for you.\n\n4. Practice relaxation. Try self-soothing strategies like meditating, breathing exercises, listening to music, or whatever you find helpful. Give yourself a bit of sympathy, too. Stress can often cause you to underperform. Make sure you set aside time to treat yourself and enjoy some moments of joy.\n\n5. Move your body. When you experience stress, your muscles tense. Practicing movement that releases tension can help you process difficult emotions. Try shaking out parts of your body, gentle stretches, self-massage, or other forms of movement.\n\n6. Recognize your limits. Remember that you may not be as efficient as usual, and you might need more time or help to complete tasks. It’s OK! We’re all human. Just plan accordingly, show yourself kindness, and ask for support when needed.\n\n7. Seek out community. Check-in with your friends or family. Even when you don’t know the “right” thing to say, just being with others during difficult times can be powerful.\n\n8. Acknowledge your feelings. Reactions to events vary from person to person. Some people experience intense feelings while others may not. Allow yourself to feel what you feel without judgment of yourself or others.\n\n9. Remember that self-care and community care are connected. It can be tempting to prioritize activist work over your own self-care, but they are interconnected. Taking time for yourself helps you show up as a kinder and more compassionate person to others, and can refuel your capacity for activism.\n\n10. Reach out if you need additional support. Whether you are seeking information to help yourself or trying to learn more to help someone else in need, The 10.27 Healing Partnership based at the JCC Squirrel Hill is a community resource to help you no matter where you are in your healing process.\n\nARE FEMALE ATHLETES MORE PRONE TO ACL INJURIES? | Volker Musahl, MD, Orthopaedic Sports Medicine UPMC Health Beat\n\nACL Injuries in the Female Athlete More women and girls than ever are participating in competitive sports. But emergency department statistics indicate that female athletes are more susceptible to tears of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) than males are.\n\nIn fact, female athletes tear their ACLs at an alarmingly higher rate — 2 to 8 times more frequently — than male athletes. For example, according to the National Institutes of Health, the incidence of female to male ACL injuries is 3.5 times greater in basketball and 2.8 times greater in soccer.\n\nHow Do ACL Injuries Occur? The ACL is one of the main ligaments that stabilizes the knee joint. It connects the femur (thighbone) to the tibia (shinbone). A non-contact ACL tear usually happens when an athlete makes a rapid but awkward stop in anticipation of a lateral movement.\n\nACL injuries tend to happen when athletes are decelerating, changing directions, or landing. During these maneuvers, female bodies may move differently than male bodies, putting them at a higher risk of injury.\n\nThe hamstring muscles in the back of the leg and the quadricep muscles in the front work together to move the leg. When you bend your leg, the hamstring muscles contract, and the quads relax. Conversely, when you straighten your leg, the quads contract and the hamstring muscles relax.\n\nFemale athletes can take steps to strengthen their hamstrings and use different body mechanics to get back to playing after an ACL injury. This is according to Volker Musahl, MD, a world-renowned sports surgeon and chief of the Division of Sports Medicine at UPMC.\n\nThe same steps that can help them recover from an ACL injury can also help prevent the injury altogether.\n\n“When I do evaluations through the ACL Program at UPMC Sports Medicine, I ask the athletes to stand up on a box and jump down and land, or jump down, land, pivot, and run,” Dr. Musahl says. “When women and girls jump down, they tend to land knock-kneed with straighter legs, while men and boys land with knees straight out and more bend in the legs. But when female athletes are taught a different way to land on their feet, we can treat the movement that’s putting them at risk.”\n\nHow Can Female Athletes Prevent ACL Injuries? One way for female athletes to reduce their risk of ACL tears is to build and maintain leg strength year-round — not just during their sports season. Exercises the UPMC ACL Program recommends include:\n\nQuad sets.\n\nStraight leg raises.\n\nBackward leg raises.\n\nHip abduction.\n\nSquats.\n\nWall sits.\n\nReverse lunges.\n\nBridges (short leg and long leg).\n\nPlanks and side planks\n\n“There’s really nobody who is too young to learn ACL prevention exercises and improved body mechanics,” says Dr. Musahl. “In fact, it would be great if schools would teach these exercises because the younger the person, the more teachable they are.”\n\nDr. Musahl adds that early sports specialization can increase the risk of girls and women sustaining ACL injuries.\n\n“I always refer to hockey great Wayne Gretzky as a good example of a multisport athlete. He played a lot of different sports when he was young then specialized at an older age and was able to stave off serious injury throughout his professional career,” he adds. “Playing different sports when young diversifies the training of both the muscles and the brain, which helps the athlete grow stronger all over.”\n\nTop 3 Tips for Preventing ACL Injuries There are steps you can take to reduce your risk. Here are Dr. Musahl’s top tips for preventing ACL injury:\n\nBecome a multisport athlete.\n\nRespect the three Rs: rest, recovery, rehydration. No one can train seven days a week — not even the pros, so make sure to give your body time to rest and recover. “For example, train three to four days, then rest one day before game day,” Dr. Musahl says. “And make sure to hydrate before and rehydrate after your workouts.”\n\nEnroll in an ACL injury prevention program or go online for a good app. “Spend a few minutes per day doing prevention exercises,” he recommends. “The Nordic hamstring curl is a good one, and it can be done with or without a partner.”\n\nThe Nordic hamstring curl is an eccentric hamstring curl, which means that the hamstring muscle gets longer but stays active during the exercise.\n\nTo do the Nordic curl, kneel down on a mat and have your partner hold your ankles down on the floor. (If doing this curl on your own, put your ankles under a loaded barbell or other immovable object.)\n\nKeeping your body straight, lean forward from the knee (not the hip) toward the floor as close to the floor as you can without using your arms or hands. Move slowly and with control. Only put your hands out in front of you on the floor when you can no longer hold yourself up with your legs.\n\nThen, push yourself back to the starting position and repeat. Count how many you can do and try to add a rep each time you do the exercise.\n\nTHE BENEFITS OF KIDS PLAYING BASKETBALL AT A YOUNG AGE | Spalding.com.au\n\nFriendships can have a major impact on your health and well-being, but it’s not always easy to develop or maintain friendships. Understand the importance of social connection in your life and what you can do to develop and nurture lasting friendships.\n\nWhat are the benefits of friendships? Good friends are good for your health. Friends can help you celebrate good times and provide support during bad times. Friends prevent isolation and loneliness and give you a chance to offer needed companionship, too. Friends can also:\n\nIncrease your sense of belonging and purpose\n\nBoost your happiness and reduce your stress\n\nImprove your self-confidence and self-worth\n\nHelp you cope with traumas, such as divorce, serious illness, job loss or the death of a loved one\n\nEncourage you to change or avoid unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as excessive drinking or lack of exercise\n\nFriends also play a significant role in promoting your overall health. Adults with strong social connections have a reduced risk of many significant health problems, including depression, high blood pressure and an unhealthy body mass index (BMI). In fact, studies have found that older adults who have meaningful relationships and social support are likely to live longer than their peers with fewer connections.\n\nWhy is it sometimes hard to make friends or maintain friendships? Many adults find it hard to develop new friendships or keep up existing friendships. Friendships may take a back seat to other priorities, such as work or caring for children or aging parents. You and your friends may have grown apart due to changes in your lives or interests. Or maybe you’ve moved to a new community and haven’t yet found a way to meet people.\n\nDeveloping and maintaining good friendships takes effort. The enjoyment and comfort friendship can provide, however, makes the investment worthwhile.\n\nWhat’s a healthy number of friends? Quality counts more than quantity. While it may be good to cultivate a diverse network of friends and acquaintances, you may feel a greater sense of belonging and well-being by nurturing close, meaningful relationships that will support you through thick and thin.\n\nWhat are some ways to meet new friends? It’s possible to develop friendships with people who are already in your social network. Think through people you’ve interacted with — even very casually — who made a positive impression.\n\nYou may make new friends and nurture existing relationships by:\n\nStaying in touch with people with whom you’ve worked or taken classes\n\nReconnecting with old friends\n\nReaching out to people you’ve enjoyed chatting with at social gatherings\n\nIntroducing yourself to neighbors\n\nMaking time to connect with family members\n\nIf anyone stands out in your memory as someone you’d like to know better, reach out. Ask mutual friends or acquaintances to share the person’s contact information, or — even better — to reintroduce the two of you with a text, email or in-person visit. Extend an invitation to coffee or lunch.\n\nTo meet new people who might become your friends, you have to go to places where others are gathered. Don’t limit yourself to one strategy for meeting people. The broader your efforts, the greater your likelihood of success.\n\nPersistence also matters. Take the initiative rather than waiting for invitations to come your way and keep trying. You may need to suggest plans a few times before you can tell if your interest in a new friend is mutual.\n\nFor example, try several of these ideas:\n\nAttend community events. Look for groups or clubs that gather around an interest or hobby you share. You may find these groups online, or they may be listed in the newspaper or on community bulletin boards. There are also many websites that help you connect with new friends in your neighborhood or city. Do a Google search using terms such as [your city] + social network, or [your neighborhood] + meet ups.\n\nVolunteer. Offer your time or talents at a hospital, place of worship, museum, community center, charitable group or other organization. You can form strong connections when you work with people who have mutual interests.\n\nExtend and accept invitations. Invite a friend to join you for coffee or lunch. When you’re invited to a social gathering, say yes. Contact someone who recently invited you to an activity and return the favor.\n\nTake up a new interest. Take a college or community education course to meet people who have similar interests. Join a class at a local gym, senior center or community fitness facility.\n\nJoin a faith community. Take advantage of special activities and get-to-know-you events for new members.\n\nTake a walk. Grab your kids or pet and head outside. Chat with neighbors who are also out and about or head to a popular park and strike up conversations there.\n\nAbove all, stay positive. You may not become friends with everyone you meet but maintaining a friendly attitude and demeanor can help you improve the relationships in your life. It may also sow the seeds of friendship with new acquaintances.\n\nHow does social media affect friendships? Joining a chat group or online community might help you make or maintain connections and relieve loneliness. However, research suggests that use of social networking sites doesn’t necessarily translate to a larger offline network or closer offline relationships with network members. In addition, remember to exercise caution when sharing personal information or arranging an activity with someone you’ve only met online.\n\nHow can I nurture my friendships? Developing and maintaining healthy friendships involves give-and-take. Sometimes you’re the one giving support, and other times you’re on the receiving end. Letting friends know you care about them and appreciate them can help strengthen your bond. It’s as important for you to be a good friend as it is to surround yourself with good friends.\n\nTo nurture your friendships:\n\nBe kind. This most-basic behavior remains the core of successful relationships. Think of friendship as an emotional bank account. Every act of kindness and every expression of gratitude are deposits into this account, while criticism and negativity draw down the account.\n\nBe a good listener. Ask what’s going on in your friends’ lives. Let the other person know you are paying close attention through eye contact, body language and occasional brief comments such as, “That sounds fun.” When friends share details of hard times or difficult experiences, be empathetic, but don’t give advice unless your friends ask for it.\n\nOpen up. Build intimacy with your friends by opening up about yourself. Being willing to disclose personal experiences and concerns shows that your friend holds a special place in your life, and it may deepen your connection.\n\nShow that you can be trusted. Being responsible, reliable and dependable is key to forming strong friendships. Keep your engagements and arrive on time. Follow through on commitments you’ve made to your friends. When your friends share confidential information, keep it private.\n\nMake yourself available. Building a close friendship takes time — together. Make an effort to see new friends regularly, and to check in with them in between meet ups. You may feel awkward the first few times you talk on the phone or get together, but this feeling is likely to pass as you get more comfortable with each other.\n\nManage your nerves with mindfulness. You may find yourself imagining the worst of social situations, and you may feel tempted to stay home. Use mindfulness exercises to reshape your thinking. Each time you imagine the worst, pay attention to how often the embarrassing situations you’re afraid of actually take place. You may notice that the scenarios you fear usually don’t happen.When embarrassing situations do happen, remind yourself that your feelings will pass, and you can handle them until they do. Yoga and other mind-body relaxation practices also may reduce anxiety and help you face situations that make you feel nervous.\n\nRemember, it’s never too late to develop new friendships or reconnect with old friends. Investing time in making friends and strengthening your friendships can pay off in better health and a brighter outlook for years to come.\n\nTIPS TO STAY ACTIVE THIS FALL | Penn Medicine\n\nSTUDY FINDS PHYSICAL FITNESS 1.5 TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER THERAPIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH | Carrie Harper, Club Industry\n\nEarlier in 2023, The University of South Australia conducted a study review encompassing 1,039 studies with over 128,000 participants, which linked physical fitness practices to mental wellness.\n\nSubjects of the studies had varying demographics, a cross-section of the population, not all with a pre-existing diagnosis of a mental health disorder. Any and all kinds of physical fitness practices were included in the studies and noted according to duration and intensity of the exercise. Mental health data was taken and analyzed based on several scales, as well as self-reports.\n\nHere are some findings from the review:\n\nExercise has a significant impact on mental health issues and disorders, including anxiety and depression.\n\nThe overall data shows that physical exercise may be 1.5 times more effective than traditional counseling or pharmaceutical intervention.*\n\nThe most significantly impacted populations for positive change include women with chronic illness, pre and post natal women, and people living with HIV.\n\nModerate to intense exercise had a more positive impact than lower intensity.\n\nExercising 150 minutes or less per week had a more positive impact than more time working out.\n\nProgrammed or prescribed exercise plans of 12 weeks had a more positive impact than not having an exercise plan.\n\nMental health is important for everyone, not just those diagnosed with a disorder. Most people undergo stress from daily life, or can have temporary bouts of depression and anxiety. This study review shows the positive mental health benefit of physical activity for everyone, not just those in medical care for a diagnosis.\n\nThe World Health Organization estimates that mental health disorders rose significantly over the years of 2020-21, with a baseline before the COVID-19 pandemic to be about 12.5% of the global population. That number is unclear in 2023, as some people suffered significant temporary stress, and some continue to struggle. Lifestyle changes have been discussed and suggested for many years around mental health, but this is one of the first studies to show that it may be more effective for some people than counseling, therapy, or medications.*\n\nIn addition, because mental health is not seen as a physical symptom in many people, the numbers reported by World Health Organization may be lower than the actual number of people with underlying mental health issues, including many levels of anxiety and depression.\n\n*This study does not imply that people should leave their current practices in therapy, or that they should quit taking their medications. This study quantifies prescribing physical activity as part of a mental health care plan, and shows that lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on people’s mental health. It also shows that people who are not in therapy or taking medication may still get significant positive results from a simple exercise plan.\n\nRETHINKING BMI | Annie Kostovny & Elie Golin, JCC\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post Gazette recently posted an article titled, The BMI takes a major hit from the American Medical Association. Now what? The article references a recent publication from the American Medical Association which states that the BMI (body mass index) measurement is an “imperfect measurement and should not be used alone to determine a patient’s overall health.”\n\nFINALLY!!!!!\n\nThe article goes on to share some of the reasons why this is an imperfect and often times inaccurate measurement. BMI does not take into account age, muscle mass, fat mass, and fat distribution. It is possible to have 6% body fat and still be considered morbidly obese and alternatively, have 35% body fat and be considered a healthy weight. Think about a body builder – 6 foot 2 inches, 280 pounds, not a shred of fat on them. Based on BMI, the ratio of weight to height would put this individual as incredibly obese.\n\nThe JCC prides itself on staying current with the science and has been following this line of thinking for a while to assist our members in achieving a healthy lifestyle. During out Complimentary Fitness Assessments as well as Personal Training Programs, we incorporate a Styku, an advanced piece of technology that takes a 3D scan of your body and is able to provide weight, fat mass percentage, bone density, muscle mass and more! Using these measurements, we are able to provide a much more accurate reading of an individual’s health and suggest any lifestyle changes that should be considered.\n\nTo schedule a Styku session, contact Elie Golin at [email protected]\n\nIS IT BAD TO SLEEP AFTER A MEAL? | UPMC Health Beat\n\nWe’ve all been told that eating a meal before bed can have unhealthy side effects — the biggest being weight gain. But depending on what you eat, that might not necessarily be the case. So, how does eating before sleep really affect your body?\n\nEating right before going to bed is not recommended because it works against the body’s circadian rhythm.\n\nWhen you eat just before going to sleep you do not give the body the proper time to digest and burn off the calories you have just ingested. Instead of being used as fuel for the day, those calories will be turned into fat and stored in the body.\n\nWeight gain Your body gains weight when you take in more calories than you burn off. This is the case no matter when you eat.\n\nGoing to sleep directly after you eat means your body doesn’t get a chance to burn off those calories. In fact, eating a big meal and then hitting the couch can be just as harmful.\n\nEating an early dinner allows your body time to burn off extra calories before you go to sleep. Late-night snacks tend to be high-calorie foods — such as ice cream or potato chips — so it’s more important to watch the types of foods you are eating before sleep rather than when you are eating them.\n\nTrouble sleeping Eating before bed can also affect how well you sleep during the night. Fatty or heavy foods may cause bloating and stomach pain that can keep you tossing and turning. Also, spicy foods that cause heartburn or indigestion can keep you from getting a good night’s rest.\n\nWhile it is important to watch what you eat before bed, eating a small healthy snack might not be a bad idea. Going to bed with a growling stomach can be just as uncomfortable as eating too much. A small snack also can keep you from binge eating at breakfast in the morning.\n\nWhy Do I Get Tired After I Eat? Feeling tired after eating is a common occurrence. Your body takes anywhere from 30 to 40 hours to full digest a meal. As you continue to add food to your stomach, your body must continually work to digest it. Eating a large meal can take some energy to digest, making you feel a bit tired.\n\nAlso consider what you ate. Meals heavy with carbohydrates or protein may make you feel tired as these foods take time to digest and release hormones that can make you feel tired. There also is research that shows that foods rich in tryptophan, an essential amino acid, can lead to the body producing more serotonin, the chemical that regulates mood and sleep cycles. Eating foods such as cheese, fish, eggs, and chicken — which all contain Tryptophan — can make you feel tired afterward.\n\nHow Long Should You Wait to Sleep After Eating? It is recommended that you stop eating about three hours before you plan to go to bed. This will give your body enough time to properly digest the food you have eaten without disrupting your sleep, but also allowing time to notice any symptoms of acid reflux or any other digestion related irritation.\n\nFor those who eat early and sleep later, it actually may be beneficial to have a small healthy snack before bed.\n\nWhat to Eat Before Bed While it is important to watch what you eat before bed, there are some healthy options. If done the right way, snacking before bed might actually be healthy. Choosing the right foods can help you sleep better and feel energized the next day. Some healthy bedtime snacks include:\n\nAlmond mix\n\nWarm milk and honey\n\nBlueberries\n\nChamomile tea\n\nTart cherry juice\n\nPeanut butter\n\nLow fat yogurt with fruit\n\nIt is important to remember that it is not necessary when you are eating but what and how much you are eating that might be affecting your sleep and causing you to gain weight.\n\nWhat to Avoid Eating Before Bed While it may be recommended not to eat at all before bed, anything high in fat and sugar should certainly be avoided before bed. Other foods to avoid eating before bed include:\n\nIce cream\n\nCandy\n\nAlcohol\n\nCaffeine\n\nTHE DOs AND DON’Ts TO MAKE STRENGTH TRAINING DAYS DELIVER | Lauren Bedosky, SilverSneakers\n\nWhen your strength routine is fun and effective, you’re more likely to stick with it.Starting a strength training routine is only half the battle — sticking with it is the other half. If you can figure out ways to make your strength training days fun and effective, you can increase your odds of a routine that lasts.Consider this your cheat-sheet for getting the most benefits from your strength training days.Don’t: Limit Yourself to Bodyweight-Only Bodyweight exercises like squats, lunges, and wall pushups offer a great entry point to strength training, says Damien A. Joyner, C.P.T., a personal trainer who specializes in healthy aging and owns Incremental Fitness in San Diego, California. You can do bodyweight exercises practically anywhere, Joyner says, and they can help you learn proper exercise form before adding weight.But at a certain point, you can only do so much with your body weight. Incorporating equipment enables you to perform more exercises and progress in weight as you gain strength, he explains. This can make your strength workouts more challenging and exciting.You have tons of tools to choose from, including:\n\nFree weights. These include barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, and medicine balls.\n\nResistance bands and tubing. These portable, lightweight rubber band-like tools provide resistance when stretched.\n\nWeight machines. Many gyms and health clubs, including JCCPGH, offer weight machines. These machines follow a fixed path for a given exercise.\n\nPlay with the different options to see which tools and equipment you prefer. You might sprinkle some equipment-based exercises into your bodyweight routine or dedicate one strength workout per week to equipment-based exercises.\n\nDo: Train With Others Strength training doesn’t have to be a solo activity. In fact, doing it with others can make the experience more enjoyable. It can also help you stay accountable to your strength program if someone expects you to show up, Joyner says.\n\nTake a SilverSneakers group strength training class or make a gym date with friends or family. You get to laugh and work your muscles at the same time, Joyner notes.\n\nDon’t: Neglect Your Form Mastering proper form is essential for seeing benefits from strength exercises. It’s also key for avoiding pain and injury. If you have yet to learn proper exercise form or feel you could use a refresher, a certified personal trainer can help. “The best way to learn form is to have a professional assist you so you don’t get hurt,” Joyner says.\n\nGroup exercise classes are another effective option, he notes. In a group exercise class, you can watch other members and receive feedback from an instructor. SilverSneakers instructors are trained in the fitness needs of older adults and can help you nail down the form of new exercises — or show you ways to modify moves so you can exercise safely.\n\nDo: R"
