        "meta_description": "ANGEL PLANELLS (Cadaqués, 1901-1989).\n\"Still life of books\".\nOil on canvas.\nSigned and titled in the lower left-hand corner.\nMeasurements: 50 x 73 cm; 69 x 92,5 cm (frame).\nSurrealist painter, although not all his work developed within this movement. Dalí discovered him when he was very young, when he was fascinated by the fantastic drawings he made in the Mallorquina pastry shop in Cadaqués, where he worked. He soon became friends with René Magritte. In 1929 he moved with his family to Blanes, a town to which he remained linked all his life, despite having settled in Barcelona. He holds his first exhibition at the Dalmau galleries in Barcelona, where he will continue to exhibit his work. Among the great avant-garde artists, he exhibited at the First International Exhibition of Surrealism, held at the New Burlington Galleries (1936), together with Dalí, Miró and Óscar Domínguez. He is represented in the most prestigious collections in the world, such as the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid, the Gala Dalí Foundation, in the private collections of André Breton and Luis Buñuel. The Angel Planells Foundation in Blanes is dedicated to the dissemination and preservation of his work. Caja Madrid organised a major retrospective of his work in 2005.",
