        "meta_description": "The use of dietary supplements is widespread among athletes in all sports and at all levels of competition, as it is in the general population. For the athlete training at the limits of what is sustainable, or for those seeking a shortcut to achieving their aims, supplements offer the prospect of bridging the gap between success and failure. Surveys show, however, that this is often not an informed choice and that the knowledge level among consumers is often low and that they are often influenced in their decisions by individuals with an equally inadequate understanding of the issues at stake. Supplement use may do more harm than good, unless it is based on a sound analysis of the evidence. Where a deficiency of an essential nutrient has been established by appropriate investigations, supplementation can provide a rapid and effective correction of the problem. Supplements can also provide a convenient and time-efficient solution to achieving the necessary intake of key nutrients such as protein and carbohydrate. Athletes contemplating the use of supplements should consider the potential for both positive and negative outcomes. Some ergogenic supplements may be of benefit to some athletes in some specific contexts, but many are less effective than is claimed. Some may be harmful to health of performance and some may contain agents prohibited by anti-doping regulations. Athletes should make informed choices that maximize the benefits while minimizing the risks.",

        "text": "Athletes use dietary supplements in the hope or expectation of a beneficial effect, which, for the elite athlete, generally means a positive effect on competitive performance. Such an effect may be achieved directly, by a specific effect on performance in competition, or indirectly by better health or by enhancing the adaptation to training. An effect in competition may be achieved by acute ingestion of a supplement immediately before or during the event itself, or it may be achieved by ingestion of the substance over a period of days, weeks, or even months beforehand. It is clear from the preceding papers in this series, as well as from the extensive literature on the topic, that some individuals may experience performance benefits from the use of some supplements in well-controlled laboratory conditions. It is equally clear, though, that there is no supplement that will produce positive outcomes for all consumers in all situations, that there are many supplements for which the evidence is equivocal at best, and that there are also many supplements for which there is little or no evidence of efficacy in any context.\n\nThere are several key questions that any athlete should ask before embarking on a program of supplement use, though few have the necessary training and skills to do so. The first is an assessment of the evidence base relating to safety and the second is a similar analysis in relation to efficacy, but most athletes will place these in reverse order. Thirdly, and especially for the elite athlete, the potential for a positive doping test must be considered. Athletes should have a good reason for using a supplement, and this means that there should be evidence of likely health or performance benefits from its use. The evidence relating to performance should be relevant to their own sporting situation, preferably with data collected from athletes competing in the same sport at a similar standard. Health effects may be seen as supporting training and competition performance, but the potential for adverse effects in later life is also highly relevant, though they may not be immediately apparent. It is often the case, however, that the evidence base is limited. Data on elite athletes are particularly scarce, in part because of the potential disruption to training programs and an understandable reluctance to submit to invasive procedures.\n\nAthletes and those who advise them must take responsibility for everything that the athlete consumes, but the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations mean that the athlete remains strictly liable for the presence of any prohibited substance found in an anti-doping specimen, regardless of advice from others. It is na√Øve to simply expect that commercially-available products are effective and safe, and there is a long history of adulteration and contamination of food (Wiley, 1907) and dietary supplements (Swann, 2016) to show otherwise. Even where the evidence shows that a benefit may accrue, this does not mean that every consumer will benefit."
