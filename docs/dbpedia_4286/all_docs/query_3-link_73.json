        "text": "[meteorite-list] Like Rover, Like Asteroid\n\nFrom: Ron Baalke <baalke_at_meteoritecentral.com>\n\nMessage-ID: <200410152259.PAA27164_at_zagami.jpl.nasa.gov>\n\nhttp://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/spotlight/20041011.html\n\nLike Rover, Like Asteroid\n\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n\nOctober 11, 2004\n\nThough they've never seen an asteroid, NASA's two robotic geologists\n\nhave contributed so much to planetary exploration during their journeys\n\nacross Mars that two asteroids have now been named after them. The\n\nrovers are the first planetary missions to be so honored.\n\n\"I think it's cool!\" said Jim Erickson. \"I think everyone on the mission\n\nfeels that way. Those are our rovers. When something is named after\n\nthem, we all get the honor. And those rovers deserve respect.\"\n\nErickson is project manager for the Mars Exploration Rover Mission at\n\nNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.\n\nThe asteroids, named Spirit and Opportunity after NASA's Mars\n\nExploration Rovers, were discovered on Sept. 24, 1960 by Ingrid van\n\nHouten-Groeneveld, Cees J. van Houten, and Tom Gehrels. The trio spotted\n\nthe moving masses of rock on photographic plates of the night sky taken\n\nwith telescopes at Caltech's Palomar Observatory.\n\nBoth rovers have now been exploring Mars for almost three times as long\n\nas originally expected.\n\nThousands of Years of Immortality\n\nIt took more than 40 years to name the asteroids Spirit and Opportunity\n\nbecause both are quite faint. International Astronomical Union rules\n\nrequire asteroids to be observed during four separate cycles around the\n\nEarth and sun before they become eligible for numbering and naming,\n\nexplained Ron Baalke, a software engineer at JPL. The more observations,\n\nthe more precisely scientists can calculate the orbit. Baalke works in\n\nNASA's Near Earth Objects program, where he helps track and calculate\n\nthe orbits of asteroids to identify those whose paths cross that of the\n\nEarth.\n\nSpirit has a diameter of 4 kilometers to 9 kilometers (2.5 miles to 5.6\n\nmiles) and Opportunity has a diameter of 3 kilometers to 7 kilometers\n\n(1.9 miles to 4.4 miles). Van Houten-Groeneveld, who lives in the\n\nNetherlands, proposed the name recently after the asteroids were\n\nassigned an official number in 2002.\n\nBoth asteroids take 7.9 years to complete one orbit around the sun\n\nbetween Mars and the mammoth gaseous planet Jupiter. Neither follows a\n\npath that crosses the orbit of other planets and neither will be knocked\n\nout of orbit by the immense gravitational force of Jupiter. They belong\n\nto a small group of asteroids known as the Hilda group that have a 3:2\n\norbital resonance with Jupiter. This means that each time Jupiter\n\ncompletes two orbits around the sun, the asteroids complete three.\n\nThe honor renders the two Mars rovers immortal in the sense that the\n\nasteroids are in stable orbits that will last for thousands of years.\n\nAsteroid 37452 Spirit\n\nThe asteroid Spirit travels in a path that is tilted 8 degrees from the\n\nplane of the solar system.
