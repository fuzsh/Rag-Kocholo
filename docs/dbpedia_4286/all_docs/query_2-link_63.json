        "text": "Just in time for Women’s History Month, Mirage Hardwood Flooring has released its newest flooring collection inspired by eight remarkable women with enduring legacies. The Muse Collection by Mirage features eight modern White Oak hardwood flooring colours, available in linear and herringbone boards. These choices effortlessly complement the latest interior design styles and allow homeowners to express their taste through this elegant collection.\n\nMeet the Muses\n\nThe Muse Collection pays homage to exceptional women who made significant contributions throughout history. These muses, hailing from various parts of the world, inspire us to make a difference in society. The floors are named in honour of these remarkable women, celebrating their impact on humankind.\n\nAda Lovelace – 1815-1852 – Mathematician and Writer\n\nThis hardwood flooring boasts a whitewashed tone with a brushed finish. The soft, lighter hue adds brightness to any space while still retaining the natural warmth of the wood with the visible texture. It really allows bold design to shine without fading into the background.\n\nGrace Hopper – 1907-1992 – Computer Scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral\n\nA graceful greige tone, this hardwood flooring stain is the quintessential complementary hue to a variety of colour palettes. It particularly stands out in open-plan decor, as the brushed natural texture adds warmth and character.\n\nRachel Carson – 1907-1964 – Marine Biologist and Conservationist\n\nThe best use for this light wood flooring is to soften monochromatic contemporary designs or to subtly balance a room with bold or dark-colour walls. The finish’s neutral undertones adds a quiet luxury to all spaces, no matter the mood of the decor.\n\nMaud Watson 1864-1946 – Tennis Player\n\nThe exquisite brown-beige of this brushed wood flooring creates a cozy atmosphere in any room. The combination of creamy undertones and the texture of natural character lines offer an elegant base for those looking for a timeless space.\n\nIngrid Van Houten-Groeneveld – 1921-2015 – Astronomer\n\nThe sandy neutral of this flooring infuses complexity and character into any room. It is a beautiful choice for statement rooms and works wonderfully when paired with either high- or low-contrast decor.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt – 1884-1962 – Diplomat and Humanitarian\n\nThis rich golden-brown stained hardwood is incredible for those looking to add an earthy element to their space. The light colour is stunning with rich warm tones, such as burnt reds and rustic greens.\n\nAmelia Earhart – 1897-1937 – Aviator\n\nThis bronze-coloured wood flooring will elevate your home with its warm depth and dimension. This flooring boasts subtle variations in tone that is perfect for contemporary designs in cool tones for soft balance.\n\nHattie Larlham – 1917-1996 – Advocate and Humanitarian\n\nThe nutty brown stain of this brushed flooring subtly highlights the natural wood grain of the White Oak. The rich tones beautifully compliment warm and neutral interiors.\n\nWhite Oak for Lasting Beauty\n\nInvesting in hardwood flooring means investing in lasting beauty. White Oak is one of the most aesthetically pleasing wood species, and it blends well with most styles and colour schemes. Mirage designed the Muse Collection colours to allow homeowners to seamlessly integrate traditional and contemporary styles, creating harmony and balance between the old and new. In this way, the collection mirrors the innovative and visionary spirit of the muses.\n\nNot only beautiful, White Oak’s adaptability makes it suitable for residential and even light commercial settings; its high durability and resilience withstand high-traffic areas. The Muse Collection hardwood floors boast a 3-ply structure, providing a durable foundation for your living space. Mirage’s exclusive DuraMatt® finish offers up to 35 years of wear-through protection for residential applications, ensuring your floors stay beautiful for years.\n\nThe Muse Collection by Mirage at West Wind Hardwood\n\nVisit our Flooring Gallery to see this timeless flooring collection in person. We also provide samples to take home so you can explore the quality and craftsmanship that sets Mirage’s Muse Collection apart. This Canadian-made flooring is a superior choice for beauty and durability, and it is made from the finest responsibly sourced wood from managed forests.\n\nEmbrace the spirit of remarkable women, express your individuality, and let the Muse Collection be the canvas for your style. Elevate your home with the enduring allure of Mirage Floors and celebrate the legacies of inspiring women."
