Excerpt: Marie Eugène François Thomas Dubois (28 January 1858 16 December 1940) was a Dutch paleoanthropologist. He earned worldwide fame for his discovery of Pithecanthropus erectus (later redesignated Homo erectus), or 'Java Man'. Although hominid fossils had been found and studied before, Dubois was the first anthropologist to embark upon a purposeful search for them. Dubois was born and raised the oldest of four children in a Catholic family in the village of Eijsden, Limburg, where his father, Jean Dubois was an apothecary, later the mayor. Interested in all phenomena of the world of nature, Eugène explored the \"caves\" (\"grotten\", actually underground limestone mines) of Mount St. Pieter and amassed collections of plant parts, stones, insects, shells, and animal skulls. From age 12-13 on, he attended school in the Limburg city of Roermond, boarding with a family there and then he dropped out. In Roermond he attended lectures on Charles Darwin's new theory of evolution given by the German biologist, Karl Vogt. Resisting his father's plan for him to train to follow in his footsteps, Dubois, encouraged by his teachers, decided in 1877 to study medicine at the University of Amsterdam. While a student, he taught anatomy at both of the brand new (founded 1880) art schools housed at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (Amsterdam State Museum) the Rijksschool voor Kunstnijverheid (State School for Applied Arts) and the Rijksnormaalschool voor Teekenonderweizer...More: http://booksllc.net/?id=318898 ...
