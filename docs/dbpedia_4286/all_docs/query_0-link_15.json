It was discovered during the third PalomarâLeiden Trojan survey on 16 October 1977, by Ingrid and Cornelis van Houten at Leiden, and Tom Gehrels at the Palomar Observatory in California.[1] It is likely spherical in shape and has a longer-than-average rotation period of 27.68 hours.[9] The assumed C-type asteroid is one of the 80 largest Jupiter trojans. It was named after Panthous from Greek mythology.[1]",
