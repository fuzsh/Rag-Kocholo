He plays great roles in Shakespeare dramas. \"Scofield Associates,\" local Maryland (USA) vendor, probably low risk since they don't even have a web site Themeable according to his great roles in Shakespeare plays like MacBeth Henry V (Not convinced this is an appropriate visual theme. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Bhanji or Kingsley \"Sir Ben Kingsley born as Krishna Bhanji is a legendary british actor like Willoughby Goddard. He plays historical persons like Mahatma Gandhi, Simon Wiesenthal and Wladimir Iljitsch Lenin None found Themeable according to his great historical roles (Not convinced this is an appropriate visual theme. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Bacon Like Willoughby Goddard, Kevin Bacon is a legendary actor (although not British). (Furthermore Bacon as well as Goddard are both names of asteroids discovered by van Houten, C. J., van Houten-Groeneveld, I. and Gehrels, T.) There's a Bacon Software and there's Jono Bacon, but we seem ok in terms of operating systems/Linux-related collisions. Infinite possibilities. Bacon strips, cute little piggies in the background, a Canadian Bacon wallpaper for our users in that country. And other scientific stuff too, I suppose. Bonus: using \"is a person to whom other people claim connection\" as the connection - see Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and the Erdos number - we could name F15 \"Erdos,\" which gives us the option of linking out to tons of cool math stuff. Korolyov Goddard is a space flight center and so is Korolyov. Scientist, city... (Not convinced this is an appropriate visual theme. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Baudelaire Stuart Leslie Goddard[1] is a famous artist with bipolar disorder. So was Charles Baudelaire.[2] I couldn't find anything related to software/IT/technology trademarks. Baudelaire was an french writer/poet, so his work could probably inspire our artists. Only the name of his most famous work \"Les fleurs du Mal\" (meaning \"The flowers of Evil\") could provide some ideas... (Could you please elaborate a bit more about the types of poetry/writing he did, and whether or not the subject matter is appropriate for a Fedora theme? --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Tsiolkovsky Robert H. Goddard was an early rocketry pioneer and so was Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. No easy collisions in software, IT, computers, technology Plenty of theme opportunities in rockets and spaceflight (Please let's not repeat the visual theme of F13 in F14. Been there, done that, we need something fresh. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Button Goddard is a typo in the name of a famous film director. So is Button. [3] No obvious collisions (How will the design team create a visual theme around this name? --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Mitikas Goddard is a peak [4] so is Mitikas. Rubbia Peter Goddard is a mathematical physicist and Carlo Rubbia [5] is a physicist who won a Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the W and Z particles at CERN. No collisions It can be themeable according to physics, atoms, and maybe CERN (These suggestions are not very inspired, can you try to come up with something more compelling? --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Neper Goddard is a Moon crater in Mare Marginis [6] so is his nearest brother - Neper. Neper project not updated for about year [7] space, stars, galaxies, lunar modules, possibly black and white theme also view of earth from moon is amazing (We've done space twice now F10 and F13. I really would rather us not repeat a space theme again in F14. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Tudek Goddard is an archaeological site [8] in North America where a 2nd century Norwegian coin was found. Tudek is also an archaeological site in North America.[9] No collisions found Themed with artifacts, exploration, maps, compasses (Indiana Jones type stuff) (Could you tell us a bit more about the specifics of the Goddard site and what properties of it might make a compelling visual theme? --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Fytnargin Goddard is a mountain with elevation 4134m and so is Fytnargin in Russia None found Chaplin Paulette Goddard[10] was a silent film's actress also was Charles Chaplin genetic haplotype software, very old Actors, Silent films, 1920' (Not yet convinced this is an appropriate visual theme. Can you come up with some more specific and compelling ideas? --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Laughlin Robert Goddard was a professor of physics, and so is Robert Laughlin.[11]. He was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in physics for his explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect. Moreover he argues for emergence which is a concept that says \"The whole is more than the sum of its parts\". Fedora is more than the sum of its software. Laughlin is a town in Nevada (USA). John Mc Laughlin is a musician. Clarence John Laughlin was a photographer. Laughlin is also a memorial hosptial in Tennessee. [Nothing specific in software. --pfrields] Something that can illustrate the emergence concept, like multiple objects combined to create a new one (more complex). Beardmore The Goddard coin is an ancient Norse artifact and so are the Beardmore Relics [12]. No software related trademarks found Vikings, sea, ships, medieval weapons, exploration, artifacts Lausanna (or Lausanne) Goddard[13] is the name of a main belt asteroid, named in memory of the American rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard. Lausanna is a main belt asteroid too, named after the Swiss town Lausanne. (Lausanna is the old spelling of Lausanne.[14]) Not found Lausanne is famous for its geographical situation on the shores of Lake Geneva (lac léman) and vis-à-vis to the Alps (view from near Lausanne, lac léman), so possible themes are lake, mountains (Alps), town, vines, ships etc.\n\nasteroids, astronomy/cosmos in general etc. (We've done space themes in F10 and F13. It's getting old and tired. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Alfvén Goddard[13] and Alfvén are both asteroids of the so-called “main belt” that are both discovered by Cornelis Johannes van Houten, Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld and Tom Gehrels. The asteroid Alfvén is named after Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén, a (plasma) physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Phisics for his work on magnetohydrodynamics.(Alfvén is also the name of a great Swedish composer so there are many possible names for Fedora 15.) Not found abstract themes on magnetohydrodynamics or plasma phenomena (e.g. earth’s magnetic field, plasma globe or thunder), maybe including the Fedora logo (similar the great DNA theme in FC 6)\n\nasteroids, astronomy/cosmos in general etc. (We've done space themes in F10 and F13. It's getting old and tired. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Shepard Robert H. Goddard was an American rocketry pioneer, Alan Shepard was the first American in space. [1] Originally I misspelled the name 'Shepherd' it is correctly spelled 'Shepard' there are no IT/Software hits on google under the correct spelling. [Minor hit at http://shepard.ca, probably not a risk. --pfrields] Exploring more opportunities in space related themes. (Space themes are getting old.) Celebi Robert H. Goddard[15] was a physicist and so was Celebi[16] Word is Turkish for gentleman. There is also a pokemon character by that name[17] http://www.celebisoftware.com/ though this appears to be an old site. --pfrields The Ottoman Turk aviator Hezarfen Ahmet Celebi made a successful glider flight with artificial wings between 1630-1632. Beers Calvin Goddard is a Dartmouth College alumni as is Rand Beers Both were involved in politics also Beer kegs, hardware, etc Not sure this is a suitable theme even though many people like beer. Also, not unusual enough. --pfrields Ventnor Goddard is a brewery on the Isle of Wight as is Ventnor. Ventnor City has Ventnor Boatworks etc Geting out of this one might be difficult? Themes? Isle of Wight or the city in New Jersey. Jersey is very popular today. Hoppin Goddard is a building on Brown University AND so is Hoppin. 1988 video game Hoppin mad. Hoppin John is black-eyed peas (or field peas) and rice, with chopped onion and sliced bacon, seasoned with a bit of salt. Not sure about the theming but the name isn't bad. Hoppin could be themed as happening. This allows for huge freedoms in theme ( maybe too much.) Could also be themed with a frog, pond trees, ocean, nature (it's not space.) Hoppin was also an artist- his varied subject matter provides numerous theme possibities Laramie Goddard is a mountain and so is Laramie. No conflicts with linux/os Nothing is more themeable than mountains and nature. --Tareq Al Jurf 27 April 2010 (UTC)) Faickney Goddard is a creativity technique , and so is Faickney. No tech collision. A good suggestion, but how do we get out? Themeable , the name is the author of the creativity technique named brainstorming. The Creative Problem Solving Process (CPS) was developed by Alex Faickney Osborn Mythcat 08:23, 27 April 2010 (UTC)). Guinness Sir Alec Guinness was a legendary british actor like Willoughby Goddard. He plays in great movies like Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, Hotel Paradiso and so on. No easy collisions in IT, computers, technology. Red Hat 7 was codenamed 'Guinness'. Reusing old Red Hat Linux names is not preferred. Themeable according to his great movies like \"Lawrance of Arabia\" (an arabic like dessert theme) (I'm not convinced this makes for a compelling visual theme. --Duffy 03:29, 26 April 2010 (UTC)) Astro Goddard is a fictional dog character in a cartoon series and so is Astro. Many collisions with computer stores. Marshall Goddard is a space flight center and so is Marshall. Numerous collisions in technology and computers. (a) Historical Western Films (b) Rebuilding (Marshall Plan) Neutron Goddard is the name of Jimmy Neutron's dog in a cartoon series. Jimmy Neutron was also a scientist in the series. Numerous computer stores. Lots of color scheme options with atoms, neutrons, protons, etc. Vortex Goddard is the name of a main character in Jimmy Neutron cartoon series, so is Cindy Vortex. Numerous collisions in IT and computers. [Negative connotations. --pfrields] Lots of vortices themes options. Aberdeen Goddard is a place in Maryland, as is Aberdeen. Aberdeen Group offers services in IT/consulting industry. Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD is a leader in United States Army research and development, so Army related themes would be appropriate. Elizabeth Robert H. Goddard is a famous person who lived in Worcester, Massachusetts, so is Elizabeth Bishop, a highly-regarded 20th century poet. No collisions, only localized results pertaining to Elizabeth, New Jersey. Very common name, not unusual enough. Elizabeth Bishop was poet laurete of the United States from 1949 - 1950; a noir theme reflecting the style of the era would work well (watch the film \"LA Confidential\"; also think about the color scheme of 1950s retro-noir ads you've seen). Lakeland Goddard is a fast growing city in Kansas and so is Lakeland in Florida [18] Lakeland Micro Swans are kind of a mascot for the city. Also, the Florida aspect could be included with Sunny skies or beaches. Turing Peter Goddard is a British scientist educated at Cambridge University, as was Alan Turing There is a trademark held by Holt Software Associates for their language \"Turing\", I don't know if that would preclude its use here. It would seem that Alan Turing himself is more commonly associated with the term than their product. [Turing Pvt Ltd also generates a hit. --pfrields] I think some cool things could be done with the concept of a Turing engine or cryptography. Gama Goddard (,John) was a famous explorer and goal achiever, as was Vasco da Gama (15th century Portuguese Navigator known worldwide as he spearheaded the World Discoveries). No coalitions with IT world [GNU Gama and NEES grid certificate management software show up, not sure about TMs. --pfrields] Freedom (adventure, exploration), First (First in many things as Vasco da Gama), Friends (explore together) > convert to freedom, exploration, first, leading. Not much problems with internationalization of \"Gama\" where it's very close in phonetics to \"gamma\". Robert Goddard is an American college established in 1863 (in Vermont), and so is Robert (in Turkey). No obvious IT trademark on Robert; Robert Ludlum (an author, deceased) apparently a trademark of Myn Pyn, LLC. Robert Young was CEO of Red Hat. Very common name, not unusual enough. Educational or learning theme (Pallas) Goddard[13] and Pallas are both asteroids of the so-called “main belt”. The latter is also the largest asteroid and the the second asteroid to have been discovered. See the comment above. Otherwise there are thousands of other names of asteroids that could be used instead of “Pallas” (but they would probably be less nice ^^). Update: Could be a trademark issue, see [19] asteroids, astronomy/cosmos in general, Greco-Roman mythology etc.[20] Europa (For the case that there is a trademark problem with “Pallas”:) Europa is also (among others) the name of an asteroid.[21] Too generic to be a trademark problem IMHO. [Europa Software could be a problem. --pfrields] thousand of possibilities (see also above) Nittany Goddard is a mountain and so is Nittany. No conflicts with linux/os [Several hits in software and e/commerce --pfrields] Nothing is more themeable than mountains and nature. --Tareq Al Jurf 27 April 2010 (UTC)) Slocombe Goddard is Young Mr. Grace's driver in the TV show, \"Are You Being Served?\" as is Mrs. Slocombe, the Senior of the Ladies' Department. No tech collision. \"Humphry Slocombe\" is the name of an ice cream store. Themeability. And the quote submitted to the right sounds pretty unsuitable. --pfrields Everyone loves Mrs Slocombe's pussy! (Note: I see pfrields is not a fan of PBS.) [Am too! How else would I have been able to watch Dr. Who, Upstairs/Downstairs, and I, Claudius? :-) --pfrields] Valentine (or Valentina) Robert Goddard was a rocketry pioneer, and so is first woman in space[22] Valentine Services Weak link, space connection, more unusual name needed Tolkien Cliff Goddard[23] is a linguist, and so is JRR Tolkien[24]. Couldn't find any technology related collisions. As far as I know Tolkien is not a trademarked term. Note: JRR Tolkiens property is owned by Tolkien State[25] and merchandise rights by Tolkien Enterprise[26]. As far as copyrighted work is not used and only content inspired by JRR Tolkiens legendarium is used, it should be ok. This seems to common a name, at least in geeky circles. Themeable according themes inspired by JRR Tolkien's legendarium[27]. For example places, races, architecture, landscape, language and writing, etc. found in his work such as Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Silmarillion, etc. can be used as such inspirations. Paulette Paulette Goddard - American film and theatre actress, major star of the Paramount Studio in the 1940s[28] Paulette Electronics Does not pass \"is a\" test, better link used above.

Katyusha Records software, but this looks to be a dead project. Does not pass \"is a\" test Themable according to its use in wars till today, so fedora will have: Power, Speed, Weapon... Worcester Robert Hutchings Goddard (October 5, 1882 – August 10, 1945), U.S. professor of physics and scientist, was a pioneer of controlled, liquid-fueled rocketry. Goddard was born in 1882 in Worcester, Massachusetts, Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, Worcester is often referred to as the \"Heart of the Commonwealth\". A few local store collisions, nothing in OS field Does not pass \"is a\" test Emancipation Goddard (College) is an American institution established in 1863, and so is the Emancipation Proclamation (something of a stretch, but a cool name, imo -- note that 1863 was the year the announcement made in 1862 went into effect). \"Software Emancipation Technology\" was a software company in Massachusetts that appears to now be called \"Progress Software\" (and \"Upspring\" prior to that). Does not pass \"is a\" test Freedom/Liberation theme Apollo Goddard Space Flight Center is a NASA installation. The Apollo Program was NASA's project to land the first human on the moon. Apollo M. O. Smith was an American rocket scientist as was Robert H. Goddard. Since Apollo was both an Ancient Greek as well as a Roman god, there are plenty of collisions everywhere (including hard- and software products and companies) but exactly because of the fact that the term has been used for literally thousands of years and is very famous it's so generic that I don't think that should be much of a trademark problem. Apollo was the codename for Red Hat Linux 5.2 Reusing old Red Hat Linux names is not preferred. Does not pass \"is a\" test. Ancient Greek and Roman gods, mythology. The fact that he was god of music, healing, prophecy and enlightenment seems to fit Fedora as a project well. There seems to be an Apollo in almost everything [30] which provides nearly endless possibilities. Saturn It's a planet (named after a Roman god) and the rocket used for the Apollo program It has been used before in the industry for a gaming console. Common name. Does not pass \"is a\" test. The rings of Saturn can be visualized in a theme. Laika Goddard is the first person in the world to build and launch a rocket AND Laika (the dog) is the first living creature to be a rocket passenger. --iskida Does not pass \"is a\" test. Orange-Glo Goddards is a range of cleaning products, and so is Orange-Glo. Although a product name, there is no correlation to anything IT based pertaining to the name. Well-known trademarks, even if not in IT field, aren't usable. --pfrields Themeable, one can already picture the startup Plymouth screen and the wallpaper at the mention of Orange-Glo. Pleo Goddard is a robot and so is Pleo. Well-known trademark makes this unusable. --pfrields Pleo is pet robot with artificial intelligence <http://www.bobthepleo.com/forums/ Pleo>"
