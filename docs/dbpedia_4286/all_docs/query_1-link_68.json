J. van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld on photographic plates taken by Tom Gehrels at Palomar Observatory near Pauma Valley, California. It has a period of 11 years, 265 days.\n\nIt was named for Laërtes, king of Ithaca, the father of Odysseus. Laertes is also a major character in William Shakespeare's play Hamlet.\n\nAstrologically, it seems to have to do with having to rely on oneself, being deprived of support ."
