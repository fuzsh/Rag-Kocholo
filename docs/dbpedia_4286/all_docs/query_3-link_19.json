        "text": "812 Adele (prov. designation: or ) is an elongated Eunomia asteroid from the central regions of the asteroid belt. It was discovered on 8 September 1915, by Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The presumed S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.9 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was likely named after the character \"Adele\" in the opera Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss. When applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements, Adele is a core member of the Eunomia family (), a prominent family of stony S-type asteroids and the largest one in the intermediate main belt with more than 5,000 known members. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,585 days; semi-major axis of 2.66 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. Adele was discovered by Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula 8 September 1915. Three nights later, on 11 September 1915, it was independently discovered by Max Wolf the Heidelberg Observatory in Germany. The Minor Planet Center however, only credits the first discoverer. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg on 25 October 1902. The body's observation arc begins at the Bergedorf Observatory on 19 September 1915, less than two weeks after its official discovery observation. This minor planet was likely named after \"Adele\", Rosalinde's maid, a character in the operetta Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss (1825–1899). The name was given by the independent discoverer Max Wolf. The author of the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel, learned about the meaning of the asteroid's name from R. Bremer and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld, latter who worked as a young astronomer at Heidelberg. Based on the overall spectral type of the Eunomia family, Adele is likely a common, stony S-type asteroid."
