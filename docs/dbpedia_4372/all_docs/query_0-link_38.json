Thanks to Petco Love, we’re extending our 4X match opportunity through August 31.\n\nWith more than 600 pets currently in our care, our shelter is bursting at the seams and our resources are stretched to the limit. Follow the link below to help us earn this essential $90,000 match today!\n\nAugust is National Make-A-Will Month, the perfect time to ensure your loved ones, both two- and four-legged, are cared for.\n\nCreate your will with FreeWill—a free and easy resource used by over a million people.\n\nJoin the pack and make a life-saving difference for 10,000 pets and the people who love them each year, all at no immediate cost."
