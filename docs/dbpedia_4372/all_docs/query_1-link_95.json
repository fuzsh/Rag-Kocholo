These two museum passes cannot be used on the same day; each cardholder is limited to a total of one pass each day.\n\nKidsQuest Museum and Bellevue Arts Museum allow one pass to be reserved per household every 90 days. All other museums allow one pass to be reserved per cardholder every 90 days.\n\nReserved, but unused, passes are considered checked out. Unused passes apply towards these limits.\n\nYou will get this error if your library card expired. Cards expire when not used for two years. Please contact library staff if your account is not working.\n\nYou may reserve a pass for the same museum every 90 days.\n\nKidsQuest Museum and Bellevue Arts Museum passes are limited to one pass per household.

Accounts with over $75 in fees cannot borrow items. This includes checking out museum passes.\n\nPlease contact library staff if your account is not working.\n\nYou might get this error if you typed the card incorrectly. Please try again. You may also get this error if your card is marked “inactive” or no longer is in our system.
