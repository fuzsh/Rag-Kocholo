        "text": "You should always get this list before moving in. It describes the condition and cleanliness of the unit or its furnishings. It is very important. The landlord may try to blame you for damages that were there when you moved in. With the list, you can prove the damages were already there.\n\nThe check-in list should specifically describe the condition and cleanliness of the rental unit and describe any existing damages. The checklist must specifically describe the condition of appliances, furnishings, carpet, walls, and any other part of the rental unit.\n\nDo not let the landlord leave anything off, even if they say they are going to fix the damage or will remember it was there. Do not sign the list until it is right!\n\nIf you pay a deposit, the landlord must give you a Condition Check-In List. You and the landlord must sign it.\n\nGet a copy of this checklist. Keep it in a safe place. If you lose your copy, you can ask the landlord for 1 free replacement copy.\n\nRCW 59.18.260\n\nYou have 4 options:\n\n1. You can move out\n\nYou can move out if the landlord does not make repairs within the required time and does not fix the situation within a reasonable time. You just need to give the landlord written notice that you are moving and the reason why. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.090(1).\n\nThe landlord must return your deposits and the equivalent of the rent for the days you have already paid. Example: Your refrigerator breaks. You give the landlord proper written notice. They do not fix it after 72 hours. You move out on July 6. You have already paid rent for all of July. The landlord must give you back the equivalent of the rent for the rest of the 25 days in July.\n\n2. You can go to court or mediation\n\nYou can hire a lawyer and go to court to force the landlord to make repairs. You cannot sue for repairs in Small Claims Court.\n\nIf the landlord agrees, you can go to mediation. This is usually cheaper and quicker than court. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.090(2).\n\n3. You can hire someone yourself to make the repairs and subtract the amount from rent\n\nYou can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.100. Be careful! This legal process can be complicated. Try to get legal help before you do this and read Tenants: If you need repairs.\n\n*Important: You must be up to date in rent and utilities to use this method. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.080.\n\nCan I make as many repairs as I want? - RCW 59.18.100(2)\n\nNo. There are limits to the cost of repairs you can make by hiring someone to do it and deducting the cost from your rent.\n\nEach repair must cost less than 2 months' rent if you hire someone or less than 1 month's rent if you do the work yourself.\n\nYou cannot spend more than 2 months' rent on repairs in any 12-month period if you hire someone or more than 1 month's rent if you do the work yourself.\n\nExamples:\n\nYour monthly rent is $750. You hired someone to make repairs in March. That cost $1,500. You could deduct $750 from April's rent and $750 from May's rent. You would not have to pay rent for April or May.\n\nYour rent is $750 a month. The repair cost was $1,000. You could deduct $750 from April's rent and the final $250 from May's rent.\n\n4. Make the repairs yourself\n\n*Important: You must be up to date in rent and utilities to use this method. RCW 59.18.080.\n\nWe describe the method for this in detail in Tenants: If you need repairs. After you give proper notice and wait the required time, depending on the problem, you can fix the problem yourself in a skilled, competent way. If you repair something badly, the landlord can hold you responsible.\n\nYou must give the landlord a chance to inspect your work. Then you can subtract the cost of materials and your own labor from next month's rent. Each repair you do yourself must cost less than 1/2 month's rent. You cannot spend more than 1 month's rent on repairs you do yourself in each 12-month period. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.100(3).\n\nExample: Your monthly rent is $800. In March, you made 4 separate repairs. Each cost you $200. You could deduct $800 from April's rent. You would not pay rent in April.\n\nThe law prohibits a landlord from taking certain actions against you:\n\nLockouts - RCW 59.18.290\n\nEven if you are behind in rent, the landlord cannot lock you out of the unit, change locks, add new locks, or keep you from entering the unit in any other way. Read My landlord locked me out to learn more.\n\nUtility Shut-offs - RCW 59.18.300\n\nA landlord can only shut off utilities to make repairs. The landlord cannot shut off your utilities because you owe rent or to try to make you move out.\n\nIt is also illegal for the landlord to purposely not pay the utility bills to get the service turned off. You can sue the landlord and get damages if they shut off your utilities. Read My landlord shut off my utilities to learn more.\n\nIf you live in a manufactured housing community and the landlord has not paid the water bill, read My landlord has not paid their water bill to learn more.\n\nTaking Your Property - RCW 59.18.310\n\n*It is illegal for a rental agreement to say the landlord can take your property.\n\nThe landlord can only take your things if you abandon the unit.\n\nIf the landlord takes your things, first contact the landlord in writing. If you do not get your things back that way, get legal help.\n\nYou can also start a Small Claims case against the landlord for the return of your things. The judge could award you up to $5,000. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.230.\n\nRenting Condemned Property - RCW 59.18.085\n\nLandlords cannot rent property that is condemned or unlawful to occupy because of code violations. You might be able to sue the landlord if you find out they knew they rented you property with major code violations. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nIf the rental is condemned while you are living there, the landlord must give you 30 days' notice and also give you financial help to move. Read Tenants' Rights: My place has been condemned to learn more.\n\nRetaliatory Actions against You - RCW 59.18.240 & RCW 59.18.085(1)\n\nThe landlord cannot take revenge on you (retaliate against you) for exercising your legal rights or making a complaint to a code enforcement agency. The law presumes a landlord is retaliating if the landlord does any of these:\n\nRaise the rent\n\nReduce your services\n\nIncrease your obligations\n\nEvict you within 90 days after you assert your rights, after you report the landlord to a government agency, or after an inspection or proceeding by a government agency due to your report.\n\nThese cases can be tricky. If you think the landlord is retaliating against you illegally, try to get legal help. Here are some examples of possible retaliation:\n\nYou reported a bedbug infestation to the city. The city notifies the landlord that they are inspecting the place. The landlord then tells you he is raising the rent.\n\nYou properly notify the landlord that you are deducting costs for repairs from your rent. The landlord gets this notice and then shuts off your water utility service.\n\nIf the landlord raises the rent or gives you an eviction notice within 90 days of a legal action you took against them, it may count as retaliation and be illegal. Try to get legal help if you think this is happening. You may be able to sue the landlord. Retaliation may also be a defense to an eviction lawsuit.\n\nIf you have a month-to-month agreement - RCW 59.18.200(1)(a)\n\nYes. You must send the landlord a letter saying you are moving out. The landlord must get the letter at least 20 days before the end of the rental period.\n\nThe end of the rental period is the day before rent is due. The day you deliver the notice does not count in the 20 days.\n\nExample: Your rent is due July 1. You want to move out in June. Get the letter to the landlord no later than June 9.\n\nIf you have experienced threatening behavior by another tenant or your landlord, or you have experienced domestic violence, you may be able to end your rental agreement faster. Read Landlord/Tenant Issues for Survivors of Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault, and/or Stalking to learn more.\n\nService Members in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves or National Guard: You can end a month-to-month tenancy or a lease with less than 20 days' notice if you get immediate assignment orders. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.200.\n\nIf you do not give proper notice, you must pay rent for the month after you move out or Rent for 30 days from the day the landlord finds out you moved, whichever comes first. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.310(1).\n\nThe landlord must try to re-rent the place as soon as they find out you moved. If they can rent it less than 30 days after you moved, you must pay only for the days it was empty. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.310. After the next month, you do not have to pay anything.\n\nIf you have a lease\n\nIf you move out at the end of a lease, you usually do not have to give the landlord any notice. Check your lease to make sure.\n\nIf you stay beyond the end of a lease and the landlord accepts rent for the next month, you become a \"month-to-month\" renter. All rules for month-to-month renters now apply to you.\n\nIf you leave before the end of your lease, you have to pay the rent for all the months left in the lease or all rent owed before the landlord was able to re-rent the unit, whichever is less. You can read the law about this at RCW 59.18.310(2).\n\n*Service Members in the U.S. Armed Forces, Reserves or National Guard: If you have a lease, you must give the landlord 7 days' notice of any permanent change of station or deployment order. RCW 59.18.200.\n\nFor not paying rent\n\nIf you are behind in rent, even by 1 day, your landlord may give you a 14-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Vacate.\n\nRead My landlord just gave me a 14-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Vacate to learn more.\n\nFor missing a payment under your deposit installment plan - RCW 59.18.283\n\nYou can ask for an installment plan to pay your move-in costs. If you miss a payment under a written deposit installment plan, it is treated as if you didn't pay rent. Your landlord can serve you a 14-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Vacate.\n\nIf you pay what you owe under the payment plan within 14 days after getting the notice, your landlord must accept it and cannot evict you. If you do not pay the amount within 14 days and you do not move out, your landlord can start an eviction lawsuit against you.\n\nFor not following the rental agreement - RCW 59.18.283\n\nIf you substantially break an important term of the rental agreement, the landlord can give you a 10-day notice. If you fix the problem within 10 days after you get the notice, the landlord must stop the eviction process.\n\nFor example, you got a cat despite the rental agreement's \"no pets\" rule. The landlord sends you a notice to correct the issue or move out within 10 days. You find a new home for the cat.\n\nRead My Landlord Just Gave Me a 10-Day Notice to Comply or Vacate to learn more.\n\nOther kinds of activity - RCW 59.18.180\n\nIf you use the property for drug-related or gang-related activity, substantially interfere with the neighbors' or landlord's right to use and enjoy their own homes, assault someone on the premises or use a gun or other deadly weapon, or damage the property value, the landlord may only have to give you a 3-Day Notice before starting an eviction lawsuit against you. You may not get time to try to fix the problem.\n\nRead My Landlord Just Gave Me a 3-Day Notice to Quit to learn more.\n\nOther good reasons the landlord can make you move\n\nThere are a few other \"good reasons\" the landlord can make you move. They include lying on your rental application and registering on a sex offender. Each of these reasons has its own type of notice the landlord must give you. Read Landlord must give a \"good\" reason to end a tenancy or not renew a lease to learn more.\n\nWhat if I am still living in the unit after the time on the notice is up?\n\nThe landlord can start an eviction court case against you. In Washington, we call the process an Unlawful Detainer Action. To start the process, the landlord must deliver to you two court forms called a Summons and Complaint for Unlawful Detainer.\n\nMake at least 2 copies of each. Hand deliver one copy to the landlord or their lawyer. Ask the landlord's lawyer or secretary to stamp both the copy you are keeping and the copy you are giving them with the date and time. Keep your copy for proof you delivered it to them before the deadline listed on the Summons. If you cannot deliver your written response in person, you may have to mail or fax your response.\n\nNext, if there is already a case number on the Summons and Complaint, you must file the forms at Superior Court. Take the originals to the Superior Court in the county listed on the Summons.\n\nIf there is no case number on the Summons and Complaint, keep your originals for now. Wait to receive the case number in the mail or by hand delivery. Then take the original \"Notice of Appearance\" (and \"Answer\", if you are filing one) you filled out to the Superior Courthouse in the county listed on the Summons."
