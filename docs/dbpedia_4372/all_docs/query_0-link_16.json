        "text": "Restrictive covenants were one of the reasons that across many generations people of color found it difficult to live in Pierce County except at Fort Lewis. In 1970, nearly one-third of the county's Black population were attached to the military. Most of the rest lived in Hilltop neighborhood near the bend in the I-5 freeway. Asian and Latino people numbered only 5373, a quarter of them stationed at the military base. The census counted 3343 Puyallup people and other Indigenous Americans in 1970 but the tribe had lost control of reservation lands. Overall, the county population was 93% white. These numbers reflect patterns of both segregation and exclusion. And that history plays out today in homeownership rates, family wealth, and other effects of exclusion and inequality.\n\nThe links below lead to four pages featuring different kinds of maps, lists, and information. Two show the locations of restrictive covenants. One demonstrates the lingering effects of differential access to homeownership. The fourth maps the neighborhood-by-neighborhood distributions of African Americans, Asian Americans, Indigenous Americans, Latinos, and Whites across six decades."
