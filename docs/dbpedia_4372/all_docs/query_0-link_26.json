        "text": "Click here to open a PDF version of this tip sheet.\n\nPlanning and Development Services does not currently process any permits for Underground Storage Tanks or Above Ground Storage tanks. Our Historical Permit Records may contain reference to these types of installations located on our Inspection Cards however this is infrequent.\n\nRecommended contacts for UST/AST records:\n\nWashington State Department of Ecology\n\nPierce County Health Department\n\nTacoma Fire Department\n\nGetting Started\n\nYou can start your search by using the GovMe map to review Environmental Data layers then move onto our DART map and Historical Permit Record search to review Inspection Cards.\n\nGovMe map\n\nOur original GIS mapping system can be found by going to: TacomaPermits.org/ and selecting the maps icon in the lower right hand side of the screen, then choose govME MapGuide or use the following direct link: https://www.govme.org/gMap/MGMain.aspx\n\nThis map has multiple layers under the Environmental Data category which reveal records of Contaminated Site / UG Tanks as provided by Pierce County. The yellow information box will appear when you hover over the tank.\n\nPermit Records\n\nThe following instruction will help guide you through the process of searching for permit records focusing on the Inspection Cards. These Inspection Cards are the only documents that Planning and Development Services would have that would contain UST or AST records.\n\nDart Map\n\nOur DART map can be found by going to: TacomaPermits.org/ and selecting the Maps Icon in the lower right hand side of the screen, then choose DART Map.\n\nThere are many features in the DART map which you may want to explore including our base maps and layers list. The map also has measuring and drawing tools which can be useful when researching a property or defining a project. However in this How to Guide we will be focusing on address, parcel and permit searches.\n\nOnce you have access to the map you will be able to use the search bar in the upper left hand corner to search for either address or parcel number. Once the address has appeared in the Site Address section you may select it in order for the map to focus on that property. This is the same process for the Parcel search.\n\nIdentify results\n\nOnce the screen has centered on your property you will need to click on the parcel in order to activate the Identify Results window on the left side of the screen. This window will provide you with the parcel details supplied by Pierce County immediately. This shows the parcel number and the primary address.\n\nIf the parcel details do not show an address then you will need to click on the Permit/Site History to reveal the address provided by the City of Tacoma and/or any additional addresses as seen below.\n\nPermit/Site history\n\nThe permit history found on the DART map include various record types. Your search should focus on the Inspection Cards.\n\nInspection Cards (BLD, PLM, MEC records to 2001 and Side Sewer records to the mid-2000’s)\n\nThese files are saved as .TIF image files and are readily available to be reviewed and/or downloaded.\n\nAccela – Historical permit records – govme\n\nThrough our main permitting website, you will be able to search this same database using the address rather than the map. The direct link to this search page is: https://www.govme.org/govME/Permits/Inter /PermitSiteHistory/FindPermit.aspx\n\nThis can also be found by accessing our permitting website at: https://aca-prod.accela.com/tacoma/Default.aspx then selecting the “Historical Permit Records” link.\n\nThis type of search is helpful for properties that may be on a street that had a name change or buildings that may have changed or retired addresses. (Best viewed in Internet Explorer)\n\nStreet Name Changes\n\nMartin Luther King Jr Way = South M Street\n\nStewart St = Stewart Ave\n\nEarnest S Brazill St = South 12th St\n\n(These are just a few examples and not an exhaustive list)\n\nYou will want to search for records under both street names in order to confirm you have all the historical records for each address you provide.\n\nRetired Addresses\n\nWhen a property has multiple addresses associated with it, such as with some commercial buildings, the likelihood that an address has been retired overtime increases. If an address has been retired then it will not show up on our maps.\n\nAs storefronts may be combined or separated, the addresses must be updated as well. When searching for permit records it can sometimes be beneficial to search by the Street Name only and scroll down the list to the address block in question to make sure nothing is overlooked.\n\nAs you can see from the example, the addresses of 1102 and 1104 Martin Luther King Jr Way have been retired, most likely due to the combination of storefronts or a similar change."
