        "text": "Get to Know Downtown Tacoma\n\nDowntown Tacoma’s inhabitants tend to feel a strong sense of ownership. Getting to know people is not hard, and there are few barriers to participating in civic and community life. Tacoma is now a growing city, but the struggle of Tacoma’s past gives it a character and self reflection that is rare in other cities.\n\nWhy Downtown Tacoma is so Great\n\nPeople living in Downtown Tacoma neighborhoods tend to feel a strong sense of ownership of their neighborhood. This has lead to an almost village like vibe amongst the people who live downtown. Getting to know people is not hard, and there are few barriers to participating in civic and community life.\n\nTacoma is now a growing city, but the struggle of Tacoma’s past gives it a character and self reflection that is rare in other cities. Tacomans are constantly asking themselves “Where are we going?” and “What kind of city do we want to be?” which shows how much control and ownership people in this city feel that they have over its direction and culture.\n\nWhat to do in Downtown Tacoma\n\nDowntown Tacoma has bars, coffee shops, new restaurants, theaters, museums, and more. Fun fact, Tacoma is second only to Washington D.C. for the highest number of museums per capita!\n\nArtists from around the world perform at the variety of historic theater venues like the Pantages as well as the iconic Tacoma Dome. Alma Mater is the place to be for great live music. The thriving Downtown Tacoma Farmer’s Market attracts the regions farmers to Broadway every Thursday in the spring and summer."
