        "text": "One thing I realized after moving to Washington is that there are tons of flower fields throughout the state that bloom during the spring and summer months. Visiting these flower fields has become one of my favorite things to do in Washington and the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is a must-do activity when visiting Washington in the spring. I’ve always dreamt of visiting Holland to see their beloved tulip fields, so I was ecstatic to discover that you can see stunning, colorful tulip fields right here in Washington state. The Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is one of the most popular events in Washington, and it attracts thousands of tourists each year from all over the world. It showcases the largest tulip fields in the area and includes other fun activities like street fairs, live music, and more.\n\nWhat is the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival?\n\nThe Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is an annual spring event held in the Skagit Valley region in Western Washington. It's the second largest tulip festival in the United States, with more than 1 million bulbs planted within Skagit Valley alone. The festival takes place every April and lasts through the entire month, with the annual Tulip Festival Street Fair taking place April 19-21 2023 in downtown Mount Vernon. The festival lasts throughout April because the tulip blooms are fully dependent on the weather and there is no guarantee on when they will bloom each year. Because of this, the Skagit Tulip Festival created a bloom map that you can use to view which farms have active blooms or to find out expected bloom dates for tulips in Washington state.\n\nThere are four participating tulip farms in 2023 and instead of purchasing one single ticket to attend the festival, you purchase your admission to each individual farm and plan your visit based on your own schedule. This means you have the flexibility of only visiting one farm if you’d like or spending a few days in Skagit Valley and exploring all four tulip fields. If crowds are not your thing, you can still experience the tulip blooms from your car or side of the road. There are lots of other smaller tulip fields in the area and although you can’t walk through the rows, you can still experience the colorful blooms from a distance.\n\nParticipating Tulip Farms in 2024:\n\nTess Arnold\n\nHi!
