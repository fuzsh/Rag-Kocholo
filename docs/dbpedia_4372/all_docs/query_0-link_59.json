        "text": "Everyone deserves the opportunity to age with dignity in their own home and community.\n\nOne in three adults age 60+ will suffer a fall at home resulting in injury. Adaptive home modifications and repairs such as grab bars, railings, improved lighting, zero step entries, and wheelchair ramps can greatly reduce or eliminate many of these mishaps and resulting injuries.\n\nTacoma/Pierce County Habitat for Humanity works with Pierce County homeowners age 60+ and disabled Veterans of the US Military to create a safe and livable environment where they can age independently in the comfort and stability of their own home by providing both environmental modifications and critical home repairs.\n\nApplication Information\n\nIf you meet all eligibility requirements below, please complete our general intake form. Projects from general intake are assessed in the order they are received, though you can expect a call or email within one week of submission.\n\nEmergency projects are given priority. If you are without heat or hot water, or you need accessibility modifications in order for someone to return home from a medical facility (e.g. ramp installation or door widening), and you meet all the eligibility criteria listed below, please complete this emergency intake form. We respond to emergency intakes within one business day.\n\n(updated: April 2023)\n\nWe also suggest you check this list of repair resources for other programs that may fit your needs."
