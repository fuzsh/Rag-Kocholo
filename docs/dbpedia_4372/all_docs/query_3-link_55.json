Are you looking for a great Tacoma visitor’s guide?

The museum – with its front grill-designed entrance – features more than 300 cars displayed by era or theme. Most of the museum’s vehicles are part of a collection exceeding 3,000 that once belonged to Harold LeMay. Other vehicles on display are on loan from other collections. From Model-Ts to solar-powered cars, the LeMay museum provides a fun experience over four levels.\n\nMuseum of Glass\n\nWatch artists create blown-glass art as part of your visit to the Museum of Glass. As the hometown to internationally-recognized artist Dale Chihuly, Tacoma’s glass museum greets visitors with a reflection pool, whose white glass art installation illuminates at night, creating an amazing view of the downtown attraction. Inside, tour the facility, with special exhibits highlighting the talents of other blown-glass artists. Afterward, check out the blown-glass art on the pedestrian bridge next to the museum.\n\nDune Peninsula Park\n\nAn 11-acre park, named in honor of Dune author and Tacoma native Frank Herbert, Dune Peninsula Park offers a majestic view of Mt. Rainier as part of its trail loop.\n\nWith prairie grass and flowers growing along the trail, built at the former site of a lead and copper smelter plant, the park is considered a major accomplishment for the area’s environment. With mounds for children to play and tables for picnics, Dune Peninsula is a great spot for family time.\n\nAs you walk along the trail, look for harbor seals lounging and frolicking on the rocks in Puget Sound. An art installation features sand worms, as depicted in the novel. Other artwork highlights the area’s industrial past.\n\nWashington State History Museum\n\nTake a stroll through the state’s history with interactive exhibits at the Washington State History Museum. From its earliest days, including Native American life through European settlement, the museum’s displays include dioramas and special exhibits.\n\nThe Washington State History Museum also features a look at the state’s diverse landscape, from mountains to prairies.\n\nPoint Defiance Park\n\nIt’s easy to spend a full day at Point Defiance Park, and still feel like you could use more time. With attractions including a large rose and flower garden, beach, zoo, historic trading post, and a five-mile drive, Point Defiance Park is a beautiful area in Tacoma.\n\nStart your visit with a walk through the park’s gardens. With nine gardens, you’ll enjoy the beauty and fragrance of roses, dahlias, fuchsia, and iris flowers, as well as rhododendrons. An herb garden and Pacific Northwest garden offer additional looks at botanicals. The Japanese Garden features lanterns, as well as a small tea house, footbridge, and pine trees. It’s a picturesque area for relaxing and creating a little zen.\n\nOwen Beach is an excellent spot for sunbathing, walking along the rocky shore, and people watching. Children, and some adults, enjoy wading into the water for a short swim or a little splashing about. Bring a kayak and enjoy some water sports.\n\nPoint Defiance Zoo and Aquarium is home to a group of red wolves, once close to extinct. The zoo has worked over the past few decades to repopulate the wolves, so you’ll see a few of them, including young ones if you’re lucky, as well as placards explaining the wolves’ history and what is being done to save them. The zoo also has a fun otter exhibit, as well as others showcasing elephants, penguins, and a number of additional animals. The zoo’s aquarium includes a look at marine life native to the Pacific Northwest and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nFive Mile Drive includes a drive along the park’s woods, including pull-offs with impressive views of the Sound. Hiking trails are abundant in the woods, in case you feel like hoofing it for a while. You’ll also see raccoons asking for food on the side of the road.\n\nFort Nisqually Living History Museum takes you back to the early 1800s, when the Hudson Bay Company established the post for trade among Indigenous tribes, as well as European fur trappers. With actors portraying residents of the fort, you’ll see them doing work typical of the era, such as blacksmithing. Tour the buildings inside the fort for a realistic look at life during that time.\n\nNorthwest Trek Wildlife Park\n\nWith almost 725 acres, Northwest Trek Wildlife Park takes you on an adventure, offering up-close looks at animals native to the Pacific Northwest, including bobcats, black bears, moose, and even badgers.\n\nA paved walking path leads visitors along a route with great views of animals and forests. For an even more personal experience, reserve a spot on a wildlife tour that takes your personal vehicle along a paved road inside the park’s free roaming area, where you’ll see elk and bison herds, as well as mountain goats.\n\nOr, for true close-ups of the animals, hop aboard a jeep and take a ride on a Keeper’s Adventure Tour, which takes you off-road over 90 minutes, where you can see animals where they live.\n\nTacoma Art Museum\n\nFocusing on Pacific Northwest art, the Tacoma Art Museum’s collection includes more than 5,300 pieces, ranging from the largest museum collection of Dale Chihuly work and Japanese woodblock prints to studio art jewelry.\n\nThe museum is also home to the Haub Family collection of western art, consisting of more than 300 pieces covering two centuries. Opened in 1935, the TAM moved to its current location in 2003.\n\nThe art museum is part of the city’s Museum District, which also includes the Museum of Glass, State History Museum, Children’s Museum, and Historic Union Station.\n\nOther Attractions\n\nTacoma is home to great parks, such as Wright Park, which began as a 20-acre donation to help grow trees in the city’s early days and has grown to about 30 acres with hundreds of trees, statues, and a pond among its attractions. The W.W. Seymour Conservatory includes a greenhouse that’s home to flower and plant exbibits at Wright Park.\n\nThe Tacoma Chinese Reconciliation Park along the waterfront includes a Chinese Gate that invites visitors into the interactive exhibit recognizing Chinese people, who were forced out of the city in 1885 during a period of anti-Chinese hate. The day after forcing people out, Chinese-owned businesses were destroyed. The park was established in the early 1990s during a period of reconciliation, and takes visitors along a historical path of the period’s events, ending with reconciliation.\n\nPlaces to Eat Around Tacoma\n\nTacoma Washington is full of delicious restaurants and bars.
