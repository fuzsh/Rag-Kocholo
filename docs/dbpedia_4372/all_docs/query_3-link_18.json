        "text": "Tacoma earned the nickname “The City of Destiny” in the late-19th century as an up-and-coming port city and has long been home to artists, dreamers, trailblazers, and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe city of Tacoma, Washington, is a bustling urban center with a population of over 220,000 people. As part of a booming economic corridor that stretches from Vancouver, British Columbia, to Portland, Oregon, Tacoma stays true to its blue-collar roots while also nurturing vibrant arts, technology, and healthcare sectors.\n\nThe city boasts numerous historic neighborhoods, each with its own distinct identity. In Tacoma, you can find handmade gems at locally-owned shops on 6th Avenue; explore museums, browse through antiques, or catch a concert downtown; pick up fresh produce at a farmer’s market in the Proctor District; hike through old growth forest in Point Defiance Park; or go for a jog by the water along Ruston Way."
