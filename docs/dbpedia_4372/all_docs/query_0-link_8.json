        "text": "I have lived in Tacoma for about 15 years. For a while it seemed the city was really coming together and it was a cool place to be, fast forward to now and I am just trying to save enough to get out of here! North End real estate prices forced us from the safer area and we bought a beautiful old home in the South end. We loved this neighborhood just 6 years ago and it was diverse and friendly. Wish we could take our house and drop it anywhere but Tacoma now! The crime, homelessness, drug use, deaths, homicides, thefts, list goes on... makes it quite depressing to be here. I fall asleep to gun shots almost nightly and that is something I never expected to have to get used to as an adult. But I have, and it's just sad being here now. If you are unable to afford the 800k-5mil price tag on real-estate, you will be forced to live in areas that are quite unsafe now.\n\nTacoma is very casual. Lots of parks and splash pads open in the summertime for Kids! We love Spanish restaurants and pho here. So be prepared for one or the other being on every other street!\n\nWe are currently experiencing a rise in our homeless community. So there will often be encampments right next to stores or crosswalks and I would really like to see more individuals out on the streets from programs interacting and helping these individuals as i did for over 5 years as a social worker."
