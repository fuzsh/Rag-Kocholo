        "text": "Getting There\n\nThere are three possible approaches to the town site.\n\nTake SR165 from Buckley out past Carbonado: Cross the bridge back to the north side, and you can hop the rail on the east side of the bridge (the side against rock), and you will find a steep, but manageable trail down to the old track bed. Head east, away from Carbonado to get towards Melmont. There is a mud pit just after the dynamite shed as you enter White River SD property. It can be extremely bad most of the year. The best time to go through it is during high summer. The trail splits past the dynamite shed and you take the left trail to access the ghost town.\n\nThe second route is a mile back towards Carbonado. As you pass the main town street heading towards Rainier, you will see a series of three pullouts next to the highway, two are marked by white poles, the third with a gate. This is the western end of the abandoned rail line, and it is owned by Pierce County Parks. Park well off the freeway, and enjoy an easy stroll of about a mile towards the bridge, where you will meet up with the first access point. Continue on to Melmont.\n\nFrom the east: Drive down highway 165 until you come to a turnoff to the Manley-Moore road on the left. Continue down the winding road until you cross a low, one-lane bridge over the Carbon river. You will see a stub road in the left. Park here, out of the way of the gate and road. Walk down to the bridge, and pick up the trail heading down to the river and then to the east. This trail can be rough, and is subject to washouts. Proceed cautiously.\n\nPrint"
