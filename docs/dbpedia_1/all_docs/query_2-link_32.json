        "text": "BYU basketball received an important commitment from Arkansas transfer Jaxson Robinson on Thursday. Robinson, who has spent time at Arkansas and Texas A&M over the last two years, was a four-star recruit coming out of high school. Robinson comes to Provo with three years of eligibility remaining. Since this will be his second transfer, Robinson will have to apply for a waiver to be eligible next season.\n\nComing off a 2022 season in which BYU narrowly missed the NCAA Tournament, head coach Mark Pope and his staff have been working around the clock to improve the Cougars' roster for next season. In addition, BYU is preparing for the future when it enters the Big 12 in 2023. Today, we take an updated look at the 2022-2023 BYU men's basketball roster.\n\nBYU lost three seniors to graduation last year, and six players have entered the NCAA Transfer Portal since the end of last season.\n\nDeparting Players\n\nThese are the players that were on the roster last season, but will not be on the roster for the 2022-2023 season.\n\nAlex Barcello (Graduation)\n\nTe'Jon Lucas (Graduation)\n\nRichard Harward (Graduation)\n\nGavin Baxter (Transfer Portal)\n\nHunter Erickson (Transfer Portal)\n\nJeremy DowDell (Transfer Portal)\n\nNate Hansen (Transfer Portal)\n\nCaleb Lohner (Transfer Portal)\n\nSeneca Knight (Transfer Portal)\n\nPaora Winitana (Mission)\n\nBYU has experienced more roster turnover than normal this offseason. However, roster turnover is not uncommon in this era of college basketball. Thanks to the transfer portal and immediate eligibility for first-time transfers, most schools lose multiple players to the portal every year. BYU fans should expect multiple players to transfer after every season.\n\nReturning Players (Name, Position, Eligibility)\n\nTrey Stewart - Guard - SO\n\nAtiki Ally Atiki - Forward - SO\n\nSpencer Johnson - Guard - SR\n\nTrevin Knell - Guard - SR\n\nFousseyni Traore - Forward - SO\n\nGideon George - Forward - SR\n\nCasey Brown - Guard - SO\n\nBYU has a core of young forwards that it can build around as it prepares for the Big 12 in Fousseyni Traore and Atiki Ally Atiki. BYU only has one young scholarship guard returning next season in Trey Stewart. Stewart appeared in 11 games last season for the Cougars.\n\nFor those that watched BYU last season, one glaring weakness stands out from this group: shot creating. BYU has tried to address that need through the transfer portal.\n\n2022 Recruiting Class (Name, Position)\n\nBraeden Moore - Forward\n\nBYU added 6'8 forward Braeden Moore late in the recruiting cycle. Moore, who received over 30 competing offers, originally committed to Rutgers before backing off that commitment and opening up his recruitment.\n\nBYU signed Farmington guard Collin Chandler earlier this year. That was a major recruiting win for the program, but it won't help the Cougars next season. Chandler will serve a mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints prior to enrolling at BYU.\n\n2022 Transfers (Name, Position, Eligibility)\n\nRudi Williams - Guard - SO\n\nJaxson Robinson - Wing - SR\n\nAs long as Mark Pope is the head coach at BYU, the transfer portal will be an important part of the program. BYU's coaching staff has contacted dozens of players in the transfer portal over the last several months. Those recruiting efforts are starting to bare fruits. BYU has received commitments from Coastal Carolina point guard Rudi Williams and Arkansas wing Jaxson Robinson.\n\nBYU has one more scholarship available for next season.\n\n2022 Returned Missionaries (Name, Position, Eligibility)\n\nDallin Hall - Guard - FR\n\nRichie Saunders - Guard - FR\n\nTanner Toolson - Guard - FR\n\nCoach Pope's first recruiting class is finally returning home from the mission field. Dallin Hall, Richie Saunders, and Tanner Toolson committed to BYU over Power Six schools before serving their missions.\n\nTime will tell how prepared these three players will be to take on meaningful roles as freshman. In football, freshman returned missionaries are typically limited due to injury risk. In basketball, the returned missionaries have a few more months to prepare their bodies for the season.\n\nFollow us on social media for future coverage:\n\nFacebook - @BYUSportsIllustrated\n\nTwitter - @SI_BYU and Casey Lundquist at @casey_lundquist"
