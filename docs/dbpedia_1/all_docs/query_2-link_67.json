        "text": "So here we go again, it’s time to get back into the groove with my second year of EIT study. You may be wondering how great can 2018 be? I have news for you, it’s going to the year of great and amazing things. One great thing happening for me at least is the opportunity to continue studying for my Bachelor of Recreation and Sport. EIT offers the guidance and help which help me to be at my best on the basketball court and in the classroom. EIT also provides a unique learning environment. The smaller class sizes encourage friendships and the amazing staff and supporting cast give us the attention we need to thrive.\n\nAnother part of the year I am looking forward to, and so too should everyone else, is the upcoming Bay Hawks basketball season. Right now, we are in pre-season training. The local young talent is on full display and there’s the opportunity for these players to lead and also to learn from the new head coach, Zico Coronel. With the change in coach and the blend of new and familiar faces I pick up on a buzz around the community about what this team can and will accomplish. Zico is energising the team, which is elevating the quality of basketball here in Hawke’s Bay. So expect big things this year from your team.\n\nWith so many opportunities on the go for me this year, a key focus is time management. As well as studying at EIT and being involved with the Bay Hawks, I am also helping coach in the Paul Henare and Paora Winitana basketball academy and working as a librarian for the Hastings and Flaxmere libraries. Come to the library if you get the chance and explore the most amazing books and movies. And did I mention meeting the awesome staff?\n\nWith all these undertakings, it’s crucial that I manage my time so I can be the best version of myself no matter what I’m doing. I also feel it’s important that others focus on time management, whether that’s putting time aside to spend with family or pursuing a hobby like reading a book borrowed from the local library. I have been planning my year like a jigsaw puzzle to fit it all the demands on my time.\n\n2018 is going to be a year for creating memories. I hope you continue following my story to see how my study and other commitments are going. And get yourselves ready for the NBL season because the Bay Hawks can’t wait to put on a show. Mark the home games on your calendar and get yourself along to see us play.\n\nMy next blog is coming soon. Stay tuned…."
