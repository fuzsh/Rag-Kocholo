As last year the New Zealand Premier team will be selected from players playing in the Women’s Basketball Championship (WBC).\n\nThe fixtures will provide an opportunity for a number of WBC veteran players to appear on the international stage and also showcase young up and coming New Zealand talent.\n\nNZIBT Sports Tour Director Ashley Gayle is thrilled at the prospect of hosting another high quality American college women’s team.\n\n“We are extremely excited for the opportunity to bring Hawaii University women’s basketball team to New Zealand. We encourage you to support the Kiwi players and watch two great games. More details on the dates and times of games will be available in the near future.\n\nFollow NZIBT here"
