You know, it was the right thing to do for someone who has been so important for basketball in Hawke's Bay,\" he says before reflecting on himself.\n\n\"It's always good to get recognition but it's not going to be a deal breaker in terms of, you know, when you look back at your time with the club or anything like that.\n\n\"It's one of those things that happen and if they don't that's okay as well,\" says Henare."
