As a keystone of local self-government, argument must be considered from an agency perspective. Because rhetoric—the art and finesse of argument—is a powerful tool for influencing agency, it must be wielded responsibly and kept in check. Students in this course will develop a sensitivity as readers and writers to the dynamic interactions among the purposes of a writer, the needs of his or her audience, and the demands of a message. Furthermore, students must learn not only to argue from true premises founded in revealed doctrinal truths but also to humbly recognize the limits of their own understanding of truth and the value of perspectives different from their own. Students who want to be powerful communicators must understand how to appeal appropriately and effectively to those they would persuade, invite, and influence for good. Ultimately this course will help students practice participating as humble and courageous Christians in the American argument.\n\nTo this end, students in this course will study a broad and challenging selection of both fiction and literary nonfiction texts. They will analyze both the textual elements and the contextual situation of the readings, examining how authors develop a relationship of trust with their readers, use evidence-based appeals to reason, and craft language to draw upon their reader’s emotions and previous knowledge. To help students understand that authors write in context as part of a larger dialogue, the course readings have been organized in six thematic units: Argument and Democracy, American Land, American Faith and Fear, Liberty and Justice for All, I Pledge Allegiance, Shakespearean Argument.\n\nThrough the course of these units, students will engage in close readings of texts—both prose and imaginative literature—to examine not only the messages being conveyed but also the rhetorical choices that contribute to the effectiveness of the communications. Through textual annotation, vocabulary development, daily writing, and critical discussion, students will become attuned to the resources of language: diction, syntax, imagery, tone, organization, form, etc.\n\nKey Texts\n\nHawthorne, Nathaniel, The Scarlet Letter (ISBN: 978-0-486-28408-6)\n\nShakespeare, William, Julius Caeser (ISBN: 978-1-4391-9671-7)\n\nLee, Harper, To Kill a Mockingbird (ISBN: 978-0-446-31078-9)\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nStudents will practice evidence-based literary interpretation to explore the central themes and messages of great works of world English literature and to identify true principles which are personally significant to individual students. Students will use literature as a mirror for personal reflection and as a portal into empathic understanding of the worldviews and experiences of others. If, through their study of history students gain a knowledge of how to build the Kingdom of God, then through their study of literature students will develop the heart necessary to do so. In advising a troop of actors, Hamlet states that the purpose of acting is “to hold, as ’twere, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure.” This argument can be generalized to literature, for great literature enables readers to see themselves more clearly. It allows them to polish the “dark glass” of self-deception which distorts their ability to engage in true and joyful relationships. Indeed, literature is liberating, but not, perhaps, in the sense in which that word is invoked in our modern world. Literature does not liberate us in the sense of opening our eyes to relativistic definitions of truth, morality, and beauty; rather, it brings into focus the bondage we must escape as well as the bonds we must take up order to enjoy true liberty. Through various works of literature this year, learners will learn to recognize the bondage in which we, often unwittingly, find ourselves entangled, and the bonds to which we can willingly submit which will enable us to give and receive love. To this end, students will develop careful analytic skills in both reading and writing about literature.\n\nKey Texts:\n\nShakespeare, William, Hamlet. (ISBN: 978-0-7434-7712-3)\n\nHugo, Victor, Les Miserables. (ISBN: 978-1-4165-0026-1)\n\nAusten, Jane, Pride and Prejudice (ISBN: 978-0-451-53078-3)\n\nLewis, C.S., Screwtape Letters. (ISBN: 978-0-06-065293-7)\n\nMaxwell, Neal A., The Enoch Letters\n\nvarious poems\n\nshort stories and an independent novel approved by the instructor.\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nJoin us as we delve into the histories of various nations and events in order to understand their complexities and principles. We will also see how the hand of God has shaped human history. We will cover the time periods of the 16th century to the present day. Some pivotal times we will look closely at are the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Glorious Revolution, the French revolution, the Industrial Revolution, the founding of America, New Imperialism, World War I, World War II and the Cold War. The objectives for this course include studying World History in a manner that will help us comprehend the ideas and events that took place. By doing this we will be enriched by the principles we learn and how those principles influenced the outcomes of certain events. We will be spiritually uplifted to see the consequences of choices, and how the hand of God worked through so many people’s lives in order for the restoration of the gospel to come forth. Students will consider the current state of the world and kingdom of God by asking which current events are of global significance. They will ask questions about how the world got where it is and will seek answers to shared whole-class questions and individual questions as they delve chronologically backwards into world history. Throughout this process, they will ask what their growing understanding of the web of historical causation requires of them as individual students, American citizens, and Christians. In History, students will consider the events which laid the foundation for the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the subsequent unfolding of the dispensation of the fullness of times. Historical developments from 1500 to 1800—the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the Glorious Revolution, and the American Founding—demonstrate how the Lord prepared the peoples and nations of the earth for the Restoration. Subsequent events from 1800 to the present show how restored priesthood keys set the stage for the great latter-day work of gathering Israel and building the kingdom of God on earth in preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. Through their study of the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, New Imperialism, the World Wars, and the Cold War, students will consider how historical developments during the past two centuries have furthered the work of the Lord in 1) spreading political, economic, and social liberty; 2) preaching the gospel to all peoples; 3) gathering Zion through temples; 4) strengthening families; and 5) restoring truth in all realms of labor, inquiry, and expression. Students will simultaneously note how the Adversary attempts to 1) limit political liberty, create economic bondage, and pervert social liberty; 2) hinder missionary work; 3) impede temple work; 4) destroy families; and 5) eliminate the very concept of Truth. This historical perspective will help learners understand how to use their liberty to be useful in the Lord’s hands in building the Kingdom of God on the earth.\n\nInstructor\n\nCourse Description\n\nStudent learning from history and literature will culminate in Written Portfolio. They will come to experience writing as a relational activity: not one done in isolation, but a process which can be used to build the kinds of relationships they care about—with their friends, with their family, with future employers and college admissions, and even with their Father in Heaven. Students will explore key thematic questions such as:\n\nHow can I as a writer argue more truthfully while respecting the agency of readers?\n\nHow can I be persuasive but not manipulative?\n\nHow can I balance humility and confidence in my approach to written argumentation?\n\nThe best writing is ultimately an act of heart, an act of giving. Students will develop both the skills and the dispositions necessary to think well and to serve others through the power of the written word. They will focus on the value of writing in various forms and the critical thinking it takes to analyze authors intent, purpose, audience, tone, etc. and to use those same skills in both academic and creative writing. Students will also practice writing in a variety of genres and for a variety of purposes and readers—emails, argumentative essays, literary analysis essays, poetry, short stories, research papers, résumés, summaries, tributes, etc. They will experience writing as a process of revision and empathic anticipation, and they will become more sensitive to the elements of language which enhance communication—voice, word choice, sentence structure, organization, and conventions. Class will be organized principally as a writers’ workshop. Improvement in writing abilities is the product of multiple cycles of drafting, feedback, and revision. The teacher will use the tutorial approach to individualize writing feedback. Occasionally the teacher will share “mini-lessons” to provide class-wide instruction. To succeed in this class, students should actively seek and use feedback from a variety of sources including the teacher, peers, family members, and other trusted adults. The objective of this class is to increase in our talents God has given us through thinking and writing. We will become better instruments in his hands to better the world and help our fellow man. We will achieve this by obtaining greater level of writing ability through the study and practice of writing skills.\n\nInstructors\n\nCourse Description\n\nStudents will learn how to write compositions, reports, and poetry.

The basic materials that will be used are folk songs and the games that go with them and that are in their vocal and maturity range, nursery rhymes and rhymes, use of some instruments and listening examples from great composers. The main focus will be to provide musical growth in five areas: 1) Singing ability, 2) rhythm, 3) aural perception, 4) creativity and 5) spiritual development.\n\nCourse Objectives\n\nThe children will work on in-tune singing skills. If they do not already match pitch we will work on this. They will be able to use and find their upper voices by doing activities and games that allow them to move their voices such as rhymes that use upper and lower voices, elevators, etc. Use of animal puppets and objects will also be used. The children will be able to match pitch when the teacher sings a question to them, of course this is a continual process if they cannot already do this. The children will be able to hear simple rhythmic phrases and repeat them back as a class and individually. As we sing our songs the children will follow the teacher as she puts the beat on her lap, the children will copy not knowing the term until the teacher makes it conscious to them at the end of the year. At the end of the year the heart beat is “made conscious”- which is what they have been doing all year but a name is given to what they already can do. The children will be able to hear the difference between high and low, slow and fast, etc. The children when we are listening to composer selections will be able to move to the music as it makes them feel. With some of our folk songs they will be able to make up new verses to go with them. Before each class period a child is chosen to say the prayer and we repeat a scripture that has to do with music. We memorize it and change to a new one almost every month. In the fall we start working on Christmas songs for our Kindergarten devotional that we do in December. Each song brings to us a remembrance of our Savior and his birth. We learn that music is a gift from God, our singing voices are gifts from God, when we sing and play our games together we bring joy to Heavenly Father, ourselves, and others. When we work together we are happier. We raise our hands and wait to be called on when we want to talk.\n\nInstructors\n\nCourse Description\n\nIn this course students will learn to create artwork with their own hands and know that they are part of the Divine Design.
