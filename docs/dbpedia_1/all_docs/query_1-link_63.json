        "text": "Can you please help?\n\nIntroducing, Daniel Christensen a fine young Hawkes Bay man who lives and breathes basketball. He has a dream to play in the NBA and play in the NZ Tall Blacks and he is prepared to do whatever it takes!\n\nHe has recently been selected in the Hawkes Bay U17 Basketball Team and the Paul Henare and Paora Winitana Basketball Acadamy. As a part of the Academy they will be traveling to the USA later on in the year.\n\nAs you know success does come at a price. For Daniel this cost has been plenty of early morning trainings sessions, extra fitness sessions, leadership sessions, hundreds of hours practicing basketball skills, as well as keeping high standard in school work as well as working part time jobs to help contribute towards training gear etc. By the end of this year he has to find $5750 to cover this year’s expense which covers training fees, tournament fees and trip to the USA, this is not including his sports gear such as training gear and extras.\n\nHi this is Daniel…\n\nBeing part of the Acadamy I had the privilege of being selected to go to the USA. What do I want to get out of this trip? Well by doing this I will be exposed and coached by some of the best basketball players in this field. It will give me the opportunity to experience what it really takes to play at their level and to then find out what I will need to work on to achieve these goals. After high school I won’t to then go on to Play College ball and in time to represent my country and then the big dream to make NBA!"
