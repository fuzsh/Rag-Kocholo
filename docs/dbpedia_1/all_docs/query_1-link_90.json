        "text": "The Adelaide 36ers snapped their five-game losing streak with an 87-70 NBL win over the New Zealand Breakers at the Distinctive Homes Dome.\n\nIn a match dominated by defence, the 36ers held their nerve in the final term to ease the pressure on coach Phil Smyth in his 700th NBL game as a player and coach.\n\nAdam Ballinger top scored for the homeside with a 26-point haul while Brett Maher (19) and Brad Davidson (14) also contributed to the vital win.\n\nPhill Jones sank 14 for the Breakers with Tony Ronaldson chipping in with 12, and Paora Winitana looked good early to shoot 9.\n\nIn a fiery opening period the lead changed several times with the 36ers holding on for a 26-23 advantage at the break.\n\nThe physical contest continued early in the second term with neither side establishing a clear offensive edge, but in the dying minutes Maher and Ballinger produced some clinical finishing to give the 36ers a 46-39 lead at halftime.\n\nLate in the third quarter Ballinger sank a brace of baskets to put the 36ers 12 points up, before Jones and Ronaldson hit back for the Breakers to take a 66-59 scoreline into the final term.\n\nThe Breakers refused to go away quietly in the final term and it was only when Ng shot a three pointer with three minutes to play that the 36ers finally looked like winners."
