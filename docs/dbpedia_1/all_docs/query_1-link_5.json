        "text": "I am of New Zealand Maori heritage, I love my family, I love my faith, I love my culture and I love the game of basketball.\n\nMy dad played professional basketball for 20 years in New Zealand and Australia so I literally grew up around the game. I was always that kid hanging around the gym, early in the mornings with trainings, or late at nights after games. I spent a lot of time with my dads teams and team mates trying to take them on in a 1v1 or a shooting competition, joining them in video meetings, reading the scouting reports and box scores, or going to team dinners and functions. As a result of my upbringing, I see the game different to most, some call me a Basketball geek, I believe I'm a true student of the game.\n\nI have played point guard my whole life, then recently had a growth spurt of 6 inches in a 18 month period, so now I'm one of the biggest on court with my height and strength, but I pride myself on my IQ, my understanding the game, seeing the floor, executing systems, X's and O's, and playing the right way.\n\nI try to pattern my game after Luka Doncic, the ability to use my size when it comes to seeing over defences and making the correct pass, or rebounding over tall skinny bigs or smaller guards.\n\nI consider my self a past first guard, I love finding the right shot, using the strengths of my team mates and getting the best, highest percentage shot we can.\n\nBut I can score too, inside and out. Once again with my size and strength I can take bigs off the dribble and post up smaller guards. Growing up playing FIBA basketball, the USA high school 3 point line is very close compared to what I'm use to.\n\nOnce again, I consider myself a true student of the game, I am always trying to learn, improve and get better. I'm excited and love the opportunity to learn and improve my game so I can play at the highest level possible."
