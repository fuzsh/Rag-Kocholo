        "text": "Tenei au ..... Why, why, why has it taken me soo long to own this moment? 2 months have flown by and I find myself buried under the multitudes of washing that is my Mum life .... queu Gotye (sing it with me) \"Now you're just somebody that I used to know\" Before I begin to wonder how long I've been washing these same towels I hear the words Hancine shared on stage at grad accepting the Ako award for the 2nd time - You're two from two. That's right I haven't even told anyone that yet and as we sail into the Māori new year I reflect, what else did I do - well I kind of finished my Undergrad and Masters at the same time. So like the boss that I remember I am, I tell the kids to fold and put away their own washing!\n\nLife & times with moko kauae .... It's only been 3 months since my Mum, sister & I received our moko kauae together back home in Turangi. A decision made within the close bonds of our family I was a bit freaked out when I saw my pic in the Herald. This precious & vulnerable moment where in karanga I call out to the kura to give my love, thanks, & appreciation. Admittedly at first I was - as we'd say back in the 90's totally shamed out - which is why I haven't shared it until today. While running errands I was greeted in Māori by a young checkout operator. In reply I asked how she was & she spoke about losing a young relative and the tangi she'd just returned home from. I listened intently, offered words of support, and the conversation gently moved to Matariki. And so, yes there was a time where malicious comments about kauae would've hurt me. But in all my apprehension I never thought it would signal belonging and an invitation to share in safe spaces with me. https://lnkd.in/d38byb_z"
