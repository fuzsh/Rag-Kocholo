Purpose\n\nThe purpose of this report is to update Council on meetings and engagements, outside of Council, Committee and Sub-Committee meetings, I have attended and participated in as Chairperson. Also, to highlight key matters that will be of interest to Councillors.\n\nThe following section summarises these meetings and engagements. I will provide further detail at the meeting in response to any questions you may have.\n\n2. Meetings and Engagements\n\nPublic Transport Services and Infrastructure Business Case - Delegated Authority Update\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Regional Council:\n\n1 Receives the report.\n\n2 Delegates authority to the Chief Executive to accept tenders, and approve contracts, supplier selections and make payments, including contract variations and renewals, for the Western Bay Public Transport Services & Infrastructure Single Stage Business Case.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Western Bay Public Transport Services & Infrastructure Single Stage Business Case is identified as the number one priority project in the 2021-24 Regional Land Transport Plan (RLTP). Funding has been approved by Waka Kotahi NZ Transport Agency and the next stage is to procure professional services to develop the business case.\n\nA Procurement Plan was approved at meeting of the Regional Council on 17 February 2022.\n\nWhilst some authority was delegated to the Chief Executive as part of the resolution granted on 17 February 2022, it has since transpired that the delegation requested by staff was too narrow. Staff are therefore seeking to correct this oversight, by asking members to approve a clearer delegation.\n\nThis has not impacted project timescales. The project team have executed the Procurement Plan, releasing a Request for Proposals to the market. The deadline for tender submissions was 8 September 2022 and the evaluation process is ongoing.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nThe Regional Council’s Procurement Guide has been followed to help guide the approach to procurement and the Project Team have worked closely with the Procurement Team.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\nIn addition to the Regional Council’s Strategic Framework, the Western Bay Public Transport Services & Infrastructure Single Stage Business Case is identified in both the Urban Form and Transport initiative (UFTI) and the Western Bay Transport System Plan (TSP) as a key next step in helping deliver the “Connected Centres” programme.\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\nþ Environmental\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nþ Cultural\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nþ Social\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nþ Economic\n\nMedium - Positive\n\n· Environmental – reducing transport emissions, including greenhouse gases (carbon).\n\n· Cultural – providing transport choices for Māori communities to access essential services, education and employment; and involving Māori in decision-making\n\n· Social – providing sustainable transport choices and opportunities for the community (this is the main contribution to community well-being). Social benefit is the key wellbeing relevant to many public transport decisions, particularly fares and service routes and frequencies.\n\n· Economic – improvements to economic productivity through the reduction of traffic congestion (where sufficient people change from single-occupancy cars to public transport). This is more applicable in dense urban areas.\n\n2. Background\n\n2.1 What the Business Case is going to address\n\nThe Western Bay of Plenty sub-region is experiencing significant population growth and this is expected to continue over the next 50+ years. With this growth comes additional transport problems such as increased congestion and journey times, if people continue to choose the use of private vehicles and the associated increased transport emissions (both local and global). The provision of a high-quality public transport system that allows people to travel when they want, to where they want, will be a game changer in the way people live. The Western Bay Public Transport Services & Infrastructure Single Stage Business will investigate how the current public transport system can be improved, and identify the infrastructure needed to support mode shift.\n\n2.1.1 Outcomes Sought\n\nThe business case will investigate and prioritise investment opportunities to increase the use of public transport by improving the attractiveness of bus services. This will be by considering changes to both the public transport services as well as the supporting infrastructure. The business case has a 10-year horizon and a 30-year outlook. Whilst it will consider trigger points for more invasive measures, such as rapid transit / rail, the predominant focus will be on the delivery of bus-based solutions. Getting more people using public transport will lead to:\n\n· Increased travel choice and improved accessibility for all;\n\n· Faster, more frequent and reliable services;\n\n· Increased bus patronage;\n\n· Less reliance on car ownership;\n\n· Reduced carbon emissions from transport;\n\n· Supporting healthier built environment;\n\n· Reduced community harm from transport;\n\n· Supporting sustainable urban form and general intensification;\n\n· Supporting regional economy / productivity through improved efficiency of the transport network; and\n\n· Value for money /fare box recovery.\n\nThis business case will help deliver one of the five regional objectives as detailed in the 2021-24 RLTP – improving multi-modal access and choice with a key goal of increasing mode share for public transport and active modes within urban areas and communities to 20% by 2030.\n\n2.1.2 Technical Work Progressed to Date\n\nWork has now concluded on the production of a “Public Transport Reference Case”. This aspect of the business case was expediated to provide consistent and accurate public transport assumptions to the various other transport projects ongoing around Tauranga and the Western Bay, being delivered by our partners.\n\nThe work to produce the Reference Case considered several network structures, which were presented and scored at a stakeholder workshop. This identified the potential benefit of developing a “hybrid” network structure, utilising both “through routing” and “hub and spoke”. Customer focus was at the heart of the Reference Case development. Further detail around the Reference Case will be developed as part of the Single Stage Business Case.\n\nThe Reference Case aligns with both the Regional Land Transport Plan (RLTP), the recently adopted Regional Public Transport Plan (RPTP) and has the capacity to support the emerging Vehicle Kilometres Travelled (VKT) / Emissions Reduction Plan (ERP) targets.\n\nMembers of the Tauranga Joint Public Transport Committee were briefed on the progress of this work on 22 August 2022.\n\n3. Procurement Approach\n\nThe budget for the development of the business case is $900,000. The complexity (scale as well as consideration of both services and infrastructure), and high value, means that the classification is confirmed as Procurement Type C. The Procurement Plan developed was therefore:\n\n· Single stage;\n\n· Standard Request for Tender/Request for Proposal; and\n\n· Open competition.\n\nBoth Tauranga City Council and Waka Kotahi, as co-funders of the business case, were engaged with and their feedback incorporated into the Procurement Plan and its subsequent execution.\n\n3.1 Scope of Work\n\nThe scope of the services required is the delivery of a Single Stage Business Case, in line with Waka Kotahi’s business case approach, that will:\n\n· Confirm the public transport operating service model and network to achieve UFTI and TSP model split targets;\n\n· Use robust data to propose evidence-based investment priorities;\n\n· Confirm infrastructure improvements needed to support the new public transport services in achieving these targets; and\n\n· Include engagement with the community particularly around possible changes to the service network.\n\nThere is also a desire for greater involvement by the project team throughout the development of the business case e.g. co-authoring parts of the business case where the data / evidence / expertise is held in-house. This will lead to a higher quality end product and also greater ownership of the design and implementation stages that will follow in due course.\n\n3.2 Key Requirements\n\nThere are some key requirements that have been identified by the Project Team in relation to the professional services supplier including having:\n\n· A strong record of delivering public transport projects. This is not a roading or general transport planning project;\n\n· Experience of developing complex system-level business cases that meet Waka Kotahi’s requirements;\n\n· The ability to collaborate with a broad range of stakeholders; and\n\n· A strong approach to communications and engagement.\n\n4. Considerations\n\n4.1 Risks and Mitigations\n\nThe most significant risk related to the procurement process, which in turn could impact on the overall quality of the business case and outcomes from the project, relate to the timing / project programme.\n\nThe consultancy market has been described as “red hot”, especially for public transport specialists. There has been interest in this opportunity from several suppliers, and we have asked for respondents to explain how work could be delivered innovatively and efficiently to accelerate the production of key deliverables\n\nOther risks were identified in the Procurement Plan approved by the Regional Council on 17 February 2022.\n\n4.2 Climate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are not sensitive to the effects of climate change. Staff have also considered the effect of the initiative on greenhouse gas emissions and recommend that there will be no effect.\n\n4.3 Implications for Māori\n\nThe procurement process has no significant implication for Maori. However, the outcomes of the business case could be significant, and the Project Team has commenced discussions with the TSP Iwi Advisor (who sits on the project steering group) with a view to liaising with the TSP Tangata Whenua Group. Updates have also been provided to Te Rangapū.\n\n4.4 Community Engagement\n\nSurveys of bus users and non-bus users provide detailed information on what can be done to improve the public transport experience. There is also significant work that needs to be done to change the negative perception of public transport. Our experience of the recent Network Refresh, as well as learnings from other public transport improvement projects in New Zealand, confirm the need for genuine engagement through the development of the business case. The need for this was identified in the Procurement Plan approved by the Regional Council on 17 February 2022.\n\n4.5 Financial Implications\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications and this fits within the allocated budget.\n\nThe total project budget is $1.2M of which $900,000 has been allocated to the development of the business case itself. $200,000 has been allocated for an update to the public transport module of the Strategic Transport Model and for specific project related communications and engagement resource. $100,000 has been spent on the production of a Public Transport Reference Case.\n\nOf the $1.2M total, $350,000 is Regional Council’s contribution as per the Long Term Plan. The remaining contributions are $350,000 from Tauranga City Council and $500,000 from Waka Kotahi. Western Bay of Plenty District Council is a non-funding partner. A Funding Agreement has been entered into by the three funding partners.\n\n5. Next Steps\n\nThe granting of this delegation will enable staff to contract with a preferred supplier to progress the production of a Single Stage Business Case.\n\nIt is anticipated that this business case will take approximately 12 months to complete. Findings from this process will be used to inform the next Long Term Plan process next year.\n\nQuayside Group and Toi Moana Trust Annual Reports for the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Regional Council:\n\n1 Receives the report, Quayside Group and Toi Moana Trust Annual Reports for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\n2 Approves the aggregate remuneration pool for Quayside Holdings Limited’s directors for 2022/23 at $475,000 (plus GST if any), being an increase from $380,209 based on six paid directors, including remuneration paid by Quayside Holdings Limited’s subsidiaries – Quayside Securities Limited and Quayside Properties Limited;\n\n3 Approves increasing Quayside Holdings Limited’s Directors’ Fees for 2022/23, including remuneration paid by Quayside Holdings Limited’s subsidiaries – Quayside Securities Limited and Quayside Properties Limited, to:\n\n(a) Chair $130,000\n\n(b) Chair of Audit Committee $75,000\n\n(c) Chair of People, Culture and Safety Committee $75,000\n\n(d) Three Directors at $65,000 per Director\n\n(e) Council Chief Executive $0\n\n4 Approves the aggregate remuneration pool for Quayside Holdings Limited’s directors for 2023/24 at $510,000 (plus GST if any), being an increase from $475,000 based on six paid directors, including remuneration paid by Quayside Holdings Limited’s subsidiaries – Quayside Securities Limited and Quayside Properties Limited;\n\n5 Approves increasing Quayside Holdings Limited’s Directors’ Fees for 2023/24, including remuneration paid by Quayside Holdings Limited’s subsidiaries – Quayside Securities Limited and Quayside Properties Limited, to:\n\n(a) Chair $140,000\n\n(b) Chair of Audit Committee $80,000\n\n(c) Chair of People, Culture and Safety Committee $80,000\n\n(d) Three Directors at $70,000 per Director\n\n(e) Council Chief Executive $0\n\n6 Reappoint the Office of the Auditor-General, as the Auditors of the Company, and authorise the Directors of Quayside Holdings Limited to negotiate with the Office of the Auditor‐General pursuant to the Public Audit Act 2001 to set the Auditor’s remuneration for the ensuing year.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Bay of Plenty Regional Council has received the Annual Reports and an assessment of performance targets against the Statement of Intent for Quayside group, and the Toi Moana Trust. These annual reports accompany this report, as Supporting Documents, and key highlights are discussed in section 2.\n\nAt the time this paper was written, the Annual Reports for the Quayside Group and Toi Moana Trust had been audited but not yet approved by the Board. Council is not required to approve the Quayside Annual Report and staff will report any material changes to a future Council meeting if necessary.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nQuayside is required to provide annual reporting information to shareholders within three months of the end of the financial year as set out in the Local Government Act 2002. The statutory time limit has been extended from 30 September to 30 November for the 2021/22 financial year. There is no requirement for Council to approve these annual reports.\n\nEach annual report must include:\n\n· A comparison of the performance of the organisation and its subsidiaries with the Statement of Intent;\n\n· An explanation of any material variances;\n\n· The dividend to be paid;\n\n· Audited consolidated financial statements;\n\n· Auditors report on those financial statements.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\nThe annual reports for the year ended 30 June 2022 provide information on the financial and non-financial performance of Quayside and its subsidiaries. Quayside provides specialist financial services and advice to improve the long-term value received from Council’s investments. The dividend received from Quayside and the Toi Moana Trust is used to reduce general rates to improve rates affordability for the community.\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\nþ Environmental\n\nþ Cultural\n\nþ Social\n\nþ Economic\n\nThe dividend from Quayside Holdings Limited is applied to general funded Council activities to reduce the general rates requirement, which supports the delivery of all four Community Outcomes and the Way We Work.\n\n2. Quayside Group and Toi Moana Trust Annual Reports for the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nDraft Annual reports for the Quayside Group and the Toi Moana Trust have been audited and, as at 19 September 2022, are in the Board approval process. The financials and performance measures are audited final figures; however, text and graphics may be updated. Staff will advise at a future Council Meeting if there are any material changes from draft to final versions of the annual reports.\n\n2.1 Quayside Holdings Limited Annual Report\n\nThe draft Annual Report for Quayside for the year ended 30 June 2022 is included as attachment 1.\n\nQuayside delivered the budgeted dividends in full to the Council and Perpetual Preference Shareholders. Quayside achieved a net profit after tax of $125.9 million and achieved all 10 of its performance targets.\n\nQuayside’s financial summary includes:\n\n· Total assets $3.2 billion ($2.5 billion 2021) comprised of $2.7 billion for the Port of Tauranga and $479.2 million non-port investments. The main driver of the increased value is a non-cash gain of $537 million from revaluation of freehold land.\n\n· Net assets of $2.5 billion ($1.8 billion 2021).\n\n· Net profit $125.9 million ($154.1 million 2021) comprised of $111.3 million for the Port of Tauranga and $14.6 million non-port investments.\n\n· 8.7% increase in Port of Tauranga Group net profit.\n\n· 10.7% internal rate of return for non-port assets for the last five years.\n\nQuayside’s performance highlights include:\n\n· Port of Tauranga has recorded a decrease of 2.1% in total greenhouse gas emissions for the year.\n\n· Rangiuru stage 1A earthworks commenced and titles on schedule for issue in 2024. This stage is focussed on key infrastructure requirements such as stormwater, wastewater, internal roading and the interchange connection with the Tauranga Eastern Link.\n\n· Huakiwi has concluded its kiwifruit planting programme with a total of 68 canopy hectares.\n\n· Aqua Curo bioremediation trial has prevented over 100 kilograms of nitrogen from entering our fresh waterways.\n\nThe Annual Reports for the subsidiaries of Quayside are included as supporting documents.\n\n2.2 Director Fees 2022/23\n\nQuayside have completed benchmarking of Director fees. This process included advice from Strategic Pay, review by Quayside’s People, Culture and Safety Committee and approval from the Quayside Board to recommend an increase in Director fees to Council.\n\nThe Chief Executive of Quayside has written to Council recommending that the aggregate remuneration pool for Quayside’s Directors is increased to $475,000 (plus GST if any) from $380,209 as outlined in attachment 2. The recommendation from Quayside proposes a further increase to $510,000 in 2023/2024. These figures include remuneration paid directly by Quayside and its subsidiaries Quayside Securities Limited and Quayside Properties Limited Council’s Chief Executive is a director of Quayside but is not remunerated by Quayside for this role. The proposed remuneration for each position (and 2021/22 remuneration) on the Board is shown in the table below.:\n\n·\n\nThe Quayside Chief Executive advises they have taken external and reputable market advice on Director remuneration to ensure it is fair, reasonable and set at conservative levels while still taking into consideration the complexity of the business and the need to attract quality directors to the Quayside Board. While this is a large percentage increase, Quayside advises that this is because the base annual director fees have not increased since 2007 and the size, complexity and value of Quayside has increased substantially since then.\n\nCouncillors are requested to consider the request to increase director remuneration for 2022/23 and 2023/24.\n\n2.3 Toi Moana Trust Annual Report\n\nThe Draft Annual Report for the Toi Moana Trust for the year ended 30 June 2022 is included as attachment 3.\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust paid the budgeted dividend of $4.5 million in full. This included the normal dividend of $2.25 million and a catch-up dividend of $2.25 million from prior years.\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust achieved 4 of its 5 performance targets.\n\nThe missed target is the result of fluctuations in the market value of investments with a decline in value at the valuation date. These investments are designed to be held for five years or more and provide a return and capital preservation over that timeframe. The value of the Toi Moana Trust is subject to fluctuation and the value of the investment needs to be viewed over the long-term.\n\n3. Considerations\n\n3.1 Risks and Mitigations\n\nThere are no direct risk implications arising as a result of this report.\n\n3.2 Climate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and there is no need to consider climate change impacts. Quayside’s investments include consideration of socially responsible investment principles.\n\n3.3 Implications for Māori\n\nQuayside holds some investments in partnership with Māori including Huakiwi which is a joint venture with Te Tumu Paeroa and is focused on whenua Māori and long-term employment for the community.\n\n3.4 Community Engagement\n\nThe Annual Reports will be published on Council’s and Quayside’s websites.\n\n3.5 Financial Implications\n\nIf the recommendation is adopted by Council, will it result in:\n\n- Unbudgeted work during the current financial year?\n\n- Unbudgeted work for any of the years remaining in the current Long Term Plan?\n\nIf the answer is ‘no’ to both questions please select the dropdown option 1 and complete appropriately.\n\nIf the answer is ‘yes’ to either question please select “Budget Implications” in the building block below and liaise with your Management Accountant in order to complete the Financial Impact table.\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications and this fits within the allocated budget. Quayside and the Toi Moana Trust delivered the budgeted dividends to Council in full.\n\n4. Next Steps\n\nNext Steps: What next? What resources are needed? Further analysis? Timeframes ahead.

Introduction\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust is a Council Controlled Organisation (CCO).\n\nSchedule 8 of the Local Government Act (2002) requires Council Controlled Organisations to deliver to shareholders their completed Statements of Intent (SOI) before the financial year to which it relates.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nThe requirements and process for completing the SOI is set in the LGA sections 64, 64A, 64B and schedule 8.\n\nCouncil may, by resolution, require the CCO Board to make changes to the SOI. Before making such a resolution Council must consult with the CCO Board. Staff do not propose that Council should require any changes to the SOI.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust manages investments for Council to achieve a return on invested funds to reduce the general rates requirement. The funds in the Toi Moana Trust are sourced from Council’s cash reserves that are forecast to be invested for a term of five years or more.\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\n¨ Environmental\n\n¨ Cultural\n\n¨ Social\n\nþ Economic\n\nLow - Positive\n\n2. Toi Moana Trust Statement of Intent\n\nThis report intends to complete the Council process for the Toi Moana Trust SOI. To date, this has included:\n\n· Council’s statement of expectations\n\n· Council consideration of the draft SOI\n\n· The Quayside Board considering Council’s feedback on the draft SOI\n\n· Staff review of changes between the draft and final Statement of Intent and checking that Council’s feedback on the draft has been incorporated.\n\nThe major changes to note in the final Statement of Intent are that:\n\n· Extra investment of $25 million has been included as per Council’s feedback. The dividend payment has increased by $1.25 million, i.e. 5% return. This additional investment was deposited on 1 July 2022.\n\n· The market value of the initial investment reduced from $45 million to $43.7 million. The Statement of Intent must be approved before 1 July 2022 and, therefore, used the valuation as at 31 May 2022 as the most recent valuation available.\n\nThis reduced value is shown for the next three years in the Statement of Intent. Since then, the market valuation of the Toi Moana Trust declined further to $43.1 million as at 30 June 2022 which is the value in the Annual Report (see separate paper).\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust is primarily invested in New Zealand and Australian shares. The overall returns on these markets from 30 June 2022 to 14 September 2022 has been 7.2% for the NZX50 and 3.9% for the ASX200. Staff consider that this is a short-term fluctuation, and that market returns have been favourable for recovery of the market value.\n\n· The capital preservation target has changed from being assessed on an initial seven-year term to a rolling five-year basis. Staff consider this is an appropriate change to incorporate the additional investment and that the reduced timeframe for capital preservation is favourable i.e. a shorter timeframe indicated less volatility and more certainty.\n\n3. Considerations\n\n3.1 Risks and Mitigations\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust is one component of Council’s overall investments managed by Quayside. Quayside manages a diversified portfolio of investments to mitigate individual investment risks. Council and Quayside staff meet regularly to discuss treasury operations and risk management.\n\n3.2 Climate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and there is no need to consider climate change impacts.\n\n3.3 Implications for Māori\n\nThe implications for Māori are directly related to rates required and are of a financial nature only.\n\n3.4 Community Engagement\n\n3.5 Financial Implications\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust SOI shows a reduced market value of the initial investment which reflects market volatility at the valuation date.\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust is primarily invested in New Zealand and Australian shares. The overall returns on these markets from 30 June 2022 to 14 September 2022 has been 7.2% for the NZX50 and 3.9% for the ASX200.\n\n4. Next Steps\n\nThe Toi Moana Trust Statement of Intent will be published on Council’s webpage. Councillors will be requested to consider a Statement of Expectations for the Quayside Group and the Toi Moana Trust as part of preparing Annual Plan 2023/24.\n\nAttachments\n\nAttachment 1 - Toi Moana Trust Statement of Intent 2022/23 ⇩\n\nRegional Council29 September 2022\n\nCommunity Participation Annual Report\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Regional Council:\n\n1 Receives the report, Community Participation Annual Report.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCommunity Participation is a strategic priority and one of the three Impact Areas for the Bay of Plenty Regional Council. Council’s vision is more action through greater community involvement, awareness and leadership. This is being delivered through a cross organisational network with four workstreams: Community Engagement, Volunteering, Funding Community Led Projects and Democracy.\n\nCouncil adopted the Community Participation Action Plan in December 2021 as an internal roadmap. Specific workstream papers presented this year include:\n\n· Youth Engagement Plan 2022 to Toi Moana Council Committee meeting on 23 June 2022\n\n· Environmental Volunteering to Toi Moana Monitoring and Operations Committee meeting on 6 September 2022.\n\nThis report provides a snapshot of highlights from the Community Participation Impact Area.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nThis work is guided by the Local Government Act, in particular s10 Purpose of local government and s82 Principles of consultation.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\n¨ Environmental\n\n¨ Cultural\n\nþ Social\n\n¨ Economic\n\nEnhanced community participation in local government contributes to greater connections between community and te Taiao, grows social cohesion and brings the lived experience of into decision making processes that affect our diverse community. Social capital is difficult to measure, but volunteer hours, voter turnout and representative participation can all provide a proxy for the social wellbeing created for community through their interactions with council\n\n2. Ngā Kaupapa Miramira | Highlights\n\n2.1 Community Engagement\n\nEngagement is when we purposefully approach affected communities to help shape decisions about our proposed plans and actions. Covid disruption has meant digital and online engagement, proactively engaging young people and empowering community through participatory budgeting has become even more important to deliver on this impact area.\n\n2.1.1 Digital and Online Engagement\n\nThe Participate site, (www.participate.boprc.govt.nz) is supporting delivery of our action plan and impact areas by engaging with the community through our online platforms. Since launching the site in February 2021 we now have 3391 registered users.\n\nThe site offers the ability to provide feedback and engagement via its integrated tools. In the past twelve months, Participate has hosted over 20 online engagement projects where almost 20,000 people have visited the site and made over 2000 contributions (providing feedback or engagement) on this platform alone.\n\nThe Top visited Projects in the year to 1 September 2022 were:\n\n· School Sustainability and Resilience Fund (7,205 Visits)\n\n· Regional Public Transport Plan (2,392 Visits)\n\n· Bus Network Refresh (2,167 Visits)\n\n· Rotorua Bus network Refresh (2,032 Visits)\n\n· Rates Remission and Postponement Policy (1,841 Visits)\n\nThe ability to have your say through online surveys, mapping, polling, and realtime feedback has been complimentary to the existing online channels such as Facebook, Zoom and our Website which have hosted webinars and livestreams. Demographic data obtained through Participate is reviewed regularly and mapped against NZ Census Data to ensure that we are reaching a wide range of views across the region.\n\nReceiving feedback on complex issues\n\nThe recent Essential Freshwaters and Visions Outcome project was noted by Harvest Digital (Participate provider) to their clients (in Australia, New Zealand and Canada) as one of their top five projects in the last quarter.\n\nThey chose this project because the interactive mapping tool was effective at engaging readers who were able to provide direct feedback on the area that affected them the most. This project attracted over 600 visitors with 97 completing the mapping tool and providing feedback on a topic that would have been difficult to reach audiences with through traditional methods. Refer below:\n\nEssential Freshwaters and Visions Outcome project on Participate Bay of Plenty effectively allowed community to provide feedback on the area that affected them most. Link: https://www.participate.boprc.govt.nz/vision-and-outcomes\n\n2.1.2 Youth Engagement\n\nThe Youth Engagement Plan was adopted by Council 23 June 2022.This plan outlines how young people (16-25 years old) can be involved in decision making and action with the Bay of Plenty Regional Coil Toi Moana going forward. It was prepared over six months and presented by representatives of the Youth Involvement Panel (YIP). Community Engagement staff are working alongside teams across council and partners to deliver on action points.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nRelationship Building\n\nBeing more visible and approachable underpins many of the actions in the Youth Engagement Plan. Establishing and strengthening relationships with schools, youth groups and key stakeholders is underway to ensure a wraparound approach to youth engagement wherein time and resources are used in the most beneficial way.\n\nConnecting young people to the work council does\n\nStaff attended the Canvas Careers Expo in Tauranga, and Edgecumbe College Careers Evening on 13 August 2022. Staff attended along with YIP group members to showcase the mahi people at Toi Moana, highlighting career pathways and promoting the Summer Experience Programme. Over 3000 rangatahi were reached through these actions. Interviews of young staff by YIP members are planned to be filmed in October.\n\nConnecting young people with volunteering\n\nMany young people have been engaged in planting days with local trusts and care groups this Winter. For example the following kura/schools have taken part in planting events with the Coastal Catchments team in the Western Bay:\n\n· Otamarakau\n\n· Paengaroa\n\n· Rangiuru\n\n· Te Puke Primary\n\n· Te Puke Intermediate\n\n· Pukehina\n\n· Maketu kura\n\n· Te Kura Kaupapa o Te Matai\n\n· Waihi Beach\n\nCare group opportunities and events open to the public are communicated through the monthly Participate eNewsletter. This e-newletter currently has 1,402 unique subscribers.\n\n2.1.3 Participatory budgeting\n\nToi Moana trialled this a new funding technique called participatory budgeting with the School Sustainability & Resilience Fund launched in February. Participatory budgeting is a way of providing funding where community members propose projects that meet set criteria and funding is allocated based on a public voting process. Educational institutes in the region submitted proposed projects related to sustainability and climate change resilience action.\n\n· 46 applications from schools, kohanga, kura, preschools, kindergartens and other education organisations from across the region worth more than $150,000 to the Fund passed screening and were put to public vote.\n\n· 1416 individuals allocated funding through the online platform to prioritise $35,000 of funding.\n\n· Representatives of the Youth Involvement Panel (YIP) allocated the remaining $15,000 to projects that had been unsuccessful in the public voting based on criteria they established independently\n\n· 18 projects are under contract to deliver their projects by the end of 2022.\n\nIncreasing the reach and representativeness of participants in council decision making and action is a focus of this Impact Area, and project in particular. Online participant age, gender, ethnicity and postcode are the closest match to census data yet, with a representativeness index of 0.68. (0 is no correlation, 1 would be a perfect match). Staff will monitor and report on the projects funded early in 2023.\n\n2.2 Volunteering\n\nThrough the Long-Term Plan 2021 development, an additional $500,000 funding was allocated annually to support volunteers, coordinated through the Integrated Catchments Team. This funding provided additional support to care groups working directly with council ($215,000) and t volunteer sector organisations ($285,000).\n\n2.2.1 Definitions and measures of volunteering\n\nThe definition of an ‘environmental volunteer’ agreed to at Councils Operations and Monitoring Committee on 6 September 2022 is: “A person who chooses to work voluntarily for the environmental good of the community and is supported directly or indirectly by Bay of Plenty Regional Council”\n\nThe table below provides a summary of three key work areas that contribute to environmental Volunteering and receive direct funding support from Council.\n\nDetailed examples of work carried out through environmental volunteering and including care groups was presented to the Monitoring and Operations Committee (8 March 2022). Some highlights for the year were:\n\nAnglican Church of Raukōkore Restoration and Preservation Trust Care Group\n\nThis restoration project underway near Waihau Bay is focused around the 125 year old Anglican Church of Raukōkore. Volunteers are planting natives, removing weeds and trapping pests in the vulnerable coastal area to protect habitat for the resident Little Blue Penguins and the historic building culturally significant for Te Whānau- ā-Apanui.\n\nFriends of The Blade, Whakamarama Community Inc.\n\nThis is a volunteer-run community conservation group aims to reduce pest animals within their project area of the Kaimai Mamaku Forest Park in to allow the native birds and bush to flourish. In 2016 a group of enthusiastic locals started planning and cutting trap lines through 90 hectares of bush with high predator numbers. Five years on, the group moved from toxins to non-toxic bait in DOC-approved humane traps, and have 300ha under protection supported by over 40 local volunteers.\n\n2.2.2 Volunteer Sector Capability and Capacity\n\nCouncil confirmed funding of $285,000 per annum for three groups through LTP 2021-2031 deliberations. This funding provides professional support and training to enable the environmental volunteer sector organisations to operate effectively and to grow the sector. Funding agreements are in place all three organisations for three years ending 30 June 2024.\n\n· Bay Conservation Alliance (BCA) $85,000\n\n· NZ Landcare $100,000\n\n· Envirohub $100,000\n\n2.3 Funding Community Led Projects\n\nAs part of the Community Participation Action Plan 2021/22, community funding focused on ensuring the greatest impact and value from our grants and funds.\n\n2.3.1 Environmental Enhancement Fund\n\nThe Environmental Enhancement Fund (EEF) supports local projects that aim to enhance, preserve, or protect the region's natural or historic character. For the first time in several years the fund was fully subscribed for 2021/2022 and $322,837 of funding was allocated. Projects came from a mixture of well established applicants and newly formed, motivated community groups. Already this financial year, the fund has received over $360,000 worth of applications. (Correct as of 01/09/2022).\n\nSome highlights for the year were:\n\nTe Takinga Marae - members of the community came together to construct a riverside boardwalk connecting the marae in Mourea to the adjacent playground area and planted native plants, Rongoa and Maara kai.\n\nWhakatāne Kiwi Trust - this group enhanced and expanded on their trapping network in the Whakatāne District. Through community-based projects and landowner cooperation the area is seeing the kiwi and other indigenous species thrive.\n\nWaihī Beach School - the school have been revitalising the Joan Jensen grove. A huge amount of community volunteers helped restore forest understory vegetation with native species. Other parts of the project included wetland planting to improve water quality, and plant and pest animal control.\n\n2.3.2 Community Initiatives Fund\n\nThe Community Initiatives Fund (CIF) provides funding to community groups to deliver services that contribute strongly to the achievement of Council’s goals, but are not eligible for other Council funding. A total of $600,000.00 was allocated over a 3 year period across 6 projects in the Long Tern Plan 2021.\n\nSome highlights for the year were:\n\nTauranga Moana Biosecurity - Guardian of the Forest, a creative campaign on Kauri Protection which took place over the Easter weekend and school holidays. It received 79 entries, 1150 votes, 9751 views, 139,538 impressions.\n\nWater safety BOP - Te Puna Ora o Mataatua in Eastern Bay of Plenty are assisting in the design and delivery of various water safety educational workshops and activities to be delivered to the Māori community. Note: Council were advised in June 2022 that due to other funding sources not being continued, Water Safety BOP would not continue to operate in 2022/23.\n\nTourism BOP - Representatives from community groups and TBOP were able to effectively promote the Low Carbon Circular Economy programme and engage 18 visitor industry organisations in Waihī Beach and Katikati to sign up.\n\n2.3.3 Regional Safety Rescue Services Fund\n\nThe Regional Safety and Rescue Services Fund (RSRSF) supports organisations that provide vital safety and rescue services.\n\nFollowing Council direction through LTP 2021 Deliberations, Council provided funding to Surf Lifesaving NZ to ensure service levels were maintained across the BOP for the 2021/22 summer with lifeguard services funded across 13 locations.\n\nIn early 2021, the first full funding round for the Regional Safety Rescue Service Fund was completed with funding for five organisations confirmed for 2022/23 to 2023/24 via the Civil Defence and Emergency Management Committee.\n\nOrganisation\n\n2021/22\n\n2022/23\n\n2023/24\n\nSurf Lifesaving NZ\n\n$292,000\n\n$327,000\n\n$333,000\n\nCoastguard NZ\n\n$20,000\n\n$20,000\n\nRotorua Mountain Bike Club\n\n$80,000\n\n$80,000\n\nLand Search and Rescue\n\n$20,000\n\n$20,000\n\nYouth Search and Rescue\n\n$4,000\n\n$4,000\n\nTotal Funding allocated\n\n$292,000\n\n$451,000\n\n$457,000\n\nThe Council Budget for RSRS set through the LTP 2021-2031 is $400,000 per annum. Funding allocations for 2022-2024 include the allocation of $108,000 in reserve funding that was unallocated in 2021/22.\n\n2.3.4 Te Hapai Ora\n\nTe Hapai Ora - Regional Community Outcomes Fund supports community led initiatives across the region, with funding up to $2,000 for events or projects that align with one or more of Toi Moana| BOPRC Community Outcomes. Annually a total fund of $30,000 is available on a ‘first come’ basis. This year ending 30 June, saw a record number of 41 applications, 29 of which were approved funding (in part or in full).\n\n2.3.5 2022/23 Priority actions\n\nImprove the return on investment from community funding projects involving volunteers. This year had a more robust approach towards accurate data but to meet our target we will need to work on how we measure investment.\n\nCommunity funding review. This goal was originally set due to the low uptake of the Environmental Enhancement Fund but was postponed after the fund regained traction and ended up oversubscribed. This review will now be looked at in a much wider scope.\n\nHelping Hand. This document was due to be updated by end of 2021/22 and is now set for 2022/23.\n\n2.4 Democracy\n\n2.4.1 Participation in Elections\n\nParticipation in the formal democratic process includes council meeting, voter enrolment and nominations of candidates. Key actions taken to support this workstream include:\n\n· Providing enrolment packs at each office reception and at community events attended by staff including community geothermal meetings, Instep Young Leaders, Canvas Careers expo, Edgecumbe Careers Evening with at least 20 enrolment packs being taken away by participants so far.\n\n· Advertising in a range of media across the region to encourage potential candidates to consider standing for council, and planned advertising to encourage voter participation.\n\n· Updating elections information on the council website\n\n· Community funding of up to $300 towards reasonable costs to hold “Meet The Candidates” events is available and has been applied for by two community organisations at the time of writing.\n\n· Meet The Candidate Events planned by council in three towns, Rotorua, Tauranga and Whakatāne with independent MC’s to supplement community led activities.\n\n3. Considerations\n\n3.1 Risks and Mitigations\n\n3.2 Climate Change\n\nThe Community Participation Impact Area seeks to support actions identified in the Climate Change Action plan including:\n\n· Supporting constructive community engagement on mitigation and adaptation projects underway with the Engineering and Transport Teams\n\n· Supporting environmental care groups and volunteer organisations with actions such as planting to assist with carbon reduction, and reduce the impact of sea level rise\n\n· Promoting behaviour change to reduce emissions through the Future Fit online tool to measure personal carbon emissions.\n\n· Targeting funding of community led projects to support sustainability and resilience focused outcomes\n\n3.3 Implications for Māori\n\nThe Community Participation Impact Area seeks to support actions identified in the Partnerships with Māori Action plan including:\n\n3.4 Financial Implications\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications and this fits within the allocated budget.\n\n4. Next Steps\n\nImplementation of the Community Participation Action Plan will continue, and staff will provide regular progress reports.\n\nReport To:\n\nRegional Council\n\nMeeting Date:\n\n29 September 2022\n\nReport Writer:\n\nJessica Easton, Legal and Commercial Manager\n\nReport Authoriser:\n\nMat Taylor, General Manager, Corporate\n\nPurpose:\n\nApprove Updated Delegations Manual\n\nDelegations Manual\n\nRecommendations\n\nThat the Regional Council:\n\n1 Receives the report, Delegations Manual.\n\n2 Revokes all existing delegations made by Council to the Chief Executive and council officers directly, except to the extent that any of those are not included in the Chief Executive’s Delegations Manual or relate to financial delegations.\n\n3 Delegates to the Chief Executive as set out in Appendix 1.\n\n4 Approves the Chief Executive’s sub-delegations contained in the Chief Executive’s Delegations Manual.\n\n5 Delegates the powers contained in the Chief Executive’s Delegations Manual that are unable to be sub-delegated to the Chief Executive directly to the proposed delegates, being the specified powers Maritime Transport Act 1994 and the Resource Management Act 1991.\n\n6 Authorises the Chief Executive to approve updates to the Chief Executive’s Delegations Manual.\n\n7 Delegates to the General Manager, Regulatory Services:\n\n(a) The power to appoint enforcement officers under section 38 of the Resource Management Act 1991.\n\n(b) The power to issue warrants to enforcement officers. This delegation is made pursuant to clause 32B of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002 and for avoidance of doubt is made having considered the matters under clause 32B(2) of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002.\n\n(c) The authority to determine to take enforcement action and/or prosecute a person for committing an offence Council is empowered to enforce (including Bylaws).\n\n1. Introduction\n\nCouncil has a range of powers and functions under various legislation as well as general administrative duties. These powers and functions are generally delegated to the Chief Executive (as Council’s only direct employee appointment) and must be further delegated to Council officers to ensure that Council officers have the appropriate authority required to undertake their roles.\n\nThe current Delegations Manual under which the Chief Executive and Council staff operate was put in place in 2015.\n\nThe Delegations Manual should be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that it is up to date with applicable legislation and captures all the necessary powers and functions that Council staff require to undertake Council activities and do so in a manner which is efficient and effective.\n\nIn undertaking this review staff have focused in particular on ensuring that the proposed Delegations Manual:\n\n• includes all key legislation used by staff to carry out Council’s functions and powers, including new legislation and bylaws;\n\n• contains clear policy direction and guidance on how delegations work and the circumstances in which they can be exercised;\n\n• consolidates all current delegations. Since 2015 there have been a number of delegations made and having this consolidated within a single document will be more efficient and transparent;\n\n• covers practical scenarios to allow staff to effectively and efficiently carry out their roles where they have otherwise been constrained by limited or no delegations; and\n\n• contains sufficient flexibility to account for restructuring and job title changes.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nPursuant to clause 32 of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, Council may delegate to an officer of the local authority any of its responsibilities, duties, or powers except those specifically retained by Council. Council last made a general delegation to the Chief Executive in 2013.\n\nStaff recommend that a new general delegation to Council is resolved to ensure clarity as to the extent of the Chief Executive’s delegated powers. The recommended delegation to the Chief Executive is set out at Appendix 1.\n\nPursuant to clause 32B of Schedule 7 of the Local Government Act 2002, a Council officer (in this case the Chief Executive) has the power to sub-delegate any authority delegated to the Chief Executive by Council. The Delegations Manual is the practical exercise of this power and sets out the Chief Executive’s sub-delegations to Council officers pursuant to this clause.\n\nThere are certain delegations that must be made by Council to staff directly for example, delegations under the Resource Management Act 1991. Delegations of this kind are included within the Delegations Manual for completeness with a caveat that they require a resolution of Council to be amended.\n\nDelegations under the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002 and Rating Valuations Act 1998 also fall within this category and Council resolved to delegate these powers and functions on 23 June 2022. They are included in the Delegations Manual for completeness.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\n¨ Environmental\n\n¨ Cultural\n\n¨ Social\n\n¨ Economic\n\nAppropriate delegations support the efficient delivery of all of Council’s work to improve the well-beings.\n\n2. Considerations\n\n2.1 Risks and Mitigations\n\nThere are no significant risks associated with this matter. The adoption of the new Chief Executive’s Delegations Manual will reduce risk to Council.\n\n2.2 Climate Change\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and there is no need to consider climate change impacts.\n\n2.3 Implications for Māori\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and the impact on Māori is equivalent to the impact on the general community.\n\n2.4 Community Engagement\n\nThe matters addressed in this report are of a procedural nature and do not require community engagement.\n\n2.5 Financial Implications\n\nThere are no material unbudgeted financial implications and this fits within the allocated budget.\n\n3.

Council has identified and assessed different options and considered community views as part of making the decision, in proportion to the level of significance.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe Rangitāiki Floodway upgrade is a multi-stage project designed to take pressure off the flood prone Rangitāiki River by diverting some of its flow during significant weather events. A resource consent was obtained in 2009 increasing the capacity of the floodway to reduce flood levels in the Rangitāiki River from upstream of Edgecumbe to the river mouth. Since 2011 the floodway channel has been widened, stopbanks have been raised and a second outlet channel created into the Rangitāiki River. Once upgrades are complete this will reduce pressure on Rangitāiki River stopbanks during large flood events.\n\nUpgrading the floodway was originally proposed following an Edgecumbe stopbank breach in 2004. Another breach occurred in 2017 before the upgrades could be completed. Since 2017 Stages, 4, 5, and 7 have been completed. Stage 6 was largely completed in 2021/22 with only the swing gates (flood barriers) on McLean Road and McCracken Road to be completed along with some minor finishing work. The swing gates are scheduled for installation in March 2023 and the Stage 6 finishing work will be complete by June 2023.\n\nThe final stage of the floodway project is the upgrade to the spillway, the structure that allows increased diverted flow into the floodway. While originally planned for 2021/22 the timeframes for the work were extended due to the complexity and risks found in the modelling and design phase. The Spillway construction project has incurred a more comprehensive design requirement, and this will be reported to Council once a complete Engineers estimate is available. The Spillway construction will complete the Floodway upgrade which was proposed following major flooding in 2004.\n\n1.1 Legislative Framework\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 2002, regional authorities are responsible for the provision and control of river scheme assets. The Council manages and maintains the River Schemes under the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941 and in keeping with its Rivers and Drainage Asset Management Plans. These plans include levels of service and flood protection that the Council provides for the community.\n\n1.2 Alignment with Strategic Framework\n\n1.2.1 Community Well-beings Assessment\n\nDominant Well-Beings Affected\n\nþ Environmental\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nþ Cultural\n\nLow - Positive\n\nþ Social\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nþ Economic\n\nMedium - Positive\n\nThe purpose of Local Government includes promoting the social, economic, environmental, and cultural well-being of communities in the present and for the future.\n\nIdentify which dominant Community Well-being(s) the project/proposal will affect. Also indicate what level of impact and what effect the project/proposal will have on the relevant well-being(s). For instance consider:\n\n• Will the project/proposal have a high, medium or low impact on the well-being(s)?\n\n• Are the effects of the impacts positive and/or negative?\n\n• Describing simply the overall impact of the project/proposal.\n\n• Providing an explanation if there are positive and negative impacts for each well-being(s).\n\n• Identifying if your assessment of the actual or proposed impact is backed by evidence.\n\nAlso consider identifying if there are any relevant considerations against the Living Standards Framework.\n\nFurther guidelines available here.\n\n1.3 Significance\n\nThe recommended proposal/decision has been assessed against the criteria and thresholds in Council’s Significance and Engagement Policy, and can be considered:\n\n2. Rangitāiki Floodway\n\n2.1 Rangitāiki Floodway Stage 6\n\nTo access the options table, in the “Tools” pane click “Insert Text” “1 Options Table”, you can do this as many times as necessary.\n\nPhysical works are complete for stopbank sections of Stage 6. This stage comprised three distinct projects (Stage 6A, 6B and 6C) with a total budget of $10.9 million.\n\nWhile Stages 6A and 6B were delivered to plan and to budget Stage 6C involved significantly more earthworks and geotechnical treatment than was originally envisaged, this portion of work was also paused for a time over winter which extended the work programme out over two construction seasons.\n\nThe major variations to budget for Stage 6C were impacted by the four key factors below.\n\nWhakatāne District Council Road Restrictions ($127,000) - The Whakatāne District Council (WDC) has responsibility for local roads including maintenance. WDC was concerned about the impact over time for local rural roads due to the concentration of large vehicles and loads associated with the Rangitāiki Floodway project and other BOPRC works (such as the flood repair project). During the construction of Stage 6, WDC requested the diversion of construction vehicles from some local roads along with speed restrictions. The result of this has been additional cartage costs (longer route to site) and slower construction timeframes (machinery waiting longer for material).\n\nGeotechnical Conditions ($280,0000) - Stage 6C geotechnical ground conditions were unlike those experienced for Stages 6A and 6B. During the construction phase ground inspections, the geotechnical engineer identified the need for significant deconstruction of the existing stopbank and footprint. This was in addition to what had been determined during the investigation phase. This unforeseen work along with greater than estimated ground settlement, material loses due to hauling and wet weather conditions all required additional construction earth to complete the project.\n\nWork extended out over two construction seasons ($280,000) - Stage 6C estimates were based on the project being delivered over one construction season however due to delays with land access agreements and resource consent this stage was carried out over two construction seasons. Consequently, price increases and additional compensation payments were incurred.\n\nStage 6 Culverts ($258,000) – During construction additional culvert replacements were identified that needed replacement.\n\nAs a result of the above issues which amount to $945,000 the available budget was fully utilised and there was no carry forward funding available to complete Stage 6.\n\nThe swing gates (flood barriers across roads on McLean Road and McCracken Road) and some minor site finishing works were not completed in 2021/22. Additional budget provision is required in 2022/23 to complete these Stage 6 items as follows:\n\n3.
