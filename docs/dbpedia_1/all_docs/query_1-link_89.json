        "text": "WHY is it so hard for Adelaide 36ers teams to win NBL games on the road?\n\nIt's just one of a number of questions emerging again this season despite a new coach and a major off-season player upheaval.\n\nRight there, some will tell you that is the issue - that it takes a while for it all to come together.\n\nTell it to the retooled - minus one hammer - Dragons, who are 4-2.\n\nThe 36ers are 2-3, which breaks down to 2-0 at home, 0-3 on the road where they are again tonight, facing the Hawks in Wollongong.\n\nAdelaide teams are almost notorious for losing to new faces - the Spirit again this season - and for their inability to consistently perform outside home.\n\nWhether it's two nights away without the blanky or home duna, not having the comfort of the stars and planets painted on the ceiling or a teddy to cuddle, it's time for less excuses, more results. The last time an Adelaide team had a positive road record was in 2000.\n\nSome are starting to query the sense in appointing a rookie coach in Scott Ninnis, and then not supporting him with a crew of experienced assistants.\n\nOthers will point to an eye injury hampering Mark Tyndale against Sydney in Canberra, the late withdrawals of Adam Ballinger and Aaron Bruce costing the team dearly in NZ and the prolonged absence of Paora Winitana as factors in the road fatalities.\n\nOf Ninnis' main rotation though, here's a chilling fact. Only Luke Schenscher and Jacob Holmes post better numbers across the board on the road. Schensch averages 11.5 points, 6.5 boards here, 19.7 and 9.7 there."
