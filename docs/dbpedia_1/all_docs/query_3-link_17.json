        "text": "PROVO, Utah – The Kevin Young era is underway for BYU basketball.\n\nAfter a challenging week for the program that saw Mark Pope leave for Kentucky, BYU turns the page with Kevin Young, a veteran NBA assistant coach who is viewed as one of the top strategic minds in basketball.\n\nBYU basketball hires Kevin Young to be the head coach\n\nBut he’s never had the task of constructing a college basketball roster. What is Young inheriting in the BYU basketball program? Here’s an overview of how the roster looks for next season.\n\nSeven scholarship players are currently on the BYU basketball roster. That leaves six open scholarship spots for Young to work with for the 2024-25 season.\n\nSeniors\n\nNoah Waterman, Forward\n\nTrevin Knell, Guard\n\nFousseyni Traore, Forward/Center\n\nAtiki Ally Atiki, Center\n\nTrey Stewart, Guard\n\nThese are the upperclassmen that Young is inheriting. The fact that none of these guys entered the transfer portal after Mark Pope left speaks to the potential that they want to hear what Young and his staff will offer.\n\nThe transfer portal window for college basketball is open until May 1.\n\nFousseyni Traore was an Honorable Mention All-Big 12 center last season for BYU off the bench. That was while navigating a hamstring injury that didn’t clear up until midway through Big 12 action.\n\nJuniors\n\nDawson Baker, Guard\n\nThe former UC Irvine guard dealt with a foot injury last season. He is expected to have two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nFreshmen\n\nIsaac Davis, Forward\n\nDavis is a 6-foot-7 forward from Hillcrest High School in Idaho. There have been comparisons to him being in a skill set similar to former BYU star Yoeli Childs.\n\nWalk-Ons\n\nTownsend Tripple, Forward\n\nPaora Winitana, Guard\n\nAdam Stewart, Center\n\nBYU basketball players currently in the Transfer Portal\n\nDallin Hall, Guard\n\nRichie Saunders, Guard\n\nAly Khalifa, Center\n\nMarcus Adams Jr., Forward\n\nTanner Hayhurst, Forward\n\nThings get interesting for Kevin Young and his potential staff when it comes to the transfer portal players. Can they pull any former BYU players out of the portal and get them back to Provo?\n\nThe focus should zero in on point guard Dallin Hall and shooting guard Richie Saunders. Hall has not ruled out the possibility of coming back to BYU. Saunders has not released a list of schools that he is considering.\n\nCenter Aly Khalifa has BYU in his final three schools, Kentucky, and Louisville.\n\nMitch Harper is a BYU Insider for KSLsports.com and hosts the Cougar Tracks Podcast (SUBSCRIBE) and Cougar Sports Saturday (12–3 p.m.) on KSL Newsradio.
