This list was developed to help fellow genealogists with indexing. Some Maori appear in indexes under their Maori name and then in other indexes under their European or Pakeha version or a combination of both. Names have been collected from official NZ Government sources, books, (including The Bible), headstones, death notices and from the families concerned.\n\nI am aware that some names have both a pre-contact meaning and a transliteration usage. As an example - Matiu was a female name pre-contact but is more commonly known as the transliteration for Matthew. These names are meant as a guide only.\n\nIf you can add any further names to this list I would be most pleased to hear from you at cmclement at clear.net.nz. Thanks to all those who have emailed me with names from their own research, they have been of great help.\n\nThe - MAORI INTEREST GROUP - of the NZ Society of Genealogists has a great deal of information to help research Maori ancestry.Linked.\n\nAs this is a long list you may find it easier to use Ctrl-F to find the name your are looking for."
