        "text": "Hey @GislaineD!\n\nThanks for reaching out to the Community! This help article goes over how we can remove the Constant Contact logo from the footer of the email campaigns as long as you have an active paid account. Because you already requested to have this removed, I did go ahead and remove the Constant Contact logo from your account. So any existing or future campaigns should no longer have that logo within the footer. Let us know if you have any further questions!\n\nJessica H.\n\nCommunity Support\n\nIf you find my post helpful, and it answers your question, please mark it as an \"Accepted Solution\" by clicking the Accept as Solution button in the bottom right hand corner of this post.\n\nIncrease your profitability by integrating your email marketing and social media.

This is the only place I could find to make my request to remove your logo from my campaigns, it is absurd that I can not do this for myself. I pay for my service and I am appalled that I have to have you remove YOUR LOGO.\n\nFurthermore... I like to handle things in the moment I realize I need to do them. In searching your knowledge base I discovered you have me hostage... meaning that I have to request you to remove the logo... yet you provide no support email address for me to make this request.\n\nI am seriously considering leaving constant contact due to this absolute frustration, and waste of my valuable time.\n\nRegards,\n\nKaren J Lewis\n\nHello,\n\nThank you for contacting the Community! I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you, unfortunately Constant Contact does not have an email support channel.\n\nI have removed the logo from your account, if you refresh your page or log out and log back in to your account you should see the change.\n\nThank you,\n\nMariah_P\n\nCommunity & Social Media Support\n\nIf you find my post helpful, and it answers your question, please mark it as an \"Accepted Solution\" by clicking the Accept as Solution button in the bottom right hand corner of this post.\n\nIncrease your profitability by integrating your email marketing and social media.

I have taken a look at your most recent campaign and was unable to replicate this same experience. With that said, we would be happy to help look into this further with you. What is the name of the campaign you are seeing this happen with? Which email client are you using? What model of iPhone and version of iOS? We have seen cases where emails are not mobile responsive in the Outlook Mobile App for iPhone. If you are using the Outlook app, what version is it? In these cases we suggest viewing the email campaign in a different mobile mail client such as the native mail app or the Gmail app.\n\nFrankie.P\n\nCommunity & Social Media Support\n\nDid I answer your question?
