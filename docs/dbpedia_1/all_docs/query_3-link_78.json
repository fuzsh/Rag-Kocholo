        "text": "The constitutional status of Aotearoa/New Zealand, which rests on the premises of state sovereignty, has been a sociological and political issue for several decades. Mainstream government-led approaches to constitutional change have sought to maintain the status quo, leaving sovereignty unchallenged and rangatiratanga ignored. Despite their reinvigoration, left-wing movements have largely abdicated themselves from any serious discussion of the principles of sovereignty on which such an approach stands, rendering them ineffective in confronting the presuppositions of the State. This is not the case in Te Ao Māori, which has seen in the process and publication of the Matike Mai report (2016) a resurgence in theoretical and strategic innovations around constitutional transformation. The purpose of this thesis is to intervene in the constitutional debate by providing a critical analysis of the logic of state sovereignty, and to conjoin such an investigation with the conclusions of Matike Mai and other Māori and indigenous scholars. To do so, I first chart a course through the history of sovereignty as presented in the work of Giorgio Agamben, before providing an explication of Agamben’s critique of the logics and structures of the sovereign. Such an understanding of sovereignty is necessary in order to grasp the stakes involved in the constitutional debate. Despite the strength of Agamben’s diagnosis of sovereignty, his work is hampered by an inadequate theory of praxis for its overcoming. Where Agamben falls short, I turn to the work of scholars including Taiaiake Alfred and Glenn Coulthard to approach the critique of sovereignty from a different angle. While Agamben fails to provide a strategic vision for the dismantling of the sovereign logic, the germs of such a praxis are found in the concept of countersovereignty. I posit countersovereignty as the strategy through which a vision of constitutional transformation can be implemented. The final section of the thesis analyses the Matike Mai report in relation to Agamben’s critique of sovereignty, before reconstructing the dynamics of Māori social and political organisation prior to colonisation and investigating the logic of tikanga, the tūrangawaewae of this model of organisation. Using Agamben’s conclusions over the nature of sovereignty, I follow Matike Mai’s recommendations to their logical end-points, in the process taking their conclusions beyond the scope of the original report."
