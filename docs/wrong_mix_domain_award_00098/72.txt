The prestigious Marconi Society, established in 1974 to honor Guglielmo Marconi, the Nobel laureate who invented radio, is seeking nominations for its Paul Baran Young Scholar Awards. The award, “recognizes young scientists and engineers with the potential to make game-changing contributions in the field of communications and the Internet.” While this award is separate from the well-known Marconi Prize, the identified young scholars for the Paul Baran Young award are seen as having the potential to someday become Marconi Prize winners too.

The awards will be present in London on October 20th at the Royal Society. Awardees will receive $4000 cash prize plus $1000 in expenses to attend the event. This also gives an opportunity for these young scholars to gain well-deserved recognition, as well as meet and network with some of the industry’s best-known scientists and engineers. If you know a student who has, “demonstrated outstanding research capability, entrepreneurial spirit, and technical vision,” head over to the Marconi Society’s webpage to submit your nominations. The deadline is June 30th 2015.
