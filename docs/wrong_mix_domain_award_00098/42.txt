The Guglielmo Marconi Foundation promotes and participates in the formation of national and international awards, to perpetuate the memory and knowledge of the great scientist, and support research and innovation in the field of radio communications.

I thank Mr. Hildebrand for the very kind but too flattering remarks that he has made of myself and of my work in Wireless Telegraphy.

I believe that one perhaps of the least thought of advantages enjoyed by the winner of the Nobel Prize is that he is asked to visit Sweden and thereby given an opportunity of appreciating the illustrious count of Linné, Schéele, Berzelius, and Arrhenius.

Thanks to the high standing which science has for so long attain and to the impartiality of the Nobel Prize Committee, the Nobel Prize for Physics is rightly considered everywhere as the highest reward within the reach of workers in that branch of Natural Philosophy.
