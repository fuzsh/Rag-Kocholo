        "text": "“Going wireless” involves not only the elimination of wires but also the production of electromagnetic waves, a realization that had far-reaching implications for the cultural logics of German modernity. As a media archaeology of wirelessness, this dissertation situates the “discovery” of electromagnetic radiation and the “invention” of wireless transmission in a richer field of scientific, experimental, and aesthetic relations during the early and pre-history of national broadcasting. Before wireless transmission came to be synonymous with the mass distribution medium of radio or even the long-distance communication medium of wireless telegraphy, it was at the center of speculation about a variety of possible wireless futures. Understanding the rhetoric of the new media of radio and wireless telegraphy in the first chapter opens onto questions of continuity and change in the longue durée of the second chapter. The insights gained from this comparison of pre-modern cultural techniques and modern electronic technologies are crucial for understanding the “discovery” of electromagnetic radiation and the “invention” of wireless telegraphy examined in the third and fourth chapters with a focus on the immediate pre-history of national broadcasting in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The significance of this pre-historical period and the contingency of national broadcasting in the mid-twentieth century arguably only became apparent with the revival of wireless transmission at the turn of the twenty-first century, as the fifth chapter makes evident. As a contribution to the early and pre-history of national broadcasting, this dissertation suggests a new way of thinking about the order of wirelessness, from “wireless” as synonymous with the communication medium of telegraphy or the distribution medium of radio, to “wireless” as electromagnetic radiation and a medium of experimentation.\n\nAbtract: Following research and inventions into the field of polyphase low frequency alternating current Nikola Tesla, around 1890, entered into a new field of high frequency currents. After developing novel generators capable of producing higher frequency alternating currents, he turned his attention to generating alternating currents by discharging condenser through a coil coupled to another coil – secondary of \" Tesla transformer \". In the three famous lectures between 1891 and 1893 he presented many new characteristics and possible uses of high frequency currents: for illumination, in medicine, industry and for wireless energy transmission. For wireless energy transmission, in 1891-1892 he developed connection of generator to antenna-ground through tuned Tesla transformer. In 1893 he disclosed the principle of wireless energy transmission with already explained radio transmitter and receiver tuned to operating frequency of the transmitter. In 1897 Tesla submitted two USA patents on apparatus and system of electrical energy transmission, issued in 1900. These patents were used in the Supreme Court case brought by the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America against the United States of America, alleging that they have used wireless devices that infringed on USA Marconi patent of June 28, 1904. After 25 years, the United States Supreme Court on June 21, 1943 invalidated the fundamental American radio patent of Marconi, as containing nothing which was not already contained in patents granted to Lodge, Tesla and Stone. However, in spite of this and many others who are recognizing Tesla as one of the radio pioneers, inventor of the basic radio principle of four tuned circuits, Tesla's name is still waiting the fool recognition of his role in the development of radio."
