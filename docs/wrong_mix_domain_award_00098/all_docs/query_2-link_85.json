        "text": "“To be in the company of broadcasting luminaries like Larry King, Don Imus, Rick Dees, Kidd Kraddick and Ryan Seacrest is beyond humbling,” said Julie Gates. “We love radio, it’s the best way to bring people together to make this an even greater place to live.”\n\nGene added, “It was wonderful to enjoy the Marconi Awards with WRAL-FM General Manager Katie Phillips (I think she screamed louder than we did when our names were announced). Thank you Capitol Broadcasting Company and the Goodmon family for making WRAL-FM such a great place to broadcast and connect with our amazing Triangle community.”\n\nSince the Marconi Awards have been created, the state of North Carolina has been recognized with four awards. Gene and Julie became the very first to bring home a Marconi to the Triangle and are the first personalities in the State of North Carolina to be recognized with a Marconi!\n\nEstablished in 1989 and named after inventor and Nobel Prize winner Guglielmo Marconi, the NAB Marconi Radio Awards are given to radio stations and outstanding on-air personalities to recognize excellence in radio.\n\nThis was the third Marconi Award nomination for the Gates and their first win."
