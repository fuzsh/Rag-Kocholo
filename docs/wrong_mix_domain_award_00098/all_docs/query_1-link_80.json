        "text": "1874, April 25\n\nMarconi was born\n\nGuglielmo Marconi\n\nGuglielmo Marconi was born in Bologna; his father was Giuseppe Marconi and his mother, Annie Jameson, was a young Irish Protestant. His mother grew him as a Protestant Christian, teaching him the English language. In a second phase of his life, Guglielmo Marconi was converted to Catholicism.\n\n1880/1894\n\nEducation\n\nRighi and his Laboratory\n\nGuglielmo Marconi did not accomplished regular studies and did not attend the university. He received his education privately at Bologna, Florence and Livorno. The privileged place for his early experiments remains the famous “bug room” at the family estate in today Sasso Marconi. Among his “guardians”, Vincenzo Rosa and Augusto Righi are particularly reported. Especially, Augusto Righi – a scientist and university professor – was publicly thanked and praised by Marconi for his contribution to his education and scientific activity, introducing him almost as “mentor”.\n\n1894\n\nFirst Laboratory\n\nPropagation of Electric Waves\n\nMarconi built his first laboratory to perform experiments on the propagation of electric waves. His family, contrary to some rumours – complained by the very Marconi – endorsed and actively and economically supported the efforts of the young scientist.\n\n1895\n\nSeptember\n\nCelestini\n\nThe historical experiment “of Celestini” (from the name of the hill) was made; Guglielmo Marconi sent a radio signal at a distance of about 1700 meters; the brother and the bailiff, listening with the receiver, signalled the acknowledge receipt of the signal with a shot.\n\n1896\n\nEngland\n\nFrom Italy to England\n\nGuglielmo Marconi moved to England, helped by his knowledge of the language but also spurred – most likely – by his enterpreurial spirit: Marconi realized that England, at the turn of the nineteenth century, was the financial and economic capital of the Planet.\n\n1897, July 2\n\nFirst Patent\n\nPatent of 1897 – Diagrams\n\nGuglielmo Marconi received his first patent for the system of wireless telegraphy –British Patent No. 12. 039 Improvements in Transmitting Electrical Impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefore, applied on June 2, 1896 – opened in fact, the Wireless Universe and its career as an entrepreneur of Communications.\n\n1897\n\nFounding a Company\n\nMarconi’s Telegraph Company\n\nIn this important year, Gugliemo Marconi also founded the company “The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company Limited”, later renamed “Marconi’s Telegraph Company Limited” (1900), in Chelmsford (Essex, England) and made demonstrative transmissions for the Italian government in Rome and La Spezia, coming to transmit signals to a distance of about 30 km.\n\n1898, July\n\nReal-time News\n\nSailing Ragattas of Dublin\n\nGuglielmo Marconi followed the Sailing Ragattas of Dublin on board a ship and sent the news in real time to the Dublin’s Daily Express, which managed to publish the results before the boats’ return.\n\n1898\n\nShip to Ship\n\nRadio Across the Waves\n\nTwo British ships equipped with Marconi’s radiotelegraphic appliances, exchanged radio signals from 140 Km away.\n\n1898, August\n\nRoyal Connection\n\nA Commission from Queen Victoria\n\nMarconi was commissioned by the Queen Victoria to maintain her residence in the Isle of Wight in connection with the royal yacht cruising in the Channel, on which was the Prince of Wales, injured a leg: in 16 days 150 messages were sent.\n\n1898, Autumn\n\nOn Your Marks !\n\nSports Commentary In the USA\n\nGuglielmo Marconi duplicated the experiment of sport “commentary” in the United States, that made him very popular.\n\n1900\n\nPatent 7777\n\nPatent and Transmitter\n\nGuglielmo Marconi obtains the famous patent 7777 (tuned or syntonic telegraphy) linked to the system that allows you to assign certain frequencies to different radio stations.\n\n1901, January 23\n\nOver The Horizon\n\nLizard Wireless Station - Bass Point\n\nMarconi received the first over the horizon wireless signal at the Lizard Wireless Station which was being transmitted from the Isle Of Wight. A distance of 186 miles (300km) which proved that wireless signals followed the earths curvature.\n\n1901, December 12\n\nAcross the Pond\n\nPoldhu Transmission\n\nAfter successfully transmitted signals from the Island of Wight to the tip of Cornwall (approximately 300 km), Gugliemo Marconi made a transatlantic link of nearly 3400 km, between Poldhu (Cornwall, UK) and St. John’s Newfoundland (Canada), showing empirically that the earth curvature does not affect radio transmissions.\n\n1902\n\nDetector Experiments\n\nThe Magnetic Detector\n\nMarconi performed experiments with the detector equipment aboard the armoured cruiser Carlo Alberto, placed at his disposal by the Italian government; the same year he patented the “magnetic detector”, a step towards the “fine tuning” radio.\n\n1902\n\nMore Experiments\n\nThe Daylight Effect\n\nConducting experiments aboard the U.S. liner Philadelphia, Guglielmo Marconi first demonstrated the “daylight effect” on radio, until then only theorized by the scientific world, thus contributing to research in different fields.\n\n1903, January 18\n\nRadio Telegram\n\nCape Cod Station\n\nMarconi opened the station of Cape Cod, near Boston, with a radio telegram of President Thodore Roosevelt to S.M. King Edward VII of England."
