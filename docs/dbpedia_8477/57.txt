The Cohen Film Collection, in cooperation with BFI, is taking the 1939 film “Jamaica Inn,” Alfred Hitchcock‘s last British film, on the road. The tour begins on October 7 at the 2014 New York Film Festival, and continues on to the 2014 Chicago Film Festival.

Based on Daphne Du Maurier’s novel, the film follows a young woman who discovers a gang of criminals organizing shipwrecks for money. This was the first of three Du Maurier books that Hitchcock would go on to direct, the other two being “Rebecca” (1940) and “The Birds” (1963).

Starring Maureen O’Hara of “Miracle on 34th Street” (1947) and Charles Laughton of “Spartacus” (1960), this trailer for the restoration invokes Hitchcock’s rich vision for the set design and special effects that bring this adventurous tale to life.

The film will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on May 12, 2015. Check out the trailer below.
