            "EXCEPTIONALLY RARE Original Australian Trade Ad approx 9\" x 12\" very fine condition.\r\n\r\nThis poster comes from a small collection of Australian Trade Ads from the 30s and 40s. Many came from the trade magazine \"Everyone's Film Weekly\" which was printed in very small quantities and only sent to theatre owners. Few have survived and they are rarely seen. They usually featured different artwork to the larger movie posters. Some were part of distributers magazines and had text on the back."
