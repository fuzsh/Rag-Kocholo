This picture marked director Alfred Hitchcock's last British film before leaving for the United States to direct Rebecca (see below), which was also based on a Daphne Du Maurier novel. A news item in HR notes that Mayflower Films began production on the picture in Apr 1937, but shelved it in May 1937 to begin the film White Gold.
