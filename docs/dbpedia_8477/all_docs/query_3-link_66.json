It summarizes the very different circumstances of the films’ production, which help explain why Rebecca is much closer to its novelistic source than the other two and why the writer was happy with Rebecca and dissatisfied with the other two. It then proceeds to a brief examination of the friendly and professional relationship between Hitchcock and Daphne’s father, the stage and occasionally film actor Gerald Du Maurier, and speculates about possible thematic connections between Hitchcock and Daphne’s grandfather George Du Maurier, the illustrator and author of Trilby and Peter Ibbetson. It concludes that the complex network between Hitchcock and three generations of Du Mauriers is evidence of the Hollywood director’s abiding English roots and inspiration.",

        "text": "1The purpose of the present article is threefold. It will focus first and foremost on the three film adaptations which Hitchcock did of two novels and a short story by Daphne Du Maurier: Jamaica Inn (1939), his last film in England before he took up Selznick’s invitation to come to Hollywood; Rebecca (1940), the first film he shot in the United States under Selznick’s close supervision; and The Birds (1963), made much later when Hitchcock was at the height of his Hollywood career.\n\n2The choice of these three films is self-evident. While the great majority of Hitchcock-directed films are based on pre-existing plays and/or novels or short stories, few of them can be described as “prestige” adaptations of recognized writers, the most obvious exception being Juno and the Paycock (1930), a rendition of the play by Sean O’Casey that is not rated very high in the Hitchcock canon. That Hitchcock chose to make films based on Joseph Conrad’s Secret Agent (Sabotage, 1936) and, more loosely, on John Buchan’s The Thirty-Nine Steps (1935), owes less to their sources’ literary qualities than to their suspenseful plots. The remark probably also applies to the three Du Maurier-based films, a unique instance in Hitchcock’s fifty-year-long career of his adapting to the screen three pieces of fiction by the same writer.\n\n3Part of the motivation was certainly due to Du Maurier’s status as a best-selling novelist, a status shared by two other women writers whose works fuelled Hitchcock’s inspiration: Marie Belloc Lowndes, the author of The Lodger (1913), the source of Hitchcock’s film of 1926-27, and much later Patricia Highsmith, whose Strangers on a Train was turned into another highly regarded Hitchcock film in 1950-51. The traditional, often predictable or pedantic, exercise of comparison between the novel and the book is nevertheless usually instructive, both because it sheds light on the specific qualities and shortcomings of the respective forms of expression, and because it reveals the frequent misunderstanding between writer and filmmaker. In most cases the film director, especially a “popular” director aiming at a mass audience like Hitchcock, feels that with the adaptation rights he has bought a popular piece of “property”, a popular title, possibly a clever plot, and that he has also acquired the “right” to make any changes, deletions, additions and modulations he sees fit to introduce in order to make the film more “visual” and attractive. The writer, for his or her part, while happy with the financial benefit of the rights, expects the filmmaker to be respectful of the original work, and is often dissatisfied with the result. As we shall see, this was the case with Du Maurier’s reaction to two of the three adaptations of her work by Hitchcock.\n\nThe Three Film Adaptations\n\nRebecca\n\nJamaica Inn\n\n10The substitution of Pengallan – an entirely new character except in his function as the mastermind behind the gang of wreckers and smugglers – for Francis Davey entailed much reshuffling of the plot and the invention of new characters or situations around the flamboyant squire. Of the main characters besides Mary, only Uncle Joss Merlyn and his wife Aunt Patience are relatively unchanged, while some of the smugglers are recognizable from the novel. “Jem” retains his first name and his role as Mary’s love interest, but instead of being a romantic rogue and horse thief who eventually betrays his elder brother Joss to the authorities, he becomes Jem Trehearne, a navy officer and government spy who has infiltrated the gang and is unrelated to Joss. At the end of the film, Pengallan takes Mary hostage and plans to escape to the continent with her. Though the incident is really featured in the novel, the setting has been moved from Bodmin Moor and its strange rock formations, reminiscent of Wuthering Heights, to the deck of a ship. From the shrouds Pengallan throws down his pistol and shouts, “What are you all waiting for? A spectacle? You shall have it! And tell your children how the great age ended. Make way for Pengallan!” before plunging to his death. In this particular case it is tempting to conclude that Hitchcock was in agreement with, or responsible for, the more dramatically spectacular setting, a setting more in accordance with Laughton’s histrionics.\n\n24 Maurice Yacowar, Hitchcock’s British Films [1977], Detroit: Wayne State UP, 2010, 254.\n\n[Jamaica Inn] was made at a time when British films were not very good, and exterior shots would have helped—particularly if they had been taken on Bodmin Moor. I thought that the opening scenes captured the flavour of the story but the elimination of the albino parson and the disproportionate role of the squire proved to the detriment of the film as a whole. . . . I thought that Leslie Banks (Joss) was good, and the rest of the cast adequate.\n\nThe Birds\n\n13From Du Maurier’s short story, Hitchcock retained essentially two elements: the gradual mounting of tension due to the increasing violence of the birds’ attacks, a pattern which fits in with the preoccupations of the master of suspense; and the apparent lack of explanation for these attacks, one of the story’s strongest points. Other retained elements include the focus on a nuclear family whose cottage is stormed by the birds; the deliberate and organized nature of the birds’ onslaughts and the fact that these come in waves, with lulls in between; the fact that different species coordinate their actions; the suicide attacks, the attack via the chimney, the birds going for the eyes and almost silently invading the children’s bedroom; the children running across the field; the presence of a telephone booth, whose dramatic function is heightened in the picture; and the neighbours—farmers and postman—found slaughtered. Conversely, as a logical consequence of the story’s relocation to California, what is not retained is the initial link established between the sudden cold spell of “black winter” and the birds’ odd behaviour, the obvious parallel with the Blitz, the topical references to World War II and to the Cold War, the general feeling that the birds are attacking all over the country, perhaps all over Europe.\n\nThe Other Two Du Mauriers: Gerald and George\n\nSir Gerald Du Maurier\n\n38 Sidney Gottlieb, op. cit., 91.\n\nCooper has that rare faculty of being able to rivet the attention of an audience while doing nothing. In this respect he is very much like the late Gerald Du Maurier, who could walk on a stage, flick a speck of dust off his shoulder, study his fingernails for a whole five minutes, and do it all so dramatically and with such accurate timing that he held an audience spellbound.\n\n20Visually the film is fairly pedestrian, with only a few shots which may be described as Hitchcock touches: the opening shot of a long kiss which will be repeated with variations in several of Hitchcock’s Hollywood movies, including Notorious and Dial M for Murder; a side view of a line of chorus girls from backstage, recalling Hitchcock’s constant interest in the insider’s view of the music hall and other theatricals; and Lady Camber falling flat on her face, toward the spectator.\n\nGeorge Du Maurier\n\n24One may also suggest that the Hitchcock film that is today almost universally regarded as the director’s masterpiece, i.e. Vertigo, is thematically linked to both Du Maurier’s novels. Beyond the Boileau-Narcejac material that is its ostensible source (D’entre les morts), it has long been known that the plot of Vertigo is a modern transposition (and complication) of Georges Rodenbach’s novel Bruges-la-Morte (1892) from late nineteenth-century Bruges to mid-1950s San Francisco. In both narratives a man who has lost the beautiful woman he loved finds another woman who, although more vulgar, looks very much like the first. He endeavours to make the resemblance complete, with tragic consequences. This tragic variation on, and reversal of, the Pygmalion theme, in which Galatea dies instead of coming to life, is also the core of Du Maurier’s Trilby: around 1850, a young Irish model in Bohemian Paris is loved by a trio of British painters. Although she has no musical training and is tone-deaf, Trilby has a beautiful natural voice and can sing in an extraordinary fashion under the hypnotic control of Svengali, an evil character who is also a musical genius. The strain on Trilby eventually proves too much and she dies.\n\n25To return to Vertigo, if we put aside the film’s elaborate plot of crime and deception, we are left with the sublime and oneiric illusion of Madeleine as a reincarnation of Carlotta, with a love affair that transcends the limitations of time and place, and with a variation on the theme of amour fou comparable to that which we find in a handful of movies, such as The Portrait of Jennie and Pandora and the Flying Dutchman, or indeed in Du Maurier’s Peter Ibbetson. While Trilby is a remarkable and very personal variation on the Pygmalion motif, uniting as it does the pictorial (plastic) model and the musical, set against the familiar backdrop of Bohemian Paris in the mid-19th century, Peter Ibbetson is more original, indeed uncanny. It combines both the ancient belief in reincarnation and the idea that “love is stronger than death” with contemporary theories—like Darwinism, antenatal memories, or the subconscious—and technological intuitions, like the dawning realisation that both sounds and pictures could be recorded and broadcast not just across space, but also across time. In several passages Du Maurier, writing in 1891, i.e. just before the “official” birthdate of cinema (1895), appears to view the human brain as a sort of laterna magica and/or camera obscura which fulfils the same duties as Edison’s various inventions and allows for a form of telepathic communication between such kindred spirits as Peter Ibbetson and the Duchess of Towers.\n\n28Let us conclude on an onomastic remark. In George Du Maurier’s Peter Ibbetson the hero’s cousin and literary executrix is called Madge Plunket. In Daphne Du Maurier’s short story “The Apple Tree”, from the same collection as “The Birds”, the (implicit) narrator’s recently deceased wife’s name is Midge. In Hitchcock’s Vertigo Scottie’s sensible old friend and confidante (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) is also called Midge. We naturally realize that both “Madge” and “Midge” are familiar diminutives of “Margaret.” Nevertheless it is worth remarking that in all three cases a similar strategy is at work: a commonplace diminutive refers to an “ordinary” character placed in an overall “extraordinary” narrative, acting as a foil to its haunted, visionary, perhaps demented, hero."
