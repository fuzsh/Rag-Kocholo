        "text": "London, 16 January 2020: Jamaica Inn is delighted to announce the launch of a James Bond package to coincide with the release of the eagerly anticipated Bond film, No Time To Die on 03 April 2020.\n\nBased on the acclaimed novels by Ian Fleming, this 25th installment of the franchise was partially filmed in Jamaica, paying homage to Fleming’s love of the island.\n\nJamaica Inn has long been associated with Ian Fleming, and the Morrow family (who have owned the hotel for over 60 years) maintained a close personal relationship with the famed writer throughout the 1950s. The family are still in possession of telegrams from Fleming to Mrs. Morrow thanking the hotel for their kind hospitality and arranging his next visit to the hotel. Not to mention, Jamaica Inn features within the first Bond book Dr. No, with Fleming writing that Jamaica Inn’s bar is the place to be seen on the island.\n\nGuests will be invited to exclusive outdoor cinema screenings of iconic Bond films with Jamaica Inn’s very own 700-foot private white sand beach in the background. The screenings will be embellished with expertly made martinis – “shaken not stirred” – originally crafted at the hotel’s main bar, rumoured to be the very spot Ian Fleming first coined the phrase for his novels. Guests can also enjoy an interactive martini making class, so budding mixologists can learn to make their own perfect serve of the cocktail.\n\nDuring the day, guests will be encouraged to experience a tailor-made tour of Jamaica, highlighting the sites where past Bond blockbusters have been filmed. Locations include Reynolds Pier and Green Grotto (both featured in Dr No.) as well as Rose Hall Great House and Swamp Safari, which appeared in Live and Let Die.\n\nAfter a morning of cinematic exploration, guests are invited to relax at Jamaica Inn’s award winning Ocean Spa for a bespoke ‘Live and Unwind’ treatment. Housed in a collection of rustic thatch-roofed huts surrounded by tropical gardens, the Ocean Spa showcases breathtaking sea views, allowing guests to enjoy a tranquil experience set to the sound of waves and soothed by constant sea breezes."
