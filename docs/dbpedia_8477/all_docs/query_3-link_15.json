        "text": "As his parting gift to the nation of Britain, Alfred Hitchcock imparted to his homeland one of the most sanctified opening title credits of all time: “Introducing Maureen O’Hara.”\n\nIt’s only unfortunate that the blessing comes at the expense of a blown raspberry: “Jamaica Inn.”\n\nHitchcock’s final British film is a provincial affair reminiscent, though lesser than, some of his countryside-set silents such as “Manxman” and “The Farmer’s Wife.” It might, actually, be lesser even that some of the director’s messiest early films, including “Juno and the Paycock” and “Champagne.” At least those have the excuse that Hitchcock was still discovering himself as a director. By the time of “Jamaica,” he should have known better.\n\nThe film stars O’Hara as…\n\nAction! - The Master & The Fan: Hitchcock's Bumping Road To Mastering Suspense\n\nHitchcock's next picture shifts his formula to a period drama in which pirates seemingly continue to wreak fear. There are also affluent males that want to gain greater power. And you have a protagonist battling for what is rightfully hers.\n\nLaughton never disappoints as this man whose appetite for power and mayhem is perhaps equal to his food hunger. The theatricality he occasionally injects into his role is what makes him such a good villain. O'Hara, in her first major screen role, plays this lady who is caught up in all of this turmoil and must not only keep what belongs to her, but also her life.\n\nUnfortunately,…\n\nCharles Laughton's eyebrows have a lifestyle to maintain and don't care how many sailors die to maintain it.\n\nSome of the reviews on here are a bit extreme, 1 stars, worst film I ever saw stuff. After an exciting boat crash/massacre opening it's a bit dull and overripe but you don't have to venture far into 1930s adventure films to find worse fair. You can kind of feel the movie veering off course and into Laughton's gravitational pull, my wife has read the book and didn't even remember Laughton's character so there's a fair amount of rewriting going on, but Laughton would be having that effect on films and directors for decades to come after this and he's certainly more…\n\nJamaica Inn (1939), Alfred Hitchcock's last film done in Britain before continuing an extremely successful career in the States. Many dislike Jamaica Inn because it's been established that the director lacked full control, and therefore considered a routine job to fulfill his contractual obligations in the UK instead of a true Hitchcock picture. But I loved this for it's true vision. The vision of character actor Charles Laughton!\n\nThis is a dark and violent tale with plenty of playful suspense, so it's not like Hitchcock's presence wasn't felt. I think many take Hitchcock's own disappointed feelings into account as to the enjoyment of Jamaica Inn. This is a lovely adventure movie with lots of little tongue in cheek tidbits and…\n\nAfter directing a string of exciting thrillers in the mid to late thirties, Alfred Hitchcock then directed this melodrama about a bunch of ship wreckers on the Cornish coast. Jamaica Inn, Hitchcock's last film in the UK before heading across the pond, gets off to a good start with an exciting ship wrecking sequence. The special effects are quite obvious but they have a real dreamy surreal vibe to them. However, the film then settles down into a rather dry story arc, as a young woman going to stay with her aunt discovers the ship wrecking ring at the titular location. The main problem is that it lacks suspense for the most part and there aren't a great deal of…\n\nNo one's favorite Hitchcock, a flat period drama probably best known for being Maureen O'Hara's breakout role and the first of three Daphne du Maurier adaptations Hitchcock would direct. Mary travels from her native Ireland to England after the death of her mother to be reunited with her aunt at the notorious Jamaica Inn. It serves as the headquarters for a rough gang responsible for a series of shipwrecks just off their shore.\n\nThey have a routine of covering the seaside lantern meant to warn off approaching ships. When it crashes, they kill all of those aboard and steal their cargo. Mary's put-upon aunt Patience is married to the gang's apparent leader Joss. Mary makes the trek by coach but…\n\nAlfred Hitchcock didn't like it. I didn't like it. Watching Jamaica Inn was rather like going back to his pre-The 39 Steps crime melodramas. With a muddled tone, long scenes of boredom, and little of Hitchcock's visual flair on show, it's almost as if he couldn't stop himself from regressing into bad habits.\n\nBased on the Daphne Du Maurier (she didn't like it either) story, it sees Maureen O'Hara arrive at the titular inn via peculiarly pompous squire Charles Laughton (also producing and, according to reports, interfering) and stumbles on a group of criminals who are deliberately causing ships to wreck on the coast and plundering their loot.\n\nAccording to some accounts, Laughton really faffed Hitchcock around on this, insisting…\n\nBefore departing to begin his successful career stride over at America that would last for four more decades of history-changing cinematic landmarks, Alfred Hitchcock still had one more left in him – or more like a one yet to settle contractually obligated production – during his Britain run that came in the form of Jamaica Inn, a huge contender for the director’s weirdest most peculiar non-Hitchcock films of his filmography. At the same time that claim that sounds pretty wrong given how this is still very much a top to bottom filled with all of Hitchcock’s motifs and signatures.\n\nFor starters, this was actually the first of Daphne du Maurier’s stories that Hitchcock would adapt prior to Rebecca and The…"
