        "text": "Major 1939 events signalled the coming of the Second World War. The interwar period represented an era of significant global changes. A brief term of economic prosperity lifted the middle class during the 1920s and such indulgence subsequently led to the Great Depression.

Shortly after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a treaty of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Germany, the Germans invaded Poland on the 1st September. The campaign ended over a month later on the 6th October when Germany and the Soviet Union divided the country under the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty.\n\nPrior to the invasion, the Gleiwitz incident on the 31st August supposedly occurred with the intention of creating an appearance of Polish aggression towards Germany. Covert Nazi Germans posed as Polish Nationals as they attacked a German radio station, with the aim of justifying the invasion of Poland the next day.\n\nInterestingly, the invasion would have started on the 26th of August, with the advantage of surprising Polish forces, however this was avoided when Hitler’s close ally Mussolini declared that Italy was not prepared for war and Britain declared a military alliance with Poland.\n\nAfter being given Mussolini’s political support, Hitler dismissed the Poland-Britain allegiance as an ‘empty gesture’ and invaded Poland on the 1st September. As the invasion progressed, the Polish forces withdrew their forward bases near the Polish-German border, and were defeated in the Battle of Bzura giving the Germans an advantage. Poland received limited aid from allies France and Britain, and on the 17th September the Soviet Red Army invaded Eastern Poland in the Sphere of Influence. Following a defeat at the Battle of Kock on the 6th October, German and Soviet forces gained full control over Poland.\n\nBritain Goes to War\n\nFollowing the events of World War One, negotiations began between the ‘Big Four’ (Britain, France, Italy and the United States) regarding post-war Europe. The German and Austro-Hungarian Empire were excluded from the negotiations while a treaty was formed.\n\nIn June 1919 the Allies declared that war would resume if the German government did not sign the treaty that had been created. After refusing at first, an ultimatum was given by the Allies threatening immediate war once again, and the German government agreed to sign.\n\nIn 1933 Hitler was appointed Chancellor of the Reich and began to annex and seize its surrounding countries in an attempt to create Lebensraum or ‘living space’ for Germany, despite this breaking the rules of the aforementioned treaty.\n\nObserving this, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed to declare war on Germany if Poland was threatened. Two days after the invasion of Poland began, Britain and France followed suit and declared war against Germany. However, so little practical aid and assistance was given to Poland when Germany invaded on the 1st September that when Britain and France did declare war it was initially named the ‘Phoney War’. Furthering this, neither country ever declared war upon the Soviet Union, despite their invasion of Poland on the 17th September.\n\nThe news of the war was given by Neville Chamberlain, who spoke on behalf of both the United Kingdom and France.\n\nIn his speech, Chamberlain described the Polish invasion a ‘bitter blow’ after a long struggle for peace following the First World War. Chamberlain stated that ‘we have done all that any country could to establish peace’ and that the country would need to play their part with ‘calmness and courage’."
