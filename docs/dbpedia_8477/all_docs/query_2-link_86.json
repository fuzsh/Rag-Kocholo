        "text": "The original charter of North Carolina Central University issued by the General Assembly of North Carolina in 1925 (Chapter 56, Private Laws, 1925) set forth an institutional purpose that included the training of Negro high school teachers and principals. By 1927, the institution had in place sets of \"combination courses\" specially designed for high school teachers (English and French or Latin, English and History, History and French or Latin, Mathematics and Science, Mathematics and History, and History and Science).\n\nIn 1928–1929, the Department of Education became one of the units of the College of Liberal Arts, and it offered six courses in professional education—expanding to 20 courses by 1937. In 1939, the General Assembly enacted a statute that authorized the Board of Trustees at North Carolina College to establish graduate programs. Majors included the Master of Arts degree in Administration, in Secondary Education, and in Elementary Education. In 1952, the first PhD program was offered in Administration and Supervision, Elementary Education, and Guidance. Five graduates were awarded the PhD degree before the program was discontinued in 1964.\n\nThe Master of Education degree in Graduate Elementary Education was established in 1954, replacing the Master of Arts degree that was established in 1939. The Sixth-Year Program leading to the Advanced Principal’s Certificate was established in 1960 but discontinued in 1972.\n\nThe mission of North Carolina Central University's School of Education is to prepare candidates to assume socially responsible positions that advance the general welfare of North Carolina people. The university is committed to serving its historical population of African American students as well as an increasingly diverse clientele. The School of Education's conceptual framework, \"Preparing Educators for Diverse Cultural Contexts,\" undergirds the school's curriculum and represents the faculty's commitment to preparing teachers to teach children from all racial, cultural, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds. The program is also designed to engender in graduates the ability to see the social and political implications of their actions and the social contexts in which they are carried out. This paradigm further supports the notion that graduates use their skills and knowledge to promote greater equality, justice, and humane conditions in schooling and society.\n\nOur mission applies to all professional education programs at the University, including those housed in the College of Arts and Sciences. The \"unit\" is considered to be all professional education programs, with the unit head being the dean of the School of Education. As such, the School of Education is the academic unit responsible for all NCCU teacher education programs.\n\nThe first “real” home for the Department of Education was the Taylor Building, which was named for Dr. James T. Taylor, a faculty member of 33 years. The Taylor building was dedicated on November 6, 1970—Founder’s Day. This three-story building also housed the Departments of Geography and Psychology. The darkroom production studio, conference room, lounge, auditorium, and offices were located on the first floor. The second floor had classrooms only. The third floor housed the Departments of Geography and Psychology.\n\nThe School of Education moved into its present facility in August of 2000. It was named in honor of the Honorable Representative H. M. Michaux, Jr., of the North Carolina House of Representatives and was dedicated on June 15, 2007. The 109,000 square foot state-of-the-art building has full wireless capability and contains the following resources:\n\nA teleconference classroom\n\n17 classrooms, a 350-seat auditorium, 8 conference rooms, 6 workrooms, and a student and faculty lounge\n\nDean’s suite with 9 offices for administrative use\n\n35 faculty offices and 4 offices for adjunct faculty and graduate assistants\n\nA technology wing that includes 5 faculty offices, a digital video editing lab, and one Mac lab\n\nOne computer lab on the first floor in the classroom wing\n\nOne Praxis suite\n\nA modern curriculum and materials center\n\nA speech and hearing wing with 11 faculty and clinician offices, 15 therapy rooms, 2 group therapy rooms, 1 graduate student workroom, an audiology testing suite\n\nA communication lab and a client waiting area"
