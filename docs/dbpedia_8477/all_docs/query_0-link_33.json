        "text": "As a movie team, Maureen O’Hara and Charles Laughton collaborated in many more ways than their three appearances together in the following films would imply:\n\nJamaica Inn (1939)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)\n\nThis Land Is Mine (1943)\n\nCharles Laughton, an accomplished actor in films and on stage, as well as a noted director and producer for theater, first noticed Ms. O’Hara when she was still Ms. FitzSimons in a screen test she did for a London studio. She was 17 years old at the time. Although the screen test was only passable, Mr. Laughton saw promise in the expressiveness of her eyes, an expressiveness complemented later in her movie career by the advent and widespread use of Technicolor. Mr. Laughton recommended she be given a chance in a small role in Kicking the Moon Around (1938) (a.k.a. The Playboy or Millionaire Merry-Go-Round), a film that showcased the singing talent of Evelyn Dall. That same year, Charles Laughton also helped Ms. FitzSimons secure the role of friend and protector for the titular character in My Irish Molly (1938).\n\nHe further promoted Ms. FitzSimons career when, the following year, he was tapped to play the sinister lead in Alfred Hitchcock’s Jamaica Inn. Owing to his recommendation, Ms. FitzSimons was summoned to play the ingenue opposite Mr. Laughton. It was Mr. Laughton, along with fellow producer Erich Pommer, who then also recommended Ms. FitzSimons change her name to something shorter, something that would easily fit on a theater marquee, something very important in those days to one’s movie career. As the story goes, Charles Laughton suggested either Ida Maureen O’Mara or Maureen O’Hara. When Ms. FitzSimons complained that she liked her name and would like to keep it, Mr. Laughton is reported to have said: “Very Well, you’re Maureen O’Hara.”"
