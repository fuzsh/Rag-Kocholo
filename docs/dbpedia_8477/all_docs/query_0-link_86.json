        "text": "There is a moment in John Carpenter’s “The Fog” (1980) when the character of Father Malone (Hal Holbrook) reveals the film’s theme. Yes, themes in horror movies are rarities. Most of them are wall-to-wall ketchup. The Irish surname Malone and his collar seem to label both him and his grandfather as Catholic priests, and they have vows of chastity to follow, which makes the finding of his grandfather’s diary odd. The Malone bloodline should have ended with his grandfather. Did the screenwriters forget this? Catholic priests can have illegitimate children, but it would be unusual. Father Malone says that he must pay for the orchestrated murders that his grandfather and the other conspirators in the sleepy seaside town of Antonio Bay perpetrated against wealthy leader Blake and his leper companions on their clipper ship in 1880.\n\nThe theme is inherited guilt and, in particular, how the treatment of Native Americans and the slave trade still trouble the American psyche. But are we guilty of what our ancestors did? Do we carry a moral stain within us because of their actions? It’s something Jews have dealt with for two thousand years over the crucifixion of Jesus. In Mel Gibson’s 2004 film “The Passion of the Christ,” the controversial line from the Gospel of Matthew was included where the Jewish High Priest Caiaphas says that Christ’s blood is “on us, and on our children.” A powerful and damning line written by a Christian set the stage for the persecution Jews suffered from then on, leading to the Holocaust. That’s another case of inherited guilt that Germans are dealing with to this day. Then there is the slave trade. A black person once told me that because I am white, I bear some responsibility for slavery. I pointed out that everyone involved in the slave trade is long gone, and whatever crimes they committed during their lifetime died with them. But, no, this person wouldn’t accept that and wanted to keep the righteous indignation going, ignoring the fact that I’m genetically 100% Irish and that Ireland played no part in the slave trade. None. White people are not all the same, and things are not as simple as they seem on the surface. The statement revealed more about the person speaking it and their attitude to whites instead of the unfair and untrue condemnation of me that they intended it to be. It’s so much easier to blame others for our problems than to accept personal responsibility for our own lives.\n\nJohn Carpenter said he got the idea for The Fog while visiting Stonehenge in England with his then-girlfriend, the late Debra Hill. They saw a fog that appeared to glow and pulsate. She asked Carpenter what he thought was in that fog. “Ghosts,” he replied. (Hill and Carpenter would go on to write the screenplay for “The Fog.”)\n\nIn the plays of William Shakespeare, ghosts usually only appear after a murder occurs. The restless spirit either wants to inform an innocent party of what has happened to them (e.g., Hamlet’s father) or to drive the perpetrators mad with guilt and terror (the banquet scene in “Macbeth”). In “The Fog,” the ghosts of Blake and his men do both. By dropping a huge brick from the church walls on Father Malone’s desk during the witching hour sequence at the start, the spirits inform him of a dark family secret of which he was previously unaware. With his pious values shaken to their core after the diary’s discovery in the walls, Malone becomes slightly unhinged, withdrawing into an alcoholic stupor for the rest of the picture before his fate gets sealed in the film’s coda. (Uncorking a bottle of wine is the first thing we see Father Malone do in the movie before any revelations happen. He even tries to tempt Bennett, the caretaker, a young John Carpenter in a rare acting role, into joining him in a nightcap, but Bennett declines the priest’s offer of a drink. Later, Father Malone’s continual alcohol dependence as a coping mechanism suggests he has a drinking problem. You could argue that The Fog and the Carpenter-produced Halloween III both suffer from the portrayals of Irish-Americans as drunks, an unwelcome, stereotypical trope.)\n\n“The Fog” seems to put a supernatural twist to the plot of Hitchcock’s “Jamaica Inn.” In “The Fog,” the original Father Malone and his co-conspirators set false fires on the shore to make the leper colony ship crash on the rocks, killing everyone on board and leaving Blake’s gold open for plundering. Hitchcock’s “Jamaica Inn” (1939) is an adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s novel about a smuggling gang luring ships to their doom on the coast of Cornwall in England. (Hitchcock would also adapt du Maurier’s “Rebecca” and “The Birds.” Interestingly, Bodega Bay, California was the shooting location for “The Birds” and “The Fog”) Janet Leigh from Hitchcock’s “Psycho” even makes an appearance in “The Fog” on the 20th anniversary of her infamous shower scene.\n\nCarpenter then seemed to take inspiration from two Clint Eastwood movies (Carpenter is a big Clint fan, hence Kurt Russell coming across as The Man With No Name’s kid brother in “Escape from New York” (1981) and “Escape from L.A.” (1996)). He took the “karmic-ghost-returning-from-the-grave-to-punish-a-community-for-their-moral-weakness-and-complicity-in-his-death” trope from Eastwood’s “High Plains Drifter.” (Wes Craven’s “A Nightmare On Elm Street” also used that plot device.) Then Carpenter made the DJ-in-peril storyline from Clint’s “Play Misty For Me” the subplot for the character of Stevie Wayne (Adrienne Barbeau, Carpenter’s then-wife) who serves as a kind of narrator and moral centre of “The Fog” in her coastal lighthouse radio station.\n\nThe first cut of “The Fog” didn’t test well with audiences, and Carpenter decided to bring everyone back for reshoots, which seemed to go down better with the public. Critics never seemed to like “The Fog”, some of them questioning the scene where a corpse with no eyes gets up from a mortuary slab and walks across the room towards Jamie Lee Curtis only to collapse before it reaches her. They thought it was pointless and that the characters acted like idiots (we won’t even mention a hitchhiking Jamie Lee Curtis letting herself get picked up by a random male and sleeping with him immediately before even telling him her name!)\n\nTom Atkins is solid as always in the lead role of Nick Castle, and Carpenter and his superb cinematographer Dean Cundey make the low-budget effects look way better than they could have ended up. (Indeed Atkins, Cundey, and Stonehenge itself would make another appearance in the Carpenter-produced “Halloween III: Season of the Witch.”)\n\nDespite its flaws, “The Fog” worked on the level of a chilling short story that stays with you. Compared to the 2005 remake, which was beyond awful, the original now looks like a masterpiece.\n\n© Stewart Stafford, 2020.
