        "text": "Looking for some travel advice from movie stars? If a trip to Jamaica is on your radar, as it has been for many filmmakers and authors, then Kristen Bell and Kelsey Grammer might be good people to ask. Word is they filmed a new Netflix movie “Like Father” on location in September at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, where they were also provided accommodations. “Like Father,” scheduled for release in 2018, is about a workaholic woman stood up on her wedding day. As a result, she takes what was meant to be her honeymoon trip with her estranged, workaholic father, instead.\n\nThe script was written by Lauren Miller Roger (Seth Rogen’s wife) who is making her directorial debut.\n\nBell starred in “Couples Retreat,” shot in Bora Bora, another island paradise; and, conversely, was the voice of Princess Anna in Disney’s “Frozen.”\n\nGrammer starred on television’s “Cheers” and “Frasier.”\n\nJamaica Inn has also been the scene for additional movies, including “Sea Wife” in 1957 starring Joan Collins and Richard Burton and 1997’s Bill Murray comedy “The Man Who Knew Too Little.”\n\nJamaica Inn is now offering a behind-the-scenes tour provided by “Jamaica Land of Film” to see movie locations, learn insider motion picture details, take photos and, of course, stay at the inn…maybe in the same room in which one of the movie stars stayed. The tour covers 15 movies with seven stops.\n\nIt’s not unusual for novels and films to be set in Jamaica. 007 James Bond immediately comes to mind with Sean Connery in “Dr. No,” and, later, Roger Moore as the superspy in “Live and Let Die.” (Ursula Andress and Jane Seymour, respectively, were the “Bond girls” in those films. Ian Fleming, the British author of the 007 novels, penned them in Jamaica at “Goldeneye,” his getaway home, which is now a resort. (Ian Fleming International Airport, just outside Ocho Rios, is named for him.) Fleming also stayed at Jamaica Inn as did Marilyn Monroe and Kathryn Hepburn.\n\nThere are plenty of films to cover across Jamaica, including the Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman prison movie “Papillon.”\n\nTom Cruise juggled shakers and served drinks at a Jamaican resort as a playboy bartender “Cocktail.”\n\n“Cool Runnings” was the true story of the Jamaican bobsled team; and “How Stella Got Her Groove Back;” “Legends of the Fall;” and “Knight and Day” shot scenes in Jamaica.\n\nJamaica Inn’s “Cinephile Experience Package,” starting at $2,250, includes:\n\nClub MoBay VIP movie star arrival in the lounge.\n\nAccommodations in a deluxe verandah suite with an ocean view.\n\nA souvenir “Jamaica Movie Locations” book to study up.\n\nThe private guide tour with expert commentary to seven different sites where 15 movies where filmed.\n\nMoonlight massage in the twilight of a Jamaican evening at the inn’s Ocean Spa after the tour.\n\nJamaica Inn’s property covers eight acres on a private cove with an offshore reef two miles east of the town center. A 700-foot private, white sand beach is a highlight of the family-owned resort, which opened in 1958."
