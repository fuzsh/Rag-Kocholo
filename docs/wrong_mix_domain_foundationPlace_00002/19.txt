We believe in the transformative power of free open source software. It enables anyone to innovate, regardless of budget. As more people actively collaborate on open source projects, the number and quality of free software tools continues to increase, helping to spur even faster advancements across all industries, including health sciences, banking, manufacturing, and technology.

For more than two decades, OpenLogic has delivered expert open source support and enterprise services to global organizations. Originally founded as OpenLogic in 1998, the company was purchased in 2013 by Rogue Wave Software, a top provider of cross-platform software development tools and high-performance computing applications.

In 2019, Rogue Wave became a part of Perforce Software, a global leader in development lifecycle, version control, and code analysis software. By acquiring OpenLogic and the rest of the Rogue Wave product family, Perforce gives customers a more comprehensive suite of services and technologies, so that they can transform opportunities and challenges into powerful digital solutions.
