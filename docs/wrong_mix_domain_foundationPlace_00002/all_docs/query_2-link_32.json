And today, more than 80% of web applications are written in PHP.\n\nTo help drive web and mobile innovation, we deliver the enterprise PHP tools and services organizations need to meet their requirements, including accelerated deployment cycles, quality user experiences, and reduced costs. We also help companies that still run legacy platforms such as IBM i, build modern solutions using PHP.\n\nFor nearly two decades, we have helped evolve the PHP language and how it is used by global leaders. Here is a snapshot of our historical milestones:\n\nNew Logo, Same Zend\n\nWe redesigned the Zend logo to modernize our brand identity and reinforce our commitment to staying at the forefront of the fast-evolving PHP landscape. This updated logo enables us to better connect with our customers while maintaining the familiarity of the Zend name. Industry leaders trust Zend with their PHP needs, and this fresh new look reflects the forward-looking approach we take to supporting and championing our customers, partners, and the greater PHP community."
