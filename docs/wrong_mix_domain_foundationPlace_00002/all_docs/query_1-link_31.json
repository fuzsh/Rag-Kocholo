        "text": "Rogue Wave tools span 40 years, offering everything from cloud-based-services to native platform applications to portable software libraries. But they all have a common, singular purpose: Making it easy to write, test, and run complex code.\n\nOur capabilities cover different languages, code bases, and platforms. Simply put, we meet development where – and how – it happens. Whether it's finding the right algorithm to forecast outcomes, building the foundation of C++ applications, debugging multi-threaded and multi-core software, understanding open source use in proprietary code, or discovering security bugs earlier in development, we can help. Code is where we live, what we care about, and how we make our customers' software better.\n\nHostAccess\n\nHostAccess® offers a suite of terminal emulation products that provide Windows™ users with secure access to legacy, host-based applications. HostAccess also has the ability to enhance the interface of existing applications with toolbars, mouse support, push buttons, combo boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, ActiveX™ controls, COM objects, and includes the powerful AutoGUI feature.\n\nThe benefits of using HostAccess for terminal emulation include:\n\nIncreased user productivity by providing the ability to perform multiple tasks\n\nStandardization on one terminal emulation solution\n\nPoint-and-click report production and host data integration with Windows™ applications\n\nMultiple concurrent connections within one integrated environment\n\nReduced software administration time and costs\n\nHostAccess terminal emulation includes asynchronous/synchronous connections, server-based administration, concurrent users, and multiple session access, all in a single package.\n\nTechnical functionality includes:\n\nSupport of over 30 different terminal emulations, including IBM 3270, DEC VT series, Wyse 50/60, SCO ANSI, Data General DG216, MDIS Prism 8/9\n\nSupport of Windows XP/Server 2003/Server 2003 R2/Windows 7/Server 2008/ Server 2008 R2, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 platforms\n\nSupport for SSH & SSL secure network protocols\n\nSupport for Rocket Software UniVerse™ and UniData™ Device licensing\n\nSupport of FTP, Kermit, X/Y/Z modem, Inter-session and IND$FILE file transfer protocols\n\nGraphical keyboard mapping\n\nFull GUI capabilities\n\nFully-integrated macro language\n\nHydraExpress\n\nHydraExpress™ provides a framework for developing and hosting high performance C++ web services, including advanced XML, SOAP, and WSDL. HydraExpress provides productivity tools for transforming new and existing C++ applications for use in service oriented architectures (SOA).\n\nHydraExpress leverages crucial business logic locked within existing applications. HydraExpress enables you to create SOA applications that are flexible and interoperable - yet maintain the reliability and performance advantages of your core business logic.\n\nMessage formats in HydraExpress are based on the simple object access protocol (SOAP), a widely accepted, easy-to-use mechanism for transferring messages over a network.\n\nHydraExpress developers simply supply a standard web services description language (WSDL) file and HydraExpress automatically generates a skeleton service that handles the details of protocols, standards, and networking to ensure interoperability. Developers then drop in new or existing C++ business logic to create a ready-to-deploy service that can be used in many types of SOA applications."
