SKELOS, CO-CHAIRMAN, 2 LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE ON DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH AND 3 REAPPORTIONMENT: Good morning. I would like to 4 welcome you to our second hearing of the Legislative 5 Task Force on Demographic Research and 6 Reapportionment, and this is the second of 11 7 hearings that we'll be holding throughout the state. 8 Yesterday, we were in Syracuse. My 9 name is Dean Skelos; I'm a State Senator and Co-Chair 10 of the Task Force. And with me today are my 11 Co-Chair, Assemblyman Bill Parment; on my right is 12 Senator Richard Dollinger; Assemblyman Chris Ortloff; 13 Vincent Bruy; and I believe Roman Hedges is on his 14 way. 15 As I mentioned yesterday, the purpose 16 of these hearings is to obtain input from you, the 17 citizens of the State, on the redistricting process 18 which will impact, as you know, all of our 19 Congressional State Senate and Assembly seats 20 throughout the State. 21 As you know also, the Task Force has 22 the obligation to meet the obligations of the U.S. 23 Constitution, one person/one vote, the State 24 Constitution, Federal laws, Court decisions; numerous 25 factors go into redistricting, including the 0006 1 recommendations that you are going to make. 2 I know that some people here feel very 3 strongly about how the line should be drawn. I know 4 that people feel very strongly about who their 5 representatives should be; and that is your right to 6 feel that way. I just want to point out that today 7 is more towards how lines will be drawn, as it is who 8 your representative will be until the next 9 redistricting is completed.. 10 So, I would ask if we can maintain 11 testimony of five minutes. We have many, many 12 speeches today, and we want to make sure that 13 everybody has the opportunity to say their piece. 14 So, if we could keep it to five minutes; and, again, 15 it concerns how the District lines should be drawn, 16 as against who necessarily the representative of that 17 District is. 18 So, Bill, would you like to say 19 anything? 20 ASSEMBLYMAN WILLIAM L. PARMENT, 21 CO-CHAIRMAN, LEGISLATIVE TASK FORCE ON DEMOGRAPHIC 22 RESEARCH AND REAPPORTIONMENT: Yes. Thank you, 23 Senator. Welcome to this hearing. I think the 24 Senator has outlined quite well the purpose of our 25 hearing. We look forward to hearing your testimony. 0007 1 We have yet to put a pen to paper in an 2 effort to draw lines. It isn't that we haven't begun 3 drawing lines; it's that we first want to hear from 4 the public and groups of individuals across the State 5 about their desires for their associations with 6 neighboring communities and representation in the 7 House of Representatives at the Federal level, and 8 the State Assembly and the State Senate at the State 9 level. 10 We look forward to your comments, and 11 we note the presence of a good number of people here. 12 And to that end, this hearing is already a success, 13 because Democracy was to get people involved, and 14 express their point of view. And just by your 15 attendance here, you have indicated your interest in 16 the outcome of this process. 17 And so, we both do thank you for 18 coming. 19 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you very much. 20 It's great to be here. 21 I'd just like to add to my colleagues, 22 Senator Skelos, Assemblyman Parment, we face perhaps 23 a more difficult task this year than we have faced in 24 the past, because pursuant to the United States 25 Constitution, we have only 29 Congressional seats. 0008 1 We have 31 in this State, as everyone knows. So, we 2 have the difficult task of devising a new plan for 3 our Congressional seats that will add two fewer 4 members from New York. And I think that's a 5 formidable challenge for all of us. 6 And I want to emphasize one thing that 7 my colleague Senator Skelos said: This is really a 8 discussion about the lines, about the communities, 9 and about the geography of New York, more than it is 10 about any one particular member of Congress, member 11 of New York State Senate, or member of the Assembly. 12 It's about how to preserve everyone's power of their 13 vote under the one man/one vote theory; and how, 14 under very complicated rules and law that is involved 15 in our court system, to make sure that our plan of 16 reapportionment is fair and even-handed; recognizes 17 communities and interests on the State level; and at 18 the same time makes sure that everyone has effective 19 participation in the electoral process. I think 20 that's one of the most important things we do. 21 It's going to be a difficult task. 22 Your being here gives us guidance on helping draw up 23 a plan that will meet the communities of New York, 24 the various parts of New York, meet their needs. But 25 I want to, again, emphasize, as Senator Skelos did, 0009 1 this is not necessarily about Congress, the House or 2 about anyone else. It's about communities in this 3 State, and how we organize them and serve their 4 interests. 5 Lastly, I would just mention, and I 6 don't want to disturb the hearing, but I think there 7 are a number of critical things that this Commission 8 still has to do in its organization; that is, get 9 more information out to the public; get the 10 redistricting data sent out on our website so that 11 more of this information is available, and so that 12 the public can participate in a better way with new 13 technology in the process of the difficult task of 14 reapportionment itself. 15 Again, thank you. 16 MR. SKELOS: Before we go on, I just 17 want to acknowledge the presence of my colleague in 18 helping him -- thanking him for helping me set up 19 this day. Senator Howard Asami, thank you very much 20 for helping us out today. 21 SENATOR HOWARD ASAMI: Thank you, 22 Senator Skelos; Congressmen. Thank you for coming 23 today, both the elected representatives of the people 24 and the average citizens who are here. 25 I said before that I thank all the 0010 1 people who come here, because it's really about you, 2 and your neighbors who aren't here, and your children 3 who are maybe working or at school; it's about the 4 future of the next ten years of the State, and how 5 the communities of the State will be organized to 6 provide themselves good representation. 7 Every two years in this country, for 8 over two hundred years, we have elected members of 9 Congress and our State Legislature. The communities 10 elect them. 11 I really don't want to just quote 12 what's already been said. I would ask you to direct 13 your testimony, to the extent that you feel inclined 14 to do so, to how your community relates to the other 15 communities in the region; not so much as to how you 16 relate to a person or persons who today may represent 17 you. Tomorrow, any one of us may not be here, but 18 you and your community still will. In ten years, any 19 one of us may not be serving in any of these 20 legislative offices, but you and your communities 21 will still have interests and deserve representation. 22 And the way we draw these lines and create these 23 Districts is buying the effectiveness with which you 24 and your communities can represent yourself through 25 your elected official. 0011 1 So, with that tone, I welcome and look 2 forward to what you have to tell us. 3 MR. SKELOS: Thank you very much, 4 Senator. I want to point out how difficult it is, 5 unfortunately, that we have to lose two seats in New 6 York State. Ten years ago, when I was doing the 7 redistricting, we had to lose three seats. So, 8 unfortunately, in terms of our District 9 representation, our population is not holding out 10 with the south and the west. And hopefully, in the 11 next ten years, we will have an increase in 12 population so we do not have to lose any further 13 Federal representatives. 14 Our first person who would like to talk 15 to us, and I thank him for his hospitality, is Mayor 16 Rick Lucci (phonetic spelling) of the City of 17 Binghamton. 18 Mayor? 19 MR. RICK LUCCI, MAYOR OF BINGHAMTON, 20 NEW YORK: Thank you, Senator. 21 Members of the delegation, members of 22 the State Senate and State Assembly, on behalf of the 23 City of Binghamton - and I know I speak for those 24 residents here of the Southern Tier - we want to 25 thank you for making one of your stops the heart of 0012 1 the Southern Tier. 2 As you can see this morning, we have a 3 cross section of residents, special interests, 4 representatives, elected officials, concerned 5 citizens at all levels, but they care very deeply 6 about their Federal and State representation, and 7 know how important it is to us on a daily basis. And 8 the turnout here I seem to think speaks volumes for 9 the great deal of interest and concern we have for 10 our future, especially in regards to representation 11 at the Federal level. 12 There are a number of very concerned, 13 compassionate individuals here. As Mayor of the City 14 of Binghamton, my only request is - and I know I join 15 with others - is that as we know you have a very 16 difficult task in front you; to reduce two seats is a 17 real challenge, and my only hope is that in the 18 process, that the concept of community is protected; 19 that communities are considered and contained as a 20 whole; that communities are not split; that there's 21 not divisions where they will cause more pain than 22 they will gain for our citizens. And that's a very 23 difficult task. 24 I welcome you here. I wish you the 25 best of luck on a very difficult task, and I know 0013 1 that you will be hearing some very solid testimony 2 from a cross section of the Southern Tier. We've 3 always had a rich tradition of being involved, being 4 committed, and being very, very vocal in regards to 5 Federal and State representation. 6 Good luck to each and every one of you. 7 MR. SKELOS: Our first witness is 8 Thomas Santulli, Chemung County Executive. 9 MR. THOMAS SANTULLI, CHEMUNG COUNTY 10 EXECUTIVE: Good morning. Thank you very much. My 11 name is Tom Santulli. I reside in the town of 12 Elmira, and I am the Chemung County Executive. 13 Whenever I travel, I try to learn from 14 other people, and I've been reading about the City of 15 Binghamton trying to be a little more fiscally 16 conservative, as we all are. And I just want to 17 congratulate Mayor Lucci, because actually not having 18 an air conditioner -- when we left here from Elmira, 19 we turned the air conditioning on for you. 20 I would like to begin my remarks this 21 morning by thanking both Senator Skelos and 22 Assemblyman Parment, the Co-Chairs of the Task Force, 23 for agreeing to hold this hearing in the Southern 24 Tier. This certainly provides an excellent 25 opportunity for all interested citizens in our 0014 1 region, regardless of their political persuasion, to 2 make their case for how they believe New York State's 3 Senate, Assembly and Congressional District 4 boundaries should be redrawn as a result of the 2000 5 census. 6 While recognizing that the composition 7 of our Senate and Assembly Districts is certainly of 8 critical importance to all New Yorkers, I 9 nevertheless want to focus on my comments today on 10 why I believe it is of paramount importance that our 11 current 31st Congressional District be maintained 12 approximately in its present form. 13 I would ask that you consider for a 14 moment what that form is. Physically, the District 15 covers all or part of ten counties running from Lake 16 Erie on the west along the Pennsylvania boarder, 17 through the Finger Lakes to the Chemung County-Tioga 18 County boarder on the east. There are no large 19 cities in the District, and its major population 20 centers are Jamestown, Corning, Elmira, Auburn and 21 suburban Ithaca. As a result, much of the 31st 22 District possesses a distinctly rural and relaxed 23 atmosphere, uncharacterized (sic) of more urbanized 24 areas. Additionally, this unique attribute of having 25 no preeminent metropolitan center has resulted in no 0015 1 one geographic area of the District gaining political 2 or economic dominance over the others. 3 While the District is culturally, 4 economically and ethically diverse, its residents 5 show an unusual ability to identify and pursue shared 6 goals. The ongoing effort to secure the Interstate 7 86 designation for all of New York State Route 17, is 8 an excellent example. Recognizing the regional 9 economic development potential inherent in gaining 10 Interstate status for Route 17, leaders in government 11 and business throughout the Southern Tier, but 12 primarily from within the 31st District, came 13 together to form the I-86 Coalition, which has led 14 the effort to secure funding for the completion of 15 various highway construction and rehabilitation 16 projects along the route's entire length, which must 17 be undertaken in order for the Federal Highway 18 Administration to grant Interstate designation. As a 19 group of small communities within a common rural 20 bond, we have joined together as equals to focus on 21 this goal in a way that probably would not have been 22 possible had we been fragmented and distant suburbs 23 of the larger urban centers of influence, Buffalo, 24 Rochester or Syracuse. 25 As I understand the current situation 0016 1 on reapportionment, New York State's loss of two 2 Congressional seats, the remaining 29 seats will 3 ideally contain approximately 655,000 persons. As 4 such, a major restructuring of the geographic 5 boundaries of those Congressional Districts that 6 cover relatively sparsely populated areas of the 7 State, is inevitable. Accepting that premise, I 8 recognize that the future composition of what is now 9 the 31st Congressional District will be quite 10 different than it is today. 11 It is my hope, and I believe the hope 12 of the vast majority of those I represent, that the 13 boundaries of our current District will be expanded 14 to meet the increased population target, rather than 15 having the District dismembered with portions simply 16 being added to other or more urban or metropolitan 17 districts. There is no doubt in my mind that if such 18 a dismantling were to occur, we would lose a great 19 deal of our regional economic development momentum 20 and identity. 21 I urge the members of the Task Force to 22 take whatever action is necessary to insure that this 23 does not happen. 24 Thank you for your time this morning, 25 and if you have any questions I would be pleased to 0017 1 answer them. 2 FROM THE PANEL: Yes. Mr. Executive, 3 we have a need in the 31st District to increase that 4 District by approximately 78,000 people to make it a 5 District sufficient to meet the new population 6 requirements of the State's new Congressional 7 Districts. With that understanding in mind, and your 8 statement, what would you think would be logically 9 those that should be added to a Southern Tier 10 District to create a District sufficient to make the 11 654,361 residents needed for a Congressional 12 District? That's sort of a multiple-choice question, 13 obviously. 14 MR. SANTULLI: Then there's multiple 15 answers. Out of all the neighbors, if I had my 16 business, it would be to go to the northeast. I 17 really do look at that -- I really feel strongly 18 that, you know, we in the Southern Tier, really, this 19 last year has been great for us; the last few years 20 economically. We've seen a lot of growth, and it 21 really is a lot of cities that get common problems, 22 common concerns and proper direction. I would love 23 to see us go into the Ithaca area. 24 I think our people share a lot of the 25 same interests, and I think that no one area would 0018 1 dominate. So, if I had a preference, it would be to 2 go to the northeast. 3 FROM THE PANEL: Is it still the 4 situation that many people in Elmira vacation or 5 summer up in the Finger Lakes Region? 6 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely; yeah. Other 7 than Myrtle Beach, where everybody seems to spend 8 this period, where Elmira actually relocates itself, 9 the Finger Lakes really is the primary place where 10 people go, where you have the winery industry. The 11 Finger Lakes really is where most people go. We have 12 a lot of common -- we share a lot of interests, and 13 we work together on close projects. 14 FROM THE PANEL: Is there a preference 15 among lakes from your community? 16 MR. SANTULLI: Yeah, most of us are 17 boaters, and for some reason we like Seneca Lake the 18 best. That's our preference. 19 FROM THE PANEL: So, there are -- 20 there's some ties between your community and some of 21 those north of Chemung County? 22 MR. SANTULLI: We really do. I mean, 23 one of the things that we have done is sell regional 24 tourism. It's the only way to sell tourism today. 25 And no one community is large enough to bring 0019 1 everybody, especially with the Corning Museum of 2 Glass being the hub of the tourist industry. That 3 whole Finger Lakes scenery in that direction really 4 does bring us together to form a overnight stay for 5 regional tourism. 6 FROM THE PANEL: And other ties are 7 there? You mentioned the Ithaca area. What other 8 ties are there besides the ones I mentioned; vacation 9 and the location of the lakes? 10 MR. SANTULLI: To me, it's everything; 11 it's tourism, it's economic connection. I mean, 12 again, we have been blessed with some economic 13 development, but Chemung County has just had a good 14 year. Everyone has to had a good year; Broome, 15 Schuyler, and everybody that surrounds us; Tioga 16 County. I think the common denominator is that if 17 this region is to stay healthy, we need to continue 18 to attract businesses into this area. And all of us 19 working together, knowing that we have equal 20 problems, equal things to be gained, that's the 21 common bond. 22 FROM THE PANEL: What planning region 23 is your county in, and what counties are involved in 24 that region? 25 MR. SANTULLI: You're going to ask me a 0020 1 tough one. Southern Tier Central, it does most of 2 our planning; Steuben, Chemung, Schuyler. I want to 3 make sure I didn't misunderstand the question here. 4 FROM THE PANEL: Chemung, Steuben, 5 Schuyler? 6 MR. SANTULLI: That's correct. 7 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. Just talking a 8 little bit about the movement, would Tioga fit into 9 that pattern? 10 MR. SANTULLI: Yes. 11 FROM THE PANEL: Both of those, both 12 the Tompkins and - I assume, the city of Ithaca - the 13 city of Ithaca is out, philosophically, the bounds of 14 the 31st? 15 MR. SANTULLI: They may be a little 16 more liberal than conservative Elmira. We have 17 common denominators. 18 FROM THE PANEL: Both Steuben and 19 Tompkins County and Tioga, are they currently in the 20 26th Congressional District? 21 MR. SANTULLI: Yes. Thank you. 22 MR. PARMENT: Mr. County Executive, 23 given your position and your opinion about matters of 24 the community's interests, and how this District 25 looks, I think, can tell a great weight. Let me ask 0021 1 you about the airports in the Southern Tier. Do they 2 serve areas outside the Southern Tier community? 3 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely. Just as a 4 point of interest, and no Broome County executives 5 are here, of the three (sic) airports, Elmira, 6 Corning, Ithaca and Broome, Chemung is the only 7 airport to lose four percent. And we do have people 8 that come, especially to visit Corning. I mean, 9 Corning really has reshaped our region. And with 10 that, they do so much business, the people do come 11 from areas outside of the Elmira Airport. 12 FROM THE PANEL: And what about 13 hospital services; is it a problem, and can you 14 explore their hospital services; where most of those 15 patients go? 16 MR. SANTULLI: Yeah, we're very 17 fortunate. We have the Onondaga Hospital, St. 18 Joseph's Hospital, Broome County, Guthrie in 19 Pennsylvania, and Corning Hospital. Probably, you 20 could go outside for major surgical complications. 21 You may head toward the west direction. 80 percent 22 of what we do is done within our four-hospital 23 region. 24 MR. PARMENT: Okay. Tom, just one 25 other question. The Route 17 you talked about in 0022 1 this discussion, in the 31st Congressional District, 2 and there's also Route 390 that runs north. And one 3 of my questions is: If this were conceived as the 4 390 District, not 17 District, in other words, we 5 move north instead of east, certainly Wyoming County, 6 Livingston County, Ontario County, there are some 7 small cities, as there are in the current 31st 8 Congressional District, but that might be an area to 9 get that 80,000 people moving north instead of moving 10 east? 11 MR. SANTULLI: I understand what you're 12 talking about. And to me, the task that you have in 13 front of you is difficult, and I think we as elected 14 officials, you know, we can't always have our cake 15 and eat it, too. And to me, you have to look in all 16 directions to see where the fit is. And to me, 17 today, especially in upstate New York, our successes 18 are similar, and our problems are similar. So, I 19 think we can move in just about any direction. This 20 is a game of give and take, and we need to be smart 21 enough to know that. Either fit works, you know. 22 MR. PARMENT: I think part of your 23 testimony was that, from your point of view, with 24 your identity in this region, alliance with a big 25 city is not the solution; it's to keep the 0023 1 smaller-city, rural character of this region, 2 regardless of whether we move further north or east? 3 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely. And I would 4 say this to you: That the squeaky wheel does get the 5 grease. We all know that. We're lumped in with 6 Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, wherever; that's where 7 the population center is. That's who's going to have 8 the individual attention. And I think we understand 9 that. 10 Today, the economic success that we've 11 had in the Southern Tier, especially in our county, 12 where probably over the last six years we've led the 13 State in the economic growth three out of those six 14 years, that's directly related to the fact that we 15 had our Congressmen and our Federal and State 16 officials and the local officials working together. 17 If didn't happen because of luck. It happened 18 because we were able to get the people that knew our 19 area, understood our area, the urban area, the rural 20 part of it - we are relatively small - and that 21 success is because of relationships. I believe if we 22 were in the large metropolitan area, most of that 23 economic development could not have occurred in our 24 county or in our region. 25 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. I've 0024 1 listened to your answer, and I won't belabor the 2 point. Maybe I can ask you to respond to what I see 3 as the bottom line. If it's detrimental Southern 4 Tier communities, any one of them, in a District 5 dominated by Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse, then are 6 you saying that it's essential to maintain a rural 7 District? 8 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely. Rural 9 problems are different than urban problems. It takes 10 that continuity and a person to understand that, or 11 else all that we worked so hard to get, I think it's 12 going to go in the wrong direction. 13 FROM THE PANEL: This isn't a matter 14 who represents you; it's a matter of how you could 15 express your views through that person? 16 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely. 17 FROM THE PANEL: Do you see other 18 Districts around the State that have the same 19 characteristic as primarily rural? 20 MR. SANTULLI: Absolutely. But, you 21 know, I think we are a little unique and. Let me 22 just -- even though we don't have any large 23 metropolitan one single area, I think we're a little 24 unique that we have this cluster of small average 25 cities that have some of the same problems of a large 0025 1 urban area. So, I think even though there are areas 2 that are not quite as rural, we're more of an 3 urban/rural setting, if there's such an animal. But 4 we really are a good cross section. 5 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 6 MR. SANTULLI: Thank you. 7 FROM THE PANEL: I want to thank you 8 very much. 9 MR. SANTULLI: Thank you. 10 MR. SKELOS: Our next is James Hare. 11 MR. JAMES HARE, COUNCILMAN, CITY OF 12 ELMIRA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the 13 opportunity to be here. When our County Executive 14 Mr. Santulli and I were colleagues on the City 15 Council, I was always reluctant to follow him 16 speaking because he never left me a lot of say. He's 17 made all the points, I think, very, very well. I can 18 only embellish them a little bit. 19 I appreciate the opportunity to be 20 here. I think these kinds of hearings are very 21 helpful, as you gentlemen said at the beginning; it 22 gives the grass roots a chance to speak. I am also 23 pleased to be a small part of the Millennium Project 24 organized by Congressman Houghton. This bipartisan, 25 grassroots effort is significant, and I hope the 0026 1 efforts made by so many will not fall on deaf ears. 2 I am a former Democratic Mayor of 3 Elmira, and currently a City Councilman who is about 4 to seek his tenth term on the Council. And I'm also 5 a member of the State Democratic Committee, and will 6 leave here to go to Albany for the State Democratic 7 meeting. I say that to emphasize the bipartisan 8 nature of this effort, by following our good 9 Republican County Executive; and I am glad to join 10 him in making the case for the 31st District. 11 In a broad sense, I want to see the 12 east/west nature of the Southern Tier District 13 maintained. In a specific sense, I am an advocate 14 for the integrity of the 31st District. 15 I sponsored a resolution from the City 16 Council in support of this position, and in response 17 to a letter from me over forty other municipalities 18 in the 31st District passed similar resolutions. 19 Many, like the Elmira City Council, have both 20 Republican and Democratic members. From our 21 standpoint, parties and politics should play no role 22 in the redistricting issue. 23 In addition to being an elected 24 official, I am a U.S. History and Government teacher 25 at Southside High School in Elmira, now in my 30th 0027 1 year. The study of government is my vocation and 2 avocation. I love politics, and find nothing 3 unseemly about thinking politically. I believe there 4 is a good government, political reason to preserve 5 our District in its basic outline. History will 6 show, with the election and reelection of Stan 7 Lundine, our District is not a certain Republican 8 sinecure, but because of the balance of population in 9 the west in Chautauqua and Cattaraugus Counties, with 10 Steuben and Chemung Counties in the east, whoever is 11 Congressman must pay attention to the entire 12 District. A Congressman must be responsive 13 throughout the District to serve the constituents. 14 My great fear of redistricting - and your gentlemen's 15 questions, have identified, I think, the fear of many 16 of us in the District - is that if a District places 17 Elmira in a north/south District that will link us 18 with Syracuse or Rochester, where the interests and 19 priorities are much different, and the imbalance of 20 population will result in a lack of responsiveness to 21 our interests. 22 Certainly, one could argue that a good 23 Congressman will attend to the needs of the entire 24 District, but that's not reality. The current 25 configuration of our District forces the Congressman 0028 1 to be attentive throughout. I agree with those who 2 say we would never have gotten not only Route 17, but 3 also the upgrade of I-86, if we had been a distant 4 suburb of Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse. 5 My priority is not ideology, but 6 service to the interests of the District. 7 Accessibility and responsiveness is important. The 8 small cities and rural communities of the Southern 9 Tier and Finger Lakes Region have certain things in 10 common. As a teacher, I have had both Stan Lundine 11 and Amo Houghton visit my classroom and they have 12 also visited my church. I believe that if I ever 13 wanted to run for Congress, I would stand a chance of 14 getting my party's nomination. I don't think that 15 would be the case if I was up against Syracuse or 16 Rochester. I don't think -- and I'm not announcing 17 by the way; I'm just being informative. I have no 18 desire to do that, but it reflects what I mean about 19 balance in the District. 20 I believe in the two-party system and 21 enjoy the campaign process, but I am not a fan of the 22 gerrymander. Good government should be our goal; not 23 political advantage. We need a big voice for our 24 smaller industrial centers, small colleges, small 25 cities, and our agricultural regions. We are 0029 1 concerned that our voices would be drowned out in the 2 urban hustle and bustle if this District were 3 realigned. 4 Thank you. 5 MR. SKELOS: I'm going to point out 6 that I graduated Southside High School, but on Long 7 Island. 8 MR. HARE: We get your mail from time 9 to time. 10 MR. SKELOS: Councilman, along the same 11 lines, a question I asked the County Executive: With 12 a need to add, I'd say 78,000 people to the number of 13 people currently in the 31st District to make it an 14 adequate size and population for it to be a 15 Congressional District, what direction do you think 16 the Task Force should look? 17 MR. HARE: Well, I think we should 18 expand in a continuous nature. Again, I am 19 interested in primarily that east/west configuration. 20 If you intend to break up the District into, say, two 21 districts, where you have to go north/south with 22 Buffalo or whatever, that would be a real problem for 23 me. But to pick up some continuous counties north of 24 us, or as Tom indicated earlier to the question, I 25 think, about Tioga going east, those counties all 0030 1 have a common kind of heritage with our District; and 2 to me, that did not pose a necessary problem. 3 MR. SKELOS: So, Wyoming County or 4 Livingston County, you would feel would be similar in 5 nature to the counties currently within the 31st 6 Congressional District? 7 MR. HARE: Well, I know we have two 8 prisons in Elmira. If we go up to Livingston County, 9 we pick up a prison. I mean, there are all sorts of 10 things there. I wouldn't have a problem with 11 Livingston. And, again, if you look at some of those 12 communities, they are very similar. The concern is, 13 if you have to divide the District, if you can keep 14 the District in a east/west framework, maybe it has 15 to become a little thicker going north, that may be 16 true, but east/west issues to me are truly 17 significant. 18 If you look at the history of the 19 transportation development in our area, the Thruway, 20 the Erie Canal, the New York Central Railroad through 21 the central part of New York State, all developed, 22 and a big population basis helped contribute to that 23 growth. But the Southern Tier was left out. 24 Fortunately, we began to develop a good working 25 relationship, I think, amongst the Districts, and 0031 1 having some Senators that were attentive, the 2 transportation -- east/west network transportation 3 improved. And I think if we didn't have that same 4 goal, we would be in jeopardy. And if we are linked 5 toward south, the emphasis is in the north; it's not 6 in the south. I think the history shows that. 7 FROM THE PANEL: Do you see any 8 barriers to political communication or representation 9 because of the size of the 31st District? 10 MR. HARE: I believe we're bigger than 11 Connecticut; and, obviously, as you try to improve 12 people in the rural area, it does increase the size. 13 You were mentioning other Districts similar. I think 14 there's a Congressional District in Northern New 15 York; Malone and all of those areas, that's pretty 16 large. That's a challenge, but I think that's a 17 necessity. Again, I would rather have similar 18 interests and a little more distance to travel than 19 have contrasting interests within the same District. 20 MR. SKELOS: All right. Thank you. 21 FROM THE PANEL: A couple of quick 22 questions: I think that someone before made 23 reference to the fact that Cayuga Lakes in the 31st 24 Congressional District, and portions of Seneca and 25 Cayuga are in there as well, would it make good sense 0032 1 to put Canandaigua and the Finger Lakes -- the 2 western-most Finger Lakes in this District, and make 3 it sort of a lake District, with Chautauqua on one 4 side and Seneca and --? 5 MR. HARE: I don't know whether I could 6 really comment on that. I mean, when we talk about 7 development, whether it's tourism, industrial, 8 whatever, you know, we can talk about regional, and 9 we talk about the boundaries don't necessarily mean 10 anything. We have to draw a line for both purposes. 11 I don't know that we have to draw a line for the 12 Finger Lakes. 13 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. One of the 14 things is when you look at the 80,000 people that are 15 needed for the District, if you move north, you move 16 into some of the smaller cities in Livingston and 17 Ontario County is at least because those people are 18 closer to this instead of -- 19 MR. HARE: Well --. 20 FROM THE PANEL: -- moving in this 21 set -- or as Senator Parment noticed, if we extended 22 this just east, in effect as sort of the same 23 dimension and thickness, we may have to move it 40 or 24 50 miles east, with a consequence that we end up with 25 a District that's 300 miles long. 0033 1 MR. HARE: Well, I'll be very honest 2 with you. I think the idea of a place -- and I maybe 3 don't know quite how to say this. A city like 4 Auburn, where you're divided the three ways in the 5 Congressional District, or even Ithaca that has some 6 division among Congressional representation, I think 7 if you can preserve communities in their entirety, it 8 should be the goal rather than having them divided. 9 So, if you have to make it, I guess, thicker to 10 preserve entire communities under one representative, 11 I think that's the best way to go. 12 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. And I just want 13 to ask everybody, not as a government issue - I'm 14 sure we appreciate this - a State like Wyoming has 15 only one Congressional representative, and that's 16 a -- 17 MR. HARE: The last --. 18 FROM THE PANEL: -- District that's 19 much, much, much bigger than this State. 20 MR. HARE: That's --. 21 FROM THE PANEL: And so, size alone 22 doesn't mean that you can't do the job as a Congress 23 person, whether it is an incumbent of someone else. 24 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. First, an 25 observation, and that really is addressed to 0034 1 everybody. 2 I think you can see that some of us at 3 least mentally are starting the sketch the maps. And 4 as such, even though you can't see them, and you can 5 imagine those maps that we may be drawing out in our 6 heads, try to comment on those, because this is an 7 opportunity to do that. 8 However, I know that's difficult for 9 most of us. And I want you to know that I have heard 10 the Task Force has to come back here before we adopt 11 the final plan, and maybe have a map or two on the 12 wall so that you can be more specific in your 13 comments. I don't know if we are going to be able to 14 do that, but I think we should. 15 My question to you is I'm beginning to 16 understand the imparticulation of the rural 17 interests, and frankly, I come from that District up 18 in Malone and Plattsburgh, and it's very much rural. 19 It seems to me that your point has to do with the 20 cities, not necessarily the counties within which the 21 city is. So, let me just ask you a hypothetical: If 22 you had Western New York rural District, that 23 included a town or area in Erie County that weren't 24 urban, would that change the character of the 25 District -- 0035 1 MR. HARE: I guess -- 2 FROM THE PANEL: -- for Monroe County? 3 MR. HARE: -- I guess what concerns me 4 is if you shift in the west, or you do something in 5 the east, does that mean you lock off part of the 6 Southern Tier Counties? That, to me, would be a real 7 problem. So, if you're talking about moving in that 8 direction, and it means that you lock off a Southern 9 Tier County and put it in the north/south District, 10 that's a problem for me. So, it would depend on -- 11 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 12 MR. HARE: -- that. 13 FROM THE PANEL: I understand that. 14 So, to restate that, you would like to see everything 15 from Pennsylvania --? 16 MR. HARE: We're armed. If those 17 Pennsylvanians come in, we want to be ready in 18 keeping those counties right along the border all 19 together. 20 FROM THE PANEL: The whole line. 21 Jamestown and --? 22 MR. HARE: That, to me, is essential. 23 Here when I talk about the integrity of the District, 24 to me, that's the integrity of the District. 25 FROM THE PANEL: So, you would rather 0036 1 go east if you had to than go north? 2 MR. HARE: Or a little thicker in the 3 middle. 4 FROM THE PANEL: A little thicker, but 5 not --? 6 MR. HARE: But I don't want to lose --. 7 FROM THE PANEL: Yeah, you don't want 8 to lose either end? 9 MR. HARE: I think the east and west of 10 this District are well-balanced, I think, population 11 wise. I think they've demonstrated that politically 12 the right candidates can be elected, whether they're 13 Republican or Democrat. The people have the interest 14 of the District at heart. That's the integrity of 15 that District, in my opinion. 16 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. Well, you've 17 generated one more question then. Now, I know what 18 the west end is, because you get, I think you said, a 19 part of Pennsylvania or the lake, and you're from 20 Chemung County here. 21 MR. HARE: Elmira. 22 FROM THE PANEL: So, at the moment, 23 you're the east end. Should that stay the east end, 24 or would it be all right to go far as Broome County? 25 MR. HARE: Well, my good friend Bill 0037 1 Thompson's here from Tioga, and I don't want to speak 2 for him, but he said that he'd like to have just one 3 Congressman. You know, one representation of an 4 entire community is an important concept. 5 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 6 MR. SKELOS: I just have one other 7 thing. I've got a final exam for your students. 8 Have them draw a Southern Tier District, what it 9 would look like, and maybe draw all of Western New 10 York while you're at it. It might be a great 11 experience for them. They'll learn something about 12 how Democracy works. 13 MR. HARE: Very good. Very good. All 14 of the Regents requirements should be back. If we 15 can eliminate some of that, we'll have some time to 16 do some of that, too. 17 MR. SKELOS: Next is Jeffrey Kraham of 18 Broome County. 19 MR. JEFFREY KRAHAM, BROOME COUNTY 20 EXECUTIVE: Good morning. My name is Jeff Kraham. I 21 have held the office of Broome County Executive since 22 1997. It is my privilege to be here with you this 23 morning to address this very important issue. And 24 first of all, I would like to join Mayor Lucci in 25 welcoming everyone to Broome County; the Board, of 0038 1 course; of course, all the members of the 31st 2 District. It's great to see such a show of support 3 on a very important issue. 4 I would like to begin by giving you a 5 brief personal background of myself. I'm a native of 6 Broome County, and I have lived in the Hamlet of 7 Tocans (phonetic spelling), New York, all my life. 8 I'm a graduate of Broome Community College and 9 Binghamton University. I've been involved in local 10 politics for more than twenty years. I left public 11 service in 1990, to focus more attention on my 12 business. I reentered public life in 1996, when I 13 became Broome County Executive. I am married; have 14 two children. 15 Currently, three different members of 16 Congress represent Broome County, and I feel that the 17 region suffers because of this. If you arrive at our 18 newly renovated Binghamton Regional Airport, you are 19 in one Congressional District. I live in another 20 Congressional District. And right here where we're 21 sitting, we have a third Congressional District. 22 Even some of our rural towns are split into different 23 Districts. 24 Our three Congressman, all hardworking, 25 are all based elsewhere, and it's difficult for them 0039 1 to give Broome County the attention that we feel it 2 deserves. Broome County alone has a population of 3 more than 200,000 residents. As part of the 4 Binghamton M.S.A., which includes Tioga County, that 5 number rises to nearly 260,000, making our needs 6 diverse and complex. 7 More coherent Congressional 8 representation would enable Broome and Tioga Counties 9 to form better working relationships with the 10 Appalachian Regional Commission, U.S. Department of 11 Labor, and U.S. Department of Congress, just to name 12 a few. 13 By working collaboratively with these 14 agencies, our many infrastructure, educational, and 15 work-force-development issues could be better 16 addressed. We have a solid base of high-tech 17 industry and are working to develop a technology 18 triangle in the Southern Tier, and need all the help 19 we can get to attract new companies and to enable 20 existing companies to expand. 21 We are building on many successful 22 partnerships with our neighbor to the west. We have 23 joined together in our support for completion of 24 Interstate 86. We have partnered in the collection 25 of hazardous materials. We are partners in education 0040 1 with the Broome-Tioga BOCES; and our newest endeavor, 2 the Broome-Tioga Workforce Development System, is up 3 and running. 4 This organization is run by an 5 executive director who is employed by both Broome and 6 Tioga Counties. The reason for forming Workforce 7 Development System was so that we could take a 8 collective and proactive approach to developing our 9 local work force, and be better equipped in working 10 with businesses on their job-training groups. 11 Because many of our issues are the 12 same, the need to attract people back to the region, 13 provide necessary job training for employees, and the 14 need to market the Southern Tier as a high-tech 15 corridor, working together was the only option. One 16 Congressman could facilitate that process. 17 I'd like to thank you for the 18 opportunity to speak here this morning. This issue 19 is critical to the success and future growth of 20 Broome and Tioga Counties. We will continue to work 21 as partners to preserve the high quality of life that 22 we all enjoy now. 23 Thank you very much for you time. 24 FROM THE PANEL: Mr. Executive, we have 25 some things in common here. One you touched on was 0041 1 Regional Commission. My County is in that area, and 2 I hadn't thought about this; and so, I thank you for 3 bringing it up. The three members of the Congress 4 that represent Broome County, do any of them share 5 with Broome County the distinction of being 6 Appalachian in their residence or --? 7 MR. KRAHAM: No. 8 FROM THE PANEL: No. 9 MR. KRAHAM: Not at all. 10 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. Now, who 11 are the three members of Congress who represent 12 Broome? 13 MR. KRAHAM: Congressman Hinchey who, 14 of course, lives on the Hudson River. There's 15 Congressman Walsh, who's based in Syracuse and 16 Congressman Bowen (phonetic spelling), who is out of 17 Utica. 18 FROM THE PANEL: The Hinchey District - 19 I'll call it the Hinchey District; the 20 current-representative Hinchey District - that does 21 include some Appalachian counties; correct? 22 MR. KRAHAM: Yes, it does. 23 FROM THE PANEL: And does the 24 Congressional District represented by Mr. Bowen 25 represent Appalachian Counties? 0042 1 MR. KRAHAM: Yeah. 2 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. With the 3 Syracuse connection, with Congressman Walsh, they 4 have only Broome, basically, that's in that District 5 that's Appalachian. And would you feel that that 6 would be an important consideration for us to try 7 draw Districts that would keep the Appalachian area 8 within Congressional Districts to the extent 9 possible, and with people representing the people 10 from Appalachian region? 11 MR. KRAHAM: I think it would be an 12 advantage to Congress. 13 FROM THE PANEL: Do you sense that the 14 representatives that currently represent Broome 15 County have an appreciation for the Appalachian 16 program? 17 MR. KRAHAM: Yeah, I think they all do. 18 I think all our Congressman right now are 19 hardworking, but they are fairly removed from this 20 area. This is an important base here in Broome 21 County, and we feel we have much more in common with 22 the Southern Tier than we do on a lot of issues. You 23 know, for instances, upgrading I-86 all the way 24 across the Southern Tier, it's an important issue. 25 But for most residents of Broome County, the question 0043 1 of whether we bridge the Hudson River or not is not 2 really an issue that directly faces us. 3 FROM THE PANEL: Well, your principal 4 point to us this morning is that you would like to 5 see Broome County represented by a single District; 6 am I correct, or is that --? 7 MR. KRAHAM: That's correct. 8 FROM THE PANEL: That's correct? 9 MR. KRAHAM: Yeah, we feel that would 10 be to the best advantage of the residents of Broome 11 County. If Broome County -- we work so closely 12 together that we feel it would be in our best 13 interest to be represented by one Congressman. 14 FROM THE PANEL: And what is the 15 population of Broome County? 16 MR. KRAHAM: About 200,536. 17 FROM THE PANEL: 200,000. So it's 18 approximately a third of the new Congressional issue 19 of -- 20 MR. KRAHAM: Right. 21 FROM THE PANEL: -- 615,000. Thank 22 you. 23 MR. KRAHAM: Okay. 24 MR. SKELOS: Thank you. Thank you very 25 much. Okay. That's all. Thank you very much I 0044 1 appreciate you being here. 2 Our next witness is Peter Ward, Chair, 3 Tioga County Legislature. 4 MR. PETER WARD, CHAIR, TIOGA COUNTY 5 LEGISLATURE: Thank you. It's a privilege to be 6 here, Senator Skelos; and Assemblyman Parment; 7 members of the Legislative Task Force on Demographic 8 Research and Reapportionment. I want to thank you 9 for the opportunity to testify before your Task Force 10 this morning. 11 My name is Peter Ward, and I am the 12 Chair of the Tioga County Legislature; and this is 13 John Byrne, Tioga County Manager. On behalf of the 14 Tioga County Legislature, I would like to urge the 15 New York State Senate and Assembly to ensure that 16 Broome County and Tioga County remain together in the 17 same Senatorial District. 18 Broome County and Tioga county are 19 really part of one community that share many common 20 interests. In the Southern Tier, we see the name 21 Broome hyphen Tioga so often that we sometimes see 22 ourselves as one contiguous community. 23 There are so many examples of the 24 interdependence between our two counties that they 25 would be difficult to name here today, but here are a 0045 1 few: 2 The Broome-Tioga Workforce Development 3 System has created a structure for the two counties 4 to work together on employment, business retention 5 and business recruitment issues. Governor Pataki 6 recently awarded the organization with $755,000 to 7 enable businesses to train employees in cutting-edge 8 high-technology skills. When Flextronics of Broome 9 and Sanmina of Tioga recently announced layoffs, the 10 Broome and Tioga Employment Centers in conjunction 11 with the State Department of Labor mobilized to 12 counsel and placed employees regardless of what 13 county there were dealing with. 14 Broome County Executive Jeff Kraham 15 has taken the unprecedented step of publicly 16 proposing that the counties work together as a region 17 to create 10,000 new jobs. Tioga County applauds the 18 County Executive's efforts, and we have pledged in 19 our full cooperation as Broome County's partner. 20 A new Broome-Tioga coalition to prevent 21 smoking will kick off the new anti-smoking campaign 22 this month. 23 The local chapter of the League of 24 Women Voters and the local chapter of American Red 25 Cross represents Broome and Tioga counties. 0046 1 Literacy volunteers and many other 2 programs represent Broome and Tioga Counties 3 exclusively. 4 Even some of Tioga county's residents 5 have Broome County zip codes. 6 In conclusion, Broome and Tioga 7 Counties are inseparable to the local community, and 8 the State would be doing our region a disservice if 9 it were to separate us in the Senatorial 10 redistricting process. 11 Thank you for your time. The County 12 Manager and I are available to answer any questions. 13 FROM THE PANEL: Let me just ask a 14 question about the Senatorial issues that you raise. 15 The State Senate Districts, according to the 16 population in the 51st District, Assemblyman Lewis's 17 (phonetic spelling) District - he was here earlier - 18 we have to pick up about, again, we've got find 19 somewhere around 30,000 additional people who are 20 going to meet the standard. We don't have to do 21 that, because we're not required by law, but my 22 question to you is: If we have to expand the 51st 23 Senate District, where would you go? 24 MR. WARD: I would --. 25 FROM THE PANEL: Where is the 0047 1 community's interest between Tioga and Broome; is it 2 north or east or west? You can't go south. 3 MR. WARD: No, that's Pennsylvania, but 4 I hadn't really thought about that. Chenango County 5 and Cortland County have many similar interests to 6 Tioga. Well, Delaware does, too. I guess I'm really 7 not prepared to answer that. 8 FROM THE PANEL: Just for the record, 9 you see our dilemma. 10 MR. WARD: Yes. 11 FROM THE PANEL: We have to go 12 somewhere and find some more people because of the 13 change in population, and that's why one of the 14 things that this Commission has to resolve, because 15 the Legislature will eventually vote on it, is where 16 are those community's interest; where do they lie? 17 Do they lie in the north; do they lie in the east; do 18 they lie in the west? I would just encourage you, if 19 you get any ideas; and I guess this is true for 20 everybody who speaks. And I guess that today is not 21 the final episode, because if you have anything you 22 want to add to supplement your testimony, you can 23 send to us. And if you get any idea or inspiration 24 about a map that you think, from your position and 25 title the County Legislature will agree of 0048 1 community's interest with Tioga County or Broome or 2 any other County, don't hesitate to put it down on a 3 little map and draw what looks like a Senate District 4 that would fit your interests and serve your 5 community. I'd encourage you to do that. 6 MR. WARD: I could give you a little 7 background on Tioga. It's very rural. We have no 8 cities, and our population is about 53,000. We serve 9 as a kind of a living community to the surrounding 10 counties. Many of our people work in Chemung County, 11 Broome County and enjoy the comfort of living in 12 Tioga County. We have no airports, we have no 13 hospitals. We got to all the surrounding Counties 14 for those services; out of Ithaca, out of Chemung, 15 out of Broome. And we're just starting to work 16 right. And so, we have disadvantages of no 17 universities around us; we have no colleges. But we 18 have all around us, you know, cultural advantages. 19 So, we would -- actually, probably any of the 20 counties could go with us. 21 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 22 FROM THE PANEL: I wondered who is the 23 largest employer in Tioga County? 24 MR. WARD: Lockheed Martin. 25 FROM THE PANEL: Lockheed Martin? 0049 1 MR. WARD: Yes, sir. 2 FROM THE PANEL: And would that be -- 3 where would their main employment be? 4 MR. WARD: In Owego. 5 FROM THE PANEL: Owego. Would you 6 characterize Tioga as a County with a manufacturing 7 face to its economy or agriculture? 8 MR. WARD: It's primarily agriculture, 9 but we would like to see some growth in 10 manufacturing. I think we have some growth 11 opportunity. 12 FROM THE PANEL: All right. Thank you. 13 MR. WARD: And that's one of the things 14 that Monroe County is working with us, which I'm 15 grateful that they've been willing to help us 16 increase our employment. 17 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. Mr. 18 Chairman, I would just like to note the arrival of 19 Assemblyman Jay Goodard, has joined us. 20 ASSEMBLYMAN JAY GOODARD: Hi, Senator 21 Skelos, how are you; Senator Dollinger? 22 FROM THE PANEL: Next is Frank Meyer. 23 MR. FRANK MEYER, PRESIDENT, LOCKHEED 24 MARTIN SYSTEMS: Okay. Well, this is a good segue at 25 this point because it was asked who's the largest 0050 1 employer in Tioga County; it's my organization, 2 Lockheed Martin. It's probably one of the premier 3 technology companies in the world. 4 FROM THE FLOOR: We can't hear you. 5 MR. MEYER: It's probably one of the 6 premier technology companies in the world; it's 7 located in Owego, New York, serving the military 8 D.O.D.; serving the Postal Service, the largest 9 automation compiler, the U.S. Postal Service, in the 10 United States. 11 It's a unique technology, software 12 systems engineering kind of organization. We've been 13 in existence for forty years. We started out as 14 I.B.M. And we migrated through several ownership 15 migrations in the turmoil of the '90s. During that 16 time period, we've been able to grow and flourish and 17 continue to grow in a very robust business. I have 18 about a quarter-of-a-billion-dollar-a-year payroll. 19 I put about a $100 million a year into the local 20 Southern Tier economy for local vendors; primarily 21 high-tech vendors. 22 More than 80 percent of my population 23 reside and work in the current District, the 26th 24 District. I have the unique ability that on the 25 Federal side, I have one Congressman to go through 0051 1 for my constituency, local issues, my Federal issues. 2 I have Tom Livitz (phonetic spelling) that goes 3 through my State issues; my buddy Jeff Kraham, who is 4 as much a partner in Broome County. So, I'm a 5 Broome-Tioga County kind of guy, with the southern 6 part of Broome County. 7 We've been here for forty years, as I 8 say. We've been able to flourish through changes in 9 ownership and growth. I'm going to add I've got 150 10 college hires coming in in the next six weeks. I've 11 added 180 experienced professionals. I've hired more 12 than 1,000 new people in the Southern Tier over the 13 last three years. And in order to have that kind of 14 job creation, it takes real partnership. It takes 15 partnership at the local level. We're involved in 16 the Coalition for Better Schools. It takes 17 partnership at the State level with people like Tom 18 Livitz, that are able to come in and work with us on 19 the State kind of issues, and work with us on the 20 Glendale Technology Park, put a couple hundred jobs 21 in there. 22 And it takes working with one 23 Congressman who has a handle on reappropriation; 24 that's very helpful to me from the standpoint of my 25 activity, because he is then able to act as an 0052 1 informed representative; he is able to understand the 2 things that are important to the Southern Tier. 3 And so, when you look at what my 4 message is to you, I think Broome and Tioga County 5 are tied together. I'm the largest traveler out of 6 Broome County Airport. I wish I didn't travel as 7 much, but I have somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 over 10,000 trips a year to come from my organization 9 through Broome County airport. It is our airport of 10 choice because of the center of population I've just 11 given. But 80 percent of my population goes from 12 Tioga County through Broome County. The center of my 13 population probably is the Broome/Tioga County line 14 for high-tech systems engineering, that kind of 15 activity. 16 We at Lockheed Martin, and our 17 predecessor companies, have benefited from this great 18 partnership. And they don't call this the Valley of 19 Opportunity for nothing. This is because of great 20 partnership at the local government level, up through 21 the State representatives in Congress to be able to 22 address our needs. And I have one State 23 representative; I've got one Federal representative. 24 And they've been very responsive, and they've taken 25 the time to learn about my business, and to be able 0053 1 to advocate for us on those high-technology issues. 2 I think we're a very close-knit 3 community. We've obviously been pleased to 4 support -- get the support of -- of both sets of the 5 Government. And so, if you ask me, I happen to 6 like -- well, I'm a home-town guy by the way. I came 7 in the back door as a new hire in 1969. I took over 8 stewardship of the organization three years ago. 9 And, you know, I lived in Vestal, and my kids were 10 educated in SUNY. 11 And so, if you ask anybody that likes 12 status quo, I like status quo. But I wanted to 13 convey to you because that there is depression. I 14 mean, Tioga County's a rural County. And, indeed, it 15 is. But it's also a high-tech center supporting 16 Department of Defense, Postal Service and commercial 17 accounts. 18 I'm probably the -- I've had great 19 success with General Motors, and people like that. 20 That's what I care about. I would just want to be 21 able to convey the great support that we get, both 22 from the Senatorial alignment that acts today, and 23 the Congressional. I'd be happy to take any 24 questions, comments. If you have any college 25 students graduating soon, give me a resume. We're 0054 1 looking for people, and we're creating jobs. 2 FROM THE PANEL: Yes. In your 3 commerce, I assume your products go from your point 4 of manufacture to customers by truck? 5 MR. MEYER: Well, think about that we 6 are persistent integrators. So, what I'm going to do 7 is I'm going to provide software, engineering design. 8 I do ship things. They will go by truck. But I'm a 9 broad-based engineering systems solution that they're 10 going to come together at the customer location. So, 11 I'm a manufacturer; I do that. But that's about, oh, 12 a third of my business. The rest of it is high-tech 13 systems engineering software kind of thing. We do 14 trucking. Southern Tier Expressway improvement is 15 very important to me. 16 FROM THE PANEL: Understood. Now, in 17 that regard, do you have any ties to Corning Glass 18 and that type of thing? 19 MR. MEYER: No. 20 FROM THE PANEL: No. 21 MR. MEYER: If you take a look at what 22 we're like, I'm pretty self-contained. And the fact 23 that, you know, as you described, I'm sort of a 24 pretty well kept secret in the Southern Tier. And 25 so, if you turn right, you're going to run into this 0055 1 1.8 million-square-foot facility out there. But my 2 ties tend to be into customer relations all over the 3 country; into government locations, postal locations, 4 those type of things. And my partnering tends to be 5 with local vendors in the Southern Tier, that provide 6 the additional software skills and those kinds of 7 things. 8 So, if you think about it like that, 9 you know, my next stop after, you know, that's 10 something we feel probably will be in Detroit to help 11 General Motors, or we'll be in some major mail 12 facility; it will be a government facility. That's 13 the tie-ins I have, and I use local vendors in the 14 work force. 15 FROM THE PANEL: How does it happen 16 that you're in that location? 17 MR. MEYER: Thirty-second history 18 lesson. Chosen by Tom Watson (phonetic spelling), 19 I.B.M., to support the B-52 program in 1952; built in 20 1958 to serve the national interest, at the request 21 of, you know, at that time, the president. 22 And it happened to be along the way 23 from a major I.B.M. location in Endicott to Watson's 24 home over in Elmira, Corning. And that's how things, 25 you know, get done. So, it was almost an accident we 0056 1 were chosen to be there. We've been there for 40 2 year, as I said, 1.8 million square feet, 800 acres. 3 FROM THE PANEL: And how many 4 employees? 5 MR. MEYER: About 3,800; and about 80 6 percent of them are in the current District at the 7 time. 8 FROM THE PANEL: Okay. Thank you. 9 MR. MEYER: Anything else? 10 FROM THE PANEL: A question: Will you 11 have any nexus to the Corning, and I think you 12 communicated no? 13 MR. MEYER: No. 14 FROM THE PANEL: Do you have any nexus 15 to hospitals in other counties? 16 MR. MEYER: No. 17 FROM THE PANEL: One of the things, Mr. 18 Meyer, you see our dilemma here as we have to find 19 65,000 people to put into 26th Congressional District 20 or what will be we figure about 80,000 people to put 21 into the Southern Tier District. But my question is: 22 One of the things that we had talked about was the 23 notion of whether we should have sort of a concentric 24 circle Congressional approach, where we look to the 25 hub that's here today; that Tioga and Broome are a 0057 1 hub, and we should draw lines out and create sort of 2 spherical-shape Districts. If you look at the two 3 Districts that we're talking about today, they're 4 both longitudinal; I mean, they extend a great deal 5 of a distance. What I hear you saying is that Broome 6 and Tioga as the center would probably be best served 7 if it had concentric circle lines; is that correct? 8 MR. MEYER: The way we work today with 9 running from up by Ithaca and down the Hudson River, 10 it has served us well because the major population of 11 that's all in Broome and Tioga. So, I'm very 12 comfortable with the District today, and I wouldn't 13 presume to comment on your job of trying to draw into 14 other Districts. I mean, all I'm here for today is 15 to tell you that the current activity, both 16 Senatorial and State-side, works very well for us; 17 it's a great partnership that we're doing. And so, 18 80 percent of our constitutes are in there. So, I 19 don't have an outlying bunch of constituents. Nor do 20 I have an outlying group of suppliers or business 21 partners. So, I am sort of self-contained, you know. 22 I mean, I probably didn't help you there on that, but 23 I almost don't have an opinion, because I can just 24 comment on what works today. 25 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 0058 1 MR. MEYER: Thank you, everyone. 2 MR. SKELOS: Henrik Dullea. 3 MR. HENRIK N. DULLEA, VICE PRESIDENT, 4 UNIVERSITY RELATIONS, CORNELL UNIVERSITY: Thanks 5 very much, Mr. Chairman. Good to have all of you 6 here in the Southern Tier. I've worked with you many 7 years in the past in Albany. 8 My name is Henrik Dullea. I'm the Vice 9 President for University Relations at Cornell 10 University. Much like the previous speaker from 11 Lockheed Martin, I'm here to tell you that the 12 current arrangement that we have with our 13 Congressional representation in Tompkins County, at 14 least those of us in the University, has also worked 15 very well. And that's going to be very different 16 from what some people have said where there's a need 17 to have a total community. We have two members of 18 Congress who represent Tompkins County; Congressman 19 Maurice Hinchey of the 26th, and Congressman Amo 20 Houghton of the 31st. 21 Both members of Congress provide 22 extraordinarily excellent service on behalf of the 23 University, as we see it. Cornell University is the 24 largest employer in the 26th Congressional District 25 represented by Mr. Hinchey. We have over 9,000 0059 1 employees. We have an annual budget of approximately 2 $1.7 billion. We have a very significant dependency 3 on Federal funding. 4 Federal funding has been much described 5 by members of the State Legislature as significant, 6 the money we receive from the State of New York, 7 being that we are New York State's primary 8 university. We look to support from the Congress in 9 many different areas, but primarily two areas; and 10 that is high-tech and agriculture. 11 Currently, the Congressional 12 representation, is very beneficial for us. Let me 13 speak for a moment about that. You have my prepared 14 text. You'll have an opportunity to go through that. 15 It talks essentially about the good services from Mr. 16 Hinchey, in particular. Let me talk just about that 17 for one moment, given the nature of the District. It 18 comes from the relationship in the high-tech area as 19 it effects part of Broome County. 20 Right now, we do have the city of 21 Ithaca and the town of Ithaca, those two portions of 22 Tompkins County, are represented by Mr. Hinchey with 23 the area to the south. We have one of our two very 24 major corporate partners at Cornell, the I.B.M. 25 Corporation. The I.B.M. Corporation's heavily 0060 1 located here in the Binghamton area, but it also 2 stretches over in the Hudson Valley. We do a great 3 deal of work between Cornell and I.B.M. It is a 4 major partnership with I.B.M., and you're familiar 5 with that on the State level. It has worked very, 6 very well for us. Mr. Hinchey is a very strong 7 supporter of Federal funding in support of that 8 program. I think that's important that you be aware 9 of that. 10 Similarly, we have a major interest in 11 agriculture. We are the principal source of 12 agricultural research throughout the State of New 13 York. The 31st Congressional District is primarily a 14 rural Congressional District. We have a lot of 15 strong ties there. On the agricultural side, I'll 16 also say that we do have strong partnerships with 17 Corning, Incorporated. They are our second major 18 high-tech partner. 19 I guess I'd like to close my opening 20 remarks by saying that right now, this works very 21 well for Cornell University; and many, many people 22 who are on the university fully support it. I think 23 that Tompkins County consistently has the lowest 24 unemployment rate in New York State; most recently, I 25 think it's two point six percent. That is because of 0061 1 the tremendous Federal dollars coming to the 2 university. We have $273 million coming from the 3 Federal government this year to Cornell, and we hope 4 to continue that every year. 5 Having two members of Congress actually 6 helps us in that regard. There was a time in the 7 1980s when we had three. Congressman Boehlert's 8 District also then came into Tompkins County. If you 9 were to think for a moment about having a senior 10 member of the Ways and Means Committee, a senior 11 member of the Agricultural Appropriations Committee, 12 and the Chairman of the Health Science Committee, all 13 representing Tompkins County, I will tell you that 14 Cornell will be absolutely delighted with that kind 15 of an arrangement. 16 So, that's significant in the 17 community's interest in each direction. I hope that 18 as you think about the boundaries that you have to 19 draw in order to accommodate the population changes, 20 you will not automatically look to put us into one or 21 the other. Mr. Hinchey's District serves us very 22 well, and having Congressman Houghton representing 23 the rural area of Tompkins County, I think, also 24 serves us very well. 25 So, I thank you much for your 0062 1 attention. I'll be pleased to answer any questions 2 that you have. 3 FROM THE PANEL: Just that one of the 4 questions that was posed to us yesterday was on 5 Cornell University's research opportunities, and 6 Federal dollars for the Ithaca area redistricted with 7 the Syracuse area, and one of the expressions was 8 that there was a fear that this might cause 9 competition between the universities. Would you 10 think that that would be a problem if Syracuse 11 University and Cornell University were in the same 12 Congressional District? 13 MR. DULLEA: We're in a competitive 14 world in the university environment. We compete 15 every day for Federal dollars in terms of grants. 16 The truth is it's really not on an institutional 17 basis, primarily. So, at each institution, there are 18 wonderful faculty, who themselves are the ones who 19 have to justify the applications. So, I find that 20 you are increasingly in higher education putting 21 together partnerships. And we do that in many 22 different directions. 23 We were delighted that Governor Pataki 24 yesterday announced that we would be one of the Star 25 Centers for Excellence. We have a significant 0063 1 partnership there with both I.B.M. and Corning. The 2 reach of institutions is quite considerable. I'd 3 just go back to what I said earlier; that the current 4 configuration with both high-tech and agricultural 5 representatives strongly in Tompkins County, I think, 6 is working very well for us. 7 FROM THE PANEL: Is the Geneva 8 Experiment Station currently in the 31st 9 Congressional District? 10 MR. DULLEA: I believe that's 11 represented by Congressman Marlos (phonetic 12 spelling). 13 FROM THE PANEL: By Congressman Marlos. 14 Okay. 15 FROM THE PANEL: So, you in effect have 16 three? 17 MR. DULLEA: Well, if you think of our 18 many facilities that we have around the State, with 19 certainly our extension programs in Western New York, 20 our North Country Agriculture Program, the duck farm 21 on Long Island, you know, we reach out to a lot of 22 folks. 23 FROM THE PANEL: Was this purposeful or 24 was this an accident? 25 MR. DULLEA: I think it was the 0064 1 intelligence of the New York State Legislature and 2 Government. 3 FROM THE PANEL: Perhaps what you're 4 really saying is we should gerrymander the whole 5 State to include all of us in the Cornell District. 6 MR. DULLEA: We'd be willing to think 7 about that. 8 FROM THE PANEL: I'm having a little 9 amount of difficulty here understanding the 10 thematical identification the District would be 11 accounting, and we all hope that our positions 12 identify the lines. But our job is very different. 13 To me, the analogy - and I've done redistricting at 14 the local level - even though I was evenly involved 15 with the politics, I tried to approach it in the more 16 abstract and the more academic way. And the same way 17 with surveyors surveying the land without regard to 18 who is going to own it today or in a hundred years, I 19 think we really are obliged by the Constitution and 20 by two centuries of conditioning to try to draw the 21 Districts without regard to Maurice Hinchey or Amo 22 Houghton or Tom Reynolds (phonetic spelling) or any 23 of us, because it's the Districts, as I said earlier, 24 that are going to survive. 25 Later today, we're going hear from 0065 1 people, whereas yesterday we heard from Department of 2 Common Laws, and they along with NYPEG are 3 recommending - not that we're going to do that - but 4 as an alternative idea, doing redistricting without 5 any consideration, even where the incumbents live. 6 Could you comment on their approach, vis-a-vis the 7 approach that we aren't too familiar with here today, 8 which is that? 9 MR. DULLEA: Oh, I think that's 10 practical. And by practical, I mean, I think you 11 look for a general issue of commonality. I tried to 12 address that in my remarks in terms of the 13 agricultural relevance in similar areas, and to some 14 degree the way you see the high-tech emphasis in 15 another area. 16 But I think also from the State 17 Legislature's perspective, you need to think of where 18 things are lacking, though, in the Congress over the 19 next ten years. I think that's not an unreasonable 20 thing for members of the State Legislature to have in 21 mind as they look to the future and what's in the 22 best interest of the State as a whole. 23 There is an integrity in the 31st 24 District in terms of agricultural issues. That's 25 very important to New York State. It's important to 0066 1 have a champion for those issues in the Congress, no 2 matter who the person is, and will have the ability 3 to champion those issues, be it helped or hindered by 4 the lines that you draw in the Legislature. You have 5 to think about that. 6 Similarly, I think you have to think 7 about where is our strength in the Congressional 8 delegation today, where is it conceivably going to be 9 over the years, and do you have particular 10 opportunities to see that New York be the more -- as 11 competitive as we can be with other states that are 12 gaining in population in the House of Representatives 13 at a time when we are losing. And if it is simply a 14 perfect-world model drawn by some civic organization 15 that doesn't take into account political realities 16 and potential policy indications of changes, I don't 17 think New York State is going to be as benefited as 18 it would otherwise be. 19 FROM THE PANEL: So, in other words, 20 incumbent consideration really are analogous? 21 MR. DULLEA: I think they are. I don't 22 think it's inappropriate to think about that. That's 23 why, in my prepared remarks, I really emphasized the 24 extraordinary service of our representatives. 25 Thank you. 0067 1 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. As I 2 understand your testimony, I encapsulated it as 3 follows: If we had to put an intersection of several 4 Districts in Central New York, your position is that 5 that intersection being close to Ithaca is not a bad 6 idea, because it would give the college, the 7 university access to as many potential members of 8 Congress that are potentially bipartisan as it has 9 been in the past. So, that's just contrary to other 10 views that we've heard, which is: Please put us in 11 one District, one Congressional District, with one 12 Senator. Do you think it's your opinion that you're 13 best served by as many intersections as close to 14 Ithaca as possible? 15 MR. DULLEA: Yes. In a word, I think 16 it's best if we work on a bipartisan basis with 17 members on both sides, the existing interests within 18 Tompkins County, the city of Ithaca and the town of 19 Ithaca, because I think the rural areas to the north 20 of the County stretching up to Cayuga County are in 21 some respects different, and that's okay. 22 FROM THE PANEL: I know that you're in 23 the academic area, and you mentioned in terms of 24 Congress being a force of some sort of continuity, 25 seniority, practical, doing what's best for the 0068 1 State, does the fact that a change administration be 2 more interested in who is majority/minority in terms 3 of access in funding and seniority of those majority 4 ones? 5 MR. DULLEA: Yes. 6 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 7 The next is Jack Cheevers, Supervisor, 8 Town of Union. Are you here? 9 Next, we have David Dawson. Is David 10 here? 11 MR. DAVID DAWSON, DAWSON METAL COMPANY, 12 INCORPORATED: Right here. 13 Gentlemen, thank you. My name is David 14 Dawson. I'm a manufacturer from the western end of 15 31st Congressional District over in Jamestown. I, 16 too, don't envy the job that you guys have got in 17 front of you. 18 Unfortunately, when we lose 19 competitiveness, we lose the people in the State; we 20 lose Congressmen. And I'm not here advocating which 21 Congressman should be retained, which Congressman 22 should not be retained. I think the issue for us in 23 the 31st -- and I think you used the word \"rural\" as 24 the nature of the 31st, or somebody did, but 25 longitudinal was also used as a description of what 0069 1 the 31st looked like. And I think that those are 2 fair characterizations, having just driven across the 3 Southern Tier Expressway. You get the real flavor of 4 how rural we are in the 31st Congressional District. 5 At the same time, we've got thousands 6 of manufacturing companies in the District. And 7 those thousands of manufacturing companies are in 8 need of strong representation as the rural nature of 9 the District and the farming aspects of the Districts 10 are as well. 11 So, there's a real economic viability 12 issue for both of us in manufacturing when we talk 13 about what's going to happen in this redistricting. 14 Again, without referring to a particular Congressman, 15 I'm just fearful of the fact that we would end up in 16 the western end of the District, considered to be 17 part of an urban or suburban addition to a 18 Congressional map when, in fact, the Southern Tier 19 has a significant sense of self, much more so than 20 Jamestown would have with Buffalo, or with Hamburg, 21 or West Seneca, or somewhere into an urban or 22 suburban aspect of western New York. 23 The Southern Tier, whether it's rural 24 or semi-urban, with Jamestown and Corning and Dunkirk 25 and a number of the other smaller cities of the 0070 1 Southern Tier, we have a real concern that those of 2 us that are in manufacturing would lose our ability 3 to have an effective voice with whomever is 4 representing us in Washington, if we could get thrown 5 in with an urban or suburban mix of representation, 6 where we become far out at the end of the table. 7 And so, as I try and voice the 8 expression of those of us who are in manufacturing in 9 the Southern Tier, I think the character of the 10 District now works for us. A different character 11 would be problematic for us. We don't feel that it 12 would be strengthening us in our attempt at 13 continuing to do business. 14 And I think that that's another point 15 that I would just like to make in that this used to 16 be the area certainly known as the Appalachian area 17 of New York State. We were the 13 counties that were 18 included, or we were part of the 13 counties included 19 in the Appalachian Regional Program. And there was a 20 reason for that. And this area has stayed in a 21 struggle significantly, and our abilities to continue 22 to prosper partly is going to be the result of having 23 somebody that we can appeal -- that's going to be a 24 strong representation for that the character of the 25 District that currently exists. 0071 1 It doesn't matter to me who that person 2 is. I'm we're not here advocating Amo, although I 3 think Amo has done a magnificent job. That's not my 4 position. My position is that the character of the 5 District works for the Southern Tier much better 6 between Jamestown and Corning than it would be 7 between Jamestown and Lackawanna. 8 FROM THE PANEL: In your former 9 position as Director of Economic Development for 10 Chautauqua County - I'm not sure of the title of it - 11 nevertheless, what you did as Director of Economic 12 Development for Chautauqua County, when you attempted 13 to form coalitions to Albany or Washington, could you 14 describe those coalitions? Did those coalitions ever 15 include communities such as Buffalo or Rochester? 16 MR. DAWSON: Well, occasionally, but we 17 are always viewed as the step-child or something 18 worse when we were thrown in with Erie County or 19 Monroe County. And I think that is -- I'm not 20 certainly denigrating their viewpoints. I'm just 21 saying it's a fact of political life that when you're 22 the small kid on the block, you just don't carry too 23 much weight. 24 And the coalitions that you principally 25 formed, whether it was working with yourself and 0072 1 others and Amo to complete the Southern Tier 2 Expressway in the Western District, it was this 3 longitudinal approach of forming coalitions that 4 happened nine out of ten times as opposed to the 5 vertical approach. You know, our viewpoint on the 6 vertical approach in Western New York is the 7 building's safer, and that's about as far as it gets. 8 FROM THE PANEL: And when you were 9 lobbying for transportation activities such as the 10 Southern Tier Expressway, did you attach a higher 11 priority to the Corning Bypass than to Route 219? 12 MR. DAWSON: Yes. 13 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. 14 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. Howard 15 Howlett. 16 MR. HOWARD HOWLETT, LOCAL HEALTH CARE 17 REPRESENTATIVE: Good morning. I'm from Jamestown, 18 New York by the way of Detroit Michigan and Buffalo, 19 New York. I worked for General Motors of Buffalo as 20 a new car merchant manager for Chevrolet, covering 21 basically the Southern Tier, Buffalo and Rochester. 22 I've got to tell you, gentlemen, 23 there's a big difference between Buffalo, Rochester, 24 and the Southern Tier. Jamestown, Corning, Elmira, 25 Binghamton, we're all the same. It's character of 0073 1 our areas that makes us totally different from 2 Buffalo, Rochester, and Syracuse. 3 Since being out of the automobile 4 business, I'm in health care. I'm a trustee of 5 W.C.A. Hospital in Jamestown. I'm on the Board of 6 the Health Care Trustees of the State of New York, 7 and I'm on the Committee of the Governor's American 8 Hospital Association. I spend a great deal of time 9 in Albany and in Washington. 10 Look at health care. What's going on 11 in Southern Tier, down Interstate 86, all the 12 hospitals were the same. When 50 to 70 percent of 13 our revenue comes from the government, be it Medicaid 14 or Medicare, we need to have representation that 15 understands, eats, sleeps, and lives the character of 16 the Southern Tier. 17 I'll give you some examples. I'm also 18 chairman of a Medivac ambulance service. We fly 19 helicopters. We had a problem with a bill. We went 20 to our representative in Washington who got a bill 21 through, that understand what a flight car was. I'm 22 not picking on Long Island, but most people in Long 23 Island don't understand what a flight car is. The 24 ambulance service, they don't understand the distance 25 that we travel. 0074 1 Now, if I looked into Rochester, 2 Genesee is going out of business and closing its 3 doors, a large hospital in Rochester. Go to 4 Syracuse, Crouse-Irving's filed bankruptcy. What 5 would happen down here if one of our hospitals 6 closed? Your representatives, your constituents 7 would have to travel a hundred miles to go to a 8 hospital. That's not the way it should be. 9 With proper representation in Albany 10 and Washington, we can tell our story on health care. 11 If we have to sell our story on the character and how 12 rural this District is, you'll waste half your time. 13 Believe me, New York City, Manhattan, they do not 14 understand what the hospitals go through in this 15 District. And I can tell you from traveling on 16 health care across the country, there aren't many 17 districts that have Phil Thomas (phonetic spelling), 18 who was in charge of the Health Care Committee of 19 Ways And means is now Chairman of Ways and Means, not 20 many people got him to come to their District, to 21 travel and understand what we're all about. 22 It's our character. I can walk down 23 the street in Jamestown, and I can say hello to the 24 person next to me, and they'll say it back. If I do 25 that in Detroit, you're going to call 911. That's 0075 1 the difference in the rural area. You go into any of 2 our hospitals here, and you don't see armed guards 3 standing at the doors. Yet, we still have the same 4 problems down here in recruiting teachers. 5 I can tell you in Jamestown, we just 6 recruited a gentlemen from Duke University who moved 7 to Jamestown and loves it. It's the character that 8 they like. Another one just came in from Toledo, 9 Ohio. She thinks she's died and gone to heaven, even 10 in the wintertime; didn't mind the snow. 11 So, it's the character that makes up 12 the District. You can talk all about the numbers. 13 I'm not a politician. I'm not a Constitutional 14 person. I don't remember hearing about you had to 15 have X numbers, because I go to Montana and I don't 16 see that many numbers in a District. Senator Conrad 17 doesn't have as many people. So, I don't understand 18 the number of people. It's keeping a District's 19 character together that's more important than your 20 numbers. 21 MR. SKELOS: Let me just explain the 22 numbers to you. 23 Under the Supreme Court decision, each 24 District other than states that do not have enough 25 for two complete Districts, every Congressional 0076 1 District in New York State has to be, by population, 2 exactly the same. To show you how much we have to 3 define it, again, I was a Co-Chair ten years ago when 4 we did the redistricting. If there's a deviation of 5 one person, one in this Congressional District, not 6 100, not 1,000, in the State Legislature it's 7 permissible to have deviations in the Senate, but 8 because of the experience of law, court decisions 9 from Washington, when it comes to Congressional 10 Districts, they have to be exactly the same. 11 Now, it doesn't mean you don't take 12 into account the nature we're talking about of 13 opposing districts, but I just have to point out the 14 number-one thing that drives us in Congressional 15 redistricting is the one-person/one-vote. 16 MR. HOWLETT: Again, sir, I totally 17 agree with that in theory, but I'm not --. 18 FROM THE PANEL: Well, you can argue 19 with the Supreme Court, but that's what they told us. 20 MR. HOWLETT: If you'll look at the 21 character of the districts, that's more important. 22 When you're talking about recruiting people in for 23 manufacturing, be it Corning Glass Works, this other 24 gentlemen, we recruit doctors all the time. How do 25 we get them here? It's not because we have the only 0077 1 hospital in the world. They like the character of 2 the territory. That's why they move here, that's why 3 they stay here. 4 And I think it's vital that when you do 5 the redistricting, you try to keep the character of 6 the districts the same. Whether you add 50 miles 7 this way, that's one thing. We are not the same as 8 Rochester, we're not the same as Syracuse, and we're 9 certainly not the same as Buffalo. And I think 10 that's something that really has to be looked at. 11 Thank you. 12 FROM THE PANEL: In this hospital area, 13 we have established distinctions between rural and 14 urban. And I don't always understand quite where my 15 hospitals fall in that, but I know because of your 16 experience in this field, that you are very aware of 17 these distinctions. Is it the case that all of the 18 hospitals in the current 31st Congressional District 19 would be characterized, for Federal purposes, as 20 rural? 21 MR. HOWLETT: Correct. 22 FROM THE PANEL: That's correct. 23 MR. HOWLETT: Right. It falls under 24 the M.S.A., Municipal Statistic Average program. If 25 you're in that, you're not rural. Under the Federal 0078 1 Rules, if you are rural by State definition, which 2 thank you gentlemen, you all did last year, if you're 3 rural by State definition, you can fall under the 4 rural under the Medicaid. 5 If you're urban, which is basically the 6 suburban areas, then you can't fall under a rural. 7 The differential is in the reimbursement system, 8 whereas the rurals get less then the urban people; 9 especially, the wage index area of the reimbursement 10 system. I mean, like Jamestown relates at the rate 11 of Texas when it comes to how low are rates are, 12 versus what they are in Buffalo. 13 The question I have: Is it going to 14 stay the same when you're talking about a change in 15 administration? 16 Senator Tommy Thompson from Wisconsin 17 is head of the Health Care Plan System, redoing the 18 Medicare plan. And they're saying, \"I'm going to put 19 in more money to the rural health care systems,\" such 20 as ours that we currently are. If we become part of 21 Syracuse, Rochester or Buffalo, we will not be rural. 22 And I know somebody used the word 23 \"stepchild\" or something. That's what we will 24 become. And I'm going to tell you right now that the 25 rural hospitals in the State of New York cannot 0079 1 afford to take another hit like we did under the 2 Balanced Budget Act and survive. And rural people in 3 rural New York when they go for health care, if we're 4 cut out of the rural dollars, those dollars go for 5 medical education to New York City. 6 FROM THE PANEL: And so, your opinion 7 would be that if we were adding to the current 31st 8 District, it would be preferable that that hospital 9 be a rural hospital, so that it would be -- 10 MR. HOWLETT: So, that there's no 11 questions --. 12 FROM THE PANEL: -- similar to the 13 existing grouping of hospitals? 14 MR. HOWLETT: Yeah, so that there's no 15 question that we're not a rural hospital when you're 16 coming up with more rural dollars for health care. I 17 mean, that's vital for the health care people in this 18 part of the State. We have rural health care 19 networks. Genesee has a competitor called Strong. 20 We don't have competitors. We work together to 21 improve the health of our community. We work 22 together for better quality of health care. If we 23 can recruit a doctor to Jamestown we don't 24 necessarily need, through the Chautauqua Health 25 Network we automatically get a hold of the other 0080 1 three hospitals to see if they need it. 2 So, we all work together. We're not 3 competitors like you are in the metro area. 4 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. The next 5 appearing is AARP representative Fran Weeks. Are you 6 here? 7 All right. Thomas Rutan, 8 Vice-President at Elmira College. 9 MR. THOMAS RUTAN, VICE-PRESIDENT, 10 ELMIRA COLLEGE: One of the disadvantages of being 11 eighth, ninth, or tenth on the list is THAT you're 12 bound to hear repetition. I do subscribe to the 13 theory of if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing. 14 So, I will do my work at overdoing. 15 While I am personally and emotionally 16 charged concerning the retention of the 31st 17 Congressional District, I would like to offer 18 concrete rational reasons for retention of the 19 District. 20 Firstly, the 31st Congressional 21 District maintains a balance of representation of a 22 large geographic area with no overwhelming 23 concentration of population, no large metro areas; 24 it's rural to semi-urban. And all in all, in terms 25 of industry, agriculture and size, the District is 0081 1 very unique and special in terms of opportunities and 2 problems. 3 Number two, the opinion is bipartisan, 4 but I have found and read and seen and supported 5 retaining the District. Should the District be 6 broken up, meaning in thirds or what have you, and 7 then patched to the bigger city, there's a little 8 possibility, or very little possibility, very remote, 9 that any representative of any one of those Southern 10 Tier areas that were broken into, that representative 11 would ever be elected other than the big city. 12 The District to me is much more than a 13 community, and it's been mentioned many times. My 14 primary occupation is I'm Vice-President of Elmira 15 College. I'm also on a few boards of companies, and 16 I am a consultant to the small businesses. And the 17 only reason I bring that up is that that is integral 18 to this area, and I have worked with a lot of small 19 companies. 20 In any event, there are only eleven 21 colleges. None of them are large. There is only one 22 very large corporation, and that's Corning, of 23 course. But there is a multitude of small companies. 24 There is a wealth of hospitals, treatment centers and 25 not-for-profits, and none are large. There is high 0082 1 agricultural activity, but no big, huge, monstrous 2 corporate farms. There are many museums, cultural 3 attractions, tourism, with none focused 4 geographically in a high-population-density area. To 5 me, the 31st District at present reflects what is 6 right and just with equal representation. 7 Should the people of the 31st District 8 be split and placed within a District of a very high 9 population center, the plethora of smaller 10 institutions, companies and political subdivisions, 11 would be second fiddle to the big city of the new 12 District. 13 As presently constructed, with the 14 addition of 78,000 people to bring the District up to 15 a minimum, the 31st District would retain its 16 uniqueness and retain, with equal representation, 17 without that overshadowing of a massive population 18 center. Worst of all, I am deeply concerned that 19 this area would be completely lost in the shuffle, 20 which would be a terrible loss. 21 Basically, I appeal to you, and I 22 understand it's a very difficult task. I appeal to 23 your sense of fair and just representation in 24 government, and urge you to preserve the 31st 25 Congressional District. 0083 1 That concludes my remarks; however, I 2 do realize that you will probably ask me a question: 3 What would I do to increase the size and pick up the 4 additional population? And my first reaction would 5 be to take a band and go across the top of the 6 District. And if that weren't sufficient, I would 7 take something on the smaller end of the east 8 preserving that east/west. 9 And I appreciate the opportunity for 10 having the opportunity to express some brief comments 11 to you. 12 FROM THE PANEL: Yes, you mentioned 13 that there were many colleges in the current 31st 14 District. Are there communities north or east of the 15 current District that would have colleges similar to 16 Elmira College that would be a logical fit for small 17 community colleges? 18 MR. RUTAN: Not really to the east. 19 Certainly, in Broome County, which I would not 20 suggest, there is the State University. To the 21 north, there would probably be two or three, but I'm 22 not quite sure geographically where they slot in. 23 FROM THE PANEL: The junior college is 24 currently in the District? 25 MR. RUTAN: Yes, sir. 0084 1 FROM THE PANEL: Probably similar in 2 size to Elmira? 3 MR. RUTAN: Yes, it is. 4 FROM THE PANEL: Probably the largest 5 college in the 31st would be Bonaventure? 6 MR. RUTAN: Yes, it would. There are 7 approximately 2,600. And, again, with the one 8 exception of Corning, I think industry, whether 9 education, whether it's industry or tourism, there is 10 no overriding single dominating type industry or what 11 have you. 12 FROM THE PANEL: Do you have an 13 association of colleges in the region that would be 14 represented by going to Washington or Albany? 15 MR. RUTAN: Not in the region. There 16 is the Independent College of New York, which Elmira, 17 Cornell, and both ones that we have mentioned belong 18 to, all the independent ones. And there is 19 legislative action from them within the State of New 20 York; not too much in Washington. There is a 21 national C.I.C.U., College of Independent Colleges 22 and Universities, who help lobby for different types 23 of legislation, less paperwork, et cetera, et cetera. 24 FROM THE PANEL: Would you see a 25 disadvantage to a District that had included within 0085 1 it a large university? 2 MR. RUTAN: Well, let me give you an 3 analogy. I'm not sure I know the answer to that 4 question. Elmira College was established in 1855, 5 almost 150 years ago. And up until three years ago, 6 we have never received one Federal grant. 7 Unfortunately, we were able to effect one two or 8 three years ago. 9 Cornell, for example, has over two 10 hundred in a year. Now, whether or not that one or 11 two per year might change, I doubt it. I suppose the 12 best way I can put this is that if someone gave a 13 donation of $1 million to Harvard University, or 14 Princeton, or Stanford, what have you, that would be 15 a very magnanimous gift. However, it wouldn't change 16 the numbers very much, because their endowments are 17 in the billions, or hundreds of billions. If someone 18 gave the colleges in the 31st District $1 million, 19 they'd make a significant impact on that institution. 20 Now, what has that got to do with the 21 District? It's comparable that if the Federal 22 government were to give the system - and I'm not 23 looking for giveaways - assistance, the smaller ones, 24 it has a huge impact. A $100-million grant to 25 certain institutions, even though it's a huge number, 0086 1 it's not that big. If somebody gave me a $100 2 million, I would have to call 911 because I couldn't 3 handle it. 4 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you. Mr. Rutan, 5 I don't mean to put you on the spot, but we've heard 6 a chunk of the testimony today, so I'm going to sort 7 of use you as cumulative. If you look at the 8 Congressional redistricting that was done by Senator 9 Skelos in this commission ten years ago, what in 10 essence happened is - and there's a number of ways to 11 interpret this, but I'll tell you how I interpret it 12 - they, in essence, drew a circle around Rochester 13 and Monroe County. They took most of Erie County and 14 the city of Buffalo, created Congressional Districts 15 there, and then drew longitudinal Districts that 16 reflect the more rural character of the Southern 17 Tier, the central Finger Lakes, and then the southern 18 shore of Lake Ontario. 19 Is it your testimony today that if you 20 had to do it that way, given that we have to create 21 fewer Districts, and given the fact that the number 22 we take from some we've got to take back, everything 23 is independent, is it your testimony today that I 24 think maybe the people in this room don't do that 25 again; take the big cities, put Congressional 0087 1 Districts to the cities and suburbs, and allow the 2 rural character of Western New York to be reflected 3 in one, two, three, however many Districts; is that 4 the right way to do it? 5 MR. RUTAN: I would say yes. 6 Personally, and the testimony that I've heard, some 7 people would say annex Tioga County; some say leave 8 Tioga with Broome County. And all of those are 9 probably valid. But I think the overwhelming thing 10 is -- in fact, the gentlemen that just precede me, 11 the two of them were talking about the culture, the 12 uniqueness of an area, and I think that's very, very, 13 very important to maintain. 14 FROM THE PANEL: Even at the rural 15 District? 16 MR. RUTAN: It's a common denominator 17 that counts. 18 FROM THE PANEL: Thank you very much. 19 MR. RUTAN: Thank you. 20 MR. TOMMY ROGUE, YOUTH WORKER: I'm 21 Tommy Rogue, from Chautauqua County. I'm the 22 Director and Founder of the 2XL Program (phonetic 23 spelling). 24 This is all new to me. I grew up up 25 here. And when I grew up up here, when I first came 0088 1 to Dunkirk, New York, it was perilous, I mean, a 2 rural area. I came from a big city. I came from New 3 York City. Compared to New York City to where I'm at 4 now, you can't compare the two. There's no 5 comparison to it. 6 I understand the numbers that I just 7 heard you talk about, but this is a unique part of 8 this State. Most of the kids that I deal with as 9 well, we started gradually in the program. The 10 reason why I started with these kids was these kids 11 would have the potential to do great things, but 12 they'"
