        "text": "We designed this website to provide ready access to information and opportunities for League members and partners, as well as to the wider community college field. Individual accounts ease the process of registering for League events, submitting manuscripts, participating in community groups, accessing publications, making online purchases, and, if your college is an iStream institution, accessing iStream content.\n\nIf you have been involved with the League in any way in the past (i.e., event participant, award recipient, manuscript submitter, etc.), you already have a League account. If you do not know your log in credentials, click on \"Forgot Password?\" at the top of this page to request your account information. Use your college email address rather than the \"Customer ID\" or \"User Name\" fields. You will then receive an email with your username and a link to reset your password.\n\nIf you are new to the League, you will need to create an account. Start by finding your institution below.\n\nAfter you have created an account, you will be able to log in and out at the top, right corner of any League Web page. To personalize your League account, click on the Personalize Your Account button to the right.\n\niStream Subscribers\n\nThe Leagueâ€™s website now includes an improved iStream experience. When you log in to the website, the system recognizes you as an iStream subscriber and provides you automatic access to premium iStream content. Only iStream subscribers have access to items with an iStream logo next to the title."
