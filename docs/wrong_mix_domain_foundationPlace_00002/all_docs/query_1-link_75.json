Wireless infrastructure becomes the strongest first line of defense with ETA and SD-Access. The controllers come with built-in security: runtime defenses, image signing, and integrity verification. Cisco Advanced Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (awIPS) is a complete wireless security solution that uses the Cisco Unified Access infrastructure to detect, locate, mitigate, and contain wired and wireless rogues and threats.\n\nDeploy anywhere\n\nWhether in a public or private cloud, the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL wireless controllers can be deployed anywhere for wireless everywhere. The 9800-CL meets the needs of your branch and campus network deployments.\n\nOpen and programmable\n\nThe controllers are built on the Cisco IOS XE operating system, which offers a rich set of open standards-based programmable APIs and model-driven telemetry that provide an easy way to automate day-0 to day-N network operations.\n\nKey specifications\n\nTable 2.Key specifications\n\nBenefits\n\nCisco IOS XE opens a completely new paradigm in network configuration, operation, and monitoring through network automation. Cisco’s automation solution is open, standards-based, and extensible across the entire lifecycle of a network device. The various mechanisms that bring about network automation are outlined below, based on a device lifecycle.\n\n●Automated device provisioning: This is the ability to automate the process of upgrading software images and installing configuration files on Cisco access points when they are being deployed in the network for the first time. Cisco provides turnkey solutions such as Plug and Play (PnP) that enable an effortless and automated deployment.\n\n●API-driven configuration: Modern wireless controllers such the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud support a wide range of automation features and provide robust open APIs over Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) using YANG data models for external tools, both off-the-shelf and custom built, to automatically provision network resources.\n\n●Granular visibility: Model-driven telemetry provides a mechanism to stream data from a wireless controller to a destination. The data to be streamed is driven through subscription to a data set in a YANG model. The subscribed data set is streamed out to the destination at configured intervals. Additionally, Cisco IOS XE enables the push model, which provides near-real-time monitoring of the network, leading to quick detection and rectification of failures.\n\n●Seamless software upgrades and patching: To enhance OS resilience, Cisco IOS XE supports patching, which provides fixes for critical bugs and security vulnerabilities between regular maintenance releases. This support allows customers to add patches without having to wait for the next maintenance release.\n\nAlways on\n\n●High availability: Stateful switchover with a 1:1 active standby and N+1 redundancy keeps your network, services, and clients always on, even in unplanned events.\n\n●Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs) with hot and cold patching: Patching allows for a patch to be installed as a bug fix without bringing down the entire network and eliminates the need to requalify an entire software image. The SMU is a package that can be installed on a system to provide a patch fix or security resolution to a released image. SMUs allow you to address the network issue quickly while reducing the time and scope of the testing required. The Cisco IOS XE platform internally validates the SMU compatibility and does not allow you to install incompatible SMUs. All SMUs are integrated into the subsequent Cisco IOS XE Software maintenance releases.\n\n●Intelligent rolling access point upgrades and seamless multisite upgrades: The Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud comes equipped with intelligent rolling access point upgrades to simplify network operations. Multisite upgrades can now be done in stages, and access points can be upgraded intelligently without restarting the entire network.\n\n●Standby monitoring of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Wireless Controllers in High-Availability (HA) mode: This enables monitoring of the health of the system on a standby controller in a HA pair using programmatic interfaces (NETCONF/YANG, RESTCONF) and CLIs without going through the active controller. For more details refer to technical documentation.\n\n●In-Service Software Upgrade (ISSU): ISSU is a complete image upgrade/update with zero downtime while the network is still on. The software image or a patch is pushed onto the wireless controller while traffic forwarding continues uninterrupted. All AP/client sessions are retained during the upgrade process.\n\nWith just a click, your network automatically upgrades to the newest software. Your backup Catalyst 9800 controller receives the new software that is pushed via the active 9800 controller. The backup 9800 controller becomes active controller and takes over your network while your previously active 9800 turns into a backup 9800 controller and processes the software upgrade. Using an intelligent RF-based rolling access-point upgrade, all access points are upgraded in a staggered fashion, without impacting any wireless session. This procedure is carried out without any manual intervention natively from the controller, and without the need for an external orchestrator or additional licenses.\n\nSecurity\n\n●Encrypted Traffic Analytics (ETA): ETA is a unique capability for identifying malware in encrypted traffic coming from the access layer. Since more and more traffic is being encrypted, the visibility this feature provides related to threat detection is critical for keeping your network secure at different layers. This feature is supported on private cloud deployments only.\n\n●Cisco Wireless Intrusion Prevention System (WIPS): WIPS offers advanced network security to detect, locate, mitigate, and contain any intrusion and threat on your wireless network. It can monitor and detect wireless network anomalies, unauthorized access, and RF attacks. A new dedicated classification engine for rogue and aWIPS built on Cisco DNA Center. A fully integrated stack for WIPS solution includes Cisco DNA Center, Cisco Catalyst 9800 controller, Wave2, and Catalyst 9100 Access Points. This new architecture provides improved detection and security, simplicity and ease of use, and a reduction in false-positive alarms.\n\n●Trustworthy systems: Cisco Trust Anchor Technologies provide a highly secure foundation for Cisco products. With the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL, these trustworthy systems help assure software authenticity for supply chain trust and strong mitigation against man-in-the-middle attacks on software and firmware. Trust Anchor capabilities include:\n\n◦Image signing: Cryptographically signed images provide assurance that the firmware, BIOS, and other software are authentic and unmodified. As the system boots, its software signatures are checked for integrity.\n\nFlexible NetFlow\n\n●Flexible NetFlow (FNF): Cisco IOS FNF is the next generation in flow visibility technology, allowing optimization of the network infrastructure, reducing operating costs, and improving capacity planning and security incident detection with increased flexibility and scalability.\n\nApplication Visibility and Control\n\n●Next-Generation Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR2): NBAR2 enables advanced application classification techniques, with up to 1400 predefined and well-known application signatures and up to 150 encrypted applications on the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL. Some of the most popular applications included are Skype, Office 365, Microsoft Lync, Cisco Webex, and Facebook. Many others are already predefined and easy to configure. NBAR2 provides the network administrator with an important tool to identify, control, and monitor end-user application usage while helping ensure a quality user experience and secure the network from malicious attacks. It uses FNF to report application performance and activities within the network to any supported NetFlow collector, such as Cisco Prime, Stealthwatch, or any compliant third-party tool.\n\nQuality of service\n\n●Superior Quality of Service (QoS): QoS technologies are tools and techniques for managing network resources and are considered the key enabling technologies for the transparent convergence of voice, video, and data networks. QoS on the Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL consists of classification of traffic based on packet data as well as application recognition and traffic control actions such as dropping, marking and policing. A modular QoS command-line framework provides consistent platform-independent and flexible configuration behavior. The 9800-CL, also, supports policies at two levels of target: BSSID as well as client. Policy assignment can be granular down to the client level.\n\nSmart operation\n\n●WebUI: WebUI is an embedded GUI-based device-management tool that provides the ability to provision the device, simplifying device deployment and manageability and enhancing the user experience. WebUI comes with the default image. There is no need to enable anything or install any license on the device. You can use WebUI to build a day-0 and day-1 configuration and from then on monitor and troubleshoot the device without having to know how to use the CLI.\n\nSpecifications\n\nTable 3.Specifications\n\nSoftware requirements\n\nThe Cisco Catalyst 9800-CL Wireless Controller for Cloud runs on Cisco IOS XE Software version 16.10.1 or later.
