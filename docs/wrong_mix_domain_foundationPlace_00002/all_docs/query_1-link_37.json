        "text": "Scientists in the past thought that for three rogue waves of 20m or higher to occur it would need more than 24,000 years; Yet, today scientists know that a rogue wave can occur in 24 hours. Scientists have also discussed about freak waves, which are similarly dangerous, as they appear without a warning and have caused many vessels to sink.\n\nThe MS Munchen vessel was sailing through the Atlantic, which at that time was one of the newest, most modern carriers of its time and was thought to be ‘unsinkable’.\n\nYet, the vessel was lost and then began the biggest search and rescue operation; For one week the UK, US, Portugal and Germany searched the ocean for a sign, whereas more than 100 cargo vessels operating in that area participated in the search.\n\nOne week later, the 260-metre vessel and the 28 crewmembers were nowhere to be found.\n\nBased on the investigation report the unusually large wash of water shattered the windows of the bridge and killed the electronics. The resulting loss of manoeuvrability, probably ultimately resulted in the sinking of the ship.\n\nThe idea of rogue wave was then born.\n\nMany were the seamen that said to have fought with rogue waves, explaining that these waves were bigger than any wave surrounding them, were almost vertical, insurmountable walls of water.\n\nAlthough there weren’t many to ‘tell the tale’ concerning rogue waves, scientists often dismissed these stories.\n\n‘Draupner E’ oil rig\n\nAfter the construction of ‘Draupner E’ oil rig in 1994, 100 miles off Norway, a technology was installed for the safety of the workers onboard, which was used to track the frequency and height of the waves below.\n\nBased on the tracking evidence, it was later confirmed the first confirmed measurement of a rogue wave. So, scientists finally had to acknowledge their existence.\n\nRogue waves explained\n\nIn addition to the above, the video provides an explanation on the terms ‘Monster Wave’, ‘Freak wave’ and ‘Rogue wave’.\n\nRogue waves: They are surface waves, mostly formed in the open ocean and are considerably higher and steeper than the surrounding waves. To be defined as rogue waves, they have to be higher than the average swells at the time. They are commonly divided into three categories;\n\n#1 Single waves\n\n#2 Wall of water\n\n#3 Three sisters\n\nIn the meantime, the video also refers to the term ‘long holes’, that they are put in the inverse of rogue waves, extreme troughs more than twice as deep as the surrounding ones. Yet, they seem to be a lot rarer."
