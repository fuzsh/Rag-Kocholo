Selection and navigation commands, such as panning and zooming, are pseudocommands. This is a flag that is statically defined for each command and not a parameter, since, depending on the application, you may consider actions, such as zooming, to be real commands. (A real command is one whose result is to be saved with the file.)\n\nTypically, this flag is used by IlvModifiedFlagObserver to determine whether the document corresponding to a given command history should be considered as modified or not."
