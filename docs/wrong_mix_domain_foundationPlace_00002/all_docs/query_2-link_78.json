I even bought their CD because I love their sound and style (and they're great live too. Saw them at the SD's 94.9 Holiday Hootenanny @ UCSD).\n\nTheir songs sound very folk-sy (a bit like Simon and Garfunkle?) too.\n\nI like the melody and style, but I can't enjoy a song if I can't understand it.\n\nFrom what I gather, it's a pro-environment song? Or is it just a mash of words? lol. Well, the song that goes on before this is \"Chicago x12.\" Maybe they're related? Doubt it though. Chicago x 12 sounds more like they've been on tour for awhile and they get mellow/lonely by the time they reach Chicago on their tour.. more like Chicago hates them haha.\n\nThe pro environment sounds a bit like it.. as if to say that earth/heaven/air got the short end of the deal, and this is very apparent in Lake Michigan. Combined w/ Chicago x 12, it sounds like they reminisce about Chicago's older days; before a polluted Lake Michigan where; a time when they felt more accepted I guess. blah!\n\nOriginally posted by: KeithTalent\n\nhttp://www.songmeanings.net/ly...id=3530822107858685114\n\nKT\n\nalready saw that. was hoping to find something from the band members themselves, but my search skills fail me. I was remotely hoping for someone to see if they had a link to a bandmember on what the hell they meant.\n\nUsually, even songs w/ lyrics that make no sense (kind of like hotel california, and phantom limb) have very simple interpretations. That site has full of comments of people trying to over analyze haha.\n\nLook @ their comments for \"Hospital Beds\" by the cold war kids. lol. It's over-analyzed by wannabe elitists, when it was mentioned by the lead singer that it's just about a dude in a hospital bed w/ a terminal illness who makes an unlikely friend w/ someone who just happened to be laying next to him at the hospital. nothing more, nothing less.\n\nwell, in that context...all i can see from this song is that they're just reminiscing of the better past. Just some weird twisted way to put it ...\n\nWell, one of the comments I did agree with. It was the dude who said the guys just got a bunch of words and made a song. It really doesn't mean anything. haha. I want to agree."
