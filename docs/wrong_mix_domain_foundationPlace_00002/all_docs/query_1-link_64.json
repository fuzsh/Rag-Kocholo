        "text": "摘要： The nonlinear Schrödinger equation is a classical integrable equation which contains plenty of significant properties and occurs in many physical areas. However, due to the difficulty of solving this equation, in particular in high dimensions, lots of methods are proposed to effectively obtain different kinds of solutions, such as neural networks among others. Recently, a method where some underlying physical laws are embeded into a conventional neural network is proposed to uncover the equation's dynamical behaviors from spatiotemporal data directly. Compared with traditional neural networks, this method can obtain remarkably accurate solution with extraordinarily less data. Meanwhile, this method also provides a better physical explanation and generalization. In this paper, based on the above method, we present an improved deep learning method to recover the soliton solutions, breather solution, and rogue wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In particular, the dynamical behaviors and error analysis about the one-order and two-order rogue waves of nonlinear integrable equations are revealed by the deep neural network with physical constraints for the first time.
