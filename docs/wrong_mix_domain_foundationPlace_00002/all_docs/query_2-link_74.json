I was able to get into it, upgrade it to the latest firmware (not terribly new due to being an older board). On the boat at the marina I'm getting about 3MB download speed on my laptop and devices on their wifi, where the Rogue Wave is getting about 1Mbit and it's very inconsistent (randomly dropping off the wifi, etc).\n\nI contacted their support and was told it was too high and needs to be brought to a lower point on the boat. My top mast height is 67 feet. They are suggesting the POE injector degrades with longer than 50 feet of CAT5 cable. Their suggestion was to bring it down and test at a lower height. Obviously not a super easy option.\n\nAny thoughts or suggestion on a path forward? Should I try and get this thing brought down and test it? It's a 3 year old model that can't get new firmware upgrades. Should I go pick up a Ubiquity Bullet and antenna and mount it on the spreader? Is the \"too high a problem\" a fair statement? Usually on boats you don't hear too high for an antenna being a problem.\n\nThanks in advance for any help!\n\nJim\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Mar 2018\n\nBoat: Mahe 36\n\nPosts: 7\n\nRe: Rogue Wave and Wifi systems\n\nNetwork Engineer here. I looked at their Quick Start Guide and they do say not to go over 60 feet of cable, so they must be aware of some limitations of their product. I see that it is only a 12v device, so that is likely where the limitation lies. You're pretty much stuck with only being able to validate that issue by pulling it down from your mast. They are recommending to bring it lower only to shorten the cable length. If you got the Ubiquiti Bullet with the 24v POE adapter, you should be able to get 300ft cable length and put it at the top of your mast if you want. Or put it somewhere more accessible and see how it works out for you. Any external antenna would yield better results than your internal laptop antenna, so you definitely have an issue with your Rogue setup.\n\nScott\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Jun 2008\n\nPosts: 316\n\nRe: Rogue Wave and Wifi systems\n\nHeight doesn't necessarily benefit a Wi-Fi antenna the same way it does other applications, especially in a marina environment. The effective range of most access points is pretty short and their antennas are generally low. Depending on the beam width of the respective antennas, the antenna on your mast could fail to get a good signal from one on the dock next to the boat. But the masthead antenna will definitely get more 2.4GHz noise from faraway transmitters than it would at deck level. My Wi-Fi antenna is 12 feet off the water, while my VHF and cellular antennas are at the top of the mast.\n\nIf you do get a new unit, make sure you get a dual band one that can do 5GHz as well.\n\nRegistered User\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2014\n\nPosts: 7,553\n\nRe: Rogue Wave and Wifi systems\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by JayH\n\nHeight doesn't necessarily benefit a Wi-Fi antenna the same way it does other applications, especially in a marina environment.

I had a similar issue when attending one of my company's Board of Director meetings in New York a couple of years ago. It was held at the private condominium of one of the board members, which was very near the top of Trump Tower and covered about half the floor of the building, the side overlooking Central Park. Because we were so high up, none of our cell phones could obtain reception because all of the cell phone towers are oriented towards the nearby ground and towards the streets in the urban canyons, where the vast majority of the people are going about their daily business. So we were all caused to be effectively out of touch for the day, even though we were in the heart of NYC. Albeit, we enjoyed the great views while we walked around the perimeter formed of ceiling to floor windows of the massive condo trying to get reception. \"Can you hear me now? No. [Shift location, try again] Okay, can you hear me now? Nope.\" Technologically, the worst issue was that we could not hook up to the condo's private wifi network as we did not have the access password, even though it showed five bar reception, because the owner of the condo did not attend the meeting and we could not call him because we did not have mobile phone service and he was traveling and out of connectivity once we discovered his landline. The founder of our company and I being from Montana, not having cell phone or wifi reception was more like the norm, but the investor types on the board being hedge fund managers were freaking out by being disconnected. Speaking of technology challenge, each time I typed in \"Wifi\" in this reply, my computer's auto correction software or this forum's software kept substituting in the word \"Wife\". I have been blessed with only one wife, hence no Wife network to contend with, which challenge I would not be capable of."
