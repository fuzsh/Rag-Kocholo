Rogue Wave scored second-highest in the Current Offering category – which measures the relative strength of a vendor’s current API management offering – for the Akana API Platform.\n\nIn preparing the report, Forrester evaluated 15 API management vendors across 26 criteria, with the goal of helping application development and delivery professionals make the right buying decision.\n\nAkana has particularly strong API security and policy capabilities and good breadth across most all of our evaluation criteria. Its API user portal is among the most configurable and extensible.\n\nThe Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2018\n\n“We are very proud to be recognized as a Leader in API management in this Forrester Wave evaluation,” says Ian Goldsmith, vice president of Akana product management at Rogue Wave Software. “Business leaders around the world rely on Forrester’s in-depth research and analysis to inform their strategic buying decisions. In our view, this high ranking reflects the investment we continue to make in the Akana product and the team.”\n\nAPI management is a key capability for many large enterprises.

Its API user portal is among the most configurable and extensible.”\n\n“Akana’s configurable life-cycle framework continues to be a strong foundation for building mature support for a variety of federated API strategies and ecosystems. In addition, the solution’s licenses feature provides great flexibility to support different API ownership, visibility, and subscription models.”\n\nAkana provides a secure, unified platform for API management that includes analytics to generate business insight from API traffic through configurable reports. Goldsmith says, “Our clients use Akana for a variety of mission-critical functions, from processing billions of dollars in transactions – including hotel reservations, online and mobile retail sales, and credit and debit card payments – to inventory management, supply chain integration, and more.”\n\nGoldsmith elaborates on what separates Akana from other API management platforms. “Rogue Wave has a culture of continuous improvement, and since the company’s acquisition of Akana, we have invested heavily in raising the quality of the platform and our support services.
