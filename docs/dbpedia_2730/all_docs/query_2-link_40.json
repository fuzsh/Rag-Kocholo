        "text": "Last year at the Cannes Film Festival, Emir Kusturica was taking questions from the press about his new movie. The Sarajevo-born director was discussing the sorts of things he likes to discuss: why the cinema he loves is being ruined by an inhuman, mass-produced fast food coming out of Hollywood, for instance.\n\nUntil, inevitably, he was visited with a mild version of the question reporters have never failed to ask him over the last decade: During the wars that destroyed Yugoslavia in the 1990s, why didn't he come out publicly against Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader who was ravaging his homeland?\n\nKusturica, who spent most of his life in Bosnia but now lives in Serbia, is one of the most celebrated filmmakers in Europe, as festooned with awards as anyone working in cinema today. His films \"When Father Was Away on Business\" and \"Underground\" won the top prize at Cannes in 1985 and 1995, respectively. This week he returned to Cannes to serve as president of the most prestigious festival jury in the world.\n\nBut over the last 10 years, the man whom his fans see as the heir to Fellini's impassioned exuberance has been asked about his politics almost as much as his movies. And at times, he loses his patience for it. So, in Cannes: why didn't he speak up against Milosevic?\n\n\"Nobody's perfect,\" he said.\n\nWhen he's not being questioned by reporters or touring as a guitarist in his Balkan gypsy-punk-rock band, Kusturica now spends most of his time in a small village in western Serbia he has recently had constructed from scratch.\n\nHe's a tall man with a powerful chest and a potent set of shoulders, and there is an amiable menace to the way he moves; he has a reputation as a brawler and a firebrand, but, relaxing in his village, where I visited him recently, he comes off more like a gentle papa or, sometimes, a beneficent feudal lord.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
