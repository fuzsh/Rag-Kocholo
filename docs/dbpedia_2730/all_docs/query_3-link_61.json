The restoration was carried out by the NFI Hungary - Film Archive and Film Lab, in the frame of the „Long-term restoration programme of the Hungarian film heritage”. The screening in Cannes will be attended by Judit Elek and György Ráduly, Director of NFI - Film Archive.\n\nThe new 4K version of Underground was made by TF1 Studio with the support of the French CNC, based on the original negative and the original 24 tracks mix. The film is set for release in French cinemas in 2023 and it will be presented in Cannes by French distributor Malavida Films. It has not been announced if Emir Kusturica will attend the festival."
