        "text": "At the 14th Beijing International Film Festival Press Conference held on March 28, it was officially announced that Emir Kusturica, two-time winner of the Golden Palms at the Festival de Cannes and award winner at the Berlin International Film Festival and Venice International Film Festival, Serbian director, actor, screenwriter, musician and author, was appointed as the Jury President of the 14th BJIFF Tiantan Award.\n\nãã\n\nEmir Kusturica, Jury President of the 14th BJIFF Tiantan Award\n\nMixed cuts of works by Emir Kusturica\n\nTuring 70, Emir Kusturica is one of Serbian ânational treasureâ directors, and a key figure in the global cinema. His works are notably artistic and thought-provoking, intriguing, one-of-his-kind, and reflective of the diverse and complicated society and history. Throughout his eventful and exciting career, he received multiple international awards and honors, and made far-reaching contributions to the promotion of Serbian culture.\n\nãã\n\nEmir Kusturica\n\nHe was appointed as a jury member of the 46th Festival de Cannes in 1993, Jury President of the 56th Venice International Film Festival in 1999, Jury President of the 58th Festival de Cannes in 2005, Jury President of the 19th Shanghai International Film Festival in 2016, and Jury President of the 43rd Cairo International Film Festival in 2021. This year, Emir Kusturica is to serve as the Jury President of the 14th BJIFF Tiantan Award for the first time.\n\nKusturicaâs tie with the BJIFF goes way back. He addressed the 7th BJIFF Opening Ceremony, and expressed his passion for China and Chinese audience.\n\nãã\n\nKusturica addresses the Opening Ceremony of the 7th BJIFF\n\nIn the meantime, his then new film On the Milky Road was screened under the 7th BJIFF Beijing Film Panorama. Moreover, his essential film Underground receives monthly screening and a fully packed house every time among the regular screenings held at the China Film Archive, which is a major partner screening venue of the BJIFF.\n\nãã\n\nStill of On the Milky Road\n\nWhen it comes to Emir Kusturica, itâs inevitable to mention a pinnacle of the film art that he createdâUnderground. The film won the Golden Palm in Competition at the 48th Festival de Cannes in 1995, and earned wide acclaims across China with a high rating of 9.2 on Douban. With in-depth observation of history, unique narrative and stunning audiovisual presentation, Kusturica depicts the turmoil and daily life in former Yugoslavia, and reveals profound impacts of the era on individualsâ destinies.\n\nAs he once commented, âI was born in such a country where hope, laughter and joy of life are more powerful than anywhere else.â His films not only show the infatuation and ecstasy of life, and madness and misery of humanity, but also contain emotions and messages that are extremely powerful and endless.\n\nSelf-claimed âsleeplessâ, Kusturica devoted his welling wit and passion to every film. One wedding after another, constantly ongoing band performances, and various active animals in Underground and Black Cat, White Cat give a fairly revealing account of such passion. Besides, he invests his infinite artistic vitality into music. As the lead singer of the No Smoking Orchestra, he sets free his passion and vitality through rock. Kusturica even added his exuberant music to his films as thrilling continuation of the passion. Whatâs more, he led his band to perform in Shanghai in 2012, connecting Chinese and Serbian peoples through different media of art.\n\nãã\n\nStill of Underground\n\nApart from being a world class filmmaking master, Kusturica is a novelist. He bonded with Yu Hua, a very prestigious Chinese writer, over art, and has maintained a close relationship ever since. Yu Hua watched all his films, read his published novels and autobiography, and wrote a prologue to the Chinese version of his novel The Stranger in the Marriage. Yu even paid a special visit to Kusturicaâs hometown. While he recalled his gathering with Kusturica in his essay, he spoke very highly of Kusturicaâs works, showing mutual appreciation between the two minds alike.\n\nEmir Kusturica has become a shining star on in international cinema stage with his vitality, amazing works and unique interpretation of the culture and history of the Balkan Peninsula. His films are artistically successful, insightful terms of important issues such as politics, history and humanity, and deeply thought-provoking for the general public.\n\nThe Tiantan Award undoubtedly will present satisfactory review and selection results under his passionate leadership."
