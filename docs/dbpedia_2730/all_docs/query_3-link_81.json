        "text": "One of the roles in Emir Kusturica's ''Time of the Gypsies'' is played by a turkey, and the word role is not used lightly. The turkey actually plays a part. For a time, he is the pet and companion of Perhan (Davor Dujmovic), the oafish, naive and highly sensitive gypsy boy who is this coming-of-age film's hero; after that, the turkey winds up in a pot. And after that, the turkey reappears in a magical way, as one of the many omens and miracles that shape Perhan's vision of the world. Not the least of the miracles associated with this film is that it received the best director award at the Cannes Film Festival last year.\n\nMr. Kusturica, the Yugoslav film maker whose ''When Father Was Away on Business'' was a lot more appealing and less strenuous, makes use of elements any film festival jury would love. A ghostly turkey; an eerie bridal veil; a young hero who sometimes moves weightlessly from place to place and whose hidden gifts include telekinetic powers: these touches could be the source of an earthy mysticism a la the Taviani brothers (''The Night of the Shooting Stars''), but instead they remain inert. The peasant heartiness of ''Time of the Gypsies'' manages to seem forced, despite the fact that real gypsies, speaking the Romany language, play almost all the film's principal roles.\n\n''Time of the Gypsies,'' which opens today at the Regency, begins with the striking image of a very homely bride, seen tramping through the mud as she berates a husband who has already, by her lights, begun to misbehave. In the shadow of this image, another love story emerges: the budding romance between Perhan and his young sweetheart Azra (Sinolicka Trpkova), who learn how to kiss by watching romantic movies as Perhan's turkey sits helpfully beside them. Perhan's newly lovestruck manner is enough to bring tears to the eyes of the grandmother (Ljubica Adzovic) who raised him, and they are not solely tears of joy. Like other gypsy characters in the story, she is able to discern future trouble long before it arrives.\n\nThe film is roundabout and meandering as it watches Perhan grow from a sheltered country lad to a young man versed in the ways of petty crime; he learns about the latter under the tutelage of Ahmed (Bora Todorovic), who is something of a gypsy Godfather. The story leads Perhan away from his protective grandmother at home in Yugoslavia and into Italy with Ahmed and his band of beggars and thieves. Meanwhile, Azra matures, and very dramatically at that. By the end of the film, she and Perhan are married, and Perhan has a son whose lot in life eerily mirrors his own.\n\nNone of this happens quickly. And the film's momentum is not notably enhanced by the quacking and clucking of barnyard animals as they scuttle through the action, providing the local color of which Mr. Kusturica is this time far too fond. The gypsies' love of animals is part and parcel of the rollicking accordion music, muddy settings, picturesque outhouses and chattering minor characters who keep the film so busy, and do so much to slow it down. Even the more flamboyant figures, like the uncle of Perhan's who spitefully hoists the family house off its foundations on a rainy night because Perhan's grandmother refuses to give him money, begin to seem exhausting in their very spontaneity.\n\nThe performances are admirably unguarded, but they're unstructured, too. The very naturalness of someone like Miss Adzovic, who as Perhan's grandmother is more of a presence than a performer, calls for a tighter dramatic framework than Mr. Kusturica provides. As Perhan, Mr. Dujmovic has the right eagerness and intensity, but he isn't an actor who can easily hold an audience's interest for nearly two and a half hours. Mr. Todorovic, as the corrupt kingpin who is also strangely sympathetic as a family man, is one of the few players to give a performance that works on its own terms, and not solely within the context of this film's robust, turkey-fancying, highly self-conscious charm.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
