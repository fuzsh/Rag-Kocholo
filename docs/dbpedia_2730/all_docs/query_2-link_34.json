        "text": "HE is a displaced person: a Bosnian who cannot return to Bosnia, a Slav of Muslim origin who never practiced Islam, a Yugoslav patriot whose Yugoslav culture has been demolished.\n\nEmir Kusturica, the director from Sarajevo whose films have won major international awards, is living the title of his last movie, \"Time of the Gypsies.\" As he alternates residences between a room in Morningside Heights in Manhattan and an apartment in Paris, he wonders whether anything remains of his family memorabilia in his place of birth, the shattered capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nTalk pours out of him like the water of the swift-flowing rivers of his homeland; he spoke recently for a stretch of three hours in an Upper West Side cafe near Columbia University, where, with breaks for filming, he teaches film studies.\n\n\"I never wanted an independent Bosnia,\" he said of his homeland, the breakaway Yugoslav republic now engulfed by war. \"I wanted Yugoslavia. That is my country.\"\n\nHe said that for several years after Tito died in 1980, \"Yugoslavia was a kind of superpower. Great movies. Beautiful novels. Great rock-and-roll. We became a superpower in basketball.\n\n\"The problem is that people needed to identify more strongly with it after Tito and his awful, tricky way of leading the country,\" Mr. Kusturica said. \"Instead, religion got in the way through nationalism -- the same as 500 years ago -- as the main generator of emotions. At a certain moment, Yugoslavia stopped being rational, and then you end up going to war.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
