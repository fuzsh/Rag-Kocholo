        "text": "“The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.”\n\n― J. M. Barrie, Peter Pan\n\nStrangely did not feel sad at passing of Diego Maradona. Is it my new spiritual development? Nope. I just lost myself in a sea of memories and moments of unadulterated joy and watched a documentary. I love Maradona. For me Michael Jackson, Diego Maradona and Princess Diana have given maximum joy and love to the masses. I sometimes felt watching Maradona play was like watching a Carlos Santana song or concert. It was pure magic. It came from the ghettos and spread like a fire. This is close to genius we can see in a life time. I think God created Maradona as a gift to the beautiful game. Golf is for the rich and tennis is also beyond masses but football is religion cum orgy for the masses. It is the most popular sport in the world. Maradona is God. Like Clapton is God. Maradona is God. Those skills on the football field, cussedness and joy is like a child who played without a worry in the world. He was a genius. I am using the word twice or thrice and with utmost responsibility. There are few genius – Einstein is a genius.Feynman is a genius. Maradona is genius.\n\nI watched Emir Kusturica 2008 documentary on Maradona. The award winning Serbian Film maker says ” Had he not been a footballer, he would have been a revolutionary.” I agree. Maradona aware of his cocaine addiction says ” Imagine what a player would have been without cocaine. We lost him” Just imagine! If he was so good as he was with his troubles, just imagine without addiction. It blows my mind. Maradona is God of Football. I also loved his love for his daughters and says ” missed them seeing growing up” . His friendship with Fidel Castro. I also felt Foot ball is not so much a sport but an identity and a political assertion. Maradona was very self aware like all genius. He just could not control the excess in life. Kusturica says ” it was this genius on field and destructive side sans normality” that people loved him. Maradona says in the documentary ” On the field I was in total command…” Outside…..\n\nLife was difficult and also a great adventure outside. I don’t want to get into all that or the stats or ” Hand of God” goal at 86 World Cup Quaterfinals. People forget that four minutes later in the same match he scored ” Goal of the century.” – taking the ball in his own half and running 60 yards in a display of insane magic dodged and outwitted all the English players and Goal keeper Peter Shilton and put the ball into net. The greatest goal of all time with those brilliant skills in a flash of seconds. Maradona single handedly won the world cup for his nation. I had watched the world cup on Television. Life was good in 86. Maradona is God.There is also a church of Maradona!!\n\nMaradona was also brilliant for S.S.C. Napoli and according to news reports Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis wants to name stadium after Maradona. The city honored ” The King” ( Reference- CNN). Maradona was a great player for Argentinos juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla, Newell’s Old boys and national team – Argentina U 20 and Argentina. He also managed Deprovito Mandiyu, Racing Club, Al wasi, Fujariah, Dorados desinaloa, Gimnasia de La Plata and Argentina National team. His foot print was everywhere. He is God of football. I recollect he formed a good equation with other modern genius Lionel Messi when he coached the national team.\n\nHe was a good man. He played for the poor and identified with them in his beliefs. Of course genius cannot be managed. Unless he becomes mere human. He just couldn’t. He lived a thin line between life and death in his later years.\n\nWhat can i Say? Let me quote Carlos Santana from 2014 Fifa Worldcup Brazil when he was asked what it feels to perform at world cup..\n\nIt’s a great joy. I’m very grateful. I don’t play soccer myself, but what we bring is very powerful because we bring an energy that we learned a long time ago from Woodstock, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye and John Lennon. We represent all that energy. When we play we don’t lip-sync. It’s not plastic or cute. It’s not Hollywood. I’m from the ghetto, so when we play, you feel a different kind of supernatural energy. We represent so many. Not just Mexico, not just America, we represent the complete family of this planet.\n\nMore:https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/santana-messi-looks-like-a-plumber-2403961\n\nI feel same for Maradona’s football – It was supernatural and represented the whole world.\n\nI also couldn’t stop watching a beautiful video of Maradona warming up before Napoli’s UEFA Cup semi-final against Bayern Munich 1989 to Austrian band Opus – Live is life. Do check YouTube. It’s pure joy just the way he played football.\n\nMaradona also visited India – Bengal and Kerala. Both are football crazy states in India ( Standard of play is very mediocre by world standards) and he had kind words for football in country. I think Goa is planning to install a a statue in his memory.\n\nWhat can I say?\n\nFor pure joy and happiness. Maradona is God of Football. Maradona is God.\n\nGod is dead.\n\nWe will always love and cherish Diego Armando Maradona!\n\nSincerely, Suresh\n\nPS: Quotes from ” Maradona by Kusturica” mentioned in above post are not verbatim or as appears in sub titles of documentary. It carries essence of the message."
