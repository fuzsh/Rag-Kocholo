        "text": "Two-time Cannes Palme d’Or winning Serbian director Emir Kusturica will make his next movie in China, and it will be based on works 19th century Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nKusturica was quoted by the Russian online paper gazeta.ru as saying that he has signed a contract with a Chinese production company to make a movie in that country and is currently working on the script.\n\nThe Serbian magazine Blic specified that the company in question is Hong Kong based Dirty Monkey Films Group.\n\n“The film will be dealing with moral dilemmas from Dostoyevsky’s works, but they will be explored in a different environment,” Kusturica was quoted as saying by gazeta.ru.\n\n“The idea is to show the main aspects of Dostoyevsky’s works from the Chinese society’s viewpoint and thereby make the Russian classical author’s ideas closer to contemporary reality,” he went on to say.\n\nAccording to Kusturica, the yet untitled film will be set in contemporary China, with the main character being a woman who has a severe sight problem and needs expensive treatment in France.\n\nKusturica won the Palme d’Or for When Father Was Away on Business in 1985 and Underground in 1995."
