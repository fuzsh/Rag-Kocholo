        "text": "Born in Sarajevo in 1955, Emir Kusturica enrolled in the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague in 1973. In 1981, he released his debut feature film, \"Do You Remember Dolly Bell?\" which not only competed at the 38th Venice International Film Festival but also garnered accolades such as the Best First Feature Award and the FIPRESCI Prize, marking the beginning of Kusturicaâs journey as a master filmmaker.\n\nIn 1985 and 1995, Kusturica won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his films âWhen Father Was Away on Businessâ and âUnderground,â respectively.\n\nKusturica's films are renowned for their distinct style, marked by a blend of chaos, whimsy, and surrealism. Drawing inspiration from the fantastical imagery of Marc Chagallâs paintings and paying homage to classic works of cinema, Kusturica creates a unique cinematic universe that fuses elements of French elegance and Russian passion."
