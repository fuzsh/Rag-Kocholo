The Crime without Punishment will become an adaptation of the novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. The director also plans to shoot a film based on The Laurel novel by Russian writer Evgeny Vodolazkin, RIA Novosti reports.\n\nKusturica is currently completing work on a film script based on Dostoevsky’s novel. He noted that he plans to shoot the film in Russia with the participation of Russian actors.\n\nThe idea of ​​an adaptation of Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment came to Emir Kusturica 20 years ago. Hollywood actor Johnny Depp wanted to play Rodion Raskolnikov in the film, but the director refused him due to the fact that the film adaptation was supposed to be in Serbian. Depp expressed his readiness to act in any language, but Emir Kusturica is convinced that ''the root of film and literature is where they grew.''\n\nEvgeny Vodolazkin announced his intention to write a script based on his novel Laurel for the film adaptation of Kusturica.\n\nThe Serbian director arrived in Russia to participate in the first school of film criticism, which opened at the Yasnaya Polyana museum-estate in the Tula region.\n\nRusskiy Mir"
