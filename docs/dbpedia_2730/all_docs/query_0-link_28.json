        "text": "God is the only being who,\n\nin order to reign,\n\ndoesn't even need to exist.\n\n- Charles Baudelaire\n\nLadies and gentlemen!\n\nOn the guitar,\n\nsenor Diego Armando Maradona\n\nfrom the world of cinema!\n\nBuenos Aires!\n\nHow are you?\n\nThis is the song from\n\nthe movie called UNDERGROUND!\n\nJorge Luis Borges once wrote that\n\nArgentinos remind him of\n\nboats moored in harbours.\n\nHowever, the brilliant writer hadn't\n\ncounted on Diego Armando Maradona.\n\nEl Diego was moored to\n\nhis mother\n\nonly until he was born.\n\nAfter that, he resembled a boat\n\nwithout a single rope on its deck.\n\nDiego could easily be the hero\n\nfrom my first film\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?\n\nand the Sarajevan suburb of Gorica\n\ncould easily become\n\nFiorito of Buenos Aires.\n\nIt wouldn't be hard to imagine Diego\n\nin WHEN FATHER WAS\n\nAWAY ON BUSINESS,\n\nplaying the father,\n\nwho atones for his adultery in prison\n\nduring politically turbulent times.\n\nAnd nothing would be\n\neasier than to see\n\nthe footballing magician\n\nacting in BLACK CAT, WHITE CA as the man\n\nwho is his own worst enemy,\n\ndoing everything to his own detriment.\n\nThis chapel is a creation of the members\n\nof the Church of Maradona.\n\nIt reflects, it symbolizes\n\nthe image of Diego among his own.\n\nThis ball represents\n\nDiego's sacrifice for football.\n\nWe'd like to ask everyone to please\n\ntake their seats, to get into place,\n\nbecause when\n\nDiego Armando Maradona arrives,\n\nwe'll start the press\n\nconference and give you\n\nall the details concerning\n\nthe big march in Mar del Plata.\n\nBuenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nI am very proud, as an Argentine,\n\nto be riding on this train\n\nand to repudiate that piece of\n\nhuman garbage, George Bush.\n\nSo I want the people\n\nof Argentina to understand\n\nthat we are going for dignity,\n\nnot for violence,\n\nbut to defend what is ours,\n\nwhat is Argentina's, that's all.\n\nIt was miraculous that the planet Earth\n\nwasn't knocked off its axis\n\nwhen more than a billion people\n\nall leapt up at the same time.\n\nThat was the moment\n\nwhen we celebrated Maradona's goal\n\nagainst England\n\nat the World Cup in Mexico.\n\nThe Earth continued its undisturbed\n\njourney around the Sun\n\nbecause it was a leap for justice.\n\nEven God himself\n\ngot involved in this case\n\nthe first goal against the English\n\nwas scored with the player's hand\n\neven though it was\n\na football championship.\n\nIt was one of those rare moments\n\nwhen a country heavily\n\nin debt to the IMF triumphed\n\nover one of the rulers of the world.\n\nFor Argentina! Goal!\n\nBy Diego Armando Maradona!\n\nA most poetic goal!\n\nSymbolic! Unforgettable!\n\nTo be treasured forever!\n\nDiego Armando Maradona! The best\n\nfootball player in the World Cup!\n\n'WHO is that man? '\n\nI asked myself.\n\nWho is that footballing magician?\n\nThe Sex Pistols of\n\nthe international football scene.\n\nThe cocaine victim, who,\n\nhaving given up drugs,\n\nlooked first like a Falstaff\n\nand then like\n\nan advert for spaghetti.\n\nIf Andy Warhol were alive,\n\nI'm sure he'd put Maradona in\n\nhis sepia alongside\n\nMarilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung.\n\nIf he'd been able to spend his\n\nwhole life on the football pitch,\n\nhe'd have been a happy man.\n\nAs it was, as soon as the referee blew\n\nfor the end of the match,\n\nand El Diego,\n\nthe greatest footballer of all time,\n\nhad walked past the corner flag,\n\nheading for the changing rooms,\n\nall his troubles began.\n\nWhat do we say?\n\nIt's me Bizoo.\n\nYes?\n\nIt's... it's Emir with the...\n\nwith the crew.\n\nHi, how are you?\n\nThank you.\n\n- My daughter, Dunja.\n\n- Nice to meet you.\n\nI am very happy to see you.\n\nSame here.\n\nI cried twice because of him:\n\nwhen we lost\n\nand when he beat England.\n\nWhen we talk about\n\nthe match against England...\n\nwe talk about it like this.\n\nBilardo was very intelligent.\n\nWe were representing our dead\n\nwho were sent to die\n\nby their own country.\n\nIt wasn't like England pushed\n\na button and killed everyone.\n\nSo we had to go out onto\n\nthe pitch and play football.\n\nThinking about football,\n\nbut knowing that\n\na lot depended\n\non our beating England.\n\nIt was like a war,\n\nwinning a football war.\n\nThat's what spurred us on.\n\nAfter the hand goal\n\nagainst England,\n\neveryone said:\n\n\"That was great,\n\nwhat you did to the English!\",\n\nwhile the others threw mud at me.\n\nI was so thrilled with that goal,\n\nit was as if I'd stolen\n\nan Englishman's wallet,\n\nit felt like getting away\n\nwith a prank!\n\nThis good-natured roly-poly looked\n\nmore like a character from a film\n\nabout the Mexican revolution\n\nthan the best footballer of all time.\n\nIt was as if he had\n\nstepped out of a Sergio Leone\n\nor Sam Peckinpah's film.\n\nAs if he had just said goodbye\n\nto some ladies of ill repute\n\nand stepped into a room,\n\nbringing the smell of\n\nrevolutionary gunpowder with him.\n\nI was sure of one thing -\n\nif he hadn't been a footballer,\n\nhe would have\n\nbecome a revolutionary.\n\nMaradona wouldn't need an incentive\n\nto send him off into the woods.\n\nHe was a revolutionary at heart.\n\nWhile everyone is defending\n\nthe U.S., I defend Cuba.\n\nI don't care if it pleases people.\n\nIt would be much easier to say:\n\n\"Leave the U.S. alone.\"\n\nBut I say the Americans\n\nlet the Yugoslavs kill each other\n\nbecause there was no oil.\n\nOtherwise, they'd have moved in.\n\nThey were behind\n\nthe killings in Afghanistan.\n\nThat really disturbs me.\n\nWe watch them\n\nkilling people on TV\n\nand the only ones\n\nmaking money are CNN, Fox...\n\nBut Fidel is great.\n\nI have a tatoo of him.\n\nAnd you have Che Guevara.\n\nChe Guevara, si.\n\nSee you tommorrow.\n\n- I see you...\n\n- See you. Ciao, ciao.\n\nWe could make\n\na nice movie out it.\n\nNice?\n\nYes. You sit here.\n\nI won't be seen anyway.\n\nThere's nothing harder than when\n\nyou want to peer into someone's life\n\nand yet at the same time understand\n\nwhy he or she won't let you in.\n\nIt's like a never-ending game\n\nwhere the doors are opening and closing.\n\nWhen you yourself have been\n\npersecuted by some journalists,\n\nyou begin to hate them.\n\nNot only when they lie,\n\nbut also when they are trying to\n\nferret out the secrets of your life.\n\nAnd now I'm intending to\n\npresent a portrait of\n\none of the most famous people\n\non the planet\n\nand suddenly I am taking\n\non the role of\n\nthose very people\n\nI have never liked.\n\nI feel like a paparazzo\n\nwaiting for a star to wake up\n\nand to step in front of\n\nmy camera lens,\n\nso I can sell\n\nthe photos to the tabloids.\n\n- They go somewhere else.\n\n- Really?\n\nThey're sitting in the car.\n\nThis barbed wire crown\n\nrepresents the pitch,\n\nthe field, the grounds.\n\nThe Goal of the Century\n\n...naked aristocracy...\n\nHe's awesome!\n\nMy best friend, a great brother,\n\nhe does everything for us.\n\nYou play for Argentino Juniors?\n\n- Yes.\n\n- What position?\n\nNine.\n\nWill you be like Diego?\n\nNo, I've never thought that.\n\nNo?\n\nMy brother's a Martian.\n\nNo question about that.\n\nTravelling through Fiorito to\n\nMaradona's house\n\nlooked to me like the journey to\n\nthe setting of my first feature film\n\nDO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?\n\nWhile I was looking at\n\nthe shanties of poor,\n\nit seemed to me that I knew every face\n\nthat was hiding behind the scenes."
