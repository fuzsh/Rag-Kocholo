        "text": "On this occasion, during one of his rare visits to the United States, Emir Kusturica illuminates his approach to his work which remains controversial at home and abroad. Some of his strongest critics, one of whom admits to never having seen the film, argue that Underground, scripted by Dušan Kovacevic, presents a pro-Serbian view of the Yugoslav wars.\n\nEmir Kusturica, Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres, winner of two Palmes D’or at Cannes Film Festival, also plays in a band, The No Smoking Orchestra. On September 8, 2007, Kusturica became a UNICEF National Ambassador for Serbia, alongside Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Jankovic and Aleksandar Ðordevic. Kusturica resides in Drvengrad, a village he had built for his film Life Is a Miracle."
