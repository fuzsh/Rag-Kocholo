        "text": "Beginnings\n\nEmir Kusturica was born in Sarajevo exactly during the time when Yugoslavia was not in the best of terms with the USSR. In 1954, he was born to a hard-working family. Emir’s father named Murat Kusturica was a government official, employed at Sarajevo’s Secretariat of Information. His mother, Senka Numankadić was also a part of the Yugoslav workforce, holding a job as a court secretary. They were not a family of incredible means or wealth, but he was not dirt-poor. Emir best describes himself as a “borderline delinquent” throughout his youth. Even though the Kusturica family was not too practicing in their faith, Emir was born to a Bosnian-Muslim family with Serbian roots.\n\nFilm and Career\n\nKusturica, like some of his colleagues, managed to take advantage of the opportunity to study abroad. Emir Kusturica set his eyes on the neighboring country Czechoslovakia. In 1978, he graduated from the prestigious institution of the Academy of Performing arts in Prague. It is for this reason that Emir is considered to be of the ‘Prague film school’, an informal group of directors that studied at this institution and acquired similar stylistic influences and film aesthetics. Kusturica, after graduation, began to work on cinematic work in the form of directing made-for-TV films.\n\nHis first feature film he shot in 1981, three years after graduation. This film, “Do you Remember Dolly Bell?” won him a prestigious prize of Silver Lion for Best Work in that years Venice Film Festival. Possibly as a consequence of this great honor, Emir Kusturica was offered the job of lecturer in the then-newly established Academy of Performing Arts in Sarajevo. In this position, Kusturica influences many directors to-be.\n\nKusturica’s second feature film “When Father Was Away on Business” shot in 1985 won him an even more prestigious prize. This film established Kusturica as one of the leading directors in Europe and even the world. The recognition and critical acclaim that was presented to Kusturica was mostly purely positive. The 1985 Palme D’Or, the best movie award in the world-renowned Cannes Film Festival, was given to Kusturica for his efforts in the film. He was also nominated for the American Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.\n\nIn the 1990’s Kusturica continued to be highly regarded as a great movie maker. He successfully crossed over to the American scene with the film “Arizona Dream” which stars one of Hollywood’s biggest A-listers Johnny Depp. He also kept to what he knew. In 1995 he released one of his most important films, “Underground”. After the release of this film much criticism ensued, but he also managed to take that year’s Palm D’Or at the Cannes Film Festival again.\n\nMusical Career\n\nBesided being an incredible and world-renown director, Emir Kusturica is also an accomplished musician. Always interested in music, Emir in 1986 started playing bass guitar for the band Zabranjeno Pusenje. He was part of the driving force behind the New Primitivism movement in Europe. The band had been publicly controversial and accepted the director into its line up. Kusturica lived through a period in which the band was imposed bans and much censure. The band’s punk-rock outfit was focused on talking about current events and criticizing government actions. Without much exposure to the media, Kusturica left the band in 1988.\n\nHe later rejoined the band after the release of his “Black Cat, White Cat” film. The band was renamed the “Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra”. Emir still plays with the band in shows like the one depicted above.\n\nFilmography"
