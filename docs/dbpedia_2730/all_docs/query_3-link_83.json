        "text": "US actor Johnny Depp arrived Tuesday in Serbia where he will be the star turn at a film festival launched by Serbian director Emir Kusturica to stem Hollywood's effect on film students.\n\nDepp, accompanied by Kusturica, was received by Serbian President Boris Tadic in Belgrade, and then left for the festival village Drvengrad in central Serbia, the Mondo.rs website reported.\n\nOn Wednesday, a life-sized bust of Depp will be unveiled to mark the opening of the third Kustendorf International Film and Music Festival in Drvengrad, built in 2005 as a setting for Kusturica's film \"Life Is A Miracle.\"\n\nDepp will also receive Kustendorf's \"Award for Future Movies,\" organisers said.\n\nFrench comic book author and director, Iranian-born Marjane Satrapi will preside a three-member international jury which will award Golden, Silver and Bronze Egg to the best of 28 films from 18 countries.\n\nThe festival runs until January 19.\n\nThe Bosnian-born director has won two Golden Palm awards at the Cannes film festival for \"Underground\" (1995) and \"When Father Was Away on Business\" (1985).\n\nHis latest movie, \"Promise Me This\" has flopped at the box office despite a Golden Palm nomination.\n\nKusturica recently announced he will make a film about Mexico's 19th-century bandit-turned-revolutionary Pancho Villa, to be played by Depp."
