Tania Beaumont is a painter-printmaker based in west London. She has always been able to draw and as a child (aged 7 or 8), living in the middle of nowhere in northern Nigeria, she was fortunate to have that pass-time to keep herself occupied while she lived abroad. Her father was a civil engineer so they lived in many foreign countries and in later life, she married an engineer too, so nothing changed!

Tania began her artistic career at Sir J.J. School of Art, Bombay in 1966-68, where they were taught everything from drawing and painting to textile design â a very thorough grounding. She then returned to the UK to do a foundation course before going to Liverpool College of Art to do a Fine Art degree. This was later followed by a postgraduate degree at Goldsmiths College, London in Textile Design.

Taniaâs style of work is very varied â mainly printmaking and mixed media, often semi-realistic in style. âI love experimenting with mono-printing. I do produce small editions of lino print, but also like to use printmaking techniques for experimental one-offs. I sometimes cut out the print and collage them onto monoprinted backgrounds, which I call monotype papercuts. These have an almost 3D effect sometimes.â She often ends up following a particular theme that has come about by chance and can lead to months or years of work. âAbout 7 years ago I noticed many tiny plants sprouting out of the pavement, near my London flat. I took a lot of photographs, then, and am still doing the same today. This led to a series of 7-8 different lino prints.â Before that, her work was focused on bees and honeycombs which led her to complete a huge mural on the wall of St James School, near Olympia.

Tania believes that arts and crafts are very important to society. It is especially important now with such an interest in or dependency on computer-generated images. âHand-made images and objects are part of our history, itâs what we do as human beings, and we must hang onto this. Thatâs why I feel it is necessary to continue to teach arts and crafts in schools.â It is an outlet that helps distract us and can help to improve our mental stability. It does not have to require many facilities or costs.

Tania hopes to keep on doing what she does in the future as it is something she loves and helps to keep her sane. Art particularly helped her during Covid when everything had shut down.
