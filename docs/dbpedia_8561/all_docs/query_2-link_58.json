        "meta_description": "Born in Benevento, Italy, on 8th February 1950, Tania Forgione is a fine painter of Mediterranean landscapes.\r\n\r\nAt a young age she found a talent for drawing and painting and spent much of her childhood developing her strong interest in art.  After school, Tania Forgione moved to Brussels, in Belgium, where she undertook an art course, with the intention of becoming a professional artist.\r\n\r\nTania Forgione's subsequent move in 1988 to the South of France, enabled her to take up painting full-time and to exhibit at local galleries.  Thus her career began to take shape.  She painted prolifically in oils with a knife and, in 1991, she won a place at the academy of \"Villa Thiole\" in Nice.\r\n\r\nTania Forgione has studied the works of Masters intensively, including Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet and Paul CÃ©zanne, whose styles have greatly influenced her own.  She is a member of \"Saint Jean des Art\" artistic society, and has held many exhibitions throughout the world.  \r\n\r\nWhilst away from her studio, Tania Forgione enjoys the theatre, music and cinema.",
