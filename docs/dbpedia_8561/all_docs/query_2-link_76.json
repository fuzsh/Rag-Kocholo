        "text": "“Holding History,” paintings by artist and teacher Tania Karpowitz, will be on display at the McCarthy Gallery in Holekamp Hall at Washington and Lee University from Jan. 23-May 30, 2015.\n\nThe exhibit is sponsored by W&L’s Williams School of Commerce, Economics, and Politics and is free and open to the public.\n\nKarpowitz’s exhibition features portraits and still lifes. The paintings began with the painter’s memories of her grandfather. The objects and reflections tell stories about family relationships from the past and into the future.\n\nKarpowitz earned her B.A. at Boston University’s School of Fine Arts. After painting for two years in Rome, she returned to the U.S. to earn her M.A. at Indiana University, where she studied with painters Robert Barnes and Barry Gealt. She studied in Madrid for two years on a Fulbright grant.\n\nHer work has been exhibited in New York, Madrid, Washington, Boston, Philadelphia and other cities. One of her paintings hangs in the permanent collection of the Borowsky Gallery in Philadelphia, while many others hang in private collections.\n\nKarpowitz has taught painting and drawing at Moore College of Art and Design, Montgomery College and the Washington Studio School. She currently teaches at the Art League School of Alexandria and offers private classes.\n\nThe hours of the McCarthy Gallery are 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday.\n\nInformation about attachment: “Holding History,” 2014, 54″ x 44″, oil on canvas."
