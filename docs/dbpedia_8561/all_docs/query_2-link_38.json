        "text": "C.V LINK\n\nAustralian born artist Tania Wursig is of Romani, Finnish and German heritage and has been based in both Sydney and Tahiti for more than a decade.\n\nPrimarily a figurative and portrait painter, Wursig's work can best be described as a celebration of life, nature and the 'feminine'. \"I am drawn to subjects and places that celebrate feminine power in its truest essence.\" Her paintings are imbued with strong cultural influences inspired by her travels and in particular her exposure to the Tahitian people and traditions.\n\n\"Having had the great privilege to live in Tahiti for extended periods has opened my eyes and my heart to the importance of 'earth connection' and connection to culture. Over this time I have been fortunate to meet and learn from several cultural leaders and immerse myself in the richness of Tahiti's authentic traditions, which has become my primary source of inspiration.\"\n\nIn 2011 Tania Wursig was given the opportunity by Tahiti Tourisme Australia and Le Meridien Tahiti to live as artist in residence for 2 - 3 months each year.\n\n\"If you told me 10–15 years ago that I would be living and painting in Tahiti three months each year, I would have said, “You’re nuts!” Well this, fortunately, turned out to be true. In 2011 I was offered a fully sponsored three-month artist’s residency on the French Polynesian island of Tahiti. Ever since, I have returned annually to explore the islands, paint, gather inspiration, and conduct international painting workshops and art classes for locals. My exposure to the Polynesian people and culture has changed the course of my inspiration, my career, and my life most profoundly. Living with and experiencing the Tahitians’ way of life has opened my eyes and reconnected my heart to the importance of nature and connection to place and culture.\" (In Her Studio Magazine - August 2021)\n\nFor over a decade Wursig has traveled extensively throughout French Polynesia to paint and gather inspiration, conduct international painting workshops and art classes for locals, and exhibit annually at Galerie Winkler in Papeete.\n\nTania offers all-inclusive packages to clients worldwide to join her in Tahiti, and the outer islands of Bora Bora, Huahine and Mo'orea for her art retreats aptly named\n\n‘PAINTING IN PARADISE’"
