        "text": "Exhibition Statement from Tania:\n\n“Our relationship to the world we live in has changed exponentially and rapidly. We face constant uncertainty about the result of the junction of technology and nature, and tenuously pin our hopes on technology to reconcile the situation we have created. I am fascinated by human progress, by the effects of human advancement and by the complex interrelationships of those effects. My artwork is an exploration of the intersection between humanity, the earth, our intentions and their consequences.”\n\nTania’s artwork in this solo show was specially curated by Katherine Grey Walker and Mathew Jinks.\n\nThank you, Sponsors!\n\nThis exhibition is generously sponsored by Kat and Pete Rich who are supporters of the arts and are constantly inspired by the power of creativity here in our community.\n\nAbout the Curators:\n\nKatherine Grey Walker\n\n& Mathew Jinks\n\nKatherine Grey Walker is the Gallery + Communications Director and part of the Curatorial Team at the Art Base in Basalt. Katherine is a Graduate of The Art Institute Of Chicago (BFAHons) and is an active member of the Arts community in the Roaring Fork Valley.\n\nMathew Paul Jinks is the Installations Manager and part of the Curatorial Team at The Art Base. Mathew is a Graduate of The Glasgow School Of Art in Scotland (BFAHons) and The University Of Illinois in Chicago (MFA). Mathew is the founder of Jinks and Grey ceramics and is an active member of the Arts community in the Roaring Fork Valley.\n\nA Note from the Curators\n\nIdeas forming our curatorial direction came from studio visits with Tania. We took an in depth look at Tania’s work and this exploration led us to duality and screening; above and below; foregrounding and backgrounding. Concepts of breath and pace were introduced to the conversation, we explored the works through the lens of weight and spans of engagement (as in, when do you hold on one piece and when do you move on). A sense of rhythmic viewership echoed in the mark-making and imagery of her work. The push and pull of Tania’s use of sinuous layers over the clarity of traditional landscape is a clear example.\n\nLine work creating grids and “screens” over the serenity of a beach at sundown asks of the viewer to identify these concepts. We used this as a theme for our curatorial process, what is produced in her work is echoed in the pieces we chose. Tania moves from 2D to 3D rather seamlessly as she is attuned to her material process. Tania’s sculptural forms become Talismanic creatures but again, ask the viewer to identify something with explicit clarity while still alluding to something more abstract in their repetition and texture, their “screens”."
