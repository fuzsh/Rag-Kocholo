        "text": "This quilt has the optical illusion of being shirred, but in fact is very flat. The gradations in color were achieved by brushing on pigment dye to a found quilt top, then hanging it vertically to dry. My attitude about dying is purely experimental—I get what I get. This quilt is very densely stitched onto a base of linen. Here is the artist statement for the series:\n\nWhat is it that draws us to another person? How do we find someone to share a life with? Built on a rescued quilt top in the iconic double wedding ring pattern, this artwork examines the mysteries of attraction and the first sparks of interest that just may lead to something more.\n\nReading Suggestions\n\nHere are a few books I have enjoyed these past months: Thornhedge, by T. Kingfisher; The Biography of X, by Catherine Lacey; Loot, by Tania James and Martyr!, by Kaveh Akbar (Five star review, a remarkable book, wonderful audio reader.) These were on audio. In paper, The Curse of Pietro Houdini, by Derek Miller; The Waters, by Bonnie Jo Campbell; The Morningside, by Tia Obreht and Games and Rituals (stories) by Katherine Heiny.\n\nI am looking forward to teaching at Quilting by the Lake in July! See the sidebar for links to more info. My garden is bursting into bloom, the tomato plants are knee high and we have had plenty of rain this spring. All is well.\n\nSo was the case with this double wedding ring rescue. After laundering and dying this vintage quilt, I tried to cut out the useable sections and create a patchwork of sorts. However, as I worked, I realized how fragile the remaining cloth really was. I love the red wool inserts and the mark-making stitches, but the strata is just not durable enough for a permanent artwork. One thought I had was to reuse the quilts (there are two in equal states of disrepair) as “marriage bundles”, or maybe seal with paint or wax to create a rigid surface for bookmaking. Someone suggested an organza overlay, which I thought was an interesting idea, and I thought of maybe putting the damaged quilt between two other pieces of cloth as a mostly hidden element that would be stitched through but remain part of the structure, possibly with small cutouts revealed. Something will happen, in its own time.\n\nBook List: Lots of new titles. Absolution, by Alice McDermott; Charis in the World of Wonders, by Mary Youmans; The Winter Soldier, by Daniel Mason; All you Have to Do is Call, by Keri Maher (all as print books) and Small Things Like These, by Claire Keegan, Cold Earth, by Anne Cleeves, Trust, by Hernan Diaz; and After Annie, by Anna Quindlen (as audio books).\n\nFor anyone in the Philadelphia area, At First Blush (detail, top center) is included in Art Quilt Elements at the Wayne Art Center. This is the first time I have had my work in this biennial exhibition and I am very honored to be among the selected artists.\n\nRegistration is now open for Exploring Hand Stitching at Quilting by the Lake.\n\n5 Days Monday – Friday, July 15-19, 2024\n\nRediscover the pleasure of pulling a threaded needle through layers of cloth. Hand stitching can be used to make marks, define texture and create a rich and visually interesting surface design in fiber artwork. We’ll use materials we already have, the textile “keepings” of everyday life, to explore the possibilities of sewing mindfully by hand. The goal of this experimental journey is to develop a vocabulary of stitches and make personal connections to the process of creating. And by slowing down and working by hand, we may find a new path to well-being along the way.\n\nAll QBL workshops begin on Monday and end on Friday. Workshops are from 8:30-4pm daily. Students check in to their dorms and move into classrooms on the Sunday before the workshop begins. There is a welcome dinner with a lecture Sunday night.\n\nAll Levels\n\nI sometimes feel like time is passing more quickly at every turn. I have some anxiety about 2024, and have started a whole new series of protective objects called Her Armory. Sneak peek below. Next week I will be sending two sets of Amulet Bundles to the Dairy Barn in Athens OH, for OH+5, a regional exhibit. I am also readying about 10 -12 pieces for She Said, a three woman exhibit with my friends Laurie Rousseau and Liz Roetzel at the Box Factory for the Arts in St. Joseph, MI running from January 19 through February 25.\n\nToday we have some snow along with very cold temperatures. Our autumn was long and beautiful and now gone. Last year at this time I began a series of three small pieces in wool and two of them will be on exhibit next month. As the days grow short I feel an instinct to draw inward and stitch. I love the feel of a needle through wool and the deeply intense colors of woolen cloth. I am working on a second generation of armor, this time made from rescued wool blankets, shawls and sweaters. Check my Instagram for some in-progress photos of those.\n\nWintering: Nightfall will appear in the Artlink Contemporary Gallery Midwest Regional Exhibition from January 4 through February 4, 2024 in Fort Wayne, IN. Wintering: Snowbound is in Craftforms at the Wayne Art Center in Wayne, PA from December 2 through January 20. At First Blush has been selected for Art Quilt Elements 2024, also at the Wayne Art Center.\n\nI have been reading some good books: Night Watch, by Jayne Anne Phillips; The Vaster Wilds, by Lauren Groff; Chenneville, by Paulette Giles; (all in audio), Broken Light, by Joanne Harris; City of Thieves, by David Benioff and The Lost Children Archive by Valeria Luiselli. ( in print)\n\nMuch to be thankful for this year!\n\nThe end of October brings the leaves down. We rake them to the parkway (the grass between the sidewalk and the street) and the city will come and suck them all up with giant leaf vacuums and take them to the composting site. It is amazing to see. The colors of autumn have been especially beautiful this year in northern Indiana, and the ginko tree on the front lawn is a flash of gold. A freeze is predicted for tonight, so the ginko will be bare tomorrow.\n\nWintering: Snowbound has been selected for CraftForms 2023 at the Wayne Art Center in Wayne PA. The exhibit is open from December 2 through January 20. This is the first time I have entered this show, and I was happy to have this little piece represented. I made three Wintering pieces early in 2023, all in wool, using wool tapestry yarn for the stitches. Here is the artist statement for the series:\n\nI live in a place with cold dark winters. For me, it is a woolen season, a time to shelter in place and quietly stitch. The works in this series show the winter stars and falling snow, seen from the windows of a warm and protective home.\n\nWorking my way through the beginnings of a new series about love and relationships. What draws us to another person? How do we move through the complexities of choosing a partner? These are some of the questions I am thinking about. I am using an unusual found wedding ring quilt top for the first three pieces. I got this on Ebay for less than $20, and originally the background was a light lavender color, so I cut it into three pieces and overdyed each using painted on pigment dyes. The results were unexpected. The rings themselves are very large—about 24” across, and they were overlapped and stitched by machine onto whole cloth, rather than traditionally pieced. Some of the symbols I have embroidered come from archaic alchemy symbols—a reference to the elusive “chemistry” of attraction.\n\nNew Legacies has opened at the Lincoln Center in Fort Collins, CO and two of my Ordinary Oracle pieces are on display until August 5. Glimpses was inspired by reading about the ancient oracle at Delphi. It is said that she went into a trance, then gazed into a dark bowl of water from the sacred stream to see the future and make her predictions. I was interested in the fact that virtually all the ancient oracles were women, and were considered to be the most powerful sources of wisdom at the time. One of our kids did a semester abroad in Athens, so we went to visit and took our hostel-arranged bus trip (with a bunch of fun twenty-somethings) to Delphi. You can still feel the power of place there.\n\nSummer Reading: Winter Counts, by David Heska Wanbli Weiden; The Midnight News, by Jo Baker; Singer Distance, by Ethan Chatagnier, and on audio, Dead Water, by Anne Cleeves.\n\nOrdinary Oracle:Talismanic Cloth was selected for Fiber Art Now Excellence in Quilts. Apron Strings 2 is on exhibit in Indiana Now, at the Art Musuem of Greater Lafayette through August 6. Amulet Bundles for Cutting Strings will appear in SAQA Global Art Evolved: Intertwined, at the Yellowstone Art Museum, opening today, June 30. Online, Afterlives, a Surface Design Association online exhibit, includes Amulet Bundles for Teenage Drivers.\n\nWe have hazy air here in Northern Indiana due to the wild fires in Canada, but some much needed rain has put the garden into full bloom. You can check my Instagram page for garden photos.\n\nSeveral of my Amulet Bundle series will be on exhibit this summer, including the SAQA Exhibit, Art Evolved: Intertwined. More on that next month. Fantastic Fibers continues at the Yeiser Center through June 24. See an exhibit catalog of all the works. New Legacies opens at the Lincoln Center in Fort Collins on June 10.\n\nReading List:\n\nI have spent most of May gardening and traveling, but managed to read a couple of books: Seven Steeples, by Sara Baume; The Trackers, by Charles Frazier, and Fingersmith, by Sarah Waters (all as paper books)."
