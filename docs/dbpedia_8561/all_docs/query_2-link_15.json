        "text": "ABOUT TANIA STILL\n\nTania is based in London but was born and grew up in North Yorkshire. She studied at the City & Guilds of London Art School where she completed her diploma and post-graduate studies in Fine Art Painting. Now working from her studio in southwest London, Tania predominantly paints animals from throughout the British Isles. Using photography, she trails the country taking images to base her work from. Tania is an exciting addition to animal painters because her work is so different: alive, dynamic and accurate. She concentrates on the breeds she knows, foxhounds and coursing greyhounds, having been taught hound conformation by Captain Ian Farquhar MFH, of the Duke of Beaufort’s. Unless vital to the picture – as with minkhounds in water – Tania portrays her subjects without background. They stand off the canvas, often only the head or part of it, with nothing that will detract from their own raw energy and character. Using a square format to create her images is fundamental to the environment that she wants to convey in her work; an unbiased approach retaining the hound’s anonymity within the pack."
