        "text": "Tania LaCaria is an Italian-Canadian abstract artist. She holds a BA in Fine Arts from York University (2006), CIDA-advanced diploma in Interior Design from Sheridan (2009). LaCaria has traveled the world extensively, gathering inspiration from various countries where she’s lived. She currently lives and works out of her studio in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.\n\nLaCaria’s work explores paradox - the idea that two opposing realities can exist at the same time - with a focus on themes based in gender, sexuality, social structure/class systems, body politics and relationships presented in an Abstract Expressionist aesthetic. LaCaria aims to form meaningful connections with observers by accompanying her work with personal poetry and story-telling.\n\nPhoto by Ian Pettigrew\n\nAs a conceptual artist, LaCaria thrives in a state of curiosity, eager to ask questions of herself and the world around her during her creative process while admitting she doesn't have the answers. Her background in Interior Design blends seamlessly with her love for visual arts as LaCaria spent the majority of her professional life as a solutionist for her clients. Now, as a full-time professional artist, LaCaria is eager to share her curiosity with others by producing thought-provoking work that prompts viewers to ask questions about themselves and their own life experiences.\n\nIn order to facilitate viewers with making an emotional connection to her work, LaCaria often exhibits and presents her work alongside music and/or her poetry - her preferred method of story-telling - to provide context to the symbolism behind her mark-making, imagery and color choices.\n\nHer creative process and presentation has been described as ‘performative’ with an emphasis on the deep introspection, vulnerability and social observations she is making that are often juxtaposed by the playful, “fun” and seemingly light-hearted way her often brightly-colored work presents to viewers."
