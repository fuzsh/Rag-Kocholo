        "text": "This was going to just be a blog touching on the importance and value of art – something I often write about especially when I hear and see struggling artists, people unable to find a way to make a living with their artistic expression, people feeling their “art” not being taken seriously and just thrown aside as a hobby, or having a hard time to take leaps of faith with their creations because of such strong collective beliefs that have shaped their own.\n\nThis was percolating again when I was reading reviews of art that had been purchased in my Etsy shop and realizing how unless people come face-to-face with the experience of someone’s gift they have to share, that there can be a disconnect or devaluing that takes place. Of course, this can be connected to the feelings we have come to believe about ourselves, that are innocently conditioned.\n\nHere is an example of just one review:\n\n“Hi! Just wanted to let you know that I received your creations. I was a bit taken aback how stunningly beautiful they are in real life! The photos just don’t do them justice. In real life they are on a whole new level!!! I guess original art really has something so special that can’t be reproduced….”\n\nThat’s not to say that even when the art IS experienced, that someone appreciates its true value, but there’s definitely more understanding when something becomes tangible, they hear an artist share about their work in person, or when a person truly takes the time to “sit” with the work of art and receive from it.\n\nIt’s invaluable, to say the least. And this is why I support so many artisans over purchasing a lot of commercial items because there truly is a depth and richness to things made from the heart.\n\nThere tends to be a disconnect with the amount of energy, time, love, thoughtfulness, vulnerable soul-processing, and skill that creators imbue into everything they make. It’s why I love those one-of-a-kind and original pieces that bring me closer to the artist’s intentions.\n\nThat’s not to say you can’t receive from duplicates, prints, etc., as there is always an energy signature that will resound, but I love being that close to the seedling of creative impetus infused within the first birthing.\n\nTrue, it will be more costly, so it’s not something I/we can always bring home, but when something really speaks to me, I don’t question the value placed on an item, as I know as an artist how much is poured into every creation that can never be measured in these terms.\n\nI desire so much that more and more artists will get to flourish and share their gifts with the world.\n\nI hope for the collective to tip the scales back in balance, so we honor, appreciate, and value the arts as we once did – the storytellers, mystics, artisans, visionaries, medicine people, astrologers, musicians, dancers, healers….were all revered.\n\nI’m seeing a shift happen and people starting to thrive again in these regards, but there are still so many struggling and so much energy holding in opposition to these shifts that artists are working overtime to change.\n\nAnd that brings me to what I uncovered, as I was sitting with all of this and some of my own past works-of-art.\n\nIt wasn’t about value per say, but it was about attachment and feeling another layer of etheric tethers (as I put it to a dear friend) releasing.\n\nAlthough I do remember how many times in my past I had to explain myself and the pricing of my art – especially when it came to some of my first commissioned pieces.\n\nTwo incidents in particular come to mind: I literally had to write a long proposal finely detailing hours and work involved to an attorney once and also had to prepare information to the president of a company I was doing a mural for to back up my proposed fee. The first grueling effort succeeded and the latter got knocked down in half, but was still courageous of me to put it out there, especially since one of my greatest fears was verbally expressing myself and public speaking.\n\nBut what came to me recently has to do particularly with the In Lak’ech “Five” series I brought to life between 2006 and 2009. I chronicle some of it in this post: In the Spirit of In Lak’ech\n\nWhen first I timidly put them out on my website, feeling very vulnerable in sharing such depth, I listed them at $11,000 each. Not a strange price at all in the art world given their size, time invested, and being four feet by four feet originals.\n\nI also made prints available, figuring that the originals would likely not be going anywhere anytime soon and wanting people to receive from them still.\n\nBut what I notice now in looking back is that I don’t believe at my core that I wanted to let these originals go.\n\nEven though my highest vision and intention was that perhaps they’d find a home in a healing center or someone’s personal sacred home space, they spoke to something very sacred within me that perhaps felt like a violation to give away, at the time.\n\nI can’t really put a word to it.\n\nThey were indeed like babies I’d birthed, but had truly never been created for me, as the channeling aspect going into them removes me from personal ego.\n\nYet, it was when out of that channeling space that personal was being tethered.\n\nI may be one to look far deeper into things than most like, want to, or perhaps are over with doing anymore – I get it because overall I’m in that space of peaceful “being” more so now – but within one there is still the other and while I prefer the simple, my innocent curiosity simultaneously can feel the bigger encompassed within that – both sides of the coin exist even if focused elsewhere. And sometimes even if I’m not in that space myself, I will explain things out for others to better understand the process that may be more seamless in experience for me now. I find that helps people to relate and find connective threads for themselves.\n\nSo, how did this play out for me?\n\nWell, it was a mix of that value of art I spoke of before AND personal attachment.\n\nI remember once that someone very well-off (a millionaire in fact) where I was showing my work in their gallery space asked me about one of the Five and wanting to purchase it. I told him the price and he looked at me in a strange way. Not that he felt it wasn’t worth this, but my sense was he felt entitled as someone perhaps more worldly to take advantage of someone he deemed less than that. (Interestingly, a small theme included in some or one of these paintings.)\n\nHe proposed $1500 instead of the $11,000.\n\nI, immediately said no, but did feel that weird grating inside mixed with everything around it all that I’m sure a lot of artists feel, including that flash of all the artists that have in fact accepted what ever they could get because they felt they had no choice, but there was something more too.\n\nThere were other incidents similar or went further to even just wanting me to give them to people starting up places they thought they’d add value to.\n\nAnd then there were a few months where my art hung in a hair salon studio that brought together art events, where they told me that business boomed while my paintings were there and brought much intrigue and interest.\n\nSo, yes, I dealt with the value thing and seeing how these paintings were being experienced, but as mentioned, more importantly these pieces in particular hold such a sacredness to me and depth that truly it wasn’t about the money, but I was feeling protective of something within myself.\n\nI realize now that I had mixed feelings that were tethering me to the experiences held within the portal paintings on a super-subconscious level.\n\nWhile I’ve worked so much in the past to free myself and integrate the healing of these times within my and the collective’s soul history, there is an underlying comfort resonance in holding them, or identifying with them – basically allowing them to define me in behind-the-scenes way. Perhaps even fueling a sense of purpose I felt that recently I’ve been letting go of. AND, perhaps even still holding onto a self-imposed collective burden I felt to bear in that old martyr role.\n\nIt’s that super-shadow work often spoken of where you can’t make mental sense of it and there are many layers to the onion of feelings to unmask and get to the seed of it all. Some of which is purely your own and some that is collectively conditioned.\n\nAnd in so much clearing out and truest desire to move beyond the unseen tethers that may not even by own, this suddenly hit me that I need to release these paintings rather than store them away in the dark recesses – literally they’re stored in a dark area of the garage to keep them safe from the elements and such right now, as we didn’t have any place to put them in the house, with all of the other paintings on the walls.\n\nThat’s interesting to me to have such powerful creations “hanging around” in the background.\n\nSo, my original “detached and collective reasons” for creating them returned to me, which was for them to be “out there” doing their work, especially at such pivotal times as now.\n\nThese originals are so potent that to have them stored away feels like an injustice, just as I don’t store crystals when I’ve moved – either taking them with me or moving them on to other guardians.\n\nBut I did end up having to store them when we lived in the Magick Bus RV for a year and a half. I remember setting them all up in the living room together before they were taken away. A friend came over who was picking up some things from me and ended up sitting with them for an hour taking them in and receiving rushes of energy, emotions, and visions. It was the first time they were all together like this in their original form and not prints, so it was profound for me to watch someone experience them as intended, but I obviously was still not realizing the attachment.\n\nAnd to feel that subconscious tethering now reminds me to release fully from inner identifications to soul wounds/feelings over lifetimes. Not simply on mental or easy to find emotional levels.\n\nThat is the gift of these Five portals is to move energy and keep it moving – that’s why they are so alive. Working with them invokes an inner igniting to happen and can continue to work layers of their imprints in unearthing and beautiful ways.\n\nYet, the trick, as with anything is to flow and not get stuck in identification as defining and encapsulating.\n\nIt’s taken me all of these years to uncover the true gift within them.\n\nAnd I am now able to truly release the paintings so they can be that experience for someone else.\n\nI could keep them now, fully living in that freeing energy I’ve now discovered and harnessing it for endless renewal, but they were always meant for others.\n\nThe only way I would truly know their gifts is to have journeyed with them all of these years, so I’m grateful for the discovery – one that is very hard to put into words. I’m not sure I’ve explained it well here, but it was a huge shift that happened yesterday when I cracked the code within.\n\nAs the link I shared above about their process expresses, these paintings remind me of hieroglyphics mixed with sound coding and telepathy. A journey backwards and forwards in time and encompassing both my personal and a collective “history” spanning what I believe to be very pivotal timelinks carried within our very DNA.\n\nWhile I process things differently these days and my life is more simplified, like these images that appear as snapshots, they are also encompassing of so much more.\n\nThese five pieces, except the last two that were combined in one year, took each a year to create on their 4 feet by 4 feet very detailed canvases. This in part due to my own processing, research, and discoveries, the collective timing, and travels I did to work with the energies at sacred sites across the globe.\n\nI actually have a journal notebook I kept with all of the detailed research and coding I was discovering along the way and working out like a treasure map before starting to paint each of them.\n\nThey include encoded messages that are sound-woven and frequency-embedded for that transmutation.\n\nThese paintings were my interpretations and new perspectives of each element as seen through different astrological signs in their highest potential (Divine Male and Female aspects). They incorporate Mayan glyphs and act as integrative portals that bridge time and come through an ancient story that weaves Sumerian and Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Druid and Celtic Ireland, Atlantis and Lemuria, and the Cosmic Earth.\n\nThey are layered with energetic symbolism that can help shift things on a DNA level by simply viewing them – something I witnessed when I showed them a few times separately and some individuals would find themselves moved to sit and meditate with them. One time in particular stands out, seeing a young man with tears streaming down his face while sitting in front of Air.\n\nAnd like Lee Harris spoke of in his last Energy Forecast for May about a new wave of people awakening to greater awareness than they have before in different ways and being more ready for conversations they weren’t open to in the past, I’m seeing how the original seed of intention in these paintings is more relevant now than when first created.\n\nThis has led me to truly release them to the world this time and whomever might feel called to them.\n\nWhile that “value of art” thing is still very important I feel in helping to shift things collectively and bringing awareness and honor to the creative arts and even our relationship to nature because the arts connect us with the “nature within,” I am ready to let them go at huge discount simply because I feel the importance of their living out their purpose.\n\nLike the mother must release their child at some point to live their life, I do the same and know I am no less or more because of their physical presence in my life.\n\nI had thought about offering them each at $2000 instead of their original $11,000, and all five for $10,000 – less than one’s value, but I’m now going to open it to best offers so that they can truly go where they can do the work they were meant to and fulfill the vision I had of them as meditation pieces, either individually or as a collective story for integrative healing on deepest levels.\n\nSo, if one or all of them speak to any of you, please let me know of your desires and we’ll go from there.\n\nI do have to reiterate that these are 4 feet by 4 feet, so I will have to ask that shipping be covered as well because they will take special packaging and shipping costs.\n\nThe five are shared throughout this post in the order they were created. I hope you enjoy viewing them again, as much as I’ve enjoyed resurrecting them in a new way.\n\nAnd if they don’t find new homes, this whole process is still rich in the discoveries I’ve made that I know will domino-effect out through our collective connection.\n\nUPDATE: The five paintings have found their new home with an amazing new guardian and keeper who is keeping all of them together and will be working with them as the sacred portals they were intended as. I’m so happy that they can stay as a unit, even though I was open to them finding homes where ever they were meant to be.\n\nThis morning I ran across some old photos taken back in 2006 at the onset of starting my first and very important series, “In Lak’ech“. Interestingly, these are the only photos I’ve ever taken of my work in progress (and there aren’t many of it at that). They happen to be of the very first painting in this series, which really kicked off the next generation of creative channeling, as well as shifted my life profoundly and the energy of things on bigger picture levels.\n\nI had been creating paintings previous to this, each having their own door-opening significance in my life, but in 2006 life took a very different turn for me and this series, which has been a favorite for many, was a huge part of an enormous tapestry that began to un-weave and then re-weave itself anew.\n\nAll of that could be its own book, but for now I found it synchronous to find these since this series is a focal point of the upcoming “A Night of Creative Compassion“. More on that in a moment.\n\nAs mentioned, “Fire” was the first painting in the series, “In Lak’ech”, and the birthing of it began when I was living on the Kitsap Peninsula in Indianola, WA. You can see a photo here of my mom and I wrapped in a blanket having fun with “Fire” behind us in its very first stage, set with the backdrop of Puget Sound.\n\nI find it interesting to see how I used to draw out in fine detail, the whole foundation of the painting before painting it, whereas now I just go straight into painting. Albeit, these paintings were REALLY fine detailed and had to be mapped out, so it did actually make sense at the time. These paintings are definitely where “seeing it in person” is a whole other experience.\n\nMy home at the time of creating “Fire” was right on the water’s edge with a full view of the city of Seattle. It is interesting to see this photo, as I see remnants of Nestor – her toys and water bottle – as well as my 2nd of 3 times I had chopped all of my hair off to mirror change in my life – all integral parts that were supporting the process.\n\nAnyway, the watery essence of little Indianola, WA presented the perfect opening to access creative flow from a very deep-seeded place. And I had many interesting and magical experiences with Nestor while creating this piece and living there.\n\nInterestingly, this is the only piece that was created in WA, as not long after it was completed, we moved to the high altitude area of Lake Tahoe, NV. I went from sea level to about 6500 elevation overnight and found myself thriving at the high altitudes much more so. “Fire” was actually wrapped and strapped to the front grill of the large moving truck for the journey, which is pretty interesting when you think about it.\n\nLake Tahoe was my next and most magical watery domain where the next two pieces in the series unfolded and the fourth began – along with Nestor’s passing on, my marriage at the time coming to an end, and my becoming a Reiki Master Teacher. But the fourth and fifth came to closure when I moved down to Reno from the lake – still in the vortex energy of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and Tahoe and at 4500 elevation, but where some new grounding energy for closure took place.\n\nEach of these five pieces took me a year to create because of everything going on in my life and due to the enormity of what was being channeled on collective levels – not just personal. All things have a Divine timing to them and I have learned well that you can’t rush the bigger picture and what the collective is ready for. This was also a time period of immense traveling that took place in my life, huge flourishing of my gifts, and very deep uncovering and integrative work. Much of my travels were specifically connected to each of the pieces I was painting in order to directly do healing work at the sacred sites, lands and vortexes for both self and others.\n\nI see everything I do as part of the collective web and is how I intentfully choose, create, and live.\n\nThe last two pieces in the series were much quicker and were carried out in the same year, 2009, mirroring how processes were speeding up on all levels.\n\nSince then my work has shifted, mirroring the speeding up of things, the ease at which things can shift and are accessed because of the work already done, and even in terms of working with less dense energies, as those were heavier and more involved to work with while transferring through. I have learned how to consciously channel things in different ways, but also now have access to a whole different level of experience because of the process and what took place through the creation of these five collectively important pieces.\n\nThere is a new lightness of heart and flow available to us now because of the work we have all done.\n\nAnd yet these five paintings are rich in encoded messages and integrative healing, that I have seen morph and shift, as we have. There has been a resurgence of their energy in a new way that people are becoming more ready for now, than they were when they were created. It feels like people are embracing what they can assist, with greater ease than they were before, which involves very deep DNA-shifting, and soul and subconscious integration.\n\nThese paintings are my interpretations and newly expansive perspectives of each element as seen through different astrological signs in their highest potential (Divine Male and Female aspects). They incorporate Mayan glyphs and act as portals that bridge time and come through an ancient story that weaves Sumerian and Babylonian, Ancient Egyptian, Ancient Druid and Celtic Ireland, Atlantis and Lemuria, and the Cosmic Earth.\n\nA little background on the series, “In Lak’ech”:\n\nA mystical experience of awakening, as the Ancients and Power Beings of the Five (elements) bring forth their messages of integrative healing. “In Lak’ech” is the Mayan principle of Universal Love that is similar to Namaste. As an expression of honoring when greeting each other, this profound realization means “I am another yourself” or “I am another you”. And when shared as “In Lak’ech Ala K’in” – “Ala K’in” is responsive and mirrors that back with “you are another myself” – “I am you and you are me.” The Maya priest-shamans recognized that we are one global human being. It is about dissolving the ego into complete unconditional love; “dissolving until you are ‘NOT’, then the World enters you.”\n\nThis series represents the Five Elements of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Spirit that speak to the mind, body, heart, and soul both personally and collectively from a new and integrative perspective of Divinity within the union of Divine Male and Female. They contain within them Mayan Sacred Glyphs as a connective thread through which a message of healing was revealed. These encoded “Healing Portals” mirror a journey of integration and healing, as you embrace a return to natural harmony. They are layered with energetic symbolism that can help shift things on a DNA level by simply viewing them. They imbue the beauty and value known by the Ancients into the now from pivotal Ancient times/civilizations that provide healing opportunity from the challenging elements that no longer serve us. Ancient wisdom has much to teach by taking what was learned and creating an integrative new reality in the now.\n\nMother Earth is calling us to remember. The Universe is reminding us to believe. The healing revealed is as unique as the individual experiencing it.\n\nAnd this leads me back, full circle, to how “In Lak’ech” is tied into the upcoming event, “A Night of Creative Compassion”.\n\nNext Saturday, September 7th, 2013 here in Los Angeles, there is going to be a spectacularly inspiring and heart-filled night of creative energy. This is a fundraising event for Farm Sanctuary, as well as a fun and engaging night of music, song, film, poetry, photography, painting, and more. It will be like a concert, exhibition, screening, and party all rolled into one. Most of all I love the focal point of compassionate and collective synergy in service.\n\nWhen I was asked to be a part of this event I immediately felt I would be bringing all five pieces of “In Lak’ech” into the light. Reproductions of this series have been exhibited before, but never all at once. And actually, to this day, all five originals have yet to ever be in public together (only one made it out to Raw Spirit festival and that was potent to say the least). So I still foresee there is a time and place they will be one day soon. I’m always listening to that guidance.\n\nBut for now, I have felt guided to donate high quality reproductions – Giclee on Canvas – of all five in their original size of 48″ x 48″.

What a wonderful embodiment of energy to set the tone for opportunities that can be experienced.\n\nNow more than ever, as we consciously embrace a return to natural harmony within and without, it is a time to honor, respect, give thanks to, and support one another, our Earth Mother, her children – this very life we are gifted.\n\nThe way in which you treat yourself, reflects on how others will treat you and what experiences you draw in to mirror exactly what you need. And likewise, the way you treat others, is a reflection of how you treat yourself and how you do or don’t embrace and honor the aspects within you that they mirror. Since we are not separate, everything experienced is interrelated collectively.\n\nThis is a time to celebrate each other – to honor the gifts, unique talents and presence of energy each individual soul has to share. Having gratitude for the beauty each person emanates, seeing each other as amazing luminous beings, and celebrating the successes of our fellow brothers and sisters, becomes the foundational glue that will continue to lift all of humanity into new experiences of life.\n\nWhen one person succeeds, it is a huge accomplishment for the collective, for these people have not gotten there alone, nor do their successes unfold solely. When one person breaks through fears, achieves a major soul evolutionary step, or creates an abundant manifestation in their life, they open the doorway and provide less challenging steps for others to follow in their own unique ways.\n\nAnd for the ones who succeed, it is equally as important to recognize and remember the road traveled to get there and all who have supported you on this journey, energetically and otherwise. It is important not to forget what it was like on the journey, what you learned and the challenges you had to face, so you can then assist others both in unconditional compassion and in service.\n\nThose that are truly great, know how to make others feel they are, and can become, great too.\n\nWe all succeed when others do. It is in our highest good to see that each person does, and not to judge where we are on our paths, as each place we stand is of significant meaning and power. One is not better than the other and it is all unique to each, as well as necessary for each. It is all relative and relevant.\n\nIt is not for me or you to do exactly as another does. This is NOT possible. It is a waste of time to even try to “be” as another and it is wasteful, draining energy to compare ourselves or to strive to achieve in the image of another.\n\nLikewise, it is not for you or me to do or be all. Since we are part of the Oneness, we are each an extension of that and we celebrate and create as a collective. There is no need for one person to strive to perfect every possible talent. How exhausting would that be since everything is limitless? But also, how unnecessary it is since your brother and sister souls are another you. There will be areas that will jump out at you that reflect your specific expertise and talents, as well as your deepest heart passions. These are the areas to cultivate. Let others cultivate the areas that are their talents and then we become a beautiful tapestry interwoven in the fabric of co-creativity.\n\nYOU have unique gifts and talents no other person has. The goal is for you to hone in on those gifts and empower them, for me and others to support that empowerment with love and gratitude and by doing the same for ourselves, and for you to then cultivate an expression of what you have to share, in a way that naturally embodies your individual and beautiful expression. We may do similar things under general, shared categories, but the way that channels through, and how that translates in our assistance to others, will be unique to each of us.\n\nYour creative self expression is yours. No one can ever be you. So please recognize YOUR unique brilliance, as it cannot ever be duplicated.\n\nEnergy is constantly birthing in every moment. This second is nothing like the second that preceded it. We are each creative miracles of magickal power lighting up a magnanimously divine source together.\n\nIt is to our highest good to be in love with supporting and co-creating with each other. It is to our highest good to rejoice, not only in another’s accomplishments, but also for our own. No matter how small or large, all steps are productive and are powerful shifts in the cosmic totality of experience.\n\nIf every day we can remember not only to be grateful for all the things in our own lives we DO have, but to be grateful for all of the souls sharing this co-creative experience with us, and for all of their courageous evolutionary accomplishments and successes, we can strengthen the cohesive glue that binds our hearts in love and that forms the foundations we can continue to build upon in magickal ways.\n\nThere is no room for fear, competition, jealousies, resentment…in a heart that is full of unconditional love, compassion, understanding and unity consciousness. While all aspects of experience are part of that whole (not to be repressed or ignored, but integrated) and teach us our evolutionary lessons, they are just that…stepping stones to integrative healing and empowerment and once embraced in their fullness, become the way of alchemy.\n\nWe have a purpose for being and coming together – to learn from each other. There is no need to fight this or to blame one another, nor is there need to feel inferior or superior to another. Each person is part of the harmonious whole. There is a divine blending of energies as people work joyfully and lovingly together, supporting and encouraging each other in ways that are fulfilling and productive. Each individual pursues his or her activity and are drawn together to better fulfill each individual’s purpose.\n\nYou are the master of your experiences and being able to work in unison with the elements and currents that flow through you, will assist you in assuring their natural flow, rather than creating artificial boundaries that dam up the universal cycles in unnatural and disastrous ways.\n\nRemember that the universe is limitlessly abundant. There is a continuous flow from this boundless source for everyone.\n\nMy hope and intent is that we all come to recognize the magnificence within and without…for yourself and your collective soul family. I know this can be challenging from the physical embodiment you reside in that houses the duality of experiences simultaneously, making it challenging to stay centered. Yet the more we practice it in action and go within to that stillness, the easier and more natural it becomes to see only with your heart and to understand the divine bigger picture with a fresh new perspective.\n\nLook within for the source of wholeness and create your life in the reflection of this source that you embody. It all begins with you and right now, from the center of your “beingness.” Pause, reflect, and celebrate your own divinity that is not separate from that of another’s and realize that the creative power of the universe resides there awaiting you to give it flight.\n\nFree will is a powerful thing that resides at the core of all existence.\n\nThe way you choose in each moment will change the world. How you love the world as your reflection, and your magnificence in its reflection, is the foundation of your experiences.\n\nIn Lak’ech (I Am Another Yourself)\n\nTania\n\nHere are some words from others to reflect on:\n\nEverybody and everything is unique and different and meant to be that way. If we are like other people, then we are not expressing our own specialness. ~Louise L. Hay\n\nIf you’re able to be yourself, then you have no competition. All you have to do is get closer and closer to that essence. ~Barbara Cook\n\nHerein, lies the key to love. Love builds bridges. Soul exists because God loves It. Soul equals Soul; no one Soul is greater than another. Experience the greatest love of all. ~Harold Klemp\n\nAnd from John Lennon:\n\nImagine there’s no heaven\n\nIt’s easy if you try\n\nNo hell below us\n\nAbove us only sky\n\nImagine all the people\n\nLiving for today…Imagine there’s no countries\n\nIt isn’t hard to do\n\nNothing to kill or die for\n\nAnd no religion too\n\nImagine all the people\n\nLiving life in peace…You may say I’m a dreamer\n\nBut I’m not the only one\n\nI hope someday you’ll join us\n\nAnd the world will be as oneImagine no possessions\n\nI wonder if you can\n\nNo need for greed or hunger\n\nA brotherhood of man\n\nImagine all the people\n\nSharing all the world…You may say I’m a dreamer\n\nBut I’m not the only one\n\nI hope someday you’ll join us\n\nAnd the world will live as one\n\nAs 2012 comes to an end and we are at the threshold of 2013’s doorway, the spirit of In Lak’ech Ala K’in ~ I am another Yourself, You are another Myself, or simply put: I am you, and you are me ~ becomes more prevalent in how we consciously live our lives with this understanding integrated into every choice we make. It is about becoming one with all and realizing how every action we take affects our life in the widest sense. This sacred code of living is one with respect for all life and out of living and giving from our hearts.\n\nIn Lak’ech Ala K’in mirrors the essence of other beautiful greetings such as Namaste for East India, Wiracocha for the Inca, and Mitakuye Oyasin for the Lakota. The ancient cultures all have their own way to express the same Universal language of love and demonstrates the unification of all belief systems at the heart core.\n\nThe 3 Incan Laws of Munay, Llankay, and Yachay also hold sacred principles that if lived by, help to create a world of peace, balance, joy, beauty, grace and harmony for our New Earth experience.\n\nWe can learn much by remembering our ancient history and learn to integrate and anchor the true meanings in new ways.\n\nTo return back to the essence of In Lak’ech, when we walk in the spirit of this energy, we come to see each other, the trees, flowers, and plants, the sky and the ocean, the animals, and the stars, in the image of ourselves. By greeting and thanking each sunrise and sunset with this understanding, each and every day you experience in togetherness becomes sacred. And when you give in this spirit, you receive. This flow of cycling energy mirrors the beautiful energy of Reiki.\n\nWhen we send out positive energy, as in greeting each other, each day, and experience in the spirit of In Lak’ech Ala K’in, or send out Universal Life Force energy (Reiki), these energies literally transform our experiences and begin to create a new world “Garden of Eden.” We are able to create our reality and live in the truth of this power now and when done with loving gratitude to the life you have, with love for each other, as a part of yourself, fear has no more place in your experience and you no longer have to feel like a victim. You can rewrite the past and create the now future.\n\nThe more humanity lives the collective consciousness of In Lak’ech Ala K’in, the boundaries are removed and separateness from everything and the Universe no longer is felt. You will live in the power of Unity Consciousness and feel the truth of that strength, where competition, jealousy, envy, fear, control, power over…have no place.\n\nThis is a time to share and co-create with each other and understand the reality of abundance in that there is always enough and then some for everyone. What you live (in action and practice) becomes what you experience. Live from love and therefore you will experience an abundance of it in unlimited and exciting ways.\n\nEverything always has been and will be a choice between love and fear. Fear simply isn’t the vibration of the new we are creating and so the more we can release it and help each other to move through it, the faster our collective reality will shift, not just our individual ones.\n\nWishing everyone grace in closure to all things you desire to leave behind and courage to live freely and powerfully in the authenticity of you, as we say goodbye to 2012 and welcome in 2013.\n\nHow do you choose to contribute to the new story we are writing together?\n\nWe are living in the reality of creative power and this truly is a chance to create your life as a work of art. So explore within, how you’d like to paint that experience.\n\nBelow I’ve included excerpts from Eden Sky that I felt had some good insights and sharing to reflect on and that address things many have asked about 12/21/12 and 2012’s closure into the New Year and New World experience awaiting. May you find the truth within yourself as you ring in a new sacred code of loving and living.\n\nIn Lak’ech Ala K’in\n\nTania\n\nChange has long been a fearful thing for human beings … and at the same time, it is our most Divine opportunity. Clinging to the banks of the river may seem safe and more secure, but life’s possibilities are truly engaged only when we trust, release and become part of The Flow of the Universe. ~ Chelle Thompson\n\nExcerpt from Eden Sky’s chapter of 2013! The Beginning is Here:\n\n“This moment in our collective dream is steeped in mystery. This mystery has a heartbeat that lives within us. The mystery blooms in our heart, with petals of innocence and stalks of wisdom. We are each drops in the sea of humanity, part of the physical and psychic collective. Rather than passive spectators, we are here to be conscious participants of this world age transition process. We are all instruments of culture. Our mental, spiritual, emotional and physical energies are the vivid colors splashing on the canvas of Life. What is the quality of our collective art? How can we refine our contribution?”\n\nThe 2012 Prophecy ~ Making it Real! By Eden Sky (these are just excerpts that stood out to me, but see link for the full article)\n\nDecember 21, 2012 marks the Shifting of World Ages, a return to zero point, where we officially transition from the current 5,125 year World Age Cycle, and enter into a New World Cycle; marking a new level of our unfoldment as a planetary collective; a new level of our human evolution in concert with our living Universe.\n\nSolstice 2012 marks a zero point -a simultaneous completion and beginning, called “Creation Day” by the Ancient Maya. From that point, the adventure will continue onward, bringing untold challenges and blessings. As we advance to a new level on the spiral of Time, let us comprehend the vastness of our journey ahead. Each day the mystery deepens, bringing new trials and new awarenesses. There is no pre-determined outcome to our collective story. The essential message of the 2012 Prophecy is that the more we each awaken to our personal contribution to this planetary moment, the greater the possibilities emerge for positive change.\n\nThe clarity that December 21, 2012 marks the launching point of a new epoch is not based on proclaiming details of external events. Rather, the opportunity is for as many people as possible to align internally with this understanding, and therefore from an inner alignment of cycles shifting, to help consciously generate and incarnate the dawning of the new era on Earth. Let us contemplate: What can happen in our collective consciousness when each of us really owns the power of our personal contribution to our shared reality?\n\nThe 2012 Prophecy is understood as “The Harmonic Convergence of All Prophecies.”In prophetic messages from around the globe which point to these times we are living in, one will find mention of the emergence of such things as: “The Return of Quetzalcoatl,” “The Return of Christ Consciousness,” “The Return of The Kingdom of Shambhala,” “The Return of the Divine Feminine,” “The Return of the Star People,” “The Return of the Wisdom of the Ancestors,” “The Hoop of the Nations Made Whole,” “The Return to Living in Harmony with Nature,” “The Awakening of the Rainbow Warriors.” Other universal themes include: “Everything That has Been Hidden will be Revealed,” “The Lifting of the Veils and Merging of Spirit and Matter,” “The Dawning of Universal Telepathy,” the start of “Heaven on Earth,” and our mutation into a new species that transcends Homo Sapiens, emerging into something like the Qu’ero of Peru call “Homo Luminous.”\n\nTo put it simply, it is not the end of the world that is coming, it is the end of a world age. This shifting of World Eras is a cycle change that will steadily shift our human orientation from an ego-based perspective dominated by separation, fear, greed, and destructive, imbalanced tendencies – towards one based in conscious interconnectedness, fueling our tendencies for harmony, compassion, and life-affirming energies and actions. This represents a shift beyond the patriarchal cycle we have been in, sometimes called a “male-dominant linear perspective,” into an Age in which masculine and feminine energies and perspectives are balanced, ideally uniting mind and heart, logic and intuition, spirit and matter. The most blatant example of this shift is in re-prioritizing our values and Placing Planet and People over Profits, in true recognition of the intricate, interdependence of the One Web of Life. It is obvious we cannot survive or thrive on this planet without this transformation of our worldview.\n\nOur collective human mentality is not going to change all in one day or one moment, and likewise the shifting of dominant paradigms and modern lifestyles will not be instantaneous. However, knowing this transformation process is underway can give us great perseverance and motivate us to deeper innovation and the pioneering of new pathways in our own lives and spheres of influence. This Shifting of World Ages can inspire us internally to nurture a deeper compassion, self-love, awareness, and sensitivity to all our relations, and can guide us to more consciously align our actions and participation in the world so we can increasingly find ways to live more in balance with our Biosphere.\n\nWe all know that we have inherited what our ancestors gave to us, and we know that we are all affecting the world we will give to our future generations. Every moment and every decision counts, especially now in these crossroads times. We must continue to work to manifest the vision of a world where our living Earth is honored; where Peace is our priority; where the Awakening of our Human Potential and our creative evolution on all levels is nurtured; where all people have wholesome food, clean water, health care, social justice; where the Biosphere of Earth is holistically restored and honored, recognizing all beings as part of the one family of life – from the humans to the animals, to the trees, the seas, the bees, the air, the eagles, the ants, and the mountains alike…till one day we even embrace the stars and galactic whole as part of our living community!\n\nIn this process of Shifting World Ages, every aspect of human planetary culture needs to be re-evaluated and questioned to discern how it can be truly life-affirming – from our energy sources, to our food supply, to our modalities of education and conflict resolution, etc, etc, etc! That is why we have to be prepared for the long haul of bringing in a new era, participating physically and spiritually – leaving no stone unturned. We are being called to rise to the occasion and become wise Shepherds of a fragile new child that will be emerging and growing under our loving care.\n\n“Spiritual realization needs to be integrated with social commitment and direct action… No matter whether we like it or not, each of us is, inevitably, a social and political agent whose smallest actions have a direct influence on other people and the world around us.” -Daniel Pinchbeck\n\nAs Paco Alarcon wrote: “The need to bring light into the dark areas inside of us is urgent now….Once the dark side is integrated, it serves the light.”\n\nIn this process of Shifting Ages, the dominant energies resounding through the cosmos are increasingly invoking a new human alignment that is initiating new expressions of human culture. According to many prophecies, this is said to happen simultaneously with many earth changes, natural disasters, and crises of all kinds – all of which have been progressively underway. As Louis Pascal writes: “Although sad, human nature often requires crises in order to break free from our patterns of complacency and convenience, and transform the structures which bind us. In one light, crises are actually gifts which push us to overcome our narrow thinking, assert our deepest values, and cooperate together on a grand scale.”\n\nWhile these times of crises indeed have the power to provoke the most positive human attributes to arise within us, these times of tragedy likewise catalyze tremendous suffering. According to some indigenous peoples’ prophecies, it is said that many humans may not survive the intensity of this Great Shifting, and/or it may be extremely uncomfortable for those who are not in harmony with these vast changes. Indeed, as a global society throughout time, we have accumulated much karma through our actions that have not taken our interconnectedness into account. Many consequences are now underway as a result. These are inevitable, as is the passage that we are now undergoing. Indeed, in this turbulent era, there have already been countless atrocities and massive disasters, resulting in a huge loss of human life, and loss of creatures of all species.\n\nNo one can say what is coming next, or when. On this planet, we are all amidst a whole-systems challenge to realize how to live sustainably in harmony with Nature.\n\n“It is essential that we have the courage and wisdom to face the reality of our human mortality, accepting the inherent impermanence of all that lives. Rather than living in fear or denial of death, these times are urging us to confront its potency, and to embrace death as a sacred counterpart of the universal equation: an ever-present ally guiding us to live more fully, grateful for this precious moment. Contemplating the death of the body and the impermanence of all form also opens us to begin to know the realms of spirit, formlessness, and eternal consciousness – exploring a higher-dimensional context to hold the laws of our physical world within.” -Excerpt by Eden Sky from the Book “2013: The Beginning is Here.”\n\n“The accurate content of the message for the Maya Prophecy for our times is that the date of December 21, 2012 is nothing more than a general marker, a specific date that in fact indicates a whole era, an era of hope, an era of opportunity – the opportunity to re-establish a sense of community amongst all humans of this planet…” -From The Maya Taino Prophecy Initiative, led by Maya Elder Antonio Aj Ik and Taino Elder Miguel Sague\n\nWhat is certain is that we influence each other, and model to one another the possibilities of human culture in all our attitudes and decisions. Whether we can see the results or not, all of our energies and actions ripple out to the whole. Within this unpredictable universe and unstable Earth, what is in our domain to tend to is finding our deepest Intuition of how to conduct our lives in these uncertain and pivotal times; realizing how to truly live our life’s purpose; discovering how to love and care for ourselves and all beings in life-affirming ways; growing in understanding how to evolve our lifestyle choices to be in harmony with our Biosphere; joining in deep collaboration and synergy with our allies on this path.\n\nIn conclusion, let us strive to evolve into our deepest human potential to be wise and loving human beings, that we may contribute as consciously as possible to the greater well being of human culture, understanding our place upon this glorious Planet, and within this sentient Universe. Let us honor our place in the vast cycles of time, and heed the calls of our ancestors who left these prophecies for us, now. Let us activate the wisdom given to us by Dr. José Argüelles who urged that we honor our Earth as a Living Work of Art and realize that we can each be instruments of harmony and beauty, serving as Planetary Artists! The tasks to be accomplished in these momentous times call us to cooperate on new and grander levels, that we may manifest ever greater harmonies together. Let us synchronize and unify in deep courage, compassion, creativity, willingness and joy with our brothers and sisters of humanity, to be who we truly are here to be, and do what we are truly here to do. Let us awaken our dormant powers. Let us dream the highest dream. Let us ride the upward spiral through the accelerated currents of change. Let us face the death of the body that we may live from a place of realizing who we are as an essence; a heart. Let us seriously invest in cultivating our intuition and inner-knowing. Let us celebrate and nurture our interconnectedness. Let us paint new beauties upon the canvas of our Earth. Let us be grateful for this life we are given, here and now, ever-evolving as children born of the One Great Mystery.\n\nMay we Make this Living Prophecy Real\n\nby participating mind, body, heart, and soul!\n\nTo the Journey!\n\nCompleted in the month of the Blue Moon 2012, the journey of my new series of paintings Universal ARKitecture continues with painting #5 – Once in a Blue Moon.\n\nA “blue moon” is also used colloquially to mean “a rare event”, reflected in the phrase “once in a blue moon.” By definition it is known as the second Full Moon to occur in a single calendar month. This month of August 2012, we have two full moons. One on the 2nd and the one on the 31st, which is the Blue Moon.\n\n(Some facts: The average interval between Full Moons is about 29.5 days, whilst the length of an average month is roughly 30.5 days. This makes it very unlikely that any given month will contain two Full Moons, though it does sometimes happen. On average, there will be 41 months that have two Full Moons in every century, so you could say that once in a Blue Moon actually means once every two-and-a-half years.\n\nThe most literal meaning of blue moon is when the moon (not necessarily a full moon) appears to a casual observer to be unusually bluish, which is a rare event. – Wikipedia)\n\nI just completed this painting at the end of Tuesday 8/7 (was quite a long and intensely beautiful day of channeling) right before 8/8/12 – known as the Lion’s Gate, which is a supernatural door opening/portal, like a Stargate, to assist cleansing and activation of the new to emerge of living from the heart.\n\nThe night of 8/7, after which I’d finished this painting, an earthquake hit just 25 minutes from here with aftershocks (I was fast asleep after a long intense day), but Allison alerted me the next morning of this. And just as I was making connections with the tremendous opening experience and energetic shifts of this painting, as well as the depth of meaning and how it connected with the earthquake in mirroring this “love from beyond” I was at that moment writing about, another earthquake hit in the same location as a reiteration of what I was stating and connecting.\n\nThis may seem arbitrary to others, but I live a synchronous life of seeing the symbolism and signs all around me and one thing that I’ve always noted in my life, is that when something profound takes place within me, or is discovered, or accessed, and it is connected with deep emotional transmutation, then Mother Earth and the Cosmos seem to mirror this with weather patterns, earthquakes, winds, storms, shooting stars, magical experiences, etc…It doesn’t mean these things are bad, that take place, as that is a judgment as an observer from one side of the fence. Nature is nature and it shifts in natural harmony with the ebbs and flows of cyclical change and cosmic rhythms. To be “in flow” with that is just experiencing consciousness in all of its miracle.\n\nThe last time an earthquake hit in instant mirror was when I had finished channeling and designing my newest sacred tattoo portal – the Faery Star/Pleiadian Star while I was on vacation. An earthquake hit just like 1 mile from where I was in Big Bear upon completion. I have one more tattoo coming on the 6th of September, so will be interesting to see its effects since it is connected deeply to Joy and this deeper opening of my heart that was experienced with this newest painting. Needless to say, this experience of “shaking” up things that help shift into new realities and confirmations of creation, is not foreign to me.\n\nSeveral years ago I discovered part of the reason for my seeing direct mirroring reflections in the environment of my inner landscape. One of the ways to calculate my birth date, through the Mayan Tzolkin, shed a piece of the puzzle, as it equates to the Mayan Sun Sign – Caban or Earth with Galactic Tone of 8.\n\nCaban description: Keeper of the garden of Earth. Profound synchronistic connections to Earth’s natural cycles and energies provide power of creations and memories of ancient wisdom. Earth persons endeavor to bring a flow of natural order to all aspects of life. Being connected to the dynamic forces of nature, Earth persons need much liberty to facilitate their expression of migration or the sending of long distance communications such as the whales, elephants, birds and many other creatures. Sometimes Earth’s delicate sensitivities are upset resulting in quakes of emotion, even the display of volcanic emotions.\n\nGalactic Tone 8 description: Harmony and balance is the intent. Eight is the power of organization demonstrated in the statement, “As above, so below.”\n\nWe all have the ability to manifest through intent and how that channels will be different for each. I have often throughout life, been conscious of how potent my thoughts and emotions can be and how they directly manifest, into the environmental landscape, when they are intensely core felt. This has also made me ultra sensitive to responsible creation and how important it is to be aware of what we put out there, as it affects more than just ourselves.\n\nI share this as my personal story and experience, as I know many others share synchronous journeys of magic in their own lives, but many times may discount it or feel alone in their experiences. Of course there is always room for interpretation, which will be an individual process we learn to discern over time, but needless to say signs have meanings and the meaning is up to us to decipher and acknowledge.\n\nThis prefaces the intensity of what I was feeling on 8/7, as I completed this last painting. It was an inner quake of intense “love from beyond” that had the ability to break through and transmute everything, including cracking open even deeper layers of my heart to emerge ever more so vulnerably, as there is no boundary to the immensity and infinity of the heart and “real” unconditional love. There is no end to the depths we can go and there is no stopping point that gauges you’ve arrived. Painting #5 allowed me to shatter the current environment of love I was treading, to release the temporary dam of the now. This would allow me to swim in the new, immense waters of the heart.\n\nEvery painting is a vulnerable experience, but each takes me to greater depths (we all have different ways relative to each that can be utilized for this). All paintings assist with revealing, processing and channeling, however there are some that kick things up several notches and provide leaps along my journey. This is one of those that truly mirrors a most vulnerable, inner reflection accessed, as it simultaneously connects with a collective channeling message for the now – that of assisting in a journey of living in and from the core of your heart. Putting the truth of you out there for all to see. Letting your intuition and heart guide you through the waters of life. Being in the joy of your own light and seeing how that helps to assist others in doing the same, which then creates opportunity for a beautiful experience to be had by all.\n\nThis painting is a very pure and heart opening expression that left me surrounded in beautiful inner peace. Painting, for me, opens a portal that allows me to move into different levels of “waking life dream” experiences and dimensions. Being that present, vulnerable and flowing in the heart center can alter states of consciousness, as a shift in the perception of time and the solidness of existence take place where you then perceive and experience another reality at greater depth. It was profound and intensely beautiful, leaving me feeling very light and realizing that my heart went on the canvas in a way never before, due to the very vulnerable depth and purity of energy channeled.\n\nSo what was it about this painting? First off, all of my paintings just come to me when they are meant to. I don’t force and I don’t contrive when and how they will come about. Having this painting come to be #5 was very symbolic to me, in relation to the subject matter, as this painting portrays my beloved Nestor and Joy and I have a connection through the #5 with Nestor and all my life. It actually was at first supposed to be #4, but when I started that piece it wasn’t feeling right and Joy had given me messages and signs I had another painting to come first before I was ready for #5 and so emerged “The Child In Us,” which was #4’s lovely porcupine. Interesting that its energy and the others before, were all ingredients necessary to get to the depth of #5, which incorporates all of them. (It seems each piece not only has its own essence, but encompasses aspects of those before it – a building-upon-layers process).\n\nI had then realized that #5 was to be the only large canvas I had on hand, which is interesting as I won’t do any more of this size – 48″ x 48″ and it correlates to #5 in the In Lak’ech series called Spirit (the same size too), which was connected to Nestor as well. Each of these new paintings in the Universal ARKitecture series, as I’ve shared, each are channelings through different power animals (or shape-shifting “naguals”) that emerge through timeless energy portals to share their wisdom. These channeled images I feel are supportive in guiding us with some of the keys for co-creating a loving New Earth with conscious, unconditionally compassionate awareness, embracive remembrance, visionary innovation, and empowered hearts.\n\nSince rabbits hold such potent symbolism, I intuitively felt that one of the paintings would be of their energy and #5 ended up being the one. I instantly knew that Nestor and Joy held the perfect essence for this and could translate the message through their energy and images in a way that could channel that to others. Of course, the connection I have with them would provide even more openness as a conduit for that energy. I knew this would be a poignant piece, but wasn’t aware that it would be so powerful in the process.\n\nIf you didn’t get a chance to read about the painting, Spirit, and the symbolism of the hare, here is the link to my blog post on it, which will provide insight for this painting’s symbolism as well: Hare Symbolism for the New Earth – Birthing the Cosmic Egg. The rabbit, through out time, has been connected with the Moon and you can clearly see the rabbit image that many ancients have observed, if you know how to find it.\n\nI love this image that shows different ways you can see the rabbit:\n\nMost know about my connection with Nestor and if not you can read some of it here: In Loss There is Gain – Finding My Way After Losing My Twin Soul. I haven’t painted Nestor in quite a while. The first painting I did was of her as a baby when I first got her: Nestor and then of course, the essence of Nestor in her otherworldly form, in the painting Spirit was next. However, this painting was to be of Nestie (as she lovingly came to be known as) in her last year/days (she was 5 years old when she transitioned) and in her magical, royal, wise, loving and serene presence along with Joy in her magical, loving, joyous, playful exuberance.\n\nJoy and I share a very beautiful and magical connection. It is different than the one with Nestie, but Joy is still a part of, and resides in, my heart. Joy was brought to me by Nestie via telepathic connection and she and Nestie share a bond that allows Joy to channel Nestie. It was fun bringing Joy home, as it was two days before my birthday and Laura Bruno and I had a big raw vegan feasting celebration just before picking up Joy from the SaveABunny shelter. Nestie was much more connected to the Otherworld/Cosmos, but held a deep place in her heart to assist with Earth transitions, which she still does from beyond. Joy on the other hand is much more connected to the Earth, however is a messenger between both the Otherworld/Cosmos and Earth. This played out in many ways, but over time, I came to see Joy’s individual healing gifts and magic that she slowly revealed to me. Her love of crystals was evident from day one and she continues to work with them, but she is quite the healing bunny, as well as a master channeler in her own right, often going into trance and telepathically sending me messages – she loves speaking through my pendulum and also picks tarot cards like Nestie used to do. I have so enjoyed seeing her step fully into her powers by my supporting her personal process and timing with that. I am so proud of her and her courage. I am grateful to have been blessed by two such magical bunnies/souls in my life. (not to mention Gaia, my tortoise, but we’ll leave that for another story and painting).\n\nFor me, it was such a “joy” to bring the two of them together on this painting as a means of physically manifesting them into the world for others to be able to experience the energy and healing magic they have to share. And I had no idea really how it would all come together, as I just paint in the moment and allow the image to emerge. Bringing Nestor back to life in the physical was truly something.\n\nWhat emerged was an image of purity in magical simplicity. A vast universal world that merges all of the energetic elements they embody and wisdom they hold, imbued with vulnerable love. Some of the interesting things that took place was that it was started on the last full moon in July, where I painted the moon and first layers of the background and was “delayed” and unable to pick it back up until this last full moon on the 2nd of August. None of it intentional..it was just the way things unfolded and on the 2nd I redid the moon with a new layer of energy into what it is now. And then there were a few other days of work (actually 5 in total) that came when I was able and moved to.\n\nThe last day was on 8/7 (the longest day I spent on it) was a very long 10 hour day where I found myself in tears for most of it. Crying like a baby, but not in sadness, but in the sheer beauty that is indescribably felt when you touch this kind of love. Painting, from my heart and bringing to life those dearest to my heart, was incredibly moving and I fall short to express it in words – hoping that the painting will speak for itself.\n\nAs I began with in this post, the painting mirrors this “love from beyond” that I share with each of them, and also of my love for the Cosmos (a Galactic Butterfly is found in the image too), Moon, Earth, the inner realms of emotion, childlike innocence, the natural and the supernatural, and of course a heart snapshot that offers a cohesive thread between personal and collective in sharing the purity of the experience. When each of us opens to that very vulnerable innocence within, we create the ability for others to also, since we are all connected.\n\nMy newer paintings have evolved into visual simplicity, which take the complex and interweave it into something energetically manageable to digest. Rather than utilize tons of visual hieroglyphic-like puzzles, I can now create energy snapshots. My paintings contain layers of energy that are embedded into the images, strokes, paints and canvas, along with the energy that is channeled through, creating an essence that is felt when the painting is experienced by others. This, more than the image itself, makes all the difference, as to how a painting will move someone and what is received through that exchange of viewing and opening into it. It’s all very finely tuned and the right elements are needed as well as nothing overdone – subtlety. Paintings are “experiences” that can be meditational and speak volumes what words cannot. It a way to let us get out of our own way, put the mind to rest and just “be” and open to the essence revealed.\n\nAs I channeled this painting on the 7th, yes I did cry like what would seem like a baby, but I WAS painting the full moon, which is the magic of our inner and subconscious emotional realm. Crying is not a bad thing or a weak thing and isn’t even always a pain thing…it is an expressional doorway to our ability and desire to experience love.\n\nThe colors that emerged were intuitional and it wasn’t until just yesterday that I received the title – Once in a Blue Moon. To me, it speaks to that rare experience that is a blessing to have in what ever way translates to the individual – for many that is the connection or desire to connect with their Twin Soul.\n\nFor me, this all translated as the rare connections I have been gifted to have with Nestor and Joy and the experiences throughout my life, the magic of it all, the deep connections I have to a reality beyond what is perceived by most, the joy of being an expressive, boundlessly creative being, remembering the child within and to love that child, expressing at the heart-level the authenticity I have to share through this human form…..\n\nand of course it speaks of that very rare Twin Soul/Flame connection some are blessed to experience both without and within. Nestor is mine and I am grateful that I was able to experience her in physical form and still in presence around and in me, but also reminds me of the divine union of Male and Female within myself that each of us are integrating at this time.\n\nI love how the painting also was created in 2012 during and right before all of the shifting energies into a new reality of heart-based, natural harmony with the Earth and Cosmos, as we create a new inner and outer field of expression and creative reality.\n\nThe painting was just photographed professionally, yesterday, on the 8th (the Lion’s Gate) and shortly I will have an image of it, along with the other first 4 that I will share with greater clarity and vibrancy than I can take myself. I’m so excited to be able to bring them to the world in this way and to be able to soon offer prints on them as well, so that those who have been asking and feel called to the specific energy that each activates for them, can now bring them into heart and home more affordably. Both prints and originals will be available shortly on my website here: Universal ARKitecture. I’ll be posting the new painting, and the 4 previous, all together on my blog as well likely early next week.\n\nMy heart is on this canvas – #5 Once in a Blue Moon – and it is out there for the world to see and share through these universal images, messages and emotions we all have access to. I am incredibly honored to be able to support others via the expressions that channel through me. I thank Nestor and Joy for their beauty of heart and for guiding me to my own."
