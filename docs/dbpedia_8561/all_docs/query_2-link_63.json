        "text": "Tania was first introduced to painting on canvas at Secondary School, and from that point painting became a significant part of her life. She is a passionate self-taught artist who has followed a unique creative path which has allowed her art to develop and evolve over her life.\n\nFree creative expression, story telling and observation of the world around her guides and inspires her painting. An enthusiastic amateur photographer Tania loves to photograph the world, nature and people, she then uses the photos as references for painting.\n\nCreative exploration is a big inspiration and goal for Tania, she seeks to be open and free to explore and paint different subjects, genre, styles and uses many varied color palettes. Tania loves to combine elements of detailed realism with free flowing painting styles and abstract elements. Surreal elements can often be seen in her paintings as her art is created from a place of conscious and unconscious thinking and feeling.\n\n-Semi-finalist: 2022 Doug Moran National Portrait Prize"
