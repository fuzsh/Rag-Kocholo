        "text": "For most artists, news that the Museum of Modern Art had acquired one of their pieces for the first time would be more than sufficient for a good week. But for Tania Bruguera — a New York-based Cuban artist who has been in legal limbo in Havana since December, when she was arrested to prevent her from staging a provocative open-mike performance — the week was just beginning.\n\nThe City of New York announced Monday that it had chosen Ms. Bruguera, whose work blurs and sometimes obliterates the line between socially conscious performance art and straight-ahead social work, to be the first artist-in-residence for the Mayor’s Office of Immigrant Affairs, an unusual yearlong appointment in which she will help the agency recruit undocumented immigrants for the city’s highly popular new municipal identification-card program, IDNYC.\n\nAt the same time, the Museum of Modern Art announced that it had bought “Untitled (Havana 2000),” a politically charged performance and video work that Ms. Bruguera, 47, created for the 2000 Havana Biennial in La Cabaña fortress, which was used as a jail and execution site during the Cuban Revolution.\n\nAnd as those announcements were being prepared, Ms. Bruguera was called in to meet on Friday with law-enforcement officials in Cuba and given back her passport, which had been confiscated since her arrest. “I have it in my hand as we speak,” she said in a telephone interview on Sunday.\n\nThe return of the passport does not completely end Ms. Bruguera’s standoff with the Cuban government, which is treading into uncertain territory as a renewed diplomatic relationship with the United States increases pressure for greater freedom of expression. Ms. Bruguera said that she would not leave Cuba until she had received written legal assurance that she would be allowed back into the country. But the movement in her case, she said, raises the likelihood that she will soon be able to return to New York to conduct the city residency in person, a melding of the artistic and the civic that she said was rife with possibility.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
