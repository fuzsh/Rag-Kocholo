        "text": "Painter Juliette Aristides remarked the warm sensibility experience when viewing her portraits. Influenced by 19th Century Masters; she focuses her painting style on classical realism.\n\nHaving a respect for cultural traditions of story telling, her paintings are thinly painted describing the temporal nature of life. Drawing the brightly colored layouts of Ebony magazines as a child, lends itself to the graphic and compositionally conscious look of many pieces.\n\nShe has trained at Delaware College of Art and design and Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts where curriculum centered on the human figure. This period of time enriched her knowledge of traditional methods of painting and appreciation of many styles.\n\nTanya is licensed as a CADC with a master’s degree in mental health counseling. Working in human services and corrections since 22 has strengthened her concern for the issues such as choices, peace and redemption. The subjects of her work illustrate metaphors for scriptural verses reflecting her faith.\n\nOver the last ten years, she has taught art workshops with Delaware Tech, Camelot, leach Elementary, and various correctional environments. Tanya has also worked as a mixed media instructor in prisons and juvenile programs. A strong advocate for the arts in prison population, Ms. Bracey has developed and facilitated several art sessions serving different levels of security facilities.\n\nEducation\n\nSpringfield College- Masters Degree in Mental Health Counseling\n\nPennsylvania Academy of fine Arts\n\nDelaware College of Art and Design\n\nSelected Exhibition\n\n2007 March Brewed Awakenings\n\n2006 February North Market Library\n\n2006 October Sinclair’s Restaurant\n\n2007 October Grand Opera House\n\n2010 September Burning Bush Bookstore\n\n2011 August Burning Bush Bookstore\n\n2018 April Tanya's Home Art Show\n\n2018 May Bellefonte Art Festival\n\n2018 June Germantown Juneteenth Festival\n\nSelected Group Exhibition\n\n1994 August Christiana Cultural Art Center, Delaware\n\n2003 September Delaware Art Museum, Delaware\n\n2004 May Ohio Art Expo, Ohio\n\n2007 December Delaware City County Building, Delaware\n\n2009 March Grace Gallery, Delaware\n\n2009 May Delaware College of Art and Design, Delaware\n\n2011 September Art on the Avenue Gall\n\nResearched and developed art sessions for\n\nExperience\n\n2004 Art instructor Upward Bound classic Program, Deltech\n\n2005 Art instructor Baylor Women Institution\n\n2006 Production Team (Set Design) for Stage play\n\n2010 Curator, Burning Bookstore Gallery\n\n2014 Art Therapy instructor, In Her Shoes\n\nArt Therapy group, Fiske Academy\n\nArt Therapy group, Art Therapy Express: Art sessions with children and adult with emotional and physical disabilities.\n\nArt Therapy group, Baylor Women's correctional Institution\n\nResearched and developed art sessions for incarcerated women\n\nAwards\n\nHartzell Award, PFAF\n\nBlue Ribbon Award, Art Instruction School\n\nBest in Show, Grace Gallery\n\n3rd Place, National Art Program"
