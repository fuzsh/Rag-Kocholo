        "text": "*Prices are in Australian Dollars\n\nAcrylic and collaged charcoal and chalk pastel drawings on paper on canvas\n\n102 x 61cm\n\nThis is the first in a series of new works exploring the kaleidoscope of womanhood -past, present, and future. \"HERSTORY\" is an assemblage of past life drawing studies, creating the foundational history of the portrait. These drawings subtly emerge through the skin, symbolising the many versions of ourselves that we carry with us, along with the strength and wisdom of the women who came before us.\n\nThis technique serves as a delicate reminder of the complexities of womanhood, reflecting the stages of our feminine journey. At times fierce and at others vulnerable, this piece stands as a metaphor for the inner feminine experience.\n\n*As this is a ready to hang canvas, shipping will be calculated separately, or you can arrange to collect from the SYDNEY STUDIO"
