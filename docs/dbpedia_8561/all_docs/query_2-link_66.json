        "text": "Growing up in Northern Ireland I knew I wanted to be an artist from a young age and dreamt of going to art school. I came to Australia for a working holiday in 1981 and stayed. I completed a Bachelor of Fine Art Degree at the Canberra school of Art and followed it with a Graduate Diploma in Education at the Canberra University. I have had a creative career as a painter, sculptor and art teacher, before signing up for a Master of Fine Art at the National Art School in Darlinghurst.\n\nWhile I grew up during the Troubles and spent my adolescence navigating the political trenches of an oppressive, partitioned society, only recently have I begun making work about this formative experience.\n\n​\n\nUndertaking the MFA has facilitated a deep exploration into the effect of my past and has led to a greater understanding of who I am.\n\n​I have recently completed a Master of Fine Art Degree in Sculpture at the National Art School, Sydney.\n\nI am an artist and a teacher with a depth of experience developed while working across related sectors which demonstrate my skills in good administration, time and task management. I have consistently and successfully worked with diverse groups throughout my career.\n\nI have had successful solo and group exhibitions, exhibiting sculpture, painting and drawing. Many of these exhibitions have been held in community run spaces. I have also fulfilled various art commissions over the years and currently work in my own studio.\n\nI have travelled broadly and lived in Tokyo and London. During this time I participated within various communities developing my skills in understanding and adaptability.\n\nIn London I worked as a casual teacher at The Southbank International School as well as designing and presenting an after school arts program for the primary years."
