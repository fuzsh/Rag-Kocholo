        "text": "General Manager\n\nJoin Date: Oct 2000\n\nLocation: The Satellite of Love\n\nThe Forever War\n\nAwhile back, there was a thread on what books would people like turned into movies (Book you would like to see made into a movie - Front Office Football Central. Some people mentioned The Forever War by Joe Haldeman. Looks like that wish has finally come true.\n\nRidley Scott takes on 'Forever War' - Entertainment News, Los Angeles, Media - Variety\n\nFox 2000 has acquired rights to Joe HaldemanÂ’s 1974 novel \"The Forever War,\" and Ridley Scott is planning to make it into his first science fiction film since he delivered back-to-back classics with \"Blade Runner\" and \"Alien.\"\n\nScott intended to follow those films with \"The Forever War,\" but rights complications delayed his plans for more than two decades.\n\nCoordinator\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nLocation: Chicagoland\n\nBased on Blade Runner and, to a lesser extent, Alien, Scott's one of the few directors who might do the book justice, but I'd have to say I don't have a lot of hope for this."
