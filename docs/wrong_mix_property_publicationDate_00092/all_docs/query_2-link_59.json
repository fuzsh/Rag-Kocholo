        "text": "[This paper was presented at \"100 Years of Estrangement\", the academic track of Helsinki WorldCon (2017). It is adapted from the first chapter of my thesis, and should therefore be read as a work in progress.] Darko Suvin’s theory of cognitive estrangement originates in his 1975 “On the Poetics of the Science Fiction Genre,” wherein he defines SF as: a literary genre whose necessary and sufficient conditions are the presence and interaction of estrangement and cognition, and whose main formal device is an imaginative framework alternative to the author’s empirical environment. (375) Unlike genre definitions which draw on textual structure or plot delimitations, Suvin primarily bases his vision of SF on a cognitive experience imparted to the reader, a subtlety that neither he nor the multitude of critics who have drawn on his work have truly explored. This paper seeks to rectify this by the exploration of cognitive estrangement’s experiential core, examining how the SF text and SF reader work, in collaboration, toward its generation, and why SF, as a genre, provides it with such fertile ground. This paper first delineates the wider theory of estrangement, and its particular manifestation in SF critical theory. Utilising reader-response theory, it demonstrates how the SF critic might identify and analyse certain catalysts for estrangement in SF texts, and the interpretive and heuristic paths which they present to particular types of readers. It specifically posits that the fantastic text necessitates an immediate ontological inscription – that is, for the reader to progress through the text, the borders of its possible must be established, its reality bounded. This can be related to what Suvin terms the “feedback oscillation,” the cognitive and interpretive movement between personal and textual reality which results in an estranged view of both (Metamorphoses 71). The reading process is here fed not only by the individual reader’s cultural and educational capital, but, critically, their wider knowledge of the genre. Thus the textual reality might be understood not just by analogues in our consensus reality (feudalism transported to space is yet feudalism), but by other unrealities. The experienced reader will, for example, be aware of the possibility of ontological obfuscation – virtual reality, psychoactive visions, alternate universes, alternate timelines, and various other devices of narrative levelling. Even the text which employs no such devices is thereby subject to the need for ontological inscription – unstable until proven otherwise. In this regard, SF, as a genre, might be understood as working towards the destabilisation of the individual text; locating a text in the SF multiverse necessitates its distinguishing from the infinitely possible. While genre feeds this potential polysemy it also, however, consumes it, providing an experiential buffer between the reader and the nova of the SF world. Literary experience in the worlds of William Gibson will, for example, provide narrative touchstones in further cyberpunk – potentially naturalising their strange newness. Considering these twinned but oppositional cognitive movements, I argue, therefore, that the SF genre is ouroboric – that it is the genre itself which both provides and yet consumes the indeterminacy and impossibility of otherwise indigestible unreality.\n\nLem's most important study of science fiction Fantastyka i futurologia (Fantastic Literature and Futurology, 1970) contains a very detailed analysis of (mostly English language) science fiction (SF) literature, described by Lem as a \"marriage of Einstein with Scheherazade\". It is also an attempt to create an empirical theory of SF. This theory was intended to be a part of his more general `empirical theory of literature', as outlined in the earlier Filozofia przypadku (Philosophy of Chance). Fantastyka i futurologia (referred in this paper as FiF) is certainly not well known even in Lem's native Poland, so it should be no surprise that it was translated into only one principal foreign language. The main reason for this book's relative obscurity is its unusual status: a major theoretical treatise on a subject which was regarded (even in the 1970s) in most of the European academic circles as unworthy of any serious analysis. Thus people who were capable of fully understanding and appreciating FiF were actually so prejudiced that they did not bother to publish a critical analysis or even a review. On the other hand, the book was too academic and theoretical not only for the `ordinary' readers of SF, but also for critics of the genre and even fanzine editors. If FiF was translated into the English language, then there could be a chance for some critical reception. Unfortunately, there was no publisher prepared to take a risk and finance such a project. At the moment (in the early 2000s) there are only a few chapters available in English, and they are scattered around various periodicals (such as Science-Fiction Studies, further referred in this paper as S-FS) and collections (such as Microworlds), hence it is very difficult for non-Polish speakers to fully appreciate Lem's contribution to the analysis of the genre. As Lem's theory of SF is well-written, innovative, passed well the test of time, and (above all) can be regarded as the most important key to his own SF and futurology, it actually deserves more attention than any of his other works. The first volume of FiF, which is a subject of this paper, is titled `Structures'. It contains some highly theoretical reasoning on SF, which was (especially when it was originally published in 1970) without a precedent not only in Poland and the other countries of the former Soviet Bloc, but also in the West. The second volume is titled `Problem Fields of Fantastics'. It contains a detailed discussion of the major subjects of the genre and a critique of the way those subjects have been handled by the authors and critics. Because of political constraints, Lem discusses mostly Western writings, but this does not mean that he ignored his Eastern European colleagues - see, for example, his essay `About the Strugatsky's Roadside Picnic'. FiF is a continuation of the earlier study `SF' printed in 1962 in his collection of studies and essays Wejście na orbitę (Getting into Orbit). In this early study Lem rigorously investigated the theoretical basis of the genre, analysed in detail its major topics and themes and strongly criticised the SF prose written in the US and the UK between the early 1940s and late 1960s. According to Lem this Anglo-American SF was much more fictional than scientific, and thus akin to fairy tales for older children.\n\nAs a literary form science fiction has gradually worked its way into the global networks of academic discourse, but its infiltration has not prevented the persistence of certain head-scratching exclusions. Nowhere is this more apparent than with Lois McMaster Bujold, who has won four Hugo Awards for Best Novel (an achievement matched only by Robert Heinlein) and attracted a far-reaching, dedicated fan base, all while remaining largely ignored in academic circles. Some authors and texts are overlooked for understandable—if not entirely justifiable—reasons. This is not the case with Bujold, something Edward James makes abundantly clear in his Lois McMaster Bujold, part of the Modern Masters of Science Fiction series and the first full-length study of her work. Along with the 2013 collection of essays edited by Janet Brennan Croft, Lois McMaster Bujold: Essays on a Modern Master of Science Fiction, James’s text signals the growing (and long overdue) recognition of an author who has been academically neglected since her emergence in 1986. What comes through most vividly in his study is the intricacy of Bujold’s worldbuilding, the psychological depth of her characters, and the complexity of themes that are never simplified for the sake of easy consumption—features that make her absence from scholarly debate all the more perplexing.\n\nBig questions over the future of humankind have traditionally given legitimacy to popular stories about science and technology. Science fiction has long been credited with the ability to anticipate how audiences are prone to interpret the promises of technological progress. The genre of science fiction and its relevance to popular culture can also be construed as an excellent tool for reading the challenges of the present. Under capitalism and socialism, the complex uses of science fiction raised big moral and political questions, while challenging notions of literary style and visual aesthetics. Two trends have long been prevalent in science fiction: the first, that of totalitarian dystopia, started with classic literature. Off and on-screen, dystopian stories reveal a Panopticon society, where the pervasiveness of technology removes any hope of individual life. The second trend is that of climate fiction: narratives that imagine a world dramatically changed by the climate breakdown show that our society can always be brought back to a pre-modern state by resource scarcity and overpopulation. Ever more, totalitarian dystopia and climate fiction prove that their readers are of particular interest nowadays: they have the onerous task of trying to make sense of a growing body of literature that now points to the difficulty of telling apart reality from simulation. Ultimately, science fiction helps audiences look into the way we like to think that humankind is facing an increasingly technological present; it does so by framing this moment in time as having been shaped by a possible future.\n\nThe current issue of ContactZone deals with the way in which the very notion of binary subjectivity, slowly gives way to inclusive narratives, giving life to new characters that naturally inhabit the scenarios of contemporary science fiction through unstable roles and completely ‘de-generated’ narrations of identity. An important contribution to the cultural turn in sexual inclusiveness through the staging of ‘non-binary’ characters in the genre was first given by the special issue On Science Fiction and Queer Theory (Science-Fiction Studies, March 1999) and later by the collected essays Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction, edited by Wendy Gay Pearson, Veronica Hollinger, and Joan Gordon in 2008, both opening and tracing an innovative and stimulating critical discourse. As the editors state in their introduction (Pearson et al. 2008: 5): \"If we then take as the central task of queer theory the work of imagining a world in which all lives are liveable we understand queer theory as being both utopian and science fictional, in the sense of imagining a future which opens out, rather than forecloses possibilities for becoming real, for mattering in the world\". As the papers included in this issue explore the discursive and linguistic dimensions of the representation of sexualities in science fiction narratives, understanding the construction of such discourses necessarily requires an interdisciplinary approach, which ranges from literary criticism, critical discourse analysis, gender studies, corpus linguistics to sociolinguistics. In order to develop a comprehensive perspective on the topic investigated, four essays are devoted to fiction (both novels and short stories), one to plays, and one to a canonical TV series such as Star Trek. While ContactZone is aimed at an international community of scholars and well-informed readers, we do not want to forget our being rooted in the Italian academic context; at least three full-length volumes devoted to Anglo-American science fiction by women should be mentioned: Oriana Palusci, Terra di lei. L’immaginario femminile tra utopia e fantascienza (1990), Eleonora Federici, Quando la fantascienza è donna. Dalle utopie femminili del secolo XIX all’età contemporanea (2015) and Anna Pasolini and Nicoletta Vallorani, Corpi magici: Scritture incarnate dal fantastico alla fantascienza (2020). This is the reason why all six papers are written by Italian scholars, who are willing to measure their competence against a vast and expanding international critical body."
