        "text": "And we’ve arrived at the end, for now, of the Joe Haldeman series. I intend to definitely return to his work, but I have no definite date in mind.\n\nRaw Feed (2004): There Is No Darkness, Joe Haldeman & Jack C. Haldeman II, 1983.\n\nI find it interesting that most of the stories set in the Confederación universe, with the exception of the ones in Joe Haldeman’s All My Sins Remembered, are narrated in the first person — a favorite viewpoint of Joe Haldeman (the influence of Ernest Hemingway?) and that several of their titles are taken from Shakespeare: All My Sins Remembered is from Hamlet, this novel’s title is from Twelfth Night, and “A !Tangled Web” is also from Shakespeare.\n\nThis is an effective adventure tale with moral questions which is the best sort of work Joe Haldeman does. (I haven’t read enough of his brother to get a sense of style. I seem to recall Jack C. Haldeman II liked sports tales, so he might have made contributions to the several gladiatorial combats fought in the first third of the book.\n\nJoe Haldeman’s combat experience and study of history probably accounts for the war-as-game theme of the part on Hell. (It also reminded me of some of the war as formalized, bloody sport stories in the anthology he edited: Study War No More.)\n\nThe two brothers dedicate the book to their parents, but they could have dedicated it to Robert Heinlein since it captures the flavor of some of his juveniles.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd we’re now at the penultimate entry in my look at Joe Haldeman works.\n\nRaw Feed (2004): Vietnam and Other Alien Worlds, ed. Joe Haldeman, 1993.\n\n“Introduction”, — Introduction with brief notes on all the book’s contents. The fiction is all the short fiction set in Haldeman’s Confederación universe which is also the setting of one of my favorite Haldeman novels, All My Sins Remembered as well as There Is No Darkness (here oddly called Starschool — an alternate title?) written by the Haldeman brothers. Haldeman throws in some essays and journalisms not printed elsewhere and then some story poems which he sees as an attempt to revive public interest in poetry by presenting work that is “more interesting”. Haldeman has said once that, if he could, he would make his living as a poet. He takes his poetry seriously and says the book will explode in flames if the poetry isn’t read.\n\n“Passages” — This is the second time I’ve read this story, and I didn’t have much of a reaction to it beyond noting that it belongs to the old, pulp-science fiction subgenre of (as a couple of anthologies were titled) men hunting things and things hunting men. I did wonder, in the context of this being a Confederación story, if we’re ever going to again see the Obelobelians given that they’re a telepathic, highly advanced race that outwardly appears to be stone age primitives but has (or had) access to space travel. Given that their chemistry is alien to the planet they live on one wonders how, biochemically, they get food from the planet, but Haldeman doesn’t go into that. The balaseli initiation test is reminiscent of the initiation Paul Atreides undergoes at the beginning of Frank Herbert’s Dune. Haldeman, as a self-described pacificist and war veteran, has long had an interest in the questions surrounding violence, and I think that is a main source of the story’s ending where the protagonist (unlike Raj) survives by embracing the full, passive acceptance of his Buddhist philosophy. Haldeman, in the introduction to this collection, notes that this story shares a common character — Dr. Avedon, a xenologist — with a story in his fixup All My Sins Remembered. The latter takes place about a year later than this story according to Haldeman.\n\n“A !Tangled Web” — This is at least the third time I’ve read this story, and I enjoyed it the third time around just as much. It does give you some sense of the economic background of the Confederación (though it’s been a while since I’ve read All My Sins Remembered, so I don’t remember how much was in there), but then Haldeman doesn’t seem to interested in providing a detailed future history. The Confederación universe is just there to provide a colorful background for human interaction with a lot of aliens.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nAnd we continue with the Joe Haldeman series, in this an anthology he appeared in.\n\nRaw Feed (2001): Space Soldiers, eds. Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois, 2001.\n\n“Preface“, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois — A perfunctory introduction to the anthology and the general theme of combat in space.\n\n“The Gardens of Saturn“, Paul J. McAuley — This is another of McAuley’s Quite War series (so-called because the conflict between Outer System colonists and the Three Powers Alliance of Earth is less overt warfare and more sabotage, espionage, and propaganda). It’s not totally clear if it takes place before or after McAuley’s “Reef”. The evidence seems to be before. The scientist Sri Hong-Owen is rumored to have set up an illegal experiment in accelerated evolution in the Kuiper Belt for the Democratic Union of China. That experiment sounds an awful lot like the site explored in “Reef”; Hong-Owen is not mentioned in that story, but, of course, the events of that story confirm rumors of such an experiment. This story seems to take place at least 17 years after the end of the Quite War. The events of “Reef” take place more than 45 years after the end of the Quite War. Just as “Reef” involves the unpleasant social controls and milieu its contract scientists must work under, this story also, ultimately, revolves around issues of social control and, like “Reef”, evolution. At first, though, it has the flavor of film noir with its good-natured protagonist (if amnesiac after being extensively rebuilt), veteran Baker meeting the attractive, but down-and-out fellow veteran, Colonel Vera Flamillion Jackson. But she turns out to have a darker past than we first think. Not only is she a prostitute to the remittance man son of Hong-Owen, a very obese and rather simple man, but she has also been a convict. Like the femme fatales of film noir, she proposes a criminal scheme: a reverse kidnapping of her charge, Berry, and bringing him back to Hong-Owen’s base on an asteroid orbiting Saturn. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that Baker doesn’t really trust Jackson. He also refuses, during sex, to link his updated neural system (updated after he was recovered from drifting 15 years after an incident in the Quiet War) to hers. Baker looks upon Jackson as a pathetic individual who refuses to see the necessity to evolve by having her body further modified. When encountering Hong-Owen, Jackson’s plans fall apart, and she is killed. It is revealed that Hong-Owen is engineering people and herself to be something new in evolution: a consciousness that remains, surviving in various bodies including the mold-like being she has become that is filling the asteroid Epimetheus. Hong-Owen’s “clade” will remake themselves into a thousand forms to inhabit many environmental niches. Eventually, (recapitulating the theme of exploitation in “Reef”), Baker is forcibly given an implant by the clade which renders him a member, in a different form, of the clade but still absolutely loyal to it and Hong-Owen’s son, Berry. As the clade says, “Evolution is cruel” and that seems the theme of this story. The nagging “sidekick” personality and control system planted in Baker by his collective becomes much more controlling when the clade modifies it.\n\n“Soldiers Home“, William Barton — Barton is a poet of despair. In fact, at one point, the narrator even describes a scene and says “They write poems about this stuff.” This seems, given the mention of allomorph and the ARM Corporation, to be set in the same universe as Barton’s “Heart of Glass” and When We Were Real though it seems set later than those works since the narrator seems to be one of the last humans left after most were killed after being drafted by the Spinfellows for their war against the Starfish. The narrator returns to a deserted (because all the humans are dead) space colony to seemingly commit suicide. He finds a world inhabited by intelligent tools, mostly weapons from the war — zeppelin-like sharks, intelligent tanks, allomorphs (engineered female surrogates whose sexual services, presence, and conversation were designed to be therapeutic), and silvergirls (intelligent robots). Like the narrator, heavily engineered to be an artilleryman in the war, they are all tools looking for the peace of death. This is a story of existential angst as the narrator fights one last battle which kills the shark, some of the allomorphs, and the intelligent tank. He finds some sort of peace, as much as possible, with an allomorph whose attentions are simply the result of her programming. The story opens with the narrator saying the stars mean nothing, that they are “heaps of meaningless white light”, “an empty stage where we live and die”. And the story ends, after so many tools have been killed, with the narrator once again expressing the notion that he is doing little more than following pointless programming: “You do what you have to do. Because, sometimes all that’s left is life.” Barton is a master of depressing stories narrated in the first person.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nSame story as usual. While I write up new reviews, you get old stuff.\n\nIn this case, Far Horizons was an original anthology of writers setting new stories in their most popular universes. I did not read any of the anthology’s other works.\n\nRaw Feed (2000): “A Separate War”, Joe Haldeman.\n\nHaldeman, in his introductory remarks, sums up this story as a lacuna to his The Forever War. It covers Marygay Potter’s life from the time she is separated from protagonist William Mandella to their reunion at the very end of the novel. The story takes up at the end of the novel’s section entitled “Lieutenant Mandella” and takes place at the same time as the final section, “Major Mandella”. It starts before their final separation.\n\nInterestingly, Potter (who, it must be said, narrates the story in much the same voice as William Mandella but with less black humor) mentions events when she and Mandella went back to Earth. The events she mentions are from Haldeman’s “You Can Never Go Back” which are inconsistent with events in the novel. Plotwise, it’s interesting that Marygay’s homosexual affair with Cat, mentioned in The Forever War sequel, Forever Free, is foreshadowed by watching lesbian sex show on Heaven and her greater comfort with homosexuality than Mandella. Indeed, this story shows that relationship.\n\nIt was also neat to see the encounter of Potter’s troops with Man and Taurans after their peace – ironically there are still casualties when automatic weapons are not shut off in time.\n\nWhile I work on new postings, you get another Raw Feed about a Joe Haldeman work.\n\nRaw Feed (1998): Forever Peace, Joe Haldeman, 1997.\n\nAs Haldeman makes clear in his short author’s note, this book is not a plot sequel to his The Forever War, but it is examination of some of that book’s themes, and I think it draws some of its power through reference to that novel.\n\nBy itself, this book opens strongly. All throughout the book is Haldeman’s terse style which features the verbal hooks of irony, understatement, and a delay in revealing crucial information. He chooses a rather odd combination of first-person narration by Julian Case and third person omniscient narration.\n\nThe novel opens with a depiction of soldierboys, military robots operated remotely, in use. They are operated by “mechanics” “jacked” into them. The jack is a brain implant that allows full remote transmission and reception (though the traffic either way can be filtered) of sensory input as well as controlling the movements of the soldierboys.\n\nThe jacks create a subculture amongst their possessors. In the military, a platoon of soldierboys, during their ten-day tour of duty, has an intimate, gestalt-like connection to one another. Outside the military, people jack into records of other people’s sensory experiences or have sex with fellow jack possessors. There is even a group of ex-mechanics (mostly women – the jacks cannot easily be removed) who hang around as prostitutes hoping to jack with mechanics.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe look at some Joe Haldeman works continues while I work on new stuff.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): The Hemingway Hoax, Joe Haldeman, 1990.\n\nI have mixed reactions to this novel.\n\nUp to the last two chapters, I enjoyed it a lot. They left me puzzled though.\n\nThis is a fun short novel. The idea of a Hemingway expert attempting to forge some lost Hemingway manuscripts and incurring the wrath of “an interdimensional literary critic with a license to kill” (a great line from the dust jacket that appears nowhere in the novel) was the best part of the novel. The interaction between the agent from STAB (The Spacio-Temporal Adjustment Board) and John Baird, Hemingway expert, was blackly, grimly funny as the STAB agent first tries, unsuccessfully, to talk Baird out of forging the manuscripts and then tries, again unsuccessfully, to kill him (with “Happy cancer”). The conversations between the different entities of STAB have the same quality with their dark, cryptic references to the STAB agent’s involvement with the Manson murders.\n\nBaird is an interesting character not only for his photographic memory but the insight he has into other people’s characters. He fully expects and suspects his betrayal by his wife and con-man Sylvester Castlemaine with their affair. Baird flitting from alternate universe to alternate universe was interesting, particularly in seeing how he varied (he is in full possessions of all sets of memory from all universes that his mind goes to) in each one and how his relationships to others change. Castlemaine changes from semi-lovable, roguish conman to dangerous psychopath.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhile I work on new stuff, you get a Raw Feed on an anthology with a Joe Haldeman poem in it. Normally, I wouldn’t bother for just a poem, but Haldeman is a very good poet. I have his poetry collection Saul’s Death.\n\nRaw Feed (1989): Blood Is Not Enough: 17 Stories of Vampirism, ed. Ellen Datlow, 1989.\n\n“Introduction“, Ellen Datlow — An introduction tracing, in brief, the evolution of vampire stories from Bram Stoker’s Dracula to second-generation sub-genre pieces in which the authors expect readers to know what vampires are, their strengths and limitations, and play with those conventions to bring issues of ethics and emotions into the sub-genre. Datlow alo makes clear that the anthology is to deal with a broader and much more interesting definition of vampirism: the “draining of energy, the sucking of the will, the life force itself.”\n\n“Carrion Comfort“, Dan Simmons — A story whose chillingness lies more in the philosophy and attitudes of the vampirical characters than in the gruesomeness of the plot. These genteel people who casually, callously use others to perpetrate acts of violent mayhem not just for survival but clearly pleasure. The ambivalent attitude of the narrator Melanie was particularly disturbing. Does she truly think to mend her violent ways out of ethical considerations — even though it will seal her doom — or has she simply tired of Feeding? If the former, the story certainly has her lapsing easily into old, horrible habits with her casual using up of people in her fight with Nina. The willing of the porter to kill himself and two others seems needless reversion to cruelty. For that matter, Melanie did not give up her control of Mr. Thorne after she dropped out of the Game. Perhaps (and probably) his mind was permanently burned out, but control of others and its advantages are hard addictions to break even though Melanie does not exploit a girl but sets her free. In the end, it’s doubtful Melanie will restrain her feeding. Simmons has written a compelling story of the exercise of control and how this is a fantasy we all indulge in occasionally and occasionally bring to life. However, I disagree with him that this is a primary attraction of the vampire story.\n\n“The Sea Was Wet as Wet Could Be“, Gahan Wilson — In this clever story, Gahan Wilson proves he has as much talent as a writer as cartoonist. Wilson effectively brings an edge of horror to Lewis Carroll’s seemingly (at the surface) innocent poem of “The Walrus and the Carpenter”.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOver at Science Fiction and Other Suspect Ruminations, Joachim Boaz mentioned Joe Haldeman’s Mindbridge and The Forever War. Like Boaz, I’m also a Haldeman fan. I’ve read a lot of his work — and there’s a lot of his work still on the shelf unread. Some of it I read before I ever made notes on my reading much less starting this blog.\n\nSo, I thought, between reviews of new stuff, I’d post some Raw Feeds on some Haldeman works I haven’t covered.\n\nRaw Feed (1990): Buying Time, Joe Haldeman, 1989.\n\nHaldeman, in this novel, exhibits his trademark style: a fast-paced story of hard science and action told with a grace of sparse writing (that looks easy but isn’t) and cynical, wry, black humor.\n\nHere Haldeman tackles the immortal/longevity theme of science fiction. As usual with Haldeman, he has given thought to the complexities of his subject but doesn’t let that slow his narrative pace or clutter his style. The idea of a very complex life renewing treatment purchased every ten years at the cost of a million pounds or an entire fortune, whichever is more, is well worked out.\n\nHaldeman shows the Stileman Clinics as concentrating the wealth they get from “immortals” put towards social reform — one possible solution to the problem of immortals accumulating huge amounts of wealth. Haldeman raises the interesting point that money, in the hands of “immortals” may lead, unlike “ephemeral” financing, to funding of long-term projects like space colonization.\n\nHaldeman also addresses the problems of immortals cheating on their financial dealings which require turning over all their wealth to the Stileman Clinics. The latter tacitly ignores this requirement so they can have repeat customers and the clinics themselves are corrupt.\n\nContinue reading →"
