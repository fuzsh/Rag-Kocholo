        "text": "Jim here. Steve over at Collider had an awesome round table with Zack Snyder (300, WATCHMEN) and producer Debbie Snyder (Zack's wife) recently and Zack spoke out about his upcoming 3D projects SUCKER PUNCH (3D conversion) and LEGENDS OF THE GUARDIANS (native 3D) as well as 3D in general.\n\nZack always has interesting things to say and I had the opportunity to see parts of GUARDIANS at ShoWest this year - let me tell you, it was gorgeous! You will have to see it for yourself, but it is extremely well done visually and stereoscopically. Keep in mind that it is definitely a family movie, but stunning nevertheless.\n\nIf you are not up to speed on his upcoming movies - here are the rundowns:\n\nSUCKER PUNCH is an epic action fantasy that takes us into the vivid imagination of a young girl, whose dream world provides the ultimate escape from her darker reality. Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her but her incredible adventures blur the lines between what’s real and what is imaginary…with potentially tragic consequences.\n\nLEGENDS OF THE GUARDIANS (trailer below) follows Soren, a young owl enthralled by his father’s epic stories of the Guardians of Ga’Hoole, a mythic band of winged warriors who had fought a great battle to save all of owlkind from the evil Pure Ones. While Soren dreams of someday joining his heroes, his older brother, Kludd, scoffs at the notion, and yearns to hunt, fly and steal his father’s favor from his younger sibling. But Kludd’s jealousy has terrible consequences-causing both owlets to fall from their treetop home and right into the talons of the Pure Ones. Now it is up to Soren to make a daring escape with the help of other brave young owls. Together they soar across the sea and through the mist to find the Great Tree, home of the legendary Guardians of Ga’Hoole-Soren’s only hope of defeating the Pure Ones and saving the owl kingdoms.\n\nHere is what Zack and Debbie had to say on their 3D process and upcoming movies...\n\nZack: \"We did 3D from the very beginning on this. The very first images were all…we put into 3D.\"\n\nDebbie: \"Were made on 3D, not converted.\"\n\nZack: \"We made this movie with the intent of 3D though I’m doing them exactly at the same time, so it’s different. Like for instance, the difference is when we were working on “Guardians” I said okay, I want because it’s an owl world the movie takes place at night, right? 90%. And so if we were shooting the movie in an owl world with owl cameras, the film would have a very shallow depth of field because we’d be shooting at night. We wouldn’t have a lot of light. So everything would be like a 1-3 or like a 1-9 like super skinny focus. And so that was a thing that I was like okay, that’s the mandate. Do that, always. And we built a big camera bible. It has all these like rules like things you could do and couldn’t do. Like I didn’t want…all the flying shots had to look like they were basically being photographed from some kind of a rig. Like another flying…like an owl with a camera on his back or I don’t know how…I was very militant about that stuff. When you go to 3D, the shallow focus is a bit of a thing, right? So there’s a little bit of a trade-off because most 3D movies everything’s in focus. That’s how you get the depth, right because the foreground is jumping out from the background. But if you, for example, at that shot where the feather comes at you at the very end of the trailer, the feather comes at you and the focus goes to it and the background goes out of focus but the feather really feels like it’s out. Those are the kinds of things that we…that’s not intuitive to 3D to do big out of focus playing with the feather or with an object popping out of the out of focus. So there was a lot of R&D that we worked on to try and get that to work throughout the entire film. And in some cases in the 3D version, the focus actually had to be extended as opposed to the 2D version of the movie we kept it skinny but because it’s all done on the computer the focus is applied. So everything is in focus, we apply the focus later. And so in 3D it’s actually easier to stretch that because the elements are all there and they’re all in focus. So there was a bit of a process that went on to find the right…without me saying like…because I won’t give it up entirely. I’m like no, I don’t want the whole thing in focus. But I do appreciate that for the 3D to work better, more focus is required. But those are the kind of conversations we had and have been having in the process to sort of understand the best way to render the 3D. Now, that said, and I think that when you actually watch the trailer you can see how clean the 3D is, it’s like super clean. Now the interesting thing is, we’re going to be converting “Sucker Punch” to 3D, so it’s like a different process. Although I feel like actually having done “Guardians”, I have a really good sensibility at this point to be able to manage that conversion process without it just being a gimmick that we slap on top of the movie.\"\n\nDebbie: \"And because of the way shooting a lot of the things against green-screen and when we have separate elements to play with, it gives us…it’s kind of different than if it’s just a norm…like kind of I say normal but like a film that’s just not shot that way. Because we can play with these elements more. We have them already isolated. It gives us more latitude.\"\n\nZack wraps up by revealing both movies WILL be at Comicon! Awesome. I am really looking forward to Xerxes too (Events that take place about 10 years prior to the movie 300). Thanks to Collider for the interview and be sure to catch the rest of it right here.\n\nMichael here with a rundown of the S3D stuff happening at NAB in April. The show will be filled with S3D educational sessions and high profile speakers such as Vince Pace, Steve Schklair, Barry Sandrew, Chuck Comisky, Buzz Hays and many more luminaries from all corners of the S3D world.\n\nThe Digital Cinema Summit on Saturday and Sunday is entirely dedicated to all aspects of S3D, and on Monday and Tuesday there will be even more sessions, including ones on the makings of Alice in Wonderland, How to Train Your Dragon, and Hubble 3D:\n\nCheck out the schedule below:\n\nDigital Cinema Summit - Saturday & Sunday:\n\nSaturday, April 10\n\nUnderstanding Stereopsis and 3D Image Capture\n\nSaturday, 04/10/2010 8:45am - 9:45am\n\nRoom S222\n\nThis session will provide a review of how the human visual system perceives depth, and the fundamentals of stereoscopic imaging. In addition, common techniques for live 3D image capture using stereoscopic camera rigs will be explained, including benefits and pitfalls, and a variety of 3D capture tools will be demonstrated. Other topics will include imaging parameters such as the setting of interaxial distance (baseline) and convergence, plus causes of eyestrain in improperly crafted 3D images. Finally, factors such as hyperstereo, divergence and accommodation will be explained and demonstrated.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nPeter Lude, Senior Technology Executive, Sony Electronics\n\nSteve Schklair, CEO, 3ality Digital Systems LLC.\n\n3D Programming: Lessons Learned\n\nSaturday, 04/10/2010 10:00am - 11:00am\n\nRoom S222\n\nStereoscopic motion imaging is fundamentally different than 2D. To be most effective, the 3D production crew will take a different approach to depth of field, camera positions, zoom moves, intercutting and graphic compositing. In this session, we'll hear from pioneering 3D content producers to learn what factors must be considered in planning high-quality 3D coverage of different program genres.\n\nModerator(s):\n\nAl Barton, Consultant, Freelance Digital\n\nPanelist(s):\n\nPierre de Lespinois, Co-Founder, Evergreen Films\n\nThomas Edwards, VP, Digital Television Testing & Evaluation, FOX\n\n3D Conversion\n\nSaturday, 04/10/2010 11:00am - 12:00pm\n\nRoom S222\n\nWith the recent announcements of multiple 3DTV channels in U.S., Asia and Europe, will there be enough natively-captured 3D content? Many content producers are investigating if it is feasible to convert existing 2D material to stereoscopic 3D. Others are considering shooting new programs in 2D and then converting to 3D, versus natively-capturing in 3D. Is real-time 3D conversion a viable option or are humans needed to make the creative adjustments to create acceptable 3D images? This panel will discuss various issues related to 3D conversion from the point of view of content producers, distributors and 3D conversion experts.\n\nModerator(s):\n\nBrad Collar, Vice President, Technology, Warner Bros.\n\nSpeaker(s):\n\nBarry Sandrew, Ph.D, Founder and President/COO, Legend3-D, A Legend Films Company\n\nChris Alexander, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications & Publicity, Twentieth Century Fox Television\n\nChris Yewdall, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer, DDD USA, Inc.\n\nWarren Littlefield, President, The Littlefield Company\n\nA Case for Quality in Production and Post-Production\n\nSaturday, 04/10/2010 2:30pm - 3:15pm\n\nRoom S222\n\nThis panel focuses on the creation of high-quality 3D in broadcast, feature film and other production types. Discussion will cover all aspects of production and post-production that relate to the creation of a comfortable stereoscopic viewing experience. It will also include specific areas of the creative side that contribute to the highest quality 3D possible, while minimizing discomfort and eye strain.

Got a huge announcement for all you Phish fans out there (and I know there is a lot of them!): PHISH 3D will be hitting the S3D screens April 30 for a one week run with a limited preview of the concert movie in nine US cities on April 20.\n\nCheck out the movie's trailer below!\n\nI found out about the movie during ShoWest and was pleasantly surprised when I saw what band was headlining. I took a photo of their poster but it was not official yet so they asked me to hold off for awhile. But now it is all out there!\n\nFrom their press release: The more than two hour movie, presented by Action 3D Productions in association with Network LIVE and Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp., highlights Phish’s Festival 8, a three-day, eight-set, 16-hour concert in the Southern California desert.\n\nIn advance of the nationwide roll-out, exclusive preview screenings will be shown in nine cities - Boston; Burlington, VT; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Los Angeles; New York; Raleigh/Durham, NC; and Washington, D.C.-- on April 20th. In addition to experiencing this special screening, fans in attendance will take home a Phish 3D movie poster. The fully immersive music and visual experience, featuring state-of-the-art 3D technology, gives viewers the sense that they are not only at the event, but on stage with the band that Entertainment Weekly has called “the biggest cult band in America.” Phish 3D features fan favorites, never before seen cover songs, and intimate footage of the band backstage and in rehearsals.\n\nFilmed in October 2009 at the band’s Festival 8, more than 40,000 devoted fans watched as Phish combined two of their most beloved traditions — the multi-day festival and the Halloween album “costume.” The band’s highly anticipated \"musical costumes\" are concerts involving the performance of an entire album by another artist—in this case, Phish covered the Rolling Stones’ album Exile on Main St. Phish 3D also features songs from the band’s first ever full-length acoustic set, as well as performances taken from the six additional sets.\n\nTickets for the Tuesday, April 20th screenings will be available for purchase on Friday, March 26 (individual theater on-sale dates may be subject to change).

It seems like Michael Bay is against the idea of converting Tranformers 3 to 3D, and James Cameron is also speaking out against quick conversion jobs.\n\nCheck out the below quote from Bay, From Deadline.com:\n\nI shoot complicated stuff, I put real elements into action scenes and honestly, I am not sold right now on the conversion process.... Right now, it looks like fake 3-D, with layers that are very apparent. You go to the screening room, you are hoping to be thrilled, and you're thinking, huh, this kind of sucks. People can say what they want about my movies, but they are technically precise, and if this isn't going to be excellent, I don't want to do it. And it is my choice.... I'm used to having the A-team working on my films, and I'm going to hand it over to the D-team, have it shipped to India and hope for the best? This conversion process is always going to be inferior to shooting in real 3-D. Studios might be willing to sacrifice the look and use the gimmick to make $3 more a ticket, but I'm not. Avatar took four years. You can’t just shit out a 3D movie. I’m saying, the jury is still out.”\n\nAnd Cameron says: (also from Deadline)\n\nAfter Toy Story, there were 10 really bad CG movies because everybody thought the success of that film was CG and not great characters that were beautifully designed and heartwarming. Now, you’ve got people quickly converting movies from 2D to 3D, which is not what we did. They’re expecting the same result, when in fact they will probably work against the adoption of 3D because they’ll be putting out an inferior product.\n\nI love how Bay is never afraid to speak his mind about what he thinks is best for his movies. And I agree with Cameron that studios are taking the wrong message from the success of Avatar: Conversions, if they aren't going to harm S3D in the long run, need to be of a high quality.\n\nOf course, my real hope is that we see more films shot natively in 3D. I know Bay says his shooting style is too aggressive for 3D cameras and that, according to Deadline, he found them too heavy and cumbersome for the fast pace action scenes he shoots. However, I think he could definitely find a way to make it work. Look what Nolan did with those huge IMAX cameras on The Dark Knight.\n\nJim here. I wish I had better news for you - I really do. Being a 3D advocate is not easy at times and this is one of them.\n\nI saw select scenes from CLASH OF THE TITANS and I was quite dismayed at what I saw. All in all it was about 8 minutes. Keep in mind that this presentation was made in front of theater owners - the ones who make the decision on how to promote movies at the local level.\n\nWe know that Warner Bros. decided to go with a rush job of converting the movie to 3D in post. Turns out, it seems it was a bad idea. While many theater goers may not notice the things that I notice, there were serious problems with what I saw.\n\n1. Flat backgrounds: During several scenes when examining the far distance it was as if it were simply painted on a matte while other objects in the foreground popped. I shook my head every time I saw it.\n\n2. Distortion / Blurriness: Quite often, especially in the action sequences (which was most of the clip) objects were very blurry and distorted. It was horrible. I have no other word for it.\n\n3. Ghosting: Yes, there was a lot of ghosting in the scenes, some worse then others. There is no excuse for this for this type of screening. I will say that there is a possibility that the ghosting was due to the 3D projection being used. In this case, it was Dolby 3D.\n\nSo, bottomline - should you go see this movie? Yes. In 2D. Will it be better in 3D? My estimation at this time is no. I will be seeing it in both formats and I will let you know when I do. I found their attempt at 3D very distracting and this is EXACTLY what we do not want at this time. A lackadaisical attempt at a hurried 3D solution.\n\nC'mon guys. You know better than this. What did you expect? I can see Warners being sucked into the demo reels of the conversion company which were probably pretty darn good. Even the test reels for TITANS was probably excellent. But a whole movie in that timeframe will have issues - at least at this time. Conversion is getting better every day.\n\nLater in the Warner reel we saw how 3D should be done: LEGENDS OF THE GUARDIANS. I will have more on that later.\n\nI am posting this from McCarran Airport in Vegas and I have to board in a few minutes so will be posting much later as I cross the country.\n\nHere's hoping that somehow something was amiss with the screening here at ShoWest and the movie will come out smelling like roses. Somehow I don't think so. It's a shame because Warners has shown tremendous support to 3D this year and I love them for it. But it has to be done right."
