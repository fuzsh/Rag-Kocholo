        "text": "Annalee Flower Horne | August 9, 2006 09:53 AM\n\nKate Nepveu, as I understand it (and I should probably offer up the disclaimer that I avoid the HP fandom like the plague, so all I know is what's turned up on fandom_wank), it was a lot more than just the pages she lifted from the book. It was also a whole lot of dialogue from Joss Whedon's work. Which was of course neither obscure nor out of print at the time. I can sort of buy that she might have expected everyone to recognize it and see it as an homage, but she apparantly accepted praise for said dialogue without any attempt to clarify. With all the ills in the world, ripping off Joss Whedon in a really obvious way isn't really high on my list of things to get my knickers in a twist over, but I can see why people got peeved.\n\n1. I'm interested in hearing an argument from fanficcers (or fanfic fans) as to why plagiarism in fanfic is any worse of a copyright violation (and moral issue) than the copyright violation which allows fanfic to exist at all; i.e., fanfic's original sin of misappropriating characters and settings owned by others.\n\nHm. Well, look at it this way: If someone took something you posted on Whatever (let's say something long and cool, for the sake of argument) and put it on their own blog without asking, it might be mildly annoying. Maybe they credit you but forget to provide a link; maybe they do provide a link. Either way, it's a mild violation of netiquitte and they've technically violated your copyright, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not worth getting ridiculously upset over. They're not costing you any money, and maybe you're getting new readers out of it. Kinda like with fanfic-- it's illegal, but in the end, no harm, no foul. Most copyright holders just don't really care.\n\nBut if that same person took that same post from Whatever, put it up on their site without credit so that it looked like all their other posts, and then accepted praise for the post as if it were their own writing, that would be a much bigger deal. People, both Whatever readers and others (and I assume you as well, but you know what they say about assumptions) would get peeved and tell them to credit you/take it down. If said hypothetical blogger tried to claim that they never intended anyone to think it was her work, because she just assumed everyone would be familiar with your blog, people would call bull.\n\nThat, as I see it, is the difference. Fanfiction is benign violation of copyright. Plagiarism, fanfic or no, in malignant violation of copyright.\n\n2. Even if one can make the argument above, why the sins of this particular author within the field of fanfic should be made to follow them outside the world of fanfic, in the absence of evidence that their plagiarizing ways have continued outside of this particular realm.\n\nDisinclined to argue with you here. I think it's tacky of her to use her fandom cred to promote her pro work, but I'd think that even if she hadn't been accused of plagiarism several times. In my fandom (Star Wars), that's a big no-no. But HP has always rolled a little differently than the rest of us where Fear of Lawsuit is concerned, so maybe that's perfectly normal for them. If she plagiarises in her pro work too, I'll get pissed. Until then... meh. It makes for good fandom_wank humor, and that's pretty much the extent to which I care.\n\nGwen | August 9, 2006 11:13 PM\n\nO.K., just to answer this way upthread:\n\n\"So, one thing I have always wondered about is the use of one person's literary invention by another author.\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin, IIRC, came up with the Ansible, and this seems to have been co-opted by a number of people into their work, e.g. Orson Scott Card in his Ender books.\n\nIs this somewhere where OSC has been granted permission by UKLG, or does the use of a single SF \"invention\" not run afoul of copyright?\"\n\nFrom what I recall of what OSC said in his introduction to the edition of Ender's Game that I own, he was so new to science fiction that he didn't realize that FTL communication was as common as it is; he'd just read about the ansible in LeGuin's work and needed it for his story. So, in an effort to give credit where credit was due (even though best I can tell Simultaneity and philotic physics are rather different principles to base it on), he called it an \"ansible\" after her device. The gods of irony must have had a hand in that one...\n\nAlthough I think that the discussion about the legal status of fanfic is interesting, I think it's not really related to the morality problem (except that laws should ideally fit in with morality). Because if fanfic is copyright infringement and illegal, plagiarism *isn't* (necessarily, although it can be, and I don't know if it would or wouldn't be in this instance) if I understand it right.\n\nSo...saying that fanfic is copyright infringement and so illegal, and therefore plagiaristic fanfic isn't any worse because it's equally illegal--even if fanfic is illegal, and plagiaristic fanfic is equally illegal--isn't really the question. We agree (I think) that fanfic made about the universes of authors who specifically ban it is worse than fanfic made about the universes of authors who are all right with it (and have said so)...but are those really different, legally speaking?*\n\nTo boil it down: is fanfic illegal--and if so, in which cases (and what counts as fanfic, but I think I have a pretty good radar for telling even if it wouldn't hold up in court, and let's not discuss the marginal cases)? Is fanfic immoral--and if so, in what cases? Is the work of She Who Must Not Be Named illegal, and is it immoral? And is it worth getting worked up about and bringing it over to taint what work she does in other areas?\n\nMy take is: I have no idea if fanfic is illegal or not. I think it's immoral if it's done against the author's permission, and iffy if it's done without the author's permission but not with it either, and perfectly all right if the author lets the fanficcers play in the yard. I don't know if She's work is illegal, but I think it was immoral, because she lied about the origin of her words to her readers (and that this is a qualitatively different moral situation than using characters and the world with full attribution). And I don't think she should be actively pursued; if it's as big as everyone's saying I think any publisher she gets is going to be wary anyway, so hopefully she won't have the chance to plagiarize in print and fool all of her dead-tree readers too (but if that does happen, the publisher should definitely be held responsible for not checking her work thoroughly enough and it should be publicized all over the place). It's not necessary, and if the people doing it think it's not necessary too then they're just being malicious, as I see it (though I can see why they might hold that malice...).\n\nFull disclosure: I don't write fanfic. It never touches paper or computer or even air. I daydream and Mary Sue to my heart's content in my favorite universes, but there's no way I'm going to go about writing it down where people can criticize my bad writing now, and lack of originality and bad writing later when I become famous and people pick over everything I did. (Arrogant fantasies of the future help me live a better life, don't fault me. )\n\n-Gwen.\n\n* This isn't a rhetorical question; the \"authorized works\" comment's given me pause. Does it count if the fanfic author was only given the blanket-all-of-fandom nod from the original author? Or does it have to specific and all legal-y?\n\nJohn Scalzi | August 10, 2006 08:31 AM\n\nMichael Crichton:\n\n\"Disney already Courtesy of sics their lawyers on day care centers for having unauthorized paintings.\"\n\nYeah, I knew that's what you were thinking of. My response: What? Disney, defending its trademarks and copyrights against unlicensed use in a commercial enterprise? Who would have thought? Disney has an excellent argument there: When the local news trucks pull up to do a story about the day care center helper feeding the kids rum at naptime, it'd rather not have Mickey and pals associated.\n\nThis is certainly not an arbitrary use of the law: Disney is obliged to to police its trademarks for one, and inasmuch as Mickey is under copyright (and will continue to be so as long as Disney can help it, but that's another story), Disney is well within its right to say what commercial enterprises may or may not associate itself with the company's intellectual property.\n\nAs a matter of law, none of that has anything to do with my ability to paint Mickey on the wall of my daughter's room.\n\nAgribusiness: 50 years ago, agribusinesses didn't own patents for genetic strains of plants they had spent millions of dollars in developing; it's neither arbitrary nor unreasonable to suggest that businesses should be allowed to profit from the (in this case literal) fruits of their labor. We can argue as to whether it's right and moral to allow patents on genetics at all, of course, but as a matter of the practical application of patent law, this is pretty standard stuff. And of course, patent law is not anywhere on point to me painting Mickey on my wall.\n\nThat one time in Europe where someone said someone couldn't do something: I'm supposed to be worried that a nebulous anecdotal event in an entirely different country has some sort of import on my ability to paint a cartoon character on my daughter's wall here in the US? I can't begin to tell you how not concerned I am about that.\n\nChad Orzel:\n\n\"Granted, there's a difference between a publically visible barn roof (you could see it from I-88, which is how I know about it), and a more private space, but you won't get far assuming that big companies have a sense of humor about this sort of thing.\"\n\nWell, let's make sure we don't minimize that difference; let's also note, as I bet the lawyers did, that a farm is a commercial enterprise.\n\nPatrick Nielsen Hayden:\n\n\"Come on. In a world in which corporate copyright holders are shaking down grandmothers for three or four grand because their kids downloaded a track on Kazaa, the scenario posed by \"Mike Crichton\" is hardly an 'unrealistic future hypothetical.'\"\n\nBah.\n\nThe RIAA is stupid and odious for following its program of spot-and-sue, but nonetheless has a clear legal argument for doing so under law: Taking tracks online without paying for them is theft. Me painting a picture of Mickey Mouse in my child's room for her private enjoyment is well understood under law to be fair use and that sort of fair use has a long line of precedent. The sort of organized rights theft corporations would have to engage in to get us from today to a point where I was legally enjoined from painting Micky on my kid's wall is entirely unrealistic -- and certainly not achievable in the \"near future.\"\n\nIf we want to talk about copright abuses that go on in the real world, then by all means let's talk about them; let's just not start by rhetorically driving the conversation into screeching insensibility via the wild-eyed future hypothetical.\n\nKate Nepveu:\n\n\"And while all discussions of fanfic end in the same place, where we've ended up, John did start this discussion by asking the difference between fanfic and plagiarism, and so I'd really like to see the two not conflated by mistake.\"\n\nAgreed. I've noticed in commentary about this entry elsewhere online that people have made the mistake of conflating the two (or, more accurately, thinking that I've made the mistake of conflating the two); let's try to avoid it here.\n\nDean | August 10, 2006 09:49 AM\n\nMike Crichton:\n\nDisney already Courtesy of sics their lawyers on day care centers for having unauthorized paintings. What's so unrealistic about them going a few steps further? Fifty years ago, the idea that farmers could be sued for saving seeds from one crop to plant another would be seen as ridiculous; Now, the Agribusinesses claim it's perfectly reasonable.\n\nMy point was, when laws are as arbitrary as this, what do you do when the legal standard shifts and something that you had always thought was perfectly OK gets declared illegal? Was it _always_ \"wrong\", and you just never knew it? Or is the only thing that made it \"wrong\" corporate pressure and political whim? I heard something on NPR a while ago about the owners of some famous European building (sorry I can't be more specific, it was right before I deployed to Iraq, so I had other things on my mind :-) claiming that it was IP theft for tourists to take pictures, and that they had to pay official, licensed camera-men to do it for them. This wasn't a museum or anything, this was the ecterior of a public building.\n\nAs is usual in these discussions, copyright and trademark and plagiarism and patent get all mixed up together.\n\nAgribusiness is patent law, and is not related to trademark/copyright/plagiarism in any way. Patent law is clear and unequivocal, and a red herring in this discussion.\n\nThat said, IANAL, but I've been through this argument several times.\n\nThe Disney situation and the situation of the lights on the Eiffel Tower are examples of trademark law. Mickey Mouse is registered as a trademark, and Disney is required by that law to defend that trademark whenever they are made aware of potential violations. Trademark law is vast and labarythian, but the general principle is that trademarks are difficult to aquire, and easily lost. Hence the lawyer-enriching arguments between Apple Computer and Apple Records, for example, and hence the requirement under law for Disney to send cease-and-desist letters to daycares who paint Mickey Mouse on their walls.\n\nI don't recall the resolution in the Eiffel Tower situation. I remember reading about it and finding that it isn't anywhere near as simple as someone trying to trademark a public building. It is one of those that falls into the grey area, and if memory serves, the problem wasn't people taking pictures of the Eiffel Tower at night, it was people SELLING pictures of same. Very different, but as usual in these sorts of discussion, the little things get forgotten.\n\nCopyright is very different from trademark, and John and PNH (among others posting in this thread) likely both understand it and can explain it better than I can, but copyright exists automatically, doesn't have to be registered, and doesn't have to be defended. In the case of fanfic, it is the copyright owner's right to control 'derivative works', which fanfiction clearly is. This is the main issue with fanfic. It is, under the law, a 'derivative work', and permission is clearly and specifically required before anyone can 'publish' same.\n\nThe grey area comes in the definition of 'publish'. Fanfic has slid under the radar by using a wink-wink definition of 'publishing' as being 'publishing-for-profit'. Hence, the serious fanficcers' violent reaction to anyone making a dime off the stuff. They (probably correctly) believe that Big Publishing won't bother them unless people start selling derivative works. Therefore, they tacitly maintain that publishing for free ain't really publishing, and therefore it's ok. (Whether or not it's ok is a religious issue, and I won't go into it here.)\n\nPlagiarism is the unattributed regurgitation of the writing of another. It is not, as far as I know, illegal, but it is unethical, and it will ruin your career as a writer.\n\nIt is not possible to plagiarize ideas. For example, Dan Brown's extensive borrowings of material for the Da Vinci Code are not plagiarism, nor is it copyright violation. Copyright extends to the specific execution of the idea.\n\nWhere something strays from acceptable borrowing to derivative work is unclear to me. I doubt that I would be allowed to write about a wizard school with a main character named Larry Potter, for example, but a wizard school set in New England with completely different character names? That's probably ok. In fact I think it's been done.\n\nHalDuncan | August 10, 2006 01:26 PM\n\nThere's three issues here which muddy the matter, as far as I'm concerned; fanfic and plagiarism both need to be judged in terms of legality and morality (from mores -- socially-proscribed group standards) but we also have to judge in terms of ethics (from ethos individually-selected personal standards).\n\nNow, currently, both fanfic and plagiarism have legal injunctions against them. In the hope of explicating how and why we have differences over the is/is-not and should-be-should-not, here's a very simple analogue: A story requires background, characters and textual rendition just as a song has music, lyrics and audio rendition. In stories those three things tend to be done by the same person, but in songs it's quite common for them to be done by different people entirely -- e.g. you might have Burt Bacharach writing music, Hal David writing the lyrics and Dusty Springfield rendering them both in a performanve. To use the common fanfic sandbox metaphor, if I go to a party and sing \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" to mates, this is me \"playing in the Bacharach/David sandbox\". This is not a public performance, so it's fair enough. If I record my version and distribute it, however, Bacharach and David are quite entitled to stomp on me for copyright infringement. If I put different lyrics to the same tune, Bacharach can stomp on me. If I put a different tune to the same lyrics, David can stomp on me.\n\nSo say Scalzi and I collaborate with a third writer, X; Scalzi supplies the OMW background, I supply characters from VELLUM, and X writes the actual text of the story. Scalzi and I are to X as Bacharach and David are to Dusty. X can't do it without our permission; and we could equally well let Y or Z write their own story. Similarly, Dusty can't record \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" without the say-so of Bacharach and David; and Bacharach and David could equally well grant that say-so to Dione Warwick or Diana Ross.\n\nNow Dione or Diana might sing the song at a private party, but they'd be stomped on if they tried to put out a single without permission. Indeed, there are explicit performance licenses you have to get even if you just want to sing the song at a gig, regardless of whether that gig is paid or free. Similarly, X might write a story using this Scalzi/Duncan \"canon\" and read it to a few mates at a party. Theoretically, they could set up a live broadcast over the internet which was open to the public and, either charge the audience or not; the (il)legality of this might be considered arguable because fiction is not generally distributed to the public in this manner, so the question would arise as to whether this performance was/was-not an act of publication. The live, ephemeral, unrecorded nature of the story would, I'm sure, cause arguments, but I suspect that this would in fact be found to be an act of making-public, hence an act of publication, and hence a copyright infringment.\n\nAnd this is where fanfic becomes illegal: because it is published. With fanfic the story isn't just made public (i.e. published) as a live, ephemeral, unrecorded broadcast; it is laid down in a permanent, distributable form, recorded like a single. It doesn't matter if the single is distributed only as an MP3 free over the internet, with Dione or Diana making no profit. It doesn't matter if it's a labour of love which actually helps Bacharach's and David's careers in the long term. Neither of those are considered (legally) relevant. What matters is that Bacharach and David make their living from the publication of their work and -- either because we want to encourage them (US law) or because we recognise their ownership (UK law) -- they are entitled to withold or grant the right of publication to whomsoever they choose, and to seek recompense when that right is infringed. Indeed, they even get to choose whether or not to seek recompense on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe confusion comes in because of a few things:\n\n1) The conflation of background, character and textual rendition in single-authorship, means we fail to distinguish the separate ownership of these components of the story. It's like the hypothetical X writes under the name Scalcan Dunzi; and his textual rendition is so much in the foreground that we're unaware that, behind the scenes, it's actually Scalzi and Duncan who did a lot of the work; so we think as long as we're doing our own plot and style, we're not appropriating this Scalcan Dunzi guy's work but rather reimagining it with our own unique arrangement. In truth, we are creating our own unique arrangement, but we are still infringing the copyright of Scalzi and Duncan, just as we'd be with Bacharach and David if we ignored the importance of music/lyric writing and thought we were just doing a cover of a \"Dusty Springfield\" song. It's our own version, right? We're just playing in her sandbox. No, the sandbox doesn't even belong to her. She rents it from Bacharach and David who are in the sandbox production and rental business. Most writers are seen primarily as sandcastle-builders, but they have to build the box (music / background) and put the sand (lyrics / characters) in it first.\n\n2) Many fanfic writers seem to think that what they're doing is like singing \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" at a private party (a live reading amongst friends), when it is not even equivalent to a cover at a gig (a live webcast), but is in fact equivalent to slapping a downloadable MP3 of your own performance of \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" up on the internet (a published story). Presumably this is because the online media in which fanfics circulate are seen as communities of friends rather than public gatherings of strangers; they have all the character of a huge party, with gossip and banter, friendships and feuds. They are, nonetheless, venues/vectors of publication and distribution.\n\n3) There's a huge culture of covers in music and spin-offery in fiction, the licensing of which takes place so far in the background that those outside the industry may not even realise it's there. Try to get permission to use song lyrics in a novel and you'll see just how big and monstrous the bureaucracy is behind the scenes. Try to use them without permission and you may well be royally screwed. But we see bands doing covers on stage, releasing them as singles; we hear them on soundtracks on movies and TV. Likewise we have movie tie-ins, shared-worlds, merchandise and so on, so much that these copies (and even if it's just of a character's likeness in the form of a figurine, it's still a copy) permeate our culture to the extent that they seem \"ours\". The illegal stuff is everywhere -- bootlegs and pirate copies -- to a level impossible to police. The time-limitation makes it even more confusing: is this in copyright or out? Or how private is private? Does a wedding singer have to pay a fee for singing \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\"? I know that in the UK at least there's a whole registry thing so that club DJs can play tracks, pay a middle-man, and the artists get their fair share. The point is, in such a culture it's not surprising you end up with a sub-culture based on shared copies where those involved will argue that what they're doing is not actually illegal.\n\nUnfortunately, this is where morality kicks in and confuses it even further, because laws and mores aren't in a one-to-one relationship. Fanfic is, like it or not, illegal by my understanding of copyright. Just because it's you singing your own version of the Bacharach/David (music-&-lyrics) song, doesn't mean it's not an infringement of their copyrights. Just because it's you writing your own story in the Scalzi/Duncan (background-&-character) canon, doesn't mean it's not an infringement of our copyrights. However, the morality of such a work is a different issue.\n\nCurrently, fanfic does have a weak moral injuntion against it, I'd say, BUT... different cultures have different mores, and different sub-cultures can have different mores than the culture-at-large. Within the culture of fanfic that moral injunction has been scrapped. For various reasons, fanfic writers simply do not consider what they're doing to be immoral. In fact, it might well be argued that, even in the wider culture, creative input in terms of background and character is undervalued to the extent that most consider such copyright infringement basically trivial and harmless, arguable at least if not simply acceptable. Most people just shrug off J.K. Rowling fanfic as a weird hobby. This pretty much pivots, I suspect, on the non-profit nature of the work. Were Scalzi or I to write our own Harry Potter books, self-publish and sell them Print-on-Demand, we'd probably be judged as scurrilous rogues by the culture-at-large. I suspect fanfic writers would be even more morally outraged since a) they have more respect for writing in general, as devoted readers; and b) this is in direct contravention of the mores of the fanfic community, which validate copyright infringement on the twin foundations of attribution and non-profit.\n\nNow, personally, I don't care whether fanfic is moral or immoral because mores are fundamentally group-think. If the rest of the world decided that actually it was OK to sell Rowling fanfic as long as it was attributed (or vice-versa, to distribute it free but make no nod to the source), I'd still consider it unethical. As it stands, I largely think that attribution and non-profit are two factors which mitigate the ethical dubiety of fanfic (i.e. it demonstrates a certain ethics on the part of the fanfic writer, one which earns it a degree of respect and tolerance from me), but there are other factors which I consider equally important. Respect for the author's themes, their beliefs originality, the uniqueness of an interpretation, and the potential this has to expand understanding. I think it's the ethical responsibility of the writer to not create a travesty of the source.\n\nThe thing about ethics, though, is that (at least in my ethics) you've got to understand that they're personal. And what constitutes a travesty is equally personal. I'm not going to judge a fanfic writer ethically for not living up to a standard I set for myself, when all they want to do is entertain. But if the work read as right-wing propaganda, I might well issue a Cease & Desist, because I don't want my creations co-opted to that purpose. Rowling seems not to care about Harry/Draco slash in all its BDSM perversity (though I suspect that's rather at odds with her own thematic intent). Robin Hobb applies a harsher ethic, disregarding all fanfic as intrinsically unoriginal and therefore a bastardisation of her work.\n\nAt the end of the day, fanfic is illegal, whether it's moral or immoral is just a matter of which culture you belong to (and therefore irrelevant), and whether it's ethical or not is dependant on the original creator's ethics and the fanfic writer's attitude to those ethics. Basically, I built the sandbox, I put the sand in it, and if you want to play in it for free, you play by my rules. Don't break the box. Don't pee in the sand. Don't copy the sandcastle I built ten minutes ago and claim it was your idea. Don't copy that sandcastle but say it was my idea only to then top it off with a Nazi flag. Don't copy that sandcastle, change it slightly, and then moan at me because another kiddy copies yours slavishly and claims it was their idea; I'm not here to babysit.\n\nBe warned, that breaking any of those rules will result in your immediate expulsion from the sandbox. Until you break those rules, however, I honestly couldn't give a damn. Hell, I'd be curious to see what you come up with.\n\nAs for this nameless fanfic-writer-turned-pro? Now she has her own sandbox and, apparently, an angry mob of disgruntled doubters, you can bet her sandcastles will be inspected pretty rigorously to see if they bear a remarkable resemblance to those of other writers. If she's dumb, naive, duplicitous or just untalented, I imagine we'll find out soon enough.\n\nMitch Wagner | August 10, 2006 03:27 PM\n\nDean: \"It is not possible to plagiarize ideas. For example, Dan Brown's extensive borrowings of material for the Da Vinci Code are not plagiarism, nor is it copyright violation. Copyright extends to the specific execution of the idea.\"\n\nActually, that's not entirely true.\n\nThe storyline is incorporated into the copyright. It is, by law, a violation of copyright to rewrite Old Man's War, even if I change the title, every word of the novel, every character's name, all the place names and the names of all the technologies. If I steal the story, that's enough for a copyright violation.\n\nIn the case of at least one of the plagiarism cases against Brown, it was argued that Brown basically stole the storyline of an earlier published novel.\n\nI recently read an article on this in, I think, the New Yorker, about one of the accusations of plagiarism against Brown.\n\nThe law, however, does state that there are some plot considerations that are typical to a genre, and cannot be used as plagiarism. (There's a French word for this, which I forget--I don't think it's \"mise-en-scene\" but it might be.)\n\nThe article said that you might expect a crime novel to contain references to gang violence and money laundering, and the presence of both in two different works does not provide evidence that one is plagiarized from the other.\n\nWhen I read that, I said to myself: Also, in all cop TV shows and movies, the investigation requires the police officers to go to a strip club. But that's another discussion.\n\nKevin: \"I didn't know that about Forever War. But both books do deal with topics that Heinlein worked with, and I am still not sure the fact that the books came upon their subjects coincidentally and not as a direct response to Heinlein changes the larger point.\"\n\nHmmm... This is a tricky point to try to articulate, even though, having read both novels, it's easy to grok.\n\nThe Forever War has a few elements of its premise in common with ST, but, really, that's all it has. They're both novels about young men who enter basic, infantry training in the not-so-distant future, and go off to fight a space war against aliens with a hive mind. In both novels, being an infantryman is presented as a highly technical occupation. In both novels, the infantry wears powered armor that combines space suits with deadly personal weaponry and the ability to give the wearer super-strength.\n\nBut, other than those things, the novels are completely different. The main difference: The hero of ST finds battle to be a harsh environment, but an ennobling one. He thrives, succeeds, and becomes a man and officer, proud to serve in a noble war. The hero of TFW hates the war, he thinks it's stupid and that it wasted his life. Another major difference: The war ST is fought using faster-than-light travel, and soldiers can zip across the galaxy in days or weeks. OTOH, the soldiers of TFW feel relativistic effects, and the hero of that novel experiences centuries of change in society every time he goes home--to the point where society thinks he's an immoral pervert for being a heterosexual.\n\nUm, this would be a good time to disclose that the author of TFW, Joe Haldeman, and his wife, are friends of our family. So you may choose to dismiss what I'm saying as personal bias. But I think I'm making good arguments anyway.\n\nNow here's the point: Copyright violation doesn't exist in the vacuum. If the copyright owner doesn't say there's a violation, then no violation exists. If Heinlein had chosen to sue Haldeman, we might have something to wonder about--but Heinlein didn't sue, or even criticize; on the contrary, he praised TFW. So there's no copyright violation.\n\n(FWIW, Heinlein said that he and Haldeman agreed that the draft was morally wrong. That's another major difference between ST and TFW--in ST, the soldiers are volunteers, but in TFW, the soldiers are draftees. Heinlein disagreed with some of Haldeman's other points, but said that Haldeman--who went to Vietnam and got shot up pretty bad--had earned the right to speak out.)\n\nSean P. Fodera | August 10, 2006 09:02 PM\n\nI was, sadly, called away for business, and only just gotten back to this thread. I see it's moved on quite a way from the point where I left, so I'll keep my comments brief.\n\nMy main point (and perhaps not perfectly phrased) was that The Wind Done Gone, which many people use as if it were a case study of fanfic is not relevant. The book was not fanfic. It was a professionally produced parody. We never will really know it's true, precedent setting legal status. But, we don't need to because it was not fanfic. It is not a valid case to show that fanfic is legal.\n\nSomeone mentioned somewhere above about \"properly disclaimed\" fiction. If the original creator has not given you permission to write in their universe with their characters, putting a disclaimer does nothing to protect the fanfic writer. Fanfic writers rely on the concept that an author would be biting the hand that feeds it by taking fanfic writers to court. That's a nice loophole to count on, but sooner or later, some author will go all Harlan Ellison on a fanfic writer in court, and the fanfic writer will lose, clearly and decisively.\n\nSomeone asked for examples of authors who have had to cancel publications due to trouble with fanfic writers. Marion Zimmer Bradley not only had to cancel the first book in a new Darkover trilogy because some fan had written a fanfic on a similar plotline and sent the damned thing to her. She had to stop the Friends of Darkover anthologies because of similar problems. So, the readers lost a new chapter in MZB's Darkover universe, and lots of new short Darkover fiction because some fanfic writer couldn't play in their own yard. Misty Lackey ran into similar problems. I also recall another instance, though the name of the author does not pop to mind at the moment.\n\nAs to my friend Patrick's comments about my view on the waste of writing fanfic, much as I do admire him and his opinions in most areas regarding this industry (others here take note that you won't find a more well-informed student of the publishing industry than Patrick), I take them under advisement. I used to write fanfic (Trek, Dukes of Hazzard, Gone With the Wind (as it so happens). I had considered such excursions exercises in plot, pacing and character until I realized that the plots, pacing and character were not my own. Once I devoted myself exclusively to writing in my own universes (except for a foray into a Transformers media-tie-in), I realized that my style of writing did not match those other things I was spending my time on. My typing got better, but my writing... no. I consider that I may not be a perfect case-study, but other former fanfic writers who are now pros have said the same to me. I'm willing to consider that there are other benefits to writing fanfic as Patrick posits, but I'm not convinced. I expect others will point to Patrick's post as pure evidence that what they are doing is valuable.\n\nThe reason that fanfic is suddenly such a hot-button issue is that fanfic that used to be overlooked by authors when it was limited to small numbers of copies being passed among friends is now available to millions of people on the Internet. It is being published in quantity (in some cases on sites that derive income from advertising). It is no longer a hobby or a tribute. It's an infringement of the author's rights. Rationalize it any way you want, but those worlds and characters do not belong to the fans.\n\nAs for me, I am leaving for a vacation with no Internet connection. I'm unlikely to get back here before I leave, and you will all likely consider my absence a relief. When I'm back, I'll see where this all led.\n\nLater.\n\nMitch Wagner | August 11, 2006 03:01 PM\n\nAnne C., Sean Fodera - I know I said this before, but I find it ironic that this whole is-fanfic-useful-or-just-wanking is taking place on a blog. Which most professional writers and publishers consider to be wanking.\n\nDean: _the courts agree with me. Perdue has lost, and is now attempting to have the Supreme Court hear him. If they do hear him - and it is, I think, doubtful that they will: copyright law is clear in the US and there is ample precedent - it seems highly doubtful that they will have any reason to overturn the lower court decision._\n\nBased on the little knowlege I have of the subject, I agree with you that Perdue will have a tough time of it. He'll have a tough time even getting a hearing. But that has nothing to do with whether his case actually has merit.\n\nThe _Vanity Fair_ article describes Perdue's case as being very strong--but those are the _facts_ of the case. The Supreme Court does not rule on fact, they rule on law--not just law, but specifically Constitutional law. If the lower courts ruled that the facts went against Perdue, then--even if the lower court is wrong--Perdue is screwed. He's got no appeal left.\n\nUnless he can prove that the lower court made an error of Constitutional law, which I have not seen alleged.\n\n_Note that I didn't say that copyright violation requires plagiarism. But if there isn't outright blatant copying of large passages, then the similarities between the two stories have to be very strong indeed._\n\nWhich is what Perdue alleges, and the _Vanity Fair_ article makes a strong case that he's right.\n\n_I read the VF article, and while I thought it was sympathetic to Perdue (as I myself am, he seems like a nice guy) I didn't get the same sense from the story. I left it feeling that Mnookin had the same feeling about Perdue that I do: nice guy, but he's tilting at a windmill._\n\nI agree that the _Vanity Fair_ article presents Perdue as a nice guy who's tilting at a windmill, but maybe not for the reason you do.\n\nThe _Vanity Fair_ article makes a strong case that Perdue has the facts on his side, but he's outgunned by big corporate lawyers and doesn't have a chance of winning on that basis.\n\nkevin: **Mitch:** _I agree completely with your assessment of the differences between Heinlein and Haldeman, having read both. But TFW felt like a response to Heinlein as I was reading it. Perhaps that is my problem with groking this -- my personal experience with the two books._\n\nSorry if I was unclear: I agree with you 100%; _The Forever War_ is most definitely a response to _Starship Troopers._\n\nIt just does not--to use your earlier language \"borrow heavily from the ideas, tropes, and even the imagined technology of Heinleinâs work.\" Because borrwing requires authorial intent. We have no evidence that the author intended to borrow, and we have some evidence that it was entirely unintentional.\n\nJoe makes a strong argument: The similarities between TFW and ST are inevitable when an author sets out to write a science-fiction novel about an innocent civilian who goes off to a future war.\n\nAnd, indeed, Scalzi, who has not read TFW, nonetheless turned out a novel that's a response to TFW.\n\nIf someone else comes along tomorrow and writes a science fiction war novel without reading _any_ of the three books in question _(The Forever War, Starship Troopers,_ or _Old Man's War),_ it'll nonetheless come out looking like a response to those three books. If it's any good, at least.\n\nJust like if I write a story about a starship whose crew goes out exploring, it'll look like a response to, or ripoff of, _Trek._ Even if there are no other intentional similarities. Once you set out to create a story about a starship whose crew goes out exploring, you're more-or-less locked into a whole bunch of other creative decisions that makes the result like like _Trek_ or some kind of anti-_Trek._\n\nYou said, earlier: _I am not sure that dealing with similar themes in different worlds is a difference of kind in dealing with themes in the same world as a given author._\n\nAre we talking about morality here, or the law?\n\nIf you're arguing based on morality, then we have something to discuss.\n\nBut if you're arguing based on law, you are just plain wrong.\n\nI am legally free tomorrow to sit down and write, and commercially sell, a novel about a young English lad, living in an ordinary, present-day English suburb, who discovers that he's actually a wizard, and goes off to boarding school to sharpen his powers. That's perfectly legal.\n\nAnd that kind of thing happens every day--on TV. _CSI_ becomes a smash hit, and allofasudden there are about a million police procedurals on TV that have big, gross autopsy scenes as their centerpiece. (Barbarians that we are, we almost always have the TV on when watching TV, and we have learned to categorize our favorite TV shows as \"dinner-safe,\" and \"not dinner-safe.\")\n\nHowever, I'm _not_ legally allowed to write a _Harry Potter_ story, and try to sell it, without J.K. Rowling's permission. And if my hypethetical boy-wizard story has too many similarities to the Harry Potter novels, Rowling's lawyers are going to come after me, even if I've changed the names and some of the details to cover my tracks.\n\nDiana Sprinkle | August 16, 2006 07:31 AM\n\nlowfatcheezwhiz said... There had been rumors (and proof in the form of emails and personal run-ins) for many years in the fandom that the author in question, along with her galpal lawyer friend, cultivating a cult of personality around the author and directing their 'followers' to set upon anyone who dared to disagree or cast a negative light upon her, while she sat back and waved her hands going 'but but but I can't control what they do!'\n\nEvocative language. It sort of hurts your point though as now they sound like pack of evil necromancers controlling a hoard of fan zombies. I'm sure that's not how you meant it to sound so I'll just move right along.\n\nThe author still is not responsible for the actions of others. Just like the person who posted recently about her experience with said author isn't responsible for the people emailing the death threats or sending notes to all these authors.\n\nlowfatcheezwhiz said... If they were such good friends, at any time the author friend could have called off a majority of her dogs by saying 'guys, come on, let it go and don't worry about it'.\n\nUm, that's not how internet drama works at all. If one popular person speaks up and then steps down and their friends speak up and then are told to sit down, it doesn't stop the drama or the pain. Their fans and their friend's fans will stand up to defend as well and that makes everything particularly silly. Even if the author called off their friends and fans there's no way to stop all the haters and all the fans that surrounded that group.\n\nlowfatcheezwhiz said... In some cases that might be true. But this particular author carried a heavy weight in the fandom and wielded it quite expertly, all the while keeping her hands clean.\n\nYou think the current situation is \"keeping her hands clean?\" Cause um, I'm not getting that, I'm getting a large vocal band of people sure do have a hate-on for this one author and even if they don't hate they want to rant about the injustice of it all. No one seems to be going after anyone but the author. Considering this wank is from 2001 I don't think the author is getting off scott-free either.\n\nlowfatcheezwhiz said... It comes down to trust. The author was caught not just copying a few sprinkled phrases here and there, there was wholesale lifting of scenes tweaked enough to make it applicable to Harry Potter fanfic and not the original source.\n\nI'm not counting similar sequences of events changed enough to fit in Harry Potter cause while sad in some ways, it isn't actually plagiarism. I don't think you can lay claim to a sequence of events... that would limit freedom of expression a bit much. Maybe I'm wrong about that but those bits don't bother me in this fan work.\n\nEr, I don't have a problem with people being angry or upset about this thing, if that was the point of your post. I'm just not going to delude myself that I have any idea why people I don't know did what they did or said what they said. Cause er... I'm sitting in a tiny room in Texas, so I give everyone involved the benefit of the doubt cause from the recounting of events posted recently and all the emails. No one came out of it smelling like a bed of rose.\n\nThat's of course my far far away take on things way out here in the internet bleachers.\n\nI save your post for word use. You sure have a way of casting your words to invoke a certain outlook and feeling.\n\n-Diana"
