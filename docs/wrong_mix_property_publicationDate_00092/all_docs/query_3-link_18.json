        "text": "BOOK REVIEW: Forever Peace\n\nTITLE: Forever Peace\n\nAUTHOR: Joe Haldeman\n\nPUBLISHER: Ace Books\n\nDATE: 1997\n\nThe author Joe Haldeman is undoubtedly best-known for his 1976 novel The Forever War, a hugely-influential, Hugo Award-winning book grappling with the author’s experiences in the Vietnam War. I didn’t actually like it that much. I don’t know why! Maybe I was just too young, maybe I’m just the wrong generation to appreciate it. I should probably give it another shot at some point. But the Haldeman book that really made an impression on me was Forever Peace, a “spiritual sequel” that he wrote twenty years later that seemed to be accurately and presciently capture the zeitgeist of the coming new millennium. Forever Peace isn’t a great novel, in a lot of ways. It’s kind of a mess, with way too much going on. But it’s a fascinating exploration of war and peace and America from someone who spent his whole life studying that, and I think it deserves to be better known.\n\n(BTW: SPOILERS FOR EVERYTHING)\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nIt’s 2043, and America–and most of the First World–has reached a level of post-scarcity subsistence, fueled by the development of fusion power and “nanoforges” that can manufacture almost anything imaginable. But everything has a cost. The resources to fuel this economic miracle are wrenched from the Global South, and for years now, America and its allies have been locked in an endless, grinding counterinsurgency across Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asians. For most Americans, the “Ngumi War” is an abstraction, fought primarily by drones, and broadcast nightly as entertainment. For Julian Class, it’s an unending nightmare. But what can an ordinary man do about it? Nothing, so he thinks, until a series of discoveries forces him to reevaluate everything he thought he knew about the world, and tests just how much he’d be willing to pay for peace.\n\nWHAT I LIKED:\n\nI called Forever Peace a “messy” book, and it really does feel overstuffed and underdeveloped at times. It packs a lot of ideas into a relatively-slim 350 pages. But that’s what I like about it. Forever Peace manages to run through an amazing list of high concepts, almost any one of which could have formed the basis for its own story. It’s a book that never lets you stop thinking, introducing in short order:\n\nPost-Scarcity Dystopia: One of the major themes in Forever Peace is that programmable nanotechnology has allowed the First World to construct virtually anything to order from raw materials, at very low cost. This is good! It means that the United States now has a Universal Basic Income and free healthcare. It has also rendered pretty much the entire population unemployed and broken the economy. Nobody really has to work (pretty much all the characters are academics, one of the few remaining avenues of employment), but everything is provided via ration cards and government support, a sort of grimly utilitarian social democracy, with the government in sole control of the means of production. And, of course, nanoforges still need inputs of resources to work.\n\nThe Drone War, the Forever War: That leads to the main driver of the plot, the Ngumi War. The Ngumi are a loose coalition of rebel groups, driven by resentment of the First World, the Alliance. It’s an economic war (“the ‘haves’, with their automation-driven economies, versus the ‘have-nots’, who were not born into automatic prosperity“), a race war (“the blacks and browns and some yellows versus the whites and some other yellows“) and an ideological war (“The defenders of democracy versus the rebel strong-arm charismatic leaders. Or the capitalist land-grabbers versus the protectors of the people, take your pick.“) (Forever Peace, pg. 36.) In some places it’s a counterinsurgency campaign, in others a police action against organized crime, in others a conventional war or a full-blown genocide. It just keeps going. Nobody seems to like it, but nobody knows how to get out of it, and the costs for the First World are low, given that virtually all of the fighting is done through remote-control ‘soldierboys’, piloted from afar.\n\nWar as Entertainment: For most Americans, the Ngumi War intrudes mostly as entertainment. Broadcast nightly on TV, civilians can choose platoons or operations to follow along with and root for, like a football game where only one side dies. Usually. (“‘Got to say I don’t recognize you. I follow the Fourth and the Sixteenth, mainly.’ ‘I’m Ninth. Not nearly as exciting.’ ‘Interdiction’ he said, nodding. The Fourth and Sixteenth are hunter/killer platoons, so they have a considerable following. Warboys, we call their fans.” Forever Peace, pg. 31). I suspect this is in reaction to media coverage of the 1990-1991 Gulf War, especially Jean Baudrillard’s famous essay collection The Gulf War Did Not Take Place, but it feels very predicative of how contemporary conflicts like Ukraine and Gaza have been understood and interpreted via social media.\n\nTechnological Telepathy: The ‘soldierboys’ and ‘flyboys’ of the Alliance military are controlled via “jacking”, a form of direct neutral-linkage where pilots can control their drones as a direct extension of their own bodies. Not only are you linked directly to your machine, but everyone in each platoon is linked together as well, forming a temporary gestalt hive-mind. The military advantages are obvious, but the downside is that the psychological effects of combat are even worse. American soldiers might not get killed in combat too often anymore, but the mental strain is unbearable, and mostly invisible. Also people use it for porn. Like, a lot.\n\nNew Big Bang: Ok, so, most of the plot is about the subtle psychological horrors of war, but there’s a subplot about the ‘Jupiter Project’, which is using automated nanotechnology to construct a super-massive particle accelerator ring in orbit of Jupiter to try and study the origin of the Universe. Except, it turns out that turning it on will actually trigger a new Big Bang, destroying the Universe, and creating a new one. It is suggested that this may actually have happened before, and that this explains the Fermi Paradox–any sufficiently advanced civilization destroys the Universe.\n\nMillenarian Christian Death Cult: This is an even bigger problem than you might think, because a secret apocalyptic Christian cult called ‘The Hammer of God’ has hijacked control of the upper elements of the federal government, and has latched onto the ‘Jupiter Project’ as a way to bring about the End of Days and the Second Coming of Christ.\n\nThe Last War: All of this, however, is a kind of distraction from the actual climax of the book, which is about Julian getting pulled into a conspiracy of his own. Government regulations have always carefully restricted the amount of time people can spend ‘jacked’ with one another, ostensibly for reasons of safety. As it turns out, this is a charade. Secret experiments have proven that if people spend more than two weeks linked together, they emerge incapable of committing violence against any other person. Julian and his compatriots end up launching a program to secretly inoculate both sides of the war with the vaccine against violence, bringing an end to the Ngumi War and–hopefully–war of any kind at all.\n\nWhat I find most fascinating about Forever Peace is how prescient it feels. Despite being published in 1997, it feels like it really captures the zeitgeist of the 21st century and the post-9/11 era, down to the Ngumi War being triggered by an act of terrorism against a major American city. It’s not so much that it predicted the future exactly, as it feels like it’s about the same fears and concerns and obsessions of the current era. Automation and technology increasing prosperity while devouring the social compact, endless low-intensity warfare, waged in the name of vague ideological platitudes with drones and special forces, the media commercializing and selling foreign atrocities as entertainment, evangelical Christian fundamentalists using the government to enact their religious agenda–it’s all here, and it’s a little disturbing to see how early people were talking about it.\n\nThis is a bleakly cynical book, one in which the protagonist depressed, suicidal, and very upfront about not believing the “facile propaganda” of either side of the war he’s fighting. It’s a book in which Julian pretty strongly suspects that the US government may have blown up Atlanta with a nuclear bomb in a false-flag operation, and this doesn’t really affect anything, because his views are already so grimly radicalized. But, it’s also a book that ends with POWs and American soldiers joining forces in a pacifistic army of “Los Liberados” and bringing an end to all war in the world, hopefully forever. That tonal whiplash, between the cynical contempt, and the utopian imaginings, is weird. But I like it a lot. It makes Forever Peace feel like nothing else quite out there.\n\nIt’s usually a mistake to try and extrapolate a book’s themes from the author’s biography, but given how explicitly it shaped his career, it seems safe to say that Joe Haldeman’s service in the Vietnam War was a major influence on this book. As he wrote once, “In my work, it always comes back to the jungle.” Forever Peace is a story about war. Not the ideological or political details, or the grand strategy–these are glossed over, because they fundamentally don’t matter to Julian. It’s about “what it’s really like. To be locked inside a cage and watch yourself murder people by remote control.” Forever Peace, pg. 31). Haldeman’s 1968-1969 tour of duty long predated the Drone Wars, but I can’t help but wonder if his service as a combat engineer didn’t affect his thoughts on the paradox of “clean” warfare and killing by proxy. Haldeman’s deep knowledge of and bitter hatred of war, for fighting, of killing, comes through clearly, and it helps elevate what could feel like a preachy or didactic message into something pure and profound.\n\nAt the end of Forever Peace, events are set in motion that will hopefully allow a new, better world to be born. But our hero will not be there to see it. Like Moses at the border of the Promised Land, Julian is unable to fully enter the New Era. The procedure that rids humans of the impulse of violence has a failure rate–not a high one, but neural linking is inherently dangerous. Some people will simply be unable to join it. And Julian turns out to be one of those people. At the book’s conclusion, humanity begins to split into two subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens and Homo sapiens pacificans. The “normals” split off and settle some of the world’s islands, with the expectation that eventual inbreeding will ensure that triumph of pacificans. “A lot that happened over the next two years was difficult for we merely normal people to understand. In a way, the conflict ultimately would be almost Darwinian, one ecological niche contested by two different species.” Forever Peace, pg. 349). The irony is, of course, obvious. Julian and his ability to kill are are essential to the survival of the Revolution. And that is why he will never fully be able to understand the world he’s helped create. Violence, or war, in this case, serves as a sort of necessary moral poison, that can never fully be purged.\n\nJulian is African-American, and throughout the book is in a relationship with a white woman, which is treated as at least semi-scandalous. They both take care to keep it discreet, and to avoid letting people know about it unless necessary. This feels anachronistic for a book set in 2043, but it’s worth remembering that the approval rate of interracial marriage in the US didn’t go over 50% until the mid-1990s. It’s an interesting reminder of the limits of imagination, and how things can change both faster and slower than we can believe.\n\nThe dedication of Forever Peace goes so much harder than it has any need to. Gotta love a true hater.\n\nWHAT I DIDN’T LIKE:\n\nThis isn’t, like, a theme or anything, but an image that the book returns to more than once is that the Federal Health Service grants you the right to one (1) free sex change, and that every military base has a few transgender prostitutes hanging out trying to earn enough money to change back to being a man. I suspect this seemed very clever, but I don’t think it’s aged particularly well.\n\nThe thing I like most about Forever Peace is how chock-full of ideas and high concepts it is. This is also the book’s biggest problem. The story jumps from Big Idea to Big Idea, sliding from a gritty war novel about fighting and dying in the cloud forests of Costa Rica to a scientific thriller about accidentally destroying the Universe to a dark and complicated romance to a utopian quest to end war. It’s a lot, and it often feels like an incoherent mess. I like this book a lot, but I think it works better as a smorgasbord of ideas than as a single story.\n\nWILL YOU LIKE IT:\n\nI think this is a must-read book for anyone who thinks of themselves as a fan of science fiction in general, or Joe Haldeman’s work in particular. I can’t exactly call it a “hidden gem”, given that it won a Hugo Award and a Nebula, but I think it deserves wider recognition. It uses the language and imagery of military science fiction brilliantly, while subverting it to critique the entire genre. It’s also a fascinating chronological bridge; essentially a Vietnam novel written about the Global War on Terrorism. I’d recommend it to anyone interested in either of those topics, and how we use fiction to process and discuss current events. It’s a sad, angry, hopeful book written by someone who knows the horrors of war all too well, and can still envision the idea of something better. It’s a fascinating artifact, and I can’t recommend it strongly enough.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
