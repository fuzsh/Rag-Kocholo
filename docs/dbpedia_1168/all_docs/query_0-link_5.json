        "text": "March 4th, 2014\n\nDear Steven, Michael, Pam, and Amy,\n\nI’ve always considered your mom a special friend to me, and not just because she was a friend of my own mother. Rhoda lovingly called me “Susabelle.” I don’t know where it came from but it makes me smile to think of it. It’s typical of Rhoda to express herself a little differently, with more affection, more attention than other people. She was one of a kind.\n\nMy favorite memory is when my son Craig was born. I was hours into a difficult labor, and David was nervous and restless. He spent a lot of time in the waiting room with a few select friends and family. Who was there? Rhoda (with You, Michael) cheering us on and seeing us through a safe and healthy delivery. That’s the kind of supportive friend she was.\n\nRhoda watched me grow up from a teen-ager hanging out at the condo in Florida to become a mother, and then grandmother. I watched Rhoda too. I watched her be a good and loving wife to Your Dad. I loved Tommy and I loved seeing them together. Both of your parents were close to my kids. And your mother even got to know my grand kids, and they got to know her. A four generational friendship – that’s special.\n\nGoing to Randhurst, and seeing your mother at work was an inspiration. I’ll always admire her business acumen and work ethic. Not too many women of that generation worked, but your mom was a delightful exception.\n\nMore typical was the card games where Your mother patiently listened to my mother’s endless bragging. She did her share of bragging too (as is the custom) about all of you and your families. She was very proud of you.\n\nI saw Rhoda a few days before her fall at my Mom’s 85th birthday card party. Twenty-five sharp, well-dressed women hanging out and having a good time. That’s how I remember her. Looking good and doing what she loved to do.\n\nMay you all be blessed to remember your mother with love and admiration. I pray that the pain of your loss softens with time. Be grateful. Be joyful. Be happy that you had your mother for so many wonderful years.\n\nLove, Susie Diamond"
