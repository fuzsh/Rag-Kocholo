        "text": "\"I'm bored.\"\n\n\"Go read a book.\"\n\n\"Reading is boring, and there's nothing to read anyway.\"\n\nIt's the inevitable exchange that comes up every summer as the heat drives kids and teens inside and the appeal of TV and video games starts to wane.\n\nThis doesn't have to be the conversation in your house, however. There are hundreds of thousands of books out there, with plenty of variety sure to keep even the most reluctant readers interested.\n\nNot sure where to start?\n\nMost libraries, bookstores, schools, newspapers (see accompanying material) and even online retailers offer lists of suggested materials for all ages and reading abilities.\n\nThough reading guidelines vary from publisher to publisher, a general guideline for age categories is the following: picture books, ages 0–8; early reader, ages 5-7; middle reader, ages 7-12; and young adult, 13 and older.\n\nKeep in mind each reader is at his or her own level. And while reading comprehension is important, so is fostering a love of reading.\n\nSuggestions are great, but no two people are the same. Just because you loved \"Wuthering Heights\" as a youth doesn't mean your teenager will love it, too.\n\nOne of the best ways to find a new read is to browse. Allowing readers to take their time perusing books makes it a personal experience.\n\nSampling the first 20-30 pages of a book can sometimes save hours of frustration.\n\nRemember, not completing a book isn't a tragedy, but forcing a young reader to finish something they hate in the name of \"fun\" could be.\n\nAgain, making them active participants will lead to a greater chance for success.\n\nEven if your local library is small, chances are you can get books that aren't at that location. The Salt Lake City, Salt Lake County and Davis County library systems offer inter-library loans between branches. Requests can be made online from any location or at the branch itself.\n\nIf you want to skip the library and go straight to ownership, most bookstores will order books not in stock, and usually they'll pay for shipping, too.\n\nBelow are some fantastic new releases that just might get youths in your household excited about reading.\n\n\"THREE LADIES BESIDE THE SEA,\" by Rhoda Levine and Edward Gorey, NYR Children's Collection, $14.95 (ages 4-8)\n\nThree ladies live beside the sea — Laughing Edith of Ecstasy, Smiling Catherine of Compromise and Alice of Hazard, who lives a dangerous life.\n\nThe three women spend much of their time together, but Catherine and Edith can't figure out why Alice is always up in a tree.\n\nFirst published in 1960, this lovely picture book has now been reissued. It's a tale of love found, then lost and the never-ending search to regain it.\n\nRhoda Levine's lilting rhymes add warmth to a beautiful yet simple tale. And artist Edward Gorey's Edwardian maidens are the perfect fit.\n\n\"THE SHADOWS (The Books of Elsewhere, Vol. 1),\" by Jacqueline West, Dial, $16.99 (ages 9-12)\n\nEleven-year-old Olive has always lived in apartments, so when she and her parents move into a crumbling Victorian mansion on Linden Street, it takes some getting used to the change of scenery.\n\nThere's something weird about this house, something she can't quite put her foot on. Creepy antique paintings hang on all the walls, and people seem to avoid the house.\n\nBut Olive is a curious girl, and creepiness doesn't keep her from exploring. It's when Olive finds a pair of old-fashioned glasses that things get decidedly strange.\n\nWith those glasses, she can travel inside the paintings to Elsewhere, a world that's eerily sinister.\n\nElsewhere has secrets to hide, and before she knows it, Olive is caught in a plan darker and more dangerous than she could have imagined.\n\nThis is a tale with twists and turns galore. Young readers will identify with Olive's sense of adventure as she must face her own fears and learn when to ask for help and when to rely on herself. Fun full-page illustrations are sprinkled throughout, adding to the story's ambience.\n\n\"THE GRIMM LEGACY,\" by Polly Shulman, Putnam Juvenile, $16.99 (ages 10 and up)\n\nElizabeth has always loved fairy tales, especially the ones written by the Brothers Grimm. She even writes about them for a school project, which to her great surprise, turns into a new job, one unlike any other.\n\nElizabeth's after-school job is at the New York Circulating Material Repository — a lending library of objects (clothes, tools, textiles, etc.), not books.\n\nAnd if that's not weird enough, there's a secret room in the basement that holds the Grimm Collection. You see, the Grimm fairy tales are based on real events, and there are some very powerful items — seven-league boots, a table that produces a feast at the blink of an eye and Snow White's stepmother's sinister mirror that talks in riddles, among them — residing in the repository.\n\nBut something's amiss at the repository. Magical items are disappearing and others are losing their magic. When it appears her friend could be involved in the disappearances, Elizabeth embarks on a dangerous quest to catch the thief before it's too late.\n\nMillions have grown up with Grimm fairy tales and have wished themselves inside the stories. Here, they get the chance. Polly Shulman's juxtaposition of a contemporary fantasy with timeless tales is great fun. This is an exciting page-turner readers will hate to put down."
