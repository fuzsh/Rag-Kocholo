        "text": "According to \"The Guinness Book of Records,\" Vincent La Selva, a native of Cleveland, is the only man ever to have conducted all twenty-eight operas of Giuseppe Verdi in chronological order. La Selva runs a company called the New York Grand Opera, which recently succeeded in presenting the entire Verdi canon, in Central Park, free of charge. The cycle began in 1994, with a boisterous rendition of \"Oberto,\" and ended this summer, with \"Aida,\" \"Otello,\" and \"Falstaff.\" I saw the \"Otello\" on a sticky night in July. Several thousand people were on hand, and several hundred others were trying to get in. A policeman was shouting, \"No more seats! No opera!\" There was a lot of pushing and pleading, as at a rock show. \"My name has to be on the list,\" said a youngish man in an Atari shirt. Many people ended up camping out on the grass, listening to the music as it wafted over the loudspeakers. Verdi seems to have lost little of the mass appeal that brought forth hundreds of thousands of mourners on the day of his funeral, a century ago.\n\nIn this anniversary year, something like four hundred productions of Verdi's operas have been mounted around the world. I have seen nine of them, in the major New York houses and at two great theatres in Italy, and, to my surprise, the Central Park \"Otello\" is the one that sticks in my mind. It was by no means the best-sung Verdi of the season; for an \"Otello\" of grand, tragic dimensions, you would have to hunt down a ticket to see Plácido Domingo at the Met's opening-night gala, scheduled for next week. Nor were the acoustics satisfactory. The singers had microphones clipped to their costumes, and every few minutes one of them would let out a mechanical squawk or disappear from the mix. During the Homage Chorus, in Act II, the mandolin was deafening and the chorus was inaudible. But the production had an excellent, pearly-voiced Desdemona in Judith Von Houser, and a fiercely idiomatic conductor in La Selva. This was Verdi 101, stripped of directorial brainstorms and interpretive ego trips. By the end, I had forgotten about the tackiness of the scenery and fallen under Verdi's spell.\n\nThe appeal of Italian opera is difficult to put into words, but it has something to do with the activation of primal feelings. Operatic characters have a way of laying themselves bare, and they are never more uninhibited than at the climax of a Verdi tragedy. \"Otello,\" the peak of the canon, is a crescendo of anger; yet the ultimate moment of the opera, during which Central Park seemed to fall silent, is a surpassingly lyrical one. When Otello kills Desdemona, the act is framed by two repetitions of a bewitching nine-bar theme, which first appeared in the love duet of Act I. It is a beautiful object, but it is a token of Otello's insanity. His love for Desdemona was, he says, a \"mirage\"—not because she betrayed him but because he never saw her as a real person. His note-for-note recapitulation of the love music marks the point at which he chooses the mirage over life itself. All the orchestra can offer, by way of a final statement, is three soft, black chords. \"Fall down the steps,\" Verdi writes. Edward Perretti, the tenor singing Otello, followed the instruction exactly. Everyone shuddered.\n\nThe Central Park \"Otello\" was an unexpectedly haunting experience, because it took the drama at face value. It made no attempt to deconstruct or recontextualize, and in that respect it was rare among contemporary productions. The Verdi year has supplied two major bits of information: first, that the audience for opera in America is steadily growing, and, second, that many of the directors who now dominate the opera scene do not know what they are doing. If, as Isaiah Berlin wrote, Verdi was the last great popular artist, the last who perfectly fit his time, then he is a spectacular misfit in the contemporary highbrow ghetto, where intellectuals make a virtue of being ironically detached. Chances are, any Verdi opera you saw this year took the form of a revisionist production that was at odds with the composer's raging sincerity. One prominent director has been quoted as saying, \"Nobody comes to Verdi for the plots.\" More likely, people come to Verdi because he meant every word.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, German musicians began to describe their art in idealistic terms, as a lofty pursuit that disdained the crowd. Giuseppe Verdi, despite his reclusive habits and porcupine personality, saw no shame in the pursuit of public adoration. \"The box office is the proper thermometer of success,\" he remarked. In this respect, you can compare him to a major Hollywood artist like Hitchcock, who kept an eye on the bottom line even as he immersed himself in formal schemes. Like Hitchcock, Verdi was a gripping storyteller, a master mechanic of the wheels of fate. But the Italian's empathy went deeper. The example for him was Shakespeare, and even if he had never set Shakespeare to music the comparison would have been made. Verdi's works, like Shakespeare's, thrilled both the groundlings and the connoisseurs.\n\nFor a glimpse of Verdi's two-faced genius, you need look no further than his most famous tune, \"La donna è mobile,\" which has sold vast quantities of pasta in television commercials. More than a pretty melody, it is packed with double meanings, some of them quite ugly. The irony of the aria is hinted at in the opening bars, as the players stop and start again, like actors clearing their throats. The first line translates as \"Women are fickle,\" but the sentiment is less than straightforward, being the rationalization of a fickle Duke who uses women for amusement. Gilda, who has fallen for the Duke, overhears the song, grasps its tone, and is plunged into despair. Rigoletto, her father, plots revenge, forgetting for a while that he himself facilitated the Duke's adventures and was cursed by one of his victims. At the end of the night, an assassin hauls out a sack that is supposed to contain the Duke's corpse. Just as Rigoletto bends over it, a familiar tenor is heard singing a familiar tune offstage—\"La donna è mobile.\" So whose is the body in the bag? Maledizione! That chirpy tune becomes the cutting edge of the curse that brings Rigoletto down.\n\nIn his old age, Verdi styled himself a man of the people, a self-taught peasant genius. Recent biographers have pointed out the many ways in which this image departed from the facts. His father, a small-time innkeeper and landowner, was, if not rich, prosperous enough to be able to give his son a thorough musical education, and the young man had the help of many aristocratic friends. Still, there is some truth to the peasant image. Verdi had an earthy nature, a preference for action over theory. He was born in 1813, in a village outside the town of Busseto, south of Milan. At first, he seemed destined to succeed his teacher as the musical director of Busseto, but his personality proved too unruly for the role. Instead, thanks in part to the intervention of a sympathetic soprano named Giuseppina Strepponi, he attracted the interest of La Scala, which presented \"Oberto\" in 1839. The breakthrough year was 1842, when \"Nabucco,\" his third opera, had a run of fifty-seven performances at La Scala—more than any opera before or since.\n\nEven as Verdi became a national hero, furnishing anthems for the risorgimento, he made his plots more intimate, favoring situations in which characters pursued passions that were against the social grain. In the space of three years, he produced \"Rigoletto,\" \"Il Trovatore,\" and \"La Traviata,\" without which no modern opera house could function. In the eighteen-fifties and sixties, under the influence of French grand opera, he produced a series of sprawling tableaux—\"I Vespri Siciliani,\" \"Simon Boccanegra,\" \"Un Ballo in Maschera,\" \"La Forza del Destino,\" \"Don Carlos,\" and, in 1871, \"Aida\"—in which a deepening pessimism became evident. Fate was now hammered out by earthly monsters of authority, the worst of them being the Grand Inquisitor in \"Don Carlos.\" Finally, after a period of seeming retirement, Verdi produced \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff,\" in which the bel-canto tradition was recast in dizzyingly heightened form.\n\nVerdi was not yet dead when he began to be dismissed as a dated figure. The younger Italian intellectuals flocked to Wagner, who had set about obliterating the operatic conventions that Verdi cherished to the end. While his works never lost their popularity, they were often treated as genre pieces that history had left behind. The Wagner comparison consistently hurt him. Wagner wrote in a self-consciously idiosyncratic style, and in any given moment you could hear his open-ended processes at work. Verdi's was an art of juxtaposition, of jagged contrasts: innocent tunes punctured by repeated, discordant notes; robust marches pushed into the background by desolate monologues. To the analytical mind, such music can look crude, even vulgar, on the page. Only in live performances, when the momentum begins to build and the voices become urgent, does it catch fire. But how do you go about analyzing momentum and urgency? Verdi is a challenge for academic sensibilities.\n\nIn the postwar period, a phalanx of singers and conductors brought about a major Verdi revival, with the art of Maria Callas setting the standard. The early operas came back into circulation; the more austere dramas, such as \"Stiffelio\" and \"Simon Boccanegra,\" were taken out of mothballs; \"Don Carlos\" was finally heard complete. Scholars began to take Verdi seriously; and Mary Jane Phillips-Matz's doggedly researched biography, published in 1993, revealed the man in all his gnarled complexity. It was during this same period, however, that directors began the practice of rewriting Verdi's librettos from scratch, and the revival entered a state of crisis from which it has yet to emerge.\n\nEarlier this year, Matthew Gurewitsch, writing in the Times, asked several leading American opera directors to articulate their visions of Verdi, and he got some eyebrow-raising replies. Francesca Zambello, who once set \"Aida\" in a nuclear-winter landscape, said, \"If I have to think of a work of Verdi that moved me on stage, that's going to be pretty hard.\" Christopher Alden, who created a \"Rigoletto\" with bouts of transvestism and public sex, said, \"You have to throw cold water on an audience. You have to wake them up, poke holes into the operas so that the inner life will flow out.\" Mark Lamos, whose \"Rigoletto\" also featured a graphic orgy scene, said, \"To be blunt, I find Verdi's operas about as stageworthy as his Requiem.\"\n\nThe assumption behind this kind of sloganeering is that Verdi's librettos are stodgy and ridiculous. With their wild coincidences, improbable deaths, and hyperventilating exits, they do seem silly at first glance. Even the most artful synopsis reduces a plot-heavy work like \"Simon Boccanegra\" to gibberish. And surtitles are of only limited value: while they help to draw the audience in, they also place far too much stress on the words, which are raw material for singing rather than freestanding literary texts. (It would be similarly unnerving if song lyrics were projected at a rock show, useful as the service might be.) Only when the performance is under way does the beauty of the libretto snap into focus. Verdi's beloved maledictions, vendettas, and forces of destiny actually add plausibility rather than take it away; they make the violent accents of operatic singing seem like a natural reaction under the circumstances.\n\nIf directors were replacing nineteenth-century conventions with riveting scenarios of their own, then their attacks on Verdi's stageworthiness, however arrogant, could be set aside as so much bluster. The fact is that most of them display the faults they assign to Verdi: their work is, more often than not, stilted and cryptic, as if obeying some extraterrestrial social code. The Met's production of \"Il Trovatore\" last season, for example, was so monumentally opaque that the director, Graham Vick, later removed his name from it, in the spirit of the \"Allen Smithee\" movies that are periodically flushed out of Hollywood. Here are some notes I made at the time: \"Toy soldiers, colorful costumes, but no sets to speak of. Rorschach patterns? Sliding walls—inept. Enough!\" Vick's fiasco was mild in comparison with what has been appearing lately on European stages. The opera world was recently buzzing over a \"Ballo in Maschera,\" in Barcelona, that opened with an added scene of conspirators sitting on toilets and went on from there.\n\nProductions of this kind invite outrage, and the best response is to ignore them. More interesting are the productions that go subtly, incrementally wrong. One such was a \"Rigoletto\" at City Opera, under the direction of Rhoda Levine. A lot of it worked—at least, early on. John Conklin's sets, for example, nicely displayed the opera's contrasting social worlds, with the Duke of Mantua's palace dominated by a gaudy red, and Rigoletto trapped in gray brick middle-income housing. We seemed to be in a stylized space between the Renaissance and the present day. There was an effective visual elaboration of Gilda's central aria, \"Caro nome,\" with sinister figures hovering in the background. \"Caro nome,\" like \"La donna è mobile,\" is more complicated than it appears; for all its sweetness, it has an eerie unreality, and the soprano's coloratura can come off as so much whistling in the dark. At the end, tremolo strings glisten like the threads of a spiderweb in which Gilda is about to be trapped.\n\nBut the production got fidgety as it went along, and at the climax it lost the plot entirely. As Rigoletto despairs, we see the assassin, Sparafucile, kicking back in his apartment, having a beer. Then the Duke himself wanders in and joins him. None of this is in the libretto, for good reason. We don't need to be told what Sparafucile and the Duke are doing next: they are stereotypes, albeit richly detailed ones, and they will go on playing lethal games with other people's lives. The bigger problem is that Levine's pantomimes detract from the dénouement of the story. Rigoletto is the one character who is permitted to look into himself, and in the final scene the governing irony of his life is revealed to him: his public role, that of cruel jester, has ruined his private one, that of protective father. This is Sophoclean irony, and it is a comedown to see it paired with the kind of sardonic twist that passes for irony on cable TV—an assassin relaxing after his kill.\n\nDirectors like to claim that the conventions of Italian opera are hackneyed and that contemporary audiences need novel reinterpretations if they are not to grow bored. Operagoers are pictured as jaded fanatics who cannot stand to see another mad scene or midnight oath. There are, of course, such people, and they get a proper thrill when Macbeth comes on in Sex Pistols regalia. But many others, especially those coming to opera for the first time, like the old stuff. They want to see frenzied states of mind, bizarre occurrences, a mother accidentally throwing her baby on the fire. The directors themselves are the bored ones. They need to make a statement and, afraid of embracing anything positive, set about attacking an imaginary establishment. Verdi, the melancholy patriot, sends them into conniptions of negation. All they can do with his patriotism is to mock it; all they can do with his despair is to trivialize it.\n\nDirector-dominated opera is known as Regietheater, and it is telling that the word exists only in German. Regietheater first became popular as a way of evading unsavory political associations created by the work of Richard Wagner, and, once again, the invidious comparison comes into play. Wagner's hypnotic world-weariness can serve as a soundtrack for almost any set of images: Nordic gods, Nuremberg rallies, \"Apocalypse Now.\" Verdi, on the other hand, is the most site-specific of composers. His arching phrases imply a certain mode of address; his rhythms a particular way of stalking to and fro; his orchestration a certain kind of space. For his shattering ironies to come through, you need to start with a veneer of ordinariness. In \"Un Ballo in Maschera,\" the entire action is predicted in the opening bars, in which carefree music in a major key is shadowed by chromatic passing tones. A lot of productions are masked balls from the outset, so you never know when anyone is putting on a disguise.\n\nFor too long, opera directors have got away with installing themselves in the progressive zone of musical life, dismissing all resistance to their work as anti-intellectual conservatism. In truth, they are the dumb, lumbering establishment, the ones with the tired script. The time has come for opera people to just say, \"Basta.\" And the most effective protest will come not from critics and audiences, whose grumbling can always be explained away, but from singers, without whom nothing can happen.\n\nA Verdi aria is like a camera that zooms in on a person's soul. Take the moment in \"La Traviata\" when Violetta, the fallen woman, leaves her lover, Alfredo, under pressure from his father. Alfredo believes that she is merely going into the garden, but he will soon receive a letter saying that she has left forever. \"I will always be here, near you, among the flowers,\" Violetta says to him. \"Love me, Alfredo, as I love you. Goodbye.\" When a great soprano unfurls these phrases—I am listening to Maria Callas, recorded at La Scala, in 1955—you hear so much you can hardly take it all in. You hear what Alfredo hears, the exaggerations of an overwrought lover: \"I love you even though I am going into the garden.\" You hear what Violetta cannot bring herself to say out loud: \"I am leaving you, but will always love you.\" And you hear premonitions of her deathbed plea, at the end of the opera: \"Remember me after death.\" This world of meaning is carried along by a simple tune that you know even if you have never seen an opera.\n\nEach Verdi score contains a series of pivot points that singers are expected to make into purely vocal epiphanies. They sometimes amount to no more than four or five notes, in a steeply curving pattern. Verdi hounded his librettists to find the right words for these climaxes; he demanded banner headlines of emotion. \"Amami, Alfredo\" is among the most indestructible of them, appealing as it does to the diva's imperial urges. But Callas's treatment of the line is so unnervingly vehement that it risks anticlimax—where can the opera possibly go from here? Only when you listen again do you understand: Violetta's spirit is broken, and from now on she will sing as if she were already dead. Rather than indulging in personal excess, Callas is setting forth, in the manner of a German-trained director, her concept of the opera. Only, she is doing it musically, with her voice.\n\nThis is what Verdi expected from singers: emotions so strong that they become ideas. To study archival recordings is to realize how deliberately the old singers marshalled their resources toward the few notes that truly mattered. The EMI label recently reissued a classic compilation entitled \"Les Introuvables du Chant Verdien,\" which is almost guaranteed to transform even the huskiest young fan into a tiresome old opera queen who complains that no one can sing Verdi anymore. At the same time, these recordings demonstrate that there never was a single Verdi style. Frida Leider delivers penetrating Verdi in German; Francesco Tamagno, the original Otello, sings in what sounds like a slight French accent (presumably an Italian dialect); Nellie Melba croons mercilessly. What the legends had in common was a way of seeming to reach the limit and then pushing over it. Caruso would swell his voice tremendously at moments where it ought to have given out; Rosa Ponselle would sustain a line over supernatural spans of time, so that the music acquired the steady glow of moonlight. Their feats seem physically unrepeatable: no one has lungs like that now.\n\nBut the exercise of praising long-gone singers at the expense of present-day ones is ultimately pointless, even destructive. Nothing could be more alien to Verdi's art than the solitary accumulation of artifacts. And, in truth, there are a lot of good Verdi singers around. Olga Borodina's performances of the major Verdi mezzo parts are as voluptuous and intelligent as any on record. Among sopranos, Maria Guleghina and Patricia Racette sing with dramatic fire, while Mariella Devia and Barbara Frittoli maintain a sense of high Verdi style. Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Franz Grundheber, and Mark Delavan are giving distinctive performances of the baritone roles. The young bass René Pape is as formidable in Verdi as he is in Wagner. As for the tenors, convincing successors to Domingo and Pavarotti have yet to appear, but there are some promising possibilities: Giuseppe Sabbatini has some of Pavarotti's elegance, Salvatore Licitra some of Domingo's presence. And more singers seem to be coming up: in a program of Verdi scenes given by Mannes College students, a young mezzo named Carmelita Mitchell smoldered in the role of Azucena.\n\nA singer who wishes to breathe new life into Verdi often has to get around not only the director's concepts but also the conductor's. Most conductors are trained by the modern conservatory mentality to resist the manifold changes of tempo—rubato, rallentando, stretto—that Italian singing encourages. You might expect to hear remnants of that tradition at La Scala, the original Verdi house, but Riccardo Muti, La Scala's longtime music director, is enamored of an inflexible, hard-driving sound. The \"Ballo in Maschera\" that I heard there last May inhabited much the same sound world as Richard Strauss's \"Elektra,\" and somewhere in the middle of the onslaught was Licitra, who sang with a long, stylish line while etching words sharply into the air. When he tried to linger over a possible epiphany, you could feel Muti tugging him onward, like a parent marching a child past a candy store. The performance felt like a succession of \"singer moments\" awkwardly inserted into a semi-symphonic narrative. Verdi resists brainstorming conductors as much as he resists brainstorming directors.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera tends to be a happier place for singers, especially when James Levine is on the podium. In and around the \"Trovatore\" disaster, the house offered two authentically singer-driven evenings last season: \"Aida\" in the winter, with Borodina finding a world of heartbreak in the vengeful Amneris, and \"Nabucco\" in the spring, with Guleghina seizing the vocally hazardous role of Abigaille. The \"Nabucco\" was, in fact, a triumph for all concerned; the director, Elijah Moshinsky, and the designer, John Napier, put together a creatively conservative production that was monumental in appearance and functional in practice. In one diva-ready set piece, Abigaille, Nebuchadnezzar's perpetually enraged daughter, is asked to descend from a huge statue of the god Baal down a long gold staircase. Guleghina took a devil-may-care attitude toward the role's precipitous leaps of register and dynamics, issuing wild notes as well as beautiful ones. But, in an echo of Callas's most famous ploy, she let the crisis in her voice shape the drama. The entire evening had an unchecked, carnival air, hearkening back to legendary old nights at the Met.\n\nAll the Verdi evenings I attended over the past year had one element in common: an air of alertness in the audience that was not evident at, say, symphony concerts. That soupçon of buzz at the Met or at City Opera was a reminder that opera is experiencing a remarkable period of growth. According to surveys, nearly a third of the operagoing American audience is under the age of thirty-five—a statistic that destroys the stereotype of the classical-music audience as a mob of blue-haired ladies. You see more indirect tremors of change in the culture at large: a new attraction to diva personalities; attempts at rock opera and even hip-hop opera; best-selling albums by quasi-operatic singers like Charlotte Church and Russell Watson. All this suggests a yearning to connect with the grand original. Verdi answers a need for emotional realism that pop music once offered in abundance but is now failing to provide.\n\nThe missing link, of course, is new opera that aspires to Verdi's populist ideals. The composer was, despite his universal appeal, a nineteenth-century artist, and his works cannot be given a contemporary gloss. The energy that has been channelled into opera direction ought to have gone into the creation of new opera. Yet Verdi has a special legacy in twentieth-century music; \"Otello\" and \"Falstaff,\" in particular, pointed toward a kind of modern, free tonality, one that was developed by composers as various as Strauss, Mahler, Nielsen, Janácek, Stravinsky, Britten, and even Alban Berg. There are signs of a renaissance of Verdian writing among contemporary composers, whether in the gaudy Latino pageants of Osvaldo Golijov's \"Passion\" or in the moody political tableaux of John Adams's \"Nixon in China.\" Any progress in contemporary opera in the next ten or twenty years is likely to come from a close study of the Verdi canon. How could a living composer write a \"Donna è mobile\"? What language would he use, for the tune itself and for the musical fabric that contains it? These seem like obvious questions, yet they are not often asked in college composition courses."
