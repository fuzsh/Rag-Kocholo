        "text": "Rhonda Joyner-Kersee Johnson is a recurring character in Black-ish, and the lesbian sister of Dre.\n\nRhonda is portrayed by Raven-Symoné.\n\nCharacter Info[]\n\nRhonda is the lesbian sister of Dre, daughter to Earl and Ruby. It is revealed that Rhonda hid her sexual orientation from Ruby, who is an extreme homophobe. In her debut episode, she and her fiance, Sharon Duckworth, were getting married. They have since split up.\n\nPersonality []\n\nRhonda is no-nonsense, hard-working, and a loving sister. She doesn’t own the same luxurious lifestyle as Dre, which prompts her to take on multiple jobs and numerous responsibilities. Originally, she and Dre were not very connected to each other until the moment Rhonda informed him of her marriage, but their relationship suffered tension from the episode “The Inheritance.” While she established a strong bond with Pops, it is hinted she holds a little resentment for Ruby, which stemmed from the fact that Rhonda is gay and Ruby is not very gay-friendly.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1 (1/24)[]\n\nPlease Don't Ask, Please Don't Tell (first appearance)\n\nSeason 2 (1/24)[]\n\nThe Word (as a child)\n\nChurched (as a child)\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nSeason 3 (1/24)[]\n\nOne Angry Man (mentioned only)\n\nWhat Lies Beneath\n\nSeason 4 (2/24)[]\n\nFirst and Last (as a teenager)\n\nInheritance\n\nSeason 5 (1/23)[]\n\nGood in the 'Hood\n\nSeason 6 (1/23)[]\n\nFather Christmas\n\nTrivia[]"
