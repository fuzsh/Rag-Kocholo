        "text": "May 29, 2024\n\nI’ve read several short novellas featuring Jayne Austen in holiday collections and wanted to read her main mystery series for ages. I love Jayne’s snarky voice, her cat named Prozac, and her hilarious “detective” work. Jayne’s real-life job is writing—as in resumes, love letters, ghost writing. When she is hired to write a love letter for a client (who she feels has no chance at the girl he wants), she reluctantly takes the job. But when the object of the love letter turns up dead, and her client is arrested, Jayne feels obligated to seek out the real murderer. I loved the fun cast of characters in this one.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\n3.5 rounded up because this author knows her way around self-deprecating humor!!\n\nA cozy mystery (first in the series) that I enjoyed despite a slightly obvious ending. I knew the murderer’s identity but it was still fun getting there with Jaine Austen and friends!!\n\nWill definitely be checking out the next one!!\n\n(Reviewed 1/7/24)\n\nJuly 21, 2022\n\nI had much fun with this book. It's not a striking plot, but I laughed out loud many times.\n\nSYNOPSIS: \"Smarmy personals ads. Daring declarations of love. Freelance writer Jaine Austen has penned them all. But no one needs her help more than geeky, gawky Howard Murdoch. His request is simple enough: a letter proclaiming his undying love for Stacy Lawrence, a gorgeous aerobics instructor. The fact that he's never actually met the woman gives Jaine pause--yet she soon overcomes her misgivings, and the unlikely Romeo lands a date! But his triumph is short-lived. On Valentine's Day, Howard finds Stacy bludgeoned to death with a Thigh Master--and is quickly named the prime suspect.\n\nJaine is shocked. Sure, Howard's awkward and eccentric. But a murderer? That's hard to believe. Especially after a little sleuthing reveals a plethora of people who harbored less-than-loving feelings towards the svelte Stacy. Now Jaine had better wrangle her clues quickly, before a crafty killer catches on--and puts a whole new spin on her ghost writing career...\"\n\nJuly 27, 2012\n\nIf I weren't sitting here writing a review of this book, I probably wouldn't even remember I read it this time next year. This piece of fluff is a book I found in the kitchen at my office and when I read Laura Levine's biography notes, I was immediately curious. Ms. Levine's t.v. credits including writing for The Bob Newhart Show, Three's Company and Laverne and Shirley, to name a few. Wondering how a sitcom writer would fare as a mystery novelist, I read this book over the course of four lunch breaks. The truth? It wasn't bad and even had a twist that surprised me. Where it fell apart for me was in the main character, Jaine Austen. Jaine is a 30-something divorced woman whose jobs including ghost writing letters for clients and teaching a memoir writing class at a senior center. When she writes a love letter for a man who is later accused of murder, her curiosity gets the better of her and she tries to figure out who really committed the crime. It's a decent set up but my problem with Jaine is that Levine's descriptions of her insecurities are over the top. Jaine comes off as being shallow, self-absorbed and quite frankly like a one-dimensional sitcom character. Granted, that type of character was Levine's stock in trade when she wrote for t.v. but I'm not certain it works for a novel, regardless of how \"fluffy\" the novel is supposed to be.\n\nMarch 1, 2019\n\nThe minute the heroine explained her name was \"Jaine Austen\" because her mother loved Jane Austen but couldn't spell, I knew this wasn't a mystery for me. I think I actually groaned.\n\nBut I waited months for this one so I figured should at least finish it. Unfortunately, it did not improve much. Guessed the murderer (though admittedly not the motive) immediately and spent the rest of the book bored. Jaine likes eating, mocking skinny people, and drinking margaritas. Oh, and whining about her lack of love life. Her motivation for solving the mystery made no sense.\n\nSome potential here but I fail to see what makes this one such a popular cozy mystery.\n\nMarch 8, 2016\n\nFrom the very start to the last sentence, This Pen For Hire kept me on my toes. It was flawless overall. I cannot praise this book highly enough. I'm usually very careful with my rating system and all the books that get a perfect score need to go that extra mile to get 5 stars. The pacing was wonderful in This Pen For Hire. There was no surplus padding, only lean muscle through and through. I could understand most of the jokes. The latter dried up after halfway through but by then things were getting serious anyway.\n\nThe only person I suspected turned out to be the culprit and I still was shocked. Wonderful book, can't stress that enough. I can't imagine how the second book in the series is going to live up to the first. The only predictable thing would be that the showdown will certainly have to occur at any place other than Jaine's house because of Lance's x-ray hearing. No unread book is guaranteed to be good and I do hope against hope that the series would find a new follower in me and make of me a lifelong fan of Laura Levine.\n\nJanuary 19, 2015\n\nI was sad to find myself unable to enjoy this. As protagonists go, I was kind of looking forward to a gun for hire writer type who stumbled into mystery situations. Sadly, I just wasn't engaged by this story.\n\nMost of that is on Jane (the protagonist). She's kind of prickly, more obsequious than nice, and kind of an idiot. She came off as a caricature of her premise and that just didn't do it for me.\n\nIt didn't help that Levine took the stereotype as an easy out every chance she got (well, in the first six chapters, anyway). From the lecherous old student in her volunteer class to the arresting officer in the central mystery, there wasn't a single element that stepped outside of what you'd get if it were written by a committee. And that happened over and over again.\n\nI was sad this didn't pan out, as it's a longish series that I thought had potential...\n\nJanuary 3, 2011\n\nReading on the train is not usually a problem, except when you are chuckling out loud and people are wondering what's wrong with you. Laura Levine's book is a most amusing mystery filled with lots of funny one-liners. The mystery is good and the book just lets you delve into Jaine's world. It is worth the read.\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nLaugh out loud funny. Read with a friend as part of a buddy read. I'm so glad she had this on the list.\n\nThe occupation of the main character is unique and little references are made throughout the book. Shortly after starting, I looked to see when the second book in the series was coming out, 2003 lolol. I had no clue. As of 2022 there are 19 books. The author writes sarcasm well, in addition the one liners cracked me up. The only issue for me was the repetitive answering the main character says to herself. It's enough that I wouldn't want to do a straight binge. However, one book every couple weeks until I get caught up I think I could do and not lose the quality and style of the main character's personality. It is part of the charm. The murder solution was perfect and spot on. I didn't see it coming as I thought this was a new release and well you can't kill off developed characters or can you?\n\nWhile looking for book #2 lolol and seeing the date, I realized why there was no mention of cell phones, but at least one pay phone was referenced. I enjoyed the 80-90 comments. FYI -- I knew in 2002 who Kinsey was 😍\n\nAbsolute joy to read. I do not recall any profanity.\n\nThis was a fast, short read. I did have the audible and loved the narrator.\n\nJanuary 23, 2014\n\nI really enjoyed this. It was fun, fast and witty. I had never heard of Jaine Austen, the PI/writer in it, until I saw a review of a later book on SuperWendy's blog, and I'm really pleased to have discovered a whole new series. I read this in two gulps. It doesn't matter that I guessed whodunit, that wasn't the point. Fave line - 'He claimed he was writing the great America novel, it turned out to be the great American paragraph.' So pleased to have found Jaine, and I know it won't be long before I read the next one.\n\nFebruary 10, 2017\n\nThis Pen for Hire is a quick, light and fluffy read that made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion. The premise is silly, and the mystery is quite predictable, but the attraction of this book is primarily the comical writing style. I greatly enjoy books where the main character almost compulsively tells lies, and in this aspect, Laura Levine does not disappoint. As Jaine Austen, the pen for hire, goes about attempting to uncover who the murderer is, she masquerades as a New York Times reporter and as a lawyer. It was quite humorous, but I would have liked to have seen more consequences from these lies. For example, Jaine tells Howard, the pathetic prime suspect, that she’s engaged so she can avoid dating him. It was never mentioned again, but it would have been funny if this fib had come back to bite her in the ass. (i.e. Howard could have mentioned this to Cameron, her love interest, who would have been immediately downtrodden by the news, breaking off their dinner date).\n\nAs hilarious as Jaine Austen and her cat, Prozac, are, I also would have liked to have seen stronger side characters. Lance is little more than a caricature of the typical nosy neighbour, and he’s the most well fleshed-out secondary character. I also wasn’t compelled by the romance, which is typically a highlight for these types of light reads.\n\nAll in all, this got 4 stars because it’s a quick read and it had me giggling on the train like a crazy person.\n\nAugust 14, 2021\n\nre-read still a 4 star funny read.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nI love Jaine Austen her\n\nmother is an Anglophile, and a bad speller\n\n, she’s funny, smart, a smart ass and a writer. The setting is great, L.A. and it feels like L.A.\n\nA famous philosopher (either Aristotle or Judith Krantz, I forget who) once said about being a woman in Los Angeles: If you’re blonde and beautiful, you’re interchangeable. If you’re not, you’re invisible.\n\nJaine quotes that immortal character\n\nBut in the words of that wise old philosopher, Bullwinkle J. Moose, things aren’t always what they seem in Frostbite Falls.\n\nand with all the jokes and wisecracks she solves the case because as I mentioned before Jaine is smart.\n\nJaine also has a wonderful cat named Prozac\n\nSo I grabbed her cat carrier from the hall closet. Which was, of course, a fatal mistake. The minute she saw it, she undoubtedly thought, “Uh-oh, another trip to that irritating veterinarian who keeps sticking thermometers up my butt.”\n\nThanks to a great review from Luffy one of my goodreads friends. I decide to give this rather low rated book a chance. Thanks so much Luffy it’s just as good as you said it was.\n\nCozies Reading Challenge\n\nAugust 10, 2012\n\nFirst time reader of this author. I enjoyed it. Prozac reminds me so much of my cat. I'm going to read the other books!\n\nNovember 6, 2016\n\nA screwball, humorous, and light cozy mystery.\n\nJanuary 27, 2014\n\nI am currently reading this book for the second time---the advantage of having all my books on my Nook! The voice of the main character is engaging and self-deprecating, but not to the point of being annoying. This is the book where we meet Jaine Austin, freelance writer-for-hire. She becomes involved in a murder mystery when one of her particularly pathetic clients is accused of murder. He hired Jaine to write a letter to get him a date---and said date is found bludgeoned to death with her thigh master, and the poor dateless client is found on the scene. Jaine is convinced of his innocence.\n\nWhile we want to know who dunnit, that is not entirely the point. It is fun to get into the head of the main character, Jaine, as she pushes beyond her usual boundaries and gets involved in a murder investigation. The book is more of a fun romp than a serious exercise in literature. But that is the point, I believe, and Laura Levine gives us a fun romp indeed.\n\nJuly 13, 2019\n\nThis was hilarious! If you like the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich you will love this. She is a bumbling freelance writer who writes a letter for someone so they could get a date and he ends up arrested for murder and Jaine knows he couldn't possibly be the murderer. She feels guilty about being the one who wrote the letter and so she tries to solve the murder and get Howard out if jail. It is slapstick funny. Can't wait to read the nezt one.\n\nJune 20, 2018\n\nA murder happens at Melrose Place and Rhoda from the Mary Tyler Moore show solves the case. Definitely written by a sitcom writer but it was very entertaining. A few odd/poor word descriptions of the female body that didn't fit in at all turning this mystery from PG to PG-13 thus the 3-star rating.\n\nFebruary 3, 2011\n\nJaine Austen (no relation) is a freelance writer who spends most of her time writing promotional mailers and leaflets for various companies. When geeky Howard Murdoch approaches her to write a love letter, and then admits he's never even spoken to the object of his affections, Jaine relucantantly agrees to help. To Jaine's surprise her letter works and wins Howard a date with the gorgeous aerobics instructor Stacy Lawrence. But the next thing she knows Stacy is found bludgeoned to death with a Thigh Master, and Howard is arrested. Jaine is sure he didn't do it and, with the police sure he did, she decides to investigate.\n\nI'd noticed a story by Laura Levine in an anthology (Candy Cane Murder) but as I brought the book for the Joanne Fluke story I'd never bothered reading it. After hearing Laura's praises sung I decided to give her writing a shot with the first in the Jaine Austen series. I'm really glad I did.\n\nThe plot is great - full of twists and turns, with a few red herrings thrown in. It isn't as cozy as most cozy mysteries as it's more self-aware and sex is mentioned quite frequently, but I loved it. The mystery was well thought out, with loads of possible suspects and a killer I didn't manage to figure out in advance. Having the book set in L.A. also meant that this wasn't a small-town setting so Jaine had to go out to a variety of places to snoop.\n\nI liked Jaine and her snarky sense of humour, and she was also believable in how and why she investigated Stacy's death. The possible romantic interest Cameron was well developed without taking over the storyline, although Detective Rea was a little underdeveloped. I loved the wider cast of characters, from the residents at the Shalom Retirement Home where Jaine teaches a memoir class to the potential suspects she investigates.\n\nAll in all this was a great read, and I'll be looking to pick up a copy of Last Writes (the second book in the series).\n\nPlot: 10/10\n\nCharacters: 9/10\n\nEnding: 10/10\n\nEnjoyment: 9/10\n\nCover: 8/10\n\nOverall: 46/50\n\nDecember 12, 2014\n\nI'm not completely against this book - I just thought it average. This is progress (or maybe its reverse), since a year ago I would have thrown a book at the wall whose heroine was as silly as this one. I guess as I grow older my patience for silliness increases. I felt kind of sad for Jaine though. First, she's stuck with a terrible name. Second, she acts like she's 18 when she's really 36. Third, she's so transparently desperate for a man in her life while maintaining that she's immune that it's pitiable. Eh. Anyway, the murder mystery is not much of a one. The killer is someone who the heroine does not suspect (as per usual) that the reader knows immediately who it is. There are red herrings galore, and a mildly different motive. It's ok. I guess I'll read #2 to see if it improves. 2 stars for this one.\n\nRead\n\nMay 14, 2017\n\nFreelance author Jaine Austen (her mother loved the classics but couldn't spell) is hired to pen a love letter, but when the recipient winds up dead, Jaine switches careers to amateur sleuth in this laugh-out-loud mystery. -- John C.\n\nMay 22, 2014\n\nCute, fluffy and funny. Somewhat on par with Stephanie Plum, but so far without the romance or even fictional eye-candy to ogle. Hopefully within the next couple of books or I'll probably push these all to the backburner.\n\nNovember 23, 2016\n\nA very good book, but I lost interest. I literally set this book down when I was half way through and read another books, but I picked it back up this morning and I enjoyed the ending. So, because I lost interest, I'm only giving this 3 stars.\n\nJune 3, 2015\n\nThis Pen For Hire, was laugh out loud funny.I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series.\n\nSeptember 5, 2016\n\nAs far as 'cozies' go- this was a good read- when I'm tired of the psycho, insane, stalker, killer books and need a break... will most definitely pick up the second book in this series!\n\nFebruary 1, 2020\n\nI won this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway. It was a cute start to a series with a lot of humor and good writing.\n\nApril 3, 2018\n\nJaine Austen makes a living ghost-writing anything from company brochures and personal ads to radio jingles and love letters in This Pen for Hire by Laura Levine. One day she gets a client, Howard Murdoch, who begs her to write a love letter for him to Stacy Lawrence, a girl he has worshipped from afar but always been too afraid to approach . Will Jaine write a letter in which she gets him a date with the lovely Stacy? Reluctantly, Jaine agrees, and Howard has what is probably the first date in his life set for Valentine’s Day.\n\nRead the rest of this review and other fun, geeky articles at Fangirl Nation\n\nFebruary 5, 2020\n\nI enjoyed the book. The protagonist has a great sense of humor throughout the story. I love her cat. He has an awesome personality which lends more humor to the book. I would love to see more interaction with the cat throughout the book. Overall, it’s a good cozy mystery. I will co to he the series.\n\nJune 4, 2024\n\nThis is the first book in the series (2002). Ms Levine is still at it 22 years later and so am I. Now I know how it all began! The author must be 81 by now - no wonder I relate to her!!\n\nI’ve met Prozac (my favorite) Kandi and Lance and some other screwballs as Jaine barrels along playing detective with her tongue in cheek. Mom and Dad and their emails haven’t started yet.\n\nAs soon as I get the bed made I’m off to read the second adventure.\n\nApril 12, 2017\n\nThe book that started it all! I read book #12 of this series first by accident, picking it up at the library without realizing that it was part of a series. Then I went back and tried to find the others, as much in order as I could, to catch up. While the Jaine Austen mystery books can certainly be read in any order, it was interesting to see the \"roots\" of the characters by finally reading the very first book.\n\nLaura Levine's heroine, Jaine Austen (not relation!) is a writer who keeps stumbling into dead bodies. A little bored with writing ads for the likes of Toiletmasters and the Mattress King, Jaine decides that she likes the excitement of solving murders.\n\nJaine is a \"real\" person, with difficult hair, a tummy and tush to much her appetite for non-salad food, and a cat named Prozac firmly entrenched as the \"significant other\" in her life. I could be friends with her. :)"
