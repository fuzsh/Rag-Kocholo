        "text": "The new productions at the Glimmerglass Opera this summer are engendering yet more debate about a perennial hot topic: the pervasive influence of directors with modernistic staging concepts. This adventurous company inevitably courts such debate by entrusting its offerings to notable strong-minded directors. Often the risks pay off, as with Rhoda Levine's bitterly comic production of Robert Kurka's seldom-heard ''Good Soldier Schweik,'' which I attended on Saturday afternoon, and Chas Rader-Shieber's enchanting production of Handel's ''Orlando,'' which I took in Saturday night.\n\nOn the other hand Friday night's feature here was Christopher Alden's staging of Offenbach's operetta ''Bluebeard,'' an indulgent exercise in lunacy that was over the top by about two-thirds.\n\nMr. Alden's production is grabbing most of the attention, which is pretty much the way he likes things. In this 1866 opéra-bouffe the legend of the serial wife murderer becomes a spoof on the marriage mores of 19th-century Parisian society. Offenbach's Bluebeard is a charming and easily bored womanizer who dispatches wife after wife to Popolani, his vexed servant, also an expert alchemist, for disposal (or so Bluebeard thinks).\n\nMr. Alden sets the tale in a garish modern hotel, which John Conklin's sets depict through wildly flowered wallpaper and lots of neon. Every character is made an awkwardly obvious comic stereotype. Bluebeard (the lanky and agile tenor Tracey Welborn) is a breezy Southerner who speaks in a drawl and wears khakis and golf shirts. Fleurette (Monica Yunus, a fresh-voiced soprano), a flower seller who turns out to be a princess, speaks Brooklynese, like Adelaide in ''Guys and Dolls.'' Popolani (the appealing bass Kevin Burdette) trades in his leather duds and becomes an Elvis impersonator when Bluebeard marries his sixth wife, Rubenesque Boulotte (the dusky-voiced mezzo-soprano Phyllis Pancella) in a chintzy chapel. King Bobèche (the veteran tenor Anthony Laciura) is a Mafia boss. Yes, you guessed it: an unshaven, cigar-chomping, crude-mouthed guy who walks around in an undershirt shouting at his loud, big-haired wife.\n\nIt's genuinely funny to see a chorus of the king's subjects -- a bedraggled lot of would-be brides and grooms -- forcing their enthusiasm as they salute Bluebeard and Boulotte with the chorus ''Hymen, guide them,'' as performed here in Charles Kondek's English translation. But the production reduces the work to a series of nonstop antics and sight gags, and ''Bluebeard'' is not a Marx Brothers movie.\n\nThere is refinement and musical richness in the score, which emerges now and then from Gerald Steichen's stylish conducting. Mr. Alden is capable of brilliantly imaginative work, but too often in comic operas he slips into a repertory of shtick. Whether it's Rossini, Offenbach or Virgil Thomson, you get the same show.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
