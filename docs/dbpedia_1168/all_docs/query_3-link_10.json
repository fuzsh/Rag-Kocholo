        "text": "Rhonda Faye Levine and Arieh Albert Ullmann are to be married Sunday at Beth David Synagogue in Binghamton, N.Y. Rabbi Zev Silber is to perform the ceremony with Rabbi Barbara Goldman-Wartell participating.\n\nMs. Levine, 61, is keeping her name. She is a sociology professor at Colgate University who has written six books, including “Class, Networks and Identity: Replanting Jewish Lives From Nazi Germany to Rural New York.” She graduated from Michigan State and received a master’s in sociology from McGill. She also holds a Ph.D. in sociology from the State University at Binghamton. She is a daughter of Rae Levy Levine of Peabody, Mass., and the late Frank Levine.\n\nHer previous marriage ended in divorce.\n\nThe groom, 67, is an associate professor of international business and strategy in the School of Management at Binghamton. He is on the boards of Beth David Synagogue and the Binghamton Philharmonic. He graduated with a degree in biochemistry from the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. He also graduated with a degree in business administration from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, from which he also received a doctorate in business management. He is a son of the late Lilly Ullmann and the late Walter Ullmann, who lived in Zurich.\n\nHe is a widower.\n\nThe couple’s introduction came only after great hesitation by Ms. Levine and some significant resistance, for wholly different reasons, from Mr. Ullmann as well.\n\nOnce, when someone pointed him out to her at an oldies temple dance, she recalled thinking, “he was attractive, but I didn’t think it would ever work.” As a board member of the Jewish Federation of Greater Binghamton, and past president of the Orthodox synagogue (she went to the Reform synagogue), he seemed more religious and more involved in the Jewish community than she ever was. She added, “I thought our politics would not exactly match.” Later, when Ms. Levine’s friend alerted her that he was available, she would have none of it.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, Mr. Ullmann, who was then involved with someone else, took umbrage when a fellow board member who was aware that he was in a relationship began nudging him in front of two other members to consider dating a “warm, intelligent” woman he knew.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
