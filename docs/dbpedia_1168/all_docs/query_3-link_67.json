She was a member of the American Labor Party, and she was involved in the women's suffrage and trade union movements. She also participated in civil rights activities and lent her support to such causes as the trials of the Scottsboro Boys and Angelo Herndon.

Franklin Frazier. The material regarding Wright concerns his writings and his withdrawal from the Communist Party of the U.S. Frazier was a prominent educator and sociologist. His correspondence with Guggenheimer relates mainly to an incident reported in the Black Dispatch and The People's Voice alleging that he had violated a labor organized boycott against a restaurant in Harlem that did not employ African Americans (1945). Other material peripherally relates to his career and the fight against racial segregation in Washington, D.C., during World War II. Five articles written by Frazier are included in this collection.
