        "text": "Otto Muller got his start at age 16 playing jazz piano under an assumed name at casinos, bars, restaurants, and mafia Christmas parties in upstate New York. Prior to coming to Vermont Vaudeville, he has worked as an accompanist at Improv Olympic and ComedySports in Chicago and for Rhoda Levine’s courses in improvised opera, and has collaborated with the Titanic Players in Evanston, IL, the Real-Dream Cabaret in Buffalo, NY, Grafted Cede Theatre Company in London. Outside of the vaudeville, Muller is a composer of delicately uncomfortable avant- garde chamber music and a faculty member at Goddard College."
