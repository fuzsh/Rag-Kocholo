        "text": "Faith-Driven Entreprenuer! For me, the opportunity to integrate my faith into my career was a big factor in my decision to become a faith-based entrepreneur. Faith is a core part of my identity, and I wanted to bring that into the work that I do. I feel like my faith gives me a deeper sense of purpose and meaning in my work... As a faith-based entrepreneur, I have the freedom to set my own schedule, choose my own projects, and work with people who share my values.... As a faith-based entrepreneur, I've been able to connect with other people who share my faith and values, and we've been able to support and encourage each other on our journeys. For me, one of the most meaningful parts of being a faith entrepreneur is the opportunity to use my business as a force for good. I'm passionate about making a positive difference in the world through my business, whether it's through charitable giving, sustainable practices, or fair treatment of employees. I find that this gives my work a deeper sense of meaning and purpose; all to the Glory of God (1 Corinthians 10:31). I am simply a man who's on a mission from God to democratize empowerment opportunities for youths and to expand God's Kingdom on Earth by preaching Christ. What is your driving force? ***** Image:With Ekomobong, a part of my community and a person of faith who's also driven by her faith in God. #FaithNwaobia #faithingod\n\nI am a mother... I am a caregiver... I am an entrepreneur... I am a student... I am‚Ä¶ a woman of many roles. üìåMy experience as a mother and an entrepreneur has been both rewarding and challenging. To me, being a mother is one of the most crucial and fulfilling roles a person can have. Every day, I see myself shaping and guiding the lives of my children. I am responsible for providing love, support, and care for them, and helping them to develop into happy, healthy, and successful adults. üìåAs an entrepreneur, I also have the responsibility of running a business and ensuring its long-term success. I have to be creative, innovative, a risk-taker, industrious, goal-oriented, and adaptive. There are times when these responsibilities overlap, and it can be difficult and sometimes overwhelming to balance both roles, but it is also incredibly rewarding! My family is both my motivation and strength to be a successful entrepreneur. Overall, each of these roles requires a unique set of skills and qualities, but they all share a common thread: ‚ù§Ô∏èa commitment to making a positive impact in the lives of others‚ù§Ô∏è Whether you are a mother, caregiver, entrepreneur, or anything else, you have the opportunity to make a real difference in the world and leave a lasting legacy. What will your legacy be?\n\nHow does healing your relationship with money look like for an entrepreneur? For me it meant that I trully fell in love with my coaching again. It looked like I got obsessed with it ALL. Not just some parts! üî•All of it became my passion. Even those long hours spend on marketing that didn't seem to bring anything in return. üî•I stopped caring about what if others don't like me, if they unfriend me or get upset with me! üî•I dived all in again giving it my best as if the entire world was suppoorting me in my mission! And that mission became my life. These are not just words, it's facts that as an entrepreneur I no longer feel defeated by potential clients saying NO, when occassionally there are crickets on my marketing or things get tough at times. And this is just a fragment to what healing your relationship with money can mean to your business and YOU. Because when you heal the relatioinship with money, you heal YOU. Are you ready to go for it?

Can you aim high and make lots of money without being seen as greedy? It's a tricky balance. Raising prices for better services might mean some old customers can't afford it, but does that make you greedy? Making a profit is usually seen as a sign of success, but is it always about greed? Or is it just a necessary part of running a business? When making decisions, should you think more about what's best for the business or what's affordable for the customers? It's a hard choice, especially when considering if customers can afford it if the business doesn't grow. Assuming someone can't afford our services can be limiting. Some people might actually see more value in what we offer, especially if our prices reflect our high quality. By doing something different, can we succeed and stand out from the crowd? As someone who comes up with new ideas, it can be hard to explain them in a way that non-entrepreneurs understand. Is honesty always the best policy, or should you sometimes stay quiet? It's normal for people not to understand big ideas at first. Often, they only believe in them when they see them come true. Can you believe in something and know it at the same time? If you see it clearly, do you even need to believe in it? Maybe believing means there's still some doubt. So, thinking big is important. But is thinking big greedy or just ambitious? Where is that line? If you think success is about getting more and depriving others, then you've missed the point. To gain more, you must provide more. Offer a better service. Make more people feel good. These questions show how tricky it is to balance ambition with caring for others, growing the business with keeping it affordable, and having a vision with explaining it clearly. As we navigate these challenges, the goal is to make sure our business dreams match real value, making sure our growth is both smart and fair. #howtoprice #pricing #value #givingvalue #foodforthought #ambition #greedy\n\nDealing with overwhelm and not knowing which step to take first and next as a Mama Entrepreneur is exhausting‚Ä¶ It can be really hard to even know where to begin‚Ä¶ I get it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve seen this over and over again‚Ä¶ Strong, resilient, purpose driven female entrepreneurs who are‚Ä¶ Persistently stressed Repeatedly overwhelmed Feel disorganized and unsure of which steps will truly result in their success And, heartbroken that they haven‚Äôt yet hit a steady, sustainable stride that allows them balance & time for creativity, self-care, and their precious children.

It was an honest mistake. ‚ÄúWhen are you due?‚Äù I asked the lady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not pregnant,‚Äù she said with a sour look on her face. Then I felt a hot sensation as her husband‚Äôs angry look burned a hole in my forehead. Thankfully, they didn‚Äôt hold a grudge, once I told them I was an introvert and didn‚Äôt get out much. But it just reminded me how no matter how sure I am things are one way - I can be totally wrong. And it made me think of how business is like that. Like, I can be so sure that an idea will do well, or that a marketing plan will work, or that an investment will do well. Only to be disappointed time and again. This is why, I decided to protect against that by making sure I‚Äôm part of a community. Because no matter how flat my flatsides are. My community will help me watch my six. And they care for me enough to tell me the truth, before I make decisions that I‚Äôll regret. So don‚Äôt make the mistake I did. Make sure you‚Äôre part of a community of people that will support and help you see the truth. And who will prevent you and your business from getting punched in the face. Will Pe√±a.

Her ode to rappers from back in the day and the entrepreneurial journey is something we can all learn from. Here are three key takeaways: 1. Watch the entire speech to understand that Issa was joking. She knows she didn't rise alone, but she did put in the work and brought others along with her. 2. When someone helps you, represent well and don't let them down. Reach back and say thank you. People don't have to do anything for you, so when they do, be grateful. You don't have to do it loud because if they are a real one, they don't want you to tell everyone. 3. Always ask \"what can I do for you\" before you take. Community building of the 1970s got lost through generations. Don't lose your manners as you rise to the top of your game. Let's keep growing and building strong relationships. #smallbusiness #smallbusinessowner #business #businesswoman #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #friendship #family #relationships #community\n\nTell me if this is you: You know your spouse‚Äôs birthday is coming up in a month. You told yourself ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to do it right this time‚Äù I‚Äôm going to get her something SHE loves and wants. I‚Äôm going to make her feel like the only thing in the world.
