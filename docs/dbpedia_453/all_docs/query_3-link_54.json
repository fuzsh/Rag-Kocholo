        "text": "December 11: Sow For The Spirit \"For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.\" Galatians 6:8 Matthew 6:33 says, “But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you”. If you have some things that need to be added or even multiplied, seek first the kingdom of God. Seeking is an action verb. Too many Christians live from payday to payday. If you want different results in your finances you are going to have to do some things differently. Everything in your spiritual walk comes back to a seed. The seed is the Word of God in your life. That seed needs to be watered, nurtured and cultivated to fulfill its purpose. Are you planting seeds of faith, love, hope, compassion, and joy? What you sow you will reap. Till your garden and it will grow.\n\nBoukman Barima, K. (2017). Obeah to Rastafari: Jamaica as a Colony of Ridicule, Oppression and Violence, 1865-1939. Journal of Pan African Studies, 10(1). Chicago Abstract: The colonial state of Jamaica and its attending institutions have given free passes for how it has ridiculed, suppressed, and violently attacked Revivalism, Pocomania, Obeah, and Rastafari. This paper provides a stream of correctives for the practice of shielding the colonial state and its institutions from criticism. Exposing colonialism's contempt for Black Spiritualism and Ethiopianism is demonstrated through interrogating Leonard P. Howell, Alexander Bedward, and Paul Bogle. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, corridor, Bogle, Bedward, and Howell suffered severe persecution and owning to ways they articulated liberation through Black spiritualism and Ethiopianism as the elites branded Obeah, Revivalism, Pocomania, and Rastafari as seditious and pathways to lunacy. Labeling Jamaica's Black spiritual traditions as criminal and madness served as justifications to terrorize, imprison, and murder Obeah workers, Revivalists, and Rastas. Addressing this theater of ridicule and violence shifts attention towards Jamaica's harsh racial milieu were the consequences Afro-Jamaicans suffered for clinging to African spiritual ways and seeking redemption through Ethiopian paradigms that included but were not limited to beatings, imprisonment, and mockery. #babylonianinterruption #antibabylon #nattynever #getweary\n\nDecember 20: God's Wealth \"Then you say in your heart, ‘My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth’.\" Deuteronomy 8:17 Abraham believed God for a seed. This seed would fulfill the Covenant of Promise God made with Abraham. Paul had to clarify to the New Testament Jews that the Law was not the promise, but Christ (Galatians 3:17-19). Christ is the Seed which brings the blessing (Galatians 3:16). Christ compared His life to a seed that went into the ground to give life (John 12:24). The principle of sowing and reaping is evident in the life of Christ. When you covenant to plant a seed, you are following Jesus’ example. The spiritual law of Jesus is “give and it shall be given”. God gives you a return to further establish His covenant in the earth (Deuteronomy 8:18). God’s covenant is to bless the seed of Abraham. Your seed is symbolic of Christ’s giving character. When you give your seed to the Seed (Christ), He gives His seed (blessings from heaven) to your seed (your life) to produce more seed (those who need to be saved). Sowing and reaping is a way of life.\n\nDecember 12: Reaping A Harvest \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Hosea 4:6 So many Christians are uninformed about God’s instructions. Once you know and understand the spiritual laws of sowing and reaping put in motion by a sovereign God, you cannot stay bound by poverty and failure. 2 Corinthians 8:9 says, “For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.” I want to encourage you to live the life of a faith-filled believer. All the promises of God are yea and amen to them that believe. 2 Corinthians 9:6-8 in the Amplified Version says, “Remember this: He who sows sparingly and grudgingly will also reap sparingly and grudgingly; and he who sows generously, and that blessings may come to someone, will also reap generously and with many blessings.” If you are struggling, ask yourself, “Am I giving to God what is His?” God doesn’t need what you have, but you certainly need His fathomless riches. God’s requirement for blessing to be released from His hand is first for giving to be released from yours. Start giving your best today. Giving leads to prosperity... spirit soul and body.\n\nNovember 30: Ignorance Can Kill You \"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.\" Hosea 4:6 Without knowledge of the truth, we cannot be free. It is possible to have a right heart for God and yet to have things all wrong in our heads. With a wrong head, we may live in complete defeat and forfeit ground in the kingdom of God that we were never intended to lose. Our lives can be utterly destroyed because of ignorance. We are sometimes ignorant of the truth, and until we learn it, we remain in bondage to our old ways and habits. It is vital to be in a church that is preaching the whole truth and counsel of God. Then we must study the Word and make it practical and applicable to our daily lives. When we seek answers to our day to day life issues in God’s Word, our lives become so much easier. What are you doing to gain truth? Is God’s Word a steady diet in your spiritual meal? Your life depends on it. The saying goes, “He or she is sincere but sincerely wrong.” Even though our motives are right if we do not have the proper foundation, our actions bring us up short in the long-distance race of life. Evaluate your habits, your prayer life, your church attendance, and your Bible reading. Decide what changes you need to make and put them into practice. What is in your head will be determined by your habits."
