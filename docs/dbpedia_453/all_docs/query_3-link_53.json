        "text": "Uche Edochie, an elder brother of actor Yul Edochie, has come out to speak on the actor’s decision to take actress Judy Austin Moghalu, as a second wife after welcoming a son with her.\n\nIn his post, Uche pointed out that his family is not in support of Yul’s decision to take a second wife but they cannot make him to do otherwise since he is an adult. He said his family is at this time trying to console Mary, his first wife.\n\nUche also asked people not to be quick to judge his brother as women throw themselves at famous people “so bad that it is suffocating.”\n\n”If the average person walks in Yul’s shoes for one year, they will get five or more women pregnant. So don’t be quick to judge if you have not lived that life. Most people will do worse.” he wrote\n\nHe concluded by saying his wishes his brother and his family ”luck.”\n\nRead Uche’s post below\n\n”Hello guys. So my younger brother Yul Edochie just married a second wife out of the blue and Nigerians are freaking out. I get it. We are all shocked. I am a low key type of guy and I have tried to mind my own business but this circus is chasing me around too. So here is my take.\n\nI see two main problems here. His first wife Mary, a wonderful woman and my sister in law did not go into a relationship with my brother agreeing to be part of a polygamous marriage. That’s the first problem. So I feel for Mary. It is not fair on her. My family is not in support. This is not what we do and we are trying our best to console Mary. What else can we do?\n\nThe second issue is that Yul is not a Muslim. If he was a Muslim, no one will be talking about this. Muslims marry as many wives as they want and nobody says shit. Traditional rulers and traditionalists of sorts do the same thing too and the Nigerian constitution recognizes polygamy as a legal marital union. Maybe we should burn that bloody constitution.\n\nWe told Yul not to do it. He did it anyway. Have you ever tried controlling an adult when it comes to relationships? Good luck with that. Yul is an adult who feels marrying a second woman is the best way to own up to his mistakes and make things right. It took a lot of courage for him to do this too.\n\nA Muslim marries two or more wives and his people throw a party. Totally normal. A Christian does the same thing and he is the worst human being alive. It is tough. Women throw themselves at famous people so bad that it is suffocating. If the average person walks in Yul’s shoes for one year, they will get five or more women pregnant. So don’t be quick to judge if you have not lived that life. Most people will do worse.\n\nSo this is Yul’s new baby with his new wife. Beautiful boy. Children are gifts from God. It is the circumstances of their birth that gets us all riled up about what’s right and wrong. I wish them all luck. Maybe Yul should become a Muslim and shut this circus down. It is said that life is what happens when we are making other plans. I was minding my own business. And now this. Fantastic.”"
