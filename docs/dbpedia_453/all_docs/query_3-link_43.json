        "text": "May Edochie, the first wife of Nollywood actor Yul Edochie has recounted her experience with depression after the actor took a second wife.\n\nMay shared this revelation in a Facebook Live.\n\nIn the video, she said, “Some people are saying May is using this to cash out. I don’t wish this against my enemy. Depression is real. And there are different stages of depression. For me, rather than dwell in depression, I decided to pick the pieces of the beautiful world I had, a very beautiful world that I had.”\n\n“An amazing family that suddenly shattered and I decided to pick up the pieces and try to move on rather than dwell in depression. It has not been easy. I’m glad that I look happy and appear strong.”\n\n“I’m glad that I have been able to go out there and do stuff. It is because of the love and support from my family and you guys. The love has been massive. These are the things that have kept me going.”\n\nRecall that back in April, Yul unveiled his second wife and son on social media.\n\nSharing a photo of his son on Instagram, he wrote, “It’s time for the world to meet my son. His name is STAR DIKE MUNACHIMSO YUL-EDOCHIE. Born by my second wife @judyaustin1 And I love him so much, just as much as I love my other children.”\n\nHis announcement shocked many Nigerians as the actor is well known for his regular posts about his commitment to his wife and how she has stood by him.\n\nHowever, May has always expressed her displeasure about her husband’s decision to take a second wife.\n\nA few days after Yul’s announcement, May thanked everyone for reaching out to her after the shocking news broke on the Internet.\n\n“I sincerely want to appreciate everyone for the tremendous love, prayers and support from all over the world. It has really been overwhelming. You have all been an incredible pillar of strength during this trying period.”\n\n“My phones are buzzing once again due to the OLD video trending online today. My family and faith ABSOLUTELY do NOT practice polygamy, although it works for some people,” she added.\n\nIn November 2021, May hinted at trouble in her marriage after she shared a cryptic message on IG.\n\nShe shared a photo of the Obamas in their early years and after becoming the US First Family, writing, “Never forget a woman who helped you to build yourself and stand by you by when you had nothing… if she was with you in hell, be with her in paradise.”\n\nYul and May Edochie have been married for sixteen years."
