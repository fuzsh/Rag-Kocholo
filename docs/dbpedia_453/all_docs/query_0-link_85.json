        "text": "Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, on Thursday hailed his first wife, May, via an Instagram post.\n\nSharing photos of the mother-of-four, Yul Edochie noted that she was his undisputed “number one”.\n\nHe wrote, “Number one @mayyuledochie. Undisputed.”\n\nThis came a few hours after Yul went public with his second marriage and announced fellow Nollywood actress, Judy Austin.\n\nThe actor caused a stir on social media on Wednesday when he added that his new wife already had a son for him.\n\nEdochie’s first wife of 17 years, May, also reacted to the news, as she called down the judgement of God on the latest couple.\n\nTaking to the comment section of her husband’s announcement post, she wrote, “May God judge you both.”\n\nCommenting on the trending news, ex-presidential aide, Reno Omokri noted that polygamy is not a sin, adding that it is better than adultery or fornication.\n\nWhile announcing his new son, Yul Edochie added that he loves the child as much as he loved his older four children, whom he shared with his first wife, May.\n\nEdochie wrote, “It’s time for the world to meet my son. His name is STAR DIKE MUNACHIMSO YUL-EDOCHIE. Born by my second wife, Judy Austin. And I love him so much, just as much as I love my other children.”\n\nYul, the last child of veteran actor, Pete Edochie, married his first wife at the young age of 22, and they have four kids together."
