        "text": "Ace Nigerian movie star and filmmaker, Yul Edochie, has emphasised that he is just a very good actor and not a ritualist.\n\nHis statement stems from the fact that he has gained popularity by portraying movie roles as a ritualist.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the actor stated that he is a very good actor and not a ritualist because people often send him messages asking how they can do money rituals.\n\nThe son of Nollywood’s living legend, Pete Edochie, said, “Some people are sending me messages begging me to show them where they can do money rituals. Come on now guys, come on. Na film I dey act.\n\n“Just like American action films where one man will defeat a whole city of bad guys. Na storyline be that, e no dey happen. Is it now a crime to be a good actor? Make I no chop??? Na wa for una oo.”(sic)\n\nTo prove his point, the actor shared a screenshot of a message from one of his fans.\n\nIn the direct message sent to him, the fan wrote, “Afa bro, where e dey happen. Give me location I’m ready for sacrifice abeg. I message KOK, he never answer me. I will keep everything secrets. I promise. Just take me to baba make I run my own sharp.”(sic)\n\nTaking to the caption section, Edochie noted that he gets such messages daily.\n\nHe wrote, “This is just one of the many messages I receive daily. Some are even more serious than this. Some say I no wan cut soap for boys. Which soap abeg??? Naija oo. Wahala everywhere.\n\nI love this country.” (sic)\n\nThe thespian is one of the Nigerian actors known for his roles as an occult member.\n\nBorn Yul Chibuike Daniel Edochie, the actor is named after popular Russian actor, Yul Brynner.\n\nEdochie Joined Nollywood in 2005 when he featured in his first film titled ‘The Exquires’, alongside the Late Justus Esiri and Enebeli Elebuwa.\n\nHowever, he got his major break in 2007 after featuring alongside Genevieve Nnaji and Desmond Elliot in the movie ‘Wind Of Glory’.\n\nSource: Punch"
