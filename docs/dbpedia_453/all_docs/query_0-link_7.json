        "text": "Yul Edochie is a prominent Nigerian actor, filmmaker, and politician, born on January 7, 1982, in Lagos, Nigeria. He hails from a family deeply rooted in the Nigerian entertainment industry, as the son of veteran actor Pete Edochie. Yul Edochie's acting career took off in the early 2000s, and he gained widespread recognition for his roles in Nollywood movies such as \"Wind of Glory,\" \"The Mirror,\" and \"Pleasure and Crime.\" His charismatic performances and versatility have solidified his status as one of the most sought-after actors in the Nigerian film industry.\n\nYul Edochie has also made forays into politics, running for the position of Governor of Anambra State in 2017. While he did not emerge victorious, his political aspirations garnered significant attention and sparked discussions about the intersection of entertainment and governance in Nigeria. Edochie's bold move into politics showcased his commitment to contributing to societal change beyond the realm of entertainment.\n\nThe actor has been the talk of social media after he took colleague Judy Austin as a second wife and even had two children with her. Since then, social media users have registered their displeasure at the actorâ€™s deeds claiming that he did not treat his first wife May Edochie well."
