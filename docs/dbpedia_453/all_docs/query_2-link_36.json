May God lead and protect you always. With many more happy years. Daddy loves you.”\n\nMeanwhile, confirming the news of his death, a family member who spoke with Vanguard, was quoted as saying that Kambilichukwu died on Thursday.\n\n“After his exam in school, he joined his mates to play football and he developed a seizure and was rushed to the Mother and Child Hospital. All efforts by the doctors to resuscitate him proved abortive,” she added."
