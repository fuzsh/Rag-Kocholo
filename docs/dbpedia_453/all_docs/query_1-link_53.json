        "text": "Nollywood actor Yul Edochie has declared his intention to run for the office of the president of Nigeria in 2023.\n\nThe actor, who declared this on his verified Twitter handle while marking his 39th birthday on Thursday, said it was imperative as youths deserve a chance to fix Nigeria.\n\n10 solid reasons why budget 2021 should be scrapped (II)\n\nChaotic scenes at NIMC enrolment centres\n\nEdochie said: “Happy 39th birthday to me. Last year I asked for wisdom, you gave it to me Lord.\n\n“This year I ask for your grace oh Lord as I prepare to run for President of Nigeria in 2023.\n\n“To bring real Peace, Unity & Progress. The youths deserve a chance to fix our Nation So help us God. Amen!” The actor noted.\n\nIn 2017, Yul Edochie declared his intention to run for Governor of Anambra State. He made the declaration in anticipation of a Not Too Young To Run Bill passed by the Senate.\n\nThe declaration was however made official in August 2017, when he picked up the nomination form of the Democratic Peoples Congress and became the flag bearer and gubernatorial candidate of the party to run for governor of Anambra State.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, Yul Edochie (born Yul Chibuike Daniel Edochie 7 January 1982) is a Nigerian actor, named after popular Russian actor Yul Brynner.\n\nHe is from Anambra State Nigeria and the son of Nigerian actor Pete Edochie. He was raised both in Lagos and Enugu.\n\nYul is the last of six children, and got married at the age of 22. In 2015, Yul Edochie opened a film academy in Lagos.\n\nHe launched the academy as a result of the decline in quality and professionalism of upcoming Nigerian actors and actresses. The academy as stated by him is supposed to train the next generation of Nollywood actors and actresses. The academy gives talented people the opportunity to be introduced to the Nigerian Film Industry."
