        "text": "Yul Edochie (born on 7 January 1982), also known as Yul Chibuike Daniel Edochie, is a Nigerian actor named after Russian actor Yul Brynner. He is from Anambra State, Nigeria and the son of Nigerian actor Pete Edochie.\n\nHe was raised both in Lagos and Enugu. He is the last of six children. He got married at the age of 22. He attended the University of Port Harcourt, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Dramatic Arts.\n\nHe is married to May Aligwe and has 3 boys and a girl. They are Kambilichukwu Leo Edochie,[1][2] Dani Edochie, Karl Edochie and Victory Zane Chukwubuike Edochie.\n\nOn 30 March 2023, it was reported that Kambi, Yul Edochie's first son, had died due to a seizure.[3] The following day Isaiah Ogedegbe chided Prophet Samuel King for his total lack of sympathy for the Edochie's family when he came out to say that he had predicted Kambi's death before it happened.[1][2]"
