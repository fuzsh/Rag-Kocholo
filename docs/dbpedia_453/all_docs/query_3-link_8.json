        "text": "Nigerian actor (born 1947)\n\nChief Pete Edochie, MON (born March 7, 1947) [1][2] is a veteran Nigerian actor.[3] Edochie is considered one of Nigeria’s most talented actors, being honored with an Industry Merit Award by Africa Magic and Lifetime Achievement by Africa Film Academy[4] Once an administrator and broadcaster,[5] he came into prominence in the 1980s, when he played the lead role of 'Okonkwo' in a Nigerian Television Authority adaptation of Chinua Achebe’s all-time best-selling novel, Things Fall Apart. Edochie descends from the Igbo people of Nigeria and is a Catholic.[6] In 2003, he was honored as a Member of the Order of the Niger by President Olusegun Obasanjo.[7][8]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nEdochie was born in Zaria, Kaduna State on March 7, 1947.[9] He hails from Nteje in Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State, and is married to Josephine Edochie.[10] He schooled at St. Patrick’s and St. James Primary School, Zaria, before proceeding to St. John’s College for his secondary education.[11] He also schooled at the School of Journalism and Television in England. Edochie celebrated his 70th birthday in 2017, and said he still feels strong despite having spent \"3 scores and ten\" years. \"Taking life easy and planning purposefully for everything makes life worth living as well as ageing gracefully,\" he said.[12] Pete Edochie is married with six children.\n\nIn 2009, Edochie was kidnapped and later released by his captors, unharmed.[13][14]\n\nIn September 2017, Edochie endorsed the Wikimedia movement in Nigeria by appearing in a video to increase awareness and use of Wikipedia among the older generations.[15][16]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nEdochie got into radio broadcasting in 1967 at the age of 20[17] as a junior programs assistant after which he was elevated to the level of a director. He was director of programs but doubling sometimes as Deputy Managing Director and occasionally acting as Managing Director. He quit Anambra Broadcasting Service (ABS) because the government decided to politicize the affairs of their FM station, thereby resulting in the entire management being asked to move out, including him. He was to be the immediate successor to the MD but had to leave and enroll into the movie industry. Prior to that, he had featured in Things Fall Apart and had won an International Award. The BBC flew into Nigeria to interview him for his role in Things Fall Apart.[1]\n\nIn 2005, the Actors Guild of Nigeria placed Edochie and several other actors, including Genevieve Nnaji, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, Nkem Owoh, Ramsey Nouah, Stella Damasus Aboderin, and Richard Mofe Damijo, on a one-year ban from filming, after they were said to have been collecting huge fees from producers due to their perceived A-list celebrity status.[18]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
