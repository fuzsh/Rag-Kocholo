        "text": "Renowned Nigerian actor and director Yul Edochie has taken to social media to forcefully deny the widespread claims surrounding his viral pictures with late Nigerian filmmaker Ason Rich.\n\nThe Lagos state police command said last week that it had executed nine alleged kidnappers who “targeted high net-worth residents” in the state.\n\nBenjamin Hundeyin, the command’s spokesperson, revealed that the suspects were killed following a gunfight.\n\nIn an unexpected twist to the kidnapping case, Ason Rich, a well-known movie producer, surfaced as one of the main suspects.\n\nThe viral photo of him with Yul, which was widely included in news about the dead director and presented them as close friend, added a strong dose of scandal to the emerging story.\n\nFuming over blogs falsely portraying him as close friends with the late filmmaker, Yul Edochie took to his social media platform with a fiery video.\n\nYul lambasted the media manipulation that transformed his innocent pictures into misleading headline.\n\nHe vehemently debunked any friendship, clarified that their only interaction was a chance meeting on a movie set where they snapped a photo together.\n\nWith his reputation under siege, he delivered a blistering warning to those intent on tarnishing his hard-earned legacy. He vowed to pursue legal avenues to the fullest extent.\n\nWATCH HIM SPEAK BELOW;\n\nThis is coming after veteran filmmaker Kanayo O Kanayo shared details about Ason Rich and what he does in the industry.\n\nKOK, who called himself one of the protectors of Nollywood, noted that Ason Rich had barely produced up to five movies and had never acted in one before, and on such grounds, so he doesn’t qualify to be referred to as a film producer."
