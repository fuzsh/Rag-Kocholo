        "text": "Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, on Friday reaffirmed his love for his first child, Danielle, as the latter matriculated into university on Friday.\n\nThe actor took to his Instagram page to share pictures of himself, his wife, Mary, and the celebrant, whom he showered prayers on.\n\nSharing a picture of himself and his excited daughter, Edochie wrote, “She couldn’t hold back her excitement. She didn’t know I would turn up because I was out of Lagos when we spoke two days ago.\n\n“I had to put my work on hold and fly in for her matriculation. Family first. Big big achievement for my daughter.\n\n“Congratulations @danielleyuledochie on your matriculation. Daddy is super proud of you.\n\n“In our matriculation days (1998) they called us ‘jambites’. I don’t know what they call you guys now. Whatever it is, enjoy your day.”\n\nIn another post, he wrote, “Congratulations to my daughter @danielleyuledochie on your matriculation. Mummy @mayyuledochie and Daddy are super proud of you. The sky will be your starting point.\n\n“You shall be 10 times greater than your father and your grandfather. We love you.”\n\nYul, who is the last child of the Nollywood veteran, Pete Edochie, had in 2021 hailed his 16-year-old daughter for scoring 241 in the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations.\n\nThe actor followed in his father’s footsteps and made his debut in the movie industry a year after his marriage.\n\nIn their 17 years of marriage, Yul and his wife are blessed with four children: Danielle, Kambi, Karl, and Victory Edochie."
