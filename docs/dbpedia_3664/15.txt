In 2003 we conducted the first preliminary interviews and cut a fundraising trailer. And now just before the year 2008 closes and marks five years since we first began this journey, we are very excited to announce that the DVD for our documentary All God’s Children is now available for purchase HERE.

After weighing some options we’ve decided the quickest and most efficient way to get the film out for home viewing is via self-distribution with the help of the DVD sales site FilmBaby.com.

The current price per DVD is $19.99 + shipping and can be purchased from any country. It is for private home viewing only.

In 2009 we want to focus on organizing screenings and discussions. For anyone interested in copies to screen in public and for groups (Church, schools, community groups, etc.), please contact us via screenings@allgodschildrenthefilm.com.

Through the eyes of three families, All God’s Children tells the personal story of the first boarding school for children of missionaries to be investigated for abuse at the hands of the parents’ missionary colleagues. The survivors and parents share their journey of seeking justice, redemption and healing.
