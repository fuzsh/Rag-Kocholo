Writer-director and co-star Krasinski's imaginative fantasy is poignant and full of wonder. It's magical, giving off E.T. vibes, and Reynolds' Calvin is reminiscent of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, a quirky pessimist who's outwardly discouraging while secretly rooting for the kid to figure out the puzzle. And, like both E.T. and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, the curiosity-meets-melancholy score in IF is central to understanding that while Bea is acting tough, she's also facing something terrifying: the potential death of her father, only a few years after the loss of her mother. It's a lot, but the movie artfully avoids overplaying viewers' emotions. It also serves an important purpose, demonstrating how imagination isn't just a creative outlet, but also a powerful coping mechanism.

Bea's journey with the IFs is ultimately rewarding, even though—it has to be said—the beginning does drag a bit. But when IF hits its stride, it becomes a mind-bending, eye-popping, musical extravaganza that's truly unforgettable. (The movie is worth seeing for that bit alone.) Teens may think the imaginary friend story will be too babyish for them, but even they may be swayed by its sweetness. And for families of elementary school-aged kids and tweens, IF makes for a simply enchanting movie night.
