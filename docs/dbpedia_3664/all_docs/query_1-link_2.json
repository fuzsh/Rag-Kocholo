        "text": "Ondi Timoner is an internationally-acclaimed filmmaker whose work focuses on “impossible visionaries.” She has the rare distinction of winning the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance twice, for Dig! (2004) about the collision of art and commerce and We Live in Public (2009) about the loss of privacy online as predicted in a bunker in NY over the turn of the millennium. Both films were acquired by MoMA NY for its permanent collection. Since then, Ondi has created award-winning films/series such as Brand: A Second Coming about Russell Brand, Jungletown about an intentional community in remote Panama, Coming Clean about the opioid crisis, and Mapplethorpe, a film she also wrote and produced about Robert Mapplethorpe, starring Matt Smith (recommend the Director’s Cut on Hulu). Her latest film, Last Flight Home, about her father, Eli Timoner’s, extraordinary life & intentional death, premiered at Sundance 2022 and is out in theaters now!\n\nDavid Turner began his career as the founder of Film Canopy, a sustainability-themed content production company, where he managed the business, and wrote, directed, shot, and edited narrative and documentary content. His interests in environmental sustainability and storytelling led him to Panama in 2016, where he worked with Interloper films to support production of the VICELAND documentary series, Jungletown (2017). He transitioned full-time to Interloper Films in 2018, where as a producer he’s been responsible for the development and production of various documentary feature and series projects, including the recently released Coming Clean (2020) – a film about America’s opioid crisis, and Last Flight Home (2022) about director Ondi Timoner’s father, Eli Timoner’s, extraordinary life & intentional death, which premiered at Sundance 2022 and is out in theaters now."
