Richard Lee Boggs Sr., 66, passed away peacefully surrounded by loved ones on Jan. 19, 2023, at The Gathering Place Care Home in Uniontown, Pa.

Richard was born in Cleveland, on Aug. 3, 1956. He served his country in the U.S. Army and later went on to work in the mines. For the majority of his life, he worked for IBEW — Local Union 26 as a master electrician. His grin and love for bud light with tomato juice is how he will always be remembered.

Richard was preceded in death by his parents, Richard Boggs and Amanda Rowan Boggs.

He is survived by a sister, Donna Mayfield (Jerry); daughter, Amanda Karolcik (John); son, Richard “Buzzard” Boggs Jr. (Brandi); and his four grandchildren: Macie, Alex, Alivia and Ashton. Richard is also survived by Deborah Radabaugh Collins, to whom he was married for 28 years.

The family would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Richard’s caregivers: Mavis Eddy, Tracy, Michelle and Hospice. In lieu of flowers, donations can be made to “The Gathering Place” in Uniontown, Pa.

Family and friends are invited to gather at Fred Jenkins Funeral Home from 2-4 p.m. and 6-8 p.m. on Monday, Jan. 23, and again from 11 a.m. until the time of service at noon on Tuesday, Jan. 24. Richard will be laid to rest at Bethel Cemetery with full military honors.
