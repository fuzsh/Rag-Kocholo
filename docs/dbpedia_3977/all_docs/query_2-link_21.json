        "text": "The year was 1988 and three people appeared to be living the American dream. Richard Boggs was a Harvard-educated neurosurgeon who lived in a mansion in Glendale, California and was married to a beautiful woman with whom he had several children.\n\nMelvin Eugene Hanson and John Hawkins owned a chain of over 20 clothing stores named “Just Sweats” in Ohio. They were also living what seemed to be an affluent life, driving luxury cars and such.\n\nNevertheless, that year these three men conspired to commit murder and carried out a sophisticated plan which almost fooled the police.\n\nThe dead body\n\nAt 7:00 am on April 16, the Los Angeles Police Department received a call from the neurosurgeon’s clinic. A regular patient who had been coming to Dr. Boggs for electrocardiograms had died during a consultation. The doctor suspected that the cause of death was a heart attack — or so he told the police.\n\nAt 7:15 am, paramedics arrived along with the police and questioned Dr. Boggs. He explained that he had gone into his office to get something and when he returned he found the man on the floor. He then spent over 30 minutes trying to resuscitate him by performing CPR but was unsuccessful."
