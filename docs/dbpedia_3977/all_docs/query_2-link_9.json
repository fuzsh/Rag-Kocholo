        "text": "A man was executed in Virginia's electric chair Thursday night for the murder of an 87-year-old woman he had known all his life.\n\nThe murderer, Richard T. Boggs, 27, was led into the death chamber at the State Penitentiary in downtown Richmond and was given two 55-second surges of 2,500 volts each. He was pronounced dead at 11:07 P.M.\n\nMr. Boggs had been sentenced to death for killing Treeby M. Shaw, a neighbor in Portsmouth. After beating and stabbing her on Jan. 25, 1984, he took rings from her fingers and stole the family silver. He later told the police that he had needed money to buy drugs.\n\nAll day Thursday, lawyers for Mr. Boggs pursued appeals, arguing that the electric chair at the prison here might malfunction as one did in Florida recently and that this would amount to cruel and unusual punishment of Mr. Boggs. They also argued that tests conducted last week showed that Mr. Boggs had suffered brain damage from fetal alcohol syndrome and was unable to control his impulses.\n\nFederal District Judge Richard L. Williams turned down Mr. Boggs's request for a stay of execution Thursday morning, and a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld the ruling late in the afternoon.\n\nThe United States Supreme Court then also denied a stay by a vote of 7 to 2. The dissenters were Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall, who oppose the death penalty in all cases.\n\nMr. Boggs's execution was the first in the six-month-old administration of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder. The Governor, a Democrat who once opposed the death penalty, had successfully pushed for expansion of the crimes covered by the state's capital punishment law.\n\nThe execution was the ninth since Virginia reinstituted the death penalty in 1977 and the 135th nationwide since the Supreme Court allowed states to resume executions in 1976.\n\nMr. Boggs's lawyer, David Bruck, had argued that Virginia's electric chair was virtually identical to one in Florida that had to be switched on three times for an execution in May before the prisoner was pronounced dead."
