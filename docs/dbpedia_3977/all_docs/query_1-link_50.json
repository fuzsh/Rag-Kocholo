        "text": "MARIA LOUISE BODILY ANDERSON\n\nAge 27\n\nOctober 8, 1994\n\nEvanston, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nLouise was brutally beaten to death by her boyfriend’s brother, Dennis Marshall, age 26, who was living with Louise, her boyfriend, and her two children.\n\n​\n\nMarshall beat Louise, a nurse’s aide, in a hotel room with his hands, feet, and a chair. Maria died of multiple blunt force blows to her entire body, with the fatal blow breaking her neck. The autopsy report found evidence of former beatings. Maria Louise, whom the family calls Louise, was five weeks pregnant at the time of her death.\n\nLouise was adopted into the Bodily family when she was four days old. As a toddler she had thick long blonde hair. She was very active and a daredevil. When she was four she could shinny up the biggest maple tree and ride a two-wheel bicycle. One of Louise’s loves was to go fishing with her dad, she would say to her dad, “Daddy, you can catch the most but I’m going to catch the biggest”, and she almost always did. At six years old she could put together adult jigsaw puzzles with uncanny ease. As she grew older and graduated from high school, she moved to Evanston and while there her father died of a heart attack. Louise was very close to her father and she was devastated. She left her first marriage when she met Alfred James Marshall. She had two children with him and lived with Alfred for eight years before Dennis moved in with them. Dennis Marshall pled guilty to second-degree murder.\n\nLouise’s mother, Dorotha Jeanne Bodily writes: “Louise...you were selected, not expected, and I thank God every day that I was picked to be your mother. I love you with all my heart.”\n\nDennis Marshall was sentenced on June 29, 1995 to 25-35 years for second-degree murder. He was released on parole June 20, 2012 and will be discharged around 2019.\n\n​​KIMBERLY ANN APPLE\n\nAge 48\n\nMay 17, 2021\n\nTorrington, Wyoming\n\n​​\n\n​\n\nThe night of May 16, 2021 into the morning of the 17th, Marty Colwell stole the life of Kimberly Ann Apple. Kim was 48 years old when she was taken away ever so aggressively from her three kids.\n\nOn the day of the 17th, Kim's body was found stripped down in the house they briefly shared outside Torrington, WY. She passed away from internal and external bleeding caused by Colwell. One major injury she suffered from was a large gash on her head. Cowell attempted to glue shut the wound rather than call for help. The family is not only left with extreme despair but also many questions that will never be answered due to the fact \"he can't remember\".\n\nKim was born in July of 1972, she had many different accomplishments throughout her life from finishing college at EWC to becoming a loving grandma. She had a rough past for a very long time but Kim managed to find comfort in a variety of things. From fishing at the Glendo lake during any free time to bowling or shooting a game of pool. She will be deeply missed by everyone blessed with memories of her.\n\nSubmitted by Kim’s son, Cody Johnson.\n\nThe district attorney made a deal with Colwell to plead guilty to Manslaughter. On July 5, 2022 in the Goshen County courtroom he was sentenced to serve 8-14 years.\n\nSHERRY BARELA\n\nAge 21\n\nOctober 20, 1994\n\nAlbany County\n\n​\n\nSherry was stabbed with a screwdriver bit in her temple by her husband, Stephen Richard Barela. Barela then kidnapped the children and took them from the state.\n\n“My daughter was only 21 when Steve Barela took her life. She died instantly, but the children witnessed her death! Raymond was 18 months, and Crystal, three years.\n\nSherry was a loving and caring person. She would give you her last dollar or the shirt off her back, if you needed it. Her killer robbed us of the chance to be with her and enjoy her company, her smile, and her offbeat sense of humor. She loved to dance and made a good living doing it.”\n\nSubmitted by Sherry’s mother, Barbara Yarusinsky\n\nSteve Barella pled guilty to second-degree murder and two counts of kidnapping. He was sentenced on April 21, 1995, to 28 years to life; he’s currently at the Wyoming Honor Conservation Camp in Newcastle, WY.\n\nLEYSA MICHELLE BERNAL\n\nAge 21\n\nMay 29, 1999\n\nGreen River, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nLeysa was born November 27, 1977. On Saturday, May 29, 1999, Leysa was shot twice in the face by her ex- boyfriend, Lawrence “Duke” Howard at the home of her mother Chris Bernal, who was present along with her sister Crista and Leysa’s son, Michael.\n\nSix weeks earlier, their 10-month-old son’s leg was broken as Duke was physically attacking Leysa. Leysa did everything right with an Order of Protection for her son and herself.\n\nShe is our “ANGEL FOR ETERNITY” and loved and missed by her son, mom, dad, brother, three sisters, two grandmothers, and all of her family and friends.\n\n​\n\n“Looking at little Michael really bothers us because he has no parents and two young lives were wasted for no reason.”\n\nSubmitted by Leysa’s mother, Chris Bernal\n\nDuke Howard received a 52 year to life sentence in the Wyoming State Penitentiary as a plea agreement for second-degree murder. In November 2000, Duke Howard committed suicide at the state prison and was buried on Leysa’s birthday.\n\nCLAUDIA JEAN BILLS\n\nAge 48\n\nJune 12, 1993\n\nLaramie, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nClaudia was in bed when she was shot three times by her husband, David, who then committed suicide.\n\nClaudia Jean Cornia Bills was the oldest child of a mechanic and a drug store clerk. Though she grew up on the “wrong side” of Evanston, she still managed to be one of the leaders of her class, being voted “Most Likely to Succeed.” Claudia married during her junior year of college and had to quit going to college while her husband finished school. They eventually moved back to her hometown where David was a teacher and city councilman. Over the years she bore five daughters. Each had a very unique relationship with their mother, loving and admiring her in different ways.\n\nShe set an example with her deep desire to improve herself and the world around her. She attended night classes and was the first person in Evanston’s outreach program of Western Wyoming Community College to achieve her Associate of Arts degree. She served as her political party’s chairperson, and was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, attending whenever her husband allowed her. He resented all things that took her attention from him and fought her bitterly with emotional abuse.\n\nThrough all of this, Claudia still found time to be a wife, mother, grandmother, daughter, and friend. At the time of her death, she and her husband were attending the University of Wyoming. She left behind her daughters, parents, five grandchildren, two son-in-laws, and countless friends.\n\nHer memory stands as a witness to strength of personality in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nSubmitted by Claudia’s daughter, Heather B. Taylor\n\nLAURA BOSSA\n\nAge 20\n\nJuly 20, 1994\n\nGreen River, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nLaura was nursing her 19 day-old infant daughter, when she saw her husband, Grant, was pointing a gun at her. She quickly bent over to protect their child and was shot in the top of her head.\n\nLaura Kate Sporich was born in Mesa, Arizona. The oldest of six children, she was like a second mother to her younger sisters and brother, always the protector and peacemaker. She loved animals, the outdoors, camping, fishing, and hiking. She was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. She was an accomplished violinist, who participated in many talent shows, road shows, and dance festivals. She loved flying and was a member of the Air Force R.O.T.C. She was a beautiful, tall young lady with a positive outlook on life.\n\nWhen Laura was 15 she met Grant Bossa, who was 24. He coerced her into running away with him and she became pregnant with their first child. When they were married, he was four hours late for the wedding. He moved Laura to Tucson to separate her from her family, and would not allow her to have a phone or the use of a car. He frequently attacked her religious beliefs. He lied to her to get her to move to Green River. As time went by, Laura re-established herself in the church. This angered Grant and he became progressively more violent, becoming physically and verbally abusive when she was pregnant with their second child. He was arrested for assault, but each time she tried to leave him, he threatened to take her child. When she was pregnant again, there were many incidents of abuse, and Laura obtained a protection order from the court because she feared for her life.\n\n“We as Laura’s family hope and pray that her death will stand as a silent witness so that women everywhere will someday never have to be afraid of being beaten or murdered by their spouse.”\n\nSubmitted by Laura’s mother, Melanie H. Sporich\n\nGrant Bossa was convicted of second-degree murder and sentenced on February 7, 1995 to 25 to 30 years. He was released on parole June 6, 2012 and will be discharged around 2016.\n\nDAWNITA ELIZABETH EVANS BRANDON\n\nAge 32\n\nJuly 30, 2007\n\nRock Springs, Wyoming\n\nDawnita was brutally murdered from stab wounds inflicted on her by her husband, she was 32.\n\nDawnita was born November 30, 1974, in Lawrence Kansas.

Berry’s contagious spirit, upbeat attitude, wit, work ethic, sociability, plus a generous sprinkling of human frailties, endeared her to faculty and students alike as she enthusiastically began her brief college life. Family and friends feel deprived of a very special person with potential to spare.\n\nSubmitted by Berry’s mother, Sharon Bryant\n\nLevi Collen pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault, one count of aggravated kidnapping, and one count of first-degree murder.

Together they enjoyed cross-country skiing, trips to parks and museums, fishing, and traveling. Shortly after Ann’s death, the children moved to Iowa to live with Ann’s parents, Harold and Bonnie Hoversten.\n\nHer mother, five sisters (Lyn, Jan, Amy, Rosemary, and Elaine) and her brother John all miss Ann deeply.\n\nSubmitted by Ann’s mother, Bonnie Hoversten\n\nDouglas Caudle accepted a plea bargain of voluntary manslaughter and no trial was held.

A month after her death he went out into the prairie close to their home to go hiking to relieve his aching heart when he thought he heard Jamie calling to him. He turned, walking toward her voice a few steps and looked down to find a perfect arrowhead. Then he thought he heard her again and turned to see a small group of white flowers in the shape of a cross. He felt then that Jamie was with God and knew that she was ok.\n\nThere is an empty space in everyone’s heart that knew and loved Jamie, for she was and always will be their Angel.\n\nSubmitted by Jamie’s mother Debbie Ciminelli\n\nIn 2008 Roman was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Daniel William then shot her in the head with a 9 mm. semiautomatic pistol and then committed suicide.\n\nKathleen could outwork most people, women and men. She was raised on a ranch 28 miles from town, with no electricity or running water. She drove a snow machine for six miles to get to the school bus, repeating that trip at night. Kathleen was an excellent horsewoman, gourmet cook, and hunting guide and packer. She had worked in the Trona mines and as a flagger on construction jobs, as a roughneck on oil rigs, and as a cocktail waitress and bartender. She started her own business in 1991 – The Sublette Stage, a taxi/shuttle service.\n\nKathy had four beautiful children: Kimberly, Brian, and twins Tracy and Daniel. She was a special mother. There was no television in the house. She chose to do things with her children. She had such a philosophy of life that everyone loved her. Everyone’s life that she touched came away richer for having known her.\n\nIn spite of the beating and gunshot wound, she still had a faint heartbeat when the emergency personnel arrived. She was a fighter and her will to live and love and zest for life were hard to stop. Kathy’s family, her mother, father, sister, brother, children, many aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces and nephews, have lost a precious part of their lives.\n\nSubmitted by Kathy’s mother, Marilyn David\n\nLIANA MAE DAVIDSON\n\nAge 22\n\nAugust 10, 1996\n\nGreen River, Wyoming\n\n*Erik Robert Duke also killed*\n\nLiana Mae Davidson married Bob Duke in 1991 and they had a son Erik Robert Duke born August 8, 1991.

It originally was declared to be an accident.\n\nSubmitted by Liana’s parents, Larry and Rose Davidson\n\nWhen it was brought out later that Bob was suspected of plotting to kill his parents, the case was reopened. It took six years for the grand jury to determine if there was enough evidence to bring him to trial.

He is in federal custody, currently in Jonesville, VA.\n\nBRENDA LEE DAVILA\n\nAge 22\n\nNovember 5, 2007\n\nLovell, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nNovember 5, 2007 was a very dark day for our family when our daughter Brenda Lee was murdered by her husband. She was only 22 years old.\n\nBrenda was a good person, sister and friend who was always happy with a great big smile on her face and you could never tell if she was unhappy or sad or had a problem because she was such a happy person. She was there for anyone who needed a friend. She was my daughter and my best friend, on that day I lost a piece of my heart that can’t be found until we meet again and are reunited as a family.\n\nBrenda was a sweet, lovely and beautiful young lady with her whole life ahead of her. She was very intelligent. Her two young children meant the world to her. She had lots of friends and family that are going to miss her very much. We will always love Brenda and miss her lots.\n\nOn Sunday she wrote: There is no way to rewind time…make the best of the choices you make for all you know they will be the best choices of your life.\n\nBrenda was shot by her husband Steven Lopez who then shot himself.\n\nSubmitted by Brenda’s parents Rodolfo and Martha Davila, daughter Alyana Kristina Lopez, son Steven Daniel Lopez Jr. and family.\n\nANNA DAVIS\n\nAge 21\n\nJune 27, 2014\n\nCasper, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nAnna lived in Georgia for her whole life until April 2014, when she moved to Casper to be with her boyfriend that had relocated there also. Our lives will forever be changed by the horrible way our Anna died. She was fatally shot by Nick Morgan and then he took his own life.\n\nAnna’s big brown eyes and her joyful smile will forever be in our hearts. Her heart was full of forgiving not matter what one had done to her. Her journey to Casper will never make any sense to us, but this is what she wanted and as a family we stood behind her, not knowing of how this would end.\n\nMay her light always shine bright and give us some kind of peace through this terrible tragedy. She will always remain in our hearts, thoughts, and minds; because Anna made that kind of impression on anyone she met.\n\nSubmitted by Nana (Brenda Davis), Aunt Michelle, and sisters Kayla and Brittney Davis.\n\nKELLY JEAN DAVISON\n\nAge 33\n\nOctober 6, 2009\n\nKemmerer, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nOn October 6, 2009 our lives were changed forever. Our youngest daughter, Kelly Jean Davison was murdered in her home in Loveland, CO by her husband; she was 33 years old and pregnant with her second child.\n\nFrom the time Kelly was born, she brought happiness and joy to our family, she was vivacious, entertaining and had a great sense of humor. Kelly loved life and lived it to the fullest; she was beautiful and devoted her life to others. Kelly worked with handicapped adults as a social worker. She was a great advocate for them and their rights and would fight anyone that didn’t treat them with respect. She believed everyone was a child of God. All of the clients loved her, she used to say “not everyone can go to work and feel like a rock star,” but she did, because everyone was happy to see her. Kelly was like a ray of sunshine and when she entered a room, it lit up. Her greatest joy was her three-year-old son Christopher; she loved being a mom and enjoyed every minute with him.\n\nKelly had two sisters and one brother and everyone loved her so much. The void in our lives will be here forever, a large hole that will never be filled and the pain is too great to bare.\n\nWe love you Kelly and miss you so much.

Colette, a seamstress, was found dead from a gunshot wound, in her home.\n\nRonald Allen Crosby also shot and killed Chris Tramboli in Colette’s home. Ronald was not charged with these crimes because he later committed suicide.\n\nColette was an adorable person. She is very deeply and sadly missed by her family (Mom, Dad, Clark, Grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins) and friends. All of us feel emptiness in our daily lives without her. As her mom, I also feel that I failed Colette in some tragic ways, and I know each of us in her family believe we could somehow have prevented this tragedy; yet, in all probability, we could not.\n\nColette was taken from us by a drug-addicted, incompetent, sociopath when she was trying to get away from him with the help of her good friend Chris Tramboli. I remember in my last conversation with Colette, just days before she was taken from us, when I asked her if she was all right, or if she wanted me to come to Cody to get her and bring her home with me. She said, “No Mom – don’t worry. I’m fine.” And, now, in a special place within me where Colette still lives, I have to believe she is really “fine.”\n\nSubmitted by Colette’s mother, Charlotte Ware Magee\n\nVICTORIA ELIZABETH JUAREZ\n\nAge 21\n\nJune 26, 2017\n\nCheyenne, WY\n\n​\n\n​\n\nHello, my name is Victoria Elizabeth Juarez and this is my story of my life.\n\nI was born in Denver Colorado on July 16, 1995. I started working at Los Abuelos at the age of 19 as the hostess, server (this is where I met my killer.) I also worked at Cheyenne Health Care Center as a kitchen aid and was in Climb Wyoming. The day I found out I was pregnant, I was so happy - my life changed.\n\n​\n\nI loved to feel my baby growing inside of me as the months went on. My baby boy Victor was born 12-19-14. I would take him everywhere I went - Burger King, swimming, to the park, on walks to friend’s houses, to my Auntie’s and Uncle’s house, shopping at Wal-Mart and to Climb Wyoming.\n\nWe loved to draw, color, ride bikes, watch spooky movies, shop, fish, camp, cook, make string tie key chains & crosses, play games on my phone, Xbox with Big Baby Brother, having races with my Dad to see who could catch more fish, and going to church. I loved being a mama – hugging, wrestling and kissing my son.\n\nEverywhere my mom and I went we held hands going into the stores. Everywhere we went I was Mom’s baby girl.\n\nJune 26, 2017 was a sad day for my family and baby son Victor – changed their life forever!! My mom woke me up to get ready for the first day at LCCC. I got dressed, kissed Victor good-bye, told my Dad “I will see you later” and closed the door. This was the day my life ended.\n\nI was brutally murdered, cut, strangled, and hit in the back of the head. I fought back. I guess it did not help because I’m not here to see my son Victor grow up. The killer took off in my Durango and left me to die in the basement where he lived and worked.\n\nOn July 5, 2017 before my funeral, my Mom got a call and they told her they picked the kill up on HWY 80 and Campstool. The killer lied to the WHP about his name – he had my driver license with him.\n\nSubmitted by Victoria’s mother, Elizabeth\n\n​\n\nThe killer was sentenced January 19, 2018 to 50 years to life.\n\nDUSTY MCGOWAN\n\nAge 22\n\nMay 2, 2004\n\nWeston County\n\n​\n\nDusty was in poor health because of kidney disease most of her life. She had a kidney transplant when she was 12. By the time she was about 16 the new kidney had failed and she was back on dialysis. For the next 6 years she was unhappy, depressed young girl. By the time she got involved with Loren Lapointe, she was very mixed up and confused.\n\nHe wanted her to cut all ties with her family, even to the point of moving from South Dakota to Wyoming and not telling any of us where she was. In March of 2004, I got a call from the chaplain at the hospital in Rapid City, SD. She told me that Dusty had to have open heart surgery to replace a heart valve and nobody was going to be with her. Loren had been banned from the hospital because of trouble he had caused. She wanted to know if I could come. Of course I did come. In the few days following the surgery, I tried to talk to her about getting away from Loren. She said “Grandma, everybody else has always been afraid of being with me because they think I’m going to die.” So, she let him control her. Her mother told me that Dusty was trying to leave him the day she died. That was only about 5 or 6 weeks after her surgery. She hadn’t had time to heal yet.\n\n​\n\nLoren killed Dusty by hitting her with his car and dragged/pushed her into the mobile home next door to them.\n\nI hope this story helps someone else who is in a similar situation. Maybe it will give them the courage to get away from that person.\n\nNATALIE LYNN MILLER\n\nAge 34\n\nMarch 27, 2013\n\nCasper, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nNatalie was murdered by her husband in an evil and violent act. Tom fired his gun seven times and five of those bullets struck Natalie as she was running to get away from him. Natalie’s mother and two children were in the house when Tom gunned her down. He then showed the gun to Natalie’s mother and threatened “you’re next”.\n\n​\n\nThe signs were there from the beginning. This was not the first time that Tom had threatened Natalie with a gun. If you know someone who is experiencing domestic violence, it is imperative to get involved and provide support, resources, and options for the victim. Had the police been called on all the times that Tom had previously threatened her, she might be alive today and her kids wouldn’t be without a mom. Natalie’s mom was there for her last breath, wishing she could have done more to save her. Families should never have to go through this.\n\n​\n\nIf someone threatens you with a gun, even once, take it seriously and get help. Don’t ignore the signs or minimize them or even slowly plan your get away. It might be too late.\n\n​\n\nNatalie worked at the Wyoming Medical Center as a professional CT and Radiologic Technologist and was attending classes to earn her Doctorate of Pharmacy degree.\n\n​\n\nNatalie was a caring, nurturing, and loving mother. Her beautiful children were the love of her life. Her greatest joy was spending time with them dancing, swimming, and roller skating. Natalie had a smile that would light up a room. She was a great gift to this world and everyone. She affected so many lives in a positive way.\n\n​\n\nLoving daughter, sister, mother, and friend. Compassionate, devoted to career, community and family. Natalie will be remembered by all who loved her.\n\nSubmitted by Natalie’s mother, Debra Boggs, and father and step-mother, Larry and Cheryl Brown\n\nThomas was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to sixty years for killing Natalie and eight years for threatening to kill her mother.\n\nDEBRA A. MOTT\n\nAge 40\n\nOctober 9, 1997\n\nPoint of Rocks, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nDebra Mott was stabbed many times by her husband John Reinhold in their residence at Point of Rocks, Wyoming.\n\nDebbie was a great person. She loved people and was always ready to listen to you and to tell you stories that had happened to her. She always made you feel important and she would try to help you in any way she could. If you ever needed someone to talk to, she was there to listen. Everybody who ever met her was moved by her. She made a lasting impression on their lives. She always lived life to the fullest. She never had a bad thing to say about anyone.\n\nJohn Reinhold pled guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced on July 6, 1998, to 25 to 35 years. John was released to parole on June 16, 2014.\n\nWHITNEY NICOLE\n\nAge 29\n\nDecember 16, 2019\n\nRock Springs, Wyoming\n\n​\n\nIn the early morning hours of December 16th, 2019, Hunter Sewell maliciously took his wife Whitney’s life along with their unborn child’s. He instilled fear in her by chasing her throughout their home and shooting four random shots at her. After terrorizing her, he cornered her in their kitchen and shot her twice, point-blank in the head. Being the coward he was, he later took his own life using the same gun he killed Whitney with.\n\nWhitney Nicole was born January 27, 1990, in Rock Springs, Wyoming. Whitney was an outgoing, goal-oriented, fun-loving woman who loved her family and friends very much. There is not a photograph of her that does not capture her beautiful smile, sparkly eyes, and zest for life. Whitney truly loved life and lived each day to the fullest. She never forgot a birthday or holiday and made sure that everyone was in on the celebration. Whitney’s genuine heart and caring soul made her who she was, a true gem!\n\nWhitney’s untimely death devastated many people in her life and community. She touched the lives of many during her short time with us. Her death left everyone wondering, how could the man that proclaimed his love for her, the man who vowed to love her forever, carry out such an unimaginable act of violence?\n\nWhitney’s story of abuse was her own, but unfortunately, it was like that of others. It left family and friends to ponder what happened; how did it go so wrong? The evident and outward signs of abuse were not there. There were no bruises to been seen or calls to be rescued. Hunter used silent tactics to control Whitney. Behind closed doors, he would degrade and belittle her. Making derogatory remarks. He was jealous of the internal happiness Whitney had created. Happiness that she refused to let him destroy. His insecurities allowed him to control Whitney with their finances. How did it go from control to murder?\n\nWere there signs that were missed? For families and friends, there are so many questions that have been left unanswered. The overwhelming sense of guilt and emptiness that this tragedy has created left them asking if the signs were there, could they have done something differently to prevent such a tragedy. In an instant, his actions forever changed the lives of many.\n\nOne thing is certain; not one of Whitney’s loved ones will ever stop talking about the beautiful life she lived. It is through her tragedy that family and friends hope to break the silence against domestic violence. They believe that no one should suffer the way Whitney did.\n\nWhitney Nicole, you are my beautiful angel. Your spirit, love, and energy continue to be felt by so many people. I love and miss you more than words can say! I know you are taking such great care of our precious grandbaby. I will see you again one day! What a glorious day that will be!\n\nSubmitted by Whitney’s mother, Nicole Halstead\n\nGABBY PETITO\n\nAge 22\n\nAugust 27, 2021\n\nTeton County\n\n​\n\nGabby was born March 19, 1999. On August 27, 2021, Gabby was strangled to death by her fiancé Brian Laundrie while on a road trip visiting national parks across the country. At just 22 years old, her life abruptly ended at the hands of the man she trusted, loved and thought she would spend her life with, but she had so much life left to live. Her killer then proceeded to head home to his parents house in Florida where they had all lived under one roof. He drove Gabby’s van the entire way, while texting Gabby’s phone, and texting her mom to make it seem like Gabby was alive and well. Gabby was reported missing on September 11th . Brian was found dead on October 21, 2021, by “apparent suicide” in the Myakkahatchee Park just a few miles from their home.\n\nGabby’s story made national headlines as the world looked for her, hoping and praying she was still alive. After Gabby’s remains were found on September 19th, 2021 at Spread Creek near Bridger-Teton National Forest, her father Joseph made a powerful statement, “She touched the world,” this was the moment we realized we needed to turn our tragedy into purpose. Gabby Petito Foundation, founded in response to a domestic violence tragedy, works with organizations that support victims of domestic violence and organizations that support locating missing persons. Gabby’s life may have been cut tragically short, but she lives on through us, her parents, fighting for victims of domestic violence, and to create change to prevent this from happening time and time again. Her story has inspired people around the world, and we hope her legacy will continue to help others be free from the dangers of intimate partner violence.\n\nGabby was a free spirit who loved travel, art and nature. She was just starting her life as a vanlife travel vlogger and was so full of joy. She created a YouTube channel called Nomadic Statik where she posted clips of her travels. Her smile could fill a room, she loved Star Wars, music, healthy food, and her artistic ability would amaze us as she sat for hours creating masterpieces. Gabby was an amazing big sister, the oldest of six, three brothers and two sisters, they looked up to her and adored her. The tragic loss of our daughter has shattered our family.

This same child was in the room when his mother was shot.\n\nSaundra was a native of Charleston, South Carolina, who followed her husband to his military duty station in Wyoming.
