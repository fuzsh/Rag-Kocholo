        "text": "NPR uncovered secret execution tapes from Virginia. More remain hidden\n\nNPR uncovered secret execution tapes from Virginia. More remain hidden\n\nNPR uncovered secret execution tapes from Virginia. More remain hidden\n\nNPR uncovered secret execution tapes from Virginia. More remain hidden\n\nOn a summer's day in 2006, inside an apartment not far from Virginia's old death chamber, an 82-year-old man handed over a briefcase to an archivist. The bag held four execution recordings so rare, similar tapes from another state had been released just once before in history.\n\nWhen executions take place, only a few people are permitted to attend as witnesses. Since prisons forbid even those journalists, lawyers and family members from recording audio or images, virtually no physical evidence from their vantage point exists from any state. But they're not the only ones watching. Prison employees also see what happens in the death chamber – and they sometimes tape it.\n\nThe cassettes in the briefcase were recorded by staff, and the donor, R. M. Oliver, had worked in Virginia prisons for years. But how that government audio ended up in his bag — and why he privately donated it to the Library of Virginia — is a mystery. Oliver left his last position with the Department of Corrections in Richmond before any of the executions were taped. His family said he took the story to his grave when he died.\n\n\"Dad kept it a secret from us,\" said his son, Stephen Oliver. \"I don't even remember seeing that briefcase.\"\n\nThe tapes from Oliver's bag remained unavailable for 16 years. The library initially restricted them and planned to keep them off limits for decades more. But NPR argued for their public release and obtained the audio in 2022.\n\nAn NPR investigation can now reveal the tapes show the prison neglected to record key evidence during what was considered one of Virginia's worst executions, and staff appeared unprepared for some of the jobs they were tasked to do in the death chamber.\n\nBefore Virginia abolished capital punishment in 2021, the state executed more people than any other in America. This is the first time audio recorded during any of those executions has ever been published.\n\nBehind the scenes: \"We didn't know for sure\"\n\nMinutes before he was scheduled to die by the electric chair, Alton Waye used his last words to forgive the workers who would soon have to help kill him.\n\n\"I'd like to express that what is about to occur here is a murder,\" he starts by saying on the tape.\n\nAn employee whispers the rest of Waye's statement into the recorder: \"And that he forgives the people involved in this murder. And that I don't hate nobody and that I love them.\"\n\nThat worker then checked in with another colleague to see if he had heard the statement correctly. He hadn't.\n\n\"I'm trying to get it,\" the second man responds. \"I would like to express that what is about to take place here is a murder. Did anyone else catch the rest of that?\"\n\nThe prison eventually got Waye's words down right. But the other tapes show uncertainty was common in the death chamber. At the beginning of the narration of Richard Whitley's execution in 1987, the staff seemed confused about how they were supposed to record the event.\n\n\"We're not using a blank tape?\" one worker asks, before a second wonders out loud if the recorder was turned on.\n\nThe prison staff seemed still more unprepared during the electrocution of Richard Boggs. For more than two minutes, staff can be heard on the tape appearing to struggle to connect a call from one of the only people with the power to cancel an execution at the last moment.\n\n\"We need to get 306 clear, the governor's office is calling,\" a worker says.\n\nThe situation was urgent.\n\n\"Debbie, they are strapping him in the chair!\" a second woman exclaims. \"Hold on a minute.\"\n\nIf the governor wanted to save Boggs' life, he would need to be connected with someone in the death chamber quickly. Minutes passed, however, and the issue appeared unresolved. A third employee predicted they would have to cut Debbie off in order to connect the governor.\n\n\"Let me call Switchboard and see what's going on,\" one of the workers interjects, before a line appears to go dead.\n\nBoggs was eventually executed. The governor, L. Douglas Wilder, had not called to spare him. But if Wilder had felt differently – and had the staff not been able to connect him in time – Virginia could have come close to carrying out the execution of a pardoned man.\n\n\"We didn't know for sure whether you had contact down there with the governor's office,\" one of the workers reiterates on the tape.\n\nThe fourth and final recording revealed a more serious oversight.\n\nBloody evidence, hidden on record\n\nLocal reporters who watched the execution of Wilbert Lee Evans in 1990 said they witnessed one of the worst in Virginia's history. Three journalists wrote in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that, following the administration of the first jolt of electricity from the chair, Evans started to bleed from his eyes, mouth and nose.\n\n\"Blood flowed from under the leather death mask,\" observed a journalist from the Virginian-Pilot.\n\nA reporter from a third newspaper, the Alexandria Journal, said something similar.\n\n\"He started bubbling blood,\" Geoff Brown observed, \"and it ran down his belly and his shirt.\"\n\nBut the tape the prison created during Evans' execution recorded none of those details.\n\n\"It is 11:04, the first surge of electricity has been administered,\" an employee states.\n\nIt was right after that first jolt that reporters said the blood started streaming down Evans' chin and soaking his shirt. The voice of the narrator can be heard breaking on tape. But if she was affected by the scene, she didn't clarify the reason. She never mentioned any evidence of blood.\n\n\"It is 11, 11:05,\" she stutters. \"The second surge of electricity has been administered.\"\n\nThen, minutes later, just: \"The inmate has expired.\"\n\n\"What is the state trying to cover up?\"\n\nNone of the 27 states that currently allow the death penalty use the chair as their primary method of execution anymore. Most have switched to lethal injection. But mistakes in the death chamber are still common.\n\nIn 2022, more than a third of the 20 executions that were attempted across the country were botched. The governor of Tennessee called off an execution after he learned staff had failed to test the chemicals they were planning on using for contamination. Workers in Texas struggled for more than half an hour to place an IV into a disabled man's neck.\n\nOfficial cover ups after the executions go wrong are also not unusual. Behind closed doors, on July 28, 2022, execution workers in Alabama took more than three hours to set an IV line into Joe James, Jr.'s body. The state said nothing out of the ordinary happened during that time. But a nonprofit, Reprieve, obtained permission from his family to conduct an autopsy afterwards. It revealed multiple puncture wounds, bruises, and evidence that the state may have cut into his skin to find a vein, said Blaire Andres, who leads death penalty projects for Reprieve.\n\n\"All of that was hidden from view from the journalists that were supposed to witness the execution,\" said Andres. \"If the state is doing everything correctly, they shouldn't have anything to hide. So it does raise the question, what is the state trying to cover up?\"\n\nThe Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to NPR's request for comment. The same question now remains open in Virginia, too. Though the library eventually released the tapes Oliver donated, NPR discovered the Department of Corrections has more audio that it's still choosing to keep hidden from the public.\n\nAfter NPR requested all remaining execution audio from the agency under the Freedom of Information Act, Corrections confirmed it has at least six additional audio files with 70 minutes of tape recorded on them. But it refused to share the tapes. It also declined an interview request.\n\nIn an email, a representative from the agency defended the decision to keep the audio concealed. Because the tapes are private prison records, private health records and contain confidential personnel information, the agency does not have to share them, the representative wrote.\n\nAn attorney who teaches at the University of Virginia's law school, Ian Kalish, reviewed the email. He said Corrections seemed to be acting in a manner contrary to the intention of the state's public records law, which was designed to grant people access to government files.\n\n\"These types of records are really key to facilitating public oversight and holding public bodies and government actors accountable,\" Kalish said. \"It's very concerning to me that this type of information is being withheld.\"\n\nAs long as Corrections refuses to reveal the rest of the execution audio, Oliver's tapes could be the only existing content from inside Virginia's death chamber that people can hear. Together with the 19 execution tapes from Georgia that an attorney subpoenaed during a court case, the two sets are the only pieces of publicly available audio evidence from the more than 1,500 executions that have taken place across the U.S. during the past 50 years.\n\nWhether Oliver knew how significant the four tapes would be when he gave them away is unclear. But Roger Christman, the archivist who collected the briefcase from Oliver's apartment back in 2006, thinks he may have had an idea.\n\n\"He was really happy that he could find a home for these records,\" Christman remembered. \"He thought they were very important.\"\n\nBarrie Hardymon edited this story. Monika Evstatieva produced it. Barbara Van Woerkom contributed research.\n\nAudio transcript\n\nAILSA CHANG, HOST:\n\nWhen legal executions are carried out in the U.S., the few members of the public who are allowed to attend are forbidden to tape or photograph what they witness. But NPR investigative reporter Chiara Eisner obtained audio that was taped behind the scenes during four executions from the point of view of prison staff. Just a warning - we're going to play some of that audio from those executions, which some listeners might find disturbing.\n\nCHIARA EISNER, BYLINE: Thirty-five years ago in Virginia, just minutes before a man was scheduled to die by electrocution, employees at the prison started taping what they were seeing. What you're about to hear next are moments drawn from that tape.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: Have you got the recorder on?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #2: Yes, it's on. Go.\n\nEISNER: This is the first time any part of that audio has been played for the public.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #1: The inmate is being removed from his cell, being led to the chamber. The inmate is now strapped into the chair. The first charge has been applied.\n\nEISNER: These kinds of recordings are typically closely guarded by the government. I didn't get these from the prison, though. I found them in the Library of Virginia. But even there, the records have been kept hidden for more than a decade. Roger Christman is one of the state archivists.\n\nROGER CHRISTMAN: So we have erroneously restricted them.\n\nEISNER: So the tapes were restricted until I asked for them.\n\nCHRISTMAN: Essentially, yes. We were following the 50-year guideline that the Department of Corrections had put on the earlier execution files we had here.\n\nEISNER: There's a law in Virginia that says the Department of Corrections can restrict files about executions for 50 years after the prisoner dies. The library originally thought that law applied to them, too. After I argued that law shouldn't apply, the archivists gave me the tapes. But the story of how the audio arrived at the library in the first place really starts in the house of an 82-year-old man named R.M. Oliver.\n\nCHRISTMAN: As I recall, he contacted us and said he had some Department of Corrections material, and could we come and take a look at it.\n\nEISNER: Interesting - so y'all went to his house to pick up the files.\n\nCHRISTMAN: We went to his house. And when we got there, he brought out this nice, brown suitcase, essentially, and said, this is what I have to donate.\n\nEISNER: Oliver said he felt the tapes were important when he donated them in 2006. And he was right. Not only do they explain step by step how executions were carried out in Virginia, they provide a rare glimpse into the relationships between the prisoners and the workers who are executing them. Alton Waye's last words were captured on this tape just minutes before he was executed.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nALTON WAYE: I would like to express...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #3: I'd like to express what is about to be taken here is a murder. Did you get that?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Yeah. I'm trying to get it. I would like to express that what is about to take place here is a murder, and something about he doesn't hold that against anyone. And he loves everyone.\n\nEISNER: What Waye actually said was that he forgave everyone who was involved with his murder.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Key placed in proper position. Warden nod. Execution is taking place.\n\nEISNER: How had records this important ended up outside prison walls, in somebody's briefcase? Roger said he had asked that question to the donor, R.M. Oliver.\n\nCHRISTMAN: He said he used to work at the Department of Corrections.\n\nEISNER: Oliver had been the agency's director at one time, but he had left that position more than a decade before any of the four executions took place. Since Oliver passed away years ago, I visited his son, Stephen. It was pouring outside as we ran for cover into his house in Richmond.\n\nSTEPHEN OLIVER: Sorry the house is a mess.\n\nEISNER: Oh, no, we're sorry we're a little late.\n\nOLIVER: We got you all set up in the kitchen, so...\n\nEISNER: Thank you.\n\nI showed the original briefcase to Stephen. The archivist, Roger, had kept the bag that had carried the tapes all this time in his office and had given me permission to take it from the library. Does this look like something your dad would have?\n\nOLIVER: I don't even remember seeing that briefcase. He may have had it hidden in a closet somewhere. Dad kept it a secret from us.\n\nEISNER: There were certainly reasons people may have wanted to keep the tapes secret. One of them indicated that staff were unprepared to handle one of the most important calls that can be made during an execution.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: Miss Angie.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Yes?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #5: We need to get 306 clear. The governor's office is calling.\n\nEISNER: The governor is the only person with the power to save the prisoner's life, even at that final moment.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: Debbie, they're strapping him in the chair. Hold on a minute.\n\nEISNER: For more than two minutes, they struggled to connect the phone call from the governor as the prisoner sat strapped to the electric chair, just waiting.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #7: Hang that line - hang it up. Tell him we'll call him back.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TELEPHONE BUZZING)\n\nEISNER: Boggs ended up being executed. The governor hadn't wanted to save his life. Had he felt differently, though, Virginia could have come close to executing a man the governor had pardoned. But the last tape in the briefcase revealed an even more serious oversight. The state may have tried to cover up key parts of the execution of a Black man named Wilbert Lee Evans.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: The team is continuing to strap Evans into the chair. It's now 11 o'clock.\n\nEISNER: What happened next on the tape sounds very different from what reporters who witnessed the execution said they observed. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that, after the first volt of electricity hit Evans, he started bleeding from his face.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: It's 11:04. The first surge of electricity has been administered.\n\nEISNER: A reporter from the Alexandria Journal said it was then that the blood started bubbling down his belly and onto his shirt. But there's no mention of any of that on the recording.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: It's 11:05 - second surge of electricity has been administered.\n\nEISNER: Even after that, she still didn't say anything. If the local journalists hadn't reported what happened, the prison's official tape would have made it seem like Evans' face hadn't bled at all.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PERSON #8: It is 11:09. The inmate has expired.\n\nEISNER: I asked the Department of Corrections whether they had any more execution tapes, and they said that they did. They had seven, but they refused to provide any of those. They also declined an interview to talk to me about why. Ian Kalish is an attorney who teaches at the University of Virginia's law school.\n\nIAN KALISH: I think that these types of records are really key to facilitating public oversight and, you know, holding public bodies and, you know, government actors accountable.\n\nEISNER: Virginia executed more people in its history than any other state in America before it abolished the death penalty in 2021. Kalish believes the public deserves to know what happened in its death chamber.\n\nKALISH: It's very concerning to me that, you know, this type of information is being withheld.\n\nEISNER: Today, most executions across the U.S. are carried out by lethal injection, but execution workers still made mistakes during more than a third of the ones that were attempted last year. Blaire Andres leads the U.S. death penalty case work for a nonprofit called Reprieve that advocates against lethal injection.\n\nBLAIRE ANDRES: States have increasingly resorted to secrecy in the execution process.\n\nEISNER: Last year, Alabama took more than three hours to execute Joe Nathan James Jr. The staff said nothing out of the ordinary happened, but Reprieve helped arrange an autopsy of his body. It showed multiple bruises and puncture wounds. I reached out to the Alabama Department of Corrections for comment on the autopsy results, and they didn't reply. Blaire says the state's lack of transparency is suspicious.\n\nANDRES: If the state is doing everything correctly, then they shouldn't have anything to hide. So it does raise the question - what is the state trying to cover up?\n\nEISNER: That's also a question in Virginia. As long as the Department of Corrections refuses to release the rest of the execution tapes, the public won't know the answer.
