        "text": "One day in 1981, an editor asked then-Dispatch State Desk reporter Robin Yocum if he’d like to switch from covering rural Ohio and move to a coveted job on the newspaper’s City/Metro Desk.\n\nHe jumped at the chance. Then he learned he would be covering the nighttime cops beat, working from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. every Sunday through Thursday. He groaned.\n\n“We were going through night cops reporters like Tic-Tacs back then,” recalled the 66-year-old Yocum, of Galena in Delaware County, now a prominent author of both fictional crime and true-crime, and owner of a public relations firm.\n\n“Nobody wanted to do the job.”\n\nNewspapers must report on the awfulness that happens around us: The dangers to the public, the ugly side of society, the horror, the lives lost. Bringing humanity to tragedy, however, is paramount.\n\nAnd so as the Dispatch looks back on its 150th anniversary, it cannot overlook the tragedies covered on its pages.\n\n\"Everyone has a story to tell and these are lives — these people had relationships and friends and family, and I think it is important to never lose sight of the human tragedy of all this,” Yocum said of the victims. \"The stories aren’t just about a name. It's a real person.\"\n\nCovering crime, however, is also work that takes a toll. There is no journalist who relishes having to reach out to someone who has just lost a loved one.\n\n\"The hardest thing I’ve ever had to do in my life was to go up and knock on the door. You know on the other side of that door those people are having the worst day of their life and it’s absolute crisis,\" Yocum said.\n\nFrom the editor: Guided by empathy and fairness, Dispatch updates crime coverage guidelines\n\nThe Dispatch has compiled a list of some of the most infamous cases covered by the paper in the last 150 years. This list is by no means exhaustive, and there are cases that were omitted that, inevitably, some will feel should have been included.\n\nHistorically, much of the press coverage around crime — including in The Dispatch — focused on white neighborhoods. That was not a reflection of the reality of crime in Columbus or around the country. The Dispatch has made a commitment to covering crime with a focus on telling the stories of neighborhoods and people plagued by high crime and neglect by both the media and the city.\n\nThe first 'Trial of the Century'\n\nIn 1929, the body of 24-year-old Theora Hix was found. She had been beaten to death with a hammer.\n\nPolice arrested an Ohio State University veterinary professor, James Snook, who was having an affair with Hix.\n\nThe trial was the first in the country to deal with a homicide that was deemed sexually explicit and was considered to be the \"Trial of the Century\" in Franklin County. Snook was convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed in February 1930.\n\nThe .22 Caliber Killers\n\nBetween December 1977 and December 1978, brothers Gary and Thaddeus Lewingdon killed 10 people. The brothers became known as \"the .22 caliber killers\" because of the style of weapon they used.\n\nThe crime spree spanned Greater Columbus with homicides in Newark, Granville, Fairfield County and several areas of Columbus. The brothers were arrested after Gary Lewingdon attempted to use a credit card stolen from one of the victims.\n\nThe pair were eventually each sentenced to life in prison, where they both died.\n\nThe case has drawn some national attention with books and podcasts.\n\nAsenath Dukat\n\nOne of the area's most-tragic and unsolved homicides is that of 8-year-old Asenath Dukat, who was abducted while walking home from school in 1980 in Upper Arlington.\n\nDukat's body was found several days later in a culvert, with an autopsy showing she was beaten, strangled and sexually assaulted. The case remains unsolved more than 40 years later.\n\nMore from the Dispatch featured on website dedicated to Asenath's case: The Long Walk Home\n\nKelly Ann Prosser\n\nOn Sept. 20, 1982, someone abducted 8-year-old Kelly Ann Prosser as she walked home from Indianola Elementary School. Her body was found in a field south of Plain City two days later. She had been beaten, sexually assaulted and strangled.\n\nIt was a case that had an already jittery community on edge, with the memory still fresh in parents' minds after the death of Asenath Dukat two years earlier.\n\nFor years, Prosser's case remained unsolved, but detectives maintained hope that with advances in DNA science, evidence could be used to identify her killer.\n\nCase closed: Investigators solve 1982 murder of 8-year-old Ohio girl, link DNA to dead killer\n\nThose scientific advances played their part in 2020 when after nearly 40 years, genealogy helped identify Prosser's assailant: Harold Warren Jarrell, known by most as Warren Jarrell.\n\nA DNA match had been located by tracing Jarrell's family DNA and the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation confirmed a DNA match between Jarrell and evidence from the case.\n\nJarrell died in Las Vegas in 1996 at the age of 67. He would have been 53 at the time of Prosser's abduction. There is no forensic evidence tying him to any other crimes in Columbus, police said.\n\nThe Just Sweats scandal\n\nThis one had everything: Millions of dollars in play, fraud, sex, an international manhunt, even a man who went by an alias of Wolfgang Von Snowden. And that was just for starters.\n\nBusiness partners John Hawkins and Melvin Hanson owned a Columbus-based retail clothing chain called Just Sweats. A plot to fake Hanson's death was hatched.\n\nBut instead of finding a body, Hawkins, Hanson and Richard Boggs, a California doctor, decided to go about things another way.\n\nFormer Columbus resident Ellis H. Greene, who was living in the San Fernando Valley in 1988, was lured to Boggs' home, where he was immobilized with a stun gun and suffocated. The body was then identified as Hanson's and the more than $1 million in life insurance went to Hawkins.\n\nHowever, the insurance company began to question the identity of the dead man. Eventually, all three men were caught.\n\nThe I-270 sniper\n\nFor nearly a year between 2002 and 2003, drivers on Interstate 270 were fearful of being shot while driving. Two dozen incidents were reported of vehicles being struck, along with buildings by bullets from a rifle.\n\nIn November 2003, 62-year-old Gail Knisley, of Washington Court House, was killed after being struck by a bullet while driving on the interstate.\n\nOfficials eventually arrested Charles McCoy Jr. in connection with the shootings. McCoy, who was diagnosed as having mental health issues, ultimately accepted a plea deal and was sentenced to 27 years in prison in 2005.\n\nUnfolding tragedy\n\nOn June 13, 2015, what began as a call about a person bleeding on a South Linden sidewalk turned into a nightmare. A 17-year-old girl told responding police officers that there were four people dead inside a home on the 1600 block of East Hudson Street.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Michael Ballour, 41, who lived in the home; Daniel Sharp, 26; Angela D. Harrison, 35; and Tyajah Nelson, 18.\n\nEvidence showed that the two suspects, identified as 16-year-old Jordyn Wade and 27-year-old Robert Adams Jr., forced the victims into the basement of the home to rob them. The surviving victim, who is now an adult, played dead after being grazed by a bullet that struck her neck.\n\nWade's case was transferred to adult court and he was found guilty at trial in 2016. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for more than 170 years. Prosecutors initially sought the death penalty against Adams, but he accepted a guilty plea in 2017 that resulted in him receiving four consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nDeadly fires\n\nOn April 13, 2003, a fire spread through a home in the University District after a front-porch couch was set on fire.\n\nThe three-story house, on East 17th Avenue, had been hosting a party for Alan Schlessman, who turned 21. Schlessman was one of five people killed in the blaze, along with 20-year-olds Kyle Raulin and Christine Wilson, 21-year-old Andrea Dennis and 19-year-old Erin DeMarco. Wilson, Dennis and DeMarco were students at Ohio University who had traveled to Columbus for the party.\n\nFirefighters were able to rescue three students from inside the home.\n\nSeventeen months later, on Sept. 12, 2004, 10 people were killed in a fire set at the Lincoln Park West apartments in Prairie Township. The bodies of nine people, including three children, were found inside and one person was found outside an apartment unit on a stairwell.\n\nAll 10 people were immigrants to the area from Mexico and lived in the same apartment.\n\nBoth fires were determined to be arsons, and both remain unsolved.\n\nThe missing men\n\nThree cases involving men who disappeared without any answers have made many headlines over the years.\n\nThe first case involved Brian Shaffer, who disappeared after a night out at the Ugly Tuna Saloona near Ohio State University's campus in March 2006. Shaffer, 27, a medical student at Ohio State, had been out with a friend and was seen on video footage entering the bar but not leaving.\n\nIn the nearly 17 years since his disappearance, Shaffer's case has continued to draw attention through podcast episodes, TV shows and its own Wikipedia page.\n\nPrior coverage: Disappearance of Ohio State student Brian Shaffer to be on CNN Headline News mystery show\n\nThe second case, occurring almost exactly 10 years later, involved Joey LaBute, who disappeared after enjoying a night out at Union Cafe in the Short North. LaBute's body surfaced in the Scioto River several weeks later. A cause of death has not been determined.\n\nLaBute, 26, was last seen leaving Union Cafe on March 5, 2016. His body was found 24 days later and an autopsy determined there was no water in his lungs or stomach, suggesting he was dead before he entered the river. There was also no indication of any drugs in his system or any signs of trauma, such as a gunshot wound or stab wound.\n\nThe most-recent case involves a man who disappeared after being dropped off at a hotel near Easton Town Center in February 2019. Tyler Davis and his wife, along with one of the couple's friends, had come to Columbus from Wilmington to celebrate his wife's birthday.\n\nAround 3 a.m. on Feb. 24, 2019, Davis told his wife he was going to take a walk while she went to the hotel room. Digital forensics have been able to track Davis' movements until 3:53 a.m. that morning, when an audio clip from his phone showed he was asking for directions back to the hotel. At that time, Davis was near Abbott Labs, near the intersection of Stelzer Road and Morse Crossing.\n\nHis wife said she received a call from Davis around 4 a.m. in which he said he was in a wooded area, could see the hotel and would be there in a few minutes. But he never made it back.\n\nKnox County murders\n\nIn November 2010, horror gripped the small Knox County community of Howard as four people had gone missing from their home.\n\nFour days later, one of the four, a then-13-year-old girl, was found tied up in the Mount Vernon basement of 31-year-old Matthew Hoffman, lying on a bed of leaves and covered with blankets.\n\nHoffman was arrested and eventually led investigators to the bodies of 32-year-old Tina Hermann, 11-year-old Kody Maynard and Stephanie Sprang, 41. Hoffman had broken into Hermann's home and abducted a 14-year-old girl before dismembering the bodies and placing the remains in a tree at the Kokosing Lake Wildlife Area near Fredericktown.\n\nMore: What was in the home, mind of Matthew Hoffman?\n\nHoffman was eventually sentenced to life in prison with no possibility for parole.\n\nIn documents released after the case was closed, Hoffman told investigators he had intended to burglarize the home, but Hermann and Sprang surprised him while he was there. The children surprised him later when they returned home from school.\n\nProsecutors took the death penalty off the table in exchange for Hoffman telling them where he had placed the remains.\n\nPike County massacre\n\nIn April 2016, eight people were killed in Pike County, triggering the largest homicide investigation in state history.\n\nSeven members of the Rhoden family, along with the fiancée of one of the deceased, were found dead in three separate residences. Three children, including a baby that was only days old, were found unharmed.\n\nThe dead were identified as Dana Manley Rhoden, 37; her ex-husband, Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; their sons, Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16, and Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 20; their daughter, Hanna Rhoden, 19; Frankie's fiancée, Hannah Gilley, 20; Kenneth Rhoden, 44, a brother of Chris Sr.; and Gary Rhoden, 38, a cousin of Kenneth and Chris Sr.\n\nIn 2019, four members of another family were arrested: George \"Billy\" Wagner III, his wife, Angela Wagner, and the couple's sons, Edward \"Jake\" Wagner and George Wagner IV. All were charged with eight counts of aggravated murder, among other charges, and faced the death penalty if convicted.\n\nJake Wagner and Hanna Rhoden shared a daughter and the investigation, primarily handled by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, determined the homicides were motivated by custody and control of children.\n\nFor subscribers: Rhoden family homicides: Former prosecutor says length of time to trial isn't unusual\n\nJake Wagner has pled guilty to the killings, admitting to personally killing five of the eight victims. Angela Wagner has also pled guilty to being involved in the conspiracy, though she denied direct involvement in the killings. Both have agreed to testify against Billy Wagner and George Wagner IV when their cases go to trial.\n\nHocking County's satanic cult, or not\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, fears about satanic cults were spreading across the United States. From the Manson family murders in California in 1969 to allegations the 1976 and 1977 Son of Sam killings in New York were tied to a cult led law enforcement to consider such concerns.\n\nIn 1982, Annette Cooper, 18, and her fiancé Todd Schultz, 19, were shot and killed in Hocking County. Their bodies were dismembered, with parts buried in a cornfield and parts thrown in the Hocking River. Cooper's stepfather, Dale Johnston, was initially charged and sentenced in 1984 to death row in the killings.\n\nBut seven years later, Johnston's conviction was thrown out after several evidentiary rulings disallowed evidence that was used to convict him. Prosecutors chose not to retry him, effectively freeing him.\n\nThe investigation into the case had originally resulted in rumors of a satanic cult being involved because of the way in which Cooper and Schultz's bodies were found. However, there was ultimately no connection to the occult.\n\nIn 2008, Chester McKnight was charged and admitted to the killings. He was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nFor the next 30 years, Johnston fought for a ruling to be made that he was wrongfully convicted, allowing him to receive compensation from the state. In 2020, he was awarded $775,000 to settle a lawsuit.\n\nReagan Tokes\n\nOn Feb. 8, 2017, 21-year-old Ohio State University senior Reagan Tokes left her shift as a server at the Bodega Cafe in the Short North.\n\nAt that same time, Brian Golsby, a convicted felon who was on parole and wearing a GPS ankle monitor, saw Tokes as the perfect victim. Golsby kidnapped, robbed, sexually assaulted and eventually killed Tokes.\n\nHer body was found in Scioto Grove Metro Park in Grove City and DNA evidence, along with the GPS information, tied Golsby to the crime. In 2018, Golsby was spared a death sentence by a jury.\n\nTokes received a posthumous Bachelors degree from Ohio State and her parents have advocated for criminal justice reforms that could prevent others like Golsby from being able to commit other crimes.\n\nTheir efforts led to the passage of the Reagan Tokes Act, which gives judges the opportunity to provide a sentencing range versus a definite sentence of a set number of years. Should a defendant have disciplinary issues while incarcerated, they would be able to be held for a longer time before their release.\n\nThe Tokes family has also pushed for reform to how the Adult Parole Authority monitors those who have been released. Golsby's ankle bracelet was not being watched in real time, allowing him to commit six armed robberies prior to Tokes' death.\n\nDoctor accused of doling out fatal doses at Mount Carmel\n\nIn early 2019, an investigation into the deaths of more than 30 patients at two Mount Carmel Health hospitals from February 2015 through November 2018 determined that all had received what the health system called excessive doses of the painkiller fentanyl while in intensive care.\n\nDr. William Husel, who ordered those doses, later had his medical license suspended by the State Medical Board of Ohio and allowed his license to expire.\n\nThe hospital system has paid more than $16 million in settlements in lawsuits filed by the families of those who died.\n\nHomicide detectives with Columbus police also investigated and Husel was ultimately charged with 25 counts of murder in cases where patients received more than 500 micrograms of fentanyl. Experts have said normal doses are usually around 200 micrograms.\n\nTrial will go on: Franklin County judge rejects motion to dismiss murder charges against suspended Dr. William Husel\n\nHusel's lawyers, including high-profile attorney Jose Baez, have said he was providing comfort care to patients who were at the end of life and was not doing anything criminal.\n\nEach of the murder counts filed against Husel carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison with no chance of parole for at least 15 years if he is convicted.\n\nOn Thursday, the prosecution dropped 11 of the 25 murder counts without explanation, though Prosecutor Gary Tyack had previously told The Dispatch that he favored reducing the number of murder charges because Husel, if convicted, \"can only serve so many life terms ...\n\nThe case is currently set for trial to begin on Valentine's Day.\n\nBilly Milligan\n\nIn 1977, women near the Ohio State University campus were terrorized by reports of a man committing robberies and sexual assaults at gunpoint. But after an arrest was made in the case, the ordeal wasn't over.\n\nThe suspect, Billy Milligan, was diagnosed as having multiple personality disorder, with 24 separate personalities identified by psychiatrists. When his case went to trial, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity, the first person in the United States to successfully use that diagnosis in their defense. For about a decade, he was shuffled between mental hospitals before escaping in 1986.\n\nMilligan died in a nursing home in 2014 as a result of cancer.\n\nThe case got new attention in 2021 with the release of a Netflix documentary series about Milligan and the use of multiple personality disorder as a defense. The series \"Monsters Inside: The 24 Faces of Billy Milligan\" utilized interviews with Milligan's siblings, prosecutors on the case, medical experts — including several who treated Milligan — and video footage of Milligan's treatment interviews.\n\nAnyone with information about any unsolved homicide case is asked to call their local law enforcement agency or Central Ohio Crime Stoppers at 614-461-TIPS.\n\nbbruner@dispatch.com\n\n@bethany_bruner\n\nhzachariah@dispatch.com\n\n@hollyzachariah"
