        "text": "For someone who never held local elected office – though he once tried – Richard Barton played an outsized role in the political and civic life of the Arlington community for a half-century.\n\nAnd for the last four decades, he was one of a relatively rare number of true Arlington political “power couples.”\n\nBarton died Nov. 25 at his home in The Jefferson, located in Ballston. He was 85 and had been in declining health for several years, but remained a convivial lunch partner and friend until taking a turn for the worse in the last few weeks.\n\nWhile his previous life in Louisiana politics (explored below) might have been more exciting than the more sedate political scene in the local area, Barton had no regrets about exchanging one for the other.\n\n“It’s been a remarkable personal experience – a wonderful experience working in Arlington politics,” he said in 2015 when he and his wife Jean were honored by the Arlington County Democratic Committee, a body he once chaired.\n\nHaving served on the Arlington School Board when it was an appointed position, Barton’s one attempt on the general-election ballot came in 1975, which owing to a poor economy and local challenges became a rough year for Democrats in Northern Virginia. The team of Barton and Stephen Krum was rejected by a surly electorate in favor of Republican-backed Dorothy Grotos and Walter Frankland Jr. in an era when Arlington remained a two-political-party community.\n\nBehind-the-scenes activism and broader civic engagement proved to be more to Barton’s liking, as his talents as a raconteur and organizer brought him quick success.\n\n“He came to Arlington and became an essential part of our life,” noted former State Sen. Mary Margaret Whipple at the 2015 celebration. (Whipple and Barton had served together on the county School Board in the 1970s.)\n\nBarton at various times penned columns on the local scene both for the Northern Virginia Sun and Falls Church News-Press, serving a stint for the latter as “Our Man in Arlington.” Through the years, he served on the Arlington Planning Commission, Transportation Commission and Economic Development Commission.\n\n“He was most proud, however, when Gov. Chuck Robb appointed him to George Mason University’s board of visitors,” an obituary prepared by the family noted. “This was when GMU was trying to find its way under the direction of then-President George Johnson. For eight years, he worked with Johnson and other board members to provide purpose and direction that helped GMU become the great university it is today.”\n\nBorn on March 20, 1938 in Baltimore, Richard Alan Barton took the long way around to end up in Arlington. He came by way of Louisiana, having served as an intern in the office of then-U.S. Rep. Hale Boggs (D-La.). At the time, he recalled during a 2014 presentation, merely being active in hard-nosed Louisiana politics could be “dicey” – you can draw your own conclusions – and Barton noted that candidates and their staffers frequently had to travel escorted by armed security.\n\nAfter managing a re-election campaign of U.S. Rep. James Morrison (D-La.) and then coming to Washington, Barton served first on Morrison’s staff and then for 13 years as a staff director of three postal-related congressional subcommittees. He then served as chief lobbyist for the Direct Marketing Association for more than two decades before retiring in 2000.\n\nAt the age of 9, he had moved with his parents and siblings to Louisiana, where he would grow up and earn a bachelor’s degree in government from Louisiana State University. A master’s degree in political science from the University of North Carolina and a doctorate in public policy from George Mason University would follow in due course, and Barton ultimately taught classes at Mason.\n\nIn 1964, Barton married Judith Strain; the marriage produced two children and lasted until her death in 1979. Barton several years later married Jean Dickson, an educator by profession, a force to be reckoned with in local and state politics and the former wife of one-time Del. Wallace Dickson (D-Arlington). Richard Barton was fond of joking that if he had known he was going to end up married to an educator, he would have pressed to get the school system more money when he served on the School Board.\n\nAfter retiring from the county school system, Jean Barton served for years as office manager for then-Del. Bob Brink (D-Arlington) during legislative sessions in Richmond. She also has served as a political organizer for Democratic candidates ranging from Joseph Fisher and Henry Howell to Ira Lechner and Geralding Whiting.\n\nThough immersed in politics, neither Barton seemed to take its ups and downs, or themselves, overly seriously. “Both have wonderful senses of humor,” longtime Democratic activist and one-time General Assembly candidate Vivian Kallen said at the 2015 Arlington County Democratic Committee appreciation.\n\nAt that event, Kallen noted that, with both of them unattached at the time, many mutual friends in the early 1980s attempted to play matchmaker before a relationship blossomed.\n\nJoe Pelton, a veteran civic leader, said at the 2015 event that he wasn’t surprised when they emerged as a local Arlington Democratic political power couple.\n\n“They were [each] bigger than life to start out with,” he said.\n\nSurvivors include Barton’s wife of 38 years; two children from his first marriage: Jennifer Barton Lucas (John) and Michael Barton (Courtney); his step-children: Jennifer Dickson Duncan (Bob) and John Dickson; grandchildren Kristen and Madeline Lucas, Josie Barton, Amy Cameron Duncan, Natalie Duncan (Bry), Danielle Dickson, Kaelan and Aidan Brown; and his sister, Martha Lefebvre. He was preceded in death by his first wife, Judith; his brother, Michael Stuart Barton; and Jean Barton’s daughter Julie Dickson Brown (Colin)."
