        "text": "Virginia has a long and dark history with the death penalty. The first execution in the New World took place in Virginia in 1608 when Captain George Kendall was executed in Jamestown for spying. Throughout its history as a colony and a state, Virginia has executed more than 1,300 people, the most of any other state. Virginia has also executed more women and the youngest children of any state.\n\nSince the resumption of capital punishment in the late 1970s following a de facto moratorium imposed by the courts, Virginia has executed 111 people, behind only Texas and Oklahoma during that time. The average time between conviction and execution in Virginia is less than eight years, by far the shortest in the nation.\n\nSince the 1970s, 155 persons convicted and sentenced to death in the United States have been released from death row with evidence of their innocence, spending an average of 10 years on death row. Many of these victims of a faulty justice system would have been executed before evidence of their innocence came to light if they had been convicted in Virginia.\n\nVirginia has executed 111 people since reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976.\n\nExecutions Since 1976\n\nDate Killed Prisoner Race Victims’ Race/Sex Victims’ Name(s) Aug. 10, 1982 Frank Coppola W W/F Muriel Hatchell Oct. 12, 1984 Linwood Briley B W/M John Gallaher Apr. 18, 1985 James Briley B B/F\n\nB/M Judy Barton\n\nHarvey Barton June 25, 1985 Morris Mason B W/F Muriel Hand Aug. 31, 1986 Michael Smith B W/F Audrey Weiler July 6, 1987 Richard Whitley W W/F Phoebe Parsons Apr. 14, 1988 Earl Clanton B B/F Wilhelmina Smith Aug. 30, 1989 Alton Waye B W/F Laverne Marshall July 19, 1990 Richard Boggs W W/F Treeby Shaw Oct. 17, 1990 Wilbert Evans B B/M William Truesdale Dec. 13, 1990 Buddy Justus W W/F Ida Mae Moses July 24, 1991 Albert Clozza W W/F Patricia Bolton Aug. 22, 1991 Derick Peterson B W/M Howard Kauffman May 20, 1992 Roger Coleman W W/F Wanda McCoy July 23, 1992 Edward Fitzgerald W W/F Patricia Cubbage Sept. 15, 1992 Willie Jones B B/M\n\nB/F Graham Adkins\n\nMyra Adkins Dec. 10, 1992 Timothy Bunch W A/F Su Cha Thomas Jan. 19, 1993 Charles Stamper B B/F\n\n2-B/M Agnes Hicks\n\nFranklin Cooley\n\nStephen Staples Mar. 18, 1993 Syvasky Poyner B W/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F Joyce Baldwin\n\nLouise Paulett\n\nVicki Ripple\n\nChestine Brooks\n\nCarolyn Hedrick June 17, 1993 Andrew Chabrol W W/F Lisa Herrington Sept. 14, 1993 Joe Wise B W/M William Ricketson Dec. 16, 1993 David Pruett W W/F\n\nW/F Wilma Harvey\n\nDebra McInnis Mar. 3, 1994 Johnny Watkins B W/F\n\nW/M Betty Barker\n\nCarl Buchanan Apr. 27, 1994 Timothy Spencer B W/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F Susan Tucker\n\nDebbie Davis\n\nSusan Hellams\n\nDiane Cho Jan. 24, 1995 Dana Edmonds B W/M John Elliott May 25, 1995 Willie Turner B W/M Jack Smith Sept. 27, 1995 Dennis Stockton W W/M Kenneth Arnder Oct. 19, 1995 Mickey Davidson W W/F\n\nW/F\n\nW/F Doris Davidson\n\nMamie Clatterbuck\n\nTammy Clatterbuck Nov. 13, 1995 Herman Barnes B W/M\n\nW/M Clyde Jenkins\n\nMohammed Afifi Jan. 4, 1996 Walter Correll W W/M Charles Bousman Jan. 23,1996 Richard Townes B W/F Virginia Goebel July 17, 1996 Joseph Savino W W/M Thos McWaters Nov. 21, 1996 Ronald Bennett B W/F Anne Keller Vaden Dec. 3, 1996 Gregory Beaver W W/M Leo Whitt Dec. 10, 1996 Larry Stout B W/F Jacqueline Kooshian Dec. 12, 1996 Lem Tuggle W W/F Jessie Havens Dec. 16, 1996 Ronald Hoke W W/F Virginia Stell Feb. 6, 1997 Michael George W W/M Alexander Sztanko Feb. 26, 1997 Coleman Gray B W/M Richard McClelland July 17, 1997 Roy Bruce Smith W W/M Sgt.
