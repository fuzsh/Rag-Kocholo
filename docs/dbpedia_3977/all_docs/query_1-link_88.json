        "text": "Richard Anthony Tucker, who was convicted in 1993 of beating, raping and murdering an elderly woman in her Asheville Highway home, is coming off death row -- at least for now.\n\nIn a 12-page decision issued Monday, the South Carolina Supreme Court vacated the death sentence a jury gave the former Roebuck resident in October 1993. The court sent the matter back to a circuit judge for a new sentencing proceeding, at which prosecutors will be free to seek the death penalty again. Trials in which prosecutors seek death sentences are divided into two segments, the guilt phase and -- if the defendant is convicted -- the sentencing phase. The Supreme Court did not overturn Tucker's conviction in the Aug. 1, 1992, murder of 79-year-old widow Carrie Lark Alley, but its decision does mean a new sentencing phase will be held. \"There will be a new jury there to decide whether his penalty will be life in prison or death,\" said Spartanburg attorney Tam Boggs, who represented Tucker eight years ago. \"Testimony will be presented and witnesses called by both the state and the defense.\" Tucker, then 33, was found guilty of breaking in to the bedroom of Alley's house at 728 Asheville Highway sometime after 10 p.m., killing her and stealing jewelry and checks. He testified in the penalty phase of his 1993 trial that \"something snapped inside\" of him when he killed Alley while in the grip of a crack cocaine addiction. In a confession to investigators, Tucker had said he broke into Alley's house to get money to feed his drug addiction and did not intend to rape and kill her. The Supreme Court's decision grants a Writ of Habeas Corpus -- in effect, a motion by Tucker's lawyers claiming he was being wrongfully detailed on death row. The decision is packed with references to case law, and Boggs called it legally complex. \"Basically, the court found that (Circuit Judge Derham Cole's) instructions to a deadlocked jury in 1993 were unconstitutionally coercive because they appeared to put pressure for a decision on one or two jurors who were holding out for a life sentence,\" the attorney said. The Supreme Court did not find fault with Cole personally, but Boggs said justices did find that the instructions he was required to give were legally coercive as written. \"The court's decision helps define what kind of instructions should be used in a death penalty case,\" Boggs said. \"The law grows and changes.\" Alley's brother, Spartanburg County resident Johnny Lark, said he will urge Solicitor Trey Gowdy to seek another death penalty for Tucker. \"(Tucker) has exhausted all of his appeals now,\" Lark said. \"But he didn't give (Alley) any appeals at all. It was a terrible, terrible crime.\" Gowdy was unavailable for comment, but Principal Deputy Solicitor Berry Barnette said no decision has been made. \"None of us were here for the first trial,\" Barnette said. \"We have to review the case first.\" At the new penalty phase, the jury will either vote for the death penalty or a life sentence, or deadlock with no decision. A deadlock would mean an automatic life sentence for Tucker.\n\nTom Langhorne can be reached at 582-4511, Ext. 7221, or at tom.langhorne@shj.com."
