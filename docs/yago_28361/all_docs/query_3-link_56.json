        "text": "Harold Pinter was a slut. But aren’t all playwrights? The interest is brewing about Pinter as Antonia Fraser, Pinter’s second and last wife, is set to publish a book based on her diaries. Anyway, the papers in the U.K. are telling tales of sex, drugs, and . . . plays. Make the jump for the sordid details.\n\nWhen Pinter and Lady Antonia left their spouses to move in with each other in 1975, it was a huge society scandal. She had six children with Sir Hugh Fraser, the Tory MP, and he had a son with Ms Merchant.\n\nMs Merchant drank herself to death in 1982, two years after Pinter and Lady Antonia married. Pinter died in December 2008, aged 78, three years after he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nThe first words Pinter ever spoke to her — at the end of a dinner party in 1975 — were: “Must you go?” “I do remember weighing it up,” she says now. “I often think what would have happened if I had said, ‘No, I must go home and take the children to school.’ I will never know.”\n\n“He stayed until six o’clock in the morning with extraordinary recklessness,” writes Fraser, “but of course the real recklessness was mine.” The affair scandalised society, especially when other prominent figures, including Jonathan Aitken and Lord Lambton, were named as previous “escorts” of Fraser. who is a first cousin of Harriet Harman, the equalities minister and leader of the Commons.\n\n“There had been romances,” Fraser admits. “But I had never for one minute envisaged leaving my marriage.”\n\nThree months into the affair, Sir Hugh asked his wife if she was in love with another man. “Yes! I am madly in love with someone else,” she said. When she told him who, he said grimly: “The best living playwright. Very suitable.”\n\nBefore Fraser, there were others:\n\nBut The Daily Telegraph has discovered that there was one final secret which the promiscuous playwright took with him to the grave in 2008.\n\nWhile he was cheating on his wife with Dame Joan, Pinter was also having a passionate clandestine affair with a beautiful New York socialite, who has now broken her 40-year silence to confirm that she and Pinter were lovers “for many years”.\n\nBarbara Stanton said she had a “long, involved” relationship with the Nobel laureate, whom she met when he was directing a play on Broadway . . .\n\nMrs Stanton made veiled references to her relationships with Pinter and Mr Balding in her biography Hard Candy, published two decades ago. She referred to the former only as “Harry” and the latter as “David”.\n\nShe also claimed that, during the 1960s she and Pinter took recreational drugs on holiday with friends at a villa in Mexico. They all spent the week “stoned”, and “tripped” on hallucinogenic drugs.\n\nThe group supposedly took LSD, but one night she had a bad “trip” and called out to “Harry” for help. “Harry didn’t answer but I knew he wouldn’t abandon me. Harry was part of this chemically extended family I’d joined, in innocent indecency, to stay stoned for the holidays,” she said.\n\nAccording to Mrs Stanton, she became pregnant by Pinter but her doctor told her the embryo was dead or dying. Since abortion was illegal in the US, Mrs Stanton said Pinter arranged for her to have the pregnancy terminated in Britain, but he did not see her in hospital for fear of being recognised.\n\nAs an aside, The Daily Mail says it has the exclusive on the story, but I guess no one’s listening."
