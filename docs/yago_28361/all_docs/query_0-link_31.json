The evening will include an opportunity for audience questions and close with a drinks reception.\n\nAntonia Fraser is the author of many widely acclaimed historical works, which have been international bestsellers. She was awarded the Medlicott Medal by the Historical Association in 2000 and was made a DBE in 2011 for services to literature.\n\nCommenting on the event, Antonia Fraser says:\n\n“I’m delighted to be joining the Society of Authors and English PEN at The British Library for an evening in conversation with Claire Armitstead to discuss my experiences as an author and of supporting fellow authors. I look forward to celebrating my 90th birthday with you all.”\n\nTickets are now open to the public for £10.00 or free to British library members.\n\nFind out more about the event and how to book on our events page.\n\nImage of Antonia Fraser (c) English PEN + George Torode"
