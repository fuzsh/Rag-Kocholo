Both were already married - Pinter to the actress Vivien Merchant and Fraser to the politician Hugh Fraser - but their union seemed inevitable from the moment they met: 'I would have found you somehow', Pinter told Fraser. Their relationship flourished until Pinter's death on Christmas Eve 2008 and was a source of delight and inspiration to them both until the very end.\n\nJoin Times theatre critic, Benedict Nightingale in conversation with Antonia Fraser as they discuss modern literature's most celebrated and enduring marriage with fascinating glimpses into Pinter and Fraser's creativity and their illustrious circle of friends from the literary, political and theatrical world.\n\nAntonia Fraser\n\nAntonia Fraser is the author of many widely acclaimed historical works which have been international bestsellers. The prizes she has won include the Wolfson Award for History and the Norton Medlicott Medal of the Historical Association. She has been President of English PEN, chairman of the Society of Authors, and chairman of the Crime Writersâ Association.\n\nAntonia Fraser was made DBE in 2011 for services to literature. She was married to Harold Pinter who died in 2008. Her previous books include Mary Queen of Scots, Cromwell: Our Chief of Men, King Charles II, The Gunpowder Plot: Terror and Faith in 1605, The Six Wives of Henry VIII, The Weaker Vessel, Warrior Queens, Love and Louis XIV, and most recently Perilous Question:The Drama of the Great Reform Bill 1832. Must You Go? My Life with Harold Pinter was published in 2010.

Please click here to buy.\n\nIn 1863, a French wine merchant called Daniel Nicholas ThÃ©venon and his wife arrived in England in a bid to escape the clutches of creditors in Paris. So began a story that grew out of bankruptcy and culminated in the creation of Regent Streetâs CafÃ© Royal:Â a truly remarkable and original establishment with what was considered at one point to have the greatest wine cellar in the world and wasÂ reputed for its excellent hospitality, dining and entertainment.Â\n\nFrequented by writers and artists such as Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, the conversations, inspirations and discussions at âThe CafÃ©â were profound. Arthur Conan Doyle, H G Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Rudyard Kipling, W B Yeats, Walter Sickert and James McNeill Whistler were all patrons. Distinguished figures such as Winston Churchill, Augustus John, D H Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, NoÃ«l Coward, Jacob Epstein and Graham Greene were also often seen."
