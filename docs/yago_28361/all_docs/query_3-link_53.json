        "text": "About the Play:\n\nThe Lover has long been a favourite of acting teachers for Male/Male Scenes.\n\nThe Lover is a one-act drama by Nobel prize-winner Harold Pinter. A seemingly staid British couple play a psychological game of needs and wants, making up the rules as they go along, and taking on lovers while exploiting each other's weaknesses in this comic drama. As ever in this absurdist playwright's work, there are two distinct plays taking place... the verbal and the nonverbal... and what the characters do not say is as important as what they do say.\n\nThe Lover follows the married couple Richard and Sarah as they struggle for balance and control, each bending the rules and risking instability as they come dangerously close to destruction. A respectable businessman, Richard leaves for work every day and agrees not to return before six so that Sarah can enjoy her lover after lunch. He visits a call girl in this time. But when Richard suggests the four of them meet, the role-playing games get out of hand and lead to unexpected conflict. The lover tires of his mistress and their worlds collide. Harold Pinter leads the audience to believe that there are three characters in the play: the wife, the husband and the lover. But the lover who comes to call in the afternoons is revealed to be the husband adopting a role. He plays the lover for her: she plays the call girl for him. The play contrasts bourgeois domesticity with sexual yearning. Another Off-Broadway success by one of the theatre's most inventive and versatile writers. A subtle blending of artful nuance, veiled menace and zany humour.\n\nThe Lover premiered in 1963 at the Arts Theatre Club in London as a part of a double bill with The Dwarfs. Its US premiere was in 1964 at Cherry Lane Theatre off-Broadway in New York City. The play has become a favourite scene study vehicle in acting classes and workshops and has been performed in regional repertory and college theatre productions.\n\nCast: 1 female, 2 male\n\nWhat people say:\n\n\"...dazzling ... the little play works simply beautifully... he uses his personal brand of dialogue to distil wit. The menace is there, too, perhaps under the surface of the wit; and the wit, in any case, is not vapid. It is peculiarly revealing and provocative.\" — The Financial Times\n\n\"Mr. Pinter's play is a brilliantly seasoned use of theatricality.\" — The New York Times\n\n\"…a bizarre theatrical evening.\" — New York Post\n\nAbout the Playwright:"
