        "text": "Harold Pinter: biography\n\nHarold Pinter's BiographyBirth:10th October 1930Death: 24th December 2008Father:Hyman 'Jack' PinterMother:Frances née MoskowitzSpouse/PartnersVivien Merchant (m. 1956-1908), Lady Antonia Fraser (m. 1980-2008)Children:1Famous Works:\n\nThe Room\n\nThe Birthday Party\n\nThe Homecoming\n\nNo Man's Land\n\nThe Caretaker\n\nNationality:EnglishLiterary Period:Postmodernism\n\nHarold Pinter was born on October 10th 1930, in Hackney, East London. He was of Jewish Eastern European descent. His father, Hyman (Jack) Pinter, was a tailor. His mother, Frances Pinter, was a housewife. Pinter started to write poetry when he was only 12 years old. His poetry was first published in his school's magazine until, in 1950, some of it was printed in the Poetry London magazine.\n\nDuring that time, Pinter used the pseudonym Harold Pinta.\n\nBetween 1948 and 1951, Pinter trained to be an actor. First, he attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and then the Central School of Speech and Drama. This didn't last long, however, because he dropped out of both institutions. In 1951, Pinter joined the Anew McMaster repertory theatre company. In the next 12 years, he continued to work as a repertory actor for different companies, under the stage name David Baron. To make ends meet, Pinter also acted for radio and film, and he worked a number of odd jobs. Additionally, he continued to write poetry and started to engage in playwriting as well.\n\nIn 1956, Pinter married actress Vivien Merchant. In 1957, he wrote and produced his first drama, a one-act play called The Room. This was followed by his first full-length play, The Birthday Party (1958). Although it wasn't received well by audiences and critics at the time it was first produced in the late 1950s, The Birthday Party later became one of Pinter's most famous works.\n\nThroughout the 1960s, Pinter wrote several plays for stage and radio, such as The Caretaker (1960) and The Homecoming (1965), establishing himself as a key figure in the Theatre of the Absurd. Over the next two decades, Pinter wrote several works on the topic of memory, including the plays No Man’s Land (1975) and Betrayal (1978).\n\nThe Theatre of the Absurd (or Absurdist drama) is a genre of drama that was started by European playwrights in the 1950s. Plays in this genre are 'absurd' and seemingly illogical. The purpose of the plot is not the classic conflict and resolution but an expression of existentialism that asks questions about the meaning (or lack thereof) of human existence. Plays categorised within the Theatre of the Absurd usually have a round narrative structure, meaning that they end in the same way they started.\n\nIn 1980, Pinter and Vivien Merchant divorced. Pinter had several affairs during their marriage. They had one son, Daniel, who later became estranged from his father and even changed his surname. In 1980, Pinter married writer Antonia Fraser who he had already had an affair with. The two of them didn't have any children but Pinter looked after his step-children from Antonia's first marriage. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s Pinter continued to write plays and to be involved in the theatre in other ways by acting and directing. In 1996, he received the Olivier Award.\n\nPinter wrote Celebration, his last stage play, in the year 2000. In 2001, he was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus. In the following 7 years, Pinter kept working while he was also undergoing treatment. During that time he wrote screenplays and radio plays. His last radio play, Voices, was produced in 2005. The same year Pinter won the Nobel Prize for Literature. After that, he decided to focus on his poetry and to stop writing dramas. However, Pinter continued to work in the theatre industry – he played Krapp in a 2006 production of Krapp's Last Tape (1958) by Samuel Beckett.\n\nHarold Pinter died of cancer on Christmas Eve 2008. He died in Hammersmith hospital in London.\n\nThroughout his life, and especially in the later decades of it, Harold Pinter was very politically-active. He was part of the antiwar movement in Britain and openly against any military operation and any act of violation of human rights. Pinter expressed his views and often criticised the British Government as well as the Governments of other countries, such as the United States, in many of his essays and interviews.\n\nHarold Pinter's influence\n\nThroughout his life, Harold Pinter wrote over 30 plays and a number of screenplays, poems and essays. In his works, Pinter explores the absurdity of the human condition. He addresses people's constant fight for dominance and their struggle to communicate with each other. Although there is a lot of violence in his dramas, his political message is a revolt against violent and restrictive powers. Pinter's works are open-ended and unpredictable which keeps the audience on their toes. Some of his dramas, such as The Birthday Party, are full of dark humour and have been labelled as comedy of menace.\n\nThe term 'comedy of menace' was coined by drama critic Irvin Wardle. Comedy of menace is a type of play in which while the audience laugh at the comedic elements they are aware that something terrible is going to happen to the characters.\n\nHarold Pinter had a very distinct literary style that is referred to as 'Pinteresque style'. He used colloquial language as well as long and regular pauses to represent the communication barriers that the characters in his plays face. The dialogues in Pinter's dramas are also very true to real-life conversations."
