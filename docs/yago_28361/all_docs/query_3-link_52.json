        "text": "Playwright and writer\n\n​An icon of theatre, Harold Pinter wrote 29 plays and 15 dramatic sketches, while directing almost 50 productions. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2005, just one of some 50 awards he received for his plays, radio productions and poems. A prominent political activist, he was a strong opponent of the war in Iraq, the campaign in Kosovo and US foreign policy.\n\nPinter was born to Jewish parents of Eastern European origin in Hackney. He renounced his Judaism after his Bar Mitzvah although he remained a vociferous anti-Israel campaigner until his death. Due to evacuation during the war, Pinter was separated from his parents for much of his youth, but was with them in London during the Blitz. These experiences profoundly affected him and in 1948 he refused to take part in National Service. He saw the war as an unjust imperial conflict and his parents paid for his refusal fine. Later in life, he was one of the most influential voices in opposition to the war on Iraq he also campaigned for human rights. Upon receiving his Nobel Prize, the majority of his acceptance speech was a scathing tirade against US foreign policy.\n\nAs a writer, Pinter was an innovator. His manipulation of absurd theatre, colloquial dialogue and silence in everyday settings have led to the adjective ‘Pinteresque.’ However, such innovation had its cost; his first major play The Birthday Party (1958) was almost unanimously ridiculed by critics.\n\nIn his private life Pinter also demonstrated his disdain for norms. He married his first wife, Vivien Merchant, without the blessing (or knowledge) of his parents during the Jewish festival Yom Kippur. It was Vivien who persuaded him to continue as a playwright in spite of the poor reception to The Birthday Party. After this, Pinter’s career went from strength to strength; The Caretaker (1960) saw Pinter’s recognition reach new heights. However, his marriage to Vivien collapsed publically in 1975. Pinter later had an affair with the historian and wife of a Tory MP, Lady Antonia Fraser, whom he later married and remained with until his death.\n\nThe public perception of Pinter was one of a grouchy man, averse to small talk. He was an avid cricket fan, playing and managing a team, The Gaieties. He was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in 2002 but he continued to work even whilst undergoing treatment. In 2005, Pinter announced that he would no longer write any plays, but direct his energy towards political activism. This coincided with him developing septicaemia and a rare skin disease which limited his mobility, yet he continued to adapt screenplays and produce poetry, including a poem entitled Cancer Cells which was widely acclaimed for its dark humour.\n\n​\n\nOn Christmas Eve in 2008, Pinter succumbed to liver cancer and news of his death touched people all over the world. An iconic playwright with an intense attention to detail and desire for perfection, his impact on theatre was immeasurable. Pinter was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery, accompanied by readings from Michael Gambon and Antonia Fraser.\n\nGrave Site"
