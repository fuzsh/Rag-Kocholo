More than 75 nomina¬ tions were received for the 11 awards, each created to recognise excellence shown by a local Cannock Chase business. The winning businesses will be announced at an offi¬ cial reception evening on Friday, October 25 at the Premier Suite in Cannock. Overwhelmed This year’s event follows last year’s inaugural cere¬ mony, organised by Chase MP Aidan Burley in partner¬ ship with The Best of Cannock’s Steve Mallows. Mr Burley said: “I would like to thank all those busi¬ nesses who have entered this year’s awards. “I have been overwhelmed by the reaction and I know that the judges found it extremely difficult to pick the 11 winners. “These Awards are my attempt to highlight the unsung businesses in Cannock Chase which are the life blood of our economy.” Mr Mallows said: “Can¬ nock Chase really does have some excellent businesses and acknowledging them is, I believe, very important.” Man airlifted for treatment AN emergency helicopter landed in Cannock to take a man to hospital. The Warwickshire & Northamptonshire Air Am¬ bulance was called to a home in the town at 3.32pm on Tuesday. A 53-year old who had become unwell and needed transfer to a neuro¬ logical hospital. The patient, who had had no previous medical issues, had developed a severe headache and had become confused and agitated. He was airlifted to Uni¬ versity Hospital north Staffordshire FRESH FEARS OVER IVY HOUSE FUTURE AN historic Cannock building is once again under threat of demolition - just months after residents thought they had thwarted the plans. The 143-year-old Ivy House site in Wolver¬ hampton Road is being earmarked for develop¬ ment under new proposals by Wrekin Housing Trust. The former hospital could make way for 12 affordable homes and four apart¬ ments - prompting an outcry from residents who fear the town's heritage is being torn up. Previous plans to knock down the Ivy House were shelved by Staffordshire County Council in March after more than 1,000 people signed a petition against the work. Disappointed The development is linked to a new health park and assisted living complex that was granted permission at the former Langbourn House site nearby this year. It has now emerged that Ivy House was sold by Staffordshire County Council to Wrekin Housing Trust this year subject to planning. Margaret price, aged 68, is campaigning to save the Vic¬ torian building. She said: “We are not sur¬ prised to see that Ivy House's future is now in doubt again. However, we are very disappointed. “Ivy House is one of the only existing historic build¬ ings and it is important that we do all we can to save it.” She added: “More than 1,000 fought to stop the building being bulldozed in a very short amount of time. “We thought it would only be a matter of time before we were faced with this again. “It is such a beautiful building and is Cannock’s history.” Staffordshire County Council, which used to have by Rob Golledge its social services team based in the building, previously said it was costing taxpayers £100,000 to maintain. Parts of Ivy House date back to 1870 when it was built as the Penkridge Poor Law Union’s Workhouse. It later became The Chase Hospital. Wrekin Housing Trust is working with developer Gal- liford Try on the scheme. A flyer about the propos¬ als states: “Twelve three- bed family dwellings and four apartments are being proposed, fronting onto Wolverhampton Road. “The dwellings them¬ selves follow the wider resi¬ dential context of the area and have allocated parking provision.” Locals can view plans and ask questions on the scheme at drop-in sessions at St Stephens Church, Bideford Way, Cannock, next week. They are being held from 10am to noon on October 15 and from 4-6pm the follow¬ ing day. There will also be a formal event on October 23 from 6.30-7.30pm at The civic centre ballroom, Beecroft Road. A planning application will subsequently be submit¬ ted.

Organisers of the fourth annual Santa Dash in Cannock are asking people to sign up as quickly as they can for the challenge. Cannock Chase MP Aidan Burley has already agreed to take part in the Newlife Foundation run on Decem¬ ber 14. The charity’s fundraising manager, Nora Smith, said: “We want to make the Newlife Santa Dash bigger and better than last year so are we urging people to put the date in their diaries and sign up as soon as possible. “It’s a great opportunity for individuals as well as families, groups of work col¬ leagues, students and even health and leisure club members to get together for a bit of festive fun.

Newlife will provide every participant with a Santa suit.

Ashley Lawton had been ejected and banned from the house in Burntwood after repeated thefts of property. His parents had even put a lock on their bedroom door to prevent his thieving. But on August 30 he burgled the property using a key he had kept, kicked open the bedroom door and stole cash and jewellery totalling around £10,000. String Mr Robert Edwards, pros¬ ecuting at Stafford Crown Court, said Lawton had also kept a bank card that he used 17 times to steal a total of £1,638. When the offences were reported to the police, Lawton’s mother also revealed a string of thefts of goods totalling more than £7,000. “His mother and stepfa¬ ther are at their wits end as a result of his heroin addic¬ tion,” said Mr Edwards. Lawton, aged 27, formerly of Chase Road, admitted burglary, theft and making false representations. Mr Stephen Bailey, defending, said: “He is beginning to realise the harm in his behaviour, not only to himself, but to others. The motive for the burglary was threats from his dealers.” Fans onroad to Cup glory TWO Tyneside football fans arrive at Hednesford Town as they continue their ‘Cup Running’ journey.

Councillor Ian Lawson open Sir Julian House Takeover in jeopardy over funding shortfall HEALTH bosses due to take over the running of Stafford Hospital have cast doubt on the plans, claiming there is a shortfall of £125 million to make the shake-up a reality. In addition, Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust says it would require £14m to increase the Manor Hospital’s capacity should it take patients from Cannock. ■ I I _ University Hospital of NeaMV 3 000 North Staffordshire respondto consultation on proposals ALMOST 3,000 people sub¬ mitted written responses to an official consultation on plans for the futures of Stafford and Cannock Chase hospitals. Trust Special Administra¬ tors who have drawn up pro¬ posals to strip services from Stafford and boost provision at Cannock are now consid¬ ering the replies before sub¬ mitting their final report to health watchdog Monitor. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will make a final deci¬ sion by December 31. Under draft plans Stafford will lose its mater¬ nity unit and in-patient pae¬ diatric care while critical care will be downgraded. The shake-up would see University Hospital of North Staffordshire take over the running of Stafford with Wolverhampton and Walsall health trusts vying to take over Cannock Chase Hospital in Brunswick Road site, under the plans. TSA Alan Bloom said: “We are delighted to say that we have received in total over 2,800 responses, which we will consider along with the issues raised at the numer¬ ous meetings that we have attended during the consul¬ tation period.” (UHNS) said the proposals were financially unsustain¬ able. Bosses believe they would need to spend £67m bring¬ ing Stafford up to scratch by improving buildings and equipment - and a further £58m extending its site in Stoke-on-Trent to take on extra patients. UHNS, which would take over Stafford under draft proposals from Trust Special Administrators, has said that ‘unless the trust receives the level of funding required we will be unable to run safe, high-quality serv¬ ices at Stafford’. Critical UHNS revealed its response to the TSA’s plans, which would see Stafford Hospital stripped of its maternity unit and face the withdrawal of inpatient pae¬ diatric care, while critical care would be downgraded. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will make a final deci¬ sion by December 31. In its official response, UHNS says the TSA’s plan for the trust to make 8.5 per cent of savings each year at Stafford for three years would be ‘unachievable’. Stafford MP Jeremy Lefroy said: “Moving mater¬ nity, critical care and inpa¬ tient paediatrics to Stoke doesn’t make sense in the eyes of my constituents.” Under thedraft plans, the Royal Wolverhampton Hos¬ pitals NHS Trust, which runs New Cross Hospital, would take over services from Cannock Hospital. Rebecca Gocmen, right, of Chadsmoor, sports her new look with Amanda Craggs A MOTHER-of-two proved a snip of the old locks as she had her head shaved for charity. Rebecca Gocmen underwent the close shave so she can donate her flowing locks to make wigs for children with cancer. Rebecca Gocmen, of Chadsmoor, took the decision to shave her head so her hair can be donated to The Little Princess Trust. The charity gives wigs to children who have lost their hair through chemotherapy. She has also raised more than £640, with sonme of the sponsorship money still to be collected. The 29-year-old from Hardie Green says the headshave - which saw a total of 16 inches taken off her hair - took just 15 minutes. Mrs Gocmen came up with the idea after her aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer and was forced to have both breasts removed. A family friend of Mrs Gocmen’s was also diagnosed with lung and liver cancer in the same week. Mrs Gocmen said: “I know a lot of people who have been affected with cancer. It really is a terrible experience. But all you can really do is support them.” Mrs Gocmen had a number of people to thank after the bald move, including her cousins and her dad, Brian Hodgkiss, who works for electrical contractors CEF. He dished out sponsorship forms at work and to his customers, while teachers at West Hill Primary School in Hednesford also donated. Chadsmoor restaurant FiftyTwo also offered their support. Anyone else wishing to sponsor Mrs Gocmen can visit www.just giving.com/rebecca-gocmenl Thief took phones in changing room raid A THIEF who stole mobile phones and cash from a foot¬ ball club’s changing rooms has been spared an immedi¬ ate jail term. Callum Hill entered the premises at Hednesford Town’s Keys Park ground at around 7.15pm on August 8 - initially to use the toilet. But after spotting the changing room doors un¬ locked, he stole mobile phones worth more than £500 each and £65 in cash. Hill, aged 19, of Cheveral Avenue, Coventry, had intended to sell the items, the court heard. Prosecutor John Peel said: “A worker from the club saw Mr Hill and an accomplice attempting to leave. He grabbed Mr Hill, a struggle took place and various items fell out of his pockets.” He said Hill did not iden¬ tify his accomplice so some items were still missing. Mr Paul Jenkins, defend¬ ing, said Hill was under the influence of someone else and wanted to cut ties with certain associates. Hill pleaded guilty to theft and was given a 10-week jail term suspended for a year, was told to pay £735 in com¬ pensation, £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. He was also ordered to carry out 150 hours unpaid work. Readers to see Rat Pack THREE Chronicle readers have won tickets to the Rat Pack Vegas Spectacular at the Prince of Wales Centre.

Summer heatwave blamed as number of blazes on rise THE number of outdoor fires across Stafford¬ shire this summer has soared - with the summer heatwave being blamed. Fire service bosses say the hot weather is behind the increase between April and June this year, com¬ pared to the same period in 2012. As temperatures soared, firefighters noticed an increase in blazes. Many happen in bins when people dispose of bar¬ becue coals. Figures also show the number of fires involving property and casualties for April to June 2013 was 349, a fall of nine compared to the same quarter in 2012/13. There were 128 accidental house fires between April and June 2013, an increase of six when compared to the same period in 2012/13. Rain The number of small fires excluding grass increased from 326 to 378 when com¬ pared to the same period in 2012/13. The number of grass fires rose between April and June 2013, tripling from 164 to 501. Head of risk reduction for the county’s fire service Glynn Luznyj said: “We have been lucky enough to have enjoyed a fairly long, hot summer this year, par¬ ticularly when compared to 2012 when we experienced lots of rain. “The hot weather brings with it an increase in small fires as people are out and about and the opportunity for this type of blaze to occur, either accidentally or deliberately, is far greater. B by Adam Burling “We have been increas¬ ingly proactive in engaging with young people across Staffordshire and Stoke-on- Trent in recent years, edu¬ cating them on the dangers of setting fire to rubbish bins and such like.” Meanwhile, a shared service linking Staffordshire and West Midlands fire serv¬ ices’ response systems has gone live. Staffordshire is now using the Vision system, which was already running in the West Midlands, to record and monitor incidents and mobilise crews. Staffordshire Chief Fire Officer Peter Dartford says the new technology could speed up response times. The two services are to merge their command centres, reverting to a single base at the West Midlands’ headquarters on Vauxhall Road in Birmingham from next spring. Under the shake up, the existing 101 posts across the two centres will be reduced to 76. Fire chiefs say the merger will also save tax¬ payers £500,000. Church hosts autumn fair A BURNTWOOD church hosts a fundraising autumn fair this weekend. Chase Terrace Methodist Church hosts the event on Saturday, October 12, from 11am to 2pm. Hot lunches of jacket potatoes or soup at £3 a head will be served from 12 noon and the price includes a dessert and tea or coffee. Attractions will include tombola, games, cakes and preserves sales and bric-a-brac. Brother, where are you now? AN ARCHITECT is appealing for help to trace his long lost half-brother. Stewart Ross, aged 69, was born in Great Wyrley in 1944, but now lives in New Zealand. For 45 years he thought he only had a sister, but after his father’s death in 1989, he discov¬ ered he also has a half-brother. He has now returned to the area to try to track him down. He said: “After my father died, my mother told me all about my half-brother, Melvyn James Simpson. “My father, Bruce Ross, came to live in Cannock from New Zealand before the war and since his death, I have found out that he had a relationship with a woman called Rosa Simpson. “Rosa was a cashier at the local cinema and lived in Walsall Road. Together they had Melvyn in December 1939. Melvyn was born in Dartmouth Road. “During that time, my mother and father were pen-pals. She came to the UK to join him that year and they married in 1940. “Rosa ended up marrying a man named Harold Hayward in 1942 so it may be that Melvyn’s surname was changed.” Mr Ross has been trying to trace his half-brother with the help of Megan Owens, a family history researcher who works behind the scenes on BBCl’s Who Do You Think You Are?

NEWS in brief Market owners’ indoor pitch plan THE owners of Penkridge Market plan to convert an existing building into five individual units, granting traders a permanent indoor pitch. Matt Williams, manager of the market, off the A449, said: “They will provide a secure lockable space for traders to leave their stock and give cus¬ tomers a dry, warm area to browse their goods.” Trading days at the market, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, attract up to 5,000 visitors. Work on the new units should start in the next few weeks, with an esti¬ mated completion date of early in the New Year. Units will be allocated on a ‘first come, first served basis’ and owners hope to attract some new stall holders, selling fishing tackle, haberdash¬ ery and a florist.

You either do it boldly, con¬ fidently and with utter conviction or you do it, er, gin¬ gerly. □□□□□□□□ IT WAS wrong of the Daily Mail to accuse Ed Miliband’s Marxist father of hating Britain - especially when the only hard evidence came from a diary Ralph Miliband wrote when he was just 17. I shudder at the thought of being judged by anything I wrote at 17. To be damned by some¬ thing your father wrote in his teens is grotesquely unfair. □□□□□□□□ AND yet, as Enoch Powell once observed, a politician complaining about the Press is like a ship’s captain complaining about the sea. Politics is a dirty game but all the players are volunteers. The first rule is that once you sign up, people will want to know everything about you. Ed Miliband could be the next prime minister, leading a nuclear-armed nation of 60 million. He deserves exactly the same level of scrutiny as any other prime minister-in-waiting. In a perfect world a politi¬ cian’s dead parents would not be fair game. But remember the scorn, the sneering, the cartoons, the Spitting Image gags when the Left discovered to its glee that the Tory leader John Major was the son of a one-time circus performer? What’s sauce for the Majors is sauce for the Milibands. nnnnnnnn IN THE week in which all eyes focused on the Marxist beliefs of Ed Miliband’s father, the eternal battle between capitalism and socialism was spluttering in our universities. And not all the staff are happy about it. Plashing Vole, the excellent website run by Wolverhampton University lec¬ turer Aidan Byrne, reports on a ghastly David Brent-style “team-building” day foisted on unhappy staff by the uni management. The worst bit, apparently, was not the enforced singing nor the obligatory coloured T-shirts, nor even the lecture on “positivity,” but the Thatcherite banner which suddenly appeared on the lecture screen, urging them: “Be creative, grow the business, make money.” Byrne observes despairingly: “This is the slogan of the estate agency or the boiler room, not a seat of learning.” □□□□□□□□ THIS week it was announced that the British Army is recruiting reservists who are IT experts to wage war in cyberspace. Without a shot being fired, a new genera¬ tion of squaddies will slip hugely complex viruses into enemy computers, wrecking their infrastructure. Obvi¬ ously, platoons of cyber-warriors will have to be organ¬ ised into a new regiment. The Queen’s Own Geeks? □nnnnnnn A LITTLE sign in the window tells us our local butcher is to close. There has been a butcher’s shop in those prem¬ ises for more than a century. Now, it is making way for a patisserie. Across the road, our old bank has become a beauty parlour. It reflects a consumer society where tradi¬ tional food and personal service make way for a rather pointless battle between cakes which threaten to make you fat and beauticians who promise to make you thin. nnnnnnnn THE strangest complaint during the Fire Brigades Union strike was the firefighter moaning on Radio 4 that she had expected a 30-year career and it now looked like becoming a 40-year career. Comrades, this is an outrage. Let us raise the scarlet banner high to fight the monstrous imposition of a job for life. nnnnnnnn I WROTE a piece three years ago about a trip to the Somme to find the exact spot where my great-uncle, Private Alvin Smith, was killed, probably by friendly fire, in September 1916.

Following the success of the ‘Love Your Street’ initiative in Brereton last year, Cannock Chase Council joined forces with Chase Council for Voluntary Services to roll out the scheme within the Chadsmoor area. A packed programme of activities was carried out over three days in Benion Road, Wrights Avenue, Central Avenue, Princess Street, Rigby Drive, Woodford End, Redhill Road and Byron Place. A celebration event was held on the Wrights Avenue park, with activities including Beat the Shark, face painting, arts and crafts and bouncy castle. Litter picks were carried out by McDon¬ ald’s staff and home fire risk checks were made by Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service. Residents were also given crime prevention advice with a particular focus on illegal money lending. Councillor Mike Holder, portfolio holder for crime and partnerships said: “I am plea¬ sed to bring the initiative to Chadsmoor.” Councillors Frank Allen and Gordon Alcott, Kent Parson, of Chase CVS and McDonald’s staff before the litter pick Villagers’ protests fail as waste plant granted PLANNERS have given the go-ahead for a £20 million waste plant in Huntington - to the dismay of hundreds of protesters who had fought against it. The controversial plans caused uproar among villagers who compiled two petitions containing around 850 signatures demanding it to be scrapped. But members of Stafford¬ shire County Council’s plan¬ ning committee last Thursday gave the green light for the development in Cocksparrow Lane. They said that no objec¬ tions had been received from Staffordshire’s highways department or Environmen¬ tal Health and that if they turned down the application it would likely be approved on appeal. Appalling South Staffordshire MP Gavin Williamson, who had also opposed the plans, said granting the development was ‘an appalling decision’. The application facing the council was to renew plan¬ ning permission for the 200ft-high plant on the former Littleton Colliery site. The plant would break down green waste, and pos- B by Kirsten Rawlins sibly food, into fertiliser and methane, as well as produce electricity for the National Grid. Councillor Ian Lawson told the meeting that, while he does not like the plans, there was a need for such a facility in Staffordshire. “This is something we need across the county whether we like it or not,” he said. The application was passed subject to more than 40 conditions. But nearby residents say they feel they have been ‘let down’. Mark Hough, who lives in Stafford Road, Huntington, said: “A site like this next to a brand new school is ludi¬ crous.” Mr Williamson vowed to continue the fight against the digester plant. He said: “This is a totally inappropriate site for a digestion facility.” Choral group on the hunt for new singers NEW singers are needed at a Cannock group. The Chase Choral Society Mixed Voice Choir have vacancies for tenors and bass singers. The choir, under the directorship of Derek Bailey, enjoys singing a variety of music from choral, stage and popular songs. They perform at church fundraising concerts, at weddings and funerals, and many private functions. There are no age restrictions and no auditions required. Practice evenings are held at St Luke’s School in New Penkridge Road Cannock on Wednesdays 7.30 to 9.15pm during term time. Call the secretary on 01543 270690 for more details or booking enquiries. Descent is plan (ab)seiling Hermione Arblaster, aged 15 during her descent down the New Walsall Art Gallery FEARLESS fundraisers descended a land¬ mark building for a support group which helps children with hearing difficulties. Among those taking part for Walsall Deaf Children’s Society was 15-year-old Hermione Arblaster and her mother Juli¬ ette of Heath Hayes. Ten supporters in all donned harnesses and helmets to abseil down the New Walsall Art Gallery, raising £2,200. Hermione, a pupil at Cardinal Griffin RC High School, was taking part as he sister Eris, aged nine, is profoundly deaf. Hermione said: “We all did it successfully and it was great fun. “We attend the support group with Eris. It helps her to play and talk in sign language to other deaf children. My mother Juliette and myself raised more than £200.” The family are among six who currently attend support meetings held at The Anchor Inn, in Chester Road, Brownhills, on the first Monday of the month from 6pm. Parking machine raiders take 20p THIEVES have struck at Cannock’s cinema for the second time in two weeks, smashing up the car park pay machine - to steal 20p. The damage caused to the pay-and-display device at The Electric Palace Picture House in Walsall Road is estimated to be in the region of £1,000. The vandals pulled out the interior workings of the apparatus. Leaseholder Graeme Cotton said: “We empty the machine every night. Parking is free on a Sunday so there would have been nothing inside, except perhaps a stray 20p from someone who didn’t realise there was no charge.” The attack on September 29 follows a burglary at the cinema on September 15 when a pair of £700 speakers were stolen along with power tools being used to give the building a six-figure facelift. Renovation work which started three months ago, has been put on hold while the new damage is put right. Staffordshire Police are investigating. Mr Cotton, aged 33, said: “To be targeted twice in a fortnight is hard to take in. We’re still counting the cost of the last attack.” Sign up for a town update RESIDENTS in Rugeley can sign up to a mailing list to receive updates on events and meetings. Councillor John Rowley, chairman of Rugeley Town Council, wants to see more members of the public at town council meetings.

It will benefit everyone. ” Anyone living in Rugeley or Brereton interested should send an email to Councillor Rowley at clerk@rugeleytown council.gov.uk Choir performs PENKRIDGE Voices choir perform in Walsall this weekend.

Opponents will tomorrow (Friday) get the chance to voice their resistance to the development, earmarked for land off Landywood Lane. Agents for the builder Ken Lees have been invited to speak at Cheslyn Hay village hall, Pinfold Lane. Cheslyn Hay parish council has arranged the meeting, which starts at 7.30pm. County councillor Kath Perry said it was a step in the right direction following an outcry about the plan. Questions “It doesn’t hurt to listen and this is a very controver¬ sial issue,” she said. She said only councillors would be allowed to put questions to the developers. Last month around 150 residents from both villages took over a parish council meeting at Great Wyrley to air their opposition. They are concerned about increased traffic, pressure on schools and the impact on wildlife. Others raise fears it would remove the last green space between Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley, destroy¬ ing the villages’ separate identities. Support for Parkinson's A NEW support group for people suffering with Parkinson’s disease has been set up in Hednesford. The first meeting of Chase Parkinson’s Group is being held on Monday, October 28 at the Aquarius Ballroom in Victoria Street. The group will meet on the last Monday of every month between 7.30-9pm.

Youngsters can play cards right in festive contest Aidan Burley MP with last year’s winner, Hannah Seaman of Bridgtown Primary SCHOOLCHILDREN have been invited to design Cannock Chase MP Aidan Burley’s Christmas card. Mr Burley has this week launched the competition, sponsored by local employment firm Pertemps People Development Group (PPDG). Since being elected in 2010, Mr Burley, has broken with the tradition of using the standard parliamentary Christmas card and instead decided to showcase the talent of schoolchildren from across the constituency. The MP has written to every Cannock Chase primary school inviting pupils to take part. The competition this year has a theme of ‘Winter Wildlife of Cannock Chase’. The winning design chosen by Mr Burley and his team will be made into a professional published card and sent as the MP’s official Christmas card to 500 recipients including local schools, businesses, charities, col¬ leagues and friends throughout the con¬ stituency - as well as the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street. The winner will have their name, age and school printed on the inside front page of the card and will also receive a framed copy of their winning effort, a certificate and a present from the House of Commons. The closing date for entries is Friday, November 8 and they can be submitted by hand or post to the MP Help Zone at 6 High Green Court, Newhall Street, Cannock, WS11 1GR. All entries should be A5 size (portrait or landscape) and drawn. Mr Burley said: “This is the fourth year in a row I have held this competition and each year I am overwhelmed by the reaction and the standard of entries. I would like to wish all of my young constituents the very best of luck.” Phil Pemble of PPDG said: “It’s becoming a tradition in schools across Cannock Chase to find the design that lands on the doormat of so many important people and one we’re delighted to be involved with.” I0p parking trial agreed to boost trade in town centres COUNCILLORS have backed plans to slash parking to a nominal lOp rate in Cannock and Rugeley. The district council’s leader claims the move could attract thousands of shoppers to town centres. The trial will run at car parks in Avon Road, Cannock and Forge Road, Rugeley. The new rate repre¬ sents a 97 per cent reduction on current prices. A meeting of Cannock Chase Council’s town centre regeneration policy develop¬ ment committee gave the proposals the go ahead on Tuesday - giving the green light for a six-month pilot to start. The fee will come in for parking after 3pm on week¬ days and will apply to drivers parking up between 3pm and when the car parks close at 6.30pm. Attracted Client base extended as company in takeover A CANNOCK firm of char¬ tered accountants has taken over a long-established prac¬ tice in Burton, and invested funds to bring it in line with its two existing offices. Rice & Co, founded more than 50 years ago, bought out Burton-based Ayre &Co, and promoted Tom Richards from their Uttoxeter office to run the office in Curzon Street. Chris Stonier, director of the company, based at Rumer Hill Business Estate, said he was delighted to have extended the firm’s client base even further. Senior employees from Ayre & Co have been retained and more accounting staff may be recruited. Mr Stonier said Rice & Co had invested significant funds following the takeover to rebrand the office and update computers, servers and software. “Ayre & Co were a well- established firm in Burton with a great reputation, and especially renowned for their work with small and growing businesses,” he said. “We feel the two com¬ panies have a similar ethos of friendly professionalism.” The trial will be launched between January and June - and district council leader George Adamson said previ¬ ous projects across the country suggested thou¬ sands of new shoppers could be attracted. Rolling out the pilot across all car parks would cost Cannock’s council at least £90,000 a year - and Councillor Adamson says that must be weighed up against the potential boost to businesses. He said: “We want to encourage as many people as possible to visit our town centres and looking at figures from other towns, there is a suggestion that the number of visitors could increase significantly.” The move comes as it emerged council bosses are predicting a £30,000 short¬ fall in parking income this year. Pupils show the red card to author Football book author Tom Palmer with pupils from Great Wyrley Performing Arts High School YOUNGSTERS showed author Tom Palmer the red card when he visited their school to talk about his football- themed books and have a kickabout. But it was all done in good humour as the pupils enjoyed his visit to Great Wyrley Performing Arts High School. Mr Palmer was at the school in Hall Lane to talk about his work and inspire pupils in their writing. He is the author of three Puffin fiction series for children: Football Academy, Foul Play and The Squad. He has also written a rugby story, Scrum! His first novel Foul Play was short¬ listed for the Blue Peter Book Award. His school visit included readings from his books and a quiz with a class¬ room penalty shoot-out using a soft ball and inflatable goal. Calendar The activities are designed to engage the children in a positive conversation about reading and writing. The workshop was rounded off with a question and answer session. Exams manager Angela Lockett said a visit by an author was part of the regular school calendar. “We invite a published writer every year,” she said. “The children are always impressed to meet a real-life author and Tom Palmer is very popular in children’s fiction.” Mr Palmer, a former librarian and milkman from Leeds, said: “Football is full of crime. I read about it in the newspapers. “But I also love going into schools. The quiz, with the penalty shoot-out, always goes down well.” NEWS in brief Football club to receive award THE Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire will present a junior football team with a top award later this month. Wyrley Juniors FC have been awarded the Queen’s Award for Voluntary Service and the crystal and scroll will be pre¬ sented by Mr Ian Dudson at 7.30pm on Monday, October 21. South Staffordshire MP Gavin Williamson has been invited to the cere¬ mony at Long Lane, Ess- ington, along with three parish council chairmen, representatives of Staffordshire FA and grant funders, school¬ teachers and past and present people involved with the club. A history of the club will be on display, while the club’s young players will form a guard of honour. Flats plan turned down by council PLANS to build flats on a prominent street corner have been rejected. An application was lodged for eight flats in place of five properties in Huntington Terrace Road, Cannock. A petition with 11 sig¬ natures and two letters of objection were lodged with Cannock Chase Council’s planning control committee. The petition cited con¬ cerns over the impact on neighbouring properties and visual impact. There were also objec¬ tions over access and members voted against the scheme despite an officer recommendation for approval. Councillor Mike Grocott said: “I am not in favour of this proposal in its present state.” Branch meeting of wildlife trust THE next Cannock Group meeting of the Stafford¬ shire Wildlife Trust will feature an illustrated talk on ‘Wild Flowers of the Austrian Alps’ by Gwen Johnson.

According to a major toy retailer, this year’s must-have is a talking doll based on the Disney cartoon show Sofia The First. Apparently, this is the story of a seven-year-old girl who has to adapt to life as a princess after her mother marries King Roland. Time was when little girls dreamt of marrying a hand¬ some prince. Now, if the modern fairytales are anything to go by, they let their single mothers do it for them. □□□□□□ BIRMINGHAM is officially the youngest city in Europe, with under-25s accounting for almost 40 per cent of the popu¬ lation, proudly declares the funky-monkey, too-cool-for- school youth charity Envision. Or, to put it another way, Brummies don’t live very long. □□□□□□ SO that’s the end of the party conference season for another year. We now know that the Tories are in favour of ‘hard¬ working families’, that Labour thinks it’s a good idea to get young people into work, and that the Liberal Democrats... sorry, I lost you there for a moment, didn’t I? One of these days somebody will stand up at one of these conferences and really put their neck on the line, declaring unequivocal support for people who can't be bothered to get up in the morning, and saying they think youth unemployment is a really good idea. But I guess until then, we will just have to resign ourselves to the fact that our politicians can only speak in platitudes. But the one striking thing about this year’s conference season is how short the confer¬ ences have become. As recently as the 1990s, the party conferences ran from Sunday to Friday, then more recently they started knocking off on Thursday. This year they were all done-and-dusted by Wednesday. Why is this? Have they run out of things to say? Or, in this age of environmental aware¬ ness, have they decided that they had better keep an eye on the amount of hot air they produce? Of course we shouldn’t com¬ plain. I doubt if there are that many people around the country who look at their televi¬ sion listings and think, ‘you know what, I would really like to hear a bit more from Harriet Harman’. But wouldn't you think, given that our politicians are all sup¬ posed to be big on ‘hardwork¬ ing families’, that they could at least stretch it until the end of the week? Stephen Sutton, aged 18 Stephen enjoys a flying lesson The teenager has done two skydives Riding a segway was also on the list Helping others is now the top of Stephen's wish list A cancer-stricken Burntwood teenager continues to tick off his dreams as he fufils them. MARION BRENNAN reports ANOTHER week, another ‘wish’ crossed off teenager Stephen Sutton’s bucket list. After being diagnosed with incurable cancer, the former A-Level student embarked on a mission to make the world a better place and to have a blast as he does so. Stephen sat down and wrote a wish list of things he wanted to do. The 46-strong inventory went viral after he published it online seven months ago. Friends and complete strangers have come forward to help him realise his dreams. A woman in Thailand paid a street artist to paint his portrait from a photo¬ graph on his site after seeing number 43 on the list. It arrived through the post. He has learned to juggle, gone busking in Bolton, surfed the crowd in a rubber dinghy at the Slam Dunk festival in and had a flying lesson. Awesome The last item wasn’t on his list but flying first-class was. He says: “I’m counting that as first-class travel because it was awesome.” He wanted to play drums in front of a huge crowd. That was ticked off after taking part in the pre-match entertain¬ ment before 90,000 football fans - and a 200 million TV audience - at the Champi¬ ons League Final at Wembley in May. He has ridden a Segway, appeared as an extra in daytime serial Doctors - ‘ironi¬ cally, I was a patient’ - and gone on a lads’ holiday to Ibiza. He is waiting to hear whether his name will appear in the Guinness Book of World Records after organising a marathon drum roll with friends. And a good time was had by all when he put his culinary skills to the test in his own ‘Come Dine With Ste’ evening. Among the more obscure items on his list, he found someone with more surgi¬ cal scars than he has, while some of the activities he enjoyed so much he did them more than once. He wanted a tattoo - he got two. He has also been to three music festivals - V, Download and Bushwhacked - and performed two skydives. The 18-year-old, who lives with his mother Jane, stepfather Tony and 21- year-old brother Chris, said: “When I was fixing up the skydive, loads of others said they wanted to do it with me. “ I decided to cap the number at 20 because there was too much organisa¬ tion involved. In the end 55 of us did it, it was crazy, and I loved it so much, I did it again.” Along the way he has met a few famous names. At Wembley to see England play Brazil, he was introduced to Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Theo Walcott and met Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor at a darts match at the NIA. He has been to CERN, the home of the hadron collider, in Switzerland, and on a separate trip to visit a friend, he gave a talk at her school and attended the end-of-year prom. As a result, the International School of Basle held a non-uniform ‘suit day’, raising £3,500. His ambition to ‘do some public speaking in front of a huge group of people’ was realised when he spoke at a charity function at No 10 Downing Street. And with around 100 of his friends, he was able to tick off number 17 when they organised a flash mob in the Bull Ring in Birmingham. However attempts to write, record and release a charity single with his old band have so far failed. “I wrote it and then we were too busy to record it. Then two months later we were provided with a recording studio but we’d all forgotten the song - and now the bass player has gone off to uni.” He has yet to breathe in Xenon, which has the opposite effect on the voice to helium, and the book, too, has been put on hold. The first signs of Stephen’s illness appeared three years ago. His father Andy has twice beaten bowel cancer and there is a history of the disease in the family but it was still a shock to the then 15-year-old to be diagnosed with ‘an old man’s disease’. The cancer quickly spread to his knee and then his pelvis before a growth was discovered in his groin. Last November, as doctors were preparing to amputate his left leg, it was discovered the disease had spread and was incurable. He found compiling the list had helped in unexpected ways. “It’s made me reassess my life and concentrate on what’s important.” Still to be ticked off are the long-haul trips - going to carnival in Brazil, visiting a famous waterfall, flying to Australia, going to the 15th-century Inca site at Machu Picchu in Peru. Original And he has yet to make a bungee jump in an exotic location or get music come¬ dian Tim Minchin to write a song for him. Stephen has also pledged to raise as much as he can for the Teenage Cancer Trust and has extending his target to £150,000 after surpassing his original goal of £100,000. The former A-star student, who was on course to become a doctor, gave up his studies at Chase Terrace Technology College to focus on his quirky list of goals. Now he says: “I don’t really care about the bucket list anymore. “It’s not so important. I really just want to help others. The important thing is fundraising. I want to raise as much money and reach as many people as pos¬ sible.” Recently he was given the accolade of Inspirational Young Person of the Year at the House of Commons in the 2013 ‘Inspire The House’ Awards run by the Kids Count charity. He was also the inau¬ gural winner of his old school’s Stephen Sutton Award for Inspiring Others which will be awarded annually. THE YEARS 1983.. . NEIL Kinnock was announced as the Labour Party's new leader, succeeding Michael Foot. The 41-year-old was the youngest Labour leader since Ramsay McDonald. Roy Hattersley, who had been a rival for the leader¬ ship, was elected as his deputy. RETIRED research scientist Cyril Knight won a reduction on his rates - by playing bingo. The 68-year-old was challenging the rateable value of his property in Codsall, which was calculated by how much it was expected to fetch in rent. “I didn't know how much reduction to go for, so I drew out a bingo number and came up with the figure of £25, which they agreed,” he said. LARRY Grayson was heading to ITV to present a new game show. He was following in the footsteps of his Generation Game predecessor Bruce Forsyth, who had quit the showto move to ITV. 1993.. . HOME Secretary Michael Howard announced 27 new measures in one of the toughest crackdowns on crime in modern times. His proposals included ending a suspect’s right to silence, creating a national system of genetic fingerprinting for all crimes, and building six new prisons. GEORGE Cole was hanging up his camel-hair coat after 14 years playing loveable rogue Arthur Daley in the hit series Minder. D-DAY hero John Howard walked along Pegasus Bridge in Normandy for the last time before it was dismantled so the canal could be widened. Major Howard won the DSO for his part in the assault in which he, along with 180 other soldiers, captured the bridge across the Orne Canal during the Second World War. 2003.. . POSTAL workers walked out of Wolverhampton’s sorting centre in protest against plans to open another mail operation in the city to ease the Christmas workload.

Now aged 75, he appeared on stage with wife Debbie McGee and enter¬ tained fans with his trademark magic tricks and cheeky humour. The bubbly star vowed that he would not give up his beloved magic while ever his fans still wanted to see him. “I will keep going as long as the people ask me,” he said. Repertoire Taking the spotlight for his ‘First Farewell tour’ Daniels is still enjoying the chance to showcase his tricks with a touch of comedy. And he says fans should not read into the name of the tour, likening himself to Status Quo and the Rolling Stones who have been doing similar ‘farewells’ for years. Ahead of last Thursday night’s show at the Prince of Wales Centre in Church Street, Cannock, where he rolled back the years with his reper¬ toire of magic, he said: “I still like doing it and people keep asking. I am just like a little boy who can’t say no. “I will keep going as long as the people ask me. That is he real thing. It is the variety of it, our office changes everyday, sometimes we are doing big venues, sometimes we are doing little venues and private parties. “I actually prefer smaller audience participation, intimacy is how I work best. I enjoy my job, it is my hobby.” The funny, cheeky side is clear to see both on and off stage. He is capable of putting on several accents including one for the Midlands. “It is one of the easiest ones, all you have to do is keep your back teeth closed,” he says. He was in Cannock with his biggest fan - wife Debbie McGee. Handkerchief She said: “He loves entertaining, he is the sort of person that if he is in a queue buying packet of polos he will make people laugh.” The magician achieved interna¬ tional fame through his television series The Paul Daniels Magic Show which ran on the BBC from 1979 to 1994 after making his TV debut on Opportunity Knocks in 1970. Part of his Prince of Wales perform¬ ance was a handkerchief changing colour and a number of card tricks. There were some more typical acts of sliding metal rods into a box contain¬ ing his partner McGee. But his most impressive trick was saved until last, when a £20 marked by a member of the audience ended up inside a candle and had to be cut open. • Wilde-Page 38 THE CHRONICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10 2013 Page 7 Windows & Conservatories A Trur FanDy Rai Ccnjurv Tnda$ F.f 28 Tup FULL MONTY CONSERVATORY Inc In s 3m.

B M BALL Cannock LETTERS to the Editor POST Cannock & Rugeley Chronicle, Chronicle Editorial, 51-53 Queen Street, Wolverhampton, WV11ES Letters should be brief and MUST include name, address and telephone number of the writer. The Editor reserves the right to condense letters. E-MAIL cannock.chron@ expressandstar.co.uk Town’s oldest house was a farm building RE: The article of September 13 concerning the oldest house in Hednesford. I believe this was West Cannock Farm, Brindley Heath, formerly Humphrey Morton’s house. Mentioned in the mid 1500s about beating the bounds between Lichfield and Cannock, it records leaving Hazel Slade and following Bentley Brook to the Rugeley Road then passing the front door of Humphrey Morton’s house to the Cank Thorn near First Lodge. When my grandmother died in 1942 our family moved into West Cannock Farm. I helped with the demolition of the stables and granary when the farmhouse was extended in the early 50s. The woodwork was Elizabethan with wooden dowels to hold them together with no foundations just sand¬ stone blocks placed on the soil and then house bricks on top. The farm house which should have been listed was demol¬ ished to make way for housing in the late 1970s. IAN DUNFORD Hednesford Let’s act in the war on drugs NEWS from the asylum: Durham Chief Constable Mike Barton believes we should de-criminalise Class A drugs as this will rob crim¬ inal gangs of their finance. A bit like ending prohibi¬ tion in the States completely ended their Mafia problem! The truth is they wouldn’t go away, they’d move on to something else that we haven’t thought of. Further, the Chief Consta¬ ble believes these drugs should be available on the NHS. There are currently cancer drugs which are unavailable on the NHS due to their cost. I wonder where he thinks the money and the drugs would come from? Will we grow them ourselves or buy them off the drugs cartels, perhaps for a bulk discount? The only way to deal with this problem is to sack people like this and replace them with people with the guts to realise we are fight¬ ing a war against drugs and to act accordingly. CHRIS BATES Burntwood All that’s missing is school and shops RE: the articles regarding the project of building houses in Landywood Lane Great Wyrley by KGL Estates. Mrs Preece, of Landywood Lane, has only lived in the village for three months, Mr Lees and his family have lived here for more than 80 years and have done a lot of good, with his brother Percy doing charity work and playing the piano accordion for various charities and the church. His sister Stella also has done charity work and supported the church. Ken Lees himself has donated a much-needed new ceme¬ tery for the communities of Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay. On the proposed development he is also donating much- needed allotments for the area. Many of the protesters are living in the houses that Mr Lees built in the first place. This can only be good for the community and I hope it goes ahead.The only thing missing is a school and shops. MRS L FOSTER Great Wyrley Brilliant concert at a wonderful venue I WAS lucky enough to be present on September 27 at the Aquarius for a brilliant concert at a wonderful venue. Songbirds in Harmony were excellent and were ably sup¬ ported by the Bridgtown Concert Show Band and the DJ Dance Academy.

Also pictured are his family, wife Debra 46, son Jacob, 17 and daughter Grace, 12 A FATHER-of-two has his friends to thank for saving his life - after he suffered a heart attack while playing football. Dave Betteridge, aged 46, of Armitage Road, Rugeley, collapsed just moments after scoring an equalising goal for his six-a-side team Trotters. Friends and team-mates Glyn Betts and Matt Inns rushed to his aid and administered first aid until paramedics arrived. The trained first aiders took it in turns doing mouth-to mouth resuscita¬ tion and compressions during a 10 minute period. Mr Betteridge, who works at Rugeley Power Station, was then taken to Walsall Manor Hospital where he has remained for care while awaiting a triple by-pass operation. Dropped It happened on September 12 as he played on the astroturf at the Erasmus Darwin Academy in Chasetown. After scoring, Mr Betteridge slowly dropped to the floor. Team mates, including son Jacob, initially thought it was a joke. Wolves fan Mr Betteridge has hailed his pals for saving his life. “I personally can’t remember much about the event,” he said. “Apparently I got the ball and scored, which was a bit of a shock itself, and that was when I collapsed. The next thing I remember is waking up here at Walsall Manor. “They saved my life, there is no doubt about that. Without those two I wouldn’t be here now. I owe them a massive debt of gratitude.” FULLY FITTED FROM £750.00 . inc VAT ^ VAST RANGE OF COMPOSITE DOORS ■=> Create the right impression c> Energy efficient ■=> Excellent security WINDOWS Latest energy rated windows available NOW!

Second World War veteran Alex Franks’ gripping tales of wartime horror have been immortalised in print. Now aged 93, Mr Franks signed copies of his self-penned novel Non- combatant, at Cannock Library, in Manor Avenue. Mr Franks was an ambulance driver with the legendary 7th Armoured Divi¬ sion, The Desert Rats. Despite never firing a gun during his time in North Africa, he was captured by enemy forces and thrown into a con¬ centration camp. Great-grandfather- of six Mr Franks, of Wheaton Aston, lived to tell the tale and arrived back home in May 1945. He said: “When I got back from the war people told me just to forget about it but I couldn’t. I used to have night¬ mares about the horrors.” It wasn’t until the late 1980s that he finally put pen to paper and started writing his memoirs. Whisky It features the story of his capture by the Italians at El Agheila in Libya and being aboard the Italian ship Ariosto SS which was bombed by the British and sank in February 1942. He said: “Around 300 of us were kept below deck without food or water. “The ship was torpedoed by the British. I went looking for some food in the crews’ quarters. I found a life jacket and some Scotch whisky, which I drank with some other men. When the ship was going down I knew I had to jump in the water. “The water was freezing. I managed to swim to a nearby Italian ship and was pulled aboard.” Mr Franks had to wait two decades until his book was published after Midland advertising guru Trevor Beattie decided to fund its release. Widower Mr Franks, whose wife Irene died in 2009, signed copies of the book, which is selling for £20. All pro¬ ceeds from sales of the book will go to The Red Cross. He added: “I managed to sell six copies at the weekend. I printed 300 and I’m down to my last 20 or so now.” Frank tale of a Desert Rat is brought to book I BUILT-IN SINGLE MULTIFUNCTION OVEN WITHOUT TRADE IN £429.99 £50 TRADE IN TRADE IN PRICE £ 379.99 I BUILT-IN 7KG 1600 SPIN WASHER WITHOUT TRADE IN £549.99 too TRADE IN TRADE IN PRICE £ 519.99 s BUILT-IN DOUBLE OVEN WITHOUT TRADE IN £529.99 HO TRADE IN TRADE IN PRICE £ 499.99 Page 12 THE CHRONICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10 2013 QUALITY OAK PINE & PAINTED FURNITURE www.expressandstar.com/free-editions Mass ive Choice of iFurniture On Show Our Best Selling Milan Range 100% f£399‘ Solid Oak All prices reduced instore Designer Zenn Chunky Oak Range, made from 100% Solid Oak 1 Large Sideboard [New container prices - Buy Direct Save £££ Insto re only - Web prices vary Our Rustic Oak Collection v ssr t JILL is 100% ^ToZ r £389* Solid Oak 0akTops fLarge Sideboard * An prices reduced instore Fantastic T Wo Storey Sho wroom Regency Stunning rTJ range made on premises Reclaimed/Sawn range made on premises Britannia Pine pecialists in Bespoke Oak, Pine and Painted Furniture ’ Opening Hours Mon-Sat 9am-5pm Sundays and Bank Holidays 10am-4pm Unit 9b, A5 Waning Street Business Park, Cannock, Staffs i WS1 1 9XG Shop online @ www.

Bandmates reunite for tribute show to drummer FORMER Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher will play with an old bandmate for the first time in 13 years at a one-off charity concert. It has been organised by the Charlatans in memory of their drummer Jon Brookes, from Burntwood, who died after battling a brain tumour, aged 44. The gig at the Royal l . Drummer Jon Brookes MP in call over risk of diabetes CANNOCK Chase MP Aidan Burley has backed a campaign by Diabetes UK to reach the seven million people in the UK who are at high risk of Type 2 diabetes. The Conservative MP is urging his constituents to have their risk of the condi¬ tion checked. The Diabetes UK cam¬ paign aims to help people understand the seriousness of Type 2 diabetes, which can lead to devastating health complications such as amputation, blindness and stroke, so that people under¬ stand the importance of pre¬ venting it. People can check risks by visiting the website www.diabetes.org.uk/ris kscore, by visiting a phar¬ macy or by going to their GP Mr Burley said: “There are many people in Cannock Chase who are at high risk of the condition or already have it. “It is important that these people get assessed.” Albert Hall on October 18 is being held as a tribute to the to the popular musician and well-known Baggies fan. It will raise money for The Brain Tumour Charity. As well as a headline set by The Charlatans, the show will feature Liam Gallagher performing with members of Beady Eye and guitarist Paul ‘Bonehead’ Arthurs, an original member of Oasis who left in 2000. Arthurs has not played with either Gallagher brother since the split. Manic Street Preachers singer James Dean Brad- field will also perform solo, while the Chemical Brothers will DJ in between. Benefit A statement released by the band ahead of the show said: “Following the loss of our much-missed friend and drummer, Jon Brookes we, together with some friends, are putting on a show at the Royal Albert Hall. “The show will benefit The Brain Tumour Charity, which Jon was involved with during his illness.” More than 200 mourners attended the father-of- three’s funeral at Christ Church in Burntwood. Guests included Mr Brookes’s friend and West Bromwich Albion defender Jonas Olsson. Father-of-three Brookes was a founding member of the iconic Britpop band. Fronted by Tim Burgess, the band was formed in Walsall in 1989. Car wash refused AN application for a hand car wash on the site of the Jubilee pub in Pye Green Road, Cannock, has been thrown out by the district council’s planning control committee. Funding treat served up for church helpers A HEDNESFORD church is now better equipped to serve up a treat for the needy. Trinity Pop-In, based within the Methodist Church in Station Road, is run by volunteers who cook and serve 80 lunches every Wednesday and Thursday. Meals are free but users are asked to contribute what they can towards the cost. The volunteers’ task has been made easier thanks to funding from the Tesco Charity Trust. The town council added its own £400 to the charity’s £1,000 donation and the money will be spent on professional cooking range and oven. The Pop-In provides an opportunity for people to meet and socialise and also houses a foodbank. www.expressandstar.com/free-editions THE CHRONICLE, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 10 2013 Page 13 conservwow es Police have licence to check on regulations t • Wi • ¥ 'ft From left, Julie Turner, environmental enforcement officer for Cannock Chase Council, Councillor Carl Bennett, environment leader and Pc Andrew Frost POLICE and council officials have joined forces to ensure late-night premises and taxis are compliant with licensing regulations. The licensing operation has been carried out in Cannock and Rugeley, where officers have targeted late-night prem¬ ises by scrutinising licensing conditions, reviewing incident records and CCTVJ checking licence holders and door staff badges and clamping down on under-age drinking, drunk¬ enness and drugs. Smoking The operation, part of the wider Operation Safer Nights Initiative, highlighted the lack of fire safety risk assess¬ ments and record-keeping at licensed premises. In addition, a number of taxi drivers were found to be smoking within their vehicles and were issued with Fixed Penalty Notices. Councillor Carl Bennett, environment portfolio holder, said: “We work closely with landlords and taxi drivers to ensure they are fully compliant to licensing regulations. These operations are part of a wider initiative to ensure night time revellers can enjoy a safe night out within their local area. ” Chief Inspector, Carl Ratcliffe, Cannock Chase Local Policing Team said: “We work closely with other agencies to ensure that the licensing laws are adhered to.” New store granted an extension to its hours A SUPERMARKET that opened just over a month ago has been allowed to extend its operating hours - despite objections from neighbours. The Tesco Express store in Stafford Road, Cannock opened at the end of August. Its hours were 9am-10pm H by |_ aura B | yth but bosses applied to open ■----- two hours earlier and until 11pm in the evenings. Planning chiefs at Cannock Chase Council gave the application the go-ahead at a committee meeting last week. Noise It comes after neighbours raised concerns about increased noise in the morn¬ ings and late at night. One resident living oppo¬ site the store, who wrote to the council, said: “My concern at the change would be the amount of noise this would create early and late at night. “Whether due to lorries delivering or customers on the car park with their cars still running and shouting and talking so late at night.” Plans to the council sub¬ mitted by the agent GL Hearn stated: “The varia¬ tion to the planning permis¬ sion is necessary for the intended end user, Tesco Express, to operate from the unit in order to meet the aspirational requirements of the customers who expect a store of this size to operate during convenient times. “The proposed opening hours are a standard feature of convenience stories of this size.” Thousands of shoppers flocked to the grand opening of the Tesco Express which created 15 jobs. The chain has also opened two other stores recently, an new 80,000sq ft building in Hednesford which is the cor¬ nerstone of the town’s £50 million transformation and 40,000sq ft shop in Rugeley. heritage & arts ENTERTAINMENT CANNOCK CHASE at the PRINCE OF WALES THEATRE Box Office: 01543 578762 OCIOBEK OCIOBEK ~ wlct. o rg/p ri nce-of-wa les NEWS CLASSIC CLAPTON Friday 25th 7.30pm £16.00 BUDDY AND THE KILLER TRIBUTE TO BUDDY HOLLY AND JERRY LEE LEWIS Sunday 27th 7.30pm £16.00 Ballet Theatre UK present THE NUTCRACKER Thursday 24th 7.30pm • £17.50 £15.50 Concessions, £10.00 (Under 16s) LEO McKEOWN'S BAY CITY ROLLERS SHOW Saturday 26th 7.30pm • £19.50 £17.50 Concessions # 1 # CARDINAL HOME IMPROVEMENTS www.cardinalhomeimprovements.co.uk OPEN WEEKEND This Friday/Saturday/Sunday! 10am - 5pm ULTRaf RamJ HE new 'TgsS&SSSP ULTRAFRAME ‘UVIN ROOM’ Find \"the key to the door” to WIN £500 towards your home improvements!

The councillors visited the Lichfield and Burntwood Vocational Centre in Burntwood. The £2.5 million facility opened in 2011 and offers vocational skills training and edu¬ cation to 14-to-19-year-olds. Because of changes in funding arrangements, it needs to increase its activity to thrive. Councillor Woodward, Labour’s Shadow Cabinet member for Learning & Skills, said: “It’s a fantastic facility and I was concerned to hear about the pressures it is under. I asked Ben to visit the centre with me as we both want to see a thriving skills training sector.” The councillors met the Partnership Board for the Skills Centre about their concerns and all parties will hold a further meeting in November. Bridges will be rebuilt in rail upgrade TWENTY-four railway bridges will either be rebuilt or modified as part of the electrifica¬ tion of the Chase Line. Network Rail is currently carrying out feasibility studies of the structures along 15 miles of the Walsall to Rugeley track. The overall £30 million electrification scheme is due to be completed by 2017. It will see the installation of 15 miles of overhead cables. Diesel trains will also be replaced by electric ones. Option Network Rail project manager Mokhtar Moh¬ ammed said: “We are carry¬ ing out feasibility studies across the whole route. There are 24 junctions with bridges we are looking at. “We will go with the most cost-effective option. We should know more within a month.” Mr Mohammed said the road bridges would either be rebuilt or the track sunk into the ground so power lines could run through the bridges. Around £1. lm is currently being invested in the Station Road bridge, Hednesford, and is scheduled to be carried out between January B by Laura Blyth and April with a road closure in force. A further £800,000 is due to be spent on Walkers Rise, in Hednesford, during the same period. Diversions will be in place for drivers while work is carried out. Events to showcase the plans have been held, and at a consultation event at Cannock Civic centre in Beecroft Road, the overall project was backed by Western Springs councillor Mick Grocott, from Rugeley. He said: “If it means more efficiency and shorter journey I am in support. It will encourage people to use the trains. “People who use the trains are welcoming it.” Rail bosses have promised long-term benefits such as boosting capacity, reducing carbon emissions and cutting the cost of running the railway. They hope it will also encourage more passen¬ gers onto trains. Work to fix roof at church WORK costing £2,000 to fix a leaking roof at a Cannock church has taken place. The Rev Edward Sakwe, of Chadsmoor Methodist Church, said: “We’ve had a leakage in the roof so these works were necessary. It is costing about £2,000.” The church, in Cannock Road, Chadsmoor, cele¬ brated its centenary year in 2011. Each November parish¬ ioners celebrate the church’s birthday with a weekend of activities. There will be a number of special services and fundraising events there on November 2 and 3. www.expressandstar.com/free-editions NEWS Four-and-a-half-year term for prolific burglar Canvas for charity campaign Alisha Kirkham, from Cannock, whose paintings will be on "
