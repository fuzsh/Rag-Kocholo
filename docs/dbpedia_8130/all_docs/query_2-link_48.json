        "text": "St. Martin's Church and St. John's Church\n\nTiptonâs original parish church was St. Martinâs in Upper Church Lane, Summerhill. The church has since been rebuilt and is now dedicated to St. John. The old church was built in the 13th or 14th century, close to the old village. The church tower is more modern and appears to have been built as a later addition, or as a replacement for an earlier structure. It has a sundial that carries the inscription âThis steeple was built anno domini 1683 â John Nightingale, William Clare, Church Wardensâ. In 1965 excavations were carried out around the old church building and the tower to examine the foundations. They were found to be about three feet deep and constructed from the same stone as the building itself, which suggests that there was probably not an earlier building on the site. The parsonage nearby, now long gone, was surrounded by a moat.\n\nIn 1552 the County Commissioners were making an inventory of all the articles in use in all churches. This was part of King Henry VIIIâs reformation, following an Act of 1545. In 1547 another Act was passed that allowed the young King Edward VI to continue the work of his predecessor. The Commissioners would confiscate articles that were then sold to raise funds for national defence. The inventory taken at St. Martinâs in 1552 lists the following: a silver chalice or wine cup, a silver plate for Eucharistic bread, robes made from Bruges satin and serge, Eucharistic robes, towels, alter coverings, a lamp, a cross, two brass candlesticks, two white metal jars to hold wine and water, a small Sanctus bell, and three bells in the tower. The commissioners took everything except the four bells, some linen, and the curateâs surplice.\n\nIn June 1650 the Commonwealth Commissioners carried out the following survey of the church property and its value:\n\nValue\n\nThe parsonage with a little moat, including an orchard garden, a yard, a barn, and a stable. Â£2 per year. A recently erected little cottage next to the parsonage orchard, occupied rent free by William Davies. 3s.4d. per year. Four and a half acres of land next to the church, known as Brook Leasow. Â£2 per year. Five and three quarter acres of land, near the church, known\n\nas Middle Leasow. Â£2.10s. Five acres of land known as Well Leasow. Â£3.10s. Three acres of land near the church. Â£1.3s.4d. Three acres of land next to Brook Leasow. Â£1.3s.4d. Three and a half acres of land known as Moat Close. Â£2.3s.4d. A little croft next to Moat Close containing one and a quarter acres of land. 8s.4d. Half an acre of land known as Crabb Croft. 2s.0d. Six and three quarter acres of rough coppice containing some oak trees, and a cottage occupied by Richard Nightingale who pays 25 shillings a year rent. Â£2.10s.\n\nTotal\n\nÂ£17.13s.8d.\n\nTythe of hay\n\nÂ£50.00 per year.\n\nWood on the coppice ground\n\nÂ£6.00.\n\nReserved rent\n\nÂ£3.6s.8d.\n\nThomas Shaw, who became curate in 1761 described the local conditions as follows:\n\nThe church was built to cater for the original village, but as Tipton expanded, the small building was unable to cope with the increasing size of the congregation. By the middle of the 18th century it was in a bad state of repair, both externally and internally, and was now some distance from the centre of Tipton, which had grown to the south of the old village. Thomas Shaw, the church wardens, and the principal inhabitants felt that something had to be urgently done to resolve the situation. They appealed for financial assistance to enable them to either rebuild an extended church on the existing site, or preferably build a new church nearer to the town centre. They made their case in several documents that were sent to eligible benefactors. The documents describe their desperate situation, as can be seen from the following two examples, from December 1762.\n\nEventually sufficient money was raised to build a new church, and in February 1794 Sir Edward Littleton presented a petition to the House of Commons that resulted in an Act being passed to allow the building of a new church, and the disposal of materials from the old church.\n\nThe following advert appeared in Aris's Birmingham Gazette on 29th January, 1798:\n\nThe replacement church was built in Lower Church Lane, nearly a mile south east of the original building, nearer to the town centre. The new St. Martinâs was erected in 1795 to 1797 by J. Keyte of Kidderminster at a cost of Â£1,400. The whole project including a large burial ground was completed at a cost of Â£5,000. The main building is rectangular in plan and had a nave, with galleries on three sides, and an organ in the west gallery. On the eastern side is an arch leading to a small chancel. At the west end is a semi-circular bell tower, with a circular domed top. Because of this the building became known as âthe pepper potâ. It is a plain Italian styled building, built in brick and externally rendered. There was an eagle lectern and an octagonal stone pulpit in the church, and a vestry in the tower.\n\nThe new church. From an old postcard.\n\nThe âpepper potâ top of the bell tower was removed in 1965. The building lay derelict for some years, until it was converted for residential use in 2007. The conversion featured in a Channel 4 television programme called âGrand Designsâ. The burial ground, which is still there today, is in Lower Church Lane, between St. Martinâs Primary School and Churchyard Road.\n\nAnother view of the church. Also from an old postcard.\n\nIn the early years of the nineteenth century the land around the original St. Martinâs Church was leased, and an Act was passed to allow coal mining to take place on the site. The first mining lease dated 25th March, 1803 was obtained by John Read of Valley, near Bromsgrove, for Â£20,040.12s.6d. for a term of 50 years, and at a rate of Â£550 per acre. At the time the old church was occupied by Charles Kemp, and still occasionally used for services and burials. In about 1820 the southern wall was blown inwards by a fierce gale, and by the 1840s the roof had gone, as had much of the external stone walls.\n\nIn 1849 a vestry meeting was called to consider the state of the old church, and the best way to re-build the church to make it useable again. A committee was formed to consider the problem, and on 18th May, 1849 Mr. William Wilday was asked to take down the remaining stonework, clear rubble from the building and inspect the foundations. On 2nd June he presented an account of the work he had carried out to the committee. The work included building foundation walls to improve the foundations so that they could support a building with walls 8ft. high, the building of a boundary wall, and some repairs to the stonework in the tower. He also laid several feet of ash in places to fill-in holes caused by subsidence from the coal mines.\n\nSt. Markâs Church, Ocker Hill Road, Ocker Hill\n\nOcker Hill Parish was formed on 8th August, 1845, and the first curate, Rev. Lionel William Stanton was appointed on 16th of May, 1846. The first services were held in a school that stood on the south eastern corner of the site where the church was later built. Plans were immediately made for the building of a church and the raising of funds for its construction. All of the wealthy local inhabitants were asked to subscribe to the project, which raised around Â£1,050. A grant of Â£600 was received from the Lichfield Diocesan Church Extension Society, a grant of Â£250 was received from the Church Commissions, and the Incorporated Society gave Â£300. Nearly an acre of land and was given by Wyrley Birch, Lord of the Manor.\n\nThe church was built in 1849 to 1850 by Hamilton and Saunders of Wolverhampton. The total cost of the project amounted to around Â£2,500, so a further Â£300 had to be raised. The church was built of blue bricks in decorated Gothic style, with a nave, a clerestory, two aisles, and an exposed bell under a bell-cote. The building was consecrated on 13th November 1849, and could seat 600 people. This included seats in a gallery at the back of the church which was later dismantled.\n\nSt. Mark's Church. From an old postcard.\n\nWithin a few years the building began to suffer from structural problems caused by subsidence, resulting from the underlying coal mines. A tower should have been added to the building, but this was abandoned because of the unstable land. In 1860 a survey was carried out by Smallman and Smith, Architects and Surveyors of Stourbridge. They found that due to subsidence there was settlement in the five windows on the north aisle, the roof at the north east end of the aisle had parted from the wall, so letting-in rain water, and daylight could be seen through cracks in the nave arches and the clerestory windows.\n\nIt was also found that the pillars carrying the arches on the south side of the nave were leaning, so the surveyors thought that further problems would soon materialise. They suggested that the whole building was starting to lean towards the north. A law suit to gain compensation from the Moat Colliery Company followed, and restoration work on the church was carried out.\n\nIn 1890 an appeal raised Â£700 for further repairs to the building, and another appeal for Â£1,000 was made, which paid for the re-roofing of the north aisle. Although the coal mines were closing around that time, the building continued to suffer from subsidence for a long period. It was later strengthened, and a new vestry was built. In 1910 restoration work was carried out on the chancel, and a new organ chamber was added. At the end of World War One a memorial to the men of the parish who died in the war, was fitted to the east wall.\n\nFrom the 1851 edition of William White's History, Directory and Gazetteer of Staffordshire.\n\nThe Church of St. Martin and St. Paul, Owen Street\n\nThe church was built as a chapel of ease for St Martinâs Church in 1837 to 1838 and dedicated to St. Paul. It was designed by Robert Ebbles, and built of red brick in Early English style, with a tower at the front, a nave, a chancel, aisles, and a gallery running round three sides of the church. Originally the building could seat 1,322 people, and cost over Â£5,000 to build, which was raised by subscriptions and grants.\n\nIn 1843 the new parish of St. Paul was created, and in 1870 a stone, Gothic font was given by a parishioner. In 1899 a vestry was added. Modifications were made in 1985 when a false ceiling was inserted to reduce the expense of heating, and two parish rooms were built at the rear of the nave. The work also included the addition of a western gallery, and toilets and a kitchen on the ground floor.\n\nWhen St. Martinâs Church closed in 1986, the two parishes combined and the church became known as St. Martin's and St. Paul's. The building was Grade: II listed on 1st December, 2015.\n\nFrom the 1851 edition of William White's History, Directory and Gazetteer of Staffordshire.\n\nSt. Matthew's Church, Dudley Road\n\nThe church was built in brick in Early English style in 1881 and designed by J. H. Gibbons. It consists of a nave with a clerestory, a lower two-storey west porch, a lower chancel, two narrow aisles, a north vestry, and a tower (with a bell) to the south-east. It cost nearly Â£6,000 to build, which was raised by subscription. Subscribers included Lord Dudley. As built, the church seated 478 people. A substantial vicarage was built next to the church at a cost of about Â£1,600. The building was Grade II listed on 29th September, 1987.\n\nSt. Matthew's Church. From an old postcard.\n\nSt. Michael's Church, Tividale Road\n\nOne of the most prominent buildings in Tividale Road was St. Michaelâs Church with its impressive tower, which could be seen from many parts of the area. In the early 1870s a mission room was made from two cottages that were converted for the purpose, and a committee was formed to consider and plan the building of a church. Money for the project was raised by subscription, and a suitable piece of land on which to build the church was soon obtained.\n\nThe building was designed by Davis and Middleton, and built in 1877 to 1878 by Mr. Everall, of Malvern. The foundation stone was laid on 8th January, 1877, and the consecration ceremony took place on July 13th, 1878. The building, built of brick in Early English style cost around Â£8,000, and was considered to be one of the finest churches in the area. It consisted of a nave, 59 feet wide by 100 feet long, a chancel, a tower, and could seat 800 people. A vicarage was later built next door, and in 1891 a new organ was installed.\n\nThe original St. Michael's Church. From an old postcard.\n\nUnfortunately the building began to suffer from serious structural problems which eventually led to its demolition in 1994. In 1996 the existing replacement church, lying back from the road was completed.\n\nFrom an old postcard.\n\nWesleyan Church, Park Lane\n\nWesleyan Methodism was very popular in the Black Country, and the exploits of John Wesley and his brother Charles have become a legend. It is not so well known that both brothers preached in Tipton. The following extracts are from John Wesleyâs Journal:\n\nIn the1750s a preaching house was built at Tipton and given to Wesley by James Jones, one of his followers. Wesley kept the building until 1786. The first Wesleyan chapel at Tipton was established by John Wesley himself in July 1786 in Park Lane. Within a few years it proved to be too small and so it was replaced by a larger building on the same site, which opened on 3rd December, 1809. This building also became too small and so it was considerably enlarged in 1827 at a cost of Â£1,249.0s.2d. An organ was installed in 1846, and in 1848 the building was licensed so that marriages could take place there.\n\nBy this time the building was beginning to suffer from subsidence due to the intense coal mining. The building became unsafe, and run-down due to its age. After a few years the subsidence seemed to settle down, so it was considered to be safe to replace the building with a much larger structure."
