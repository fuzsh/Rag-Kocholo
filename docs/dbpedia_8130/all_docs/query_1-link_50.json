I thoroughly enjoyed meeting residents and it was such a special parade and service.\n\n“I would like to offer Cllr Phillip Leason my huge congratulations and best wishes as he embarks on his new role as Stone Town’s Mayor. I know he will represent the interests of the community and his passion as well as his dedication to the town makes him a perfect choice as Mayor.”"
