        "text": "Gavin Williamson, MP for South Staffordshire, visited Pattingham last week for the Third Scarecrow Festival.\n\nThe Festival ran from Friday 25th to Sunday 27th of September in the village of Pattingham and featured a ‘scarecrow trail’ starting at the Village Hall and taking in most roads in the village, with individual scarecrows displayed in gardens and various other locations, with the local church St Chad's, playing a central role.\n\nThe scarecrows were inspired by many different themes, with a display dedicated to the Royal family and characters from Alice in Wonderland, Frozen and Minions all featured in the display of 130 scarecrows that were displayed around Pattingham, the biggest entry since the Festival began.\n\nResidents were encouraged to make their own scarecrow with bags of straw provided as well as clothes that had been donated by the village Drama Group.\n\nThe event was first organised by members of St Chad’s Church in 2011 but has not been held since 2013, when 10,000 visitors descended on the village to enjoy the display.\n\nCommenting on the Festival Gavin said: “The sight of the scarecrows was truly wonderful. You could see how much effort was put into making each and every scarecrow.\n\n“The festival was an overwhelming success with so many creative designs, I would not be surprised if more than 10,000 visitors came to enjoy the weather and the spectacular display.\n\n“The event really took the entire community into account and residents should be extremely proud of their efforts.”"
