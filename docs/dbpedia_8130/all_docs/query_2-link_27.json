        "text": "RE is for everyone! At Landywood, it is our intent to build religiously literate young people. Our curriculum is designed to engage, inspire, challenge and encourage pupils, equipping them with the knowledge and skills to answer challenging questions, explore different religious beliefs, values and traditions and develop a more rigorous understanding of the numerous religious traditions, beliefs and practices that are followed in our multi-cultural society.\n\nRemembrance Day\n\nWe commemorated Remembrance Day through a poignant whole school assembly. We were honoured to have been joined by an active serviceman, who read a poem in the assembly and shared experiences of serving in the Military. All of our children made a poppy which was laid out at the front of the school, in our Remembrance Garden. A group of children also visited Waters Edge Care Home, to meet with residents and present them with some and crafted poppies.\n\nChristmas Celebrations\n\nAll of our children took part in a Christmas performance. Our EYFS children performed a version of the Nativity. KS1 children took part in a Christingle Service with Rev. Monica. KS2 children went to St Mark's church for a Carol Service, where they sang a variety of Christmas carols and songs to their parents and carers."
