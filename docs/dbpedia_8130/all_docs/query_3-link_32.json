If You Follow The Route All The Way Around You Can Stop At The Steam Engine Train Station For A Drink . There Is Cafes And Toilets Near The Car Park . Car Park Is £1 For 2 Hours Or £3 For All Day . They Have A Little Craft Shop And A Ice Cream Shop. The Walk Is Mainly Gravelled Until You Get To The Woodland Area .\n\nWalsall\n\nLancashire\n\n1.93 miles\n\nOily Goughs Is A Site That We Have Done Lots Of Work On Recently. After A Series Of Amphibian Surveys (To Make Sure There Were No Protected Species On Site), We Have Reprofiled The Pond At The Southern End Of The Site. It Had Been Very Overgrown With Reeds, And Was Almost Completely Dried Up This Year. After Relocating Some Fish And Other Animals, We Scraped A New Profile For The Pond, Which Should Refill Over The Winter And Look Fabulous By Summer 2012! There Are Two Other Pools Ate Oily Goughs (Which Was Named After A Man Named Gough Who Used To Sell Scrap Oil On The Site Many Years Ago!).\n\nCaravan\n\n13 Willenhall Ln\n\nWalsall\n\nLancashire\n\nWS2 7NN\n\n3.12 miles\n\nThere Is No Parking For This Park, So You Have To Park On The Opposite Side Of The Road Next To The School. There Is A Wooden Nature Reserve Sign That Is Visible From The Kerb Side So You Will Not Miss It. I Would Recommend Dogs On Leads From The Car To The Big Field Which They Are Free To Run Wild.\n\nRough Wood Is Made Up Of A Series Of Pools In The Middle Of The Oldest And Largest Woodland In Walsall (Rough Wood Represents About 10% Of The Oak Woodland Within The West Midlands). Its A Great Place To Go For A Wander To Lose Yourself In Nature For A While - The Old Oaks And Lovely Sunny Clearings Are Full Of Wildlife, From Nesting Woodland Birds, As Well As Toads, Frogs, Two Species Of Newt, And Lots Of Woodland Insects. The Site Is Separated From Bentley Haye (To The South) By The Wyrley And Essington Canal. Here At Countryside Services We Work With British Waterways To Survey The Aquatic Plants In The Canal Each Summer.\n\n76 Woodside Way\n\nWillenhall\n\nWV12 5NH\n\n3.44 miles"
