        "text": "Their onsite services at Staffordshire Record Office have recently been paused to allow them to temporarily relocate as part first stage of the Staffordshire History Centre project. This exciting heritage project will create modern facilities, bring together three incredible collections and create exciting and imaginative ways to connect Staffordshire people and their stories. You can find updates about the project on their website Onsite access is a limited service for statutory legal or other time sensitive requirements, where no digital or remote service is suitable. Each request will be carefully considered by staff against set criteria. If your request meets the criteria for public access their team will arrange an appointment for you The onsite access will be on a Friday afternoon and located in Stafford town centre, a short distance from Staffordshire Record Office Their staff will continue to run an enquiry service and are able to signpost to the most suitable resources Please be aware that all services will be dependent on changing levels of access to the collections during the building project and two weeksâ€™ notice will be needed for production of documents from other sites They will review access on a regular basis and welcome feedback from service users\n\nARCHON code: 169"
