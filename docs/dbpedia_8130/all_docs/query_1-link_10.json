        "text": "This is, after the introduction and the first section on the Wyrley area prior to the Great War, the second section on Great Wyrley and the Great War; it examines, in two parts, the war months of 1914. These two parts, of which this is the second, look at the initial responses in Wyrley, Cheslyn Hay and other areas, to recruitment, fund-raising, food economy, as well as local support and understanding of the war, along with its views of the foe. Please remember, as per the introduction, the evidence used is not confined to Great Wyrley, and military, along with national, events are used for context.\n\n1914: The War Months\n\nThe Local Home Front: Feeling the Pinch\n\nWhile the food problem would become acute over time, as it must be remembered that over 60% of the food consumed in Britain was imported (80% of wheat, for bread) by 1914, and even though DORA prohibited the feeding of bread to animals, it was initially not so much about shortages of food than the rising price of it. The first problem to tackle was that of hoarding as people over-purchased due to panic and so stock quickly became depleted – with the result that prices went up due to demand. The Cannock Courier addressed the problems of panic buying and hoarding in its 8 August edition, expressing satisfaction that the Government would be addressing them shortly; the Government started tamely, however, by warning against hoarding and by letting it be known that the next crops of barley and wheat promised ‘an abundant yield.’\n\nAs allegations began to fly that some foodstuffs were deliberately held back by distributors and retailers to create price increases, the Government started to fix prices for certain items; granulated sugar at under 4d per pound, for example. Price fixing dealt, in the short term, with an issue that was probably more despised than the Germans – that of profiteering – and many local businesses, like Salmon’s of Chadsmoor, Cannock and Bridgtown, were very eager in their newspaper adverts to distance themselves from such accusations by pointing out that they purchased in bulk to gain a better deal for the customer, and so were not hoarding but just seeking a reasonable profit. Horniman’s tea, a national brand, took out advertisements in the Cannock papers stating that their prices remained at pre-war levels.\n\nOne other form of profiteering was to make your foodstuffs go further by adulterating them in some way: on 29 August, the Cannock Advertiser reported on a Cannock milkman, Job Arrowsmith, who was fined a whopping £5 for watering down his skimmed milk by 26% and his full-fat milk by 19%; Edward Coombs, also from Cannock, adulterated by just 17% and got away with a fine of just £1. It may seem that playing with milk would not make the dairyman that much money, however, by 5 September the Cannock Advertiser was printing letters from the ‘annoyed’ of the area over the fact that milk had increased in price by 4d a quart (a rise of 33% since the war started).\n\nPrice fixing, at this stage, would eventually be abandoned as it could not work due to the continual knock-on effects of the war. For example, many agricultural labourers on the farms joined-up and so this created a shortage of labour – which was compounded by the fact that many of the horses used on the farms and in transportation had been requisitioned as well – while other complications that forced up prices were the lack of easily available fertiliser and that railway traffic was reduced due to Government needs (which took them over) and the British Army.\n\nThe mass theft of foodstuffs was not really a concern at this point as no epidemic was reported in the local press, and a scan through the cases that appeared before the Cannock Magistrate show that there were few prosecutions during 1914, which is likely not much different from the previous year: there was an incident were plums went missing at Hednesford Station, one of a Shareshill farmer being robbed of some eggs (eggs also went up in price and, as we shall see, became the focus of a national campaign), and couple of instances of a few pigeons being swiped by young lads and, in one case, by an inebriated miner that offered the apprehending policeman his half-crown fine to save any hassle.\n\nFood economy was very real though, and it can be demonstrated through the Cannock Advertiser’s Ladies Column – a column dedicated to fashion, recipes and domesticity that would have had, no matter how popular it might have been, the Pankhursts rolling their eyes. On 8 August the column had a recipe for a lemon souffle – an egg-based dish that would have skyrocketed in price to bake within weeks; by the end of the year the column was advocating the cheaper cuts of meat to be used in recipes as the price of meat ‘is so dear.’\n\nThere were, of course, other items that became more expensive as they became harder to get hold of as the war continued. One, perhaps not thought of, was paper. Until the 12 September edition of the Cannock Advertiser, the newspaper consisted of 8 pages, with 5 columns to the page; after, due to the near exhausted supply at the paper mill of John Mitchell & Sons, Clitheroe, Lancashire, the paper was reduced to 4 pages, with 6 columns and smaller print, until the Christmas editions.\n\nThe Local Home Front: Supporting the War Effort\n\nWhile the military was one hive of activity during 1914’s war months, along with recruitment to replace those that went to war from vital services such as the police, another hive of activity was the organisation of the civilian population to create a supportive infrastructure through the setting-up of committees to facilitate the raising of money for charitable funds, the manufacturing of garments for soldier or prisoner of war comforts and, finally, the collection and re-distribution of other useful materials such as blankets, bandages and cigarettes for the same purpose.\n\nIt is important to remember that when war exploded there were all kinds of charities already operating (the Great Wyrley Hospital Fund, for example) and these did not simply disappear, however, donations to these were going to be hit as the main fundraising thrust went towards the war effort. We shall look at the main funds created in 1914: the National Relief Fund, the British Red Cross Fund and the Belgian Relief Fund.\n\nWithin days of the war starting Edward, Prince of Wales, started what was called the National Relief Fund (as often called the Prince of Wales Fund); its purpose was to assist in civic distress – those brought down financially by the war – by giving money or help in kind. The appeal was taken-up by both of the Cannock District Councils, and they convened meetings with local parish councillors, trades council, local employers, and union representatives amongst others, in order to organise a funding network and so both Councils each formed a Distress Committee in the August.\n\nThe British Red Cross were also swift to act, with a preliminary meeting held in Cannock on 7 August that saw Nurse Wheeler, who went to the front not long after, explain the workings of the Red Cross Society. The Staffordshire branch were then making appeals through the newspapers, and the basic Red Cross patterns for requested clothing (like bed jackets) were being printed in the Courier in the 22 August edition due to the current lack of availability of the pattern books proper as they were over-subscribed.\n\nAs the Rural District Council left most of the distress organisation to the Parish Councils, Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay would both set up their own mini-Committees for the National Relief Fund and the Red Cross within a few weeks. With the Relief Fund, the District Councils would pay any monies raised to the county fund but would, especially the Cannock Urban District Council, print weekly totals raised in the newspapers. The Cannock Urban District Council totals show the initial popularity, then the slowing of donations to the Fund: for example, by the end of August over £240 had been raised; by the end of September, £589; by the middle of October, perhaps at its zenith, the fund stood at around £700; and by Christmas it was at around £850.\n\nOne reason for this slowing was that other funds started to emerge as worthy causes, some of which are discussed briefly here, while another reason was that the fund was not a panacea for all those in need: the Cannock Chase and Pelsall miners had raised over £1000 themselves by 19 September and initially were going to send it all to the National Relief Fund, but decided to keep some back for both the Red Cross and the Soldiers and Sailors War Fund as dependents could be better served through that fund; there would also be a growing frustration over the bureaucracy of the National Relief Fund over the latter months of the year. Money raised by the British Red Cross would, it is assumed, go to the county branch, whereas donated items would go to a regional depot or direct to the military.\n\nHelp could be given in kind: the Rink Cinema at Hednesford allowed the wives and children of servicemen free admission on Tuesday evenings, for example. Money, as with all funds, was either raised through collections (flag days, in the street or door-to-door) or by putting on shows and other events. As early as 15 August, Cannock Town FC played an internal practice match between the ‘reds’ and the ‘whites’ and the £2 taken from admissions was paid to the Relief Fund. On 5 September a ‘Great Military Night’ had been undertaken, also for the Relief Fund, at the Cannock Hippodrome with films, music, ‘Carlo – the conjuring miner’ and a demonstration by 200 boy scouts. A more regular event was hosted monthly by the Hednesford and District Philharmonic at the Drill Hall in Hednesford. The Soldiers and Sailors War Fund was their chosen charity on this occasion.\n\nThe war brought forward many individuals that worked tirelessly either in committees or using their skills, such as musical talent, for the war effort (or for war relief). It is the failure of this work not to be able to pick them all out, but they cared little about moving from place to place in using their talents to assist. Those on committees will be looked at later, but musically the Hednesford and District Philharmonic was where the indefatigable Laurence Hawkins, a Cheslyn Hay musician that became the Great Wyrley St Marks’ organist after the war, opened his philanthropic account (Hawkins was joined by the Cheslyn Hay Lyric Quartet, for example). Great Wyrley’s Dennis Woodhouse, a violin virtuoso, would be another that performed with the Hednesford Philharmonic. Dennis, was at least on one occasion accompanied on the piano by his brother ‘Reggie;’ Reggie would later be killed when his ship war torpedoed in the Irish Sea.\n\nSuch people are wonderfully summed-up by Mr Phillips, the manager of the Cannock Hippodrome, and his Great Dane, Don, who simply toured the Cannock area raising money for various funds and collecting cigarettes for soldier comforts; Phillips draped Don in the Union flag and got him to pull a mini-Red Cross ambulance cart through the streets. Don, who must have had the patience of a Saint Bernard, was obviously not distracted by other dogs! Don had raised £20 by the end of the year.\n\nThe final fund to look at is the Belgium Refugee Fund. The fund was established swiftly but it was not until 5 September that Father O’Donnell, of St Patrick’s in Walsall, began to appeal in the press for help as 50 Belgian children had arrived in Birmingham and he sought accommodation for them (he had already received 20 offers). On 19 October, 32 Belgian refugees (30 men and 2 women) arrived at Cannock and many were accommodated in the workhouse (although a sister and two brothers, whose father had been shot in front of their eyes, were accommodated in the house of Mr Traviss); they were received with cheers, according to the papers, by a crowd both in the Market Place and on the approaches to the railway station. The refugees were hosted at various entertainments, large and small, where they sometimes contributed a song or their national anthem to proceedings. By the end of the year, some of the men had joined-up and some had found appropriate work.\n\nThe rate that the local Cannock Belgian Refugee Fund increased can mirror the rate that the National Relief Fund slowed and this may be a statement about keeping money local: the Fund stood at £54 by the end of October, but within a fortnight it was at £166; it had increased to £214 by the end of November, £250 by the first week in December and £263 at the time of the last mention of the year on 19 December.\n\nBusiness as Usual: Great Wyrley, Landywood and Cheslyn Hay\n\nTaking into consideration the enormous upheaval in those initial months of the war, let us now examine in more detail what happened in the Great Wyrley area in late 1914. On 3 August, Great Wyrley was perhaps still buzzing over the sale of a large portion of the Sutherland family estate that had taken place a few days before, while on 4 August itself, the Great Wyrley Horticultural Society elected to hold their annual festival – after all, so much planning had gone into it. The local children were likely as happy as could be on that day, but this would be less over their understanding of the war than the schools being closed from 31 July to 31 August for what the newspaper said was a whooping cough epidemic; there may be some truth to this, but the laconic entries in the Landywood School logbooks just said the school closed for ‘Summer vacation.’\n\nIt is difficult to know what the reaction of people in Great Wyrley was to the news of the declaration of war, but the Courier reported two pieces in its 8 August edition that, exaggeration considered, may give an insight. The first is measured, and refers to the mood in Cannock: ‘It was generally conceded that it would have been better could England have observed strict neutrality in the crisis, but after the action of the Germans in regard to Belgium the most stern and unbending Puritan there was no help for it but to do the best.’ The second claims a member of the local police called in at the Landywood Club (Harrisons) and asked: ‘if any of those present were prepared to serve their King and Country… there was an enthusiastic spirit observable and the National Anthem, Rule Britannia and other patriotic songs were rendered. It appears that there will be little difficulty in raising the men that the Premier asks for, if the whole of the country is permeated as this district, with a patriotic desire to do what is right.’\n\nThere are no accounts as to whether people congregated anywhere in anticipation or excitement, although this must have been difficult in a township that is so dispersed and had no real focal point as Great Wyrley – it is possible some may have made their way to the Market Place in Cannock where some news may have been heard, especially as, according to the Courier, posters were pasted on the bandstand and the Council House ordering a ‘rapid mobilization’ that night.\n\nWhatever the response, it is impossible to believe it was not the hot topic of conversation in the Wyrley pubs that night, which likely spilled outside after last orders if what was reported about Hednesford can be translated to Great Wyrley: ‘the streets were occupied more or less by the friends of the territorials who had so suddenly been called up… After the closing of the inns which had evidently done good business, the people continued their gossip in the streets and thoroughfares.’\n\nThe opening months of the war were, in truth, that hive of organisational activity already mentioned with regard to the initial military response, the beginning of a recruitment campaign (and the propaganda elements that goes with it), the establishment of a volunteer support network to raise money and materials for the war effort (including charities), and to take over the duties of men destined to attest or to be recalled to the colours.\n\nLet us start with the call to arms. The opening months of the war would proportionately provide the largest rate in depopulation of the war, as men were called to service or willingly joined-up. The Regular Reservists and Special Reservists were called-up and the first editions of the local papers enthusiastically printed the names of those that went to join or re-join their regiments: William Mears from the South Staffordshire Regiment and Joseph Masters from the Worcestershire Regiment were two Great Wyrley men (Masters worked in Great Wyrley, but lived in Cheslyn Hay) so named. The Territorials were not mentioned in the newspapers by name, but were called by various means to their appropriate mustering points.\n\nWilliam Harrison’s 2nd North Midland Field Group, Royal Engineers, in which many Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay men served, were in a different situation as they were on camp at St. Asaph on 2 August. They were recalled and were back in the area on 4 August, setting-up headquarters at their drill hall at Norton Canes (Norton Hall). Over 30 of them were out purchasing horses in Cannock on that and the following day: 5 horses from the Co-op, 5 from the Urban District Council and several from Wootton’s Timber Yard in Bridgtown, but no doubt others were accrued from the farms and businesses around Great Wyrley. These animals were stabled at the Hall. The Field Group then headed to Derby, before heading to camp at Luton in September. Once on the move the Territorials, well those old enough (at 19 years) and those that were deemed physically fit enough, would be asked if they were prepared to serve abroad – those that agreed would be sent over to the continent in early 1915, while those that did not remained in Blighty until home service was abolished in 1916.\n\nAfter the initial call-up of those that owed some military allegiance and those rushing to join the colours there followed a period of healthy, but declining recruitment in South Staffordshire for the rest of 1914. We have a few figures for recruitment that give some insight into local mentality: after around three months of the conflict, it was reported in the Cannock Advertiser (7 November) that 43 men had joined-up from Great Wyrley, where as in the following edition it was claimed that 100 men had joined up form Cheslyn Hay; it was further claimed that by the end of the year 1.5% of the county had joined up since August – this would mean that Great Wyrley was actually underperforming with 43 out of a population of over 7000 (making around 0.6%, although this was only early November) while Cheslyn Hay, with 100 out of a population over 3000 (so around 3% by November), was possibly the most patriotic village in Britain.\n\nCheslyn Hay Parish Council, according to the Cannock Advertiser on 19 December, started a Roll of Honour and posted the names of the attested around the village – showing them again at the vanguard of patriotism; yet, and this may have more to do with the time of year than anything, it is interesting to note that at a recruitment meeting chaired by Colonel Williamson at the Salem Church, which must of attracted interest from Cheslyn Hay, Great Wyrley and Landywood, and which was reported in the same edition as the roll of honour, only met with four volunteers.\n\nOther than the Government’s separation allowances, local employers also did not stand in the way of men that sought to join-up – indeed, a number also encouraged it until it became clear that the skill-base was being diluted, productivity fell and the war effort actually suffered. A number of local companies offered incentives to their workers: for example, in the August, Whitehouse Bros in Bridgtown announced that their employees would contribute fortnightly, at a rate of 6d per man and 3d per boy, to the National Relief Fund for the duration of the war, while the firm had decided ‘to pay the rents of the houses in which the families of those who had been called to the colours and who were employees of these works reside;’ at the same time, Great Wyrley Colliery Company offered a coal allowance to a recruited employee’s family and a gift of 10s a week to the wife of such; while in September, Gilpin’s at Churchbridge offered to keep jobs open for those that attested, with the additional bonus of £1 from the company and another £1 paid by the directors upon attestation.\n\nIn the first months of the war a Volunteer Training Corps battalion had been formed in Walsall and they were about 400 strong by the end of the year; while in Cannock, by September, and bringing back those memories of the shooting teams, a rifle club had been formed that aimed to teach young men to shoot before they were old enough to join-up. This club met at the Athletic ground and there was a ‘no drill, no shoot’ principle laid down on formation.\n\nThe Cannock VTC, which would include members from Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay, was born around Christmas 1914 from the rifle club and the Walsall VTC. The Cannock Advertiser reported that Colonel Williamson has agreed to act as the Corps military advisor, and that the Corps would undertake any task asked of it; it also, unreservedly, sought to shame the young men that had not yet attested or the over-protective parents that had prevented them. It also advertised that help to purchase uniforms and equipment was offered.\n\nThere was an alternative to joining the VTC, a non-military one, if someone wanted to render service for the war effort yet not carry a gun – and while it was voluntary to enrol, they were remunerated. This call would be for helping the emergency services, for as early as 15 August there were appeals in the Cannock Advertiser for former firemen to return to service and, with members of the police force already signing-up, and to prevent stopping those that wanted to go, a volunteer constabulary was sought. As such, volunteer constables – called Special Constables – were sworn in to bolster the regulars, with the constables committing to a certain number of hours service in which they undertook general policing duties or guarding vulnerable targets. While they would enjoy the same powers as the regular police, initially, as with the VTC, they simply wore an armband to identify their status.\n\nBy October there were 300 Specials in the Cannock division. On 28 November, at the Salem church in Cheslyn Hay, a number of Specials were sworn in for the local area: E. Dunn, A. Bradbury, A. Saxon, H. Simms, S. Brough, J. Smallman, A. Bloor, J. Humphreys, T. Plant, J. Bradford, W. Glover, T. Rogers and R.L. Pointon were all sworn in for Great Wyrley, along with 17 men for Cheslyn Hay and 7 for Newtown (including Landywood sub-postmaster George Henry Stretton). It is hard to trace people when just an initial is given and when the last census was undertaken in 1911, and it is also possible that some of these men lived outside of Wyrley (after all Stretton served neighbouring Newton despite living in Landywood), but one of these men, Ralph Lowe Pointon, is traceable.\n\nRalph Lowe Pointon was born in Goldenhill, Wolstanton, in 1883. He would be raised by his mother as his father, Ralph (a former earthenware manufacturer and possibly a one-time policeman), passed away in 1889. By the age of 17 he appears on the Wolstanton census as a blacksmith’s striker, and then in 1909 he married Mary Ann Hickin in West Bromwich. In 1911 the couple are living in Gorsy Lane, Landywood; Ralph is a blacksmith, stated as ‘above ground,’ in one of the local collieries. It is likely, due to his work, that he was in a reserved occupation – at least at the start of the war – which is why, at 28 years of age, he became a Special. He may well have been called-up later, but he does not appear on the memorial gate lists for those that served, but this is likely due to the fact that he had already left Great Wyrley by the time the lists were compiled. Ralph and Mary were in Handsworth in 1922, and then emigrated to New Zealand in 1923. Ralph died in Blenheim, New Zealand, in 1949; Mary Ann joined him in 1965.\n\nThe reaction of the local clergy to the opening of the conflict is interesting. It may be expected that ministers of God, along with their congregations, would be opposed to the war out of Christian duty, however, this was not the necessarily the case; while war was abhorrent, the Rev. A Kirk, of St. Paul’s in Bridgtown, summarises what other clergy (Rev. O Thomas, of Chadsmoor and the Rev. DL Evans of the Cannock Congregationalist Church) felt when he said that while he deeply deplores the present conflict, they were fighting a just cause. The incumbent of Great Wyrley, the Liberal Rev. Shapurji Edalji, does not seem to appear in the newspapers with any opinions, and it is assumed simply carried on administering to his congregation in a ‘business as usual’ kind of way. The incumbent of St Luke’s’, Cannock, the Rev. L Price, also believed in the righteous cause, but he is reported in the Cannock Advertiser on 5 September calling on the ‘many slackers,’ to either join-up or help out in some way.\n\nWhatever Edalji thought on the justness of the cause it would be wrong to suggest he and his wife, Charlotte, distanced themselves from the war, for Charlotte became the Honorary President of the Red Cross Committee for both Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay when they were formed. Ultimately, the level of support that each minister and congregation gave was a matter for their own conscience, but there were clear differences from parish to parish and minister to minister likely depending heavily on their politics. The Methodist New Connexion Salem Chapel in Cheslyn Hay, under the auspices of the Revered A Colbech, was not only a centre for spiritual and community support as soon as the war started, but was one for the collecting and distribution of materials and fundraising for the war effort – despite lay venues being available – and it had no compunction in allowing recruitment meetings for the district to take place there.\n\nIn previous wars – the Crimean being an example – churches would, especially following a military reverse or a significant event, undertake a day of humility; that is a day of prayer (along with the shutting of shops), to ask God to intercede. After the start of the Great War, many intercession services, daily even, were organised. On 7 September, an open-air one took place in the Market Place, Cannock, which was attended by, it was claimed, 2000 people. The Cannock ministers mentioned above were also joined by T. Hunter, a Primitive Methodist minister, and, again, the just cause was advocated and the help of God sought.\n\nIt would be wrong to think the morality of the war would simply be left down to the clergy to interpret for the masses; morality was also a political issue and even the Cannock Liberal and Labour Club held their own debate on the subject, however, with the Conservatives supporting the war, the Liberals having taken Britain into it, the coup de grace would come on 10 November when the Labour politician Will Crooks came to address what was the latest in a string of recruitment and war explanation meetings held at the New Hall in Cannock. Crooks, supported by various political and military ‘gentlemen,’ through his lot in with the war effort and stated he would rather see England ‘blotted out’ than live under the Kaiser. It would be a brave person to be an outspoken conscientious objector in Great Wyrley after this.\n\nWhen it comes to local support for the war effort Cheslyn Hay organised themselves more quickly than Great Wyrley, especially in the setting-up their British Red Cross Committee. It had been formed at a meeting of the ladies, of which it was comprised, at the village Primitive Methodist church on 24 August. The committee, which consisted of Mrs Edalji, Mrs Colbeck and the indomitable Mrs Gertrude Wynn, amongst others, were duly formed and within a week were raising funds and sewing garments: by 7 September (printed in the Courier 12 September) it appears they had raised £18, with 40 ladies engaged in sewing and 9 ladies acting as collectors (presumably of both money and materials); and by 3 October, 12 nightshirts, 7 bedjackets, 4 helpless shirts, 21 pairs of socks, 8 blankets and bandages had been contributed.\n\nThe local Distress Committees (also called Relief Committees), followed the Cheslyn Hay Red Cross Committee by a week or so. Great Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay had representation, Great Wyrley in the form of John and Walter Simkin, at the Cannock Rural District Council’s inaugural Distress Committee meeting on 28 August. Cheslyn Hay actually appointed official representatives to the District Committee at this meeting, whereas Great Wyrley held back likely as Walter Simkin was due to be called-up.\n\nCheslyn Hay’s local Distress Committee was then formed on 31 August, just days before that of Great Wyrley on 2 September. These smaller committees fed into the Rural District Council’s Committee. The Great Wyrley Committee was formed at the Parish Council’s ordinary monthly meeting and consisted of the whole of Parish Council along with co-opted members such as Guy Burnett, the managing director at Gilpin’s, and Mr John Simkin, who was to cover the position of his son as parish clerk as he was about to re-join the colours. It was decided, at the same meeting, to approach the ladies of the village to form a Great Wyrley British Red Cross Committee.\n\nOn Tuesday 8 September, Alice Henshall, the wife of Albert Henshall who was both the Headmaster of Landywood School and the chair of the Parish Council, formed the Great Wyrley Red Cross Committee. Again, Mrs Edalji acted as honorary president, while Mrs Mincher was secretary and Mrs Garratt became the treasurer. The Committee raised over £3 in the first few weeks as they sought to canvass support and form a more effective group. At the 7 October monthly Parish Council meeting, Mrs Henshall reported that, after a house-to-house visitation, over 200 ladies had agreed to subscribe monthly (as it was felt that this way ‘the branch could render the most useful assistance.’) As such, September alone raised £7 16s 3d and collected several bandages, while October raised £8 13s 6d.\n\nOn 10 September the Great Wyrley Distress Committee, with guest speaker Guy Burnett, held two meetings. The first, at Landywood School, was attended by around 50 parishioners, and sought to explain the organisation of the National Relief Fund and the set-up of the Relief/Distress Committees. They then appointed William Crutchley and George Hemmingsley as Landywood’s representatives to the Rural District Council’s Distress Committee. The second meeting took place at Great Wyrley School, and offered the same explanations over the Fund and saw William, husband of Mrs Garratt of the Red Cross Committee, and John Garratt appointed as representatives to the higher Committee.\n\nThe most direct methods to raise money locally were by means of collections or through entertainments. Bridgtown employed both, with 160 people attending a whist drive and dance at the Institute on 8 October in aid of the Red Cross, for example, and gathering an exceptional £11 11s in a door-to-door collection on 31 October for the same purpose. Great Wyrley also used both, it raised its Red Cross contributions through collections, but the Horticultural Society were one local organisation that hosted regular whist drives and dances at the Great Wyrley school for different charitable enterprises. Cheslyn Hay seemed to arrange more events and collections, but also were enterprising in other ways – so, for example, the Cheslyn Hay Red Cross Committee raise over £14 in a rummage sale at St George’s Hall in mid-October.\n\nOctober to December saw the entertaining of, and raising money for, the Belgian refugees. It is interesting to take a look at the Great Wyrley Horticultural Society’s October whist drive and dance to see what it comprised of, and just how cosmopolitan these events were. Over 130 people attended, with a whist competition comprised of 20 hands to start. There were prizes for both the ladies and gentlemen winners and runners-up. The compere for the evening was a Mr George Pearson from Bridgtown, and the music for the dance afterward was performed by another Cheslyn Hay stalwart for such events, Mrs Gertrude Whitehouse. Around £7 was raised. Similarly, smaller venues also hosted events such as the Swan Inn, Great Wyrley, on 19 December; here patriotic songs and the national anthems were sung to Landywood’s Enoch Jones accompaniment on the piano, and no doubt much humour supplied from the compere – the Great Wyrley parish councillor, George Goodwin.\n\nSimilarly, Cheslyn Hay Workingmen’s Club hosted a music night for the refugees on 18 November where, while several of the contributors were from Cannock, Cheslyn Hay’s Cannock Town FC forward, Joe Wesley, rendered a version of ‘Tipperary’. A few months later he would enlist. On 30 November, the Nelson Inn in Cheslyn Hay hosted a smoking concert, supported by the same Enoch Jones, for ‘the boys at the front.’ The publicans were Benjamin and Lucy Potts, while Andrew R Knox was the compere; the Potts’ went on to lose a nephew (who listed his uncle as his next of kin on his attestation) and had a son invalided out of the army in 1917; Knox would be killed in 1915.\n\nThese fundraising emphatically shows how residents from the local villages went to each other’s events, either to contribute to the running of it or simply to enjoy it. Further, those from wider areas came into the village to raise money themselves: a good example of this is our lovable pooch Don; this Great Dane, his pet owner in encumbrance, visited Bridgtown, Cheslyn Hay and Great Wyrley on 3 October, and helped raise some £1 16s 6d and 84 cigarettes for the Red Cross.\n\nThe ‘business as usual’ approach was of course never going to happen if the country became embroiled in a protracted military campaign that mobilised the home front, which the Great War did. Saying that, despite DORA and the intensive change in the military, humanitarian and later economic landscapes, some aspects of life would appear to be the same for a period of time at least: as such, on 5 August the local men still went down the pit or to the factory, the women still organised the household, the schools would re-open after the 5 weeks holiday and, most importantly, the pubs stayed open.\n\nIndeed, over that first summer month it is likely that other than the soldiers actually shipped over to France the closest that anyone in the Wyrley/Cheslyn Hay area got to any kind of shooting were three unfortunate lads named Potts, Ward and Hawkins; the boys, aged between 8 and 11 years, decided, despite warnings, to chase rabbits near Campions Wood and received pellet wounds from the guns of a shooting party stalking the said rabbits. The Courier offered sympathy to the parents of the boys rather than the boys themselves, but believed the affair acted as ‘a lesson to the boys that in future they should do as they are told.’\n\nThe Great Wyrley Parish Council, as shown by their minutes, were in the unenviable position of having to meet enormous new challenges while maintaining a ‘business as usual’ approach. Added to this, the Council lost their parish clerk, one Walter Simkin, who was both in the Territorials and in Luton by the time the monthly meeting took place on 5 September; indeed, Simkin’s absence had seen the annual hospital parade put back until the October.\n\nThe general business, as opposed to war business, undertaken by the Council throughout the 1914 war months would focus on: the woeful state of the fire brigade uniforms and their area of jurisdiction, as well as a dangerous corner at Bentons Lane in September; the need to widen Wharwell Lane and the scolding of a Mr Hill (indeed, fining) for altering an inscription on a gravestone without permission in October; the purchase of 10 pairs of fire brigade trousers, a new water main to feed the Council property in Old Falls, as the water was currently unfit, and a new tramway between the Nook and the Plant pits in November; while December would see discussion on allotment arrears, fire brigade staffing and the delay to the new Walsall to Cannock bus service (agreement had been reached over the provision of a Walsall to Cannock bus service and six buses had been ordered – but owing to the war none had been forthcoming by December as they had been needed elsewhere) resulting in Councillor Goodwin, with his usual humour, remarking it is still ‘a long way to Tipperary.’\n\nThe realisation that the war could be used as a selling point was not slow in coming; local retailers, an example being clothing company Hollands of Hednesford, started to use the war in their Cannock Advertiser advertisements to sell their products; Hollands did this in a tasteful way, after all it was still 1914, by drawing attention to the fact they stocked socks, blankets and other wares that could be sent to individual servicemen or charitable institutions like the Red Cross.\n\nThe struggle to maintain ‘business as usual’ can be highlighted by Great Wyrley’s problems with recruitment for its fire brigade; men came and went all the time, but it was reported at the Council meeting in December that three members of the brigade, Turner, Holloway and Whitehouse had left to join the colours. Local sports were another example of this struggle, as over the first month or so the local cricket and bowls teams would continue as these were summer games and the war was new, however, as football is a winter game and while the Cannock Chase and the Birmingham Combination football leagues would continue, players would slowly start to drift away to join the army: Charlie Moore and Joe Wesley, two Cannock Town players from Cheslyn Hay, would just see out 1914 before they went.\n\nLandywood School’s approach to the start of the war, or more accurately that of the headmaster, Mr Henshall, was cut very much from the cloth of the ‘business as usual’ – and to begin with that was fine. Henshall would become incredibly involved locally with the war effort, not least as he was chair of the Parish Council, but here he seems to keep all possible mention of the war out of the school logbooks as it did not directly affect the day-to-day operation of it.\n\nHenshall’s problems in 1914 stemmed from three main sources – staffing, pupil illness and the weather: staffing problems would entail the general sickness of the staff, the usual Landywood problem of staffing changing (Miss Cartwright started in the December, easing the problem), but also helping to provide cover when needed – such as to Cheslyn Hay Boys School in the September; illness was not only about re-arranging classes for staff absences – and the school was continually short by at least one staff member from September 1914 until 11 January 1915 – but the continual reporting of students with infectious diseases, such as mumps, reared its head from mid-October onwards and ended-up with the school closing for two weeks on 20 November in an attempt to slow the infection; the weather caused mayhem as well as, portentously, on 11 November a heavy storm caused poor attendance and the continual gloomy weather led to the discovery that many of the oil lamps were without wicks.\n\nTo conclude this reflection on the busy war months of 1914, it seems that Great Wyrley had a response to the war that was typical of many villages with that mix of business as usual, men heading to war as they were either obliged to or out of patriotism, local men joining the Specials or the VTC, the appointing of delegates to a Distress Committee, the organising of the local ladies into a Red Cross Committee and running general events to help the war effort. Great Wyrley was, however, put in the shade by Cheslyn Hay’s response to the war and this cannot be purely put down to the fact that Cheslyn Hay promoted itself better in the newspapers – which it undoubtably did – for, other than painting the Salem Church red, white and blue in a blazing symbol of patriotism, they formed committees sooner, raised more money, sent more men off to the conflict, hosted recruitment meetings and many, many more events."
