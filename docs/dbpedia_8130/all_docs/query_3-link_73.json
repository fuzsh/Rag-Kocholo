        "text": "Sir Gavin Williamson joined Essington Parish Council for their Celebration of Service in the Community awards.\n\nSir Gavin attended the awards ceremony, which takes place annually in St John’s Church, Essington, to recognise those who work hard to maintain the heart of village life, going over and above for their neighbours around them. The service enables those good Samaritans to feel appreciated and pulls the community together. Reverend Helen Duckett lead the service with hymns, and others in the parish council, James Morris and Kris Markiewicz, provided refreshments and flowers for the congregation. Sir Gavin was pleased to be given the honour of presenting the awards.\n\nSir Gavin said: “It was a real privilege to be asked to present the awards to those in Essington who have demonstrated such humility, generosity of spirit, and selflessness for those in their community. I was pleased to see that so many awards were presented, as there are so many in Essington that have proven themselves to uphold these community values. Essington remains a village where neighbourly commitments are strong, and it is great to see that people look after each other. I would like to thank the Reverend Helen Duckett for her wonderful service, and Essington Parish Council for arranging such an uplifting event.”"
