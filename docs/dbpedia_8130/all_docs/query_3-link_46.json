The Booth family regularly moved from place to place as William Booth's ministry necessitated until the family finally settled in London in 1865. Bramwell Booth was involved in The Salvation Army right from its origins as the obscure Christian Mission, established in Whitechapel in 1865, into an international organization with numerous and varied social activities. He was educated at home, briefly at a preparatory school and at the City of London School, where he was bullied.[1]\n\nSarah not shown as servant for him on 1901 Census:-\n\nName Bramwell W Booth\n\nRelation to Head of Family Head\n\nAge Last Birthday 45\n\nSex Male\n\nProfession or Occupation Chief Staff Salvation Army\n\nEmployment Status\n\nCondition as to Marriage Married\n\nWhere Born Halifax Yorks\n\nAddress The Homestead Hadley Crescent\n\nCivil Parish Enfield\n\nRural District\n\nTown or Village or Hamlet Enfield\n\nEcclesiastical Parish Christ Church\n\nParliamentary Borough or Division Enfield\n\nCounty Borough, Municipal Borough or Urban District Enfield\n\nAdministrative County Middlesex\n\nWard of Municipal Borough or Urban District Chase & Bulls Cross\n\nLanguage\n\nTo all above.\n\nYes the Edith Emma Perks born in 1900 who lived with the Norths in the 1901 census and was then adopted by the Boulton's is my Grandmother the daughter of Sarah Perks. There is no father's name on my Grandmothers birth certificate although one appears on her marriage certificate.\n\nI guessed at Sarah's year of birth. There are a couple of possibilities for births in 1877 of 1878.\n\nI cannot find any record of Sarah working for any part of the Booth family in 1901. I have a bible that was given to Sarah in Feb 1912 signed by a member of the Booth family. The Salvation Army believe the signature to belong to Florence Booth.\n\nFurther to the above Florence Booth was living in Hadley Wood Enfield Middlesex in 1912. there is another bible of Sarah's in the family signed by Catherine Bramwell Booth on Dec 15th 1938 so I am sure that my great Grandmother did work for the family. Does this help anyone any further?\n\nPerchino\n\nthat definitely sounds promising. Can you please resend the link directly to my email account [email protected] Alternatively if you can give me the date from the newsletter I will contact them directly. I have only recently started getting the Cheslyn Hay Historical Society newsletter.\n\nThank you for your help it is greatly appreciated.\n\nSandra"
