From the middle of next week it will cost £1 for two hours or £3 a day to park at the beauty spot. Annual passes costing £36 will be available - working out at 9p per day. The introduction of the fees has met a mixed reaction from visitors, with some saying they will ‘happily pay’ and others calling the intro¬ duction of parking charges ‘a sad day’. Nikki White said: “I will happily pay. It’s a beautiful, well kept place and that is down to the staff and rangers. “I live within walking distance but regularly drive to take the dog or kids’ bikes. Let’s face it, it’s pennies they’re asking for. If you don’t want to pay, don’t go. Quite simple really!” Tom Glibbery also backed the move, saying: “I think Chasewater is a wonderful resource and well worth £36 a year, especially if the money is all retained by Chasewater for main¬ tenance.” Emma Trow added: “At the end of the day Chasewater is council owned and run. Care “Councils are cutting back on everything but places like Chasewater are hit the hardest be¬ cause they are classed as non-priority compared to other sectors. So it’s either you don’t pay to park and it turns into a wasteland because no- one will be there to run it and take care of it, or you pay a small fee to park to keep it nice and open for everyone to use still. I know which one I’d rather have!” However, Justine Russell was disappointed with the charges, saying: “So sad there’s not many places you can just turn up, park and enjoy, and now you’ve done the same to Chase¬ water. Sad day.” The plan for the charges was unveiled last year as the latest part of Staffordshire County Council’s countryside estates review which aims to cut £700,000 from its allocated £1.5 million annual budget. A Chasewater statement said people will be charged to park from 8am to 6pm, adding: “From midweek next week (commencing May 21) the car parking machines are being commis¬ sioned into service.” FIREFIGHTERS have been tackling a blaze after piles of rubber and wood went up in flames at a recycling centre in Great Wyrley. The fire broke out at the site in Hazel Lane just before 1pm on Monday. Crews from Cannock fire station and an¬ other from Bloxwich fire station were called to the scene. They used a compressed air foam system to extinguish the fire and were still at the scene dealing with the incident hours later. A Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson said: “It is at a recycling prem¬ ises and the fire is believed to involve wood and rubber products.” It is not yet known how it started. Elsewhere, firefighters spent 24 hours tack¬ ling a ‘deliberate’ large fire at Gentleshaw Common. Fire crews were called to reports of a blaze at about 2.20pm on Sunday and throughout the afternoon. It was brought under control by 5.30pm. Firefighters then continued to monitor the area for potential ‘hotspots’ throughout the night. They remained at the incident until 2.30pm the following day. RETAIL Vow to push ahead with outlet village A COUNCIL leader has vowed to push on with a new £160 million outlet village fol¬ lowing election success - and plans are being looked at for an engineering college. Cannock Chase Council leader George Adamson said the retail scheme is a key priority for the district. Labour maintained its grip of the council during the recent local elections, and now Councillor Adamson has said bosses are keen to push on with work at the complex. He said: “We are looking forward to it opening in 2020. “We are also looking to set up an en¬ gineering college as soon as we can. We have a lack of certain skills in the area MEMORIAL Campaign to bring mining wheel home A CAMPAIGN to raise £100,000 to¬ wards returning an iconic mining wheel back to the former Littleton Colliery site 25 years after the pit closed has been launched. Huntington Parish Council is ap¬ pealing for donations to support the Huntington Memorial Garden project, which will see the huge wheel relo¬ cated to the centre of the village. • Full report - Page 20 ACCIDENT A5 is blocked by three-car crash THREE cars were involved in a crash on the A5 in Staffordshire.

The white domestic duck, which was discovered on April 21, was the second to be injured on a pond in Hednesford. A member of the public spotted the duck’s plight and called the RSPCA, and animal collection of¬ ficer (ACO) Catherine Strawford rescued the injured creature. It is believed a group of four ducks were abandoned in the The injured duck is recovering from its ordeal area. One was rescued from fish¬ ing litter by the animal charity and is now recovering. A second, who also suffered fishing litter injuries, was sadly put to sleep. ACO Strawford is still trying to locate the other two to bring them to safety. She said: “The duck was very lethargic and trapped in fishing line in the middle of the pond. It was very distressed and desper¬ ately trying to get free. “Eventually I retrieved the duck and removed the fishing line, and the hook which was in the bottom part of its beak. “There were also some injuries to its wings where it had been try¬ ing to break free. “The duck is now recovering at the RSPCA Stapeley Grange wild¬ life centre where it will receive some much-needed care and can later be rehomed.” Anyone with information on how the ducks came to be aban¬ doned is asked to call the inspec¬ torate appeal line on 0300 123 8018. Work under way on homes at factory site WORK has started in preparation for more than 100 new homes on an old factory site in Bridgtown. Representatives from Homes England and Cannock Chase Council were at the site in Walkmill Lane on Friday to mark the start of the work by contractor CPUK Civils and Remediation. Homes England secured planning per¬ mission last month to bring the derelict site back into use to provide 116 homes, in¬ cluding 20 per cent provided as affordable housing, as well as associated infrastruc¬ ture and public open space. The site was home to a Parker Hannifin manufacturing facility until 2000 and has remained vacant since. The access in Walk- mill Lane will be retained and an additional access at Vine Lane will also be provided. Karl Tupling, general manager for the Midlands at Homes England, said: “We use our land, finance and expertise to speed up the delivery of new homes. Progressing “We’re really pleased to be helping bring this local site back into use to provide 116 new homes and help local people in Can¬ nock to have access to a home of their own,” he added. Councillor Frank Allen, housing port¬ folio leader for Cannock Chase Council, said: “I am delighted that the council are progressing with this scheme with Homes England, and bringing a derelict site back into use. This will bring more and better housing for people in Cannock Chase, in¬ cluding much needed affordable housing.” Jack Rowley, managing director of CPUK Civils and Remediation, said: “Our team are delighted we have been awarded the remediation of this site.” • Plans for a new housing estate in Burntwood have moved a step closer Tay¬ lor Wimpey and Barratt Homes submitted detailed plans for 150 homes at Milestone Way in October and they were accepted by Lichfield District Council last week. The site was previously occupied by ES Smith, which recovered war weapons. Truck offences hit the heights The ‘dangerously’ overloaded truck which was stopped in Chadsmoor Picture: @CMPG AN ‘extremely overladen’ flatbed truck has been taken off the road after being found in Chadsmoor carrying scrap piled up to 20ft high. The silver truck, loaded with of¬ fice filing cabinets and a push bike, was taken off Moss Street in an op¬ eration carried out by Central Mo¬ torway Police Group’s B Unit team, Cannock’s local policing team and the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency. A Staffordshire Police spokesperson said officers spotted the vehicle at 2.45pm on Monday. They added that the truck was led to the nearest scrapyard and the driver was reported for a num¬ ber of traffic offences. “The vehicle was extremely laden with scrap,” they said. The Central Motorway Police Group took to Twitter to shame the driver. Officers tweeted to say the ‘dangerously overladen vehi¬ cle’ had been taken off the road and that a number of defects were found with the vehicle. Warning as man suffers burns from garden fire A MAN suffered flash burns after a bon¬ fire got out of control in his back garden. The 32-year-old suffered 17 per cent superficial burns to his face, arms, chest and legs after he used petrol on the fire in Rugeley on Thursday. Crews were called to the scene just after 9.15pm and he was taken to Royal Stoke Hospital by ambulance for treat¬ ment. His injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. Station manager Simon Craythorn said: “Ideally garden waste should be disposed of safely at local refuse centres or composted, but if you absolutely must burn it, then there are some vital things to avoid. “We would strongly advise people not to use petrol or any accelerant to start a fire or encourage it to grow - this inci¬ dent shows just how dangerous this is. “This fire was located far too close to nearby trees and could have easily spread to the foliage. “We have also had fires that have spread to nearby buildings, so always make sure there is enough clear space around the fire, taking into considera¬ tion weather conditions. “Never burn waste after consuming alcohol,” Mr Craythorn added. “This also applies to barbecues. Being under the influence can greatly affect your judgment and responsiveness, put¬ ting you at greater risk of injury.” Stepping up bid to raise £30,000 A TRAINING provider has launched a partnership with the Step Together charity to raise £30,000. BB Training Academy is the sister company to Busy Bees, the Burnt- wood-based childcare provider. The funds raised will help Step To¬ gether continue and extend its work providing bespoke volunteering place¬ ments to young people who have found themselves excluded from society. Step Together works with disad¬ vantaged adults to offer them support to boost their work-based skills while increasing their self-esteem and confi¬ dence. BB Training Academy currently has 2,300 learners and staff who will be chal¬ lenged to hold sponsored walks, runs, bike rides, sky dives and cake sales. Man found dead THE body of a 24-year-old man was found near Cannock Shopping Centre. Police were called to an area off Church Street, Cannock, at 4.50am last Tues¬ day. Detectives are not treating the death as suspicious, and a report has been prepared for the coroner.

Staffordshire-based Caudwell Chil¬ dren has announced it will run three free tours at community fire stations in the county in May and June. The tours will give children the opportu¬ nity to inspect the range of facilities within a working community station. The tour will also include a home fire safety talk where children will learn about fire safety and prevention. Julia Lunn, national family services manager for Caudwell Children, said: “Who isn’t impressed by our emer¬ gency services? “They do a fantastic job and par¬ ticipants will be thrilled to meet real life heroes and see the equipment that they have to use in their job. It’s going to be a great experience, one that many children rarely get to enjoy.” The tours will take place at a num¬ ber of stations across Staffordshire and are open to children and young people aged eight to 18. The tours will also give families the chance to build a support network with other fami¬ lies and will develop confidence and self-esteem amongst participants. One will take place at Cannock com¬ munity fire station in Old Hednesford Road on May 29 between 9am and midday. Others will be held in Tam- worth and Leek.

They’ve only been together roughly for a year, but despite this they’ve nearly finished their album in time for a busy summer of shows. Their self-titled debut will be re¬ leased on June 1. Their quick route to success has seen them win Hard Rock Hell’s Highway To Hell competition before signing a worldwide licensing deal with Off Yer Rocka Recordings - who will be promoting the release. Gigs in the pipeline include headline shows at The Station in Cannock on June 30 and Redrum in Stafford on August 18. The group are made up of vocal¬ ist and frontman Ryan Anthony, a former Walton High School student from Stafford, as well as guitarists Lee Spencer and Myles Cooper, bass¬ ist Richard Clark and drummer Lee Gilbert. Fans pledged more than £6,000 via PledgeMusic so the band could record their debut album. On top of this, they have also just released their debut music video for single Headspace, which is now avail¬ able to watch and shows the band at their energetic best. Ryan said: “We hope that everyone loves the album as much as we do.” The album was recorded in Febru¬ ary 2018 at the Priory Recording Stu¬ dios in Sutton Coldfield and produced by Greg Chandler. The band describe it as ‘marked by diverse influences from AC/DC and Black Sabbath to Clutch and Monster Truck, and revealing in full our song¬ writing potential and versatility’. Go to www.facebook.com/RydersCreed/ Passenger services on Chase Line to increase RAIL passengers will be able to en¬ joy increased services on the Chase Line from next week. Two trains will run per hour during the day between Rugeley, Cannock and Birmingham following investment from West Midlands Railway. It is made possible due to the recent track and signalling enhancements. Councillor Gordon Alcott, economic develop¬ ment and planning portfolio leader at Cannock Chase Council, said: “We are pleased to see the benefits to the improved Chase Line rail service being introduced. This will be initially through more frequent diesel services.” New four-carriage trains will provide hun¬ dreds of extra seats, and over the next few months, work will be undertaken to extend platforms. Richard Brooks, customer experi¬ ence director for West Midlands Railway, said: “The growth of the Chase Line is a success story everyone can be proud of. Faster “It has gone from being a freight line to be¬ coming a major West Midlands commuter route in a generation. We are doubling the number of off-peak services in May, and in December we will be adding new direct services to London as part of our £1 billion investment in the West Midlands rail network.” Recent track and signalling enhancements will enable trains to travel faster along the route, and the completion of electrification works later this year will pave the way for a brand new twice-hourly electric train service to Birmingham Airport and the NEC, and hourly to London from mid-December. Cannock Chase MP Amanda Milling said: “Improvements to the Chase Line have been one of my key priorities since being elected to Parliament in 2015 so I am delighted that the first stage of the project will see a more regular service, which is great news for passengers. “The service will now be able to accommo¬ date the rising passenger numbers and put an end to the days of overcrowded trains.” The new timetable is at www.westmidlandsrailway. co.uk/travel-information/timetables Fans give Gazza a hero’s welcome ‘ONE Paul Gascoigne, there’s only one Paul Gas¬ coigne!’ That was the welcome England legend Gazza got as he walked on stage at The Premier Suite at Bar Sport in Cannock. Around 300 fans hung on every word the 50-year-old had to say - including his story about borrowing an ostrich from a zoo to take to the Tottenham Hotspur training ground as part of a gag. The star-studded event also saw footballing leg¬ ends turn out to hear Gazza speak - including friend and former teammate Steve Bull, Wolves legend Steve ‘The Tank’ Kindon and foot¬ ball pundit Tom Ross.

Standing up for our communities SINCE The Chronicle launched more than 30 years ago, we have covered every aspect of life in our communities. We have report¬ ed on triumph, disaster, joy and sorrow. We shine a light on decisions made by those in power - and stand up for our readers. In recent years, technology has revolu¬ tionised the way people consume news and information. This in turn has prompted massive changes for our industry. Throughout these changes, The Chroni¬ cle has continued to focus on the local news and issues and stand for the same core principles. We are committed to delivering the very best news service, keeping you in touch with news and events from around the Black Country and Staffordshire. 20 MAKING A K DIMIRINCI Our journalists are dedicated to produc¬ ing accurate, interesting stories that in¬ form and entertain. We will hold those in power to account, exposing bad decisions to public scrutiny, but praising them if they get it right. Our reporters are out and about every day, at council meetings, court hearings, public events and much more. There continues to be plenty of debate over Press regulation in this country. Only last week, an amendment to the Data Pro¬ tection Bill could have endangered the free Press. The Section 40 legislation would have required publishers who are not signed up to State-backed Press regulator Impress - funded by Max Mosley - to pay the costs of legal action brought against them, whether they won or lost. It was defeated but the threat to the freedom of the Press refuses to go away. We are proud of the work we do and are committed to the highest standards of jour¬ nalism, which is why we are a member of Ipso, a robust, independent regulator that upholds the Editors’ Code of Practice. Finally, a word of thanks to our readers for your support, feedback and contribu¬ tions. Thank you for helping us keep in touch with the communities we serve. Diane Davies, Head of Weekly Titles How we bring all the local news to your door THIS week local newspa¬ pers across the UK, like the Chronicle, are taking part in Local Newspaper Week. Every Chronicle edition is the product of a combined effort from a committed team - from the reporters and photographers to the advertising team selling space and the van driv¬ ers, newsagents and delivery boys and girls who distribute the paper. We take a look at some of those re¬ sponsible for ensuring your Chronicle hits the street each week. The reporter Having started as an apprentice, Tom Oakley is one of a team of report¬ ers and photographers working across the Black Country and Staffordshire. He covers all aspects of news, including ‘calls’ stories from the emergency services, human interest stories, and reporting about local gov¬ ernment - even taste tests! The sub-editor Sarah Cowen-Strong is one of the final pieces in the editorial jigsaw after stories have been filed by report¬ ers and checked by Chronicle editors.

Chiefs stress importance of mental wellbeing STRESS and other mental health conditions are under the spotlight during Mental Health Awareness Week. Running from Monday, May 14 to Sunday May 20 the week is hosted by the Mental Health Foundation. Stress - a feeling of being under ab¬ normal pressure - is a major cause of mental health problems and can lead to self-harm and even suicide. Mental health services in Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent are leading the way in a nationwide drive to improve care for adults with anxiety disorders and depression, including stress. As part of Mental Health Aware¬ ness Week, people are being encour¬ aged to know the signs of stress and the psychological and physical symp¬ toms associated with it such as pal¬ pitations and quicker than normal breathing. Staffordshire GP Dr Waheed Ab- basi, clinical director for mental health and specialist groups the North Staffordshire Clinical Commissioning Group, said: “We all experience stress and we all deal with it differently. “However, when it is affecting your life, health and wellbeing, it is impor¬ tant to tackle it as soon as possible “In Staffordshire we are making strong progress in delivering the Im¬ proving Access to Psychological Ther¬ apies programme and are determined to keep the momentum going.” Local services can be contacted on the following numbers: Stafford & Cannock patients - 01785 243002 or 01543 572161; South Staffordshire - 01785 783031 or 0300 555 5001; Burntwood, Lichfield and Tamworth - 01827 288843 or 0300 555 5001. damping village for Weston Park WESTON Park will play host to a new glamping village this summer.

More commonly known as Cutane¬ ous and Renal Glomerular Vasculopa- thy (CRGV), Alabama Rot is a disease that has proved fatal for several dogs in the district. Ms Milling wants the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to urge the Government to take proactive action to raise public awareness of the disease as well as encouraging efforts to find a vaccine and cure. She has been contacted by several dog owners who have lost their dogs to the mysterious disease and she hopes more can be done to identify the causes. “Very little is known about Ala¬ bama Rot, with experts not knowing what causes it, how to cure it or vacci¬ nate against it. “I therefore met with the Envi¬ ronment Secretary to urge him to do more to make the public aware of the disease, the symptoms and ways to protect dogs from it, as well as en¬ couraging efforts to find a vaccine and cure.” Local dog owners are being asked to be vigilant and are advised to clean their pet’s paws after every walk and check for any cuts or abrasions that are not healing.

Burglary charge A 53-YEAR-OLD has been charged following a series of burglaries in the county. Ian Brindley, of Deal Avenue, Burntwood, was charged with three counts of commercial burglary and one count of attempted theft. Tributes paid to Baggies hero Lovett TRIBUTES have been paid to former Al¬ bion FA Cup hero Graham Lovett, who later went on to work for the Express & Star, who has died at the age of 70. Nicknamed ‘Shuv’ because of his £150 car that often needed a shove to start, Lovett played alongside Jeff Astle in the Baggies side that beat Everton in the 1968 Cup final at Wembley. After his retirement Lovett worked for the newspaper’s advertising department for more than 14 years. He finished as sales manager with The Chronicle. Former colleagues paid tribute. Re- Baggies ace Graham Lovett gi 0 nal sales manager Pete Hazel, said: “He was one the funniest people and one of the biggest characters you could ever meet. Graham is not only a legend with Albion fans, he is a legend with his former colleagues at the Express & Star.” MNA print managing director Graeme Clifford remembers Lovett as ‘a great motivator of his staff and a big character across the company’. After joining Baggies straight from school, Lovett made his debut in 1964, aged 17, and went on to make 157 ap¬ pearances, scoring nine goals, His career was hampered through injuries sustained off the pitch in two serious car crashes. He broke his neck and watched the 1967 FA Cup final from his hospital bed, amid fears he would not play again, but re¬ turned to play at Wembley and lift the cup a year later. The following summer he was involved in another car crash and suffered a col¬ lapsed lung, broken ribs and a broken tibia. He fought back again, but was re¬ leased in 1972. He dropped into non-league and eventual retirement. After spells living abroad, Lovett returned to the UK and became a regular at The Hawthorns and at various club dinners and functions. M6 is the most deadly motorway in the UK THE M6 has claimed more lives than any other motorway in Britain in the past decade - despite racking up fewer collisions than the Ml and the M25. The Department for Transport looked at all reported road incidents on major UK roads be¬ tween 2007 and 2016. It found that 160 people were killed on the M6, exactly twice as many as those who died on London’s M25 even though it had 331 fewer accidents - 7,342 for the M6 compared with 7,673 for the M25 where 80 died during the same period. The M5 was the scene of 91 fatalities - 14 per cent more than the M25 despite having fewer than half the number of crashes. Some 154 fa¬ talities took place on the Ml. The analysis of more than 2,000 of Britain’s motorways and A-roads revealed that the A38, which runs through Staffordshire, had 8,698 accidents - 360 more than any other road in Britain. Crashes It also had the greatest number of vehicles involved in crashes - 13,153 which is 10 per cent higher than any other A-road in the coun¬ try. But the severity of incidents was greater on the Al, the longest numbered road in the UK, with 172 people losing their lives over the decade, compared with 152 deaths on the A6 and 142 on the A40. The survey also showed that the number of reported collisions has largely decreased over the years, with 25 per cent fewer crashes regis¬ tered on major roads in 2016 than 2007. In addition, no-one had died in an accident on 35 per cent of the 2,000 roads analysed, in¬ cluding eight of the 51 motorways. The safest motorway was found to be the M49. Covering the Bristol and Gloucestershire area, the road saw 11 accidents over the 10- year period, none of which resulted in a death. The FOI request was made by motorcycle and classic car insurance broker Carole Nash. The firm’s head of marketing Rebecca Dono¬ hue said: “It is positive to note the number of accidents is decreasing.” Vandalism leaves shop staff ‘terrified’ Assistant manager Susan Shaw at the shop The DebRA charity shop in Rugeley has been boarded up BOSSES at a Rugeley charity shop are ‘terrified’ to return to work after vandals damaged the store windows. Susan Shaw returned to work at the DebRA Charity Shop in Brook Square after the bank holiday weekend to discover large cracks in the windows - and has felt un¬ safe ever since. Nothing was stolen but she has since boarded up the front of the shop, which will cost thousands of pounds to repair, and she believes customers are avoiding shopping there due to the damage. The 53-year-old assistant man¬ ager from Rugeley said: “I found out about what happened because someone let me know the one door was cracked. I did not see it was the window and the door until I came back in the morning after the bank holiday. “I was scared because I thought they might still be in the shop. “I am terrified to come into work each day because I never know what I will find. We always have trouble with people in this area but this has got to be the worst incident.” The shop raises money for med¬ ical research into Epidermolysis Bullosa. Councillor Anne Allt said: “These shops need people to go to them to help people, and this kind of vandalism will deter them. “It is a one-off for the area as far as I can tell. “I urge people to report any problems they have to the police.” NEWS IN BRIEF Leader secures HS2 guarantees COUNCIL bosses have secured key guarantees from HS2 limited to mini¬ mise it’s impact on the county. Staffordshire County Council leader Philip Atkins appeared before the HS2 Select Committee for Phase 2a of the project to petition more than 60 items including reducing the footprint and maximising rail use at the Stone railhead. They also agreed to encourage the recruitment of local, disadvantaged or under-represented groups during the construction. He said: “The county council has been committed to ensuring the voices of our communities were heard and getting the best outcome in terms of mitigation, compensation, improved connectivity and a share in any eco¬ nomic benefits the project delivers.” Rugby club scores with beer festival DRINKERS can enjoy a taste of dif¬ ferent ales, ciders and gins at a beer festival in Cannock.

Commuters faced delays to their journey after the tree fell on the Chase Line last Thursday. Engineers worked to remove the tree from about 3pm. A Network Rail spokesman said: “Trains between Walsall and Rugeley have been dis¬ rupted after a 90ft-tree has fallen and blocked the line. “Our safety-critical tree felling helps prevent incidents like this and keep passengers moving.” Dedication service for new church facilities THE Bishop of Lichfield, Rt Rev Mi¬ chael Ipgrave will dedicate the new facilities at a Huntington church this weekend and then lead the Eucharist.

Just don’t talk wet ANOTHER week, and another burning issue grips the political class. While you might think rising crime, Iran, North Ko¬ rea, Russia and Brexit would be enough to keep them occupied, but for some reason the Government has decided to declare war on wet wipes. Now maybe I’m in a minority, but of all the issues I feel strongly about, wet wipes fall pretty low down the list. Occasionally useful on a hot day after putting on sun cream, but overall I would say they do not form a major part of my life. It seems the problem is that wet wipes are made of plastic, and we all now know that plastic is A Very Bad Thing. But, at the risk of departing from the received wisdom of the day, the real problem is not the use of plastics, but today’s throwaway society. Children who change their mobile phones every year, replacing perfectly serviceable television sets to get the latest gimmicks, the end¬ less updating of computer systems for no significant benefits. All this generates vast amounts of waste, and the irony is it probably the people who consider them¬ selves the most environmentally aware who are responsible. Walk around your high street, and the chances are you will see “rent-to-buy” shops urging people on low incomes to buy needless gadgets they neither need nor can afford. Watch the series Can’t Pay? We’ll Take It Away about High Court bailiffs, and you will see virtually every house they visit has a huge, flat-screen TV. And what for? To see Jeremy Kyle in high-definition? Of course, this is great news for elec¬ tronics manufacturers in the Far East, but bad news for the engineers and repair¬ men in this country who used to earn a crust keeping these things working. But if we really want to protect the planet, we need to get back to making things to last, and maintaining them rath¬ er than replacing them at the whims of fashion. And if that means paying a little bit extra to begin with, it will almost cer¬ tainly save money over the long term. And it will make a much bigger differ¬ ence than banning wet wipes. ■ ■■ AND, not to be outdone in the petty meddling stakes, shadow foreign secre¬ tary Emily Thornberry - also known as Lady Nugee - has said Mr Men and Little Miss books are “sexist”. Do these people never take a day off? They are books for little children who don’t even know what “sexism” is. I do wonder which character Miss Thornberry would be. Little Miss Busy- Body, perhaps? Adele gets that sinking feeling as she hits the big 3-0 Car Share - Peter Kay’s unscripted ver- Splashing out - Adele celebrated her 30th sion of the sitcom showed its true genius with a Titanic-themed birthday party Love’s Labour’s lost - Ex-MP and actress Glenda Jackson out of favour with her party Kay s simple sitcom is just CONSPIRACY corner. After much research, au¬ thorities in Egypt have announced that there is no secret chamber behind the 3,000-year-old wall of Tutankhamen’s tomb. Which as every conspiracy theorist knows, means there is. I LOVED this week’s unscripted edition of Car Share (BBC1). I take a wee bit of pride in being one of the first hacks to recognise the brilliance of Peter Kay’s creation. Car Share launched in April 2015 and this column instantly hailed it as “clever, lovely, life-affirming stuff.” It’s just two people sharing a car. As so often in comedy, the simplest ideas are the best. THE blog version of this column sometimes re¬ minds me of another TV gem, Early Doors. A loyal bunch of customers hang around waiting for the pub (blog) to open. Then they all rush in¬ side and complain about what a crap pub (blog) it is. DOES she have no brains, no compassion or is she simply badly advised? Adele’s choice of a Titanic-themed party for her 30th birthday, with guests dancing in life jackets, was beyond understanding. If any of those guests die by drowning, heaven forbid, in their final moments they will certainly remember that party. AH, oui. Les evenements de soixante-huite. It was fifty years ago today that the youth of Paris rose against their government. I was there. Well, sort of. I was actually there a few weeks later on a school trip being bussed across Paris. The guide pointed out that all the freshly resurfaced streets had once been cobbled. But the rioters tore up the cobblestones to chuck at the police, hence the asphalt. I would like to claim that we Leamington College lads were gripped by the streets THE BEST OF PETER RHODES story of a national trauma so violent and so raw that Parisians simply called it les evenements, the events. But we were not. We were transfixed by the guy in the open convertible on the other side of the coach. He was driving with a ciga¬ rette hanging expertly from his lip, one hand on the steering wheel, the other resting under the miniskirt of his beautiful and adoring girlfriend. You didn’t see that sort of thing in Leamington Spa. SOME of the self-proclaimed Maoists, Trotsky¬ ists, anarchists and other revolutionaries who swarmed onto the streets of Paris 50 years ago later swapped their combat jackets for smart suits to become well-paid politicians and offi¬ cials across Europe. This will surprise you only if you have never read Animal Farm. I HAVE occasionally suggested that, as the Left and Right of politics get ever more rabid and unelectable, we may live to see a Labour-Con¬ servative coalition government. In an interview, the former Labour MP Glenda Jackson asks: “What party is Jeremy (Corbyn) leading? It’s not a party I know.” She reckons neither of the two main parties could win an election and “we’re on course for some sort of combined govern¬ ment.” Watch this space. THE Quakers seem to be moving away from God. According to research, 14 per cent of them are atheists while 43 per cent are “unable to profess a belief in God.” There is talk of drop- ahead ping mention of God from the guidance notes for Quaker meetings. By coincidence, a new report by the British Journal of General Practice suggests that family doctors, as we used to call them, are being used as “new clergy” by peo¬ ple who are not ill but want something to “give meaning and purpose to life.” And there’s the snag. The moment you start looking for mean¬ ing and purpose, or any sense of created order or fairness in life, you are heading for deep dis¬ appointment. Better by far to share a room with a few kindly Quakers, who are excellent listen¬ ers and make a damn fine pot of tea. A READER claims there is no longer a majority in favour of Brexit because moods have changed and the 2016 Referendum was “a long time ago.” This is how fake news begins. The vote was a long time ago. Anyway, it wasn’t binding on the Government. In fact, did the Referendum ever really happen? After all, we Brexiters are all old, dim and a bit forgetful. . . THE wonders of food science. How on earth do the boffins produce a yoghurt containing zero fat? Part of the answer may lie in the filling pro¬ cess. I’ve just opened a yoghurt pot which was barely half full. You may expect some settle¬ ment in the packet when it’s cornflakes, wash¬ ing powder or porridge oats, but yoghurt, for heaven’s sake? Is it easier to produce a yoghurt containing zero per cent fat if the pot is only 50 per cent full in the first place? STILL on food, a sudden rise in the price of vanilla is reportedly forcing some ice-cream makers to consider dropping the flavour from their range. I am sure we will struggle by. I can’t be the only customer who thinks vanilla is what food tastes of if it doesn’t taste of anything else. TALXjNGPOIN^^ Pregnant pause is must for smokers I MUST admit I am not, and have never been, a smoker. Maybe something to do with the fact that my dad did constantly and died young of a heart attack. Yes he had been told by the doctors to give it up but he just said at the time “What do the doctors know?” Well obvi¬ ously a lot more than he did. My daughter and daughters-in-law were very good - although one in fact has never been a smoker - and followed ad¬ vice to not smoke when they were preg¬ nant . After all, smoking is a choice decision and your unborn baby does not have that choice, so you have to make the right de¬ cision for them. Good advice, but how many times do you see mums-to-be walking along proudly pushing out their stomachs with a fag in hand or, just as bad, the prospec¬ tive dad (at least I presume that’s what he is) breathing out cigarette fumes all over her. So even if she has wisely taken the de¬ cision to quit for those important months she and the baby are still at risk. Passive smoking can be almost as dangerous. Our children are so precious and we would surely do everything we can to protect them. Admittedly some things are out of our hands to an extent - certain illnesses, bullying at school, friendship fall-outs etc, although of course we would do everything we can to prevent it or deal with the situation as best possible. I cannot pretend that my children - well, two of them - did not smoke but they did not do it in the house and never during pregnancy or in front of the ba¬ bies/children. Surely that is the responsi¬ ble attitude. Recently, while walking along Wolver¬ hampton’s main street, I saw not one but two moms leaning over their babies in the prams with a fag in their mouths. Cigarette ash in your buggy ... errm, very healthy. And how many times do you see on television children who are suffering from some awful illness. Probably, like me, you secretly cross your fingers and think please, there but for the grace of God etc. But how would you feel if your thought¬ lessness or selfish attitude was to blame for one of those illnesses? I know that when they are adults your children have to make their own decision as it is out of your control but not while they are young and need your guidance. Give your child the best start in life. If you must smoke, do it away from them - and most definitely not in pregnancy!

Football dub 'sick' after yobs damage goalposts COACHES and players at a junior football club were left ‘sick to the stomach’ after yobs caused hundreds of pounds of damage to equip¬ ment. Steve Edwards, under-13 man¬ ager of Midland Soccer Academy, in Burntwood, says the club will have to shell out a ‘fortune’ to re¬ pair the vandalism. It comes just days after The Chron¬ icle revealed how yobs had left beer bottles and rubbish strewn across the playing field at Coppy Nook Lane where a string of junior football games were planned. Midland Soccer Academy, which survives on weekly subscriptions from players, spent over £1,500 in total buy¬ ing the goals and getting them deliv¬ ered to their base in Cherry Close. But two days after they were set up Mr Edwards discovered the nets had been slashed, wheels allowing the goals to be moved had been buckled and the stanchions supporting the frames had been bent. “I feel sick to the stomach,” he said. “My boys were beside themselves and the other parents are gutted.” Both of Mr Edwards’ two sons, Billy, 12, and Stanley, 11, play for the club. A hole has been torn in the netting Having already stretched their mea¬ gre financial resources to purchase the goals, the club has now had to spend hundreds more on repairing the dam¬ age. Mr Edwards said: “We have had to buy brand new nets and put new wheels on. “It’s money the club hasn’t got. It’s a massive outlay for a small club.” The club have received a stirring response from the grassroots commu¬ nity, however. Mr Edwards said: “We have had teams from as far away as The goals’ wheels have been buckled Mansfield offering support to us. We would have liked to have taken them up on their offer but other grassroots clubs need the money themselves.” A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: “The chairman of a local football club contacted us to say that football goals which had been chained to a fence had been damaged. “There was no CCTV.

I would also like to take this opportunity to give a special thanks to all the vol¬ unteers who helped me and all our candidates, you all worked so hard. HYRA SUTTON Cannock I’ll do my best for the village PLEASE could I express my thanks to everyone who re-elected me their district councillor for Norton Canes. I will endeavour to do my best for the village, and I look forward to representing our community for the next four years. CLLR JOHN PREECE Norton Canes Scant regard to safety at busy crossroads I AM one of the many people who use the A5 - Oak Lane to Longford Island on a regular basis. In my opinion, scant regard is paid to safety at Four Crosses where Church Lane on the east and Calf Heath Lane on the west join the A5 to form a very busy crossroads. In fact, if they can, people avoid it using either Longford Island or the Vicarage Road traffic lights to join or cross the A5. Other road users, cy¬ clists, pedestrians, horse riders and the nearby farmer who has land and buildings each side of the A5, spend much time waiting for an opportunity to cross safely. Fortunately there have been no fatalities or major accidents. I suspect that no one has the faintest idea of current traffic flows as I have seen no evidence of checks throughout any weekday. I and everyone I speak to think it is time for traffic lights to be installed at the Four Crosses as a matter of some urgency. They would be of considerable benefit to all users of the area and significantly improve road safety. I hope that someone in authority can make a quick decision on install¬ ing traffic lights without further delay. MR E TURVEY Penkridge Election thank you I WOULD like to thank all the people in Hednesford North who voted for me in the local election on May 3. It has been an honour to represent you in the past, and I look forward to giving all the help I can, to any of you during the next four years. I would also like to give special thanks to all of the cam¬ paign team that helped me get elected.

Peter thinks that voicing an opinion different to his amounts to ‘a sinister an¬ ti-democratic gathering of dark forces’. Of course it isn’t. It is over 16 million people trying to stop a na¬ tion self-harming. Of course, if Brexit was reversed the anti EU group would not accept that grace¬ fully. As ‘winners’, they have bullied the rest of us into a hard Brexit. As ‘los¬ ers’ they would be totally unbearable.

She said it gave her great pleasure to in¬ duct Patricia Rotton into the club. Mrs Rot- ton was proposed by Gill Worrall-Arnold and seconded by Christine Taylor. Sheila was also sad to announce the deaths of Sheila Jones who had been a club member for many years, and of David Reid, husband of Angela, a committee member. Cards of condolence were sent to both fami¬ lies on behalf of the club. Lynne Moseley said Grace after which the ladies enjoyed an excellent luncheon. After the Loyal Toast the AGM meeting Cannock Chase Ladies’ Probus Club took place. Secretary Norma Hutchinson informed the meeting that letters had been sent out to other Probus Clubs inviting their chairmen and members to attend the Annual Luncheon at Brocton Hall Golf Club on Thursday, June 28. Eileen Cryer, past chairman, thanked Sheila for her work as chairman during the past year. Sheila agreed to take the chair for another year as, due to family circum¬ stances, it was not possible for the intended incumbent Cecily Garbett to take the role. Eileen Cryer presented a floral arrange¬ ment to Sheila and Olwen Harris gave thanks to Sheila and the committee. Put yourself in the picture AT the Annual Meeting, secretary Jill Gooch gave a report to remind members of the activities experienced over the past year.

Members have made hats and scarves for chil¬ dren in the townships of South Africa. Toiletries are also donated to Women’s Aid for victims escaping a violent relationship. Many members had at¬ tended a varied programme of events through Stafford¬ shire Federation WI and members wore green hearts to promote awareness of all thing loved which could be lost to climate change.

Work will start in July at the High Street centre. New operator Freedom Leisure is investing a total of £1.17m in the im¬ provements, working in partnership with Lichfield District Council. Improvements will be made to the layout of the cafe and recep¬ tion, including the introduction of a Freedom Cafe Costa coffee shop, along with the addition of a pool- side sauna.Councillor Iain Eadie, Lichfield District Council’s cabinet member for leisure said: “With an expanded gym, improved studios and new indoor cycle studio, we hope the improved facilities will encour¬ age people who have never come to Burntwood Leisure Centre before, or not been in a while, to give it a try.” Work will later start on upgrades to the fitness suite with a boosted gym floor size of approximately 60 per cent, along with new kit, a brand new indoor cycle studio and refur¬ bished group exercise studio. Some disruption will be inevita¬ ble but the centre will remain open throughout, bosses said. Freedom Leisure has apologised for any incon¬ venience caused, and aims to main¬ tain as many provisions and facilities as possible. Geoff Beadle, Freedom Leisure area manager, said: “These refur- bishments are to improve the facil¬ ities for all existing users but will hopefully also succeed in encourag¬ ing new users too.” Energy saving measures are also being introduced at the centre which first opened in 2002 and also features a pool and squash courts. Lichfield District Council handed over control of the centre to Freedom Leisure in February. Community funding applications open ORGANISATIONS from across the county are being in¬ vited to apply for funding to help support their local com¬ munities. A new round of the £10m annual fund available through the Ministry of Defence’s Armed Forces Covenant Fund is open and will run until the end of the year. The funding of¬ fers financial support to organisations and projects to help bring together Armed Forces and civilian communities and deliver local services to the Armed Forces Community. Groups and individuals can also raise funds through the Crowdfund Staffordshire website. For projects that help children and families directly, the £50k Children and Families fund will match fund some pro¬ jects up to £5,000 should it be supported by the community. Councillor Gill Heath, county council cabinet member for communities, said: “The Armed Forces Covenant Fund is a great scheme that helps support our local armed forces, those serving, veterans, cadets and their families to be more involved in local community’s activities.” For more details visit www.covenantfund.org.uk To start fundraising on Crowdfund Staffordshire visit www.crowdfunder.co.uk/funds/crowdfund-staffordshire or email amanda.dawson-blower@staffordshire.gov.uk EASTBOURNE ISLE OF WIGHT Sandown LLANDUDNO DAY TRIPS FOR MONTH OF MAY • Alexandra Hotel • 4/3 Nights Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal • Visit to Worthing* • Visit to Bognor Regis • Visit to Rye • Visit to the English Wine Centre 5 Days Monday 11th June 2018 £249.00 5 Days Monday 3rd September 2018 £249.00 5 Days Monday 29th October 2018 £220.00 4 Days Friday 7th December 2018* £179.00 (Turkey &Tinsel) *1 excursion only on this date to Worthing. • Trouville Hotel, Sandown • 4/6 Nights Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal • Visit to Rosemary's Vineyard • Visit to Ryde • Island Tour 7 Days Saturday 21st July 2018 £459.00 5 Days Monday 22nd October 2018 £279.00 • Baytree Hotel • 4 Nights Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal • Visit to Caernarfon & Beaumaris •Visit to Bangor 5 Days Monday 20th August 2018 £259.00 5 Days Monday 24th September 2018 £249.00 5 Days Monday 5th November 2018 £199.00 (Turkey&Tinsel) ISLE OF WIGHT Shanklin • Langham Court Hotel • Visit to Newport • 4 Nights Bed, Breakfast • Island Tour & Evening Meal 5 Days Monday 21st May 2018 £199.00 5 Days Monday 27th August 2018 £229.00 5 Days Monday 24th September 2018 £199.00 TORQUAY ■ Riviera Hotel 4 Nights Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal 5 Days Visit to Exeter & Teignmouth Visit to Donkey Sanctuary & Sidmouth Monday 10th September 2018 £220.00 WEYMOUTH • Berkley Hotel • 4/7 Nights Bed, Breakfast & Evening Meal at the • Visit to Poole • Visit to Dorchester • Visit to Portland Bill 5 Days 7 days Monday 11th June 2018 Saturday 28th July 2018 £249.00 £399.00 Thursday 24th Gloucester Quays £22.00 Saturday 26th York City £23.00 Tuesday 29th Bletchley Park& Afternoon Tea £53.00 Tuesday 29th Chester City / Chester Zooor Cheshire Oaks £19.00 Wednesday 30th Twycross Zoo NEW! £37.50 Thursday 31 st West Midlands Safari Park £26.50 DAY TRIPS FOR MONTH OF JUNE Friday 1st Llangollen & British Ironworks Centre £21.00 Saturday 2nd London £24.00 Sunday 3rd Weston Super Mare £24.00 Monday 4th Country Tour & Pub Lunch £29.00 Tuesday 5th Shropshire Tour £29.00 Friday 8th RHS Chatsworth Flower Show NEW! £49.00 Sunday 10th Emmerdale Village NEW! £49.00 Sunday 10th RAF Cosford Airshow NEW! £35.00 Tuesday 12th Oxford £22.00 Wednesday 13th Roman City of Bath £23.00 Saturday 16th Royal Windsor £22.00 Sunday 17th Royal Three Counties Show NEW! £37.00 PICK UP POINTS LICHFIELD, STAFFORD, CANNOCK & WALSALL www.happydayscoaches.co.uk Advanced Denture Solutions' • Full dentures can be made In one week ♦ Denture repairs ^ • Home visits ^ available Clinical Dental Technician K.

However, Andy and Jan Evans’s decision to do just that six years ago has paid dividends, as their son, Ryan, is set to launch a busi¬ ness venture within the family firm. At just 15 years old, Ryan Evans, with the backing of his parents, left school with no qualifications to start a mechanics apprenticeship with ISS motors. After knuckling down and learning the ropes, moving to Mercedes special¬ ist Elite Garage in 2014 to broaden his experience, Ryan became the perfect candidate to join his family’s firm, e.d.s. Couriers, to maintain its fleet of 55 vans. Just two years into the role, he is taking a leaf out of his father’s book and making plans to expand the busi¬ ness, taking the helm of a new enter¬ prise offering vehicle servicing, repairs and maintenance to the public from the e.d.s depot in Wimblebury Road, Hednesford. Father Andy said: “I think it’s im¬ portant to encourage your children to do what’s right for them, even if that goes against convention, like taking Ryan out of school at 15. “Ryan has always tried to work hard, but it was obvious that he wasn’t academically inclined and school was proving extremely challenging for him in many ways. At the age of five Ryan was diagnosed with dyslexia,which can cause difficulties understanding writ¬ ten text. His willingness to learn and progress in car and van mechanics has proved we made the right choice.” A CHANCE to meet with Police Dog Cooper - Staffordshire Police’s famous Staffordshire bull terrier rescue work¬ ing dog - and his canine colleagues will be just one of the opportunities on offer at this year’s annual police open day on June 3. The force is opening its doors again to give people the chance to meet of¬ ficers and staff serving communities across Staffordshire. The event is being held at police headquarters on Weston Road, Stafford, between 11am and 4pm. There will be demonstrations show¬ ing fascinating and exciting elements of policing including a chance to see police dogs search for drugs and guns and catch criminals, and police show how they use a chainsaw to get past any door.

Neil Sheppard, of Severn Drive, Burntwood, said his multiple sclero¬ sis meant he took 20 minutes to walk just 100 metres and claimed he needed care support. But the 54-year-old failed to tell authori¬ ties when his health improved and instead claimed benefits he was not entitled to over a 15-year stint. Prosecution barrister Rachel Penning¬ ton said: “He was claiming that it took him 20 minutes to walk 100 metres, used a walking stick and would lose his balance.” At Stafford Crown Court, Judge Jonathan Gosling said Sheppard’s claims had , not been ‘fraudulent from Neil Sheppard the outset > He said . « He simply failed to understand the importance of reporting changes.” Sheppard declared on self-assessment forms he regularly used a walking stick. But investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions discovered he had been working as a multi-skilled operative for Minworth’s Mondelez. Colleagues noticed Sheppard walked unaided and climbed two flights of stairs to attend work meetings. Defence barrister, Ms Catherine O’Reilly, said Sheppard, who was overpaid £51,867.95, was ‘genuinely remorseful and embarrassed’. Sheppard admitted failing to notify a change in circumstances to obtain a benefit between February 28, 2001, and May 17, 2016. He was handed a nine-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, a six- month supervision requirement and a four- month curfew. • See video at expressandstar.com Harvey’s speedy success In pole position - Harvey has picked up many trophies along the way A YOUNGSTER with a need for speed is in pole position thanks to the help of his petrol head father.

An accomplice who acted as look out for one of the raids was locked up for five years. Karl and Scott Loach, aged 28 and 31, snatched almost £1,000, Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Mark Warrollo, 39, kept watch as the pair, who had previous convictions for 81 offences between them, struck at the Spar shop in Rugeley on July 3, saidMiss Sophie Murray, prosecuting. The brothers, armed with a screwdriver, prised open the tills and took £490. Police identified them from CCTV . Both were on bail accused of burglary at the time. On July 14, the brothers, both from Spring Close, Shelfield, then staged a similar robbery at the Co-op in Lichfield Road, Walsall, this time taking £500. They and Warrollo, of Broad Lane, Shelfield, and had previous convictions for 138 separate offences, were gripped by long term drug addiction and stole to fund their next fix, the court heard. The brothers admitted both robberies and posses¬ sion of a knife and were each given identical eight year three-month sentences with an extra three years supervision on release. Warrollo was convicted after a trial of involvement in the first raid. NEWS IN BRIEF Leader's disgust at litter left on Chase CANNOCK Chase Council’s leader says he is ‘disgusted’ with the amount of litter left on Cannock Chase after the bank holiday weekend. Rangers took two and a half hours to clean up empty alcohol bottles, dis¬ posable barbecues and more left in the Area of Outstanding of Natural Beauty. Council leader George Adamson said: “I am disgusted. The Friends of Cannock Chase recently collected 18 bags of litter just because people are too idle to pick up after themselves. Plus it is dangerous to animals. “The cost of it is not for free either. The rangers who tidy up are paid and that is tax payer money.” Car scheme starts volunteer drive A VOLUNTEER car scheme has launched a drive to recruit new mem¬ bers.

Warrant Officer Rafa Bear is the latest recruit to join the Can¬ nock Chase branch of the Royal Air Forces Association. As part of this he’s received a hand¬ made RAF uniform complete with genuine RAF warrant officer badges. Neighbour The two-foot bear plans to make a host of public appearances around the county before getting a new post¬ ing on Armed Forces Day in Cannock. Residents across the district have the chance to win Rafa when he will be raffled off at the event at Cannock Park on June 23. Money raised from his sale will be donated to the RAF Association. The cuddly toy is the brainchild of the branch’s vice-chairman Valerie Loughrey, aged 76. She worked with her neighbour, Polly Harris, to design and make Rafa’s uniform. Amateur seamstress Polly, from Cannock, hand-crafted his uniform and peaked hat. Retired civil servant and former RAF servicewoman Valerie said: “I was shopping and saw this big teddy and thought it would be a good idea for fundraising. “I asked Polly because she’s a dress¬ maker and makes dolls’ clothes.” Rafa was donated by staff at Mor¬ risons in Mill Street, Cannock as part of a scheme by the company to help various charities. “I would like to raise £500 or as much as possible for charity,” said Valerie. “I’m very pleased with the teddy, it’s brilliant.” The branch plans to showcase Rafa at its fundraising stalls at various su¬ permarkets over the next few weeks. They also plan to take him to ser¬ vicemen clubs in the area. Lawrence McGowan, from the branch, said: “It’s unique, teddy bear collectors won’t find anything like it. “Polly, who made it, said she didn’t want to let go of it.” He added: “I love it.
