Lynn is so perfect for this business- full of energy and enthusiasm.” “Lovely small group- felt very comfortable. I enjoyed the baby massage and yoga. The colic routine has helped my son. Tummy time ideas very useful. He will be a happy and calm child due to massage and yoga. He will learn from continuing the ideas at home (sensory play). It was good to cover lots of various topics in one group. The group leader, Lynn, was really friendly and welcoming. Manual was really useful especially the photographs.” “We have lots of ideas for activities during the day, she is stronger and the calming activities were great.“ “Ruby has learned to enjoy massage and can be calmed more easily with songs and movement when she is fractious. Really appreciated the effort Lynn made to tailor the course contents to her needs and abilities” (premature baby) “We both really enjoyed the course, it gave us some really good ideas. Enjoyed ‘tummy time’ at last. “Really enjoyed baby massage, tummy time, bubbles and joining in with the songs. She is developing well and relaxes with the things I’ve learnt. Lovely classes, Lynn is very helpful and goes out of her way.” “We really enjoyed the course and look forward to learning more in Discovery Tots.
