        "text": "Great Wyrley is a large village and civil parish in southern Staffordshire. It had a population of 11,060 at the 2011 census.[1] Great Wyrley lies just under two-and-a-half miles south of Cannock town centre, just under two miles east of Cheslyn Hay, and three-and-a-half miles north of Bloxwich town centre.\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe word \"Wyrley\" derives from two Old English words: wir and leah. Wir meant \"bog myrtle\" and leah meant \"woodland clearing\", suggesting that Great Wyrley began as sparse woodland or marshland. \"Great\" refers to its dominant size over Little Wyrley.[2]\n\nEarly history\n\nGreat Wyrley is mentioned in the Domesday Book under the name of Wereleia, and as early as 1086 is said to have been indirectly owned by the Bishop of Chester St John's as part of the \"somewhat scattered holdings\" of the Church of St Chad in Lichfield. Some 480 acres of farming land were, assumingly, evenly distributed between Wyrley and nearby Norton Canes. However, all six dependencies of St Chad had been labelled as \"wasta\", which meant they had been abandoned by the time the Domesday Book was made.[3][4]\n\nPost-Industrial Revolution\n\nIn former times the town was a mining village — The Great Wyrley Colliery — with metalworking (such as for nails, agricultural implements and horseshoes) in outlying areas. The Wyrley and Essington Canal passes nearby.\n\nIn 1848 Samuel Lewis included the settlement in his gazetteer and stated it had:\n\n799 inhabitants and 1,600 acres, of which the Duke of Sutherland owned part;\n\nSeveral collieries[n 1];\n\nThe road from Walsall to Cannock passing through the village, long, and consisting of detached houses;\n\nIn 1844, Great Wyrley it formed with Cheslyn Hay a new ecclesiastical district, having a population of 1,753;\n\nSt Mark's Church, a highly finished structure in the early English style, built 1845, at a cost of £2430, of which sum £1200 was given by the Rev. William Gresley, prebendary of Lichfield; the remainder was raised by subscription, aided by £333 from the Diocesan, and £250 from the Incorporated Society;\n\nA perpetual curacy; patrons, the Dean and Chapter of Lichfield;\n\nA school, purchased from the Independents (Nonconformists), was opened in 1843 which cross-references the gazetteer entry Cannock.[5]\n\nIn 1876 Shapurji Edalji was appointed Vicar of Great Wyrley; he served until his death forty-two years later. A Parsi convert to Christianity from Bombay, he may well have been the first South Asian to become the incumbent of an English parish.\n\nThe 'Great Wyrley Outrages'\n\nIn 1903, the place was the scene of the \"Great Wyrley Outrages\", a series of slashings of horses, cows and sheep. In October, a local solicitor and son of the parson, George Edalji,[6] was tried and convicted for the eighth attack, on a pit pony, and sentenced to seven years with hard labour. Edalji’s family had been the victims of a long-running campaign of untraceable abusive letters and anonymous harassment in 1888 and 1892-5. Further letters, in 1903, alleged he was partially responsible for the outrages and caused the police suspicion to focus on him.\n\nEdalji was released in 1906 after the Chief Justice in Bahamas and others had pleaded his case. But he was not pardoned, and the police kept him under surveillance. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle of Sherlock Holmes fame was persuaded to \"turn detective\" to prove the man's innocence. This he achieved after eight months of work. Edalji was exonerated by a Home Office committee of enquiry, although no compensation was awarded.\n\nLocal myth remembers the Outrages to have been enacted by \"The Wyrley Gang\", although Conan Doyle believed that they were the work of a single person, a local butcher's boy and sometime sailor called Royden Sharp. Ironically, Conan Doyle’s suspicion was based on circumstantial evidence. It was an over-reliance on this type of evidence in the first place which had resulted in Edalji’s flawed conviction.\n\nPoison pen letters in the name of the \"Wyrley Gang\" continued for another twenty-five years, but these were subsequently discovered to have been posted from outside the town by Enoch Knowles of Wednesbury, who was arrested and convicted in 1934.[7]\n\nThis case has been related or retold:\n\nConan Doyle's The Story of Mr. George Edalji (1907, expanded re-issue in 1985).\n\n1972 BBC anthology series The Edwardians: Arthur Conan Doyle (one episode) centres on his involvement in the Edaji case. Written by Jeremy Paul and directed by Brian Farnham, it stars Nigel Davenport as Conan Doyle, Sam Dastor as George Edaji, and Renu Setna as the Reverend Edaji.\n\nArthur & George by Julian Barnes (2005), nominated that year for the Man Booker Prize. In 2010, Arthur & George was adapted for the theatre by David Edgar[8] and, in 2015, for a three-part British television drama of the same title.\n\nA comprehensive non-fictional account Conan Doyle and the Parson's Son: The George Edalji Case by Gordon Weaver (2006).\n\nIn Roger Oldfield's book Outrage: The Edalji Five and the Shadow of Sherlock Holmes, Vanguard Press (2010),[9] the case is set within the context of the wider experiences of the Edalji family as a whole. Oldfield taught history at Great Wyrley High School.\n\nSchools\n\nGreat Wyrley has three primary schools and one high school:\n\nLandywood Primary School[10]\n\nMoat Hall Primary School[11]\n\nSt Thomas More Primary School[12]\n\nGreat Wyrley High School[13]\n\nTransport\n\nRoad\n\nGreat Wyrley economically is largely a dormitory for commuters to Birmingham and Wolverhampton, and as a midpoint between Birmingham and Stafford, or Walsall and Cannock more locally; by the parish boundaries are junctions T7 on the M6 Toll motorway and 11 of the M6.\n\nRail\n\nLandywood railway station provides services south to Birmingham New Street and north to Rugeley Trent Valley. Wyrley and Cheslyn Hay railway station to the north of Landywood closed in the 1960s.\n\nBuses\n\nGreat Wyrley is served by bus routes running between Cannock and Walsall, and bus routes running between Cannock and Wolverhampton:\n\nNotes and references\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n(\"Wikimedia Commons\" has material\n\nabout Great Wyrley)"
