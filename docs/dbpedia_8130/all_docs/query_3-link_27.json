        "text": "I would like to thank everyone concerned with my darling Mum’s funeral. Every part of the day was delivered with outstanding expertise, respect and dignity. I knew she was in safe hands as Halliwell had given my Dad a wonderful funeral the previous year. Gemma, Jan and Chloe’s kindness and professionalism make a very difficult and emotional process that bit easier to bear.\n\nOn behalf of the family and myself I would like to thank each one of you for the way you conducted my late husband’s funeral. The courtesy and kindness shown to us was beyond words. Without the help of Yvonne and her team a sad day but would have been a lot more stressful. They are a wonderful team.\n\nWe decided to use your services because Mom said you were amazing when you looked after Dad. The service was amazing from start to finish. Thank you so much.\n\nThank you very much for all your kindness and help you gave us on our sad loss. You are a very special and lovely lady. All our love and best wishes.\n\nWe would like to thank you for the care, politeness and respect given to us, right from the collection of the body, funeral arrangements and the kindness and support on the day of the funeral. There was so much respect and guidance on the day.\n\nI would just like to express our gratitude to for the way you took care of my husband. From our first meeting with Yvonne to the end of the process, you all treated my family with the greatest compassion.\n\nThank you for all your guidance, help and support in the wake of the loss of my father. We couldn’t have been more pleased with his care in your hands and his beautiful funeral.\n\nTo Yvonne and all the staff, we cannot thank you enough for everything you did for us and how you looked after our relative. The staff on the day were fabulous and very professional. Once again Yvonne, thank you for helping us at our darkest time.\n\nOn behalf of the family I would like to say a heartfelt ‘thank you’ for all your help and support over the last few weeks with pulling together the arrangements and ensuring mom's wishes were carried out for her funeral.\n\nYou made a very difficult time so much easier for us to cope with and you are a real credit to your profession - thank you.\n\nThank you all for your organisation and support that combined to make our sad farewell to Albert such a positive occasion. I particularly want to thank Chloe for her perfect management on the day, Sandra for her professional contributions and all members of your caring and vital organisation.\n\nWe couldn’t think of anything to improve the service from Halliwell. We especially appreciate the special care given by Sandra.\n\nThank you for being so supportive, helpful and patient with us all. You made a truly upsetting time far more bearable.\n\nThe family are praising your services to everyone and cannot thank you enough for the way mom was treated from beginning to end. Once again thank you all so much.\n\nWe cannot put into words the thanks for the help and support you showed us in the toughest time of our lives. It really is appreciated and we couldn’t fault your help. Thank you so much.\n\nAll the staff were very knowledgeable, caring, supportive and helped me through a very difficult time. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nWe would like to thank the lovely lady funeral arrangers. Your kindness and help with the funeral arrangements was amazing. God bless you all.\n\nThank you for all your kindness and help to our family on the death of our mother. We feel from our first meeting to the funeral and finally interment of mom, all was dealt with sympathy and professionalism."
