        "text": "Who would you call to solve the most notorious Midland crime of the Edwardian age?\n\nThat’s elementary – the creator of Sherlock Holmes, of course.\n\nIn a new three-part ITV drama, partly filmed in the Black Country, Martin Clunes plays Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He invented the fictional detective Holmes and investigated real cases himself.\n\nArthur and George sees Conan Doyle setting out to discover who was responsible for the Great Wyrley Rippings and to clear the name of the man wrongly jailed for the crimes.\n\nThey happened in 1903 in the mining village of Great Wyrley, in south Staffordshire just outside Walsall.\n\nA series of slashings of horses, cows and sheep shocked the neighbourhood. Then a local solicitor and son of the parson, George Edalji, was tried and convicted for the eighth attack, on a pit pony, and sentenced to seven years with hard labour.\n\nGeorge, who had solicitor’s offices in Corporation Street in Birmingham, was released in 1906 but not pardoned. He wrote to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle for help and the writer decided to investigate his case.\n\nAfter eight months, George was exonerated by a Home Office committee but the difficulty in overturning his conviction led to the creation of England’s Court of Criminal Appeal in 1907.\n\nGeorge was half Indian and half Scots. His father was Rev Shapurji Edalji (played by Art Malik), appointed vicar of St Mark’s Church in Great Wyrley in 1876 and possibly the first South Asian to take charge of an English parish. Not that the community all took to him – the family were the victims of a long-running campaign of harassment and abusive letters, including those accusing George of being the ripper.\n\nThe TV drama Arthur and George is based on Julian Barnes’s book, which was also adapted for the theatre by Birmingham playwright David Edgar.\n\nThe book was read by producer Philippa Braithwaite who set out to make a TV drama and persuaded her husband, Martin Clunes, to star in it.\n\nThe couple normally join forces to film Doc Martin but a period piece was a different kettle of fish for Martin.\n\nSpeaking on set at the Black Country Living Museum, wearing a tweed suit, peaked cap and fake sandy-coloured moustache, Martin says: “It was Philippa’s idea so I couldn’t say no, especially as she had spent such a long time, several years, optioning the book. She swears there was no pressure, but there was pressure!\n\n“But I was interested because the role is a massive change and completely new for me. It’s quite outside my comfort zone.”\n\nIt is actually Martin’s first go at crime solving as he reveals he’s not a fan of detective shows.\n\n“I’m no good at spotting whodunnit, because I don’t watch those shows,” he confesses.\n\n“I don’t really like them. I’ve been asked to be in cop shows so many times but I’ve always said no.\n\n“I wouldn’t believe me doing it. Jumping out of cars and saying ‘You’re nicked!’, it doesn’t sit well with me.\n\n“This is not a cop show. The closest thing we get to it is a low speed chase in a Hackney carriage.\n\n“We also took a horse-drawn double decker bus around Trafalgar Square early one Sunday morning.\n\n“The period detail is fantastic. I like playing the period but I wouldn’t like to live in it, I’m too much of a fan of modern living and gadgets.\n\n“The costumes are great. I am wearing about five layers with a shirt, waistcoat, jacket and coat, plus thermals underneath because I’m still freezing! It’s a palaver to get into but it’s all been made for me by Angels costumiers.\n\n“This museum is just fantastic,” he adds of the Black Country Living Museum where they are filming at a blacksmiths.\n\nThe flames are being stoked as Sir Arthur arrives in Great Wyrley with his right hand man Woodie, trying to get information on the rippings.\n\nThe film crew also spent a day at Blists Hill Victorian Town in Ironbridge.\n\nProducer Trevor Hopkins says: “This is a perfect location for this part of the story. The Black Country museum is a complete revelation to me, it’s amazing.\n\n“He is returning to the place where the crimes happened.\n\n“We do show some of the animal mutilations but it’s not too gruesome.\n\n“The whole thing was a mystery in real life, but we have a conclusion to our story. We have a fresh idea about who did it, that isn’t in the novel.\n\n“It’s a purely fictional idea, though.\n\n“It might come as a huge surprise – it’s quite a dramatic conclusion. Most of the cast didn’t suspect it.”\n\nConan Doyle agrees to take on the case while mourning the death of his wife Louisa from TB and struck down with writer’s block.\n\nHe teams up with his trusted manservant, Alfred ‘Woodie’ Wood, played by Downton Abbey star Charles Edwards.\n\nThe pair become a kind of Holmes and Watson, although Martin is at pains to point out that he is not playing Sherlock.\n\n“Lots of people blur the distinction between Sherlock and Conan Doyle. I’ve been asked when Benedict Cumberbatch is going to be in it!\n\n“Some Americans think Sherlock was a real person and was Prime Minister of England.\n\n“There’s such a muddle about the character and the author.\n\n“They are completely different, although there’s an energy and a thoroughness to both of them.\n\n“Conan Doyle was an extraordinary man, a doctor and highly intelligent, with lots of interests that he rarely saw through.\n\n“He was a bit like Toad of Toad Hall. He bought one of the first motorcars without having seen it.\n\n“This is not the only crime he went about solving, he was called in when Agatha Christie went missing and was involved with Houdini.\n\n“I’d love to do more cases if the audience likes it.”\n\nIncidentally, Martin is the cousin of Jeremy Brett who was such an iconic Sherlock on TV in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n“He would be pleased at what I’m doing, I think,” muses Martin, 53, who starts filming a new series of Doc Martin in March.\n\nNottingham-born Arsher Ali plays George Edalji in Arthur and George and feels quite at home filming in the Midlands.\n\nHe says: “I know this neck of the woods. I spent three years with the Royal Shakespeare Company and have lots of cousins in Birmingham, Redditch and Bromsgrove.”\n\nArsher, star of Four Lions, Complicit and The Missing, reveals he is usually up for taking on stunts but declined the chance on his first day of filming Arthur and George.\n\n“In our drama, George is attacked in prison. He gets thrown down a flight of narrow stairs.\n\n“I watched the stunt double do it and it looked brutal and dangerous, and I didn’t want to get injured on my first day.\n\n“He develops a limp after he’s attacked.\n\n“I had to develop a distinctive way of walking. To help me, I’m wearing a kneepad with a couple of shoehorns in it, something I cobbled together from the wardrobe department on the first day of filming.\n\n“It’s worked as it gives me that physical reminder to limp.\n\n“I didn’t think I would ever get the chance to be in a period drama and working with Martin is such a pleasure.\n\n“He’s a warm and welcoming man. He’s really generous and bloody brilliant!\n\n“I have picked up tips from him. The way he can do a really serious, intense scene and then immediately say something hilarious is amazing.”\n\nArsher reveals that viewers didn’t warm to him as a nasty journalist in The Missing.\n\n“My mates were saying I was upsetting everyone. They said ‘my mum hates you in that show, you’re horrible and have evil eyes’.\n\n“It’s acting! Thankfully I’m not recognised too much without the big beard.”\n\nIn Arthur and George, Emma Fielding plays George’s mother Charlotte.\n\nShe reveals: “My mother is from Bloxwich near Walsall. I still have relatives there and one aunt and uncle actually live in Great Wyrley, very near the church.\n\n“I did ask them about the Great Wyrley Outrages and they sent me a link to a local history site.\n\n“People who have lived there for a long time know of it.”\n\nArthur and George starts on ITV on March 2 at 9pm."
