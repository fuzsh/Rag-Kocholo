        "text": "The Staffordshire collection is a unique set of records spanning baptisms, banns, marriages and burials which provides details of the history of Staffordshire and its people.\n\nSince its foundation, the Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent Archive Service has been responsible for the records of Staffordshire parishes. The very first deposit of records obtained by Staffordshire Record Office in 1947 was from the parish of Hamstall Ridware. Registers included in this collection are all held by the Staffordshire and Stoke on Trent Archive Service. Registers for those few Staffordshire parishes deposited with other archive services are not included in this collection.\n\nAt present the images for the collection are black and white digital copies of microfilm records but colour digital images created from paper originals will be added in due course, expanding the collection considerably so if you can't find your ancestor now there's a good chance they will be here soon.\n\nThe records cover almost 200 Staffordshire parishes. A full list is below."
