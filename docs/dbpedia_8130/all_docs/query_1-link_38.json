When looking for jobs, we both believed that going into an apprenticeship was the best option.\n\nAn apprenticeship offered us both an opportunity into the working world, while still allowing for us to further our education. Going into digital services, and technology was a great choice of ours, as it would set us up in the future for any career path we may take – teaching us vital skills in communication, workplace etiquette and the key abilities needed to excel in the industry…South Staffordshire Council has a smaller team – with only 15 members in the team. This has been great for our personal development, as we have been able to try a wide range of areas in digital services, allowing us to find the areas of digital services that we are most passionate about…we feel like starting in digital services and at South Staffordshire Council was the right choice for us, as it started our working life with a great example of a work environment and allows for us to develop our skills for whatever our future may hold”\n\nIt’s fantastic to read of Lily’s and Nathan’s good experience here at South Staffordshire Council and we wish them all the best as they continue to progress.\n\nCouncil job vacancies\n\nPlanning Solicitor, closing date 27th January, 2023\n\nAll vacancies can be viewed in full and applied for on our new recruitment site: https://www.sstaffs.gov.uk/vacancies\n\nLeisure latest\n\nCheslyn Hay Leisure Centre\n\nCheslyn Hay Leisure Centre’s newly refurbished swimming pool re-opened this week and we’re delighted to welcome swimmers back into the pool for general swimming.\n\nSwimming lessons are planned to re-start from February 7th however all Swim Academy members will be notified by email to help prepare for the return to lesson.\n\nThe swimming pool changing rooms remain closed whilst refurbishment work continues; this means that all swimmers must arrive ‘swim-ready’ and be prepared to ‘robe and go’ at the end of the swim.

The overriding success of the group walks over the past 12 months must be attributed to the walk leaders whose functions range from leader through to the back markers…their kindness, enthusiasm and dedication are second to none’.\n\n‘The walks provide an opportunity for physical wellbeing at different levels, but there is also a camaraderie and social aspect that often continues with welcome refreshments in the park café at the end of the walk’.\n\nAs a walker, I’s like to say a big heartfelt “Thankyou” to the band of volunteers that have made our Thursday mornings so enjoyable – without them – the 10am meet at the bandstand would not happen!\n\nMany congratulations to all concerned.\n\nFor more information on our walks click here\n\nWolves Soccer School\n\nWolves Soccer School is coming to Cheslyn Hay Leisure Centre from February 20th to 24th, 9am-3pm.\n\nThe sessions are for children aged from reception to year 7 with 2-day, 3-day and 5-day options available.
