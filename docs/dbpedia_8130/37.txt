Safeguarding

The churches of St Marks and St Andrews in the parish of Great Wyrley are committed to safeguarding children, young people and adults from harm. We follow the House of Bishops guidance and policies and have our own Parish Safeguarding Officer (PSO). Our Diocese of Lichfield’s safeguarding pages contain vital links and information including contacts for the Diocesan Safeguarding Advisor who advises our PSO. If you are concerned that a child or adult has been harmed or may be at risk of harm please contact the PSO or the Diocesan Safeguarding Officer.

Our Safeguarding Coordinator is Christine Stockley and can be contacted on 07915525361

Diocesan Advisor for safeguarding Children: Kim Hodgkins on 01543 306 099 or Neil Spiring on 01543 306 030

Diocesan Advisor for safeguarding Vulnerable Adults: Neil Spiring 01543 306 030

If you have immediate concerns about the safety of someone, please contact the police and your local authority’s children or adult social care services."
