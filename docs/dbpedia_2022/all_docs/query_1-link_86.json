While this page will be frequently checked and e-mail addresses were valid at the time of posting, I cannot guarantee that every address will remain valid if researchers don't notify me of e-mail address changes. If you would like to contact someone, click on their name and send an e-mail. If you would like to have your surnames of interest listed here, or if you need to change your e-mail address or names of interest, please contact me.\n\nIf you don't see anyone here researching the same surnames as you are, visit the Jefferson County Message board and post a query.\n\nIf you send to an address listed here and your e-mail repeatedly bounces back, I would appreciate notification of that invalid address. (Keep in mind one bounce doesn't necessarily mean the address is bad â€” it could mean the server is down for maintenance, the recipient may have been on vacation and has a full mailbox, or a host of other reasons. So if it bounces once, wait a few days and try again.)"
