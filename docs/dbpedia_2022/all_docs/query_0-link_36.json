        "text": "Piotr Adamczyk is a popular Polish film, television and stage actor. He garnered international acclaim for his portrayal of Pope John Paul II in the film \"Karol, A Man Who Became Pope\" which was seen by no less than eight hundred million people worldwide.\n\nKnown for his versatility, Adamczyk has consistently surprised audiences with his ability to embody vastly different characters ranging from anguished saints to ruthless oppressors, from melancholy composers to love sick fools.\n\nHaving honed his craft on theatre stages at home and abroad, Adamczyk broke into film with great momentum. His portrayal of Stawrogin in Dostoyevsky's \"The Possessed\" established him as a leading man and led him to the role that would propel him to Polish stardom: Frederic Chopin in \"Chopin, Desire of Love\".\n\nHis renown would only grow following his tour de force performance as Pope John Paul II in the two part Italian production - \"Karol the Man Who Became Pope\" and \"The Pope - the Man\". The films vast and international viewership would extend his popularity beyond Poland to Italy, Latin America and many other countries. Adamczyk also managed to build on his popularity abroad by performing at the Sala Uno Theatre in Rome (entirely in Italian), by playing in Liliana Cavani's movie \"Einstein\" and in the Portuguese mega production \"Second Life\".\n\nAdamczyk has appeared in around 100 theatre, television and film productions. His nuanced portrayal of the Gestapo officer Lars Rainer in the hugely popular Polish television series \"Days of Glory\" won him acclaim and accolades, while his comedic performances on the hit show \"Przepis na Zycie\" (A Recipe for Life) endeared him to an ever widening fan base. In addition to having won numerous awards at international film festivals in Italy, China and Ukraine, Adamczyk was honored with the prestigious Gloria Artis medal for outstanding contributions to Polish culture.\n\nAdamczyk has also had over 800 radio roles and is an accomplished voice actor. He has contributed his talents to such characters as Melman the Giraffe in \"Madagascar\", Zigzag McQueen in \"Cars\" and Syndrome in \"The Incredibles\", to name but a few. One of his latest roles was that of Maximilian Kolbe in the Mexican American 3D animated motion capture film \"Max and Me\".\n\nUpcoming releases in 2016, starring Adamczyk, include the European production \"Framed\", \"Max and Me\", \"Slaba Plec\" (The Weaker Sex) and a sequel to one of Poland's biggest box office hits of the last decade: \"Letter to Santa 2\".\n\nScott Edward Adkins was born on June 17, 1976 in Sutton Coldfield, England, into a family that for generations were butchers. Along with his elder brother Craig, he was raised by their parents, John and Janet (Sanders) Adkins, in a loving middle-class family. Scott attended Bishop Vesey's Grammar School in Sutton Coldfield. Probably not the best of students, he used to sneak downstairs after his parents had gone to bed and watch films all night then fall asleep during lessons. A natural athlete, Scott enjoyed a variety of sports as he grew up, but when he was 10 years old, he accompanied his father and brother to the local Judo club. The attraction was instantaneous. Idolising stars such as Bruce Lee and Jean-Claude Van Damme, Scott began to train everyday. He took over his Dad's garage and turned it into his own Dojo. He even had a shrine to Bruce Lee in there that he would bow to. He remembers being mugged on a bus when he was around 13 and that really kicked his training into overdrive. He wasn't ever going to let that happen again. At the age of 14, Scott went on to train in Tae Kwon Do under the instruction of Ron Sergiew with the T.A.G.B. After a few years, he moved on to Kickboxing under Anthony Jones. He is now a fully trained Kickboxing Instructor for the P. K. A. A self confessed \"film junkie\" Scott's attention was drawn to acting through the Hollywood Greats. He enrolled in a drama class at Sutton Coldfield College. Being a shy lad he initially found it difficult to be put on stage in front of an audience. Finally, at the age of 21, Scott was offered a place at the prestigious Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art. However, as an impoverished student, he found it hard to make ends meet without a grant and was forced to leave without completing the course. Very dejected he thought that was the end.\n\nHis first break came when he was offered a role in a Hong Kong martial arts film called Dei seung chui keung (2001) (aka Extreme Challenge). Spotted by Head of The Hong Kong Stuntmen Association and director Wei Tung and English-born Hong Kong movie expert Bey Logan, Adkins found himself in the East for the first time. Scott got the chance to work with some of Hong Kong cinema's leading action directors including Woo-Ping Yuen, Corey Yuen, Sammo Kam-Bo Hung and the legendary Jackie Chan. Acting roles started to come in and he was offered a guest role in BBC's Doctors (2000) filmed at Birmingham's Pebble Mill. A few episodes in BBC's EastEnders (1985) and City Central (1998), and a lead role in Sky One comedy drama Mile High (2003) followed by a regular role in BBC's Holby City (1999) as Bradley Hume, the assistant General Manager of Holby General.\n\nStarring roles in feature films soon followed with his portrayal of Talbot in Special Forces USA (2003) and Yuri Boyka\" in Undisputed II: Last Man Standing (2006). It was this film that broke him into the mainstream with his villainous portrayal of a Russian MMA underground fighter Boyka in what has been hailed as one of the best American made Martial Arts films of recent times. Along with lead actor Michael Jai White, fight coordinator J.J. Perry and the slick direction of Isaac Florentine this movie has some unbelievably heart stopping fight scenes. After this Scott has had guest starring roles in bigger budget films like Das Bourne Ultimatum (2007) and The Tournament (2009), and played Jean-Claude Van Damme's main adversary in Sony Pictures The Shepherd (2008).\n\nJaimie Alexander was born in Greenville, South Carolina, but moved with her family to Grapevine, Texas, when she was four years old.

After graduating from high school she moved to Los Angeles, California, to pursue acting.\n\nHer career was launched in 2003 when she was cast in the leading role of Hanna Thompson in the low-budget award-winning film The Other Side (2006). According to the DVD commentary, she was originally at the audition to help out by reading against the male actors, but director Gregg Bishop decided to cast her in the leading role after hearing her perform the lines. Her second role was in 2004 in Squirrel Trap (2004), in which she played the co-lead role of Sara. A year later she was cast as Jessi XX on the ABC Family series Kyle XY (2006), in which she played the role of a superhuman being created by scientists as a laboratory experiment.

In his latest achievement, he starred in the BAFTA Award-winning British Short Film \"Jellyfish and Lobster\" (2024), where he played a man with Alzahimar. He gave a short speech about having had to play terrorists for four decades up until this short film, which reminded the audience of what Arab performers go through in the film industry. He brought a tear to some of the audience's eyes.\n\nHis journey to the big screen, however, was not easy. Sayed's story is one of perseverance, belief, and beating the odds. Born in 1957 in Port Said, Egypt, Sayed grew up in poverty but had dreams and aspirations of movie stardom from a young age. Although the prospect of him ever making it to Hollywood felt as bleak as realizing peace in the Middle East, he felt an undeniable pull towards acting, believing that he was cut out for something more. He used the movie theater as a child as an escape from the war-torn Middle Eastern atmosphere he was born into. It was at the movie theater where he discovered the transformational magic of film and where he determined that he was destined to be a part of that magic. Sayed moved to the United States and attended New York University film school before moving out to Hollywood to pursue his acting career. His career in the film industry first began as an assistant to actor/director Anthony Perkins, and then with director James Cameron on the film, 'True Lies.' Badreya had a clear mission; he wanted to make movies that told the Arabic-American story, since it had yet to be told. This mission led him to creating a production company of his own, 'Zoom In Focus.' Under this banner, he directed and produced the documentary, 'Saving Egyptian Film Classics' as well as 'The Interrogation', which won Best Creative Short Film at the New York International Film Festival. He also produced and starred in a short film called, 'T for Terrorist', which was awarded Best Short Film at the Boston International Film Festival and the San Francisco World Film Festival. Sayed's efforts to bring attention to Arab-Americans in the motion picture industry has received much coverage and media attention over the years on radio, television, and in major publications around the world.
