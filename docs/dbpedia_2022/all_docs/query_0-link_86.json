        "text": "Goodbye Mr Mackenzie: The Rattler\n\nWhile the masses were storming Woolworths for the honking “white soul” emanating from the banks of the Clyde, in Edinburgh Goodbye Mr Mackenzie were busy being the best band never to enjoy the world stardom they deserved. This was the first single I reviewed for my fanzine and was the first of many great songs they wrote.\n\nAC/DC: It’s A Long Way To The Top\n\nAre ACDC Scottish? Of course they are, there is a statue of Bon Scott in Kirriemuir and this song even has bagpipes in it.\n\nFranz Ferdinand: Darts Of Pleasure\n\nThe first time I ever appeared on Radio Scotland it was to review Franz Ferdinand’s debut album where I argued with another guest, who had once made up a Meatloaf review for The Scotsman and thought the Scissor Sisters were better.\n\nCamera Obscura: Lloyd, I'm Ready to be Heartbroken\n\nThis band followed Belle & Sebastian in emulating the Scottish indie sound of the eighties, and in doing so they did a better job than all of them. The whole album is a thing of beauty.\n\nThe Time Frequency: New Emotion\n\nI was at the opening night of PURE, bought FiniTribe’s records and was a regular at some great house clubs. However, in most of central Scotland people were tuning in to Tom Wilson’s show on Radio Forth, swallowing eccies by the handful and listening to anthems like this. Every weekend! It’s amazing.\n\nAnnie Lennox: Little Bird (Utah Saints remix)\n\nI found this remix on iTunes about 15 years after first hearing it. It’s so good I once listened to it six times in a row while jogging round Oban. The only reason I didn’t go for seven was because my legs hurt.\n\nThe Jesus & Mary Chain: The Living End\n\nWhen I was 19 this song led me to buy a pair of leather trousers, although I never went down the road of actually owning a motorbike. I’ve often wondered if the Reid brothers did, or whether they only got as far as the strides as well.\n\nGerry Rafferty: Baker Street\n\nThe true brilliance of this song is how it makes the saxophone, the most irritating instrument ever invented, sound appealing. It’s a feat usually managed only by ska bands.\n\n1990s: You're Supposed To Be My Friend\n\nJust when Primal Scream were cleaning up their act, along came the 1990s with two of the best albums of the noughties. The singer once grabbed Vic Galloway’s nads during a live TV interview. They both told me this independently of each other.\n\nThe Exploited: Dead Cities\n\nI would be willing to bet that The Exploited are better known around the world than most Scottish pop acts. The first time I saw them was on Top Of The Pops, as did somebody working at the dole office, which apparently led to Big John’s claim being stopped when he went in to sign on a few days after being on TV.\n\nLena Martell: One Day At A Time\n\nMy hairdresser once told me that Lena took her surname from the make of brandy. If that’s true, it’s an excellent detail given that the song could be interpreted as an ode to the twelve steps. I once put this into a DJ set and Emma Pollock and Paul Savage came up to say how much they like it too.\n\nDjango Django: Default\n\nDjango Django were created by a benign genius for people like me who always wanted to be able to dance to The Beta Band.\n\nThe Hook’n’Pull Gang: Gasoline\n\nAlthough managed by a guy who had written a Tina Turner B-side, this amazing band broke up before they got their major break. When I was 17 I was supposed to interview them after a gig in the Assembly Rooms but I’d drunk ten cans of beer by the time I actually got to speak to them. It was an early lesson in not getting hosed up before meeting the band. You can hear 'Gasoline' here.\n\nThe Poets: That’s The Way It’s Got To Be\n\nThe Poets were not just a great Scottish band, they were one of the very best anywhere in the 1960s. Although renowned for moody, introspective songs, this, their second single, is edgy R&B, by driven acoustic guitars, twin pounding bass lines and George Gallacher’s assured, distinctive vocal. It was produced by Andrew Loog Oldham, the Rolling Stones manager. Little wonder his more-famous charges saw the Poets as rivals.\n\nThe McKinleys: Give Him My Love\n\nBetween 1964 and 1965, Edinburgh sisters the McKinleys recorded four wonderful ‘girl-group’ singles. This, their last in the UK, is a moody beat ballad, co-written by Donovan, who deserves a Top 10 all on his own. Dropped by their record label, the duo then moved to Germany where they forged successful careers, together and individually. You can hear 'Give Him My Love' here.\n\nThe Incredible String Band: Waltz Of The New Moon\n\nThe String Band are another of the greatest groups ever, a kaleidoscope of folk, magic and mysticism. Who else unites Billy Connolly, Robert Plant and the Boards Of Canada? Their first five albums are all essential and choosing one track is next to impossible. It could’ve been ‘Witches Hat’, ‘The Half Remarkable Question’, ‘You Get Brighter’, ‘October Song’…\n\n(White) Trash: Road To Nowhere\n\nThe Pathfinders were one of Glasgow’s great soul groups, but this desolate Carole King composition was also part of their set. They cut a demo, which producer (and former Shadow) Tony Meehan took to the Beatles’ Apple label. That very recording was the one issued in 1969, albeit under the above new name. Demo or not, the group’s confident swagger created a brooding intensity, one befitting its lyrical helplessness. You can hear 'Road To Nowhere' here.\n\nScars: Adult/ery\n\nThe youngest group of Edinburgh’s punk bands, the Scars learned in public and had to wait two years to record. The result was astonishing. ‘Adult/ery’ is brash, confident and punchy; a furious riot of metallic chords which maintains a forcefulness throughout. As a statement of intent, this has few equals and it’s arguable the group ever sounded better. You can hear 'Adult/ery' here.\n\nFire Engines: Get Up And Use Me (Codex Communications version)\n\nFire Engines epitomized Edinburgh’s vibrant post-punk scene, a bratty, angular twist on US no-wave and Captain Beefheart. Prickly, exciting and fixedly determined, this was another mission statement, one that continues today. The roots of guitarist/vocalist Davy Henderson’s later, equally essential, groups – Nectarine No 9 and the Sexual Objects – are here. Brilliantly.\n\nJosef K: It’s Kinda Funny (‘Only Fun In Town’ version)\n\nHaving signed up with Postcard Records, Josef K released ‘It’s Kinda Funny’ as a single but then re-recorded it for their album ‘The Only Fun In Town’. Both are excellent but, for me, the second has the edge, losing the ‘ping pong’ punctuation and gaining an altogether tougher sound. The song itself is an existentialist masterpiece, its detachment emphasized by singer Paul Haig’s laconic delivery.\n\nBlue Nile: Easter Parade (with Rickie Lee Jones)\n\nBlue Nile’s album debut, A Walk Across The Rooftops, was released in 1984 to critical acclaim. The moody, spectral ‘Easter Parade’ was one of its many triumphs but another version, tucked away on a CD single, captures them with Rickie Lee Jones. The blend between her voice and that of Paul Buchanan is both tender and heartbreaking, evoking a lost, closing-time melancholia steeped in sadness.\n\nJesse Garon and the Desperadoes: Splashing Along\n\nPart of Edinburgh’s indie ‘C-86’ which also included the Shop Assistants, Fizzbombs and Vultures, Jesse Garon made several great records, but this, their first single, is maybe the best. Filled with innocence and jingle-jangle fun, it’s playful, joyful and totally irresistible. You can hear 'Splashing Along' here.\n\nSpirea X: Fire and Light\n\nTrack 10 and I am haunted by those omitted (the Pastels’ ‘Baby Honey’… ah well.) Spirea X was led by Jim Beattie, formerly and co-founder of Primal Scream. Listeners who hanker for that group’s paisley-patterned early work will find much in this magnificent track, an opaque, harmony-drenched classic; dreamy, Byrds-like and utterly captivating.\n\nChas McDevitt: Freight Train\n\nThere’s no doubt that Lonnie Donegan, a Glaswegian by birth, was the one who gave Skiffle its impetus and profile but for me the most evocative of these records was 'Freight Train' by the Chas McDevitt Skiffle Group. The singer was Nancy Whiskey. Her name was actually Anne Wilson and she, like Donegan, was from Glasgow. Her stage name was suggested by fellow group-member Jimmie Macgregor, who had come across it in the chorus of a Glasgow song, ‘The Calton Weaver’. Jimmie, who went on to have a considerable profile later, had left the group by the time the chart appearances commenced.\n\nThe Poets: Now We’re Thru\n\nScotland had some great pop groups in the 1960s. It would be true to say that Marmalade (previously Dean Ford and The Gaylords) were the biggest hit-makers but the most interesting for me were The Poets. So here it’s gotta be 'We're Thru'.\n\nBert Jansch: Strolling down the Highway\n\nWhen I seriously encountered the world of folksong in 1965 there were multiple strands which were full of treasures. One was the American aspect which included songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly. Elizabeth Cotten, who wrote ‘Freight Train’, had a presence there too. It was soon apparent that much of this repertoire was what had been the backbone of Skiffle. Another strand was the guitar players and songwriters. Scotland, and Edinburgh in particular, was especially fertile in this area and provided a number of accomplished participants. Out front was Bert Jansch, closely followed the following year by The Incredible String Band. The mesmerising opener of Bert’s first album, which I first heard in Imhof’s on New Oxford Street on my initial visit to London, is my choice here.\n\nJeannie Robertson: Twa Recruitin’ Sergeants\n\nA truly significant discovery in the world of folksong was the cornucopia of riches from Scotland. I was aware of some folksongs but the depths provided were astonishing. I was fortunate enough to get to know a few of the older singers aka ‘source singers’, many from the North-east and from Traveller communities. The song I’ve selected smartly combines politics, satire, wit and history, skillfully wrapped in a social commentary related to the trickery employed by the recruiters for the Napoleonic wars. The performance, from the towering presence of the great Jeannie Robertson, is a joy to behold. So, here is – 'Twa Recruitin’ Sergeants'.\n\nCream: White Room\n\nThe term Supergroup hadn’t been uncovered by the time Cream was formed, although the collective illustrious past of the group’s members arguably qualifies them for the description. The connection to Scotland is of course the great Jack Bruce whose bass guitar and voice drove, and in many ways, dominated the sound of the group. Jack wrote the melody to this song and the lyric is by Pete Brown.\n\nFrankie Miller: Brickyard Blues\n\nScotland’s seaport towns, particularly Glasgow, Dundee and Leith, like other UK seaport towns benefitted from the merchant seamen bringing records from the USA, long before they were readily available in Britain. These included blues, country & western and all that made early rock’n’roll. These records were followed by early Motown and obscure soul imports. Such towns also boasted a number of singers with throaty voices suited to the found repertoires. Scotland’s finest female voice in this category belongs to Maggie Bell with the male honours going to Frankie Miller. Teamed with legendary New Orleans producer/songwriter/pianist Allen Toussaint in 1974, they collaborated to make this.\n\nCocteau Twins: Sugar Hiccup\n\nArguably the most distinctive pop music from Scotland was what I’d describe as the arty stuff that emerged in the 1980s. All the Postcard records had a particular vitality. The front-runners to my mind were the trio who made up The Blue Nile closely followed by The Cocteau Twins. Accordingly, my next selection is Cocteau Twins' 'Sugar Hiccup'.\n\nThe Blue Nile: Saturday Night\n\nHaving mentioned The Blue Nile, I have to include one of theirs. The band’s debut album, A Walk Across the Rooftops, was an essential part of the soundtrack to the 1980s for me. This song is a highlight of their equally essential second album Hats. It’s The Blue Nile – 'Saturday Night'.\n\nGarbage: Only Happy When It Rains.\n\nWhen I worked at the BBC in the late 1980s one of the groups featured in the more adventurous of our music programmes was Goodbye Mr McKenzie. The main singer was Shirley Manson, who always had a little something extra. A group of American producers and musicians, on a search for a particular kind of female singer for their new band, came across Shirley in a video made for her then current group Angelfish. They tracked her down and invited her to be a part of their band, Garbage. Shirley grabbed the opportunity by the scruff of the neck and continues to tour and make great records with them. This is from their debut album.\n\nJill Jackson: 1954\n\nBack in 1995/96 my wife Stephy Pordage and I set up a media production company, Neon. We were commissioned to deliver The Brand New Opry to BBC Radio Scotland. One day Stephy went through a number of demos on cassette tapes and unearthed a group called Jacksonville. They were fronted by an engaging teenage singer called Jill Jackson. We got her onto the show and have remained in touch since. We now work together often. This is from her 2018 album Are we there yet?\n\nPilot: Magic\n\nA lot of people thought we were being ironic or mocking by having this as the title song in Big Gold Dream but we weren't! It's just a brilliantly written, performed and produced 3 minutes which sets out to be nothing more than a perfect pop song. David Paton gave his blessing for us to use it, and it just forms part of the story. Because the Bay City Rollers were from Edinburgh they cast a big shadow which later bled into the punk scene, which is why we used it. Glam Pop Punks! It was Angela, our editor’s idea!\n\nDorothy: I Confess\n\nAlex Fergusson is one of Scotland’s greatest songwriters but sadly is rarely acknowledged for his large contributions. He co-founded Alternative TV, Psychic TV and produced Orange Juice's Blue Boy amongst many others. Dorothy is not Scottish but I love this collaborative single they did. He did so much in that period. Perfect subversive pop which he continues to do to this day.\n\nYou can hear ‘I Confess’ here and Alex Fergusson’s ‘Stay With Me Tonight’ here.\n\nRobert Rental: Double Heart\n\nA true pioneer of modern electronic music (along with his friend Thomas Leer). It's an irony of his originality; that by sounding so different to the other Scottish Post-Punk artists he usually gets left off lists. You don't need a guitar to be a punk! I'm excited there's an exhibition and documentary on both Robert and Thomas taking place later this year.\n\nYou can hear ‘Double Heart’ here.\n\nShelagh McDonald: Stargazer\n\nStrangely I used to work in a call centre run by Robert Kirby who arranged the strings on this, but that’s another story. This is a beautiful and magical song which creates an incredible spell-like atmosphere which not many records are able to achieve. I love it. Very much part of the acid folk scene pioneered by ISB and definitely a massive influence on Johanna Newsom and Devendra Banhart and that US freak-folk scene from many years later.\n\nHey Joe: Love/Marmalade\n\nMade world famous by Hendrix and dubiously claimed to have been written in an Edinburgh folk club during the late 50s. Scotland’s role in the folk revival and that role’s development into pop/rock should never be downplayed. I think the year zero moment for Scottish Pop is the 1951 Edinburgh People’s Festival Ceilidh. Like the best music, this song would cross-pollinate and evolve around the world, branching into many different directions, influences and mutations. The inspiration given to Love and The Byrds would eventually come back to Scotland and help part kickstart a whole new Scottish scene with Orange Juice and then Primal Scream Mk 1's jingly-jangly-garage-ness. This is the Marmalade version based around Hendrix's, though Love’s is by far the best.\n\nOne in a Million: Fredereek Hernando\n\nI'm a massive 60s UK Psyche fan. Not much came from Scotland unfortunately but this more than makes up for that. One of the genre's absolute best and all the way from Lenzie. Guitarist Jimmy McCulloch was only 13 and later found fame working with Pete Townsend and Paul McCartney.\n\nYou can hear ‘One in a Million’ here.\n\nHouse of Lords: In the Land of Dreams\n\nBecause so little came from Scotland I'll cheat and add this other excellent Glasgow psyche single, which I know nothing about.\n\nYou can hear ‘In the Land of Dreams’ here.\n\nFinitribe: Detestimony\n\nWhat I love about Finitribe is they just do their own unique thing regardless of outside influences. Like Robert Rental, not being part of a particular sound or scene makes it difficult for journalists to categorise them, which journalists hate. This seemingly developed from nowhere into a void sometime in 1986. The world (and Ibiza) finally caught up a couple of years later with Acid House and this then found its closest home – though still unique. It’s just great music that defies a category. Chris Connelly would later join industrial bad boys Ministry. A shout-out should also go to Ege-Bam-Yasi, covering similar ground at the time but again completely unique.\n\nSubway Sect: Hey Now I'm in Love\n\nWhile not from Scotland, Vic Goddard is so steeped within the culture of Scottish independent music that he's become an honorary Scotsman. This influence demonstrates that where you come from is completely irrelevant in music, it's shared attitudes which define you rather than geographic location. And obviously great music, which Vic's eclectic back catalogue is full of. So much to choose from and so varied, this again demonstrates that punk is more than just three chords and a guitar. His influence is probably as big on Wet Wet Wet as on Postcard (with whom he'd later release an album).\n\nCaedmon: Aslan\n\nThey were a Christian rock group from Edinburgh but instead of sounding like Stryper are more like a cross between The Wicker Man soundtrack, The Velvet Underground and Amon Duul. I came across their album in a charity shop and became intrigued by it, and know very little about them.\n\nYou can hear ‘Aslan’ here.\n\nHappy Meals: Le VoyageI didn't really know much about this when I bought it. One of the best LPs from last year. Great pop music. They say don't judge a book by its cover but this is exactly why I bought the album and hoped the music would match its beauty, which it more than achieves.\n\nSpell: Big Red Balloon\n\nRose McDowall is one of Scotland's greatest singers and songwriters. Much more than just Strawberry Switchblade, with a rich list of collaborations amongst her own unique solo work. This cover perfectly sums up that Strawberry Switchblade balance of fun and darkness which runs through her career.\n\nWounded Knee: Freedom Come All Ye\n\nI think Drew Wright is one of Scotland's most creative musicians. Constantly evolving, inventing and experimenting over the last 10/15 years. Originally part of a scene which appeared to often spend more time on creative band names than music, he just seems to understand where music comes from and new ways to take it to.\n\nYou can hear ‘Freedom Come All Ye’ here.\n\nTuff Love: Sweet Discontent\n\nI’m allowing myself one Lost Map track in this top 10, and there’s no way it could be anything other than this tune. There’s a secret ingredient in all Tuff Love songs that is seriously addictive. It’s probably bad for your health.\n\nLooper: Burning Flies\n\nStuart David left Belle and Sebastian and formed a band with his partner Karn, releasing an album which had the same melody going through almost all of the tracks. It shouldn’t really work, but it totally does. The intimate, homemade aesthetic throughout all their work really appeals to me.\n\nThe Delgados: Accused of Stealing\n\nEmma Pollock’s voice. I mean, c’mon. I love the way this song twists and turns, reeling you in. It’s the perfect marriage of engaging songwriting and inventive production. So good.\n\nLone Pigeon: Long Way Down / The Rainking\n\nThis is two tracks, paired together on the album Concubine Rice. That track 'The Rainking’ is monumental. There’s an even longer version of it on the Fence compilation John’s ABC - but that’s not available online anywhere, so I figured I should just share this one. It’s still quite long, and dreamy.\n\nBoards Of Canada: In A Beautiful Place Out In The Country\n\nElectronic instruments sound like they are slowly breathing, and a manipulated sample of a child’s voice becomes both sinister and comforting at the same time. After a minute or so, a vocodered voice comes in – \"Come out and live with a religious community in a beautiful place out in the country”. There’s something so strangely haunting, and warped about that invitation – but still alluring. The way it’s expressed feels automated, but human at the same time. When it finally disintegrates, and submerges beneath the wheezing synths, it’s really blissful.\n\nFree Love: Synchronicity\n\nBest act in Scotland right now, both live and on record. Everything they do blows my mind! I’m a big fan. They create music that is emotional, but also fun. Like 2Unlimited.\n\nGolden Teacher: Party People\n\nTurn this up LOUD. It’s f***ing wild.\n\nKing Biscuit Time: I Walk The Earth\n\nI should really have a Beta Band song on here, but I’ve gone with a King Biscuit Time track instead – it’s perfect, this. I love singing along to Steve Mason’s voice.\n\nBreakfast Muff: R U A Feminist\n\nThis is pretty much what Scotland does best, innit? Scuzzed up guitars, bass, drums, reverby vocals. Swearing. I reckon Breakfast Muff do it better than most. Really great band live, too – swapping instruments, and lead vocals. I love all that.\n\nPrimal Scream: Shoot Speed / Kill Light – Live at the Zepp\n\nThis is a live version of one of my favourite Primal Scream tunes. Normally live recordings are nowhere near as good as the records, but this is off the flipppppin’ pipes. People can be quite snobby about Primal Scream these days, I guess they’re seen as a heritage act by some folk. That comes with having a seminal album, I suppose. But they created so many outstanding albums – that run in the late 90s/early 00s especially. XTRMNTR is such a confrontational, visceral, unrelenting record. I love listening to this really loud, so that it hurts.\n\nCocteau Twins: Fotzepolitic\n\nI just love all the sounds! All the elements that make up the Cocteau Twins. I think I first heard them when a friend was DJ'ing gigs when I was starting to develop my own taste in music.\n\nGarbage: Special\n\nI remember listening to Version 2.0 on my Portable CD player, Shirley Manson is so Cool!\n\nIdlewild: When I argue I see shapes\n\nI saw Idlewild a few times in various venues in Aberdeen and Pete (from Sprog Rock) and I went and saw them play at the Kelvingrove Band Stand a couple of years ago when C Duncan (Liam from Sprog Rock plays drums for them) were supporting. It was so fun. They totally worked the crowd and seemed to be having so much fun. I love seeing that. Also SHAPES!\n\nYoung Fathers: In My View\n\nEverything Young Fathers have done is so exciting. Such exciting performers and so much to dive into in the music, I hear something new every time I listen to their music.\n\nKathryn Joseph: The Weary\n\nI saw Kathryn play lots of times at The Lemon Tree in Aberdeen. She's got such a magical quality. She doesn't really sound like anyone else, it's so beautiful, vulnerable and strong all at the same time.\n\nEurythmics: There must be an angel\n\nThe Eurythmics was music we listened to in the car, something that my whole family could agree on listening to and singing along with. Also Annie Lenox went to the same school as me. (But not at the same time.)\n\nBelle and Sebastian: Electronic Renaissance\n\nIt was hard to pick a Belle and Sebastian track because there are so many songs I love.\n\nDel Amitri: Don't come home too soon\n\nThis was the Official Song for Scotland in the 1998 World Cup. Me and a few other members of Sprog Rock play football on a Sunday with pals for fun and I always think this song resonates with our friendly, unambitious football too!\n\nThe Little Kicks: Goodbye Enemies, Hello Friends\n\nAnother band I saw a lot growing up in Aberdeen. I love this song for a sunny day, it's really sweet and upbeat.\n\nTeenage Fanclub: This Is Music?\n\nWhenever I need a boost, this is such a good song for feeling like a winner!\n\nIvor Cutler: Beautiful Cosmos\n\nMy dad is a huge Ivor Cutler Fan and when Ivor used to play gigs in Aberdeen he would play our harmonium so once I got to speak to him on the phone when I was about 9. He said I was very polite. It's another one that's hard to choose but this song is so charming and warm!\n\nOrange Juice: Rip it up\n\nFor ages I didn't even know that Orange Juice were Scottish! I feel like this is a song that I've always known and at no point do I remember discovering it!\n\nCocteau Twins: Iceblink Luck\n\nMy favourite kitchen whirlabout. Exquisite stuff. Liz Fraser nailed the art of bonkers phrasing long before Bjork did. Legendary at my high school because Grangemouth was an ever shitter place than Denny. And therein lies hope. (PS Fraser’s singing of Tim Buckley’s Song to The Siren with This Mortal Coil is one of the most beautiful things ever…)\n\nBig Country: Chance\n\nIn The Crossing and Steeltown, they nailed industrial Scotland and the brutal human fallout of the Thatcher era. Plus the big unrequited love of my early teenage years was a plaid-shirted Stuart Adamson wannabe.\n\nAltered Images: I Could Be Happy\n\nI showed a TOTP clip to my daughter when she was about 4. When it was done, she pointed at Clare Grogan and asked: when do we get to meet that lady, mum? My thoughts entirely.\n\nRM Hubbert with Aidan Moffat & Alex Kapranos: Car Song\n\nWhen Aidan Moffat is in tender mode, it’s a beautiful unravelling thing. And Hubby is a modest gem.\n\nSarah J Stanley: Hold on Elijah\n\nLet’s f*** over the system that we live in. Her voice gets under my skin. I love her HQFU electro moniker too. And she’s a brilliant visual artist too. This song is no.1 for therapeutic weeping. You can listen to the song here.\n\nThe Waterboys: Whole of the Moon\n\nI don’t care for the anthemic container as much as I did when I was 16. And strictly speaking, of course, it’s a Scottish, English, Irish collaboration. But Mike Scott’s (very Scottish) lyric is a heart’s keeper. Trumpets, towers and tenements, wide oceans full of tears. It’s a dear song, for quiet reasons.\n\nFrightened Rabbit: Swim Until You Can’t See Land\n\nOcht. It takes on a deeper, harder meaning since the death of Scott Hutchison. But it’s still a glorious wedge of uplifting melancholy.\n\nDeacon Blue: Dignity\n\nI love this most of all because of what it does to a crowd. It’s like an enchantment of communal feeling.\n\nJonnie Common: Crumbs\n\nCriminally underrated. Trapped in Amber is my favourite M8 album of the last 10 years. Lyrically witty. Yet frequently poignant. Surely, this fella is gonna break one day?\n\nChvrches: The Mother We Share\n\nI wanted to be in Iain Cook’s previous band The Unwinding Hours. I was fortunate to nab him as producer of my 2012 album Traces, just as Chvrches was emerging. I totally couldn’t afford him now! A brilliant band. And, as the mum of an impressionable wee daughter, Lauren Mayberry is some kind of feminist pop perfection. Singer. Drummer. Tech Head. Writer. Producer.\n\nFranz Ferdinand: Always Ascending\n\nI turn this track up really loud and dance like everyone’s watching!\n\nThe Associates: Party Fears Two\n\nI get completely lost in this song – I hear something different every time I listen to it and I’ve listened zillions of times. I miss Billy – I hope he knows how totally loved he is.\n\nSheena Easton and Prince: U Got The Look\n\n‘It should have been me’ says the ever-deluded me...\n\nSimple Minds: Chelsea Girl\n\nWill always remember being a teen in my bedroom and playing this single again and again and again… and they were from Glasgow, my hometown, and then they let Altered Images open for them.\n\nThe Twilight Sad: I Could Give You All That You Don’t Want\n\nHave a very big weakness for the guitars in this song – it reminds me of my youth and all the awkward boys I loved hanging out with.\n\nCocteau Twins: Heaven or Las Vegas\n\nAlways fresh, completely unique sound and a band that seemed to do it always on their own terms – something I truly admire as I know how tough that is.\n\nJessie Rae: Over The Sea\n\nOk so I have a few drinks and then insist everyone listens to this song if not sing along – watch the video – I insist (again). I love Jessie – I even got to see him without his helmet on – he is passionate about what he does and he is oozing with talent. Caledonian Funk at its funkiest.\n\nGarbage: Queer\n\nShirley has a truly distinctive voice – the minute you hear it you know who it is and that really does not apply to everyone. She takes that lead singer role to another level... She is totally kick ass – and I love her for it\n\nFrankie Miller: Angels With Dirty Faces\n\nI got asked to record this song for a charity compilation. I didn’t know it at all at that time but it has lived with me ever since. Learning it was a joy.\n\nThe Blue Nile: Happiness\n\nIt’s hard to describe the emotional impact it has on me… it makes me roar, it makes me feel overwhelmed… It could honestly push me over. To do that with a song is what music is all about for me.\n\nThe Trojans: Arna-fari (Scotland the Brave)\n\nThere’s something so instantly Scottish about the sound of bagpipes. Club promoter and bandleader Gaz Mayall tales the instrument into the world of Ska to great effect on this iconic tune.\n\nThe Rezillos: Flying Saucer Attack\n\nThe opening cut from Can’t Stand The Rezillos, this is an absolute rocker. Jo Callis was, to my mind, the best guitarist in those early days of punk. I can’t listen to it in the car as it makes me drive faster.\n\nAidan Moffat & RM Hubbert feat. Siobhan Wilson: Cockcrow\n\nThe homespun minimalism of the sound created by Moffat & Hubbert is quintessentially Scottish. The stories they tell have a bleak beauty. Factor in Wilson’s ethereal vocal and you have a truly astonishing piece of work.\n\nMartyn Bennett: Move\n\nI first heard the album Grit performed live at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow as part of Celtic Connections. To be so affected by a piece of work which was new to me, came as a complete a complete shock. I’ve become a firm fan of Bennett’s irreverent and singular take on traditional Celtic music.\n\nMichael Marra: Frida Khalo’s Visit to the Taybridge Bar\n\nThis song makes me cry like a baby, sorry… ‘Greet like a bairn’.\n\nLulu: The Boat That I Row\n\nIf Dusty Springfield was the UK’s answer to Aretha, then Lulu was our Diana Ross. I always preferred her sassy roar on stompers like this. No wonder The Beatles were fans. I saw her costumes on display at Rip It Up. She was tiny.\n\nEddie Reader: Never Going Back Again (Queen of Scots)\n\nA beautifully witty reworking of the song from Rumours by Fleetwood Mac. I remember chatting to Eddi about how she was working at a biscuit factory when she answered an advert in Melody Maker for a job as a backing singer for The Gang of Four. I saw her on that first tour singing with them in Basildon. You can take the girl out of Scotland… Etc…\n\nEdwyn Collins: 20 Years Too Late\n\nI just bloody love this song. Edwyn is a master songwriter with wit and heart, and this sub-disco anthem about the double-edged sword of late career success is a stone cold classic.\n\nJames Yorkston: Summer Song\n\nYorkston lives up the road from me in Fife. I hadn’t been there for more than a fortnight before he tracked me down and invited me to perform at his ‘Tae Sup Wi A Fifer’ night in Kirkcaldy. I can never tell when he’s taking the mick, but I can tell when he’s singing.\n\nAztec Camera: Jump\n\nThis is one of my favourite cover versions of all time, first heard on one of those NME cassettes. It seems wrong to pick Roddy and the band doing a cover when he’s such a phenomenal songwriter, but I do love this.\n\nCamera Obscura: Lloyd, I’m Ready To Be Heartbroken\n\nI could probably have submitted a list of ten Camera Obscura songs as my top 10 so picking just one was a chore! This band have been a constant presence in my life for fifteen years, through joy and heartbreak. ‘Lloyd, I’m Ready To Be Heartbroken’ is in my opinion, about as perfect a pop song as you’re ever going to hear.\n\nKathryn Joseph: The Bird\n\n‘The Bird’ was the first song I heard by Kathryn and I distinctly remember feeling as though I’d been hugged and winded simultaneously. When a song causes such a visceral reaction, you know it’s something extraordinary.\n\nFrightened Rabbit: Head Rolls Off\n\nI swapped out my chosen FR song numerous times, it’s almost impossible to pick just one. The Midnight Organ Fight is an album that means an incredible amount to so many people, including me. Scott’s lyrics, although often incredibly sombre, always offer hope. A chink of light in the darkness. No more so than on ‘Head Rolls Off’.\n\nYoung Fathers: Shame\n\nThe most exciting band to come out of Scotland in a long time. If you ever get the chance to see Young Fathers play live, take it! Trust me. ‘Shame’ is a vibrant, funky, thrilling four minutes.\n\nMogwai: Coolverine\n\nWhy do Mogwai just keep getting better? I caught them at Brixton Academy just before Christmas and (despite not being able to hear properly for two days afterwards – a lesson in why ear protectors at loud gigs are important!) it was one of the most incredible live shows I’ve been to. ‘Coolverine’, the opening track on Mogwai’s most recent album Every Country’s Sun, is otherworldly, guitar-heavy, gorgeous pop.\n\nThe Waterboys: The Whole of the Moon\n\nI was one in 1985 when ‘The Whole of the Moon’ was released. A track that’s wrapped up in lots of nostalgia; it reminds me of late 80s parties and sunburned nights in Spanish pubs on family holidays.\n\nMastersystem: Bird Is Bored Of Flying\n\nA project comprising Scott and Grant Hutchison of Frightened Rabbit and Justin and James Lockey of Editors and Minor Victories. There’s something really special about the juxtaposition of fuzzy, dirty, loud, gnarly rock music layered with Scott’s utterly heart-wrenching lyrics.\n\nThe Delgados: Accused Of Stealing\n\nThe beautifully dreamy ‘Accused Of Stealing’ was my gateway song as a latecomer to the band. Individually the members of The Delagdos have affected the landscape of Scottish music immeasurably through Chemikal Underground, Chem19 and Stewart’s work with the Scottish Music Industry Association and The SAY Award.\n\nDel Amitri: Driving With The Brakes On\n\n‘Driving With the Brakes On’ perfectly captures the feeling of being in a relationship that isn’t working out and tussling with whether or not to stick it out. Just a great song\n\nOut Lines: There Is A Saved Place\n\nAfter falling in love with Kathryn Joseph’s debut Bones You Have Thrown Me and Blood I’ve Spilled I couldn’t wait to hear what she did next and I was delighted to find out that she was in the studio with James Graham of The Twilight Sad. A match made in Scottish music heaven. ‘There Is A Saved Place’ is the stand-out track from the magnificent Confalts.\n\nBelle and Sebastian: If You’re Feeling Sinister\n\nBasically all Belle and Sebastian songs sound exactly like Glasgow but this one wins because of the wee Glaswegian boy at the beginning shouting “C’moooooon!” And also because I love it.\n\nMull Historical Society: Instead\n\nMeet me: 17, first year at Glasgow Uni, sat in the QMU (the indie student union), wearing my incredibly cool Mull Historical Society T-shirt, listening to this on my portable CD player. I relistened to ‘Instead’ recently and it’s still an absolute tune.\n\nThe Reindeer Section: Strike Me Down\n\nThis two-album supergroup featured members of Glasgow’s indie elite in the early 2000s, including Arab Strap, Mogwai, Idlewild, Snow Patrol and loads more. Their second album, Son of Evil Reindeer, is quietly excellent and this supersweet, and all too short, breakup song featuring Jenny Reeve and Eugene Kelly from The Vaselines is my favourite. You can listen to the track here.\n\nCamera Obscura: Knee Deep at the NPL\n\nThe Woodside Social Club was brilliant for lots of reasons: the orderly queue at the bar (despite rabble-rousingly cheap prices), the generous placement of giant fans around the dancefloor (to counteract the sauna-like temperatures), and stupidly fun club nights, including National Pop League, forever immortalised here.\n\nThe Blue Nile: Tinseltown in the Rain\n\nIt rains so much in Glasgow you kind of stop noticing after a while. Something about Paul Buchanan’s image of a big soggy, glittery city is exactly how I think about Glasgow on a Saturday night.\n\nPrimal Scream: Loaded\n\nThis song will forever remind me of both the most and least cool night of my life whereby, following a genuinely incendiary performance of ‘Loaded’ at the Barrowlands which saw the ballroom floor bouncing like a trampoline, I ended up backstage. With my parents.\n\nArab Strap: The First Big Weekend\n\nHalf song, half spoken-word, here Arab Strap perfectly capture long, bittersweet summer nights and days in Glasgow clubs, pubs, parks and hanging out round yer pal’s flat with a carry out.\n\nThe Blue Nile: From A Late Night Train\n\nIt's raining (again). You're trundling slowly home on the last train from Central Station. Someone's eating a sausage supper. This song is playing.\n\nErrors: Mr Milk\n\nMembers of Errors not only made me many a mean White Russian in Nice N Sleazys but this underrated tune soundtracked pretty much all of my nights out circa 2006-7.\n\nLiquid Liquid: Optimo\n\nOK, so it’s not technically a Scottish song but there are few things I miss more about Glasgow than Sunday nights at Optimo, the ever-enduring club night at the very excellent Sub Club. This belter by New York’s Liquid Liquid is where the night got its name.\n\nThe Vaselines: Molly’s Lips\n\nBonus track! Because nothing is more lo-fi Glasgow indie than a chorus with a honking horn.\n\nThe Delgados: Coming in From the Cold\n\nBonus track! Because Emma Pollock’s voice is magnificent on this.\n\nShamen: Move Any Mountain\n\nAberdeen’s finest, this song is timeless and possibly the most remixed ever. The track was also used for the Team Scotland entrance to the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nEurythmics: Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\n\nAnnie Lennox may have left Aberdeen earlier than Lord Byron but this synth pop tune released in 1983 the same year Aberdeen won the Cup Winners’ Cup is an absolute beauty.\n\nKathryn Joseph: The Bird\n\nThis Aberdeenshire quine is the Scottish Kate Bush and I was truly blown away at last year’s Running Up That Hill - A Celebration Of Kate Bush gig in Glasgow.\n\nSpare Snare: Bugs\n\nA Dundee band this was always first on my tape compilations I made for friends and family.\n\nDeacon Blue: Dignity\n\nAnother band with Dundee connections. This song always made me want to buy a dingy but was too scared to use it in the North Sea.\n\nArab Strap: Girls of the Summer\n\nThis a nostalgic reminder of listening to this track beside the Grand Canyon and loving the authentic Scottish voice so far away from home.\n\nVeronica Falls: Found Love in a Graveyard\n\nThis track from their debut album is a wonderful symbol of the immense music of Patrick Doyle, who sadly died this year.\n\nThe Pastels: Worlds of Possibility\n\nAnnabel Wright has the most dreamlike voice that is epitomised in this track and Stephen McRobbie worked in a library too.\n\nFuture Pilot AKA: Witchi Tai To\n\nThis track from the Tiny Waves, Mighty Sea album from the former Soup Dragon is majestic. You can listen to the track here.\n\nBIS: Kandy Pop\n\nI went to see BIS supporting Super Furry Animals at Lucifer Mills, Dundee, and the sheer youthful exuberance made them the best support act ever.\n\nTeenage Fanclub: What You Do to Me\n\nForget ‘Flower of Scotland’ or ‘Scotland the Brave’, this is the true indie anthem of Scotland.\n\nBeta Band: Dr Baker\n\nI love the piano on this track from the 3Eps, it’s always a stand out."
