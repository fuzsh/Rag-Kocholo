        "text": "LAWS OF NORTH CAROLINA, 1784.\n\nAt a General Assembly begun and held at Hillsborough, on the Nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Eighty Four, and in the Eighth Year of the Independence of the Said State: Being the first session of this Assembly. Alexander Martin, Esq., Governor.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nAn Act to amend an Act, intituled, An Act for ascertaining what property in this State shall be deemed taxable property, the method of assessing the same, and collecting public Taxes.\n\nI. Be it Enacted by the General Asembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby Enacted by the authority of the same, that all lands as described by the aforementioned Act, town lots with their improvements, all free males and servants twenty-one years old or upwards, and all slaves male and female between the age of twelve and fifty years within this State, shall be subject to the payment of public taxes, and the public taxes on such property and persons shall be assessed and proportioned as follows, viz: All lands shall be liable to be taxed by the quantity, and freemen and male servants twenty-one years old and upwards, and slaves male and female between the age of twelve and fifty years, shall be subject to a poll-tax.\n\nII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the public tax on each and every poll shall be equal to the public tax on three hundred acres of land, and town lots with their improvements shall be valued as herein after directed.\n\nIII. And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the sheriff of each and every county shall within forty days after the passing of this Act, summon the several justices of the peace within his respective county to attend at the court house, or usual place of holding court, within ten days after the date of such summons, and the said justices, or any five of them so meeting, are hereby authorised and directed to appoint one justice of the peace for every captain's district in such county, and where there shall be a town one for such town, to receive lists of taxable property in such district and town respectively, and the justices when so appointed, shall without delay fix the time and place in each district and town for receiving lists of taxable property; and in order that all the inhabitants may be apprised in due time that such lists are to be received, the justice of each district and town shall order and direct one of the constables to warn every family in such district of the time and place appointed for receiving lists of taxables at least five days previous to such time. Provided always, that if the court of any county shall set within forty days after the passing of this Act, then the sheriff shall warn the justices to attend at such court for the purposes aforesaid, and the court shall appoint the justices for the several districts in their county.\n\nIV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the inhabitants of the respective districts in each county shall attend at the time and place so to be appointed, and shall return on oath in writing to the\n\njustices appointed to receive the same, the quantity of land, the particular tracts, the counties in which the same lie, with the number of free males and servants twenty-one years old and upwards, the number of slaves male and female between the age of twelve and fifty years, which to him belonged, or who lived in his family, and the number of town lots of which he was possessed on the first day of April then last past; and the oath to be administered by the justices receiving such lists shall be as follows: “You —— do swear or affirm (as the case may be) that this list by you delivered, contains a just and true account of all the property for which by law you are subject to pay taxes, to the best of your knowledge and belief. So help you God.”\n\nV. And in order to ascertain the value of town lots with their improvements, Be it enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the justices of the peace when met upon the summons of the sheriff as aforesaid, or in the county court if such court should be held within the time hereinbefore limited, shall nominate and appoint three freeholders in each town within their respective counties, who being duly sworn, shall value the lots in such town with their improvements, to the full value thereof respectively and such valuation shall be subject to public taxation, as follows, to-wit: The same tax shall be paid upon every hundred pounds value of such town lots as shall be paid upon every three hundred acres of land, and where they shall not all agree in the value, the agreement of any two of them shall be returned as the true value, but where they all disagree, then the different valuation of three shall be added together, and one third of the amount of the whole shall be deemed the true value of the property.\n\nVI. And whereas there are generally in the towns of this State lots and improvements the property of persons living at a distance, or without the bounds of such towns, by reason of which such property if returned only by the proprietors would not come to the hands of the assessors; for remedy whereof, Be it Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that all property in the several towns shall be returned by the tenants or occupiers thereof unless returned by the proprietors thereof, or the agent, attorneys, trustee or guardian of the proprietor; and when returned by the tenant or occupier, such tenant or occupier shall be liable to pay the taxes thereon assessed, but the absent owner or person in whose care the same shall be, shall nevertheless return such lots in his general return, specifying at the same time in whose actual possession, or under whose immediate superintendency the same may be.\n\nVII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the justices who shall be appointed to receive the lists of taxable property, and the assessors in every town, shall make fair returns of their lists and assessments respectively to their respective county courts next after such list shall be received and assessments made, and the justices shall in their return (exclusive of the original lists received by them) distinguish the persons names, the several tracts of land, the quantity and situation of each tract, the town lots and number of polls white and black, in the following manner, viz:\n\nAnd the assessors in their return shall distinguish the different town lots, the situation and value thereof, with the amount of each person's property in lots, viz::\n\nVIII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the clerk of each court shall record at large in alphabetical order, the annual returns to be made by the justices and assessors in his county, and the court shall and may make a reasonable allowance for such service, to be paid out of the county tax; and if any person appointed to receive lists of taxable property, or to assess town lots, shall fail or neglect to discharge the duty of his appointment, the person so failing or neglecting shall forfeit and pay the sum of one hundred pounds, to be recovered in any court of record having cognizance thereof, in the name of the Governor, to the use of the State; and if any master or mistress of a family, his or her agents, factors, managers or attornies, after due notice given as before directed, shall fail or neglect to attend and return inventories for his or her taxable property in manner before mentioned, each and every person so failing shall forfeit and pay the sum of fifty pounds, to be recovered and applied as in the case last mentioned, and the person so failing, or neglecting, shall pay a double tax, the number of polls belonging to the person neglecting as aforesaid to be reported by the justice to the best of his knowledge, and if any executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, agent or attorney, shall after due notice fail to return an inventory to the justice appointed to receive the same of the taxable property in his trust or possession, the property of the testator, intestate, minor or absentee, shall be liable to a double tax, and the justice shall report the same to the best of his knowledge or information; and such double tax shall be levied of the proper estate of such executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, agent or attorney.\n\nIX. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any person residing out of the State shall fail, by himself, his agent or attorney, to return an inventory of his taxable property, the lands shall be liable to double tax, and the taxable polls if any shall be reported by the justices as aforesaid, and the tax shall be levied thereon in the usual way, provided there be personal estate sufficient to pay the same; but if there shall be no personal estate, or not sufficient to pay the tax, and such tax shall remain unpaid for twelve months after it becomes due, then the lands or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay the tax, with contingent charges, shall be sold by the sheriff by order of the county court, and the sheriff shall account for the same as in other cases.\n\nX. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the several justices appointed to receive lists of taxables, shall make return of their\n\nown lists to the county court, or to some other justice; and the property of assessors of town lots shall be assessed by the county court: And if any justice appointed to receive lists of taxable property, or any assessor of town lots, shall die, refuse to act, or remove out of the county, before the duty of his appointment shall be performed, any three justices of such county may be and they are hereby authorised and directed to appoint another to act in the place of such person so dying, refusing to act, or removing, and the person so appointed shall be on the same footing in all respects as if he had been originally appointed; and the several county courts shall and may allow the assessors of town lots in their respective counties a reasonable sum for their services, which allowance being certified by the clerk of the court, shall be paid by the sheriff out of the public tax, and such sheriff shall be allowed for the same in the settlement of his public accounts.\n\nXI. And be it further Enacted by authority aforesaid, that every person holding lands by title of dower, curtesy or other estate, for life, or on lease for five years or more, computing from the commencement of such lease to the end of the term, shall return an inventory of such estate, and pay the public taxes thereon as in other cases. Provided always, That any person incurring any of the penalties in this act mentioned for omitting to return his list of taxable property, may apply to the county court to which the list shall be returned, or to the next succeeding court, and such court upon sufficient reasons shewn may remit the penalties.\n\nXII. Be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that at the first court in every county to be held next after the first day of April, in every year after the present, such court shall appoint a justice of the peace for each district in the county to receive lists of taxable property for the then present year, and where there shall be any town or towns, three assessors for every town, and the clerk of each county court shall furnish each justice within twenty days after his appointment, with a fair alphabetical copy at large of the list of taxable property within his district the preceding year, under the penalty of ten pounds for each neglect, to be recovered by action of debt in the Governor's name, in any court having cognizance thereof, and to be applied to the use of the State.\n\nXIII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no person being a justice of the peace shall be a collector of public taxes.\n\nXIV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that if any person shall be possessed of any land for which he is unwilling to pay taxes, he may apply to the court to which the returns of taxable property shall be made by the justices, and by the said court shall be permitted to enter on record such unwillingness, which when done shall operate forever thereafter as a surrender of such lands to the State, and shall be thenceforth liable to be taken up and secured by any person who will perform such requisites as the law directs.\n\nXV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that so much of the Act aforesaid, intituled, An Act for ascertaining what property in this State shall be deemed taxable property, the method of assessing the same, and collecting the public taxes, as relates to stock in trade, slaves under the age of twelve years or over fifty, wheel carriages, horses, mules and cattle and so much of the said Act as comes within the purview of this Act be, and the same is hereby repealed.\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAn Act for altering the time of holding the Annual Elections, and Annual Assemblies, and directing the manner of electing Annual Officers for the succeeding year.\n\nI. Whereas by holding the annual assemblies in the month of April great inconveniences arise to the members thereof, and others whose private business requires their attendance; many persons being thereby prevented from cultivating their farms on which their means of subsistence depends, which makes it difficult and frequently impossible for many of the members to render the necessary services to the public without manifest injury to themselves: And whereas most if not all the States in the Union have their annual elections in autumn, and their annual Assemblies in the winter, which makes it necessary for the Congress of the United States to settle and adjust the quota of each State at a period long preceding the annual Assemblies for this State, so that the requisitions made to support the union cannot be complied with in proper time: For remedy whereof,\n\nII. Be it Enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby Enacted by the authority of the same, that for the future the annual elections of members of the General Assembly shall commence on the third Friday in August in every year, and be held and concluded agreeable to law, and that the next annual election shall begin on the third Friday of August in the present year, in the manner before directed, of which annual elections the sheriffs of the respective counties in this State are hereby directed and required to give due notice by advertisement as the law directs.\n\nIII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the next annual meeting of the General Assembly shall be held on the first Monday in October next after the passing of this Act, and on the first Monday in October in each succeeding year; and that it shall and may be lawful for the General Assembly at their next annual meeting to choose a Governor, council of State, and other annual officers, to succeed those chosen and appointed by this present General Assembly, as soon as the full service of the present officers shall be expired, and to continue in office until the annual Assembly which shall meet in October in the then succeeding year shall make new appointments.\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nAn Act vesting a power in the United States in Congress assembled to levy a Duty on Foreign Merchandize, for the use of the United States.\n\nI. Whereas by a resolve of the United States in Congress assembled, of the eighteenth of April, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-three, it is recommended to the several States as indispensably necessary to the restoration of public credit, and to the punctual and honourable discharge of the public debts, to invest the United States in Congress assembled with a power to levy for the use of the United States, certain duties herein after mentioned upon goods imported into the said States from any foreign port, island or plantation; and the necessity of complying with this recommendation being evident.\n\nII. Be it therefore Enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina, and it is hereby Enacted by the authority of the same, that the United States in Congress assembled shall be, and they are hereby\n\nauthorised and impowered to levy for the use of the United States, the following duties upon goods imported into this State from any foreign port, island or plantation: Upon all rum, Jamaica proof per gallon four ninetieths of a dollar, upon all other spiritous liquors per gallon three ninetieths of a dollar, upon Madeira wine per gallon twelve ninetieths of a dollar, upon all other wines per gallon, six ninetieths of a dollar, upon common bohea tea per pound six ninetieths of a dollar, upon all other teas per pound twenty-four ninetieths of a dollar, upon pepper per pound three ninetieths of a dollar, upon brown sugar per pound half a ninetieth of a dollar, upon loaf sugar per pound two ninetieths of a dollar, upon all other sugars per pound one ninetieth of a dollar, upon molasses per gallon one ninetieth of a dollar, upon cocoa and coffee per pounds one ninetieth of a dollar, upon all other goods a duty of five per cent. ad valorem, at the time and place of importation.\n\nIII. Provided always, that none of the said duties shall be applied to any other purpose than the discharge of the principal or interest of the debt contracted on the faith of the United States for supporting the war, nor be continued for a longer term than twenty-five years: And provided also, that the collectors of the said duties shall be appointed by this State, but when appointed shall be ameanable to, and removable by the United States in Congress assembled.\n\nIV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that in case the legislative or executive power of this State shall not have previously appointed collectors of the said duties, or shall not appoint such collectors and every of them within one month after notice shall be given by Congress for that purpose, or shall fail to make such appointment upon any vacancy by death, resignation or removal from office, the United States in Congress assembled shall and may appoint collectors or a collector of the said States, as the case may require. Provided always, that the person or persons so to be appointed be a citizen or citizens of this State.\n\nV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the United States in Congress assembled shall have, and they are hereby invested with full power and authority to levy and collect the said duties under such regulations as they shall direct: Provided, that such regulations shall not subject any person to be carried out of this State, nor to be tried in any other manner than the laws and constitution direct, nor to impower any collector to break open any house or store, or any other place in which customable goods which have not paid duty are suspected to be concealed with an intention to avoid the payment of the same, unless such collector shall make oath before some magistrate of the county where such goods are supposed to be concealed in writing, subscribed by the party making such oath that he has good and sufficient reason to believe that such goods are so concealed, and with such design; whereupon the said justice shall grant his warrant for breaking and entering such house to a constable or other executive officer, who in the execution of the said warrant shall be attended by two freeholders and the said justice. And provided also, that the trials on all seizures made in virtue of the regulations to be made by Congress for the collection of the said duties shall be in and before some court of record in this State having cognizance thereof.\n\nVI. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that no collector to be appointed for the collection of the said duties shall be eligible to a seat in the General Assembly of this State, or hold any place of profit in this State or any of the United States (the collection of such duties as are or may be imposed on imports for the use of this State only excepted) nor\n\nshall be an importer or in any wise concerned or interested directly or indirectly in carrying on any trade or commerce in any of the articles on which duties are by this Act imposed.\n\nVII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, that every of the collectors appointed for carrying the purposes of this Act into effect shall before entering on the duties of his office take the following oath, to-wit: “I, A. B., do solemnly swear or affirm (as the case may be) that I will not directly or indirectly in my own name, or in the name of any person or persons, carry on or be concerned in interest in carrying on any trade or commerce in any of the articles on which duties are imposed by an Act, intituled, An Act for vesting a power in the United States in Congress assembled to levy a duty on foreign merchandize for the use of the United States, during my continuance in office.” Which oath shall be taken before any justice of the peace in the county wherein such collectors respectively reside.\n\nVIII.

SO HELP ME GOD.” And the same oath shall be taken by the collectors of the duties on imports to be imposed by Congress, anything in the act passed this present session for impowering the United States in Congress assembled to levy a duty on imports notwithstanding; which bonds shall and may be executed, and oath taken before the Governor or commander-in-chief or in any court of record, or before any of the judges: and if any naval officer or collector shall be convicted of being concerned or interested in any commerce\n\ncontrary to the true intent and meaning of the said oath he shall be adjudged incapable of holding his office.\n\nIII.

B., master of the vessel called the ——, do swear or affirm, that I will make diligent enquiry and search in my said vessel for all concealed persons of whatever denomination, degree or condition; and that I will not wittingly or willingly carry, or suffer to be carried therein out of this State, or to be taken on board thereof after my departure therefrom, without such pass or certificate as is required by law, any person or persons whatsoever inhabitants of the said State; nor will I carry or suffer to be carried or received as aforesaid, any servant or slave that is not attending his or her master or mistress, unless such servant or slave shall be sent to be transported by such master or mistress, or some other person having authority, for some special purpose. SO HELP ME GOD.”\n\nIV.

And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That such collectors when so appointed, shall be ameanable to, and removable by the United States in Congress assembled; and in case of death, resignation or removal of any collector, a successor shall be appointed within thirty days after the United States in Congress assembled shall give notice for that purpose by the General Assembly, if sitting, and if not by the Governor with the advice of the council of state; and if in case the General Assembly or the Governor and council shall neglect to supply a vacancy occasioned as aforesaid within the term of thirty days after notice as aforesaid, power is hereby given to the United States in Congress assembled to supply and fill the same with some citizen of this State, who shall not proceed to execute the office of collector until he has given bond and taken the oath aforesaid, which oath the county court is hereby authorized and required to administer.\n\nV. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the collectors shall attend by themselves or their deputies in the several districts in their respective counties, one day at least in the month of March in each and every year, previously giving due notice of the time and place, to receive from the inhabitants of such district the taxes herein before mentioned; and if any person after being lawfully notified as aforesaid, shall neglect or refuse to pay the same on or before the first day of April in every year, such collectors may, and they are hereby impowered by themselves or their deputies to levy the same by distress and sale of the goods and chattels of such delinquent; and shall be entitled to take and receive for such distress four shillings and no more.

And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if the tax on the real estate of persons residing out of this State, or of the inhabitants thereof who have not any personal property therein, shall not be discharged within one year after the same becomes due, then such estate or so much thereof as shall be necessary to discharge such tax, with all contingent charges, shall be sold by the collector by order of the county court, a particular and special return being made for that purpose.\n\nVII.

Provided nevertheless, That should the tax established as aforesaid yield a sum exceeding\n\nthe said proportion of one hundred and nine thousand and six dollars the excess shall be refunded to this State.\n\nVIII. And be it further Enacted by the authority aforesaid, That this Act shall be and continue in force for the space of twenty-five years, in the nature of a grant sacred and inviolable by this State without the concurrence of the whole or a majority of the United States in Congress assembled, as soon as the United States in Congress assembled shall notify the General Assembly of this State, or the Governor or commander-in-chief for the time being, during their recess, that all the other States in the confederation have passed Acts vesting the United States in Congress assembled with power to levy in their respective States like taxes, to be appropriated in like manner, and for the space of twenty-five years, in the nature of a grant sacred and irrevocable by any one or more of them without the concurrence of the whole or a majority of the United States in Congress assembled.
