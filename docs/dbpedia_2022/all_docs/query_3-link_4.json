        "text": "How do we define community? üë• ‚ú≥ A quick Google search will show a group of people living in the same place or having a particular characteristic in common. In our interconnected world, community transcends geographical boundaries. It's about shared values, experiences, and journeys. We believe that community is about choice and empowerment. It's the freedom to connect with those who resonate with our individual paths and aspirations. At Mind the Gap Connect we're passionate about fostering these meaningful connections. As former international students turned founders, we intimately understand the power of community support. Our journey has been enriched by the solidarity of fellow founders and students. However, we've also witnessed the challenges and struggles that can arise along the way and the gaps in available support. It can be overwhelming and daunting to navigate the challenges alone. That's why we've made it our mission to give back. Through our work, we aim to bring together individuals who share similar journeys and empower them by providing resources to strengthen their communities and enhance their mental well-being. Join us in building a community where everyone feels seen, heard, and supported. Together, let's empower each other to thrive on our unique paths. #Community #Empowerment #MentalWellbeing Picture captured at the State Library Victoria's StartSpace Founders Fair by Carmen Zammit\n\nA big thank you to our partners @Hackney Council, and @Here East for inviting us to contribute to 'Diversity in Tech 2024'. At Slenky, we're all about breaking barriers and opening doors to exciting career opportunities for everyone, regardless of whoever they are, wherever they're from. We've long been championing early engagement with diverse young talent, and many young people who've used Slenky have found their way into well-paid careers in Tech, so we're looking forward to diving into this important conversation. In today's ever-evolving job market, businesses are realising the importance of using tech to connect with wider and more diverse audiences - today and into the future ‚Äì and that's where Slenky comes in. While our industry (and let's face it, many others) has been talking about diversity for years, actions speak louder than words. It's time to turn those conversations into meaningful change. If you're still wondering what Slenky is and how it works, you can find out here: https://tinyurl.com/slenky If you want to join the conversation at Plexal on Monday 10th June, reserve your spot here ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/gk4seJig Brent Council | London Borough of Havering | Enfield Council | London Borough of Waltham Forest | London Borough of Redbridge | London Borough of Tower Hamlets | London Borough of Newham | London Borough of Barking and Dagenham | Central London Forward | Cubet | White Light | Rianna Johnson | Brandon Okeke | Pavneet Kaur | Maria Olariu | Shivani Mehla | Raquel Labrador | Rushil Shah\n\nLet‚Äôs break down the community engagement component of our Venture Cooperative cohort sessions: üíªOur team will hold office hours for small groups (8-10 people). These sessions offer a space for in-depth discussions and questions not answered during class. ‚òïWe facilitate virtual coffee chats between fellows to ensure you‚Äôre fostering meaningful connections within the group. üìùIf you find a company that fits our investment strategy, share it with us. You‚Äôll be involved in the investment process and receive upside if we make the investment. ü§ùWe occasionally host events, mainly in New York City, for face-to-face interactions and deeper connections. üìàFellows can engage in paid research projects with our investment team, diving deep into specific topics. üó£We encourage fellows to lead sessions on their areas of expertise, fostering peer-to-peer learning. Our cohort sessions are designed to provide you with the support, connections, and opportunities needed to thrive. Think this might be a good fit for you? Apply for our next cohort here: https://lnkd.in/e7_kJzUS\n\nThe power of community lies in its network effects. The more people who join and contribute, the more valuable and impactful the community becomes. This realization has been a striking epiphany for me, especially in the aftermath of Raleigh-Durham Startup Week. As I continue to connect with individuals and engage in conversations, I'm beginning to see the immense potential of the second derivative of growth. By fostering integration, interconnectedness, and mutual support within our community, we can accelerate our collective progress and achieve remarkable things. So, my challenge to you is this: When was the last time you reached out to someone in your network or an adjacent network? Have you made an effort to connect with people from different regions, groups, specializations, or levels of expertise? By actively growing our network and supporting one another, we contribute to the community network effect and unlock the magic of collaboration. Here in the Triangle area, we are fortunate to have a welcoming and inclusive community. By reducing the friction in making connections, we create an environment where ideas can flourish, and innovation can thrive. I'm eager to hear your thoughts and learn about the projects you're working on. How do you believe you can contribute to the community network effect? Let's embrace the power of community. #networking #community #collaboration #innovation\n\nCommunity matters in tech. In the fast-paced world of tech, it's easy to get laser-focused on building the next big thing. But we believe true innovation thrives when we connect and collaborate. Strong communities cultivate a vibrant exchange of ideas, spark problem-solving, and create an avenue for tackling industry challenges. Whether it's volunteering for STEM education initiatives, participating in hackathons, sponsoring local meetups, or otherwise ‚Äì being involved makes a difference. We're curious! How does your team or company give back to the tech community? Share your stories and inspire others in the comments! #Community #TechCommunity #CultivateCommunity\n\nCommunity is one of our top priorities at V School. Why do we strive to integrate and connect our community, encompassing alumni, students, mentors, company affiliates, and staff? 1. Shared Learning and Growth: Being part of a community provides you with the opportunity to learn from others, share your knowledge, and collectively grow. 2. Networking Opportunities: Building relationships within your field can open doors to job opportunities, collaborations, and mentorship, which are crucial for success in tech. 3. Support and Encouragement: Having a support system that understands your struggles, can offer guidance, and encourages you to persevere through obstacles. 4. Diversity and Inclusion: Tech communities often embrace diversity and inclusion, fostering an environment where people from all backgrounds can thrive. This diversity of perspectives fuels innovation and creativity. 5. Giving Back and Making an Impact: Whether through volunteering, mentoring, or sharing your expertise, you can contribute to positive change in the tech world and individual lives.

Connect peers. Facilitate encounters. Build a community. üéØ Some of my core tasks as organisational developer at Eos Cares. üôÇ Some of the many reasons why I like my job despite the challenging circumstances and the lack of perspectives. I still remember the times when talking to my childrens` preschool teachers was the only social connection outside the house for a whole day, sometimes even more. I still remember the times when I felt lost, lonely, desoriented and overwhelmed as an international newcomer to Sweden. Therefore I know that there is a huge need for the kind of activities and meeting platforms that we offer to the international community in Lund. üöÄ Therefore I know that there is a huge potential to develop our association and our activities even further in future. üå± Want to be a part of it? Join us as member, volunteer, intern, collaboration partner, sponsor‚Ä¶ Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much. ü§ù Learn more about the association and how to become a member: https://lnkd.in/d3wWXgSG (webpage still in progress üòè ...)

The impetus for their endeavor was the stark realization of the technological disparities laid bare by COVID-19, especially in low-income families during the shift to remote learning. D√°ndole Tech's mission crystallized: bridge the Digital Divide by providing repurposed technology, digital literacy, and app development education to students, not just as a means of enlightenment but as a comprehensive tech learning journey. Recognizing the impact of accessible technology on education, the organization collaborates with community entities to narrow the gap, emphasizing the integration of technology into curriculums to enhance student learning and engagement. The focus of D√°ndole Tech is on the West Humboldt Park (WHP) community, an underserved area with a diverse demographic, where 48% of residents are Latino and 47% are African-American. The median household income is a mere $20,038, starkly contrasting with the Chicagoland area's median income. Despite these challenges, the community's strength lies in its rich history, partnerships, and residents' resilience, who continually find innovative ways to combat oppression, addiction, and poverty. The organization aims to empower these students to become future tech leaders and bridge the socioeconomic gaps prevalent in their community. Looking ahead three to five years, D√°ndole Tech envisions a dedicated space offering tech classes, workshops, mentorship programs, financial resources, job opportunities, and a robust support system. The goal is to create an environment where students can thrive, breaking free from the constraints of the Digital Divide. . . #D√°ndoleTech #GivingTech #FreeTechnology #HumboldtPark #FreeTechClasses #TechMarketplace #Technology #Business #Innovation #Marketing #Networking #Events #FiresideChat #NetworkingEvent #GoldCoastSocial #GoldCoast #Chicago #TonyPsNetworkingEvents\n\nüì¢Calling all changemakers, good troublemakers, and innovators in Greater Boston: If you want to join a dynamic multi-racial, cross-class, intergenerational community of peers, apply to GenUnity's Fall Fellowship programs!
