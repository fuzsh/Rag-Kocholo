        "text": "DâArcy believed that the shape of an organism was like âa diagram of forcesâ and its formation was the result of physical laws operating according to predictable mathematical patterns. His controversial Theory of Transformations sought to demonstrate the mathematical relationships between related species by âtransformingâ one to another through simple distortions.\n\nDâArcy Thompson was born and educated in Edinburgh. He initially enrolled at Edinburgh University to study medicine, but biology was his real passion and he soon moved to Cambridge to take a degree in Natural Sciences. At the age of just 24 he was appointed to the first Chair of Biology at the newly established University College, Dundee. He spent over 32 years in Dundee, building up an impressive Museum of Zoology and developing his ideas of applying mathematics to biology. In 1917 he moved to the University of St Andrews to take up the Chair of Natural History, spending the remaining 31 years of his life there and becoming a much-loved (and increasingly eccentric) figure in the town.\n\nAs a child, DâArcy grew up with a fascination for the natural world but also a love of art. His uncle, George Clark Stanton, was an artist and painted this charming study of the young DâArcy aged about four or five, showing his vivid ginger hair. One of DâArcyâs schoolfriends, the future physiologist Diarmid Noel Paton, was the son of the great historical and mythological painter Sir Joseph Noel Paton. An early research interest of DâArcyâs was animal symbolism in classical art and he later knew and corresponded with many leading artists including Laura Knight and Stanley Cursiter.\n\nThe first artist to respond directly to DâArcyâs ideas was the Dundee symbolist painter George Dutch Davidson. In 1900, DâArcy commissioned Davidson to paint a series of murals for his study at the University, but sadly Davidson died before the work could be carried out, leaving just a pencil study for the first mural, showing Orpheus surrounded by animals. This study (and particularly Davidsonâs stylised rendition of leaves in it) later inspired the artist Marion Smith to create a sculptural piece, Missing Leaves (which you can also see on Art UK), and this companion print, United Leaves.\n\nThe sculptor Henry Moore was the first major artist to discover DâArcy Thompsonâs book On Growth and Form. He first read it as an art student in Leeds in 1919, returning to it in the 1930s when it had a huge influence on his use of biomorphic shapes. Sculptures such as this one give the impression of having grown organically.\n\nThe influence of DâArcyâs work can be strongly seen in Mooreâs graphic works, including a series of Transformation Drawings in the 1930s and prints such as this one featuring mathematical and organic forms. This lithograph was created for the School Prints series â a scheme that aimed to bring high-quality contemporary art into schools. Mooreâs print used a pioneering technique in which the artist drew directly onto a series of transparent plastic plates.\n\nMoore began discussing On Growth and Form with the art critic Herbert Read, who perhaps did more than anyone to spread interest in DâArcyâs work among artists. Read wrote about it in his book Art and Industry (1934) and lent his copy of On Growth and Form to artists that he thought would be particularly inspired by it. This imaginative portrait of Read was by Patrick Heron, another artist who would be inspired by DâArcyâs work.\n\nIn particular Read introduced On Growth and Form to many of the St Ives circle of artists in the 1930s. For these pioneers of abstract art in Britain, DâArcyâs work shared their concern with revealing hidden structures of life. One of the group was Barbara Hepworth, who believed that modern art and science shared a common progressive attitude. Her long-term friend, crystallographer J D Bernal, wrote of her work: âThere is an extraordinary intuitive grasp of the unity of a surface even extending to surfaces which though separated in space and apparently disconnected yet belong together both to the mathematicians and the sculptor.â\n\nNaum Gabo was particularly enthusiastic, purchasing his own copy of On Growth and Form soon after coming to Britain in 1936, and is known to have discussed its contents appreciatively with friends and fellow artists. Like Hepworth, he believed in the creative affinity between science and art, and the intricate nature of constructions such as this closely resembles the illustrations in On Growth and Form of the skeletons of radiolaria.\n\nThe painter Paul Nash also owned a copy of On Growth and Form. In this painting an egg-like form leans against another object of similar shape covered with a grid that looks remarkably like one of DâArcyâs transformation diagrams.\n\nThe Hungarian-born LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy spent two years in Britain in 1935-7 and met some of the St Ives artists. This may have been where he discovered DâArcyâs work, which he embraced enthusiastically. He began to incorporate its ideas into his teaching in Chicago and made references to On Growth and Form in his posthumously published book Vision in Motion (1947), which helped spread DâArcyâs influence to a new generation of artists.\n\nUniquely among the modernist artists who were inspired by On Growth and Form, Wilhelmina Barns-Graham actually knew DâArcy when she was a child in St Andrews. However it was only when she moved to St Ives in 1940 that she âdiscovered his wonderful enlightening book Growth & Form.â She was particularly drawn to his ideas on the relation between inner space and outer form, and his discussion of spiral growth patterns and the golden ratio informed many of her works.\n\nAnother Scottish artist based in England, William Johnstone was perhaps the first to introduce ideas from On Growth and Form into British art teaching, firstly at Camberwell School of Art & Crafts and then at the Central School of Arts & Crafts. His promotion of Basic Design principles was inspired by Bauhaus artists such as Paul Klee, who had also been enthused by DâArcyâs work. Johnstone employed Victor Pasmore to teach at both of these art schools, and may also have introduced him to On Growth and Form.\n\nIn 1942 DâArcy Thompson published a long-awaited second edition of On Growth and Form (which had been out of print for many years). It was enthusiastically reviewed by Herbert Read, but it may have been through Moholy-Nagyâs book Vision in Motion that a group of young artists at the Slade School of Fine Art after the war discovered DâArcyâs ideas. They included Richard Hamilton, who was profoundly influenced by On Growth and Form, and in 1951 staged a landmark exhibition called Growth and Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. It featured a range of scientific models and imagery, much of it drawn from DâArcyâs book.\n\nNigel Henderson first read On Growth and Form in 1949 and it was he who suggested it to Richard Hamilton as a theme for an exhibition, describing it as a âvery timelyâ¦ piece of intellectual scaffolding.â Henderson contributed various pieces to the Growth and Form exhibition, as well as documenting the show through his photographs.\n\nEduardo Paolozzi first discovered On Growth and Form in the late 1940s while he was living in Paris with William Turnbull, a fellow graduate from the Slade. Paolozzi had a particular fascination with biological forms and molecular imagery â his sculptures from this time explore the complex development of living forms.\n\nThe Dundee-born sculptor William Turnbull was staying in Paris with Paolozzi when he discovered DâArcyâs work. He too was fascinated by organic form as well as contemporary developments in molecular chemistry and nuclear physics, and the two sculptors explored many of these ideas together. Turnbull also designed a poster for Hamiltonâs Growth and Form exhibition.\n\nVictor Pasmore may have discovered On Growth and Form through William Johnstone, who employed him to teach at both Camberwell School of Art & Crafts and the Central School of Arts & Crafts. Pasmore became fascinated by natural patterns such as waves and spiral forms. In 1954, Pasmore was appointed Master of Painting at the Department of Fine Art in Kingâs College, Newcastle (now Newcastle University). Richard Hamilton had recently joined the Design School there and the two artists worked together to devise a revolutionary new Basic Design Course. On Growth and Form was a key text for this, and students were set exercises based directly on its ideas. The course was soon taken up by art schools across England and Wales.\n\nA post-war graduate of the Slade like Richard Hamilton, Adrian Heath had also spent time in St Ives and was closely associated with Victor Pasmore and other Constructivist artists. It is no surprise, then, that On Growth and Form became an important influence on his work in the 1950s.\n\nIt was not just in Britain that artists were reading On Growth and Form. The Surrealist artist Salvador DalÃ­ was fascinated by DâArcyâs descriptions of radiolaria, sea urchins and the patterns made by drops of milk. He referred to On Growth and Form repeatedly in his 1948 book Fifty Secrets of Magic Craftsmanship.\n\nIn America, the abstract expressionists also embraced DâArcyâs work. Jackson Pollock owned a copy of On Growth and Form, and may have been particularly interested in its analysis of drops and splash patterns. Although Pollockâs paintings appear random and chaotic, like the natural world DâArcy describes they are actually the result of a carefully ordered structure.\n\nMany architects have been directly inspired by DâArcyâs ideas, including Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Buckminster Fuller, Frei Otto and Norman Foster. For JÃ¸rn Utzon, architect of the Sydney Opera House, On Growth and Form was so fundamental to his practice that it was âthe only book he specifically recommended new staff to readâ. Le Corbusier began to draw on DâArcyâs work with his Project for a Museum of Unlimited Growth in 1931 and 20 years later he performed the official opening of Richard Hamiltonâs Growth and Form exhibition.\n\nAs well as painters and sculptors, On Growth and Form has influenced artists in other fields, including some of the pioneers of computer art such as Roy Ascott and Desmond Paul Henry (not currently represented on Art UK). Land artists in particular have been drawn to DâArcyâs exploration of natural patterns - Robert Smithsonâs Spiral Jetty (1970) is perhaps the most celebrated example, and much of Andy Goldsworthyâs work shows a strong influence.\n\nOver the past decade, the University of Dundee has been building a collection of art responding to DâArcyâs work, much of it acquired thanks to an Art Fund RENEW grant. Peter Randall-Pageâs sculpture In the Beginning is situated at one of the entrances to the Carnelley Building which houses the DâArcy Thompson Zoology Museum. Inspired by cells multiplying, it is made of Kilkenny limestone and contains numerous micro-fossils such as foraminifera, the organisms that first inspired DâArcyâs interest in applying mathematics to biology.\n\nWill Maclean is Emeritus Professor of Fine Art at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design in Dundee. Much of his work concerns the symbolic meanings of artefacts from the past, so museum collections have always held a fascination for him. DâArcy Thompsonâs desire to collect, catalogue and explain the natural world formed the basis of a series of mixed media box constructions made by the artist in 2007-8. The various elements featured here represent different aspects of Thompsonâs work and interests, including morphology, marine biology, geometry and Classics.\n\nCoded Chimera was a research project by sculptor Bruce Gernand, working with the Natural History Museum and the Cambridge Computer Lab. The project explored the ideas of morphogenesis (the study of biological dynamics) pioneered by DâArcy. Inspired by the iconic transformation diagrams, Gernand used digital scans of zoological specimens and customised computer software tools to morph different animal forms to create hybrid shapes. The rapid prototype models that resulted make connections between the processes of sculpture and DâArcyâs ideas of growth and form, but they also link to the ancient cultural tradition of the chimera.\n\nAndy Lomas is an artist who also works as a special effects designer (among many film and TV credits, he was a CGI supervisor on Avatar). Generated by computer algorithms, his artworks stem directly from DâArcyâs study of organic forms and the simple mathematical rules that affect their growth. The shapes are created by a process of accretion over time - they are grown by simulating the paths of millions of particles flowing in a field of forces.\n\nThe imagery of this painting suggests cellular forms, but its layers of overlapping shapes imply a blurring of what is solid and what is transparent. The technical process of making the work is a major concern to artist Mark Wright. He uses different paints and techniques to create compositions that have a three-dimensional quality, but one that is impossible to pin down on closer inspection. The gradual growth and form of the painting itself is of vital importance in his practice, echoing DâArcyâs ideas.\n\nSculptor Alex Flett created the first version of The Snail as an art student in 1969, after reading On Growth and Form. The early version was destroyed and Flett created this new version especially for the DâArcy Thompson Zoology Museum. Its spiralling design is based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers, which is often found in nature.\n\nLindsay Sekulowicz undertook an artistâs residency at the DâArcy Thompson Zoology Museum in 2012 co-organised with the Barns-Graham Charitable Trust and the Royal Scottish Academy. She was particularly interested in memory and neuroscience, spending time at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee and the Sea Mammal Research Unit at the University of St Andrews. The body of work she ultimately produced explored the fact that much of DâArcyâs museum collection was lost when the original museum was demolished in the 1950s. By drawing representative specimens and creating sculptural pieces that symbolise others, her intention was to create a memory system that would help to re-create the extent of the original collection in people's minds.\n\nNew works of art are regularly added to the DâArcy Thompson Zoology Museum Art Collection and we continue to encourage artists to explore DâArcyâs ideas and collections for inspiration. This bronze work was recently placed at the entrance to the museum. Visit www.dundee.ac.uk/museum/zoology/ to find out more."
