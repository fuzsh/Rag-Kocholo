        "text": "If you’ve been with Clintonville Academy for very long, you know the name Karen Pollock.\n\nKaren served, not only as our founding director in 1978, but also as both French and Spanish teacher that first year. She worked as director for 10 years, then continued teaching foreign languages until retiring in August 2020 after an impressive 42-year tenure.\n\nThe significance of Karen’s contribution to the character and vitality of Clintonville Academy can’t be overstated. We simply wouldn’t be where we are, without her. For that reason, we want to honor Karen and would love for you to join us in doing so.\n\nWe believe the Karen Pollock Legacy Fund will be an invaluable resource for CA students and families.\n\nWhether helping with facilities improvements, special events, or even financing student scholarships, this fund will honor Karen’s legacy, and help us accomplish her goal of creating global citizens who are equipped to make a difference in the world.\n\nCheck out the video below from the Spring of 2021, where we surprise Karen with news about Legacy Fund being created in her honor. You’ll see why she means so much to us, and why she deserves to be recognized. We love you, Karen!\n\nLike Karen Pollock, Sally Lindsay has long been a mainstay of Clintonville Academy. When Karen stepped down as director, Sally stepped up and served as CA’s director for a monumental 34 years! Her presence and leadership these many years have been crucial. Sally worked tirelessly to create a nurturing environment and tight-knit community where students could thrive and grow to their potential.\n\nIn the spring of 2022, Sally announced her plans to retire – marking the end of her notable tenure and the beginning of a new season for Clintonville Academy. In her honor, we’ve transformed part of the school’s front lawn into a Learning Garden. The garden will embody so much of what we know is near and dear to Sally’s heart – the beauty of nature, combined with students thriving, learning, and growing together – all right here at CA, Sally’s second home these many years.\n\nWe’d be thrilled to receive contributions toward the garden and more, in Sally’s honor. Use the button below to donate the amount of your choosing, or contact us with questions."
