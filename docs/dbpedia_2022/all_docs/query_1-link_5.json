        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nThe Girl With the Gallery Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market By Lindsay Pollock Illustrated. 483 pages. PublicAffairs. $30.\n\nLindsay Pollock's informative biography of the New York art dealer Edith Gregor Halpert reads a bit like a second draft that should have been returned to its author with requests for further research, greater skepticism and deeper insights, not to mention fewer platitudes, repetitions and historical generalizations. Doubts might also have been raised about the cloying yet aggrandizing title, \"The Girl With the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert and the Making of the Modern Art Market.\"\n\nEven so, this book is the first to retrieve from oblivion this dynamic, pioneering art dealer and shrewd, abrasive proprietor of the Downtown Gallery. A bastion of American art -- and especially American Scene painting -- it existed for more than 40 years, first in Greenwich Village, then on East 51st Street and finally at 57th and Park Avenue. Ms. Pollock's account also provides a rare view of the hardscrabble workings of a commercial art gallery many years before Manhattan became thronged with them.\n\nBorn Ginda Fivoosiovitch in Russia in 1900, Mrs. Halpert came to New York with her mother and older sister in 1906, after the death of her father, Gregor. She grew up in Harlem and by her mid-teens was supporting herself working in department stores (where she learned quite a bit about selling) while studying art and visiting galleries.\n\nSmall and beautiful, Mrs. Halpert was serious, tough-talking and fiercely independent; she smoked and drank. At 18 she married Samuel Halpert, a painter of middling talent 16 years her senior. (Later paramours would include Holger Cahill, a specialist in American folk art, and the artist Charles Sheeler.)\n\nThe marriage soon faltered, and Sam died in 1930 of an inner-ear disease whose symptoms Edith had always attributed to hypochondria. But initially marriage to Sam softened the blow of not being an artist herself and provided further art world contacts. He introduced her to Stuart Davis, arguably the greatest artist she represented. Edith opened the gallery on West 13th Street in 1926; she ran it until 1970, when, after several years of increasing disorientation, exacerbated by alcohol, she died of a brain tumor.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
