        "text": "McIver Family\n\nThis website is mainly concerned with the ancestors and descendents of Catherine McIver who emigrated in 1861, aged 9, with her parents George and Isabella, from Loch Ewe, Wester Ross, in Scotland, to Australia.\n\nThe northeastern shore of Loch Ewe in Wester Ross\n\nThe Name McIver\n\nMcIver originates from the Norse given name Ivarr, thus ‘son of Ivarr’. Norse settlement of the far north of Scotland and the Western Isles began in the 9th century.\n\nHowever below is edited correspondence from Ormiscaig, Wester Ross on the name McIver emphasising Gaelic/Celtic rather than Norse heritage:\n\nThe McIvers are, in fact, a sept of the northern branch of Clan Campbell. In the 18th and 19th centuries, here in Ross-shire, the names McIver and Campbell could be interchangeable. The Gaelic speaking Highland Genealogist, based at the Central Library in Inverness, pointed out that Iver was a pet name of Campbells in the area, and came from one Iver, a Campbell who created a cadet branch of that family in the Ross-shire area. After Iver, many Campbells would call themselves McIver, and at other times McIvers would use the Campbell name. Campbell is itself a Gaelic name (‘crook mouth’), and thus the McIvers are more likely to have an ultimately Celtic rather than Norse origin. Records of clearances from the Aultbea/Ormiscaig townships actually refer to two families there as ‘McIver, also known as Campbell.\n\nMcIver is particularly common in Wester Ross and the Isle of Skye. Scottish records consistently spell the name McIver or Maciver, however McIvor appears in some Australian records. Here Mclver is used unless records indicate that the preferred form for the person was Mclvor.\n\nThe Bualnaluib houses approaching from the east. The school is on the right.\n\nNotes on Scottish Places\n\nAultbea, Ormiscaig and Bualnaluib (which seems to be pronounced as Bulnerlube) the crofting villages the McIvers came from, are situated in a remote costal area of north-west Scotland. Until the 1850s there were no roads so people lived within close-knit communities. Meagre livings were extracted on rented property. People spoke Gaelic and engaged in cattle and sheep rearing, kelp-gathering, potato growing and other subsistence crops and perhaps some fishing.\n\nContrast between 19th century croft dwellings and a current residence at Bualnaluib\n\nIn 1846-1848 the area was hit by the failure of the potato crop and many people were brought to the “verge of destitution”. The crofters until 1886 had no security of tenure and could be dispossessed at will by the proprieters. However the Mackenzie family who owned the land seemed relatively supportive of their tenants and these villages where free of widespread forced clearances. This is witnessed by the survival of most of the crofting plots and many houses to this day.\n\nThe maximum population of the Gairloch Parish in which these settlements were located was 5,449 in 1871. In 1961 it was only 1,999 – rising to 2,289 in 2001, as increasing ‘incomers’ have become attracted by the beauty of the area. Most emigration was initially to Nova Scotia in Canada. However this had practically ceased by 1845 and from then “saw the commencement of a small and intermittent stream of emigration to Australia.”\n\nThe crofting villages of Loch Ewe were always quite small. Bualnaliub had 11 houses and 50 people at the 1841 census – 23 of whom were McIvers. Mellon Charles had 216 people in 41 houses – including 17 houses headed by a McLennan. Ormiscaig had 10 houses (4 headed by McGregors) totalling 48 people. 140 years later, in 1981, the population was 10 at Bualnaluib, 24 at Ormiscaig and 110 at Mellon Charles.\n\nSources of general historical information include:\n\nCaird, J.B. The Making of the Gairloch Crofting Landscape [which is a study of mid 19th century land tenure focused on Ormiscaig] – in Peoples and Settlements in North-West Ross, edited by John R. Baldwin, 1994. ISBN 0-9505884-8-4\n\nMackintosh, S. The Parish of Gairloch – in The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, edited by A.S. Mather.\n\nGeorge McIver’s Ancestors and Siblings\n\nGeorge McIver and wife Isabella McIver emigrated to Victoria, Australia in 1861 with their 3 children, Catherine, Christina and George.\n\nGeorge Mclver (c1829-1892) was born in the Aultbea area which is located alongside Loch Ewe seven miles from the village of Poolewe and 13 miles from Gairloch in Ross-shire. He married Isabella McIver (same family name) in 1851. They had three children in Scotland, one at sea, and a further five in Australia.\n\nGeorge McIver took up land at Glengower. In about 1875 the family moved to a farm at Charlton, and later farmed near Kyabram and Mooroopna in the lower Goulburn Valley. He died at Mooroopna North on 21 August 1892 aged 63. His obituary reads;\n\nAnother old pioneer was laid to rest on Tuesday afternoon, in the person of Mr. G. Mclver, a well known and highly respected resident of West Mooroopna. He has long time ago been suffering from influenza and apparently had recovered from the attack. Last week however, he was seized with a severe cold, and he took to his bed Tuesday, the family little thinking that he would never rise therefrom, but on Sunday last it was apparent that his end was near and he passed quietly away at eventide, at the ripe old age of 63 years. During his residence in the district he took a great interest in all events transpiring around him and was in touch with the leading topics of the day. He leaves a wife and grown up family to mourn his loss. The remains were interred in the Mooroopna cemetery, being followed by a large number of sympathising friends…\n\nGeorge McIver parents: John McIver (c1794-1871) and Isabella McLean (c1793-1861)\n\nThe parents of George McIver (c1829-1892) were John Mclver (c1794-1871) and Isabella McLean (c1793-1861). John and Isabella were contracted to be married on 2 February 1822.\n\nThe image below indicates than John was living at Melin Gairloch, almost certainly Mellon Charles in the parish of Gairloch, at the marriage while Isabella (spelt Isobell here) here was at Tenefelon (Tignafiline) a locality adjacent to Bualnaluib. Note that this record is indexed John Mceiver and Isobell Mclean in Scotland’s People database.\n\nThe exact details of the children of John McIver (c1794-1871) and Isabella McLean (c1793-1861) are unknown.\n\nCatharine McIver – Was a member of the household at the 1841 census, aged given as 15. Not necessarily a daughter of John and Isabella\n\nIsabel McIver – At the household at the 1841 census, aged given as 15, same as Catharine. Not necessarily a daughter of John and Isabella. There was a marriage of an Isabella McIvor of Laige with William Sinclair of the same place on 5 December 1848.\n\nJohn McIver – baptised on 27 October 1824. Parents living at ‘Melon of Gair’. Thought to have married Ann Macdonald, with children including: son born or baptised 31 January 1857, Donald McIver 29 September 1859, Isabella McIver 18 February 1862 and possibly another Donald McIver 20 August 1867.\n\nDonald McIver – baptised on 1 February 1826. Parents living at ‘Melon of Gair’. Thought to have emigrated to Australia in 1855.\n\nGeorge McIver – born about 1829 – married 11 November 1851 to Isabella McIver. Emigrated to Australia in 1861.\n\nMary McIver – baptised 25 April 1830. Parents living at Mellon Charles.\n\nKenneth McIver – born about 1834 – Emigrated to Australia in 1863 aged 28 with wife Henrietta MacLean. They were married at Poolewe 4 February 1858, he recorded as fisherman of Bualnaluib aged 24 and she 19 of Bualnaluib, daugher of John McLean, cattle dealer and Ann McLean (nee McLeod).\n\nHannah/Joanna McIver – born c1839 – married aged 25 to Roderick McGregor on 25 February 1864 at the Free Church of Scotland Aultbea after banns. Both signed with an x. His declared age was 40 but was probably closer to 50, a general labourer of Mellon Charles and she aged 26 a domestic servant. His parents where crofter Alexander McGregor and Isabella McGregor (nee Mackenzie). They had the following children (unverified Ancestry tree): James Noble McGregor 1865, Alexander McGregor 1867, Isabella McGregor 1869, John McGregor 1872; Kenneth McGregor 1874 and possibly Peggy 1883. One tree gives Roderick’s death at Ormiscaig 30 January 1895 and she 30 October 1929 at Ormiscaig aged 86.\n\nAs recorded below Isabella died aged 68 at 2am on 5 October 1861 at Bualnaluib from asthma. She was the daughter of George Maclean, crofter and Mary Maclean (maiden name also Maclean). The death was registered at Mellon Charles.\n\nJohn McIver’s death certificate reads: John Maciver crofter, widower of Isabella Maclean. He died 8 am on June 8 1871 at Bualnaluib aged 76; son of Murdo Maciver crofter, deceased and Mary Maciver, maiden name Macdonald, deceased. The informant was Roderick McGregor, his son-in-law and occupier at the same address. Roderick wrote his mark. The death was registered at Mellon Charles.\n\nNote. Given the frequency of similar names in the area I have been reluctant to confirm that the above death certificate is for the John McIver ‘in our line’. However the location of Bualnaluib, wife Isabella Maclean and informant Roderick McGregor provides very significant correlation with other sources. Thus John’s mother must be seen to be Mary Macdonald (or McDonald) and the father Murdo as per this certificate, even though it is strange given the Scottish naming system that none of John’s children were known to be named Murdo.\n\nGeorge’s Grandparents: Murdo McIver and Mary Macdonald.\n\nThe following marriage has been used in some family trees: Married 14 May 1790; Murdoch MacIver, Butcher (correct not bachelor) in Dingwall to Margaret McDonald, daughter to John McDonald, Bridgend, with the assumption that Margaret went by the name Mary. I believe this is an erroneous record, especially as it seems unlikely that a butcher of Dingwall would later in life become a crofter of Gairloch Parish some distance away. There only hint I can see of any connection between the names Mary and Margaret is the baptismal record of a Jannet McIver to Murdo McIver and Margaret McDonald in 1811 in Gairloch parish. It seems likely that while church marriage records are online for Dingwall 1790 they do not seem to be for the Gairloch Parish. My hunch is that the ancestry of ‘our’ McIvers a very much situated in the Gairloch area but there are no records available either prove or disprove this.\n\nNotes on Scottish Census Information Below\n\nThe ages given at censuses tend to be rounded and often inaccurate. Where reference is given to an event at Aultbea it may mean Bualnaluib or Ormiscaig – as registration was at the local church which was, and is, in Aultbea. In 1845-46 the crofts throughout the parish were reformed from run-rig to fixed holdings. Related to this the croft house numbers change between censuses. A different number does not necessarily mean that people moved. However in general people did move from croft dwellings clustered together to being more spread out – being relocated so that their dwelling sits on the household’s fixed holdings.\n\nAt the Scottish census of 1841 the family is listed as living at No.2 croft Bualnaluib, as follows:\n\nJohn McIver, aged 40, tenant, born in Ross & Cromarty (as were all other members of the family)\n\nIsabel, aged 40\n\nCatharine, aged 15\n\nIsabel, aged 15\n\nJohn, aged 14.\n\nDonald, aged 12.\n\nGeorge, aged 10\n\nMary, aged 8, christened 25 April 1830.\n\nKenneth, aged 7\n\nN.K, 6 months, possibly 6 weeks. (un-christened baby)\n\nAt the census of 1841 listed as living at No.9 croft Bualnaluib, were:\n\nMurdo McIver, aged 60, tenant, born in Gairloch parish\n\nMary McIver, aged 60, born, born in Gairloch parish\n\nMyles McIver, aged 24, born in Gairloch parish\n\nAt the 1851 census the eldest six of eight children were no longer resident at the Bualnaluib croft.\n\nJohn McIver, aged 53, crofter of 4 acres.\n\nIsabella, wife, aged 50\n\nKenneth, son, aged 14, farm labourer\n\nHannah, aged 8, scholar\n\nIn 1861 their address was given as No.1 Crofter’s House, Bualnaluib School.\n\nJohn McIver, aged 69, born Gairloch parish, crofter of 4 1/2 acres\n\nIsabella, wife, aged 68, born Gairloch parish\n\nJohn McIver, crofter son, aged 35, born Gairloch parish\n\nAnn McIver, daughter, aged 30 [but thought to be John’s wife Ann McDonald]\n\nJohanna McIver, crofter daughter, aged 19. Almost certainly Hannah as described in the 1851 census\n\nMurdo McIver, grandson, aged 4. Probably son of John and Ann.\n\nDonald McIver, grandson, aged 1. Probably same as son born to John and Ann 29 September 1859.\n\nCatherine McDonald, grand-daughter, aged 2. Possibly born 19 October 1858\n\nGeorge Sinclair, grandson, aged 5. Probably the son of William Sinclair & Isabell McIver, born 19 January 1856.\n\nIsabella Mclver, aged 32, transcribed as visitor and thought to be the daughter of John and Isabella McIver and wife of William Sinclair.\n\nThe 1871 Census details are:\n\nRoderick McGregor, aged 50, crofter, born Slaggan, Ross-shire [which was about 10 miles north of Bualnaluib, on the coast]\n\nJohanna McGregor, aged 30, crofter’s wife, born Bualnaluib\n\nJames McGregor, aged 6, crofter’s son, scholar, born Bualnaluib\n\nAlexander McGregor, aged 3 1/2, crofters son, born Bualnaluib\n\nIsabella McGregor, aged 1, crofter’s daughter, born Bualnaluib\n\nJohn McIver, aged 80, crofter’s wife’s father, born Bualnaluib\n\nCatherine McDonald, aged 12, cousin, born Bualnaluib\n\nJohn McIver living with daughter’s family at Bualnaliub in 1871\n\nGrandparents of George McIver (c1829-1892)\n\n(1) Murdo McIver and Mary McDonald\n\nIt looks as though Murdo McIver was born in Ormisgaig in 1762 (needs verification – given the dates of children’s births it could b expected to be later). At the 1841 Census for Bualnaluib, John’s parents Murdo and Mary, age for both given as 60, lived at croft no.9 with son Myles, aged 24 and grand-daughter Catherine aged 8. Murdo Mclver was alive at the 1851 census living at Bualnaluib. His age then was listed as 88, retired crofter, pauper, born in Ormiscaig. He lived with his grand-daughter Catherine aged 18. It is probable that his wife Mary died in the 1840s.\n\nChildren of Murdo & Mary :\n\nDonald McIver christened 14 April 1808,\n\nJannet McIver baptised 9 July 1811. Parents transcribed as Murdow McIver and Margaret McDonald. She married a Roderick McGregor.\n\nand Miles McIver (also spelt Myles) baptised 21 September 1813. Record states: parents Murd McIver and Mary McDonald, tenants, Melon of Gairloch. At the 1841 Myles was the only person living with his parents at the Bualnaluib croft. In 1851 he had his own croft of 4 acres at Bualnaluib. Listed as aged 35 and born at Poolewe. His wife Jean Sinclair was listed as at the same age. Her birthplace looks like ‘Caithnife’. Children, all born at Poolewe, were Alexander McIver aged 6, William McIver aged 4, Mary Mciver aged 2 and Margaret McIver, three months.\n\nJohn’s brother Donald is listed in the 1841 Census as a boat carpenter living nearby on the Isle of Ewe (which was cleared of crofters in the mid-1800s). He wife was Ann Mackenzie, 35 – and their children were listed as Alexander 5, Donald 3; Margaret, 6 months.\n\nBy 1851 they had moved the few hundred metres to the mainland at Aultbea. The 1851 Census listing is:\n\nDonald, head, aged 42, crofter of 4 acres, born in Slaggan\n\nAnn, wife, aged 42, born in Culconich\n\nAlexander, son, aged 13, born in Inverewe\n\nMargaret, daughter, aged 10, born in Island Ewe\n\nCatherine, daughter, aged 7, born in Aultbea\n\nAnn, daughter, aged 4, born in Aultbea\n\nDonald McIver and family emigrated to Australia in the “Fortune” in December 1855. The settled in the Brisbane area.\n\nIn 2004 I received an email from Ormiscaig from the sister of the man who now owns the croft at No.1 Bualnaluib that descendants of a Donald McIver who lived at 5 Bualnaluib still live in that cottage [perhaps not our line].\n\n(2) George McLean and Mary McLean\n\nIsabella McIver’s Ancestors and Siblings\n\nCroft houses like this one, at nearby Sand, would originally have had thatched roofs\n\nIsabella Mclver has born in the Aultbea area and baptised 1 December 1827. She married George McIver on 11 November 1851 at Aultbea or Poolewe. At the census of 1861 Isabella was visiting her parents-in-law’s house at Bualnaluib. Between 1852 and 1871 she had 9 children. Isabella died 6 July 1899 at Undera near Mooroopna in the Goulburn Valley of northern Victoria, aged 72 years. Her obituary reads in part:\n\nLast Thursday the above lady, who had reached a good age was laid to rest at her residence, Gillieston. She had been a resident of this district for a number of years, and had made a large circle of friends by reason of her kind and cheerful disposition. Her end has not unexpected, as she had been ailing for a considerable time. Her remains were interred in the Mooroopna cemetery…. She leaves a grown up family…amongst whom is Mr. D. Mclver, commissioner of the Rodney Trust”.\n\nThe monument on the grave of George and Isabella is quite impressive\n\nParents of Isabella McIver (c1827-1899)\n\nIsabella’s parents were John Mclver (born about 1803) and Annie McKenzie (born about 1807). They are perhaps the same as John McIver from Mellon Udrigle and Ann McKenzie of Tignafiline who married 1 February 1837. In 1841 they were at Mellon Udrigle (a few miles to the north on Gruinard Bay) – as per the 1841 Census:\n\nJohn MacIver, aged 40, tenant\n\nAnn, aged 35\n\nIsabel, aged 14, christened 1 December 1827.\n\nJohn, aged 12, christened 8 June 1829.\n\nAnnabel, aged 9; born on 2 February 1833.\n\nCatherine, aged 6\n\nRoderick, aged 3; christened 15 May 1837.\n\nMurdo, aged 1\n\nGrandparents of Isabella McIver (c1827-1899). To be completed.\n\nOrmiscaig looking east towards the mountains\n\nThe McIvers Arrive in Australia\n\nThe Mclver family left Southampton on 1st September 1861 on the Oithona. They arrived in Melbourne on 7th December 1861. The Oithona coming from London via Southampton carried 299 passengers, including 26 married couples, 206 single women and 39 children. The Melbourne Age reported that passengers were in excellent health with only 2 deaths on board, both of infants. They were assisted passengers. The ships list gives the following details:\n\nGeorge Mclver, agricultural labourer, aged 29.\n\nIsabella Mclver, aged 31\n\nCatherine, aged 9\n\nChristina, aged 5\n\nGeorge, aged 2\n\nThey were Presbyterians, George and Isabella could read and write, and they were not engaged by a particular colonist. The ships list indicates they came from Inverness, although we know that they originated from Ross-shire. On the shipping records George’s occupation was listed as ploughman.\n\nIsabella was mony months pregant when the ship sailed, as a 4th child, Johannah was born at sea.\n\nGeorge’s uncle, Donald McIver had earlier emigrated to Australia in 1855. Also George’s brother Kenneth McIver and his family emigrated in 1863. Kenneth arrived on the SS Theresa to Melbourne March 1863 aged 28. He was accompanied by his wife Henrietta, aged 24, daughter of John MacLean and Ann MacLeod MacLean and their son George McIver, aged three. There was also another Kenneth McIver aged 28 from Ross-shire on that boat, wife Ann, aged 24, Duncan aged 8, and Kenneth aged 3. In addition there were McKenzies from Ross-shire.\n\nThe Children of George and Isabella McIver\n\nAfter arriving in Australia the family grew from three to nine children. Their place of births indicate that the family was somewhat nomadic for many years. They finally settled in the Mooroopna area in the Lower Goulburn Valley. The children of George and Isabella are as follows:\n\n1. Catherine Smeaton (nee McIver) (1852-1925)\n\nCatherine Smeaton (nee McIver) when aged about 60 at Eugowra (ca 1912) Picture with family\n\nCatherine McIver was born, probably in the Aultbea area (her death certificate gives place of birth almost certainly incorrectly as Glasgow), in 1852. She arrived in Victoria with her parents in 1861, aged 9. She gave birth to William James McIver (1878-1940) at Mooroopna on 11 July 1878 – no father given. William Mclver stayed in Victoria. He was left £20 in his grandmother’s will (she died 1899). He moved to New Zealand in 1911 at Temuka where he married Mary Proudlock (1886-1945) on 11 July 1916 in St. Peter’s Anglican Church. Mary’s parents were John Grant Proudlock and Ellen (nee Taylor, who was born in Northumberland UK in 1865. He was a farm labourer. They had four children: Margaret Jean McIver (1917); Alexandra Isabella McIver (1919-1981); Roderick George McIver (1921-1981); and Alice Catherine Ross McIver (1926-1995).\n\nWilliam McIver died at Temuka 2 March 1940, and Mary five years later.\n\nCatherine married Peter Smeaton at the Presbyterian manse Mooroopna on 19 January 1885 [m/c 885] . At the time of the wedding Peter Smeaton was a farmer of North Mooroopna. They had four children at Mooroopna before moving to Eugowra in NSW in the early 1890s. A fifth child was born while at Eugowra. Catherine Mclver died 26th July 1925 [d/c 14963] and is buried in the Parkes cemetery. For more details see the Smeaton file\n\n2. Christina Wilson (nee McIver) (1857-1907)\n\nRegistered as Christy, she was born 30 January 1857 at Ormiscaig, parish of Gairloch. She married Thomas Wilson (1848-1927) at Mooroopna in 1878. They moved to Balldale, NSW in early 1904, to “Cluster Hills” on the subdivided Quatt Quatta Station. This farm was still in 1990 owned by the Wilson family. Christy and Thomas reared ten children\n\n2.1 Thomas Wilson (Jr) (1875-1953)\n\nBorn at Mooropna 20 December 1875 he married Elizabeth Mary Stratton at Wyuna 5 October 1909. They farmed ‘Glenalbyns’ at Balldale. Their children were George Thomas Wilson (b. Corowa 4 July 1910-1962), and Wilbur Henry Wilson (b. Corowa 17 July 1912-1995). Wilbur farmed ‘Bellevue at Balldale. Elizabeth died 6 October 1945 and Thomas at Corowa 31 October 1953. They are buried at Goombargana.\n\n2.2 Rebecca Hewett (nee Wilson) (1879-1963)\n\nAlso known as “Ray”. Born at Mooropna 22 May 1879 she married Jim Hewitt in 1909. Their children are: Thomas Wilson Hewett (1910, Corowa), James George William Hewett (b.1912, Corowa), Isabel Joan Hewett (b.1914, Corowa) and Rebecca Margaret (b. Corowa, 1917). She died in West Wyalong 26 October 1963. Husband James Hewett died in Wagga, 1927.\n\n2.3 Isabella Annie Pollock (nee Wilson) (1880-1942)\n\nBorn 9 August 1880 at Mooroopna, she married Robert Pollock in 1905, raised six children and died 22 September 1942.

He was a prominent community member – being on the Hume Shire Council for many many years. The first Presbyterian Church services were held at “Cluster Hills” in 1905 before a local church was built.\n\nIn our family history the Wilsons and the Pollocks/Kilpatricks/McIvers/Smeatons are closely linked\n\nChristina McIver married Thomas Wilson.\n\nTheir daughter Isabella Annie Wilson married Robert Pollock.

George McIver (1859-1945)\n\nGeorge McIver was a stockman, grazier and writer. He wrote that he was born “close to Altbea”, at Ormiscaig on 3 June 1859,\n\nHe produced three published books: Neuroomia:a new continent: a manuscript delivered from the deep (1894); A Drover’s Odyssey (1935); and The Bunyip and other verses (1945). He also wrote articles for the Sydney Morning Herald and The Land and various rural newspapers. Some of these articles can be viewed via Trove and in the Bunyip book\n\nIn The Bunyip and other verses it is stated that he went to school at Campbelltown [Victoria], and ‘herded sheep at [nearby] Joyce’s Creek'[which is about 5 kilometers west pf Newstead]. The preface to A Drover’s Odyssey reports that from the age of sixteen he spent eight years as a drover and stockmen. This indicates that the book was set in the late 1870s or early 1880s. It chronicles a drive of 25,000 sheep from Bourke to the Northern Territory. He also drove around the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers of NSW and in Western Victoria.\n\nAfter he finished droving he became a school teacher. A newspaper article states that he was teaching at Corindi, Woolgoolga and Macksville, and “thence to the Clarence”. The record of his teaching appointments is as follows: Mt. Arthur 15 Apr 1884; Corinda & Woolgoolga 3 July 1885; Whiteman’s Creek 16 Feb 1888; North Forster 24 Feb 1891; Simpson’s Ridge (just west of Bowraville, near Mackville) 30 June 1891; Macksville 11 April 1894; Gulgamree 18 Oct 1894; Hobbys Yards 8 Aug 1895. He retired from Hobbys Yards in 1910.\n\nHe married Emma Eugene Reid in Redfern on 6 April 1891. Her parents were Charles and Margaret. Emma died on 4 December 1894 at her residence, Gulgamree Public School, near Mudgee, aged 24, leaving three children. Her headstone. They had only moved there a couple of months before. She is buried in Cudgegong General Cemetery. Note that her headstone reads 23 years. The children included: Sydney, born at Springwood in 1891; George (Jr), both in the Nambucca district (probably at Mackville) in 1893; and Isabel. Her birth record indicates she also was born in the Nambucca district in 1893, however her father’s death certificate indicates she was two years younger than George Jr.\n\nNeuroomia was written when he was in Macksville. It is stated that he made some money from this book and his other writings, and went on a world tour in 1911 or 1912, which included Canada. He wrote under the name of “Eucalyptus” for the Clarence and Richmond Examiner.\n\nBefore 1903 he had settled at a grazing property named Kempfield, which is near the village of Trunkey Creek (as well as Hobbys Yards), close to Blayney and Carcoar. Here is a video of the property. Here is a map indicating his farm holdings in 1940 from Trove. He seemed to have lived at (or at least owned) Kempfield until about 1940.\n\nIn 1912 he sought to stand for the Liberal Party in the NSW elections as the candidate for Raleigh on the north coast. He did not win preselection.\n\nHe ventured overseas again, as there is an article in The Argus 6 May 1916 of his eyewitness account of an attack on a French passenger ship, named The Sussex in the English Channel. This is also rendered in verse in The Bunyip and other verses. The Sussex sinking did not receive extensive coverage at the time, but due to the number of Americans who died on board it influenced the US government attitude to Germany. George McIver’s writings indicate that he also had visited Ceylon, Hawaii and New Zealand.\n\nIn this article he states that “after the war [I] acquired the old Dykehead cattle station on the Auburn River not far from its confluence with the Burnett in south eastern Queensland”. His younger brother Donald McIver also had purchased property in the area in 1903. In his writings he frequently refers to the Auburn and Burnett Rivers and the Aboriginal people there. It may be that George bought Don’s property following the latter’s death in 1916. George must have have lived there at some time as George McIver grazier and Isabel McIver (his daughter) are listed at his deceased brother Donald’s “Glenwood” property on the Auburn in the 1924 electoral rolls, and George alone in 1913. In July 1937 George and Isabel travelled from London to Sydney on the P&O ship Strathaird.\n\nIn 1943 he was living at “Wodonga” Coomonderry Street, Katoomba, with Isabel.\n\nGeorge McIver died at 157 Pennant Street, Parramatta, aged 86 on 1 September 1945, and was cremated at Rookwood. In December 1946 his son Sydney auctioned off 50 acres belonging to his father just north of the wireless station at Wonga Road and Wonga Streets Lurnea and 14 acres at Frenchs Forest Road and Old Pittwater Roads, Brookvale.\n\nSydney McIver (1891-1967).\n\nHe married Elvira Brown in Sydney in 1926. He was an engineer who lived at Ewos Parade, Cronulla from at least 1945 to his death on 19 July 1967.\n\nGeorge McIver (1893-1968).\n\nHe was born at Macksville 28 September 1893. He enlisted early for the war, leaving with the First Expeditionary force on The Euripedes 18 October 1914. He served in 3rd Battalion AIFa. From the The Sydney Morning Herald of 11 August 1915: “Private George McIver who was recently wounded at Gallipoli is the second son of George McIver of Hempfield(sic) Station, near Carcoar, and Sydney. He has born of the Nambucca River, North Coast, 22 years ago”. He was returned to Australia and served here as sapper. In 1919 he is listed at 17 Ormond Steet Paddington. He married Maud Conway at Newcastle in 1924. They lived at 6 Dudley Street Bondi in 1931. George McIver Junior owned the Adelaide Hotel at Moruya. He died at Moruya 9 September 1968. I don’t believe they had children.\n\nIsabel McIver (1893?-1984).\n\nShe received £20 in her grandmother’s will in 1899. She seemed to have lived with and cared for her father all her life until he died in 1945. She married Frederick George Read, an engineer, late in her life, in 1952 in Sydney. She died 27 July 1984 aged 91 years and was cremated at the Northern Suburbs crematorium. Her death notice includes “beloved mipps of Joan and Lindsay McPherson. Sue and Lindy and their families”. She thus may have been a midwife. Fred Read died 12 October 1975 when living at Parramatta. He had a deceased daughter, Janet.\n\n4. Johannah (Joan) McKenzie (nee McIver) (1861-1935)\n\nJohannah was born at sea on the voyage from Britain. She married John McKenzie (also written as Mackenzie). She was bequeathed £100 In 1916 she lived at Kilsyth on the eastern edge of Melbourne. She was known as Joan. They had one child, Hector. She died on 23 Nov 1935 when living at Liverpool Rd, Kilsyth and is buried at Lilydale cemetery.\n\n5. John McIver (1863-1938)\n\nBorn at Sandhurst (later known as Bendigo) (Reg. 17064), he married Alice May Gibson 4 November 1897 at Byaduk (Reg. 6921). He became a policeman in the mounted force and was promoted to sergeant. The 1899 electoral roll lists his as being a Constable living at Moonambel, near Avoca. He received £50 in his mother’s will. His mother’s probate certificate of 1901 and 1903 and 1909 electoral rolls indicate that he was a constable at Dunkeld, and in 1914 the same at Mortlake. In 1916 he lived in Bendigo. In 1924 they were at 22 Camberwell Rd, Hawthorn and by 1931 at 19 Athelstan Rd, Camberwell. John was a senior constable by 1919 and sergeant by 1924.\n\nThey had one child, William Eric McIver – born at Moonambel in 1900. He became a Church of England Minister in Victoria, living variously at Warrnambool, Murchison, Harrow and Athelstan Road and Sandringham before moving in the 1960s to Redcliffe, Queensland. His wife was Jean Harrington Wade.\n\nJohn McIver died in 1938 (Re.6035)and Alice McIver died 22 February 1944 (Reg. 1607). Alice’s parents were Jonathan Gibson and May Barklay. Eric and Jean had an only child Marie Clare McIver.

They had seven children ( Keith 1955, Julie 1956, Susanne1960, Ian 1962, Catherine 1964, Robert 1966 and Michelle 1969).\n\n6. William McIver (1865)\n\nBorn 1865 at Leichhardt near Bendigo [b/c3352]. He died in infancy.\n\n7. Roderick McIver (1866-1940)\n\nBorn 1866 at Glengower near Clunes [b/c 10174]. His death certificate gives Middle Creek (which runs through Glengower) as the place of birth. He married Jane Sommerville Reddan at the age of 27, at Brunswick in Melbourne.\n\nIn 1899 Roderick is listed as living at 102 Brunswick Rd.,Brunswick and being a “Clerk of Court”. In 1903 he was in Stewart Street, Bendigo. By 1914 he was promoted to “Clerk of the Courts” and was living at 58 Moreland Rd., Coburg. In 1916 he is listed as living in Bairnsdale. In 1919 he was at Radnor Street, Camberwell, in 1924 at 27 Broadway Camberwell, and by 1931 at 55 Broadway. He became a police magistrate in Melbourne in 1926.\n\nHis death notice from The Argus 28 February 1940 reads:\n\nLieut. Colonel R. McIver, who died last Saturday, was for many years commanding officer of the Australian Army Service Corps, and occupied several important positions in the Crown Law Department. He was aged 73.\n\nBorn at Middle Creek, near Campbelltown, Lieut. Colonel Mciver began his career in the Education Department, and taught for some time at the Brunswick Central State school.

Adrian married Laura Frances Blake in 1938. In 1954 he was manager of the State Savings Bank in Myrtleford. Alfreda was a school teacher and married Walter Thomas Pollard. Walter died in 1941 “late of Solomons Islands and Sydney, at “Clan Iver”, 55 Broadway, Camberwell”\n\n8. Donald McIver (1869-1916)\n\nBorn 14 September 1869 at Glengower, near Castlemaine [although birth certificate reads born at nearby Newstead – b/c 24113].
