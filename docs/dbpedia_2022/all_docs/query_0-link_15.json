        "text": "Now the funny thing is that I was told that my paternal grandfather, James Shields (a bad lot) was very clever at working in glass. But all the documentary evidence I have of his working career is as a “machinist” in engine works or foundry. As it turns out though, many of my male ancestors were “glassmen”. The main glass working lines were the White family of Newcastle upon Tyne, on my father’s side, and the Pollock family on my mother’s.\n\nThe Whites worked entirely in the Newcastle glass industry, but the Pollocks crisscrossed the country, and, once they arrived in North East England, moved to different locations within the area.\n\nThe glass industry of the 1700s needed silica and coal, and my family members pop up in several of the main glass-making locations of the time. Sand was available at ports, where ballast was dropped off. This was especially important in the shipping that came into the Tyne, where ships mostly left with bulky coal and returned with high-value low volume cargoes. The deposited ballast from incoming ships created ballast hills at several points along the Tyne, on which housing was built. My Pollock ancestors lived on the huge ones at South Shields, Other ancestors from the region lived on the ballaast hills in both North Shore, Newcastle, and in Gateshead.\n\nThe map shows how close the glassworking centres of Newcastle, South Shields, and Monkwearmouth were. The glassworkers of these areas were linked by many ties of blood, friendship, marriage, and politics. On several occasions they grouped together to parade through town, sometimes apparently to make fun of cordwainers, sometimes to claim political rights, and sometimes to parade the excellence of their wares. My ancestors Benjamin White Jnr and Andrew Pollock could both have taken part in this 1823 parade.\n\nThere are many connections between glass workers and mariners. In both the Pollock and the White families, boys tend to become either glassmen or mariners, and marriages tend to be between families dominated by those trades. In South Shields, especially, they lived in the same area of town. Needless to say, not the best part of town.\n\nBenjamin White (1744-1788) is the first ancestor that I am certain was a glassman, followed by many of his sons, including my ancestor, another Benjamin (1767-1842). Unmarried women often worked as glass polishers in this family. Benjamin was born, worked, and died, in the parish of St Nicholas in Newcastle upon Tyne. The Whites lived in the area on the banks of the Tyne to the west of Newcastle upon Tyne — their addresses were places like “Postern” and “Forth Banks”. The Forth Banks area was where the Dagnia family established their glass works in 1684, just outside Close Gate, the south western entrance through the city walls. They specialised in lead glass. The Whites lived, of course, a short walk from their work place, and would never be free of the smoke and dust of his dangerous industry.\n\nTurner’s view of Newcastle upon Tyne shows the sandy ballast hills in the foreground. Beyond the bridge, almost dead centre in the picture, is the distinctive tower of the lead shot factory — lead and glass were linked industries. The plumes of smoke rising from the riverbank below the tower and streaming over the castle are roughly where the glasshouses were that the Whites worked in.\n\nAndrew Pollock was a glassman — sometimes specifically described as a bottlemaker — born in Dumbarton, who married in Leith in 1796. He and his brother, James, may have learnt their trade at the Dumbarton Glassworks, which had been founded in 1777. Andrew married Margaret Shotton, a woman whose father, Ralph, had been a mariner from Shields, though she was born in Leith, probably in a bigamous marriage by her father.\n\nAndrew and his brother James went with their wives to work in the Lancashire glass industry. In 1797, Andrew and Margaret’s first child was born in Walton on the Hill, Lancashire, still a glassworking centre, and James and his wife buried their first child in Lancashire in 1804. The two brothers both settled in South Shields after 1804, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Andrew and Margaret’s daughter, Hannah, first married a mariner, but her second and third husbands were glassmen like her father, and they worked at various times in Monkwearmouth, South Shields, and Stockton. I am not descended from any of her husbands, however, but from one of the five children she had between husbands 1 and 2.\n\nThe more I look into my ancestry, the more glass making I find. And multiple links between individuals pop up that must relate to patterns of friendship. For example, Hannah Pollock married her third husband, glassman Andrew Rowney, in Stockton in 1862, but twenty years earlier he had been her neighbour in South Shields. And in 1863, Andrew Rowney’s daughter married the brother of one of Hannah’s daughters-in-law. We are looking at a tightly knit community."
