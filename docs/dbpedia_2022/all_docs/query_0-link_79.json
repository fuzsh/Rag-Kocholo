        "text": "2022\n\n3 Reasons Local Climate Activism Is More Powerful Than People Realize\n\n“Group action targeted at local decision-makers is a time-honored tradition – and I believe necessary in the current political environment for action on climate change,” writes Adam Aron of Psychology in The Conversation. The piece, which draws on research Aron did for his new book, “The Climate Crisis,” was picked up by Salon and other outlets.\n\nVoxDev’s Most-Read Article\n\nPrashant Bharadwaj of Economics is co-author, along with a Stanford colleague, of VoxDev’s most-read article, “Drawing the Line: The Short- and Long-term Consequences of Partitioning India.”\n\nHealth Care Off the Books\n\nIf people living in the United States don’t have access to health care, what do they do when they get sick? That’s one of the fundamental questions that Danielle Raudenbush of Sociology has been working to answer, first by conducting fieldwork with low-income African Americans in a public housing development and now with Mexican immigrants in San Diego. “I think until we really understand the roots of health inequality, until we really understand how people are getting care, or are not getting care, or the informal strategies they’re using, we won’t be able to effectively address these problems.”\n\n9 Ways to Be a Better Conversationalist\n\nPeople consistently underestimate how much other people like them, a phenomenon social psychologists have dubbed “the liking gap.” Research also shows that we underestimate how much others think of us after a conversation. “Many people spend a lot of time evaluating themselves or thinking about what other people will think of them. In general, this interferes with connecting with others,” says Gail Heyman of Psychology in Popular Science.\n\nTackling Sexual Harassment Could Bring Sizeable Economic Dividends\n\n“Five years after the MeToo movement gripped the world, the problem of sexual harassment continues to dog the economics profession,” reports the Economist. The story cites research by UC San Diego economist Gordon Dahl and Matthew Knepper of the University of Georgia showing that workers’ fears of being unemployed may help drive underreporting. Dahl and Knepper’s study also shows the way to possible solutions: They find that before unemployment benefits were cut in North Carolina in 2013, workers were more likely to report harassment.\n\nA World Gone Mad: Schizophrenia and a Journey Through California’s Failed Mental Health System\n\n“The great failure of public policy over the last 50 years is how we discharged people from mental hospitals with no replacement,” Andrew Scull of Sociology told the Los Angeles Times. The in-depth feature quotes not only Scull, who has for decades been studying the history of mental illness and its treatment, but also UC San Diego sociologist Neil Gong, whose in-progress book examines inequality in mental health care.\n\nOnly One Safe Parking Lot for Homeless People in San Diego Accepts RVs\n\nA story in the Los Angeles Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune reports that in 2022, the San Diego City Council agreed to fund 24-hour service at a safe parking lot in Mission Valley after the release of a study by the Homelessness Hub/Department of Urban Studies and Planning. Among the findings in the two-year study was that RV owners strongly wanted a parking lot where they could stay around the clock.\n\nA Legacy of Support for UC San Diego Students\n\nRetired lecturer Peter Galderisi, and his wife, Holly Gottschalk Galderisi, have designated support to internships for undergraduate students in the Krinsk-Houston Law and Politics Initiative within the Department of Political Science, as well as to scholarships for women scholar-athletes.\n\nPartisan Gap on Trust in U.S. Elections Has Grown Even Wider, Survey Finds\n\nWhile Democrats and independents reported greater confidence in election accuracy and integrity after the 2022 midterms, Republican confidence did not increase – widening the partisan gap. This is one of the key findings of a national survey from the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research at UC San Diego, led by political scientist Thad Kousser. A more hopeful finding, with important implications for solutions: Real-world public information efforts to assure voters of election safeguards create an uptick in confidence across the political spectrum. The research was featured in The San Diego Union-Tribune and on KPBS Midday Edition.\n\nVoting Boost\n\nElection research pioneered by political scientist Zoltan Hajnal, co-director of the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research, is not only having a real-world impact in California but is starting to take root beyond the state. In the 2022 midterms, voters approved measures requiring that municipal elections be held on the same day as state or national races – a move that is expected to significantly boost turnout and broaden the electorate. The story was also distributed by the University of California.\n\nCurse Words Around the World Have Something in Common (We Swear)\n\nBen Bergen of Cognitive Science comments on a study about curse words worldwide in a New York Times piece. “What this paper finds for the first time is that taboo words across languages, unrelated to each other, may pattern similarly,” Bergen says.\n\nHow Big a Comeback Did Ticket Splitting Make This Year?\n\nGary Jacobson of Political Science provided his expert opinion in a Governing piece that discusses an increase in ticket splitting in this year’s elections. Separately, research by Jacobson was referenced in a Bloomberg analysis of the midterms that ran in the Washington Post and, looking ahead to 2024, Jacobson spoke with New York Times columnist Tom Edsall about fractures in the Republican party and the possible effects of former President Donald Trump’s bid for the presidency.\n\nSigning Science Series: Carol Padden\n\nDean of the School of Social Sciences, a doctoral alumna of Linguistics, and professor in Communication Carol Padden is featured in an hour-long video part of the Signing Science series from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The interview is conducted by Ben Bergen of Cognitive Science, who also serves as one of the school’s associate deans. The entire series can be viewed online at Rochester Institute of Technology.\n\nEconometer: Should Businesses Pause Advertising on Twitter?\n\nTwitter has had a rough time under Elon Musk’s new ownership, and some large companies have stopped advertising on the platform, citing a rise in hate speech and misinformation. James Hamilton of Economics comments on the matter as a member of the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Econometer panel, stating “I’m deeply troubled by the fragmentation of America into isolated groups who won’t talk with or listen to each other. … The suggested boycott of Twitter is not about hate speech. It’s a coordinated effort by those in power to bring Elon Musk down.” The piece also appeared in the Kansas City Star. Another Econometer article asked whether U.S. viewership of the World Cup might exceed the Super Bowl in 2026 and Hamilton says he doesn’t think so.\n\nA Deep Look into Mental Health\n\nBonnie Kaiser of Anthropology and Global Health was a featured guest speaker in this virtual panel examining multiple aspects of mental health. If you missed the live event, a UCTV YouTube video is now available.\n\nArchaeologists Devise a Better Clock for Biblical Times\n\nThe New York Times reports that new research harnesses information from 20 international scholars to map out a geomagnetic data set of 21 layers of historical destruction across 17 sites in the Holy Land in an attempt to check the historical authenticity of Old Testament accounts of conflicts. With this new data set, we can narrow things down to a decadal level,” said Tom Levy of Anthropology, who was not involved with the study. “That is super important when trying to connect ancient historical events to the archaeological record.”\n\nAs More GOP Governors Race to Ban TikTok on State Devices, a Federal Ban Looms\n\nThad Kousser of Political Science provided his expertise to NPR as the U.S. Senate considered banning TikTok on federal devices: “A central tenet of what unites Republicans now,” Kousser said, “ is taking a strong stance [and] standing up to China.”\n\nOpinion: Those Who Say Ukraine Should Negotiate with Russia Don’t Understand How Putin Sees the War\n\n“Every day, commentators assert that it is time for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, to give diplomacy a chance,” writes war-termination expert Branislav Slantchev of Political Science in the San Diego Union-Tribune. “But these calls for concessions are premised on misunderstanding how the war might look to Putin and those around him. The domestic, international and military actions of the Kremlin indicate that Putin believes Russia can win this war, and that he is hunkering down for a protracted conflict.”\n\nCalifornia Team Awarded Federal Grant to Uncover Pandemic Impact on PreK-12 Students\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Institute for Education Sciences has awarded a $3 million grant to a research team led by the Public Policy Institute of California, UC Berkeley School of Education, UC San Diego and California Department of Education to conduct a three-year study of pandemic recovery and equitable outcomes across 1,000 PreK-12 districts in the state. Co-PI Julian Betts of Economics and the San Diego Education Research Alliance (SanDERA) said: “Our contribution at UC San Diego will be to test which types of student support programs are making the biggest difference in helping students get back on track.”\n\nTwo Gifts Help Establish San Diego’s First Large-Scale, University-Based Resource on Homelessness\n\nUC San Diego has launched the region’s first large-scale, university-based research and data hub focused exclusively on homelessness, thanks to campus friends Phyllis and Dan Epstein and Hanna and Mark Gleiberman. Each couple has donated $1 million to the university to establish the Homelessness Hub, which will serve as a non-partisan hub for research, education, policy and action on homelessness in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “It’s not research for research’s sake,” said USP’s Mirle Rabinowitz-Bussell in the San Diego Union-Tribune. “Our questions aren’t driven by the research team, but conversations with different community partners who say, ‘We’ve got a program. How is it working? How can it work better?” The launch of the Homelessness Hub was also covered by KPBS, La Jolla Light, Del Mar Times and more. Rabinowitz-Bussell is co-director of the endeavor with Leslie Lewis, also of USP. The Homelessness Hub received early seed-funding support from the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research at UC San Diego.\n\nPolitical Scientist LaGina Gause Probes the Power of Protest\n\nA new book by LaGina Gause of Political Science makes a novel argument: Protests by marginalized groups are more likely to spur change, despite the obstacles and backlash they often face when voicing grievances. Gause sat down to discuss her research with San Diego Union-Tribune columnist Lisa Deaderick at a public event in North Park, put together by the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research, with the Black Studies Project and others. You can read more in this ThisWeek story (also linked above), as well as in this Union-Tribune story, when Deaderick and Gause later revisited their conversation.\n\nSmall Acts of Gratitude Go a Long Way\n\nAny season is a good season to be grateful, and even small acts of gratitude can go a long way to helping us feel better. Michael McCullough of Psychology discusses the positive effect on psychological well-being in a Thanksgiving special on KPBS Midday Edition.\n\n2022 Outstanding Native Triton\n\nPolitical Science doctoral student Alex Zhao, a member of the Navajo Nation, is this year’s Outstanding Native Triton. Zhao, who is conducting research on Indigenous American politics,was selected for the honor by demonstrating leadership and commitment to the Native American community at the university. In this UC San Diego Today story, Zhao’s contributions are celebrated by Elena Hood, director of UC San Diego’s Intertribal Resource Center Director and a doctoral alumna of Education Studies.\n\nA Deep Look into Mental Health: Campus, Community & Around the World\n\nBonnie Kaiser of Anthropology and Global Health was a featured panelist in the “Deep Look” public speaker series, discussing her work to identify and address disparities in global mental health care. The webinar was covered by La Jolla Light, noting that Kaiser spoke about the different ways people around the globe experience and conceptualize mental health and how important it is to match treatment to those experiences.\n\nEight UC San Diego Researchers Among ‘1,000 Best Female Scientists in the World’\n\nTerry Jernigan and Marta Kutas of Cognitive Science are among eight scientists at UC San Diego – and just 11 in all of San Diego, as reported by the San Diego Union-Tribune – to be selected in this first-ever ranking by Research.com. The analytics platform based its choices on the productivity, impact and contribution of the scholars, as well as their awards and achievements.\n\nIn the UC Strike, Professors Can’t Keep Up With Grading. Students Will Suffer\n\nLilly Irani of Communication published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times addressing the strike by 48,000 academic workers across UC campuses. Irani elaborates on the daily struggle she has witnessed, stating that TAs will often take on multiple jobs in order to pay rent, thus prolonging the length of their PhD programs. In addition to the well-being of the TAs, Irani is also concerned for her undergraduate students. “The teaching assistants connect the material to students' aspirations and struggles. The teaching assistants are the ones who figure out how to engage students or notice when they fall through the cracks.”\n\nLatinos Who Use Spanish-language Social Media Get More Misinformation\n\nA study by researchers at UC San Diego and the Center for Social Media at NYU finds that “Latino people use social media differently than do White Americans. What’s more, Latino people who rely on Spanish-language social media are more likely to believe misinformation about election issues and are more likely to rely on social media for information about the coronavirus.” The researchers, including Marisa Abrajano of Political Science and Political Science Ph.D. student Marianna Garcia, described their work in a Washington Post “Monkey Cage” analysis.\n\nThe Turnout Story Emerging From The 2022 Midterm Elections\n\nPolitical scientist Zoltan Hajnal, co-director of the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research, spoke with KPBS Midday Edition about voter turnout and representation.\n\nWhat Does It Take to Reawaken a Native Language?\n\n“Home to over 200 tribes and tribal communities speaking over 80 distinct languages, California is both a biocultural diversity hotspot and the epicenter of a linguistic crisis,” reports PBS station KCET. Yet there are numerous notable successes to reawaken Native languages and tribes are contesting the extinction stereotype. “One of the main things we've been pushing for,” explained Linguistics doctoral candidate Ray Huaute (Chumash/Cahuilla), “is to eliminate the use of the E-word (extinction), the D-word (dead) or the M-word (moribund), as if the language was a dying patient. We prefer to use the terms ‘sleeping language’ or ‘resting language.’”\n\nControl of Congress Matters. But Which Party Now Runs Your State Might Matter More\n\n“Where you live now increasingly determines what policies you live under,” Thad Kousser of Political Science told NPR. With gridlock at the federal level, governors and state legislatures shape daily life in the United States by making policy on guns, abortion,education and the environment. Kousser spoke with numerous outlets throughout the election season, including, among many others, the Associated Press, the San Diego Union-Tribune and NBC San Diego. With KPBS, Kousser discussed “How San Diego's Political Map Shifted From Red to Blue and What Comes Next.”\n\n2022 UC San Diego Veteran of the Year\n\nCarlos Martinez, information technology support supervisor in the School of Social Sciences, is UC San Diego Veteran of the Year. In total, Martinez, who is also a UC San Diego alum, has served the university for a combined 15 years. “As someone who has come from a poor, first-generation college graduate, Latino-Asian-Black background – and to overcome everything that I've kind of had to deal with – this nomination is an honor,” said Martinez.\n\nWhy 2022 May Bring a New Peak of Political Instability\n\nSpeaking with CNN ahead of the election, Gary Jacobson of Political Science said: “I don’t see either side getting a durable advantage. They are highly polarized parties, and they are very closely balanced overall.” Jacobson also spoke with USA Today.\n\nTwelve New Faculty to Be Hired to Design Just Futures\n\nSchool of Social Sciences’ departments where faculty will be hired in conjunction with the Design Lab are: Communication, Political Science, and Urban Studies and Planning. The story about the hiring initiative quotes Design Lab Director Mai Nguyen, who has an academic appointment in Urban Studies and Planning, AVC FEDI Vic Ferreira of Psychology and Teresa Ambo of Education Studies; it also mentions Keolu Fox of Anthropology and Muir Provost Wayne Yang of Ethnic Studies.\n\nReversing Losses in Learning After Covid\n\nKarthik Muralidharan of Economics writes in the Hindustan Times (linked above) about his working paper investigating COVID-19 learning loss and recovery in India. Muralidharan elaborates on the different avenues to reverse the loss, such as keeping schools open and advocating for after-school programs that can aid marginalized students. The research was also featured in The Hindu.\n\nHow Well Are Pandemic Learning Recovery Tactics Working? UC San Diego Will Help Lead 3-Year Study\n\nHow have California’s 1,000 school districts been spending their COVID-19 recovery funds and how successful are they in curbing the loss of learning from the pandemic? UC San Diego, the Public Policy Institute of California, UC Berkeley School of Education, and the state Department of Education assembled a team of researchers to answer these questions, including co-PI Julian Betts of Economics. The federally funded project is featured in the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nUC San Diego Grads Make an Ugly Christmas Sweater on a Massive Scale\n\nEconomics and Psychology alum Evan Mendelsohn and Nick Morton (Biology and Chemistry alum) “met when they were students at UC San Diego,” writes local columnist Diane Bell. “They since have followed their dream of creating what they believe to be the world’s largest ugly Christmas sweater as a big way to celebrate the 10th year of their iconic business, Tipsy Elves.” The company’s motto, or “manifesto,” Bell reports both in the La Jolla Light and the Union-Tribune, is to “make the most outrageous clothes known to mankind in order to make your life more fun.”\n\nOrigin Story\n\nUC San Diego has always been at the forefront of leading-edge research and innovation in the sciences, but not many know it is also a fertile ground for storytellers, especially in the speculative fiction realm. In the Fall 2022 issue of UC San Diego Magazine, Psychology alumna and speculative fiction author Sarina Dahlan of Psychology explores this phenomenon through interviews with sci-fi and speculative fiction writers who also are UC San Diego alumni.\n\nICYMI: Tom Wong Day\n\nThe City of San Diego declared July 11, 2022 to be “Tom Wong Day.” And on Oct.17, the County did the same. Tom Wong of Political Science and the U.S. Immigration Policy Center was celebrated in both declarations for his impactful work on immigration.\n\nCalifornia Team Awarded Federal Grant to Uncover Pandemic Impact on PreK-12 Students\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education’s Institute for Education Sciences has awarded a $3 million grant to a research team led by the Public Policy Institute of California, UC Berkeley School of Education, UC San Diego and California Department of Education to conduct a three-year study of pandemic recovery and equitable outcomes across 1,000 PreK-12 districts in the state. Co-PI Julian Betts of Economics and the San Diego Education Research Alliance (SanDERA) said: “Our contribution at UC San Diego will be to test which types of student support programs are making the biggest difference in helping students get back on track.”\n\nMath to Make a Difference\n\nA myth-busting Q&A with Economics Department Chair Julie Cullen about the field and its future.\n\nWill Young Voters Save Democrats in the Midterm Elections?\n\nIn a normal year – one that simply followed the average of the 19 midterms since the end of World War II – the party in the White House would be expected to lose around 45 House seats, based on a widely used formula developed by Gary Jacobson of Political Science, the Los Angeles Times reports. But this hasn’t been a normal year. One big uncertainty is how many young voters will cast ballots. Separately, a New York Times column by Thomas Edsall, “The Left-Right Divide Might Help Democrats Avoid a Total Wipeout,” also cites Jacobson and his timely essay, “The 2022 U.S. Midterm Election: A Conventional Referendum or Something Different?”\n\nWhat Happens When Politicians Meet TikTok?\n\n“Proving that no form of escapism is a safe refuge from the people who want your vote in November, politicians are invading TikTok,” writes Thad Kousser in an opinion piece for The Hill, in which he argues that this particular social-media medium has a number of worrying features that provide a “schematic for a perpetual motion machine of disinformation.”\n\nCan Biden Save Democracy One US Factory Job at a Time?\n\nPresident Joe Biden is betting on what he has called a “historic manufacturing boom” to spread prosperity across the country, renew the middle class and rebuild pride in the nation itself. This Associated Press story, picked up by US News among many other outlets, cites research by J. Lawrence Broz of Political Science, which showed that populist support was strongest in communities that endured long-term economic and social decline. But, Broz said, “it is unlikely that recent efforts to reshore manufacturing jobs will produce the intended effects, either economically or politically.”\n\nKroner Center for Financial Research Established to Strengthen and Protect Retiree Investments\n\nEconomics alumnus Kenneth Kroner and his wife, Jennifer, have pledged $5 million to establish the Kroner Center for Financial Research. The center, housed at the Rady School of Management in collaboration with the School of Social Sciences, is co-directed by Michael Melvin of the Rady School and Graham Elliott of Economics. It is the only research center of its kind – linking major asset owners around the world with the academic economics and finance community – to address relevant investing questions that ultimately affect the living standards for retirees around the globe.\n\nUC San Diego Launches Two Projects on the Impact of Climate Change on Coastlines and People\n\nLeading a $1.6 million project focused on Puerto Rico is Isabel Rivera-Collazo of Anthropology and Scripps Oceanography. Her lab will collaborate with the University of Puerto Rico-Río Piedras as part of a $20 million National Science Foundation grant administered by the Haskell Indian Nations University in Kansas, “Rising Voices, Changing Coastlines.” Through the Rising Voices initiative, Rivera-Collazo, a Native of Puerto Rico, will explore social justice and ecosystem restoration issues that sea-level rise and climate change have imposed upon Native residents and Indigenous communities. The project will mesh elements of multiple sciences along with traditional ways of being and traditional knowledge.\n\nSacheen Littlefeather and the Question of Native Identity\n\nAndrew Jolivette of Ethnic Studies weighed in with the New York Times on the controversy stirred by research from Jacqueline Keeler, a citizen of Navajo Nation, disputing the late Sacheen Littlefeather’s claims that her father was White Mountain Apache and Yaqui. Keeler’s work to expose what she calls “pretendians,” critics say, casts a cloud of suspicion over all Indigenous people. It suggests that “Native people need to create a system where they have to prove who they say they are,” said Jolivette, who directs Native American and Indigenous Studies at UC San Diego and describes himself as Creole of Opelousa, Atakapa Ishak, French, African, Irish, Italian and Spanish descent. “Why do American Indians have to do that and not other people?”\n\nThe Diamond ‘Slow Street’ in Pacific Beach Is a Success. Closing it Would Be a Mistake.\n\nKatie Crist of Urban Studies and Planning published an opinion piece in The San Diego Union-Tribune featuring the urban design concept of “slow streets” that San Diego experimented with at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Slow streets divert non-residential vehicle traffic and provide a place for people to walk, bike or roll. Diamond Street in Pacific Beach is the only slow street that remains today, and the city’s commitment to retaining it is uncertain. Crist's research shows that removing the slow street would be a mistake – both for people’s health and the health of our environment.\n\nMeet Your New Student Government Leaders\n\nPolitical Science undergraduate student Sky Yang and Ph.D. student Giulia Corno are taking on important new roles this year as they lead organizations on campus that seek to give students a voice of their own and improve their well-being. Yang is the president of Associated Students, and he strives for transparency and engagement with students. Corno is president of the Graduate and Professional Student Association, and she is working on drawing attention to important issues among graduate students, such as living and housing costs.\n\nDACA Is Slowly Dying Unless Congress Steps In to Save It\n\nTIME reports that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program may be reaching the end of its slow demise. “We are at a point now,” said Tom Wong of Political Science and U.S. Immigration Policy Center, “where unless there’s a legislative solution to provide permanent protections for DACA recipients, many will likely lose what they have built over the last decade.” The Los Angeles Times, meanwhile, sought out Wong’s expertise on a story about “red-baiting” campaign mailers sent to Vietnamese Americans in Orange County.\n\nRacial and Gender Disparities in Publishing Start Early for Doctors and Scientists\n\nAmong approximately 30,000 medical school graduates who matriculated from accredited U.S. medical schools between 2014 and 2016, white men had higher publication rates than white women and both men and women from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, reports a Science Careers article. “No more students should be going through this situation,” said Anita Raj of Education Studies and Medicine, director of the Center on Gender Equity and Health. “We need to figure out now how to make sure that [students] have equitable research opportunities and ability to publish.”\n\nWhat Is Even Left of the Voting Rights Act?\n\nRecent efforts to update the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act have failed, and research suggests that strict voter ID laws passed over the last decade may reduce turnout in more racially diverse areas. CNN talked to political scientist Zoltan Hajnal, co-director of the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research, who has studied the effect of voter ID laws and argues that voter turnout alone does not tell the story of access to voting.\n\nDemocrats Hoping Biden Can Provide West Coast Election Boost\n\nWhile Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom easily survived a recall election, voters in the rural north and agricultural inland largely opposed Newsom, and such anger with Democrats could be a driving force in this upcoming election. “Just as the nation is divided into red, blue and purple states, we have those same internal divisions in California,” Thad Kousser of Political Science told the Associated Press. The AP story enjoyed wide pickup, including US News. Separately, Kousser also spoke with Marketplace about a bill making it easier for farm workers to unionize, to the Los Angeles Times about Orange County Coast voters who “fume about gas prices but fear for climate’s future,” and again to the Los Angeles Times about propositions 26 and 27 that would legalize sports betting in the state, among many other outlets on many other topics.\n\nHow Latest Strikes Show Putin Will Stick With Russia’s Hawks on Ukraine War\n\nThe Hill sought out the expertise of Branislav Slantchev of Political Science, who studies conflict and is blogging about the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nCan California Fix Its High-Priced Gasoline Problem?\n\nOur state has particularly high gas prices, says James Hamilton of Economics as a member of the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Econometer panel, in part because California lacks interstate oil and gasoline pipelines: “Sacramento should stop discouraging investment in energy infrastructure.”\n\nThe Era of Quiet Quitting Is Already Over\n\nBusiness Insider reports that workers are again terrified of getting laid off and speaks with Mary Blair-Loy of Sociology, who “has spent her career documenting what she calls the ‘work devotion schema.’”\n\nPolitical Moderates Are Having Their Moment\n\nAbout 4 in 10 Americans identify as moderates, but both Republicans and Democrats have been pushing to mobilize committed members of their party and have paid little attention to persuading swing voters. Seth Hill of Political Science co-authored a study featured in the Los Angeles Times that addresses the importance of moderate voters in American elections. According to Hill’s research, many swing voters are neither inconsistent nor uninterested in politics, rather they’re “ambivalent centrists” – voters who are “confronted by two party coalitions that each express views that are more extreme on some issues than the moderates would prefer.”'\n\nHow the War in Ukraine Might End\n\nThe New Yorker recently spoke to a number of war-termination theorists, including Branislav Slantchev of Political Science, to see what their perspectives could tell us about the war in Ukraine. “In a terrifying blog post,” the New Yorker writes, Slantchev outlines how and why Putin might make a nuclear strike. After reading the New Yorker piece linked above and what Slantchev had to say to the reporter, you can also read “Endgame” post.\n\nRemote Work Drove Over 60% of House-Price Surge, Fed Study Finds\n\n“The shift to working from home drove more than half of the increase in house and rent prices during the pandemic and will likely drive up costs and inflation going forward as the shift becomes permanent,” writes Bloomberg news, according to research co-authored by Johannes Wieland of Economics and a colleague from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The research also caught the attention of New York Times’ columnist Paul Krugman.\n\nCalifornia Approves a Wave of Aggressive New Climate Measures\n\nThe world’s fifth-largest economy has embarked on “its most aggressive effort yet to confront climate change, after lawmakers passed a flurry of bills designed to cut emissions and speed away from fossil fuels,” the New York Times reports, portraying these also as a political victory for Calif. Governor Gavin Newsom. Thad Kousser of Political Science weighed in.\n\nEcon Alum, Mongabay Founder Wins Heinz Award\n\nEconomics alumnus Rhett Ayers Butler ’99, founder and CEO of the environmental news platform Mongabay, has won the 2022 Heinz Award for the Environment. The nonprofit Mongabay produces original reporting on conservation and the environment in 10 languages with more than 800 correspondents in some 70 countries.\n\nAnnual Convocation Inspires New Tritons to Embrace Their Curiosity\n\nThe New Student Welcome Convocation ceremony on RIMAC Field welcomed first-year and transfer students into UC San Diego’s scholarly community with Angela Booker of Communication as the event’s keynote speaker. Booker shared her vibrant sense of humor and wisdom with the audience, in part through the story of her yellow hat, encouraging students to embrace this new chapter in their lives and prioritize their well-being during their time on campus. “While you’re here, it’s okay to grieve the things you let go,” Booker said. “Releasing them lets you step bravely into this beautiful period in your life where who you are and who you are becoming can make the most important things happen for you, for our community, and for society.”\n\nMore Stress, Fewer Coping Resources for Latina Mothers Post-Trump\n\nThe sociopolitical climate in the United States has taken its toll on the mental health of Latina mothers, according to new research co-authored by Amy Non of Anthropology and published in PLOS ONE. “Latinx Americans have been historically disadvantaged on many fronts, including access to quality education, job security and healthcare, making them particularly vulnerable to stressors that can lead to poor mental health,” Non said. “Our findings indicate that in a more hostile political landscape their well-being is even more threatened.” Newsweek was among the outlets reporting on the study.\n\nFederal Interest Rate Hike on Consumers\n\nMarc Muendler of Economics speaks with San Diego’s NBC station.\n\nTransforming Education for Holistic Student Development\n\nIn a Brookings Institution blog post, Amanda Datnow of Education Studies helps summarize a report that she and her co-authors put together for Brookings on the urgent need “to build and rebuild academically focused education systems into humanistic education systems that also support the social, emotional, moral, and civic development of students.” The report, “Transforming education for holistic student development: Learning from education system (re)building around the world,” focuses on the journeys of seven different education systems “as they make the whole child the center of their work.”\n\nViolence Is Common and Increasing in Pandemic-Era California\n\nAccording to the latest annual report from the California Study on Violence Experiences across the Lifespan (CalVEX), the nation’s only multi-year statewide assessment of violent experiences, violence is on the rise in California, with significant increases observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anita Raj of Education Studies and the School of Medicine is the principal investigator. She says: “Current violence prevention efforts are clearly woefully inadequate and often ignore the gendered nature of violence, its intersections with other socioeconomic vulnerabilities and its disproportionate effects on marginalized populations.”\n\nKarthik Muralidharan Examines the Indian State\n\nThe Seen and the Unseen, a “deep dive interview” podcast by influential Indian journalist Amit Varma, features Karthik Muralidharan of Economics.\n\nStudents Should Learn About the Human Impact of War\n\nThinking about news coverage of the war in Ukraine, former history teacher and current Education Studies doctoral student Marco Chacón published an opinion piece in Ed Source arguing it’s important to reform K-12 history curricula to include the devastating wartime stories of individuals. “Few students will need to recite dates, presidents or military strategies as adults, but most will cross paths with people displaced by violence, and others from invading countries. They will elect officials who promote and oppose wars and refugee-related legislation,” Chacón writes.\n\nMax Planck-Humboldt Research Award for Studies on Censorship and Disinformation\n\nMargaret “Molly” Roberts of Political Science has been selected for the 2022 Max Planck-Humboldt Research Award. In announcing the competitive award, which supports collaboration with German universities, the award committee noted Roberts’ pioneering work and the central question of her research: “How is it that individual authoritarian regimes and criminals can effectively spread fake news on the Internet and manipulate the public?” Roberts will carry out her project, analyzing “the opaque moderation procedures of social media platforms,” with colleagues at the Technical University of Munich and the University of Konstanz.\n\nWhat Are Animals Thinking?\n\nNational Geographic magazine’s cover story features the work of Federico Rossano of Cognitive Science and his Comparative Cognition Lab. (Note: Link is for subscribers.)\n\nAddress STEM Inequality by Reconceiving Merit\n\n“Academic scientists value scientific excellence and believe they can judge it accurately. Yet women, people of color and LGBTQ+ scientists, who are just as productive as their white heterosexual male peers, are routinely marginalized and devalued,” write Mary Blair-Loy of Sociology and doctoral alum Erin Cech in their article for Times Higher Education. Their recently published book, “Misconceiving Merit,” addresses two schemas that “anchor sexism, racism and heteronormativity in academic STEM,” and in their piece for THE Campus, the co-authors propose four strategies for solutions.\n\nSan Diego Citizens Wrest Control of Surveillance Tech Away From Police\n\nCommunity-led efforts to address potential civil liberties violations, spurred by the deployment of more 3,000 police cameras across the city, paid off when the San Diego City Council voted unanimously to stop police from making any future decisions about surveillance unilaterally. Under a new ordinance, the city will assemble a privacy advisory board comprised of community leaders and technology experts to determine the impact of surveillance products and policies on San Diegans’ civil liberties. Lilly Irani of Communication, who is a member of the TRUST SD Coalition that backed the ordinance, told Gizmodo the group researched ordinances in other cities such as Seattle and Oakland in an effort to devise a broader regulatory scheme that incorporated community approval.\n\nIn Kansans’ Landslide Turnout for Abortion Rights, a Glimpse of Post-Dobbs Politics\n\n“When the Supreme Court overturned federal protections for abortion rights in Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization in June, that didn’t end the debate. It rolled a political grenade into every statehouse across the nation, writes Thad Kousser of Political Science in the Los Angeles Times. In his opinion piece, Kousser dives into the world of “post-Dobbs politics,” focusing on states’ political actions, increasing tensions amongst political parties, and what this means for our future elections.\n\nWe’re Afraid to Talk About Sex. This UCSD Professor Says We Shouldn’t Be\n\nThe San Diego Union-Tribune sat down for a Q&A with Janna Dickenson of Psychology. “I envision a world – or, at least, a campus – where accessing scientific information about sexuality is easy, and that’s why I started the SWAG Lab,” she said, referring to the Sexual Well-being and Gender Lab that she leads at UC San Diego.\n\nAs California Strengthens Abortion Protections, SoCal Leader Proposes ‘Sanctuary City' For the Unborn\n\nCalifornia is one step closer to becoming a sanctuary state for abortion access, but a Temecula councilwoman is drawing attention for proposing an abortion ban within city limits. Speaking with NBC7, Thad Kousser of Political Science said a city doesn't have the power to override state law. Kousser made numerous other media appearances, on a variety of different political matters. These included: speaking with the Los Angeles Times about politicians trying to connect with young voters on TikTok; with KPBS on how student loan forgiveness might help Biden with some voters; and with the Bay Area News Group about a poll showing that most Californians oppose a Biden second term.\n\nThe Man Who Did the Math on America’s Partisan Divisions\n\nSamuel Popkin of Political Science spoke with the New York Times about his sometime collaborator, the late Howard Rosenthal, who helped develop a formula to give Congressional votes a partisan score and helped explain the rise of Donald Trump and Trumpism: “Howard was the person who started pointing out that the median income of a white man in America hasn’t increased against inflation since the late 1960s. Nobody wants to say that.”\n\nIs the Border More Secure Under Biden Than Trump? What We Know\n\nA wide-ranging piece in Newsweek discussing the partisan claims about migrant crossing and what the (flawed) government data show quotes Wayne Cornelius of Political Science extensively, including with this: “the differences from the Obama and Trump years to Biden are not that striking.”\n\nUnderlying Energy Market Conditions Could Signal Pain for Consumers This Winter and Beyond\n\nIn the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the European Union (EU) has attempted to cut itself off from natural gas imports from Russia. A Fox Business exploration of what that might mean not only internationally but nationally turned to James Hamilton of Economics for some insights.\n\nIn Memoriam: Victor Magagna, Associate Professor of Political Science\n\nWe are saddened to share that longtime faculty member Victor Valentine Magagna of Political Science – who dedicated himself to teaching thousands of students over the course of three decades at UC San Diego – passed away Aug. 3, 2022.\n\nThis Hawaiian Geneticist Works to Empower Indigenous Peoples\n\nNational Geographic profiles Keolu Fox of Anthropology. Fox, who says it’s critical for “historically vulnerable communities to be in control of their information,” has co-founded the Indigenous Futures Institute and the Native BioData Consortium.\n\nMaking Sense: How Sound Becomes Hearing\n\nPsychologist Diana Deutsch is featured in an “Unexplainable” podcast from Vox Media that has now won the Online Journalism Award: 2022 Excellence in Audio Digital Storytelling.\n\n‘Gonzo Governance: The Media Logic of Donald Trump’\n\nSociology doctoral alum David L. Altheide ’74, who recently retired from teaching in the School of Social Transformation at Arizona State University for 37 years, has a forthcoming book that “offers a new interpretation of presidential power that shifts focus to the media dynamics that surrounded Donald Trump.”\n\nAnaheim’s ‘Little Arabia’ Neighborhood Is Finally Official\n\nA poll conducted in 2021 by political scientist Tom Wong’s U.S. Immigration Policy Center in collaboration with the Arab American Civic Council found that 58% of registered Anaheim voters supported designating Little Arabia.\n\nNew Grant Program to Help Aspiring School Counselors\n\nThe new California state budget includes $184 million to pay for the teaching grants and other efforts to recruit more counselors and mental health clinicians. Amy Bintliff of Education Studies told KPBS’s “Midday Edition” program that the need for counselors in California is great. “One in 300 California youth have lost a parent or direct caregiver to COVID-19. That's higher in California than nationally,” Bintliff said. “So, we're a state that's full of grieving children. And schools don't necessarily have the resources at hand to work through all of that without having quality counselors.”\n\nThis Is Why Disability Advocates Say It’s Not OK to Use ‘Spazz’ in Lyrics\n\n“Both Beyoncé and Lizzo have been called out recently for using the ableist term 'spazz' on album tracks. And, to their credit, both women reacted quickly to the backlash,” writes Billboard magazine. “In both cases, the apparent intention was to refer to someone who appears to be out of control/not able to control their actions, employing it as colloquial slang.” David Serlin of Communication commented: “When I first read about it, I attributed it less to cruelty or somehow more to their cluelessness about the power and stigma of the word,” Serlin said. And while that’s not an excuse to use a potentially offensive word, Serlin distinguishes it from people who deliberately use language to stigmatize and hurt people.\n\nSian Beilock Is First Woman Named President of Dartmouth College\n\nIn Dartmouth College’s 252-year history, Cognitive Science alum Sian Beilock will be the first woman to assume its presidency. Beilock, 46, who will start at Dartmouth July 2023 and is currently president of Barnard College in New York, explained to The Washington Post that her multiple identities are all “front and center” in her work: “President, mother, researcher – they all contribute to one’s ability to lead. I really embrace them all.” Beilock’s accomplishments are also featured in the San Francisco Gate, among many other outlets.\n\nThe 8 Economists Who Decide If the U.S. Is in a Recession\n\nWhile famous politicians and pundits are already publicly arguing about it, the official pronouncement of whether the U.S. economy is in a recession will be made by a “little-known group of economists selected by the National Bureau of Economic Research called the ‘Business Cycle Dating Committee,’ which stubbornly takes its time and tries to wall itself off from political interference or attempts to spin its findings,” reports The Washington Post. “The eight economists on the committee,” the story continues, “are among the most respected in their field,” and include Valerie Ramey of UC San Diego’s Department of Economics.\n\nThe Channels of Student Activism: How the Left and Right Are Winning (and Losing) in Campus Politics Today‘\n\nThe Next Big Idea Club – a virtual subscription book club co-founded by Malcolm Gladwell and other well-known public intellectuals so as to have “a better way to discover and interact with today’s great writers and thinkers” – features Amy Binder of Sociology and doctoral alum Jeffrey Kidder, now at Northern Illinois University. On the Next Big Idea, Binder and Kidder share five key insights from their new book, one of which is this: “We need renewed dedication to productive civic engagement within the academy.”\n\nNSF Awards $1M to Multi-Disciplinary Team to Plan Pandemic Prevention Hub\n\nA multi-campus, multi-disciplinary team led by scientists at UC San Diego has been awarded $1 million from the National Science Foundation to plan a new center to prevent and rapidly contain disease outbreaks and their negative effects on health, the economy and society. The team includes Anita Raj of Medicine and Education Studies.\n\nPeople Who Live in Their Cars See 24-Hour Parking as Long Overdue\n\nThe San Diego City Council unanimously agreed to fund 24-hour operations at an 86-space parking lot in Mission Valley for people living in vehicles, thanks in part to research led by Mirle Rabinowitz Bussell and Leslie Lewis, co-directors of the Homelessness Hub in Urban Studies and Planning. Sociology doctoral candidate Stacey Livingstone, who worked on the research to evaluate the city’s Safe Parking Program operated by Jewish Family Service, was present for the vote. Livingstone, the Union-Tribune reports, “told council members that 180 people were interviewed in the study, and it was resoundingly clear that a 24-hour safe parking lot was desired.” Learn more about how the research contributed to Mayor Todd Gloria’s decision to expand the Safe Parking Program and about the recent establishment of the Homelessness Hub with generous gifts from the Epsteins and the Gleibermans.\n\n2021-22 Exemplary Staff Employee of the Year Award Recipients\n\nTwo staff members from Linguistics are among the university’s most exemplary employees: Christina Knerr Frink, the department’s chief administrative officer, and Jeffrey Lau, academic human resources analyst. Big congrats to Christina and Jeffrey – and to the department as a whole! No other academic unit has two winners of this competitive award, and Linguistics only has six staff in total. Read more about the winners on the department’s news page.\n\nScience Inequity Rooted in ‘Moralized’ Worship of ‘Hard Work’\n\nTimes Higher Education reports on a new book by sociologist Mary Blair-Loy, co-authored with doctoral alum Erin Cech, now at the University of Michigan. A decade-long study of scientists’ output and attitudes, “Misconceiving Merit“ shows why structural tactics to tackle gender and race inequalities in the sciences continue to fail. A key discovery according to Blair-Loy, the THE reports, “is that many scientific leaders truly believe that hard work will win out in the end – even though the reality is clearly at odds with that.”\n\nVentura County Proposes Steep Increases in Bond Requirements for Oil and Gas Operators\n\nAn in-depth story on efforts to mitigate the financial and environmental impacts of abandoned oil and gas wells that haven’t been properly plugged or decommissioned cites a 2018 California Council on Science and Technology report led by Judson Boomhower of Economics. “When you start digging in to just what it is going to cost to eventually take care of that problem,” Boomhower says, “the numbers get big pretty quickly.”\n\n''Language Is Incredible’\n\nYou can now watch the video of the “2022 Legacy Lecture” delivered by Will Styler of Linguistics in which he explains why language may just be the most complicated and amazing thing any of us will ever do. A “Legacy Lecture” responds to the prompt “If this were the last lecture you ever gave, what would you want to share with the world?”\n\nWhy Overturning Roe Will Unleash a Legal Storm for the Supreme Court\n\nHarry Litman of Political Science, in an opinion piece for the New York Times: “While laying waste to 50 years of abortion jurisprudence, the Supreme Court – or at least four of the five members of the new hard-right majority – took pains to reassure the country that it had executed an isolated hit on an ‘egregiously wrong’ precedent that would not reverberate in other areas of constitutional law. But the court will not fully control whether and when it will have to confront demands for similarly breathtaking changes. In fact, the justices’ agenda will be driven primarily by the political ferment in red states that are racing to capitalize on one of the most conservative blocs of five justices in at least 100 years. And that in turn means that overturning Roe v. Wade will not take the issue of abortion out of the courts but rather intensify the battle there.”\n\nLet’s Not Pretend We’re Keeping Our Promises on Asylum\n\nWealthy nations are experimenting with “quasi-legal methods to repel asylum seekers,” subverting the spirit of international law, writes Megan Stack, contributing opinion writer for the New York Times – with the United States turning back migrants for the past two years on “the pretext of the pandemic and a rarely used health ordinance known as Title 42.” David FitzGerald of Sociology, co-director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, spoke with Stack: “These policies are very much a race to the bottom,” FitzGerald said. “The governments are all keenly aware of what other governments are doing to keep out asylum seekers. They copy each other. They’re clearly inspired by each other.”\n\nThis May Be Democrats’ Only Chance to Blunt a Red Wave in November\n\n“The tightening correlation between voters’ attitudes toward a president and their support for U.S. House, Senate and even gubernatorial candidates from [the same] party” threatens Democrats as Joe Biden’s ratings continue to drop, writes CNN political analyst Ronald Brownstein in his Fault Lines column, turning to Gary Jacobson of Political Science for his expertise. There’s “a growing tendency of voters to treat congressional elections in particular as parliamentary contests,” Jacobson said, “that are less a choice between individuals than between which party they want to control the majority and set the agenda.”\n\n2022 Dissertation Year Fellowship Award Recipients\n\nSocial Sciences doctoral students Andrew Matschiner of Education Studies, Pamela Riviere of Cognitive Science and Melanie West of Ethnic Studies are among those selected for the UC President’s Dissertation Year Fellowship. Congrats to all three!\n\nCalifornia’s Newsom Goes to Washington; 2024 Chatter Follows\n\nAs Governor Newsom headed to the nation’s capital to receive an award on behalf of his home state, the Associated Press predicted there would be speculation about his presidential ambitions. Thad Kousser of Political Science weighed in with “This is Gavin Newsom building his national brand for whatever opportunities might come up in the future.” The AP story ran in numerous outlets, including NBC 7 San Diego, San Francisco Gate, Chron, WTOP News, The Denver Post, The Hamilton Spectator, Toronto Star and CBS Los Angeles. Separately if relatedly, Kousser was also quoted by CalMatters columnist Dan Walters in a commentary picked up by Yahoo News, Napa Valley Register and The Hanford Sentinel.\n\nUS, Allies Aim to Cap Russian Oil Prices to Hinder Invasion\n\nJames Hamilton of Economics says that garnering the participation of China and India will be key to enforcing any price cap plan. “It’s an international diplomatic challenge on how you get people to agree. It’s one thing if you get the U.S. to stop buying oil, but if India and China continue to buy” at elevated prices, “there’s no impact on Russian revenues,” Hamilton told the AP in a story that ran around the world, including in U.S. News, CTV News, Global News Online, The Atlanta Journal Constitution, Los Angeles Times, Orange County Register, The Denver Post, Daily Herald, News Tribune, among others.\n\nIs San Diego on the Right Track With its New Wage Theft Proposal?\n\nSan Diego is considering a proposal that would mandate those applying for building permits to complete detailed paperwork on their workers. James Hamilton of Economics weighs in on the matter as a member of the San Diego Union-Tribune “Econometer” panel, stating that this proposal would slow down the construction of housing units that San Diego desperately needs.\n\nMeet the Authors’ Webinar\n\nThe July 2022 installment of a webinar series from the Linguistics Society of America featured Linguistics graduate student Tory Sampson and faculty member Rachel Mayberry, authors of “An Emerging SELF: The Copula Cycle in American Sign Language.” Sampson and Mayberry’s work documents the emergence of the copula – a word meaning to be (e.g., is, was, are, were) – in ASL, something that has been overlooked in previous linguistic analyses. Here’s video of the webinar.\n\n14 New Latinx Studies Faculty to be Hired at UC San Diego\n\nThe Latinx Cluster Hire Initiative, supported by a $500,000 grant awarded through UC’s Advancing Faculty Diversity Program, aims to increase faculty diversity, spur innovative research and infuse culture into the curriculum. There are currently seven ladder-rank faculty searches underway at UC San Diego, including within the School of Social Sciences’ departments of Urban Studies and Planning, Ethnic Studies and Anthropology.\n\nSupporting the “Grandmother Hypothesis”\n\nHumans are one of the only species known to live well past menopause. According to the “grandmother hypothesis,” this is because older women provide important support in raising human infants and children, who require more care than the young of other species. A new paper co-authored by Pascal Gagneux of Anthropology and the School of Medicine, supports the hypothesis by tracking the evolution of a gene variant that supports cognitive health in older humans.\n\nMitigating Bias Through Rubrics\n\nInside Higher Ed reports on a case study to investigate faculty hiring rubrics, led by Mary Blair-Loy of Sociology with colleagues at the Jacobs School of Engineering. The research, detailed in a Science ‘Policy Forum’ paper, shows that while the hiring rubrics – also called criterion checklists or evaluation tools – helped mitigate some gender bias as on STEM department made its hiring decisions, a lot of bias still persisted.\n\nTurning Point USA Donations Surged During the Pandemic\n\n“Ten anonymous donors helped boost the organization’s revenue in the 2020 fiscal year,” writes NBC News, “helping it expand its focus on culture war activism and become a political powerhouse.” The in-depth story quotes sociologist Amy Binder.\n\nResearch Evaluations Are Narrowing the British Social Sciences\n\nJuan Pablo Pardo-Guerra of Sociology writes in the Times Higher Education Supplement about the evidence detailed in his new book, “The Quantified Scholar,” showing that “slowly but surely, UK [social science] disciplines have been moved in the direction of greater intellectual homogeneity.” And this is not a good thing, he explains, as “study after study demonstrates that serendipity and diversity are critical for innovation and the advancement of knowledge. Homogeneity constrains our imaginations and our ability to find solutions to collective problems.”\n\nWhy Billionaires Like MacKenzie Scott and Jack Dorsey Are Donating Millions to This Nonprofit That Gives Cash to the Poor\n\nForbes presents an extensive story on the nonprofit GiveDirectly, co-founded by Paul Niehaus of Economics.\n\nCampus Raises $3.05 Billion as Campaign for UC San Diego Concludes\n\nUC San Diego is the nation’s youngest university to reach a multibillion-dollar fundraising campaign thanks to gifts of all sizes from more than 163,000 donors. The campus success story, “Changing the World Through Philanthropy,” includes such significant donations to the School of Social Sciences as gifts from Phyllis and Dan Epstein and Hanna and Mark Gleiberman to establish the Homelessness Hub and ongoing support from Jerri-Ann and Gary E. Jacobs for K-12 education and graduate fellowships. Thousands of people gave to support Social Sciences’ student career preparation and community-driven programs addressing housing, health and racial inequality, diversifying the tech industry, and police accountability, among many impact areas.\n\nAuthors Discuss Book on Science and Definitions of Merit\n\n“Science is a meritocracy. The merit of scientists’ ideas matters much more than whether a scientist is Black or white, a man or a woman, and is gay or straight. Right? Not so fast,” writes Inside Higher Ed in prefacing correspondence with Mary Blair-Loy of Sociology and doctoral alum Erin Cech, now at the University of Michigan, about their new book, “Misconceiving Merit.” The book studies more than 500 STEM professors at a top research university to show how cultural ideas of merit nonetheless produce unfair and unequal outcomes for professors who are women, people of color and/or LGBTQ. Read more in Blair-Loy’s “Tweetorial“ on the book. Relatedly, Blair-Loy and colleagues at the Jacobs School of Engineering show in a Science “Policy Forum” paper how bias in hiring women engineering professors persists even when a well-intentioned group uses a method considered a best practice.\n\nMarco Werman of the ‘The World’ to Host Public Radio Program from UC San Diego\n\nThe host of the international news program “The World“ from GBH and PRX, Marco Werman, will serve as the university’s first Journalist in Residence and will host the public radio show from a new broadcast studio in the Department of Communication built as part of its “Democracy Lab” initiative. In making the announcement, Communication Chair Brian Goldfarb said, in part: “Our collaboration with ‘The World’ comes at an exciting and critical time. Communication is inextricably tethered to questions of democracy, diversity, and justice.” The Union-Tribune, the Times of San Diego and others reported on the news.\n\nShort Group Quizzes Go a Long Way to Building a Class Community\n\nSociologist Michel Estefan implements fresh teaching techniques to ensure an education that’s genuinely inclusive and student-centered. These techniques needn’t be whiz-bang or complicated to be effective. And students have noticed. Sociology Chair Amy Binder remarks that not only are Estefan’s classes wait-listed but also that “he’s brought in new courses that students really appreciate – the sociology of social justice, for example, and another on race and racism in the United States.”\n\nCommentary: Foreign Policy on Ukraine Shows West’s Arrogance\n\n“It makes no sense for Western pundits, from nations that are not fighting, to debate whether the war should continue,” writes Erik Gartzke of Political Science in an opinion piece published by News Tribune. “It is not up to officials in the West whether Ukraine continues to resist Russian aggression or whether President Vladimir Putin persists or pulls the plug on his ill-conceived military campaign. The West has quite carefully, and consciously, absented its armies from Ukraine’s battlefields. … With a policy of restraint comes the obligation not to engage in hubris (or timidity) by proxy.”\n\nDogs With Something to Say Press Buttons for Words in UCSD Cognition Study\n\nKPBS features what scientists at UC San Diego are calling the biggest community science project ever done on animal communication. Dogs use soundboards, whose buttons they press with a paw or a nose, to communicate human words, thoughts – maybe even sentences. The project is led by Federico Rossano of Cognitive Science. He said the goal of studying cognition in animals is to understand what is uniquely human and what kind of thinking is shared with other creatures.\n\nNew Prenatal Genetic Screens Pose Underappreciated Ethical Dilemmas\n\nWriting in Scientific American, Daniel Navon of Sociology considers “the myriad dilemmas unleashed” by cutting-edge prenatal screening technologies such as NIPT (or NIPS) and PGT. With often hard-to-interpret results, the tests raise ethical issues, says Navon, “that do not fit neatly into futuristic discussions of ‘designer babies’ or entrenched debates about abortion,” but we as a society must grapple with them nonetheless.\n\nCalifornia Survey Finds Hot-Button Issues May Spark Voter Turnout in November\n\nDespite low turnout in the June primary elections, the national political battle over the issue of abortion could spur greater voter participation in November, according to a survey experiment run by the Yankelovich Center for Social Science Research at UC San Diego, reports the San Diego Union-Tribune. The center’s latest survey [PDF] – “Looking Ahead to November: How Will Reproductive Rights, Crime Rates and Top Two Dynamics Shape California’s General Election?” – was covered by several different outlets, including the Los Angeles Times, which focused on how California is likely to remain blue even if a red wave sweeps the nation later this year. The report’s lead author, Yankelovich Center Co-Director Thad Kousser of Political Science joined KPBS “Midday Edition” to discuss how, if voter turnout remains low, California voters will skew older and wealthier than the state’s demographics.\n\nAppointment of Victor Ferreira as AVC-FEDI\n\nVictor Ferreira of Psychology has been appointed associate vice chancellor for Faculty Equity, Diversion, and Inclusion. Ferreira will work in partnership with the director of the Center for Faculty, Diversity and Inclusion and collaborate numerous units across campus to provide academic leadership and direction in advancing the university’s goal of achieving and sustaining equity, diversity, and inclusion for all faculty at UC San Diego.\n\n2022 Distinguished Teaching Awards\n\nKudos to Abigail Andrews of Sociology and to graduate student Ethan Hurwitz of Psychology, who are among this year’s recipients of the Academic Senate awards for distinguished teaching.\n\nDid the Federal Reserve Make the Right Call Increasing Interest Rates?\n\nTo try and slow inflation, the Federal Reserve has approved the largest interest-rate increase since 1994. “It will be very hard at this point to bring inflation down without causing a recession,” said James Hamilton as a member of the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Econometer panel. “The Fed will likely be forced to keep raising rates through the end of the year, and that could slow economic growth significantly.”\n\nMayor Gloria Announces Funding to Operate Safe Parking Lot 24 Hours\n\nIn announcing a proposed expansion to the city’s Safe Parking Program, operated under contract by Jewish Family Service of San Diego, the San Diego mayor’s office shared research on the effectiveness of the program [PDF], conducted by faculty and students in the Department of Urban Studies and Planning. “Our research showed that [safe parking] is a critical tool in our collective toolbox for addressing homelessness in San Diego,” said Mirle Rabinowitz-Bussell, co-director of the new Homelessness Hub at UC San Diego and a co-author of the cited report. Leslie Lewis, also co-director and co-author, added: “We are pleased that our report findings could contribute to the mayor’s decision to increase the hours of the Safe Parking Program. Research is made meaningful through its policy, practice and human impacts.” KPBS reported the news following a unanimous vote by the city council to approve the expansion.\n\nThree Years After a Referendum in Which Colombians Rejected an Agreement with FARC, the Pact Signed by Santos Faces Difficulties\n\nAlexander Fattal of Communication was quoted in a recent story about the Columbian election in prominent Brazilian outlet G1 Globo.\n\nHumans Didn’t Evolve to Count so Numbers Remain a Challenge\n\nRafael Núñez of Cognitive Science is featured on KPBS for his research on numbers vs. inexact discrimination of quantities. “We are a species that has been around for 250,000 years and numbers have not been around that long,” Núñez explains.\n\nEvent Celebrates $1M Gift in Cyber-Archaeology from Philanthropist Norma Kershaw\n\nThe Qualcomm Institute held a celebratory showcase of cyber-archaeology research made possible in part by the generosity of the late Norma Kershaw and led by Thomas Levy of Anthropology, director of the QI’s Center for Cyber-Archaeology and Sustainability. The Union-Tribune reported on the bequest, noting that Levy, who also holds a chair endowed by Kershaw, is “especially interested in examining how the culture, climate and environment of the eastern Mediterranean have changed over the past 10,000 years.”\n\nShould The U.S. Impose a Windfall Tax on Oil and Gas Companies?\n\nOil and gas companies in the United Kingdom will be taxed an additional 25% on their profits to fund a new benefits package that will aid low-income households. In the San Diego Union-Tribune, James Hamilton of Economics expresses his concern regarding a similar conversation among economists in the U.S.: “If “windfall” taxes are imposed on oil producers, the U.S. will produce significantly less oil. That would mean higher prices for U.S. consumers and make it harder for the world to get by without Russian production,” Hamilton said.\n\nCalifornia Election: Who Will Newsom, Bonta, Padilla Face in November?\n\nRepublican State Sen. Brian Dahle is soon to face Governor Newsom, but will he be able to compete with the state’s most powerful Democrat, who has already defeated a recall effort? Thad Kousser of Political Science weighed in on the matter with the Bay Area News Group, stating “The governor won this race last September.” In addition to East Bay Times, the article also ran in Mercury News, The Santa Cruz Sentinel and Marin Independent Journal. Kousser also weighed in with the Coast News Group as a fraud lawsuit against Oceanside Councilman Chris Rodriguez headed to jury trial.\n\nIn Memoriam: Founding Chair of Linguistics, Leonard D. Newmark\n\nWe deeply regret to share that Professor Emeritus Leonard D. Newmark, founding chair of the UC San Diego Department of Linguistics – who came to the nascent university in 1963 and helped build the campus in innumerable ways – has died. After years of challenges with Parkinson’s disease and dementia, Newmark died from COVID-19 on May 2, 2022. He was 93.\n\nClass of 2022 Shining Stars\n\nAmong the inspiring students featured in this end-of-year story is Kayla Monnette of Cognitive Science, president of the UC San Diego Student Foundation, a student-run nonprofit philanthropic organization. Monnette, who is graduating with Provost Honors and a 3.9 major GPA, failed her first major-related class. She attributes her ultimate success to the “beautiful support system” she found in the Student Foundation’s community of peers and alumni mentors who lifted her up and believed in her even when she didn’t – or couldn’t – believe in herself.\n\nIt Starts from Within\n\nPreparing to congratulate 7,000 of his peers on graduation, Commencement 2022 student speaker Lucas Anthony Lima of Political Science “draws inspiration from the lessons he has instilled in his little brother,” shared a ThisWeek@UCSanDiego feature story. “The most important of these,” the story continued, “is believing in yourself, especially when the road gets rocky. As someone who has faced persistent immigration barriers and made the courageous decision to embrace his transgender identity, Lima knows firsthand how persistence and self-love can help overcome any obstacle.” To read more about this year’s graduation celebrations, including Lima’s speech, check out this All Campus Commencement story. The story also notes a crowd-pleasing performance of the national anthem by Psychology student Arisa Namioka and includes reflections by Shimika Basuray of Cognitive Science on the emotions of graduating.\n\nClass of 2022 Outstanding Grads\n\nAnother end-of-year piece features Salad Omar of Economics. A first-generation college student who transferred to UC San Diego in 2020, Omar was encouraged to pursue higher education by his mother, who never learned to read or write. “I came to the United States in 2017 as a refugee; I didn’t know how to take the bus or use a GPS,” Omar said, remembering. “Seeing a blind man go to work every day and visiting him gave me the hope I needed to know that I can overcome every challenge as I become someone who helps my family.”\n\nTake 10 With a Triton: Alumnus Jose Perez Shares Why His Heart Belongs to Triton Transit\n\nUrban Studies and Planning alum Jose Perez ‘05 has a special relationship with Triton Transit that dates back almost two decades. He started as a shuttle driver when still a student and met his wife while both were driving buses on campus – and he’s now returned as general manager. Passionate about inclusivity, sustainability and leadership, Perez is energized by recent efforts to secure federal funding for the Voigt Electric Mobility Hub and looks forward to contributing to the university’s sustainability efforts.\n\nUCSD Professor Tom Wong Wins National Civil Rights Award\n\nFor his work on immigrant rights, including research cited in a number of prominent court cases, the American Civil Liberties Union has honored Tom Wong of Political Science with its Presidential Award. “I have never imagined myself as an academic who writes books and articles that only a handful of other academics read,” Wong told the San Diego Union-Tribune, which covered the award. “I have always seen my job as a professor as a platform to have broader impact.” The ACLU award is presented biennially to academics “for outstanding contributions to civil liberties.”\n\nElected to the Academy\n\nAna Celia Zentella of Ethnic Studies, one of the world’s leading researchers on multilingualism, linguistic diversity and language intolerance, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, one of the nation’s oldest and most esteemed honorary societies. Zentella’s approach is one she calls “anthro-political linguistics.”\n\nHe’s Studied Mental Illness for 50 Years. Here Are All the Things We’re Doing Wrong\n\nThe Los Angeles Times ran an extended interview with Andrew Scull of Sociology, “a singular authority on more than 200 years of the medical profession’s tangled relationship with mental illness,” about his new book, “Desperate Remedies: Psychiatry’s Turbulent Quest to Cure Mental Illness.” Scull, the L.A. Times noted, is “especially critical of the last 20 years when research narrowed its focus onto possible biological factors for mental illness. The lack of concern with the social and psychological dimensions of mental disturbance, he argues, has precipitated inequities in treatment and led to the consignment of the mentally ill to the streets and jails of this country.” Scull also joined KPBS Midday Edition for an interview.\n\nLeading From the S tern\n\nUrban Studies and Planning undergraduate student Bailey Kim, who is majoring in real estate and development, is recognized for her hard work in two competitive arenas – rowing and real estate. She is a coxswain for UC San Diego men’s rowing and is also a part of the university’s NAIOP real estate development competition team.\n\nForcing Homeless People Into Treatment Can Backfire. What About a Firm Nudge?\n\nNeil Gong of Sociology published an op-ed in The Washington Post on the intertwined crises of homelessness and mental illness. “In March,” write Gong and coauthor, “California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed tackling the problem with a sweeping new plan involving something called Care Courts that could push people with psychosis into treatment. The Care Courts, if implemented with sensitivity and robust resources, could actually be a step forward. But for that to happen, each side will have to acknowledge some hard truths. The hard truth that advocates of forced treatment ought to concede is that coercion often backfires.” The piece was reprinted by SFGate.\n\nThe ‘Great Reshuffling’ Played a Big Part in Pushing Home Prices Higher\n\nCNN explores the connections between social changes brought about by the COVID pandemic and their role in the U.S. housing market with Johannes Wieland of Economics. In a working paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Wieland and a coauthor from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco show that the shift to working from home played a bigger role than previously thought. “We were pretty shocked remote work had this impact, once we saw the estimates,” Wieland said. “We thought about how people moving to different locations would be important. And it is. But it is the people who are remaining in a metro area – the people who need more space at home if they work at home -- that is really pushing up prices. That is the majority of the story.”\n\nUnder Pressure\n\nSociologist Mary Blair-Loy says the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed gender inequities for working parents, but “new attention to these problems means we can begin to address them.”\n\nFocus on Preventing Sexual and Domestic Violence\n\n“Prevention of sexual and domestic violence is fundamentally important to strengthening our communities and state as part of how we contend with the COVID-19 pandemic and its harmful lingering effects. Why? Because prevention efforts have multifold benefits beyond just reducing incidents of violence now. They also help stop the cycle of intergenerational violence.” – Anita Raj of Education Studies and the School of Medicine, in an opinion piece for The San Diego Union-Tribune on the need for ongoing rather than one-time funding of violence prevention.\n\nFamily Stories\n\nTritons recount what it means to be a family – the ancestry, the history, the traditions and the importance of preserving stories for future generations. This Triton Magazine story features profiles of alumni Nyssa P. Chopra ’07 of Political Science, Joel Poremba ’89 of Political Science and Michael Genhart ‘84 of Psychology, among others.\n\nAbortion Opinion Leak Unprecedented But Not a Supreme Court First\n\n“More distrust” of the high court is likely now that the leak of a draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade was released, experts tell NBC News. “Basically what we're facing right now is totally unprecedented, and it’s going to have political repercussions that are pretty severe,” said Peter Irons of Political Science.\n\nWill San Diego County’s Population Continue to Decline?\n\nWithin the last year, San Diego decreased in population by 11,183 residents. And there is debate among analysts about what might be driving residents out of the city. James Hamilton of Economics provided his expert opinion to the San Diego Union-Tribune: “The high cost of living – and in particular housing – is a big factor. I don’t see San Diego’s housing problem being solved soon, which is why I think the exodus could well continue.”\n\nMeet the Candidates in the 49th Congressional Battleground District\n\nThe 49th Congressional district has been redrawn based on the last census and now spans from Del Mar to Dana Point. The new boundaries make the 49th a swing district: 36% of the voters are registered Democrats, 33.6% are registered Republicans and the rest are independents. “That’s now going to be the battleground district for San Diego that I think you’re going to see Republicans contesting and Democrats putting a lot of resources into,” Thad Kousser of Political Science said to NBC7.\n\nFour Candidates Compete for Open Seat in 80th Assembly District\n\nThere are a lot of twists and turns to contest in the recently redrawn 80th Assembly district, which includes most of South Bay, Chula Vista, National City, Imperial Beach and Otay Mesa. Political scientist Thad Kousser weighed in on the matter in the San Diego Union-Tribune. “It’s leaving voters to have two elections for two different candidates, for two different 80th assembly districts,” Kousser said. “If many voters are confused by this, they should be.”\n\nDo E-Scooter Companies in San Diego Need Additional Regulation?\n\nJames Hamilton of Economics says “yes”: “We want to encourage alternatives to cars but need to ensure public safety. It should be as easy to report riders who pose a danger as it is to rent a scooter.” The Union-Tribune Q&A with experts was picked up by Government Technology and others.\n\nA Decade Ago, California Adopted a Strange Top-Two Primary System. How’s It Working Out?\n\nProposition 14 created the “top-two primary” a decade ago, and it has since been tested in five, soon to be six, elections. Some reformers, writes Los Angeles Times columnist Nicholas Goldberg, are now suggesting that the system, which was originally meant to subvert political gridlock in California, be expanded to other states in an effort to combat the nation’s growing political polarization. Thad Kousser of Political Science expressed his skepticism: “...it hasn’t changed who voters have elected or the type of candidate they’ve elected. It hasn’t been a silver bullet to end the march toward partisan polarization.” The column also ran in The Mercury News.\n\nLike Sisters\n\nLifelong friends and alums Audrey Natal ’89 of Economics and Susan Balch ’87 of Urban Studies and Planning have a bond that is literally bound by blood, as Audrey donated a kidney to her dear friend Susan, despite the hundreds of miles physically separating them.\n\nJudge Orders Government to Continue Migrant Expulsions on Border\n\nThe Biden administration was blocked by a federal judge from lifting Title 42, a sweeping pandemic-related health order that has been preventing thousands of asylum seekers at the border from entering the U.S. since March 2020. Wayne Cornelius of Political Science, director emeritus of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, said to the New York Times: “The Biden administration is probably breathing a sigh of relief because they weren’t ready for the rule to be lifted.” In addition to this piece, Cornelius was also quoted in a New York Times story written before the judge’s decision.\n\nIs East Village Green Worth the Cost?\n\nThe total cost of San Diego’s East Village Green is now $79.6 million, and some are starting to wonder if the investment will pay off. James Hamilton of Economics weighs in as part of the San Diego Union-Tribune’s Econometer panel of experts, stating that the project’s price tag is troubling, especially in light of other issues: “We have more pressing priorities such as addressing the many homeless in San Diego.”\n\nUndergraduate Research Gives Rise to Doctoral Dreams\n\nA ThisWeek@UCSanDiego feature story celebrating a milestone moment for the McNair Program includes a profile of Psychology student Angela Chapman. The McNair Program helps prepare underrepresented students for enrollment in Ph.D. programs.

A national project of UC San Diego CREATE and Education Studies’ Mica Pollock, #USvsHate received entries from across the country, from elementary school to college. In their messages, young people tackled issues ranging from censorship to women’s rights to environmental injustice, with passion and clarity.\n\n2022 Chancellor’s Dissertation Medal Recipients\n\nKudos to Lauren Nippoldt of Anthropology! Nippoldt and the other recipients of this prestigious campus award are recognized for outstanding doctoral research.\n\n11th Annual UC San Diego Powwow\n\nCheck out this slideshow on the annual event to celebrate the traditions of Native American people and their culture on campus. This year’s event included a presentation of the inaugural “Wise Elder Changemaker” Award from the Life Course Scholars program, by Leslie Lewis of Urban Studies and Planning, to Randy Edmonds, founder of the Indian Human Resource Center, San Diego.\n\nAmericans See Afghan and Ukrainian Refugees Very Differently. Why?\n\nWriting in the Washington Post’s “Monkey Cage” blog, Claire Adida of Political Science and colleagues describe their recent survey experiment showing striking differences between how Americans view Afghan and Ukrainian refugees, with a lot more positive sentiment for Ukrainians. The research echoes the group’s earlier work comparing attitudes toward Christian vs. Muslim refugees from Syria. However, that isn’t to say nothing can be done. The research also suggests solutions: To help refugees integrate, Adida’s group and other researchers say, “it’s important to encourage empathy toward refugees and emphasize the host community’s commonalities with them.”\n\nIs Vladimir Putin Sunk?\n\nCoauthored by Michael McCullough of Psychology, this opinion piece in The Hill debunks the “madman theory” and suggests instead that Russian President Vladimir Putin is suffering from something “much more mundane and commonplace” – namely confirmation bias and the sunk-cost dilemma.\n\nCalifornia’s Wildfire Building Codes Make Newer Homes Less Likely to Burn\n\nMarketplace features the research of economist Judson Boomhower on the protective effects of wildfire building codes, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research. “These codes have really clear benefits in terms of improving the probability that a home will survive a wildfire,” Boomhower said. Remarkably, Boomhower’s research shows that the codes not only help newly constructed buildings to not catch flame but also older neighboring homes built pre-code. The Wall Street Journal cited the research in its story “Neighbors Take the Fight Against Fire Threats to the Next Level.”\n\nV . Ramey = No. 1\n\nEconomist Valerie Ramey has been ranked the top female economist based on publications over the last 10 years by RePEc, a go-to resource in the field of Economics. RePEc, or Research Papers in Economics, is a collaborative effort of hundreds of volunteers in 102 countries to enhance the dissemination of research in economics.\n\nTwo Factors May Keep Putin’s Finger Off the Nuclear Button\n\nErik Gartzke of Political Science, founding director of the Center for Peace and Security Studies at UC San Diego, published a piece in Business Insider (linked above) discussing the war in Ukraine and what factors may keep nuclear warfare at bay. Gartzke also published an essay in The Conversation about cyberattacks on Ukraine, which was republished by Buffalo News, ZME Science, and more. From the start of the crisis, Gartzke has been lending his expertise to numerous print and broadcast outlets, including CBS8 and Defense One, among many others.\n\nPresident Biden Announces Key Nominees\n\nPolitical Science alum Jaime Lizárraga has been nominated for Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Throughout his 31-year public service career, Lizárraga has advised Congressional leaders and heads of executive agencies on policy and legislative strategy,” the White House announcement reads. Lizárraga’s nomination was featured in the Bloomberg and Reuters newswires, as well as on Politico.\n\nNSF Early CAREER Award\n\nKudos to Sherice Clarke of Education Studies, who has been selected by the National Science Foundation for a prestigious and highly competitive Early CAREER Award. Clarke’s project, “Designing teacher professional development to leverage the brilliance of learners of color,” is a five-year research-practice partnership in collaboration with a school district that serves a 75% minoritized student body. The project starts with this premise: “Students of color must have access to robust and meaningful opportunities to learn science in classrooms that center their assets and humanity.”\n\nWilliam T. Grant Scholars Class of 2027\n\nTheresa Stewart-Ambo of Education Studies is one of five early-career researchers selected for the William T. Grant Scholars Class of 2027. The program “supports the professional development of promising researchers in the social, behavioral and health sciences who have received their terminal degrees within the past seven years.” Stewart-Ambo’s five-year research project will explore the relationship between the educational outcomes of American Indian youth and Native nation-building and how higher education can fortify Indigenous futures.\n\nIndigenous Futures Institute Receives Grant from Lumina Foundation\n\nAn innovative, interdisciplinary community-action research incubator at UC San Diego is now further empowered to continue its work in educational, scientific and environmental co-design with Indigenous peoples. The Indigenous Futures Institute (IFI) has received a $400,000 grant from Lumina Foundation’s Racial Justice and Equity Fund. Theresa Stewart Ambo (Tongva/Luiseño) of Education Studies co-founded the IFI with Keolu Fox (Kānaka Maoli) of Anthropology and Wayne Yang of Ethnic Studies, who is also provost of Muir.\n\nUC San Diego Honors 2022 Integrity Champions\n\nThis year’s integrity champions include Jade d’Alpoim Guedes of Anthropology and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, who came forward with evidence of sexual harassment by a Harvard professor. “Our community of trust depends on the integrity of everyone,” said Guedes. “A ‘leaky pipeline’ has forced generations of women and minoritized communities to leave academia because there are too few inroads to remove racial, gender and sexual violence perpetrators. We can only change this when we end the culture of silence that allows perpetrators to operate. My story is one of ending this culture of silence.”\n\nLinguistics Undergrad Wins Boren Scholarship\n\nBridget Egan, a Linguistics and Machine Learning double major at UC San Diego, has won a Boren Scholarship for 2022-23, a prestigious award from the U.S. Department of Defense. The scholarship provides up to $25,000 to support a U.S. student who wants to study abroad for a year, with special emphasis on learning or improving their knowledge of a foreign language.\n\nAfrican Refugees See Racial Bias as US Welcomes Ukrainians\n\nTom Wong of Political Science, founding director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Center, weighed in with VOA News: “The U.S. has responded without hesitation by extending humanitarian protections to predominantly white and European refugees,” Wong said. “All the while, predominantly people of color from Africa, the Middle East, and Asia continue to languish.”\n\nThe Resilience of State and Local Government Budgets in the Pandemic\n\nJeffrey Clemens of Economics recently published an Econofact memo describing his research on the unexpected stability of state and local governments’ budgets during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Predictions from the pandemic’s early days were dire. By the spring of 2021, however, many states were awash with surplus cash,” Clemens writes. Read on for Clemens’ analysis of why and what this means going forward.\n\nBrain Scans May Reveal a Lot About Mental Illness, But Not Until Studies Get Bigger\n\nTo really get insights into intelligence or anxiety and depression, NPR reports, brain scan studies may require thousands of scans. The ABCD Study, the National Institutes of Health study on adolescent brain development, for example, has enrolled more than 11,000 young people. The study’s large size is, in part, an effort to address the problems found in smaller studies, said one of the study’s principal investigators, Terry Jernigan of Cognitive Science. But it’s not enough to be big. Studies must also be more diverse than they typically have been, Jernigan said: \"You want to know to what extent your observations are generalizable to all the groups in our society.”\n\nHere Are the 28 Andrew Carnegie Fellows for 2022\n\nForbes: The Carnegie Corporation of New York announced the 2022 class of Andrew Carnegie Fellows. Among the new fellows is Judson Boomhower of Economics. Boomhower’s project, “Learning about Climate Risk and Adaptation from Catastrophic Wildfires,” will document lessons for successful adaptation. More on the Carnegie website.\n\nWith ARPA Funds, Newfane Considers Infrastructure Improvements\n\nNewfane, Vt. is set on getting the best bang for their buck with $400,936 from ARPA funds. In the Brattleboro (Vt) Reformer, Juli Beth Hinds of Urban Studies and Planning weighs in on the potential infrastructure upgrade of a new wastewater system for the town. “...the good news is that we really do have a bigger suite of solutions and financing options than we did even five, six years ago,” Hinds said.\n\nKatzin Prize Recipients 2022\n\nRound 2: Coryna Ogunseitan of Anthropology and Zaiyao Zhang of Psychology are among the prospective doctoral students that have been selected for the prestigious Katzin Prize, which is reserved for “a select group of scholars, demonstrating outstanding talent and promise.”\n\nFirst ‘Wise Elder Changemaker’ Awards Celebrate San Diegans Age 65+\n\nBorn out of a desire to highlight the life work and current accomplishments of San Diegans 65 years and older “who have had a significant impact on people, land, communities and movements for change across our region,” the inaugural awards recognize change-making work that ranges from food justice to housing advocacy, from the arts to gender and racial equity, to community healing. Nominations for the award were solicited and then selected by students in the Life Course Scholars Program. Now in its seventh year, the LCS program is co-directed by Anthropology doctoral alum and Urban Studies and Planning continuing lecturer Leslie Lewis. The program brings together UC San Diego students with elders in the region for project-based learning in order to design communities that are accessible and friendly to all ages.\n\nSoaring Energy Costs Fuel Fastest Inflation in 40 Years: 3 Essential Reads\n\nA round-up of “essential reads” by The Conversation includes a piece by Economics doctoral candidate Jacob Orchard on how Americans with the lowest incomes are being hit much harder by inflation than the richest Americans. This gap is explained by something known as inflation inequality: The poorest spend a lot more of their incomes on energy and food, which are the categories climbing the most right now.\n\nVideos Now Available of 2021 Revelle Medal Winners\n\nDick Attiyeh of Economics and Wayne A. Cornelius of Political Science were each honored with a 2021 Revelle Medal, which recognizes sustained, distinguished and extraordinary service to the campus. You can now watch the videos celebrating Attiyeh and Cornelius on YouTube.\n\nDid Biden Make the Right Call Extending the Student Loan Payment Moratorium?\n\nThe Biden administration has extended a moratorium on student loan payments through August in an effort to aid households in stretching their budgets. However, economists have criticized the extension because of its potential to add to the already rising inflation. James Hamilton of Economics responds to the situation in the San Diego Union-Tribune, stating “We need to change to an honest accounting system that’s fully funded with tax dollars. But getting there requires political compromise and courage, which are lacking in Washington, D.C., these days. So for now, extending the moratorium will have to do.”\n\nCOVID: Have We Reached the End For Vaccine Mandates?\n\nPolicymakers aren’t junking mandates entirely but they certainly don’t seem to be as popular as they had been earlier. Thad Kousser of Political Science weighs in on the matter with the Bay Area News Group. “The political will for mandates is directly proportional to caseloads and hospitalization,” Kousser said. “Maybe this simply isn’t the time to push them.” The story was picked up by Mercury News, Press-Telegram, Redlands Daily Facts and The Press-Enterprise.\n\nSpanish Language Disinformation Crisis (video)\n\nThe San Diego Public Library, together with the National Association of HIspanic Journalists, is addressing the Spanish language disinformation crisis with a series of “Fact o Ficción” panels in local libraries. The featured panelists, in addition to journalists from Univision, CBS8 and more, include UC San Diego’s Juan Pablo Pardo-Guerra of Sociology.\n\nMeet the 2022 Alumni Award Honorees\n\nAlumni Jamie Montgomery ’81 of Political Science, Liliana Pao ’99 of Psychology and Political Science, as well as School of Global Policy and Strategy, Tanya A.

The awards celebrate the distinguished work and personal accomplishments of extraordinary alums “who are innovating new possibilities around the globe.”\n\nCWUR: UC San Diego Among Top 10 Public Universities in U.S.\n\nThe university is once again ranked one of the top 10 public universities in the country, according to the Center for World University Rankings (CWUR). In these annual rankings, the campus placed No. 8 among public U.S. universities and No. 22 among all universities nationwide.\n\nSupreme Court Hears ‘Remain in Mexico’ Repeal Case\n\nAhead of a Supreme Court hearing to repeal the \"Migrant Protection Protocols\" (MPP), the Trump-era policy better known as “Remain in Mexico,” ABC News cited a 2019 UC San Diego report of more than 600 asylum seekers subjected to the MPP program, which found about a quarter of them reported receiving violent threats, about half of which resulted in physical violence, beatings and robbery. The report was led by Tom Wong of Political Science and the U.S. Immigration Policy Center.\n\nThe Trump Baby Bump Among Republicans After the 2016 Election\n\nResearch suggests that Republicans’ increased economic optimism during the Trump presidency may have motivated them to have more children, compared to Democrats. The study, to be published by American Economic Review: Insights, is co-authored by Gordon Dahl of Economics, with William Mullins of the Rady School and Runjing Lu, a doctoral alum of Economics now at the University of Alberta. It is the first study to establish a link between a presidential election and the birth rates of politically aligned groups, documenting a partisan shift that amounts to between 1 and 2% of the national birth rate. That’s a seismic shift, “equivalent to changes in birth rates that occur after economic shocks or in response to policies designed to affect birth rates,” Dahl said. Covering the study were KPBS and many others, including this CBS8 news segment in which Dahl, Mullins and Lu were able to appear together.\n\nKavli Foundation Donates $5M to UC San Diego Brain and Cognition Research\n\nMatching funds from The Kavli Foundation, paired with private gifts from generous donors, support the Kavli Institute for Brain and Mind, which was co-founded by the late Social Sciences Dean Jeff Elman of Cognitive Science. The story includes mention of KIBM-supported research by Tim Gentner of Psychology, being conducted in partnership with a Jacobs Engineering colleague, as well as the establishment of the Elman Chancellor’s Endowed Chair in Cognitive Science, and more.\n\nEducate to Indoctrinate: Education Systems Were First Designed to Suppress Dissent\n\nNew research by Agustina Paglayan of Political Science and the School of Global Policy and Strategy explores the origins of state-funded schools across 40 different countries. Public primary schools were created by states to reinforce obedience among the masses and maintain social order, rather than serve as a tool for upward social mobility, suggests the study published in American Political Science Review. “The key prediction of the research,” Paglayan said, “is that when there are periods of internal conflict, states will introduce education reform that is designed to indoctrinate people to accept the status quo.”\n\nOil And Gas Prices Are ‘a Drag on the Economy’ But Won't Trigger Recession: Expert\n\nJames Hamilton of Economics joined Yahoo Finance Live to “discuss how rising oil and gas prices amid COVID-19 lockdowns in China and the Russia-Ukraine war could affect the U.S. economy.”\n\nWhy It's So Difficult to Assess Pandemic Risks Right Now\n\nIt can be difficult to translate small risks around COVID-19 into behavioral changes, experts say. The decisions we make – Will I fly to that wedding? Should I eat at an indoor restaurant? – tend to be yes-or-no choices, not behaviors we can modify by, say, 10 percent, Craig McKenzie of Psychology said to the New York Times. So we’re all searching for a threshold at which we can stop adjusting our behaviors to avoid COVID, he said. And some people may already feel they have reached that place.\n\nProtesters Shouldn’t Have to Pay a High Price for Lawmakers to Care\n\nLaGina Gause of Political Science published an op-ed in the San Diego Union-Tribune on the subject of her new book, “The Advantage of Disadvantage,” addressing why “costly protests” – which involve protestors suffering physical harm, monetary losses or other losses – are more effective in gaining legislative support. Gause elaborates on why Black people are both more likely to experience the costs of protest and see legislative support for their efforts.\n\nMayor Gloria Honors Influential 'Women of Distinction' in San Diego\n\nSan Diego Mayor Todd Gloria and the City Council recognized, for the first time, 10 San Diego Women of Distinction. Fonna Forman of Political Science and the Center on Global Justice was recognized for her impressive accomplishments and her passion for her work on climate justice, equitable urban development and border ethics. “These highly accomplished leaders,” Mayor Gloria said, “have helped move our city forward and make it better for all of us.” The honor was covered by the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nThe Misuse of Race in The Search For Disease-Causing Alleles\n\nAmy Non of Anthropology co-authored a commentary in the Lancet highlighting “how theories and beliefs about a biological meaning of race have engendered dangerous misconceptions with implications for disease treatment, research and policy.”\n\nU.S. News Names UC San Diego Graduate Programs Among Top in Nation\n\nThe campus is now ranked No. 1 for doctoral students studying behavioral neuroscience, up three places since it was last ranked in 2017. According to the 2023 Best Graduate Schools rankings from U.S. News & World Report, other fields in the Social Sciences also earning top-20 spots in the nation are: econometrics (7), psychology (12), public finance (14), development economics (11), economics (14),"
