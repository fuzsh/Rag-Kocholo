Pollock Family

This website is concerned with the origins and descendants of Alexander Pollock (1841-1915) and his wife Mary Jane Kilpatrick (1848-1924) from Liskeran Hill, Donegal, Ireland. They married at Stranorlar, 12 April 1870 and five weeks later emigrated to Australia. His father was Samuel Pollock. His mother was Jane Thompson and his grand-father is likely to be one of the Pollocks mentioned below in the Spinning Wheel list. See the Kilpatrick file for Mary Jane antecedents

Alexander & Mary Jane Pollock were Ulster Scots farmers who disembarked in Brisbane (Moreton Bay) on the evening of 24 August 1870, on the Young Australia, after departing from Gravesend (London) on 17 May. They travelled in steerage. The ship carried 238 passengers, mostly English but with 28 Irish. [Note: The Young Australia sunk on a return voyage in 1872].

Alexander Pollock worked on a property for a Mr. Barton in Queensland for about 9 months and then moved to northern Victoria, where Kilpatrick relatives were already living. Their first child was born at Dargalong (near Tabilk and Nagambie) in 1872.

In August 1873 they were granted 320 acres of land at Taripta, between Kyabram and Mooroopna. The farm can be located just outside the current urban area of Kyabram. Taripta was later known as Wyuna. They raised five sons in thirty years of farming at Taripta. In about 1903 Alex and Mary moved with four of their five sons, as well as many neighbours, to newly opened wheat and sheep farming country near Balldale in the southern Riverina. Alex Junior remained at Taripta until the property was sold to Michael Malone in 1915 for £3,329. Alexander Pollock (Sr) died the same year, aged 74 at Balldale on the 16 November 1915. Buried at Hopefield Cemetery, he was described in the Corowa Free Press as “one of the oldest settlers of Balldale”. The value of the Balldale property at probate was £5,684.

Mary Jane Pollock raised five of the eight children born to her – two girls and a boy died as infants. She died at Balldale aged 76 on the 16 September 1924. She is also buried at Hopefield.

The five sons all had large families – producing 42 children (an average of more than eight each) – 39 of whom lived to adulthood. These 39 grandchilden of Alex and Mary Jane produced 106 great-grandchildren (plus two adopted). These grand-children of Matt Pollock of Yerong Creek numbered 40, George Pollock of Tallimba 31, Alex Pollock of Wahgunyah 22, Tom Pollock of Quandialla 13, and Robert Pollock of Balldale 2. It is likely that the next two generations has now pushed the number of descendants well above two hundred.

Origin of the Pollocks

Pollock is of Scottish origin, and comes from lands of that name in what was Renfrewshire, around the present city of Paisley, which is a few miles south-west of Glasgow. Pollok, Pollockshields and Pollokshaws are all today suburbs of Glasgow, and Pollock Park is a significant green space.

Many Scots farmers, particularly from south-western areas of Scotland close to Ulster, emigrated to the northern parts of Ireland in the 1600s and 1700s as part of the Cromwellian plantation of the Catholic lands.

A large number of these Ulster-Scots re-emigrated to the United States. There the name was often changed to Polk. The llth U.S. president James Polk was the descendant of Ulster-Scot emigrant Robert Pollock.

1. Pollocks In Ireland

1700s

According to the late Jim Pollock of Tivickmoy (or Teevickmoy), Donegal, Ireland, two Pollock brothers came over from Scotland in the early 1700s. They settled on adjacent land, one in the Liskeran (pronounced Les-cairn) locality and the other in Meenavoy. These farms were just north of the town of Stranorlar (pronounced Stran-lah) in south east Donegal. All the Pollocks from this area are likely to be descendants of these brothers.

Stranorlar and Ballbofey are twin towns on opposite sites of the Finn River. Liskeran, Tivickmoy and Meenavoy are farming localities in the hills to the north of the towns. The Finn Valley was settled by Scottish and English settlers as part of the Plantation of Ulster, in the aftermath of Cromwell. Jim Pollock claims that the English got the best land along the river while the Scots received the hill land. Stranorlar was chosen as a Plantation frontier post in the Plantation.

Some Research Notes: According to the Index of Wills for Raphoe Barony, Donegal, a George Pollock died at Ballbofey in 1783, a William Pollock in Minavoy (now spelt Meenavoy) in 1788, as well as a John Poak at Minavoy in 1777, and a John Poag in Stranorlar parish in 1737 . There is also a listing of a John Poak and Robert Poak in the 1665 Hearth Money roll for Raphoe. We know that Polk became a popular varient of Pollock in the US. Perhaps Poak and Poag are also spelling variants.

According to the 1796 Spinning Wheel Premium Entitlements List – there were at least these Pollocks farming in the area towards the end of the 18th century – :

Pollock, David – Stranorlar

Pollock, James – Stranorlar

Pollock, James, Jr. – Stranorlar

Pollock, John – Stranorlar

Pollock, Joseph – Donaghmore

Pollock, Richard – Stranorlar

Pollock, Robert – Stranorlar

Pollock, Samuel – Raphoe

Pollock, Samuel – Stranorlar

Samuel Pollock Family in Donegal

Alexander Pollock’s father, Samuel Pollock married Jane Thompson. The Irish land records of 1857 list both Samuel Pollock and James Pollock as holding land at Liskeran. Samuel held 75 acres leased from a George Wilson, rateable .

According to the earlier 1830 Tithe Applotment Survey, Samuel & James Pollock had a 173 acre block at Liskeran. While this was very large for the times, a modest 14 acres were listed as arable.

Court records indicate that Samuel Pollock of Liskeran was still alive in 1864. One of the following Samuel Pollocks who died in the Stranorlar district may match: (1) born 1800 who died in the October-December quarter of 1882, aged 82: (2) 1796-1866, aged 70. A Jane Pollock 1816-1871, died in the Stranolar district aged 55.

The children of Samuel Pollock and Jane Thompson are thought to include:

Sarah Pollock daughter of Samuel Pollock married John Pollock (son of James Pollock farmer) of Meenavoy at Stranorlar on 15 May 1854.

Jenny Pollock: baptised 24 May 1837

Mary Pollock: baptised 17 May 1839 at the Stranorlar Presbyterian Church

Alexander Pollock: born at Liskeran 1841; baptised 12 Nov 1841. He emigrated to Australia in 1870.

James Steele Pollock: baptised 18 May 1844. Went to America?

Robert Pollock : he had a son Alexander Pollock who was father of the last Pollocks at Liskeran (Tille & Robert) who remained there unmarried until they passed away in about 2000.

Possibly another son Samuel? who went to America? There was a marriage at Stranorlar 16 January 1855 of Samuel Pollock, son of Samuel Pollock of Finnidurk (who died August 27 1855), to Eliza Bell of Dinwiley.

There was also a marriage of Jane Pollock, daughter of Samuel Pollock of Liskeran to Alexander McNeal of Mobuoy, Faughanvale on 21 December 1864 at Stranorlar.

In the 1980s the Robert & Tillie Pollock of Liskeran, reported to Jim Pollock of Meenavoy that their grandfather, Robert Pollock, had three brothers, two went to America – their names may have been James Steele Pollock & Samuel Pollock – and one, Alexander who went to Australia. Bachelor and spinster, Robert & Tillie died around the year 2000 resulting in our line of the name Pollock finishing their history in Donegal.

1900s

Liskeran Pollocks after 1871.

The remaining Liskeran Pollocks are from the family of Robert Pollock, brother of Alexander.

The 1901 census shows the following Pollocks at No.9 Liskeran:

Robert Pollock – farmer aged 66

Margaret Pollock – wife aged 54

R. James Pollock – unmarried farmer and son, aged 25

Alexander Pollock – unmarried farmer and son, aged 24. Known as Sandy he married Margaret Ann Bell (of Fern) – daughter of John Bell, farmer, on 11 November 1902 at the Stranorlar Presbyterian Church.

Andrew Jack – student, nephew aged 13

Mary McGarvey – servant (Roman Catholic), aged 25.

The 1911 census shows the family of Sandy Pollock living at No. 5 Liskeran:

Alexander Pollock, aged 30, farmer

Margaret, wife aged 29.

Maggie, aged 7

Lillie, aged 5

Jane Elizabeth, aged 3

Annie, infant aged less than 1

Bernard McCauley. Aged 16, servant (Roman Catholic)

Note that the family was Church of Ireland, not Presbyterian.

According to Jim Pollock of Meenavoy sandy and Margaret’s children included:

Margaret – who lived at Liskeran.

Lilly – she married a man by the name of Dunlop and moved to Castledawson in the Londonderry county of Northern Ireland.

Tillie – worked in (London)Derry in catering. Didn’t marry. Born about 1909. [perhaps proper name Jane Elizabeth].

Annie – who moved to Newry, Armagh, Northern Ireland; and married a Mr Draffin.

Robert – who was a farmer. Born about 1913. He never married.

Ernest – A farmer in Liskeran; later lived in England; but returned later in life to live on the farm with Robert.

Samuel – he died of cancer when 50 or 60, had a shop in Ballybofey, married a Miss Pepper.

Norman – the youngest and a Liskeran farmer; died in his 40s from lung cancer.

The 1936/37 Electors List gives the following Pollocks at Liskeran – Alexander; Maggie; Annie & Robert

The children had an uncle Robert who lived at Dunwiley, between Liskeran & Stranorlar. Robert’s son Samuel farmed at Dunwiley until 1955 when he sold up and went to the North. Robert Pollock of Dunwiley had two grandsons who lived in Melbourne, Ivan and Malcolm.

Robert Pollock, the last of our direct line of Pollocks to remain in Ireland died in about the 2000, aged 87. His obituary states that he was a well known breeder of Clydesdale & Irish draft horses. He is buried in the family burial ground at Stranorlar – service conducted at the Stranorlar Presbyterian Church. He was survived by a sister-in-law Berta Pollock in Limavady.

2. Kilpatricks In Ireland

Mary Jane Kilpatrick was born at Teevickmoy, two miles from Liskeran in 1848. Her parents were George Kilpatrick, a farmer and Janet Fairman. Her brother Thomas Kilpatrick preceded her in emigrating to Australia, while her parents and many other relatives also moved from Donegal to northern Victoria in the 1870s.

The name Kilpatrick is Scottish in origin, meaning church of Patrick. It is not possible to trace it to a particular location because the same name was used for different places. According to Jim Pollock in Ireland, the Kilpatricks of Teevickmoy had all deceased ‘about 70years ago’.

See the Kilpatrick file for more information

3. Other Pollocks Who Came To Australia

At least one of the Pollocks from the Finn Valley, John Pollock from Meenavoy, had emigrated to Australia before Alexander. John Pollock (c.1843-25 Sep 1922) and wife Letitia (Lettie) Jane Dinsmore/Densmore (c1848-3 Nov 1933) came to Australia in 1869 aged 22 and 20. Photos of John Pollock and Letitia Densmore.

John Pollock’s father, James Pollock (1816 or 1820-1906) is thought to be Samuel Pollock’s cousin. James Pollock also married a Kilpatrick – Matilda Atchison Kilpatrick (1829-1874). They were from Meenavoy.

John and Letitia sailed from Plymouth 2 Jul 1869 and arrived in Brisbane 25 Sep 1869 on the Royal Dane. According to Helen O’Brien “When they first arrived in Brisbane, John and Letitia lived at Oxley Creek, then in Margaret Street, Brisbane, then they moved to Beaudesert. They farmed at Beaudesert and moved to the Bundaberg area around 1894. They lived at Yandalan near Bundaberg and by 1903 at nearby Bucca Farm, North Kolan. Many of their descendants still live in the Bundaberg area. Their family consisted of 8 boys and 5 girls. The children seem to be:

Letitia Jane Pollock (1870-1964). Born 27 May 1870 at Beaudesert, she married Henry Thomas Read (1857-1922) in 1891. In 1913 they farmed at Pinelands, Widgee Creek, south of Beaudesert.

He lived for a while near Bundaberg but seemed to have moved back to the Beaudesert area to take care of his mother after his father died in 1922; Ivy Irene Read (1906) (She may have married a Mr J.C. Lang); Letitia Florence Read (1910) (She may have married a Mr T Darlington). Henry Thomas Reid was born 26 Jan 1857 in Somerset and died 19 July 1922. After Henry Thomas Read died in 1922, Letitia Jane lived at Rathdowney near Beaudesert but sometime after the war moved to Coal Street Redbank. She died at Ipswich 10 August 1964

Matilda Pollock (1873-1953). She married George William Richard Godden (1862-1935) in 1894. Children included: John Richard Godden (1896-1963); Emily Alice Godden (1898-1898); Ann Elizabeth Godden (1899-1957); Letitia Jane Godden (1901-1967); Iris Kathleen Mary Godden (1909-1995)- she married Victor Pooler (1907-1988).

Sarah Margaret later lived in Bundaberg.

Samuel James Tait Pollock (1881-1958). In 1903 he lived at Bucca Crossing.

William John Pollock (1881-1964). In 1903 he was at Bucca Crossing. Married Anne Elizabeth Larder in 1907. In 1913 labourer at Bucca. They had a daughter Letitia Jane Pollock who married Mervyn George Howard in 1933, and died 1983.

George Alexander Pollock (26 May 1883-28 Dec 1949). He was at Bucca Crossing until at least WW1. He enlisted in 1917 and was single then. He later married Alice Catherine English (1895-1960). In 1925 he is listed as a postman of Oakview Farm, Yandaran Creek. In 1943 they are listed at Bungadoo, Wallaville line, where he was a farmer. He died of a snake bite near his house at Bungadoo, 20 miles from Bundaberg.

Thomas Robert Pollock (1885-1962). Up until at least 1913 he was a labourer at Bucca Crossing, North Kolan. By 1925 he moved north to farm at Mount Larcom near Glastone. He was likely single.

Albert Densmore Pollock (1887-1977). In 1913 labourer at Bucca. In 1925 married May Moore. He also moved north to farm at Mount Larcom. The farm name was Bracewell. Possible children include Alan Robert Pollock; Garnet William John Pollock; Iris Pollock; Reginald Albert Pollock.

Catherine Mary Pollock (1889-1946). Married Thomas Ernest Graham (1892-1977) in 1916. They lived at Bracewell near Mount Larcom. Catherine was born a redhead – inherited from her mother Letitia, and passed down through the generations. A family story says that while heavily pregnant with her third son, Catherine drove herself and two eldest sons in a horse and cart to their new home in Mt Larcom. Catherine and Thomas Graham had a bit of everything on their property at Mt Larcom – cotton, corn, beans, pumpkins, tomatoes and pigs, chickens and dairy cattle. Their children were: Harold John Graham (1917-1978); George Alexander Thomas Graham (1918-1943); Eugene Vivian Graham (1920-1989); William Andrew Graham (1922-abt 2007); Gordon Douglas Graham (1925-2003); Dulcie Letitia Graham (1927-2005); and Keith Robert Graham (1930-1995)

At least eight of the above lived much of their lives in or around Bundaberg. Three moved north to Mount Larcom near Gladstone.

Some of the siblings of John Pollock also emigrated to Australia. His brothers and sisters seemed to include:

James Pollock (1849-?). He stayed in Ireland, marrying Esther Pollock (same surname) in 1875. They lived at Meenavoy. There children included: David Pollock (1876-1964); Matilda Pollock (1878-1930); Margaret Jane Pollock (1881-?); James Pollock (1883-1918); Esther Smiley Pollock (1885-1968); and John Tait Pollock (1887-?).

Note: In 1892 it was reported that a James Pollock residing at Taripta and aged about 40 was sent to the lunatic asylum – http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article270008927. His connection, if any, is unknown.

The Pollocks Move to Balldale

In 1903 John Morrissey, a member of the Victorian parliament who lived in the Lower Goulburn Valley at Byrneside, purchased the Quat Ouatta estate. This estate on the NSW side of the Murray River between Corowa and Howlong was subdivided by Morrissey and sold to Lower Goulburn Valley farmers in 1903 and 1904.

In late 1903 a party of twelve from the Mooroopna district travelled by buggy and wagonette to inspect and most of them bought around where the village of Balldale now stands. A little later another party of Victorians, from the Yarroweyah and Boorhaman districts, bought blocks. Some of the families that bought Quat Quatta farms included:

Alex Pollock, from Taripta, near Kyabram

Mick Kavanagh, “Sunny Hill”, from Mooroopna

Thomas Wilson, “Cluster Hills”, from Mooroopna, and his brother

Mungo Wilson, “Kavason”, from Mooroopna

Martin Brothers (Alex and Robert), “Errol”, from Mooroopna

Breen Brothers (J.M. & P.P), “Gelburnie” and “New Park”, from Yarroweyah

Alexander Pollock’s homestead at Sunny Hill farm, was located 3 miles southwest of Balldale. His sons, the five Pollock brothers, all lived in the Balldale area. Their father’s left a sizeable estate when he died in 1915, including £5684 worth of land at Balldale and £3320 owed by Michael Malone for purchase of 320 acres Alexander sold around 1915 at Taripta. His will. The sons gradually moved away to develop their own farms, until in the late 1930s there were no Pollocks left in Balldale.

Find the six Pollocks

4. Mathew James Pollock (1874-1950)

Mat Pollock, the oldest son, married Mary Ann Harris on 6 March 1901 at the Presbyterian Manse, Echuca. At that time Mat was living at Taripta (as were his parents) and Mary Ann at Kyabram. Mary Ann was one of 13 children born to Stephen Harris, a farmer and Emma Crossman, both originally from Huish Episcopi in Somerset, England.

For three years Mat and Mary Ann farmed at Taripta and their first three children were born at Kyabram. Between 1904 and 1906 they moved to Balldale where they farmed at “Cloverdale”, a 666 acre property, for 21 years and where their other eight children were born. In 1927 they moved to “Dewdrop”, a farm of 1142 acres near the Mittagong Church between Milbrulong and Yerong Creek. The farm entrance is still signposted some 19 kilometers west of Yerong Creek on the Urangeline Road (now know as Osborne Road). The Mittagong Football Club was formed at his house in 1932. Mary Ann died at Yerong Creek aged 63 on 7 February 1939. Mat died at Yerong Creek on 13 September 1950 aged 76. In recollections Mary was described as “inclined to be robust, with a round happy face. She was a jolly person, but Mat was rather grave”. There is a plaque at the Mittagong Church (about 11 kilometres south of Milbrulong) ‘in memory of Mary Ann & Mathew J. Pollock, presented by their family’.

Their children were:

4.1 Thomas George Pollock (1901-1983)

Born 23 December 1901. Tom did not marry and farmed at the Yerong Creek “Dewdrop” farm. From the 1960s he resided at the Mayday Hills Asylum at Beechworth. Tom died on the 15 July 1983 and is buried at Yerong Creek.

4.2 Emma Mary Pollock (Taylor) (1903-1991)

Born 26 August 1903 she married Alfred Taylor (21 March 1905 – 20 January 1991) in 1932. Alfred’s father William Taylor had a 1192 acre farm, ‘Allambie’, off Iletts Lane in the Wrathall area near Yerong Creek – but I think Alfed and Emma moved to their own farm ‘Hopefield’ at Yerong Creek about 1936. They had four children, Alan Alfred (1934) who farmed ‘Allambie East’ and married Heather Mary Rodgers in 1965, Raymond John (21 August 1935 – 30 June 2013) who also farmed ‘Allambie’ and married Janet Dorothy Holt in 1956, Rita Elizabeth (1937), and Donald Matthew (1938 – 1964). Emma died soon after Alfred in 1 June 1991. Alfred, Emma, Ray and Don are all buried at Yerong Creek.

4.3 Matthew William Pollock (1904-1987)

Born 6 Oct 1904 [although his grave indicates a 1906 birth]. He married Amy Laura Steenholdt (1898-1979) on 22 March 1932 in Wagga. Amy’s parents Hans Thiesen (H.T.) Steenholdt and Isabella Mabel O’Meara came from Euroa, Victoria to be neighbours of the Pollocks. They had a 686 acre farm named “Fairdale”. Matt and Amy farmed ‘Rossdale’ off Read’s Lane, Milbrulong. They had a single child, Amy Wilma Pollock (23 July 1933) who died as an infant. Matt was a committee member of Osborne Football Club and designed its recreational hall and supervised the building work. He died on 16 May 1987 and is buried in Lockhart cemetery.
