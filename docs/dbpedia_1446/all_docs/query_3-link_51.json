You must pay for parking in these areas and you cannot feed the meter.\n\nOutside of a meter district:\n\nOutside of the meter district or in parts of the Central Eastside you will see signs like this.

Unless you have a residential, visitor, or business permit for that zone you must move your car out of the zone by the end of the posted timestay.\n\nHow do truck loading zones work?\n\nWhy does Portland have truck loading zones? These zones are for commercial vehicles with signage to use for loading and unloading purposes only. Commercial vehicles are limited to 30 minutes. Each location is designed to meet the needs of the surrounding businesses.\n\nWhat if you are a customer wanting to park here? Each location is signed with the enforcement hours for the truck loading zone. If you park during these hours you may receive a citation and have your vehicle towed.
