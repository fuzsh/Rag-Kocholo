        "text": "Municipal Sanitation collection began in 1921. Garbage collection was provided by Clarence Williams (who headed the Village Highway Department) and Lewis Brothers, which was a private carting company. Approximately, 2,290 Freeport homes were visited each week for pickup. Originally, three trucks were used to gather Freeport's refuse. Homeowners were required to comply with eight rules and regulations: 1. Collections will be made each week. 2. Garbage includes ashes and household refuse. 3. No receptacle shall be over three cubic feet in capacity. 4. All receptacles should be placed near rear or side of house. 5. No garbage receptacles should be placed on the street or sidewalk. 6. Receptacles shall be limited to two to each family. 7. Garbage will not be removed from cellars or outhouses. 8. All receptacles shall be covered.\n\nBefore 1921, homeowners and businesses hired private companies to remove garbage and ashes, as well as clean cesspools. Local carting companies included the Cosmopolitan Sanitary Co., located on Main Street and scavenger companies run by Moses Jarvis and Frank LaFata. In 1907, these private carters were required to be licensed with Town of Hempstead Board of Health. To keep the public from dumping refuse in the street, Freeport passed Village Ordinance No. 9 which made it unlawful \"to throw, place or deposit any coal ashes, stone, rubbish, paper, garbage, tin cans, or refuse matter upon any road, avenue, lane or street in the Village of Freeport.\" In 1909, Henry E. Ryder was appointed inspector to enforce compliance with Village Ordinance No. 9.\n\nIn 1907, the local board of health licensed Rural Sanitation Co. to remove refuse and ashes from the Freeport public school, local fire houses, and village offices. In some cases, ash and other refuse was used as landfill. In 1916, the Board of Health approved the use of a swamp behind the home of A.G. Henderson, located at the corner of North Main Street and Grand Avenue, to dump ashes and cans. Throughout Freeport and the surrounding areas, dumping grounds were established. In 1914, an acre of land owned by Charles Abrams in Roosevelt was leased by the Village of Freeport as a dump. Another dumping area was located on East Merrick Road. In the 1970s, a homeowner on Hampton Place found a long-buried trash dump on his property which contained 470 bottles, one of which dated back to 1874.\n\nThe Village began discussing the construction of a municipal incinerator in 1924. The following year, the State Division of Sanitation recommended that the village close the dump on East Merrick Road and build an incinerator to handle the disposal of trash. In 1926, the Village purchased three acres of land on Merrick Road to build an incinerator for garbage.\n\nIn 1972, the Village of Freeport along with the Freeport Commission for the Conservation of the Environment sponsored a pilot project for the voluntary recycling of newspapers. Homeowners were encouraged to leave newspapers at curbside on scheduled days for pickup. This program was canceled in December 1974 and a newspaper dumpster was installed on Ocean Avenue and Sunrise Highway. Due to the cost and complaints about the unsightly conditions of the receptacle, the dumpster was removed in June of 1975.\n\nFreeport gave up its municipal sanitation service in 1979 when it contracted with Five Counties Carting Corp. There was a public outcry in September 1986 when the board voted to end rear yard pickup (except if the homeowner was willing to pay $10 per month for this service). The board reversed its decision on rear yard collection the following December. Rear yard pickup officially ended when curbside collection began on February 29, 1988. Recycling began on a voluntary basis on June 1, 1988. To encourage residents to recycle, containers for newspapers, glass bottles, and metal cans were placed at the Village Transfer Station at 175 Albany Avenue. Mandatory newspaper recycling went into effect on January 1, 1989. The Village's Transfer Station ceased public operation on February 10, 1990. Materials that were excluded from curbside pickup were permitted to be brought to the Town of Hempstead Transfer Station located at 1600 Merrick Road, Merrick.\n\nClick here for images related to Freeport Municipal Sanitation.\n\nSee Also:\n\nFreeport Incinerator\n\nJarvis, Moses\n\nSources:\n\n\"Board Approves Mandatory Newspaper Recycling Evening Commercial Pickup.\" The Leader.

He father was a commissioner of the Department of Corrections and Charities for the City of New York.\n\nScholey moved to the village when her husband, Reverend Charles Herbert Scholey, accepted the post as pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Freeport. After her husband’s death in 1911, Scholey became more involved in civic activities. In 1921, Scholey became the wife of Irving Gatter, a partner in the real estate firm, Gatter and Sons.\n\nIn 1918, along with Anne Raymore, Scholey was appointed as a police officer to aid in enforcing a curfew ordinance which had been passed by the Freeport Board of Trustees. She was also appointed as a deputy sheriff. In addition, Scholey was a member of the Neighborhood Workers of Freeport as a social worker.\n\nScholey was later hired under Daniel Morrison, Town of Hempstead (some sources say Nassau County) overseer to the poor as well as a former Freeport president, in 1919 to work in the Welfare Department to place homeless children in foster homes, and rose to the position of Assistant to the Overseer of the Poor. Upon Morrison’s death in 1923, she served unofficially as the overseer until a replacement was named. Later, she was charged with the responsibility of arranging hospital care for Nassau County residents who were on welfare. She served as a delegate to the New York State Republican Convention; reportedly, in 1921, she was the only woman to serve in that capacity.\n\nScholey retired from this work in 1937 after a bad fall adversely affected her ability to get around. After her retirement, she increased her involvement in the Salvation Army, for which she had previously served as treasurer, and the Freeport Women’s Christian Temperance Union.\n\nThe Scholeys had one child, a daughter named Edith, who later made her home on East Avenue in Freeport with her husband, John Armstrong. Scholey passed away in 1959; she was buried in Flushing Cemetery in Queens County, NY.\n\nSources:\n\n“No Overseer To Be Named By Town Board.” Daily Review. June 23, 1923, 1.

The island is located on the Atlantic Ocean and Swift Creek, between Freeport and Point Lookout. \"Uncle\" Dick Smith purchased a house on the island from John C. Raynor and began a hotel business with his wife, Mary Ann. The hotel was later operated by their daughter, Mary Elizabeth, and her husband, Andrew J. Scott.\n\nIt is said that Uncle Dick was the first to plant oysters in the South Bay in an area known as \"Trump's Hole.\" In addition to the 20-room hotel built by Smith, his daughter also built a cottage. Other residents included T. P. Elderd of Hempstead and Adam Pfleging of Garden City. Also on the Island, were the Prospect Gun Club (run by Captain Abe Smith, son of Dick Smith) and the Point Comfort Hotel.\n\nBy 1903, the Long Beach Transportation Company established ferry service to the island.\n\nIn 1900, a survey map of Scott's Beach was completed that included 800 proposed plots. However, they were not advertised for sale until 1913. Alvin G. Smith, the original surveyor of this development, wrote a letter in 1913 to E. A. Dorlon, the auctioneer, regarding the sale of the plots. He pointed out that a number of sections (blocks 7 to 10 inclusively) had been lost in storms since his 1900 evaluation of the land and rendering of same.\n\nConstruction of a deep water canal across the island was slated to be completed in the spring of 1914. The land was never developed.\n\nClick here for images of Scott's Beach.\n\nSee Also:\n\nMeadow Island Monument\n\nNew Inlet Hotel\n\nSources:\n\n\"The Pioneer Boniface of the Old South Beach.\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

Feeney, November 27, 2016.\n\nSelnada, possibly the first deep sea party fishing boat in Freeport, was one of the best known boats along the south shore of Long Island. She was originally constructed as a sloop-rigged sailing yacht for Major J. Fred Ackerman of the Atlantic Yacht Club. Though Ackerman owned another boat named Selnada in the late 1890s, the Freeport Selnada was mostly likely built in 1903 by William P. Kirk of Toms River, NJ and designed by Henry J. Gielow. The boat was named for Ackerman's daughters, Selma, Naida, and Dagma.\n\nThe Selnada was purchased by Captain William Carman around 1908 soon after she had won a race from New York to Bermuda. Carman added a motor and a mast on the stern, In addition, a pilothouse was constructed atop the existing cabin and the bow was altered. The Selnada was approximately 70 feet long and could carry 90 fishermen.\n\nDuring her career, the Selnada was involved in a number of sea rescues. In 1910, she helped rescue six people from a 15-foot launch in heavy seas near Jones Inlet; that same year the Selnada picked up two people adrift on a disabled dory; in 1918, she rescued two aviators who crash landed three miles off of Point Lookout; in 1935, she came to the aid of the Atlantic when a rogue wave knocked a number of its passengers overboard; and in December of that year, she rescued five from a crippled craft stuck in rough seas.\n\nAfter William Carman died in 1929, his son, Mort, became the captain of the Selnada. Arthur J. Denton was the ship's first mate from 1910 until his death at the age of 60 in 1933. When Mort died in 1937, brother Leon \"Wink\" Carman, Sr. took the helm.\n\nThe Selnada met her end during the Hurricane of ‘44 when her moorings broke and she was blown onto a meadow near Sea Dog and Cinders Creeks. When 70-foot tug failed to get the Selnada off the marsh, the Camans stripped the boat and set her on fire.\n\nSee Also:\n\nCarman, William (Captain)\n\nCarman, Leon \"Wink\"\n\nSources:\n\n\"A. J.

The first mention for a planned village-wide sewer system occurred in 1909 when it was proposed by local resident George Christians. Christians, in late September 1909, organized a meeting at the Sigmond Opera House to discuss the need for a local sewer system. The meeting, which featured William Wallace Young, a New York City sanitary engineer, addressed about 75 residents. After the meeting, thirty-six taxpayers signed a petition asking for the appropriation of $1,000 to pay for a map of the proposed eight miles of sewers. When a special election was held on October 4, 1909 concerning the appropriation of money to produce a sewer map, the proposition failed. Of the 242 total votes cast, 137 were against the proposal, 106 were in favor, two ballots were blank, and one ballot was defective. Newspaper accounts of the vote made mention that women were allowed to vote in this election; Mrs. Henry C. Schluter was the first woman to cast a ballot. The engineering firm Smith & Malcomson presented a plan at for an up-to-date sewage disposal plant at a village board meeting in 1912. The $400,000 cost would be offset by an average $12 per house tax increase.\n\nIn 1916, Mayor Roland M. Lamb appointed a committee to investigate the need for sewer system in Freeport. The committee included John D. Gunning (chairman), William H. Patterson, Daniel Morrison, Alvin A. Sealey, Arthur Nosworthy, Frank H. Stevens, Werner Nygren, and Edward S. Keogh (secretary). This committee reported that Freeport had 1788 cesspools, 951 grease traps and 758 privies. Committee members presented arguments for and against the sewer system. Once again, Freeporters voted against sewers. However, they agreed to appoint a committee of 12 to pursue a study of sewer systems over a five year period.\n\nPresident (Mayor) Raymond J. Miller expressed his concerns about the lack of a sewer system during a meeting of \"First-Class Villages of New York State\" in Albany in 1924: \"Freeport is very badly in need of sewers and the proposition has been voted on several times, but has never carried. While the property owners will not vote for sewers, they seem ready and willing to vote favorably on permanent roads.\" Miller also mentioned that sewer pipes would have to be placed in the middle of the street since water mains are located on the north and west sides of streets and gas mains run on the south and east sides of streets. That same year, Freeporters rejected plans for municipal sewers for a third time.\n\nFinally, on August 24, 1926, a proposition was adopted at a special village election for the construction of part of a sewer system at the joint expense of the village (77%) and the properties that benefited from the system (23%). The cost of the system was estimated to be $585,000 and included 56,221 feet of trunk sewers and a sewage treatment plant. Nicholas S. Hill, Jr. was selected as the project engineer. Between 1927 and 1928 a pumping station, treatment plant and a portion of the trunk sewers were constructed. In 1929, the original design of Freeport sewers was revised by Baldwin & Cornelius Co., Inc. At this time, Freeport was divided into seven lateral districts.\n\nTragedy struck on August 30, 1927, when Kenneth Douglas, a sewer inspector, died of asphyxiation while inspecting a sewer line at the intersection of Sunrise Highway and Bayview Avenue. William Kamser, Douglas' assistant, was overcome by the gas as well but survived.\n\nResidents living below Atlantic Avenue relied on cesspools until the late 1940s. It is important to note that southern portion of Freeport was not part of the Incorporated Village of Freeport until 1930. By 1946, the pollution was such a problem in Freeport that the South Shore Yacht Club was unable to get a bathing permit. A referendum for the installation of a southern sewer system failed in 1947 but another referendum was passed in 1948. Those living in the southernmost sections of Freeport had to wait until the early 1950s, when the construction of pumping station was completed.\n\nIn 1979, Freeport began to connect its sewerage disposal system with that of Nassau County.\n\nClick her for images related to sewers.\n\nSee Also:\n\nGunning, John D.\n\nLamb, Roland M.\n\nMiller, Raymond J.\n\nMorrison, Daniel\n\nSouth Shore Yacht Club\n\nSources:\n\n\"Considering Sewer Plans.\" Nassau County Review.

Later, he became the first African American to be elected to the North Babylon Board of Education, which was a predominantly white district.\n\nBorn in Delaware, Shockley described himself as being the fourth generation of educators and clergy. He was in the Army during WWII, and served in Italy and North Africa. He attended Delaware State College and earned a Masters' degree from Michigan State University. Shockley was the principal of Paul Lawrence Dunbar Elementary-Junior High School in Laurel, DE. His attempts to enroll his daughter in a whites-only high school ultimately cost him his job and led him to move to Long Island in 1960. Shockley was a sixth-grade teacher in the Plainview-Old Bethpage district and became an assistant elementary school principal in Wyandanch.\n\nIn 1964, after being appointed coordinator of Nassau County's Office of Economic Opportunity, Shockley developed the county's first Head Start program.\n\nIn 1979, Shockley was able to secure $157,248 from the Office of Education to create computerized instruction programs in the Freeport School District.\n\nShockley was on the board for Hi-Hello Day Care Center. He played the organ and was a gifted tenor. It was said he travelled the world with the choirs of the United Methodist Church of Babylon and Port Jefferson. Shockley also once served as an international polling supervisor for a general election in Bosnia.\n\nShockley retired from the Freeport School District in 1985. He and his wife, Novella, had three children. Shockley died at the age of 93 in 2014.\n\nSources:\n\nAncestry.com.\n\n\"Federal Funds to Help School Computers.\" The Leader. July 26, 1979, 1.

By 1695, nearly half of the 2,100 enslav ed people in New York lived on Long Island.\n\nIn 1657, English Quaker leader George Fox began calling for the outlaw of slavery. By 1783, most Quakers on Long Island had freed their slaves. New York State began to abolish slavery in 1799. Legislation granted freedom when they reached the age of 28; female slaves were freed at the age of 25. A 1817 New York State law ended slavery 10 years later in 1827.\n\nPrimary documents about enslaved people in Freeport have yet to be uncovered. However, there is anecdotal material about slavery in what is now Freeport. In the recollections of Freeporter Daniel Tredwell, he described a family manuscript he remembers seeing as a child. The “Old Farm Diary,” as it was called by the Tredwell family, was written between 1720-1744. According to Tredwell, the manuscript mentioned the names of enslaved people who lived on his family's homestead (near Milburn Pond today). Tredwell also recalled a building on the family property that he described as the “old slave quarters.”\n\nAnother source indicating potential slavery in Freeport can be found in unpublished research by Village Historian, Clinton E. Metz. While researching a mill at the head of the Freeport River, Metz found evidence that a former owner of the mill did have slaves. Around 1780, Merrick-born Stephen Hewlett was owner of the mill and according to the 1790 census, Hewlett had eight enslaved people. However, is not known if any of these enslaved people ever worked in the Freeport mill.\n\nFreeport had at least two residents who had been formerly enslaved in the South; Sarah A Myers and Henderson McLean.\n\nSee Also:\n\nEnslaved People (Formerly)\n\nSources:\n\nGriswold, Mac K.

Bennett Smith) was born in East Rockaway. He was associated with the automobile industry in Freeport.\n\nIn the late 1890s, Smith was a competitive cyclist and competed in many events along Merrick Road. He was also president of the Freeport Bicycle Club. Smith won second prize in a one-third mile race at Madison Square Garden. Smith's interest in bicycles developed as he grew up in Bellmore. He would cycle between Bellmore and his uncle's grist mill near Wantagh, often racing the Long Island Rail Road trains. In 1895, he broke a New York State record by riding five miles in 12 minutes and 18 seconds on a six lap track at the New York Polo Grounds.\n\nIn 1896, Smith owned the Freeport Bowling Alley located at \"Van Riper's Block\" (on South Main Street, probably near Pine Street). The following year, he was sold, rented, and repaired bicycles from this location. Smith also managed the Freeport Athletic League as well as organized and managed its baseball team, which won the South Side League championship in 1904. He was able to secure the championship by convincing four players from the New York Giants, including famed pitcher Joe McGinnity, to play for Freeport.\n\nIt is believed that Smith owned the first automobile in Freeport, a White Steamer. In 1900, it was reported that Smith drove to Brooklyn, a distance of 25 miles. The trip, that included several stops, took one hour and 45 minutes. Smith may have been the first automobile distributor on Long Island, outside New York City.\n\nA 1907 advertisement shows G. Bennett Smith's Fulton Street (now Merrick Road) store selling Edison phonographs and Columbia gramophones. Beginning in 1907, Smith sold Fords, Studebakers, and Cadillacs.\n\nSmith's Freeport Garage was located at 23 East Merrick Road (at the corner of Henry Street). Behind this location, Smith ran a gas station with a machine shop, a repair department, and a body, tire, and paint shop.\n\nBeginning in 1937, Smith worked for the maintenance division of the Nassau County Department of Buildings. Smith was a member of the Freeport Elks Club, South Shore Yacht Club, the Freeport Republican Club, the Freeport Exchange Club, and the Freeport Methodist Church. He was also a director of Citizens' National Bank.\n\nSmith lived at 153 South Long Beach Avenue with his wife, May. They had a son, George, and a daughter, Jona.

Born in Merrick, to Carman and Ruthella Smith, he was educated at the Freeport Academy, the Rockville Centre Institute, and New York University. He began his career working for the newspaper, the South Side Observer in Rockville Centre. At the age of 20, he went to North Dakota where he started a store and later a bank. After returning to Long Island, he founded the Far Rockaway Bank in 1888 which eventually became the Bank of Long Island.\n\nSmith was an outspoken opponent of the trolleys in Freeport. When a crew from the Freeport Railway Company came to a street adjacent to his property around midnight in April 1913, Smith drove to Jamaica to obtain a temporary injunction from Supreme Court Justice J.C. Van Siclen. He returned home at 4 a.m. and stopped the construction.\n\nSmith married Ella Boynton (1862-1930) in 1885.

Smith (1818-1893) (also known as \"Daddy Bill\") was a pioneer boat builder in Freeport. His home and boatyard were located on North Main Street near Dean Street.\n\nSmith was the youngest child of Raynor Rock Smith and his first wife, Ruth Whaley. Raynor Rock Smith, known as the hero of the Mexico, helped rescue people from this sinking ship near Long Beach.\n\nSmith's farm was located on both sides of what is now North Main Street with Seaman Avenue on its northern boundary. His home, located on the west side of North Main Street faced south with its gabled end facing the road. The house had four chimneys and a large central hall.\n\nIt is believed that Smith established his boat building operation around 1875; the Mary R, named for his wife, was the first boat he constructed. Smith's boatyard was located on the east side of North Main Street, opposite his home. Though more than a mile from the Freeport River, this location was close to woods that gave Smith a supply of the white oak lumber he used to build his boats, sloops, and schooners. It was said that he soaked his lumber in water for periods up to a year, which made the wood pliable when wet and extremely hard once it dried. It was also reported that the bowsprits of Smith's ships reached into the road. When completed, boats were moved down Main Street using cradles, planks, rollers, grease, ropes, and horses. It would take several days to move the boats to Freeport River where they were floated during high tide.\n\nThe ships Smith built included: the Democrat, Annie R., Enterprise, and Walter R. In 1946, the Enterprise and Annie R. were still in use.\n\nIn addition to ships, Smith constructed wagons. He built two open wagons, both of which seated two people, in 1888.\n\nAround 1908, some of the Smith property was sold to William G. Miller and Valentine G. Walters for development.\n\nAround 1911, part of Smith's property was purchased by the Columbian Brass Foundry (later, the Columbian Bronze Company). Columbian Bronze was said to have used part of the old barn that was located on the Smith's boat building property. The company was known for making marine propellers which ranged in size from several inches to 10 feet in diameter. Columbian Bronze's slogan, \"With a Columbian propeller behind you will come out ahead in the end,\" was painted on the north side of the building.\n\nClick here for images related to William R.

It was said that the League's purpose was for \"the improvement of the game.\" The original league included the following teams: Seminoles of Bellmore; Observers of Rockville Centre; Mohawks of Freeport; and Maroons of Freeport. The officers were George Wallace, President; Dr. J.H. B. Denton, Vice President; Charles Horsfall, Treasurer. The Seminoles were the first champions.\n\nIn 1888 the League reorganized with the following clubs: Athletics of Freeport; Domestics of Far Rockaway; Live Oaks of Oceanside; Observers of Rockville Centre; Resolutes of Hempstead; Seminoles of Bellmore; and Siacs of Woodhaven. The officers were: George Wallace, President; J. B. Merrell, Vice President; C. H. Haynes, Secretary; and Dr. J. H. B. Denton, Treasurer. Later in the season the Atlantics of Jamaica were admitted to the League. The Domestics won the championship in this season.\n\nIn 1889, the League agreed that the players had to reside in Queens County (there was no Nassau County until 1899). The teams included: Atheneums of Rockville Centre; Domestics of Far Rockaway; Live Oaks of Oceanside; Resolutes of Hempstead; Seminoles of Bellmore; and the Siacs of Woodhaven. Umpires for the season were: John Mutter (Woodhaven); F. Jay Bedell (Freeport); Daniel Noble (Long Island City); and J. Mulford Doxsey (Pearsalls). The Domestics won their second championship that season.\n\nAt a meeting of the league in 1899, bylaws were adopted and the matter of umpires was discussed. The league agreed that the home team would pay the umpires $2.\n\nThe Brooklyn Daily Eagle newspaper provided a $30 silver cup to the league champions.\n\nIn 1915, the teams included: Freeport; Freeport Elks; Merrick, and Rockville Centre.\n\nSee Also:\n\nBaseball\n\nSources:\n\n\"In Sporting Circles.\" Nassau County Review.

There have been at least three spite fences erected in Freeport.\n\nIn 1910, Dr. Myrick, a local dentist and village trustee erected a 15 to 16-foot fence between his home at 348 South Main Street and the home of Dr. and Mrs. Evans at 350 South Main Street. Edith and Thomas Evans renovated their home to include many windows for Gertrude's art studio. She claimed she needed the natural light for painting. However, Dr. Myrick felt the windows allowed the Dr. and Mrs. Evans to spy on his family. No mention of this spite fence can be found in newspaper articles after 1910.\n\nA spite fence was erected between the homes of Eugene and Rose Helland of 224 North Columbus Avenue and Irving and Lizzie Bedell of 220 North Columbus Avenue. The fence was erected in 1912 after Rose had Lizzie arrested for \"malicious mischief.\" According to newspaper accounts, ashes that Lizzie threw out landed on clothes drying on a line on the Helland's property. While burning garbage, Lizzie further soiled the Helland's clothing. Judge Edwards threw out the case. Soon after the incident, the Bedells erected a fence but removed it when a survey showed that it cut off three feet of their own property. A second eight-foot high fence was constructed by the Hellands. According to the media, Eugene and Irving, who both worked for S. T. Post, remained on good terms; their sons, James Bedell and Wilfred Helland also remained friends.\n\nIn 1920, A. S. Brown who lived at 150 North Main Street put up a 14 foot lattice fence between his house and his estranged wife, Irene, who lived next door. Brown erected the fence after his wife hired a carpenter to shingle one side of her house, and the carpenter used Brown's property without permission to access the outside of his wife's house.\n\nSee Also:\n\nSpite House\n\nSources:\n\n\"Dr. Myrick's Big Fence Proves a Bar to Art.\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

It was also associated with the Freeport Gun Club located at 500 South Main Street. It offered food and entertainment along with fishing, boating, and other sporting pursuits.\n\nLand adjoining the Freeport Gun Club and bordering the Freeport Creek at the foot of South Main Street was purchased in 1921 by Rudolph “Ruddy” Domschke. Domschke, along with Albin Johnson, Amos Pearsall, Joseph Shay and Harold Walker, were the founding members of the Freeport Gun Club when it was re-established in December 1920 (the original club was founded in 1896).\n\nDomschke immediately started renovating and extending the fishing station that already stood on the property, and added docks as well. The building became the clubhouse for both the Freeport Gun Club and the Freeport Athletic Association. The opening of the Sport Lovers Nook in September 1921 was marked with dancing, fireworks and other entertainment. The property had 600 feet of water front that included a swimming beach. An advertisement from around 1921 purported that the facility was planning to add lawn tennis courts, a baseball field, 50 and 75 foot indoor rifle ranges, fly-casting contesting grounds, a billiard parlor, sail boats, polo ponies, and a refrigerating plant for its fishing station. It is not known if any of these amenities were added.\n\nDomschke added five bungalows to the property. These bungalows were first used, along with a large tent, by firemen from out of town who were in Freeport for the Jubilee Convention week in August 1922. After the firemen returned home, the bungalows were leased by Lively Cinema Advertising System, Inc. for the purpose of making films in Freeport.\n\nThe facility later became the Blue Goose Inn.\n\nAl Grover purchased 500 South Main Street in 1969 and created Al Grover's High and Dry Marina on the site.\n\nSee Also:\n\nFreeport Athletic Association\n\nFreeport Gun Club\n\nSources:\n\n1930-1931 Freeport Phone Book.\n\n\"Sports Lovers' Nook.\" The Freeport News.

Around 1905, he purchased a large tract of land in Freeport along Pennsylvania Avenue. His plan was to create one of the finest and most exclusive residential parks on Long Island. No expense would be spared to achieve this goal. He laid out many streets and residential plots with extensive landscaping. He took care not to uproot the existing trees and shrubbery. Long driveways were also part of his plan.\n\nAt some point, his friends prevailed on him to sell them some of the property. By 1925 there were 35 expensive and stylish homes in Stearns Park This club colony was one of the show places of Freeport. The west side was surrounded by the golf course of the Milburn Country Club located at Brookside Avenue and Milburn Creek. The entrance to Stearns Park was about two blocks north of Seaman Avenue on Pennsylvania Avenue. He and his wife Erna (1885-1968) lived at 426 and later, 378 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nMr. Stearns retired in 1928 and devoted his full time to his first love – writing. He published a book of poetry and the flyleaf described him as having been “born in Westphalia where he spent much of his youth writing short stories and loafing behind the scenes in theatres and circuses.\"\n\nAnother claim to fame for Hugo Stearns was that the Queen of England sent him a gift in recognition of his efforts in promoting the ostrich feather business.\n\nHe died in the early 1940s and his wife died on July 28, 1968.\n\nClick here for pictures of Stearns Park.\n\nBook of Poetry by Hugo Stearns.\n\nSee Also:\n\nMilburn Country Club\n\nStearns Park\n\nWillowbrook Estates\n\nResearched by Cynthia J.

It was reported that the property was originally was comprised of eight farms including the Dykeman,Willis, and Shabold farms. His plan was to create one of the finest and most exclusive residential parks on Long Island. No expense would be spared to achieve this goal. He laid out many streets and residential plots with extensive landscaping. He took care not to uproot the existing trees and shrubbery. Long driveways were also part of his plan. At some point, his friends prevailed on him to sell them some of the property.\n\nAround 1916, Stearns laid out a 9-hole golf course on 100 to 160 acres of land that extended almost to Grand Avenue in Baldwin. Originally, the golf club was supposed to be called the Nassau Country Club or the South Side Country Club. But when the deal fell through, the course was purchased by golf enthusiasts for $250,000 and called the Manhattan Country Club (later the Milburn Country Club).\n\nBy 1925, there were 35 expensive and stylish homes in Stearns Park. Owners included those in business and the arts like radio personality Gabriel Heatter and advertising executives Ed Wilson and Wallace H. Campbell, and Charles Martin of the Equitable Life Insurance Company. A notable visitor to Stearns Park was Lou Gehrig. The famed Yankee's first basemen's wife, Elinor Grace Twitchell, was related to residents of Stearns Park. Twitchell's aunt and uncle, Blanche and Gene Austin, lived at 435 Pennsylvania Avenue. The Austins hosted the Gehrig's wedding reception in 1933. Gehrig, \"an enthusiastic fisherman\" came to Freeport on several occasions to fish from local charter boats.\n\nOn October 21, 1939, Stearns put the last 48 lots up for public sale.\n\nClick here for the website and contact information for the Stearns Park Civic Association.\n\nSee Also:\n\nHeatter, Gabriel\n\nMilburn Country Club\n\nPrince Avenue\n\nStearns, Hugo\n\nWillowbrook Estates\n\nSources:\n\n\"Active Home Buying Continues in These Progressive Communities.\" The Brooklyn Daily Eagle.

Stefano graduated from Baldwin High School in 1943 and served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. He attended Villanova University and was a Jones Beach lifeguard. He learned boat building while working at Freeport Point Shipyard and was mentored by Sam Verity, a noted local boat builder. Stefano established the Colony Cove Boat Shop in Baldwin in the 1950s. He later moved the boatyard to Cary Place in Freeport where it remained for 20 years.\n\nStefano was known for his skill in constructing his version of the Verity Skiff, a lapstrake open boat which featured a box keel for stability. Made of plywood with a flat bottom, Stefano's boats could be powered by an outboard motor of up to 40 horsepower. In addition to skiffs, Colony Cove built yachts, and surf rescue boats of its own design for municipal lifeguard corps.\n\nStefano constructed his last wooden rescue boat in 1973. From then on, wood was replaced by Fiberglass which was cheaper and faster to produce.\n\nStefano held a United States Coast Guard Master's license for over 50 years. He delivered yachts to various ports throughout the Eastern Seaboard. In the 1980s, Stefano coached the Baldwin Bay Colony Rowers. This team won the International Lifeboat Race every year between 1981 and 1986. The women's team placed first in 1985 and 1986. Stefano also worked as a marine surveyor.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Captain James Stefano Dies.\" The Leader. June 5, 2019.

Stewart opened this cocktail bar and cabaret in August of 1962. Before changing the name, the restaurant was known as Kayatt's Red Carpet Restaurant. Stewart's sister Lee sometimes served as a hostess.\n\nStewart was born in Washington, DC, and was the youngest of three children. Her father, Reverend J. Perry, was the founder of Guildfield Church. In 1942, Stewart came to New York to attend Long Island University in Brooklyn. She later entered into the field of medical record sciences. She studied at St. Mary's Hospital, Brooklyn School for Medical Records Librarians, and received additional training in medical nomenclature at St. Vincent's Hospital, New York. For eight years, Stewart was the chief medical records librarian at the Astoria General Hospital. She then became the assistant librarian at the Department of Hospitals in New York City. In 1953, Stewart represented the City of New York at the International Conference of Medical Records Librarians in Boston.\n\nStewart opened her first business, Fuzzie 1 Cocktail Lounge, in St. Albans, Queens in 1958. She came to Freeport in 1962.\n\nStewart was a member of the American Association of Medical Records Librarians. In 1963, Stewart served as the first treasurer of the Freeport-Roosevelt Chapter of the NAACP, an organization she helped establish. The Leader featured Stewart in an article entitled \"Woman of Many Talents,\" in 1967. Stewart was active the Freeport Chamber of Commerce, servings as the chairperson for the Chamber's annual Fashion Show and Cocktail Party in 1968. That same year, she was the recipient of the Duryea Orchid Award, which was a floral tribute bestowed on deserving women in recognition of their community service.\n\nStewart's restaurant catered to all races and hired diverse musicians. In a 1966 Newsday article, Stewart recounted an experience with a piano player who came to her establishment looking for work. He assumed he would not be hired because he was white. Stewart then asked the musician, \"What color do you play in? Red, blue, or green?\n\nShe married musician (Irving) Kirby Walker in 1967. The following year, the couple opened a restaurant called the Elegante, which was located at 338 Nassau Road in Roosevelt, NY.\n\nStewart later opened the Red Carpet Travel Service out of her home at 79 Taylor Avenue, Roosevelt, NY. After Stewart's husband died in 1972, she moved to Georgia. In 1975, she started Enterprise Travel Service, Inc. Due to the success of the 1977 mini series Roots, based Alex Haley's book, Stewart's travel agency began taking African Americans to West Africa for African heritage tours.\n\nClick here for images related to Fuzzie's.\n\nSources:\n\n\"Brotherhood of Bitterness.\" Newsday.

He merged the two newspapers to create The Observer-Post. In 1920, he combined The Observer-Post with the Nassau County Review and the Hempstead Inquirer. The resulting paper was the Nassau Daily Review.\n\nIn 1933, Stiles acquired the Nassau Daily Star, which was a competing newspaper published in Lynbrook. The he combined the Nassau Daily Review and the Nassau Daily Star in 1937 to create The Nassau Daily Review-Star. In the 1940s, the newspaper had a peak circulation of over 40,000 subscribers. The newspaper was eventually sold to Newspaper Enterprises, Inc. in 1949. Stiles remained on board as editor until the company went out of business in 1954.\n\nStiles was born in Saratoga Springs, NY and came to Freeport with his family as a child. While a student at Freeport High School, he managed the advertising department for the school's literary magazine, The Student. He also started a publication called The Tattler. He graduated as class president in 1909. Stiles attended Wesleyan University.

Susan Bergen, a prominent Freeporter, served as the organization's vice president; her daughter, Annie V. Secor, was its treasurer. Years later, in 1912, suffragists visited the village. A four-mile suffrage parade from Mineola to Hempstead took place on May 24, 1913. This parade was organized by Rosalie Jones, a Long Island socialite; as a suffrage leader, she visited Freeport frequently. Eighty-five-year-old Rhoda Glover, a Baldwin resident and ardent suffragist, participated in the procession. On August 7, 1913, members of the New York Suffrage League recruited new members in Freeport and Long Beach. The following year, local newspapers dubbed May 2nd as \"Independence Day for Women.\"\n\nThe Freeport Suffrage Club was organized in 1914. Florence Conklin Carman, wife of Dr. Edwin Carman, was the organization's secretary (later that same year, she would later resign after she was tried for the murder of Louise Bailey). The Women's Suffrage Club of Freeport was formed in 1915. Soon after, dissension amongst the membership caused the group to split and Freeport's Equal Franchise Club emerged. Suffragists from Freeport, Port Washington, and Hempstead were invited to march in the Southern New York Volunteer Firemen's Association parade in Hempstead in June 1915. The anti-suffrage movement was organized under the name, \"Association Opposed to Women Suffrage.\" Both the pro and anti suffrage movements became very active in Freeport and the surrounding communities when an equal suffrage amendment appeared on the New York State ballot on November 2, 1915. In Freeport, the measure failed by 109 votes; it was also defeated throughout the state.\n\nIn 1917, the New York State Woman Suffrage Party supported equal franchise in local newspaper advertisements. In the Town of Hempstead, 3,838 people voted in favor of suffrage and 3,172 voted against it. This measure passed and the state Constitution was amended making New York the first eastern state to grant women the right to vote.\n\nFreeporter Carrie Flint, wife of Mayor Flint, was president of the Women's Suffrage League in 1914.\n\nClick here for material related to suffrage in New York State.\n\nClick here for images related to suffrage on Long Island from the Library of Congress.\n\nSee Also:\n\nBaker, C.

That year, the association distributed over 500,000 copies of a brochure that included maps and listings of hotels and restaurants to aid motorists and promote tourism on Long Island. In an advertisement in the New York Herald, the association called for people to \"Hit the Sunrise Trail\" and described Montauk Highway, North Country Road, and Middle Island Road as being part of \"The Sunrise Trails.\"\n\nThat same year, the Long Island Rail Road and the Long Island Real Estate Board created their own brochure entitled Suburban Long Island: The Sunrise Homeland. The original brochure was 136 pages long and it described the 125 towns within New York City's commuting zone. The brochure aimed to entice city residents to purchase homes on Long Island.\n\nFrank G. Holly, proprietor of the Holly Arms Inn in Hewlett and president of the Long Island Association, is credited with coining the name Sunrise Highway in the 1920s. Constructed on top of the water conduit pipes that were laid along Long Island's South Shore, the road had been previously referred to as Pipeline Boulevard. His push for the name change led to his nickname \"Sunrise.\"\n\nThe Long Island Association was renamed the Long Island Chamber of Commerce in 1926. The Chamber continued to publish Long Island the Sunrise Homeland. From 1939 on, the brochure was published by the Long Island Association (the Chamber changed their name back to the Long Island Association in 1936). The publication ceased in the 1950s.\n\nIn 1928, the Village of Freeport adopted a village seal, designed by local artist Louis F. Fleming, that included the phrase \"Freeport - Nassau County - New York - The Heart of the Sunrise Trail - Incorporated 1892.\"\n\nClick here to see the library holdings for Long Island the Sunrise Homeland.\n\nSee Also:\n\nVillage Seal\n\nSources:\n\n\"Booming Long Island.\" The New York Times.
