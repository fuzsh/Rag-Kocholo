It does not mean we love them less. Garrett, we care, we love you and we are very sad. May you lay your head down and rest now. Sue, Liam, and Jordan, I hope you can lean on us to help with the pain. I told Jordan, to keep talking to Garrett, and look to Heaven knowing he was out of pain. Garrett, you are gone way too soon. Please watch over your loving family and give them strength. Parents should never have to say goodbye to their children. Love Coach Marc.\n\nMarc La Pierre"
