        "text": "Firm Overview\n\nNorth Texas Local Government and Municipal Law\n\nThe roots of Boyle & Lowry go back to 1975 when John F.Boyle Jr. partnered with Ray Hutchison to form the law firm of Hutchison, Price, Boyle, and Brooks in Dallas. That law firm was the first in Texas to represent public entities collectively as general counsel, special counsel and as bond counsel. In 1995 John F. Boyle Jr. and L. Stanton Lowry formed Boyle & Lowry for the continuation of the practice of local government and municipal law.\n\nAt Boyle & Lowry, we believe in doing what we do best: getting positive results for public entities. To achieve these positive results, we provide accurate, efficient and timely advice and counsel on legal issues affecting our clients.

With more than 125 years of combined experience in the areas of municipal and local government law, our attorneys can develop innovative yet practical solutions that would be unknown to a general law firm.
