One large component of the materials is the American Forestry Association Photograph Collection (boxes 115-129), which encompasses a wide array of significant images pertaining to forestry and conservation history in the 20th century. The collection was created and maintained by AFA's American Forests magazine division.\n\nTitle: American Forestry Association Records, 1875 - 1997\n\nCreator: American Forestry Association\n\nRepository: Forest History Society Library and Archives\n\nCall Number: 3233\n\nLanguage of Material: Material in English\n\nExtent: 162 linear feet (224 archival boxes, 36 record cartons)\n\nHistorical Note\n\nEstablished in 1875, the American Forestry Association is the oldest group in North America organized to promote forest conservation. The organization became American Forests in 1992.\n\nCollection Overview\n\nThe collection includes correspondence, articles, manuscript surveys and reports on forestry, newspaper clippings, and published material relating to the American Forestry Association. Includes studies and investigations, awards, directors' minutes, directors' correspondence, annual meetings, annual reports, elections, miscellaneous, Redwood National Park, and miscellaneous administration. There are few materials dating before 1900; the bulk of the collection dates from the 1930s-1960s. Among the prominent correspondents are William B. Greeley, Ovid Butler, Gifford Pinchot, and Samuel T. Dana. Additional accessions are expected.\n\nThe American Forestry Association Photograph Collection (boxes 115-129) encompasses a wide array of significant images pertaining to forestry and conservation history in the 20th century. The collection was created and maintained by AFA's American Forests magazine division. The bulk of the collection dates from before 1960 and contains a rich selection of early Forest Service photographs, as well as images of forest fires, logging, and forest management. The records also hold notable scenes from national parks, forests, and monuments in the United States. The images in the \"Scenes\" files represent a diverse and impressive range of topics dating primarily from the early to mid-20th century. Most of the images therein depict American scenes (organized by state and subject) with one section devoted solely to scenes from foreign countries. There are also images depicting AFA activities, including their Big Trees project, urban forestry initiatives, Trail Riders of the Wilderness expeditions, and staff functions.\n\nCollection Arrangement\n\nOriginal Deposit, 1875-1984\n\nPerry Hagenstein's Files, 1980-1997\n\nAdministrative Files, 1950-1964\n\nPhotograph Collection, 1901-1996\n\nSubject Headings\n\nAmerican Forestry Association\n\nButler, Ovid\n\nDana, Samuel Trask, 1883-\n\nForest conservation -- United States\n\nGreeley, William B.\n\nNational parks and reserves\n\nNature conservation -- Societies, etc.\n\nPinchot, Gifford\n\nForests and forestry--Fire management\n\nHistoric trees.\n\nForest restoration.\n\nForests and forestry.\n\nUnited States.

Photograph Collection, 1901-1996.\n\nThe American Forestry Association Photograph Collection encompasses a wide array of significant images pertaining to forestry and conservation history in the 20th century.
