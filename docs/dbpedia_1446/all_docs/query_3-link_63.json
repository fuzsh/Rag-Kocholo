        "text": "Cases Tried or Otherwise Taken to Judgment\n\nApplied Medical Resources Corp. v. United States Surgical Corp. (2008)\n\nRepresented defendant United States Surgical Corporation, a subsidiary of Covidien, in patent infringement suit. Applied Medical alleged that U.S. Surgical infringed a medical device patent and sought up to $400 million in damages and an injunction. Won non-infringement jury verdict after five-week trial.

Bayer owns the patent on Cipro, one of the world's leading antibiotics. Barr brought a generic challenge to the Cipro patent, and Bayer initiated \"Hatch-Waxman\" litigation in the Southern District of New York. On the eve of trial, Bayer paid Barr $400 million to settle and thereafter submitted the Cipro patent to the U.S. Patent Office for reexamination. The patent reissued and Bayer defeated three later generic challenges. Fred represented Bayer in each of the three generic challenges, winning two Federal Circuit appeals along the way. The antitrust plaintiffs consist of a class of direct purchasers of Cipro (like drug store chains) and a class of indirect purchasers (consumers). They alleged that it is an antitrust violation for a brand to pay a generic challenger to settle Hatch-Waxman litigation. The MDL proceeding was before Judge David G. Trager in the Eastern District of New York. Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the ground that Bayer's settlement payment to Barr was a per se antitrust violation. Judge Trager ruled in Bayer's favor and adopted Bayer's analytical framework for analyzing Hatch-Waxman settlements. Thereafter, the Eleventh and Second Circuits adopted Judge Trager's reasoning. Following his per se ruling, Judge Trager invited Bayer to file a motion for summary judgment, which Judge Trager granted. Plaintiffs appealed to the Second Circuit, which transferred the Indirect Plaintiffs' appeal to the Federal Circuit. Fred argued and won both the Second Circuit and Federal Circuit patent/antitrust appeals.\n\nClick here for press reports.\n\nUnited States v. United Technologies Corp.
