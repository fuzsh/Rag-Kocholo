        "text": "Andrew Braid Cook was born on February 2, 1864, in Dundee, Wisconsin, the son of Cornelius and Margaret A. (Braid) Cook. After finishing his education in the public schools of Racine, Wisconsin, Cook attended the Spencerian Business College in Milwaukee and then became a bookkeeper for Charles J. Russell's coffee business in Milwaukee.\n\nIn 1883 he moved to Montana, where he held a variety of jobs over the next few years. He worked briefly shipping cattle for the 79 Ranch, as a clerk in the Blue Front Store in Billings, as a mule-skinner for a survey party on the Crow Indian Reservation, and as baggage master for the newly opened Northern Pacific Railroad office in Helena. He gained experience in railroad building working for Hugh Kirkendall and Peter Larson and for W.H. Guthrie and Company, including building the Wickes tunnel on the Montana Central Railroad south of Helena.\n\nIn 1889 he opened a real estate office in Missoula, in partnership with Frank W. McConnell. After McConnell, Cook and Company dissolved in 1892, Cook continued the business under his own name. He continued to manage his Missoula real estate holdings for the rest of his life, while devoting his major attention to his other occupations.\n\nA.B. Cook was elected Montana State Auditor in 1892 and served one term. While serving as State Auditor he also established his own railroad construction business in partnership with Martin Wolfson. They negotiated a contract with the Northern Pacific to build a spur to the Parrot Smelter at Whitehall. Around 1905, Cook's Montana Concrete Construction Company got contracts in Livingston, Dillon, and Bozeman to do sidewalk work. He built the dam and irrigation canal system at Bynum Reservoir for the Teton Cooperative Reservoir Company.\n\nAs Cook, Deeks, and Hinds, and as the Toronto Construction Company he worked on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. In 1912 under South Dakota law, he incorporated the Cook Construction Company with Alexander McKenzie and L.L. Stephens. They opened an office in St. Paul, Minnesota, and a branch office in Montreal, Canada. Among the contracts this company obtained were the building of the Montreal Aqueduct, and the rebuilding of the Halifax, Nova Scotia, terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railroad, following a freighter explosion in 1917. The Cook Construction Company dissolved in 1921.\n\nA.B. Cook, however, was best known as a Hereford cattle rancher. In 1907 he bought the Flying U Ranch at Bynum from F. Augustus Heinze and began to develop the prize-winning Hereford cattle herd which became the passion of his later life. He bought the beginnings of his herd from the John Wellcome Estate in Waterloo, Iowa. With the herd came George Sim who oversaw Cook's breeding program for many years. Around 1912, Cook moved his cattle operation to the Missouri River Valley north of Townsend. He bought three ranches there: the Dunleavy and Rorvig ranches near the outlet of Confederate Creek, and the Bedford Ranch on the west side of the river. He later added Sheep Ranch in Meagher County, the Newland Creek Ranch, the Hevey Ranch, and several smaller pieces. During the 1910s he also was a partner with Alexander McKenzie in the Stiles Cattle Company which had extensive holdings on the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota. In October 1928, after losing a major lawsuit, Cook was forced to sell his herd. He died a month later on November 24, 1928.\n\nIn April, 1908, A.B. Cook married Mary Morgan Pettingell, a native of Bowling Green, Kentucky. While quite young Mary had married Frank Hervey Pettingell, with whom she had two children: Frank Hervey and Mary Agnes. That marriage ended in divorce. A.B. Cook adopted Mary's children, giving them his last name. The Cooks had one daughter Gloria, born in 1916.\n\nFrank Hervey Cook was born in 1899 in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, graduating in 1919. He assisted his adopted father on the ranch, and on the death of A.B. Cook operated the ranch on a smaller scale. In 1931 he married Lena (Sally) Gosnell Finley, heiress of the Gosnell oil fortune. She died of a heart ailment August 5, 1933. With the flooding of much of the Cook ranch property by Canyon Ferry Reservoir in 1953, Cook moved the Dunleavy house to the Bedford Ranch north of Townsend. Frank Hervey Cook was murdered there, in an apparent robbery attempt, on November 22, 1970.\n\nThis collection consists of personal and business papers of A.B. Cook.
