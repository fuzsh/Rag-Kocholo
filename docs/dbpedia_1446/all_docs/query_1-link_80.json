        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nMary Poppins was the second movie I “saw,” at a drive-in my parents and older sister, during July or August of 1965. (The first was a matinee of the Disney Cinderella, in June of that year, at a regular theater.) Being only four years old and used to early bedtimes, I fell asleep in the back seat of the car fairly quickly. I do remember, however, the cartoon that preceded it (the 1937 Pluto’s Quin-Puplets) as well as the sight of Julie Andrews floating to the pavement in front of the Banks home and sliding up the banister, and I did wake up in time to see Jane and Michael being approached by the old crone and menaced by the barking dog in the alley before re-encountering Bert. When I saw the picture again during its 1973 reissue, that scene was still vivid in my memory, as was the chimneysweeps’ “Step in Time” twilight dance on the London rooftops, with Andrews’ cannily designed red dress popping out amid all that black. I’m pretty sure I stayed awake, as another Sherman Brothers song from the movie impelled us, after that, and to the end of the picture.\n\nPreparatory to seeing Mary Poppins again recently on Blu-ray I re-read, for the first time since the age of 10, the P.L. Travers book on which the Walt Disney movie was based (more or less) and was struck again, as I was in the summer of 1971, by what a smug, generally nasty piece of work the Travers Poppins really is, sneering at everyone (and every thing: e.g., the otherwise lovely, bittersweet chapter with the starling.) Because I saw and remembered so little of the movie, I recall asking my mother at the time if Julie Andrews’ Mary was mean, because sure as hell Travers’ Poppins is. Although many of the characters and incidents in the first book made it into the movie, Disney and his collaborators (the screenwriters Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi and the songwriters Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman, who had great input into the shaping of the script) softened the Poppins character. She was not made sappy, gooey or sentimental, but she is far less stern and foreboding, and more innately lovable, than her literary correspondent, who is starchy, vain, short-tempered and easily offended. The Perfect Nanny, indeed!\n\nMention of that song, delivered in the movie by Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber, leads me to the second step on my pubescent path to re-discovering Mary Poppins: Finding, that same summer, at a beloved Raleigh record store whose demise in the 2000s after a series of name changes is now lamented by those of my age who loved it, the Buena Vista soundtrack LP for a clearance price of, if memory serves, 99 cents. (Although now that I think about it, I believe the record purchase preceded my reading the Travers book, and led me to it.) The only Poppins music we had in the house while I growing up was a Disneyland 45 Mom bought my sister containing excerpts from a studio LP of the songs, with Marni Nixon and Bill Lee singing “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” and Lee (later the singing voice of Captain Von Trapp) performing “Step in Time.” For years those were the only songs I knew from the score.* Hearing that soundtrack album for the first time was one of those private events that hits you with the force of revelation. I don’t know what I expected — childish, treacly verses set to ticky-tacky music, possibly, although that old 45 we had as children should have told me that would not be the case. The first notes of this score sent the hair on the back of my neck to rising: Irwin Kostal’s high strings in counterpoint to the melody for “Feed the Birds.” This too was revelatory. Movie musicals tended, at least in my then-limited exposure to them, to begin with a flair. A fanfare of some sort. Frederick Loewe’s My Fair Lady Overture, and Meredith Willson’s for The Unsinkable Molly Brown, two of only three musical LPs in my parents’ small record collection, both begin that way so I expected it, especially from a big, colorful movie like Poppins. Instead, Kostal begins softly, gently… hauntingly, only segueing to an up-tempo number a minute in. Similarly, when Bert (Dick Van Dyke) sings his chimneysweep reprise of “Chim-Chim-Cheree,” Kostal begins it with a swirling introductory vamp and sets off the Sherman Brothers’ melody, itself almost Russian in texture, with a string and wind accompaniment that suggests the mysterious, slightly unsettling quality of that vista Bert in his Cockney accent describes as:\n\nUp where the smoke is all billered and curled\n\n‘tween pavement and stars, is the chimneysweep world;\n\nWhen there’s ‘ardly no day, nor ‘ardly no night\n\nThere’s things… ‘alf in shadow… and ‘alfway in light…\n\n©Wonderland Music Co.\n\nI should perhaps have remembered the Sound of Music LP, the third movie musical soundtrack album in Mom and Dad’s collection, which was also orchestrated by Kostal and which also opens softly. In any case, his work on Poppins is, I think, as good as musical movie arrangement gets.\n\nBut that is only, if you will, the surface of the Shermans’ score. What listening to that record at age 10 revealed to me was the quality of their songwriting. I’ve said elsewhere that I suspect Richard, the trained musician of the two, was the actual composer of the team and that Robert, the professional writer, more responsible for the lyrics in the songs they wrote together, and I think that viewpoint (admittedly uninformed and speculative) is borne out by Richard’s solo compositions, which bear the melodic hallmarks of the work he and his brother are credited with as a team. The division of musical labor in the brothers’ work matters less, however, than the overall calibre of the songs, which is extraordinarily high. As an avid pubescent listening to these pieces carefully for the first time, there was much I didn’t understand about some of the words — what was a suffragette? Who Mrs. Pankhurst? What did Mr. Banks mean by “the edifice of time” and noblesse oblige? And what in the world were “majestic, self-amortizing canals”? These songs were the furthest thing from mindless doggerel aimed at preschoolers. This was music (and lyric) writing on a par with Lerner and Loewe’s in My Fair Lady, much of which I also didn’t understand as a child but which I instinctively loved. Being an inordinate fan of The Jungle Book from the age of six or seven, I should have recognized the level at which the Shermans operated from the songs they wrote for it, although as fine as those are, they aren’t really in the same league as the Poppins numbers. Only in “Spoonful of Sugar” do they write solely on a level instantly graspable by small fry, with “instructive” words of the type so beloved of lyricists who make their living talking down to children, and telling them what to do, and think, and be. Yet in that number Mary Poppins is singing to small children, so the simple, direct approach is the correct one. “Stay Awake” works on a similar principle, with the added frisson of being ironic: Jane and Michael refuse to sleep, and Poppins wishes them to, so she sings a lullaby whose words are at perfect, deliberate odds with the song’s intent.\n\nElsewhere the Shermans were writing largely for mature characters singing to each other or simply vocalizing, in a movie intended to be enjoyed as much by adults as by their offspring, and in a variety of appropriate styles. This is most notable in the sequences that feature Van Dyke’s Bert. In the first Travers novel, Bert appears in a single chapter, in which (as in the picture) he accompanies Mary to tea in an imaginary landscape but (unlike in the picture) it is her day out and the Banks children are not present. Bert’s appearances in the Mary Poppins movie take on various vocational guises, different each time: In the opening, as a one-man band; next as a sidewalk artist; then as a matchstick seller; next a chimneysweep (the profession most Poppins fans remember best); finally as a seller of kites. He is our way into the story, our guide, and he addresses us directly at the beginning. a splendid way of bringing the audience into the world of the movie. The Shermans’ Bert is not merely a jack-of-all-trades, he’s a musical-hall minstrel, celebrating the tradition as the Sherman songs honor it. (In this, My Fair Lady is a model.) Travers’ book is set in what then the present (1934) but Disney’s Mary Poppins takes place at the climax of the Edwardian era (1910) and in that quarter-century span lies a world of difference, which the Shermans take full advantage of: “It’s grand to be an Englishman in 1910/King Edward’s on the throne, it’s the Age of Men!,” sings Mr. Banks (David Tomlinson) jubilantly, as our introduction to him. The joke in this statement is on him, however, since we’ve just seen his wife (Glynis Johns) extoling votes for women in “Sister Suffragette.” This is strong, intelligent (and funny) songwriting and beyond the sharp, pointed period references and maturity of language is the brothers’ understanding of what constitutes a good, literate song.†\n\nSomewhat astonishingly given not merely the eventual popularity of — and Academy Awards given to — the song score but its integral part in the movie’s artistic success (as well as Walt Disney’s personal fondness for it) the Shermans’ names were conspicuously absent from the original 1964 release poster for Mary Poppins. I cannot think this was a deliberate omission on Disney’s part, but who knows? The post-Oscar poster (see above) emphasized the music.\n\nThe finest song-score in the world, however, isn’t sufficient if the rest of the dramatic structure (the edifice!) for which it was composed isn’t strong enough to support it; the shoals of Broadway are littered with the remains of lyric/compositional masterworks written for shows that failed them in the book, the staging, some central mis-casting, or all three at once (for an example of the first see the 1957 Candide, music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by John LaTouche, Richard Wilbur & Legion.) While like Travers’ book the Mary Poppins movie is episodic, it has a subtle narrative through-line, one the viewer only gradually becomes aware of. The transformation of the oblivious Mr. Banks from distant parent to attentive father is a nice touch, but even cannier is the way it is engineered. Although the British would have understood that the employment of nannies by distracted middle-class parents allowed fathers and mothers — mostly mothers — to not be bothered with the messy everyday realities of child-raising, their American coevals had long since rejected the notion (except for the wealthy, of course, who still cling to it, both in Britain and America, with predictable results for their superfluous offspring) Mary Poppins allows for a comforting reversal. Poppins tells the children at the beginning she will stay until the wind changes, and means it. She manipulates Mr. Banks into letting Jane and Michael accompany him to the bank, exactly as he charges in his soliloquy to Bert, although he cannot see why he should have taken that particular interest in his children, an attitude Bert gently chides him for. Somehow (perhaps via Poppins magic?) things develop so beautifully that Mr. Banks is forced, through the cataclysm of his own personal disaster, into recognizing what matters. That this coincides with the changing of the wind’s direction, and Poppins’ leave-taking, as I say, may or may not be due to her interference but it dovetails in a lovely fashion with what the filmmakers were going for. “Look at them!” Poppins’ cranky parrot umbrella handle complains to her at the end. “You know, they think more of their father than they do of you!” To which she responds, simply, “That’s as it should be.” The transference of the children’s affections from nanny to natural parent is thus neatly accomplished, although not without the necessary pain of leave-taking, which we sense even Poppins herself feels.\n\nP.L. Travers was alleged to have disapproved of the way Poppins’ nastiness was tamped down for the picture, but then P.L. Travers was unhappy about nearly everything to do with the movie of her most famous book. She disliked the songs, and she hated animation. So, what was left? Harlan Ellison for one defended her in a YouTube video, but no one put a gun to Travers’ head and forced her to sign a contract with Walt Disney. And what Ellison did not note is that she did so, after putting the studio off for 20 years, because sales of the Poppins books had dropped off. Pecuniary need does not imply consent to literary rape, of course, but from the tape recordings of the sessions she had with the writers and composers (some of which were included on the three-disc 2014 “Legacy” soundtrack CD) she did not seem to understand that a movie is not a book. Travers was not unique in that particular naïveté; many novelists have shared it, to their eventual despair. The smart ones, or at any rate the ones who’ve been burned sufficiently, take the Hollywood money and ignore the results. (William Goldman, who adapted his own work, excepted.) If you care deeply about what is done to your writing, don’t sell it to the studios. If you don’t have real power — which no novelist ever has in movies, unless he also serves as producer — you’re going to get your heart broken. Travers was so innocent of movie-production reality that after the Grauman’s premier of Mary Poppins she was still trying to give Disney notes on how to “fix” it. (Walt famously replied, probably with incredulity, “Pamela, that ship has sailed.”) Part of the problem, it seems to me, is that so many people (authors included) see the movies made from famous books as somehow definitive. They aren’t. Beloved will be read, and discussed, I suspect, long after every extant print of the Oprah Winfrey vanity film made from it has turned to oxidized dust. A movie like Mary Poppins isn’t P.L. Travers’. It’s Walt Disney’s. Call it a variation on a text, if you like. The novel has never been out of print since the picture opened, so both can be placed, however uneasily, on the same shelf. Or anyway until physical copies of the movie no longer exist which will, I suspect, be sooner rather than later.\n\nInterestingly, when he was an apprentice composer/lyricist writing a set of four musicals in an order dictated to him by his mentor, Oscar Hammerstein II, the teenage Stephen Sondheim thought Poppins would make a good stage musical, and Beatrice Lillie the perfect actress for it. (A time-damaged demo of Sondheim performing a song written for it is on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihvFups0Y1w&list=WL&index=5.) Lillie apparently been pursued the stage rights to the books herself, and I’m fascinated by this notion because for years I have thought, regarding the Mary Shepard illustrations, that Bea Lillie was the perfect choice to play Poppins.‡ Indeed, I find it difficult to believe Shepard didn’t model her Mary Poppins on the then enormously famous comedian. Even more curiously, Julie Andrews, in profile, bore a slight resemblance to Lillie which is presumably what led Pauline Kael, in her review of the 1968 movie musical Star!, to suggest that while Andrews was all wrong as Gertrude Lawrence she might manage to successfully impersonate Beatrice Lillie. And just to complicate matters completely, Andrews and Lillie were co-starred in the 1967 quasi-musical Thoroughly Modern Millie, giving us a chance to compare their profiles, and to wonder.\n\nAndrews, an untried presence in movies, was cast largely on the strength of her performance in Camelot on Broadway (and on an “Ed Sullivan Show” excerpt from the show Walt saw on television; he also liked her whistle) and brings her clear soprano, her natural warmth and her innately appealing personality to the role. Naturally, the same Hollywood system that demanded a star (Audrey Hepburn) for a major screen musical role (Liza Dolittle in My Fair Lady) regardless of whether or not she could sing then turned against that star and nominated the plucky gal who created the role on Broadway (Andrews) but who didn’t get the role Best Actress for another musical (Poppins) that scarcely taxed her dramatic abilities, and gave her the award. Carrie Fisher had perhaps the funniest response to this; while admittedly biased in the matter she averred in Wishful Drinking that her mother deserved the Oscar for The Unsinkable Molly Brown (as if anyone deserves an Academy Award) but that Andrews won “for her stunning, multi-layered and moving portrayal of Mary Poppins. Ibsen’s Mary Poppins.”\n\nAlthough it is, I think, a truism that nearly everyone loves Dick Van Dyke (what’s not to love?) he was so mercilessly slanged for his Cockney accent as Bert that when asked to play another Brit, in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, he didn’t bother trying, and has spent decades apologizing for his Poppins performance. Frankly, I don’t know what all the shouting was about. Van Dyke’s accent seems perfectly creditable to me, and certainly no worse than Andrews’ as Eliza on the Broadway and London cast recordings of My Fair Lady. The conception of the role fits the performer perfectly, tailored to his gifts like a good bespoke suit, and nowhere more than in the extended “Jolly Holiday” fantasy sequence in which he cavorts like one of the animated penguin waiters and joins Andrews in a loose-limbed music-hall dance to “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.” He’s also the ancient, doddering bank president Mr. Dawes and while he’s very funny Van Dyke doesn’t neglect the character’s extreme avarice; the gleam in his eye while slowly reaching for Michael’s lowly tuppence, which he grabs triumphantly, is almost a vest-pocket portrait of voracious capitalism — the repellant old creep is so greedy he steals pennies from a child.\n\nThe entire picture is beautifully cast, and expanded the characters from their sketchier literary antecedents. Mr. and Mrs. Banks appear in the opening chapter of Travers’ book, briefly, and are never seen or heard from again (they don’t even have given names) whereas in the movie Walsh, DaGradi and the Shermans give them heft, humor and importance. Glynis Johns, with that wonderful, slightly cracked voice of hers which Sondheim described as sounding like a rumpled bed,§ is charmingly vague as Winifred while David Tomlinson seems to me the ideal George Banks, an imperious family martinet yet, when everything goes against him, oddly pitiable. (Amusingly, young Matthew Garber, who plays Michael, resembles a miniature David Tomlinson, sans mustache but with equally weak chin and requisite protruding ears.) Ed Wynn, although he doesn’t attempt a British accent, is a splendid zany as Mary’s Uncle Albert and Karen Dotrice has remarkable poise and un-cloying sweetness as Jane. The supporting roles are equally richly delineated: Hermione Baddeley as the maid Ellen, Reta Shaw as the cook Mrs. Brill, Elsa Lanchester as Katie Nanna, Arthur Treacher as Constable Jones, Reginald Owen as Admiral Boom, Arthur Malet as Mr. Dawes Jr. and, in a silent cameo, the aged Jane Darwell as the Bird Woman. The voice cast in the pavement picture sequence is nearly as notable: Marc Breaux (who with his wife Dee Dee was Poppins‘ co-choreographer), Daws Butler, the matte artist Peter Ellenshaw, Paul Frees, Bill Lee, Jimmy MacDonald, Dallas McKennon (he’s the Irish fox in the steeplechase), Alan Napier, Marni Nixon, J. Pat O’Malley (who taught Van Dyke his Cockney and, he claimed, “didn’t do an accent any better than I did”), Thurl Ravenscroft, both Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, and David Tomlinson (whose voice is also instantly recognizable as that indignant parrot umbrella handle.)\n\nAlthough every picture his studio made was released under the banner “Walt Disney presents” not every movie was personally supervised by Disney. (Movie studios and sprawling dirt-free theme-parks don’t run themselves, after all.) Poppins was one on which he was intimately involved; Walt, who knew what a gamble the picture was, and how important it could be to his studio, oversaw every aspect of the production, and many of the little touches in Mary Poppins are his, including some of the recurring gags when Admiral Boom fires off his cannon. Disney’s mania for control — Disneyland and the planned EPCOT Center were the ultimate expressions of that — probably dictated the hermetic manner in which the picture was shot: Entirely on sound-stages on the studio lot. Yet even this feels right, due to the high level of craftsmanship involved; those Georgian homes on Cherry Tree Lane are uncommonly well detailed, and the matte work throughout the movie is exquisite. (Andrews’ then-husband Tony Walton was a set and costume consultant, and the visual effects team, which included Ellenshaw, Eustace Lycett and the animation director Hamilton Luske, were given the Oscar in that category.) The movie’s look is so dense and textured the only real giveaway to its complete artificiality are the under-populated cobblestone streets.\n\nThe direction by Robert Stevenson is, as usual with him, merely serviceable, but that seems all that was required. It’s square and quotidian and has no particular style but serves as a frame for what the writers, actors, animators and technicians bring to the scenes and the story. The effects, which assist the individual sequences without overwhelming them (except perhaps in the “Spoonful of Sugar” number, when the objects being put away by Jane and Michael run amok, and that’s most noticeable simply for the datedness of the stop-motion process) carry the day and might have had less of a magical quality if the direction of the scenes was busier or called more attention to itself. Edward Colman’s Technicolor cinematography, on the other hand, is both rich and muted, grounding the settings in everyday reality. Richard Williams, the mater animator responsible for Who Framed Roger Rabbit and The Thief and the Cobbler, hated the technological limitations of 1960s cinema that required, as he said, that the camera be “nailed to the floor” in combination live action/animation work, and I imagine for a later audience used to the freer camera work made possible by advance in digital manipulation the Poppins animation might feel a bit stodgy.\n\nThe “Jolly Holiday” sequence is beautifully realized given what was available during the period, and in fact looks much better than most special-effects scenes in movies both of its time and for years after. Instead of the usual bluescreen, Poppins used a sodium vapor process developed by Ub Iwerks in which (at any rate, according to the entry on the picture on Wikipedia): “… the actors were filmed against a white screen lit with sodium vapor lights, which have a yellow hue. A special camera was fitted with a prism that filtered this light to a separate reel of film, creating a highly accurate matte that could be used to isolate the actors from the background. This created a crisp, clean image and even allowed the partially transparent veil of Mary Poppins’s costume to let through light from the background.” It helps, of course, that the sequence is so charmingly written, planned, performed and animated, especially during Van Dyke’s extended dance with the penguin waiters. (Hamilton Luske was the animation director, and his animators included Milt Kahl, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Ward Kimball, John Lounsbery and Eric Larson.) The movie’s editor, Cotton Warburton, correctly observed that “the abundant use of ‘invisible wires’ was so smoothly done, it completely fools the eye.” (Wikipedia.) Unlike so many fantasy pictures before it, the viewer never feels that terrible, almost physical wrench that occurs when achievement doesn’t measure up to intention.\n\nHowever it might be criticized as a literary adaptation or even on its own merits or (to me, minimal) defects, Mary Poppins is filled with miraculous little touches that bring a smile or elicit a chuckle: Van Dyke enumerating different sorts of laughs during “I Love to Laugh”; Poppins, at the beginning of the rooftop sequence, applying soot to her makeup (which, naturally, the New York Times now instructs us was “a shameful flirting with blackface”); Julie Andrews saying, “Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious” backwards, as “Docious-ali-expi-istic-fragil-cali-rupus,” something she and Tony Walton came up with together; the unsuitable nannies being blown away from Cherry Tree Lane before they can be interviewed; the delightful animated touches, such as the way Poppins manipulates smoke on the rooftops to become steps on which she, Bert and children march; the strikingly crisp sound of Irwin Kostal’s orchestra, achieved in part when he (again, according to Wikipedia) “had the Disney recording stage reworked for stereo.” Readers of the Travers book will no doubt miss the strange, dark chapters featuring Mrs. Corry and her terrified Amazonian daughters, the starling chapter involving the Banks twins John and Barbara (neither of whom appears in the movie), the human zoo and “Bad Tuesday,” in which Poppins, using a magic compass, takes the children around the world in a few minutes, and which the Shermans attempted to musicalize before the sequence was abandoned in favor of “Jolly Holiday.” (Two of the songs created for that projected sequence were later revised for The Jungle Book and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.) In addition to the sixteen numbers extant in the finished picture, already a larger song-stack than in many Broadway musicals, the brothers wrote 30 songs for Mary Poppins that didn’t make the cut.\n\nYour personal opinion of Walt Disney will vary depending on what you have read or discovered about him. As a child I adored him, almost as a magical absentee uncle or grandfather, before his death two years after Poppins‘ release; my attitudes toward him are more nuanced now, and complicated by the less pleasant aspects of his personality, and his reactionary conservatism, a product it seems to me, at least in part, of his own complicated relationship with his sour Socialist father. As an employer, his paternalism was astoundingly naïve; he appeared to think his staff should live uncomplainingly on the largesse of his his imagined magnanimity rather than on wages commensurate with their talents, training and abilities (and public credit for what they’d done) and while it took him some 20 years to do it, he eventually succeeded in getting rid of everyone involved in the famous 1941 animators’ strike. Yet however negatively Disney may strike you, one of his more admirable traits was that he never looked back; he did not endlessly blaze and re-tread the same successful trails, but looked for new directions in which to strike out. One can never say with certainty what anyone might do, of course, but I like to think Walt Disney would be appalled at what his company has become, artistically, recycling and remaking to death what so effectively came before.\n\nDespite my reticence to prognosticate concerning Disney, I think we can be certain of one thing: He would have set fire to Disneyland before letting his company alienate so many members of his audience through excessive adherence to ESG guidelines demanded by Klaus Schwab. It is vaguely possible that, had he lived and had Travers consented (she wouldn’t have), Disney might have considered a Mary Poppins Returns — and indeed, that was the name of the author’s second book. But surely he wouldn’t have hired Lin Manuel Miranda!\n\n*As a four-year old I thought, when Lee and his backup singers on “Step in Time” sang “Link your elbows,” they were singing “Lick your elbows” and was impressed that anyone could do that even as I wondered why they would.\n\n†Sondheim used to point out that rhyme implies intelligence on the part of the character singing, and while he further maintained that inner-rhyme speeds up the lyric, to me it implies even greater intelligence, and wit: Think of Cole Porter’s “Too hot not to cool down” in “It Was Just One of Those Things” or — a Sondheim favorite — “She gave a new meaning/To the leaning tower of Pisa” in “Where is the Life That Late I Led?”\n\n‡Shepard, incidentally, was the daughter of Ernest Shepard and while they both worked in pen-and-ink, I see no other special relation between her most famous drawings, and his, for both the Winnie-the-Pooh books and (with Gareth Williams’ for Charlotte’s Web) my personal favorites among illustrations for children’s novels, those he drew for the 1931 edition of The Wind in the Willows.\n\n§Johns was the original Désirée Armfeldt in A Little Night Music, and the first to sing “Send in the Clowns.” Her version of the song is pretty much definitive, in part because, unlike almost everyone who recorded it after her, she created the role and was playing the underlying emotion of the scene that contained it: Not just regret, but anger.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nRecently, watching the luscious Blu-ray edition of the 1950 Walt Disney Cinderella, it struck me that it might be time to re-view the two best live-action versions I know of this ancient tale whose roots stretch back at least to the earliest Christian era and which has informed so much popular culture throughout the world, particularly in the west. While the 1950 Walt Disney animated version still seems to me the finest of all (the phrase “fairest of them all” belongs to another fairy tale given memorable4 life by Disney) there is so much to cherish in the other two they can hardly be considered also-rans.\n\nFirst, the 1957 Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II live television production starring the newly-minted Broadway star Julie Andrews, then firmly ensconced as Eliza Dolittle in the defining work of the era’s other preeminent team — at least until the advent, with Fiorello!, of Bock and Harnick — Lerner and Loewe’s My Fair Lady. “Cinderella” is very much a Broadway production, peopled by New York actors, designers and musical personnel, with some of the performers, in order to participate, taking time off the hit shows in which they were starred, Andrews from Fair Lady and the Fairy Godmother, Edie Adams, from Li’l Abner. Although it was broadcast in color, as with so many live television shows for which a kinescope survives, the video we are left with is in black-and-white. (It’s actually not the live broadcast but a kinescope of the dress rehearsal.) Still, while it would be lovely to see those sets and costumes in color, the show (or rather, the score) is the thing here, and it’s a charmer. Hammerstein gave it one funny number, the “Stepsisters’ Lament” performed with comic brio by the dour Alice Ghostly (as the sister hilariously named “Joy”) and a comedically braying Kaye Ballard, and in the somewhat repetitious “Impossible”/”It’s Possible,” Adams gets one of those sunny little releases that were almost a trademark of Hammerstein’s and which like the lyrics in “Getting to Know You” by the weird alchemy of his craft almost seem to have been a part of the popular language forever:\n\nBut the world is full of zanies and fools\n\nWho don’t believe in sensible rules\n\nAnd won’t believe what sensible people say,\n\nAnd because these daft and dewy-eyed dopes\n\nKeep building up impossible hopes,\n\nImpossible things are happ’ning every day!\n\nCopyright © 2013, 1957 by Oscar Hammerstein II\n\nCopyright Renewed, Williamson Music Company (ASCAP), c/o Concord Music Publishing\n\nSimilarly, the love-duet for Cinderella and the Prince, “Do I Love You Because You’re Beautiful?” is among those achingly perfect songs with which the R&H catalogue brims and which came with such astonishing regularity throughout their work, both together and apart. (Hammerstein’s dialogue for the pair is also remarkably intelligent.) My only complaint about the score is that there is among these lovely numbers a slight lack of variety, so that as one charm-song follows another you may long for something satirical like “How Can Love Survive?” or “No Way to Stop it,” the two best songs in the original The Sound of Music, neither of which made it to the movie. (The former is heard at the Von Trapp party, but as an instrumental.) But then, Rodgers’ music, for all its variety of styles, is seldom raucous or messily alive the way other composers’ routinely are. There’s something a little staid about his scores with Hammerstein, and even the greatest of them, like Carousel and The King and I, can feel a bit constricted musically. Only South Pacific is contemporary and feels like it.\n\nThe show is beautifully cast, with Andrews a practical and sweet-natured Cinderella, Howard Lindsay an amusing old fusspot of a king and the adorable Dorothy Stickney an enchanting queen, giving those who never saw them in it an idea of what they might have been like in Life with Father. Ilka Chase makes a flinty but not especially cruel Stepmother and Jon Cypher, remembered by viewers of my generation as the Chief of Police on “Hill Street Blues” with whom Daniel J. Travanti’s Frank Furillo so often sparred, almost makes the Prince less thankless a role than usual and is in splendid voice throughout. (He also has the show’s only noticeable flub when in the reprise of “Do I Love You Because You’re Beautiful?” he steps on Stickney’s lyric, about which he was miserable and she entirely unruffled.)\n\nI was not surprised to hear one of the cast members on the Shout! DVD (I think it was Andrews, although it might have been Ballard) say that the set was cramped, and you can see that it must have been, made up as it is of so many smaller playing areas, but the designs by Jean Eckart and William Eckart are beautiful, as are her costumes. Ralph Nelson directed the show with unhurried efficiency given the monumental task and Rodgers’ music was orchestrated by Robert Russell Bennett with his usual subtle brilliance. Bennett, who often composed more than was suspected of the scores he arranged for Rodgers, Cole Porter and others, was one of the six or seven finest orchestrators in Broadway history — Jonathan Tunick to Rodgers’ Stephen Sondheim. Half the reason a Rodgers waltz or ballad sounds like one is due to him.\n\nOf historical note: Presumably on the strength of the names Rodgers and Hammerstein, the “Cinderella” broadcast had the highest rating of any television program up to that time; Jon Cypher said that after the broadcast the New York streets were weirdly deserted, and it’s been estimated that of 167 million Americans in 1957, over 107 million tuned in. Not even the “M*A*S*H” finale, the reigning champion in the series episode field, drew that large a viewership. Let’s see Lin-Manuel Miranda top that.\n\nMusic is also the great strength, and weakness, of Richard B. Sherman and Robert M. Sherman’s The Slipper and the Rose: The Story of Cinderella (1976). Strength because the score is one of the Shermans’ finest for movies, on a par with the work they did on Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks. The only problem with the songs, which are on the whole either beautiful, delightful or both, is that as production numbers they tend to go on far too long. The picture, which weighs in at a hefty 143 minutes, could stand to lose a few, and the dances are what should have gone. Not all the dancing, of course, but the extraneous ensemble dancing, which seldom has anything to do with the scene or the song and at their nadir (in the otherwise apt “Position and Positioning”) resemble that terrible “Consider Yourself” number of Onna White’s in the movie of Oliver!, with the performers dancing their little hearts out for absolutely no reason. In their duet “What a Comforting Thing to Know,” the Prince (Richard Chamberlain) and his bodyguard (Christopher Gable) do acrobatics in a crypt, where metal pipes have been fitted above the sepulchres, apparently solely for them to swing on. The only extended dance that has a purpose, and some wit, is when the King (Michael Hordern) and his cabinet of pompous old ministers perform the typically Shermanian “Protocoligorically Correct” and launch into a funny kick-line atop the long table. What surprises me about the superfluous dances is that they were the work of Marc Breaux, who with his wife Dee Dee Wood created the often inspired and in any case always appropriate choreography in Poppins, The Sound of Music and Bedknobs — their extended Portobello Road number, stupidly cut from the release in 1973 and restored to home video, is the sort of ensemble work movie musicals often aspire to but seldom achieve and even in lesser pictures like The Happiest Millionaire and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang the Breaux-Wood dances spring wholly from the content of the song. Here the numbers seem to exist because The Slipper and the Rose is a musical and in musicals you dance… right?\n\nI was predisposed to enjoy The Slipper and the Rose because both its score and its original screenplay were written by the Sherman brothers, but on seeing it for the first time a decade ago I was entirely un-prepared, in spite of my cavils about the dances, for how utterly charming it is. (It even ends with old-fashioned curtain calls for the cast.) The movie’s origins are made a bit muddy by the director and co-scenarist Bryan Forbes’ commentary on the Blu-ray in which he implies he wrote the first screenplay and the interview with Richard and Robert Sherman in which they talk about it being their idea, and their original script, long before Forbes was involved. I suspect the Sherman brothers wrote it and that Forbes then revised it, making it more “English” in outlook and dialogue. It was certainly the Shermans who decided to refract the familiar story largely through the Prince’s perspective, and it was a perfect stroke. In nearly every other version of Cinderella, the Prince is — and this is not a pun on the last name of Julie Andrews’ consort from 1957 — a cipher, barely defined, who literally waltzes in at the ball, is left holding a glass slipper afterward, and re-emerges only at the end, having married his instant dream-girl.\n\nOne of the things the Shermans seldom get credit for — and there is much they get no credit for — is their sureness of touch. They were always conscious of content, form and style; the essentials. They understood time, place, who was singing, what they were trying to say, and why. They understood as well the means by which a song became necessary. Finally, they understood, and were masters at, musicality. (I assume, despite the team’s billing, that it was Richard, the trained musician, who did most of the composing, but since their credit was always as co-composers as well as co-lyricists, I will leave it at that.) In Mary Poppins, for example, they caught, as did Lerner and Loewe before them in the Convent Garden and Alfred Doolittle numbers in My Fair Lady, the exact, quintessential English music hall/busker style, for Bert and for the “Jolly Holiday” sequence. That facility for effective pastiche, one which sets them apart as musical dramatists, in this picture is perhaps the most fully realized of all their work for movies. Much of the score is operetta-style filtered through a modern idiom, with rich, fulsome parodies of the Graustarkian tropes and nods to Gilbert and Sullivan. It’s simultaneously thoroughly European, utterly British, and distinctly Sherman.\n\nOf the three musicals considered in this essay, The Slipper and the Rose is in its score the most accomplished and sophisticated. (Even the Disney Cinderella, whose brief song score feels more varied than the Rodgers and Hammerstein, isn’t as fully realized as this.) Interestingly and in keeping with the Shermans’ means of telling the story, it is the Prince, not Cinderella, who gets the traditional musical theatre “want song” at the beginning, and the fantasy he imagines in it (“Why Can’t I Be Two People?”) is of course mirrored perfectly when Cinderella arrives at the ball disguised as a titled lady. Her establishing song, “Once I Was Loved,” on the other hand, sung after the death of her father, while melancholy is both resigned and gently defiant. The King’s stylish gavotte, “Protocoligorically Correct,” is hinged on the Shermans’ requisite coinage of a whimsical portmanteau neologism. The love song at the ball, “Secret Kingdom,” is one of the most memorable of all Sherman ballads, with a deceptively simple melody that can stick in your mind indefinitely, and in the most pleasing manner. This is followed by a splendid double soliloquy (“He Danced with Me/She Danced with Me”) that is both lilting and exhilarating. (At the Command Performance the Queen Mother told the songwriters she’d never heard a more beautiful waltz. But then, the Windsors are scarcely noted for their musical perspicacity. Maybe it was the movie’s evocation of royal prerogative that got to her.)\n\nThe masterpiece of this score occurs in its most dramatic moment when to save the crown embarrassment the Lord High Chamberlain urges Cinderella into exile and she, out of love, accepts. “Tell Him Anything” expresses her determination that her prince should, to save him from pining after her, believe anything negative about her except the truth: That she is true to him. The dark, swirling musical accompaniment and the deeply intelligent lyrics with their adroit inner rhymes combine to make a number that is moving and plangent without resort to bathos or emotionalism, and when Cinderella sings, “Tell him anything/But not that I love him” the music’s roiling, agitated state slowly resolves, sadly yet somehow rhapsodically. This is the furthest thing from the sort of cookie-cutter writing original movie musicals so often make do with, in which commonplace emotions are met with generic composition and lyric-writing and which we grudgingly accept because the performers are charming, or the dance they’re doing has some originality or wit. Whenever I hear “Tell Him Anything” I think of Sondheim because it sounds like the sort of thing he might have come up with but which almost none of the people who habitually dismiss them ever expect of the Shermans.\n\nRichard Chamberlain is both in gorgeous fettle and beautiful voice as the Prince, the wonderful Michael Hordern does one of his comic specialties as the dithering king (“Kings never cheat! They adapt to circumstances. But they never cheat!”), Lally Bowers makes a charmingly ditzy queen, Annette Crosbie is captivatingly loopy as the fairy godmother, Kenneth Moore is both pompous and unexpectedly moving as the lord chamberlain, Edith Evans very amusing as the dowager queen (making me wonder what she would have been like in A Little Night Music, had Sondheim and Hal Prince gotten her as they’d wanted), Margaret Lockwood a remorselessly wicked stepmother and Gemma Craven an adorable and vocally glorious Cinderella. Forbes directed in his usual uninspired and realistic fashion, which in a curious way grounds the magical components; there are no big effects, just lovely images with a slight aspect of magic. Each time some supernatural element is released it’s either done in an almost prosaic manner, making the magical quotidian (and vice-versa) or with subtle cuts that work their own legerdemain, as when Cinderella rushes from the palace, gradually losing her finery and returning to her normal state of dress.\n\nTony Imi’s sumptuous color cinematography is an asset, as are Angela Morley’s musical arrangements and, operating on a minimal budget, the production design of Raymond Simm, the art direction by Bert Davey and, especially, Julie Harris’ lush costumes, which reach their apogee in the ball sequence, designed and executed in subtle, mouth-watering pastels. One might cavil that in the sequence late in the picture where Cinderella sings the rueful “I Can’t Forget the Melody,” the imagery is a nearly exact duplicate of Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s “L’Escarpolette” and thus more than a bit studied, but what bothers me most about it is that the sumptuous costuming and decor seem entirely out of character for Cinderella, even if the royals are footing her bills. This is the price one pays when a director becomes determined to create a visual effect for its own sake (and for his own obsessive reasons) regardless of whether it makes any sense for the movie he’s making.\n\nIn spite of that notable lapse on Forbes’ part, however, I was flabbergasted to read in his Movies on TV this comment by Steven M. Scheuer: “An air of desperation hangs over everything.” What movie did he see? The thing is so sure-footed, so beautiful, so entrancing, and so casually magical that “desperation” is the last word I can imagine using to describe it.\n\nAs Crosbie’s Fairy Godmother assures Cinderella before her appearance at the ball: “No one will recognize you for what you are. People seldom do.”\n\nThe original Disney Cinderella was, I think, the first movie my sister and I were taken to a theater to see, on its 1965 reissue. I certainly remember seeing it, and being given the Gold Key comic book reprint that summer as part of my reading material (or perusing, at any rate; I was only 4-and-a-half) during the family’s annual auto trip to Florida to visit our maternal grandparents. My sibling received the “Magic Mirror” Disneyland LP for her birthday that year, but I suspect I listened to it more often than she did; I loved the sped-up voices of the mice singing the “Work Song” and their own version of “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” as well as “So This is Love,” the brief, curiously and effectively low-key (and minor-keyed) duet for the Prince and Cinderella at the ball… although what I chiefly remembered from the movie itself were the King and the Grand Duke bouncing into the air on the monarch’s absurdly enormous mattress. What child of four couldn’t envy their being able to bounce on that bed, fly practically to the castle ceiling, and float safely back down? Never mind that the King is doing his best to decapitate the Duke; it was the bouncing that mattered.*\n\nCinderella was Disney’s savior in 1950, when after years of dismal featurettes and make-work government contracts the studio was facing a financial reckoning, and the possible dissolution of its animation unit, the bedrock on which Walt had built the company. Perhaps to keep the costs down, the picture isn’t as visually impressive as some of its predecessors (and successors) and the song score is one of the studio’s briefest. Although Disney’s animated features are not, strictly speaking, full musicals on the same scale as their Broadway and East End counterparts — until Babes in Toyland and Mary Poppins Disney pictures were more full-length stories with a few songs — they’re still musicals. Cinderella‘s song-stack is roughly on a par with that in Snow White or Pinocchio, or the similarly minimalist Dumbo. There are only four major melodies (“So This is Love,” “Sing, Sweet Nightingale,” “Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo” and “A Dream…”) plus a fractional fifth (the “Work Song”) which segues into the murine edition of “A Dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes,” a number I can never contemplate without remembering the “Fresh Air” Classical music critic Lloyd Schwartz relating that a friend of his had once called it the most frightening title he’d ever heard.† Its lyrical relation to “When You Wish Upon a Star” doesn’t bear too close a comparison either, although I do like the couplet “Have faith in your dreams and someday/Your rainbow will come smiling through,” which whatever you think of its oversold optimism is a nice piece of minor poetry. I’m not sure, speaking of this score, what astonishes me most: That all of its songs were by the same three-man team (Mack David, Jerry Livingston, and Al Hoffman), that the only other number they ever placed for a Disney picture was “The Un-Birthday Song” in Alice in Wonderland, or that Hoffman and Livingston also wrote “Mairzy Doats.”\n\nIn adapting Charles Perrault’s version of the Giambattista Basile story, it was a smart idea of the Disney writers (who included Bill Peet, Ted Sears, Ken Anderson, Winston Hibler and Joe Rinaldi) to focus much of the humor, and the suspense, of the picture on Cinderella’s mice. In classical versions of the story it’s birds who come to the slave-girl’s aid but small birds don’t have the capacity for stealth that mice do, or a place inside a mansion’s walls, and pitting the mice against the Stepmother’s evil, pampered cat (not incidentally named Lucifer) is an inspired stroke. Of the three versions of Cinderella written about here, only the Disney edition has a firm and elaborate visual grasp on fantasy, and the means (animation) by which to best express it. Additionally, and unlike almost all recent Mouse House product, schizophrenically made with one eye on each new heroine’s spunky feminist/”Woke” bona fides and the other on crafting an ageless new “Princess” to add to the marketing lineage, there was no art-by-committee finagling in 1949; generations of girls and boys loved this Cinderella for her natural ebullience, her love of animals, and her complete lack of self-pity. (Would they have loved her quite so much if she’d also been carrying banners?) It’s that last item that makes the treatment of her before the ball by her step-family so horrific, and her reaction to it so harrowing: Having her dress, lovingly augmented by her mice and bird friends, torn to ribbons also shreds her ability to believe; when she runs out to the garden weeping, her faith in dreams shattered, she thinks, beyond repair, it’s heart-rending. Yet the slow gathering around her of the mice, the bloodhound Bruno and the draft-horse Major, drawn by her uncharacteristic outpouring of pain and need, suggest the deep love she conveys to them, and that they feel for her, and it is this as much as the unexpected appearance of Cinderella’s kindly Fairy Godmother that makes it such a heartfelt and memorable sequence. Here too the music does wonders to convey the dramatic intensity of the scene, the chorus singing back her own words (“Have faith in your dreams, and someday…”) which Cinderella now fights against, thinking herself a fool for that belief.\n\nCinderella’s despair represents the moment when even she, for all her sunniness and optimism, reaches the end of her ability to take the abuse her stepsisters dole out to her. Yet as vicious as the girls are (and as physically repulsive — their animator, Ollie Johnson, really lays on their ugliness) they take their cues from the truly horrid Lady Tremaine, the Frank Thomas-animated stepmother both modeled on the physiognomy of the actress Eleanor Audley and memorably voiced by her. Audley later inspired the design of, and provided the voice for, Maleficent in the 1959 Sleeping Beauty, but even that evil fairy and erstwhile fire-breathing dragon is not as nasty, or as frightening to a child, as Lady Tremaine, and Thomas’ rendering of her is a tour de force of symbolized character animation, as when she is shown obliquely through the shadows of her huge canopy bed, giving increasingly onerous cleaning instructions to her stepdaughter with a brutality that is almost shocking in its undisguised psychosis. She’s like a large animal of prey, revealing her teeth in a hideous smile. Although Margaret Lockwood in The Slipper and the Rose is also vicious, of all the Wicked Stepmothers in this survey Lady Tremaine is the one who seems most likely to one day draw real blood. If she hasn’t already.\n\nCinderella, as was often the case with Disney’s feature animation, benefited from live-action reference — which is not the same thing as rotoscoping — and Helene Stanley was the perfect model for the girl, graceful without becoming a caricature of grace, while Ilene Woods’ unemphatic vocal performance, which includes both her speaking and her singing, makes her among the most winning of all Disney heroines. Thanks to the then-new technique of over-dubbing pioneered by Les Paul, Disney was able to produce the gorgeous sequence in which a growing series of bubble reflections of Cinderella replicate her vocalizations as she rescues the voice-and-flute exercise “Sing, Sweet Nightingale” from the clutches of her tone-deaf stepsisters while scrubbing the Tremaine mansion’s vast hall floor. The sound of her voice going from solo to duet to trio to quartet is not merely a clever touch, or a pleasing musical number but a perfect representation of character. Faced with pointless labor imposed on her by a practiced sadist, the girl’s outlook somehow remains cheerful. Neither is she a happy idiot grinning at adversity; her character — gentle, optimistic, dreamy yet not insipid — is as fixed in Cinderella as Lady Tremaine’s genteel savagery is in her.\n\nAll of Disney’s “Nine Old Men” (Johnston, Thomas, Marc Davis, Eric Larson, Les Clark, Milt Kahl, Ward Kimball, John Lounsbery and Wolfgang Reitherman) worked on the picture, which I feel certain, accounted at least in part for its specialness. Davis’ design of Cinderella, and his work animating her, informs our impressions; his brief sequence of transformation, in which her rags become a resplendent ball gown, is among the most magical such moments in American animation. Fortunately, the people of 1950, both those who worked on this movie and the audience for it, didn’t demand that a fairy tale character, whose fullest flowering was in Europe, earn her studio ESG points or a high social-credit score. They understood implicitly that the leading character in a story derived from a French fable would be Caucasian, and that her being white was not a deliberate snub to any other group. (Christ, but I get tired of this game, and of wondering whether new readers of these pages do or do not automatically presume I’m some sort of bigot for my enjoyment of yet another old movie with no inherent prejudices except that of trying to entertain the largest possible audience of its time. Why do I get the feeling that merely liking these versions of Cinderella automatically puts me — if you’ll forgive the pun — beyond the pale?)\n\nKahl was responsible for the direction of the childishly mercurial King, his milquetoast Grand Duke and, most memorably, for the design and animation of the soft, kind, lovely old Fairy Godmother, modeled on Mary Alice O’Connor and beautifully voiced by Verna Felton, while Kimball, Reitherman and Lounsbery supervised the animation of the mouse heroes Jaq and Gus. Reitherman, whose special forte was action, animated the almost excruciatingly tense sequence of Jaq and Gus retrieving the key to Cinderella’s room and dragging it up the attic stairs. (The special-effects man Jimmy MacDonald, Walt’s replacement as the voice of Mickey Mouse, had his recordings sped up for both Jaq and Gus.) Larson and Clark are credited as the pictures’ supervising animators and the overall directors were Wilfred Jackson, Hamilton Luske and Clyde Geronimi. Kimball also worked on Lucifer and provided the great moment when, realizing he’s trapped Gus under a teacup, the cat sticks out his tongue and waves his paws around in a crazy parody of feline ecstasy.\n\nSpeaking of Lucifer: There’s a disturbing moment near then end when, chased to the upper window outside Cinderella’s tower bedroom by Bruno, he falls, presumably to his death. I wonder why I didn’t remember that from childhood? Perhaps I blocked it.\n\nAs always with Disney, it’s the small things that resonate with you, and which add to your pleasure. When, after her midnight escape from the ball Cinderella explains to her animal friends how it felt to dance with the Prince, Gus leans in against Jaq in second-hand romantic bliss and Jaq, without thinking, places his arm around the rotund mouse and holds him close before coming to his senses and glaring at his friend in annoyance. Naturally, literalists now see in this charming, harmless moment of amusement a declaration of sexuality; according to the understandably pseudonymous “A.X.S,” writing speciously in The Economist, these characters are “not so much gay as queer,” while The Disney Company itself in its needless live-action 2015 “remake” of Cinderella, turned Jaq into “Jacqueline” because God forbid female fantasy mice behave in a traditional manner in a goddamned fairy tale. The sex-change (if you’ll pardon the expression) also got around that pesky little homoerotic joke of 1950, thus perfectly illustrating how Disney, currently embroiled in a pointless controversy with the governor of Florida over, among other things, an educational bill deliberately misinterpreted and cynically mis-named by the reactive “Woke,” likes to play things both ways.\n\nText copyright 2023 by Scott Ross\n\n*Most Disney Princes are colorless, but the one in Cinderella is barely even there. If it wasn’t for “So This is Love” (in which his singing was provided by Mike Douglas) he’d have no dimensions at all.\n\n†A sixth number, “Cinderella,” is heard beneath the main titles, but apart from its being sung by Marni Nixon (as herself for once) it’s a bore.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSee also:\n\nPart One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Three\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/11/the-magic-factory-part-three-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-screenwriters-screenwriting-and-screenplays/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nVII. Specific Movies\n\n“Making-Of” books are a fairly recent phenomenon, although a handful were published in the 1950s. They seem, as a genre, to have gotten a boost in the early ’70s from the success of Jerome Agel’s massive (and, to me, unreadable) The Making of Kubrick’s 2001. Herewith a few of the better ones.\n\n73. Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho Stephen Rebello (1998)\n\nRebello does an exceptional job of illuminating the history of Psycho from Robert Bloch’s short story “The Real Bad Friend” and the later novel through Hitchcock’s interest in it and the writing by Joseph Stefano of the screenplay to the filming itself, a deliberate attempt by the director to make a theatrical hit on a television budget, and with a television crew. I use the word “exceptional” above because Rebello was not writing a contemporaneous account of a new movie but sifting through then-nearly 50 year-old records and the memories of the surviving participants.\n\nAmong other things, the author demolishes Saul Bass’ ludicrous claim that he directed the shower sequence, which the credulous had unquestioningly accepted as fact.\n\n74. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Making of Steven Spielberg’s Classic Film Ray Morton (2007)\n\nFew theatrical releases in my lifetime enchanted, and excited, me more than this one, and Morton’s intelligent, thorough account of its making was worth the three-decade wait. His archeological excursions into the authorship of the screenplay, attributed solely to Spielberg, is especially useful. (Among those who worked on it, some of them extensively: Jerry Belson, John Hill, Hal Barwood and Matthew Robbins.) The author is also excellent on the extraordinary special effects, and why they looked so much better than those in the contemporaneous Star Wars. Morton’s is as close as we are likely to get to a definitive history of one of the best pop movies of the 1970s.\n\n75. Close Encounters of the Third Kind Diary Bob Balaban (1977; Reprinted 2003)\n\nBalaban — whom theatregoers might have remembered as Linus in the Off-Broadway musical You’re a Good Man, Charlie Brown and moviegoers would have recalled as the boy in Midnight Cowboy who blows Jon Voight in the movie theatre — got himself cast in CE3K in the time-honored fashion of actors: He lied. His character, the American interpreter for the scientist played by François Truffaut, was supposed to be fluent in French and Balaban could recall a few phrases from his high school studies; spoken quickly and authoritatively, that was sufficient to fool the casting directors. Balaban’s diary of the filming has a wonderful immediacy and is especially informative on the many weeks of filming in the huge Alabama hangar converted into the Devil’s Tower “Other Side of the Moon” set for the alien landing. His book is one of best glimpses we’ve ever gotten into the day-to-day realities of filming an important popular motion picture, an account written with unusual perceptiveness and wit.\n\n76. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Ultimate Visual History Michael Klastorin (2017)\n\nPublished in conjunction with the long-awaited (by me, at any rate) 40th anniversary theatrical re-release of CE3K, the movie of movies from my late adolescence. A smallish coffee-table book — the best kind, easily read — packed with beautiful color photographs and useful information on one of the most visually ravishing movies of its time. Had Close Encounters entered the market when Steven Spielberg wished, not in the late autumn of 1977 but before the May premiere of Star Wars, it would almost certainly have stolen George Lucas’ thunder, in no small part due to its superior look. Achieved by filming the special effects shots in 35mm and blowing them up to 70, softening the blue-screen edges and permitting the marriage of backgrounds and effects to appear seamless, this process had the subsequent effect of making Vilos Zsigmond’s muted cinematography look even more impressive than what Lucas and his team had unveiled earlier in the year.\n\nSee also: Encounters of the Third Kind: A Document Of The Film (1977) A beautiful contemporaneous trade paperback published by Ballantine with a lovely introduction by Ray Bradbury.\n\n77. Final Cut: Dreams and Disaster in the Making of Heaven’s Gate Steven Bach (1985)\n\nBach was one of the executives at United Artists (senior vice-president and head of worldwide production) as Michael Cimino was filming his epic about the Johnson County wars, and intimately involved in approving the picture for shooting. Although he is critical in the book of his own failings during the making of the movie whose budget overruns (and subsequent poor box-office performance) more or less destroyed UA, some — including Pauline Kael in her review of the book for the New Yorker — felt he let himself off the hook too easily. But in a story like this, there are always multiple points of view, and many directions from which fingers can and will be pointed. I have never seen Heaven’s Gate, so I can’t speak to its merits or defects, but a friend whose opinions I value admires it enormously and thinks the critics who slammed it, pretty much en masse, got it wrong. And United Artists had a history of fucking things up financially before it ever engaged Michael Cimino; in 1970 the men who’d been running it for 20 years were ousted for losing $35 million on bad choices. Studios spend comparable amounts today on catering but 50 years ago that was real money, just as the $44 million spent on Heaven’s Gate was a substantial amount in 1980.\n\n78. The Jaws Log Carl Gottlieb (1975; Updated numerous times to 2012)\n\nThe first book of its kind I purchased with my own money, and one I re-read every few years for the pleasure of its author’s company and the remembered delights of a favorite movie. Gottlieb, who played the Amity Island newspaper editor Meadows, was the credited co-author of the screenplay after Peter Benchley turned in his unacceptable first draft; although he was by no means the last writer to tweak the picture’s dialogue (the playwright Howard Sackler worked on it — the USS Indianapolis monologue was his — as did John Milius, Matthew Robbins and Hal Barwood and the third-billed star Robert Shaw) Gottlieb was on the set by day and working with Spielberg on revisions at night. His version of the filming, while obviously subjective, had the advantage of being fresh, and is about as reliable a narrative as we have of what, to everyone’s surprise, became the highest-grossing of all movies within months of its opening, knocking The Godfather off the top of the list. That fact, and the subsequent shark-like feeding frenzy among Hollywood suits for the next sure thing (which is of course a chimera) led, slowly and inexorably, to the lousy state of things we’ve been living through at the movies for the last four decades. But I for one do not blame Spielberg for that (although he certainly helped dumb things down in the ’80s). Due in large part to the trouble they had making it, for which so much had to be compensated and because of which the actors, their director and their screenwriter had more time than usual in which to improvise dialogue and deepen their characters,* Jaws remains the most beautifully assembled and entertaining of popcorn movies.\n\nGottlieb’s revised editions correct his few errors and elaborate nicely on what he’s learned since that he didn’t know in 1975.\n\nSee also: On Location… On Martha’s Vineyard: The Making of the Movie Jaws Edith Blake (1975) and Jaws: Memories from Martha’s Vineyard: A Definitive Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Greatest Suspense Thriller of All Time Matt Taylor (2012) Blake is a Martha’s Vineyard resident, a photographer who wrote a column for the Vineyard Gazette. Her book is packed with the many terrific photographs she took and benefits greatly from her local’s perspective. Taylor’s gorgeous coffee-table style trade paperback benefits from page after page of luscious color photos detailing every aspect and phase of the production.\n\n79. The Magic Factory: How MGM Made An American in Paris Donald Knox (1973)\n\n“MGM” didn’t make An American in Paris, of course; that shorthand takes in the producer, Arthur Freed and his un-credited associate Roger Edens; the director, Vincente Minnelli; the star/choreographer, Gene Kelly; his fellow actors Leslie Caron, Oscar Levant, Nina Foch and Georges Guétary; the screenwriter, Alan Jay Lerner; the lyricist, Ira Gershwin; the music directors, Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green and Conrad Salinger; the cinematographers, Alfred Glik (the film) and John Alton (the ballet); the editor, Adrienne Fazan; the art and set directors, Preston Ames, Cedric Gibbons, F. Keogh Gleason and Edwin B. Willis; the costumers, Orry-Kelly, Walter Plunkett and Irene Sharaff; and the hundreds of technicians, crew, dancers, extras, costumers and artisans MGM employed. Knox’s oral history of one of the most accomplished and pleasurable of all movie musicals is itself a pleasure, and covers with admirable thoroughness every aspect of the production.\n\nSee also: Directed by Vincente Minnelli Stephen Harvey (1990) A very fine and perceptively written coffee-table tome on Minnelli by the late critic and associate curator of film at the Museum of Modern Art. As well as offering his well-considered critical analyses of Minnelli’s movies Harvey also reveals the extent of the director’s visual fussiness: On Some Came Running he had a Ferris wheel moved a few inches, decided he didn’t like it and had it moved back. Although unrelated to Minnelli, I still cherish a critique Harvey made in his Pyramid Illustrated History volume on Fred Astaire in 1975: Writing about Silk Stockings, he cited as a defect of that particular dud the “Novocain-tinged line readings” of Cyd Charisse. Perfect.\n\n80. The Making of The Wizard of Oz: Movie Magic and Studio Power in the Prime of MGM and the Miracle of Production #1060 Aljean Harmetz (1977)\n\nI wish Aljean Harmetz published more books but this one, and her Casablanca study (see below) are worth a barrelful of other, shoddier “making of” volumes. She was the first to assay The Wizard of Oz in depth, and there is almost nothing about that beloved musical soufflé she missed, and little she got wrong. Harmetz traces the history of the picture from the marvelous Baum books to the subsequent popular stage musical of 1902 and the largely forgotten 1925 silent movie (in which Oliver Hardy played the Tin Man) through the first faltering steps toward a new screenplay and on to the composing of the imperishable song score, the designing of the sets and the sometimes-troubled filming itself, speaking to as many survivors as were able and willing to talk. (The Introduction was written by that most adorable of witches, Margaret Hamilton, about whom I have never heard a bad word.) People seeking an avalanche of color photos can look elsewhere. If you want the goods on how Oz was made, this is your book.\n\nSee also: The World of Entertainment!: Hollywood’s Greatest Musicals Hugh Fordin (1975) Speaking of MGM, if you enjoy movie musicals you may wish to avail yourself of the late Hugh Fordin’s fascinating history of the Arthur Freed unit, which along with some appalling dross did indeed produce the greatest of them after the glory days of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at RKO and before the advent of Cabaret and Fiddler on the Roof: The Wizard of Oz, Cabin in the Sky, Meet Me in St. Louis, The Harvey Girls, Easter Parade, Royal Wedding, An American in Paris, Singin’ in the Rain, The Band Wagon, Gigi. Some spoilsports complained that Fordin’s book was little more than a collection of telegrams and in-house memos, but reproducing these primary sources is a perfectly legitimate, and often illuminating, way of putting together the history of a movie production unit. Besides, most of Rudy Behlmer’s books are collections of similar items and no one complained about that, or needed to.\n\n81. The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman’s Masterpiece Jan Stuart (2000)\n\nAnother splendid oral history, this time of what may have been the most representative American movie of the 1970s. It’s a picture that could only have been filmed by Robert Altman, the exception to nearly all my rules about directors of movies. Although conceived and written by Joan Tewkesbury, Nashville is the ultimate exemplar of its maker’s technical acumen and personal, highly idiosyncratic style. We learn here about the picture’s origins and how Tewkesbury came to write her kaleidoscopic, elliptical screenplay with its 24-character ensemble (the movie was her idea, pitched to Altman while they were working on McCabe and Mrs. Miller) as well as how the roles were cast and the freedom Altman gave his actors, not only to improvise, which was by then the lingua franca of his method, but to compose many of the songs heard in the movie, as well as about the day-to-day exigencies of the location shoot. As with Michael Zuckoff’s later oral biography of Altman, this concatenation of contrapuntal voices is the perfect format to illuminate a movie whose aural imprint is as memorable as its visuals. One of the nicest compliments I can pay Stuart’s book is to say that just talking about it makes me want to read it a second time.\n\nAlthough I hate to keep harping on the defects of Wikipedia (no I don’t, not really) the category into which their Usual Gang of Idiots has dropped this nonpareil is too good not to share: On the page devoted to the movie we learn that Nashville is an “American satirical musical ensemble comedy-drama film.” I suppose we ought to be grateful for how much nettlesome critical thinking these imps of the perverse save us through their obsessive need for categorization.\n\n82. Notes Eleanor Coppola (1979)\n\nYounger people may not credit this, but there were few celebrity figures in the 1970s more compelling than Francis Ford Coppola, and no movie on which more ink was spilled before its premier at the Cannes Film Festival than Apocalypse Now. Everyone who cared even slightly about the present and future of American movies knew that the director and co-writer of The Godfather and The Godfather — Part II (and the writer-director of The Conversation) was shooting an epic vision of the Vietnam war, the most controversial American-directed conflict since our rape of the Philippines 80 years earlier and from which we had only extracted ourselves, bloodied and bowed, a scant few years earlier. That Coppola was refracting his version of the war through the equally vivid nightmare of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness made an intriguing picture sound even more enticing. His wife Eleanor was there throughout, watching and worrying as her husband (and his cast and crew) grew increasingly less and less tethered to reality, as one leading man (Harvey Keitel) was replaced by another (Martin Sheen) who then suffered a near-fatal coronary, and as the entire project threatened to spin crazily out of control and engulf her and everyone she loved. Eleanor Coppola captures all of this and more in spare, limpid prose that limns the everyday and the extraordinary with the same practiced, sometimes coolly imperturbable eye.\n\n83. Outrageous Conduct: Art, Ego and the Twilight Zone Case Stephen Farber and Marc Green (1988)\n\nIn July of 1982 during a night shoot for the multiple-director omnibus Twilight Zone: The Movie, a helicopter crash killed the actor Vic Morrow and two illegally employed Vietnamese children. It was one of the worst, most incompetent and, as we later learned, unconscionable incidents in movie history. Farber and Green followed the case and in their book explicated every sickening detail, including the culpability of the picture’s producer, Steven Spielberg, who instantly distanced himself, in one of the more craven performances of the last 50 years, condemned the director John Landis and desperately downplayed his own involvement. Not that Landis did not deserve opprobrium; in fact he deserved a prison sentence. (Did anyone really expect him to receive one?) He also behaved like an appalling, infantile brat during the trial, which is as revealing of his character as his willingness to endanger the lives of his actors, his technicians, and two small immigrant children.\n\nSee also: Indecent Exposure — A True Story of Hollywood and Wall Street David McClintick 1983. When the wildly successful television executive David Begelman foolishly (and puzzlingly) embezzled petty amounts of cash from, among others, the actor Cliff Robertson, no one outside Begelman’s circle expected to hear about it. Then Robertson went public. The result was one of the great scandals of a scandalous decade. McClintock covers every tawdry feature of a cheap, mystifying affair.\n\n84. Picture Lillian Ross (1952)\n\nThe grandmother of all fly-on-the-wall accounts of moviemaking. Ross followed the filming by John Huston of his and his co-scenarist Albert Band’s adaptation of The Red Badge of Courage and its subsequent dismembering by MGM — which slashed it from two hours to 69 minutes — and published her report first in The New Yorker and later as a book. It’s a classic in a field that hasn’t many masterworks. Huston was the most reproduceable of speakers, and in an accurate account of his speech such as Ross provides the reader can hear his curious, deceptively mellow tones and odd conversational patterns and locutions. (Peter Viertel in White Hunter, Black Heart, his wonderful 1953 roman à clef about the filming of The African Queen, also got Huston absolutely down.)\n\nSee also: Anatomy of a Motion Picture Richard Griffith (1959) An enjoyable, largely photographic, account of the making of Anatomy of a Murder.\n\n85. Put Money in Thy Purse: The Making of Othello Micheál MacLiammóir (1952)\n\nOthello was Orson Welles‘ most protracted movie, shot on multiple continents and filmed over time; it was begun in 1949 but for complex reasons was not completed until 1951, and not exhibited before 1952. (The American release was further delayed, to 1955.) Filming had already begun when the original producer informed Welles he’d run out of money. With no cash and no costumes, the filmmaker shot two crucial reels depicting the murder of Roderigo in a Turkish bath in Morocco while local tailors labored to sew the clothing he needed to proceed. He was forced eventually to stop shooting and earn money to continue, and even then had to work around the schedules of his actors. Out of this grew the erroneous legend that Welles couldn’t complete a project. MacLiammóir, the movie’s inspired Iago, kept a contemporaneous diary that captures the madness of the filming and Welles’ mercurial moods and contradictory impulses as well as his talents and determination in the face of setbacks that would have defeated a lesser man. It’s a tour de force literary performance, one of the inarguably great books on the making of an equally great, if necessarily flawed, motion picture.\n\n“… everything as I see it is against him before he starts, but his courage, like everything else about him, egotism, generosity, ruthlessness, forbearance, impatience, sensitivity, grossness and vision, is magnificently out of proportion.” — MacLiammóir on Welles\n\n86. Roger Moore’s James Bond Diary Roger Moore (1973)\n\nWritten when Moore was filming Live and Let Die, his (if you’ll pardon the seeming oxymoron) maiden effort as James Bond. Whether Moore habitually kept a diary or did so only for one picture, the resulting manuscript is a delightful account of a typically complicated international Bond shoot, nicely illustrated with on-set photos and publicity stills, although as was typical of Fawcett paperbacks of the time you risked tearing the spine apart if you opened the book wide enough to read their captions. (The British edition, published by Pan, contained a different set of photos, most in color. Both are now prohibitively expensive, but the History Press reprinted the book in 2019, with a foreword by David Hedeson, the movie’s Felix Leiter.) I daily await with a certain dread the discovery by the Generation-Z cancel-culture brigade of Live and Let Die, with its hip black villains and sinister depiction of Baron Samedi. Doubtless they will demand Eon burn every extant copy, or get Disney to buy them all and stick them in a subterranean vault with its prints of Song of the South.\n\nMoore was many 007 fans’ least favorite Bond apart from George Lazenby, but I usually found him charming company. So is his book.\n\n87. Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca – Bogart, Bergman, and World War II Aljean Harmetz (1992)\n\nWhat Harmetz did for The Wizard of Oz in 1977 she did again for Casablanca in 1992. She covers, with her usual diligent thoroughness, its origins in the un-produced play Everybody Comes to Rick’s; the complicated saga of the screenplay and its multiple authors; the miracle of its casting; the filming and editing; and the picture’s decades-long legacy which saw a popular wartime romance gradually become recognized as the ultimate movie-movie of the great age of studio filmmaking. Not incidentally, the author also addresses, in detail, the way the government controlled the content of what American audiences saw during the Second World War. Other writers, such as Glenn Frankel, have attempted to do for pictures such as The Searchers and Midnight Cowboy what Harmetz did for two of the most well-loved American of all movies, but no one has come close.† A treasure.\n\n88. A Star Is Born: The Making of the 1954 Movie and Its 1983 Restoration Ronald Haver (1988)\n\nWithout the author’s perseverance, it’s unlikely that A Star is Born would ever have been restored and rediscovered. Granted there were gaps in the footage that were only partially mitigated in the restored version by fuzzy outtakes and still photographs. But a minor masterpiece of Hollywood craft had, like Lawrence of Arabia, been cut, and cut again, although at least Lawrence got a full release at its original length; A Star is Born was shorn of far too much footage before its premiere, and Jack L. Warner showed so little faith in it that he had it eviscerated again after less than a month in theatres. (Perversely, Warner had also demanded that more footage be added to a movie that was already too long: The unnecessary “Born in a Trunk” number, which none of the creators of the movie had a hand in.) Haver’s essential book not only covers, with remarkable thoroughness, the development and filming of the movie but his own, only partly successful search for the lost footage and soundtrack. In this case, however, a partial success was still more than anyone could have hoped, or expected. If only for the restoration of the wonderfully written, beautifully shot and charmingly acted marriage proposal sequence on the soundstage, unseen for decades, we owe him.\n\nVII. Miscellaneous\n\n89. Are You Now or Have You Ever Been: The Investigation of Show Business by the Un-American Activities Committee, 1947-1956 Edited by Eric Bentley (1972)\n\nAlthough this small volume is essentially a playscript adapted by Bentley from his own, much longer book on the House Committee on Un-American Activities Thirty Years of Treason, it’s a perfect vest-pocket history of the hearings and the misery they merrily visited upon American citizens for the accused beliefs. In this pared-down version the veteran dramatist Bentley highlights some of the more memorable witnesses such as Marc Lawrence, who claimed he joined the Party to pick up girls; Paul Robeson, who chopped the Committee down to size but was its victim anyway; Sterling Hayden, who ratted on others at the urging of his analyst and loathed himself forever after for it; that dissembling rat Elia Kazan; Lillian Hellman, who with her lawyer cannily (and memorably) extricated herself from having to testify; Zero Mostel, who was clever enough to gentle himself off the hook (but who was blacklisted all the same); and of course the drama’s central tragic figure, Larry Parks, the unconscionable bullying of whom into informing on others against his will remains a stain on our national character and institutions. But then, the hearings were largely a matter of, in no particular order, vengeance against Roosevelt, scare-tactics in aid of building a National Security State, anti-Semitism and the totalitarian impulse with its attendant sadistic delight in forcing others to bend to the will of petty martinets drunk on temporary power.\n\nThere seems to be an un-organized movement afoot among many Millennials these days to deify these bastards and to pretend that a few ineffectual Communist cells in Hollywood somehow poisoned the American character. It goes hand in hand with the new intolerance of alleged leftists who seek to call anyone who disagrees with them a racist, a Nazi, a Putin-puppet or, saints preserve us, “an anti-vaxxer.” Bentley’s book is a needed corrective. Now, how can we get these mindless lickspittles to read it?\n\nSee also: Thirty Years of Treason: Excerpts from Hearings Before the House Committee on Un-American Activities 1938-1968 Eric Bentley (1971) The mother-lode: 1,000-plus pages of testimony.\n\n90. City of Nets: A Portrait of Hollywood in the 1940s Otto Friedrich (1986)\n\nOne of the most compelling narratives about the movie business ever written. Friedrich begins his portrait with the old-fashioned triumph of Gone with the Wind (1939) and ends, a decade and a world war later, with the Grand Guignol cynicism of Sunset Boulevard (1950). Nothing escapes his notice, from the sexual epistemology of the Hollywood closet and assimilated Jews worrying that focusing on anti-Semitism and the plight of European Jewry will bring unwanted goysische attention to themselves, to Joseph L. Mankiewicz despairing of the sub-literate ignorance around him and the arrogance of Walt Disney, presuming to teach his fellow citizens about concert music about which he himself was staggeringly obtuse. Among this magnificent book’s strengths is its author’s knowledge about, and ability to limn, the émigré community of largely German expatriates, most but not all of them Jewish, some of them (like Thomas Mann) giants struggling to eke out a living, as the late Martin Greif put it in one of his once-annual Gay Engagement Calendars, in the land of Pygmies. If, as they like to say in the ad biz, you read only one book about Hollywood, it should be this one. I regard it, without hesitation, as not only the finest book on Hollywood I’ve ever read but the best of all books about the movies.\n\n91. The Genius of the System: Hollywood Filmmaking in the Studio Era Thomas Schatz (1988)\n\nSchatz’s impeccably researched and forcefully written book is perhaps the ultimate refutation of auteurism. Taking off from the critic André Bazin’s commentary that one ought to praise American cinema “for what is most admirable, i.e., not only the talent of this or that filmmaker, but the genius of the system,” the author illuminates how that system worked, and who was most responsible for the classics that occasionally emerged from the various factories: Surprise, Mr. Sarris! The producers.\n\n92. Haywire Brooke Hayward (1977)\n\nI considered placing this one in my round-up of actor biographies but I include it here because Hayward takes in so many Hollywood personalities and so much cultural history of her youth and childhood that her book transcends the personal memoir and becomes something of a collective biography. Born to the agent and theatrical producer Leland Hayward and the charming screen actress Margaret Sullavan, she and her siblings were caught in a maelstrom that also included on the periphery Henry, Jane and Peter Fonda, a family whose sad, creepy dysfunction rivals that of the Haywards. Brooke’s sister Bridget was a probable suicide at 21 and her brother Bill finally succumbed, years after this book was published, shooting himself in the heart. Tolstoy was right, as he so often was, about unhappy families; Hayward’s book may be recommended to anyone who still maintains a childlike faith in the annealing powers of fame and money.\n\n93. A Heart at Fire’s Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann Steven C. Smith (1991)\n\nHerrmann had long been in need of a comprehensive, sympathetic and erudite biography, and in Smith he got all that and more. The giant on whose shoulders so many, both major and minor, have stood, Herrmann brought to Hollywood a radical approach to scoring movies; it’s more than appropriate that his initial movie score should not only be for his friend and radio collaborator Orson Welles, but for that most radical of talking pictures, Citizen Kane. More than anyone else in movies, Herrmann concentrated on orchestral color rather than themes and motifs and only he, I think, could have composed what he called the “black-and-white score” for Psycho; certainly only he would have written it solely for strings. Although he could be bombastic — there are moments in his otherwise lovely score for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir that set my teeth on edge, and his last, Taxi Driver, is largely over-emphatic and often hysterical — his was a singular talent; it’s impossible now to imagine certain movies (Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Hangover Square, On Dangerous Ground, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, North by Northwest, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, Psycho, Jason and the Argonauts, Marnie) without his music. An explosive, highly-strung artist, Herrmann often clashed with his colleagues, even with the imperious Alfred Hitchcock. It was the composer, for example, who averred, against the instincts of the director, that the crop-dusting sequence in North by Northwest should be assembled without music until its climax, and who insisted that the Psycho shower scene must have it. That one stood as perhaps the most famous piece of music composed for a major American movie since the Max Steiner “Tara’s Theme” in Gone with the Wind, and until John Williams’ equally unsettling theme for the Great White shark in Jaws. Smith’s biography of the man who virtually defined the word “irascible” is full of splendid insights and striking details. One among many: His description of Herrmann in the ’70s scouring Manhattan record store soundtrack holdings for bootlegs of his scores and banging angrily on the bins with his cane when he found one.\n\n94. It Don’t Worry Me: The Revolutionary American Films of the Seventies Ryan Gilbey (2003)\n\nI regard two eras in American movies as our finest: The 1930s (at least once the technicians mastered the soundtrack and freed the camera again) which in spite of the reactionary Catholic domination of film via the Production Code saw such wonders in comedy, drama, melodrama, thriller and social polemic as (to take only 1931 into consideration) City Lights, Little Caesar, The Front Page, The Public Enemy, Monkey Business and Frankenstein. No one would suggest that all the pictures of the decade were as adult, witty, sophisticated, daring and critical of social norms as the best of them, but the ’30s was the period when the movies grew up and burst their chains, despite the efforts of small minds to contain them. In the creatively comparable era of the ’70s it was only the public’s desire for the conformity of the sure thing, and the studios’ concomitant eagerness to replicate the contours of what had been successful, that pretty much put an end to personal movies made by serious writers, actors and filmmakers. It is astonishing that someone as young as Ryan Gilbey, who was four years old when Taxi Driver was released in 1976 and who missed nearly all of the important pictures he writes about so knowledgeably, and beautifully, when they were new could write a book this good about an era he had to catch up with at Bfi screenings and on video as a young man. When I add that he is British, it should go some way toward conveying my surprise and delight with this, the best book on 1970s American movies I’ve ever encountered.\n\nSee also: Hollywood Films of the Seventies: Sex, Drugs, Violence, Rock ‘n’ Roll & Politics Seth Cagin and Philip Dray (1984) This small book was, until It Don’t Worry Me, not only the best available volume on ’70s cinema but virtually the only one. It’s still a splendid and insightful title.\n\n95. Movie Comedy Teams Leonard Maltin (1970; reprinted in 1973 and 1985)\n\nA breezy overview of a dozen major teams from Laurel and Hardy to Martin and Lewis, touching as well on some minor ones (Noonan and Marshall, anyone?) by a professional fan with an ear for the telling phrase. In addition to the dozens of wonderful black-and-white photographs, Maltin also provides complete filmographies and biographical details that make this one of the more pleasurable books of its kind.\n\nFor the longest time I thought that beautiful cover on the 1973 reissue as well as the one on Marjorie Rosen’s Popcorn Venus were the work of Richard Amsel. However, the gifted artist and Amsel expert Adam McDaniel informs me that both were by Ann Meisel.\n\n96. Naming Names Victor Navasky (1980)\n\nNavasky, then the editor of The Nation, later its publisher (back when it was still true to its roots as a radical publication and not yet another compromised house organ for the DNC) was perhaps as a result the perfect man to write what for many years was the definitive book on the Hollywood Blacklist. I’ve read numerous volumes on the subject both before the 1980 publication of Naming Names, and in the four decades since, and none has exhibited more erudition, social-historical acumen or unsentimental compassion. This is a subject which in the years since the Clinton campaign launched its phony accusations of “Russian collusion” against her opponent has become, to my astonishment, current again.\n\nSee also: Tender Comrades: A Backstory of the Hollywood Blacklist Patrick McGilligan and Paul Buhle (1997) An extremely informative collection of interviews with survivors of the 1950s Red Scare including Norma Barzman, Walter Bernstein, Alvah Bessie, Betsy Blair, Jeff Corey, Jules Dassin, Faith Hubley, Marsha Hunt, Paul Jarrico, Mickey Knox, Mill Lampell, Ring Lardner Jr., Karen Morley, Abraham Polonsky, Martin Ritt and Lionel Stander.\n\n97. Double Life Miklós Rózsa (1989) Rózsa was one of the masters, not only of 20th century movie scoring but of concert forms as well; hence the title of his memoir, taken from one of the MGM pictures for which he provided his distinctive Hungarian folk-laced musical scores. Notable among composers for his erudition and wit (in several languages!), Rózsa was suited, perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, to writing a book as informal, and informative, and as charming, as this one.\n\nWhy, if you don’t know him, you should:\n\nConcert works: Theme, Variations and Finale; Three Hungarian Sketches; Rhapsody for cello and piano; The Vintner’s Daughter – twelve variations on a French folk song; Violin Concerto; Piano Concerto; Spellbound Concerto; Sonata for guitar\n\nMovie scores: The Jungle Book (1942), Double Indemnity (1944), The Lost Weekend (1945), Spellbound (1945), The Killers (1946), The Red House (1947), Madame Bovary (1959), Quo Vadis (1951), Ivanhoe (1952), Julius Caesar (1953), Lust for Life (1956), Ben-Hur (1959), El Cid (1961), The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973), Time After Time (1979), Eye of the Needle (1981), Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982)\n\nMasterworks: The Thief of Bagdad (1940), The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (1970, score based on his Violin Concerto), Providence (1977)\n\nSee also: No Minor Chords: My Days in Hollywood André Previn (1991) A teenage prodigy, Previn began working in the MGM music department at 16 and was composing for films at 17. Although he turned his back on movie scoring in favor of conducting concert music, in spite of four Academy Awards (and 13 nominations; we may not presume that an Oscar is a sign of quality, but those numbers are impressive) his “Days in Hollywood” certainly made an impression on him. Reading his book is like listening to him speak: A pleasure. In addition to illuminating the corners of his own creative life, at MGM and elsewhere, Previn is often wickedly funny about others, as when he quotes Frederick Loewe’s staggering musical pretension; his own stunned reaction at witnessing, just before intermission of the flop Alan Jay Lerner-Leonard Bernstein musical 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the shadow of Abraham Lincoln ominously crossing the stage and thinking to himself, “I’m going mad”; and, on being asked to meet with Michael Eisner to discuss a continuation of Fantasia and discovering the Disney CEO wanted him to arrange an entire soundtrack of Beatles instrumentals.\n\n‘Tis a mad world, my masters.\n\n98. Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood Mark Harris (2009)\n\nWith this book Harris, at the time the only notable writer aside from Stephen King at Entertainment Weekly (or, as it is known in my home, Ew!) hit on a notion so good and so obvious in retrospect it’s amazing no one thought of it before: Examining the five Oscar nominees for Best Picture in 1967, the year that changed the contours of the movie business more than any since the advent of the talkies. The nominees represented the warring taste of American moviegoers, or at least how they were perceived by the studios: The well intentioned, feel-good-about-how-unbigoted-you-are-when-your-white-daughter-snags-Sidney-Poitier Stanley Kramer picture (Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner); the overblown musical/”family” film, a flop the studio flogged so relentlessly it almost had to get a nod (Doctor Dolittle); the phenomenally successful youth comedy directed by a theatre and movie wünderkind (Mike Nichols’ sophomore effort The Graduate); the witty whodunnit with a social conscience (In the Heat of the Night); and the most radical alternative movie of the year (Bonnie and Clyde). Harris guides the reader through the thickets of America’s late-’60s cultural divide, plots with admirable meticulousness how each picture was developed, made, marketed and received, and draws his irrefutable conclusions in a way that will keep even the most knowledgeable of readers riveted. Pictures at a Revolution is one of the few genuinely great new books on American movies produced so far this century.\n\n99. Roadshow: The Fall of Film Musicals in the 1960s Matthew Kennedy (2014)\n\nFollowing only five years after Mark Harris’ landmark study was another wonder, a book on a subject that on the surface should have attracted, as writer and reader, only a fan besotted by Julie Andrews and Barbra Streisand but which, to my almost shocked surprise and pleasure, was a serious, thorough, wonderfully written examination of a long-gone cultural phenomenon that, in its day and after the success of The Sound of Music, became the holy grail of every American movie studio: The roadshow musical. “Roadshows” were big-budget movies, usually in (as Cole Porter had it) glorious Technicolor, breathtaking CinemaScope and stereophonic sound that before general release at (as they then said) “popular prices” were exhibited in select cities on a reserved-seat basis, and were often accompanied by overture, intermission entr’acte and post-show “exit music.” One after another of these pictures flopped at the box office, some (Sweet Charity, Darling Lili) undeservedly, until the accumulated disaster pretty much killed off the movie musical. Kennedy is splendid company, witty and thoughtful by turns, and admirably thorough.\n\n100. Walt’s Time: From Before to Beyond Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman (1998)\n\nOne of the rarest of movie books to locate, and one of the most delightful. I have long felt the Shermans severely underrated as songwriters, but what isn’t widely enough known is how essential they were to the scripts of the pictures for which they wrote their literate yet accessible numbers. Mary Poppins is the classic example of a movie for which Richard (music and lyrics) and Robert (mostly lyrics) developed the story before Disney assigned a screenwriter, and the one that perhaps most fully expressed both their sensibility and his. They didn’t always operate at top of their game (who does?) either at Disney or, later, elsewhere, but they were right more often than they were wrong. The Shermans’ beautiful book celebrates a time and an opportunity they knew they were lucky to be chosen for, and to seize. Like its gently punning title and the brothers’ own penchant for merging old, ordinary words into entirely new and enchanting ones, Walt’s Time is a charming thing. I will resist the impulse to say it’s supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, but you are free to do so.\n\n*All, ironically, except Gottlieb’s own role, which got smaller with each revision, until it was comprised of a couple of lines in one brief scene: The one on the ferry, in which Roy Scheider’s Chief Brody is browbeaten into not closing the beaches after the girl’s death.\n\n†In addition to imposing anachronistic 21st century slang on events of the past, Frankel also makes far too easily-corrected factual errors, and mis-readings both of source material and finished film — errors which without a doubt will be repeated in the future by other lazy writers.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nContinuing my reluctant withdrawal from moviegoing, due to perpetual disappointment both with new work and with the new theatre audience — neither of which seems to be improving; indeed, the latter now infects every performance venue in the land — I saw only two pictures in a theatre last year… and they were from"
