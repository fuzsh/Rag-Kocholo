For government to be truly representative, it is Important that every eligible voter cast a ballot today. We recapitulate below the recommendations this newspaper has made to the voters in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Asterisks denote incumbents, although as a result of the redistricting of many Congressional and state legislative districts incumbents may be running in districts with numbers different from their present ones.

Voters are asked to authorize the State to borrow $1.15 billion for improving the quality of its water and air, for reserving unspoiled stretches of land and for promoting improvements in waste disposal systems. We recommend a YES vote.

Amendments

The fitst amendment would permit the State Legislature to provide some flexibility in fixing the terms district attorneys outside New York City. Vote YES. The second amendment would have the effect of precluding a new state constitutional convention in the reasonably near future. Vote NO.

The third amendment would create a special judicial department for Nassau and Suffolk Counties, but this would run counter to needed unification of the state's courts.’ Vote NO.
