        "text": "I consider myself a bit of an expert of cult and exploitation movies, but I had no idea that Herschell Gordon Lewis's 1970 schlock horror film \"The Wizard of Gore\" had a connection to Rockford.\n\nBut, as you can see from the image above, Rockford's own WTVO-17 (then an NBC affilate) was used as a location for the film. Time to give that one a spin in the player!\n\nThe information comes courtesy of the always-fascinating Rockford Rocked Facebook page, which manages to dig up all sorts of photos and pop culture artifacts from Rockford's surprisingly colorful past. I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nAnd if you want to go the extra mile and check out \"The Wizard of Gore,\" it's available on DVD and Comcast InDemand (in the Something Weird section of \"Cutting Edge\" under \"movies.\") Two warnings: One, it's probably gorier than you're expecting, especially for a movie from 1970. And two, it's probably worse than you're expecting. It's just not a very good movie."
