        "text": "It happens to the best of us, we are so focused on the big horror movies coming out that the smaller, better ones with no publicity budget get passed over.\n\nLowlifes (2023)\n\nAvailable on Tubi\n\nThis is a weird and wild horror movie. Mark those words because there are so many twists and turns my head was spinning. Lowlifes is a twist on the hillbilly trope and contains everything you need for a good time.\n\nSynopsis: The survival instincts of a road-tripping family are put to the test when they have no other choice but to stay the night at a remote homestead.\n\nHumane (2024)\n\nVOD\n\nAnother Cronenberg enters the box office race, unfortunately, Caitlin’s movie is being ignored over her brother Brandon’s work. That’s unfair because Humane is well worth a watch and may even be better than her older brother’s Infinity Pool.\n\nSynopsis: In the wake of an environmental collapse that is forcing humanity to shed 20% of its population, a family dinner erupts into chaos when a father’s plan to enlist in the government’s new euthanasia program goes horribly awry.\n\nLovely, Dark and Deep (2023)\n\nAvailable on Tubi\n\nThis one just went undetected and it’s a mystery as to why. Yes, it has its problems but it is a solid and interesting horror movie. Plus it stars Barbarian’s Georgina Campbell who is always great in every role she plays.\n\nSynopsis: Lennon, a new back-country ranger, travels alone through the dangerous wilderness, hoping to uncover the origins of a tragedy that has haunted her since she was a child.\n\nInfested (2024)\n\nAvailable on Shudder\n\nHundreds of real spiders were used in this creature feature which is as pulse-pounding as it is spine-tingling. Great performances and practical effects are just two of the reasons you should watch this French horror movie.\n\nSynopsis: Residents of a rundown French apartment building battle against an army of deadly, rapidly reproducing spiders.\n\nFrogman (2023)\n\nVOD\n\nIt’s been a while since we have had a good found-footage cryptid monster movie. This one is worth a watch if you miss them and it’s not as rudimentary as the poster art would imply.\n\nSynopsis: Three friends in search of the Loveland Frogman finds out that he is more than just a local legend\n\nFounders Day (2024)\n\nVOD\n\nIf you missed this one it’s okay. The marketing on it was horrible and then it disappeared for months before being available on digital. It’s a bit convoluted but still worth a watch. In fact, make this one and Thanksgiving a double feature.\n\nSynopsis: A small town is shaken by a series of ominous killings in the days leading up to a heated mayoral election.\n\nSlay (2024)\n\nAvailable on Tubi\n\nOkay hear me out, this one is actually a hidden gem. It’s unfortunate that no one has seen it especially since it’s filled with plenty of gore, a great homage to Tarantino, and belongs along side some of the best vampire movies. IOf you do decide to watch it, how many Easter eggs did you catch?\n\nSynopsis: After a booking mistake, four drag queens find themselves performing for a mostly unwelcoming crowd, but when vampires attack, the crowd looks to the queens to save the day.\n\nDeparting Seniors (2023)\n\nVOD\n\nThis one came out about the same time as Founders Day. Both are good, but Founders Day came out the victor. This is a fun slasher with a twist and no, it’s not a Blumhouse production.\n\nFollowing an act of bullying, witty high school senior Javier develops psychic abilities which he must use to stop a mysterious serial killer targeting his classmates.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nCan you believe it’s been 21 years since Freddy threw down with Jason? The jury is still out on who won.\n\nThis was the last film in which Robert Englund appeared in makeup as Freddy. It’s unclear when or if Freddy will return to a mainstream film, as there is some debate in the surviving Craven household regarding the character’s copyright. Wes Craven directed the first A Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984.\n\nPitting famous movie monsters against each other in crossover battles isn’t a new concept. Universal embraced this idea and began doing it back in the 1940s with their own IPs. As is the case with Freddy vs. Jason, the films usually had open endings or no clear winner, since everyone has their favorite and doesn’t want them to lose.\n\nInteresting fact about Freddy vs. Jason: James Wan was supposed to direct, but he chose to make Saw instead.\n\nBelow, we have listed some great horror movie (sci-fi) battle films, starting with the birthday boys themselves. These films range from the biggest budgets to the lowest, but all are a great time.\n\nIf you want to check any of them out, go over to JustWatch and search for the title to find your preferred medium.\n\nFreddy vs. Jason (2003)\n\nFreddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees return to terrorize the teenagers of Elm Street. Only this time, they’re out to get each other, too.\n\nAlien vs. Predator (2004)\n\nDuring an archaeological expedition on Bouvetøya Island in Antarctica, a team of archaeologists and other scientists find themselves caught up in a battle between the two legends. Soon, the team realize that only one species can win.\n\nGodzilla vs. Kong (2021)\n\nLegends collide as Godzilla and Kong, the two most powerful forces of nature, clash on the big screen in a spectacular battle for the ages. As a squadron embarks on a perilous mission into fantastic uncharted terrain, unearthing clues to the Titans’ very origins and mankind’s survival, a conspiracy threatens to wipe the creatures, both good and bad, from the face of the earth forever.\n\nDracula vs Frankenstein (1971)\n\nDracula conspires with a mad doctor to resurrect the Frankenstein Monster.\n\nDollman vs. Demonic Toys (1993)\n\nJudith Grey teams with Brick Bardo (Dollman) and his girlfriend Ginger to face the evil Demonic Toys for one final battle.\n\nDinocroc vs Supergator (2010 – TV movie)\n\nCreated in the laboratories of a biotech corporation, two ravenous mega-reptiles level everything in their way. Now, three defenders must try to save the day. Who shall live and who shall die in the battle between Dinocroc and Supergator?\n\nVersus Films: End of an Era or a Fresh Start?\n\nVersus films, where iconic characters face off in epic battles, have always been a fan favorite, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to produce. Legal complexities and character rights often stand in the way, even though audiences love watching these epic showdowns.\n\nHowever, with classic characters entering the public domain, a new era of versus films is emerging. One of the most anticipated versus films is Mickey vs. Winnie in the upcoming horror film MVW, scheduled for release in 2025.\n\nThis film marks the beginning of a new evolution in versus movies, where beloved childhood icons are transformed into nightmarish adversaries in a terrifying battle that will captivate and horrify audiences. The synopsis teases a chilling confrontation in a cursed forest, where innocence and evil collide in a bloody showdown.\n\nHere is a further description of the Mickey Vs Winnie horror film MVW:\n\n“A century ago, two convicts disappeared into Hell Forest, a place feared for its dark legends and whispers of a sinister curse. The mysterious force lurking within the forest feeds on those who dare to enter.\n\nIn the present day, a group of ex-wilderness reform school survivalists, reunited and bound by a shared history of trauma and rebellion, travels back to their abandoned disciplinary teen camp, nestled at the forest’s edge. The desolate school stands as a decaying symbol of their lost innocence, its walls echoing with secrets and forgotten horrors.\n\nAs they step into the eerie corridors of the school and the shadowy depths of Hell Forest, they unknowingly stir the curse that has lain dormant for generations. The school’s long-buried malevolence intertwines with the forest’s ancient evil, feeding off the ex-troubled teens’—now in their 30s—hidden fears and desires, manifesting as two monstrous figures: Dark Mickey and Dark Winnie, once cherished childhood icons now twisted into grotesque nightmares.\n\nThese twisted incarnations, born from the curse and the group’s own inner demons, become locked in a vicious battle. The hellish energy that transformed innocence into horror now seeks to consume the survivalists, forcing them to confront not only the nightmarish creatures but also the dark secrets from their teen years at Camp Misery Bay Reform School.”\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nNot all movie studios put a large part of their budgets into promotions. Movies such as Longlegs, Smile, and Alien: Romulus have allowed their hype departments to do crazy things like put paid actors in public or create Insta-worthy situations, or create social media posts that are so interesting they go viral.\n\nOther productions merely put out a trailer and a few images via press releases and hope the title can speak for itself. Below are some films yet to come in 2024 that you may not know about, and some you do, but they may have fallen off the radar either because they are hyped too soon or simply don’t have the budget for an expansive publicity campaign.\n\nEither way, we are here to whisper in your ear about them because we believe most horror films deserve a chance and the filmmaker’s hard work should be recognized.\n\nAzrael (September 5)\n\nIn a world no one speaks a devout female hunts down a young woman who has escaped her imprisonment. Recaptured by its ruthless leaders, Azrael is due to be sacrificed to pacify an ancient evil deep within the surrounding wilderness\n\nAfrAId (August 30)\n\nThe Curtis’ family is selected to test a new home device: a digital assistant called AIA.

Only this time, the fight isn’t for himself; it’s for his family.\n\nNever Let Go (September 27)\n\nA family that has been haunted by an evil spirit for years. Their safety and their surroundings come into question when one of the children questions if the evil is real.\n\nApartment 7A (September 27)\n\nNew York City, 1965. What happened in the apartment before Rosemary moved in? A struggling dancer finds herself drawn into dark forces by a peculiar couple promising her fame.\n\nHeretic (November 15)\n\nRumored to follow two young women of religion who are drawn into a game of cat and mouse in the house of a strange man.\n\nWerewolves (December 6)\n\nTwo scientists try to stop a mutation that turns people into werewolves after being touched by a super-moon the year before.\n\nTime Cut (TBD 2024)\n\nHigh school student accidentally travels back to 2003 and decides to stop the serial killer who murdered her sister.\n\nLittle Bites (Oct. 4)\n\nIn a desperate attempt to protect her ten year old daughter, a young widow allows a nightmarish monster to slowly eat her alive.\n\nWhistle (TBD-2024)\n\nA misfit group of unwitting high school students stumble upon a cursed object, an ancient Aztec Death Whistle. They discover that blowing the whistle and the terrifying sound it emits will summon their future deaths to hunt them down.\n\nThe Haunting in Wicker Park (TBD-2024)\n\nThe terrifying story of the first televised exorcism on NBC in 1971. The NBC news segment was a success, the exorcism was not. Instead, it made things worse for the Becker family who lived there. Much worse\n\nNote: Synopsises provided by IMDb.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals\n\nTubi‘s TV catalog might be called a graveyard for canceled shows, but a showrunner’s loss is our gain because not only is the streamer free (with ads) but their selection is massive, especially reality shows that have long since left their respective networks.\n\nIn the list below we have selected some highlights from their horror-type reality shows beginning with a classic that jump-started the whole genre.\n\nGhost Hunters\n\nThis original TV reality paranormal team left viewers questioning whether ghosts are real based on the evidence they caught on camera.\n\nThe show originally appeared on SyFy for 12 years which speaks volumes about its influence. It’s since been spun-off and rebooted.\n\nTeam leaders Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson were plumbers who moonlighted as paranormal investigators and subsequently won our hearts as trustworthy and thorough sleuths even going so far as to debunk their own evidence.\n\nAll shows after this one tried to emulate the concept; some were better than others.\n\nKindred Spirits\n\nIf these two paranormal investigators have anything it’s chemistry. Amy Bruni and Adam Berry help people rid their homes of ghost infestations with the help of psychic medium Chip Coffey.\n\nTheir investigations are always entertaining and in their seven seasons on air they have managed to gather some intriguing evidence.\n\nMost Terrifying Places in America\n\nThis documentary series shines some light on America’s most haunted landmarks with testimonies from proprietors and staff.\n\nNot as in-depth as its reality show cousins but if anything it will add to your bucket list of locations to visit if you’re an enthusiast.\n\nParanormal Lockdown\n\nThis is probably the most terrifying show of its type. Nick Groff and Katrina Weidman visit haunted locations where they spend 72 secluded hours together looking for ghostly evidence. It’s revealed that Groff is especially sensitive to evil spirits that wreak havoc on his mental health.\n\nIt’s got everything others of its kind have except high production values and that only adds to its claustrophobic atmosphere.\n\nHaunted Down Under\n\nThis Australian reality show may be low on production values but it’s big on scares. This all-female-led team of cool paranormal investigators search the land down under for video evidence of the afterlife. It’s derivative, but the personalities of its hosts, Nadine, Caitlin, Hailey, and Celine, and their captured findings are truly entertaining.\n\nCelebrity Ghost Stories\n\nIt appears that the Hollywood elite also experience paranormal activity and they aren’t shy about it.\n\nThe premise is simple have stars such as Joan Rivers, Ice-T, or Sammy Hagar sit in a chair and talk about their experiences intertwined with re-enacted footage of their encounters.\n\nIt’s a simple but effective premise.\n\nTrending Fear\n\nEver since journalist Adam Ellis told his personal ghost story to millions of people on Twitter it inspired others to do the same on other social media platforms like TikTok.\n\nEllis visits the people who make these online claims to assist them with their noncorporeal problems while understanding his own in the process. It’s schlocky but it makes for great and interesting ghost stories on a dark and stormy night.\n\n'Alien:Romulus' Theater Merch Unboxing\n\nAKA: Adult Happy Meals"
