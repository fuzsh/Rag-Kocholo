        "text": "-------------------------------------------------------------------- Elliott Stein writes regularly for Film Comment. By ELLIOTT STEIN\n\nRecently the director John Carpenter appeared on the David Letterman television show and presented a clip from his latest film, ''The Thing,'' consisting of special effects footage of an Alaskan husky which has been invaded by an alien life form from outer space.\n\nThe creature was seen writhing and snarling, dripping with repulsive liquid and baring long claws with which it pulled off pieces of a roof until it was dispatched with a flamethrower. The studio audience was audibly entertained by the clip. Mr. Letterman then asked Mr. Carpenter: ''Would you send your 8-year-old child to see the movie?'' The director replied: ''I would evaluate my 8-yearold and then decide. If I was 8 years old I would certainly want to see it.''\n\nAs the director of ''The Thing,'' a horror film opening Friday at local theaters, Mr. Carpenter is scarcely a disinterested party. But as the newest army of monsters, ghouls and yet unnamed creatures creeps and lurches onto the nation's screens, many parents and prospective moviegoers are likely to be doing precisely this kind of evaluating. In a year that has already witnessed Paul Schrader's markedly gory ''Cat People'' and Steven Spielberg's corpse-strewn production of ''Poltergeist'' -and with such films as ''Incubus,'' ''The Evil Dead, ''The Loch Ness Horror,'' ''The Winged Serpent,'' ''Halloween III'' and George Romero's ''Creepshow'' in the offing - it seems timely to inquire into the impact of horror films on their mostly young viewers.\n\nWhat do horror films do to those who see them - not merely to 8-year-olds but to others, especially to adolescents who have more discretion in their moviegoing? Have filmmakers such as Mr. Carpenter, whose R-rated new release is a remake of 1951 film of the same title, and Paul Schrader, who remade the 1942 ''Cat People,'' captured the subtle terror that made those two films cult classics, or have they simply reveled in a new repulsiveness made possible by advances in the art of special effects?\n\nSuch questions become more pertinent as the level of goriness and violence in horror movies escalates. In the older examples of the genre - classics such as ''Frankenstein'' and ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari,'' for example -the fearful ''thing'' was most often set within the context of plots and stories, and the fear itself emerged from the exploration of character or from relationships between the characters and the alien creatures. But, as the audiences' tolerance threshold for chills and thrills went up and the technical capacities to create monstrous and grotesque effects increased, horror films have come to rely more and more on sheer, explicit representations of the ugly and the terrible - and less on psychological fable, artful suggestion and the filmgoer's imagination.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
