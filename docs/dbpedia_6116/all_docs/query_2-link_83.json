Like a group of survivors huddled around a campfire, we will turn to literature and cinema to debate some of the big questions about the future of science, technology, religion, and capitalism. This course is designed as a Critical Speaking Seminar, and the majority of class assignments will be devoted to oral presentations: including a Parliamentary-style debate and a video essay. We will begin by reading some of the early, influential works in the dystopian genre by authors like Mary Shelley, H.G. Wells, and Aldous Huxley. Next, we will explore the paranoid, schizophrenic world of Cold-War-era dystopias by J.G Ballard, Philip K. Dick and Octavia Butler. We will conclude by reading contemporary climate fiction by the likes of Margaret Atwood and Kim Stanley Robinson. Alongside the literary material, we will also track the changing nature of dystopian cinema-- from classics like Metropolis (1927) and La Jetee (1962) to the latest Zombie film. By the end of course, students will have a firm grasp of the history of the genre and will be able to draw on this knowledge to effectively debate issues related to privacy, big business, animal rights, climate change, migration etc.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1521\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0080 Laughter and Tricky Topics\n\nThis course takes a comparative approach to studying the philosophy and praxis of laughter in a variety of artistic media — texts, films, performances and memes. We will seek to develop a critical apparatus to answer the following questions: How does laughter unite us? How does it divide us? How does it contribute to identity and community formation? We will focus on humoristic expression produced in contexts considered too serious for lightheartedness, such as death, race and gender-related oppression, and disenfranchisement. Together, we will wonder whether everything can be a laughing matter, if irony is even funny (and what does it mean anyway?), and whether humor has the potential to effect meaningful sociopolitical change. Our theoretical corpus will include works by Bakhtin, Baudelaire, Bergson, and Freud, who conceptualized laughter in wildly different ways—respectively as carnivalesque, satanic, social, and as a coping mechanism. In the 1940s, René Ménil, a Franco-Caribbean philosopher, synthesized these early theories and further developed them into a means of resistance for colonial subjects. To see these concepts in action, we will engage with materials spanning three centuries, from a short story written by Jonathan Swift to contemporary French comedies (subtitled in English). Should laughter occur throughout the semester, its causes will be dutifully analyzed and presented in diverse oral and written assignments.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0080, FREN 0080\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0085 Representations of Rome in Film and Literature (1848-present) - First Year Seminar\n\nThe myth of Rome as “The Eternal City” stands as one of the longest enduring narratives in Western cultural history, spanning from the 1st century BC to contemporary times. In this course, students will delve into the historical trajectory of this term, with a specific focus on its literary and cinematic representations over the last two and a half centuries. Throughout the semester, fundamental questions will be explored: When and why did this myth originate? How was it politically and rhetorically wielded by historical figures such as Napoleon and Mussolini? Through engagement with an extensive array of sources, ranging from historical documents to literary and cinematic representations, along with 20th-century poetry, students will develop the critical and theoretical tools for the analysis of historical, literary, and cinematic texts. Simultaneously, they will immerse themselves in the history of one of the world’s most enduring urban centers. Commencing with an exploration of the historical roots defining Rome’s designation as “The Eternal City,” the course will progress to an examination of the political exploitation of this myth throughout modern history, starting from the mid 18th-century. Key topics addressed will include representations of Rome during the Grand Tour, the city's transformation from the seat of the Catholic Church to the capital of a modern secular democracy, its pivotal role in the development of fascist culture, its significance during the Second World War and the 1968 student protests, culminating in its contemporary multicultural identity.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 0085\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0088 First-Year Seminar: Italian Histories\n\nTopics vary.

Beginning by exploring theatre techniques to investigate character, relationship and conflict, this class will then focus on identifying the parameters of film & TV scripts of the last five years. Students will learn to identify the primary function of their character within that structure, and to imagine, create, and make playful choices that foster the story being told. By exploring acting techniques that bridge stage and screen, students will gain experience with producing professional self-tapes that reflect current industry standards, understanding the complexity of framing, vocal quality and eyelines in Zoom callbacks, and experimenting with the use of digital media in theatre.\n\nAlso Offered As: THAR 0180\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0201 Sci-Fi Cinema\n\nScience Fiction has been a cinematic genre for as long as there has been cinema—at least since Georges Melies’s visionary Trip to the Moon in 1902. However, though science fiction films have long been reliable box office earners and cult phenomena, critical acknowledgement and analysis was slow to develop. Still, few genres reflect the sensibility of their age so transparently—if often unconsciously—or provide so many opportunities for filmmakers to simultaneously address social issues and expand the lexicon with new technologies. Given budgetary considerations and the appetite for franchises, science fiction auteurs face a difficult negotiation between artistic expression and lowest common denominator imperatives, the controversy over Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985) being perhaps the most infamous example. Nevertheless, many notable filmmakers have done their most perceptive and influential work in the scifi realm, including Gilliam, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven, James Cameron and Alfonso Cuaron. This course will survey the scope of contemporary science fiction cinema, after looking first at seminal works like Metropolis (1927) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that continue to cast their shadow over the genre. We will then devote considerable time to a pair of more modern films, Scott’s Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), which drew from earlier movements (German expressionism, noir), influenced new ones (cyberpunk) and inspired a rare wave of academic discourse. Over the course of the term we will sample smaller, more independent-minded projects, such as Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) as well as higher profile but much more risky epics from filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan.\n\nSpring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0240 Introduction to American and British Film and Media\n\nThis topic course explores multiple and different aspects of Cinema Studies. Specific course topics vary from year to year.

In the first decades of the century, across these territories, radical artistic movements such as suprematist abstraction, productivism, constructivist architecture, Bauhaus modernism, and, finally, Stalinist socialist realism sought to support revolutionary social transformation by literally reshaping the social world and human perception. Cinema, too, played its part—Vladimir Lenin, the Communist revolutionary founder of the Soviet Union, famously said that “of all the arts the most important for us is the cinema.” Propelled by this vision, the early USSR became a laboratory for cutting-edge film that sought to transform viewers into a new kind of person. Yet as the century wore on and Soviet socialism gave way first to state terror and then to moribund bureaucratism and cultural conservatism, it was non-comformist underground artists who took the lead in experimental and politically radical art in the region. Finally, in the post-Soviet era, art and cinema in these territories embraced democratic freedoms and market institutions, before finally, in some quarters, returning to revolutionary roots in response to rising authoritarianism. In this broad survey course, we will trace the history of art and film of the region through a series of case studies, including: Erik Bulatov, Sergei Eisenstein, Miloš Forman, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, Oleg Kulik, Emir Kusturica, El Lilzitsky, Kazimir Malevich, Jiří Menzel, Kira Muratova, Pussy Riot, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova, Dziga Vertov, Andrzej Wajda, and others.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2951, REES 0240\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0275 Montage and Revolution: Conceptual Cinema of Sergei Eisenstein\n\nThe 1917 Russian Revolution was to inaugurate a new epoch in human history. Working with and within this time of political and cultural upheaval, Sergei Eisenstein inaugurated a revolution in montage technique that would usher a new age of cinema, a new practice of art, and a new way of thinking in images. Eisenstein’s cinematic techniques aimed at producing concepts in the language of film. It also sought modes of expression inaccessible to discursive thought. Navigating a tenuous line between art and politics, Eisenstein's works explore the social and political power of affectivity and expressivity, and the cinematic potential for both representing and eliciting emotion in individual viewers and masses alike. In conversation with the tumultuous political and cultural shifts of the Soviet society from the revolutionary 1920s to the age of Stalinism and the World War II, this course will follow Eisenstein’s filmography, from his monumental reconstruction of the revolutionary Petersburg in October to the engagement with representations of history during the Stalinist era in Ivan the Terrible. We will engage with Eisenstein’s theoretical writings, his cartoons and sketches, public speeches, and his lost and unrealized projects, such as his collaboration with Hollywood and a plan to film Marx’s Capital. In this process, we will learn basic tenets of film and aesthetic theory, while practicing the analysis of film with attention to form and content. Following the lead of Eisenstein's artistic and theoretical production, we will engage with questions his work raises: How can cinematography elicit and manipulate the emotions of its viewer? What is expressivity? Can film represent philosophical concepts? What is cinema's relation to propaganda and politics? What is revolutionary about the medium of film, and what is film’s role in the revolution? No prior knowledge of Russian history, culture or society is required, nor is specialized knowledge of film history or film analysis. All readings will be in English, and all films will be subtitled in English.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0275, REES 0275\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0320 Modern Hebrew Literature and Film in Translation\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the rich art of Modern Hebrew and Israeli literature and film. Poetry, short stories, and novel excerpts are taught in translation. The course studies Israeli cinema alongside literature, examining the various facets of this culture that is made of national aspirations and individual passions. The class is meant for all: no previous knowledge of history or the language is required. The topic changes each time the course is offered. Topics include: giants of Israeli literature; the image of the city; childhood; the marginalized voices of Israel; the Holocaust from an Israeli perspective; and fantasy, dreams & madness.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0320, JWST 0320, MELC 0320\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0390 Penn-in-Cannes\n\nPenn-in-Cannes is designed for students interested in the film industry and international cinema. Using the Cannes Film Festival as its focal point, the program examines the ways in which international film functions in the context of celebrity, marketing, and festivals. The scope and substance of the festival provide a unique opportunity, not only for students of cinema, but also for liberal arts students studying cultural diversity and international relations. In preparation for fieldwork at the Cannes Film Festival in May, two introductory lectures will be held in late March and April on Penn's campus to enable students to learn about the business and art of film festival, in particularly Cannes Film Festival, and contemporary international cinema.\n\nSummer Term\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1939\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0518 Benjamin Franklin Seminar: Cinema and Globalization\n\nIn this seminar, we will study a number of films (mainly feature films, but also a few documentaries) that deal with the complicated nexus of issues that have come to be discussed under the rubric of “globalization.” See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 0518, ENGL 0518\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0578 Benjamin Franklin Seminar: The Contemporary Graphic Novel\n\nThis seminar explores the rise of Comics Studies through a focus on the contemporary graphic novel.

Emphasis will be placed on how pantomime was used by filmmaker Charles Chaplin between the years 1914–1940. We shall consider important moments in the history of European pantomime that preceded and influenced Chaplin, then concentrate on how the tradition coalesced in his silent films.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 0596\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 0790 The Religion of Anime\n\nBe it shrine maidens, gods of death, and bodhisattvas fighting for justice; apocalypse, the afterlife, and apotheosis... the popular Japanese illustrated media of manga and anime are replete with religious characters and religious ideas. This course uses popular illustrated media as a tool for tracing the long history of how media and religion have been deeply intertwined in Japan.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 1550, RELS 0790\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1001 Introduction to Cinema Studies\n\nThis course equips students with a working toolbox for studying cinema. Over the semester, students will have continuous and creative opportunities to acquire and practice the vocabulary and media literacy skills needed for analyzing cinema in a variety of ways. We will pay close attention to films’ formal and stylistic techniques as well as to the narrative, non-narrative, and generic organizations of cinema. Using a variety of case studies, we will also examine the growth of cinema as industry, infrastructure, and entertainment; as a political and educational instrument; as a tool of personal and collective expression; and as a regime of sensory experience. Students will watch films from across the history of global cinema while reading and responding to historical, critical, and theoretical texts that investigate the development of cinema within a broader media landscape. There are no prerequisites. Students are required to watch films on their own.\n\nFall, Spring, and Summer Terms\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1002 Introduction to Media Studies\n\nThis course introduces students to the critical study of media – from social media and smart technologies of today to the audio transmissions and stone carvings of our predecessors. As we survey Instagram posts and tv shows, billboards and telegrams, we’ll consider what we can learn by examining each medium as a text, as an aesthetic form, as a technical object, as a platform, as an infrastructure, as an industry, and as a social and cultural force. We’ll study the creation, distribution, legislation, and consumption of media as both individual and social practices, focusing on how media define our social values and shape our collective behavior. Students will be invited to complete a series of reading responses, in the form of short texts and creative exercises that apply the course’s core critical concepts in analyzing various contemporary and historical media; as well as a midterm and final project.\n\nFall, Spring, and Summer Terms\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1003 Cinema and Revolution\n\nCan cinema be revolutionary? From Sergei Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin to Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You, filmmakers have long grappled with political revolution. In this course we'll study films that take moments of revolutionary upheaval as their subject, and cinema made during times of revolution. Can cinematic techniques challenge the status quo? How have filmmakers navigated the complex politics of cinematic production and distribution in moments of censorship and repression? Are art and propaganda always different? Students will give two oral presentations: one will be a detailed analysis of a single scene, and another will consider the politics of a film of their choosing. Open to all, including those with no prior background in cinema studies.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1003\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1004 World Film History\n\nFocusing on various cinematic movements, trends, and regional/national cinemas throughout film history, this course allows students to examine from various angles the connection between historical and cinematic developments. From early cinema, German Expressionism, the Soviet Montage, various new wave movements signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism, to contemporary movements such as Iranian New Wave, Taiwanese New Wave, and Korean New Wave, we will follow diverse cinematic trajectories from around the globe, as well as their interconnectedness. The goal is to cover a broad historical, cultural, thematic and stylistic range, but also to explore longer, pre-cinematic histories of regional and national traditions, and their connection to other artforms (opera, theater, painting) that had profound influence on the evolution of cinematic medium. The history of cinema will thus be approached as an intermedial history, which tends to blur the divides between old and new media, theatrical, painterly and photographic, foreign and national styles, conceiving of art in its hybrid and “impure” manifestation. We will also explore numerous ways the medium of film has played an active role in, narrated, and shaped history. Finally, we will examine how the concept of “world cinema history” gets shaped as a discursive construct, determining both major and minor cinematic flows. By tracing both dominant and peripheral trajectories and cinemas, we will see how “placing the film on the map” accounts for structural (in)equality and reveals gendered, racial, ethnic, economic and political nature of transnational processes in world cinema.\n\nFall\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1027 Sex and Representation\n\nThis course explores literature that resists normative categories of gender and sexuality. By focusing on figures writing from the margins, we will explore how radical approaches to narrative form and subject-matter invite us to think in new ways about desire and identity. We will read texts that blur the boundaries between fact and fiction, hybridizing the genres of poetry, drama, and autobiography to produce new forms of expression, such as the graphic novel, auto-fiction, and prose poetry. From Viriginia Woolf's gender-bending epic, Orlando, to Tony Kushner's Angels in America, this course traces how non-normative desire is produced and policed by social and literary contexts - and how those contexts can be re-imagined and transformed.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1027, GSWS 1027, REES 1481\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1050 Metropolis: Culture of the City\n\nAn exploration of modern discourses on and of the city. Topics include: the city as site of avant-garde experimentation; technology and culture; the city as embodiment of social order and disorder; traffic and speed; ways of seeing the city; the crowd; city figures such as the detective, the criminal, the flaneur, the dandy; film as the new medium of the city. Special emphasis on Berlin. Readings by, among others, Dickens, Poe, Baudelaire, Rilke, Doeblin, Marx, Engels, Benjamin, Kracauer. Films include Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Tom Tykwer's Run Lola Run.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: GRMN 1050, URBS 1050\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1051 The City in Literature and Film\n\nThis course focuses on the central place of the city through the history of cinema. The city in question may change depending on the term this course is being offered. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1951, URBS 1051\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1055 Books on Film: Adapting the Victorians\n\nThis course considers how stories are told differently through different media and to different audiences, and how such differences inform the many decisions involved in the translation of works across media and across time. To do so, we will consider key literary works (novels, stories, plays) from Victorian literature as well as their adaptations for film and television. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1055\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1056 Sherlock in the Multiverse\n\nThis course will consider the transmedia phenomenon of Sherlock Holmes. We will begin with his detective antecedents, we’ll then dive into Conan Doyle’s Victorian-era Sherlock, and finally explore Sherlock’s contemporary life in new novels, short stories, screenplays, tv series and computer games. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1056\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1070 Fascist Cinemas\n\nCinema played a crucial role in the cultural life of Nazi Germany and other fascist states. As cinema enthusiasts, Goebbels and Hitler were among the first to realize the important ideological potential of film as a mass medium and saw to it that Germany remained a cinema powerhouse producing more than 1000 films during the Nazi era. In Italy, Mussolini, too, declared cinema \"the strongest weapon.\" This course explores the world of \"fascist\" cinemas ranging from infamous propaganda pieces such as The Triumph of the Will to popular entertainments such as musicals and melodramas. It examines the strange and mutually defining kinship between fascism more broadly and film. We will consider what elements mobilize and connect the film industries of the Axis Powers: style, genre, the aestheticization of politics, the creation of racialized others. More than seventy years later, fascist cinemas challenge us to grapple with issues of more subtle ideological insinuation than we might think. Weekly screenings with subtitles.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1071, GRMN 1070, ITAL 1930\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1080 German Cinema\n\nAn introduction to the momentous history of German film, from its beginnings before World War One to developments following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and German reunification in 1990. With an eye to film's place in its historical and political context, the course will explore the \"Golden Age\" of German cinema in the Weimar Republic, when Berlin vied with Hollywood; the complex relationship between Nazi ideology and entertainment during the Third Reich; the fate of German film-makers in exile during the Hitler years; post-war film production in both West and East Germany; the call for an alternative to \"Papa's Kino\" and the rise of New German Cinema in the 1960s.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1080, GRMN 1080\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1092 Contemporary American Literature\n\nThe readings for this course expose students to a wide range of American fiction and poetry since World War II, giving considerable attention to recent work.

The aim of the seminar is to foreground discussions of performativity, visual culture, representation, and politics in the study of modern South Asian religions. Themes include mythological cinema, gender and sexuality, censorship and the state, and communalism and secularism. The films we will be deploying as case studies will be limited to those produced in Hindi, Telugu and Tamil (the three largest cinema cultures of India). No knowledge of any South Asian language is needed for this course however.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: RELS 1112, SAST 1112\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1130 Water Worlds: Cultural Responses to Sea Level Rise & Catastrophic Flooding\n\nAs a result of climate change, the world that will take shape in the course of this century will be decidedly more inundated with water than we're accustomed to. The polar ice caps are melting, glaciers are retreating, ocean levels are rising, polar bear habitat is disappearing, countries are jockeying for control over a new Arctic passage, while low-lying cities and small island nations are confronting the possibility of their own demise. Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans. Objects of analysis will include mythology, ancient and early modern diluvialism, literature, art, film, and commemorative practice. The basic question we'll be asking is: What can we learn from the humanities that will be helpful for confronting the problems and challenges caused by climate change and sea level rise?\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1130, ENVS 1040, GRMN 1130\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1146 Queer German Cinema\n\nTaught in English.

Second, students will develop their own idea for a television series which will culminate in the writing of the first 30 pages of an original television pilot.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 3603\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1180 The Short Film: Writing, Producing, Directing\n\nIn this class students will write and prepare a short film for production with the INTENT to direct it. The first half of class is devoted to coming up with an idea and writing a short film with a total run time of around 8-12 minutes. This is the ideal length for a short. The second half of the class is devoted to preparing to shoot the film which will include scheduling, budgeting, casting, crewing up, location scouting and creating a directorial look book for the film. At the end of class each student will have a short film script and all the necessary materials to start production of that film. The below documents are required to pass the class and presented as one all inclusive PDF document at the end of the semester.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 3609\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1190 Introduction to Postcolonial Literature\n\nEnglish is a global language with a distinctly imperial history, and this course serves as an essential introduction to literary works produced in or about the former European colonies. The focus will be poetry, film, fiction and non fiction and at least two geographic areas spanning the Americas, South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa as they reflect the impact of colonial rule on the cultural representations of identity, nationalism, race, class and gender. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1190, ENGL 1190\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1230 Masterpieces of French Cinema\n\nThis course will introduce students to key films of the French film canon, selected over a period ranging from the origins of French cinema to the present. Students will also be introduced to the key critical concepts (such as the notion of the \"auteur\" film genre) informing the discussion of films in France. The films will be studied in both a historical and theoretical context, related to their period styles (e.g. \"le realisme poetique,\" \"la Nouvelle Vague,\" etc.), their \"auteurs,\" the nature of the French star system, the role of the other arts, as well to the critical debates they have sparked among critics and historians. Students will acquire the analytical tools in French to discuss films as artistic and as cultural texts. Please note: This course follows a Lecture/Recitation format. The Lecture (FREN 1230-401/CIMS 1230-401) is taught in English. For French credit: please register for both FREN 1230-401 (lecture) and FREN 1230-402 (recitation); the FREN 1230-402 recitation is conducted in French.

Prerequisite: Two 200-level courses taken at Penn or equivalent.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: FREN 1230\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1271 American Musical Theatre\n\nThe American musical is an unapologetically popular art form, but many of the works that come from this tradition have advanced and contributed to the canon of theatre as a whole. In this course we will focus on both music and texts to explore ways in which the musical builds on existing theatrical traditions, as well as alters and reshapes them. Finally, it is precisely because the musical is a popular theatrical form that we can discuss changing public tastes, and the financial pressures inherent in mounting a production. Beginning with early roots in operetta, we will survey the works of prominent writers in the American musical theatre, including Kern, Berlin, Gershwin, Porter, Rodgers, Hart, Hammerstein, Bernstein, Sondheim and others. Class lecture/discussions will be illustrated with recorded examples.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1271, THAR 1271\n\nMutually Exclusive: THAR 0271\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1272 Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict in Film\n\nThis course studies the cinematic representation of civil wars, ethnic conflicts, nationalistic doctrines, and genocidal policies. The focus is on the violent developments that took place in Russia and on the Balkans after the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and were conditioned by the new geopolitical dynamics that the fall of communism had already created. We study media broadcasts, documentaries, feature films representing the Eastern, as well as the Western perspective. The films include masterpieces such as \"Time of the Gypsies\", \"Underground\", \"Prisoner of the Mountains\", \"Before the Rain\", \"Behind Enemy Lines\", and others.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 1272\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1273 Dark Comedy in Theatre and Film\n\nThis course will examine the \"troublesome genre\" of dark comedy by looking at the ways in which theatre and film use comic and tragic structures and traditions to explore concepts and stories seemingly at odds with those traditions. Although not always organized chronologically in time, we will examine the formal and structural characteristics of tragicomedy by tracing its development, from some of its earliest roots in Roman comedy, to its manifestation in contemporary films and plays. Aside from close readings of plays and analysis of films, we will read selected critical essays and theory to enhance our understanding of how dark comedies subvert categories and expectations. We will look at how dark comedies affect audiences and read sections of plays aloud in class. Issues to be considered include comparing the way the genre translates across theatre and film (adaptation) and examining the unique placement of the genre at the heart of contemporary American culture. Students will have the opportunity to experiment with creating tragicomic effect through performance in their presentations. The class is a seminar, with required participation in discussions. Other assignments include an 8-10 page paper and a presentation. We will read plays by authors as diverse as Plautus, Anton Chekhov, and Lynn Nottage, and filmmakers including Charlie Chaplin, Sofia Coppola, and Bong Joon-ho.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1273, THAR 1273\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1274 The Musical Theatre of Stephen Sondheim\n\nJust days before Stephen Sondheim died in November 2021, he attended a revival of Assassins at Classic Stage Company, as well as a radical rethinking of Company that had transferred from London to New York. A few days later, a public performance of the song “Sunday” was organized in Duffy Square by Lin-Manuel Miranda. A new production of Into the Woods is currently on Broadway, and another of Sweeney Todd is planned for February 2023. Though it’s been nearly 15 years since Sondheim’s final new musical, he is very much part of our theatrical present—through his own works, which continue to be produced internationally, and through his influence on several generations of composers, lyricists, and more. Still today, among theatre critics and a large sector of the public, Sondheim is generally considered the most significant composer and lyricist in the contemporary theatre; he is, in fact, accorded the kind of serious consideration generally reserved for “legitimate” playwrights. In this seminar, we will examine in detail Stephen Sondheim’s writing over six decades. We’ll begin with Sondheim’s earliest work as a lyricist, collaborating with composers Jule Styne (Gypsy), Leonard Bernstein (West Side Story), and later, Richard Rodgers (Do I Hear a Waltz?). Beginning in 1970, Sondheim – now both composer and lyricist – in partnership with director Harold Prince produced a series of musicals (including Company, Follies and Sweeney Todd,) still thought to be among the most innovative and substantial in the history of the genre. We will also focus on Sondheim's musicals after his 1981 break with Prince. These later works, created with writers and directors including James Lapine (Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, Passion), Jerry Zaks (Assassins), and John Doyle (Road Show) are often smaller in scale, intensely personal, and incorporate elements of performance art and popular culture. Finally, we will consider revival productions of Sondheim’s work, which often are reconceived from their original form, often with Sondheim’s involvement and occasional rewriting. This course is open to all students interested in theatre and musical theatre. The ability to read music is not required.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2874, THAR 1274\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1275 Broadway Musicals in the 21st Century\n\nWicked, Spring Awakening, Dear Evan Hansen, Hadestown. And of course, Hamilton. The innovations we see in Broadway musicals since 2000 are particularly fascinating in that they, so to speak, boldly go where no musicals have gone before—while at the same time honoring and building on the long-standing traditions of this beloved form. From the powerfully romantic Light in the Piazza, which nods to roots in European operetta, to the boundary-defying Black queerness of A Strange Loop... and everything in between. In this course, we will go year by through musical theater from the quarter-century, to see where the form has gone recently… and where it’s headed. In addition to the works already mentioned, we’ll look at Caroline or Change, The Color Purple, In the Heights, Fun Home, and more. This course will also consider some recent “revisals,” like director Daniel Fish’s Oklahoma!, and Marianne Elliott’s gender-reassigned Company: reinterpretations of classic American musicals that imagine them in more contemporary light.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1891, THAR 1272\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1276 Movie Musicals: From Oz to La La Land\n\nThe very first major sound film—The Jazz Singer, in 1927—featured not only speaking, but also singing. Audiences around the country hungrily consumed this new cinematic genre—one that was also strongly influenced by the stage musicals that were taking New York by storm. The synergy between Hollywood and Broadway was electric. Virtually every major composer and lyricist, including Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Rodgers and Hammerstein, worked both coasts. At the same time, the movies created new film celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, The Nicholas Brothers, and more. In the Depression 42nd Street, The Wizard of Oz, and Stormy Weather provided entertaining escapism—and sometimes a critical lens into reality. As time moved on movie musicals moved with them… and continue to do so. Jailhouse Rock, A Hard Day’s Night, Sparkle, The Who’s Tommy, Robert Altman’s Nashville, and Damien Chazelle’s La La Land are just a few of the films that reinvent and even subvert the genres, while showcasing stars from Elvis Presley to Tina Turner to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Movie Musicals will explore the development of this form and the artists who made it, including Busby Berkeley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bob Fosse, Baz Luhrmann… and of course, Walt Disney. The class will also present an international perspective: Bollywood, Nollywood, and the Scandinavian sensibility of Bjork and Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1892, THAR 1276\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1280 The Art of Revolution\n\nThis course offers an international and multidisciplinary tour of revolutionary art from the 20th and 21st centuries, including cinema, literature, visual art, theater, and performance art.

Equal parts socio-political history and media studies, this course will comprehensively assess factors contributing to the historical under representation of AAPIs in mainstream American media. By contrast, the media texts that we study will reveal a cinematic history that runs parallel to the mainstream, consisting of independently produced films created by and/or starring AAPIs that feature authentic portrayals of the community they represent. Topics will include economics of film production, broadcast television ratings, film festivals as a mechanism of distribution, negative stereotyping, Hollywood whitewashing, cultural appropriation, and media activism. The course will take place once a week and will consist of a brief discussion of the previous week's readings, followed by a lecture, and ending with a full or partial film screening relating to the current week's topic. Additional out of class assignments will be given that involve attending the Philadelphia Asian American Film Festival, tentatively scheduled November 8-18, 2018. Students will have the opportunity to engage with and learn from AAPI filmmakers in attendance at the festival, with additional volunteer opportunities available for extra credit.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: ASAM 1300\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1351 Contemporary Fiction & Film in Japan\n\nThis course will explore fiction and film in contemporary Japan, from 1945 to the present. Topics will include literary and cinematic representation of Japan s war experience and post-war reconstruction, negotiation with Japanese classics, confrontation with the state, and changing ideas of gender and sexuality. We will explore these and other questions by analyzing texts of various genres, including film and film scripts, novels, short stories, manga, and academic essays. Class sessions will combine lectures, discussion, audio-visual materials, and creative as well as analytical writing exercises. The course is taught in English, although Japanese materials will be made available upon request. No prior coursework in Japanese literature, culture, or film is required or expected; additional secondary materials will be available for students taking the course at the 600 level. Writers and film directors examined may include: Kawabata Yasunari, Hayashi Fumiko, Abe Kobo, Mishima Yukio, Oe Kenzaburo, Yoshimoto Banana, Ozu Yasujiro, Naruse Mikio, Kurosawa Akira, Imamura Shohei, Koreeda Hirokazu, and Beat Takeshi.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1351, EALC 1351, GSWS 1351\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1358 Histories of Egypt\n\nThis course will explore Egypt’s impact on the world in several historical eras – the ancient past and its unparalleled legacy; the nineteenth century and nationalism; the twentieth century’s wars, peace and music and the twenty-first centuries lessons in revolution. We will examine European Egyptomania and Orientalism in the 19th century, Afrocentrism’s ambitions for Egypt, and Egypt’s centrality to pan-Arabism and pan-Africanism. And we will explore the history as Egypt’s writers, filmmakers, musicians and poets have imagined it from the nineteenth century to the present.\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 1358, HIST 1358\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1359 Filming the Middle East\n\nThis course will take us through the history of the modern Middle East as told by the region's many film-makers. We will explore how cinema developed and grew throughout countries like Egypt, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine. Unusually for a typical course on the Middle East, we will also pay close attention to North Africa's film industry, with a deep exploration of the cinema of Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Sudanese films will be an important part of our study as well. What does it mean to have a national cinema? Many of these countries' film industries grew under European occupation and colonialism. With independence, were more markets available to Middle Eastern films? Where did directors and screenwriters train? Who were the intended audiences for these films? We will watch canonical films from the region, many of which focus on or reflect the political turmoil and aftermath of wars. But we will also examine the lightness of comedies, which were usually much more popular with Middle Eastern audiences, and which reveal every bit as much about the region's histories. And we will watch and discuss a phenomenon not found in Western cinema - the Ramadan soap operas and historical reenactments that are unique to the Middle East.\n\nAlso Offered As: HIST 1359, MELC 1970, NELC 1970\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1360 Arab/Israeli Conflict in Literature and Film\n\nThis course will explore the origins, the history and, most importantly, the literary and cinematic art of the struggle that has endured for a century over the region that some call the Holy Land, some call Eretz Israel and others call Palestine. We will also consider religious motivations and interpretations that have inspired many involved in this conflict as well as the political consequences of world wars that contributed so greatly to the reconfiguration of the Middle East after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and after the revelations of the Holocaust in Western Europe. While we will rely on a textbook for historical grounding. the most significant material we will use to learn this history will be films, novels, and short stories. Can the arts lead us to a different understanding of the lives lived through what seems like unending crisis?\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: HIST 1360, MELC 0675, NELC 0675\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1371 New Korean Cinema\n\nIn 2019, Bong Joon-ho's Parasite won the Palme d'Or at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival. This event marked the apex of South Korean cinematic renaissance, having steadily become a tour de force in the international film festival scene since 1997 onwards. This course explores the major auteurs, styles, themes, and currents of the so-called \"New Korean Cinema\" that emerged in the mid-to-late 1990s to continue to this day. Drawing from texts on critical film and Korean studies, we will pay particular attention to how the selected works re-present, resist, and interweave the sociopolitical climate they concern and are born out of. Using cinema as a lens with which to see the society, we will touch upon major events of the twentieth century including national division, military dictatorship and democratization movements, IMF economic crisis, youth culture, hallyu (the Korean wave), and more. In so doing, we will closely examine how each cinematic medium addresses the societal power structure and the role of the \"Other\" it represents in terms of class, race, gender, and sexuality in the construction of contemporary Korean society. No prior experience of Korean studies courses necessary; all films will be screened with English subtitles.\n\nAlso Offered As: EALC 1371\n\nMutually Exclusive: EALC 6371\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1430 From the Uncanny to Horror: Film and Psychoanalysis\n\nThis course introduces students to the links between psychoanalysis and film by focusing on two themes, the Uncanny and Horror. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1430\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1440 Film Music in Post 1950 Italy\n\nAn exploration of cinematic sound through the lens of specific composer/director collaborations in post-1950 Italy, examining scores, soundtracks, and the interaction of diegetic and non-diegetic music with larger soundscapes. Composers Nino Rota and Ennio Morricone serve as case studies, in partnership with directors Fellini, Visconti, Leone, Pontecorve, Pasolini, and Coppola. Highlights include several excerpts form the Fellini/Rota collaboration, including The White Sheik, I vitelloni, The Road, Nights of Cabiria, La dolce vita, 8 1/2, Juliet of the Spirits, Satyricon, The Clowns, Roma, Amarcord, Casanova, and Orchestra Rehearsal. Rota's music for Visconti will be examined in Senso, the Leopard, and Rocco and his Brothers, along with his Transatlantic collaboration for The Godfather. Morricone's work with various directors will be discussed in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, The Battle of Algiers, and Teorema, as well as for American films such as Malick's Days of Heaven and Tarantino's The Hateful Eight. Weekly screenings required. Open to all: music majors, minors, and non-majors; will count toward requirements for music minor. Knowledge of music and Italian helpful but not required. All readings and lectures in English.\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 1440, MUSC 1440\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1470 Chekhov: Stage & Screen\n\nWhat's so funny, Mr. Chekhov? This question is often asked by critics and directors who still are puzzled with Chekhovs definition of his four major plays as comedies. Traditionally, all of them are staged and directed as dramas, melodramas, or tragedies. Should we cry or should we laugh at Chekhovian characters who commit suicide, or are killed, or simply cannot move to a better place of living? Is the laughable synonymous to comedy and the comic? Should any fatal outcome be considered tragic? All these and other questions will be discussed during the course. The course is intended to provide the participants with a concept of dramatic genre that will assist them in approaching Chekhovs plays as comedies. In addition to reading Chekhovs works, Russian and western productions and film adaptations of Chekhovs works will be screened. Among them are, Vanya on 42nd Street with Andre Gregory, and Four Funny Families. Those who are interested will be welcome to perform and/or direct excerpts from Chekhovs works.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 1470\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1520 Forest Worlds: Mapping the Arboreal Imaginary in Literature and Film\n\nThe destruction of the world's forests through wild fires, deforestation, and global heating threatens planetary bio-diversity and may even, as a 2020 shows, trigger civilizational collapse. Can the humanities help us think differently about the forest? At the same time that forests of the world are in crisis, the \"rights of nature\" movement is making progress in forcing courts to acknowledge the legal \"personhood\" of forests and other ecosystems. The stories that humans have told and continue to tell about forests are a source for the imaginative and cultural content of that claim. At a time when humans seem unable to curb the destructive practices that place themselves, biodiversity, and forests at risk, the humanities give us access to a record of the complex inter-relationship between forests and humanity. Forest Worlds serves as an introduction to the environmental humanities. The environmental humanities offer a perspective on the climate emergency and the human dimension of climate change that are typically not part of the study of climate science or climate policy. Students receive instruction in the methods of the humanities - cultural analysis and interpretation of literature and film - in relation to texts that illuminate patterns of human behavior, thought, and affect with regard to living in and with nature.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: COML 1054, ENVS 1550, GRMN 1132\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1640 Russian and East European Film from the October Revolution to World War II\n\nThe purpose of this course is to present the Russian and East European contribution to world cinema in terms of film theory, experimentation with the cinematic language, and social and political reflex. We discuss major themes and issues such as the invention of montage, the means of revolutionary visual propaganda and the cinematic component to the communist cultural revolutions, party ideology, and practices of social-engineering, cinematic response to the emergence of the totalitarian state in Soviet Russia before World War II.\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 1230\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1650 Russian and East European Film after World War II\n\nThe purpose of this course is to present the Russian and East European contribution to world cinema in terms of film theory, experimentation with the cinematic language, and social and political reflex. We discuss major themes and issues such as means of visual propaganda and the cinematic component to the communist cultural revolutions, party ideology and practices of social-engineering, cinematic response to the emergence of the totalitarian state in Russia and its subsequent installation in Eastern Europe after World War II.\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 1231\n\nMutually Exclusive: REES 6231\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1800 Film Culture in Residence\n\nThis flexible and immersive cinema experience introduces students to a wide range of films to learn about the art form. The list of movies will engage our viewers in such fundamental issues through many different film genres, narratives and cinematic experiences.\n\nTwo Term Class, Student must enter first term; credit given after both terms are complete\n\n0.5 Course Units\n\nCIMS 1900 Italian History on Screen: How Movies Tell the Story of Italy\n\nHow has our image of Italy arrived to us? Where does the story begin and who has recounted, rewritten, and rearranged it over the centuries? In this course, we will study Italy's rich and complex past and present. We will carefully read literary and historical texts and thoughtfully watch films in order to attain an understanding of Italy that is as varied and multifacted as the country itself. Group work, discussions and readings will allow us to examine the problems and trends in the political, cultural and social history from ancient Rome to today. We will focus on: the Roman Empire, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Unification, Turn of the Century, Fascist era, World War II, post-war and contemporary Italy. Lectures and readings are in English.\n\nFall or Spring\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 1900\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 1901 Topics in Portuguese, African and Brazilian Cultures\n\nThis course explores aspects of Luso-Brazilian culture and film in light of its social context and reception.

Often our thoughts range from scenic vacation spots, delicious seafood and cannoli, and sweet grandmothers dressed in black, to mafia violence, vendettas, and the deep-rooted code of silence, omerta. But, how did these ideas get to us? Is there truth in them? Is there more to this island and its people? Through careful analysis of literary and cinematic representations of this Italian region, and those that do and have inhabited it, we will trace and analyze how Sicilians have represented themselves, how mainland Italians have interpreted Sicilian culture, how outsiders have understood these symbols, how our own perceptions shaped what we thought we knew about this place and, finally, how our own observations will have evolved throughout our studies. We will watch films such as Tornatore's Cinema paradiso and Coppola's The Godfather II, and read texts such as Lampedusa's The Leopard and Maraini's Bagheria. This course aims to increase students' understanding and knowledge of the Sicilian socio-cultural system. It will help students develop their ability to understand and interpret Sicilian culture through close analysis of its history, values, attitudes, and experiences, thereby allowing them to better recognize and examine the values and practices that define their own, as well as others', cultural frameworks.\n\nSummer Term\n\nAlso Offered As: ITAL 1910\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2000 Virtual Reality Lab\n\nIn this collaboration between Penn and the Philadelphia Museum of Art (PMA), students will work with with curators to create virtual reality projects connected to the museum's collections. This course mixes virtual reality theory, history, and practice. We will read a wide range of scholarship, manifestoes, and memoirs that examine virtual reality and other immersive technologies, stretching from the 18th century to today. We will explore virtual reality projects, including narrative and documentary films, commercial applications, and games. We will work with many different virtual reality systems. And we will learn the basics of creating virtual reality, making fully immersive 3-D, 360-degree films with geospatial soundscapes. Finally, we will take what we have learned out of the classroom, working with the Philadelphia Museum of Art curators to create virtual realty experiences based around the museum's objects and exhibits. Students will gain an understanding of the unique approaches needed to appeal to museum visitors in a public setting, so we can make viable experiences for them. No previous knowledge of VR or experience is necessary.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2951\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2001 Modern Science Fiction Cinema\n\nScience Fiction has been a cinematic genre for as long as there has been cinema—at least since Georges Melies’s visionary Trip to the Moon in 1902. However, though science fiction films have long been reliable box office earners and cult phenomena, critical acknowledgement and analysis was slow to develop. Still, few genres reflect the sensibility of their age so transparently—if often unconsciously—or provide so many opportunities for filmmakers to simultaneously address social issues and expand the lexicon with new technologies. Given budgetary considerations and the appetite for franchises, science fiction auteurs face a difficult negotiation between artistic expression and lowest common denominator imperatives, the controversy over Terry Gilliam’s Brazil (1985) being perhaps the most infamous example. Nevertheless, many notable filmmakers have done their most perceptive and influential work in the scifi realm, including Gilliam, Ridley Scott, David Cronenberg, Paul Verhoeven, James Cameron and Alfonso Cuaron. This course will survey the scope of contemporary science fiction cinema, after looking first at seminal works like Metropolis (1927) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) that continue to cast their shadow over the genre. We will then devote considerable time to a pair of more modern films, Scott’s Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), which drew from earlier movements (German expressionism, noir), influenced new ones (cyberpunk) and inspired a rare wave of academic discourse. Over the course of the term we will sample smaller, more independent-minded projects, such as Michel Gondry’s Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004) and Spike Jonze’s Her (2013) as well as higher profile but much more risky epics from filmmakers such as Steven Spielberg and Christopher Nolan.\n\nSpring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2002 Global Jewish Communities (Penn Global Seminar - PGS)\n\nThis course will introduce students to emergent Jewish communities across the globe through a case study of the Abayudaya in Uganda. Students will learn about the origins of this more than one-hundred year old community and its recent rebirth within the context of modern Ugandan history. This course will entail a strong emphasis on writing as part of a larger effort to amplify stories from the Abayudaya community. At the same time, the course will introduce students to fieldwork and filmmaking theories and practice in preparation for a site visit to the Abayudaya in January (over winter break). During this trip, students will work in teams to create short profile films of community members. These may include religious and community leaders, physicians and nurses from the Abayudaya medical and dental clinics, Abayudaya business people, and more. Strong emphasis will be placed on understanding the ethics and rigors of written and visual fieldwork, as well as the intricacies of writing and creating short films. The course output will be housed on a Penn website and YouTube channel, and the films will be shared with community members as part of the faculty’s ongoing collaboration with this community.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2010 Film Festivals\n\nThis course is an exploration of multiple forces that explain the growth, global spread and institutionalization of international film festivals. The global boom in film industry has resulted in an incredible proliferation of film festivals taking place all around the world, and festivals have become one of the biggest growth industries. A dizzying convergence site of cinephilia, media spectacle, business agendas and geopolitical purposes, film festivals offer a fruitful ground on which to investigate the contemporary global cinema network. Film festivals will be approached as a site where numerous lines of the world cinema map come together, from culture and commerce, experimentation and entertainment, political interests and global business patterns. To analyze the network of film festivals, we will address a wide range of issues, including historical and geopolitical forces that shape the development of festivals, festivals as an alternative marketplace, festivals as a media event, programming and agenda setting, prizes, cinephilia, and city marketing. Individual case studies of international film festivals—Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Rotterdam, Karlovy Vary, Toronto, Sundance among others—will enable us to address all these diverse issues but also to establish a theoretical framework with which to approach the study of film festival. For students planning to attend the Penn-in-Cannes program, this course provides an excellent foundation that will prepare you for the on-site experience of the King of all festivals.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3910, ENGL 2901\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2011 American Independents\n\nThis topic course explores aspects of Film History intensively.

The course will examine the idea of world cinema and set up a model of how it can be explored by studying contemporary film in various countries. We will explore ways in which cinemas from around the globe have attempted to come to terms with Hollywood, and look at forces that lead many filmmakers to define themselves in opposition to Hollywood norms. But we will also look at the phenomenon of world cinema in independent terms, as “waves” that peak in different places and times, and coordinate various forces. Finally, through the close case study of significant films and cinemas that have dominated the international festival circuit (Chinese, Korean, Iranian, Indian, etc.) we will engage with the questions of which films/cinemas get labeled as “world cinema,” what determines entry into the sphere of world cinema, and examine the importance of film festivals in creating world cinema.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3912, COML 2012, ENGL 2930\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2013 Documentary Cinema\n\nThis topic course explores aspects of Film History intensively.

It explores a diverse range of films which claim to show that film can narrate and also shape history, and pays special attention to the manner in which films write and rewrite history by articulating and shaping popular memory. The course will be based on a premise that cinema, as a truly popular and global phenomenon, produces both the normative or institutional versions of history, as well as popular resistances to such official history. Because these issues are most prevalent in a genre called “historical films,” we will view and analyze several examples of this genre to try to answer the following questions: What is a historical film? What is its relationship to history and historical narratives? What is its role in producing or reshaping our memory of historical events? By extensive analysis of diverse films, both fiction and documentaries, we will thus raise significant questions about the construction of memory, history, and identity.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3900, ENGL 2941\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2021 Romantic Comedy\n\nWe may know what it is like to fall in love, but how do movies tell us what it is like? Through an exciting tour of American and World cinema, we will analyze the moods and swings, successes and failures of love in romantic comedy, one of the most popular but generally overlooked and taken for granted genres. We will turn a spotlight on it by examining what elements and iconography constitute the “romcom” genre, what specific qualities inform its sub-groupings such as screwball, sex comedy or radical romantic comedy, how they are related to their historical, cultural and ideological contexts, and what we can learn about their audiences. Watching classic as well contemporary examples of the genre, from City Lights (1931), It Happened One Night (1934) and Roman Holiday (1953), to Harold and Maude (1971), Annie Hall (1977), How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days (2003) and Her (2013), we will problematize this overly-familiar cinema to make it new and strange again, and open it up to creative analysis.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 3901, ENGL 2942\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2022 World Cinema\n\nThis topic course explores aspects of Film Practice intensively.

For a genre literally synonymous with falsehood, fiction has always been touchy about its relationship to truth: Does the novel neutrally represent reality or does it recreate it? Are characters like living, breathing real people, or are they mere simulations? And if they’re just words on a page (or images on a screen), why are we so moved by their adventures, loves and misfortunes? In this class, we will explore and expand on these questions by focusing on novels and films that deal explicitly and exclusively with fakers, shapeshifters and doppelgangers, lies of necessity and of opportunity, as well as with works that revel in exposing their own manipulative artificiality. We will read psychoanalysts, sociologists, philosophers, and postcolonial thinkers and ask, What does it mean to be authentic? How malleable are our individual identity, race, gender and sexuality? What forces shape it, and how constant is this shape? Are we the same selves when we have a conversation as when we give a presentation? Do we remain ourselves when we talk to customers at our service jobs, to teachers, to students? When we “pass” as a different race? When we speak in a different accent? How do we reconcile the conflicting demands of “be yourself” and “fake it till you make it”? What is the relation between our presentation of ourselves and our selves? Novels and shorts stories for discussion might include classics like Nella Larsen’s Passing, Vladimir Nabokov’s Despair and Patricia Highsmith’s The Talented Mr. Ripley, as well as movies like Gaslight, The Battle of Algiers, The Yes Men, and American Psycho. While much of the weekly work in this class will be reading-and-discussion based, oral presentations – keenly aware of their own artifice – will count toward half of the final grade. A final oral presentation will be based on a creative project in conversation with class materials. The course would satisfy those interested in fulfilling the Advanced Film and Literature and Global Literature and Film requirements.

This course will grapple with issues of ethnicity, political conflict, and identity in the Middle East by analyzing the culture produced for and consumed by a wide spectrum of the general public in different countries. Political cartoons, photography, novels, film, music, dance, and other modes of cultural expression will be used to explore the historical roots of the political anxieties and social conventions common to many modern Middle Eastern communities. In this way, we will recast studies of politics through an understanding of identity and culture.\n\nAlso Offered As: HIST 2355\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2420 Cultural Studies Seminar\n\nThis course explores an aspect of cultural studies intensively.

Kurosawa claimed that Tarkovsky had \"no equal among film directors alive now.\" Bergman called his work \"a miracle.\" His films are beautiful, intellectually challenging, and spiritually profound. They also represent a prolonged exploration of the potential of the long take - unusually extended, continuous shots. Tarkovsky's works range from \"Ivan's Childhood\", a study of wartime experience through the eyes of a child; to \"Solaris\", a philosophical essay in the form of a science-fiction thriller; to \"Andrei Rublev,\" an investigation of the power of art and spirituality. In this course, we will study Tarkovsky's films and life, with attention to his formal and artistic accomplishments, his thought and writings, and the cultural and political contexts of his work. Each student will learn to analyze film form and content and write two short and one longer paper on some longstanding aspect of Tarkovsky's work of the student's choice.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 0280\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2506 Ecocritical Seminar: Remediating the Environment\n\nIn this course, we will interrogate the term “remediation” as meaning both environmental restoration and media representation. Students will be introduced to the fields of ecocriticism and ecomedia by examining how a variety of materials—from bestselling books to billboards, documentaries, and websites—have informed the cultural imagination of the environment. Students will also discover how media communications and publications can help to remediate the environment in the face of climate catastrophe. This course can be counted as an elective toward the Environmental Humanities minor and as fulfilling the minor's public engagement component.

This course will analyze the history of fakes and forgeries and consider whether they devalue the original or not, or even have value in themselves. Along the way, students will learn how fakes and forgeries have been created, what tools can be used to counter the onslaught of illicit creations, and the arts and humanities debates that have arisen surrounding them. After evaluating the ways various media have been modified over time, this course will show students how to use photo manipulation tools to modify digital media. It will also show students how to perform various detailed analyses of digital media to determine their legitimacy. A final project will bring these tools together, as groups of students create a fake or forgery, consider its implications and evaluate a tool’s ability to detect it.\n\nFall\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2665\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2666 Algorithmic Ethics\n\nAlgorithms and Artificial Intelligence have become ubiquitous in the 21st century. From the movies recommended by Netflix to the advertisements presented on social media and the routes suggested by Google Maps, AI and algorithms can make our lives more convenient. But what about AI that that can earn a B+ on an MBA exam without studying, phones that unlock with facial recognition that doesn’t work smoothly on all skin colors, or autonomous weaponized drones that mistake civilians for targets? As algorithms play an increasing role in various aspects of modern society, addressing their ethical considerations becomes increasingly crucial to ensure their responsible and beneficial use. This course explores the ethical dimensions and implications inherent in algorithms and their associated technologies in a wide variety of contexts. Topics will range from the intricacies of privacy invasion and the mitigation of bias to the establishment of accountability in the use of algorithms in fields such as education, healthcare, finance, criminal justice, employment, environmental issues, urban planning, and weapons of war. We will critically analyze academic research, policy debates, and case studies to develop a nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding algorithms. Students will engage with cutting-edge scholarship and contribute to ongoing discussions on algorithmic ethics. As part of the course, students will interact with AI and report on their findings.\n\nSpring\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2666\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2705 Media and Culture in Contemporary Iran\n\nThis course offers a comprehensive introduction to the culture and media of modern Iran, with a critical perspective on issues such as identity formation, ethnicity, race, and nation-building. It focuses on how these issues relate to various aspects of modern Iranian culture -- such as religion, gender, sexuality, war, and migration -- through the lens of media, cinema, and literature.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: GSWS 2705, MELC 2705, RELS 2180\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2740 Facing America\n\nThis course explores the visual history of race in the United States as both self-fashioning and cultural mythology by examining the ways that conceptions of Native American, Latino, and Asian identity, alongside ideas of Blackness and Whiteness, have combined to create the various cultural ideologies of class, gender, and sexuality that remain evident in historical visual and material culture. We also investigate the ways that these creations have subsequently helped to launch new visual entertainments, including museum spectacles, blackface minstrelsy, and early film, from the colonial period through the 1940s.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: AFRC 2740, ARTH 2740, LALS 2740\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6740\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2750 Russian History in Film\n\nThis course draws on fictional, dramatic and cinematic representations of Russian history based on Russian as well as non-Russian sources and interpretations. The analysis targets major modes of imagining, such as narrating, showing and reenacting historical events, personae and epochs justified by different, historically mutating ideological postulates and forms of national self-consciousness. Common stereotypes of picturing Russia from \"foreign\" perspectives draw special attention. The discussion involves the following themes and outstanding figures: the mighty autocrats Ivan the Terrible, Peter the Great, and Catherine the Great; the tragic ruler Boris Godunov; the brazen rebel and royal impostor Pugachev; the notorious Rasputin, his uncanny powers, sex-appeal, and court machinations; Lenin and the October Revolution; images of war; times of construction and times of collapse of the Soviet Colossus.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: REES 0270\n\nMutually Exclusive: REES 5270\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2810 Method Acting: From Self to Stage and Screen\n\nWhat, exactly, is “method acting”? Jeremy Strong became notorious on television’s Succession for “staying in character” while filming, to the great irritation of his castmates. Jared Leto “transformed” himself by gaining sixty pounds for a role in Chapter 27, then losing another thirty for a role in Dallas Buyer’s Club. Are such approaches really “method” acting? Are they healthy and sustainable? And do they produce truly compelling performances? This course aims to demystify “the method” through a combination of historical inquiry and hands-on acting work. We will explore the cultural phenomenon of “the method” by tracing its historical, theatrical roots, from the core theories and practices of Russian actor-director Konstantin Stanislavsky through the American Group Theatre experiments of the 1930s, the heyday of New York’s Actors Studio in the 1950s, and its culmination in iconic stage and film performances. (One prime example is Marlon Brando’s famed portrayal of Stanley in Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar Named Desire, as directed by Elia Kazan). Our studies will involve reading historical, theoretical, and dramatic texts, viewing selected films, and practicing acting exercises. Course assessment will comprise participation, facilitation, short responses, and a final project that can take the form of a research paper, presentation, or performance.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2882, THAR 2810\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2830 Backstage Drama in Theatre and Film\n\nInviting audiences into a special relationship with illusion, backstage dramas (whether on film or on stage) and plays-within-plays reach beyond and alongside traditional plot-driven narratives, to reflect on the process of representation itself. Drawing from classical debates about the relationships between reality, illusion, representation, and imitation (mimesis), we will examine a variety of plays and films as we articulate the complex network of responses and underlying assumptions (whether cultural, political, or social), about art and life, that these works engage.\n\nFall, odd numbered years only\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 1896, THAR 2830\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2840 Icons in Performance: Actors and Others Who Have Shaped the Arts\n\nMany talented performers bring works to life on a stage or in film. But a select few artists are so distinctive they become icons, defining for audiences-often for many years beyond their careers-the art they serve. Marlon Brando defined a new kind of American acting. Sidney Poitier broke the color barrier for leading man movie stars. Maria Callas showed that opera was equal parts theatre and music. Greta Garbo helped us understand the visual power of a film image. This seminar course will focus on iconic performers, directors and others, and the roles they play in defining their art forms. It is part analysis (interpreting in detail what it is these artists do) and part cultural study (why it matters, and also seeking to understand the larger circumstances at play in forging an icon). In addition to the performers mentioned above, we'll also study Mae West, Fred Astaire, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra, and more. We will also look at a handful of iconic directors-including Alfred Hitchcock, Douglas Sirk, and others-whose style makes a definitive mark on American film and theater. And we will also look at how critics (in addition to popular audiences) assess performers through comparisons, and by understanding the evolution and tradition of the art. To support our work, we will use film, audio recordings, scripts, criticism and analytical essays, biography, and more.\n\nAlso Offered As: ENGL 2890, THAR 2840\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2850 Art and Business of Film\n\nThe course will explore how a screenplay is conceptualized and developed, the role of agency relationships in the film business, and - casting as wide a net as possible - the financing, production, direction, distribution, exhibition and marketing of both independent and studio films. A combination of lectures by instructors and practitioners, case studies, film screenings, and consulting projects with independent and Hollywood creators, packagers, financiers, exhibitors, distributors and publicists will illustrate the relationship between the art of film and the business of film. Guests will include screenwriters, agents, producers, directors, distributors, film festival curators and film critics. In short, we will try to cover all aspects of making a film, and explore that often-tricky intersection of art and commerce.\n\nFall or Spring\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2900 Post War Japanese Cinema\n\nMizoguchi Kenji, Ozu Yasujiro, and Kurosawa Akira are recognized today as three of the most important and influential directors in Japanese cinema. In their films of the late 1940s and 1950s, these directors focused upon issues surrounding the human condition and the perception of truth, history, beauty, death, and other issues of the postwar period. This lecture course places their films in period context, and pays particular attention to the connections to other visual media, and to how \"art\" and \"history\" are being defined in the cinematic context. How other directors also took up these issues, and referred to the \"big three\" is also be discussed.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2900, EALC 1340\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2910 East Asian Cinema\n\nThis survey course introduces students to major trends, genres, directors, and issues in the cinemas of East Asian countries/regions, including Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Charting key developments over more than a hundred years from the early twentieth century to the present, this course examines films as aesthetic objects, asking questions about film form, narrative, and style. It also pays attention to the evolution of cinema as an institution (e.g. modes of production, circulation, and exhibition) in different cultural and political contexts. Weekly course materials will include both films (primary sources) and analytical readings (secondary sources). By the end of the course, students are expected to gain broad knowledge of East Asian cinema, develop skills of film analysis, and apply these skills to perform historically informed and culturally sensitive analysis of cinema. Prior knowledge of East Asian languages is NOT required.\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2910, EALC 1116\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6910, EALC 5116\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2935 Culture on Trial: Race, Media & Intellectual Property\n\nThis course explores the US intellectual property regime’s impact on the production, distribution and consumption of media and art.

Topics under consideration may include: spectatorship, authorship, the apparatus, sound, editing, realism, race, gender and sexuality, stardom, the culture industry, the nation and decolonization, what counts as film theory and what counts as cinema, and the challenges of considering film theory in a global context, including the challenge of working across languages. There will be an asynchronous weekly film screening for this course. No knowledge of film theory is presumed.\n\nNot Offered Every Year\n\nAlso Offered As: ARTH 2950, COML 2950, ENGL 2900, GSWS 2950\n\nMutually Exclusive: ARTH 6950\n\n1 Course Unit\n\nCIMS 2951 Digital and New Media Seminar\n\nThis course explores a particular topic in the study of digital and new media in an intensive and in-depth manner.
