Later, however, the victims are found dead of the same wounds that Montag gave them. Ed Bigelow, a young journalist with a trust fund and vintage style, tries to solve the mystery, but ends up discovering that he may be more involved than he first thought.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nKip Pardue as Edmund \"Ed\" Bigelow\n\nBijou Phillips as Maggie\n\nCrispin Glover as Montag the Magnificent\n\nJoshua Miller as Jinky\n\nBrad Dourif as Dr. Chong\n\nJeffrey Combs as The Geek\n\nGarz Chan as Annie\n\nTim Chiou as Chinese Mickey\n\nEvan Seinfeld as Frank\n\nSuicide Girls as Dell, Cecelia, Cayenne, and Rexina\n\nKenneth Moskow as Det.
