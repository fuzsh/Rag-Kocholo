        "text": "Video Vault – Horror Special features, Dead Shack (2017), Frozen (2010), The Return (2021), The Boy Behind the Door (2020), Vicious Fun (2020), Doctor Sleep (2019), The Innocents (1961) Daniel Isn’t Real (2019), Pearl (2022) and Slaughterhouse Rulez (2018).\n\n1.\n\nDEAD SHACK (2017)\n\nRENT, BUY OR STREAM ON SHUDDER\n\nBased on a classic cabin in the woods premise, Dead Shack laces its zombie gore with gloriously dark humour. Fourteen-year-old Jason (Matthew Nelson-Mahood) is about to escape his volatile home life for a weekend in the woods with best friend Colin (Gabriel LaBelle), his older sister Summer (Lizzie Boys), their dad Roger (Donavon Stinson) and his new girlfriend Lisa (Valerie Tian). The trip is about escape, their log cabin a sanctuary of relaxation, card games and teenage hormonal energy. However, not far up the road, a doting mother protects her unique family at all costs with their family mealtimes, a sinister game of cat and mouse. Dead Shack gloriously unpicks the family unit, openly challenging the notion that adults know best by placing its teen leads in charge. Here, its intelligent screenplay hums with brilliantly timed comedy while the blood and gore flow through creative, practical effects. The result is a genuinely engaging and entertaining zombie horror full of dry humour and Canadian charm.\n\n2.\n\nFROZEN (2010)\n\nDVD, BLU-RAY AND STREAMING\n\nIf you hate ski lifts and think they are the most dangerous contraptions ever made or have a deep-seated fear of wolves, Frozen may be a step too far in your weekend viewing choices! Adam Green’s Frozen is one of the most nerve-shredding films released during 2010 and a movie where you find yourself shrieking at the screen in horror as you watch three twenty-somethings fight for their lives on a stalled ski-lift as the night draws in. Joe (Shawn Ashmore), Dan (Kevin Zegers), and his girlfriend Parker (Emma Bell) are enjoying a weekend of skiing at a New England resort before their fun turns into gut-wrenching horror as a late-night trip down the mountain becomes a matter of life and death. As they sit alone in a swinging metal cradle, their conversations echo the terrors that await them as they attempt to figure out the best escape methods before they freeze: do they jump? Attempt to climb up to the cables, or sit tight and wait for help? There are no simple answers as you watch Adam Green’s taut, horrifying, brilliantly performed thriller and horror unfold. Frozen was largely overlooked upon its release, yet Green’s movie is a tour de force in terror that will leave you questioning whether to ever get on a ski lift again!\n\nVIDEO VAULT – HORROR SPECIAL\n\n3.\n\nTHE RETURN (2020)\n\nRENT, BUY OR STREAM ON SELECTED PLATFORMS\n\nWe all love a haunted house movie, right? On the first appearance, BJ Vernot’s new film would appear to fall directly into the traditional haunted house genre. After all, here we have a young man, Roger (Richard Harmon), returning to his family home following the sudden death of his father, where he is greeted by a mysterious apparition that emanates from the walls. However, BJ Vernot’s film is not what it initially appears to be, as it throws us a curveball of epic proportions. Much like Ghosts of War, The Return is a sci-fi thriller in supernatural clothing. I am not about to ruin the twists, but as with many films that attempt to transcend genre boundaries, there are a few problems; from a twist, you can see coming to a final act that descends into farce. However, despite these flaws, there is much to admire and enjoy, and The Return is creative and engaging, if not perfect.\n\n4.\n\nTHE BOY BEHIND THE DOOR (2020)\n\nSTREAMING ON SHUDDER\n\nAny mainstream horror that chooses child abduction and abuse as its main story walks a fine line. After all, how do you couple the true horror of child abuse and kidnapping with classic horror scares without becoming distasteful in the process? Many films, such as The Girl Next Door, have fallen foul of this balance over the years. However, The Boy Behind the Door navigates this fine line with skill, even if the film’s final act sadly resorts to a more traditional horror template. But, the ending aside, there is much to admire in David Charbonier and Justin Powell’s claustrophobic horror-thriller, including the performances of its young leads. The opening half of Charbonier and Powell’s film is full of tension as it creates a genuinely uncomfortable atmosphere that is only intensified by the lack of information at our disposal. However, within its final act, The Boy Behind the Door stumbles as it adopts a cat-and-mouse slasher aesthetic that avoids the significant issues raised earlier.\n\nVIDEO VAULT – HORROR SPECIAL\n\n5.\n\nVICIOUS FUN (2020)\n\nSTREAMING ON SHUDDER\n\nCanada has a long history of great horror, from Scanners to Black Christmas. Canadian horrors have long challenged the boundaries of the horror genre and redefined what is and can be; Director Cody Calahan’s Vicious Fun continues this trend by mixing classic slasher horror with tongue-in-cheek 80s-inspired humour. The result is a film that delivers exactly what it promises – Vicious Fun. Taking themes seen in Shudder’s underrated Monster Party but lacing them with delicious humour, wrapped up neatly in a bloody bow of 80s nostalgia, Vicious Fun is a great late-night horror/comedy full of gore and charm.\n\n6.\n\nDOCTOR SLEEP (2019)\n\n4K UHD, BLU-RAY, DVD AND STREAMING\n\nIt’s no secret that King wasn’t a fan of Kubrick’s 1980 version of his 1977 novel The Shining or that King’s 2013 sequel to his book, Doctor Sleep, was always going to be challenging to adapt due to Kubrick’s masterpiece deviating from his material. It is fair to say that director Mike Flanagan had a tough job when he took on Doctor Sleep; after all, how do you please the die-hard fans of Kubrick’s 1980 film and those who loved King’s 1977 and 2013 novels? Surprisingly, Flanagan managed the balancing act and delivered one of the finest horror films of 2019. Flanagan’s movie captures the beauty and terror of Kubrick’s 1980 horror masterpiece while lovingly translating Stephen King’s sequel for the big screen, creating a bridge between Kubrick and King that honours both. Here, Flanagan and King introduce us to one of the most terrifying characters of recent years, Rose the Hat, played brilliantly by Rebecca Ferguson, but make no mistake; it’s a young Jacob Tremblay who steals the show with one of the most horrific, powerful and nerve-shredding scenes ever committed to film.\n\nVIDEO VAULT – HORROR SPECIAL\n\n7.\n\nTHE INNOCENTS (1961)\n\nDVD, BLU-RAY AND STREAMING\n\nBased on the Henry James 1898 novella “The Turn of the Screw”, British director Jack Clayton’s 1961 film, The Innocents, is still the best screen adaptation of the Henry James story. Clayton builds tension from the first scene to the last, never seeking to offer quick answers to the ghostly themes at the heart of James’ eternally fascinating story. As Clayton wraps us in his chilling mystery, Deborah Kerr’s emotionally repressed teacher, Miss Giddens, slowly enters a maze of mystery and lies, the children in her care morphing from innocent munchkins into something far more fearsome. Cinematographer Freddie Francis cleverly uses the black-and-white CinemaScope frame to its full, bathing each scene in gothic shadows and vibrant white light. This world of childhood innocence and adult fear still manages to send a shiver down the spine of everyone watching 63 years after it first graced cinema screens. More than a chilling horror, Clayton’s The Innocents is a hauntingly beautiful film that carves a place in the memory and demands return viewings.\n\n8.\n\nDANIEL ISN’T REAL (2019)\n\nSTREAM ON ARROW\n\nWhat do you get when you take the brooding mystery of Donnie Darko and mix it with the imagery and style of Jacobs Ladder? The answer is one of the most divisive yet creative horrors of 2019: Daniel Isn’t Real. I say divisive as reviews for this movie were decidedly mixed, with many pointing to style over substance and a damaging take on mental health. However, this is a horror that takes some significant creative risks and isn’t afraid to merge psychological terror with supernatural evil, ultimately creating a movie that digs deep under the viewer’s skin, its lasting effect far more potent than the initial viewing. Some may find the content exploitative of mental health and, at times, insensitive. But, the real terror sits within the supernatural world created by screenwriters Brian DeLeeuw and Adam Egypt Mortimer.\n\n9.\n\nPEARL (2022)\n\nBLU-RAY, DVD AND STREAMING\n\nTi West’s clever homage to the 60s and 70s origins of the slasher, X, paid tribute to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Psycho, to name just two, in exploring the foundations and roots of the intersections between porn, horror and art. His prequel to X took one hell of a long time to reach British cinemas, mainly due to the pandemic, and sadly, this undoubtedly impacted its eventual arrival. But for those of us who patiently waited, Pearl was a blood-soaked, technicolour melodrama that quickly earned a place in the Horror Hall of Fame. Part homage to The Wizard of Oz and part love letter to melodrama horror movies like Joan Crawford’s underrated Strait-Jacket, West’s clever dissection of Corn Belt American horror is just as intelligent in its narrative structure and artistic vision as his first outing as he unpicks the relationship between melodrama, fantasy, rural America and horror.\n\nIn the hands of the outstanding Mia Goth, Pearl is a glorious homage to 1930s, 40s, and 50s filmmaking and the birth of the all-American horror flick; after all, The Wizard of Oz, for all its colour and light, carries some pretty brutal scenes (flying monkey’s anyone?), in fact, it could be argued The Wizard of Oz had as much impact on modern horror as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). Pearl asks us to explore the foundations of Corn Belt horror through a deliciously lavish homage to a style of filmmaking that has long since vanished. Big, bold and bloody brilliant Pearl is a tongue-in-cheek horror masterpiece.\n\n10.\n\nSLAUGHTERHOUSE RULEZ (2018)\n\nFirst, if your parents, no matter how well-meaning, decide to send you to a boarding school named ‘Slaughterhouse’, they plan to rent your room permanently. And second, if that school, no matter how posh has a colossal fracking site next door, run!"
